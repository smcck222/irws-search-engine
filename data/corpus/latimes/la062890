METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY ORDERS STUDY ON 8 TRAFFIC 
BOTTLENECKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, acting on a motion by 
chairman Ed Edelman, directed its staff Wednesday to conduct a study on how to 
relieve traffic congestion in the county's eight most clogged corridors. 
</P>
<P>
The six-month study will lead to the development of a congestion management 
plan, required by the recent passage of Proposition 111, which raised the state 
gasoline tax. 
</P>
<P>
"If the cities (in the county) want money from the commission" they will have 
to work with the agency to implement the plan," Edelman said. 
</P>
<P>
The gas tax hike -- starting with a nickel-a-gallon increase Aug. 1 and 
one-cent increase for each of the next four years -- is expected to raise $15.5 
billion over the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We can now draw strategies that will help provide the relief to commuters who 
must travel on the busiest" roads, Edelman said.

The trick, of course, was to think cool. KRTH-FM did its best by spinning such 
platters as Bing Crosby's "White Christmas," Johnny Mathis' "Winter 
Wonderland," and Andy Williams' "Happy Holidays." 
</P>
<P>
You had to keep telling yourself that at least it was dry. (Forget that a 
microwave is dry, too.) 
</P>
<P>
Ken Smith, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., pointed out that it actually 
"doesn't feel as hot" as the temperature indicated. 
</P>
<P>
"With the general humidity dropping below 20% in the afternoon, it creates a 
heat-index temperature that is actually lower" than the stated temperature, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the mercury hit 109 Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But the heat-index temperature was only 107. 
</P>
<P>
 Jingle bells, jingle bells ... 
</P>
<P>
 One bank in Pasadena didn't help matters, though. Pamela Warrick saw its 
electronic time-and-temperature sign jump from 143 to 144. (But the heat index 
wouldn't be more than 140.) 
</P>
<P>
And then there was that morning spill of a load of barbecue sauce on the Pomona 
Freeway, which prompted disc jockeys to joke that the red-hot pavement was 
ready if any listeners felt like splashing down their steaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Dashing through the snow ... 
</P>
<P>
 Glen George of Pasadena faxed Only in L.A. a missive scolding us for jinxing 
the city on Tuesday by noting in miscelLAny that the all-time high at the Civic 
Center was 110. Old Sol, obviously feeling challenged, increased the mark to 
112 that day. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't ever again publish record temperatures," he said. "You probably should 
avoid earthquake information while you're at it." 
</P>
<P>
Let alone talk of "earthquake weather." (It's hot and windy, remember?) 
</P>
<P>
We tried to make up for it today by running a nostalgic photo of the last 
snowstorm to hit the Civic Center. It was just the other day: Jan. 11, 1949. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Frost nipping at your nose ... 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, The Times took a positive attitude when the temperature in L.A. hit 
109 not quite a century ago -- on Sept. 25, 1891. 
</P>
<P>
Like other L.A. papers back then, The Times was sensitive about the frontier 
pueblo's image back East. While "the day was 'warm,' " it allowed, "it should 
be remembered that there was nothing in the shape of sunstroke or prostration 
by heat, as would have been the case in any of the eastern cities with a 
temperature of 90 degrees or even less, so that the California climate has 
nothing to fear from having the whole truth told." 
</P>
<P>
 Sleigh bells ring. Are ya listenin'? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
miscelLAny: 
</P>
<P>
The average high temperature at Civic Center in the month of June is 78 
degrees.

AL MARTINEZ: THE DAY THAT THE REDS CAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was the day the temperature reached 112 in downtown L.A. 
</P>
<P>
I was wearing the lightest suit I own, which is one of those rumpled, off-white 
things favored by British black marketeers in Kuala Lumpur. 
</P>
<P>
I was also wearing a Hawaiian shirt I bought at Penney's. It was drenched with 
sweat and stuck to my body like fly paper. I looked like hell. 
</P>
<P>
That was particularly obvious because I was in one of the toniest clothing 
stores on Rodeo Drive, interviewing the mayor of Moscow near shirts that cost 
$300 each and a cashmere sports coat worth more than everything in my closet. 
</P>
<P>
Even a leather chewing gum case sold for $145. I don't think I paid that much 
for my suit. 
</P>
<P>
The place was Hermes, an establishment that is to Penney's what Paris is to 
Bellflower. 
</P>
<P>
There were actually four Russians in the party and they were visiting at the 
invitation of the L.A. Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising. 
</P>
<P>
They straggled in about an hour late, looking more like survivors from the 
battle of Stalingrad than messengers of a New Russia. That's what heat and smog 
can do to a man. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor of Moscow, Yuri Louzshkov, was not the most important Russian among 
them. Pavel Bounitch was. He is an economist, a member of the Supreme Soviet 
and the architect of perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
 This was whispered to me by several people in the entourage, both American and 
Russian, who hovered over me like bees at a honey farm. 
</P>
<P>
Well, I was all they had. 
</P>
<P>
No other media people showed up. It was just the Russians, two translators, two 
public relations people, some Hermes sales personnel and me, in my Kuala Lumpur 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
I am thinking, at last, an opportunity to write an Important Column, which is 
what my leaders are constantly urging me to do. Never mind your dog-and-pony 
essays, they say. We want substance! 
</P>
<P>
I will call it simply A Very Important Column, discuss perestroika and glasnost 
in concise and vivid terms and be invited to join the International Fellowship 
of Pundits. My dog and my pony will prance with joy. 
</P>
<P>
But things went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant store manager Elisabeth D'Chartoy presented each of the four Russians 
with a $95 silk tie. While they were thanking her, she made the mistake of 
offering to let them exchange their ties for other designs and/or colors if 
they wished. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor of Moscow, who looked a little like Charles Durning playing Nikita 
Khrushchev, said OK, or the Russian equivalent thereof, and chose another one, 
just like that. I've never seen a mayor make a decision that quickly. 
</P>
<P>
It was a ridiculous black and white speckled number, but, hey, these are people 
raised on borscht and boiled potatoes. They've got a long way to go before they 
attain even my level of haute couture. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the others also made up their minds quickly, but Bounitch, the architect 
of Russian perestroika, lingered . . . and lingered . . . and lingered. 
</P>
<P>
I saw my Bird of Significance flutter out the window and die in the crushing 
heat. 
</P>
<P>
Someone suggested I ought to start interviewing the mayor, since time was 
fleeting and Bounitch was drifting somewhere between Ivy League diagonals and 
paisley prints. 
</P>
<P>
If the theory of perestroika were neckties, he'd still be working on it. Every 
once in awhile he said "Goot," meaning not bad, but then went on to something 
else. 
</P>
<P>
Our translator was Sophia Lansky, who did a very nice job, but there was more 
than a language barrier here. 
</P>
<P>
Louzshkov, being a mayor, was fluent in the dialect of diversion and managed to 
avoid adding anything noteworthy to the current dialogue between us and what 
used to be known as the Evil Empire. 
</P>
<P>
He did say that the capitalistic elegance characterized by Hermes seemed to be 
unnecessary, but since the store had customers, it was OK. I'm paraphrasing, of 
course. 
</P>
<P>
He was basically saying if it sells, sell it. 
</P>
<P>
What Russia needs, he added, was more of the kind of peasant clothes I was 
wearing; good, I mean goot, basic stuff. "Our market is thin," he said, "and so 
deep in its emptiness." 
</P>
<P>
I tried to get a little into what appears to be an end to the Cold War and 
possibly to Godless Communism (do we still call it that?), but platitudes 
prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
He is glad we are friends, he is having a fine time in Beverly Hills, and he is 
delighted that the Soviet Union is concentrating on the production of clothes 
instead of tanks. Food will come next. 
</P>
<P>
Just about then, Bounitch chose a tie of golden zebras grazing on a pale blue 
Masai Mara and everyone marched out the door, taking my chance at significance 
with them. 
</P>
<P>
So much for the Russian Bear. Wanna hear about my dog and pony?

HEAT-RELATED ILLNESSES 
</P>
<P>
People most at risk in hot weather are those suffering from such conditions as 
diabetes, heart disease, blood vessel disease, stroke, burns, alcoholism or 
obesity. People who have reduced capacity to sweat may also have problems in 
the heat, as will those with diarrhea, who can easily become dehydrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Hot weather such as Southern California is experiencing can cause heat-related 
problems including: 
</P>
<P>
 Dehydration 
</P>
<P>
Sunburn 
</P>
<P>
Heat cramps 
</P>
<P>
Heat exhaustion 
</P>
<P>
Heat stroke 
</P>
<P>
WARNING SIGNS 
</P>
<P>
Heat Cramps -- The least serious of the heat-related illnesses. Usually occur 
after exercise or physical labor in the heat 
</P>
<P>
Symptoms 
</P>
<P>
* Clammy or sweaty skin 
</P>
<P>
* Possible weakness or nausea 
</P>

</P>
<P>
* Muscle cramps, often beginning in the abdomen and legs 
</P>
<P>
First aid 
</P>
<P>
* Get out of the sun and into a cool place. 
</P>
<P>
* Lie down, drink cool, non-alcoholic liquids. 
</P>
<P>
Heat Exhaustion -- The most common of the heat-related illnesses. Brought on by 
excessive sweating (loss of body fluids). 
</P>
<P>
Symptoms 
</P>
<P>

HERMOSA BEACH WITHDRAWS $1,000 IN SISTER CITY FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hermosa Beach's Sister City Program, a volunteer group that sponsors a student 
exchange with a city in Mexico, suffered a setback on Tuesday when the City 
Council withdrew its annual $1,000 contribution to the program. 
</P>
<P>
The program had been a target of criticism earlier this year over charges that 
local students had been poorly supervised on the group's annual exchange trip 
to Hermosa Beach's sister city of Loreto, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
But Mayor Roger Creighton, who was among those previously questioning the 
management of the civic organization, said the decision to pull the city's 
contribution to the program was unrelated to the controversy over the Mexico 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
Creighton and other city officials said the decision was based on the refusal 
of the program's director, George Barks, to make an adequate accounting for the 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
Barks, who was not at the council meeting, said on Wednesday that his books 
were unavailable to the city treasurer because they were being independently 
audited. 
</P>
<P>
The program director added that he had not explained that to city officials 
when he refused to turn over the organization's financial records. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I should have told them," he said, "but I didn't want to give them 
incomplete documents." 
</P>
<P>
He added that he hopes the city will reconsider its withdrawal of support when 
the books become available, because the city's annual contribution represents 
about a fifth of the program's $5,000 annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose we could survive without it," Barks said, "but every little bit 
helps." 
</P>
<P>
The criticism concerning the trip to Loreto in February focused on charges by 
parents that supervision had been so lax that several of the 21 seventh- and 
eighth-graders who participated in the excursion were able to sneak away from 
four chaperones and get drunk. 
</P>
<P>
In one incident, a 14-year-old boy passed out after sharing a bottle of vodka 
with five friends, Barks acknowledged. In another, a 13-year-old girl reported 
that the teen-agers in her host family had shared cigarettes and a case of 
Corona beer with her and two friends while driving around Loreto. 
</P>
<P>
Barks launched an investigation into the incident after it came to light in 
late March. The program director said his group is rewriting guidelines for the 
trip and hopes to have new rules ready by the beginning of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
But the Hermosa Beach school board -- which in the past had helped recruit 
students for the trip -- subsequently decided to end its participation in the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Barks said he plans to present the school board with the new guidelines for the 
trip in hopes of getting it to reconsider its decision.

JURY CLEARS OFFICERS IN BRUTALITY CASE; 
</P>
<P>
POLICE: THE PANEL DID NOT BELIEVE THERE WAS ENOUGH PROOF THAT AN INGLEWOOD 
SHOPKEEPER, HIS SON AND A FAMILY FRIEND WERE SERIOUSLY HURT DURING THEIR 
ARRESTS SIX YEARS AGO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Inglewood police officers did not use excessive force when they arrested three 
men after a family celebration at a local restaurant six years ago, a Torrance 
Superior Court jury decided Monday. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of two days of deliberation, the jury voted 9 to 3 to reject claims 
by an Inglewood shopkeeper, his son and a family friend that police brutally 
beat them during their arrests. 
</P>
<P>
James Boedeker, 55, his son, Michael, 30, and their friend, Tony Kemp, 35, sued 
the city of Inglewood and five of its officers after their arrest on April 20, 
1984, on charges of being drunk in public. The three said they had been 
drinking beer that night but that they were not drunk. 
</P>
<P>
Because a criminal trial could have cost the Boedekers a great deal in 
attorneys' fees, their attorney, Linda Rice said, they agreed to plead no 
contest to infractions of disturbing the peace. Kemp, who was charged with 
felony assault on a police officer, pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge 
for similar reasons, Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
The three men testified during the three-week civil trial that after they were 
handcuffed, officers deliberately slammed Kemp into a car, hit Kemp and the 
senior Boedeker with their fists, struck the senior Boedeker with a blackjack 
and kicked Kemp as he lay on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
But defense attorney Timothy Walker told jurors that the men concocted a story 
about their arrests, which he said took place after a police officer came 
across Boedeker and his son brawling in Boedeker's store parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Walker was on vacation when the verdict was read and a stand-in attorney 
declined to comment on the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors said they did not believe there was enough physical proof that the three 
men had been seriously hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked at the photos and I just didn't see it," juror Jon DeCuir of Torrance 
said. "Some kind of medical evidence could have answered our questions." 
</P>
<P>
Rice said Superior Court Judge Douglas McKee barred her from putting the 
emergency room doctors who treated the men on the stand because they had not 
been cleared as expert witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position was the doctors were percipient witnesses," who did not need 
advance clearance as experts, Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
She said she plans to appeal the jury's decision, in part because of McKee's 
ruling on medical testimony.

THIS JUNE IS WORKING ON A RECORD FOR WEIRDNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is supposed to be June Gloom. That's what the month between May and July 
is ordinarily called in San Diego. But in looking for a word to describe this 
June, gloom just isn't a strong contender. 
</P>
<P>
Local experts suggest maybe a new name is needed. 
</P>
<P>
June Weird? 
</P>
<P>
As San Diego broke a record for heat Wednesday -- the high at Lindbergh Field 
reached 91 degrees, surpassing the mark of 1976 -- the weathered weather types 
scrambled to find out why. 
</P>
<P>
"This has certainly been an unusual month," said Dan Atkin, meteorologist with 
the National Weather Service. "It's been the wettest June ever in San Diego, 
and that was from one storm. And now we've got this heat." 
</P>
<P>
Atkin said San Diego received 0.38 of an inch of rain on June 9, followed by 
0.48 of an inch the next day, breaking two daily records. The accumulated 0.86 
of an inch set a monthly record. 
</P>
<P>
"In average years," Atkin said, "June is our cloudiest month of the year. On 
the average, the smallest amount of possible sunshine we receive in San Diego 
is 57%. We don't have complete figures yet, but this June has been much sunnier 
than normal." 
</P>
<P>
Atkin said the traditional June Gloom is caused by a blast of heat welling up 
from the desert and coming into conflict with "very cool air over the water. At 
the same time, high pressure is starting to form, which traps the marine air. 
In July and August, we usually break through the (temperature) inversion, and 
it gets much, much hotter. This year, it happened earlier."

Atkin said the temperature this time of year usually hovers around 73 degrees. 
He speculated that part of the extreme conditions, not just here but 
nationally, is caused by El Nino and the greenhouse effect. Not just summers, 
but winters, too, Atkin said, are now more severe. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Hibbert, a meteorologist with Weatherdata Inc. in Wichita, Kan., which 
supplies weather information for The Times, believes the greenhouse effect and 
El Nino -- as well as its "female" counterpart, La Nina -- have had a profound 
effect on weather nationwide, particularly in the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
Hibbert defines the greenhouse effect as "man's influence on the environment, 
where industrial processes and consumer excesses have generated gases that tend 
to absorb solar radiation rather than let it transfer freely." 
</P>
<P>
"El Nino is the shifting of temperatures on the surface of the sea," Hibbert 
said. "People generally don't recognize that oceans cover three-fourths of the 
planet's surface, receiving three-fourths of the sunlight that shines on the 
Earth at any given time. Normally, El Nino affects Southern California with 
much wetter weather. 
</P>
<P>
"What people don't know as much about is La Nina, which imposes the opposite 
condition. That produces a cooling of (ocean) surface temperatures, resulting 
in excessively dry weather, which you're now having in Southern California," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Both can be equally virulent, especially with both occurring in conjunction 
with other weather patterns. What you have to remember is, with weather, 
nothing stands alone -- everything is interconnected. And, whatever the 
connection is, at the moment, it's producing extreme heat and very dry 
conditions in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"But believe me, it's hardly as bad as Wichita, where I am. I'll trade with you 
any time."

THE FIGHT TO SAVE A GEM OF A PLACE; 
</P>
<P>
HERMOSA BEACH: THE POIRIERS HAVE OPERATED THEIR DINER FOR 28 YEARS. NOW THEY'RE 
BEING EVICTED. BUT CUSTOMERS AREN'T GIVING UP WITHOUT A FIGHT.

<P>
It's kind of glum these days down at The Gem Cafe, behind the gingham curtains 
and the Formica countertop. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, the ham is still fresh-baked, and just the other day a pair of regulars 
declared that the homemade coconut cream pie was "better than sex." But for the 
last month, it has seemed, about every other word at Henry and Grace Poirier's 
Hermosa Beach diner has been about its imminent demise. 
</P>
<P>
After 28 years on Pier Avenue, the Poiriers and their cafe are being evicted 
July 1. The landlords, film producer Warren Miller and his wife, Laurie, 
describe it as a business decision. 
</P>
<P>
But the Poiriers, who are in their 60s, say the move will deprive them of a 
retirement nest egg they were counting on. 
</P>
<P>
And their customers -- who say it will deprive them of a darn good cup of 
coffee -- have rallied to the cause. 
</P>
<P>
"We've formed a Save The Gem Cafe Committee," said local businessman Richard 
McCurdy, who added that he has gathered the names of more than 60 people who 
want to help keep the Poiriers in business. Among other things, McCurdy and his 
group have offered, in vain, to buy the tiny storefront. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a gathering place. You feel like you're sitting down with Mom and Dad," 
said McCurdy, who for the last three years has dropped by The Gem at least 
three times a week for a slice of lemon cake. "Unfortunately, Henry's not the 
best businessman in the world, and he's been renting there month-to-month for 
years. He doesn't have a lease." 
</P>
<P>
The Poiriers say that for the last year they have tried in vain to get the 
Millers to write them a lease. But Laurie Miller says they were offered a lease 
several years ago and turned it down. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides say communication has been bad: The Poiriers don't want to deal with 
Warren Miller's property manager and Miller -- a successful filmmaker with a 
string of cult movies about downhill skiing to his credit -- moved to Hawaii 
several years ago and no longer works out of the studio next door. 
</P>
<P>
Without a lease, the Poiriers say, they can't sell their restaurant. And if 
they can't sell, they can't retire. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what I'm going to do. This has been my life for almost 28 years," 
said 65-year-old Henry Poirier, wiping a damp rag across his gray Formica 
countertop. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1964, when Miller bought the building in which the cafe is located, 
Poirier said, he has operated without a lease, on what he believed was "a 
gentleman's agreement," paying Miller the $475-a-month rent in cash. 
</P>
<P>
But when he decided to retire this year and asked Miller to draw up a lease, he 
said, he was unable to get the landlord to meet with him. 
</P>
<P>
Warren Miller -- who at 66 is himself preparing to retire -- was unavailable 
for comment. But his wife, who has been handling his property for the last four 
years, said the Poiriers had ample time to prepare for their retirement and 
decades in which to obtain a lease. 
</P>
<P>
Laurie Miller noted that The Gem's rent has been far below market value. A 
dentist's office next door in a smaller space was renting for $1,100 a month, 
she said. Moreover, she added, the Poiriers had refused in the past to sign 
leases drawn up by her husband's property managers. In April, she said, she and 
her husband were approached by a prospective tenant, and, believing that the 
Poiriers were ready to retire anyway, the Millers leased the space. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes people have to do things that aren't easy for business reasons, that 
are part of an overall picture that not everybody can see," Laurie Miller said. 
"Had there been a different personality to our relationship over the years, it 
might have been different. But it's a business decision, and it's our right to 
make that decision. They refused to have a lease, and you can't have it both 
ways." 
</P>
<P>
Henry Poirier denied there had been any ill will between the Millers and 
himself. In fact, he said, he was taken by surprise when the eviction notice 
arrived May 15. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't understand this," he said. "If he wanted more money, why didn't he 
come over and tell me? Why send a cold thing like this?" 
</P>
<P>
Poirier's customers echoed his anger and bafflement. 
</P>
<P>
"They've handled this in such a cold, callous, entrepreneurial manner. These 
are elderly people. It's like hearing that somebody has decided to send Mom and 
Dad off to the home," said actor Max Wright, who played the father on the NBC 
sitcom, "ALF." 
</P>
<P>
Wright, who is helping McCurdy publicize The Gem's plight, said that his group 
offered to buy the restaurant for a little more than $200,000 but that the 
Millers refused, citing potential tax losses. For the last several weeks, he 
added, his group has been searching for alternative restaurant sites. 
</P>
<P>
But in any case, Wright and other customers said, it would be impossible to 
recreate the chatty ambience of The Gem, which Poirier bought in 1962 for 
$6,000 from two sisters who had opened it in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been coming to this place since before Henry owned it, even, since right 
after the war," said 84-year-old Jay D. Lusher, settling into his customary 
seat at the counter's far end. 
</P>
<P>
"That'll be World War II," chimed retiree Dick Shrode from a few seats down, 
where he was splitting a slice of chocolate layer cake with his wife, Dolores. 
</P>
<P>
"When my wife was very sick," Lusher went on, "before she passed on in 1985, 
Henry made me meals to take to her. Mashed potatoes, vegetables, meat, 
sometimes pie. At the end, when she couldn't eat meat anymore, he fixed her two 
kinds of squash. She liked that. " 
</P>
<P>
It has been customers such as Lusher and Shrode, Poirier said, who have given 
him his modest living all these years, and his dream had been to sell the 
restaurant for $60,000, and to train the new owners in his tricks of the trade: 
How to wash the floors and the windows just so. How to roast the beef and bake 
the ham. How to rise at 6 a.m., as his wife still does, to make the homemade 
fruit and cream pies. 
</P>
<P>
That skill, he said, is what will be lost when the landlords shut down The Gem. 
</P>
<P>
"Places like this, they're on the way out," Poirier said. "Places like this are 
hard to find."

'GROSS NEGLIGENCE' CITED IN FILING MURDER CHARGES AGAINST BOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prosecutors say they took the unusual step this week of filing murder charges 
against a 13-year-old Inglewood boy because he showed gross negligence when he 
allegedly clicked a semiautomatic pistol and threatened a group of children 
even though he may not have intended to kill his 14-year-old friend. 
</P>
<P>
The filing of a murder charge against a 13-year-old is still unusual in Los 
Angeles County, although gang-related killings have brought the number of 
children under 14 charged with murder to about 15 a year, law-enforcement 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors face one additional hurdle in charging a child under 14 with a 
crime: They must prove that the minor knew that his or her conduct was wrong. 
Those 14 and older are presumed to know right from wrong. 
</P>
<P>
John Spillane, a deputy district attorney at Eastlake Juvenile Hall, said 
prosecutors use a juvenile's record and interviews with the defendant and 
family members to judge whether a defendant knew that his actions were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
A murder charge against a youngster was once a rarity, said Spillane, who is 
not handling the Inglewood case, but "nowadays it's not that rare." 
</P>
<P>
The Inglewood suspect, whose name was not released because of his age, 
allegedly brought the weapon, a .25-caliber semiautomatic pistol, to Crozier 
Junior High School last Thursday, the day of the killing, and showed it to 
friends on the school playground, classmates said. 
</P>
<P>
"When he pulled it out, my friend and I just ran away," one boy said. 
</P>
<P>
After school he allegedly brandished the gun again before a small group of 
children outside an apartment complex on South Fir Street near his home, police 
said. Witnesses said the suspect asked several of the children whether they 
thought it would hurt if he shot them. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said one young girl in the group walked away, but Lydell Carr, a 
14-year-old classmate, said he wasn't afraid of the gun. 
</P>
<P>
"He was trying to show off," Lydell's older brother, Tramaine Carr, said of the 
suspect. "Kids who were there told me that he clicked the gun twice. My little 
brother said he wasn't afraid. That doesn't mean he had to shoot him." 
</P>
<P>
Tramaine Carr said he was pleased by the news that the suspect in his brother's 
death had been charged with murder. He said his 6-year-old sister does not 
understand what happened to Lydell and spent Tuesday, the day the suspect was 
arraigned, writing a letter to her brother in heaven. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral services for Lydell Carr will be at 1 p.m. Friday at Southside 
Christian Place at 11243 S. Vermont Ave., Los Angeles. Burial will follow at 
Evergreen Cemetery, 204 N. Evergreen Ave. Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
At Crozier Junior High School, where both Lydell Carr and the suspect were 
enrolled, school officials said this week that they had no idea the suspect had 
a gun in his pocket as he roamed the campus the day of the killing. 
</P>
<P>
Most eighth-graders were on a class trip to an amusement park that day, but the 
suspect could not attend because he was not eligible for graduation, school 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Silvers, the guidance counselor for both boys, described Lydell as "a 
very nice, likeable person" and the suspect as "a little bit defiant and aloof 
with an I-don't-care attitude."

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Flag Amendment 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 254 to 177, the House failed to achieve the two-thirds majority it 
needed to approve a constitutional amendment against desecration of the 
American flag. Although thisshelved the proposed change in the Bill of Rights, 
the Senate was to take up the measure (HJR 350) to get its members on record on 
the explosive issue. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-word constitutional amendment sought to clear the way for state and 
federal laws protecting the flag from physical abuse. Such measures now violate 
the Constitution's free-speech guarantees, the Supreme Court has held. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.) said: "Let us take the flag out of the gutter 
where the counterculture has dragged it and is sneering at us. This is an 
opportunity not to get even with some creeps but to say there are transcendent 
values that are important to every American that unify us, that bring us 
together as a community, one nation under God, indivisible." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Wayne Owens (D-Utah) said: "How foolish we look to allow a few fools 
who have burned a few flags in well-publicized events to drive us into this 
feeding frenzy, where we . . . attempt the desecration of the Bill of Rights by 
an unjustifiable and unneeded constitutional amendment." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was for changing the Constitution to protect the flag.

Flag Statute 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 179 to 236, the House defeated a bill to protect the American flag 
by statute rather than the rejected route (above) of amending the Constitution. 
The bill (HR 5091) made it a federal crime to damage a flag owned by the 
government or situated on U. S. property, or in a way that provokes violence. 
The wording was designed to get around Supreme Court objections to previous 
flag protection laws. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.) said: "Our purpose is not to punish speech but to 
punish vandalism against the flag." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.) called the measure "a fig leaf for 
those who are attempting to get political cover" after having voted minutes 
earlier against a constitutional amendment. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was for the statute.

Hatch Act Veto 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 327 to 93, the House overrode President Bush's veto of a bill (HR 
20) permitting civil servants and postal workers limited involvement in 
partisan politics under the 51-year-old Hatch Act. But the bill died when the 
Senate later upheld the veto. 
</P>
<P>
The bill gave an estimated 3 million federal employees the opportunity to take 
part in political campaigns and causes off the job, but stopped short of 
allowing them to seek public office. 
</P>
<P>
Override supporter Gerry Sikorski (D-Minn.) said a President concerned about 
politicized workers should "quit appointing those ambassadors who simply gave 
$100,000 to the Republican National Committee." 
</P>

PEOPLE: BARBER PURSUES DANCING, SPORTS AT A FAST CLIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By her smooth strides, you can tell Jacquie Watson is a dancer, but it's hard 
to imagine she was and still is a jock. 
</P>
<P>
Or that she was a tomboy. 
</P>
<P>
Or that she makes her living as a mustache and beard stylist. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always different," said the divorced Anaheim woman, who has a daughter, 
22. "I was ticked in high school because I couldn't play against the guys. 
Sports was not really 'in' for women in those days." 
</P>
<P>
She said she played basketball, soccer, softball, volleyball and tennis. And 
she skied on both water and snow. 
</P>
<P>
"I played women's Triple A softball when I was in high school," she said. "I 
guess I was a pro except I never got any money for playing. I once thought I 
might do it for a living." 
</P>
<P>
She played first base. 
</P>
<P>
Playing sports was easy for her. 
</P>
<P>
"It just came naturally to me and I enjoyed competition," she said. "I found it 
was a thrill being better than someone else and being a winner most of the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Watson keeps in shape these days by dancing three nights a week and she 
recently won a dance contest in the swing division. She also competes in the 
two-step, tango and waltz. 
</P>
<P>
"I still water and snow ski and that helps me stay right," said Watson, who 
became a barber because she felt cosmetology schools didn't offer a good course 
in haircutting. 
</P>
<P>
She owns Mustache Junction in Anaheim and has a staff of five barbers, all 
women. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that women are trained right from the beginning to take care of hair 
and to wear their hair in the best style for them," said Watson, who has been 
barbering and styling mustaches and beards for 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
That's why women become better barbers, she reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"Women seem to know how a man wants his hair cut," she said, and notes that men 
don't complain as much as women and they tip better. "Men want to please women 
and have faith that our women know how other women like to have a man look." 
</P>
<P>
Although her business is flourishing, Watson feels that it may be time for her 
to find a new career. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually it's past time for me to move on to another trade," she said. "I'm 
thinking about computers. I want to know how to use them in business." 
</P>
<P>
Before barbering, Watson worked at a phone company, took shorthand classes to 
become a secretary, got married, had a daughter and got divorced. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed a profession and picked barbering," she said. Her original goal was 
to be a kindergarten teacher. "That didn't work out," she said. 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, Watson plans to continue hair, mustache and beard styling 
and cutting. 
</P>
<P>
"There are very few places that will do a beard or mustache's shape," Watson 
said, "because most hair salon barbers don't know how." 
</P>
<P>
Beards and mustaches are popular these days, said Watson, who notes that men 
sometimes take better care of them than their hair or clothes. 
</P>
<P>
She said that the style for hair today is longer in the back and shorter in the 
front and top. But she prefers a man with short hair all over and a flattop. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I'm just old-fashioned," she said. 
</P>
<P>
John Reeves celebrated his 70th birthday Tuesday by playing two games of 
basketball at the Santa Ana YMCA where he plays ball three nights a week with 
15 other players. 
</P>
<P>
They surprised the Diamond Bar resident with with a chocolate birthday cake and 
a basketball signed by all the regulars. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the guys said people make me out to be a real good guy," Reeves said. 
"But he told me I was the worst fouler on the floor. Can you imagine that?" 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledgments -- Anaheim resident Elaine Manning was named "Outstanding 
Director of Volunteer Services" by Directors of Volunteers in Agencies (DOVIA). 
Manning, volunteer director of the Speech and Language Development Center in 
Buena Park, was selected over 75 nominees.

ARTICLE UNFAIR TO SENIOR HOUSING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times' article on June 13 regarding the proposed senior citizen housing 
project over a city-owned parking lot in Sherman Oaks was unfair and 
misleading. 
</P>
<P>
As a former chief deputy to Zev Yaroslavsky, and a City Council candidate last 
April, I believe his proposal is creative in scope and helps to provide 
much-needed housing for senior and low-income families in the upscale Sherman 
Oaks community. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Katz should be commended for coming up with this proposal to utilize a 
very valuable parcel of real estate for senior housing and increased off-street 
parking for the merchants of Ventura Boulevard. If this proposal is approved by 
the Department of Housing and Urban Development in Washington, seniors will be 
able to live in apartments priced at $200-$300 per month instead of the present 
$1,000 charged in the Sherman Oaks area. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of pointing out the very positive aspects of this proposal, The Times 
insinuates Katz had an unethical involvement in the project because his wife 
serves on Yaroslavsky's staff. Should the city prohibit Howard Katz from 
offering innovative proposals because his wife is employed by the city of Los 
Angeles? I hope not!

COUNCIL ADOPTS NEW GENERAL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rolling Hills City Council has adopted an updated General Plan, a key step 
toward revising zoning to conform with development trends in the exclusive, 
gated community. 
</P>
<P>
The new plan replaces one that was adopted in 1973 when the city's population 
was about 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
The city's current population is about 2,200. 
</P>
<P>
The revised plan was adopted Monday without a portion addressing affordable 
housing. A committee made up of council members Gordana Swanson and Jody 
Murdock will report to the council in September on how the city can supply nine 
units of affordable housing in a city where the least expensive house costs 
more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
State law requires cities to find ways of offering affordable housing. Cities 
that fail to do this face potential lawsuits for not providing housing for all 
income groups.

2,000 GALLONS OF GAS SPILL IN CARSON AFTER ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two thousand gallons of gasoline spilled from an Arco tanker truck involved in 
a collision Wednesday in Carson near two refineries. 
</P>
<P>
The accident on Sepulveda Boulevard snarled traffic, but did not result in a 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Olson, Carson public safety director, said the tanker driver suffered 
minor injuries after being thrown through the vehicle's windshield. The driver, 
whose name was not released, landed in the gutter, where gasoline was flowing. 
</P>
<P>
"He was almost totally immersed," Olson said, "Shell refinery people drug him 
out of there." 
</P>
<P>
Olson also said one firefighter who was helping clean up the spill was overcome 
by heat. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 firefighters from the Los Angeles County Fire Department, as well as 
fire brigades from the nearby Shell and Arco refineries, spread foam on the 
spill and dammed it to limit potentially explosive leakage into storm drains. 
Later, the tanker truck, which had tipped over, was drained of about 3,000 
gallons of unspilled gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
The accident, which occurred at 10:19 a.m., blocked traffic on one of the 
city's main thoroughfares for about two hours. "It jammed traffic up pretty 
good for a while, particularly at Wilmington and Sepulveda," Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
The collision occurred when a truck cab skidded for an unknown reason into the 
path of the tanker truck, Olson said. The name of the uninjured truck cab 
driver was not released. 
</P>
<P>
Olson said no motor vehicle charges have been filed against either driver.

It's not surprising that Meese would write a column extolling the virtues of 
insider trading. His inability to recognize while-collar crime is what got him 
tossed out on his can in the first place. What's your excuse for publishing it?

NELSON MANDELA'S CONTROVERSIAL TIES TO ARAFAT, KADAFI AND CASTRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In reply to "Hero's Welcome for a Man U.S. Betrayed: Mandela Comes to America" 
(by Sanford J. Ungar, Opinion, June 17): I'm again disappointed in how 
Americans continue to browbeat themselves for committing perfectly justifiable 
acts. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-eight years ago, when our CIA helped to finger Mandela, the Cold War was 
at a high pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Russia and its communist allies were threatening U.S. interests all over the 
globe. The threat to South Africa was obviously apparent. A communist takeover 
would cut off our raw resources and give Russia a strategic base at the tip of 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. did not "betray" Mandela. He was a part of a threat to us at that 
time. His present hatred for the U.S., perhaps because of our aid to South 
Africa, is readily apparent. Mandela's best friend is Kadafi. He's quoted as 
saying, "We consider ourselves comrades in arms" -- referring to Kadafi (Part 
A, May 19). Mandela goes on to condemn the U.S. for our retaliatory raid on 
Libya in 1986 in reaction to Libyan-sponsored terrorist attacks. 
</P>
<P>
This is the same Libya that furnishes terrorists with Semtex, their favorite 
explosive. The same Libya that's rebuilding its poison and nerve gas 
facilities. And this is the same Mandela that supports PLO terrorist Arafat 
with hugs and verbal assistance. 
</P>
<P>
The Times front page of June 18 points out how fund-raising is the important 
part of Mandela's U.S. visit. Perhaps our hard-earned money could be put to 
better use.

NELSON MANDELA'S CONTROVERSIAL TIES TO ARAFAT, KADAFI AND CASTRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hearing Mandela state that he feels a "kinship" with Castro, Kadafi and Arafat 
because they have supported the anti-apartheid movement makes me wonder if one 
could extend the same logic to expect a connection with Hitler, Stalin or 
Attila the Hun, as long as they met the needed criterion. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela appears to be a man of extraordinary intelligence and dignity. 
</P>
<P>
I would ask him to consider what kind of relationship the new (post-apartheid) 
South Africa will have with the likes of Arafat, Castro or Kadafi. He will be 
beholden to proven liars, violators of human rights and proponents of every 
anti-democratic dogma. 
</P>
<P>
There is an adage that Mandela would do well to remember: "He who lies down 
with dogs, wakes up with fleas!"

Mandela is quoted as defending his friendship with Arafat, Libya's Moammar 
Kadafi and Cuba's Fidel Castro by saying: "There is no reason whatsoever that 
we should have reservations about their attitude toward human rights in their 
own country -- we have no time to look into the internal affairs of another 
country" (Part A, June 22). 
</P>
<P>
In that case, why does he expect the U.S. to do just that, and to impose 
sanctions against the government of South Africa? I guess he would have 
accepted support from Hitler, Stalin and Idi Amin, Somoza and Duvalier.

SCHOOLS GO BACK TO BASICS: NO GUNS; 
</P>
<P>
IMPOSSIBLE TO OVERESTIMATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE AUTOMATIC EXPULSION DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 610,000 students attend public schools in Los Angeles. The hard-working 
majority of them arrive on campus carrying only a desire to learn; a tiny 
minority of their classmates come bearing guns and knives. 
</P>
<P>
Determined to end this intolerable arms race, the Board of Education has 
toughened the district's discipline policy. It voted to expel automatically 
students who bring guns onto the campuses of junior or senior high schools. 
This new policy puts all students and parents on appropriate notice: Bring a 
gun to school, and you're through. 
</P>
<P>
The district also will expel students who assault other youngsters in a way 
likely to cause grave injury. That guideline should reassure worried parents, 
and reduce the unacceptable level of violence on campuses. 
</P>
<P>
The board acted on the advice of member Julie Korenstein, who has taken the 
lead on this controversial issue. She set up a community task force to address 
campus violence after a ninth-grade student stabbed his English teacher at a 
junior high school in the San Fernando Valley last year. Unfortunately, that 
assault was not an isolated incident. 
</P>
<P>
The sad fact is that youngsters are bringing more than pens and pencils to 
school. During the past school year, more than 400 students were considered for 
expulsion because they brought weapons and other dangerous objects, including 
explosives, to school. The reports of gun possession and assaults with other 
weapons have risen dramatically in the last four years. This dangerous trend 
must be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
After collecting frightening statistics, Korenstein's School Safety and 
Security Task Force recommended stricter disciplinary policies, coupled with 
stronger preventive programs and new alternatives for problem students. Those 
recommendations balanced the security needs of well-behaved students and the 
special needs of troubled students. Unfortunately, the district's budget woes 
preclude much greater funding for special programs. 
</P>
<P>
The board did retain the authority to review expulsions. The reviews should 
focus on cases with extenuating circumstances, such as students who bring Boy 
Scout knives to school or youngsters who bring weapons for protection against 
gangs or bullies. A few compassionate exceptions, but only a few, will be in 
order. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Board of Education, finally moving to get guns off of every 
campus, is to be congratulated for making that message unmistakably clear.

HELP IRAN TURN BACK TOWARD THE WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIREEN T. HUNTER, Shireen T. Hunter is deputy director of the Middle East 
Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
While Iran digs itself out of the rubble of the Persian Gulf War, it has been 
hit again. The fury of Mother Nature has caused even more devastation than that 
wrought by bombs and rockets. In terms of destruction and loss of life, Iran's 
earthquake also surpasses the similar tragedy that befell Armenia three years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Iran's political isolation, the international community has responded 
to its plea for aid. Yet the response so far is far short of the enormous needs 
of the nearly 2 million people left homeless. Indeed, it has fallen far short 
of aid given to Armenia in the same amount of time. This may be explained by 
politics: Iran's continued role as pariah state. 
</P>
<P>
That very fact offers an opportunity, however. Iran's current plight and the 
outside world's response could become a political turning point in Iran's 
domestic politics and relations with the outside world, especially the West and 
the Arab states of the region. Aiding Iran now also would be a wise business 
move, building goodwill, for Western firms. 
</P>
<P>
Iran's moderates, including President Hashemi Rafsanjani, have taken a serious 
political gamble by asking for and accepting all aid. Indeed, the argument that 
they have made for the past two years -- that Iran cannot rebuild itself 
without outside help -- has been vehemently rejected by the radicals. The 
moderates' efforts have also been hampered by the West's cool response, which 
is based on the proposition that all outstanding political problems with Iran 
must first be resolved. This attitude actually weakens the very forces in 
Iranian politics that are necessary for resolving these problems. 
</P>
<P>
For the West to respond inadequately to Iranian needs at this critical juncture 
would have even worse consequences for the balance of political power in Iran. 
The radicals, who fear that this disaster may provide an excuse for Iran to 
open up to the outside world, have already been vociferously attacking the idea 
of Western aid in hopes of discouraging it. If the West plays into their hands, 
it will convince most Iranians that an effort to open up Iranian society to 
outside influences and an accommodating attitude will bring few benefits. The 
upshot would be to make them even more withdrawn, xenophobic and radical. 
</P>
<P>
This is a crucial moment for the West to show that it does not bear ill will 
toward Iran. Such a positive attitude and generous response to Iran's tragedy 
could pay significant political and economic dividends. It would go a long way 
toward blunting Iranian memories of Western help to Iraq. It would also prove 
that there are benefits to be gained for Iran from good relations with the 
West. This opportunity to close the book on the past should not be missed.

GEORGE BUSH'S TURN TO BE SUCKERED; 
</P>
<P>
IT'S EASY TO SEE WHAT THE PRESIDENT LOST; HARDER TO SEE WHAT HIS FLIPFLOP ON 
TAXES GAINED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"George Wallace was right," the conservative commentator Patrick J. Buchanan 
said Wednesday on ABC-TV's "Good Morning America." "There isn't a dime's worth 
of difference between the parties." Later that morning he told me that George 
Bush's U-turn on taxes made no sense, "politically, philosophically or 
economically." At the 1988 Republican convention, Bush said: "Read my lips." 
Now he is saying: "New tax revenues." 
</P>
<P>
"He has broken his most solemn compact with the American people," Buchanan 
said. "He is surrendering the defining difference between the political 
parties. And for what?" Buchanan is right. It makes no sense. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has contrived both to look irresolute and to yield an important principle 
(constraining the growth of the federal government by denying it new revenues). 
He is unlikely to gain anything substantive in return. Earlier budget "deals" 
have shown that congressional negotiators are unable to deliver when the 
appropriations bills are voted on later in the year. Congress is too 
decentralized an institution to permit the necessary discipline. The spending 
cuts turn out to be illusory. But the tax increases are eagerly written into 
law. Ronald Reagan was suckered two or three times this way. Now it's Bush's 
turn. 
</P>
<P>
In practice, there may not be much real fiscal change as a result of Bush's 
ill-advised concession. The carefully worded statement listed a package of 
changes, all of which were said to be necessary. Among them were "discretionary 
spending reductions," "entitlement and mandatory program reform" and "growth 
incentives." The latter is understood to mean a lower capital-gains tax rate. 
If this indeed were to materialize in the weeks ahead, a few sin taxes would be 
a small price to pay. But the immediate 30-point stock-market rise, followed by 
a fall back to a small net loss on the Dow later in the day, suggested a market 
perception that not much change in the tax law is likely to result. The 
Democrats will resist entitlement reform and will push hard for higher 
income-tax rates at upper-income levels and the package is likely to come 
unglued. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Bush will have dealt his own constituency a real blow. The 
newspapers, it turns out, have been keeping a file on Bush's earlier statements 
on not raising taxes and these were gleefully itemized all over the country 
Wednesday. Bush's supporters can only be disheartened. It's easy to see what 
Bush has lost; harder to see what he has gained beyond the affection of those 
who enjoy government subsidies and otherwise live at the public's expense. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats lost no time in taking advantage of the situation. "I'm chairman 
of the campaign committee and we'll make it a political issue," said Rep. Beryl 
F. Anthony Jr. (D-Ark.) about Bush's switch. Others stood in front the cameras 
and virtuously promised not to engage in finger-pointing just because the 
President had broken his most important campaign promise, thereby pointing the 
finger, while slyly gaining Brownie points as team players. One can hardly 
blame them. Who does Bush think he is dealing with? The membership committee of 
the Greenwich Country Club? 
</P>
<P>
Washington has been thirsting for new taxes ever since Bush was elected. For 
decades, tax revenues flowed into the capital almost without anyone having to 
vote yea on a tax bill. Inflation combined with the progressive tax code to do 
the job by stealth, moving the middle class into tax brackets designed for the 
wealthy. All through the 1970s, inflation gave us non-legislated tax increases. 
Washington could hardly devise programs quickly enough to cope with the revenue 
gusher. 
</P>
<P>
Today revenues are no longer increasing, economic growth is minimal and there 
is no more bracket creep (there are only two income-tax brackets, and the line 
dividing them is indexed to inflation). For the first time in ages, Congress 
must vote explicitly for higher taxes. 
</P>
<P>
A President who vows to oppose any such move can almost certainly stop it. Bush 
held out for a while but now he seems to have declared his willingness to "go 
native." He didn't have to do it. The Gramm-Rudman law, devised in the mid-'80s 
to cope with the budget deficit, would automatically cut spending anyway. The 
White House has to do precisely nothing. The cuts occur by a process called the 
"sequester." President Reagan feared using it because it would cut defense 
spending. But with the Warsaw Pact collapsing, Congress is now inclined to cut 
the defense budget even more than Gramm-Rudman would. So conservatives have 
nothing to fear from Gramm-Rudman. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, like Reagan before him, seems to have succumbed to the desire to be 
popular inside the Beltway. At least Reagan waited until his second term.

CHARGES FILED IN SLAYINGS OF 2 MEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Drug and accessory-to-murder charges were filed Wednesday against a man 
allegedly involved in the shooting deaths of two men during a drug theft at a 
Pacoima house, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Rosales, 36, formerly of Pacoima, was arrested Monday in Visalia where he 
had apparently moved after the double slaying June 4, Detective Al Ferrand 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rosales is expected to be arraigned today in San Fernando Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe Rosales was with several suspects who allegedly gunned down 
Gonzalo Millan, 27, and Plutarco Pineda, 26, both of the Santa Ana area, after 
they arrived at a house in the 11800 block of Phillippi Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The residents of the house, who found the bodies when they returned home, have 
told investigators that they did not know the victims or why they had come to 
the house. Ferrand said detectives are investigating whether there was any 
relationship between the residents, the victims or the suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence from the double slaying and information about the victims led 
investigators to Rosales, Ferrand said. Rosales was charged with being an 
accessory to murder and trafficking in narcotics, Ferrand said. 
</P>
<P>
The victims were part of an Orange County drug ring and were killed in an 
apparent drug rip-off scheme involving members of a Pacoima drug ring, Ferrand 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He declined to give further details. 
</P>
<P>
He said investigators are unsure how many other suspects were involved in the 
shooting.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PUBLIC URGED TO CUT WATER USE 10% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing the continuing drought in California, the Torrance City Council on 
Tuesday passed a resolution declaring a water shortage and urging water users 
to voluntarily reduce consumption by 10%. The resolution also called for a 
public information campaign to encourage water conservation. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, which is similar to one approved two years ago, asks residents to 
take such steps as checking faucets for leaks, installing low-flow plumbing 
devices and adjusting sprinklers to avoid waste. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a reaffirmation of our stand," said Councilwoman Dee Hardison. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Dan Walker objected to an item in the resolution urging restaurants 
not to serve drinking water unless the customer requests it. He agreed with the 
other items, he said. 
</P>
<P>
If the four-year drought continues, municipal officials said, the city may have 
to look at mandatory reductions and penalties for those violating conservation 
guidelines.

TORRANCE PLEDGES TO GO AHEAD ON ARTS CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH, IMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Torrance city officials say that construction of the cultural arts center will 
proceed as planned, after a judge denied a lawsuit attempting to block the 
$12.2-million project. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling "allows us to maintain our construction schedule. We were fearful 
we'd be set back," said Gene G. Barnett, city parks and recreation director. 
</P>
<P>
But the man who brought the unsuccessful lawsuit, developer Jerry Conrow, says 
he may appeal last Friday's decision by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge David 
P. Yaffe. 
</P>
<P>
Conrow said he remains convinced the city did not adequately study how the new 
center -- now being built at the Torrance Civic Center on Torrance Boulevard -- 
will strain parking in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"The city has been derelict as far as parking," Conrow said. "The whole thrust 
of what I was trying to do was to look down the road five years, eight years, 
and say, 'This is going to be a mess.' " 
</P>
<P>
Conrow's lawsuit charged that the city should have conducted an environmental 
impact report for the project. The lawsuit was filed March 26, a few weeks 
after construction began on the 63,700-square-foot arts complex. 
</P>
<P>
The city countered that the complex had been discussed at public meetings over 
two years, and that Conrow could have complained before construction started. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Yaffe agreed that Conrow could have acted earlier, according to Conrow 
and a lawyer for the city. 
</P>
<P>
"In effect, what he said was, 'You had your chance to complain but didn't,' " 
said Ralph H. Nutter, a Los Angeles lawyer representing Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
The city is in the process of increasing parking around the Civic Center, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The area, which has slightly more than 1,100 parking spaces, will have 1,400 
when the arts center is completed, said Philip Tilden, capital projects 
administrator for the city. The city has also made arrangements with Epson 
America to use some of the company's nearby parking spaces at night and on 
weekends for arts center events. 
</P>
<P>
The center is slated for completion in late 1991. It will consist of four 
buildings, including a 497-seat theater, meeting halls, arts and crafts 
studios, dance studios and a children's art room.

CHILD APPEARS OK AFTER 20-FOOT FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 18-month-old child fell 20 feet from a two-story window Wednesday in the 
Midway area but appeared to be uninjured, police reported. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Steven York Jr. was standing on his bed near the window at 10:30 a.m., 
lost his balance and popped out the window screen as he fell, said police 
spokesman Bill Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
The youngster, who lives in naval housing in the 3200 block of Bradman Drive, 
fell on his shoulder and upper back but stood up immediately after the 
accident, Robinson said. He was taken to Children's Hospital for observation. 
</P>
<P>
The child's father, Gregory Steven York Sr., 26, told police he had checked on 
the child a few minutes before and found him sleeping.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
THE DEATH OF OFFICER DE LA ROSA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At 43, veteran Officer Tommy De La Rosa of the Fullerton Police Department was 
working in top form. Then in a flicker of gunfire during a drug sting operation 
last week, his life ended. This week, with his family and the law-enforcement 
community, Orange County mourns. 
</P>
<P>
De La Rosa had worked several years in undercover narcotics, and had been 
honored by the Orange County Latino Peace Officers Assn. last year as "Officer 
of the Year." He was so committed to the cause that he spent time off visiting 
city parks, where he urged youngsters to stay in school and to avoid the ugly 
drug world of errant elders. 
</P>
<P>
The death of a police officer in the line of duty is a shock for any community, 
and in Orange County, where countless automobile bumper stickers plead the case 
for a drug-free environment, the first shooting death of a police officer in 
the war on drugs carries grim significance. Orange County has proudly joined 
local, state and federal law-enforcement agencies in the cause. The realization 
that death stalks the good and the bad with equal uncertainty brings home to 
all the terrible injustice and absurdity of the drug culture. 
</P>
<P>
Over the period of time that De La Rosa worked undercover, the Regional 
Narcotics Suppression Program in the county was hailed by the FBI as one of the 
most effective in the nation. A cruel irony is that the better an officer like 
De La Rosa gets as that kind of cooperative effort takes shape and direction, 
and the more experience and contacts he has to dive deep into the nether world, 
the more he is at risk. 
</P>
<P>
This is what law-enforcement officers across the nation have been lamenting. 
Some of their best and the brightest have fallen in a war they are not winning. 
National statistics underline the problem: The number of police officers killed 
on drug-related duty in any given year doubled in 1988 from the 1972 total, 
according to a study done by the Washington-based Crime Control Institute. 
</P>
<P>
In the senseless slaughter of drug-related violence, De La Rosa was another of 
the good to die at high tide. Thousands of officers turned out for his funeral, 
but it was fitting, too, that so many civilians paused by the side of the road 
in 102-degree heat to reflect on the perils of police work in an area where 
life is cheap.

GOLF IS NOT THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN; 
</P>
<P>
TO ENJOY THE BENEFITS OF A GOLF COURSE, YOU HAVE TO BE A GOLFER. JOGGERS, 
EQUESTRIANS AND OTHERS DESERVE CONSIDERATION TOO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Four years ago, I made a pilgrimage to St. Andrews, Scotland, and played a 
round of golf on the famous Old Course. The green fee was 15 pounds, the 
equivalent at that time of about $22. About 25 cents a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
I told my playing partner for the day, a professor of mathematics at the 
University of St. Andrews, that I was surprised not only by the reasonableness 
of the green fee, but also by the fact that it was so easy to get on the course 
in the first place (I had waited no more than 15 minutes). This was, after all, 
the Old Course, the first golf course, the sport's Mecca, the home of Young Tom 
Morris and the British Open and the Royal and Ancient Golf Club. It is the 
Valhalla of the golf gods. 
</P>
<P>
The professor looked amused. It would always be that way, he said, because 
according to the laws of the borough of St. Andrews, the Old Course is to 
remain strictly a public course, open to any and all, at affordable fees, in 
perpetuity. 
</P>
<P>
I considered selling my return plane ticket and staying. For just a couple of 
bucks more than the green fee at my local municipal track, I could play the Old 
Course. Forever. And, with the exceptions of minor periodic adjustments for the 
cost of living, no one would ever zing me with aberrations like mandatory golf 
cart fees (the Old Course is doggedly unmechanized), increases to cover the 
cost of a course remodeling job (absolute sacrilege) or news that the Japanese 
had bought the place and had decided to make it private. 
</P>
<P>
Would there were more courses like that at home in Orange County, where playing 
a simple round of golf is getting to be quite a chore. Yes, there are lots of 
public courses in the county, nearly 25 of them, but there also are more and 
more golfers -- the former tennis-and-racquetball-playing professional set has 
discovered that you can actually transact business while putting. 
</P>
<P>
The lower-priced courses are often hopelessly backed up -- most of the starting 
times having been reserved a week in advance -- and the newer ones are not much 
better and are expensive besides. (One of the newest, the Tustin Ranch Golf 
Club, levies a $60 weekend green fee. That includes a mandatory golf cart -- an 
increasingly common custom intended to speed up play. The elegant Links at 
Monarch Beach offers the same weekend package for $75.) 
</P>
<P>
The people who run the public courses will say the throngs of people paying to 
play or the high green fees are necessary to maintain the courses, that you 
either must cram the course with players all day long or limit the number of 
foursomes and simply charge more money. And they are probably right. 
</P>
<P>
The reflexive solution would be to simply build a few more courses. Golfers are 
quick to point out the beauty, tranquillity and other environmental advantages 
of large tracts of open green space, and they will rhapsodize about facing new 
challenges on new links. 
</P>
<P>
But a group of Huntington Beach residents has revealed one flaw in that 
scenario that bears some consideration: In order to enjoy the benefits of a 
golf course, you have to be a golfer. 
</P>
<P>
The group, which calls itself Save Our Parks, began an initiative drive late 
last year in an attempt to, among other things, prevent the development of 105 
acres of the city's Central Park as an 18-hole golf course. They argued that 
the city's residents should decide how the land should be used, and they 
pointed out that the acreage was already used by joggers, equestrians, bird 
watchers and high school cross-country runners. 
</P>
<P>
Is a golf course a beneficial use of land? For the most part, yes. Properly 
designed, golf courses follow the natural contours of the landscape, and, when 
mature, tend to enhance its beauty rather than mar it, as some critics claim 
that they do. 
</P>
<P>
Given a choice of a golf course or an industrial park for a piece of 
undeveloped land, most people would prefer greens to machines. Golf courses 
are, in fact, less like playing fields and more like huge gardens, and 
conscientious golfers, whether they are aware of it or not, are 
environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
They should not, however, be usurpers. Golf is a magnificent game, but it is 
not the only game. The same stretch of land -- public land -- that would make a 
perfect par-5 fairway might also be ideal for early morning runs or horseback 
riding or kite flying or picnics. Golfers should not, and would not want to be, 
cast in the role of the schoolyard bully who kicks the smaller fry off the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
The people of St. Andrews -- and the golfers of the world -- know they will 
never lose their cherished Old Course to a shopping center. By the same token, 
public parkland should not be restricted to a single use without the consent of 
all whom that land is intended to benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Such action is considerate and it is fair play -- two things every true golfer 
holds inviolate.

WEST TORRANCE HIGH FOOTBALL FORTUNES SACKED FOR A BIG LOSS; 
</P>
<P>
PREPS: ALL-OCEAN LEAGUE QUARTERBACK JOHN WALSH PLANS TO TRANSFER TO CARSON FOR 
SENIOR SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The dejected look on John Black's face this week mirrored the mood of the West 
Torrance High football team. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in shock," said the West co-coach, shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
Black and his partner, Mark Knox, were still trying to come to grips with the 
loss of John Walsh, the Warriors' All-Ocean League quarterback. The West 
coaches learned Monday that Walsh, one of the South Bay's top players, plans to 
transfer to Carson High for his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't sleep (Monday) night," Black said. "Mark and I are just devastated 
by this." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh and his father, also named John, refused to comment on the report, saying 
it was only a rumor. But the West coaches said they were informed by the 
Walshes that the quarterback will transfer to Carson, where he hopes to improve 
his chance of being recruited by a major college. 
</P>
<P>
"(Walsh Sr.) feels that John will get more exposure at Carson and build up 
better stats," Knox said. "I hope it works out for him. He's sacrificed quite a 
bit. He's alienated all of his friends on the team." 
</P>
<P>
The 6-3, 190-pound Walsh passed for 1,700 yards and 17 touchdowns last season, 
helping West to a 10-2 record, the Ocean League title and the second round of 
the Southern Section Division VII playoffs. During three seasons on the West 
freshman, sophomore and varsity squads, his teams were 27-3. 
</P>
<P>
The situation is similar to one in 1988, when All-L.A. City quarterback Perry 
Klein transferred from Palisades High to Carson for his senior season and 
helped the Colts to the 4-A Division title. Like Klein, Walsh receives 
one-on-one coaching from Steve Clarkson, a former Carson assistant coach who 
works with several of the Southland's premier quarterbacks, including Todd 
Marinovich of USC. 
</P>
<P>
"It's Perry Klein all over again," said a disgusted David Snakenborg, a senior 
tight end and linebacker for West. 
</P>
<P>
The West co-coaches said they believe Clarkson used his influence as a personal 
coach to persuade Walsh to transfer. Clarkson, who was a member of the Carson 
coaching staff for one season in 1988, denied the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't make decisions for people," he said. "I'm sure they are hurt (at West) 
and looking for someone to blame. But that's not my business. All I do is teach 
technical skills. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of ridiculous. People have been transferring in and out of Carson 
for years, but the only time it seems to be an issue is when it's a 
quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
Carson Coach Gene Vollnogle said he has not talked to the Walshes, but 
confirmed that Walsh Sr. met with Carson Assistant Principal Dick Mattingly 
last month about the possibility of his son's transferring to the school. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted to know the legality of his son transferring if he gets a separation 
from his wife," said Vollnogle, who will retire after the 1990 season. "Dr. 
Mattingly said he would not accept a separation, but he did say that if divorce 
papers were filed and the father and son moved into the district, (Walsh) would 
be eligible. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing depends if the parents split up. They have to file the papers 
and go through the courts to get it done. Once that's done, what can you do? 
This kind of stuff goes on all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Knox, however, said that West plans to launch an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"It might look like sour grapes when we start pointing fingers, but we're 
definitely going to look into the Carson situation because I don't think they 
are totally innocent," he said. "We're not out to get John, but we're going to 
look into the actions of representatives of the Carson program." 
</P>
<P>
The situation is stirring the same emotions as two years ago, when Klein 
transferred to Carson after a record-breaking junior season at Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
The Kleins, who live in Malibu, rented an apartment in Carson, presumably so 
Danny Klein, Perry's father, could live closer to his surplus electronics 
business in Gardena during the week. After the football season, though, the 
family gave up the apartment and Klein transferred to Santa Monica High. 
</P>
<P>
Klein, a redshirt freshman at UC Berkeley, answered the phone at Clarkson's 
Laguna Hills home Tuesday. He said Walsh has a good chance of becoming Carson's 
starting quarterback because the player being groomed for the job, Tarriel 
Hopper, is better suited to play strong safety, the position he played last 
season. The Colts were L.A. City 4-A runners-up in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were (Walsh), I would like to be in his situation," Klein said. "He will 
be the only guy. He'll be able to rack up a lot of statistics. I don't think 
Hopper wants to play quarterback. I just think he's playing it because there's 
no other quarterbacks at Carson. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been working out at Carson and Tarriel is there sometimes. He's all 
right. He's a good quarterback. But I don't think that's what he's going to 
play in college." 
</P>
<P>
Vollnogle and Clarkson, though, said they are pleased with the progress of 
Hopper, a 6-3, 210-pound senior whose older brother, Darrel, was a standout at 
Carson and USC. Hopper also receives personalized coaching from Clarkson. 
</P>
<P>
The area where Walsh has a clear advantage over Hopper is experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen him throw the ball and he's very, very good," said Vollnogle, who 
has watched Walsh play in passing-league games. "He has experience, too. He's 
not someone brand new." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Walsh will become Carson's quarterback if he transfers, Vollnogle 
said: "He could be." 
</P>
<P>
While players have transferred to Carson for many years, the loss of a 
high-profile player at West is regarded as a unique occurrence. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lost kids who have legitimately moved, but this is definitely the first 
time for this," Knox said. "We've had a lot of kids who tried to get into West 
that we couldn't take. We've never had anybody leave like this." 
</P>
<P>
Knox said West's players were angered by the news. 
</P>
<P>
"They're very bitter," he said. "They're shocked like we were. They've been a 
real close group for three years. A lot of them have played Pop Warner 
together. It's not only a hard pill for the program, but it's probably put a 
dent in a lot of friendships." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, who last played with West Sunday in the L.A. Games, had assumed the role 
of team captain in spring football and was expected to be the leader of a 
Warrior team considered a favorite for the 1990 Pioneer League title. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh will be replaced at quarterback by Steve Sarkisian, a 6-0, 175-pound 
junior who led the sophomore team to an 8-1 record last season. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still going to be a winner," Knox said. "We're just starting way behind 
because we thought John was going to be our quarterback. But we'll be OK. We'll 
still give people headaches." 
</P>
<P>
This week, though, West was feeling all the pain.

BURBANK GYMNAST STELTER STICKS TO HIS DREAM OF QUALIFYING FOR THE OLYMPIC TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Asmattering of tiny holes -- the result of an addiction to darts -- speckled a 
wall of Bob Stelter's dormitory room. The damage was duly noted by University 
of Nebraska authorities and Stelter was charged a nominal fee for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
That episode, which occurred four years ago, just about covers the extent of 
Stelter's college shenanigans. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of nursing post-party headaches, Stelter, an All-American gymnast from 
Burbank, uses Saturday mornings to hone his routines. He doesn't hang out in 
bars, he hangs from them. Although Stelter exhausted his collegiate eligibility 
this season, he still trains with the Cornhuskers and hopes to make the 1992 
U.S. Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just an all-around good boy," Nebraska Coach Francis Allen said. "It's 
nice when you've got to look at a guy every damn day and he's got a smile on 
his face." 
</P>
<P>
But even model citizens can be defiant. Stelter, for instance, pays little heed 
to gravity. Teammates nicknamed him "Air Bob," in reference to his leaping 
ability. Stelter is trying to perfect a phenomenal move called a "double 
double," a double back flip with two 360-degree twists. He has executed the 
trick in practice and once in competition. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, Air Bob made the most of some air time. Despite nagging 
tendinitis in both shoulders, Stelter scored a 9.875 to win the floor event 
title in the nationally televised U.S. Gymnastic Federation championships in 
Denver. He finished 13th in the all-around competition, however, barely missing 
a berth on the Senior National team, composed of the top 12 finishers. He 
placed 15th in the USGF championships last year. 
</P>
<P>
Stelter, a 1986 Burroughs High graduate, placed fourth in the all-around in the 
1989 and '90 NCAA championships. The top six finishers are named All-Americans. 
He was also an All-American in the vault as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify for the Olympic Trials, Stelter must secure a berth on the Senior 
National team. He will have another chance to make the squad at the Winter 
Nationals in early December. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't expecting to make the team," Stelter said after the recent 
competition. "You can't really expect to be a shoo-in." 
</P>
<P>
Stelter might modestly point out his limitations, but others have the utmost 
confidence in his abilities. International Gymnast magazine named him the MVP 
of Nebraska's NCAA championship team this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I would almost have to say that Bob is really going to do something," Allen 
said. "You're going to see him in the top six or eight at Winter Nationals." 
</P>
<P>
Allen knows that rapid, dramatic improvements are within Stelter's reach. Five 
years on the Junior National team had polished Stelter's tumbling skills, but, 
when he arrived at Nebraska, he was relatively green on the pommel horse, a 
favorite event of Allen's. Stelter didn't concentrate much on the event while 
at Burroughs and his muscular legs appeared to be too heavy to lug through a 
routine. 
</P>
<P>
"When you line gymnasts up, you look at their bodies and say he can do the 
pommel horse, he can't," Allen said. "(Bob's the type) who falls in the can't 
category." 
</P>
<P>
Once again, Stelter was defiant. He concentrated on making strides in the event 
and did. 
</P>
<P>
"When I watched the guys every day, it helped tremendously," he said. This 
season, Stelter -- heavy legs and all -- and two Cornhusker teammates were 
among the top six collegiate gymnasts in the pommel horse. 
</P>
<P>
In the working world, Stelter might be considered the consummate company man, 
diligent to a fault. His workouts are extensive and organized. Sure, he twice 
has narrowly missed making the Senior National team, but it has not doused his 
dedication. 
</P>
<P>
"He is such a team player," former Junior National and Nebraska teammate 
Patrick Kirksey said. "We know he's got to be extremely frustrated but he 
continues to come into the gym and work out really hard. All these setbacks 
don't daunt his dream of making the Olympic team. He's very silent and stoic 
about his frustrations." 
</P>
<P>
Kirksey and Stelter, roommates as freshmen, are close friends who had similar 
successes at Nebraska. But unlike Stelter, Kirksey has cracked the inner circle 
of the gymnastic elite. That was accomplished with a third-place performance in 
the 1988 Winter National meet. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Kirksey has enjoyed celebrity status among gymnastic aficionados. 
He garnered even more attention as a member of the U.S. team that competed in 
the 1989 world championships. 
</P>
<P>
Stelter, Kirksey said, is talented enough to share the spotlight. Instead, he 
toils in relative anonymity, in the periphery of the elite. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why Bob is not in there with me because I think that he and I are 
very equal in our gymnastics potential," Kirksey said. "He's an extremely 
talented gymnast. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like this has happened to Bob a lot. He has been on the cutting edge 
of being a prominent gymnast, being in the public eye." 
</P>
<P>
Stelter said he is not distressed or unduly frustrated by the situation. "I 
don't let it bother me that much," he said. "If I did, then I'd probably just 
throw in the towel." 
</P>
<P>
Although Stelter had planned to attend UCLA since childhood, he was not offered 
one of two available scholarships. Bruin Coach Art Shurlock concedes that he 
probably underestimated Stelter. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew he was going to be outstanding on floor exercise and vaulting but I 
didn't know he'd go as far in other events," Shurlock said. 
</P>
<P>
Stelter received offers from several schools, including Iowa, Minnesota, and 
Arizona, but he became sold on Nebraska after a recruiting trip to Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
"I considered Nebraska but it wasn't my highest choice," he said. "By the time 
I left, I just went through a complete reversal. There was a lot of good team 
spirit and all the people are real supportive. After that trip, I told my dad 
that even if the coach from UCLA had called and offered me a full ride, I 
wouldn't have accepted it." 
</P>
<P>
Although he enjoys the rural surroundings in Lincoln, Stelter still does his 
share of California dreaming. The walls of his duplex reflect his infatuation 
with Corvettes. When he's back in Los Angeles, he spends the bulk of his time 
basking in the sun and deep-sea fishing. Then there is his budding film career. 
Working as a stuntman, Stelter earned $300 for a flip in "Twilight Zone: The 
Movie." 
</P>
<P>
But he knows his path to recognition doesn't run through Hollywood. He's 
concerned with the Senior National team. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you get on the team, you've accomplished the hardest part," he said. 
"You've established a reputation for yourself. People know who you are and what 
you can do."

SECOND CHANCE ALL WI NEEDS TO CHARGE INTO QUARTERFINALS; 
</P>
<P>
GOLF: WESTLAKE HIGH GRADUATE, WHO WON LATE ENTRY INTO CALIFORNIA AMATEUR 
CHAMPIONSHIP, ADVANCES WITH VAN NUYS' STEINBERG AND OXNARD'S STANKOWSKI. 
</P>

Charlie Wi, an 18-year-old from Thousand Oaks who missed qualifying for the 
79th California Amateur golf championship by one stroke and only sneaked into 
the event when another player withdrew, crashed his way into the quarterfinals 
of the tournament with a pair of match-play victories Wednesday at Pebble Beach 
on the Monterey Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Wi, who graduated from Westlake High this month, joined Craig Steinberg of Van 
Nuys and Paul Stankowski of Oxnard in the eight-man field remaining from the 
starting field of 102 of the state's best amateur golfers. 
</P>
<P>
Wi qualified for match play by coming back with a blistering 68 -- the 
second-lowest score in the tournament -- Tuesday after struggling to a 75 in 
Monday's opening round. He finished as the No. 3 qualifier, a stroke behind 
Stankowski and Mark Johnson of Barstow. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning, Wi defeated Mitch Harrison of Campo, 1-up, in the first 
round of match play. In the afternoon, he beat Randy Bridge of Hollister by the 
same score. 
</P>
<P>
Wi nearly didn't make the tournament at all. On May 16, he was forced into a 
13-man playoff for the final tournament berth during qualifying at the Los 
Serranos Country Club in Chino. He parred the first playoff hole and birdied 
the second, leaving him and Ray Navis of Solana Beach to battle for the last 
position. 
</P>
<P>
And on the fourth hole, Navis sank a long birdie putt to defeat Wi. He became 
the first alternate for the state tournament, an event noted for having few 
withdrawals. 
</P>
<P>
But just a week before the tournament began, Phil Mickelson of Arizona State, 
who had received an exemption into the state amateur because he won the NCAA 
championship, withdrew so he could attend a collegiate awards banquet in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg, 32, an optometrist who made it to the quarterfinals in 1988 and 1989 
and to the semifinals in 1982, returned to the quarterfinals by defeating Ducky 
O'Toole of Carmel, 3 and 2, in the morning's opening round of match play and 
then beating Javier Sanchez of Redwood City in the second round, 5 and 3. 
</P>
<P>
Stankowski defeated defending champion Casey Boyns of Pacific Grove, 4 and 3, 
in the opening round of match play and defeated Dave Berganio Jr. of Granada 
Hills in the second round. Stankowski, a Texas El Paso student, tied for top 
stroke-play honors, firing a 73 Monday and a 69 Tuesday for a 142 to lead the 
field of 32 golfers into match play. Days before the tournament began, he 
predicted he would win. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't play at all if I didn't think I had a chance to be around on the 
final day to win it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stankowski never had played in the state amateur because his collegiate 
tournaments prevented him from entering the state tournament qualifying events. 
But his victory last summer in the Southern California Amateur Championship 
brought an automatic exemption into the 1990 state amateur. 
</P>
<P>
In first-round match play Wednesday morning, George Gottschalk of Lancaster was 
defeated, 4 and 2, by Ron Ewing of Merced; Chris Zambri of Thousand Oaks lost 
to Ben Furth of San Francisco, 3 and 2; and Paul Holtby of Simi Valley lost on 
the 21st hole to Sandy Galbraith of Fountain Valley. Galbraith, 44, was the 
tournament runner-up in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
Gottschalk, 34, was playing in the state amateur for the second time. Last year 
he did not advance past the first two rounds of stroke play. 
</P>
<P>
Holtby, 23, a four-year player at Simi Valley High and at UC Santa Barbara, 
said the state tournament was his last event as an amateur. He plans to turn 
pro July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Etue of Thousand Oaks shot rounds of 75 and 79 and missed the match-play 
cut by two strokes. Kevin Eden of Granada Hills also missed the cut by two 
strokes after rounds of 81 and 73. And Jim Netto of Glendale (81, 77) missed 
the cut by six shots.

NEW LEAGUE MAKES HIT WITH PLAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART MATTHEWS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Anderson and Tim Ammentorp heard the voices at the about the same time last 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
There were hundreds of high school baseball players in the South Bay area who 
needed a place to play in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
If you build the league, they will come . . . 
</P>
<P>
So Anderson and Ammentorp organized a baseball league and called it the South 
Bay Summer League. 
</P>
<P>
And the players came. In droves. 
</P>
<P>
"At first it started out as kind of a word-of-mouth thing," said Anderson, the 
coach at Bishop Montgomery High. "We called a few guys up on the phone to see 
if they liked the idea." 
</P>
<P>
They did. Eight South Bay high school coaches -- including Ammentorp, who 
coaches at Redondo -- responded by entering teams of returning players. No 
graduated seniors would be eligible to play. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa entered. So did North and West Torrance, Westchester and Chadwick 
School. Miraleste entered but withdrew because of conflicts with summer 
football passing leagues. 
</P>
<P>
It has gotten to the point that Anderson, who secured umpires and insurance for 
the league and drew up schedules, has had to turn down some schools -- 
including Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"We almost got too big," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Roughly modeled after a Culver City league that shut down last summer, the 
league gives middle-echelon players -- those who don't receive invitations to 
play for Connie Mack teams in San Pedro and Long Beach -- an opportunity to get 
in some summer action with teammates from the same school. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the coaches want to develop next year's teams," Anderson said. "They 
want to know who is going to be able to fill the spots left by the graduating 
seniors." 
</P>
<P>
As in American Legion baseball, the teams are aligned by school. But many 
schools are turned away by American Legion for lack of space, so the new league 
gives those schools some summer league experience. 
</P>
<P>
And unlike American Legion, no graduated seniors or college freshmen are 
allowed to play. 
</P>
<P>
For several years, El Segundo Coach John Stevenson has operated two American 
Legion teams -- one for top-notch competition and one for youth development. 
Torrance, South Torrance, Rolling Hills, Palos Verdes, and St. Bernard also run 
legion teams. 
</P>
<P>
With the new South Bay Summer League, things are a lot less crowded around 
American Legion. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a chance for us to get in some games against the teams in the area 
without facing stacked teams," Ammentorp said. "This way we can develop our 
younger guys without having them being overpowered by incredible pitching. Plus 
there are a lot of things that come up in ballgames that you can't anticipate 
on the practice field." 
</P>
<P>
There is one exception to the no-seniors rule. When Miraleste withdrew from the 
eight-team league, Anderson accepted a free-lance team called the South Bay 
Dodgers to fill the spot. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers, coached by former Bishop Montgomery assistant Pop Ivanovsky, 
appear to be the class of the league with their mix of high school players and 
graduates. 
</P>
<P>
"They're one of the premier teams in the league, obviously," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Ivanovsky, a private batting instructor, has conducted baseball camps and 
clinics at his hitting school at Lunada Bay in Palos Verdes for five years. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a bunch of kids either in or out of high school who weren't playing 
anywhere else," Ivanovsky said. "It's kind of a Mutt and Jeff team." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers have two members of Anderson's 1990 Bishop Montgomery team: 
outfielder Erik Geierman and All-Angelus League shortstop Curtis Bowman. 
</P>
<P>
The team doesn't have a home field yet, but it does have Brett Campbell, a 
15-year-old third baseman who hit .767 for Palos Verdes' freshman team this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"He's hitting the ball like a man already," Ivanovsky said. 
</P>
<P>
Ivanovsky's lineup also features Harbor College first baseman Erik Russell, 
former Redondo second baseman Chris Townsend and Inglewood left fielder Kyle 
Jackson, who will attend UC Irvine next year on a partial scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"The Dodgers are the only team in the league like that," Anderson said. "You 
can only get better by playing against better players." 
</P>
<P>
So far the Dodgers are 3-0. They defeated West Torrance, 17-7, knocked off 
Bishop Montgomery, 15-10, and beat Redondo, 7-0, Tuesday on a two-hitter by 
Bowman, who hadn't pitched in a couple of years but struck out 10 batters. 
</P>
<P>
The league also features Mira Costa right-handed ace Jason Garner, who led the 
Mustangs into the Southern Section playoffs as a junior, West Torrance pitcher 
Stefan Wilson, and Redondo right-handers Frank Bignami and Akash Sehgal. 
</P>
<P>
The league cost about $450 in set-up funds. Each team will play a 17-game 
schedule, all mid-week games to avoid conflicts with American Legion for fields 
and umpires. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson also has scheduled an eight-team tournament for the end of the season 
for Redondo and Torrance Park. Each team will be guaranteed at least three 
games in the round-robin tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Anderson was busy coaching an academic all-star team from 
California in the Apeldoorn-European Baseball Series in the Netherlands. 
Anderson's Californians went 9-1 in the tourney en route to the championship. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, the South Bay Summer League is only one of Anderson's "19 or so 
summer projects." 
</P>
<P>
He is also busy laying sod, remodeling his Manhattan Beach home and turning his 
office into a baby's bedroom. Anderson and his wife, Melanie, expect their 
first child in September. 
</P>
<P>
So Anderson doesn't have time to coach Bishop's team. He has left that task to 
his No. 1 assistant, Rudy Garbalosa. 
</P>
<P>
His involvement with the new league is limited to scheduling and compiling 
scores and standings. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, the league basically runs itself, to be honest," Anderson said. "We 
just set it up and let 'em play."

BRUIN GYM-DANDIES TO BOOST U.S. HOPES AT GOODWILL GAMES; 
</P>
<P>
GYMNASTICS: NCAA HIGH BAR CHAMPION CHRIS WALLER AND ASSISTANT COACH YEFIM 
FURMAN BELIEVE THE TEAM CAN FINISH IN THE TOP THREE AT SEATTLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA's Chris Waller and YefimFurman believe that the Goodwill Games will help 
revive American men's gymnastics, which has been in the doldrums since the 
United States won a gold medal at the 1984 Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
Waller, the NCAA high bar champion, is a member of the four-man U.S. team that 
will compete at Seattle when the games start July 20. Furman, an assistant to 
UCLA Coach Art Shurlock, will be an assistant for the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
Waller and Furman believe that the Soviet Union, the dominant gymnastics team 
of the 1980s, will be difficult, if not impossible to beat. Both said the 
United States has a good chance of finishing among the top three teams. 
</P>
<P>
Waller, who qualified for the Goodwill team by finishing second in the 
all-around at the U.S. Gymnastics Federation championships in Denver, said that 
the U.S. victory in 1984 was not tarnished because the Soviets did not compete. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team was led by Bart Conner, who finished first in the parallel bars, 
and by former UCLA gymnasts Peter Vidmar, Tim Daggett and Mitch Gaylord. Vidmar 
tied China's Li Ning for first on the pommel horse. 
</P>
<P>
The 1984 U.S. team "was as good, if not better, than anyone around and U.S. 
gymnastics was right in there with the rest of the world," Waller said. 
</P>
<P>
Furman, who competed for the Soviet Union in the 1972 Olympics and coached in 
his homeland, later immigrated to the United States. He said that the lag 
resulted in an 11th-place finish for the United States in the 1988 Olympics and 
seventh- and eighth-place finishes in the 1988 and 1989 world championships. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. men gymnasts peaked in 1984, but members of the Olympic-championship team 
gave up competition to capitalize on their success and there "was no 
continuation," Furman said. 
</P>
<P>
Waller said that U.S. gymnasts have worked hard since 1984, but he believes 
that "grass-root programs for training athletes in that period of time" became 
antiquated, but have since improved. 
</P>
<P>
In Waller's opinion, there is nothing old-fashioned about the U.S. Goodwill 
team. "We have a great team, we should be in the top three," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other team members are John Roethlisberger of the University of Minnesota, 
Trent Dimas of the University of Nebraska and Lance Ringnald, a member of the 
1988 Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
Roethlisberger, whose father, Fred, is the head coach at Minnesota, led the 
Golden Gophers to the NCAA championship this year and finished first in the 
all-around at the USGF championships. Waller said that he admires John 
Roethlisberger because "his strength is consistency" and that Dimas and 
Ringnald are also excellent performers. 
</P>
<P>
Waller said that he, Dimas and Ringnald should make the United States "very 
strong in the high bar." Waller, a native of Mount Prospect, Ill., won the 1990 
NCAA high bar title, and Dimas was the runner-up. At the USGF meet, Dimas and 
Ringnald tied for first in the high bar and Waller was third after his hand 
grip (similar to a baseball batting glove) came loose midway through his 
routine, forcing him to start over. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the team's "routines are more difficult and our techniques are 
better than U.S. gymnasts of the past. I'm encouraged. We have a good team, the 
meet is in the United States, and I think we'll do great and win some medals." 
</P>
<P>
As for his own prospects, Waller said that he feels confident going into the 
games. "If you're not confident, you won't compete well. You'll be looking over 
your shoulder, and you'll fall. I feel like I'm in great shape. I'm just a bit 
fatigued from the long college season." 
</P>
<P>
Furman said that the U.S. team should be "much better" than the one that failed 
to win a medal in the 1986 Goodwill Games. He thinks that Waller, who has 
completed his eligibility at UCLA, is capable of winning medals in the high bar 
and on the pommel horse. Waller won an NCAA title on the pommel horse in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Furman said the Soviet Union has so much depth that it could "put two or three 
teams on the floor, and all of them would be good." 
</P>
<P>
Waller and Furman feel that the United States will benefit because the games 
are in Seattle instead of Europe or Asia. 
</P>
<P>
"The judging (at international meets) is very political, but a lot of Americans 
will be judges (at Seattle)," Waller said. "So that is going to help our 
gymnastics a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Furman said that competing in Seattle "will be our plus. It's like having the 
home-court advantage in a college basketball game." 
</P>
<P>
Waller, 21, underwent heart surgery six years ago to repair a constricted 
aorta, a condition that gave him high blood pressure and made his legs weak. 
Surgeons opened up an artery and later closed it with a patch, he said. 
</P>
<P>
His legs became much stronger after the operation. "Four months after surgery, 
my vertical leap was four inches higher than before," he said. A year after the 
operation, he became the youngest gymnast (at 16) to compete in the USGF 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
After the Goodwill Games, Waller and UCLA teammates Scott Keswick and Chainey 
Umphrey will compete for the United States against the Soviets in a meet Aug. 
3-5 in San Jose. Waller said he hopes to continue to compete with the national 
team for two more years and in the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
Waller said he is grateful that he was able to compete in college gymnastics 
because it "helped me tremendously. I got a lot stronger, physically and 
mentally. 
</P>
<P>
"But I finished (college competition) at a perfect time. I can focus on the big 
(international) meets and be concerned more with doing the more difficult 
routines. When you have a meet every weekend in college, you can't develop new 
tricks." 
</P>
<P>
Developing "a clean, beautiful routine with a unique skill gives you the edge 
to win," he said. "I have to work a lot on my floor exercise and vaulting 
because those are slightly below where they should be compared to the rest of 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
Waller has worked hard at gymnastics since he took up the sport in 1980, but he 
is not thinking of quitting. "I never really get tired of gymnastics," he said. 
"It's fun. It's like the essence of being a kid, flipping around the gym. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been competing for years, and there are times when my body is sore and 
I'm tired. At those times, I wouldn't like to quit necessarily, but I would 
like a break. There hasn't been a time when I absolutely did not want to 
compete."

<P>
There's a challenge that Patty Sheehan is determined to meet -- to win the du 
Maurier Classic. 
</P>
<P>
Sheehan, 33, has won two of the last three LPGA events heading into the second 
of four majors, starting today at the Westmount Golf and Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really looking forward to this because it is a major championship," said 
Sheehan, who won at the McDonald's Championship on June 10 and the Rochester 
Invitational last week. 
</P>
<P>
"Traditionally, I haven't played extremely well in this tournament. I don't 
really have an explanation why, but that's why I'm looking forward to this week 
because I have been playing so well." 
</P>
<P>
Sheehan and Pat Bradley, trying for a fourth du Maurier title, are the only 
competitors with three wins this year. Sheehan, who also opened the year with a 
win in the Jamaica Classic in January, would like to be the first to win four. 
</P>
<P>
She leads the LPGA money list with more than $357,000, about $33,000 more than 
Bradley. It's the ninth consecutive year she has earned more than $200,000 on 
the tour, putting her fifth on the all-time list with more than $2.45 million. 
</P>
<P>
Top prize in the four-day event is $90,000 from a total purse of $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
Sheehan had a quick practice round Monday on the rolling, 6,415-yard, par-73 
course. She then had an equally quick visit to New York on Tuesday where she 
received the All-American Collegiate Hall of Fame award. She is only the fourth 
woman to be so honored in the award's 26 years. 
</P>
<P>
Back in Canada on Wednesday, Sheehan got attuned to the 59-year-old course 
being used for the du Maurier for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's beautiful, old, traditional and in great shape," she said with 
enthusiasm. "It's truly pleasurable to play a golf course that's in great 
shape."

Rancho Santa Fe's Pat Duncan, the four-time defending San Diego amateur 
champion, won first- and second-round matches as match play started Wednesday 
in the California Golf Assn.'s 79th State Amateur at Pebble Beach Golf Links. 
</P>
<P>
Three other San Diego-area golfers -- San Diego's Bob Imlay and Jack Spradlin 
Jr. and Rancho Santa Fe's Todd Demsey -- won first-round matches but lost in 
the second, and Fallbrook's Craig Anderson lost in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Duncan defeated Alan Drobka of Newport Beach, 5 and 4, in the first round and 
Bryan Pemberton of Dublin, 6 and 5, in the second. He will play Gary Vanier of 
Oakland in the quarterfinals today. 
</P>
<P>
Imlay defeated Mark Sear of San Jose, 1-up, then lost to Vanier, 6 and 5. 
Demsey defeated Craig Howard of Redding on the 19th hole in the first round, 
then lost to Ben Furth of San Francisco, 7 and 5. Spradlin defeated Mitch Voges 
of Simi Valley, 2 and 1, then lost to Sandy Galbraith of Fountain Valley, 1-up. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson was beaten, 3 and 2, in the first round by Terrence Miskell of 
Salinas. 
</P>
<P>
Two more rounds will be played today, with the 36-hole final Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Casey Boyns of Pacific Grove and medalist Mark Johnson of 
Oxnard were among the first-round casualties. 
</P>
<P>
Boyns was beaten, 4 and 3, by reigning Southern California Golf Assn. Amateur 
champion Paul Stankowski. Johnson lost to Vanier, the 1982 state champion, 6 
and 4. 
</P>
<P>
Vanier was two under par for the day. Stankowski was the same, although he was 
playing Pebble Beach for the first time. He defeated David Berganio of Sylmar, 
6 and 4, in the afternoon.

COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: HYPERCARD 2.0 PACKS MORE FEATURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE J. MAGID, LAWRENCE J. MAGID is a Silicon Valley-based computer 
analyst and writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Apple Computer is about to introduce HyperCard 2.0, the first major upgrade to 
the popular programming and database software on Apple's Macintosh since 
HyperCard was introduced in August, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
HyperCard is harder to describe than to use. It's part database management 
software and part programming language. The software, which comes free with 
every Macintosh, allows users to create their own information systems. Unlike 
most programming languages, it's designed for novices as well as professional 
software developers. 
</P>
<P>
HyperCard can be used to create your own programs, called stacks. They are so 
named because they resemble a stack of index cards. Each card stores a piece of 
information. For example, a simple stack might be used to maintain a phone and 
address listing, with a separate card for each person in the directory. 
</P>
<P>
HyperCard isn't limited to simple programs. Professional programmers have 
created sophisticated commercial HyperCard applications. For example, Xiphius, 
a Marina del Rey-based software company, has used HyperCard to develop a 
compact disc-based national directory with names, addresses, phone and fax 
numbers of more than 100,000 businesses and institutions. Hyperglot Software of 
Knoxville has used it to create language training stacks that provide 
pronunciation via the Mac's built-in speaker. Unlike most IBM-compatibles, Macs 
have the ability to reproduce high-fidelity sound. 
</P>
<P>
I used HyperCard a couple of years ago to create a counting and 
word-recognition game for my then-preschool children. The game, which took only 
a few hours to complete, belies my general lack of programming sophistication. 
It features pictures and voices of my kids, me and other family members. Use of 
voice allowed me to issue instructions that would have been otherwise 
impossible for preschoolers to understand. I also used sound, including brief 
musical segments, to reinforce correct answers. 
</P>
<P>
Photographs were scanned in with the Apple scanner. Voice and music were 
entered with MacRecorder, a $200 package that includes a microphone and audio 
input jack that plugs into the Mac's serial port. The software that controls 
the scanner and MacRecorder is written in HyperCard, so they are easy to use. 
</P>
<P>
You don't have to know a programming language to work in HyperCard. Commands 
are issued by using the mouse to press on-screen buttons. Buttons contain the 
intelligence to complete certain tasks. Once a button has been created, it can 
be copied and used again. HyperCard comes with hundreds of buttons that users 
can incorporate into their own stacks. 
</P>
<P>
HyperCard also comes with its own programming language, called HyperTalk, which 
can be used to customize stacks. You don't even have to learn the language; 
simple stacks can be created by pointing, clicking and copying other objects. 
But serious programmers tap HyperTalk for sophisticated programs. HyperTalk, 
according to Apple HyperCard program manager Mike Holm, is being used by some 
colleges and universities to teach introductory programming. 
</P>
<P>
HyperCard 2.0 adds many features to the popular software. Unlike the previous 
version, it lets you run more than one stack at a time, each in its own window. 
HyperCard itself can now run in the background while the Mac is running other 
programs. In the old version of HyperCard, the display couldn't be any larger 
than the nine-inch screen on the Macintosh Plus or SE. The new version allows 
programmers to fill any screens, including the 19-inch monitors that are 
increasingly popular with Macintosh II systems. 
</P>
<P>
The new HyperCard can more easily be used to create HyperText applications that 
involve clicking on a word to bring up additional information. I saw one 
demonstration in which clicking on an italicized word brought up a definition 
of that word. Another demonstration involved names being turned into "hot 
buttons." You click on a person's name to bring up his or her picture and 
speech sample. That was possible with the old HyperCard, but the new version 
makes it far easier to do. 
</P>
<P>
The program now lets you create your own user-definable menus. A new HyperTalk 
script editor allows programmers to move back and forth between editing their 
scripts and running their stacks. It's also possible for stacks to share 
resources with one another. A sound that's contained in one stack, for example, 
can be played by any other stack on the disk. That simplifies programming (you 
don't have to rewrite the code each time you use it) and also saves space on 
users' disks. 
</P>
<P>
The new HyperCard gives users more control over text. The old version limited 
your use of text styles and sizes. You now have complete flexibility, similar 
to what you'd expect with a Macintosh word processing program. You also have 
more flexibility with printed reports. HyperCard has always been great at 
displaying information on the screen but weak when came to printing. The new 
version makes it much easier to create printed reports. It also makes better 
use of laser printers, allowing you to print graphics at the full 
300-dot-per-inch resolution. 
</P>
<P>
It's now possible for a stack to print a different type style than it displays 
on the screen. Some Macintosh users would consider that a step backward, but I 
think it's wonderful. The Macintosh has been both blessed and cursed with a 
graphic screen that shows exactly what you'll get on paper. There is even a 
word for it: "WYSIWYG," pronounced wizywig, which stands for "what you see is 
what you get." 
</P>
<P>
Trouble is, some type sizes and styles look great on paper but awful on the 
screen. Most Macintosh programs don't let you turn WYSIWYG off, so, if you want 
to use tiny type in your printed document, you have to suffer through it on 
screen -- or work in a larger type size, then modify your document when you're 
about to print. 
</P>
<P>
Some HyperCard users will be disappointed to learn that the new version 
provides only limited support for color. You can include color graphics, but 
you cannot use color within HyperCard itself. 
</P>
<P>
HyperCard comes with several free stacks, including an address book, a date 
book, calendars, an expense form and a phone dialer. All new Macs have it, and 
it is available from Apple dealers (with documentation) for $50. 
</P>
<P>
Apple's goal is to get everyone to upgrade. It is making that easy by 
authorizing (but not requiring) dealers and user groups to provide free updates 
to users who bring in their own disks. The program will be available in 
mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
HyperCard will work on any Macintosh with at least 1 megabyte of memory and two 
800-kilobyte floppy drives or one floppy drive and a hard disk. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HYPERCARD 2.0 
</P>
<P>
A major upgrade to Apple's popular programming and database software that is 
included free with every Macintosh. 
</P>
<P>
Features: Allows users to create "stacks," or programs, without having to learn 
a complex programming language. New version allows you to run multiple stacks 
at a time, depending on your Mac's memory. HyperCard's display is limited only 
by the size of the screen. It also has user-definable menus. Support for 
"HyperText" gives you a direct link from a word or group of words to related 
information or activity. Its on-line help system provides reference information 
and assistance. You have unlimited use of screen fonts and type styles. 
Available mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
Price: Free with all new Macs. $50 (including documentation) from any Apple 
dealer. Dealers and user groups will be authorized (but not required) to 
provide copies for free or for the cost of blank disks.

<P>
Stock prices gained Wednesday on buying that was fueled by higher U.S. bond 
prices, shrugging off unwelcome earnings news from American Telephone &amp; 
Telegraph. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, which had fallen 59.40 during the past 
three sessions, climbed 19.80 to 2,862.13. 
</P>
<P>
In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7-to-5 in 
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 851 up, 597 
down and 529 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume edged up to 146.62 million shares, against Tuesday's 141.42 
million. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T stock was by far the day's most active issue, falling 2 1/8 to 39 1/8 
on turnover of more than 11.5 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
The selloff came after the company said it expects its earnings for the second 
quarter to fall short of the 65 cents a share it earned in the April-June 
period last year. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T cited weaker-than-expected sales of some of its products, which it 
attributed to sluggish economic activity and market conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The drop in AT&amp;T, which is the nation's most widely held stock with more 
than 2.6 million shareholders, weighed down the Dow Jones industrial average by 
close to 4 1/4 points. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts said buyers moved cautiously into some other stocks after it 
became evident that the AT&amp;T setback wasn't starting a general rush to 
sell. 
</P>
<P>
Recent recession fears also seemed to be abated by the Commerce Department's 
report that the index of leading economic indicators rose 0.8% in May. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in the index, which is designed to function as a kind of economic 
crystal ball, came in toward the high end of advance estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Caterpillar, which has fallen sharply since early this week on an 
earnings disappointment, lost another 1/4 to 52 1/4 in active trading. 
</P>
<P>
Pharmaceutical issues were strong, bolstered by bright appraisals from many 
analysts of the industry's profit outlook even in a sluggish economy. Eli Lilly 
gained 1 5/8 to 81, Bristol-Myers Squibb added 1 7/8 to 63 1/4, Abbott 
Laboratories rose 5/8 to 40 7/8 and Pfizer gained 1 to 63 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
Other gainers among the blue chips included International Business Machines, up 
1 1/4 at 118; Exxon, up 1 at 48; Procter &amp; Gamble, up 1 1/2 at 83 3/4, and 
General Electric, up 1/8 at 69 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo Stock Exchange staged a strong rally, with the leading indicator 
gaining more than 2% on institutional buying. The Nikkei 225-share index surged 
740.98, to close at 32,312.75, a 2.3% gain from Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices finished sharply lower on London's Stock Exchange, undermined by 
weakness in the stock index futures market. The Financial Times 100-share index 
ended down 26.3 at 2373.5. 
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, West Germany, stock prices ended firmer as investors returned to 
buy after Tuesday's brief consolidation period. The 30-share DAX index rose 
11.10 to end at 1,901.46.

<P>
Demand for 4-Year Notes Lifts Bonds 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices finished higher, encouraged by unusually strong demand for the 
Treasury's auction of new four-year notes. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond rose 11/32 point, or nearly $3.44 per 
$1,000 face amount. Its yield fell to 8.48% from 8.51% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Camilli, economist at Maria Ramirez Capital Consultants Inc., said the 
market rallied after bidding closed on the Treasury's auction of $8.3 billion 
in new four-year notes. 
</P>
<P>
The enthusiasm for the four-year notes spilled over to the rest of the bond 
market, lifting prices which had drifted in a narrow range for most of the day 
as traders continued to weigh the import of President Bush's comments that he 
would consider tax hikes as part of a broader package of spending cuts and 
other steps to help control the growing deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the market seemed to ignore the government's leading indicators 
report. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.313%, unchanged from the level late Tuesday. 
</P>

<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Stronger in Quiet Trading 
</P>
<P>
The dollar drifted higher in quiet trading as the markets ignored a report that 
showed the economy may be strengthening, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
Currency traders said that there was little activity in the market and that the 
dollar moved in a tight range. 
</P>
<P>
The market paid little attention to the Commerce Department's report that its 
index of leading economic indicators rose to a record high in May. 
</P>
<P>
News of increasing economic activity normally is good for the dollar, but "a 
market that's bearish on the dollar ignores good news," said John McCarthy, 
chief currency dealer for Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank in New York. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush's comment Tuesday that he may accept a tax increase to reach a 
budget accord set the tone for the market, McCarthy said. An accord that cuts 
the federal deficit could lead to lower interest rates, which tend to devalue 
the dollar relative to other currencies. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 154.35 Japanese yen, down from 155.23. In 
London, the dollar also traded at 154.35. In New York, one dollar bought 154.40 
yen, down from 154.55 late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, one British pound cost $1.7430, more expensive for buyers than 
Tuesday's $1.7360. In New York, the pound traded at $1.7428, cheaper than 
$1.7430 late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices firmed. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for June 
delivery closed at $351.40 an ounce, up $1. Later, Republic National Bank in 
New York quoted an ounce of gold at $350.10, unchanged.

</P>
<P>
Sugar Prices Up on Consumption Data 
</P>
<P>
Prices of sugar futures bounced sharply higher on New York's Coffee, Sugar 
&amp; Cocoa Exchange after the Agriculture Department predicted that world 
sugar consumption would outstrip production for the sixth straight year. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, oil futures fell; grains and soybeans were mixed; 
livestock and meat were mixed, and precious metals were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Sugar futures settled 0.20 to 0.28 cent higher in New York, with the contract 
for delivery in July at 12.66 cents a pound.

WATER WOES AND HIGH COSTS CHANGE THE FACE OF SAN DIEGO FARMLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the blows suffered by the nation's agriculture industry in general in 
recent years, many of San Diego County's farmers and growers have prospered by 
switching to profitable specialty fruits such as mandarins and cherimoyas. 
</P>
<P>
Within the last decade, the composition of San Diego County's agricultural 
industry has changed dramatically. Many buyers of tomatoes, once abundant in 
the county, have shifted to Mexico as a source because of cheaper labor costs. 
Nevertheless, farmers and growers posted a record $772 million in revenue last 
year, according to Wendy Dietrich Benz, a spokeswoman for the County Farm 
Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Production of the county's trademark crops, such as citrus fruits, have also 
been scaled back, Benz said. But the industry remains healthy because growers 
are producing high-return specialty crops, partly to meet the demand of ethnic 
groups that are increasingly moving into San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Still, tough times could be around the corner for the county's agricultural 
industry, which is in the midst of a four-year drought that threatens to 
destroy crops. 
</P>
<P>
For only the second time in its 60-year history, the Metropolitan Water 
District of Southern California has notified agricultural water users of a 
potential cutback in water delivery. The reduction could begin as early as 
January, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been water misers out of necessity for years and years," said 
Escondido grower Ben Hillebrecht. "We dribble it on pretty carefully. We can't 
do much more. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's any kind of a cutback, I'll have to cut off water to my older 
(groves), try to save my younger ones," Hillebrecht said, "and hope I don't go 
belly-up." 
</P>
<P>
Although Hillebrecht may not have ways to counter Mother Nature's challenges, 
he and fellow growers have found success in recent years by diversifying their 
crops. 
</P>
<P>
"We're competing with Mexico," with its cheaper costs. "Our water costs are so 
high . . . we've had to grow crops that are going to bring in more money," 
Hillebrecht said. 
</P>
<P>
Hillebrecht has experimented growing new crops on his 250 acres -- his father's 
land which once yielded only oranges and avocadoes now produces more than 40 
crops, including, high-return products such as raspberries and persimmons. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't want to pay much for tomatoes," Hillebrecht said. "But they will 
for raspberries." 
</P>
<P>
The influx of ethnic groups into the county has created demand for profitable 
specialty fruits such as cherimoyas -- a subtropical fruit with a 
banana-peach-melon blend flavor -- mandarins, bright-red pulp oranges called 
"blood oranges" and kumquats, said Steve White, president of Cal Flavor. The 
agricultural company grows, manages and packs avocados and specialty fruits on 
1,800 acres in North County. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only do we see a market for them, they require less land to grow on and 
they have a good 
</P>
<P>
return. Those are major factors when we're confronted by urbanization and high 
water costs," White said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, White said, a grower needs 10 to 20 acres to have a viable avocado 
operation. "But, if you're growing specialty fruits, with just 1 to 5 acres you 
can still have a very viable operation," White said. 
</P>
<P>
A tremendous increase in outdoor and indoor decorative plants and trees has 
also contributed to the local agriculture's robust condition. 
</P>
<P>
According to the county's crop report, revenues of plant and tree products have 
increased nearly five-fold to $153.1 million in 1988, up from $32.2 million in 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
"With all the construction that's been going on . . . a lot of these plants are 
going for landscaping," said Michael Mellano, an Oceanside flower grower and 
past president of the California Floral Council, an industry group for cut 
flower and indoor decorative plant growers. 
</P>
<P>
Revenues of San Diego's plant and tree product have increased, not only because 
of greater demand, Mellano said, but because urbanization has forced many Los 
Angeles and Orange County-based growers to move their nurseries to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Growers "are losing their ground up there," said Mellano, who moved his 
operation from Los Angeles County to San Luis Rey where he grows a variety of 
flowers on nearly 200 acres. "We wanted to expand, but we were surrounded by 
housing. That's why we came down here." 
</P>
<P>
But, with each rainless day that passes in San Diego County, local farmers and 
growers fear that their worst nightmare will come true: drought will make 
irrigation systems drip dry and parch their crops. 
</P>
<P>
"The only other time we came this close to a cutback was last year," said 
Gordon Hess, a senior civil engineer with the San Diego County Water Authority 
who is responsible for agricultural water issues. "We've issued back-to-back 
notification" for water reduction. "We're in grave condition." 
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Water District sells water to the San Diego County Water 
Authority -- a wholesaler that, in turn, sells water to the local water 
districts. The water districts then distribute the water to municipal, 
industrial and agricultural consumers. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hess, San Diego County receives water from three major sources -- 
the Colorado River, Northern California and local reservoirs. Rainfall runoff 
is down 48% for the Colorado River, down 44% for Northern California, and 50% 
for local reservoirs. 
</P>
<P>
Hess said it was unknown how severe a water reduction would be or how long it 
would last. 
</P>
<P>
It all depends on the rainfall between now and December, Hess said. 
</P>
<P>
The potential cutback is of concern to farmers and growers because many of them 
already utilize water conservation techniques and know of few other ways to 
survive a drought. 
</P>
<P>
According to irrigation experts who have reviewed local farm, San Diego farmers 
and growers are 80% to 85% water-efficient -- much higher than the statewide 
average of 60% to 65%. Local farmers have achieved high efficiency not only 
because they fear a severe drought, but to save money: water rates in San Diego 
County are among the highest in the state. 
</P>
<P>
For example, water in the Imperial Valley costs $10 to $12 per acre-foot, Hess 
said. "That's because the water flows downhill from the Colorado River right 
into the valley. There's no pumping cost involved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But water rates in San Diego range from $250 to $500 per acre-foot, depending 
on how much pumping is involved to get the water from their local water 
districts to their farms," Hess said.

ARCHITECTURE: NEW TRENDS ARE SEEN IN S.D. DESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only a few months into a new decade, San Diego architecture is showing signs of 
significant breakthroughs. 
</P>
<P>
Not only are local architects addressing social problems by designing 
interesting, economical buildings, but they are exploring architectural 
languages more suited to this area than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
Four out-of-town architects came to these conclusions after spending two days 
here last week to select the winners of this year's design awards from the 
local American Institute of Architects chapter. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps there was no better sign of the times than the sole winner of an honor 
award the top level of achievement): architect Rob Quigley's J Street Inn 
downtown, a single-room occupancy hotel (SRO) done with plenty of imagination 
on a limited budget, but without some of the whimsical frills Quigley added to 
earlier projects. 
</P>
<P>
"It was extremely well handled," said juror Leigh Breslau of Skidmore Owings 
&amp; Merrill, Chicago. "The layout was good, the entry was well defined, the 
ground floor public spaces, such as the reading room, are well identified. 
Colorful tile mosaics outside help make it very unstigmatizing for its (low 
income) users." 
</P>
<P>
Overall, 16 winners were selected from 132 submissions. Awards were given in 
three categories: honor, merit (second level) and citation of recognition 
(third level). 
</P>
<P>
Besides Quigley's honor award, he earned citations of recognition for the 
not-yet-built Sherman Heights Community Center, the new Escondido Transit 
Center, the interior light fixtures at the Linda Vista Library and the Beaumont 
Building downtown, which contains the architect's offices and penthouse 
residence. 
</P>
<P>
The library award came under a new category called "Divine Detail." Glass 
display panels at the Dale Fitzmorris dress shop in La Jolla, designed by M.W. 
Steele Group, became a second "Divine Detail," in this case a merit award. Also 
new this year was the "Interior Design" category, with a citation of 
recognition also going to M.W. Steel's dress shop. Jurors admired a low-key 
interior that lets the bold designer dresses sell themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Quigley's award for the Beaumont gave the architect some vindication; the 
building has been the subject of much debate, loathed by many, loved by a few 
and misunderstood by most. It received an undeserved Onion in last year's 
Orchids &amp; Onions program, the public's idea of the best and worst local 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so different from anything else, it certainly has an eccentric quality," 
said juror Joe Esherick of the San Francisco firm Esherick Homsey Dodge &amp; 
Davis. "For people who don't want to view the unexpected, it must be a shock. 
But the closer I got, the more impressed I was. If people would imagine going 
into the building, enjoying the experience, they'd understand it much better. 
The idea that you make a snap judgment whether to like something or not is like 
judging people, not letting them speak to us and reveal their inner thoughts 
and aspirations." 
</P>
<P>
The winning projects were recognized last Saturday night during a program at 
the Aventine in La Jolla, a project designed by Princeton, N.J., architect 
Michael Graves. The Aventine borrows pseudo-classical forms and rich materials, 
and the setting offered quite a contrast to this year's winners, mostly small 
projects done with a restraint the jurors found refreshing. 
</P>
<P>
Clients -- developers, public officials, and others -- deserve some of the 
praise for this year's winners, especially for their attentions to low-cost, 
socially oriented buildings that in the past have been written off as necessary 
evils. There seems to be a growing awareness that, even on projects with modest 
budgets, good architecture can be had. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Quigley's SRO, honors given to buildings with a social conscience 
included a merit award to Visions Architects for the Lemon Grove Community 
Center (for seniors), plus citations of recognition to Casa de las Madres, a 
not-yet-built home for unwed mothers in Escondido designed by Rene Davids and 
Christine Killory, Quigley's community center, and the not-yet-built Marina 
Court downtown apartments by the Austin Hansen Group. 
</P>
<P>
Breslau praised the Davids and Killory project for its floor and site plans, 
and called the forms "solid, recognizable, well massed." 
</P>
<P>
Juror Norman Pfeiffer of Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer in Los Angeles liked the Marina 
Court as a good "background" building, and credited the architects for 
proposing various knock-out wall panels to allow apartments within the building 
to be configured in a variety of sizes. 
</P>
<P>
The evening's socially responsible aura continued through three public 
buildings honored. Though such buildings don't address social problems, they 
are built with public money. As such, they do genuine social duty, inspiring a 
civic pride in public architecture that hasn't been felt often in San Diego 
County in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Quigley's library and transit center, the other winning public building 
was a fire station in Sorrento Valley designed by Visions Architects (merit 
award), combining simple box-like forms in an interesting way. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's new downtown convention center, designed by Canadian architect 
Arthur Erickson -- with help from design consultants Loschkey Marquardt &amp; 
Nesholm and San Diego architects Deems Lewis McKinley -- received a merit 
award. Apparently jurors were able to overlook the poor city planning that 
allowed this massive but well-designed edifice to close off the waterfront from 
public views and easy access. 
</P>
<P>
"There are just a lot of masterful things there," said Esherick. "The sail 
structure on top is especially nice." 
</P>
<P>
The Tsao residence in Singapore, by Pacific Associates Planners Architects, won 
an award of merit. Jurors were impressed with the way the architects, led by 
Randy Dalrymple, subtly captured the architectural character of its city. 
</P>
<P>
Other citations of recognition went to a not-yet-built visual arts facility by 
Neptune Thomas Davis in association with Rebecca Binder, and architect Richard 
Yen's own studio. 
</P>
<P>
Last, but not least, jurors gave a special "distinguished building award" to 
Bertram Goodhue's California Tower in Balboa Park, the centerpiece of one of 
San Diego's most romantic architectural groupings. Completed for the Panama 
Pacific Exposition in 1915, the tower was no architectural breakthrough, but in 
the context of Balboa Park, it gives a large set of buildings the kind of 
visual focal point most new developments so sorely lack. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few negatives the jurors voiced was a certain sense of impermanence 
to some of the buildings, partly due to their materials (often stucco) and 
less-than-perfect detailing. 
</P>
<P>
During the past three years, the AIA architects who run the awards program, 
including awards chairman Russ Stout, have invited jurors with credits on both 
large and small projects, hoping more large projects will be honored. This 
year, though, they found no worthy large projects, tending to confirm one's 
suspicion that, in San Diego, big developers are still more knowledgeable about 
making money than making good buildings.

Party Girl: Helen Gurley Brown received a Mercedes Benz and a replica of a 
manual typewriter at a bash in New York celebrating her 25 years with 
Cosmopolitan magazine. The 68-year-old editor-in-chief danced the Charleston at 
the Monday night party, said a Cosmo spokeswoman.

Hidden Deal: Track star Carl Lewis said he was given money by Nike while 
competing in college -- a violation of National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
rules. In his autobiography, "Inside Track," the six-time Olympic gold medalist 
said that his contract, which covered college and after-college years, was 
worth $200,000, plus bonuses. Nike spokeswoman Liz Dolan said Tuesday in New 
York the company knew it was violating NCAA rules when it signed Lewis.

Art War: Federal Judge Lynn Hughes in Houston placed a $6.8-million price tag 
on four watercolors painted by a young Adolf Hitler and photographic archives 
of the pre-war era. The findings were issued Tuesday in a lawsuit in which the 
U.S. Army and the family of Heinrich Hoffmann, who was given the paintings by 
Hitler, both claim ownership.

Monkey Business: An opulent 83-foot yacht whose most famous passenger was Gary 
Hart is for sale at $1.225 million. Elton John, Jack Nicholson and Elizabeth 
Taylor have visited the Monkey Business docked north of Miami. The former U.S. 
senator from Colorado sank in his run for the presidency after his trip with 
model Donna Rice on the boat in 1987.

SOCIETY: A REGAL AFFAIR HAILS DAYS OF OLD CHINATOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1912, members of the San Diego Women's Purity League picketed the conjoined 
-- and in some respects connubial -- Anita and Regal hotels. Last Saturday, 
some of their descendants were among the 200 supporters of the Gaslamp Quarter 
Foundation who donned black tie to celebrate the reopening of these one-time 
dens of iniquity. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation staged "Return to Old Chinatown" to coincide with the planned 
opening of the new Chinese Regal Hotel, although delays have pushed the actual 
opening to sometime in July. The building occupies a site at 4th Avenue near J 
Street that was the heart of the small Chinatown that thrived in downtown San 
Diego in the decades nearest the turn of the century. This annex to the Horton 
Grand Hotel is a reconstruction of the Anita and Regal hotels, which developer 
Dan Pearson moved over from the 3rd Avenue side of the block. (These structures 
shared a facade and gained the nickname "Raid Hotel" in 1912, when San Diego 
police arrested 138 ladies of the evening and put all but the two who promised 
to reform on a train to Los Angeles.) 
</P>
<P>
The only police presence Saturday, however, was one of the cheerful, 
unofficial, Gay '90s-uniformed Keystone Kops who stroll the streets of Gaslamp. 
Although the party had its raucous moments, especially during a particularly 
exciting mah-jongg match, this crowd largely minded its manners. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation annually hosts a fund-raiser tied to one of the neighborhood's 
historical themes. The construction of the Chinese Regal pointed the way this 
year and prompted the committee to appoint Connie Hom, whose family founded and 
continues to operate the Woo Chee Chong Oriental markets, as honorary 
chairwoman. Hom responded by bringing a print of the 1986 documentary 
"Mysteries Beyond the Great Wall," which she produced for KPBS and which earned 
six Emmy nominations, for viewing as one of the multiple diversions offered by 
the event. 
</P>
<P>
"Being here brings me back to my childhood," said Hom. "I used to attend 
Chinese school down here and then go work at Woo Chee Chong. It's all a part of 
San Diego, and I now have a great appreciation for what the Gaslamp Quarter 
Foundation does." 
</P>
<P>
One of the things the foundation does is to stage pretty fair parties. 
Saturday, it decked Copley Alley with strings of red paper lanterns and banners 
bearing Chinese characters suggestive of good fortune, and then filled in the 
scene with a troupe of lion dancers whose duty it was to scare away evil 
spirits, and who in any case certainly banished the blues. Other diversions 
included martial arts and "ribbon dancing" demonstrations, a performance of 
Chinese chamber music, shamelessly uninhibited games of Chinese checkers and 
critical tastings of Chinese teas and beers. The chow ran to dim sum, assorted 
stir-fries and almond cookies. 
</P>
<P>
None of the principals suggested that "Return to Old Chinatown" actually 
presaged any return of a real Chinatown-style district to the neighborhood, 
although several suggested that a hint of the old flavor may be revived. 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing the beginnings of what planners call a 'Chinese thematic 
district,' " said foundation chairman Bill Sauls. "This of course was the 
Chinese district, and, while you have to look to find the Chinese influences in 
the architecture, they're there. We're going to encourage more." 
</P>
<P>
Developer Pearson said he expects other Chinese architectural or thematic 
influences on the stretch of lower 3rd Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"The land under the Chinese Regal was, in a way, Chinese soil for 100 years," 
he said, explaining that Ah Quin, one of the first Chinese migrants to San 
Diego and a partner in some of Alonzo Horton's projects, built his residence on 
the site. 
</P>
<P>
Judith Leitner and Larry Husband co-chaired a committee that included Kay 
Carter, Terry Clements, Stephan Donche, Marlee Ehrenfeld, Ella La Brucherie, 
Louise Miesfeld, Drake Mosier, Kimberly Prendergast and Lyn Semeta. 
</P>
<P>
You only had to notice the ants scurrying across the kitchen counters to know 
that architect Frank Lloyd Wright's Usonian Automatic House, recently installed 
on its own lawn in the parking lot of San Diego Museum of Art, would fit 
instantly and naturally into the San Diego landscape. 
</P>
<P>
The ants showed up early for the dinner dance and gala preview exhibition, 
given Friday for members of the museum's President's Circle, that anticipated 
the opening of "Frank Lloyd Wright: In the Realm of Ideas." 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 guests also turned out for the event, including many invited by 
the Kohler and Whirlpool corporations, the sponsors of the national tour of the 
exhibition, as well as representatives of the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation and 
Scottsdale, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
The event kept party-goers on their feet for the first two hours, both touring 
the indoor exhibit of Wright sketches and models and traipsing through the 
Usonian House, a sort of Utopian dwelling planned for the American Everyman. 
The structure enchanted many, although several with experience in housecleaning 
wondered just how one might scrub accumulated soap scum off the shower's 
concrete walls. (And who said practical considerations never arise at social 
events?) 
</P>
<P>
Museum director Steven Brezzo looked both cheerful and frankly relieved as the 
party progressed. He said that the indoor and outdoor installations took rather 
a good bit of labor and ingenuity to install, and that he was pleased with the 
results. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time we've ever installed an exhibition that required the 
expertise of a traditional Masters show and ended up building a house," said 
Brezzo. "It redefines the term 'grand-scale project,' I think." 
</P>
<P>
The event marked the final official social appearance by outgoing museum 
President Joseph Hibben, who was on the very brink of retirement after three 
years in the post. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see tonight as a conclusion," he said. "The museum has tremendous 
momentum; it has received three major collections in the last few years and is 
on the verge of receiving a fourth, which I think is a good sign for the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
The guest list included Sally and John Thornton, Lois and Donald Roon, Ingrid 
Hibben, Jane and Lou Metzger, Beverly Muchnic, Ann and John Davies, Esther 
Burnham with Jack Lasher, Helene and Ed Muzzy, Jill and Don Young, Mary and 
Bruce Hazard, Alice and Dick Cramer, Elinor Oatman, Legler Benbough, Walter 
Fitch III, Rita and Joe Neeper, Wanda and Paul Mosher, Lee and Frank Goldberg, 
Muriel Gluck, Charmaine and Maury Kaplan, Terry and Al Vasques, Freddie and 
Walter Deming, and Betty and Al DeBakcsy.

JACK SMITH: NORTH OF THE BORDER FOR THE SMALL-TOWN NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My retired colleague Cecil Smith, once radio and TV editor of The Times, 
expatriated himself some years ago, with his wife Cleo, to San Miguel Allende, 
Mexico, where they enjoy the slower pace and the relatively lower cost of 
living. 
</P>
<P>
Recently they crossed the border to visit in Baton Rouge, La., where, Cecil 
said, he found a column of mine in the Baton Rouge Standard. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the great pleasures for me in returning from Mexico to the Old 
Country," he writes, "is devouring American newspapers. We have a pretty good 
national English-language paper here (in San Miguel Allende), the Mexico City 
News, which provides Doonesbury, Anthony Scott, Ann Landers and occasionally 
Conrad; but it is so occupied (reasonably enough) with Latin American news, 
mostly bad, that you lose sight of what is happening north of the Rio Grande, 
like how are the Dodgers doing." 
</P>
<P>
I share Cecil's passion for small-town newspapers on my travels. They remind us 
that there is a world other than the one we live in. And they do an admirable 
job of covering their own communities. Recently I have been much entertained 
and informed by the local newspapers at Lake Tahoe, Aspen, Colo., and Brawley, 
on our visits in those towns. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, however, there is little violence or even conflict in them. We may 
read of a fight in their city councils over a zoning ordinance, or alarm over 
the depredations of tourists; but the bulk of the news is about who visited 
whom, who got married, who had a baby, what clubs met, and who died. The police 
news most often concerns a lost child, a treed cat, a petty theft, or a 
trespasser. 
</P>
<P>
Once he crosses the border, Cecil says, he starts feeding quarters in vending 
machines to get the local newspapers. "I never buy national newspapers like USA 
Today or the Wall Street Journal. I dote on local news. What councilman, for 
instance, in Alice, Tex., is accused of siphoning off part of the fertilizer 
money earmarked for the new park? No, what I look for is not the earthshaking 
summits of world leaders but the human comedy that the American press still 
records (television doesn't understand it.)" 
</P>
<P>
Besides Baton Rouge, the Smiths visited Biloxi and Mobile, and several towns in 
Florida -- Marianne, Atlantic Beach, Sarasota, Casey Key and the tourist traps 
that surround Disney World. 
</P>
<P>
"All have papers. But the thing that got me about these various publications 
was how defiantly local they were. Gorbachev might get a mention on the front 
page and there may be a story somewhere about Bush, but generally their columns 
were crowded with local doings." 
</P>
<P>
What shocked Cecil was the nature of those doings. "Crimes of passion, lust and 
rape, bitter divorces, some complete with sordid details, murders of various 
kinds, garrotings, stabbings, drownings, poisonings and gunfire; no page was 
printed without half a dozen incidents of shootings. 
</P>
<P>
"The South is one great smoldering mass of violent action and stormy passions. 
I think it's the heat. Or the humidity. But it was apparent where Faulkner and 
Carson McCullers and all those female Southern novelists got their steamy 
material -- right out of the daily press. I must say your entry was a breath of 
air in a fetid chamber." 
</P>
<P>
I have never been in the South, except for an emergency landing in a DC-3 one 
night at Mobile and a weekend aboard an aircraft carrier off Pensacola. I have 
read some Faulkner and McCullers and seen the plays of Tennessee Williams, but 
I had supposed that they were writing about special cases, and not reflecting 
the entire culture. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder that the thousands of Angelenos who are leaving Los Angeles for less 
crowded places don't consider the South. Most of them seem to be resettling in 
the northwestern or southwestern states -- Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Arizona, 
New Mexico; some have even gone to North Dakota, despite the subzero winter 
temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
But the South seems to offer the best of both worlds. One can live in smaller 
cities there without sacrificing the kind of sordid news one has become used to 
from living in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
I imagine that many Southerners will come forward to condemn Cecil Smith's 
vision of the South. So far, I can only plead ignorance. Maybe this fall my 
wife and I will drive through the Southern states and find out firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
If so, I'll get back to you, assuming we aren't shot dead in the street.

A PONDEROUS SPOOF OF ARTIST-AS-INSIDER LEGEND; 
</P>
<P>
BOONE BY BROOKS HANSEN AND NICK DAVIS SUMMIT BOOKS $19.95, 362 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER, TIMES BOOK CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To paraphrase the original, which I can't recall: the heavy-duty ostrich is a 
hummingbird designed by a committee with cost overruns. 
</P>
<P>
"Boone," a novel, is also designed by a committee. It is a committee of two; 
and if novels are hardly ever written in tandem -- the two-man Ellery Queen and 
Nordhoff's and Hall's "Mutiny on the Bounty" are all I can think of -- this new 
example is altogether unlikely to start a trend. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks Hansen and Nick Davis, according to a note at the end, were friends from 
birth and graduated from Harvard together three summers ago. They have had the 
notion of doing a fictional "Edie." This, for those who have forgotten, was an 
account of the life and death of Edie Sedgwick, a rich waif who destroyed 
herself young following the entourage of Andy Warhol. "Edie" was told by 
patchwork snippets in the words of those who knew her. It was touching because 
it was true, and because at least some of the witnesses were gifted and 
observant. 
</P>
<P>
"Boone" uses the same device, only the protagonist and the two dozen witnesses 
are made up. It is not in the least touching, or gifted or observant . . . or 
much else except 362 pages long, including a fictional chronology and two pages 
of thanks to imaginary sources and real friends, editors, agent, and perhaps a 
dedicatory inside joke or two. 
</P>
<P>
Eton Boone is set up to be not a waif but a blazing comet, of the 
beautiful-and-damned persuasion. His track is through the arts. He is a cabaret 
comic, author of the blackest and most corrosive social commentary, a super 
Lenny Bruce. He is an actor of rare gifts, a daring filmmaker, a talented 
playwright, and a novelist who excites his editor. 
</P>
<P>
None of these endeavors excites any wider public, outside of a circle of 
friends, lovers, and intellectual cognoscenti. The cabaret act -- Boone does 
what he calls "exposures" of political and entertainment figures -- does sell 
out for a while, but it has to close owing to an excess of corrosiveness that 
eats through its container. 
</P>
<P>
The reader, who gets transcripts of the "exposures," descriptions of the film 
and the play, and excerpts from the writing, is part of the wider and excluded 
public. The stuff is terrible. How do you generate excitement around the search 
for a bad artist? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, though, he was a fascinating personage. So the two dozen witnesses 
suggest. A number of them are lovers, both carnal and heavy-breathing Platonic. 
The two categories include Hugh, a brilliant and taste-making professor; John, 
a bookseller; Hilary, a step-brother; Harry, a journalist; Erin, a model, and 
others. There are friends who are just friends, though also overwrought, as 
well as mentors, critics, editors and impresarios. 
</P>
<P>
It's all paean and no proof. The Boone that comes through is oversexed, 
narcissistic, exploitative and vapid. He had a mother-fixation, and he 
witnessed his father's adultery and took an unwitting part in it. This is the 
key to the damned part; Boone ends up crashing a motorcycle and dying. As for 
the beautiful, there are no signs of it. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible, of course, for excitement to be generated around an empty 
figure. It is the doughnut principle. But this requires that the witnesses 
themselves possess qualities of passion, allure, and a gifted tongue. What 
makes "Boone" a pretentious and turgid chore is that none of its witnesses have 
anything to say, and they say it badly. We are at a party with nerds and 
babblers praising someone who hasn't showed up. Even Hugh, the professor who 
enchants his students, is a babbler. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh," he tells us, "it's the kind of tragedy that leads one to believe in some 
sort of divine being, that a man such as he be so targeted for pain." 
</P>
<P>
At the back of the chum-authors' minds, "Boone" seems likely to be intended as 
spoof, a parody of the artist-as-insider legend, and of the artist-insider, 
legend-celebrity industry. But a ponderous, badly written 362-page spoof? A 
knobby-legged, non-flying, 362-pound hummingbird? 
</P>

ERMA BOMBECK: SNAKES LEAVE HER A LITTLE RATTLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the time of year in Arizona when people look where they're going and 
walk on the sunny side of the rocks. It's stinking hot and it's snake time. 
</P>
<P>
We hear relatively few stories about snakebites, but Peter Aleshire reported an 
incredible story in the Arizona Republic the other day: A man was bitten on the 
tongue while kissing a rattlesnake. 
</P>
<P>
Now here's the weird part. He decided to try a non-scientific, quack-type 
remedy he had heard about to counteract snakebite. A word of caution: Do not 
try this in your own home. He'd heard that if you run an electrical current 
through the wound, it is supposed to break down the venom. So, after he was 
bitten, he wired his mouth to a pickup battery and tried to jump-start his 
tongue. It knocked him out cold, and he ended up in the hospital where he lost 
part of his tongue and one lip. My views on snakes are well known. I do not for 
a single minute believe they're as afraid of me as I am of them. They are not 
trying to get out of my way when they see me coming, and people who keep them 
around to keep the rodent population down should be heavily sedated. 
</P>
<P>
When my husband and I first moved to this state, we were invited one night to 
the town of Prescott to witness a festival celebrating Indian lore. It featured 
a group of men with snakes tattooed on their arms who performed the famous 
"Smoki Snake Dance." Our host was a "Smoki." 
</P>
<P>
As a couple of dozen men danced around a circle to the beat of a tom-tom, each 
dancer was given a snake (non-poisonous). He was to clench the snake between 
his teeth closely behind the head and just out of striking distance while he 
held the tail in his hand and waved it around as he kept the beat. 
</P>
<P>
When the dance was over, we went down to the field to say good night to our 
host. There was blood streaming down his face as he said, "Shoot, I got bit 
last year. Next year, I've got to get a better grip on him closer to the head." 
</P>
<P>
When I asked him where all the snakes had gone, he looked around him on the 
ground and said, "We just release 'em when we're finished. They're probably 
halfway to the parking lot by this time." 
</P>
<P>
The University of Arizona Poison Control Center was quoted as saying that most 
snakebites come from people kissing snakes, playing with them and handling them 
on a routine basis. 
</P>
<P>
Do you see a personality profile developing here anywhere?

'BOOMERANGERS' FIND THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME -- EVEN IF IT'S HOT, SMOGGY L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's the L.A. dream of the '90s. Cash out and leave. 
</P>
<P>
But beware. Before you head out to what you think will be a kinder, gentler 
life in more remote spots, listen to Everett Culp, Barbara DeWitt and Lisa 
Kamerman. 
</P>
<P>
They packed up and left behind the smog, the traffic, the high real estate 
prices, the crowds, the crime and the problem-ridden schools. They resettled in 
Seattle, Atlanta and Spokane, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
And they hated it. 
</P>
<P>
"People up there had minds like cement," said Culp, who resettled in Spokane. 
"All mixed up and permanently set." 
</P>
<P>
For him, the relocation dream turned into a nightmare. He and his family have 
come back to Los Angeles. Kamerman, who had moved to an Atlanta suburb, and 
DeWitt, who went to the Seattle area, hope to be back soon, too. 
</P>
<P>
They are the boomerang gang -- people who left Los Angeles, only to find that 
they missed it too much, and wanted to return even if it meant taking a 
financial drubbing. They are a tiny minority of those who move away from the 
city for financial or lifestyle reasons, according to local real estate agents. 
</P>
<P>
But they have cautionary tales to tell. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Everett Culp moved to the Pacific Northwest for his health. "I was 
working very hard at the time, too hard," said Culp, who lived in Glendale 
before the move. 
</P>
<P>
"My father had a heart problem and the way I was going, he was worried I would 
have one, too," said Culp, 46, who owned a successful lighting fixture and 
wiring supply company in Pasadena. He enjoyed the work, but the stress was 
getting to him. "He suggested that maybe we should leave L.A. and slow down." 
</P>
<P>
Culp and his wife had gone camping in central Oregon and loved the area. They 
moved north of there, just outside Spokane, Wash., (population 171,000, in 
1980) because that state has no personal income tax and because they wanted to 
live near a city. 
</P>
<P>
On many levels, their life in the Northwest was ideal. Culp's business ventures 
were successful -- he owned an outlet store for two years before selling the 
business for a tidy sum, then joined a mortgage banking firm. 
</P>
<P>
The couple bought and renovated two houses, the first was a 
7,000-square-foot-house on the Spokane River and the second, smaller house was 
on a lake. 
</P>
<P>
"When I would drive to work there were clouds in a blue sky, cattle in the 
fields," Culp said. "In the winter, after a snow, everything was so quiet, so 
beautiful. Breathtaking. 
</P>
<P>
"How could you not love it?" 
</P>
<P>
And Culp, who is deeply religious, thought he would fit well into the 
small-city atmosphere of Spokane. But fitting in was the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not a liberal person," he said, "but people in general and especially the 
church people up there were very, very conservative. Everything outside of what 
they considered normal was suspect, including some Christian groups we wanted 
to support. They loved guilt, that's what their religion was all about. So 
closed-minded. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, dancing was absolutely out of the question." 
</P>
<P>
Culp said that most of their good friends were also California transplants. 
"It's almost a cultural thing," he said. "We thought about things in a 
different way, we talked in a different way, we wanted to be with people who 
were like us." 
</P>
<P>
And finally, they found that they had not really escaped some of the worst 
problems of the city. "If you think there are not drugs in the schools there, 
forget it," he said. "It was a problem there like everywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the Culp family cashed out again and came back to Southern California, 
but buying a comparable house in Glendale was no longer possible.

"The home we had sold for $242,000 in 1980 was now probably worth 
three-quarters of a million," he said. That Glendale home is 3,600 square feet 
and has a pool. They found a home in La Verne, near Pomona, priced at about 
what they got for the Glendale home, but it has 2,200 feet and there is no 
pool.

Culp, who went back into the mortgage business until the real estate market 
softened, eventually took a job as administrator of Grace Baptist Church in 
Glendora.

"Whenever I hear someone say they are going to sell their house and move out," 
he said, "I tell them to not sell, whatever they do, for two years. They should 
rent out their house or even just let it sit there, but selling it is a 
mistake. You have to be sure that you won't want to come back." 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Kamerman, 23, and her husband liked everything about living in Los Angeles 
except the high price of housing. "It was just so expensive to rent, it was 
eating into our money, and we felt we were getting ripped off," said Kamerman, 
who was a sales clerk at a Robinson's department store and a delivery service 
courier. Her husband worked for a security firm. "Buying a place was just out 
of the question." 
</P>
<P>
So, a year ago March they moved to a development outside of Atlanta where they 
bought a new, three-bedroom house on an acre of land in a development that 
overlooks a national forest. The price of the home -- $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We made a bit less money here, but we worked less and we had a more 
comfortable lifestyle, so that was fine," she said, speaking from Atlanta. "The 
trouble was the people." 
</P>
<P>
Kamerman, who is English-born and lived in L.A. about five years before moving, 
had few nice things to say about Atlantans. "In Atlanta, everyone does 
everything the same way, there is no individuality," she said, "Especially the 
women. They all dress in those Laura Ashley outfits, they all furnish their 
homes the same way, they all think the same way, which is to say they don't 
think much at all. 
</P>
<P>
"I call them 'The Stepford Wives.' " 
</P>
<P>
Kamerman, who said she has not made close friends there, admits she is not the 
world's most sociable person. "But my husband can get along with anybody," she 
said, "and he hated it too." 
</P>
<P>
Her husband is already back in Los Angeles, working for his old firm. She 
stayed behind to try to sell their house, but plans to drive out here soon, 
whether it sells or not. They plan to buy a condo in the Woodland Hills area, 
which will likely cost a good deal more than $80,000. The vast majority of 
condos in Woodland Hills are of the townhouse variety and they are currently 
going for a minimum of about $170,000, according to Susan Mervyn of Lamb Realty 
in Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
"The money doesn't matter; we will deal with it," she said. "I have been all 
over the world and L.A. is where I want to live. There is such a blend of 
cultures there. There is no one true way to be. 
</P>
<P>
"You can be whoever you want to be. There is no pressure to fit in." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Brezina DeWitt, 42, is a Southern Californian, born and bred. But after 
she had a daughter in 1979, she and her husband started to think about moving 
on. "We thought that we should go somewhere where we could have a gentler 
life," said DeWitt, who was living in Redondo Beach before the move and worked 
as a free-lance writer, specializing in fashion and lifestyle features. 
</P>
<P>
Last year they finally moved to Edmonds, Wash., outside Seattle, which DeWitt 
describes as "a quaint, little seaside town." 
</P>
<P>
"But all of Washington is more quaint than I thought," she said with a laugh. " 
'Quaint' as in 'provincial.' " 
</P>
<P>
Her life is not bad there, but there are drawbacks, including the tiresome 
anti-Los Angeles bias prevalent in that part of the country and the gray 
weather much of the year. More important, she could not find full-time work in 
her field. But her husband has a good full-time job, the area is beautiful, the 
air clean and housing prices far more moderate. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, she is unhappy. She can't name anything specific that causes her 
distress; it's a lot of little things. 
</P>
<P>
"The clothes are much more conservative, which I notice because I write about 
these things. It's a little frustrating, if that is your field," she said. "I 
miss my friends, my family, walking on a sandy beach on a warm night, the place 
I got my hair done, washing the car on a Saturday afternoon without thinking it 
will probably rain, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, DeWitt is homesick. 
</P>
<P>
"Edmonds is a college town and it's sort of a nifty area," she said. "But it's 
not home. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be coming back."

HOW TO CHECK OUT A SCHOOL SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scores: Get the objective measures of the local school or schools in the 
district, such as California Assessment Program (CAP) scores, the percentage of 
students fulfilling state university college entrance requirements and the 
percentage of students who drop out of high school. This data is available from 
the district, or through the California State Board of Education, 916-445-9016. 
</P>
<P>
Report card: Call the local school to get a copy of the local school's 
state-mandated School Accountability Report Card, which includes information on 
student achievement, student attendance, expenditures and services, class size, 
teacher assignments and school facilities. 
</P>
<P>
School staff: Talk to the staff at a school in the district, meet with the 
principal and look over the literature the school regularly sends home to 
parents, such as the school bulletin. Ask what the school's major problems are 
and how they're being solved. Find out the school's philosophy about education, 
discipline and parent involvement. 
</P>
<P>
Network: Seek out parents with students in the district. Talk to the PTA 
president and to the chairman of any booster or parent association at your 
target school. 
</P>
<P>
Set priorities: Make a list of specific programs that are important to your 
children, such as band, drama, art, science, speech therapy and athletics and 
find out what the district offers.

SALUTE TO AN IDEA MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frank Lloyd Wright did not need to design a house for Ayn Rand or be 
fictionalized as Howard Roark in "The Fountainhead" in order to be remembered, 
but the fact he was seems salient. He was born to an era that produced 
larger-than-life personalities ranging the cultural spectrum from James Joyce 
to Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the Pablos -- Picasso and Casals. 
</P>
<P>
Wright certainly left a personal myth, but it rests on a foundation of 
unforgettable architectural images etched in the collective mind -- from the 
levitating balconies of "Falling Water" to the conch-shell spiral of the 
Guggenheim Museum. His memory lives vividly in Los Angeles because of the 
Hollyhock House in Barnsdall Park and -- more recently -- because of his 
apparent influence on Bruce Goff's design for the new Japanese pavilion at the 
County Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
Wright's place as a keystone of the modernist movement was already solidly 
established when he died in 1959 at age 92, and it has never budged. One can 
not, however, remember the last major exhibition devoted to his work. 
</P>
<P>
Now there is a welcome one visiting the San Diego Museum of Art through August. 
Called "Frank Lloyd Wright in the Realm of Ideas," it does two things very 
well: It provides a chance for a fresh take on his legacy and it solves the 
most besetting problem of architectural exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
Normally such shows let us down because no number of drawings, models, and 
photomurals quite make up for the lack of real buildings. Here you have the 
authentic thing -- erected in front of the museum -- in the form of one of 
Wright's '50s designs for what he called his "Usonian Automatic Houses." They 
were intended to provide custom-built dwellings at moderate cost. Walking 
around in it is more fun -- and provides a livelier sense of the Wrightian 
aesthetic -- than a barn full of documentation. 
</P>
<P>
And what was Wright's aesthetic? As everyone familiar with his work knows, he 
was very big on Organic Architecture. This is not architecture grown in a 
health-food store . . . but sort of. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most striking things about Wright's work is its apparent 
eclecticism. He seems to have worked in as many varied manners as Picasso. 
Wright once romanced the Romanesque, remembering his early mentor Louis 
Sullivan. Despite his undeniable modernity, elements of updated Craftsman style 
come out in much of his furniture. A pared-down sense of traditional Japanese 
recurs, but not in the concrete block buildings that look decidedly 
pre-Columbian. If we decide firmly he was an avant-gardist with roots in the 
past, he trips up the idea with designs that would look right at home in "Star 
Trek." His proposal for a Xanadu pleasure dome for Huntington Hartford looks 
like it should be called "Overflowing Saucers." 
</P>
<P>
The rationale for all of this is that Wright first decided the traditional 
box-shaped building was too confining. Beginning with his 1906 Larkin Building 
he tried to "beat the box" and never looked back. That done, he became what 
today would be called a "site-specific" artist, tailoring each structure to the 
lay of the land. He also tried to respond to materials -- including modern 
innovations like reinforced steel and concrete -- seeking the solution to his 
design problems within the problem itself. 
</P>
<P>
His best results, like the prairie houses and Taliesan, have astonishing 
internal integrity and are utterly integral to their surroundings. Well, not 
quite. They become romantic gestures of stylish unity with the land. One 
admires details like his Constructivist-Deco windows even as they give him away 
as a mandarin exquisite. 
</P>
<P>
Wright was a genius with facets. If he exploded the box he never forgot the 
cave, the tepee, the mosque and the temple, marking himself as an Exotic Noble 
Savage. In his Techno-Islamic phase he designed an Arizona State Capital that 
one is jolly glad was never built. 
</P>
<P>
What comes across most strongly about Wright today is his visionary 
romanticism. He had grand ideas about American democracy that outstripped 
either geography or politics and entered the realm of metaphysical fantasy. In 
that sense he was an inheritor of Antonio Gaudi and a forerunner of Paolo 
Soleri. Wright was very concerned about his artistic progeny, but there are 
very few direct Wrightian inheritors today. That's partly because he was a very 
hard act to follow and partly because he was individualistic to the point of 
idiosyncrasy. 
</P>
<P>
The Usonian house in front of the museum looks at once striking and 
domesticated with its chunky gray block construction, but the minute you're 
inside it feels a trifle odd. Everything is organized along a single long 
corridor that runs the length of the facade, beginning with the kitchen and 
ending with the master bathroom, which has no door. Bedrooms and a study off 
the tunnel-like axial corridor are beautifully detailed, but so underscaled 
they feel like steamship staterooms. 
</P>
<P>
By marked contrast, a copious terrace and high-ceilinged living room force the 
sculptural contrast of spatial sizes. It's artistically dramatic, but does make 
one long for more harmonious distribution of emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
Glib psycho-architectural observers have traced Wright's love of contrasting 
spaces and ceiling heights to the fact he was himself small of stature and 
inclined to design for his own bodily dimensions. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the truth, Wright's houses tend to exaggerate a problem inherent in 
most structures designed by modern architects with great talent and strong 
convictions. The buildings may be things of artistic joy, but they never become 
the spiritual dwellings of the inhabitants. No matter who owns them they always 
belong to the architect.

JENI'S SPONTANEITY ADDS BITE TO HIS TRUSTED BITS 
</P>

Richard Jeni showed at the Improvisation on Tuesday that he has, among other 
assets, one of the comic's most valued assets -- the ability to appear fresh, 
even when the material may already be known to an audience. 
</P>
<P>
Like most stand-up performers, Jeni relies on a cache of trusted routines honed 
through repeat performances. But unlike those who are hampered by the 
predictability of their jokes, Jeni at his best seems to add to them, 
developing a sense of spontaneity that registers beyond the familiar. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for instance, his signature bit on "Jaws IV." The set-piece about the 
absurd plot holes and other stupidities in that silly sequel has become a 
trademark, a riff he frequently relies on during his frequent TV appearances. 
</P>
<P>
It goes like this: This ambitious shark has eaten a woman's family. In full 
retreat, she catches a plane for the Bahamas. The shark figures this out and 
follows her there. Jeni approaches this ridiculousness from the perspective of 
the average Joe watching the movie on cable in the early morning. 
</P>
<P>
Smacking his forehead incredulously, he wonders why she went to the Bahamas 
instead of, say, Canada, a country not known for shark problems? "Wouldn't her 
apartment be sufficient protection from the average shark? By the time he found 
the building, parked the car in the shark place, got in the elevator and came 
to the door, you would most likely smell fish and split." 
</P>
<P>
While the lines may not come across that funny in print, it's what Jeni is 
doing on stage that makes it work. He's a very animated performer with precise 
timing and the good sense to linger on a subject, letting it expand at its own 
pace but with nice actorly punctuations. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it's a little ironic that Jeni has become such a frequent presence on 
TV, especially on "The Tonight Show." On television, his bits often come across 
as restrained and generic. But in a club, with an hour to build his themes, 
he's another comic altogether. 
</P>
<P>
A former New Yorker with the requisite East Coast edge, Jeni brings a 
cartoonish anxiety to most of his routines, such as the one on getting into 
fights. First he told the crowd about the time he was in a Southern bar and a 
big cracker punched him out. No foreplay -- just one shot in the face and he 
was gazing at the bottom of his bar stool. 
</P>
<P>
Then, he contrasted that with what it's like fighting in New York. There's 
"plenty of time to figure out if you want to be in a fight" because of the 
verbal dancing that goes on before the bell rings. Mainly, you threaten a lot, 
hoping the other guy will back down. 
</P>
<P>
Arms flailing, eyes popping, Brooklyn accent percolating, Jeni told the other 
dude just what might happen: "Hey! I'll rip off your ear and stick it on your 
knee so any time you wanna hear somebody you'll have to lift your knee up to 
their face!" 
</P>
<P>
He also talked about smoking. Marlboros, Jeni noted, are for people who say "I 
want a tumor and I'm in a bit of a rush." As for his own problems with smoking 
in front of nonsmokers, he said they tend to give him a look like "Why don't 
you just relieve yourself on the children?" 
</P>
<P>
He also talked about the differences between men and women. There was the 
specific, such as what they look for in a restroom ("I've never done anything 
in a bathroom that required a pink couch") to the general, like birthing ("You 
think you understand women? C'mon, they have babies on purpose!"). 
</P>
<P>
He even talked about Cher and her questionable taste. "She's got this giant 
tattoo on her (derriere). I wish someone had the nerve to say 'Hey, we're 
trying to eat a burger over here!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Jeni performs tonight through Thursday at 8:30 p.m.; Friday at 8:30 
p.m. and 10:30 p.m.; Saturday at 8 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. and Sunday at 8:30 p.m.

EVERYONE WINS AT THE JIM HALL INVITATIONAL

This is the time for that annual nine-day wonder known as the JVC Jazz 
Festival. It is a time when critics moan about the use of non-jazz acts while 
producer George Wein groans about the shortage of young musicians and the 
difficulty of attracting audiences. It is also a time when the public proves 
them all wrong, by crowding into concert halls to salute artists of all ages. 
Nowhere was this more evident than at the Jim Hall Invitational Tuesday at Town 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, 59, has long been respected for his guitar mastery and lack of 
exhibitionism. The host, Pat Metheny, observed that Hall's influence has 
extended even to those who have gone on to develop radically different styles. 
</P>
<P>
The evening presented him in a dozen settings, from impeccably executed duos 
(with bassist Ron Carter, saxophonist Gerry Mulligan and valve trombonist Bob 
Brookmeyer) to a semi-classical ensemble that included a string quartet. His 
assurance that he had a "non-proliferation" treaty with the other guitarist, to 
avoid excessive volume, was faithfully remembered by all hands. 
</P>
<P>
Hall ventured from shallow waters (a cheerful ukulele-like strumming on "St. 
Thomas" with Ron Carter) to deep experimentation, in an acerbic and atonal 
work, untitled, written 35 years ago when he was a student. The latter was one 
of three numbers with the Classical Heritage string ensemble, which also 
performed a rather turgid piece, "Abstract and Dreams," with composer Don 
Thompson at the piano, as well as a fascinating item called "Laura's Dream" 
that teamed Hall with the four mallets of vibist Gary Burton. 
</P>
<P>
Written by Argentina's Astor Piazzola, this was the climactic closer of the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Hall worked mainly in tandem with other guitarists, two of whom spurred 
him on to some of his most creative moments. John Scofield, in a 180-degree 
switch from funk back to jazz, drew spirited and aggressive mainstream sounds 
from a solid-body guitar and had Hall responding in time. On a more restrained 
level, Pat Metheny proved to be a soulmate for Hall as he brought a keening, 
mournful air to the Brazilian standard "How Insensitive" before the pair burst 
into a hard-driving series of exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
Hall's regular quartet was weakened by the unswinging piano of Gil Goldstein 
and the mood-shattering drum interlude by Terry Clarke. He seemed more at home 
trading choruses with his promising 20-year-old guitar student, Peter 
Bernstein. 
</P>
<P>
For his finale, Hall fielded a 10-man band that included guitarists Bernstein, 
John Abercrombie, Mick Goodrick (playing a headless and almost bodyless guitar) 
and Scofield. To his credit, instead of jamming on a conventional blues they 
played a Hall composition, "Careful." The title seemed especially fitting for 
an evening that had clearly been planned with loving care.

Beefed Over Beef: k.d. lang's songs have been banned from a Lexington, Neb., 
radio station because of her anti-beef bias. "Under no circumstances will 
anyone on this staff be allowed to play any music by k.d. lang until such time 
as she publicly renounces her ties with People for the Ethical Treatment of 
Animals and her fanatic anti-meat philosophy," station KRVN said in a 
statement. lang, a 1990 Grammy winner, will appear in TV commercials for a 
PETA-sponsored campaign called Meat Stinks.

"If you knew how meat was made, you'd probably lose your lunch," lang, a 
vegetarian since 1981, says in the commercials. "I know -- I'm from cattle 
country. That's why I became a vegetarian. Meat stinks and not just for animals 
but for human health and the environment." GREG BRAXTON

STAGE WATCH: SUMMER SCHOOL IN SESSION FOR LATC STUDY GROUP; 
</P>
<P>
DOWNTOWN: THE 11-MEMBER PANEL IS CHARGED WITH FIGURING OUT HOW TO ENSURE 'THE 
PERMANENT SURVIVAL OF THEATER' ON SPRING STREET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The 11 people who could determine the future of Los Angeles Theatre Center met 
for lunch in Mayor Tom Bradley's office Monday and began their summer-long 
deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
Appointed by Bradley a month ago, this group was charged with figuring out how 
to ensure "the permanent survival of theater" in the Spring Street building 
that houses LATC. The Community Redevelopment Agency has said that it can no 
longer afford LATC's facilities and debt. The LATC estimates that those costs 
-- including the creation of an endowment -- could total $32 million over the 
next five years. 
</P>
<P>
"None of those people would be sitting there (at the Monday luncheon) if they 
felt that any of this were pre-judged," said William Wingate, the consultant 
who will conduct the research for the study group, after the meeting. "The 
mayor said, 'Don't feel there are any sacred cows here.' " 
</P>
<P>
Asked to briefly speculate about how the facility costs might be reduced, 
Wingate replied, "If the city had the expense of keeping only one theater 
(instead of four) open a certain number of weeks (instead of year-round), the 
facilities costs might look very different." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, LATC could be a shadow of its former self if the money isn't 
found to maintain the building and pay its debt service. 
</P>
<P>
"We would disagree that there would be a cost savings in that solution," said 
LATC managing director Robert Lear. Keeping only one theater open "would 
provide us with less revenue," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Asked where additional facilities money might come from, if not from the CRA, 
Wingate replied, "I have no idea. I don't know enough about the city 
bureaucracy to know" if other branches of city government might be able to fill 
the gap. Wingate added that "it is not this group's task to find those 
potential funding sources" -- though its members will "try to identify all 
reasonable options." 
</P>
<P>
Wingate, who left his job as executive managing director of Center Theatre 
Group in 1988 and moved to New York, said he saw "only a couple of productions" 
at LATC before his departure. But he did serve on National Endowment for the 
Arts theater panels, which reviewed LATC grant applications, including a term 
as chairman in 1986. At the time, he recalled, "there was some question of the 
ongoing viability of LATC. But those questions have recently been laid to rest. 
Certainly the balance sheet (of LATC itself, apart from the facilities costs) 
looks much better than it ever has."

LBCLO TO LACLO?: Martin Wiviott and Keith Stava, the pair of producers who 
resigned from Long Beach Civic Light Opera last week, are in talks with the 
Nederlander Organization over the possibility of programming the Los Angeles 
Civic Light Opera, according to both Stava and the Nederlanders' West Coast 
president, Stan Seiden. 
</P>
<P>
A NEW CONTRACT: Actors' Equity's Western Advisory Board will be asked to 
approve a new Hollywood Area Theatre contract, covering theaters with between 
100 and 500 seats, at its July 5 meeting. The contract could go into effect as 
early as August, said George Ives, the union's incoming Western regional 
director. 
</P>
<P>
The contract will call for graduated pay scales, with minimums increasing as 
capacities expand in increments of 100 seats. The old Hollywood Area Theatre 
contract "is not responsive to producers in smaller theaters," said Ives. "They 
need contracts more tailored to those venues." 
</P>
<P>
Ives said some of the producers who frequently use the town's mid-sized 
theaters were consulted in the drafting of the contract. Not consulted were 
officials of Associated Theatres of Los Angeles (ATLAS), the producers' 
organization that broke off talks with Equity on this issue a year ago. Ives 
said ATLAS represents producers in sub-100-seat venues "who may wish sometime 
to move a show" into a mid-sized house. "It's difficult to treat them as the 
correct bargaining unit; they're not active in the field." 
</P>
<P>
ATLAS chairwoman Laura Zucker said this disregard of ATLAS follows "the Equity 
pattern of trying to unilaterally promulgate a contract." Nevertheless, she 
approves of many of this contract's features, adding that the seating-capacity 
scales and breaks for large-cast shows actually grew out of ATLAS suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
However, she said the draft of the contract, as read to her over the telephone 
by Ives, "ignored all the flexibility issues" that had been discussed in the 
talks with Equity. ATLAS sought to permit fewer performances and/or rehearsals 
per week than this contract would allow. ATLAS members won't sign the new 
contract, she predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Ives responded that the producers he did consult were not concerned about 
flexibility. If ATLAS members want more flexible schedules, he said, "they can 
always negotiate for special concessions" for individual productions. 
</P>
<P>
DE OBEAH MON: Equity will send cease-and-desist letters to three of its members 
who are appearing in "De Obeah Mon," at the Westwood Playhouse, and will ask 
the Screen Actors Guild to send similar letters to two of its members who are 
in the show, said Equity's Ives. The producers of the show are operating 
without an Equity contract.

GOURMET KIDS: YOU COME TO THE DINNER TABLE AND FIND IT'S FOIE GRAS AND ARUGULA 
AGAIN, AND YOUR FAMOUS CHEF DAD SAYS YOU HAVE TO EAT IT OR YOU'RE GOING 
STRAIGHT TO YOUR ROOM. THE UNAPPRECIATED TRIALS OF BEING THE CHILD OF A 
GOURMET.

Ethnic Kitchen series for Harper &amp; Row.

<TEXT>
<P>
As a cookbook writer, I had high hopes for my son Joey. But at 7 he let me have 
it. As I proudly placed yet another exotic dinner in front of him, he 
announced, "I am no gourmet." 
</P>
<P>
I took the news badly. Wasn't this the same kid who told the pediatrician at 
his third-year check-up that his favorite TV show was "Master Chefs of New 
York"? For weeks he begged me to carve his potatoes into little wooden shoes 
like the nice man in the white suit from Lutece. His chocolate has always been 
from France, his pasta from Italy and his mozzarella fresh. Was this his way of 
repaying me? 
</P>
<P>
I'm not the only cookbook writer with a problem. According to Paula Wolfert, 
author of, among other books, "Couscous and Other Good Food From Morocco," her 
young children were adventurous eaters when they grew up in France and Morocco. 
They ate everything she gave them including fresh sardines and baby eels. 
</P>
<P>
As long as they didn't know what they were eating everything was fine. However, 
when daughter Leila learned one of her favorite foods was deep-fried lamb's 
testicles she put her foot down. "Oh Mommy, why do you do this to us?" 
</P>
<P>
If these kids have it bad though, what about the children of great restaurant 
chef's? Imagine Ben and Vanessa Peel, ages 5 and 7, of Campanile and La Brea 
Bakery. Adults may stand in line and pay top dollar for the joy of biting into 
those crusty loaves. Ben and Vanessa don't care. They hate the crust. 
</P>
<P>
Vanessa, who became agitated at the suggestion of ingesting crust, told a 
reporter her method for dealing with it: She slaps a slice over her mouth, then 
she sucks out the dough, sort of like a vacuum cleaner, and quickly transfers 
the hard part to her fist, under the table. There she wads it into a ball and 
disposes of it . . . when nobody's watching, of course. 
</P>
<P>
Ben too views the crust as an obstacle to the good part. He takes one strong 
bite to break it open and flings it aside when done. Of course, they both hate 
bread with "things in it. You know like olives, figs, onions or cherries." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the children of chefs do have discerning palates. Benoit Healy, age 5, 
whose parents Patrick and Sophie Healy own the elegant French restaurant 
Champagne, ate at the renowned Jamin when he visited Paris with his parents 
last summer. To him, foie gras is "better than Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
When asked where the food was better, in Los Angeles or Paris, he replied with 
typical Gallic certainty, "Of course, here is better. Because McDonald's is 
here." 
</P>
<P>
When his father demanded whether he would prefer the food at Champagne if it 
came packed in cardboard, Benoit was unintimidated. He wouldn't answer. 
</P>
<P>
When these kids do eat out they tend to favor places a bit earthier than their 
parent's. McDonald's, Jay's Burgers, Johnny Rockets, Hamburger That Ate L.A., 
Canter's and the Farmer's Market all get four stars. They prefer places where 
they can run around and scream, something their parents do not allow in tonier 
establishments. 
</P>
<P>
Christophe Richard, age 6, of Citrus restaurant, however, loves his father 
Michel's new Broadway Deli. He recommends the macaroni and cheese. 
</P>
<P>
At home, though the cooking may be better than most, children everywhere are 
faced with the same old problem. How to get through the meal to get to the good 
part: dessert. Although most chef's children have tasted foods as sophisticated 
as sushi, oysters, caviar, calamari and foie gras, they sometimes feel like 
sending their dinners back. 
</P>
<P>
At the home of Fresco's chef/owner Antonio Orlando, sons Donato, 9, and 
Giovanni, 7, must explain why they don't like Dad's cooking before they get 
their nightly helping of lemon meringue pie, tiramisu or castello (a chocolate 
mousse-and-meringue cake). 
</P>
<P>
This doesn't happen often though with Giovanni, who is an adventurous eater. 
For his birthday last year, his father brought home a pig, stuffed it with 
herbs and garlic and then roasted it on the outdoor barbecue. Giovanni 
remembers it fondly. 
</P>
<P>
Michel Richard also takes a direct approach to feeding his brood. When 
Christophe doesn't like something he tells him, "Eat it." According to 
Christophe he must take as many as 15 bites before he can dig into dessert. In 
order to force down Richard's food, he masks the flavors with plenty of apple 
juice. 
</P>
<P>
A typical dessert chez Richard is vanilla yogurt, coffee ice cream or 
Pepperidge Farm jumbo chocolate chip cookies. Michel's favorites. 
</P>
<P>
At Alice Waters' home, daughter Fanny, age 7, need only take one bite of any 
food she objects to. This doesn't happen often though, since Waters tailors her 
cooking to Fanny's tastes. From the time her daughter was born, Waters has 
chosen the very best of the best for her. She would examine every peach at her 
restaurant, Chez Panisse, to find the best one for infant Fanny. Of course, 
Fanny may go into culture shock when she tastes her first supermarket tomato. 
</P>
<P>
Waters, who is working on a children's cookbook, may be on to something. On our 
last trip to the Bay area, my son, the anti-gourmet, declared the grapefruit at 
Waters' Cafe Fanny "fantastic." Now if I can just get the name of her supplier 
maybe he'll eat grapefruit at our house. 
</P>
<P>
 Benoit Healy, of Champagne, is also a knowledgeable cook. During our interview 
he described in perfect detail the method for melting chocolate in a double 
boiler. Here is his formula for blueberry cookies. 
</P>
<P>
BENOIT'S BLUEBERRY COOKIES 
</P>
<P>
2 cups flour 
</P>
<P>
1 cup powdered sugar 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup, plus 2 tablespoons, ground almonds 
</P>
<P>
Dash salt 
</P>
<P>
10 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened 
</P>
<P>
1 egg, beaten 
</P>
<P>
40 blueberries 
</P>
<P>
Combine flour, powdered sugar, ground almonds and salt in mixing bowl. Stir and 
toss with fork. 
</P>
<P>
Beat in butter until well-blended. Add beaten egg and mix just until combined. 
Form into ball, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Break off small pieces dough, about size of walnut. Roll between palms. Press 
to flatten. Place on lightly floured baking sheet, about 2 inches apart. With 
tip of pinky finger, press tiny indent in center. Fill with 1 blueberry. (For 
apricot or jelly filling, form larger cavity with tip of teaspoon.) 
</P>
<P>
Bake at 350 degrees until edges are golden, about 12 minutes. Cool on racks. 
Makes about 40 cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasta with butter and cheese is Ben Peel's standby at his dad's Campanile, 
where they make it for him without the herbs. 
</P>
<P>
LINGUINE WITH BUTTER AND CHEESE 
</P>
<P>
1/2 pound linguine 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
Freshly grated Parmesan cheese 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
Cook linguine in boiling salted water until al dente. Drain well in colander. 
Cut butter into 1/2 tablespoon pieces and place 2 tablespoons in bottom of 
pasta bowl. Place pasta in pasta bowl. Toss well. Add 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese 
and remaining butter pieces and toss some more. Season to taste with salt and 
serve warm with additional Parmesan cheese. Makes 2 servings.

NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: WHAT KIDS SHOULD EAT: THE FREE-CHOICE OPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONI TIPTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hands-off parenting at the dinner table is currently being promoted by some 
dietitians. The thinking is that restrictive diets, or those that pressure 
youngsters into eating healthy foods, can interfere with a child's innate 
capacity to regulate calorie consumption. Later in life, this usually results 
in a preference for high-fat foods, which have been linked to diseases such as 
heart disease and cancer. 
</P>
<P>
But there are plenty of experts who still believe hands-on parental 
intervention is vital. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's the parents' responsibility to put the child on the correct 
eating track," says Gail Frank, a spokesperson for the American Dietetic Assn. 
and a Cal State University professor of nutrition. "This (early direction) 
forms the basis for the child's taste buds and the child's perception of what 
an OK or non-OK eating behavior is." 
</P>
<P>
After all, as Frank points out, kids don't live in an isolated environment in 
which only nutritious foods will be offered, and they aren't always going to be 
under a parent's guidance. 
</P>
<P>
But others feel that parental pressure to eat certain kinds of food can do more 
nutritional harm than good. 
</P>
<P>
"Rewarding kids for cleaning their plates or pressuring them into eating foods 
parents believe are nutritionally vital can be a problem," says Leann Lipps 
Birch, Ph.D, a University of Illinois professor of human development and 
nutrition sciences. "When you focus the child on cleaning his or her plate, you 
limit the child's ability to use hunger and satiety to control eating, (and 
inadvertently) contribute to the development of eating disorders and obesity 
later in life." 
</P>
<P>
Ellyn Satter, a registered dietitian specializing in children's feeding and 
eating, agrees. Force feeding of foods with a perceived benefit, she says, can 
lead to finickiness, poor growth and battles about food in the short term, and 
more serious health problems in adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
"Children are capable of regulating their food intake," Satter says. "They have 
a wisdom greater than ours about what is good for them and what they need to 
grow properly. If you present them with a variety of food, they are cabable of 
picking and choosing and learning to like a nutritionally adequate diet." 
</P>
<P>
Satter and Birch base their hands-off philosophy on infant research done in the 
'20s and '30s by a pediatrician named Clara Davis. She found that kids, up to 
about age 4 1/2, will eat the right food combinations for good health and 
sufficient growth -- if left to follow their own cravings. She did admit, 
though, that her data was based on an "artificial environment." Getting kids to 
choose a nutritionally adequate diet was dependent upon the parent offering 
only foods of high nutrient value. Adding sweets would change the results. 
</P>
<P>
Although there's been no research with older children, Birch believes that the 
mechanism could be retained as the child ages if parents wouldn't interfere 
with the process. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the chance to select from among an array of healthful foods," Birch 
says, "children can naturally choose the combinations of foods in amounts 
consistent with adequate nutrition. (Of course), first they must have access to 
those foods." 
</P>
<P>
However, Dr. Ronald Kleinman, associate professor of pediatrics at Harvard 
Medical School and chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on 
Nutrition, questions the existence of this inherent knack to control caloric 
intake. "I honestly don't know if (children) have an innate ability to chose 
healthy food or not," Kleinman says. "And, I'm not sure that it's terribly 
important to know. There are so many other influences on what a youngster eats 
that an innate ability may not be able to exercise itself." 
</P>
<P>
Both Kleinman and the ADA's Frank point to advertisements and peer pressure 
from siblings and friends that strongly affect what kids eat. Unlike infants, 
who eat whatever they are given, older children choose what they eat according 
to the outside cues around them. 
</P>
<P>
"There is enough evidence that the ability is there early on," Birch insists. 
"It just gets socialized out. Parents basically teach kids to ignore internal 
cues." 
</P>
<P>
She and Satter believe that overambitious parental intervention -- usually in 
the form of pressure to eat fewer foods with fat and cholesterol and more foods 
with a perceived health benefit, attaches a negative quality to the 
good-for-you foods. 
</P>
<P>
Food in the "bad-for-you" category, typically are sweet items, serve as 
pacifiers and treats. This, Birch says, sets up an uncontrollable preference 
for forbidden food, and a dislike for "health" food. Eventually the sweet is 
associated with satisfaction in the child's mind. He or she grows up trying to 
avoid the prohibited food and adulthood binging and other eating disorders are 
the result. 
</P>
<P>
"You want kids to eat things that are good for them so you say, 'OK, eat your 
broccoli, Johnny, and then I'll give you some chocolate ice cream.' It works 
really well," Birch says, "but kids learn to like ice cream even more than they 
did before. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, kids like sweets," Birch admits, "but there are some other things that 
are going on that I think tend to potentiate our liking to sweetness. They are 
desserts -- they come as rewards for having eaten the other things on your 
plate. And they tend to be associated within a holiday context." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than an emphasis on "good" and "bad" food, Satter and Birch suggest that 
parents offer children a wide assortment of wholesome foods selected from among 
the Four Food Groups: low-fat dairy products, meat and meat alternatives, 
fruits and vegetables and whole grain breads and cereals. 
</P>
<P>
Satter recommends a division of responsibility between children and parents 
when it comes to mealtime. The parent should be responsible for what the child 
is offered to eat and the child for whether and how much of it they eat. 
</P>
<P>
Kleinman tends to agree with Satter and Birch that overly strict early diet 
rules aren't necessary, and that providing a balanced diet from a variety of 
wholesome sources is valid. But, he says, simply supplying these wholesome 
sources is not the best approach to eliminating eating disorders and chronic 
disease in adults. 
</P>
<P>
"The notion that you have to stay within a range (of foods) isn't one worth 
promoting," he says. It doesn't teach the child to interact in a realistic 
environment. "These ('bad') foods are out there," he says, "and there's no 
reason why they shouldn't be in the home." 
</P>
<P>
"What is important is that there is a wide tolerance for food in terms of what 
will permit a youngster to grow and what won't," he says. "Some have diets, for 
example, that are exceedingly rich in protein, more than 15%, or (on the other 
hand) less than 7%, and in both cases youngsters may grow reasonably well." 
</P>
<P>
Kleinman's advice is to expose children to both high- and low-fat foods -- 
especially sweets -- within a balanced diet. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to find any convincing evidence that anyone eating a candy bar is 
doing themselves any harm, provided they have vitamins, iron and protein in the 
diet," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Gail Frank suggests that parents serve as role models -- not supervisors. 
Adults should avoid giving mixed signals and practice moderation too. They 
should not provide a negative impression for the child. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents beware," Frank says, "If you are couch potatoes, then your children 
may become Tater Tots." 
</P>
<P>
What follows is a three-day menu, developed by the Dairy Council of California, 
designed to meet the 1989 Recommended Dietary Allowances for vitamins, minerals 
and protein for a 9-year-old boy. It supplies about 1,700 calories per day and 
adheres to the American Heart Assn. recommendations for dietary fat and 
cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
The American Academy of Pediatrics has stated that that the AHA diet, which 
supplies about 30% of the total calories as fat, is too restrictive for 
children older than age two. The Academy recommends a range of 30% to 40% 
calories as fat. 
</P>
<P>
For flexibility, and to add extra fat recommended by AAP, substitute whole fat 
dairy products for the low-fat selections given. Or, include a favorite treat 
to increase the fat intake slightly.

ABOUT WINE: THERE'S NO ROOM FOR FLAWS IN 'CLASSIC' VINTAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recently I have come to realize that some so-called "great" wines, praised by 
influential wine people, are pretty strange and far from classic. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, I wonder whether some of these influential wine personalities aren't 
doing consumers a disservice by cooing and gurgling over wine that is 
eccentric, if not downright flawed. I wonder whether they aren't educating the 
public to like styles of wine that are atypical, not truly great at all. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the wines I question have a tiny flaw I feel shouldn't be there, 
considering the high price; in other cases I've found the flaw to be so strong 
that it covered up whatever grace the wine might have had. Wine with the aroma 
of wet earth, rotting meat, nail polish or skunkiness is not my idea of fun. 
</P>
<P>
Some evaluators who taste the wines within sight of the labels, and thus know 
what the wines cost, give expensive wines very high scores on the theory such a 
high-priced wine simply can't have much wrong with it. Thus extraneous aromas 
and flavors can't be flaws. (Moreover, to mark such an expensive wine with a 
low score might prove embarrassing.) 
</P>
<P>
Yet when I've done blind tastings of famous name wines, I occasionally find 
extraneous elements in them that are so strange as to make the wines 
unrepresentative of their type and thus not in the "classic" category at all. 
Often, recently, the most expensive wines have had serious flaws. I wouldn't 
drink a couple of these wines if they were given to me, and I'm outraged at 
paying $50 to $75 and more for wines that are dull or even downright bad. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Ponomareff, editor/publisher of the California Grapevine, noted this trend 
in the April-May issue of his privately published wine newsletter. Ponomareff, 
a mild-mannered aerospace engineer, in a most atypical (for him), strongly 
worded commentary, wrote that in the 15 years of publishing his newsletter he 
has not commented on a winery's pricing policy. 
</P>
<P>
Yet he said that a number of expensive wines evaluated blind by the Grapevine 
panel were not very good and not worth their high prices. I concur. 
</P>
<P>
Recently I tasted the 1985 Guigal Cote-Rotie "La Mouline," which sells for 
about $200 a bottle. I found it to have a horsy, wet-leather kind of smell 
about it, sort of like meat aging in a meat locker. This aroma was probably 
generated by a yeast called Brettanomyces (Bret for short) that some people 
like. I don't, not when it's as strong as it is in this wine. 
</P>
<P>
This has been rated a perfect wine by some evaluators. Perhaps they are not 
bothered by this wet horse-blanket aroma, but California wine makers who tasted 
this wine with me said they didn't like it, either. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly this is a matter of taste, but to rank the wine as perfect seems a 
little odd. 
</P>
<P>
A similar problem, Brettanomyces, seems to infect other wines, like 1985 Phelps 
"Eisele" Cabernet and the famed Dominus wines; traces of it appear to be in the 
1985 Stag's Leap Cask 23. These wines are all expensive, ranging from $40 a 
bottle to $75 for the Stag's Leap. 
</P>
<P>
Am I being a purist, a technician, when I say the aroma should have no "Bret"? 
I think not. Not at these prices. And many wine makers agree that this level of 
"Bret" is unacceptable in wines of this price. 
</P>
<P>
When wines get this lofty in price, they should be as clean and as classical as 
is the 1985 Caymus Special Selection Cabernet, one of the truly magnificent 
wines of the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, other flaws irk me. The Dominus wines and the 1985 Dunn Howell 
Mountain Cabernet are examples of wines I feel are so tannic it may be decades 
before they're ready to drink. The 1987 Diamond Creek Cabernets are bizarre 
wines with aromas and flavors I don't associate with Cabernet. The Stag's Leap 
Cask 23 has a foul weediness I dislike. 
</P>
<P>
Even the acclaimed 1985 Heitz Martha's Vineyard Cabernet bothers me, as it does 
the Grapevine panel. In various blind tastings, we have detected a certain 
musty quality. It may well fade into the background with time in the bottle, 
but today the wine has scored poorly in blind tastings. I spoke with Joe Heitz 
about this and he denies there's a problem with the wine. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, none of the California wines listed above is flawed because of 
intent to deceive on the part of the wine makers. I feel that in some cases the 
winery was simply unaware of the problem; in other cases the winery liked the 
wine so much, as it was, they hoped no one would see the flaw as a flaw. 
</P>
<P>
Bad wine isn't always an honest mistake. Fraud in the European wine trade is 
fairly common, and by no means new. Fraud has occurred for centuries there, 
fueled more by greedy merchants than scurrilous producers. 
</P>
<P>
Three books have come out in the last few years, all written by British 
authors, on the irregularities in the European wine trade throughout the 
decades. They are "Wine Scandal," by Fritz Hallgarten (Wine Appreciation Guild, 
$16.95), "Anatomy of the Wine Trade," by Simon Loftus (Harper &amp; Row, 
$15.95), and one of the best, "Is This the Wine You Ordered, Sir?" by 
Christopher Fielden (Faber &amp; Faber, $19.95). 
</P>
<P>
The latter is subtitled "The Dark Side of the Wine Trade," and contains a 
reason Fielden thinks may be at the heart of the problem: "Sadly, it may be 
that the consumer does not expect too much from his wine . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The Grapevine's Ponomareff concluded his warning: "The most puzzling aspect of 
all this is that the wineries are having no problem selling these suspect wines 
at such ludicrous prices. The pronouncement of greatness by a wine critic 
certainly helps to fuel this buying frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
"We are troubled that some of California's finest wineries are putting out 
wines that appeared to us to be flawed. We are distressed that these wineries 
are setting exaggerated prices based on the reputation of a vineyard or a 
vintage rather than on the actual quality of the wine in the bottle. Until 
consumers show some measure of resistence to such wines, there is no market 
force pushing the offending wineries to change their pricing policies." 
</P>
<P>
Some consumers are fighting back. In one instance, a case of wine listed above 
was bought by a friend. He tasted it, found the smell of a wet dog and returned 
11 bottles to the winery. "They happily refunded my money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On another occasion, he said, getting credit was a strain. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a shareholder in Chalone and I ordered the 1978 Chalone Shareholder's 
Reserve Chardonnay, which was $300 a case and was available only to 
shareholders," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got the wine, I opened a bottle and I found it seriously flawed in both 
aroma and flavor, and although it was not clearly evident, it tasted and 
smelled as if it had gone through a second fermentation in the bottle," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He confirmed this a month later in a tasting he staged with professional wine 
tasters: a second bottle was just as bad as the first. 
</P>
<P>
After balking, and defending the wine, Chalone finally bought back the 
remaining 10 bottles. 
</P>
<P>
Just the fact that a bottle of wine has a high-falutin' label and a price to 
match is no guarantee that it is great.

WINE NOTES: A LETTER-WRITING GRAPEVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Wine Coalition, a Washington, D.C., lobbying group representing 
wineries and grape growers, has asked about 70 wine and grape growing trade 
associations to urge their members to write Rep. Tom Luken (D-Ohio) opposing 
the Sensible Advertising and Family Education Act of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
John Volpe, executive director of the coalition, said in his letter that the 
bill co-sponsored by Rep. Joseph Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Sen. Albert Gore 
(D-Tenn.) would not address problems associated with alcohol abuse; violates 
First Amendment rights of commercial free speech; and will have a severe 
economic impact on the industries. 
</P>
<P>
The Kennedy-Gore legislation would require five rotating warning labels on all 
alcoholic beverages and also address advertising. Volpe said, however, that 
because there is no federal preemption in the act, some 6,700 state and local 
entities around the country could establish different requirements, costing 
millions to implement. 
</P>
<P>
Federal regulations already mandate a health warning on all packages of 
alcoholic beverages. 
</P>
<P>
Temperature-controlled lockers for wine storage have been opened in West Los 
Angeles at the new Los Angeles Fine Arts and Wine Storage Co. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wine of the Week 
</P>
<P>
1989 Markham Sauvignon Blanc ($7) -- This attractive wine has a melony, almost 
kiwi fruit aroma, and a delicate citrus hint in the finish, with none of the 
grassiness associated with the variety. The lush, soft taste comes from aging 
in French oak and the slightly elevated alcohol (13.3%). Under new owner 
Sanraku of Japan, Markham has recently undergone some major in-house changes 
that are now showing up in improved wines, but prices haven't yet moved up. 
This is excellent value.

PRINCIPAL CAUGHT IN TUG OF WAR OF SCHOOL POLICIES; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: WESTCHESTER HIGH AMONG THE 70 SCHOOLS IN A PILOT PROGRAM TO TEST 
SCHOOL-BASED MANAGEMENT. BUT THE PRINCIPAL MAY BE 'BUMPED' INTO ANOTHER JOB 
BEFORE THE PROGRAM STARTS.

<P>
Westchester High School Principal Eileen Banta is caught between the old way of 
doing things in the Los Angeles Unified School District and what may be the 
wave of the future. 
</P>
<P>
If you find her back at her desk in Westchester next September, it will be mean 
the school board and district is committed to supporting a system of 
self-governance known as school-based-management, said Helen Bernstein, United 
Teachers of Los Angeles president-elect. 
</P>
<P>
If Banta is not, Bernstein said, school-based management is doomed. "It's a 
revolution, and you have to change the rules." 
</P>
<P>
Westchester High is one of 70 schools in a pilot program that will try 
school-based management next year, a daunting task in a district noted for its 
centralized bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
This partnership approach, with the involvement of principals, teachers and 
parents, is expected to sweep through the schools in the next several years. 
</P>
<P>
But this is also the year of budget cuts, and Banta is ensnared in the 
belt-tightening effort in a district where seniority rules. She has been told 
to prepare herself to be "bumped." 
</P>
<P>
That means an administrator whose job was eliminated by the board's efforts to 
trim the bureaucracy is entitled to go back to being a school principal, 
creating a domino effect in the district. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the teamwork approach say it will be disastrous to switch 
principals in mid-stream. Banta's possible replacement, an as-yet-unnamed 
district administrator, may not share her philosophy or priorities, which are 
incorporated into the school's proposal to rule itself. 
</P>
<P>
A principal's role in the development and implementation of school-based 
management is pivotal. "They are the ones who have to set up the team to move 
the issue," said school board member Warren Furutani. "If you don't have a 
team, it's not going to work." 
</P>
<P>
The issue goes beyond Banta to a handful of other principals on the short list 
to be bumped and, Bernstein insists, to the heart of the matter of local school 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
Why, she asks, would any school go through the time-consuming, sometimes 
fractious process of reaching consensus on the direction of the school if the 
principal might not be there to help implement the plan? 
</P>
<P>
According to Bernstein, other urban districts that have adopted school-based 
management have included provisions protecting principals from transfer for a 
specified number of years. If an exception is not made for Banta and others in 
her situation, "there will be no school-based management" in Los Angeles, 
Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Banta's faculty agrees. In a letter to school Supt. Leonard Britton, the union 
representative at Westchester described the faculty as "distraught" at the 
prospect of losing Banta. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the four principals at the school in the last seven years "has been 
totally different in style, goals and strengths," wrote teacher Adrienne 
Zeigler. "There is no generic principal." 
</P>
<P>
The issue is slated for resolution at the school board budget-cutting session 
today. The board could opt to exempt principals at schools in the pilot 
project. Westside board member Mark Slavkin said he will present a way around 
the dilemma by moving to rescind the $500,000 budget cut and keep the 
administrators, so they will not be in a position to bump anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Slavkin said only about six secondary school principals in the district are 
threatened by the cuts. "My goal is to save all the secondary school 
principals," as a way of maintaining continuity at the schools. 
</P>
<P>
This solution solves another dilemma for Slavkin, who is trying to keep the 
Venice High School principal, who is not in the pilot program, from being 
bumped. If an exemption is granted to principals in the pilot program, the 
Venice principal would zoom to the top of the transfer list, which, Slavkin 
said is unfair. 
</P>
<P>
Slavkin agreed that his proposal is really a way around a problem, not a 
long-term solution, which requires careful policy consideration in a less 
pressured atmosphere, he said. 
</P>
<P>
His plan may also be a way around the school administrators' group, the 
Associated Administrators of Los Angeles, who have urged the district to adhere 
to its seniority policy or risk legal action. "Not the least of our concern is 
(UTLA's) involvement in the assignment of principals," said Walker Brown, 
executive director of the association. 
</P>
<P>
Britton has told the board by letter that he is opposed to making an exception 
for those principals at schools on their way to self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you run into waiving rules, you run into the system," said board 
member Furutani. 
</P>
<P>
Banta, meanwhile, is unhappy at the prospect of leaving just as Westchester is 
about to participate in the new program. "You get so into your job at this 
level, you can't imagine anything else," said Banta, who describes 15 hour days 
immersed in her assignment. 
</P>
<P>
She was finishing a successful first year as principal when the ax fell. A 
"we-regret-to-inform-you letter" landed on her desk a week ago, she said. "It 
just took us by shock. . . . 72 hours ago I could barely form words." 
</P>
<P>
The notification that she was in line for transfer next year had nothing to do 
with Banta's job performance, the letter stated. To the contrary, Banta draws 
kudos from her faculty, parents and Slavkin. 
</P>
<P>
The letter to Banta arrived at the time the school was mailing ballots to 
parents, outlining their proposal to partially run their own school next year. 
The faculty had already approved the plan by a wide margin. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals were wrought from a laborious process and represent a meeting of 
the minds between the principal, the faculty and the parents on the goals and 
direction of the school, located on Manchester Boulevard, west of Lincoln 
Boulevard, near the border of Westchester and Playa del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
But Banta, while acknowledging her transfer would be disruptive, is optimistic 
that school-based management will prevail at Westchester. "There is no turning 
back," she said. "If you write a good proposal it will stand on its own merits 
and we wrote a good proposal."

LIFE AT THE BEACH TURNS INTO LIFE WITH THE BOTTLE; 
</P>
<P>
ALCOHOL: THE AVAILABILITY OF LIQUOR NEAR STEPHANIE BARBANELL'S HOME IS TURNING 
HER DREAM LOCATION INTO A NIGHTMARE, SHE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stephanie Barbanell fulfilled a longtime dream of living near the beach when 
she and her husband moved into their modest home on Seaview Terrace in Santa 
Monica more than six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
She and her nearly 3-year-old child take walks to the beach and to the Santa 
Monica Municipal Pier, which is less than a mile north of her home. 
</P>
<P>
But her dream location is becoming a nightmare, she says, because city 
officials have also selected the area around her home and to the north for 
revitalization as an entertainment destination spot with new hotels, 
restaurants and nightclubs -- and with them the sale of alcoholic beverages. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very concerned about the amount of alcohol availability in our 
community," says Barbanell, an elementary teacher currently on leave. "I am not 
a Prohibitionist or teetotaler, but I think I am living amidst quite a few 
alcohol outlets." 
</P>
<P>
According to the state Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, one on-sale 
license (bars and restaurants) is recommended for each 897 people in a census 
tract, and one off-sale license (liquor store) is recommended for each 1,142 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Barbanell's census tract -- which is bordered by Wilshire, Lincoln and Pico 
boulevards and the Pacific Ocean, and includes the pier and the Third Street 
Promenade -- has a population of 2,621, based on the 1980 Census. The ABC told 
Barbanell that her tract should have only three of each license category, yet 
87 on-sale and 15 off-sale licenses exist. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not feel that our neighborhood needs to have 2,800% more alcohol outlets 
than the state guidelines recommend," Barbanell said. "When is enough enough?" 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the high number of liquor licenses in her census tract is that 
the area is zoned primarily for commercial development. Only a few blocks 
bordered by Colorado Boulevard, Ocean Avenue, Pico Boulevard and the ocean are 
zoned for residential use. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Barbanell has gotten little sympathy from the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent City Council hearing at which she appealed Planning Commission 
approval of alcohol being served at a cafe planned for the west end of the 
city-owned pier, Barbanell received support for her appeal from the CLARE 
Foundation, a nonprofit group that provides treatment for alcoholism as well as 
a neighbor who is on the board of the California Council on Alcohol Policy. 
</P>
<P>
The neighbor, Ken Schonlau, asked the council to consider the fact that 
tourists who drink pose a threat to the community when driving out of Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"You're just kidding yourself that this can continue without paying the price," 
Schonlau said. 
</P>
<P>
But the City Council denied the appeal, saying it was not appropriate to 
consider the neighborhood as residential because of the high number of 
commercial uses and the uniqueness of the pier. 
</P>
<P>
"This is indeed, an area of the city that has by proportion few residents and a 
lot of entertainment uses," said Councilman Ken Genser, who joined the near 
unanimous vote in denying Barbanell's appeal. Councilman David Finkel 
abstained. "In fact, that particular area is a visitor-serving zone." 
</P>
<P>
Genser said it would be illogical to determine the number of liquor licenses in 
the area by the number of residents, saying that to do so would mean that 
primarily residential areas such as Wilshire-Montana, Douglas Park or Sunset 
Park would have a greater number of licenses than the commercial area around 
the pier. 
</P>
<P>
"This happens to be a mixed neighborhood," Genser said. "The pier is a regional 
use. The notion that we are over-concentrated based on the ratio to residents 
just doesn't make sense to me in this neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Barbanell has so far been unsuccessful in stopping the issuance of any new 
licenses in her census tract, including at the Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel 
on Ocean Avenue or the Guest Quarters Suite Hotel on 4th Street. 
</P>
<P>
She is currently protesting the issuance of a license to the beachfront Park 
Hyatt Santa Monica Beach Hotel, which is scheduled to open Sept. 30. A hearing 
is scheduled for Monday and Tuesday at the county Hall of Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Barbanell said she is concerned that patrons of the Park Hyatt, which will 
feature two restaurants and an 80-foot-long bar fronting The Promenade, will 
return to the beach intoxicated or become unruly as they leave the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
But Sam Stein, owner of the hotel, said such concerns are unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
"If she is anti-alcohol, that is her right," Stein said. "But this will be a 
world-class hotel. I don't think we are going to have customers throwing beers 
through the window to people on the beach." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Zeltonoga, a supervisor in the beverage control department office in 
Inglewood, said that in the 20 years he has been with the agency, he does not 
recall a hotel ever being denied a liquor license. 
</P>
<P>
The odds are also against Barbanell stopping other new licenses, particularly 
on the pier and the Third Street Promenade -- once aging eyesores that are 
being revitalized with a cornucopia of places to eat and drink and be 
entertained. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the population-to-license guideline, there are enough loopholes in 
state regulations to allow more licenses. 
</P>
<P>
Gilson L. Grey, district administrator of the beverage control agency, outlined 
those provisions in a letter to Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), who 
made an inquiry on behalf of Barbanell. 
</P>
<P>
Grey said that the agency may issue a license if the applicant shows the 
"public convenience or necessity" would be served by the issuance of the 
license. 
</P>
<P>
One rule that Barbanell hoped to use to her advantage that requires denial of 
licenses in areas that have a 20% greater number of reported crimes than the 
average number of reported crimes for all the reporting districts. 
</P>
<P>
However, the agency determined that this rule does not apply in Santa Monica 
because police do not officially report crimes by district, but rather 
citywide. 
</P>
<P>
Barbanell paid the city $329.70 to have the statistics separated by districts. 
She discovered that her district, which has different borders than her census 
tract, and excludes the pier, the south beach area and Main Street, accounted 
for 35% of all alcohol-related arrests citywide between Jan. 1, 1987, and Aug. 
18, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Based on seven reporting districts, Barbanell calculated that her area had 52% 
more crime than average. If special subgroups are included -- such as the pier, 
the Third Street Promenade and Main Street -- her neighborhood would have had 
87% more crime than average, she calculates. 
</P>
<P>
Some opponents of Barbanell have suggested that if she doesn't like living in a 
mixed-use area with so much alcohol available, she should move. But Barbanell 
is quick to respond that she shouldn't have to. 
</P>
<P>
"I have always wanted to live near the beach," she said. "We didn't know what 
the consequences would be to living near a public beach. Still, I feel that we 
should enjoy all the rights and privileges and safety of the police services as 
anyone else in the city. We should not have to be living in the designated 
drinking area or the designated crime area."

HOMELESS POLICY SPARKS PROTESTS IN SANTA MONICA; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: A RALLY DEBATES PROSECUTION OF TRANSIENTS, AND SIGNATURES ARE FILED IN A 
PETITION DRIVE TARGETING THE CITY ATTORNEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Concern about the growing transient problem in Santa Monica focused on City 
Atty. Robert M. Myers this week with a City Hall lawn rally and the filing of 
nearly 11,000 signatures on a petition that would make Myers' job elective 
rather than appointive. 
</P>
<P>
The rally was vocal but controlled Tuesday night, and it featured both 
proponents and opponents of the measure disagreeing on whether Myers was at the 
root of the homeless problem in Santa Monica, as supporters of the measure 
claim. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie Dutton, a spokeswoman for Santa Monicans for the Citizens Protection 
Act, blames growing street crime by transients on Myers' policy of not 
prosecuting most misdemeanor crimes committed by homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
If at least 7,842 of the 10,928 signatures submitted Monday morning to the city 
clerk are verified by the county registrar-recorder, the measure will be placed 
on the November municipal ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to ask the question, 'Why are there so many derelicts in Santa 
Monica?' " Dutton said. "The answer is because of the city's policy not to 
cite, not to arrest, not to prosecute derelicts." 
</P>
<P>
Myers has maintained that prosecuting homeless people for sleeping in parks and 
non-aggressive panhandling only clutters jails and courtrooms and does not 
address the homeless situation. 
</P>
<P>
Before the City Council meeting Tuesday night, a rally organized by a 
homeowners group calling for a tougher city policy on transients was nearly 
upstaged by a counter-rally held by supporters of homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, several people in the group of about 300 shouted at each other 
over who or what is to blame for the growing number of homeless people in Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
After a brief exchange, members of Concerned Homeowners of Santa Monica (CHOSM) 
moved to one side and held their rally, which included speeches by Councilman 
Herb Katz and Councilwoman Christine Reed. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to help the homeless, but we need protection, too," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
Although CHOSM has endorsed the initiative to elect the city attorney, 
organizers were there to propose that the City Council adopt a policy not to 
tolerate aggressive transients and to push for the creation of a Homeless 
Policy Commission to monitor development of such a policy. The group does not 
want any social services providers on the commission. 
</P>
<P>
It also proposes that the city hire a lobbyist -- similar to one recently hired 
to deal with rent control and housing issues -- to press for help from the 
county, state and federal governments. 
</P>
<P>
The group also wants the number of officers on the Police Department's Homeless 
Enforcement Liaison Program (HELP) increased from two officers patrolling eight 
hours a days to four officers who would patrol in two shifts. 
</P>
<P>
The program was implemented last month to warn transients about city laws and 
help identify chronic offenders.

WESTSIDE DIGEST: MARINA DEL REY; 
</P>
<P>
NEW BOAT SLIPS CONSIDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will study the feasibility of building dozens 
of new boat slips along the main channel in Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
The county Board of Supervisors this week approved the $100,000 study to 
determine whether 20 acres of new slips can be built in the small-craft harbor 
without inhibiting boat traffic. 
</P>
<P>
County administrators said that under the proposal, up to 100 new slips would 
be built, but the precise number has not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
The county will also consider combining smaller boat slips in existing 
anchorages to create berths for larger vessels. Ted Reed, director of the 
Department of Beaches and Harbors, said most vacant slips in the harbor now are 
for boats of less than 30 feet, while demand for larger slips is increasing. 
</P>
<P>
The marina's 6,200 boat slips are operated by private anchorages, which pay 25% 
of their gross income to the county as rent for the publicly owned property.

PARK LABREA TOWING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Starting July 1, the management of the Park Labrea apartments will start towing 
away cars on the grounds that do not have a resident parking sticker or guest 
pass on the windshield or dashboard, a spokesman for the residential complex 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The maze-like streets of Park Labrea, the largest apartment complex in Los 
Angeles, were closed to the public when a fencing and gating program went into 
effect earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, patrol officers say about 40 cars without proper registration are 
regularly parked near Park Labrea's high-rise apartment towers, the spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The registration office will be open Saturday to issue windshield stickers. 
Park Labrea's 4,200 apartments are home to an estimated 10,000 people.

<P>
TAX VOTE RECOUNT SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Supporters of a school tax measure in Beverly Hills are requesting a recount 
after final results show that the proposed tax fell five votes short of 
passage. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard Nebenzahl, a leader of the campaign for the parcel tax, said he planned 
to officially ask county election officials today for a recount of the ballots 
cast on the measure in the June 5 election. 
</P>
<P>
Results, certified on Tuesday by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, 
showed that the parcel tax which would have benefited the Beverly Hills Unified 
School District captured 6,817 votes, or 66.61%. Votes against the proposed tax 
numbered 3,416, or 33.38%. 
</P>
<P>
The tax needed two-thirds of the votes, or 6,822, to pass. The assessment on 
each residential and commercial parcel of land in the city would have raised 
$4.5 million a year for the schools. 
</P>
<P>
The recount must start no more than seven days after a request is filed. County 
elections officials declined to say how long a recount would take, but 
Nebenzahl said he hoped it would be completed within two or three days. 
</P>
<P>
"We said we would leave no legal remedy unturned, and we're in step one," 
Nebenzahl said Wednesday. "We're hopeful because of the closeness of the count 
that we'll find the necessary votes to turn it around." 
</P>
<P>
The school board, meanwhile, on Tuesday approved a tentative budget of $28.37 
million for the 1990-91 school year, working on the assumption that the tax 
failed. The budget is smaller than this year's budget of $28.73 million. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very tentative budget -- more tentative than usual" because of the 
recount, said district spokeswoman Hali Wickner. Under state law, school 
districts must approve a tentative budget by July 1 but have until Sept. 15 to 
adopt a final budget.

BOARD OKS RENT INCREASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Monica Rent Control Board voted unanimously to allow landlords to 
raise rents 6% this year and approved on a 3-2 vote a proposal to set $25 as 
the minimum increase. 
</P>
<P>
Board Chairwoman Susan Packer Davis and Commissioner Wayne Bauer voted against 
the $25 minimum, saying that it would hurt low-income tenants. 
</P>
<P>
The $25 minimum increase would apply to apartments with rents of $420 a month 
or less. 
</P>
<P>
In allowing the 6% increase effective Sept. 1, the board ignored a staff 
recommendation to set the annual allowable rent increase at 6.77% with a $35 
minimum. The staff had originally recommended a 7.5% increase, but recalculated 
its formula to come up with the smaller increase. 
</P>
<P>
Although the 6% increase is the largest allowed since rent control was imposed 
in 1979, landlords complained that it was not enough because of rising costs. 
</P>
<P>
Landlords have submitted a petition with more than 11,700 signatures calling 
for a ballot measure in November that would allow landlords to raise rents to 
market levels whenever an apartment is voluntarily vacated. 
</P>
<P>
At least 7,843 signatures must be verified by the county registrar-recorder for 
the measure to be placed on the ballot.

<P>
CITYHOOD APPROVED BY 84% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Official results of the June 5 incorporation election show that Malibu voters 
approved cityhood by just under 84%, Los Angeles County election officials 
announced this week. The vote was 4,682 to 892. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Keller and Larry Wan were the top vote-getters among the 30 candidates for 
Malibu's future City Council. Keller had 3,453 votes and Wan 3,181. The other 
three council members and the votes they received were: Mike Caggiano, 2,616; 
Carolyn Van Horn, 2,287, and Missy Zeitsoff, 1,912. 
</P>
<P>
The official results showed Zeitsoff as the winner by five votes over retired 
Judge John Merrick for the hotly contested fifth council seat. County officials 
last week had indicated that, with all the absentee and write-in ballots 
accounted for, Zeitsoff had won by four votes. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the official vote count showed voters overwhelmingly approving the 
selection of future City Council members at large, rather than by district. The 
vote was 3,669 to 1,437.

COUNCIL STARTS BOND PROCESS FOR PROJECT IN WESTCHESTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council has approved the first step in obtaining $85 
million in tax-exempt bond financing for construction of a 624-unit apartment 
project on the site of the Centinela Drive-In in Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
To obtain the financing, 20% of the apartment units in the complex must be 
reserved for people with very low incomes. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Casden, chairman of the Casden Co., said the Los Angeles development firm 
plans to complete the purchase of the drive-in property from developer George 
Smart &amp; Associates Friday. Casden would not disclose the price for the land 
on Centinela Boulevard, just east of the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
He said in an interview that the council's action last week approving a 
resolution starting the bond-financing process was "very, very preliminary." He 
said the move does not necessarily mean that the property will be developed 
using tax-exempt financing. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no assurance that it will be done that way," he said. "We haven't 
made a decision. We're investigating financing the project." 
</P>
<P>
The bond financing program is intended to provide incentives to encourage 
development of affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
If the lower-cost bond financing is used for the Westchester project, one out 
of every five apartment units in the project must be affordable to people whose 
incomes are less than half of the area's median income. The restriction applies 
for 15 years. After that, the rent would gradually increase, reaching market 
rates after another 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Ruiz, spokesman for Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, said a 
one-bedroom apartment with a market rent of $830 a month would rent for $417 a 
month to a person who qualified as a "very low income" tenant. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in nearby Ladera Heights expressed concern about low-income units 
when the apartment complex was being considered by the Los Angeles Planning 
Commission in October, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
If more expensive conventional financing is used, the project could be built 
without very low income units and only 10% of the units reserved for people 
whose income was defined as moderate.

FORUM SET ON FUTURE OF COASTLINE; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE GEOSURF SYMPOSIUM WILL BRING TOGETHER SURFERS, ECOLOGISTS AND 
DEVELOPERS WITH A VESTED INTEREST IN THE OCEAN AND BEACHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Surfers, environmentalists and others who want to save the waves and beaches 
will meet July 10 at Pepperdine University for the GeoSurf Symposium 1990. 
</P>
<P>
According to organizers Glenn R. Hening and John Van Hamersveld, the conference 
will be the first to bring together all groups that have a vested interest in 
the health of the coastline, from wave riders and makers of wet suits to 
ecologists and developers. 
</P>
<P>
"The symposium is an event where professionals will share and acquire new 
knowledge concerning the issues, the sciences and the magic of waves and 
beaches," the men said. They said the symposium was designed to provide a forum 
"outside the contests and trade shows of the surf industry" to address such 
questions as: What is the current status of the coastline, and what legacy will 
be left for future generations? 
</P>
<P>
Hening, who founded the Surfrider Foundation, a surfer activist organization, 
and Van Hamersveld, a graphic designer whose work includes the classic poster 
for the surfing film "The Endless Summer," said they hoped the symposium would 
function as a leadership seminar for all those concerned about the future of 
waves and beaches. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hening, a major focus of the event will be Malibu Surfrider Beach 
and Lagoon as a microcosm of the issues facing coastlines worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
"Malibu beach is a natural treasure as far as surfers are concerned, like Old 
Faithful," Hening said. 
</P>
<P>
Hening said he and other surfer activists are especially concerned about the 
recent decision of the California Coastal Commission to allow the Tapia 
Reclamation Plant to expand its capacity from 10.1-million gallons a day to 
16.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
GeoSurf and others fear the release of more effluent from the sewage treatment 
plant into Malibu Creek will increase pollution at the beach, Hening said. 
Greater flow could also change the shape of the beach, affecting its 
world-famous waves, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The symposium will include presentations on the Coastal Commission's decision 
and the medical risks linked to marine pollution. 
</P>
<P>
A highlight, Hening said, will be the announcement of the formation of the 
Malibu Sewage Surveillance Project. The project's first order of business, 
Hening said, will be to establish a rapport with Tapia officials and to begin 
regular testing of water quality in Malibu Creek and the Lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
The afternoon program will include a presentation on the birth of surfing, 
featuring a video interview with writer Thor Heyerdahl, who has been studying 
the remains of an ancient coastline culture in Peru. 
</P>
<P>
Hening, who met with Heyerdahl in Peru recently, said Heyerdahl believes 
surfing started at least 2,000 years ago among the Chimu people, who rode the 
waves on reed crafts. Similar surf crafts are still used today, said Hening, 
who noted that Peruvian surfers are faced with serious sewage pollution 
problems, just as their counterparts in Malibu are. 
</P>
<P>
GeoSurf is the name of a company founded last year by Hening and Van Hamersveld 
that disseminates information to surfers and others concerned about the oceans. 
Other organizations participating in the symposium include the Surfrider 
Foundation, American Oceans Campaign, Heal the Bay, the Environmental 
Protection Center in Santa Barbara and the Surf Industry Manufacturers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets are $95 for the general public, $70 for members of participating 
nonprofit organizations and $35 for students. 
</P>
<P>

The Toronado trip to Catalina resulted in a catch of 125 barracuda, 13 bonito 
and 23 bonito.

Five victims assaulted in New York City's Central Park within minutes of the 
gang rape of a woman jogger testified about their terror and outrage during 
attacks by the marauding pack of youths. 
</P>
<P>
"I was terrified. I thought I was going to die," said Robert Garner, 30, of 
London, who was forced off a running path and beaten by about 20 black and 
Latino teen-agers April 19, 1989. Nine victims were attacked in the moonlit 
park. The woman was dragged off another path, beaten, raped and left for dead. 
Three youths are on trial in state court in Manhattan.

The New York City Planning Commission unanimously approved Columbia 
University's controversial plan to build a bio-medical research center at the 
Audubon Ballroom, site of Malcolm X's assassination. 
</P>
<P>
But the commission ruled that the school must preserve about 40% of the 
ballroom in Washington Heights, including the stage where Malcolm X was slain 
as he made a speech in 1965, and the building's original facade. It also set 
limits on the level of hazardous materials at the facility. The plan now goes 
before the Board of Estimate.

The Louisiana House gave final approval to what is considered the toughest 
anti-abortion legislation in the nation and sent it to Gov. Buddy Roemer. 
</P>
<P>
It would allow abortion only to save the life of the mother and decrees prison 
terms of up to 10 years at hard labor for doctors who perform other abortions. 
Roemer has said he will veto the bill because it bans abortion in cases of rape 
or incest. Each side contends it has the votes to prevail in any attempt to 
override a veto.

<P>
A measure designed to prevent the Legislature from interfering with the 
initiative process will appear on the November ballot, Secretary of State March 
Fong Eu said. The initiative would change the state Constitution to require a 
vote of the people on any proposed laws governing the process of putting ballot 
measures before voters. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsors of the measure, the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn., submitted more than 
1 million signatures, nearly twice the 595,485 valid signatures required to 
qualify the initiative for the ballot. Kris Vosburgh, executive director of the 
Jarvis tax group, said an initiative is a so-called people's law, adding: "We 
believe people should have the right to approve any changes that are made to 
their law." The measure would prevent lawmakers from making changes, such as 
increasing the number of voter signatures required to qualify an initiative for 
the ballot, without voter approval.

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: OLD-TIME SANDWICH SHOP IN OCEANSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There aren't many places that would lay claim to serve something called "ugly 
fries," and even fewer that would brag about it. 
</P>
<P>
An eatery that does boast of its hard-to-regard spuds is Renee's Sizzling 
Sandwich Shop in Oceanside, a place that stakes its reputation on the supreme 
edibility of its skin-on, French fried potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
This might seem to be a small potatoes claim to fame, which in fact, it is. The 
restaurant, a tip from a reader who waxed enthusiastic about the "steak combo" 
sandwich, may not rate a special trip, but it is a good, rare example of an 
old-fashioned sandwich shop that prepares foods fresh to order and is worth a 
try if you happen to be both hungry and in the vicinity of Mission Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Renee's style is on the casual side, to say the least, although orders placed 
at the counter will be delivered with an enthusiastic smile, an offer of such 
condiments as jalapeno peppers and no evident expectation of a tip. The place 
occupies a storefront in yet another strip mall, this one graced by the 
presence of batting cages, which may account for some of the wall-mounted 
sports memorabilia, which range from bumper stickers extolling the thrills of 
surfing to a banner decorated with autographed shoe soles from a winning soccer 
team. 
</P>
<P>
To dive right into the cuisine, which one perforce must, since there are no 
preliminary diversions here, pick up one of the hot pink menus at the counter 
and run down the list of sandwich specials. The hottest numbers all revolve 
around the theme of thinly sliced steak grilled Philadelphia style, which can 
be had with onions, mushrooms or bell peppers or with all three of them plus 
mozzarella cheese. 
</P>
<P>
This particular sandwich, served on a choice of a 6-inch or 12-inch roll (the 
latter would have to be for really huge appetites), has most of the virtues of 
a Philadelphia steak-and-cheese and some of its failings: The meat is chewy and 
fairly flavorful, and the onions and peppers add a good, sharp accent. The 
cheese and mushrooms disappear in the general rush, however, and the sandwich 
is greasy -- tradition may call for it to be greasy, but greasy it is, so much 
so that one of those famous, all-American, foil-packaged "moist towelettes" 
would be a welcome supplement to the paper napkins. 
</P>
<P>
Other hot sandwich choices include Polish and Italian sausage subs, a BLT, ham 
and cheese and the dreaded tuna melt; there are also hamburgers in all 
varieties (including one with Ortega chilies) that are good enough to make one 
pine for the days when the corner tavern served the best lunch in town, and the 
golden arches had yet to be erected. 
</P>
<P>
None of these, of course, is quite complete without a plastic basket of ugly 
fries. Skin-on spuds generally lack charm and are notable for their toughness, 
but Renee's takes the trouble to fry these signature spuds to a fine crispness 
and they are, to be brief, quite tasty. They also arrive in quantity and, once 
again, a caveat applies that a large order would appeal only to a truly healthy 
appetite. 
</P>
<P>
As unassuming as it may be, Renee's does mark a return to the old-fashioned 
breakfast and lunch counter by serving what it calls "eye opener" breakfasts 
between 6 a.m. and 11 a.m. None of these were sampled for this column, but the 
list is appealing. It opens with such Mexican specialties as machaca (highly 
seasoned shredded beef), chorizo with eggs and huevos rancheros (all served 
with beans and tortillas) and continues with various egg dishes, French toast 
and buttermilk pancakes.

A FRIENDLY WAVE OR TWO; 
</P>
<P>
SMOOTH SAILING FOR SINGLES SET IN OCEANSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK STENCEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many of skipper Dick Barnier's passengers prefer the disorienting waves and 
bobbing deck of his 27-foot sailboat to the spinning lights and often 
stomach-churning singles scene in North County. 
</P>
<P>
Barnier is one of about 10 boat owners who sail with the Singles Oceanside 
Sailing Club. Every Sunday, up to several dozen of the club's nearly 150 
members meet at Oceanside Harbor to sail and schmooze. 
</P>
<P>
On this particular Sunday, Barnier's crew thankfully includes an acupressure 
therapist, 38-year-old Denise Richards. Richards knew how to help a queasy 
passenger regain his equilibrium -- and hopefully hold down his breakfast -- by 
pressing a particular point on his ear. 
</P>
<P>
An amused Barnier shakes his head over seasickness. "Once you got it, you got 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Richards is one of the club's newest members and this is her second voyage. 
Before her first trip, the 38-year-old Carlsbad woman was so leery of SOSC's 
"singles club" label that she and a friend walked past club members along the 
harbor one Sunday morning to "make sure it was safe" before setting sail. 
</P>
<P>
A few Sundays later, Richards and her friend came back to join the club. "I 
really like the people I've met," she says. "Everybody seems real nice so far. 
. . . It's like a family." 
</P>
<P>
Activity-oriented groups, like SOSC, are less threatening than regular social 
clubs, former SOSC commodore Ilena Bond says. 
</P>
<P>
"The primary purpose of the club is sailing," vice commodore for sailing Don 
Drews says. "It's not a meat market type of thing." 
</P>
<P>
SOSC members like to think of themselves as a "training club," Drews said. The 
club offers a four-week, 16-hour sailing course for $30, and members are 
encouraged to take the free sailing lessons offered by the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the club is not exactly anti-social. 
</P>
<P>
Drews met Dorris, his wife of less than two months, through SOSC. Four or five 
other "alumni" couples remain active in the club, according to current 
commodore Dee McCauley. And some members are dating, like Barnier and Bond. 
</P>
<P>
During summer, members meet behind Oceanside Yacht Club for a potluck barbecue 
after sailing. In winter, they gather for drinks at a nearby restaurant bar. 
The club also sponsors parties, cookouts and other social events during the 
year, McCauley said. 
</P>
<P>
The club also holds occasional races, Thursday night "twilight sails" and 
overnight trips to Dana Point, Catalina and other locations. 
</P>
<P>
Freeway travelers might find it hard to get excited about a six-hour sailing 
trip to a location that is less than a half-hour away by car. But, says 
McCauley, "You learn to kick-back a lot. It's one of the delights of 
(sailing)." 
</P>
<P>
SOSC is a diverse group with members representing a variety of backgrounds, 
incomes and ages. 
</P>
<P>
Members range in age from late 20s to early 70s, membership chairman Jean 
Slaughter said. "Most people are in their 40s or 50s," she added. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't seem to faze 25-year-old Jonathan Tucker of Vista, who joined 
the club with several friends less than two weeks ago. "Age never bothered me a 
bit," he said.

ODDITIES ARE FAIR GAME IN DEL MAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS K. ARNOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the Del Mar Fair ending its 20-day run soon -- it closes Wednesday -- 
let's take one last tour of the fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
This time, though, we'll avoid the mainstream attractions and instead follow 
the undercurrent that originates from the unusual talents and hobbies of North 
County residents. 
</P>
<P>
The first two stops are in the Hobby Show tent. 
</P>
<P>
Just off the center aisle is a collection of avocado pits, carved and painted 
as miniature busts of familiar historical, show-business and cartoon 
personalities. Among them: Abraham Lincoln and Adolf Hitler, Charlie Chaplin 
and Carmen Miranda, Betty Boop and the California Raisins. 
</P>
<P>
The artist is 64-year-old Robert Santiago of San Marcos, who said he began his 
hobby more than a decade ago, when he was living in New York and supervising 
F-14 Navy fighter-jet production for Grumman Aerospace. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always eaten avocados -- my wife makes all sorts of salads -- and one 
day I just looked at the pits and thought I could do something with them, since 
I've always been artistic," Santiago recalled. "I carved one or two, and they 
didn't come out all right, but I kept at it. 
</P>
<P>
"And, when I retired in 1982 and moved out here, to the land of avocados, I 
began carving more and more -- my friends kept supplying me with pits -- and 
then I started painting them up." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Santiago has more than 200 busts in his collection -- with more to come, 
he promises. 
</P>
<P>
One aisle down are two balls created from scraps of string. The string, used to 
hold bundles of linen at the San Luis Rey Psychiatric Hospital in Encinitas, 
was salvaged over the past six years by longtime housekeeper Lupe Ferguson, 63, 
of Leucadia. 
</P>
<P>
One ball weighs 18 pounds and took five years to make; the other weighs 2 1/2 
pounds and is less than a year old. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day I would unwrap a bundle of linen for the adult unit, and I hated to 
see the string go to waste," said Ferguson, who won the fair's Most Unusual 
Adult Hobby Award. "So one day I took a matchbook cover from Thrifty's and 
started saving the string scraps, which are each about 40 inches long. 
</P>
<P>
"Five years later, by the time the hospital moved to its present location, I 
had this huge ball weighing 18 pounds and measuring 45 inches around the 
middle. After we moved, I started another ball, and already I've got more than 
2 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"If you figure a 3-ounce package of string sells for just under $2 in the 
stores, that's a total of more than $200 worth of string I've managed to save. 
And I'm still collecting it. Each day I unwrap the linen, my ball gets bigger." 
</P>
<P>
Next stop on the tour: the Community Stage, where Friday night, from 6 to 8, 
the Belair Boys will perform rock 'n' roll oldies from the 1950s and early 
'60s. 
</P>
<P>
Now, there are plenty of oldies bands in the county, but none quite like the 
Belair Boys. 
</P>
<P>
The group is fronted by a pint- size Elvis Presley impersonator, 37-year-old 
Kanickie Ferritto of Oceanside, who abruptly launches into his routine -- a 
12-song tribute -- midway through the group's set. 
</P>
<P>
Ferritto doesn't really look the part (he's not much over 5 feet) but he sure 
does sound like The King: He's got the voice and the range, and he's mastered 
the phrasings and intonations. The origins of his clone act date to 1969, when 
he did an impromptu performance of Presley's "Spring Fever" (from the movie 
"Girl Happy") at his high school graduation ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Ferritto has been singing with the Belair Boys since the mid-1970s. They've 
been regulars at the Del Mar Fair since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
The final stop on our tour: the Flower and Garden Show tent. 
</P>
<P>
This stop is designed to soothe the spirit rather than bedevil it. A scene from 
Alice in Wonderland has been erected by Evergreen Nurseries of Del Mar. The 
exhibit is called "Paint the Roses Red," and that's precisely what a trio of 
playing card "guards" appear to be doing. The roses closest to them are red; 
those farther are white. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit also includes a life-size Alice (fashioned from a department store 
mannequin) and a papier-mache Queen of Hearts and White Rabbit. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea came from the part in the book where the Queen of Hearts comes out 
and is all upset that the roses are white, and so she has her card soldiers 
paint them red," said Roland Martinez, Evergreen's general operations manager. 
"The display probably has 500 rose bushes in various colors, and, say, 5,000 
assorted other flowers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the kind of unique thing people are used to seeing from us. Every year at 
the fair, we try to do something different." 
</P>

EDELMAN PUT IN LATINO DISTRICT BY BOARD PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A sharply divided Board of Supervisors on Wednesday submitted to a federal 
judge a redistricting plan that would change the political representation for 
many of Los Angeles County's 8 1/2 million residents and force Supervisor Ed 
Edelman to run in a new, heavily Latino district. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting behind closed doors, the supervisors adopted the plan hours before a 
deadline imposed by a federal judge who ruled that the existing supervisorial 
district boundaries discriminate against Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
The map was rushed by a law clerk to the U.S. Courthouse and delivered to the 
judge only 25 minutes before the court's 5 p.m. closing time. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by the judge, the plan would expose Edelman, a 16-year board 
veteran, to a strong challenge from a Latino. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon has scheduled a July 5 hearing to decide 
whether to accept the plan. He has said if the plan fails to correct violations 
of the federal Voting Rights Act, he will redraw district lines himself after 
consulting with the plaintiffs in the case. 
</P>
<P>
After the 3-2 vote, Edelman angrily denounced the plan as a partisan ploy by 
conservative supervisors to maintain their control of the board. He predicted 
that the plan will be rejected by the judge and the plaintiffs in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the plaintiffs -- the U.S. Justice Department, the American Civil 
Liberties Union and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund -- 
said they would have no comment until they review the map. 
</P>
<P>
MALDEF plans to submit its own map to the judge by the July 5 hearing, but 
officials declined to reveal details. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Deane Dana, who crafted the board's redistricting plan, admitted 
that his goal was to maintain conservative control of the board. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the name of the game -- politics," Dana said. The vote was strictly 
along ideological lines with Dana and fellow conservatives Mike Antonovich and 
Pete Schabarum outvoting liberals Kenneth Hahn and Edelman. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon earlier this month ruled that the five Anglo supervisors intentionally 
discriminated against the county's 3 million Latinos by drawing district 
boundaries in 1981 in a way that diluted their voting strength. The 
supervisors, who have spent $4 million fighting the 1988 lawsuit, are appealing 
the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's secret session, the supervisors also voted 3 to 2 to spend 
another $500,000 to hire a private law firm to separately pursue an appeal to 
the U.S. Supreme Court, if necessary. The action authorizes Schabarum, though 
he is retiring, to personally carry on an appeal, even if his successor or any 
other new supervisor votes to drop the county's appeal, said county attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a way to guarantee that no matter what happens on the board there would 
be an appeal," said Edelman, who voted against the expenditure. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan adopted Wednesday, a new 74% Latino district, bearing the 
designation of Edelman's 3rd District, would stretch from downtown Los Angeles 
east to El Monte and Rosemead and southeast to Montebello and Pico Rivera. It 
would contain two thin fingers, one extending to Edelman's home on the Westside 
and another running out to the heavily Latino city of San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos account for 45.5% of the registered voters of the new 3rd District, 
according to county figures. Democrats outnumber Republicans 68% to 22%. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman would lose a large part of the Westside that has formed his political 
base. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn's low-income South-Central Los Angeles district would pick up affluent 
Beverly Hills and Hollywood from Edelman. Antonovich, who now represents much 
of the San Fernando Valley, would pick up more from Edelman. 
</P>
<P>
Dana said his coastal district would stretch into the San Fernando Valley for 
the first time, picking up Agoura Hills and Westlake Village from Antonovich. 
Schabarum's 1st District also would take in portions of the Antelope and Santa 
Clarita valleys for the first time, according to Dana's office. 
</P>
<P>
At a packed news conference in his Hall of Administration office, Edelman, 
whose existing district is 47% Latino, said he believes he could win reelection 
in the new Latino district. Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre and 
Gloria Molina and Rep. Esteban Torres (D-La Puente) have expressed interest in 
running for supervisor in a new Latino district. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman has hired his own redistricting attorney but would not say whether he 
plans legal action. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the time for political gerrymandering," Edelman said with Hahn at 
his side. "It's patently unfair. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure the NAACP is going to look kindly at this because black voting 
rights would be diluted," Edelman said. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn, however, said he was assured by county lawyers that the plan does not 
violate the voting rights of black voters in his South-Central Los Angeles 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Theodore M. Shaw, attorney for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, an intervenor in 
the voting rights lawsuit, said he had not seen the map and could not comment. 
</P>
<P>
Placing a Latino majority in a district with an incumbent makes it more 
difficult for the first Latino to win a seat on the board, Edelman said. He 
said the Latino majority should have been placed in the 1st District, where 
Schabarum's seat is being vacated. 
</P>
<P>
Though the plaintiffs offered no comment, Alan Clayton, civil rights 
representative for the League of United Latin American Citizens, said, "They're 
making it tough for a Hispanic to win by having an incumbent who is extremely 
well financed." 
</P>
<P>
Dana contended that the plan could lead to the election of two Latinos to the 
five-member board, one from Edelman's district and the other from Schabarum's 
district, where Sarah Flores, a Latino, is a leading candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman, who first saw the plan Tuesday morning, met privately with Schabarum 
late Tuesday night in an unsuccessful try to persuade him to support expansion 
of the board as an alternative. Edelman in the closed-door meeting Wednesday 
proposed expansion -- an idea favored by the judge, the ACLU and MALDEF -- but 
his motion was defeated by the conservative majority. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum was unavailable, but his office issued a statement decrying the 
redistricting as "very unsatisfactory, done only in response to an 
extraordinarily biased and arbitrary request of the court. 
</P>
<P>
"I find the lines of the district disgraceful, but what do you do, given the 
requirement of the judge to come up with a district with equal population that 
has a majority of voting-age Hispanic citizens," Schabarum said. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon may decide at the July 5 hearing whether to grant the plaintiffs' 
request to cancel a November runoff between Flores and Greg O'Brien in the 1st 
District and call a November election in the new districts. 
</P>
<P>
Flores had not seen the map by late Wednesday but said, "Whatever it is, I'm 
still going to run, and I know I'm still going to win. . . . I'm glad that most 
of the San Gabriel Valley was kept in place." 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien, who traveled from his Glendora home to Schabarum's office to look at 
the map, said, "I was prepared for something of less than artistic merit, but 
this beats all. This is the wildest looking district that I have ever seen. I 
think it's an embarrassment to democracy." 
</P>
<P>
As Edelman's press conference drew to a close, Hahn, who picked up Beverly 
Hills in the remapping, turned to his liberal friend and said, "Ed, would you 
tell your folks in Beverly Hills I'm a good guy?" 
</P>
<P>

COURT OKS AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AT FEDERAL LEVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court, in a surprising finale to its 1989-90 term, ruled Wednesday 
that Congress may order the use of affirmative action in awarding federal 
contracts, including radio and television licenses. 
</P>
<P>
On a 5-4 vote, the court said that the federal government may use a "benign 
racial classification" system to give preference to blacks over whites. Such a 
federal policy need not remedy past discrimination but rather may seek simply 
to give blacks and other minorities a greater share of federal benefits, the 
court said. 
</P>
<P>
This open-ended endorsement of minority preference policies by the federal 
government comes just a year after an increasingly conservative Supreme Court 
appeared ready to ban government affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, in the case of Croson vs. Richmond, the high court said that states 
and local governments may not give preferences to minorities except in the rare 
instances in which they are making up for a history of blatant exclusion. 
</P>
<P>
But, on Wednesday, a different court lineup announced that Congress may do what 
the states may not. 
</P>
<P>
It is "within the power of Congress" to undertake "benign race-conscious 
measures" so as to "serve important government objectives," Justice William J. 
Brennan Jr. said for the court. Brennan was joined by his three fellow liberals 
on civil rights issues -- Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul 
Stevens -- and Byron R. White, who usually votes with the conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
However, White is known for regularly voting to uphold acts of Congress without 
regard to ideology. "He is a strong nationalist who defers to congressional 
power," said Harvard law professor Laurence H. Tribe. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling was based on the post-Civil War amendment to the Constitution that 
gave Congress the power to remedy discrimination in the South against the newly 
freed slaves. 
</P>
<P>
The decision gave congressional Democrats and civil rights activists a major 
victory. For the Bush Administration, it was a surprising defeat. The decision 
gave a boost to Democrats who are pressing legislation to overturn a series of 
Supreme Court rulings last year that limited the reach of federal civil rights 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
Legal experts said they were stunned. 
</P>
<P>
"This is genuine landmark opinion that comes at exactly the right time in 
American history," Tribe said. "It is crucial that Congress have the elbow room 
to deal with this nation's racial problems at a time when the court has seemed 
no longer interested." 
</P>
<P>
The four conservative dissenters said that the talk of "racial classification" 
smacked of Nazi and South African discrimination. "I regret that, after a 
century of judicial opinions, we interpret the Constitution to do no more than 
move us from 'separate but equal' to 'unequal but benign,' " Justice Anthony M. 
Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
The case before the court focused on a policy used by the Federal 
Communications Commission to award radio and television broadcast licenses. 
Because less than 1% of the nation's radio and television stations were 
minority-owned in 1978, the FCC said that it would consider it a "plus factor" 
if future license applicants were minority members. 
</P>
<P>
The Ronald Reagan Administration tried to reverse this FCC policy in the early 
1980s, but Congress enacted a bill freezing it in place. 
</P>
<P>
With the "plus factor" in effect, Metro Broadcasting, a predominantly white 
Florida firm, lost a bid for a new television station in Orlando to a company 
owned by Latinos. Metro filed suit, challenging the FCC policy as 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
The federal appeals court in Washington upheld this FCC policy. 
</P>
<P>
When the case (Metro Broadcasting vs. FCC, 89-453) reached the Supreme Court, 
it appeared to give the court's conservative majority a chance to wipe out 
minority preference policies throughout the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, thanks to White's vote, Brennan and his allies on the court revived a 
long-forgotten liberal view of the 14th Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
In 1868, three years after the Civil War ended, the Reconstruction Congress 
approved the 14th Amendment to give itself the power to protect blacks in the 
Southern states. It said that no state "may deny to any person . . . the equal 
protection of the laws." Its final passage said: "The Congress shall have power 
to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article." 
</P>
<P>
In recent decades, the amendment has been understood to require that all 
Americans have a right to equal treatment by government at all levels: local, 
state and federal. Bush Administration lawyers said that the 14th Amendment 
required the federal government, as well as the states, to adopt colorblind 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
But liberal lawyers replied that the amendment allows Congress to enact 
preferences for blacks, even if the states may not. 
</P>
<P>
"The central purpose of the 14th Amendment was to give Congress the power to 
improve the status of blacks. That's just what Congress was doing here," said 
Georgetown law professor Louis M. Seidman, who filed a friend-of-the court 
brief in support of the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
Equally important, according to some lawyers, the court said that a minority 
preference program need not be a remedy for past discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"This means you don't have to dredge up what happened in the past, but rather 
say this would make things better in the future," said New York University law 
professor Burt Neuborne. Based on this rationale, Congress could mandate 
affirmative action in a variety of areas. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see that they have set any limit," Charles Cooper, a Reagan 
Administration lawyer, said ruefully. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Stevens may have set one limit. Although he joined the five-member 
majority, he said in a concurring statement that minority preference programs 
should be reserved for "extremely rare situations." 
</P>
<P>
In a 30-page dissent, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said the Constitution demands 
that all persons be treated "as individuals" and that "racial classifications" 
are repugnant. She was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and 
Justices Kennedy and Antonin Scalia. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, in a separate dissent joined by Scalia that went even further, 
lambasted the court for upholding legal racial classifications. He cited both 
Nazi measures and South Africa's apartheid policies and compared the ruling to 
the infamous Plessy vs. Ferguson case of 1896, in which the court endorsed the 
"separate but equal" doctrine.

BLISTERING HEAT SHATTERS RECORDS 2ND STRAIGHT DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC and PENELOPE McMILLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Searing heat broke longstanding records across Southern California and the rest 
of the Southwest for the second straight day Wednesday and forecasters said 
little relief is expected before next week. 
</P>
<P>
The thermometer reached 109 degrees at the Los Angeles Civic Center on 
Wednesday afternoon, breaking a 14-year-old record for the date by 7 degrees 
and falling just 3 degrees short of the all-time record for any date, set 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The parching heat and gusting winds generated by a massive inland high-pressure 
system fanned brush fires that destroyed more than 100 homes from Santa Barbara 
to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 passengers were bumped from their flights at Burbank Airport when the 
heat -- which approached 110 degrees on the runways -- forced airlines to 
lighten the loads on their planes. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Aviation Administration officials explained that in very hot weather, 
air thins and the lifting capacity of airliners' wings is reduced. The same 
problem occurred Tuesday in Phoenix, when the temperature there reached a 
record 122. 
</P>
<P>
Power consumption, pushed to record levels on Tuesday, broke those marks again 
on Wednesday as millions of Southland residents tried to beat the heat by 
cranking up their air conditioners. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands more fled to the beaches, where temperatures were as much 
as 35 degrees cooler than inland. 
</P>
<P>
For many, there was no escape. 
</P>
<P>
"It's terrible!" said auto mechanic Elmo Stewart, 47, as he sweltered under the 
hood of a car at a small, non-air-conditioned repair shop in Canoga Park. The 
temperature inside the garage had topped 102 by mid-morning. "It got bad pretty 
fast, today," he said. "By 9:30 a.m., I was pretty well drained. I picked the 
wrong kind of job. Let me tell you!" 
</P>
<P>
Six year-round schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District lack full air 
conditioning, and four of them closed early Wednesday because of the heat. The 
other two plan to close early today. 
</P>
<P>
"They're so hot, poor things," Carol Marderosian, a fourth-grade teacher at 
Reseda Elementary School, said of her pupils. "There's lots of nosebleeds, 
their stomachs hurt, their faces are red." 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics reported an unusually busy day Wednesday as they attended to scores 
of people, mostly elderly, complaining of dizziness and debilitation due to the 
heat. 
</P>
<P>
"Our guys have been out almost all day," said Los Angeles County Fire Capt. 
Rosco Doke, whose station is in Huntington Park. "We've probably received two, 
three times more calls than usual." 
</P>
<P>
According to meteorologists, the far-reaching heat wave is the product of a 
massive, high-pressure dome stationed over the Southwest like a lid on a vast 
Dutch oven, baking the entire landscape beneath it. The lid presses down in a 
process called "subsidence," compressing and heating the air beneath it. 
</P>
<P>
The crippling heat wave has been blamed for at least one death here -- that of 
a 4-year-old boy who succumbed to heat exhaustion Tuesday after being 
accidentally locked in a parked car in Pacoima. Three others apparently died 
from the heat in Phoenix on Tuesday. On Wednesday, a 57-year-old man who had 
been working outdoors at his Phoenix area home died after his body temperature 
reached 108 degrees, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's downtown Los Angeles high -- 112 -- shattered a 107-year-old record 
for the date by 14 degrees and was the hottest temperature recorded here since 
the National Weather Service started keeping records 113 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The thermometer hovered for most of the night at a sweltering 92 before finally 
dipping to 84 at about 7 a.m. -- an all-time record for the warmest minimum 
reading at the Civic Center. And it didn't take long for things to start 
heating up again Wednesday morning. By 8 a.m. it was 94; by 9 a.m. -- the peak 
of morning rush hour -- it was 100. 
</P>
<P>
As they had the evening before, cars started overheating and pulling to the 
shoulder of the area's freeways during the morning commute. The problems 
increased in the afternoon as commuters battled even higher temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
Overheated cars proved a boon to the auto rental business. 
</P>
<P>
"Cars die in heat, so people rent cars," said Iris Fox, manager of an 
Enterprise Rent-A-Car office in Torrance. "Many people are renting the cars 
because of the air conditioning -- either because they don't have it or because 
theirs doesn't work that well." 
</P>
<P>
In one of their cruelest advisories ever, the California Highway Patrol 
suggested that motorists turn off their air conditioners, and even turn on 
their heaters, if their engines begin to overheat. Mechanics explained that air 
conditioners tend to make engines run extra hot, and that turning on the heater 
draws heat from the engine. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Rapid Transit District reported a surge in bus 
breakdowns Wednesday. Overheated coaches were coasting to a halt throughout Los 
Angeles County, causing sweaty delays. 
</P>
<P>
"Passengers are going to have to take it in stride," said RTD spokesman Rick 
Jager. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures topped 100 across a broad swath of the Southland on Wednesday as 
humidity stayed low, ranging between 11% and 26% at the Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
The highest thermometer readings were in the desert -- 119 at Palm Springs, 118 
at Blythe, 117 at Thermal and 116 at Needles. 
</P>
<P>
But it didn't make that much difference where you were -- it was hot 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Readings included 112 at Ontario, 110 in Pasadena and Monrovia, 109 in San 
Gabriel, Santa Barbara and Woodland Hills, 108 in Northridge and Riverside, 107 
in Burbank and San Bernardino, 106 in Long Beach, 104 in Anaheim, Montebello 
and San Juan Capistrano, 103 at El Toro and Van Nuys and 101 at Avalon, on 
Santa Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
It only reached 91 Wednesday at San Diego's Lindbergh Field, but that was 
enough to break the previous record high for the date of 90, set in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Edison Co. said its 4 million customers in the Los 
Angeles area had used 17,647 megawatts of power by 3 p.m. Wednesday, topping 
Tuesday's all-time mark by almost 700 megawatts. 
</P>
<P>
"On a normal June day, we'd probably be in the 12,000 range," SCE spokesman 
Paul Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power's 1.3 million customers set a new 
record Wednesday by using 5,312 megawatts of power, according to spokeswoman 
Mindy Berman. That topped the previous day's all-time record demand of 5,137 
megawatts. 
</P>
<P>
Both utilities reported scattered power outages during the day. SCE said about 
80,000 customers lost power for varying amounts of time, but by 2 p.m., all but 
400 customers had their service restored. Service to about 2,500 DWP customers 
was interrupted briefly in Palms, Northridge and North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Utility officials urged customers to leave thermostats on air conditioners in 
the 80-degree range and to curtail using other appliances unless absolutely 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
When it came to describing the heat wave, the NWS, with unaccustomed fervor, 
may have summarized it best in one of dozens of bulletins it issued on 
Wednesday: 
</P>
<P>
"Very strong high pressure over the Southwestern United States will dominate 
the weather through the weekend, with unbelievable heat in the Southwest and in 
Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
According to Bill Hibbert, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which 
provides forecasts for The Times, there will be more of the same today, with 
highs near 105 degrees in downtown Los Angeles, dropping to about 100 on 
Friday.

They fought as best they could amid the heat and flames -- with garden hoses, 
buckets of water, shovels of dirt. In the end, many were forced to surrender 
the effort, and they watched helplessly as their homes were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
The scene was repeated over and over again Thursday through a long, hot 
afternoon and into the night. In ravines above Santa Barbara. The steep canyons 
of the Chino Hills. Through a rolling residential neighborhood in east 
Glendale, where flames hopped capriciously along Solway Street, Lorinda Drive, 
Foxkirk Road, Ridge Drive and dozens of others -- pleasant streets of a kind 
that could be found almost anywhere in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
If there was a message in the fiery outbursts of Thursday, it was the same 
brutal but almost banal message seemingly delivered every summer: This could 
happen to you. 
</P>
<P>
At 3:30 p.m. the flames were converging from three directions on Solway Street. 
Neighbors evacuated with their belongings and rallied to each other's aid. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Dery, 32, rushed to help neighbors with the ensuing fight. They watched 
over their shoulders for helicopters with water and fire-retardant chemicals, 
for firefighters, for help. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we held the line somewhat until the copters made their drop," Dery 
said. "The fire was that far away, he said, holding his hands about two feet 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
At 716 Solway St., Todd Schulze, 26, was napping when a friend woke him with a 
warning that fire was coming over the ridge. The young man climbed on top of 
the garage with a garden hose and wet down the roof and trees. He would recall 
how the fire popped and cracked like gunshots and firecrackers, how the downed 
power lines arced. 
</P>
<P>
"Power lines were jumping all over the road," Schulze said. 
</P>
<P>
Schulze's father, Wayne, arrived and joined the fight, but it was too late: The 
house seemingly exploded in flames. It was a time for taking stock. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the guy I'm glad to see," Wayne Schulze said, putting his arm around 
his son's shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
There were victories. Tony Anobile stuck it out on Solway and fought the fire 
for hours with a single garden hose. Once he looked down and saw his sandals 
were afire. He directed the water stream on them and kept fighting. He saved 
his house. 
</P>
<P>
Up the incline looking north, the silhouettes of chimneys of burned houses on 
Ridge Drive could be seen clearly from Solway. 
</P>
<P>
"See that smoke?" said Avo Soulahian, 54, who lived on Ridge Drive with his 
brother, Raffy, and his family. "That's our house. We escaped the war in 
Lebanon, and we came here. Nothing bad happened to us in Lebanon." 
</P>
<P>
The family had lived in the home for about a year. 
</P>
<P>
The fight was over by the time Dr. Andre Henry reached the neighborhood, 
attempting to save his home at 695 Ridge Drive. Police had erected barricades 
and wouldn't let him pass. Henry's cousin, Luc Alexander, told Henry that he 
had been at home and had done what he could as a home next door caught fire and 
spilled burning embers. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the water hose and was trying to do my best when the police came and 
said, 'You have to leave now.' And, I did." 
</P>
<P>
After hours of uncertainty, Henry would learn that his home had been spared. 
Fire had jumped his house, he said, and destroyed the homes of three neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Theodor Bauer, who had lived on Ridge Drive for 21 years, covered his shingle 
roof with a new fireproof steel roof two years ago, but when the flames came 
Thursday the shingles caught fire anyway and the house burned. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have saved it," Bauer said. "But four policemen dragged me away. 
Everything's gone." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors helping neighbors was a common theme in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
The fire made it to Barbara Fogarish's block on Lorinda Drive shortly before 5 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The first houses to burn on the cul-de-sac were those with shake roofs. But 
composition roofs caught fire, too, and flames leaped from roof to roof. 
</P>
<P>
A force of volunteer firefighters -- neighbors and total strangers alike -- 
joined in the battle, dipping buckets into swimming pools, shoveling dirt, and 
linking garden hoses to reach the advancing fire. 
</P>
<P>
"They just came out of nowhere," Fogarish said. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Andrew, sprayed water from the roof of the garage. When a Pasadena 
Fire Department truck showed up the fire was mostly under control. 
</P>
<P>
One of the volunteers was an 18-year-old named Steve Skendzic. He said he had 
seen the towering smoke column from where he lives in Atwater. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to live in Glendale, and I didn't want to see my 'hood burning up," he 
said. "I hate this stuff. This is awful." Ron Cimino, 26, a computer operator 
for Glendale Federal Bank, was watching television newscasts at home in La 
Crescenta when he realized that his parents' home on Foxkirk Road was in 
danger. His parents were on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
When he arrived, the flames were perilously close to the house. He grabbed a 
garden hose to attempt to push back the fire creeping through brush. It had 
little effect. 
</P>
<P>
Cimino, who suffered minor burns on his arms and back, held a T-shirt over his 
mouth as he fought the fire. 
</P>
<P>
"The flames were creeping up the hill," Cimino said. "There was a wind gust, 
and I was in the middle. I jumped in the pool, and that helped." 
</P>
<P>
At 4:30 p.m., Cimino said, police forced him to evacuate, and when he returned 
an hour later, the house had burned to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no fire department there when we got kicked out," he complained. 
"They were other places, but not there. I don't think it's fair that they make 
you leave when there's no firemen. We were at least doing better than nothing." 
</P>
<P>
He had not yet told his parents that their house was gone.

It covers one-fifth of the nation's land area, but the 10-state region known as 
the Great Plains has a population less than that of Georgia or Indiana. The 
Plains have the worst hail storms and blizzards, the fiercest droughts, the 
hottest summers and coldest winters and, because of all this, the nation's 
shortest growing season. 
</P>
<P>
It is a land so desolate, so inhospitable to human life, that without 
government intervention much of the region would suffer near-total desertion 
within a generation, says Frank J. Popper, a Rutgers University urban studies 
professor. And that, according to Popper, is exactly what should happen. 
</P>
<P>
PLAN CREATES STIR: Popper and his wife, Deborah Epstein Popper, have created a 
stir from Montana to Texas with their advocacy of a plan to allow the Great 
Plains to revert to their natural "pre-white" condition. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . Tear down the fences, replant the shortgrass, and restock the animals, 
including the buffalo," the Poppers urged in a 1987 article in Planning 
magazine. Since then, they've made frequent trips to the Plains states to speak 
before groups often hostile to the idea of turning the region back over to the 
buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope they enjoy it back home in toxic Jersey," newspaper editor Lauren 
Donovan said at a forum last November in Bismark, N.D., where she appeared with 
the Poppers. "Foolishness and Popperscock like this could only have come from a 
place like that." 
</P>
<P>
NO FIGHTING CHANCE: Others argue, more rationally, that the Poppers' approach 
essentially amounts to writing off a major portion of the country without 
giving it a fighting chance to survive. 
</P>
<P>
But Frank Popper said he thinks history will prove him right. Some areas of the 
Great Plains reached their population peak a century ago and have been in 
decline ever since, he said. It is not uncommon for people in the Plains states 
to drive 40 miles to a school or movie, a hundred miles to a clothing store or 
dentist, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Population on the Plains received a big boost from the 1862 Homestead Act, 
which gave 160 acres to anyone who would settle for five years, and was 
nurtured by federal agriculture supports and public works projects. Now the 
expense of intensive farming on the arid land, and the loss of many family 
farms, is reversing the trend, the Poppers contend. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that over the next generation the Plains will, as a result of the 
largest, longest-running agricultural and environmental miscalculation in 
American history, become almost totally depopulated," the Poppers write. The 
cities that remain may actually increase their population, they argue, but they 
will be urban islands in an ocean of grass. 
</P>
<P>
"Ours is not a strong government intervention approach," Frank Popper said. 
"Our approach is simply let natural and economic forces run their course." 
</P>
<P>
As the Poppers define the Great Plains, the region's eastern border is the 98th 
meridian. San Antonio and Denver are on the Plains' eastern and western edges, 
respectively. But the largest city actually within the Plains is Lubbock, Tex. 
(pop., 179,000), the Poppers say. 
</P>
<P>
The Poppers argue that as the depopulation of the Great Plains continues, the 
U.S. government should step in and buy the land. The government also should 
help the region's economic refugees resettle elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
ULTIMATE NATIONAL PARK: And gradually, they contend, the Great Plains should be 
turned into a sprawling Buffalo Commons -- "the world's largest historic 
preservation project, the ultimate national park. Most of the Great Plains will 
become what all of the United States once was -- a vast land mass, largely 
empty and unexploited." 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a good 20 years before the rest of the country and the Plains 
states wake up to what's happening," Frank Popper said. "We think a lot of the 
people in the Plains states already know what is happening but either can't or 
won't admit it." He thinks that is the reason for the emotional response.

SOVIET PARTY PLANS TO HOLD CONGRESS ON SCHEDULE; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: A SHOWDOWN BETWEEN REFORMERS AND CONSERVATIVES IS EXPECTED AT A 
CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEETING FRIDAY.

Despite a conservative surge that could undermine President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's hopes of accelerating his reform program, the leadership of the 
Soviet Communist Party intends to proceed with its congress next week as 
scheduled, a ranking member of the party's Politburo said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Vadim A. Medvedev, the party secretary for ideology, said that a final decision 
on whether to hold the congress in spite of calls for its postponement will be 
made at a meeting of the policy-making Central Committee that opens Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In what is likely to be a major showdown between the party's reformists and its 
strong conservative wing, the 249-member committee will also debate the report 
to the congress that Gorbachev will deliver as the party's general secretary. 
</P>
<P>
And it will review a rewritten party platform and a plan for the reorganization 
of party bodies, the two key documents that will be put before the 4,700 
delegates to the congress as "blueprints for perestroika," as a Soviet 
commentator described them. 
</P>
<P>
Medvedev said the platform, which was published Wednesday, had been reworked 
extensively to take account of criticism from both radical reformers and 
conservatives as well as to create a more philosophical, strategic document, 
which would lay the basis for broadening and speeding perestroika, as 
Gorbachev's reforms are known. 
</P>
<P>
Although there had been intense speculation that Gorbachev was seeking to delay 
the congress so that he could regroup his forces and ensure endorsement of his 
reforms, Medvedev said there was a strong consensus, now shared by Gorbachev's 
supporters, that it is best to proceed Monday with what party officials regard 
as a crucial congress. 
</P>
<P>
"I view with understanding the proposals to postpone the congress, but the 
train has already left the station," Medvedev told a press conference. "Many 
leaders in the republics and regions (of the country) were in favor of sticking 
to the dates already established. This is the predominant opinion in the party. 
In my view, the congress will take place July 2." 
</P>
<P>
That the Soviet leadership was even seriously considering the possibility of 
postponing the congress, however, testified to the considerable disarray across 
the political spectrum, especially in the party hierarchy, as a result of the 
strong conservative push. 
</P>
<P>
A good case had been made for the delay, Medvedev said, but the leadership 
decided in the end that the negative impact would be greater than any gain. 
</P>
<P>
According to Medvedev, the suggestion of postponing the congress, months in 
preparation, arose because some provincial leaders were worried about gathering 
the earlier harvest and felt that too much time had already been taken up with 
political meetings. 
</P>
<P>
But party sources, liberals and conservatives alike, said that close Gorbachev 
advisers had raised the possibility of a postponement after conservative 
delegates took over another party conference last week and turned it into a 
forum that virtually put Gorbachev and perestroika on trial. 
</P>
<P>
Their quick calculations, these sources said, were that a repeat of such events 
at a full party congress -- about half the delegates are regarded as 
conservative -- would defeat Gorbachev's plan for a broader mandate for 
political and economic reforms and a fresh team to implement them. 
</P>
<P>
A postponement of the congress until fall, according to this thinking, would 
have deprived the conservatives of the momentum that they built up during the 
past three months. Last week, they elected one of Gorbachev's sharpest critics 
as the new leader of the Russian party. 
</P>
<P>
Boris N. Yeltsin, the populist president of Russia, the largest Soviet 
republic, was among those suggesting that the congress might be postponed until 
the autumn to "stabilize the political situation." He predicted a "real 
struggle" in the Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
But Medvedev, who canvassed party leaders around the country, said that the 
"political arguments in favor of perestroika are also in favor of not 
postponing the congress." 
</P>
<P>
Were the leadership to put off the congress, which Gorbachev had twice brought 
forward from next spring, it would signal to the nation that the conservatives 
had wrested control of the party away from the reformers, according to most 
Soviet political observers. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect healthy perestroika forces to take care of that," Medvedev said when 
asked whether the congress would approve the platform and party reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed platform, which will become the party's basic policy statement, 
focuses on measures to pull the country out of its deepening political, 
economic and social crises. 
</P>
<P>
It urges emergency measures to speed the transition to a market economy, to 
increase the supply of food and consumer goods and to build more houses but 
also balance the state budget and cut defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
It also calls for steps to fight crime, improve health care and increase 
environmental protection. And, in response to spreading ethnic conflicts, it 
sets forth as a priority the drafting of a new treaty linking the country's 
constituent republics. 
</P>
<P>
Entitled "Toward a Humane, Democratic Socialism" and described by Medvedev as 
deliberately broad to avoid splitting the party along ideological lines, the 
policy statement breaks ideologically with the party's historic position, 
noting its "heritage" from Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and V. I. Lenin but 
declaring that good ideas must be taken from wherever they are found. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Soviet Union's problems stem from its previous "distortion of 
socialism," the platform argues in support of adherence to the "socialist 
choice." 
</P>
<P>
"False ideas about socialism as a society based on the state monopoly on 
property and dictatorship led by the party-state bosses in the name of the 
proletariat has brought tyranny and lawlessness and the alienation of people 
from property and authority," it says. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to keep as many radical reformers within the party as possible 
despite their threats to quit and form a new party, the platform was rewritten 
to assure a place for multiple structures within the Communist Party and to 
relax the once rigid discipline of centralism that subordinated each party unit 
to another above it.

CONSERVATIVE PARTIES IN FRANCE UNITE IN FRONT TO CURB EXTREMISTS

France's two leading opposition parties have formed a united front to stop 
voters drifting toward the extreme right-wing National Front of Jean-Marie Le 
Pen. 
</P>
<P>
Paris Mayor and former Prime Minister Jacques Chirac and former President 
Valery Giscard d'Estaing announced late Tuesday night they had struck a deal to 
unite their Rally for the Republic Party (RPR) and Union for French Democracy 
(UDF) parties under a new label, "Union for France." 
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, the Union is to present a single candidate in the 1995 
presidential race who will be elected in a U.S.-style primary election of 
right-wing voters and local council members. 
</P>
<P>
In other ballots, notably the 1993 general elections, the new movement, to be 
headed by a 30-person executive, will designate a joint candidate for each 
constituency. 
</P>
<P>
Giving a clear signal that it aims to avoid local electoral deals with Le Pen's 
National Front, a 10-point charter signed by the two leaders said backing will 
be restricted to candidates "who defend its political and moral values." 
</P>
<P>
The National Front has outdistanced the conservative right in several recent 
by-elections and according to opinion polls could muster around 17% of the vote 
if an election were held now. 
</P>
<P>
"After 10 years of talk about union, the emergency caused by the growth of the 
National Front has finally spawned a new political tool," the left-leaning 
daily Liberation said. "But will it bring back the voters lost to the extreme 
right?" 
</P>
<P>
Both Chirac's neo-Gaullist RPR and the group of parties under Giscard 
d'Estaing's leadership in the umbrella UDF are suffering from internal strife 
and loss of morale after a string of electoral losses against the Socialists 
since 1988.

East-West talks on cutting conventional forces in Europe were given a major 
boost Wednesday when the Soviet Union agreed to proposals on how to reduce the 
number of tanks and armored cars in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and 
the Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
NATO delegates said that at a working meeting of the Conventional Forces in 
Europe talks, the Soviet side dropped objections to a Franco-Polish compromise 
on definitions and ceilings on how many of the arms each side can hold. 
</P>
<P>
This leaves open the question of new ceilings for artillery, described by 
Western delegates as relatively simple, and the whole issue of aircraft, seen 
as a much more difficult problem. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a significant step forward," one Western delegate said of the Soviet 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow raised last-minute objections to the compromise two weeks ago, saying it 
needed more information on weapons systems. 
</P>
<P>
This raised speculation then that Moscow was trying to slow down the talks 
because of concern over German unification, although privately they were 
telling Western delegates it was a bureaucratic problem only. 
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough appeared to boost the chances of a conventional forces 
agreement this year, opening the way for a summit of the 35-nation Conference 
on Security and Cooperation in Europe to discuss the new situation in Europe 
with Germany united. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has made a conventional forces agreement a condition of its 
participation at such a conference.

FUNDS SOUGHT TO CLEAR TOXICS AT CLOSING MILITARY BASES; 
</P>

FENCED OFF AND USELESS FOR YEARS UNLESS ACTION IS TAKEN NOW.

Legislation was introduced Wednesday earmarking $81.6 million to start cleaning 
up hazardous waste sites at military bases slated for closing across the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
Unless money is set aside specifically for the task, congressmen warned that 
some of 86 bases being closed by the Pentagon over the next five years could 
pose long-term threats to the environment and could wind up fenced off for 
years -- or forever -- awaiting cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is particularly pressing because the Defense Department, hoping to 
ease the economic impact of the base closings, has promised local communities 
that the sites could be used as industrial parks, housing developments or other 
activities that would provide jobs and other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot leave these facilities lying fallow for years before the cleanup and 
transfer of the property is completed," said Rep. Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento), who 
proposed the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Similar concerns were expressed in a resolution introduced Monday in the 
General Assembly in California. 
</P>
<P>
Fazio's bill drew immediate support from Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), chairman of 
the House Armed Services Committee, and Rep. Bill Lowery (R-San Diego), both of 
whom attended a press conference with Fazio, as well as from the Natural 
Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. 
</P>
<P>
The money, which would come from the Pentagon's existing budget for 
environmental cleanups, would be only the first installment on a bill of 
unknown proportions for dealing with toxic pollution at bases as they are 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the government estimates that it will cost as much as $80 million 
to clean up the Presidio in San Francisco, which is scheduled to be closed and 
turned into a national park. 
</P>
<P>
The White House Office of Management and Budget estimates that cleaning up 
toxic waste at facilities owned by the federal government will cost $140 
billion to $200 billion over the next 30 years. The Pentagon's cleanup program 
is concentrating on the worst sites first. 
</P>
<P>
But Fazio and Aspin said that priority should go to bases being closed now so 
that they can be put to productive uses as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
As an example of what could happen under current regulations, Fazio mentioned 
Hamilton Field, a former military airfield in the Marin County town of Novato. 
Two developers agreed in 1985 to pay $45 million for 400 acres at the closed 
base. But the deal has not become final because the Pentagon has still not 
cleaned up a 26-acre toxic dump on the property. 
</P>
<P>
Fazio's bill would transfer $81.6 million from the current Pentagon 
environmental cleanup budget to a separate fund that could be used only for 
bases being closed. That way, he said, the sites would not have to compete with 
active bases, where the pollution may be worse. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, some money raised through the sale of closed bases would be used 
to clean up other bases in the future. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation also would establish an interagency task force to report to 
Congress on ways to expedite cleanups at bases being closed. Its members would 
include the Defense and Justice departments, the Environmental Protection 
Agency, the Army Corps of Engineers and representatives of state environmental 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) has introduced a 
resolution calling on the state Department of Health Services to adopt a policy 
spelling out state demands that the military clean up bases before it closes 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution, introduced last Monday, would require that the policy detailing 
cleanup procedures be adopted by July 31, 1991. The measure noted that toxic 
pollution "is a major obstacle to reuse" of the bases slated for closure.

CUT IN NUCLEAR WASTE REGULATION PLANNED 
</P>

<P>
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission Wednesday unveiled plans for systematically 
exempting very low-level radioactive materials from regulatory control, opening 
the possibility of recycling such waste, disposing of it in landfills or 
reusing nuclear sites with some residual contamination. 
</P>
<P>
Commission Chairman Kenneth M. Carr outlined the proposed policy with a promise 
that every exemption would receive sharp scrutiny, but it was greeted by an 
angry reaction from anti-nuclear activists, including a call for Congress to 
seek the removal of all five members of the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez) announced that his Interior and Insular Affairs 
subcommittee on energy and the environment would call commission members to 
testify at a hearing on the proposal July 27. 
</P>
<P>
By some estimates, the low-level waste generated by nuclear power plants, 
research institutions and medical facilities accounts for 30% of the material 
regulated by the NRC. It includes such things as cleaning rags and clothing 
discarded by workers at nuclear power plants, tracers used in diagnostic tests 
in medical centers and bedding from animal cages in research laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
The heart of the new policy is a proposal to consider declaring materials 
"below regulatory interest" when they expose small numbers of people to a 
radiation dose of less than 10 millirem per year, or mass exposure of one-tenth 
of a millirem per year. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, NRC officials pointed out, the average American receives a 
natural exposure of about 300 millirem per year -- 30 millirem from cosmic 
radiation, 40 millirem from food and drink, 30 millirem from soils and building 
materials and 200 millirem from the air, which contains radioactive radon. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the NRC has considered applications for exemptions on a case-by-case 
basis, and Carr said that the new policy is intended not only to allow 
authorities to concentrate on regulating materials posing a more significant 
hazard but to assure more consistent protection of health and safety. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal will soon be scheduled for public hearings at NRC regional offices 
in California, Georgia, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Robert M. Bernero, director of the NRC's Office of Nuclear Material Safety and 
Safeguards, said that within the professional staff designing the proposal 
"there has been disagreement, even heated disagreement, and there is to this 
day." 
</P>
<P>
But he said the debate has centered not on the wisdom of adopting a "below 
regulatory interest" policy but upon the exposure limits. 
</P>
<P>
Hypothetically, the NRC estimated, lifetime exposure at the limits set in the 
proposal would be expected to cause five annual cancer deaths per 100,000 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Bernero said he had presented the proposal to officials of the Environmental 
Protection Agency Tuesday, but the agency offered no reaction. 
</P>
<P>
Carr noted that there are already a number of consumer products, such as 
watches with tritium-illuminated dials, on the market. 
</P>
<P>
"We must each realize," he said, "that when we buy our smoke detectors or 
choose to take a cross-country flight, we are already making decisions about 
radiation that are like 'below regulatory concern.' There is no human endeavor 
that involves a zero level of risk, and radiation is no exception. But the 
levels of radiation we are talking about here, while not zero, are exceedingly 
small." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the proposal criticized it as an invitation to unacceptable health 
risks and as a sop to the nuclear industry.

SCIENTISTS FIND FIRST INTACT FOSSIL OF ONE OF EARTH'S EARLIEST ANIMALS; 
</P>
<P>
SCIENCE: THEY SAY A 550-MILLION-YEAR-OLD SLUG WILL SHED LIGHT ON A KEY PERIOD 
OF EVOLUTION. THE DISCOVERY REVEALS SOME 'ENTIRELY UNEXPECTED' FEATURES.

<P>
On a shale-covered hillside on the inaccessible northern shore of Greenland, 
British and Danish researchers have for the first time found intact fossils of 
one of the first complex animals to inhabit the Earth, a discovery that sheds 
new light on a crucial period of evolution that is still largely hidden by 
time. 
</P>
<P>
The animal, a two-inch-long, armor-coated slug called a halkieriid, dates from 
the period 550 million years ago when the Earth's inhabitants abruptly evolved 
from single-celled microorganisms to multi-celled species. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, paleontologists had discovered millions of bits and pieces of 
shells of the halkieriids, which dominated the Earth's oceans. But they were 
unsure how to put them together because the organism was unlike anything that 
is alive today. 
</P>
<P>
The new discovery, reported today in the British journal Nature, indicates that 
some of the researchers' speculations about the shape of the animal were 
accurate, but it reveals "entirely unexpected" features of the creature. 
</P>
<P>
Their finding is "an extraordinary discovery . . . (that) answers the prayers 
of many paleontologists," said paleontologist Stefan Bengtson of Uppsala 
University in Sweden. It is "truly remarkable," added paleontologist Stephen 
Jay Gould of Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
The new specimen, furthermore, is the first from a treasure trove of new 
fossils that may finally bring order into the jumbled family relationships that 
now characterize this unusual period of time. 
</P>
<P>
The Cambrian period, which began about 550 million years ago, has long 
intrigued evolutionary biologists because it was the focus of an unprecedented 
sweep of events that quite literally changed the face of nature. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 3.5 billion years, the Earth's oceans had been filled with 
bacteria, algae and a host of other single-celled microorganisms. Then 
suddenly, over the geologically minuscule period of a few million years, those 
swarms of microorganisms gave way to the complex plants and animals that were 
the ancestors of today's life. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists are still not sure why the changes occurred, but it was most likely 
because the concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere rose to a critical level, 
sparking the evolution of species that could take advantage of the higher 
concentrations. 
</P>
<P>
"This event still dazzles us and stands as a major biological revolution on a 
par with" the development of reproduction, Bengtson wrote in a commentary in 
Nature. "The animal phyls emerged out of the Precambrian mists with most of the 
attributes of their modern descendants." 
</P>
<P>
The primitive creatures left behind many traces of their passage, primarily 
fossils of small parts of their anatomies scattered and intermingled. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost as if someone took a thousand jigsaw puzzles and threw them out 
the window of a tall building," said paleontologist S. Conway Morris of the 
University of Cambridge, a co-author of the new paper with paleontologist John 
S. Peel of the Geological Society of Greenland, which is headquartered in 
Copenhagen. 
</P>
<P>
"Paleontologists are traditionally famous (or infamous) for reconstructing 
whole animals from the debris of death," wrote Bengtson. "Mostly they cheat," 
modeling the long-dead species after still-living organisms that seem to share 
similar characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
But deducing the shape of the Cambrian species, most of which have no 
contemporary counterparts, is much more difficult. "For such work, we must 
employ a combination of vivid imagination, scrupulous pedantry and deep 
humility." 
</P>
<P>
Researchers have pieced together the shapes of many animals of the Cambrian 
period, but their uncertainty about their conclusions is reflected in the often 
whimsical species names chosen: Hallucigenia, Anomalocaris, . . . inexpectans. 
They think Hallucigenia, for example, stood on seven pairs of pointed spines 
and carried a pair of tentacles on its back. Compared to this, the halkieriids 
must have seemed rather prosaic, simple slug-like worms bearing a suit of 
articulated armor. 
</P>
<P>
The new site is on the Arctic Ocean in the Peary Land area of Greenland. "It's 
not the most accessible place in the world . . . and the weather is rather 
ghastly," Morris said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
The first fossils from the site were brought back in 1988 by two geologists 
with no training in paleontology. They showed the fossils to Peel "and 
immediately we realized they were significant," Morris said. Morris, Peel and 
two other researchers spent three weeks there last summer collecting specimens. 
</P>
<P>
"You can sit on a hillside covered with loose shale and choose what you want," 
he continued. "Nobody had ever collected there before. (The fossils) are just 
lying on the ground waiting." Among the specimens they found were ancestors of 
crabs, spiders, worms and sponges. 
</P>
<P>
But the "most spectacular" of the specimens they have studied so far are the 
halkieriid fossils, the first completely intact specimen of any organism from 
that era. "It's an interesting beast," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Morris, an elder statesman among Cambrian period paleontologists, and others 
had predicted that the halkieriids were basically worms covered with hundreds 
of small shells that provided protection while allowing movement. But they were 
astounded to see that the organism had two large round shells, one at each end. 
That was "a complete surprise to us." 
</P>
<P>
The question now, Bengtson said, is "where do they come from?" He speculated 
that the halkieriids might have evolved from a clam-shaped organism, growing 
the smaller shells as its length expanded. Alternatively, it might have evolved 
the shield-like shells on each end to protect both openings of a U-shaped 
burrow. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Morris and Peel are studying and classifying the other fossils 
obtained from the area and are confident that the work will shed much light on 
the Early Cambrian. "It turns out that the organization of species (in that 
period) is really much more complicated than we had thought," Morris concluded, 
"but we should be able to work out many evolutionary relationships."

MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY ADVANCE REPORTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second time in three weeks, researchers have reported promising results 
in humans with a proposed new genetic therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. 
</P>
<P>
At a Wednesday press conference, a Canadian researcher said that the unusual 
therapy has been found to be both safe and feasible in tests on three young 
boys, but that it is too early to tell if the treatment is effective in 
reversing the course of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
The new therapy involves injecting healthy muscle cells alongside diseased 
muscles. Experiments in animals suggest that the injected cells will fuse with 
the patient's muscle cells and cause them to produce a protein that is missing 
in victims of the degenerative disease. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, neurologist Peter J. Law of the University of Tennessee 
reported that the therapy led to the production of the missing protein in a 
small toe muscle of a 12-year-boy with the disease -- the first time that any 
form of genetic therapy has been shown to work in humans. 
</P>
<P>
The new findings announced by neurologist George Karpati of the Montreal 
Neurological Institute represent a significant step beyond Law's results, 
experts said, because the muscle he studied -- the biceps of the arm -- is 30 
times as large as the toe muscle and requires the injection of a much larger 
number of cells, as many as 60 million. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's confirmation of the earlier results "gives us cause to be 
optimistic" about the success of the therapy, said pediatric neurologist Leon 
I. Charash, chairman of the Muscular Dystrophy Assn.'s medical advisory 
committee, "but it is still very early in the game." 
</P>
<P>
But Karpati refused to reveal whether the treated muscles were producing the 
missing protein. "We don't want to make any premature statements about efficacy 
of the therapy because we don't want to raise false hopes," he said. But 
Karpati is optimistic that the treatment will be found to be effective, and he 
is laying the groundwork for studies in which the healthy cells will be fused 
with more vital muscles, such as those that control breathing. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, researchers in San Francisco plan to begin human trials of the new 
therapy in August or September, and a separate group in Boston will begin by 
the end of the year. Karpati said he hopes that his report of the safety of the 
procedure will stimulate other researchers to try it, thereby increasing the 
likelihood that an effective treatment regimen will be discovered. 
</P>
<P>
About one in every 3,500 boys born in the United States has the genetic defect 
that causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Females can be carriers of the gene, 
but rarely contract the disorder. 
</P>
<P>
The affected babies appear normal at birth, but develop a progressive weakening 
of the muscles that usually places them in a wheelchair by the age of 11. There 
is no current therapy and most die in their late teens or early 20s when the 
muscles that operate the heart and lungs cease functioning. 
</P>
<P>
The new results are all the more surprising because it was only 2 1/2 years ago 
that researchers discovered the defective gene that causes Duchenne MD. The 
healthy gene is the blueprint for a protein, called dystrophin, that allows 
muscle cells to function properly. 
</P>
<P>
The new therapy is possible because each muscle cell, unlike cells elsewhere in 
the body, has hundreds to thousands of nuclei, each with its own genetic 
information. Muscle tissue also contains immature cells, called myoblasts, that 
can fuse with existing muscle cells, insert their own healthy nuclei and cause 
the muscles to regenerate. 
</P>
<P>
Karpati has so far treated three boys 6 to 8. In each case, he isolated about 
10,000 healthy myoblasts from the boy's father and grew them in the laboratory 
until he had obtained more than 60 million. 
</P>
<P>
He then made a series of 55 injections along the biceps in one arm of each boy, 
injecting about 1 million cells at each site. An equal number of sham 
injections of salt water were made along the biceps of the opposite arm as a 
control. 
</P>
<P>
Karpati noted that critics of the procedure argued that there were many 
possible deleterious effects that could be caused by the procedure, including 
rejection, infection, hemorrhage, scarring, prolonged pain and so forth. "None 
of these things happened," he said.

POLICE STUN GUN USED ON EPILEPTIC DRIVER; 
</P>
<P>
VENTURA: OFFICIALS CONFIRM THAT THE OFFICER FIRED THE HIGH-VOLTAGE DEVICE NINE 
TIMES AFTER THE MAN, STILL GROGGY FROM A SEIZURE, DID NOT GET OUT OF HIS CAR.

<P>
A 26-year-old Ventura man, disoriented after an epileptic seizure that caused 
him to pass out while driving Saturday evening, was shocked repeatedly with a 
stun gun by a Ventura police officer when the man refused to get out of his 
truck, police have confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Donn Christensen Jr., a former Ventura disc jockey and an automobile salesman, 
was jolted up to nine times with a 50,000-volt Nova stun gun by motorcycle 
Officer Steven Mosconi, the officer said in a report released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Christensen and two witnesses to the incident said in interviews Wednesday that 
Mosconi not only used the stun gun to force the groggy driver out of his truck 
but shocked him at least twice after the man was standing passively beside the 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
One witness said the officer was berserk. Another witness said Mosconi cursed 
and threatened him. A third said the officer called him a liar. 
</P>
<P>
"What I needed was medical attention and I got anything but," said Christensen, 
who was not ticketed for his driving or charged with a crime. "Once you have a 
seizure it's like you've been hit by Mike Tyson. I didn't know where I was. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing I was aware of," he said, was that Mosconi "was pulling on my 
arm and yelling at me. Then he grabs my arm again and lifts it up and starts 
shooting me in the chest and abdomen and ribs, over and over again. It shocked 
so hard it knocked the wind out of me. I was in so much pain I could barely 
talk." 
</P>
<P>
Mosconi was off duty Wednesday and unavailable for comment, said Lt. Pat 
Rooney, Police Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The department is conducting a preliminary inquiry into the incident "to see if 
there are any improprieties," Rooney said. The district attorney's office has 
also apparently begun its own probe. Christensen said an investigator from that 
office called Wednesday to set up an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter D. Kossoris would not confirm the investigation, 
saying only that "we're certainly interested in what happened" to Christensen. 
</P>
<P>
Kossoris is conducting a separate criminal inquiry into the death of 
psychiatric patient Duane Johnson, an Oxnard man with heart disease who died in 
February after Ventura police shocked him repeatedly with stun guns while he 
was tethered to a bed. The county coroner found the stun gun -- a Taser weapon 
in that case -- to be one of three primary causes of the death. 
</P>
<P>
Both Nova and Taser stun guns discharge about 50,000 volts of electricity, 
which police say is similar to a jolt received when one touches a spark plug 
wire in an automobile that is running. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura police policy allows officers to use stun guns -- which are considered 
a non-lethal alternative to nightsticks and firearms -- to control people who 
pose a threat to officers or the public. 
</P>
<P>
They can also be used to force crime suspects to comply with officers' orders, 
as police say was the case with Johnson, the Oxnard man who died. 
</P>
<P>
Officers involved in the Johnson death were found to have acted within 
department policy. And Rooney said that if Mosconi used his stun gun only to 
get Christensen out of his truck, as the officer reports, then that also would 
probably be within policy. 
</P>
<P>
County Coroner F. Warren Lovell has called on the department to change its 
policy so the weapon can be used only when officers or the public are in 
danger. 
</P>
<P>
Mosconi responded Saturday evening to a three-car automobile accident that 
occurred when Christensen swerved in front of oncoming traffic near Thompson 
Boulevard and Howard Street at 6:12 p.m., according to police reports. 
</P>
<P>
Two cars braked to avoid him, and a third car, whose unidentified driver later 
fled, rammed one of the vehicles from behind, slightly injuring two people. 
</P>
<P>
When Mosconi arrived, he reported, a paramedic told him that Christensen had 
suffered a seizure. Mosconi noticed that the driver's eyes were "red and glassy 
and he appeared to be very much disoriented." 
</P>
<P>
Mosconi said he ordered Christensen out of his truck because the man still had 
his keys and could have driven away. Christensen, whom Mosconi described as 
very strong, refused to allow himself to be pulled from the vehicle and refused 
to hand over his keys, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
As a warning, Mosconi said he showed Christensen the arch of electricity that 
flowed from one prong of the small, hand-held stun gun to the other. But the 
driver still refused to turn over his keys and get out. 
</P>
<P>
The officer said he applied a short electrical burst to the torso of the 
driver, who again refused to comply with orders. 
</P>
<P>
"We repeated this approximately six to eight more times at which point 
Christensen finally yielded," Mosconi reported. He mentioned no further use of 
the stun gun. 
</P>
<P>
But two witnesses, both employees of a nearby auto dealership, told The Times 
that they saw the officer continue to use the gun on Christensen. 
</P>
<P>
Witness Dawn LaRose, finance officer at Weber Motors, said Mosconi "went 
berserk. It seemed like he freaked out." 
</P>
<P>
Once Christensen was outside his truck, Mosconi "hit him again with the stun 
gun and the guy shook and backed up. The officer did it again. The kid was just 
standing there in amazement, not saying anything. He was no threat to anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Auto salesman Andy Chavez said he saw Mosconi walk up to Christensen and "start 
screaming at him, straight-arm him, and then he zapped him about three times. 
The guy wasn't fighting the officer at all." 
</P>
<P>
John Macik, general manager at Harbor Chrysler Used Cars, said that there was 
no problem until Mosconi arrived. A doctor, who had been shopping for a car, 
had quickly examined Christensen after the accident, diagnosing him as being in 
a seizure. A paramedic agreed, Macik said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything seemed to be under control," he said. But Macik said he then heard 
Mosconi screaming at Christensen, and he and three salesmen who saw all or part 
of the confrontation complained to Mosconi. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Get . . . out of my face or I'll arrest you.' He put his hand on his 
billy club and lunged his upper body within a few inches of my nose.' " 
</P>
<P>
Macik said he called the police station to complain and a corporal later talked 
with him and his salesman for about an hour. But, according to Rooney, no 
formal complaint was filed by them. 
</P>
<P>
Another auto salesman, who requested anonymity, said he asked Mosconi to loosen 
the handcuffs on Christensen, who had been placed by officers next to a fence 
while they investigated the auto accidents. 
</P>
<P>
The salesman said Mosconi recognized him as a witness to a 1982 chase by 
Mosconi of a speeding motorcyclist. The salesman said Mosconi accused him 
Saturday of lying in the 1982 case. 
</P>
<P>
According to court records, the 1982 chase ended when the motorcyclist crashed 
into an automobile and died. A 13-year-old boy in the car lost an eye, 
according to his attorney, Richard A. Regnier, who said the boy received 
"several hundred thousand dollars" from the city to settle the lawsuit in 1985. 
City attorneys could not immediately confirm the settlement until they reviewed 
their files. 
</P>
<P>
Christensen said that after Mosconi pulled him from his truck, he was 
handcuffed and waited for almost an hour before police took him to Ventura 
County Medical Center for an examination. 
</P>
<P>
According to Mosconi's report, a doctor confirmed Christensen's seizure. The 
doctor said that "oftentimes people in this state are agitated and hostile and 
that would explain Christensen's agitated attitude and his refusal to cooperate 
with me," the officer reported. 
</P>
<P>
Christensen said he was passive. 
</P>
<P>
"I could barely walk," he said. "And the last thing I wanted was a run-in with 
the Police Department." 
</P>
<P>
Christensen said he has had only four or five seizures since they first began 
to occur 11 years ago, when he was 15. 
</P>
<P>
He received a driver's license in 1983 after a doctor verified that he had been 
free of seizures for two years, Christensen said.

MAN WON'T FACE CHARGES IN POLICE ASSAULT CASE; 
</P>
<P>
CLASH: AN OXNARD RESIDENT WILL BE CITED ONLY WITH RESISTING ARREST. HE AND HIS 
BROTHERS SAY THEY WERE BEATEN WITHOUT PROVOCATION.

<P>
The district attorney's office has decided not to file a charge of assaulting a 
police officer against an Oxnard man who claims he and several other guests at 
a private party were beaten by Oxnard police officers. 
</P>
<P>
The police arrested Anthony Flores, 22, on suspicion of assaulting an officer 
during a June 15 clash involving 18 officers and about 12 party guests at a 
home in the 1300 block of South E Street. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested for resisting arrest and interfering with an arrest were his brothers, 
Luis Flores, 24, and Alex Flores, 19, and another party-goer, Aurelio Raudales 
Guerrero, 19. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began when four officers answered complaints of a loud party at 
the home of Luis Flores Sr. 
</P>
<P>
A police report said Anthony Flores started the fight by shoving a policeman. 
Anthony Flores and his brothers, all of whom suffered gashes and scrapes on 
their heads and bodies, said the police beat them without provocation. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Robert Owens last week ordered an investigation into the incident. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation said the agency has also 
begun an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the district attorney's office said Wednesday that Anthony Flores 
will not be charged with assault on an officer when he is arraigned Friday. 
Instead, Flores will face five misdemeanor charges of resisting arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Flores will face three charges of resisting arrest. Guerrero, who is 
scheduled for trial on July 11, has pleaded innocent to one count of resisting 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney has filed no charges against Luis Flores. 
</P>
<P>
Each charge of resisting arrest carries a maximum penalty of one year in county 
jail and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald Grant called the confrontation a "major brawl" but 
declined to say why the assault charges were dropped against Anthony Flores. 
</P>
<P>
"Based upon my review of all the reports, the charges were the most appropriate 
charges to file," he said of the resistance charge, declining to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Auer, supervisor for the Ventura office of the FBI, said the agency will 
investigate because "the information in the newspapers indicated that there may 
be federal civil rights violations." 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Owens noted that the existence of an FBI investigation does not 
imply a finding of wrongdoing by his men. He declined to comment on the 
district attorney's decision not to file assault charges against Anthony 
Flores.

VENTURA COAST KEEPS ITS COOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
While most of Southern California sweltered under triple-digit temperatures, 
western Ventura County was bathed in refreshing ocean breezes that kept 
temperatures below 85 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Westerly winds pushed a cool marine layer onshore, maintaining temperatures in 
the 70s and low 80s in Oxnard, Ventura and Port Hueneme for most of the day. In 
contrast, other coastal areas to the south, such as Santa Monica, broke the 
90-degree mark. To the north, Santa Barbara stayed above 100 degrees during 
much of the afternoon. Inland, temperatures were even higher. 
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists said coastal cities on the Oxnard Plain luck out because the 
area is the only break between two mountain ranges up and down the coast, 
opening a funnel for cooling ocean breezes. On Wednesday, west-northwesterly 
winds were between 20 m.p.h. and 30 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
"That's your air conditioning right there," said Bill Hibbert, a meteorologist 
for WeatherData Inc. "The ocean is your saving grace." In other coastal areas, 
he said, the winds were not coming directly off the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
The sea breezes and distant mountains sheltered Ventura County from the 
high-pressure center in the Four Corners area -- the spot joining Arizona, New 
Mexico, Colorado and Utah -- that is directly responsible for the heat wave. 
"Ventura is kind of protected and that helps," said Art Horton of the National 
Weather Service in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Oblivious to the geographical reasons, many people enjoyed another glorious 
summer day in western Ventura County while other Southern Californians hovered 
near air-conditioning vents to beat the heat. 
</P>
<P>
At Golf 'n' Stuff, a mini-golf course in Ventura off the Ventura Freeway, for 
example, hundreds of vacationing families took aim with their putters without 
so much as breaking a sweat. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we're pretty lucky," said Lynell Kogimo of Oxnard, who was at the 10th 
hole with her husband and her 5-year-old son. "This is Ventura -- it's always 
consistent out here. A little bit of everything but not too much of one thing."

THOUSAND OAKS, OJAI BACK SALES TAX HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thousand Oaks and Ojai have joined eight other Ventura County cities in 
supporting a ballot measure that would raise a local sales tax half a cent to 
pay for road construction. 
</P>
<P>
Both city councils voted unanimously Tuesday night to place the measure, which 
would help the county take advantage of new gasoline taxes, before voters in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
The measure needs support from a majority of the county's 10 cities to qualify 
for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The issue now goes to the Board of Supervisors on July 2 for final approval. 
</P>
<P>
According to officials, if voters approve the half-cent sales tax, the county 
could receive $130 million for road work over the next 10 years. The county 
would already receive $200 million of the $18.5 billion expected to be raised 
under Proposition 111, a 9-cent-a-gallon gas tax approved by voters in June.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: PAIR TO BE ARRAIGNED ON FORGERY CHARGES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two people who police say are part of a ring that has cashed about $2 million 
in forged checks in Ventura and Los Angeles counties are to be arraigned today 
in Ventura Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Jones, 49, and Marilyn Wilkerson, 40, both of Los Angeles, were arrested 
Tuesday as they tried to cash a forged check at a Security Pacific Bank at 152 
W. Hillcrest Drive in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
They had about 20 stolen and forged checks totaling $1,300 in their possession, 
Ventura County Sheriff's Detective Bob LeMay said. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe that the two belong to a group that has passed at least 30 
forged and stolen checks in Ventura County and at least 100 in Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
LeMay said the pair are suspected of being "mules" who cashed checks stolen 
from the mail and in burglaries. "We think they're associated with a major 
fraud group," he said, adding that the group is believed to be operating in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Jones and Wilkerson were booked at Ventura County Jail on suspicion of forgery 
and possession of forged checks and stolen property. JACK SEARLES

<P>
The Ventura County Sheriff's Department unveiled a new radar-equipped trailer 
Wednesday that will display the speed of approaching cars on Camarillo's 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
The speed scoreboard, donated by the Tri-County Traffic School of Thousand 
Oaks, was demonstrated behind Camarillo's City Hall during the weekly City 
Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The school runs classes for traffic violators. 
</P>
<P>
Besides showing an oncoming car's speed, the scoreboard also displays the speed 
limit in the area, said Sgt. Bill Boyd, traffic supervisor of the sheriff's 
Camarillo station. 
</P>
<P>
"It's primarily an educational device, but if a driver is exceeding the speed 
limit, he should remember that officers will be around to make sure the law is 
observed," Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
The scoreboard, which cost $7,570, will be used throughout Camarillo starting 
next week, Boyd said. JACK SEARLES

DEVELOPER DEEDS LAND FOR SCHOOL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A developer has deeded six acres of land worth more than $1 million to the 
Pleasant Valley School District for construction of a new school in eastern 
Camarillo, where district officials say more classrooms are badly needed. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached between Pardee Construction Co. and the school 
district, the developer is handing over the property on Woodcreek Road, north 
of Mission Oaks Boulevard, in lieu of developer's fees. 
</P>
<P>
Such fees, required under state law, are used to help districts finance new 
schools in fast-growing communities. 
</P>
<P>
The district, which projects it will have 6,250 students next school year, has 
been growing at a rate of about 150 students a year, and in recent years has 
started busing children from schools in the eastern part of the city to western 
Camarillo schools to help ease overcrowding, said Howard Hamilton, assistant 
superintendent for administrative services. 
</P>
<P>
School officials approached Pardee with the proposal because the district is 
short on cash for new school construction, Hamilton said. Under the agreement, 
the district will credit the developer with future development fees equal to 
the value of the property. 
</P>
<P>
School officials are now seeking ways to pay for the estimated $6 million in 
construction, including a possible bond measure on the ballot. ADRIANNE GOODMAN

VANDERKOLK GETS FREE OFFICE SPACE; 
</P>
<P>
THOUSAND OAKS: WITHOUT PUBLIC NOTICE, THE CITY COUNCIL VOTES TO PROVIDE SPACE 
IN THE OLD LIBRARY UNTIL SHE TAKES OFFICE AS SUPERVISOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Thousand Oaks City Council voted without public notice late Tuesday night 
to give Ventura County Supervisor-elect Maria VanderKolk a furnished office at 
the old city library, prompting a complaint to the Ventura County district 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
"It was late at night and they railroaded through a proposal to spend public 
funds on Maria VanderKolk without any comment from the public," said resident 
Greg Cole, a Ventura County Community College District trustee and former 
Thousand Oaks planning commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
"Their conduct was outrageous," said Cole, a supporter of Supervisor Madge L. 
Schaefer, who was defeated by VanderKolk in the June election. Cole said the 
council may have violated the state's open-meeting law. 
</P>
<P>
He was so irritated that the council did not place the item on the agenda or 
allow public comment on the issue that he complained to the district attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Matthew J. Hardy said he will look into the matter, 
as he does on all alleged violations of the open-meetings law. Hardy said he 
would not elaborate on the council action until he knows more about the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks City Atty. Mark G. Sellers defended the council's action, saying 
VanderKolk needed the office space immediately. As a result, the council voted 
4-1 Tuesday night to declare the situation an emergency, allowing it to bypass 
public notice requirements and approve the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Under the council's decision, VanderKolk will be allowed to use the old library 
office on Wilbur Road rent-free until she takes over Schaefer's position in 
January. At that time, the county will provide VanderKolk with money to rent 
office space in the 2nd Supervisorial District that is centered in Thousand 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to give her a place to get started," Councilman Frank Schillo said. 
</P>
<P>
Sellers said if there is a question of legality, the council has the option of 
placing the issue on the agenda and voting on the measure again at its July 10 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The issue was brought up by Mayor Alex Fiore after 11 p.m., near the end of 
Tuesday's meeting. The mayor told his colleagues that because the city has 
extra office space, the council should allow VanderKolk to move in temporarily 
"as a courtesy." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, Elois Zeanah, who had worked on VanderKolk's campaign, 
wrote a letter to the council requesting the space. "Maria has been besieged 
with telephone calls and research materials," Zeanah said in an interview. "She 
needs a place to work." 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Larry Horner, who cast the lone vote against declaring it an 
emergency situation, said that although he does not object to VanderKolk using 
the office, he believes the emergency action was inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot take action on a request like that unless it is calendared," Horner 
said. "She could have used her home or other space until we placed it on the 
agenda. Quite frankly, I did not feel that it was an emergency."

A FAST NEW TAKE ON CHINESE COOKING; 
</P>
<P>
RECIPES: IN-HOUSE SEASONINGS AND CHINESE-COOKING METHODS MAKE QUICK WORK OF 
MEALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN HOM, Hom is the author of many cookbooks, including Fragrant Harbor 
Taste and Ken Hom's East Meets West Cuisine, published by Simon &amp; Schuster. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As my traveling, writing and consulting activities take up more and more of my 
time, I find myself designing meals based on the simplicity and rapidity of 
their preparation. These "quick and easy" recipes entail no sacrifice of 
quality, nor do they imply machine-made "fast food." The menus mean only that 
the more elaborate and time-consuming elements of Chinese cooking have been 
omitted or re-fashioned in order to expedite the preparation of authentic and 
delectable meals. The essence remains the same. 
</P>
<P>
I have been developing these quick and easy recipes and techniques throughout 
the years. Freshness of primary ingredients remains my first concern. I have, 
however, employed alternative techniques and allowed for substitution of 
secondary ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
This has not been as difficult as it might seem. Except for a few sauces and 
seasonings, authentic Chinese cookery doesn't depend upon ingredients the way, 
for example, Japanese cooking does. We substitute "Western" or processed foods 
and ingredients if necessary or desirable. Thus tomatoes, corn, potatoes, sweet 
potatoes, asparagus and a host of "alien" foods have been readily accepted into 
Chinese cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
Remember too that not all processed foods must be scorned. Canned tomatoes are 
an excellent substitute for fresh, and frozen vegetables are sometimes superior 
to (and less expensive than) fresh but out-of-season varieties. 
</P>
<P>
Techniques too may be modified as the time available permits. Pressure cookers, 
electric mixers and slow cookers, food processors, even microwave ovens have 
been accepted into "authentic" Chinese kitchens. After all, even the wok was 
once an innovation. 
</P>
<P>
Technique and a few essential seasonings can make everyone's native foods 
"Chinese." They also make for excellent quick and easy food. What matters, once 
a pantry is stocked with some basic Chinese staples, is organization, the right 
recipes and experience. 
</P>
<P>
Use these recipes as a point of departure. When you shop, do it when you can 
take time; savor the experience of building a pantry. Note that some of the 
recipes have a longer list of ingredients. This is essential to capturing the 
flavors of authentic good cooking. Even quick and easy requires attention, but 
few things in this world are more worthy of time and concern.

 Scallops are fragile, sweetly delicate morsels and need very little 
preparation or cooking time. They embody the virtues of "quick, easy, 
delicious." In this recipe, they are combined with nutritious, flavorful and 
colorful sweet red and green peppers. The result is a festive-looking dish that 
belies its ease of preparation, perfect for a family meal or as the centerpiece 
of a dinner party prepared on short notice.

 This unusual fish dish makes perfectly cooked fish in almost no time at all. 
The fish is pounded thin (very easy to do) and then actually cooked on the 
plates, which, of course, must be heat-proof. The plates must be preheated to a 
very hot state. Carefully place a little oil on them, place the flattened 
fillets on the plates, add the heated sauce and the fish cooks through in about 
5 minutes. Timing and "touch" are important here. Practice this very quick dish 
a few times before you make it the feature of a dinner party. Once you have it 
mastered, it will delight guests. 
</P>
<P>
 Preparation Time: 15 minutes.

 Chinese cuisine offers some of the most delicious and stimulating barbecue 
sauces. This combination of sauces is delicious with chicken wings, 
transforming an inexpensive food into a delightful dish. Serve these tasty 
morsels with drinks. The recipe is meant for a large group, but for an even 
bigger gathering, simply double or triple the ingredients. They take a few 
minutes to cook but need no watching. Serve them hot or let them cool to room 
temperature. They are just as wonderful after they've cooled and thus make a 
most appropriate picnic dish.

<P>
 Preparation Time: 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Cooking Time: 35 minutes.

 This is a refreshing soup and makes a sparkling meal starter. It's a 
year-round favorite of mine because canned tomatoes are one of the few 
processed foods I use. Use fresh tomatoes when available, but remember, they 
cook quickly and need little preparation. Note: The soup reheats nicely.

GOOD COOKING: FRESH GREENS HELP LIGHTEN UP MEALS

Summer food typically means berries, corn, sun-ripened tomatoes and fragrant 
peaches. But some of summer's most wonderful foods are generally taken for 
granted. This is a shame, for while greens are available year-round, they are 
at their best in summer when they are young and tender. 
</P>
<P>
From a culinary point of view, greens have another advantage: They are the one 
ingredient that can be counted on to transform the heartiest dishes into light, 
appealing summer fare. 
</P>
<P>
As a broad category greens encompass many types: leafy green spinach, lettuce 
-- Boston, bibb, Romaine, chicory -- and bitter greens, such as dandelions, 
mustards and arugula. They range from sweet to bitter in taste, from tender to 
firm in texture, from very light to very dark in color. 
</P>
<P>
You'll discover that adding greens is easy and introduces new dimensions to 
many dishes. Recipes are hardly necessary to take advantage of the greens now 
in the marketplace; just add them, singly or in combination, to recipes or 
salads for lively new tastes. The Tucci Milan pizza, and the lamb and sausage 
loaf with greens, both seemingly hearty dishes, are significantly lightened by 
the addition of greens and should stimulate more ideas for incorporating greens 
into cooking. The Asian stir-fried fish on mixed greens is a different, but 
equally delicious, approach. And to serve greens on their own, simply saute 
them in olive oil with lots of minced garlic. 
</P>
<P>
Here, chilled bitter and sweet greens are tossed with an Asian vinaigrette and 
topped with hot stir-fried fish, making a sensational summer supper dish. 
Tilefish or catfish, both firm and sweet fleshed, are ideal; monkfish or even 
scallops would work well, too. For dinner, serve with side dishes of steamed 
asparagus and hot noodles tossed with seared onion slices. 
</P>
<P>
ASIAN STIR-FRIED FISH ON MIXED GREENS 
</P>
<P>
6 cups roughly cut greens (mix of dandelion, arugula, bibb, Boston), packed 
</P>
<P>
6 medium green onions, thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
2 medium carrots, peeled and finely shredded 
</P>
<P>
Asian Dressing 
</P>
<P>
1 large tilefish or catfish fillets (1 pound), cut into 1-inch cubes 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
Red pepper flakes 
</P>
<P>
Cilantro leaves 
</P>
<P>
Mint sprigs 
</P>
<P>
Combine mixed greens, green onions and carrots in large mixing bowl. (Greens 
can be mixed day ahead and refrigerated, tightly covered.) 
</P>
<P>
Heat 3 tablespoons Oriental Dressing in large, non-stick skillet over medium 
high heat. Season fish to taste with salt and red pepper flakes. When dressing 
is very hot, stir-fry half of fish until just done, about 2 minutes. Do not 
overcook. Set aside with pan juices. Repeat with remaining fish using another 3 
tablespoons dressing. 
</P>
<P>
To serve, gently toss chilled greens with remaining dressing. Adjust seasonings 
to taste. Divide salad between 4 chilled serving plates. On each salad, arrange 
equal portions of fish drizzled with pan juices. Garnish with cilantro and mint 
sprigs. Serve immediately. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Asian Dressing 
</P>
<P>
1 large clove garlic, peeled 
</P>
<P>
1 small piece peeled ginger root (1-inch diameter by 1/2-inch thick)

1/3 cup cilantro leaves 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup mint leaves 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup rice vinegar 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup orange juice 
</P>
<P>
7 tablespoons safflower oil 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon sesame oil 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 teaspoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
Red pepper flakes 
</P>
<P>
Mince garlic, ginger, cilantro and mint leaves together in food processor or 
blender. Add vinegar, orange juice, oils, sugar and salt. Mix well. Season to 
taste with red pepper flakes. (Dressing can be made day ahead and refrigerated, 
covered airtight.) 
</P>
<P>
 Here, mustard greens and spinach leaves lighten up the look and taste of meat 
loaf, making it a perfect option for picnics. As all meat loaf aficionados 
know, leftovers make the best sandwiches. The use of a food processor makes 
this dish even easier. 
</P>
<P>
LAMB AND SAUSAGE MEAT LOAF WITH GREENS 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons butter or margarine 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
2 medium stalks celery, chopped 
</P>
<P>
1 cup spinach leaves, packed 
</P>
<P>
1 cup mustard greens, roughly cut, packed 
</P>
<P>
3/4 teaspoon salt

12 ounces breakfast sausage 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup soft bread crumbs 
</P>
<P>
2 large eggs 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup catsup 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons milk

</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes 
</P>
<P>
Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
Heat butter in large non-stick skillet over medium high heat. Add garlic, green 
onions, mustard greens, celery, spinach leaves and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Saute 
until tender, about 6 minutes, stirring often. Transfer to large mixing bowl. 
Let cool slightly. 
</P>
<P>
Add ground lamb, sausage, bread crumbs, eggs, 1/4 cup catsup, milk, 
Worcestershire, cumin, red pepper flakes and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt to 
vegetables. Season to taste with pepper. Mix thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
Transfer to 13x9-inch baking pan. Pat into 8x6-inch oval shape, gently pressing 
with hands to compact loaf as much as possible. (Dish can be prepared day ahead 
to this point. Cover tightly and refrigerate.) 
</P>
<P>
Spread loaf with remaining 1/2 cup catsup. Bake in center of oven at 375 
degrees. Serve hot or at room temperature. Makes 6 to 8 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Summer or winter, this pizza with arugula salad, mozzarella, Calamata olives 
and roasted garlic from Tucci Milan in Chicago is one of the best I've tasted. 
Although Joe Decker, executive chef/partner of Lettuce Entertain You, and Troy 
Tomlinson, Tucci Milan chef, could not reveal their thin pizza crust secrets, 
the rest of the pizza runs true to their form. The roasted garlic and 
mozzarella base is the perfect foil for the bright, bitter arugula greens that 
are tossed in lemon juice and olive oil, then arranged with chopped Calamata 
olives on the cooked pizza. Refrigerating the dough after rising helps in 
rolling it very thin. 
</P>
<P>
TUCCI MILAN'S PIZZA MONTENAPOLEONE 
</P>
<P>
1 head garlic, cloves peeled 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup plus 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil 
</P>
<P>
Pizza Dough 
</P>
<P>
Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups grated low-fat mozzarella cheese 
</P>
<P>
2 cups roughly cut arugula leaves, packed 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup chopped Calamata olives 
</P>
<P>
Place oven rack in center of oven. Line oven rack with quarry tiles or pizza 
stone, if using. About 20 minutes before baking pizzas, preheat oven at 500 
degrees, or at highest oven temperature. 
</P>
<P>
Place garlic cloves and 1/2 cup olive oil in small oven-proof dish. Bake at 400 
degrees until tender, about 15 minutes. Do not let brown. Let cool 10 minutes. 
Use slotted spoon to remove cloves from oil. Puree in small food processor or 
blender with 4 tablespoons oil (use rest for salads or cooking). 
</P>
<P>
Divide roasted garlic puree between pizza doughs. Spread as evenly as possible 
to about 1-inch of dough edge. Season to taste with pepper. Divide mozzarella, 
sprinkling evenly over garlic. Bake until lightly browned on edges, about 3 to 
5 minutes directly on tiles or about 7 to 8 minutes in pizza pans. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, toss arugula leaves in lemon juice and remaining 2 teaspoons olive 
oil. When pizzas are baked, cut each into 10 slices but keep in original 
circle. Garnish with arugula. Dot with chopped olives. Serve immediately. Makes 
2 (12-inch) pizzas. 
</P>
<P>
Pizza Dough 
</P>
<P>
Cornmeal or semolina 
</P>
<P>
1 package dry yeast 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 cup warm water (105-115 degrees) 
</P>
<P>
3 cups flour 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
Grease 2 (12-inch) pizza pans, preferably black steel. Sprinkle with cornmeal. 
(If using pizza peel sprinkle with semolina and bake pizzas directly on tiles. 
) 
</P>
<P>
In large bowl, stir yeast and sugar into warm water. Let stand until foamy, 
about 10 minutes. Add flour, olive oil and salt. Mix until dough is smooth and 
elastic, about 1 minute in food processor, about 6 minutes with dough hook and 
10 minutes by hand. 
</P>
<P>
Transfer dough to large plastic food bag. Squeeze out air and twist-tie at top. 
Place bag in bowl. Let rise in warm place (oven with pilot or electric oven 
preheated 1 minute and turned off is ideal warmth) until doubled, about 1 hour. 
Punch dough down. (Dough can be used now or refrigerated up to 4 days in 
plastic bag.) 
</P>
<P>
Divide dough in half and let rest 15 minutes. Roll each piece on floured board 
to about 11-inch-diameter circle. Let rest several minutes, then roll or use 
fingers to press into 12-inch circle. Place on prepared peel or pan. Makes 2 
(12-inch) round pizza doughs.

ROAST DUCK SALAD IS AN EYE PLEASER; 
</P>
<P>
SALAD: MANGO, HONEYDEW AND CUCUMBER SLICES AND A SHOWER OF SPICY DRESSING MAKE 
SINGAPOREAN DELIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Contemporary Asian cooking presents traditional ingredients in smart new ways. 
An example from Singapore is a sophisticated duck salad that combines 
Cantonese-style roast duck with an eye-pleasing pattern of mango, honeydew and 
cucumber slices. Chopped roasted peanuts, sesame seeds and cilantro leaves are 
scattered over the top, and a spicy dressing is showered over the salad at the 
table. 
</P>
<P>
The recipe comes from Violet Oon, who often acts as an international 
spokesperson on Singaporean cuisine. In Singapore, she conducts cooking 
demonstrations and publishes the Food Paper, a compendium of restaurant 
reviews, recipes and general food news. Oon recently organized a Singaporean 
dinner for a food-and-wine tasting held in Aspen, Colo. She also prepared the 
salad for a dinner held in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Visiting markets here, Oon located most of the ingredients required for her 
native Straits Chinese cookery. Also known as peranakan or nonya food, this 
style resulted from the mixing of Chinese and Malay cultures in the historic 
Straits Settlements -- Penang, Malacca and Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
The salad calls for a Chinese-style roasted duck. These can be purchased at 
Chinatown delis, either whole or in the half portion required by the recipe. 
One could also substitute a home-roasted duck, or even poached chicken meat. 
</P>
<P>
For the duck marinade, Oon uses "cooked oil" -- oil that has been previously 
used to fry shallots. Oon says this removes any raw flavor from the oils. 
(Crisp, fried shallot shreds are a common topping for nonya dishes.) 
</P>
<P>
Ideal for warm weather, the salad is easy to make and requires little 
last-minute work. The duck meat can be placed in its marinade well in advance 
of serving. The dressing, which is based on such flavorful components as 
Chinese chili sauce, plum sauce and sesame oil, also can be prepared ahead of 
time. 
</P>
<P>
ROAST DUCK, MELON AND MANGO SALAD 
</P>
<P>
1/2 Chinese roasted duck 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon cooked oil (oil that has previously been used for frying shallots 
or mild onions) 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 teaspoons light soy sauce 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon oyster sauce 
</P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
1 semi-firm mango 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds 
</P>
<P>
Leaves from several sprigs cilantro 
</P>
<P>
Spicy Sauce 
</P>
<P>
Remove flesh from roasted duck and cut into fine strips. Marinate in mixture of 
cooked oil, sugar, light soy sauce and oyster sauce. Peel honeydew, pear, 
cucumber and mango and discard seeds. Cut in fine strips. 
</P>
<P>
Arrange fruit and cucumber strips in pattern on round serving platter, 
alternating colors. Place duck in center. Top salad with peanuts, sesame seeds 
and cilantro leaves. Chill. Pour Spicy Sauce over salad at table and toss. 
Makes 4 to 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Spicy Sauce 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons water 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 teaspoons catsup 
</P>
<P>
1 to 2 teaspoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon Chinese chili sauce 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon cornstarch 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons vegetable oil 
</P>

Otto and Son Import Store (Otto's Magyar Import Uzlet), 2320 W. Clark Ave., 
Burbank; (818) 845-0433. Hours: Monday through Saturday 8:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
When you step into Otto's Hungarian Market on Clark Avenue in Burbank, you're 
instantly back in Budapest. Old-fashioned cookware lines the walls. Polka music 
plays on a stereo. There's a comfortable clutter of jars and boxes holding the 
sorts of imported ingredients an Eastern European grandmother would clasp to 
her apron with joy. 
</P>
<P>
The door opens to let in a customer -- not a grandmother but a man in a 
business suit, one of Otto's regulars. He inhales the store's mixed aromas of 
smoked hams, garlicky sausages and freshly baked bread, letting out his breath 
in an appreciative "Ahhhh." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't charge for the smell," quips the store's ebullient owner, Otto Huber. 
The customer reviews the long sandwich menu behind the deli case, ordering his 
favorite combination of meats on the farmhouse-style rye that Otto's has baked 
for the store. Otto's sandwiches have spoiled everyone in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The store may look a bit antiquated, with its collection of potato ricers and 
jars of gooseberries in syrup, but there's plenty here for modern cooks. And 
Irma, Otto's wife, will counsel you on using the store's lesser-known 
ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
For example, lecso, a saute of garlic, onions, sweet pepper and a little tomato 
-- the base for many long-simmered Hungarian dishes -- is sold in jars. The 
reputation of a Hungarian cook rests on whether or not he can fry the onions 
for lecso to a perfect shade of gold. This takes patience and a watchful eye. 
But prepared lecso can turn chicken parts or veal into stews, sauced dishes or 
soups in a few minutes. Hungarians even serve lecso over pasta or topped with a 
fried egg. Although traditionally made with lard, the version at Otto's uses 
sunflower oil (this one is spelled letcho on the label, rather than lecso). 
</P>
<P>
Though Hungarian cooking usually brings to mind voluptuous sour cream-laced 
chicken paprikas or baroque gulyas, such meaty fare isn't eaten every day. At 
its heart, this cuisine is abundant with potato and vegetable dishes, cooked 
with small amounts of the sort of well-seasoned sausages or hams Otto's 
carries. Solid, nourishing Hungarian soups also make a little meat go a long 
way as do all kinds of noodles and dumplings. And Irma is full of advice on the 
finer points of preparing these dishes. 
</P>
<P>
SHOPPING LIST 
</P>
<P>
When the Hubers bought this store 20 years ago, it was a barely surviving 
corner market. But they started stocking Hungarian sausages from their favorite 
source in Chicago and that turned business around. Otto kept on adding new 
items, and today he has one of the most complete selections of Hungarian 
sausages and European hams around. 
</P>
<P>
HAMS: 
</P>
<P>
* Hungarian and Polish ham: Cured but not smoked, these imported "boiled" hams 
are totally lean and barely salty. 
</P>
<P>
* Gonayolt sonka: Called "string ham," it is boned, rolled and tied with string 
before getting a light smoking. Slice it medium thick to serve as an entree or 
thin to use in sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
* Black Forest ham: Extra-long smoking gives this dense ham its deep flavor. 
Superb in omelets, potato dishes and on egg bread for sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
* Westphalian ham: Dry cured and then smoked, this very lean ham is the most 
intensely flavored of all. It resembles prosciutto with a smoky flavor. 
</P>
<P>
* Fustolt karaj: This well-smoked filet mignon is like a cross between 
prosciutto and bresaola -- the Italian air-dried beef. The long brick-colored 
filets are sliced paper thin and served as cold cuts. They're sensational with 
sliced ripe tomatoes or the cabbage-stuffed pickled peppers sold here. 
</P>
<P>
* Italian prosciutto: Otto's carries prosciutto from Italy. 
</P>
<P>
BACONS 
</P>
<P>
* Fustolt szalona: An aged smoked bacon that adds a wonderful rich flavor to 
all kinds of dishes from soups and stews to noodles. 
</P>
<P>
* Abalt szalona: It's boiled with garlic in the piece, and Hungarians slice it 
thin to eat cold on dense rye bread. One variety is dusted with a coating of 
paprika. 
</P>
<P>
SAUSAGES 
</P>
<P>
Among Otto's collection of salami look for teli szalami, a hard "winter-style" 
dry salami, and Csabai or paprika salami, a spicier dry salami laced with 
garlic and paprika. It's originally from the town of Csabai, whose residents 
like their food hot. Nyari szalami, on the other hand, has milder seasonings 
and is a softer "summer" salami. Turista szalami is a mild fairly firm salami 
that, as you might guess, Hungarians like to take with them on trips. 
</P>
<P>
* Vadasz: Otherwise known as garlic salami, it is soft and closer in texture to 
bologna than the usual dry salami. Its smooth pink meat is flecked with a 
mosaic of pork chunks. 
</P>
<P>
* Parizsi: A supple veal bologna with a silky texture that will encourage you 
to forget about conventional lunch meats. For sandwiches, Otto layers thin, 
bread plate-sized slices of parizsi in his specially baked farmhouse-style rye. 
</P>
<P>
* Liverwurst: Otto's stocks the fine smooth calf's liverwurst and the chunky 
beef-liver style. Like his bologna, these are a far cry from standard lunch 
meats. 
</P>
<P>
* Cserkesz: Known as "boy scout sausage" because it's skinny and easy to carry. 
Since cserkesz has been both smoked and dried, it keeps a long time without 
refrigeration. 
</P>
<P>
* Roppanos virsli: The noble ancestor of the hot dog, this fresh veal sausage 
has natural casings. It's better to steam the sausages than boil them. Eat 
virsli with mustard on a roll or use them in soups, potato or bean dishes. 
</P>
<P>
* Csabai: This spicy, very firm smoked sausage is eaten cold or used in 
cooking. 
</P>
<P>
* Paraszt kolbasz: A heavily smoked home-style sausage with lots of garlic and 
paprika. 
</P>
<P>
* Gyulai: Densely packed and mildly seasoned, this lightly smoked pork sausage 
can turn cabbage or potatoes into a savory meal. Gyulai make fine munching 
sausages too. 
</P>
<P>
* Liver sausage and blood sausage varieties: Majashurka, a pale liver sausage 
made with rice, and vereshurka, blood sausage made with barley, are best known 
as part of disznotoros, a sort of Hungarian version of choucroute garnie where 
vegetables and various meats are cooked together and served on a wooden 
platter. Sutnivaldo kolbasz or roasting sausage is another delicious element in 
the disznotoros. 
</P>
<P>
NOODLES 
</P>
<P>
Noodles are as much a staple in Hungary as they are in Italy and Otto's imports 
several kinds. Hungarians not only use them as a side dish or in soups but 
often as dessert, sprinkled with sugar and dusted with ground walnuts or poppy 
seed paste, or baked in a casserole with cream, sugar and lemon zest. Made from 
high gluten Hungarian wheat flour and yellow with egg, these are noodles with 
character. 
</P>
<P>
* Valodi tojasos teszta: Half-an-inch wide and only about an inch long, these 
are rolled thicker than regular fettuccine-sized egg noodles. Such dishes as 
cottage cheese noodles and noodles mixed with sauteed cabbage and onions and 
sour cream are just not the same without them. Valodi tojasos teszta are also 
great in chicken soup. 
</P>
<P>
* Kiskocka: This tiny circular noodle, like a miniature dumpling, is used in 
soups and with gravy dishes. 
</P>
<P>
* Tarhonya: One of Hungary's most famous noodles, these little egg dough 
pellets are made by pushing noodle dough through a coarse sieve. They're 
sometimes called "egg barley," because they resemble the grain. Tarhonya are 
most frequently served with stews but some make a meal of them simply mixed 
with a little meat gravy or sauteed in butter or bacon fat and sprinkled with 
crispy slivers of smoky Hungarian bacon (fustolt szalona). 
</P>
<P>
* Finom metelt: A fine angel-hair egg pasta. 
</P>
<P>
* Metelt teszta: These fettuccine-sized ribbons of egg noodles are best known 
in makos teszta, where they are sprinkled with sugar and ground poppy seeds. 
Another version of the dish is made with ground walnuts and both are 
traditionally eaten on Good Friday or when the meal is light. 
</P>
<P>
BREADS 
</P>
<P>
* Feher kenyer: Baked especially for Otto's, this oblong farmhouse-style white 
bread has a good, dense crumb and excellent mellow flavor. A row of diagonal 
slashes on its top crust give the appearance of barber pole-like stripes. The 
crust crisps nicely when the bread is warmed. 
</P>
<P>
* Paraszt kenyer: A farmhouse rye that's a great sandwich bread; its delicate 
rye flavor allows the taste of cold cuts to come through. 
</P>
<P>
* Bohemian rye: A light sourdough rye. 
</P>
<P>
* Zsur kenyer: Most of Otto's customers order their sandwiches on these long, 
thin French-style rolls. Irma says most Americans like them soft so she keeps 
the rolls wrapped in plastic, but heating will restore their crisp crust. 
</P>
<P>
* Zsemlye: Sold only on the weekends, these are round potato dough rolls, 
somewhat larger than a baseball, with a crisp exterior. 
</P>
<P>
* Fonott kalacs: This eggy twist, similar to a Jewish hallah, comes both with 
and without raisins. 
</P>
<P>
VARIOUS INGREDIENTS 
</P>
<P>
* Lekvar: European cooks prize lekvar, a fruit butter, for a concentrated fruit 
taste that is not too sweet. Central Hungarian apricots and plums are well 
known for their intense flavor, and there's really no substitute for these 
imported preserves. Otto's carries peach, plum and apricot lekvar. Try them in 
the palacsinta or as fillings for cookies, cakes or tortes. 
</P>
<P>
* Preserves: Among Otto's huge stock of imported jams and jellies you'll find 
quince, both red and black currant and rose hip. 
</P>
<P>
* Acacia honey: Good for sore throats, in tea and in cooking, this uniquely 
flavored honey comes from flowers that bloom in Germany and Hungary in May. 
</P>
<P>
* Sweetened chestnut puree: Mention chestnuts and Hungarians' eyes fairly mist 
over with nostalgia as they rhapsodize about their favorite chestnut puree 
dessert. It's made by pushing the puree through a small ricer to lighten it. 
Then each serving is topped with whipped cream. Some cooks like to mix a little 
Cognac into the puree before ricing it. 
</P>
<P>
* Cabbage stuffed peppers: Otto's stocks all sorts of pickled peppers. The waxy 
yellow Hungarian kind that resemble yellow bell peppers come stuffed with 
sauerkraut or red cabbage in either a tart or a mellow brine. Irma, the 
resident pepper expert, will help you pick out the appropriate one for any 
meal. 
</P>
<P>
* Paprika: Of course Otto sells paprika. He imports his favorite kinds in 100 
pound bags and packages them conveniently. The sweet rose paprika contains a 
considerable amount of natural sugar from the pepper, so Hungarian cooks warn 
it should be added when the cooking pan is off the heat; if overheated the 
sugar turns to caramel that spoils its color and flavor. The hot paprika isn't 
quite so delicate but does require a discerning hand. 
</P>
<P>
* Paprika paste: This blend of five kinds of seasoning peppers, comes in a tube 
and may be squeezed into any dish the last few moments of cooking. 
</P>
<P>
* Raspberry syrup: Several brands imported from Poland, Austria and Hungary 
have a concentrated, fruity flavor. Use these in yogurt, in desserts or as a 
drink mixed with sparkling water. 
</P>
<P>
* Polish sauerkraut: Some prefer the more mellow flavor of this imported 
variety. 
</P>
<P>
* Turkish coffee: The conquering Turks first brought coffee to Hungary and 
Hungarians still enjoy the strong brew made by boiling coffee in a long-handled 
Turkish coffee pot. Otto's sells these pots as well as Turkish coffee in vacuum 
packed bags. 
</P>
<P>
* Rum balls: Otto loves to offer his customers rum balls as they browse around 
the store. He keeps the candies in a jar and scoops them out with a little 
shovel. They look like semi-sweet Milk Duds but the center is filled with rum. 
You can find all sorts of beautiful European foil-wrapped candies here too. 
Each is like a little work of art. 
</P>
<P>
COOKING IMPLEMENTS 
</P>
<P>
* Nut grinder: Finicky bakers know the importance of having ground nuts with an 
even texture for their nut tortes, strudels and cookies. Nuts chopped in a food 
processor inevitably come out ground almost to a butter while some remain in 
quite large hunks. This easy-to-use hand grinder, imported from Italy, will 
give you evenly ground nuts. 
</P>
<P>
* Spaetzle maker: It's easy to make your own spaetzle with this handy gizmo 
that looks like a grater. Just plunk the dough into the little frame and run it 
back and forth across the blades. 
</P>
<P>
* Rolling pins: Truly fine noodles must be rolled and stretched at the same 
time to develop a silky texture with tooth. For this you need the long thin 
dowel-like noodle rolling pin. It's different from the wide pastry rolling pin, 
also carried here, which rolls freely from its handles so you can gently roll 
the pastry dough into a shape without pressing out the butter. 
</P>
<P>
* Torte pans: Spring-form cake pans with removable sides come in sizes from 
eight inches to 20 inches in diameter. 
</P>
<P>
* Goose feathers: Hungarian cooks brush egg wash or butter on their pastries 
and breads with a tool made of several goose feathers tied into a "brush." "You 
don't get any shedding bristles and you also get a lighter coat of wash this 
way," says Irma. 
</P>
<P>
* Potato ricers: Experienced cooks know you can't mash potatoes in a food 
processor, whether for dumplings, gnocchi or plain mashed potatoes, because the 
circular motion of the blade makes them gluey. A potato ricer quickly turns 
into a light, heavenly fluff. A miniature potato-type ricer sold here is used 
to make the traditional Hungarian sweetened pureed chestnut dessert. 
</P>
<P>
* Sausage stuffer: This works like a spritz-type cookie gun. Just put the 
sausage meat in the tube and the casing over the long nozzle and push the meat 
into sausages. 
</P>
<P>
HUNGARIAN WINES 
</P>
<P>
* Otto's carries about 20 kinds of Hungarian wine and even a Champagne called 
Torley, a semi-dry variety at $5.99. Among his non-sparkling wines are Tokaji 
Aszu, a sweet honey-like wine (aszu means syrupy) considered to be the 
country's finest. This and the Somloi Furmint wine are made from grapes having 
the botrytis mold that draws off the grape's moisture, leaving an intensely 
sweet juice. Alec Waugh calls botrytis "the fairy godmother of sweet wines and 
the enemy of dry wines." There's also Badacsony Grey Szurkebarat and Badacsony 
Keknyelu, rich heavy Pinot Gris wines from the Badacsony region near lake 
Balaton, and Egri Bikaver or bull's blood, a heavy grapey red. 
</P>
<P>
HUNGARIAN CHEESE 
</P>
<P>
NOODLES 
</P>
<P>
1/4 pound fustolt szalona or regular bacon 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups farmer cheese or low-fat ricotta cheese, at room temperature 
</P>
<P>
About 1 cup sour cream, at room temperature 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1/16 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper 
</P>
<P>
1/2 pound valodi tojasos teszta or broad egg noodles, broken into short lengths 
</P>
<P>
Fry fustolt szalona until crisp. Drain, reserving bacon fat. Crumble bacon and 
set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Crumble cheese with fork or put through sieve. Blend cheese, sour cream (use 1 
cup with farmer's cheese and 3/4 cup if using ricotta), salt, white pepper and 
2 tablespoons reserved bacon fat. 
</P>
<P>
Cook noodles in boiling salted water until al dente, then drain. As noodles are 
cooking, heat 3/4 of cheese mixture in skillet over very low heat (do not allow 
to simmer). 
</P>
<P>
Working quickly, pour noodles into baking dish and stir in 2 tablespoons bacon 
fat. Pour heated cheese mixture over cooked noodles and gently stir just enough 
to blend. Blend in remaining cheese mixture. Serve sprinkled with crumbled 
bacon. Makes 4 main-dish servings or 6 side-dish servings.

BACK TO BASICS: PROCESS FRUIT TO AVOID SPREADING MEDFLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fruit now ripening in Los Angeles area back yards presents a potential hazard. 
According to the media information office of the Cooperative Medfly Project, 
the most frequent way Medfly infestations spread is when contaminated produce 
is shared with friends and relatives outside a quarantined area. 
</P>
<P>
Although a homeowner may not be able to see any evidence, Medfly eggs can still 
be present in fruit. In the early stages, the eggs are frequently visible only 
by a microscope. 
</P>
<P>
"It's imperative that those living in the quarantine zone process back yard 
fruit before it is moved or given away," said project spokesman Larry Cooper. 
To make it safe, fruit must be canned, frozen, dried, baked or made into jam or 
jelly. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers unable to use all their back yard fruit are urged to wrap the excess 
in a sturdy plastic bag, tie it shut and put it out for garbage pick-up. If the 
thought of destroying food concerns you, however, one alternative is to turn 
the fruit into leather. 
</P>
<P>
Almost any type of fruit may be used, including back yard apricots, peaches, 
nectarines, plums and berries. Fruit leathers, also called fruit rolls, make 
excellent snacks. 
</P>
<P>
Select ripe or over ripe fruit. Wash and remove the stones or pits (seeds of 
berries need not be removed). Peel, if desired. 
</P>
<P>
Cut larger fruit into chunks and process enough in a blender to yield 1 1/4 
cups puree (Step 1). Add one tablespoon lemon juice and honey to taste, then 
blend again (Step 2). 
</P>
<P>
Pour the mixture onto a 15x10 1/2-inch jellyroll pan lined with parchment paper 
or plastic wrap (Step 3). Tilt the tray (Step 4) to distribute the mixture in 
an even layer. 
</P>
<P>
Oven Drying 
</P>
<P>
Heat the oven at the lowest setting (140 degrees). Place the tray in the oven, 
leaving the door cracked open. The leather will dry in four to five hours. 
</P>
<P>
Dehydrator Drying 
</P>
<P>
Place the tray in a dehydrator. Set the temperature control to 140 degrees. Dry 
four to five hours. 
</P>
<P>
Sun Drying 
</P>
<P>
Use this method only when the temperature is above 85 degrees and there is less 
than 60% relative humidity. Place the tray in direct sunlight or behind a pane 
of glass or Plexiglas to concentrate the heat. The leather should dry in two to 
three days. Cover or bring the tray indoors at night if the temperature varies 
more than 20 degrees or humidity rises. 
</P>
<P>
When properly dried, leather will be sticky to the touch, but peel easily away 
from the parchment (Step 5). To store the leather, place a sheet of plastic 
wrap over the top and roll up both (Step 6), jellyroll fashion, into a loose 
cylinder. The plastic will prevent the leather from sticking together. 
</P>

CHILL OUT WITH NO-COOK GAZPACHO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Introduce your family to cool, no-cook gazpacho. The recipe originated in 
Spain, where it has been a favored refreshment for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
Originally the soup was thinner and the vegetables were more like a garnish. 
Now we generally stir the vegetables right into the gazpacho for a thicker 
version. 
</P>
<P>
GAZPACHO 
</P>
<P>
3 medium tomatoes 
</P>
<P>
1 small cucumber, chopped 
</P>
<P>
1 medium green pepper, chopped 
</P>
<P>
2 green onions, sliced 
</P>
<P>
1 clove garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
One 12-ounce can (1 1/2 cups) vegetable juice cocktail 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons vinegar 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon olive oil or cooking oil 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon dried basil, crushed 
</P>
<P>
Several dashes bottled hot pepper sauce 
</P>
<P>
Peel tomatoes. Coarsely chop the tomatoes. In a large mixing bowl combine 
tomatoes, cucumber, green pepper and green onions. Stir garlic, vegetable juice 
cocktail, vinegar, olive oil, salt, basil and hot pepper sauce into tomato 
mixture. 
</P>
<P>
Cover and chill in the refrigerator for several hours or until thoroughly 
chilled. Ladle into soup bowls. Makes 4 side-dish servings.

COUNCIL OKS BUDGET CUT BY $1.8 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Facing a state deadline, Glendale City Council members approved the 1990-91 
budget Tuesday after slashing $1.8 million in programs and services, but 
postponed decisions on new taxes and fee increases until next week. 
</P>
<P>
The spending cuts, decided at a morning study session, included a fire station 
crew, seven proposed police employees and a data services team. Council members 
asked the city staff to propose corresponding cuts next Tuesday in the fee 
increases and new taxes expected to pay for the programs. 
</P>
<P>
Because state law requires the city to adopt a budget by July 1, the council 
voted 4 to 1 during its regular afternoon meeting to approve a $265-million 
finance plan that includes the cuts. Council members said they will modify the 
budget when they decide on the taxes and fees. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Ginger Bremberg cast the lone vote against the budget because it 
includes new taxes and fee increases that the council is likely to alter. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot vote for a budget which contains things I will vote against next 
week," she said. "I don't think it's honorable to vote for a budget where you 
know the figures are a lie." 
</P>
<P>
But Mayor Larry Zarian said he was pleased with the council's progress. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing was we sat down today and we took out the things we 
wanted to take out," he said. "I would have voted against it too had the cuts 
not been made." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday vote's was the latest development in an unusually boisterous budget 
review process that has required three council study sessions. Glendale Finance 
Director Brian A. Butler said it was the first time in his 13 years with the 
city that the budget had not been approved unanimously. 
</P>
<P>
Three council members in early June told City Manager David Ramsay that they 
were displeased that his proposed budget called for a 9.3% increase in 
spending, funded by new taxes and fee increases. They demanded that Ramsay 
present a list of possible budget cuts in the proposed $79-million general 
fund, which covers such services as public safety, parks and libraries. 
</P>
<P>
Ramsay's options, totaling $8.4 million, were debated by the council Tuesday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
In its largest single cut, the council eliminated a hook-and-ladder fire truck 
company at Station 29 in Montrose to save $974,185. 
</P>
<P>
Ramsay said the crew is primarily assigned to battle high-rise fires but is 
seldom needed because there are few high-rises in that area. He said the 
station will continue to be staffed by a regular engine company. 
</P>
<P>
The council also deleted a $27,000 fire medical adviser and slashed in half the 
Fire Department's $580,000 overtime fund. 
</P>
<P>
Ramsay had proposed adding 25 new Police Department employees, but the council 
cut a new captain and an executive assistant to save $146,000. By a 3-2 margin, 
the council also decided not to hire five new parking enforcement officers, 
saving $154,000. 
</P>
<P>
The council put the ax to an accelerated tree-planting program that would have 
cost $120,000. The city will follow its normal schedule by planting about 260 
trees next year. The expanded program, calling for 1,265 more trees, was 
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
The council decided to save $199,000 by eliminating one of Glendale's four data 
services teams, saying that the computer services are adequate. 
</P>
<P>
Although the cuts totaled about $1.8 million, Butler said the council had also 
approved a number of spending increases during the budget review, bringing the 
net savings to about $1.65 million. 
</P>
<P>
Council members eliminated more than 15 existing city positions but said no 
workers should be fired or laid off. Instead, the jobs are to be cut by 
attrition, meaning that the post will remain vacant when an employee leaves. 
Because this process could take years, not all of the savings will be realized 
immediately, staff members said. 
</P>
<P>
The spending cuts must be balanced against reductions in revenue. Last week, 
the council eliminated a new city sewer service fee, which would have generated 
$495,000. Butler said elimination of the five parking enforcement officers also 
erased about $300,000 that they were expected to produce in parking fines. 
</P>
<P>
He said that gives the council members a surplus of about $865,000 to consider 
next week when they debate whether to reduce or eliminate some fees and taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Among the proposed fees that have been criticized by some council members are 
7% charges for cable television service and interstate telephone calls. Some 
council members have also opposed a plan to boost the bed tax charged to 
Glendale's hotel guests from 7% to 10%.

4.0 STUDENT BREAKS FREE OF CARMELITOS STEREOTYPES; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: JORDAN HIGH SCHOOL'S VALEDICTORIAN, WHO LIVES IN THE HOUSING 
PROJECT, VIEWS STUDYING AS HER JOB. 
</P>

<P>
Only a few blocks from Viviana Arellano's home in a Long Beach housing project, 
a 10-foot-high wall separates her neighborhood from the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
The concrete wall between the Carmelitos Housing Project and the adjacent 
Lindbergh Middle School was erected last year by officials who wanted to 
protect teachers and students from gunshots. A few years earlier, a student had 
been hit by a stray bullet. 
</P>
<P>
The "Lindbergh Wall" created some hard feelings among the tenants, including 
Arellano, who said the wall only served to stereotype those who live in the 
project. "It's as if they were saying, 'Everybody who lives there has a gun and 
acts crazy,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
But the 18-year-old native of Ecuador, who was smuggled across the border when 
she was 2, is hardly limited by stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
Arellano recently graduated as the valedictorian at Jordan High School. This 
fall, she will enter UC Berkeley, taking with her a slew of scholarships -- and 
dreams of becoming an architect and building a house for her grandmother 
someday. 
</P>
<P>
Arellano's teachers hope she will serve as a role model for other students, 
especially those living in the 713-unit project, which is home to about 2,000 
people. 
</P>
<P>
"When people think of Carmelitos, they always think of the worst situation," 
said Anne Fortson, the student's counselor at Jordan High. "She's an example 
that it's in each of us to do well. If you work hard enough, you can do it." 
</P>
<P>
There are other good students from the project, teachers pointed out. About 200 
Carmelitos students attend Jordan High, and about 35 have the minimum C-plus 
average to qualify for the school's College Admissions Testing Program, said 
Jay Hagey, the program's co-director. The program provides counseling on 
colleges, financial aid and careers for about 400 students, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Hagey acknowledged that Arellano is "a very, very exceptional student." 
Graham Robertson, Arellano's advanced-chemistry teacher, added, "She loves to 
learn." 
</P>
<P>
Arellano, who has a 4.0 grade-point average, said she views studying as her 
job. "This is what I have to do as a student. This is my role. Whenever I take 
a job, I do my best at it." 
</P>
<P>
Her mother, Norma, recalled how Arellano would work on her studies until 2 or 3 
a.m. "I (would) say to her, 'Child, enough!' " 
</P>
<P>
The family living room is adorned with plaques, trophies and ribbons for math 
and science contests, academic excellence and leadership. Viviana and her 
mother recently flew to Tennessee, where Viviana received a $2,000 national 
award earmarked for high-achieving students living in federal housing projects. 
She has won $4,500 in scholarships from various groups, including the North 
Long Beach Women's Club and the Berkeley Alumni Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Norma Arellano, forced to work long hours as a seamstress to support her three 
children after her husband died 11 years ago, runs a no-nonsense household, 
particularly when social activities are involved. 
</P>
<P>
In the tradition of Latin cultures, Viviana's 14-year-old brother, Ricardo, 
serves as her chaperon whenever she goes out. Norma Arellano granted an 
exception recently for the prom, allowing her daughter to go without Ricardo by 
her side. 
</P>
<P>
Norma Arellano said she is proud of all her children. Her oldest son, Fausto 
Francisco, is in the Air Force, married and the father of a little boy. Ricardo 
is in the same College Admissions Testing Program as his sister. 
</P>
<P>
At home, everyone speaks Spanish because Norma does not speak English, although 
she is now taking classes. Viviana is as articulate in Spanish as she is in 
English, gliding smoothly from one to the other -- just as she has successfully 
merged her different cultures. She watches Latin American television soap 
operas but listens to popular radio station Power 106. 
</P>
<P>
Viviana said she is very nervous about leaving home, and especially about 
leaving her mother. "I will try to come back every weekend," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But when it comes to Mom's advice that she take up a short career, live at home 
and get married in a few years, Viviana relates more to her liberated American 
counterparts. She said she wants to postpone marriage for another 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
In her family, women marry young and have children, rather than go on to 
college, she explained. "I'm breaking the mold," she said.

CODE CRACKDOWN; 
</P>
<P>
BELL GARDENS FILES 34 HEALTH, SAFETY COMPLAINTS ON LANDLORDS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This city has filed 34 criminal complaints against owners of deteriorating 
buildings in one of its most sweeping crackdowns on health and safety code 
violations in the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Complaints were issued to the bishop of a local evangelical church, to a La 
Mirada man who converted a dilapidated garage into a bedroom and to a factory 
that makes pillows. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Cary Reisman said that in addition to the charges he has already 
filed at Huntington Park Municipal Court, he plans to file about 30 more 
criminal complaints against property owners who have consistently refused to 
correct health and safety violations. 
</P>
<P>
He plans to prosecute at least 100 cases this year, more than twice the number 
he has prosecuted each year for the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been getting the feeling from the community that people don't think we 
mean business," City Manager Claude Booker said. "We do." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Manager Michael Martinet said that about 24 property owners were 
named in the recent complaints. All of them had failed to correct health and 
safety violations including faulty electrical wiring, excessive trash, and 
illegal garage conversions. At least two-thirds of the property owners are 
absentee landlords, most of whom do not live in the city, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of them think that because this is Bell Gardens that they can get away 
with it," Martinet said. "They get real upset when we file charges. The fact of 
the matter is that they don't think they've done anything wrong. They drive up 
in their gold-toned Mercedes convertibles and say they don't have the money to 
fix the place up. We don't buy it." 
</P>
<P>
The Soldiers of the Cross of Christ Evangelical Church, a worldwide group of 
Christian missionaries with headquarters in Florida, was charged with a total 
of 95 counts of violating several dozen health and safety codes at nine of the 
homes it owns in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The church, located at 6466 Foster Bridge Road, is surrounded by small homes 
that are owned and occupied by about 150 of its missionaries, a church 
spokesman said. Booker said that many of the homes have been divided to allow 
multiple families to share facilities. City officials charged that Bishop 
Rolando Gonzalez and church member Luis Zepeda are responsible for failing to 
fix deteriorating roofs, dangerous wiring and inadequate ventilation, among 
other faults. 
</P>
<P>
Zepeda said that the Soldiers, who wear all-white uniforms and are frequently 
seen in airport lobbies soliciting donations for the needy, have been harassed 
by city officials for most of the eight years that they have held church 
services in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"We are missionaries, we believe in keeping property up to standard," Zepeda 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he has proof that the city has been harassing the church, but declined 
to discuss the case until it goes to court later this month. 
</P>
<P>
City officials, who are accustomed to charges of harassment from recalcitrant 
landlords, said that neighbors have complained about the church, and that 
church officials have had at least two years to correct the problems. 
</P>
<P>
The city also filed two complaints against Emilio and Maribel Leon, a La Mirada 
couple who own apartments in Bell Gardens, Bell and Los Angeles. On recent 
inspections, city inspectors Lourdes Rodriguez and Megan Wineman found that the 
Leons had allowed trash and debris to accumulate in piles around the 
apartments. A child rode his bike in a yard where an old refrigerator had been 
abandoned. Inside a garage, they found stuffing for pillows piled in one 
corner, and two industrial sewing machines, a motorcycle, weightlifting 
equipment, a twin bed and religious candles piled on a makeshift shelf. 
</P>
<P>
"This is very dangerous," Rodriguez said, pointing to the piles of fabric. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez and Wineman blame the Leons. The Leons also rent two homes on the 
property, and the tenants keep their homes tidy, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Emilio Leon said that things are "not that bad." Tenants said he never visits 
the property. 
</P>
<P>
"The junk belongs to my tenants," he said. "I rent the house. Those who rent 
don't take care of it." 
</P>
<P>
He said he first received a notice from the city about the property one week 
ago. However, city records show that the first letter asking the Leons to 
comply went out in March, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Booker said complaints have increased recently because the city's 
dense population has caused a spate of illegal building, homes are aging, and 
the absentee ownership in the city "has gone up at an alarming rate." 
</P>
<P>
He said that the city will prosecute in all cases where the property owner does 
not follow the order of the Rehabilitation Appeals Board, a board of residents 
who offer the property owner one of the last chances to correct a violation. 
</P>
<P>
Booker said building inspectors usually begin a case when a neighbor or tenant 
calls to complain or inspectors see something questionable while on routine 
patrol. If a property owner does not comply with the written requests of 
building inspectors to correct the violations, he is asked to appear before the 
Rehabilitation Appeals Board. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing the property owner's case, the board typically gives the owner a 
certain amount of time to comply with the building code. If the owner still 
does nothing, the city attorney arranges a conference in which property owners 
are told that unless the problems are corrected, they will be prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
The city has never lost a case, and several property owners have been jailed, 
Reisman said. Those who are not jailed face a maximum penalty of $1,000 or six 
months in jail for each count. Most property owners correct the problems after 
the conference rather than risk prosecution, Reisman said. Only about 11% of 
the violators wind up in court, Assistant City Manager Martinet said.

OFFICERS TRAINED IN USE OF SYSTEM TO TRACK STOLEN CARS; 
</P>
<P>
LOJACK: THE GLENDALE DEPARTMENT RECEIVED ONE FREE TRACKING COMPUTER FROM THE 
FIRM AND HAS ASKED THE CITY TO BUY FIVE MORE. 
</P>

<P>
Five Glendale police officers and a sergeant took an imaginary trip to Gotham 
City Tuesday, using a Batmanlike electronic tracking system to hunt down an 
officer playing a villain in a stolen car. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale is one of 47 police departments in Los Angeles County to adopt the 
LoJack system, a product of Massachusetts-based LoJack Corp. Using special 
tracking computers installed in patrol cars, police can follow a signal emitted 
by an electronic device hidden in the stolen car. 
</P>
<P>
Car owners will be able to buy the device from LoJack for $595 when it goes on 
the market in two weeks. It is about the size of a blackboard eraser, small 
enough to be hidden in any of 35 different places in a car. 
</P>
<P>
To ensure that all of Los Angeles County would be part of the LoJack system, 
the corporation donated $1.7 million worth of tracking equipment to police 
departments, said Robert Montoya, the LoJack representative who trained the 
Glendale officers. Two cities in the county, Culver City and Long Beach, have 
decided not to use the system. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale department received one free tracking computer from LoJack and has 
asked the city to buy five more. LoJack, which donated at least one computer to 
each department, sells them for a break-even price of $1,750, Montoya said. 
</P>
<P>
At an indoor briefing before the road training Tuesday, Montoya emphasized to 
Glendale officers that their road skills still would be paramount in recovering 
stolen cars, even with the tracking computer, which is installed in the patrol 
car. The stolen car's signal can bounce off obstructions such as tall buildings 
and hillsides, he said. In the exercise, an officer with a homing device in a 
patrol car hid in a carport. The tracking officers detected the car's signal 
more than a mile away and located the car. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale Officer Herbert Cantwell, one of the officers who tested the system 
Tuesday, said the device will cut down on the time it takes to find a car. 
</P>
<P>
The LoJack "takes a little getting used to, but it actually worked out really 
well," Cantwell said. "It bounces a little bit around the buildings, through 
the downtown area, but once you know what the faults are, it works as a good 
police tracking device." 
</P>
<P>
When a car is stolen in Glendale, the chances of it showing up within a day are 
pretty slim, Cantwell said. If it is found, usually about a week later, often 
it has been stripped of some of its parts, especially the radio and cassette 
player. 
</P>
<P>
Out of 1,672 Glendale cars stolen last year, 1,243, or 74%, were recovered in 
some form, said Glendale police crime analyst Jack Altounian. Only 191 of the 
thefts, or 11%, resulted in arrests, Altounian said. 
</P>
<P>
LoJack Corp. promises that its system will help police find stolen cars within 
24 hours, Montoya said. 
</P>
<P>
"That means it's not being stripped and vandalized," he said. The LoJack system 
also may increase arrests of car thieves, Cantwell said. 
</P>
<P>
LoJack technicians will drive to homes, businesses and 25 Glendale authorized 
car dealerships to install the device for buyers. It is hooked up to the car's 
battery, but remains dormant until activated by signals from law enforcement 
computers if a car is reported stolen. The device can use its own three-day 
power source if the battery connection is cut. 
</P>
<P>
LoJack guarantees that its hidden device will result in a recovered car within 
24 hours, or the customer gets a full refund. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale police officers at the briefing said they were concerned that car 
owners with higher expectations than before of getting their stolen cars back 
will bombard the department with phone calls once the LoJack system is working. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll need a batphone," one of them said.

ROUTINE TRANSFER OF PRINCIPAL DRAWS PROTEST; 
</P>
<P>
SCHOOLS: EAGLE ROCK PARENTS AND TEACHERS WHO DON'T WANT TO SEE THE PRINCIPAL 
BUMPED BECAUSE OF BUDGET CUTS HAVE PERSUADED THE BOARD OF EDUCATION TO 
RECONSIDER THE MATTER.

<P>
To the Los Angeles Unified School District, it was a mechanical process based 
on seniority: Sheila Watson, principal of Eagle Rock Elementary School since 
January, would be reassigned as an assistant principal elsewhere in the 
district. A higher ranking administrator whose job was eliminated due to budget 
cuts would take over Eagle Rock. 
</P>
<P>
That was a process the district is using to deal with massive budget cuts, and 
Watson reluctantly had accepted her fate, calling it a fair and impartial 
system. 
</P>
<P>
But Eagle Rock parents and teachers, who faced the prospect of a third new 
principal in a year, took it personally. They held a rally last week at the 
small school on Fair Park Avenue and protested before the board this week. 
Their message: Leave Sheila Watson alone. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been so many changes at our school during the last year, and there 
will be so many more with teachers retiring, construction going on, a new 
building going up and the school going year-round," said Kristie Denzer, 
president of the school's PTA. "The possibility that we could lose Sheila 
Watson scares us to death." 
</P>
<P>
"Things just don't roll along on their own momentum," added Suzanne Kagan, a 
United Teachers-Los Angeles representative at the school. "Ms. Watson is a 
spearhead for getting things done. She's a real fighter." 
</P>
<P>
The message may have gotten through. Responding to outcry from the school and 
community in her district, Board of Education member Leticia Quezada has asked 
the board to allow Watson to stay at Eagle Rock. District officials said they 
are optimistic about Watson's chances. The board is expected to vote tonight on 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"It just wouldn't be healthy for the faculty or the community" to move Watson 
out and a district administrator in, said Ernie Delgado, a spokesman for 
Quezada. "She seems to have done a lot within a six-month period, and they seem 
to like her style, so why change it?" 
</P>
<P>
Since January, Watson, who took over Eagle Rock after the former principal left 
to head a larger, year-round school, has garnered remarkable support, Kagan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Watson was informed June 15 by the district that because of budget cuts, she 
most likely would lose her position at the end of the month. She was told she 
would be replaced by a district administrator whose position had been cut and 
would be reassigned as an assistant principal elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Three days later, Eagle Rock teachers, parents and students began writing 
letters to the Board of Education in protest. A rally in front of the school 
last week drew more than 75 supporters, who carried placards and clapped and 
cheered for Watson -- who at the time was hundreds of miles away at a funeral 
and unaware of the event. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, five parents attended a Board of Education meeting to express their 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
"Our last principal was very well-liked and talented, but before Sheila Watson 
came in, teacher morale was low, really low and the children, their morale was 
low. Discipline was at its worst," Denzer said Tuesday. "In the six months she 
was there, everything just picked up. She's a very upbeat, go-get-'em woman." 
</P>
<P>
Watson, who was an assistant principal at Hoover Street School downtown before 
becoming principal at Eagle Rock, said she felt awkward about the outcry 
because she knew of other principals whose positions were threatened because of 
budget cuts and did not want to be favored. 
</P>
<P>
"I love this school and I really want to stay," Watson said. "I'm very 
fortunate to have very vocal, very supportive parents and teachers. But many 
other people are facing the same situation. Everyone I know personally has 
worked just as hard as I have." 
</P>
<P>
Watson is the lone administrator at the Eagle Rock campus, which has an 
enrollment of 850 students in a regular elementary program, two gifted magnet 
programs and three special education classes. The magnets have part-time 
coordinators, but Watson oversees the programs, Denzer and others said. 
</P>
<P>
Watson faced some opposition to her proposal to initiate bilingual classes next 
year, Kagan, Denzer and others said. The classes would combine Spanish- and 
English-speaking students and be assisted by aides who would translate the 
teacher's instruction into Spanish, they said. 
</P>
<P>
But she generally has gained widespread approval. Parents and teachers have 
credited her with smoothly stepping in as principal when classrooms are crowded 
and reconstruction is months behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Her supporters said she is known for spending recesses and lunch hours with 
students, particularly those who are disruptive in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Watson also has made a variety of popular proposals, including working more 
closely with Eagle Rock High School, which serves children in grades seven 
through 12, to prepare elementary students for higher grades, said Lucy Cole, a 
parent of an elementary school student. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, Cole said, parents and teachers are counting on Watson to lead 
the school through its next challenges: Construction of a new building will 
begin in January and year-round education will start in 1991. And teachers and 
parents are expected to be given more say in the way the school is run, as a 
result of contract negotiations with teachers last summer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that we're really good friends or that we've known her for years and 
years," said Linda Cassidy, an Eagle Rock teacher for 22 years. "We're just 
impressed with her dealings with parents, her dealings with teachers. She has 
come in with a lot of new ideas and is making change in a gradual way."

AROUND THE FOOTHILLS: 'YOU COULD SEE THE NOTION OF POWER, THE NOTION OF WILL . 
. . BUT NEVER THE NOTION OF LOVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH

<TEXT>
<P>
Levon Jernazian is looking for work. He has been looking since he resettled in 
Glendale in February. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't an easy search because his field is narrow and his standards are high. 
His objective, his resume says, is "a challenging and intellectually 
stimulating position that utilizes my extensive background in social 
psychology, Soviet and Armenian studies." 
</P>
<P>
His most recent piece of work is a 35-page dissertation, "Psychosocial 
Evolution of Soviet Society," which remains unpublished. 
</P>
<P>
Jernazian is making ends meet by working part time as a counselor at the 
Armenian Relief Society on Glenoaks Boulevard in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Dealing with psychosocial issues one-on-one, however, is not what he has spent 
his 31 years preparing for. He holds a doctoral degree in social psychology 
from the Institute of Psychology in Tbilisi, Soviet Georgia. He also studied 
advanced English at Norrington English Center in Oxford, England. 
</P>
<P>
Launching a career in Armenia, Jernazian became an associate professor at the 
State Pedagogical Institute and lecturer at the State University. He was named 
director of the Psychological Center, an experimental public high school that 
became a center of support for the Karabagh Movement through which the Armenian 
majority in an enclave of neighboring Azerbaijan sought to rejoin their 
homeland. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program of restructuring, 
the petition was rejected by Soviet authorities as the movement gave way to 
bloody civil unrest and repression. 
</P>
<P>
Jernazian insists that he followed the movement in the interests of 
scholarship, conducting an informal study of the psychosocial aspects of the 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not anti-Soviet," he said. "I am not a politician. During the movement, I 
have always been a scholar, a scientist." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he wasn't a Soviet booster, either. 
</P>
<P>
He refused to teach the standard course, "Methodology of Sociology," which he 
dismissed as the Marxist-Leninist party line. And he wrote and taught some 
unflattering things about Stalinism, among them his analysis of a once-popular 
form of poetry glorifying the Soviet dictator. 
</P>
<P>
He concluded that the verse in books such as "Stalin in the Creation of Poets" 
represented a form of pagan incantation. 
</P>
<P>
"You could see the notion of power, the notion of will, the notion of 
aggressiveness, but never the notion of love," he said. "We developed some kind 
of pagan religion." 
</P>
<P>
There was no applause from the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jernazian was getting deeper into the Karabagh movement, attending 
rallies, collecting photographs, interviewing participants. 
</P>
<P>
He has gathered material for what he hopes will be a major scholarly work on 
the movement's social implications. But he didn't stay around to do the writing 
in Yerevan. He was beginning to feel the circle of official disapproval 
tightening around him. 
</P>
<P>
He was dropped from a television interview. A friend lost his job. In November, 
Jernazian was squeezed out of his lecturing position. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't allowed to be published," he said, with apparently genuine 
astonishment. His "Psychosocial Evolution of Soviet Society" languished. 
</P>
<P>
Jernazian decided that it was time to join his sister, who had already moved to 
Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
"I was afraid to be arrested," he said. "I was afraid to be in the jail. I was 
afraid that some day in the near future, there could be physical danger. I was 
a humiliated, frustrated young man." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department granted Jernazian refugee status. He now lives with 
his wife, his 6-year-old son, his mother and his father in a two-bedroom 
apartment in south Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
He smuggled out his photos and notes on the Karabagh movement, as well as 
"Stalin in the Creation of Poets." 
</P>
<P>
He's hoping to publish in America now, perhaps even in the popular market. But 
the doors haven't opened yet. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't found the people who would be interested in the work I have done," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
In America, Jernazian's work may have two strikes against it. 
</P>
<P>
His style is scholarly in the extreme, as the opening from a paper called 
"Soviet Media on Karabagh Events in Armenia" suggests: 
</P>
<P>
"To comprehend the real nature of Soviet media presentations of Karabagh 
events, it is first necessary to grasp some of its peculiarities. This is 
especially important given some of the illusions borne out of the universal 
Western euphoria around recent transformations in U.S.S.R." 
</P>
<P>
The second strike derives from Jernazian's viewpoint: "The fact remains that 
the party leadership disguised in parliamentary gowns is still governing all 
key positions of the social system -- mass media, police, KGB, economy, etc." 
</P>
<P>
In America, he can he say that without a worry. But can he sell it in a 
marketplace that is flooded with adulation for Gorby "the reformer?" 
</P>
<P>
If not, Jernazian's job picture is at least improving. His counseling job at 
the Armenian Relief Society is scheduled to become full time next month.

HILLSIDE MORATORIUM OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The moratorium on hillside development was extended for 10 months and 15 days 
in a special City Council meeting last week to allow the Hillside Task Force to 
complete its work on a new ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
The special meeting was called after city officials realized that a 45-day, 
urgency moratorium adopted May 8 was due to expire last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium originally was put in place to allow time for the task force to 
finish work on the new ordinance. The council in January hastily adopted a 
temporary, strict hillside development ordinance after learning that a previous 
two-year moratorium had expired.

HEN'S TEETH DEAL STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city could become a partner in Hen's Teeth Square, a 27,500-square foot 
retail and office center in Northwest Pasadena under a proposal presented 
Tuesday by center developer Jeanette Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
According to a city staff report, the center, at 2057 N. Los Robles Ave., is 
only 60% leased and faces default. 
</P>
<P>
The city in the past has loaned the center $376,000 and has been a tenant 
there, paying $10,920 monthly for 7,280 square feet of office space. Henderson 
wants the city to purchase a 50% share for $440,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena Board of Directors instructed the city manager and the City 
Development Department to analyze the proposal and report back to the board 
promptly, because the center could be declared in default by mid-September.

ACTION ON RESERVOIR STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council will consider legal action to stop the Metropolitan Water 
District of Southern California from reopening Garvey Reservoir until an 
environmental impact report on the structure is completed. 
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old reservoir was shut down in November after leaks from its 
foundation flooded about a dozen homes on Fulton Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The water district has proposed a $20-million to $25-million repair plan that 
includes sealing two cracks, lining the reservoir with concrete and asphalt, 
installing a drainage system, and digging more wells to detect further leaks. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night, Councilman Samuel Kiang asked the city attorney to discuss the 
council's legal options "as soon as possible." Also, Councilwoman Marie T. 
Purvis suggested writing to cities that use MWD water, including El Monte, 
South El Monte and Montebello, to call their attention to Monterey Park's 
concerns.

BIDS FOR CURBSIDE RECYCLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Monday decided to put its curbside recycling contract out 
to bid instead of granting it to current waste hauler Athens Disposal. 
</P>
<P>
Monterey Park's recycling program will be citywide, rather than phased in, and 
will allow single-family residents to combine recyclable aluminum, glass, 
newspapers, cans and bottles in one container for pickup once a week. The City 
Council will also require the hauler to deposit trimmings from city parks and 
medians in compost bins.

GLENDALE MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO VEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Glendale man accused of killing a father and his daughter in a traffic 
collision and fleeing the scene pleaded guilty this week to manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Jorge Fidel Ayala, 21, pleaded guilty Monday in Pasadena Superior Court to two 
counts of vehicular manslaughter and one count of felony hit and run in the 
Jan. 3 accident. 
</P>
<P>
He will be sentenced July 27 and faces up to eight years and two months in 
prison, Deputy Dist. Atty. Tia B. Graves said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Ayala's car ran a red light on Elk Avenue while traveling about 70 
m.p.h. and collided with a car carrying Karapet Khajehtorians, 57, and his 
daughter, Janice, 22. The father died at the scene and the daughter died at a 
Glendale hospital. Police said Ayala fled from his wrecked car. 
</P>
<P>
Ayala's father, Juan Rodolfo Ayala, 54, pleaded guilty in April to being an 
accessory after the fact. The elder Ayala initially told police that his son's 
car had been stolen the night of the accident. He was sentenced to 180 days in 
jail, but received credit for time served and was released on five years 
probation.

$43.9-MILLION BUDGET IS UP 6.3% FROM CURRENT YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday approved a $43.9-million operating budget for the 
coming year, an increase of 6.3% in spending over the current year. 
</P>
<P>
An aquatics program at the new community swimming pool at Downey High School is 
the only major new program in the coming fiscal year, which begins July 1 and 
runs through June 30, 1991, City Manager Gerald M. Caton said. 
</P>
<P>
The pool opened Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the budget largely duplicates the level of services that the city is 
currently providing to residents, he said. Salary increases and the higher cost 
of city employee benefits account for $1.5 million in additional spending, said 
Lee Powell, assistant city manager. 
</P>
<P>
The city's general fund, which pays for most daily operations including Police 
and Fire Department salaries, is balanced. The fund is projected to have a 
$3.6-million reserve at the start and end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the $43.9 million, the budget anticipates spending $12.4 million 
on capital improvements such as a water main and renovation of Furman Park. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council also improved increases in some service fees it charges 
residents, including various planning fees for new construction. It also 
approved a new fee for non-residents who use paramedic service in the city.

RESIDENTS SAY THEIR MANY CRIME TIPS GOT FEW RESULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of the Downey street where a Fullerton police officer was killed last 
week in a sting operation gone awry told the City Council on Tuesday that they 
had complained of illegal activity in their neighborhood for months with few 
results. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the 22-member Neighborhood Watch group on Arrington Avenue asked the 
City Council to have police and other city employees work more closely with 
them to fight crime in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The residents told of various crimes in their neighborhood, including a 
stabbing last September. 
</P>
<P>
They also complained that they were endangered by the sting operation that 
ended in a gunfight. The operation involved officers from Fullerton, Anaheim 
and several other Orange County police departments who were investigating a 
cocaine ring that had been operating in their county. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief D. Clayton Mayes said he would meet with the residents.

DIAL-A-RIDE SUSPENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council voted to temporarily suspend its Dial-A-Ride service to 
elderly and disabled residents after concerns were raised about whether the 
program was properly insured. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said a Jan. 7 accident involving an off-duty Dial-A-Ride vehicle 
revealed that Dial-A-Ride contract holder Mid-Valley Transit Inc. was not 
insured for the livery services Dial-A-Ride provides. 
</P>
<P>
Although Mid-Valley Transit owner Wagih Meleka told the council that he bought 
the proper insurance coverage beginning June 4, the council voted unanimously 
to stop providing Dial-A-Ride services until confirmation of insurance is 
obtained. 
</P>
<P>
The council also voted to transfer the Dial-A-Ride contract to ATE/RYDER, the 
company that runs the city's old-fashioned trolley system, on July 1, when 
Mid-Valley Transit's $223,000 contract expires. Transportation services manager 
Gary Byerly said details of the new contract have not been worked out.

GLENDALE SCHOOLS ADOPT BUDGET OF $103.5 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale Board of Education on Tuesday approved a $103.5-million budget for 
the coming school year that neither cuts nor adds programs. 
</P>
<P>
Board members were warned by district administrators that large reductions may 
be necessary the following year if a threatened source of state money dries up. 
</P>
<P>
The budget is 10% higher than the $94 million for 1989-90 and assumes that the 
state will provide a 3% cost-of-living increase. 
</P>
<P>
The budget includes 7.2% raises for teachers during the last year of a 
three-year contract. It allows the district to maintain a 3% reserve as 
mandated by state law. 
</P>
<P>
District officials said they learned Tuesday that Gov. George Deukmejian has 
proposed giving schools no cost-of-living increase in the coming fiscal year. 
That wouldn't affect the 1990-91 budget. But it would force the district to 
spend its reserves and make cuts of about $4 million in 1991-92, said David 
Kanthak, assistant superintendent of business services. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to say what's going to happen next year because we're not sure 
what's going to happen the next day," Kanthak said. "But we would do what we 
can to keep any cuts as far away from the classroom as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Kanthak said the district should know by July 10 how much money it will receive 
from the state. 
</P>
<P>
The budget includes a $600,000 trim from administrative accounts, such as 
supplies, Kanthak said. Although it does not call for fewer teachers or reduced 
school programs, it will not pay for some needed repairs or additional school 
security guards, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The budget includes $1.8 million to install air conditioning at five elementary 
schools that are to go on year-round schedules in 1991.

DEPUTIES BUCKLE DOWN ON BELT USE

Sheriff's deputies stopped about 1,400 motorists at a checkpoint Saturday, but 
they wrote no tickets, issued no citations and made no arrests. Officers just 
wanted to remind people to buckle up. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really a lot of fun," said Sgt. Bob Wilson of the Sheriff's Department. 
"We thought for sure somebody would complain . . . you know, like, 'Why are you 
stopping me?' . . . But we got nothing but positive comments." 
</P>
<P>
Deputies, who said the seat-belt operation was the first of its kind in 
California, modeled the operation after the controversial sobriety checkpoints 
recently upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
But to avoid potential legal challenges, officers decided to focus on 
education, not enforcement. Those who were unbuckled were given a gentle 
admonition and handed a packet of brochures on highway safety. 
</P>
<P>
Those with fastened seat belts were commended and invited to pick up a free 
gift at a traffic safety fair that officers had set up at nearby Puente Hills 
Mall. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Los Angeles chapter of the National Safety Council estimates that 
about half of all motorists wear seat belts, deputies said they recorded about 
a 70% compliance rate. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, that might have had something to do with the large sign about 1,000 
yards down Castleton Street, advising drivers that they were about to come to a 
seat-belt checkpoint. There was even time to make a turn and seek an alternate 
route. 
</P>
<P>
But for every motorist on the lam, officers said, there was somebody so 
thrilled with the idea that they decided to pass through again. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people got there and went home to bring their kids back down," Wilson 
said. "One guy with three children drove through the checkpoint, then drove 
through again and was going to go through a third time." 
</P>
<P>
Eleven deputies from the Industry substation organized the checkpoint and 
safety fair, with the help of two California Highway Patrol officers and about 
two dozen Explorer Scouts, reserve officers and civilian volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
The four-hour event was paid for by corporate sponsors and donations from 
Industry business people.

CLAIM REJECTED IN BOY'S DROWNING

<P>
The Board of Education this week rejected a claim accusing the Long Beach 
Unified School District of negligence in the drowning of a 14-year-old boy in 
the Jordan High School swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for the boy's family said he expects to file a lawsuit against the 
Long Beach Unified School District within the next few weeks, claiming that 
Ryan Hardison died as a result of district negligence. 
</P>
<P>
Hardison sank to the bottom of the Jordan High pool on May 23 during an ROTC 
class. His instructor and classmates were in the pool with him. There were two 
other adults in the area, including a lifeguard who attempted to resuscitate 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Paul F. Glass filed the claim against the district June 13, asking for 
ambulance, medical, funeral and burial expenses in addition to other 
unspecified damages. A claim is routinely filed prior to a lawsuit, and the 
school board typically rejects all such claims. 
</P>
<P>
"When all is said and done, if you have three adults with a group of kids . . . 
a child shouldn't drown. It's as simple as that," Glass said. "It shouldn't 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan High Principal Alta Cooke has called the drowning "a freak accident," 
saying there was no negligence by the instructors or the lifeguard. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. E. Tom Giugni has appointed a four-member panel to review the incident. 
The panel was told to gather facts, rather than reach any conclusions about 
whether there was negligence on the part of school personnel, said Ron Bennett, 
who chairs the group. But if the panel members find areas where improvements 
are needed, they will make recommendations to the school board, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The district also has hired a claims service to interview witnesses, said 
Bennett, the district's deputy superintendent for business services. The 
witnesses' statements and other information gathered by the panel will be 
turned over to an attorney the district hired for this case, Bennett said.

The boys' basketball teams at La Canada and Crescenta Valley highs have 
advanced to the round of 16 in the 128-team L. A. Games tournament. 
</P>
<P>
La Canada will play Morningside at L. A. Jordan High and Crescenta Valley will 
play Manual Arts at El Camino College on Saturday. Both games begin at noon. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, La Canada defeated Dorsey, 50-43, Bell Gardens, 55-47, and Taft, 
73-66. 
</P>
<P>
Crescenta Valley beat San Fernando, 60-38, Walnut, 51-39, and Canyon, 47-46. 
</P>
<P>
The La Canada girls edged Costa Mesa, 28-25, in the first round before falling 
to Torrance, 31-27. 
</P>
<P>
In water polo, Glendale advanced to the final 16 before losing to San Gorgonio, 
11-5. 
</P>
<P>
New coach: Kathy Pudelko has been named the women's basketball coach at 
Glendale College. 
</P>
<P>
Pudelko, who spent the last two seasons as a graduate assistant at Cal State 
Northridge, succeeds interim Coach Lee Balkin. 
</P>
<P>
Pudelko coached at Agoura from 1985-87 and coached Snake River High in Baggs, 
Wyo., to the state 1-A Division basketball championship in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
She is completing a Master's degree in physical education at CSUN. She 
graduated in 1978 from Northern Colorado, where she played volleyball.

Correction: It was incorrectly reported in this space last week that Bruce 
Man-Son-Hing of Glendale defeated Don Issak of Los Angeles, 6-3, 6-0, in the 
semifinals of the Southern California Public Parks tennis tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Man-Son-Hing beat Issak in the final to win the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Man-Son-Hing, 26, graduated from Glendale High and played tennis at UC Irvine 
before playing on the professional tour for three years.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Flag Amendment 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 254 to 177, the House failed to achieve the two-thirds majority it 
needed to approve a constitutional amendment against desecration of the 
American flag. Although this shelved the proposed change in the Bill of Rights, 
the Senate was to take up the measure (HJR 350) to get its members on record on 
the explosive issue. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-word constitutional amendment sought to clear the way for state and 
federal laws protecting the flag from physical abuse. Such measures now violate 
the Constitution's free-speech guarantees, the Supreme Court has held. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.) said: "Let us take the flag out of the gutter 
where the counterculture has dragged it and is sneering at us. This is an 
opportunity not to get even with some creeps but to say there are transcendent 
values that are important to every American that unify us, that bring us 
together as a community, one nation under God, indivisible." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Wayne Owens (D-Utah) said: "How foolish we look to allow a few fools 
who have burned a few flags in well-publicized events to drive us into this 
feeding frenzy, where we . . . attempt the desecration of the Bill of Rights by 
an unjustifiable and unneeded constitutional amendment." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was for changing the Constitution to protect the flag.

Flag Statute 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 179 to 236, the House defeated a bill to protect the American flag 
by statute rather than the rejected route (above) of amending the Constitution. 
The bill (HR 5091) made it a federal crime to damage a flag owned by the 
government or situated on U. S. property, or in a way that provokes violence. 
The wording was designed to get around Supreme Court objections to previous 
flag protection laws. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.) said: "Our purpose is not to punish speech but to 
punish vandalism against the flag." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.) called the measure "a fig leaf for 
those who are attempting to get political cover" after having voted minutes 
earlier against a constitutional amendment. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was for the statute.

Hatch Act Veto 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 327 to 93, the House overrode President Bush's veto of a bill (HR 
20) permitting civil servants and postal workers limited involvement in 
partisan politics under the 51-year-old Hatch Act. But the bill died when the 
Senate later upheld the veto. 
</P>
<P>
The bill gave an estimated 3 million federal employees the opportunity to take 
part in political campaigns and causes off the job, but stopped short of 
allowing them to seek public office. 
</P>
<P>
Override supporter Gerry Sikorski (D-Minn.) said a President concerned about 
politicized workers should "quit appointing those ambassadors who simply gave 
$100,000 to the Republican National Committee." 
</P>
<P>
Veto supporter Frank R. Wolf (R-Va.) said: "The fact that the size of the 
federal work force has tripled since 1939 makes the Hatch Act even more needed 
today." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to pass the bill.

DUARTE MAKING 'LEMONADE' OUT OF AUTOPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The saying goes "if it rains lemons, make lemonade." The city of Duarte and the 
Duarte Redevelopment Agency are definitely making lemonade. Unfortunately, the 
Los Angeles Times focused on the "lemons." 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, June 17, the San Gabriel Valley section ran an article titled 
"Duarte Ends Up With Lemon in Autoplex." The article highlighted the negative 
aspects of the Duarte Autoplex/Educational Park Project, without giving fair 
coverage to the positive prospects. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of the closure of Duarte Nissan, Suzuki and Isuzu, The Times failed to 
indicate the setback is only temporary and that five serious, qualified dealers 
are bidding on this, the premier auto sales site along the 210 Freeway. We are 
confident a new dealer will make the site profitable soon. In fact, Toyota of 
Duarte and Duarte Mitsubishi are exceeding expectations in their nearby 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
With respect to the indefinite postponement of the Subaru and Volkswagen 
dealerships, the development agreements very specifically protect Duarte to 
ensure the development of auto dealerships on that site. A number of 
dealerships have expressed strong interest, indicating that the Duarte Autoplex 
continues to be an attractive location for the auto industry. 
</P>
<P>
The Times article also pointed to the fact that Ford, Acura and Infiniti 
dealerships canceled plans to build at the old Northview Middle School. 
Although this is true, better opportunities and alternatives have come along. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are under way for a regional commercial development which will 
include a dinner-style restaurant and preservation of the historic School 
District Administration building. This retail/commercial approach makes more 
sense because the city will be able to recoup its investment twice as fast, our 
revenue base will be diversified and convenient shopping opportunities will be 
provided. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than magnify the "lemons," The Times article should have focused on the 
sweetest ingredient in the lemonade: the Duarte Autoplex/Duarte Educational 
Park Project. 
</P>
<P>
In the last three years, the city of Duarte has worked diligently with the 
Duarte Unified School District to complete an ambitious, innovative 
$15.5-million Duarte Educational Park Project, composed of a new School 
Administration Center, a new maintenance facility, a new warehouse facility, a 
state-of-the-art Intermediate School and nearly completed 500-seat Civic 
Auditorium. This project has been made possible by the success of the Duarte 
Autoplex. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of comparing Duarte to Monrovia, The Times should fairly view the 
current situation. We are happy for Monrovia's success but we are also very 
happy with our own prospects.

DESPITE SOME FOUL PLAYS, THE GANG FROM THE COMIC STRIP STILL KNOW HOW TO PLEASE 
A CROWD.

<P>
"You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown" was one of off-Broadway's biggest successes, 
with a first run of nearly 1,600 performances when it opened 23 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The 1967 show by Clark Gesner, based on the comic strip "Peanuts," is a 
favorite of community and high school theatrical groups. It has been mounted by 
the Conejo Players for a series of Sunday matinees that concludes on July 15. 
On July 28 the production will move to Moorpark High School for one afternoon 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
The Conejo production makes the most of a show whose popularity far exceeds its 
worthiness for inclusion among great theatrical literature. A comic strip that 
is based on the notion of children thinking and speaking like adults has been 
watered down for the stage: This is two hours of adults portraying children who 
speak like adults. 
</P>
<P>
Like the comic strip and "Peanuts" television specials, the chronicling of a 
day in the life of the moon-faced Charlie Brown and his playmates is little 
more than a series of blackouts. The play adds several songs, none of which 
lingers in the memory more than a moment after the last notes have faded from 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
We find crabby and bossy Lucy; her security blanket-bound but philosophical 
little brother, Linus; aspiring classical pianist Schroeder; fantasizing beagle 
Snoopy and perennial schnook Brown going through the familiar motions: a 
softball game, Snoopy's imaginary dogfights with the Red Baron, Brown's panting 
after the (unseen) cute little red-headed girl and so on. Missing are such 
Peanuts regulars as Pigpen, Sally, Woodstock the bird and Snoopy's brother 
Spike. 
</P>
<P>
The Conejo Players Theatre audience on Sunday consisted for the most part of 
the very young and quite old. It was the older members of the audience, 
doubtless, who most appreciated the humor and sometimes-arcane references. 
Youngsters would probably appreciate a brat like Bart Simpson to upset all this 
niceness. 
</P>
<P>
Since the play is from the mid-'60s, a few topical references are a bit dated. 
One joke treats the idea of ZIP codes as a new thing. Later the long-outdated 
notion of postal zones is mentioned. The fact that those references remain 
fails to explain the reference to Barry Manilow, who didn't have a hit record 
until 1974. 
</P>
<P>
All that quibbling aside, praise should be extended to the cast, backing 
musicians, director Bill Polari and the production crew. 
</P>
<P>
The show skips along merrily, and several of the characterizations are quite 
remarkable. Jim Holmes contorts his face until he bears an uncanny resemblance 
to Charlie Brown. Although the cartoon Lucy is a brunette, you soon forget that 
the actress playing her so convincingly crabbily, Kimberly Germain, is a 
blonde. And Mark Andrew Reyes comes close to stealing the show in his portrayal 
of a beagle without the benefit of a dog costume or makeup. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Baker, Stuart Berg and Aileen-Marie Scott are also appealing in their 
portrayals of Linus, Schroeder and Peppermint Patty, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The music isn't much, but the cast perform the songs with enthusiasm, backed by 
pianist Zachary Spencer, bassist Steve Bringleson, percussionist Ken Dayton and 
woodwind player Rhondda Dayton. 
</P>
<P>
And in the one exception to the score's drabness, Reyes' Snoopy turns supper 
time into a production number -- literally -- choreographed by Gabriel 
Arciniega. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, it's a show that children can take their parents to without fear of 
embarrassment, and the air-conditioned Conejo Players Theatre is a pleasant 
place to spend Sunday afternoon. Adults are directed to the Conejo troupe's 
concurrent production of "Children of a Lesser God," playing Thursday through 
Saturday evenings. 
</P>
<P>
* WHERE AND WHEN: "You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown" plays at 2:30 p.m. on July 
1, 8 and 15 at the Conejo Players Theatre, 351 South Moorpark Road in Thousand 
Oaks. Tickets are $15 at the door, with no reservations taken. For further 
information, call 495-3715.

COMPTON EXTENDS LOAN DEADLINE FOR HOTEL DEVELOPERS; 
</P>
<P>
CONSTRUCTION: THE COUNCIL REJECTS AN EFFORT TO HAVE THE BUSINESSMEN DECLARED IN 
DEFAULT FOR MISSING REPAYMENT DATE.

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday night extended the deadline another year for $6.8 
million in construction loans that the developers of the Compton Lazben Hotel 
owe the city. 
</P>
<P>
The council majority rejected an effort by two council members to have the 
developers declared in default on the loans for missing a May 31 deadline. 
Council members Patricia A. Moore and Maxcy D. Filer urged that the city take 
possession of the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Mayor Walter Tucker and council members Bernice Woods and Jane Robbins 
adopted a resolution extending the deadline to May 31, 1991, for the 
developers, Naftali Deutsch and his four sons. 
</P>
<P>
"The hotel," Woods said, "is one of the best things that has happened to this 
city in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
The hotel and convention center, located alongside the 91 Freeway, were 
considered key factors in plans for Compton's economic revitalization. But the 
project has been plagued by construction delays, during which the city and 
developers argued over money and construction specifications. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel opened last fall but has failed to generate much business, and some 
of the floors remain unfinished, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
As they have done in the past, Moore and Filer called on the council to 
foreclose on the project rather than make any more accommodations to the 
developers. In the past, the city has come up with additional funds and agreed 
to other loan and construction extensions when the developers insisted that 
they did not have enough money to finish the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Moore accused the developers of ignoring the construction and loan contracts, 
pointing out they have not made interest payments on the loans in a year. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had a car that was that far behind, the bank would take it," Moore said. 
"If I had a house that was that far behind, the bank would take it. Yet, we 
want to stay in a relationship with this developer." 
</P>
<P>
Filer said: "I don't think this developer has kept one promise with regard to 
the hotel and the (development agreement)." 
</P>
<P>
Filer also said he was concerned that the city's ability to take possession of 
the hotel could be hampered by Naftali Deutsch's declaration of personal 
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Deutsch recently acknowledged that his father is involved in 
bankruptcy proceedings. However, the younger Deutsch, who acts as the family 
spokesman, said his father is merely a consultant who has no control or 
financial interest in any of several family firms that have been involved in 
the development, construction and management of the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Naftali Deutsch, who signed many of the original development agreements with 
the city, attended the council meeting with Benjamin Deutsch. They declined to 
comment after the vote. 
</P>
<P>
While voting to extend the deadline, the council majority also added a 
provision that allows the city to demand immediate repayment of the loans and 
more than $400,000 in interest in the next 30 days. A majority of the five 
council members would have to approve such a move, however. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Howard Caldwell said after the meeting that over the next 30 days 
the city and the developers will be negotiating such issues as unpaid interest 
and completion of hotel construction. In addition to the unfinished floors, a 
tennis court also remains to be built, for example.

THE GRADUATION CEREMONY PROVES A HIT FOR WELFARE PARENTS ENROLLED IN A HIGH 
SCHOOL EQUIVALENCY CERTIFICATE PROGRAM.

"Happy graduation," said the black and gold letters strung along the wall. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never done this before," said Ruth Irussi, glancing across Room 11 of 
Oxnard Adult School's East 3rd Street campus. "We didn't know if people would 
be interested in coming back." 
</P>
<P>
But as she spoke on this Tuesday afternoon, the room filled with two dozen 
mothers, fathers and children. They included 16 of the 80 welfare parents who 
passed through the Oxnard GAIN program in the past year on the way to earning 
their state high school equivalency certificates. 
</P>
<P>
Cookies and punch were laid out along one wall, and a box of congratulatory 
certificates occupied a corner, next to the supply of complimentary GAIN coffee 
mugs. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, these will sit on your desk at work," said GAIN supervisor Judi 
Saso-Pense, kicking off the reception. 
</P>
<P>
Then the parents and children applauded GAIN teachers Carolyn Noseff and Pat 
Marowsky and took turns receiving their certificates and mugs. Some had already 
gotten off welfare, and others still had this as their goal. These were some of 
their plans: 
</P>
<P>
* "I'm going to be attending college real soon, taking nursing classes," 
Margaret Hernandez said. "I have a job all lined up, and hopefully I'll stay 
there 'til I retire." 
</P>
<P>
* "Well, I had a job offer, but the building burned down," Angelica Robledo 
said. "But I am going to attend summer school at Ventura College." 
</P>
<P>
* "Today, I went to apply for police officer training," Maria Minster said. "I 
want to do law enforcement work." 
</P>
<P>
* "Right now, I'm going to Oxnard College -- I'm trying to get them to pay for 
a year," Rita Hernandez said. "I'm going to be a volunteer for children who are 
abused and neglected . . . and I'm going into clerical work." 
</P>
<P>
* "Now I sell Avon," Luz Rivera said. "And I'm going to attend college. My goal 
is to work with computers. And I'd like to say thank you to my teachers for all 
the help." CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS

FLYING DISC CHAMPIONSHIPS TO END SUNDAY IN LA MIRADA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LA MIRADA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Self-caught flight and double disc court competition are the two main events 
scheduled today in the fifth day of the 17th annual U.S. Open Flying Disc 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 20,000 spectators are expected to attend the weeklong competition 
that began June 24 and will end Sunday. All of the events are free, and most 
are at La Mirada Regional Park, 15501 Alicante Road. 
</P>
<P>
The outdoor championships will include disc golf, disc-a-thon, freestyle, 
distance competition, double disc court, self-caught flight, accuracy and 
throw-run-catch competitions, Frisbee-catching dogs and Ultimate and Guts game 
demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
In the self-caught flight event, a player has to catch his own disc with one 
hand. Scoring is based on how long the disc is airborne. The double disc court 
event involves two teams of two players each with two discs in play. The goal 
is to get both discs in the opponents' court at the same time. It is played on 
grass courts 13 meters square and 17 meters apart. 
</P>
<P>
Each day's activities start at 8 a.m., but today's two events have gotten so 
big that they cannot be contained in La Mirada Regional Park, sponsors said. 
They are being held at Imperial Field, Imperial Highway and Idaho Street, La 
Habra. 
</P>
<P>
Two popular spectator events on the final day Sunday will be the Big Throw and 
Frisbee-catching dogs. In the Big Throw at 12:30 p.m., all spectators in a 
large grassy area will be asked to throw their own discs simultaneously in an 
attempt to break the Guinness world record of 1,903 discs in the air at one 
time. 
</P>
<P>
The finals of the Frisbee-catching dog event, beginning at 1 p.m. Sunday, will 
involve the top four or five teams, based on eliminations earlier in the week. 
Most competitors do a four- or five-minute routine to music. 
</P>
<P>
Event sponsors encourage spectators to bring video cameras in the hope that 
some of the unusual competitions will be recorded for submission to "America's 
Funniest Home Videos" television show. All entries will be reviewed and 
eligible for a $10,000 grand prize.

DEPUTIES ISSUE CAR DECALS IN ATTEMPT TO CONTROL CRUISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PICO RIVERA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the latest effort to control local cruising, Pico Rivera has started issuing 
stick-on automobile decals to residents and workers who must drive through the 
Whittier Boulevard area when cruising restrictions are in force. As of last 
Friday, eight days into the program, the city had issued nearly 1,000 decals. 
</P>
<P>
The fluorescent decals are to help sheriff's deputies recognize motorists who 
need to get through traffic-control barriers. During periods of heavy cruising, 
deputies will often set up barriers blocking residential streets or limit main 
thoroughfares to one-way traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Cruising typically peaks on Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays, said Mayor 
Alberto Natividad. He added that the city spent about $300,000 last year on the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent week, the Sheriff's Department reported as many as 10,000 
cruisers, City Manager Dennis Courtemarche said. 
</P>
<P>
The free decals can be obtained from the public works counter at City Hall 
during business hours. Lost decals will cost $10 to replace.

COUNCIL OKS PLANS FOR NEW FIRE STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MONTEBELLO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday approved plans for a new fire station and police 
community service center on the south side of town. 
</P>
<P>
The city has been planning for four years to replace the old station, which was 
built almost 50 years ago on the corner of Date Street and Greenwood Avenue, 
but has not had the money, Fire Chief Robert Fager said. 
</P>
<P>
The old station was small and run-down, and fire personnel had been living in a 
trailer in the back yard for about three years. 
</P>
<P>
Fager said the new station would house one engine company and two paramedics, 
along with a fire prevention bureau and emergency preparedness team. A 
community service department of the Montebello Police Department will also 
share the $1.4-million building. 
</P>
<P>
Construction is expected to be completed late next fall. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a long time coming, and I know the firefighters are anxious to move 
into a new station house," Fager said.

IT'S A TEST OF THE TASTE BUDS AS COOKS FROM SEVEN NATIONS VIE FOR THE CONTEST

<P>
To some, chili is a bowl of beans and spices. To others it's a way of life. 
While the heat-and-eat, canned-chili crowd scans supermarket shelves in search 
of something to pour over hot dogs, committed chili cooks from seven nations 
hover over the latest in an endless series of practice batches. They taste, 
compare and confer. "Too much coriander," one murmurs. 
</P>
<P>
A perfect pot of chili is something to be savored. It is also something that 
can win a chef the title of World Champion and a tasty prize of $25,000. Small 
wonder that those bitten by the chili cook-off bug plan their schedules around 
the numerous competitions that have sprung up around the country since the 
first international cook-off was held in Texas in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore's "Sespe Creek" Cook-off on July 4 is a step along the way to the top. 
Sanctioned by the International Chili Society, the event annually attracts at 
least 30 chefs and chili connoisseurs from across the county. The $500 prize is 
modest, but the winner also qualifies for a regional cook-off. Regional winners 
are eligible for October's World Championship in Rosamond, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
World champions don't fade away; they start their own cook-offs. Fillmore 
residents Jim Beaty and Kenton Stafford were champions in '86 and '88 
respectively. They founded the Sespe Creek cook-off four years ago to add 
flavor to the town's Independence Day celebrations. Both look forward to having 
friends from the cook-off circuit come to the town where they grew up. "It's 
like a family," Beaty said of the chili-chef network. 
</P>
<P>
Beaty and Stafford serve as co-chairmen of the event and will head a judging 
team of five to 15 experts, in accordance with International Chili Society 
rules. They usually round out the team with a few volunteers from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
What makes a good pot of chili? "No beans," said Beaty. "Just beef." Beer may 
make it bitter, and according to Beaty, the wrong onions will have the same 
effect. Meat must be neither tough or mushy. 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm judging, I look for something that gets my attention," Beaty said. "A 
little bite at the front of your mouth. The spices should open up as you start 
to chew. It should have a good back heat as it goes down your throat. Then, it 
kind of explodes in your mouth." In other words, fireworks for the taste buds. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the cooks who visit Fillmore are already experts, but a few novices are 
expected to battle it out with veterans of the seasoning wars. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to my first cook-off on a dare," said the 46-year-old Beaty, who has 
been cooking chili since 1982. "I didn't know anything -- I came in something 
like 35th out of 25." 
</P>
<P>
Stafford, 41, started in 1986 as Beaty's assistant and had to be talked into 
entering a competition on his own. Evidently, his first experience was not too 
painful. "I took third," he said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
Both Fillmore cooks practice cooking up to four times a week and travel to 
cook-offs at least twice a month. Neighbors for 14 years, their friendly 
rivalry doesn't stop them from occasionally critiquing each other's chili. 
</P>
<P>
Entrants to Fillmore's cook-off must provide two gallons of "People's Choice" 
chili, which the public tastes while competition pots simmer on propane stoves 
beneath colorful canopies that are provided by the cooks. Contestants start 
arriving at 6:30 a.m. By 11 a.m., booths are open, and live music adds a 
festive note. 
</P>
<P>
What explains the cooks' dedication, and the public's fascination for chili 
cook-offs? "It's a happening," Jim West, executive director of the 
International Chili Society, said from his Newport Beach office. "There's a 
mystique to it -- like wine tasting. Chili is a creative food. People wouldn't 
turn out like this to cook meat loaf or tuna casserole." 
</P>
<P>
Originally developed on cattle drives in the old West as a way of rendering 
tough meat edible, chili is truly an American food. Nonetheless, in addition to 
events across the United States, the society sanctions cook-offs in France, 
England, New Zealand and Australia, as well as Canada and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
All cook-offs approved by the society must donate proceeds to charity. "Since 
the ICS moved to California from Texas in 1975, it has raised $25 million for 
charity," West said. 
</P>
<P>
While observers need only an appetite for food and fun, there are a few basics 
that an aspiring chili chef needs to take to the cook-off: a propane stove and 
a sun shade, a stainless-steel pot and a spice bag containing carefully 
selected individual herbs and spices. 
</P>
<P>
The Sespe Creek Cook-Off might be a good place to start. 
</P>
<P>
Stafford's first foray into formal competition was in his hometown in 1987. One 
year later, he won the world championship.

BOXER MOSLEY HAS SUCCESS ON A STRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since he first stepped into a boxing ring at 9, success has been in Shane 
Mosley's corner. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old from Pomona has won with ease at every level. 
</P>
<P>
Competing in the 132-pound lightweight division, Mosley's recent string of 
successes has included back-to-back titles in the U.S. championships the past 
two years and second place in the Junior World championships in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Last week he captured the 132-pound title at the first U.S. Olympic Cup, an 
international boxing event in Salt Lake City, with a majority decision over 
Leonid Bronnikov of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
But Mosley's best days as a boxer appear to be in his future. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he has all the potential in the world and the desire to go with it," 
said Pat Nappi, longtime coach of the U.S. national team. "With (more) 
international experience, he'll get even better." 
</P>
<P>
Mosley will receive the most difficult international test of his career when he 
represents the U.S. at the Goodwill Games July 20-Aug. 5 in Seattle. He 
qualified with a 4-1 decision over Lamar Murphy in the Goodwill Games boxing 
challenge June 9 in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
It is a challenge that his trainer and father, Jack Mosley, said he is prepared 
to meet. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's definitely one of the favorites at the Goodwill Games," Jack 
Mosley said. "There's always room for improvement and the competition will be 
good. But he has to be right at the top of his division." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Zanders, who coaches the U.S. national team, said: "Right now he's probably 
above and beyond anyone in the world at his weight class. Some people would say 
that's pumping him too much but I think he is." 
</P>
<P>
Zanders said Mosley's work ethic stood out during the recent Goodwill Games 
training camp at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
"Shane practiced more than anyone else at the Goodwill training camp," Zanders 
said. "That shows me that he is willing to go above and beyond what we ask him 
to do to prepare. He is willing to go that extra mile as we like to call it." 
</P>
<P>
Besides his strong work ethic, there are the natural skills that have enabled 
Mosley to earn the top ranking in the U.S. in the 132-pound class. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel his hand speed and his reflexes are some of the fastest around," Nappi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"He leads effectively and he counters effectively," Zanders said. "One of his 
best skills is his ability to defend. As a boxer he's constantly adjusting to 
his opponent." 
</P>
<P>
Mosley said the frequent adjusting is part of his overall strategy as a boxer. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really go in with a strategy because you never really know what the 
other guy is going to do," he said. "You have to come in ready to fight 
different strategies. I always come in with different strategies in case one 
doesn't work. I like to be flexible, not to just have a one-track mind. A good 
fighter adjusts real well." 
</P>
<P>
Mosley realizes there are still areas in which he needs to improve. 
</P>
<P>
"I know there's still some things I need to sharpen up," he said. "I don't want 
to get tangled up with my opponents and I have to work on finding a little more 
punching power. The speed and the power is there. You just have to twist your 
body and snap it at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
But Jack Mosley said his son is always willing to learn. 
</P>
<P>
"He's still got a lot of things to work on," he said. "He's learning all the 
time and there's always room for improvement. Styles change and he has to learn 
them as he goes along. But my philosophy is to keep an open mind and keep 
working hard and that way you'll always stay ahead of the game." 
</P>
<P>
For the moment, Mosley has set his sights on a gold medal in the Goodwill Games 
-- a goal that appeared more reachable after his victory over Bronnikov in the 
U.S. Olympic Cup final last week. The win was particularly impressive since 
Bronnikov, nearly 10 years older than Mosley, is two-time European champion and 
ranked No. 1 in the Soviet Union in his class. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a lot of experience," Mosley said. "Since he's No. 1 in Russia and he's 
won the European championships two times, he knows what he's doing." 
</P>
<P>
He said he has to keep the victory in perspective, though. 
</P>
<P>
"I've fought fighters in the U.S. that I thought were tougher than he was, very 
strong and determined," Mosley said. "I was just quicker and outsmarted him." 
</P>
<P>
But Mosley said the bout provided a good tune-up for his appearance in the 
Goodwill Games, an event that he is approaching at an opportune time. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I'm going into the Goodwill Games at the right time because I've 
been training hard and my mind is focused on it so I think I can do well." 
</P>
<P>
Since returning from the U.S. Olympic Cup tournament, Mosley has resumed 
training with his father at the Pasadena Youth Athletic Club in Pasadena's 
Villa Parke. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be doing a lot of running, training techniques like twisting my body and 
just sharpening myself and keeping ready," Mosley said. 
</P>
<P>
Mosley will train at the gym until July 6, when he will leave to train with the 
rest of the U.S. team in Ft. Huachuca, Ariz., near the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
After the Goodwill Games, Mosley has the 1991 Pan American Games in Havana, 
Cuba, the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona and a professional career in his 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
The only question seems to be what weight class he will competing in. At 5-9, 
Mosley is expected to grow out of the 132-pound class. 
</P>
<P>
"He still has a lot of growing to do," said Jack Mosley, who is 6-0. "Our 
doctor said he should end up 5-10 1/2 or 5-11. I don't want to push him (to 
stay at 132) either. As you get older you just put on more weight." 
</P>
<P>
The boxer says he is undecided if he will make the switch to the 139-pound 
junior welterweight class after the Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I might make it after the Goodwill Games," he said. "It depends on how 
well I do and how much I grow. . . . I know that I'm lighter and I'm quicker 
and sometimes I feel a little stronger at that weight, too. I can easily move 
up to 139 now, but I feel more comfortable right now at 132." 
</P>
<P>
But Mosley, whose natural weight is about 142, realizes that he will have to 
make the move up to a higher weight class eventually. When he turns pro, his 
father thinks Mosley will fight as a welterweight (147) or middleweight (154). 
</P>
<P>
"Next year we will probably have to go up to 139 pounds so we'll have to start 
all over again," Jack Mosley said. "But I think he should be at the top of that 
level, too." 
</P>
<P>
Zanders thinks Mosley has the ingredients to be successful at any level. 
</P>
<P>
"I really think he has the potential to be a world champion," Zanders said. "He 
has the potential to be a champion in the Olympics, the Pan Am Games and the 
pros. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing he has to realize is that he has to stay focused and keep his 
intensity through each of his goals." 
</P>
<P>
Mosley is not about to get caught looking ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"I think about the Olympics all the time but I know I have to work to stay on 
top and there are a lot of people underneath me that want to get there, too," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The first step is to win at the Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
"Winning the gold medal at the Goodwill Games can help too -- maybe not as much 
as the Olympics, but it's definitely a good steppingstone." 
</P>
<P>
With a little more hard work, Mosley realizes it is an accomplishment that is 
well within his reach.

So where's the beat? Right here with The Lion I's, a group of seven Ventura 
County locals who do reggae right. They do original rockin' reggae that keeps 
the dance floor packed whenever and wherever they play. 
</P>
<P>
So infectious is The Lion I's beat that they could probably make a statue of a 
guy yawning in the opera get up and dance. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Raging Arb &amp; The Redheads, The Lion I's are probably the best 
draw among local bands. They play the usual places, such as Charlie's in 
Ventura. But they also have played The Ventura Theatre, a few places in Santa 
Barbara and San Luis Obispo and also at the recent Fiesta del Sol at the 
Ventura Marina. 
</P>
<P>
This Saturday, the band will open for the Jamaican reggae hot guy, Halie 
Maskel, at La Casa de la Raza in Santa Barbara, home to hardwood floors, cheap 
beer and killer burritos. 
</P>
<P>
The Lion I's feature Bobby Galyan on vocals, Guy Jeans on keyboards, Dave 
Spasiano on guitar, Robert Cadeel on drums, Brian Conaway on sax, Bruce Conaway 
on bass and Tony Soria on trumpet. 
</P>
<P>
"When we first started, Bobby and I used to do all these old blues covers," 
said Jeans, who is studying to be an elementary school teacher. "Then we met 
Dave and started doing a lot of parties, at least, until the cops came. We met 
Bruce and Brian, hit it off real well, and they joined and the band became 
better. Tony is the newest member. He joined two months ago." 
</P>
<P>
"We became a reggae band because we all like reggae," Galyan said. "We all like 
Steel Pulse, Black Uhuru, the English Beat and Bob Marley. We only do about 
four covers -- we've got over 20 originals, maybe three albums worth of stuff. 
We practice twice a week and play at least once a week. We're working on a tape 
right now, or maybe it'll be a CD. Anyway, whatever it is, it'll have about 10 
tunes on it." 
</P>
<P>
"We just want to get a tape out and get signed," Spasiano said. "Right now, 
everyone has a day job. I'm a Realtor, and a waiter at night. Guy delivers gum 
to machines; Bobby's in construction." 
</P>
<P>
The band is an example of democracy with a beat. "Everyone in the band has 
input, but I do a lot of music, and Bobby writes a lot of the lyrics," Jeans 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the tunes that inevitably pack the dance floor are "Closer," "Time Will 
Tell," "Gimme Some Time" and "Who to Trust." All of these songs are at least 
five minutes long, sometimes longer, and guaranteed to get the dancers in shape 
-- or kill them off. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't played our best gig yet," Galyan said, "but last December when we 
opened for Bamiki Bandula at The Ventura Theatre, we sounded pretty damn good. 
We love that big stage. 
</P>
<P>
"When we play, we want people to have a good time," Galyan said. "I just tell 
everybody to chill out. We don't want no violence; violence can ruin a band." 
</P>
<P>
* WHERE AND WHEN: On Saturday, The Lion I's will open for Halie Maskel at La 
Casa de la Raza at 601 E. Montecito St. in Santa Barbara. Tickets are $10. For 
more information call 965-8581.

Unwritten laws governing gentlemanly behavior, lace tablecloths and burp-less 
cucumbers all have their place in the game of cricket. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the spirit of the game, the good manners and traditions, and not just 
the technique which is important," said Wally Jayasinghe, a resident of Ventura 
and president of the Santa Barbara Cricket Club. 
</P>
<P>
The club, which was formed in 1921 and is the oldest on the West Coast, will 
hold a match against the Corinthian Casuals of the San Fernando Valley. The 
game will be played on July 8, the final day of Santa Barbara's Semana Nautica 
festival, which starts June 30. The celebration, now in its 53rd year, will 
feature 42 sporting events held throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
"Cricket is a gentleman's game," Jayasinghe said. "It is meant to be played 
under conditions of very good manners and honor." According to Jayasinghe, 
fights and foul words are alien to the sport, and "playing with the intent to 
injure an opposing team member is tantamount to cheating." 
</P>
<P>
While other sports use halftime break to critique the first half and prepare 
strategy for the second, cricket players use it to meet members of the opposing 
team and share hot tea, cake, fruit, and cucumber sandwiches. "Of course," 
Jayasinghe said, "they must be hothouse cucumbers because they're burp-less." 
</P>
<P>
"We always use a tablecloth for teatime, generally a lace one," he said. "It's 
one of those minor traditions we try not to let go of. Cricket was first played 
in England almost 800 years ago, and it's full of such small but respected 
traditions that have been passed down through the centuries. 
</P>
<P>
"Passing these rules of behavior on to the next generation invariably helps 
build character. Cricket is not just a game. It's a way of life. In all my 
years I have never met a man or woman who plays cricket to be of poor 
character," said the 59-year-old Jayasinghe. A native of Sri Lanka, he began 
playing the British game at age 8, and continued when he moved to the States at 
age 17. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Jayasinghe weathered a crisis when the club decided to stop using 
traditional porcelain tea cups and switch to plastic foam. 
</P>
<P>
"The directors took a vote and Styrofoam won for practical reasons," Jayasinghe 
said. "It was very hard on me, but my wife loved the idea. Before, she washed 
all the cups, so she thought the change was a very sensible idea." 
</P>
<P>
One tradition that Jayasinghe would like to see the club maintain is its yearly 
participation in Semana Nautica. The event, which means Marine Week in Spanish, 
is held each summer, turning the Independence Day holiday into a nine-day 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
In 1936, local residents challenged the crews of five Navy ships moored outside 
the harbor to an array of nautical contests. The festival has grown into a 
major sporting extravaganza. This year's competitions range from swimming, 
scuba diving and fishing, to soccer, fencing and backgammon. In addition, there 
will be a free sports medicine and fitness symposium and several Navy ships 
will cruise in for a visit. And for the first time, local artists will show 
their works at a sports art show. And, of course, there will be a rousing game 
of cricket, what? 
</P>
<P>
"Each year we invite a team for the Semana Nautica encounter which in the past 
season has given us a game in the true spirit of cricket," Jayasinghe said. 
"That honor has repeatedly fallen upon the Corinthian team for about five years 
now. The games we play are enthusiastic and competitive. But for us competition 
and winning are not the end-all and be-all. We play for the joy of the game." 
</P>
<P>
* WHERE AND WHEN: Semana Nautica runs from June 30 to July 8. Many competitions 
are still open to participants and all are free to spectators. A schedule of 
events is available at the Santa Barbara Chamber of Commerce or call 564-2052. 
The cricket match will be held July 8, noon to 6 p.m., at Laguna Blanca School.

Diversification is the operative term among historical groups within cities in 
Orange County. Advisory boards appointed by individual city councils recombine 
with smaller societies of citizens attempting to protect ancient structures 
from being razed by developers. Some groups are associated with particular 
historical landmarks; some serve as research libraries and offer their archives 
to the public; others offer group outings to visit historical sites but have no 
particular headquarters. The Pickwick Hotel, used as a workshop by the Anaheim 
Historical Society, met its demise by a wrecking ball in September, 1987; board 
meetings are today held at a member's bed-and-breakfast house. Public libraries 
are additional historical resources: the Elizabeth J. Schultz History Room, 
Anaheim Public Library; the Launer Room, Fullerton Public Library; the Santa 
Ana History Room, Santa Ana Public Library, and the Local History Collection, 
Yorba Linda Public Library.

FAMILY LIFE: MOVING ON -- BUT NOT GIVING UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE SPENCER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All things -- good, bad or otherwise -- must come to an end. And so it is with 
Family Life, which makes its final appearance today. 
</P>
<P>
Going on to other things, however, does not mean we're abandoning the stands or 
the issues articulated in this space over the months. 
</P>
<P>
* For example, I still am convinced -- regardless of the letters and calls from 
readers to the contrary -- that spanking is itself a form of child abuse, that 
the only time parents should lay their hands on their kids is to pat them on 
the back or give them hugs. 
</P>
<P>
Like the death penalty, physical punishment is irreversible. If I discover that 
my judgment was wrong or that I was too harsh, I can rescind a week's 
restriction on surfing, for example, but how do you rescind a smack in the 
mouth? 
</P>
<P>
Or, I can increase my form of punishment to fit the crime. How else but by 
hitting the child harder or longer -- or, worse, using a strap or a stick -- 
can a spanker increase punishment? 
</P>
<P>
Besides, all that spanking a child does -- other than inflict pain -- is to 
teach him or her that Rambo has the correct approach to life's problems. 
</P>
<P>
* Nor will I back off my belief that 90% of the creaking and groaning in our 
education system is the direct result of parental disinterest -- in both their 
kids and the schools. 
</P>
<P>
I am astonished by the pure chutzpah of parents -- especially those who have 
essentially turned over to the schools the raising of their kids -- blaming the 
schools for their kids' lack of knowledge or lack of manners. These are 
generally the same parents who have never taken the time to meet the teacher or 
visit the school. 
</P>
<P>
And they routinely vote against school bonds and oppose teacher pay increases 
because their kids haven't become super-achievers. 
</P>
<P>
* Literacy -- or the lack of it -- has been another pet issue in this corner 
over the past many months. And, again, it's the parents who can take the credit 
if their can kids read and the blame if they can't. 
</P>
<P>
Example is still the best teacher, and one can't be surprised that the kids of 
Orange County do poorly in reading when 40% of their parents tell pollsters 
they don't even bother to read a newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Where is a child to learn of the joy and the power of the printed word if not 
introduced to books in the home? 
</P>
<P>
* And nothing has changed since we began harping on the misdirection of the 
much-vaunted war on drugs. Most of the money still goes to the police, the 
courts and the prisons, and very little to prevention and treatment. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, an addict -- no matter how desperate for treatment -- must wait 
for at least six months to get any help from any public agency in Orange 
County, longer in other areas of the country. Private treatment centers, 
meanwhile, are going broke because insurance companies have drastically 
curtailed coverage for rehabilitation and the county agencies are forbidden by 
law from spending money at for-profit hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
So, while we all decry the drug rate and sport bumper stickers with the 
message, "I'm for a Drug-Free Orange County," we make it impossible for users 
to get any help. 
</P>
<P>
* We also refuse to recognize the seriousness of the alcohol problem with 
children. In the next two years, more American kids will die on the highways 
because of booze -- either as drivers or as passengers -- than died in the 
entire 10-year Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
Ten times as many people will die from alcohol-related problems than from 
narcotics; more careers ruined, more families destroyed, more kids orphaned, 
yet we will spend millions on silly "Just Say No" campaigns before we'll spend 
a dime on preventing alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
It might have something to do with the fact that while most parents don't have 
cocaine around the house, they could fill the swimming pool with the booze in 
the kitchen cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
* And why don't we hold accountable those public officials who were elected on 
"pro-family" platforms? Look around the cutting room floors of Sacramento and 
Washington and you will find nothing but discarded issues important to 
promoting family life. 
</P>
<P>
Child abuse prevention programs, mental health programs, substance abuse 
treatment centers and other social services get the ax. Why? Are they really 
less important than traffic enforcement and other heady issues the governor and 
Legislature face? 
</P>
<P>
We should ask them. 
</P>
<P>
* We also can't take our leave without thanking those who have been so helpful 
to this column, especially in the professional areas -- such people as 
psychiatrist Ed Kaufmann at UC Irvine, family therapists Rex King of Dana Point 
and Zena Polly of Irvine, substance abuse expert Jack Platt at Capistrano by 
the Sea Hospital, and many others. 
</P>
<P>
All of them, incidentally, agree that you could probably put them out of 
business by using some common sense, some tolerance, some patience, some 
kindness, some hugs, and lots of love.

UNITED WAY PLANS FUND-RAISING SHIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARITA HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Touted as its most radical revamping in its 70-year history in Los Angeles, 
United Way on Wednesday unveiled sweeping new fund-raising and distribution 
goals to address the needs of the region's quickly changing, multi-ethnic 
population. 
</P>
<P>
Long criticized for underfunding minority programs, the agency is setting a 
priority on funding programs that serve the region's growing ethnic mix, as 
well as addressing emerging issues such as AIDS, illiteracy, drug abuse and 
child care. 
</P>
<P>
United Way will focus more on the issues it views as critical and timely, 
rather than on funding agencies, as it has in the past, said United Way 
spokesman Clarence Brown. But it will continue to support the programs it has 
traditionally funded such as boys' clubs and the YWCA, he added. 
</P>
<P>
To accomplish this, the agency plans to step up its fund raising and develop 
strategies for tapping into the region's growing number of small businesses and 
foreign-owned companies. United Way, which raised a record $95 million this 
year for more than 350 social service agencies in Los Angeles, Kern and San 
Bernardino counties, has relied mostly on corporations and large companies for 
donations through payroll deductions. 
</P>
<P>
United Way's new focus follows an unprecedented two-year reassessment of the 
agency's direction that included input from a broad range of community 
volunteers and service organizations. The organization also sponsored a number 
of surveys and dozens of public meetings, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've seen United Way coming under enormous pressure in the last few years as 
a result of changes in the community," Maurice J. DeWald, chairman of the 
United Way committee that developed the plan, said in the agency's annual 
report released Wednesday. "Assessing our mission became essential. . . . 
Business as usual is no longer possible." 
</P>
<P>
Little opposition to the plan has surfaced so far. Because they were included 
in the planning, most agencies traditionally funded by United Way are 
optimistic that the agency's new goals will provide for all, said Robert W. 
Monk, director of boys' clubs in Pasadena and former chairman of a group that 
represents about 50 United Way-funded agencies in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"Some agencies are concerned that, perhaps, new agencies may be funded at their 
expense," he said. "But United Way has been open enough to convince me . . . 
that they'll approach the old agencies to provide a service before bringing in 
a new agency." 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Folcarelli, president of United Way of California, recalled that 
similar changes 15 years ago in Fresno's United Way were initially greeted with 
opposition from established organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"There is going to be resistance, but the focus has to remain on what is good 
for the community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Critics, however, question whether United Way can be all things to all people 
and how seriously committed the agency is to following through with the 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in this long enough to know that what people say they are going to 
do and what they actually do are two different things," said Danny Bakewell 
Sr., president of the Brotherhood Crusade, a competing fund-raising agency 
serving the black community. 
</P>
<P>
Bakewell said that his group and similar emerging groups in other minority 
communities were formed because United Way was not adequately serving their 
communities. Although pleased by United Way's plans to increase funding of 
minority programs, Bakewell added that it will only work if the agency is 
willing to respect minorities' sense of self-determination in serving their own 
community. 
</P>
<P>
United Way's plans call for collaborating with a broad range of grass-roots, 
ethnic, government and religious organizations to pool resources and address 
issues of common concern, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
The agency also plans to provide donors with more information about what their 
contributions are used for and to offer the option of specifying what social 
issues they want their money to be spent on.

PLAN TO RATION WATER GIVEN TENTATIVE OK; 
</P>
<P>
DROUGHT: L.A. CITY COUNCIL DELAYS FINAL VOTE BY AMENDING BRADLEY PROPOSAL. 
FINANCIAL PENALTIES WILL BE IMPOSED ON THOSE WHO FAIL TO CUT USE 10%. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bowing to the force of a four-year drought, the Los Angeles City Council on 
Tuesday tentatively approved a mandatory water-rationing plan that imposes 
financial penalties on those who fail to cut back water use by 10%. 
</P>
<P>
In a 10-4 vote, the council backed Mayor Tom Bradley's plan, but threw in a 
number of amendments that will delay a final vote on the measure for several 
weeks. The plan would take effect no sooner than late July. 
</P>
<P>
While the vote advanced Bradley's proposal, it was not a complete victory for 
the mayor. Bradley had hoped to have the program in place before the hot summer 
months when most of the city's water is consumed. 
</P>
<P>
If rationing is adopted, it would mark the first time since 1977 that Los 
Angeles residents have been required to restrict their water use. The 1977 
rationing, the first in the city's history, ended after several months with the 
coming of heavy rains. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Marvin Braude, perhaps the staunchest backer of mandatory rationing 
on the council, said the heat wave serves as a reminder of the severity of the 
current drought and the city's projected 10% water shortage this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"How can we forget that we live in a desert?" Braude said. "Isn't it prudent 
for us to provide a reserve? The reality is that there has been no rain." " 
</P>
<P>
The council, in an acrimonious four-hour meeting, proposed 13 separate 
amendments to Bradley's rationing plan. Council members rejected a proposal to 
exempt coin laundries from rationing and a proposal to ban lawn watering in all 
but mountainous fire districts. They passed amendments requiring the city to 
issue bilingual water conservation materials and to consider imposing fines on 
customers who fail to install water-saving devices. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the amendments were defeated but enough survived that the proposed 
rationing ordinance has to be rewritten before the council can take a final 
vote. The measure is expected to come back to the council July 10. If not 
unanimously adopted on that day, the measure would require a second vote a week 
later before becoming law. 
</P>
<P>
Under an urgency clause adopted Wednesday by the council, the law could be 
implemented immediately upon Bradley's signature. "We're ready to go," said Dan 
Waters, acting general manager of the Department of Water and Power. 
</P>
<P>
Waters said dozens of water monitors have been hired and computers have been 
programmed to alert consumers about their allotments. 
</P>
<P>
Some council members have remained skeptical of the need for rationing. Others 
remained adamantly opposed to a portion of Bradley's plan that would add 
several dollars to every customer's bill to pay the costs of implementing the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"We're already asking people to sacrifice by cutting use," said Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky. "That's enough." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky voted for the plan, but only after making an unsuccessful attempt 
to force the DWP to slash its own water division budget by 6% or $12.5 million 
to help pay for the program. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts by other council members to derail the plan failed as Bradley and his 
staff mounted a heavy lobbying effort. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor telephoned several council members in the council chambers Tuesday, 
including Richard Alatorre, who had threatened to introduce his own proposal to 
continue voluntary water conservation. Bradley chief of staff Mark Fabiani 
pulled members aside during the meeting to personally urge them to pass the 
plan intact. 
</P>
<P>
Fabiani said Tuesday that some members resisted because their constituents do 
not want rationing and believe the drought will end soon. 
</P>
<P>
But Fabiani said that the heat wave helped persuade the council that the water 
shortage may worsen before it improves. 
</P>
<P>
The plan approved Tuesday is virtually identical to the one imposed in 1977. 
All customers of the DWP will be required to cut their water use by 10% from 
1986 levels. 
</P>
<P>
For the first violation, customers would be charged $3 per billing unit of 
excess use plus 15% of their total water bill. A billing unit is 748 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
A second violation would cost the customer $3 per excess billing unit plus 25% 
of the bill. A third violation would boost the surcharge to $4 per excess 
billing unit and 75% of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
All customers would be banned from watering gardens between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. 
Existing law prohibits hosing down sidewalks and gutters, and providing water 
in restaurants except upon request. 
</P>
<P>
Exemptions to water allotments could be granted if: Cutbacks would result in 
unemployment; additional members have been added to a household; landscaped 
property has been added; employment has been increased at a commercial, 
industrial or government facility; production has increased at a commercial 
facility; a swimming pool is being filled for the first time.

Sharon Corbin saw it as one of those perfect summer days: temperatures 
rocketing to near 110 degrees, hot Santa Ana winds, mass discomfort. As 
Wednesday's heat smashed all records, Corbin cooled out in her family-owned 
warehouse surrounded by 200 tons of ice, stacked around her to glacial heights. 
</P>
<P>
The room was a frosty 20 degrees. But Corbin, shivering in a sweat shirt, found 
time to rejoice. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been backlogging ice waiting for just what's happening -- a heat wave," 
said the laughing, 47-year-old owner of the Torrance-based Southern California 
Ice Co., a wholesaling firm that would distribute more than 90 tons of the cold 
stuff by nightfall. "Come Sunday, (our warehouse) will be empty," a proud 
Corbin predicted. "This is an ice person's dream -- the heat." 
</P>
<P>
On a day given over to sunburns and inflamed tempers, a fortunate few in Los 
Angeles managed to escape the hell blast, or even to thrive on it. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1 million residents -- including more than a few who skipped work -- 
teemed onto the beaches, according to Los Angeles County lifeguards. Others 
stayed inside in the jet stream of air conditioners. Hockey coach Tom Caudill 
was one of the lucky souls who got to savor the refreshing chill of an ice rink 
-- and get paid for the privilege. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a dirty job, but I'm going to have to stay here and watch these kids," 
quipped Caudill in the 65-degree cool of Iceland, an ice-skating rink in 
Paramount. As chance would have it, his summer camp for 150 young hockey 
players will last all week. With a grin, Caudill said, "It beats working." 
</P>
<P>
Pools and water parks attracted extraordinary crowds. By midday, nearly 700 
youngsters had splashed through half-hour swim lessons at Torrance's Victor E. 
Benstead Plunge, and the line for an afternoon session of recreational swimming 
had reached 150 feet. If anyone missed a swim lesson, lifeguards were not aware 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
"Our attendance today has been outstanding," pool manager Kathi Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
El Monte opened its three-pool swimming complex 45 minutes earlier and kept it 
open an hour longer than normal. "We're jampacked," said recreation services 
manager Gonzalo Montalvo. "A lot of people see the lines of people waiting 
outside the pool and they just drive off. We could sure use another swimming 
pool today." 
</P>
<P>
At Raging Waters in San Dimas, the usual weekday crowds had nearly doubled to 
6,000 visitors, many of them crowding under waterfalls and into makeshift 
oceans. 
</P>
<P>
"We've broken all records for the month of June," spokeswoman Lynne Matallana 
said, describing water temperatures as, well, inviting. "I had my feet in. It 
feels real good." 
</P>
<P>
Claude McCaskill was one man who could go to work and keep cool. The 
cold-storage manager for the Los Angeles-based American Fish and Seafood Co. 
spent half his time in a massive, sub-zero refrigerator, wearing a heavy 
jacket, insulated socks and boots. "Today I am going from . . . temperatures 
that are below zero to temperatures in the 100s," he said. "It is very 
strange." 
</P>
<P>
His preference? "I can deal with the cold," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, found escape from the scorching heat more difficult. Bus 
driver Greg Jones stood on a street corner in Santa Monica, eager, for the 
first time he could remember, to go to work. His city bus, he said, is "the 
coolest place in town." 
</P>
<P>
An elderly homeless woman who called herself Mimi was ducking the sunlight by 
toting around her five bags of belongings from air-conditioned store to 
air-conditioned store, just to stay cool. It was difficult. Her clothing -- a 
winter jacket, white wool scarf and matching knit cap -- hardly helped. 
</P>
<P>
"The weather?" she asked. "It's horrible. When the wind comes up, it is really 
bad." 
</P>
<P>
Despite late-afternoon winds that virtually sandblasted some beach-goers back 
toward their homes, coastal areas were the greatest refuge. More than 45,000 
people who crowded onto the sand in Long Beach hardly seemed to notice the hot 
wind, said lifeguard Tim Murphy, who described it as "blowing like (a wind on) 
the Sahara Desert." 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen gusts up to 32 miles an hour, real hot and dry, but people aren't 
taking off," he said. "They just go in the water." 
</P>
<P>
In the South Bay, where temperatures were notably cooler than elsewhere in the 
county, street maintenance workers counted their blessings. 
</P>
<P>
"I live in West Los Angeles and when I left there this morning it was very, 
very hot," said Farid Hantabli, an analyst in Torrance's street department. "I 
got out of the car here and found out it's just beautiful outside. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it." 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Josh Meyer, Berkley Hudson and Janet Rae-Dupree contributed

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MCMARTIN JUROR WARNED NOT TO DISCUSS THEORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A juror in the Manhattan Beach McMartin Pre-School molestation retrial 
considered telling other jurors of a theory he developed about some testimony, 
a violation of court rules, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg this week privately told the juror that 
he must not discuss his theory with other jurors in the retrial of Ray Buckey. 
</P>
<P>
The judge further told the juror that he should not even be analyzing the 
evidence until jury deliberations begin July 9. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter received by the judge Monday, the juror laid out his theory about 
the testimony of one of the alleged victims, who said that the man who molested 
her had a beard and mustache. Buckey, 32, has denied ever having a beard or 
mustache. 
</P>
<P>
The juror stated in his letter, however, that he noticed that Buckey's face was 
frequently "very red," apparently from spending time in the sun, and that the 
alleged victim might have mistaken his sunburn for a beard.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HEAT SPARKS CONCERN FOR MANDELA CROWDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Organizers of Nelson Mandela's visit to Los Angeles were becoming concerned 
about the thousands of people who could spend hours Friday morning waiting in 
scorching heat for a noon speech by Mandela on the steps of City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
A pre-speech program is scheduled to begin at 10:30 a.m. and a crowd is 
expected to start gathering long before then. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures Tuesday and Wednesday were in the hundreds before noon. 
</P>
<P>
Willis Edwards, who is in charge of advance logistics for the local Nelson 
Mandela Reception Committee, said the committee was trying to determine how to 
provide water for such a large crowd. Two thousand seats, he said, were being 
provided for older and disabled people. Also, Alan Cowen, commander of the city 
Fire Department's Bureau of Paramedics, said emergency medical services 
technicians and medical transport trucks would be on hand to handle any 
emergencies.

HEAT-RELATED ILLNESSES 
</P>
<P>
People most at risk in hot weather are those suffering from such conditions as 
diabetes, heart disease, blood vessel disease, stroke, burns, alcoholism or 
obesity. People who have reduced capacity to sweat may also have problems in 
the heat, as will those with diarrhea, who can easily become dehydrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Hot weather such as Southern California is experiencing can cause heat-related 
problems including: 
</P>
<P>
 Dehydration 
</P>
<P>
Sunburn 
</P>
<P>
Heat cramps 
</P>
<P>
Heat exhaustion 
</P>
<P>
Heat stroke 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WARNING SIGNS 
</P>
<P>
Heat Cramps -- The least serious of the heat-related illnesses. Usually occur 
after exercise or physical labor in the heat 
</P>
<P>
Symptoms 
</P>
<P>
* Clammy or sweaty skin 
</P>
<P>
* Possible weakness or nausea 
</P>
<P>
* Occasional tingling in the arms and legs 
</P>
<P>
* Muscle cramps, often beginning in the abdomen and legs 
</P>
<P>
First aid 
</P>
<P>
* Get out of the sun and into a cool place 
</P>
<P>
* Lie down, drink cool, non-alcoholic liquids 
</P>
<P>
Heat Exhaustion -- The most common of the heat-related illnesses. Brought on by 
excessive sweating (loss of body fluids) 
</P>
<P>
Symptoms 
</P>
<P>
* Profuse sweating 
</P>
<P>
* Weakness, dizziness or feeling faint 
</P>

BLACK ACTIVIST FOUND GUILTY IN SECOND TRIAL; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: JITU SADIKI CLAIMED PROSECUTION ON BURGLARY CHARGE WAS RACIALLY 
MOTIVATED. HE WON A NEW TRIAL AFTER CONVICTION LAST YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A black community activist who claimed his prosecution for a Culver City 
burglary was racially motivated was convicted Wednesday for the second time in 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters, including members of a group called the Civil Rights Congress, 
denounced the verdict as "another example of how the system doesn't work for 
black men," and vowed to raise funds for an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Jitu Sadiki, 34, of South-Central Los Angeles, was convicted last year of 
breaking into a beauty salon and attempting to enter an adjacent pawn shop. But 
he won a new trial on the basis of incompetent counsel. This time, a Santa 
Monica jury of 11 whites and one black deliberated for less than two days 
before finding him guilty of two counts of second-degree burglary. 
</P>
<P>
Sadiki, who had been free on $2,500 bail, was immediately taken into custody on 
orders from Superior Court Judge James Albracht, with sentencing set for July 
18. He faces a maximum of three years and eight months in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
He already has served six years in prison on a murder conviction. 
</P>
<P>
The defendant's father, Otis Smith, said his son "wasn't prepared for this. He 
thought he'd be convicted on lesser charges, if at all." Smith said he and his 
wife will care for their son's three adopted children, ages 3 to 6. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors said afterward that their decision "wasn't easy," because the case came 
down to whether they believed Sadiki or the white police officer who identified 
him as the man he chased out the back entrance of the Deja Vu beauty shop two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We all felt under pressure," said one juror, who asked not to be identified. 
She added, however, that there was a gradual convergence of views in the jury 
room, with never any danger of a hung jury. The lone black juror said she did 
not want to talk about her decision. 
</P>
<P>
Sadiki, who did not testify at his second trial, maintained that he had been in 
a nearby bar at the time of the crime. However, patrons of the bar, frequented 
mostly by homosexual women, testified that no black man was present that night. 
</P>
<P>
He claimed to have been shot at and beaten by Culver City police, who 
acknowledged that they used force to restrain him after he allegedly tried to 
take an officer's gun during a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
In calling for a new trial in the case, a Santa Monica Superior Court judge had 
ruled that the first defense attorney did not put on "the best possible 
defense." 
</P>
<P>
Complicating matters, the boots Sadiki was wearing on the night of his arrest 
-- and which conceivably could have exonerated him if they did not match prints 
found at the scene -- were mistakenly discarded by authorities a year later. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Todd Melnik, who prosecuted Sadiki in both trials, said he 
was glad the issue has been settled. "There was no racism involved; the police 
department acted in good faith," he said. "I will not not deny that racial 
incidents do occur in the police force, but this is not one of them." 
</P>
<P>
Sadiki's attorney, Robert Harris, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Melnik said that Sadiki has demonstrated a pattern of not telling the truth, 
including the facts surrounding his earlier convictions for murder and car 
theft. He claimed to have been hospitalized at the time of the murder for which 
he was convicted, Melnik said, and after the medical records were shown to have 
been fabricated, he claimed he shot in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said Sadiki had turned a routine burglary case into a media 
campaign. His cause attracted supporters as diverse as former football player 
Jim Brown and anti-police abuse crusader Don Jackson, and raised about $15,000 
for his defense. 
</P>
<P>
His case appeared to many to be another example of trial by skin color. And his 
supporters noted that he had turned his life around since being released from 
prison eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Sadiki's father said this isn't the first time prejudice has touched his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
Another of his sons, Danny Smith, died after being shot seven times in the back 
by Culver City police five years ago, he said. The elder Smith said a wrongful 
death lawsuit, filed on behalf of the two youngsters the victim left behind, is 
to be heard next month.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: THESE PEOPLE WANT TO ADJUST YOUR TV SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No matter how sharp, gorgeous and sexy its pictures may be, high-definition 
television is not going to be just another pretty interface. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, for people to say that high-definition TV will be just like video but 
with ultra-sharp imagery is about as meaningful as some marketing geek back in 
1948 claiming that these newfangled television sets are just like radios with 
pictures; it's absolutely true but it completely misses the point. While it's 
easy to think of high-definition television as pretty pictures, it's smarter to 
think of it more as IBM TV -- a potentially provocative blend of technologies 
and programming. 
</P>
<P>
Technology is forcing a convergence of once separate industries: Computer 
displays are becoming more like television sets are becoming more like radar 
screens are becoming more like magnetic resonance scanners. Just as compact 
discs capture sound and music in digital form, technology enables us to capture 
and transmit imagery in digital form. The question isn't just designing 
high-definition television sets; it's creating high resolution imaging systems. 
The challenge is coming up with an architecture that embraces this new 
convergence. 
</P>
<P>
Which is precisely why U.S. representatives from companies including IBM, Apple 
Computer, Hewlett-Packard, Digital Equipment Corp., the cable television 
industry and broadcasters have quietly been meeting over the past few months. 
They want to become the Frank Lloyd Wrights and Le Corbusiers of this new 
digital-imaging architecture that will allow television imagery to flow 
seamlessly into computers -- where they could be digitally manipulated if 
desired -- and back again. Not incidentally, these people strongly believe that 
it's better for American companies to craft this architecture than the 
Europeans or the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time," says Lee McKnight, a post-doctoral student at MIT's 
Center for Technology, Policy and Industrial Development, "the broadcasters, 
cable industry, computer, telecommunications and satellite companies have all 
recognized that they have common interests in digital imaging that will shape 
the information economy of the future. They feel they will benefit by 
cooperatively developing these architectures." 
</P>
<P>
This Committee on Open High-Resolution Systems, which held a more public 
workshop this week in Washington under the auspices of the National Academy of 
Science and the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, is groping 
towards a consensus that would radically redefine the architectures of 
television sets and personal computers. Do not adjust your sets; they are being 
adjusted for you. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the television is a sealed-off box that can receive a broadcast 
transmission, a cable link and a VCR hook-up. But why not a TV set designed 
along the "open architecture" principles of the IBM Personal Computer? If you 
want to turn the TV into a computer, drop in a special board. Do you want your 
set to receive a high-definition TV transmission? Plug in the hi-def 
attachment. Want to build in freeze-frame, replay and editing capabilities into 
your television/computer? Just make the necessary attachments. In other words, 
the TV isn't just a TV anymore, it's part of an architecture that gives you as 
much power and versatility as you'd like. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, take your IBM PC or Apple Macintosh and plug in the board that 
turns it into a TV so that you can make multimedia presentations. The point is 
that, once you have a defined architecture -- and the technical standards that 
go along with it -- you have created a new infrastructure for innovation. (MIT 
Prof. Bill Schreiber proposed such an open architecture approach to the Federal 
Communications Commission two years ago -- don't hold your breath waiting for 
the FCC to act.) 
</P>
<P>
As one workshop participant put it, the issue of whether there will be 1,050 
lines or 1,150 lines of resolution in high-definition systems (as compared to 
today's standard of 525 lines) is "dumb because it limits you." The future of 
television should not be constrained by the number of lines you can slap on a 
screen; that should be a byproduct of the architecture, not its focus. The 
"modular" approach championed by the industry group is a clever way to assure 
that both consumers and manufacturers have more flexibility rather than less. 
</P>
<P>
This is critical because -- to be blunt -- we don't have a consumer electronics 
industry in this country anymore. Existing television standards (which were 
slapped together rather than built with any notion of systems architecture in 
mind) basically reinforce the notion of television sets as sealed boxes. By 
breaking that model, U.S. companies have a better chance to carve out niches in 
high-resolution displays, subsystems such as image enhancing systems and remote 
control devices, and, of course, programs that run on both the computer and 
television sides of this next-generation device. 
</P>
<P>
"The architecture must also accommodate whatever exists today and permit 
graceful transition from today's 'Tower of Babble' to the seamless 
inter-operatability that we need for the future," said Alan K. McAdams, 
workshop chairman and visiting fellow at the Economic Strategy Institute in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
In many respects, this architectural approach is a necessary first step that 
U.S. companies have to take in order to hope to compete in this newly 
convergent marketplace. Certainly the Toshibas, NECs, Hitachis and N.V. Philips 
of the world are already well positioned to participate in these markets. 
However, they have not yet demonstrated the same grasp of systems architecture 
that successful American companies have historically had. America's unique 
competence in this domain gives U.S. industry a fighting chance to be a real 
leader of these emerging hybrid technologies. 
</P>
<P>
Getting the Federal Communications Commission to set broadcast standards that 
recognize this new reality will be no mean feat. Indeed, getting the government 
to recognize that new standards are even necessary will be as challenging as 
any of the technology. But the opportunity is here and some of this country's 
sharpest engineers are trying to exploit it. But whether the Americans, 
Japanese, Koreans or French do it, it will get done, and what it means to turn 
on and watch television is going to change.

AS MANY SUFFER, SOME LIKE IT HOT 
</P>

Southern Californians were doing what they had to do to escape the heat 
Wednesday. Some went to the beach. Others tried to bribe air conditioner 
salesmen. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, they say, 'How much is it going to take to get you out here?' " 
said Don McMillan, sales manager of Brody Heating &amp; Air Conditioning on 
Robertson Boulevard in Los Angeles. The company, which installs and repairs air 
conditioning systems, handled hundreds of calls, many from people who 
discovered to their horror that air conditioners that had sat idle all winter 
would not work. 
</P>
<P>
As temperatures approached 110 degrees in downtown Los Angeles for the second 
consecutive day, McMillan and other merchants selling relief from the heat saw 
business surge. 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers at a K mart in East Los Angeles gobbled up all the store's window air 
conditioners Wednesday and left a dwindling supply of fans, said Floyd Salazar, 
merchandise manager for the Commerce store. It sold about eight air 
conditioners Wednesday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We normally sell half that quantity the whole summer," Salazar said. 
</P>
<P>
By late afternoon, the Circuit City outlet on Sunset Boulevard was also out of 
air conditioners, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Union Ice, a Los Angeles distributor, Wednesday reached its 160-ton daily 
production capacity, said general manager Larry DuRee. 
</P>
<P>
The company, whose customers include distributors and grocery stores, was 
handling about 2 1/2 times normal volume, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The phone has been ringing off the hook since about seven o'clock this 
morning," he said. "We're packaging every pound we can make." 
</P>
<P>
"We've probably taken more calls during the last two days than we've taken 
during the last four to six weeks," said Susan Kaiser, general manager at Brody 
Heating &amp; Air Conditioning. "I've been here four years and this is the most 
inundated we've ever been. People are really suffering." 
</P>
<P>
Kari Mason, supervisor in the home improvement section of Sears in Santa 
Monica, said her office has been flooded with calls and pushy shoppers since 
Tuesday, when her salespeople rang up $15,000 in sales of air conditioners and 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
"They are taking beat up air conditioners, old ones, whatever," she said. "I 
just gave one lady a beat up air conditioner that was missing parts. I warned 
her, but she said 'Please, give it to me. Give me anything.' " 
</P>
<P>
Coastal hotels were doing a brisk business too. 
</P>
<P>
There was a line for registration at the just-opened Guest Quarters hotel in 
Santa Monica, a short walk to the beach, and the phones were ringing off the 
hook. 
</P>
<P>
"We have people checking in here because they don't want to be in their homes 
-- a lot of people," said front desk clerk Lisa Girardi. 
</P>
<P>
Occupancy at the posh Santa Monica hotel jumped 12% overnight; a phenomenal 
increase given that the hotel just opened several months ago, marketing 
director Dennis Fitzpatrick said. Calls began flooding in from the San Fernando 
and San Gabriel Valleys, San Bernardino and almost everywhere else not close to 
the beach on Tuesday, he said, but the volume increased so dramatically on 
Wednesday that the hotel decided to let people check in at least four hours 
before the usual 3 p.m. check-in.

Sitting at an outdoor cafe next to Santa Monica Place were two women who would 
not give their names. "I come here to keep cool and to take care of all my 
errands while staying air conditioned," said Wendy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's called strategically placed errand shopping," said her friend. 
</P>
<P>
Another popular attraction was the area movie theaters, with people queuing up 
for Robocop II and other movies well before the shows started. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course we're here to escape the heat. Why else would we go in the 
afternoon? We're playing hooky," said Marina Strong, a self-employed woman from 
Pacific Palisades, after she and a friend bought tickets to Robocop II at the 
Cineplex Odeon/Broadway Cinemas in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter what's playing," said her friend, Ron Rickards. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as it's cheap, it's cheerful and it's cool," added Strong. 
</P>
<P>
While customers may have ventured outside for ice and air conditioners, they've 
postponed other shopping. 
</P>
<P>
Merchants at a deserted Sunset Plaza in West Hollywood Wednesday afternoon said 
they had never seen midday business so dead at the outdoor shopping area. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown, the Westin Bonaventure Hotel canceled today's "Arco concert," one of 
a series of weekly outdoor concerts that draw the lunchtime business crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Said hotel manager James Simkins, "At this point, we feel it would be 
absolutely dangerous to go on with it."

Hotdog Recall Widened: J. M. Schneider Inc. of Ontario, Canada, is voluntarily 
expanding its recall last week of 22,000 pounds of frankfurters to include 
grocery stores throughout the United States, the Agriculture Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the recalled franks are suspected to being contaminated by 
Listeria monocytogenes, which can cause listeriosis, a potentially serious 
disease. The product, Schneider's Franks, is sold in one-pound packages. The 
words "Canada 35" appear inside the inspection seal on the label. All bearing 
the "Best before" date of "Jul 03" are being recalled.

HON WITHDRAWS OFFER TO BUY LANDMARK LAND PARCEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Laguna Hills developer Barry G. Hon said Wednesday that he has ended his 
$275-million bid to buy a Riverside County parcel from Landmark Land Co., whose 
prize golf courses, resorts and residential acreage he also once coveted. 
</P>
<P>
Hon, who only two months ago had agreed to buy most of Landmark's real estate 
holdings for $967 million, said it would be "too risky" to buy a 6,700-acre 
parcel called Oak Valley from Landmark's thrift subsidiary, Oak Tree Savings 
Bank in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
The "current real estate recession," he said, made the price too steep. 
</P>
<P>
Hon's decision leaves Oak Tree without its anticipated gains from the sale, 
which it needs to bolster its capital base, its final reserve against losses. 
By Monday, the thrift will fail to meet three federal criteria for adequacy of 
capital, said Gerald H. Barton, Landmark's chairman, president and chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
Oak Tree would still be solvent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Barton said he met Tuesday with the New York investment banking firm Salomon 
Bros. to develop a new strategy to sell Oak Tree's three real estate divisions. 
That strategy will be part of a capital plan that he now must submit for 
approval by federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
He said he expects Salomon Bros. to line up buyers for the three divisions in a 
coordinated deal within three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Landmark is one of the most widely recognized names in golf course 
developments, and the company's properties include such gems as PGA West, La 
Quinta and Mission Hills Country Club, all in the Palm Desert area. 
</P>
<P>
The company holds more than $1 billion worth of real estate through Oak Tree, 
but federal law enacted last August to bail out the thrift industry's deposit 
insurance system now requires S&amp;Ls to sell their interests in such 
investments by the end of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Though both Hon and Barton left open the possibility they might work out a deal 
later, neither side is seeking to negotiate any deal now. 
</P>
<P>
Under Hon's original deal in mid-April, he agreed to buy Landmark's golf course 
and resort properties in three states and more than 10,000 acres of developable 
land. But the two-phase transaction required Oak Tree to provide roughly 75% of 
the financing, which regulators decided was too much. They blocked the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Hon and Landmark revised the agreement to limit the sale to the Oak 
Valley property. Hon would put down $75 million by the end of July -- and Oak 
Tree would finance the rest -- for a planned golf course community at the 
Pomona Freeway and Interstate 10 near Beaumont.

FLUOR DANIEL IS AWARDED HUGE SAUDI OIL PACT; 
</P>
<P>
ENERGY: THE DEAL IS SAID TO BE PART OF A DRIVE BY THE COUNTRY TO BOOST ITS 
PRODUCTION AS WORLDWIDE OUTPUT SLOWS.

Fluor Daniel Inc., the construction and engineering division of Irvine-based 
Fluor Corp., said Wednesday that it has landed a Saudi Arabian oil facilities 
contract that some industry analysts say could be worth as much as $6 billion 
over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
Fluor Chief Executive Les McCraw said the pact, which he called "prospectively 
the most significant project we've had in over a decade," is part of a 
multibillion-dollar drive by Saudi Arabia to boost its oil production to 
replace slackening worldwide output. 
</P>
<P>
McCraw would not comment on the value of the program management contract, 
saying the total is not known because the work will be released in several 
phases over the next seven to nine years by Saudi Aramco, the Saudi Arabian 
government-owned oil company. 
</P>
<P>
The contract is not expected to create any significant new employment at Fluor, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fluor, a major international construction and engineering firm for the past 
three decades, was hit hard in the oil crash of 1981 and has been rebuilding 
and refocusing since. As part of the restructuring, Fluor reduced its 
dependence on oil-related projects -- which accounted for as much as 85% of its 
business in the late 1970s -- and began aggressively seeking industrial and 
government work as well. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, McCraw said, Fluor Daniel's hydrocarbon unit accounts for only about 
30% of the company's total revenue. That will increase with the new Saudi 
Aramco contract, he said, "but it will have a lesser effect in the current 
fiscal year and become a more significant part of our backlog in subsequent 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Fluor's backlog of work -- a major measurement of an engineering and 
construction firm's business -- currently is about $9 billion, down from an 
all-time high of $16.3 billion in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
McCraw said that while the percentage of oil-related business will grow, Fluor 
won't repeat its earlier errors. The company's dependence on the oil industry 
led to a $633.3-million loss in fiscal 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Employment plunged to 14,000 in 1987 from a high of 44,000 in 1981. It has 
rebounded to a current level of 20,000 in the wake of a 1986 restructuring that 
led to creation of Fluor Daniel. 
</P>
<P>
Fluor, which maintained a major business relationship with Saudi Arabia in the 
1970s and at one time was involved in more than $10 billion in contracts there, 
was one of several U.S. companies asked to bid on the contract, said Herbert E. 
Hart, an analyst with the San Francisco investment banking firm of S. G. 
Warburg. 
</P>
<P>
Other finalists were Bechtel Corp. of San Francisco, Parsons Engineering of 
Pasadena, Dresser Industries of Dallas and Foster Wheeler Corp. and Lummis 
Crest Inc., both based in New Jersey, said Hart. 
</P>
<P>
Fluor apparently had a leg up on the other competitors for the program 
management pact because of its longstanding presence in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"We stayed as a company and maintained our presence there even after the big 
oil work ended" in the early 1980s, said McCraw. Fluor's Saudi operations 
helped build the state university and did commercial engineering and 
construction jobs all through the 1980s. "We were there, so it was only natural 
for them to ask us for a proposal. . . . They asked others also." 
</P>
<P>
But Fluor "has always had a good relationship with Aramco and has a great 
reputation in Saudi Arabia and in the engineering and construction management 
business," Hart said. "There will be a lot of subcontracts that will be let to 
non-U.S. companies as part of all this, and it is interesting that the Saudis 
only wanted U.S. companies for the three prime contracts."

LEADING INDICATORS CLIMB 0.8% IN MAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The government's main economic forecasting gauge climbed 0.8% to a new high in 
May, the government reported Wednesday in a new sign that the nation's longest 
peacetime expansion will last at least through the end of its eighth year. 
</P>
<P>
However, the report also pointed to a sobering new drop-off in consumer 
confidence. And one analyst said the economy "could be close to a recession by 
the end of the year." 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said its index of leading economic indicators, designed 
to forecast economic activity six to nine months ahead, rose to 146.2% of its 
1982 base. The previous record of 146.0 was set in January, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts attributed the improvement mainly to overseas demand for U.S. 
products and said U.S. consumer spending remains weak. Some suggested that 
because of consumer restraint, economic growth could slow further in the months 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the largest negative in the report was an index measuring consumer 
confidence, which fell back from a slim advance in April. It also had been 
negative in January and February and unchanged in March. 
</P>
<P>
Other recent Commerce Department reports and a national survey earlier this 
month by the Federal Reserve also point to a slowdown in consumer spending, 
which accounts for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
"Consumers are getting to be a lot more cautious than they have been," said 
Bruce Steinberg, senior economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New 
York. "The main reason they're retrenching is they are weighed down by the debt 
they piled up during the 1980s." 
</P>
<P>
David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a New York 
government securities firm, said consumers also are beginning to worry about 
their job outlook and "a constant barrage" of unfavorable economic news. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts said exports appear to be picking up the slack, stimulating the 
manufacturing sector, which has been sluggish for months. Overall, the economy 
grew at only a 1.1% annual rate in the last quarter of 1989 and just a 1.3% 
rate in the first three months of this year, although that was enough to keep 
alive the expansion that began in November, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"The May leading indicators show that except for housing and construction, the 
production side of the economy is beginning to recover," said William K. 
MacReynolds, forecasting director for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg agreed, but said: "It's principally the export industries that are 
doing well right now. And that's principally the high-technology companies like 
computers, and the aircraft industry."

FORMER SHEARSON CHIEF TO GET $10 MILLION IN SEVERANCE PAY

<P>
Peter A. Cohen, who was ousted as chairman of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 
earlier this year, will receive a severance package worth about $10 million, 
individuals familiar with the pact said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen was ousted in January by American Express Co. Chairman James D. Robinson 
III as part of an overhaul designed to stem mounting losses and morale problems 
at the nation's second-largest securities firm. American Express holds a 
controlling interest in the brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
The severance package completes the much-publicized separation as the firm 
continues a major restructuring that includes returning to its old Shearson 
Lehman Bros. name.

BRANIFF EXPECTS TO DEFAULT ON PAYMENTS TO CREDITORS

Braniff Inc. acknowledged in a quarterly report released Wednesday by the 
Securities and Exchange Commission that the company will likely default on 
payments to unsecured creditors and not make distributions to stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
Braniff Inc., the Orlando, Fla.-based parent company for Braniff Airlines, 
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last fall, and began liquidating 
assets to cover its $300 million in debts. 
</P>
<P>
But with the sale of its last major asset -- the rights to buy 74 Airbus 
Industrie A-320 planes -- Braniff is conceding most of its creditors will not 
be paid and its shareholders will not receive distributions. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not presently anticipated that the plan or reorganization will provide 
for substantial payment of the company's unsecured liabilities or of any 
distributions to equity holders," the SEC filing said. 
</P>
<P>
The statement in the filing was confirmed by Joel Shapiro, an attorney with 
Blank, Rome, Comisky &amp; McCauley in Philadelphia, a law firm representing 
Braniff. 
</P>
<P>
The filing is likely to mean that $100 million of Braniff junk bonds, whose 
holders include Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., Connecticut National Bank of 
Hartford, and Citizens &amp; Southern National Bank in Atlanta, will not be 
repaid. Also in jeopardy are debts held by Braniff's unsecured creditors, which 
include Dalfort Corp. of Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
David Levine, an attorney with the Miami law firm McDermott, Will &amp; Emery, 
which is representing Braniff's bondholders committee, declined comment on the 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, Braniff's remaining funds will first be used to 
pay administrative and legal fees, post-petition claims by landlords, leasing 
obligations, taxes and back salaries for employees. Any remaining funds will go 
to creditors and stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
But the initial payments are expected to fully deplete the $48 million that 
Braniff will receive from Orix Corp of Tokyo for its rights to the Airbus 
planes, a deal announced June 14. Braniff received a total of $62 million in 
the transaction, but $14.2 million will be paid to Airbus for outstanding 
debts. 
</P>
<P>
Except for some spare parts, Braniff has no other remaining assets, although 
routine investigations could theoretically bring in additional funds for 
creditors.

Last winter's bitter cold spell cost Florida's commercial foliage industry 
about $175 million, industry officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Dade County alone suffered damages of about $100 million to tender tropical 
plants, trees and shrubs, said the Florida Nurserymen and Growers Assn., based 
in Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
"The numbers aren't quite as large as we had anticipated right after the 
freeze, but they still have to be considered conservative," said Earl Wells, 
executive vice president of the association. 
</P>
<P>
Foliage prices rose an average 15% because of shortages of plants, particularly 
palms and other tropical trees, Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
Florida is the nation's leading foliage producer, with about 5,800 commercial 
nurseries and $1 billion a year in revenue, according to the state Division of 
Plant Industry.

VALUE OF MAY CONSTRUCTION DEALS RISES 6%

Three public works projects totaling $300 million helped boost the value of new 
construction contracts in May by 6% from the month before, the F. W. Dodge 
Division of McGraw-Hill said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodge index of construction contracting, which uses 1982 as its base of 
100, rebounded to 155 in May, compared to April's four-year low of 147. 
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted indicator of future construction activity represents 
the value of newly started projects of all kinds. 
</P>
<P>
In May, contracting for public works and utility projects grew 12% to its best 
level this year. The projects included three lock-dam structures being built by 
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers along waterways in Oregon, West Virginia and 
Pennsylvania, Dodge said. 
</P>
<P>
Although these projects gave the May figures a lift, the level of general 
building activity also rose, Dodge said. Non-residential building contracting 
advanced 6%, while residential building rose 4%. 
</P>
<P>
Despite May's increase, year-to-date contracting activity was 7% below the 
activity in the same five months of 1989, Dodge said.

FAMILY S&amp;L FOUND NEGLIGENT; BROKER GETS $900,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court jury has awarded $900,000 to an Altadena real 
estate broker after concluding that Family Savings &amp; Loan was negligent 
when it failed to prevent a former teller from defrauding the depositor of $1.2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The real estate broker, Wilbert B. Simms, has alleged that the teller, Nghia 
Thi Sabol, lured him into a fraudulent business partnership when she was teller 
at Family's Pasadena office in 1980. She accepted money from Simms as part of a 
bogus plan to make short-term loans to Vietnamese immigrants in Southern 
California, according to the civil complaint. Under the plan, Sabol was to 
invest her own funds with Simms in loans that were to pay high interest. 
</P>
<P>
Simms' attorneys argued that Family Savings management should have been aware 
that Sabol had written checks for large sums against insufficient funds on a 
thrift account while she was employed there. The complaint alleged that 
management ignored "suspicious" conduct by Sabol and contends that managers 
should have warned Simms to be cautious. The complaint also alleged that Sabol 
was allowed "unfettered access" to Simms' bank records. Family Savings 
contested the negligence claims. 
</P>
<P>
Simms sought damages of $1.6 million. However, after reviewing evidence 
presented during the three-week trial, the jury concluded that Simms was 
partially negligent and provided a lower damage award. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Sabol was convicted of grand theft in Los Angeles Superior Court and 
sentenced to seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1980 and 1982, Sabol persuaded Simms to provide cash, jewelry and real 
estate equity to finance the lending scheme, the civil complaint said. Sabol 
used a forged Family Savings passbook to delude Simms into believing that she 
had deposits of about $500,000, according to the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
Simms handed over some of the money to Sabol through her teller's window at the 
branch office, and she continued to take money from Simms after leaving her 
position at Family Savings, the complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
Executives at Family had no immediate comment on the case. The loss was the 
latest in a series of legal problems at Family Savings. Oliver A. Trigg Jr., 
ousted as the thrift's chairman in 1988, was ordered to sell his shares in 
Family Savings after a lengthy federal investigation into possible fraud at the 
thrift.

AGENCY PUTS ANOTHER 59 S&amp;LS ON BLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Federal regulators hung out "for sale" signs Wednesday on 59 more failed 
thrifts, including four in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The four are First Network Federal Savings Bank and Westwood Savings, both in 
Los Angeles; Western Empire Federal Savings &amp; Loan in Yorba Linda, and 
Investment Federal Savings &amp; Loan in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The aggregate amount of deposits held by the latest batch of thrifts for sale 
is $8.2 billion, though none of them has more than $500 million in deposits. 
</P>
<P>
A week earlier, regulators put 14 large institutions with combined assets of 
$39.8 billion on the block. Those thrifts included Mercury Savings &amp; Loan 
in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of this week, the Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency 
managing and selling failed thrifts, hopes to sell three more failed 
institutions. If it does so, it will reach its goal of 141 sales for the third 
quarter of the government's fiscal year, which will end Saturday, said Kate 
Spears, an agency spokeswoman. Since it was created last August, RTC has sold 
190 failed thrifts with total assets of $50.7 billion, she said. 
</P>
<P>
One other California S&amp;L is among the thrifts put up for sale Wednesday. It 
is Westport Federal Savings in Hanford, Kings County. 
</P>
<P>
Western Empire, which now has total deposits of $317.8 million, was a failing 
thrift that was rescued from the regulatory death knell in late 1988 when the 
New York investment firm of Castle Harlan Inc. bought it without federal 
assistance and based its revival on trading in high-risk, high-yield corporate 
securities known as junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Last August, Congress ruled that thrifts would have to divest their junk bonds 
within five years as part of its massive thrift industry restructuring law. The 
junk bond market fell, sinking Western Empire. Regulators seized the thrift 
Feb. 16. 
</P>
<P>
First Network, which now has $412.6 million in deposits, was seized April 20. 
Regulators promptly asked the FBI to investigate possible criminal wrongdoing 
at the thrift. The S&amp;L was headed by Carl M. Rheuban, a Westside 
businessman with close ties to Democratic politicians. 
</P>
<P>
Westwood Savings, which has been in the hands of federal regulators for more 
than a year, was seized Feb. 17, 1989. The thrift now has $357 million in 
deposits.

FLECKTONES: MORE HIP THAN HAYSEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bluegrass it ain't. Despite the twang of strings and the whine of a harmonica, 
banjo-picking Bela Fleck and his trio, the Flecktones, come up with something 
more urban than country, more hip than hayseed. 
</P>
<P>
Their music is what the Mahavishnu Orchestra might have sounded like if it had 
been led by Earl Scruggs rather than John McLaughlin. 
</P>
<P>
The group's long show Monday at the Roxy, consisting mainly of Fleck originals 
pulled from his latest Warner Bros. recording, fused a number of influences and 
technologies with some solid musicianship into what aficionados call "new 
grass." Fleck puts the emphasis on the "new." 
</P>
<P>
Each band member contributed some kind of innovation, even if some were more 
technological than musical. Fleck, who also played acoustic five-string during 
the show, opened on a banjo whose familiar circular soundtable was encased in a 
Fender-style electric guitar body. Even percussionist Roy Wooten, sans traps, 
played a "Drumitar," a drum machine with large pastel buttons that has a neck 
like a guitar. 
</P>
<P>
But there was also invention of the musical sort. By bending notes with 
pin-point precision, harmonica-man Howard Levy, who often worked his mouth 
organ with one hand while playing electric keyboard with the other, pulled the 
full chromatic scale from his simple blues harp. Bassist Victor Lemonte Wooten 
(Roy's brother) has adapted the two-handed "tap" technique of guitarist Stanley 
Jordan to his instrument, fingering the neck of his bass as if it were a 
keyboard. During an unaccompanied solo he played the melody of "Chopsticks" and 
"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairies" in the upper register while providing his own 
bass line. 
</P>
<P>
Fleck showed some slick chording during his own "Sunset Road," and put in some 
appropriately stormy dissonance during an uptempo "Hurricane Camille."

FLUOR CORP. AWARDED $6-BILLION SAUDI PACT 
</P>

Fluor Daniel, the engineering and construction arm of Fluor Corp., Wednesday 
landed what appears to be the largest contract in Fluor's 78-year history -- 
estimated by sources to be worth $6 billion -- to oversee expansion of 
petroleum facilities for Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Fluor Chief Executive Les McCraw called the pact "prospectively, the most 
significant project we've had in over a decade." 
</P>
<P>
The contract, which will run five to nine years, is expected to provide a major 
boost in the continuing revitalization of Fluor, Orange County's largest public 
company. The firm, which was badly hurt early in the 1980s by the collapse of 
the oil industry, has staged an impressive turnaround in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
The deal calls Fluor Daniel's hydrocarbon division to oversee expansion of 
Saudi onshore and offshore oil and gas facilities, including natural gas 
plants, pipelines, production facilities and offshore platforms. The work is 
part of a multibillion-dollar drive by Saudi Arabia to boost its oil production 
to replace slackening worldwide output. 
</P>
<P>
The contract is not expected to create a significant number of new jobs at 
Fluor, which has 20,000 employees worldwide and is one of the largest employers 
in Orange County. But the company, which has about 100 engineers in Saudi 
Arabia, will eventually relocate about 300 other technicians there from other 
locales, McCraw said. 
</P>
<P>
In landing the huge contract, Fluor beat five major competitors: Bechtel Corp. 
of San Francisco, Parsons Engineering of Pasadena, Dresser Industries of Dallas 
and Foster Wheeler Corp. and Lummis Crest Inc., both based in New Jersey, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
McCraw would not comment on the value of the contract, saying that the total is 
not known exactly because the work will be released by Saudi Aramco, the Saudi 
government-owned oil company, in several phases. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts valued the deal at more than $6 billion, making it the largest 
deal Fluor has ever landed in dollar terms and one of the most important since 
the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Fluor's success was not surprising because of its past ties to Saudi Aramco, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
While trading in Fluor's common stock was heavy, with 621,700 shares changing 
hands, the price surge was only moderate. The stock closed trading on the New 
York Stock Exchange at $46.625 a share, up 87.5 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
Fluor, founded in Santa Ana in 1912, has emerged as one of the nation's major 
international construction and engineering firms in the last three decades. But 
it was hit hard in the oil crash of the early '80s, when oil prices fell from 
near $30 a barrel to less than $10 a barrel. Fluor has been rebuilding and 
refocusing ever since. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the restructuring, Fluor ditched its dependence on oil-related 
projects -- which accounted for up to 85% of its business in the late 1970s -- 
and began aggressively seeking industrial and government work as well. 
</P>
<P>
Fluor Daniel's hydrocarbon unit now accounts for only about 30% of the 
company's total revenue, McCraw said. This will increase with the Saudi Aramco 
contract, "but it will have a lesser effect in the current fiscal year and 
become more significant part of our backlog in subsequent years." 
</P>
<P>
Fluor's backlog of work -- a major measurement of an engineering and 
construction firm's business -- is now about $9 billion, up from $8.4 billion 
at the end of fiscal 1989. The company's backlog peaked at $16.3 billion in 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
McCraw said that while the percentage of oil-related business at Fluor Daniel 
will grow because of the Saudi Aramco contract, Fluor will not repeat its 
earlier errors. The company's dependence on the oil industry led to a 
$633.3-million loss in fiscal 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Employment plunged from a high of 44,000 in 1981 to 14,000 in 1987. It 
rebounded to a current level of 20,000 after a 1986 restructuring that led to 
Fluor Daniel's creation. 
</P>
<P>
In fiscal 1989, which ended Oct. 31, Fluor reported net income of $108.5 
million, nearly double the $56.4 million it reported in fiscal 1988. Its gross 
revenue last year was $6.2 billion, in contrast with $5.1 billion the year 
before. 
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of its 1990 fiscal year, Fluor said, net income was 
$66.2 million, up 45% from the year-earlier $45.5 million, while revenue of 
$3.7 billion was up 23% from $3 billion in the first half of its fiscal 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The company's largest previous contract, a management agreement to oversee a 
$5-billion natural gas development program in 1976-82, was also in Saudi 
Arabia. In the 1980s its largest job was building a $1-billion copper mine in 
Chile. 
</P>
<P>
Fluor, which maintained a major business relationship with Saudi Arabia in the 
1970s and at one time was involved in more that $10 billion in contracts there, 
was one of six U.S. companies asked to bid on the contract, according to 
Herbert E. Hart, an analyst with the San Francisco investment banking firm of 
S.G. Warburg. 
</P>
<P>
The contract Fluor won is the biggest of three related agreements that together 
could represent $15 billion in work, Hart said. Fluor apparently had a leg up 
on its competitors for the program management pact because of its longstanding 
presence in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"We stayed there as a company and maintained our presence there, even after the 
big oil work ended" in the early 1980s, said McCraw, noting that Fluor helped 
to build the Saudi state university and did commercial engineering and 
construction jobs all through the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"We were there," he said, "so it was only natural for them to ask us for a 
proposal. They asked others also." 
</P>
<P>
Hart agreed that Fluor has always had a good relationship with Saudi Aramco and 
had a good reputation for its engineering and construction work in Saudi 
Arabia: "There will be a lot of subcontracts that will be let to non-U.S. 
companies as part of all this, and it is interesting that the Saudis only 
wanted U.S. companies for the three prime contracts." 
</P>
<P>
Fluor Daniel's contract calls for it to act as overall program manager for 
expansion of onshore and offshore oil and gas facilities and to pull Saudi 
Aramco's northern onshore and offshore oil and gas plants out of mothballs. 
</P>
<P>
The northern Saudi facilities were shut down in the early 1980s, when 
overproduction caused the price of oil to collapse. At the time, Saudi Arabia 
was producing up to 30 million barrels of crude a day. 
</P>
<P>
Hart said the Saudi government has made it known in the industry that it would 
like to get back up to 10 million barrels from current production levels of 
about 5.7 million barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
Production, meanwhile, continues to fall in the United States and Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The Saudis have also reported several recent discoveries of light, low-sulfur 
crude oil. If that represents a significant oil field rather than several small 
and undevelopable ones, Hart said, the Saudis will probably want new production 
and refining facilities to be built to handle the high-priced and highly 
sought-after product. 
</P>
<P>
Work on the Fluor Daniel contract will begin in July, McCraw said, and will be 
handled primarily out of Fluor offices in Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia, and in 
Houston.

TOPS IN L.A. TOO: Orange County's two "Donalds" are so powerful that L.A. 
Magazine's list of that city's "30 Most Powerful People" (E8) wouldn't be 
complete without them, says Editor Lew Harris. . . . The Irvine Co.'s Donald L. 
Bren is No. 10. "He's got money, he's got power. . . . He's a big shot," Harris 
says. No. 30? Developer Don Koll: "He's been shaping the Southern California

O.C. BASHING: A Riverside Press Enterprise column this month blasted Orange 
County voters for being in debt to the freeway system while refusing to tax 
themselves to improve it. . . . "Orange County's way of building Southern 
California," it said, "is to pull back a gnarled, shriveled hand -- afraid it 
might be asked to give a dime in return for the dollar it is taking." Stan 
Oftelie, O.C.'s transportation czar, has heard such criticism and says, "We're 
being isolated . . . and no one is stepping in to save us." Jeffrey A. Perlman

The Senate approved a sweeping overhaul of the nation's housing policies. The 
96-1 vote would make available $17.9 billion next year -- an increase of $3.1 
billion from the current level -- for housing for low- and moderate-income 
families. The Bush Administration supports the Senate bill but opposes a 
measure awaiting House action that would increase federal housing programs by 
far more.

A small grass fire, possibly started by fireworks, burned about 20 acres on 
Wednesday, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire started about 2:30 p.m between Back Bay Drive and Jamboree Road, 
Newport Beach Fire Department Capt. Ray Pendleton said. 
</P>
<P>
No structures were damaged and there were no injuries, Pendleton said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters from Costa Mesa, Huntington Beach and Fountain Valley helped 
Newport Beach crews put out the fire in about two hours, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The fire was of suspicious origin," Pendleton said. "We believe it might have 
been started by fireworks." 
</P>
<P>
He said the investigation is continuing and no suspects have been identified. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials closed Jamboree Road between Coast Highway and San Joaquin Hills 
Road for several hours while they extinguished the blaze and mopped up the 
area.

TRANSIENT SAYS BLAZE STARTED BY CAMPFIRES; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTIGATION: COUNTY AUTHORITIES CALL HIS STORIES 'CONFUSED.' THEY SUSPECT 
THAT THE FIRE THAT SEARED THROUGH CARBON CANYON WAS DELIBERATELY SET. 
</P>

<P>
A 29-year-old transient who was arrested Wednesday on suspicion of arson in a 
blaze that seared through Carbon Canyon told fire officials he had been making 
a pot of coffee when the flames accidentally got out of control. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Diaz Reyes told investigators he had set up camp Tuesday night behind the 
Santa Fe Energy Co. building on Carbon Canyon Road, where the blaze apparently 
originated, according to Orange County Fire Department Capt. Hank Raymond. 
</P>
<P>
After waking up Wednesday morning at his camp, about half a mile east of Carbon 
Canyon Regional Park, Reyes said, he started a little fire to make coffee, 
according to Raymond. 
</P>
<P>
When the fire spread to the nearby brush, Reyes told investigators that he 
moved about aquarter-mile down the canyon to start another fire to make his 
coffee, Raymond said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials, however, said they do not believe Reyes' story. 
</P>
<P>
"His stories are . . . confused," Raymond said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite finding cooking utensils and burned packages of coffee and tea, fire 
investigators said they believe that the fires were set intentionally -- and 
not for making coffee. 
</P>
<P>
Officials declined to elaborate on their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
When the flames from the second fire also started to spread, Reyes fled, 
officials said. The two fires later joined into one conflagration, which 
charred more than 3,500 acres and burned at least six homes. 
</P>
<P>
Brea police, working on a tip from a witness who said he saw Reyes leaving the 
canyon, picked him up shortly after the 11 a.m. fire started. 
</P>
<P>
Police then turned Reyes over to county arson investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said that they do not know how long Reyes had been camping out 
in the brush and that items found in his possession indicated that he may have 
come from Blythe. 
</P>
<P>
Reyes was being held in Orange County Jail in lieu of $25,000 bail.

CARE BY STOREFRONT IMMIGRANT CLINICS FACES SCRUTINY; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: MOST ARE LEGITIMATE OPERATIONS GIVING THE POOR ACCESS TO ATTENTION 
THEY MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE HAVE. BUT MORE UNQUALIFIED EMPLOYEES ARE PRACTICING 
ILLEGALLY.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thousands of low-income immigrants are flocking to storefront medical clinics 
that have sprung up on street corners and in mini-malls throughout Southern 
California -- walk-in, cash-only facilities where the service is quick but the 
quality of care, authorities say, can be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Most are legitimate operations that give the poor and working class access to 
medical attention they might not otherwise have. 
</P>
<P>
But authorities say an increasing number are unlicensed facilities where 
unqualified and overworked employees practice medicine illegally. 
</P>
<P>
They do a brisk business. One four-clinic chain, whose operators face trial for 
the unlicensed practice of medicine and related charges, was attending 1,000 
patients a week when police raided it last year. 
</P>
<P>
Through court records, medical investigators' reports and interviews with 
former employees and patients, a number of examples emerge of alleged illicit 
medicine at clinics frequented by immigrants: 
</P>
<P>
A man previously convicted of illegally practicing medicine is accused of using 
his wife's license to treat scores of patients in Spanish-speaking 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
A doctor schooled in Mexico but not authorized to practice in this country 
repeatedly failed a test that measures medical knowledge, yet was hired by 
clinics twice. 
</P>
<P>
A doctor whose license was revoked in 1987 answered a newspaper ad and started 
attending patients in a clinic in the Westlake area, authorities said. His true 
status was revealed only by a chance encounter with a physician familiar with 
his history. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles city attorney's office says the number of bogus-clinic cases it 
has prosecuted has doubled since 1986, to about 12 last year. But many go 
undetected, and those that are shut down by police often reopen days later. 
</P>
<P>
"These clinics spring up not only in poverty neighborhoods but more in 
neighborhoods where there is an ethnic community, where people prefer to go to 
(doctors) of their own ethnic group," said Joan Jerzak, supervising special 
investigator for the Medical Board of California, which is empowered to 
investigate complaints about doctors. 
</P>
<P>
"People might not even know whether the doctor has a license," she said. "The 
doctor says he's a doctor, and they believe him. It's a man or a woman with a 
white coat and a stethoscope, who says 'doctor,' and that's it." 
</P>
<P>
A legal loophole in the state Health and Safety Code allows some clinics to 
fall into a gray area that is not closely monitored by any regulatory agency. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, a clinic must be licensed by the state or, in the case of Los 
Angeles, by the county, whose agencies are in charge of regulating the 
facility. But a doctor can bypass the county by incorporating, obtaining a 
fictitious business permit from the Medical Board and using the term "clinic" 
to label his or her private practice. In those cases, the clinic is not subject 
to the same regulatory scrutiny that county-licensed clinics receive. 
</P>
<P>
And, in many cases, the doctor illegally fails to obtain the 
fictitious-business permit, meaning no agency at all is responsible for 
inspecting the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Even if there were more scrutiny, officials say, bogus clinics are likely to 
flourish for other reasons. Their storefronts fade into their densely populated 
community, attracting little official attention. Their mostly immigrant 
patients -- many of them in this country illegally -- fear authorities and will 
not report poor medical care. 
</P>
<P>
The clinics can tap quickly into a ready and huge clientele -- a pool of 
patients whose health-care options are already limited by poverty, illegal 
status, culture and mistrust. They are reluctant to go to government-run 
hospitals but eager to find practitioners who speak their language. 
</P>
<P>
The case of Leopoldo Torres, 40, is typical. Unable to take time off work to 
spend in the waiting rooms of county hospitals, he went to an East Los Angeles 
clinic that he had heard of through family word of mouth. They spoke Spanish 
there. He felt comfortable. He trusted. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Torres blames his partial blindness on the care he received at the 
unlicensed clinic. The personnel treated his symptoms, giving him vitamin shots 
and drugs, but ignored his diabetes, he says. Treatments sometimes cost $150 -- 
nearly half his weekly earnings as a food-truck vendor. 
</P>
<P>
He never suspected the clinic's "doctors" were unlicensed -- until police shut 
the facility last year. 
</P>
<P>
"How can you know?" Torres, a native of Mexico, asked in Spanish. "Supposedly, 
they were doctors. If I had known, I would not have gone. Going to a witch 
doctor would have been better." 
</P>
<P>
When health inspectors climbed a wide flight of stairs and walked into the 
second-floor offices of the Santa Ines Clinic, in the Westlake District near 
MacArthur Park, they found unlicensed workers examining urine specimens under a 
microscope and administering intravenous infusions, according to court 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
In one examination room lay an elderly Mexican woman with an IV tube attached 
to her arm; in another room sat a younger woman suffering from facial pains. 
</P>
<P>
In a third room sat a 14-year-old boy. The investigators asked the youth why he 
had come to the clinic, and he said he had "an infection." 
</P>
<P>
"He showed me a 2-centimeter broken skin area on his right wrist and stated 
that he also had a sore in the groin area," one of the inspectors, a registered 
nurse employed by the county Department of Health Services, reported in court 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him what caused this, and he said that the doctor had told him it was 
caused because he 'ate' too much bread or something like that." 
</P>
<P>
Inspectors were so alarmed by one patient's condition that they called 
paramedics to take her to a hospital, said David Childress, a county health 
facilities surveyor who led the inspection. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a questionable operation," Childress said in an interview. "Whenever 
you have untrained people giving injections, starting IVs, giving treatment . . 
. there's always a potential for danger or injury." 
</P>
<P>
On that day last summer, police arrested Salvador Cano and his wife, Dr. 
Enriqueta Silva, identified in court papers as sole shareholders in the Santa 
Ines Medical Enterprises Inc., which managed Santa Ines and three other 
clinics. Silva is a licensed physician. Authorities allege that Cano used 
Silva's license, prescription pad and even the masculine form of her name -- 
Dr. Enrique Silva -- to write prescriptions and treat patients. 
</P>
<P>
Cano, who was convicted in 1986 for the unlicensed practice of medicine at the 
same location, faces trial later this year on three misdemeanor counts of 
practicing medicine without a license and 68 other counts, including Labor Code 
violations. Silva is charged with aiding Cano by lending him her medical 
license. Both deny the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Silva also has been accused by the Medical Board of signing a death certificate 
for a patient she never saw and of failing to notify the coroner's office of 
the patient's death, according to a complaint obtained by The Times. She faces 
a hearing and could lose her license. 
</P>
<P>
The patient, Maria Pena, a diabetic mother of four, died Jan. 22, 1989, after 
receiving treatment at a clinic in the Santa Ines chain, the complaint states. 
Pena's family has filed a wrongful-death suit naming Silva, Cano and the 
corporation. 
</P>
<P>
Silva is contesting the Medical Board accusation. Her attorney, Joshua Kaplan, 
declined to comment further except to deny the charges against her. 
</P>
<P>
In court papers seeking a separate trial for Silva, Kaplan stated that if her 
license had been improperly used, it was "without the consent of Dr. Silva." 
Kaplan added that Silva had no hiring or employee-relations responsibilities in 
the clinics and suggested he would argue that Cano exerted a Svengali-like 
influence over Silva. 
</P>
<P>
Cano's lawyer, Ed Tolmas, labeled the Svengali characterization as "crazy." 
Tolmas said Cano has a medical degree from a university in Mexico but that his 
role at Santa Ines was limited to bill-paying and other administration tasks -- 
not the practice of medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Five other people involved in operating the clinics were also charged with Cano 
and Silva. They were James E. Mack, a disbarred attorney identified in court 
papers as secretary of the corporation; Frank Hegyi, a licensed chiropractor 
who is also accused of threatening to turn in an employee to immigration 
authorities if he spoke to investigators; Bruce Miller, an accountant for the 
chain of clinics; and Kelly S. Klatt, a Los Angeles police officer on 
disability leave, and his wife, Samantha, identified as former clinic 
administrators. 
</P>
<P>
All claim innocence. Kelly Klatt, tried separately, was convicted last fall of 
unfair labor practices and misrepresentation to the public by claiming the 
clinic was a legitimate medical clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the charges in the Santa Ines case involve labor practices and tax 
evasion. A separate investigation by the Division of Labor Standards 
Enforcement of the state's Department of Industrial Relations turned up a 
number of alleged violations: employees were required to work up to 11 hours a 
day, six or seven days a week, without receiving overtime pay. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the clinic administrators, who often paid employees in cash, 
failed to withhold taxes and underreported the size of its payroll. Employees 
were owed back wages exceeding $100,000 but, because they were undocumented 
immigrants, could be counted on by clinic administrators to keep quiet, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cano was "running a sweatshop," said state Deputy Atty. Gen. Gary Wittenberg. 
In addition to the criminal charges filed by the city, the state is suing Santa 
Ines Medical Enterprises, Cano and some of his co-defendants in Superior Court 
in an effort to exact civil penalties and recoup back wages allegedly owed the 
clinics' workers. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not know he (Cano) was not a doctor," a former employee told The Times. 
"Everybody always called him 'Doctor.' He always used the name Dr. Silva, Dr. 
Enrique Silva." 
</P>
<P>
The former employee, who asked that her name not be published, worked for nine 
years in a hospital in her native Ecuador but has no U.S. license. She served 
as a medical assistant in the clinic. In an interview, she described long 
hours, days without lunch breaks, and duties for all the employees that ranged 
from mopping floors to clerical work to giving shots and pregnancy tests. 
</P>
<P>
"We all did a little of everything," she said. "I had experience but many 
(co-workers) did not. One had worked as a secretary in Mexico; here, she worked 
as a nurse with Dr. Silva. Another had never worked anywhere. She didn't know 
what a syringe was. The doctor showed her, more or less, and she was giving 
injections, regardless of what might have happened." 
</P>
<P>
Former employees have told investigators that while an average visit would cost 
$20, many patients ended up having to pay $100 by the time tests and treatments 
had been prescribed. 
</P>
<P>
Tolmas, Cano's lawyer, contended that Cano and Santa Ines were a "clean 
operation" that had been unfairly singled out. 
</P>
<P>
"If you drive up and down 7th Street from two blocks east of Alvarado . . . you 
can turn your head left and right, and every place says 'Clinica, clinica,' and 
(I'm told) there are no doctors in those places," Tolmas said. "Why Cano and 
that facility are being singled out personally bothers me." 
</P>
<P>
Tolmas added that since the first injunction last summer, Cano and his staff 
have followed all of the court's instructions, such as taking down the "Santa 
Ines Medical Clinic" sign. Further, he argued, the clinic had provided an 
important service for the community by offering medical care to the indigent. 
</P>
<P>
Under a Superior Court judge's orders, Silva is allowed to continue in private 
practice; her offices are at the former site of the Santa Ines Clinic. And Cano 
has been allowed to continue to work in clinic administration while he awaits 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
Wired to a listening device, an undercover medical board investigator using the 
name Ernesto Zapata entered the All Stars Medical Clinic in East Hollywood last 
fall, complaining of stomach pains and a burning sensation in his gut. 
</P>
<P>
The "doctor" who examined him, according to charges filed last month in 
Municipal Court, was Andres Lugo, a man who said he was trained as a physician 
in Mexico but who did not have a license to practice medicine in the United 
States. According to the complaint, Lugo, 35, later told investigators he had 
failed to pass -- three times -- a medical test routinely given to graduates of 
foreign medical schools that would have allowed him to study for a license in 
this country. 
</P>
<P>
Lugo poked around Zapata's stomach and asked questions about other symptoms, 
about what he had eaten, how much beer and tequila he had consumed and whether 
he had any history of heart or kidney trouble, according to a transcript of the 
secretly recorded conversation filed in court. An assistant took Zapata's blood 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Lugo diagnosed Zapata as having gastritis and prescribed Mylanta and a drug 
used in treating ulcers, according to the transcript. Investigators said Lugo 
later acknowledged using a prescription pad pre-signed by the licensed doctor 
who runs the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Once Zapata dressed and left, investigators moved into the All Stars Clinic, 
arrested and handcuffed Lugo and took him to jail. He was released on his own 
recognizance and is scheduled to be arraigned this month on three misdemeanor 
counts of unlicensed practice of medicine and falsely advertising himself as a 
doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Lugo told investigators he was hired by Dr. Jairo Gomez, a psychiatrist, to 
help run the clinic, according to court documents. Prosecutors say Lugo was 
also hired last year to fill in for a sick doctor at a clinic in Whittier. He 
had checks printed with the title "Dr." before his name, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
Lugo could not be reached for comment. Gomez, who has not been charged, told 
The Times he hired Lugo to work as a "medical assistant" to perform specific 
tasks but not to practice medicine. While declining to discuss details of the 
case, Gomez said Lugo was not authorized to use his prescription pad.

IT'S HOT! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It started hot and turned into a scorcher, sending temperatures across Orange 
County soaring into the 100s. And it's not over yet. Weather forecasters say 
it's going to stay this way. 
</P>
<P>
Tales From the 'Burbs 
</P>
<P>
How hot was it? Well, it was so hot, ants were crawling into people's 
refrigerators and freezing to death. Rats, delirious with thirst, were falling 
to their deaths in back yard swimming pools. An 18-year-old mixed terrier in 
Irvine suddenly keeled over in front of its water dish. And the snakes at the 
Santa Ana Zoo were slithering for cover. 
</P>
<P>
Irritable pregnant women flocked to a Fullerton women's center Wednesday after 
a sleepless night. The Women's Center advises women in their last trimester to 
lay chilled towels across their stomachs to help cool down. Doctors also 
suggested drinking lots of fluids, staying indoors and abstaining from fast 
foods high in salt content. In hot weather, it is especially unwise for 
pregnant women to run for buses or carry heavy bags of groceries.

What was more unpopular than glaze oozing off a gooey swirl doughnut? Well, the 
chili at the concession stands in Anaheim Stadium was running a close second. 
It seems Orange County residents were much more interested in the Big Gulp, a 
44-ounce drink sold by 7-Eleven. One Brea store operator reported selling more 
than 800 of the super-size sodas Wednesday.

<P>
An outdoor class was postponed at the Leisure World retirement community for 
fear some of the senior residents would suffer heatstroke. 
</P>
<P>
Comedians made light of the heat in their stand-up routines. Says Steve 
Briscow, who is appearing this week at the Improv Comedy Nite Club in Irvine: 
"They're going to have a new advertising campaign now for Los Angeles: 'This is 
your brain,' then, 'This is your brain in Los Angeles' and it's a fried egg." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Kravitz, who appears at the Comedy Club in Los Angeles, recounts: "It was 
so hot that I saw two trees fighting over a dog."

How to Shelter Your Pet 
</P>
<P>
Pets of all types -- birds, animals and fish -- are endangered by the heat 
wave, according to Dr. Scott Weldy, a veterinarian at El Toro Animal Hospital. 
Here are some of his tips to pet owners: 
</P>
<P>
Don't leave a pet in your parked car for even 30 seconds. They can quickly die. 
</P>
<P>
Leave plenty of water in various locations. Try to give them cool water. If 
you're leaving the house in the morning, put ice cubes in a big bowl of water 
to keep it cool. 
</P>
<P>
If you put pets outside, make sure they have shaded and cool areas to be in. 
</P>
<P>
If you leave a pet in the house, set the air conditioning to keep the 
temperature down to 80 degrees. If the temperature gets to 90 degrees or above, 
heat becomes critical for pets, including fish. 
</P>
<P>
If the house is not air conditioned, make sure pets are in rooms that have 
cross-ventilation, with either fans or open windows. 
</P>
<P>

The seven-month search for a superintendent for the Orange Unified School 
District has ended. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Norman Guith, superintendent of the Alvord Unified School District in 
Riverside County, was selected from 43 applicants in the nationwide search to 
replace John Ikerd. 
</P>
<P>
Ikerd resigned last November after school board members expressed a lack of 
confidence in him. 
</P>
<P>
Guith called his appointment "the biggest opportunity of my life" and said he 
relishes the challenge of stepping into a troubled district like Orange 
Unified. The district has experienced bitter union conflicts, financial scandal 
and fiscal instability in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
"When I ask anyone to tell me about Orange, they start talking about the 
problems here," Guith said. "Yet I look at their test scores and I see an 
education system that's very strong." 
</P>
<P>
Guith, who has spent 14 years as a school superintendent, said "everything I've 
learned I'll be able to put to use in Orange. And I should be able to help them 
make the district the best in the county -- if not the state." 
</P>
<P>
Guith will take over immediately for interim superintendent Stan Corey, said 
Tom Neill, a spokesman for the district. Guith, 50, was superintendent of the 
Central School District in San Bernardino from 1978 to 1982 and was 
superintendent of the Borrego Springs Unified School District from 1975 to 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
He received a doctorate in educational administration from the University of 
Southern California in 1974. He and his wife, Melani, live in Alta Loma and 
have eight children.MARY HELEN BERG

POLICE PRESS CAMPAIGNS FOR RECRUITS

Santa Ana Police Chief Paul M. Walters on Wednesday introduced a campaign to 
recruit more local applicants for some of the toughest jobs on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Billboards portraying a smiling Officer John Aguilar and a slogan, "Earn Our 
Academy Award," will be installed around Santa Ana as part of the city's 
$50,000 advertising effort to recruit police applicants. 
</P>
<P>
The first billboard went up Wednesday at 3rd and Bristol streets, just three 
blocks from where Aguilar grew up -- a point not lost on Walters, who wants to 
attract local Latino applicants. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping that he'll make an influence on the young people in our community 
to grow up and become police officers," Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next year, 25 billboards and 25 bus shelter advertisements will be 
installed at various places in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Other Orange County cities are also turning to advertising and other promotions 
to recruit applicants. Recruiting Officer Dave Hill of the Orange Police 
Department said he has had to flood the advertising market to fill police 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
"We also advertise in newspapers and trade journals -- I was even on a game 
show (Classic Concentration) and put in a plug," said Hill, adding that Orange 
has five police openings. "We even got a call from Toronto." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana has openings for 17 patrol officers and hopes to add another 10 
investigator jobs when the city adopts its new budget, Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
Applicants must pass exhaustive tests and a background check that includes 
credit history and driving records, said Lt. Marty Shirey, investigator. 
</P>
<P>
"We look at the person's total background," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although standards have not been lowered in an effort to find more recruits, 
the city has removed some of the obstacles to applying for the jobs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in three months the department will replace an old test with a 
general knowledge test that will require less study to pass. The city now 
issues a book concerning laws and police procedure that applicants must study 
to pass the test, Shirey said. 
</P>
<P>
"We get liars and people who have been fired from three or four jobs," she 
said. "What we're looking for is sound judgement, maturity and that they show 
some responsibility and honesty." 
</P>
<P>
The problem isn't in finding enough applicants, Walters said, but in finding 
people who will survive the screening. 
</P>
<P>
"Out of every 100 applicants, we only hire one," he said. "We just want to 
maintain the highest standards." 
</P>
<P>
Walters said Aguilar was chosen to be a Police Department spokesman because of 
his ties to the community, his cultural background and his career achievements. 
</P>
<P>
"Growing up in this town, I have a little more sincere feeling about this city 
and this community," Aguilar said. 
</P>
<P>
He joined the Orange Police Department in 1977 and was named officer of the 
year in 1980. He has worked in law enforcement on the federal level and is now 
assigned as an investigator of sexual assault crimes in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The job pool has changed over the last few years, said Lt. Greg Cooper, who 
recruits and trains officers for Santa Ana. For example, out of 212 people who 
applied for police positions in June, 60% failed to show up for the initial 
written test. There's also an agility test, medical examination, oral test, 
psychological test and background check. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Cooper expects to hire two or three potential officers from the 212 
applications. These few will attend the police academy for more than three 
months, then take 16 weeks of field training. 
</P>
<P>
In Irvine, where there are two unfilled police jobs, Sgt. Jeff Kermode says he 
has seen a change in the job force. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a different work ethic now. People are into 9-to-5," he said. "They 
want to do their job, earn their pay, and leave." 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach also has five openings on its police staff and the Tustin 
Police Department has four. MARY ANNE PEREZ and DALLAS M. JACKSON

STREET REPAIR, MORE POLICE ARE BUDGETED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Major street repairs and an additional police officers are included in the 
1990-91 budget adopted this week by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed budget of $16 million is up more than $289,000 over last year's, 
City Manager Darrell Essex said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in good financial shape," Director of Finance Richard Storey added. 
</P>
<P>
The additional police officer will be funded in January through the drug 
asset-forfeiture fund only if the monies are available, Essex said. 
</P>
<P>
Street repairs of more than $390,000 were approved by the council. A majority 
of the projects will be in the northern part of the city, Director of Public 
Works Robert Beardsley said. 
</P>
<P>
Several long-range projects were also included in the budget. City officials 
are developing a waste-reduction program which eventually will require all 
residents to recycle. 
</P>
<P>
Funding was provided for an overhaul of the city's record-keeping operation. 
"We are in desperate need of modernization," Essex said. 
</P>
<P>
More revenue is expected over the next few years when several redevelopment 
projects, including the Sorrento Homes housing development and the addition of 
a major hotel, are finally finished, Storey said. Also, the amount of money the 
city receives from the Los Alamitos Race Course is anticipated to increase as 
the new owners continue to improve the track.

CITY GEARS UP FOR HOLIDAY FIREWORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police and fire spokesmen say their departments will be ready for the 10,000 
people expected to attend the city's annual Fourth of July fireworks show at 
the San Clemente Pier. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department will restrict traffic in the Pier Bowl area to residents 
only between 5 and 10 p.m. on July 4. 
</P>
<P>
The pier will be closed starting at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
A 20-minute fireworks show will begin about 9 p.m. City officials said the 
municipal beach will be closed to the public from immediately after the 
fireworks display until 4 a.m. next Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Police Sgt. Richard Downing said the Police Department will deploy all its 
officers on July 4 in order to enforce city ordinances against non-professional 
fireworks and consumption of alcoholic beverages on the beach and pier. 
</P>
<P>
Police and fire units will restrict traffic on the following streets: Corona 
Lane, Capistrano Lane, Santa Ana Lane, Alameda Lane, Coronado Lane, the 500 and 
600 blocks of Avenida del Mar, the 400 and 500 blocks of Monterey Lane, and the 
500 and 600 blocks of Avenida Victoria.

SPECIAL TRAINING AIDS CITY EMPLOYEES

<TEXT>
<P>
Keeping city employees motivated in small communities -- where the employee 
base is low and opportunities for advancement scarce -- has long been a problem 
facing municipal governments. 
</P>
<P>
With a city staff of 270 employees serving 35,000 residents in this seaside 
community, San Clemente has faced this challenge. 
</P>
<P>
But a year-old program called Leadership '90 has gone a long way toward 
boosting morale and providing employees with strong management skills, city 
officials say . 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night 16 employees were honored at an awards ceremony for their 
participation in a series of intensive daylong workshops and field studies 
during the past nine months. 
</P>
<P>
The participants, who were nominated for the program by their department heads, 
were trained for administrative duties that normally are not part of their 
jobs. For example, they recently were taught emergency management techniques 
during a recent trip to the San Onofre nuclear power plant. 
</P>
<P>
"The program has been extremely helpful," said Bonnie Martinez, a city 
recreation supervisor, "not only about learning administrative 
responsibilities, but in forming relationships with people in other divisions 
that you don't normally work with." 
</P>
<P>
The leadership program was developed last year by Greg Hulsizer, former 
assistant city manager. 
</P>
<P>
"Leadership '90 provides an opportunity to grow personally and professionally, 
and to develop strong leadership skills," Hulsizer wrote in a brochure sent to 
all city employees. The format offers "an excellent combination of individual 
and group learning as well as opportunity for hands-on experience." FRANK

LEAF BLOWERS LEAVE RESIDENT 'TRAPPED' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ellen Margetich dreads Saturday mornings. She used to look forward to spending 
the day gardening in her back yard or relaxing at the pool, but not anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically you are trapped in your home by leaf blowers," Margetich said in an 
appearance before the City Council this week. "The fumes and noise are 
unbearable." 
</P>
<P>
Margetich, who lives on Culebra Street, told the council that a virtual army of 
gardeners toting leaf blowers descends on her block about 9 a.m. and leaves 
behind a trail of fumes, dust and noise. "My whole house fills up with dust and 
fumes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
To keep the effects of the blowers out of her back yard, Margetich asked the 
council to follow in the footsteps of several other Orange County cities and 
place some type of restrictions on the gardening equipment. "I have a right to 
use my own yard," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In response to her request, the council agreed to hold a public hearing next 
month to gather information from other residents. 
</P>
<P>
"They are loud and noisy," Councilman John Kanel said at this week's meeting. 
Citing the controls other cities have placed on the blowers, Kanel sympathized 
with Margetich. "I do think it is something to look at in order to give people 
relief." 
</P>
<P>
About 60 California cities -- including Newport Beach, Costa Mesa and Laguna 
Beach -- have laws restricting hours that leaf blowers may be used. 
</P>
<P>
In May, Irvine allocated $70,000 to hire an inspector to certify blowers used 
by landscaping and gardening firms. Earlier this year, Irvine became the second 
city in the nation to require that the machines meet acceptable decibel 
standards and that mufflers and motors be in proper working order. 
</P>
<P>
Although no action was taken, Cypress officials talked about both banning the 
blowers and placing restrictions on them. Councilwoman Margaret M. Arnold 
expressed concern about passing an ordinance, saying it could add to drought 
problems. "People could start watering their sidewalks," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing has been scheduled for July 23.LINDA NATALI

4 PEOPLE HELD, $1.5 MILLION SEIZED IN DRUG RAID; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE CASH WAS FOUND IN A SAFE UNDER THE PATIO OF A HOUSE IN ORANGE. THE 
FOUR ARE SUSPECTED OF LEADING A NATIONWIDE RING SELLING CRACK COCAINE AND PCP.

<P>
Four people suspected of leading a major crack cocaine and PCP distribution 
ring are in custody after federal agents raided a house in Orange and seized 
more than $1.5 million in suspected drug profits from a safe buried beneath a 
patio there, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Agents discovered the safe, authorities said, when they smashed through the 
cement patio during the raid of the split-level house in the 800 block of South 
Yorba Street. The house is believed to be owned and used by members of one of 
the nation's biggest drug trafficking organizations, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Johnson, 27, of Orange, who authorities said owns the house and who 
they believe is the ringleader of the organization, was arrested. He was 
charged with drug trafficking and conspiracy Monday in U.S. District Court in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The others arrested in connection with the case and charged in the federal 
complaint were identified only as Tyrone Hall, Derek Burkes and Oscar Mellado. 
</P>
<P>
All four remain in federal custody in Los Angeles pending the outcome of a 
detention hearing to determine whether they will be held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
Seven other men are named in the complaint, but they have not been apprehended. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities also searched two other properties over the weekend in which 
Johnson has an interest. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Monica Bachner described the ring as a "significant source 
of cocaine and PCP distribution throughout the country." 
</P>
<P>
The ring was reportedly based in Compton and distributed 500 kilograms of 
cocaine, 100 gallons of phencyclidine (known as PCP) and between 10 and 15 
kilograms of heroin a month, according to an affidavit filed in U.S. District 
Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The organization includes members of the Compton-based Crips street gang, court 
documents say. 
</P>
<P>
According to court documents, Johnson allegedly established the organization in 
1983 and extended its business nationwide to include major cities such as 
Washington, Detroit, Honolulu and Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, according to information provided by an unnamed federal informant, 
owns many commercial and rental properties in California, among them a 
construction company, an auto body shop and a liquor store. According to court 
papers, the informant also said Johnson owns a ranch in San Bernardino and that 
he once manufactured PCP there. 
</P>
<P>
According to an affidavit filed by Drug Enforcement Administration Agent 
Phillip E. Jefferson, Johnson laundered money, allegedly with the assistance of 
an individual who operates a real estate company that Johnson owns, by 
purchasing, renovating and reselling residential properties. 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit says that Johnson told the informant that he would receive 
multikilogram shipments of cocaine from Colombian suppliers in Texas and would 
then arrange to have those delivered to other cities. 
</P>
<P>
The informant, according to the affidavit, also claims to have been present at 
an apartment in Carson when Johnson and others suspected of being members of 
the organization received a package of several million dollars in cash from 
local drug distributors. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted of the drug trafficking and conspiracy charges, the four men could 
face maximum terms of life in prison without possibility of parole, authorities 
said.

In a letter circulated to other water districts in Orange County, municipal 
district officials said they are "vehemently opposed to (the) proposal of more 
fees for water quality and quantity activities" and urged other county water 
districts to write letters of opposition to legislators. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to get the word out," said Stanley E. Sprague, general manager of 
the district, one of two wholesalers of water in Orange County. "We are going 
to get nailed arbitrarily. It just is not a good deal." 
</P>
<P>
As part of a proposal on widespread cuts to balance the state's $55-billion 
budget by July 1, the Deukmejian Administration has suggested that, among other 
things, the state Water Resources Control Board be financed almost entirely 
with regulatory fees, which would be charged to local water districts, then 
passed on to customers, Sprague said. 
</P>
<P>
Programs that deal with water rights and water quality -- including stream, 
lake and wetlands research -- would be paid for through the fee system rather 
than the state budget. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, under the proposal, Anaheim would pay up to $325,000 a year to 
support such programs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Municipal Water District's call for support was being circulated as 
Deukmejian formally released his seven pages of budget cuts, aimed at saving 
the state more than $3.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
With the fees, the state could save about $38 million from the general fund, 
said Connie Barker, director of government relations for the Sacramento-based 
Assn. of California Water Agencies. 
</P>
<P>
But, Barker said, some believe that the fees amount to a tax increase that 
would eventually reach into the pockets of water customers. 
</P>
<P>
Barker said her group had been surprised by the proposal. The group began 
notifying its members June 21 in a three-page letter that said the proposal 
"amounts to bailing out of the state's general fund by making local agencies 
provide the bailout money." 
</P>
<P>
"Such a bailout approach is not appropriate," the letter stated. 
</P>
<P>
Water officials said they are particularly dismayed that the issue bubbled up 
less than a week before the budget is to be up for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
Sprague said legislators will be tempted to pass the proposal because they have 
no time to study its long-term effect on water programs and users throughout 
the state, who would pay more money despite efforts to conserve water in the 
Southland's 4-year-old drought. 
</P>
<P>
Legislators "need money real quick," Sprague said, referring to the budget 
crisis the state is in. "They will not have the luxury of time."

SEN. GREEN'S GRANDDAUGHTER, 2 OTHERS HELD IN NORWALK GUNFIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK HOLGUIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The granddaughter of state Sen. Cecil N. Green (D-Norwalk) was arrested with 
two other juveniles after they allegedly threatened to shoot a youth on a 
bicycle in Norwalk and fired two shotgun blasts at a house in gang-related 
incidents. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies declined to identify the three juveniles arrested and booked 
early Tuesday on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon and grand theft 
auto. No one was reported injured. 
</P>
<P>
But Green, whose district includes part of Orange County, acknowledged that his 
16-year-old granddaughter was arrested early Tuesday morning as a "passenger in 
a car that was used in a drive-by shooting." 
</P>
<P>
He said he had no other details but added: "If she has done something wrong, 
then she should face what happens to her." 
</P>
<P>
Green recently introduced several pieces of anti-gang and anti-drug legislation 
in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies arrested a boy and two girls in a stolen car at 1:30 a.m. 
Tuesday in Norwalk, Sgt. Steve Biagini said. A fourth person, a boy, escaped. A 
shotgun was recovered, the sergeant said. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before 1 a.m., the four allegedly fired a shotgun twice as they drove 
by the house of a rival gang member in Norwalk, he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 minutes later, "they drove up next to a guy on a bicycle, and they 
yelled out of the car some gang words," Biagini said. "They asked the guy where 
he was from." 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager escaped on his bicycle as one of the other juveniles pulled out a 
shotgun, he said. Biagini said he could release no other information about the 
detention of the juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
Green said that as far as he knew, his granddaughter had not been involved in 
gangs. But he said his daughter and her two children moved from Norwalk to 
Sacramento a year ago because "they wanted to make a move to change environment 
and to change jobs." 
</P>
<P>
The granddaughter had been visiting in Norwalk when she was arrested, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the big problems. Gangs and narcotics are going hand in hand," 
said Green, a former Norwalk councilman. "It hits almost all families and 
areas, including my own." 
</P>
<P>
The arrest came four days after gunmen shot a youth to death and wounded nine 
others in a gang-related incident at a Norwalk graduation party. Sheriff's 
deputies have stepped up patrols in the area since that shooting.

HANFORD CITY MANAGER QUITTING TO ACCEPT NO. 2 JOB IN ANAHEIM

<TEXT>
<P>
City Manager Jim Armstrong is leaving his post to become assistant city manager 
in Anaheim. He is the third Kings County city manager to move to larger cities 
in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong, who has managed the city of 29,000 residents for seven years, will 
resign effective July 20, he announced on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
He said the move to Anaheim, which has 240,000 residents and a budget of about 
$550 million, is a wonderful career opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong is following the lead of former Corcoran City Manager George Lambert, 
who left for Norco in Riverside County in May, and former Avenal City Manager 
Steve Casey, who accepted a job in Crescent City earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the recent moves, Lemoore City Manager Allen Goodman wants to 
put to rest any speculation that he might follow his colleagues to bigger 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm staying," he said.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
ATHLETICS FALL TO TIGERS, 5-4, AND OUT OF FIRST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Though falling into second place isn't all that bad, the Oakland Athletics 
might be wondering when they are going to get some production out of the 
highest-paid player in the game. 
</P>
<P>
In a 5-4 loss to the Detroit Tigers Wednesday at Oakland that dropped the 
Athletics .004 behind the Chicago White Sox in the American League West, Jose 
Canseco left after two innings complaining of a sore right wrist. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco, who was on the disabled list because of a lower back injury, is 0 for 
9 since returning and has struck out five times. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco was hit on the wrist by Chicago's Jack McDowell last weekend. The A's 
say his status is day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland's Mark McGwire hit his 20th homer and Dave Henderson hit his 13th. For 
the second time in the last week, Henderson missed pulling out a victory with a 
long out to end the game. Mike Heath had put the Tigers ahead, 5-4, in the 
ninth inning with a home run off reliever Todd Burns. 
</P>
<P>
"We were fortunate," Tiger Manager Sparky Anderson said. "That last drive of 
Henderson's got caught up in the wind and stayed in. 
</P>
<P>
"Oakland's a great team, but they're all right-handed. If you are a 
right-hander and you throw hard and have a hard-breaking ball, you can beat 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Boston 9, Toronto 5 -- Mike Boddicker is about baseball's hottest pitcher, but 
two months ago the Red Sox veteran was wondering if he would ever win again. 
</P>
<P>
After winning his first start of the season Boddicker had lost three games in a 
row, giving up 12 runs in 14 innings. His mechanics were, in his words, all 
fouled up. 
</P>
<P>
He really didn't need to worry. When he pitched seven innings of the Red Sox's 
victory over Toronto in a rain-delayed game at Boston, Boddicker won his ninth 
in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Starting with seven shutout innings in a victory over Seattle, the 33-year-old 
right-hander has been unbeatable. 
</P>
<P>
His ninth consecutive victory improved his record to 10-3 and the Red Sox, 
after winning three in a row over the Blue Jays, lead the American League East 
by 2 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
There was a 1-hour 40-minute delay before the start of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Boddicker gave up nine hits and all five Toronto runs. One of the hits was a 
two-run home run by Kelly Gruber. 
</P>
<P>
When Boddicker lost three in a row, the Red Sox were shut out twice and scored 
only one run in the other. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox broke it open with six runs in the fifth inning. Tom Brunansky hit 
a one-out flyball to right that Junior Felix misplayed into a triple. It opened 
the gates and made a loser of Jimmy Key (4-3). In six previous starts at Fenway 
Park, Key was 4-0 with an ERA of 1.84, rather surprising for a left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still winning," Boddicker said. "And I'm grateful for that. But actually, 
I have not been pitching that well lately. 
</P>
<P>
"What has happened is that either the hitters or the relief pitchers have 
bailed me out." 
</P>
<P>
Before the sweep, the Blue Jays had won 15 in a row in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 9, Minnesota 2 -- Nolan Ryan moves steadily toward his goal of 300 
victories. Apparently recovered from a stress fracture in his lower back, he 
earned his 296th victory. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, 43, gave up six hits and a run in seven innings at Minneapolis to improve 
to 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
In his last four outings, which include his sixth no-hitter, he has given up 
only six earned runs. 
</P>
<P>
Although he only struck out three Twins, Ryan needs three more strikeouts to 
reach 100 for the 22nd season. It would break a tie with Don Sutton. 
</P>
<P>
Julio Franco snapped a two-for-22 slump in five games without a run batted in. 
He went three for four and drove in four runs. 
</P>
<P>
Ruben Sierra was back in the Ranger lineup. He tripled in the second inning for 
his first hit in 14 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 5, New York 4 -- Dave Parker singled in the second inning at New York 
to reach the 2,500-hit plateau. He had two more singles, one of them coming 
before Rob Deer hit his 13th home run to give the Brewers a 5-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Don Mattingly singled with two out and the bases loaded in the ninth to cut the 
lead to a run, but Matt Nokes grounded to second to end the game and give Chuck 
Crim his sixth save. 
</P>
<P>
Mattingly, who has not hit a home run in 33 games, had two singles. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 6, Cleveland 3 -- Chris Hoiles hit his first major league home run 
with two on in the 10th inning at Baltimore to give the Orioles the victory. 
</P>
<P>
The home run, Hoiles' fourth hit in 26 at-bats in the majors, was the first hit 
for the Orioles since the second inning and made a winner of Gregg Olson (4-2). 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles had five hits and three runs in the first two innings. Tim Hulett 
and Mike Devereaux hit home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 3, Kansas City 2 -- The Royals stayed out of the cellar for 24 hours. 
Rookie Jeff Schaefer's run-scoring single in the eighth inning at Seattle broke 
a tie and the Royals dropped below Texas again. 
</P>
<P>
Edgar Martinez drew a walk from Mark Davis (1-4) and Tracy Jones had his third 
hit to set the stage for Schaefer. DAN HAFNER

SANDBERG'S TWO HOME RUNS POWER THE CUBS TO A 5-3 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER

<TEXT>
<P>
The Chicago Cubs' Ryne Sandberg has been recognized as a star for years. He is 
a Gold Glove second baseman, a durable player and a career .290 hitter. 
</P>
<P>
But not until midseason last year was Sandberg thought of as a home run hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Even though his home park is Wrigley Field, probably the best home run park in 
the majors, Sandberg never hit more than 24 home runs in a season until last 
year when he had 30 home runs, 19 after the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
Sandberg, the surprise home run leader of the National League, hit two more 
Wednesday at Chicago to lead the Cubs to a 5-3 victory over the Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
With 24 home runs and 52 runs batted in, Sandberg has had an outstanding season 
and it isn't even the midway point yet. 
</P>
<P>
In his last 29 games, Sandberg has batted .422 with 17 home runs and 29 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Sandberg, 30, hit a home run off Kevin Gross (8-5) in the first inning and 
another off reliever Bill Sampen in the seventh. Gross, who gave up eight hits 
and four runs in the first two innings, broke his finger fouling off a pitch in 
the fifth inning and will be out two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Don Zimmer of the Cubs has watched some pretty good hitters in his day, 
including Roy Campanella, Duke Snider and Carl Yastrzemski, but he is ecstatic 
about Sandberg. "It would be tough to match what this guy is doing right now," 
he said. "That ball coming up to the plate looks like a watermelon these days." 
</P>
<P>
Sandberg has a simple explanation of why he has been hitting so many home runs. 
"In the first place, I feel comfortable at the plate," he said. "But most 
important, I no longer swing at balls. I'm only swinging at strikes." 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 8, Cincinnati 3 -- Matt Williams, whose error on a sacrifice bunt 
gave the Reds the victory Tuesday night, made amends at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants' third baseman hit his 15th home run and drove in four runs. Don 
Robinson (3-1) pitching on two days rest, held the Reds to four hits in eight 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 5, Philadelphia 3 -- Switch-hitting rookie Orlando Merced, called up 
just before the game at Pittsburgh, hit a pinch single in his debut and scored 
the go-ahead run in the seventh on Wally Backman's two-out double. 
</P>
<P>
Merced is the Puerto Rican youngster introduced by sons of the late Roberto 
Clemente to a Pirate scout. 
</P>
<P>
New York 5, St. Louis 2 -- Frank Viola became the league's first 11-game 
winner, Darryl Strawberry extended his hitting streak to 16 games and the Mets 
extended their winning streak to nine games in this game at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets have won 16 of their last 18 games, are 5-0 against the slumping 
Cardinals and 19-7 since Bud Harrelson became manager. 
</P>
<P>
Viola (11-3) pitched a four-hitter and kept the Mets two games behind 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 9, San Diego 1 -- Glenn Wilson drove in three runs at Houston and Jim 
Deshaies pitched a strong game to beat the Padres for the first time in four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, who has 17 RBIs in the last 17 games, hit a two-run double in the first 
inning that provided all the runs Deshaies (4-5) needed. DAN HAFNER

NOFFSINGER SEEKS CRA TITLE AT ASCOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Brad Noffsinger missed on his first shot at NASCAR's Winston Cup stock car 
racing, but he can't wait to get another chance. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, his sights are set on winning the California Racing Assn.'s 
final season of sprint car racing at Ascot Park. Noffsinger won the CRA in 1986 
and 1987, which gave him a springboard to Winston Cup racing. 
</P>
<P>
When his bid for rookie of the year fell short in 1988 and he lost his sponsor 
at the end of the season, he came home to resume the sprint car career that 
began when he first raced for his father, Ace Noffsinger. He won nine races 
last season but finished fourth, behind Ron Shuman, Jerry Meyer and Rip 
Williams in CRA standings. 
</P>
<P>
"I might have gone back south to run stock cars again, but the idea of running 
the last season at Ascot kept me home," Noffsinger said. "I love Ascot and I 
felt if this is going to be the last season, I had to be here. I drove my first 
sprint car race in J.C. Agajanian's car around 1980 and Cary Agajanian has been 
very supportive of my stock car effort, so I feel like I can't do enough for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Ascot Park, where the Agajanian family has been promoting races almost 
continuously since 1957, will close after the Turkey Night midget race in 
November to make way for an industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
At the halfway mark of the CRA season, Noffsinger's win last Saturday night 
pulled him within 57 points of leader John Redican, 2,165-2,105. Defending 
champion Shuman is fourth, 110 points back of Noffsinger, with Williams third. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny racing against Redican," Noffsinger said. "He used to race for my 
dad, and in those days I was a kid who swept out the floors at my dad's shop in 
Cypress. We're still good friends of the Redican family, but it seems funny 
being out there racing for the lead with John. 
</P>
<P>
"John is amazing. He says he's only 45, but he's sure been around a long time. 
He drove seven years for my dad and only won one race. This year, though, he's 
driving like he's younger and tougher than ever." 
</P>
<P>
Redican has won seven CRA main events this season. The only other 
multiple-winners are Noffsinger with four, Shuman and Lealand McSpadden with 
three and Brent Kaeding with two. 
</P>
<P>
This week could create a good deal of movement among the leaders as the CRA 
will conduct a 30-lap main event Saturday night and the 50-lap Firecracker 50 
on Tuesday night, both at Ascot Park. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference between winning at 30 laps and winning at 50 is driver 
conditioning," Noffsinger said. "And I think the advantage is all mine because 
most of the other guys up front are much older than me." 
</P>
<P>
Noffsinger is 29, Shuman 37, Redican and McSpadden 45. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Noffsinger finished third behind Ken Bouchard and Ernie Irvan in 
Winston Cup rookie of the year standings, but he was much more of a rookie than 
the other two. 
</P>
<P>
"I had never driven on asphalt anywhere until the end of the '87 season when I 
drove at Mesa Marin. When some of the guys there were invited to race in 
Australia, I went along and it was the first time I'd ever seen a 
superspeedway. 
</P>
<P>
"I was set to run the CRA again when Mike Curb gave me a call in April and 
asked if I'd like to test his stock car. He said he was looking for a driver to 
replace Ed Pimm." 
</P>
<P>
Noffsinger finished 14th in his first race. It was his highest finish of the 17 
races he made. Both Bouchard, who has since also quit Winston Cup racing, and 
Irvan were graduates of NASCAR short-track asphalt racing. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't wait to try it again, mainly because the people down there are so 
helpful. Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt couldn't seem to do enough for me, 
telling me how to drive the different tracks and how to set up my car. Benny 
Parsons couldn't fit in my car, but he'd drive me around the tracks in a pickup 
truck and tell me what to do and where to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"Every track I went to, it was the first time I'd even seen it. Next time I'll 
feel a lot more comfortable. If I can't put together a package for Winston Cup 
-- and that can mean as much as $1.5 or $2 million for a serious effort -- I'll 
definitely try to do the Winston West series. and get as many miles in as I 
can. After all, if Dick Trickle can make rookie of the year at 48 (as he did in 
1989), I needn't hurry." 
</P>
<P>
STOCK CARS -- The Winston West series, with Bill Sedgwick of Van Nuys the 
points leader, will be in Portland this weekend. Derrike Cope, the Daytona 500 
winner who got his start in the West Coast series, will drive a Chevrolet in 
the 100-mile race Sunday at Portland Speedway. Cope won his first race there in 
1984 and won again in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Special Fourth of July programs are scheduled at Ascot Park and Saugus Speedway 
next Wednesday night. NASCAR Winston Racing Series pro stocks will run at 
Ascot, with Saugus featuring hobby stocks. Both will have a demolition derby 
and fireworks. . . . Sportsman drivers will hold their usual Saturday night 
program at Saugus, along with hobby stocks and jalopies. . . . A 150-lap 
international enduro for foreign and domestic compacts will fill Ascot's track 
on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
The NASCAR Southwest Tour will be at Mesa Marin Raceway on Saturday night for 
the Wrangler Jeans 100 with the pack looking for a way to stop Doug George of 
Atwater, who won his second consecutive race in a Ford last Saturday night at 
the Orange Show Speedway in San Bernardino. George, 29, had not won a race in 
five years before breaking through at Sears Point three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Maria Speedway will hold a 250-lap factory stock enduro Saturday night. . 
. . Also scheduled are sportsman cars Saturday night at Cajon Speedway and a 
50-lap main event for street stocks Friday night at Ventura Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
MOTOCROSS -- With the stadium Supercross season over and the national 500cc 
series not starting for more than a month, most of the nation's leading riders 
will be at Mammoth Mountain this weekend for the year's biggest non-points 
races. Jeff Stanton, who won his second consecutive Supercross championship and 
its $50,000 Camel bonus with a sixth-place finish last Saturday night in the 
Coliseum, is entered, as is France's Jean-Michel Bayle, the world 250cc 
champion who lost the Coliseum race by inches to 17-year-old Damon Bradshaw in 
a dramatic finish that saw Bradshaw half off his bike as he fought to reach the

ORANGE'S CAMPBELL SAYS CAR CRASH WON'T GET IN THE WAY OF HIS PROMISE 
</P>

<P>
Three weeks ago, Gregg Campbell of Orange High School wasn't sure if he could 
keep his promise to his father that he would help the North team win the 31st 
Orange County football all-star game. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Campbell had injured his right knee in a car accident and was 
questionable for the game. 
</P>
<P>
But Wednesday, after 25 stitches and three weeks of rehabilitation, Campbell 
pronounced himself ready to play in the game, scheduled for 7:30 p.m. July 6 at 
LeBard Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"I've dreamed of playing in this game for 14 years and there was no way I was 
going to miss it," said Campbell, a 6-foot-4, 190-pound defensive back. "I had 
to play." 
</P>
<P>
It was 14 years ago that Campbell's father, Dick, then a coach at Garden Grove, 
coached the North in a losing effort. Campbell told his father he would "get 
some revenge" this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't remember much from that game," the younger Campbell said. "I was only 
4 or 5 years old. All I remember was my dad losing." 
</P>
<P>
He also has some painful memories about his knee. 
</P>
<P>
"I still can't go full out on my knee," said Campbell, who wears an elastic 
brace on it. "I sprained it in a game against Costa Mesa last season and I've 
been wearing the brace since then." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell also suffered several cuts on the same knee during the accident. He 
was riding in a friend's car when "another car hit our car by the trunk and we 
spun around." 
</P>
<P>
His knee rammed into the emergency flasher box under the dashboard and was 
sliced open. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a nice concussion out of it too," Campbell said, "but I'm OK now." 
</P>
<P>
That comes as a relief to North Coach Tom Meiss, who also was Campbell's coach 
at Orange. 
</P>
<P>
"He's starting to come around now," Meiss said. "We need him to direct traffic 
in our secondary." 
</P>
<P>
It's midway through the second week of practice and Meiss is still shuffling 
his lineup. 
</P>
<P>
He added three players to the North roster Wednesday -- defensive back Mark 
Flatten of Pacifica, running back Jeff Besinaiz of La Habra and Esperanza 
linebacker Mark Kinney. 
</P>
<P>
They replace Anaheim linebacker Ernie Akau, Savanna running back Kenison 
PoChing and Valencia lineman Jose Castillo, who have decided not to play, Meiss 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Servite offensive lineman Jose Salazar was added to the roster last week, 
replacing Paul Jaramillo of Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately we haven't lost a lot of offensive people," Meiss said. "Most of 
our replacements have been defensive. Offense is all performance and defense is 
all reaction." 
</P>
<P>
Although temperatures have hovered in the 90s and 100s the last two days, Meiss 
said the heat hasn't bothered the players and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not working them that hard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meiss said Los Alamitos running back Erik Mitchell has been so impressive in 
practice that he has earned a starting role . . . at cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
"Erik said he was interested in trying it and he'll start there," Meiss said. 
"He and (Loara's Coy) Collins will start at running back too. 
</P>
<P>
"Mitchell looks to be a very good corner. He has always taken a lick, now he 
has a chance to give one." 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos quarterback Todd Gragnano also is expected to start, Meiss said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been throwing the ball well to (Los Alamitos' Chad) Millan," Meiss said. 
"They're a good one-two combination." 
</P>
<P>
Meiss has scheduled a variety of activities for the players in the next week, 
including a trip to a children's hospital and a talent show, in which each 
player will be required to perform. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them they at least had to get up and tell a joke," Meiss said. 
</P>
<P>
The early favorite to win the talent show? Fullerton High quarterback Rene 
Arias. 
</P>
<P>
"Rene's the comedian of the group," Orange's Campbell said. "That guy's talking 
constantly." 
</P>
<P>
The North also has planned a pizza party at Meiss' house. The coach, who wants 
to toughen up his players, promised them toppings that include "bailing wire, 
nails and mozzarella." 
</P>
<P>
Meiss was an assistant coach with the winning South team in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"I took notes," he said. "I thought about what I would do differently if I was 
the (head) coach someday. We're spending more time in front of the chalkboard 
this year. We want to explain more to them so they have a good understanding of 
what they're doing out there." 
</P>
<P>
Meiss has not scheduled a scrimmage, but the South team will have one at 10 
a.m. Saturday at Edison High School.

KARCHER KEEPS ARIZONA BRANCHES IN FAMILY 
</P>

<P>
Carl Karcher Enterprises, which had announced that it would sell or close its 
40 Carl's Jr. restaurants in Arizona, has found a way to keep things in the 
family. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Karcher, youngest brother of the chain's founder, said Wednesday that he 
has bought the franchise rights for a dozen of the Tucson outlets. He will step 
down as vice president of franchising for Carl Karcher Enterprises, a position 
he has held for the last five years, to run the Tucson operation. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase price and financing details were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
In April, Karcher Enterprises acknowledged that it had lost $5 million in 
Arizona during the previous year and announced a plan to convert its outlets 
there into franchises or to close them. Seven restaurants in greater Phoenix 
and two restaurants in Tucson were closed, said Patricia Parks, a company 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Another 19 restaurants were sold as franchises to former Karcher employees in 
May. Frank Karcher's purchase of the dozen outlets in Tucson completes the 
restructuring, Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
Karcher said he hopes that on-scene management and community involvement will 
turn business around. He plans, for example, to sponsor school athletics and 
achievement awards and to offer support for senior citizens' events. 
</P>
<P>
He also wants to open five or six more outlets within the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
It costs $800,000 to $1 million to start an outlet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Christopher, a food industry analyst for Crowell, Weedon &amp; Co. in 
Los Angeles, said the independence of a franchise could help Carl's Jr. compete 
in the Tucson market. Because of the area's weak economy, the market is highly 
competitive and price sensitive, and requires close surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
"They are selling to an operator who can operate in that market," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Karcher, who started with Karcher Enterprises 35 years ago as a cook, worked in 
Tucson when the company opened its first outlets in the state in 1983. He is 
one of four brothers in the business; the others are Carl, who is chairman and 
chief executive; Donald, president, and Bernard, who operates another 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Carl's sons, Joe and Carl Leo, also run franchises, Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 550 Carl's Jr. outlets -- owned, operated, franchised or licensed by 
Karcher Enterprises -- are in California, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Karcher said he and his wife, Luci, have moved to Tucson with two sons, 
who are planning to work with the franchise. He said their enthusiasm for the 
new venture was not smothered by Tucson temperatures, which have reached 118 
degrees this week.

A New Direction: Ventana Growth Funds, an Irvine venture capital fund, is 
deviating from the traditional investments in new or very young firms with a 
new fund aimed at providing expansion capital for later-stage, medium-size 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Ventana has raised $15 million in the first phase of a planned $50-million 
partnership fund that will help companies planning to add manufacturing 
facilities in Mexico under the maquiladora program, said Thomas O. Gephart, a 
managing partner. 
</P>
<P>
The maquiladora program allows U.S. or multinational firms to establish a 
manufacturing plant in Mexico for labor-intensive processing or assembly.

Beach Savings Bank in Fountain Valley continues to rank among the 
highest-paying and safest financial institutions in the nation, according to a 
national trade periodical. 
</P>
<P>
American Banker lists Beach's 8.85% yield on six-month certificates of deposit 
as the fourth highest in the nation based on a survey by Bank Rate Monitor in 
North Palm Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Among the top five, the small, one-branch thrift was the only one with a 
three-star rating, the highest given by Veribanc Inc., a Wakefield, Mass., firm 
that evaluates financial condition. 
</P>
<P>
With a 9% yield, giant Columbia Savings &amp; Loan ranked first on six-month 
CDs and fourth on one-year CDs, but Columbia's health is in doubt because of 
losses in its huge portfolio of junk bonds.

ARTS CENTER ORCHESTRATES LOVE-IN FOR SEGERSTROM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
As the piano player said, the tributes were so warm they were "radioactive." 
</P>
<P>
The piano player, toast-of-both-coasts Michael Feinstein, stepped on stage at 
the Orange County Performing Arts Center on Friday to give one of those chatty, 
intimate concerts that have earned him the top spot among contemporary 
interpreters of Gershwin-era classics. 
</P>
<P>
But when Feinstein sat down at the Baldwin, he turned his back on 3,000 empty 
seats the color of Cabernet Sauvignon. Instead, he faced 230 of the county's 
business and social big shots -- a black-tie bunch of frequent banqueters come 
to honor Henry Segerstrom. 
</P>
<P>
They ate their gourmet dinners on stage that night, by the light of 12 crystal 
chandeliers. 
</P>
<P>
The gala marked the conclusion of Segerstrom's tenure as chairman of the Center 
board. Held in what could arguably be called The House that Henry Built -- on 
farmland donated by his family -- the party was a low-key love-in from cocktail 
hour to the standing ovation for Feinstein's thematic encore, "That's 
Entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
Guests arrived at the Center's stage door entrance then clicked their expensive 
heels along the route that singers, musicians and road crews follow to the 
backstage. There, in the glow of a few rose-tinted klieg lights, they mingled 
for an hour, sipping wine and mixed drinks in the shadow of three-story stacks 
of lumber and disassembled packing crates. 
</P>
<P>
Once seated at the tables on stage, the arts patrons turned their attention to 
emcee Walter Gerken, who introduced a video montage documenting the Center's 
short history, from bulldozers in the lima bean fields to ball gowns on opening 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Among video testimonials was a thank you from local builder Timothy Strader, 
who said, "If there were an Orange County Hall of Fame, your name would be 
right at the top of the list, Henry." 
</P>
<P>
Dinner began with lima bean soup -- "we could put together a book of lima bean 
recipes," Segerstrom joked -- followed by tossed salad, veal loin stuffed with 
lobster and miniature chocolate pianos filled with fresh berries. 
</P>
<P>
After dinner, Center trustees Floss Schumacher and Robert McIntyre read letters 
of praise from a "tribute book" they had assembled for Segerstrom, and 
encouraged the honoree to file the video seen earlier in the evening "with 
'E.T.' and 'Batman' and 'Back to the Future' -- all the favorites in your video 
library," Schumacher said. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees Kathryn Thompson and Roger Johnson presented Segerstrom and his wife, 
Renee, with cuff links, studs and pin designed by Wyndham Leigh jewelers and 
shaped -- as guests saw when slides of it were flashed on screen -- like the 
Center's grand portal with its Firebird sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Segerstrom was brief. He thanked the group and many of the guests 
by name, and made special note of the support he had received from his family 
-- especially his wife; his mother, Ruth; his cousin Harold Segerstrom and his 
wife, Jeanette; and his children, Anton and Andrea, who attended the event, and 
Toren, who did not. 
</P>
<P>
Recalling his childhood in an Orange County of "maybe 150,000 people," 
Segerstrom said, "I don't think any of us would have dreamed that in our 
lifetimes we would be able to do something like this." 
</P>
<P>
Center board President Thomas Kendrick introduced Feinstein, who played an hour 
of sweet standards -- many selected by Segerstrom himself -- including 
Gershwin's "S' Wonderful," and Irving Berlin's "Alexander's Ragtime Band," and 
"They Say That Falling in Love Is Wonderful," which he dedicated to Henry and 
Renee. 
</P>
<P>
Among guests were Segerstrom's colleagues from the building campaign's board of 
trustees, including Gerken, Thompson, George Argyros, Dr. Arnold Beckman, 
William Lyon, William Lund, Hubie Clark, Frank Lynch, Tom Nielsen, and Charles 
Hester.

CZECH ART IN L.A. . . . FREE AT LAST

When 15 Los Angeles artists traveled to the Czechoslovakian capital of Prague 
for an exhibition of their works there last summer, they worried that the 
government would shut down the show. State police were stationed by the door 
throughout the monthlong run, and their Czechoslovakian curator faced police 
interrogation because of suspicions that the Americans would spout anti-Czech 
propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
Now, 11 Czechoslovakian artists have arrived in Los Angeles for the second part 
of the exchange exhibition, "Dialogue: Prague/L.A.," which is being held in 
various locations throughout the city beginning today. And the very same 
curator who underwent police interrogation a year ago is giving partial credit 
for her country's new-found artistic freedom -- a result of November's 
artist-led revolution -- to that exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
"A kind of back door was already opening (last summer) and somehow we managed 
to sneak our foot in," said Zdenka Gabalova, after arriving on her third trip 
to Los Angeles in as many months. "This exhibition was one of the signals in 
Prague that the situation was (destined) to change. At that time, the 
(Stalinist) authorities were still very much in power, but the society itself 
had started to change. They had kept a lid on the society for 40 years, but the 
grass-root activities -- like this exhibition -- made it come out." 
</P>
<P>
Gabalova and her co-curator, Los Angeles artist Barbara Benish, stressed during 
a recent interview that "Dialogue" -- which includes shows at Otis/Parsons Art 
Gallery, the Santa Monica Museum of Art and the new Arroyo Arts Collective, as 
well as performances, lectures and workshops at Angels Gate Cultural Center, 
Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions and Pasadena's Art Center College of 
Design -- was in the planning stages long before November's revolution. 
</P>
<P>
"I met Zdenka five years ago when taking a trip to Prague," recalled Benish, 
who had been visiting the Czech capital for about 10 years as a tourist. 
"Originally I had hoped to exhibit there myself, and Zdenka had said, 'Sure, it 
could be arranged,' even though it was crazy at the time to think of an 
American exhibiting there. But then as we got to looking at the work (from both 
countries) we realized there were a lot of similarities, which was surprising 
to us. We noticed that the artists both here and in Prague had a lot of the 
same thoughts and concerns. So in 1987 we started really working on what 
blossomed into a full-blown cultural exchange." 
</P>
<P>
The curators first set to work on what they thought would be the most difficult 
end of the exchange -- bringing American artists and works into Prague. Said 
Benish: "Americans had not shown in Prague in 40 years, so we thought if we 
could do that, and bring the American artists into Prague, then we could surely 
get the Czechoslovakian works here, and maybe even some of the artists (none of 
whom had passports at the time)." 
</P>
<P>
But the going was not easy, Benish said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really important that we don't forget the risk that Zdenka -- and all the 
Czech artists -- went through to do this," she said. "They knew that once (the 
Czech government) knew that they were even dealing with Americans, then it 
could be bad for them. But all the Czech artists said, 'Oh sure, we'll do 
this,' and were very enthusiastic even though we had no support and no funding 
and needed to break through a lot of barriers." 
</P>
<P>
But while one of those barriers would seemingly be government approval, 
Gabalova, who admitted that she worried throughout the show that the government 
might close it down, said she purposely had not sought governmental support. 
"We wanted to remain independent," she said. "Had they given us support, they 
would have censored us." 
</P>
<P>
(Officially, the L.A. artists were invited to Prague by the Central Committee 
of the Socialist Union of Youth of Czechoslovakia. Nonetheless, Gabalova said, 
police waited outside the gallery's door throughout the show and plainclothes 
policemen were in the crowd during a public symposium held in conjunction with 
the exhibition.) 
</P>
<P>
Before the revolution, Gabalova, an art critic, had written mainly for 
underground publications and worked as a translator to support herself. When 
asked about the risks she took to mount "Dialogue," she said: "I never thought 
of it like that. And I really don't like to talk about it. It was just police 
interrogation; I wasn't imprisoned. So many people went through things so much 
worse than I did. I don't like to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
True to her assertion, Gabalovawould only say of her "interrogation" that "the 
police were questioning me and asserting that (the Americans) would be used for 
anti-Czech propaganda by bringing in American art, which of course was absurd." 
Gabalova noted that several artists in the show have previously been detained, 
jailed or put on trial by Czechoslovakian authorities because of their artistic 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
"What inspired me (to do this show) was that they were still making art in this 
oppressive scene, without museums, or galleries," Benish noted. "They were 
making this incredibly vital art -- it was without any of the institutional 
support, but they were still doing it. They would put up an exhibition in an 
old barn for a day, and then the police would come and close it down, and then 
they would start again. They just had this incredible strength that we don't 
see very often. They haven't fallen apart because they didn't have that 
institutional support, and I think we, here, could really learn from it." 
Benish added that just as the Los Angeles show is occuring at a critical time 
for the Czech artists, the Prague show also happened at a critical time for the 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"Right when we left to go over there was when the whole Jesse Helms thing was 
just starting," she said. "So it's been very interesting to see the 
developments. It's another irony of this whole show: we've seen the Czech art 
scene open right up and the whole American scene become more and more 
repressive." 
</P>
<P>
Even here in Los Angeles, things have not been easy, Benish noted. Practically 
all of the budget of $130,000 for both shows was raised in Los Angeles -- the 
Czechs were able to pay for only the catalogues and posters in Prague -- and 
most of that came in at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people have just kind of pitched in and said, 'How can we help?' " 
said Benish, who noted that an April fund-raiser at the home of Jane Fonda "put 
us over the hump" in enabling the Czech works to be brought in. (Funders have 
included the Lannan Foundation, New York's New School for Social Research, art 
collectors Eileen and Peter Norton and Marcia Weisman, and artist Ed Moses. The 
U.S. Information Agency also donated a few plane tickets for the 
Czechoslovakian artists "at the very last minute," Benish said.) 
</P>
<P>
Benish noted that she will continue to raise funds -- in an attempt to "pay off 
our debts" -- during the show through the sale of T-shirts, posters and 
catalogues. In addition, a fund-raising auction of works by the American 
artists in the exhibition will be held in Palos Verdes tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The American artists participating in "Dialogue" -- whose works done in 
response to their experiences in Prague will be shown at the Arroyo Arts 
Collective -- are Benish, Kim Abeles, Dawn Arrowsmith, Mark Cervenka, Habib 
Kheradyar, Robert Kingston, Deborah Lawrence, Karl Matson, Leland Means, 
Christian Mounger, Andrea Nadell, Kirk Phillips, Jim Uyekawa, Jeffrey Vallance 
and David Wells. 
</P>
<P>
The Czechoslovakian artists in "Dialogue" are Michal Blazek, Tomas Cisarovsky, 
Stanislav Divis, Ivan Kafka, Vladimir Kokolia, Jan Merta, Vladimir Merta,

NEA HARDENS ITS POSITION ON ANTI-OBSCENITY PLEDGE; 
</P>
<P>
ARTS: SOME CRITICS SAY THAT MAINTAINING THE RESTRICTION MAY MEAN CONTINUED 
REJECTION OF GRANTS BY ANGRY ARTISTS AND GROUPS.

<P>
National Endowment for the Arts will retain a controversial requirement that 
grantees sign an anti-obscenity pledge, despite the rejection, or threatened 
rejection, of more than $1.3 million in 1990 grants. 
</P>
<P>
The NEA and the Justice Department are drafting language to clarify the 
obscenity guidelines, according to Julie Davis, the arts endowment's general 
counsel, but she said the certification -- which some arts groups have called 
the equivalent of an anti-obscenity loyalty oath -- will remain in place for 
the rest of the 1990 fiscal year, which ends in October. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, however, a representative of the New School for Social Research, 
which has sued the NEA to force the rescinding of what critics contend is an 
anti-obscenity oath, said that issuing guidelines without striking the 
anti-obscenity language may not stem a continuing stream of rejection of NEA 
money by enraged artists and arts organizations. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a Senate committee canceled a scheduled Wednesday 
meeting that was to finalize the Senate version of a bill extending the 
legislative authorization of the NEA. The Senate Education and Labor Committee 
now can not take the matter up until at least July 11. 
</P>
<P>
Sources familiar with the situation characterized the cancellation as 
commonplace in the process of editing bills in committee. But these sources 
said the decision to cancel the Wednesday morning session appeared to indicate 
that negotiations among four senators central to the NEA debate were far from 
producing a consensus proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The four senators -- Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts, Claiborne Pell of Rhode 
Island, Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas and Orrin Hatch of Utah -- are attempting to 
fashion a plan on such diverse issues as the wording of an expected restriction 
on the kinds of art the NEA can support, and the length of the extension of the 
endowment's lifetime, expected to be between one and five years. 
</P>
<P>
A source familiar with the Senate negotiations said the talks are intended to 
develop a bipartisan strategy for the NEA reauthorization bill. Kennedy and 
Pell are moderate-to-liberal Democrats, while Kassebaum and Hatch are 
moderate-to-conservative Republicans. Other sources characterized the 
discussions as an attempt to solve the intense NEA political controversy -- 
anticipating expected opposition to any consensus approach by conservatives led 
by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.). 
</P>
<P>
The NEA's Davis made her comments in a Tuesday afternoon interview. It was one 
of the first times a top NEA official has discussed the gravity of protest 
among artists and arts groups that has led to rejection, or threatened 
rejection, of grants by nine individuals or organizations, totaling $272,050. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, UCLA and the University of California system disclosed last week 
that top administrators are considering a proposal -- originated at UCLA -- for 
the entire UC system to boycott NEA funding this year. The UC total could be as 
much as $1.1 million. At least three Southern California arts institutions are 
reported to be actively reviewing their postures on NEA grant acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
"If we want to move toward a common resolution of this very difficult problem, 
reason has to return to the discourse," Davis said. "One of the unfortunate 
developments out of this whole controversy is that common sense has 
evaporated." 
</P>
<P>
Davis made the comments in the wake of the filing of court papers in the New 
School lawsuit in New York that disclosed the NEA intends to issue obscenity 
guidelines, not later than July 13 -- an attempt to clarify controversial 
language inserted by Congress in the endowment's 1990 appropriation bill. The 
language bars federal support for obscene work that does not meet high 
standards for artistic merit. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Davis and NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer included the 
wording of the law in the NEA's form grant letter and began to require grantees 
to sign a certification that they would comply with the obscenity provision. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said, however, that though the guidelines are being drafted, the 
obscenity certification -- which has directly caused the spate of grant 
rejections -- will not be rescinded. "It is my hope that some of the confusion 
that has arisen (over the obscenity certification process) will be settled by 
the issuance of these guidelines," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation including the obscenity wording only applies to 1990, though 
most observers expect conservatives in Congress to push successfully for 
restrictive language at least as strong as 1990's in both the 1991 
appropriation bill and any version of NEA reauthorization that the House and 
Senate may enact. 
</P>
<P>
Davis acknowledged that nearly all applications for 1990 NEA grants have been 
received and processed. But she said issuing the guidelines now -- nearly at 
the end of the endowment's grant-making year -- was undertaken as a result of a 
study of NEA procedures by the U.S. General Accounting Office, the 
investigative arm of Congress. The GAO, acting at the request of Helms, 
reviewed NEA grant-making procedures, exonerating the agency of charges it 
funded obscene work this year, but suggesting several changes in endowment 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
"Those individuals who say their rejection (of grants) is motivated solely by 
inclusion (of the controversy obscenity language) miss the point, I believe," 
David said. "If I were to remove (the certification), the restriction would 
still apply. This prohibition was intended to attach not only to funding 
decisions by the NEA, but it was to follow the federal money once it goes out 
of the endowment's door and is used by the grantees." 
</P>
<P>
However, Davis' assertion was challenged by Floyd Abrams, a prominent New York 
First Amendment lawyer who is representing the New School in its lawsuit 
against the NEA. Abrams contended that Frohnmayer and Davis blundered 
tactically when they decided to require written certification of the obscenity 
language -- a step that, Abrams noted, the National Endowment for the 
Humanities chose not to take. 
</P>
<P>
Both the NEA and the NEH are governed by the same obscenity-control language 
this year. The NEH has largely avoided being drawn into the increasingly 
acrimonious protest movement. Abrams said the New School would probably 
continue its lawsuit as long as the NEA obscenity certification requirement 
remains in place. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview Wednesday, he called the NEA and Justice Department 
efforts to explain the obscenity language "a real step forward." But, Abrams 
said, "What they should come out with is an abolition of a certification 
requirement which was not compelled by Congress and which was imposed only as a 
result of the NEA deciding that it should do so." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
Action on two key bills governing the National Endowment for the Arts resumes 
when Congress returns from its traditional July 4 recess. Leaders of the House 
-- where committee action is complete -- have tentatively scheduled a floor 
vote on a bill to reauthorize the NEA for another five years either on July 12, 
or during the following two weeks. In the Senate, committee action is expected 
to conclude on July 11 or July 18, with a floor vote possible before the end of 
the month, when Congress is scheduled to adjourn until after Labor Day. Because 
the two versions of the bill are expected to be significantly different, a 
conference committee will probably have to be convened to form a consensus -- a 
step not expected until after Labor Day. Separately, action is pending on an 
NEA appropriation bill for the 1991 fiscal year. House leaders expect votes on 
the money measure to follow the reauthorization legislation. In the Senate, no 
decision has been reached on timing of the appropriation bill.

WHO WILL BE THE ULTIMATE WEAPON IN LATE-NIGHT WAR?; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: WHILE ARSENIO HALL GRINS, ABC THROWS RICK DEES INTO THE FRAY AND 
CBS TRIES TO KEEP AFFILIATES FROM JUMPING SHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Television's late-night battleground is about to flare up again with new 
contenders trying to emulate Arsenio Hall's success and fill the gap of Pat 
Sajak's defunct CBS talk show. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles disc jockey Rick Dees enters the arena the week of July 16 with a 
new ABC variety series that will follow Ted Koppel's "Nightline." 
</P>
<P>
CBS, which is holding its annual affiliates meeting today and Friday at the 
Century Plaza, is expected to announce new shows to fill the gap left by the 
Sajak series -- and stem the defection of its stations in the profitable late 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
The fierce competition points up vividly the importance of Johnny Carson and 
David Letterman to NBC, the only securely anchored network around the midnight 
hour and thereafter. Despite the brilliance of "Nightline," it has given ABC 
only 30 minutes of late-night programming. 
</P>
<P>
Hall's impact was felt dramatically when a station in St. Louis, the nation's 
18th biggest TV market, disclosed recently that it is planning to drop 
"Nightline" and replace it with Hall's show. The station said it regretted 
losing "Nightline" but that Hall was hot and ABC would not allow the Koppel 
series to be pushed back 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
While Hall's show runs only one hour, it is being packaged in some markets in 
the future with a 30-minute variety series starring Nia Peeples -- with both 
programs coming out of Paramount, which is handling the sales. 
</P>
<P>
" 'The Arsenio Hall Show' is one of the hottest properties in syndication and 
has the potential to be the late-night franchise going into the future," said 
Wayne Thomas, general manager of the St. Louis station, KTVI, adding that he 
hoped an arrangement could be worked out with ABC to keep "Nightline." 
</P>
<P>
ABC's gamble on Dees is a big one. The network is formidable on almost all 
fronts -- "Good Morning America," daytime programming, Peter Jennings' nightly 
news and prime time -- but it has been unsuccessful for years in trying to find 
a late-night series that could follow "Nightline" and allow ABC to tap into the 
profit center of TV's wee hours. 
</P>
<P>
ABC's best move in this area came several years ago when it tried to lure Larry 
King away from CNN. The idea, says the CNN star, was to have him follow 
"Nightline" so that ABC could boast the tandem of Koppel and King -- in short, 
TV's two top interviewers. But King opted to remain with CNN, as he also did 
recently when CBS approached him to do a late-night series. 
</P>
<P>
So now, for ABC, it's up to the new series "Into the Night Starring Rick Dees" 
-- a seemingly unlikely, incompatible pairing with the distinguished Koppel. 
</P>
<P>
But Hall, who has clearly energized late-night, apparently has encouraged the 
belief that it is open to freshness and that anything is possible. And summer 
seems a logical time for ABC to give Dees a shot. 
</P>
<P>
The situation at CBS is far more dire. Last in prime time, last with "CBS This 
Morning," no longer first with Dan Rather's nightly news, the network finds 
some solace from good ratings with its daytime shows, but even there its young 
female demographics are not as good as ABC's. And now the void left by the 
Sajak show leaves CBS with another major problem to solve. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, CBS filled the slot nicely by rerunning multipart stories from an 
admired crime series, "Wiseguy." But it was a stopgap measure that predictably 
brought CBS station-clearance headaches from its affiliates, some of whom also 
pushed the late-hour lineup even further back into the night. 
</P>
<P>
Now the network must find something more permanent, and among the reported 
entries for its late-night future are a series from producer Norman Lear, 
several action-adventure programs and, starting next month, a group of 
talk-show hosts trying out to see who does best. Lear was behind two memorable 
late-night comedies, "Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman" and "Fernwood 2-Night." 
</P>
<P>
A winning late-night lineup is critical to TV stations because it provides an 
attractive "lead-out" to news programs -- meaning, for instance, that viewers 
may tune in an 11 p.m. newscast on KNBC Channel 4 knowing that Carson will 
follow. Or they may watch the 11 p.m. news on KABC Channel 7 while waiting for 
Koppel's "Nightline." 
</P>
<P>
Since local news is a primary image of most TV stations and a chief source of 
their income, the late-night lineups that follow impact heavily on their 
revenues. At KTVI in St. Louis, general manager Thomas said that acquiring 
Arsenio Hall would "help our news audience." 
</P>
<P>
Thus CBS' highest priorities these days -- besides developing a winning 
prime-time schedule -- include building a solid late-night program block to 
secure its relationship with its affiliates, who are the backbone of a network. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, Hall, though syndicated, has a much stronger late-night presence 
than CBS. ABC's Koppel is also stronger. And NBC's team of Carson, Letterman 
and all-pro "Tonight" sub Jay Leno takes on special meaning as a uniquely 
dependable area of programming for the network's member stations.

CLIPPERS GO WITH KIMBLE; 
</P>
<P>
NBA DRAFT: DERRICK COLEMAN, AS EXPECTED, IS NO. 1 OVERALL WITH NETS. CLIPPERS 
ALSO GRAB MICHIGAN'S VAUGHT WITH 13TH PICK.

<P>
The Clippers got their man Wednesday in the NBA draft when they selected Loyola 
Marymount guard Bo Kimble with the eighth choice. 
</P>
<P>
That came after the New Jersey Nets had made Derrick Coleman of Syracuse the 
top pick and the draft took on a shooter's look. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no one happier right now than I am," Kimble said. "It's a young team, 
up and coming, and it's a perfect situation for me." 
</P>
<P>
As a senior, Kimble proved he was fully recovered from knee surgery, leading 
the nation in scoring with 35.3 points and taking the Lions to the West 
Regional final before losing to eventual NCAA champion Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble shot 52.9% from the field and 46% from three-point range as a senior and 
showed he was a solid rebounder with 7.7 per game, earning second-team 
All-American honors. He also won the inaugural One-On-One Challenge this week. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers were to pick 27th, the last pick in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman, a 6-10, 235-pound All-American forward, was the all-time leading 
rebounder in collegiate history and Syracuse's all-time leading scorer with 
2,143 points. He was a starter for four years for the Orangemen and was 
considered by most experts the best NBA prospect. 
</P>
<P>
With Coleman taken, big men became a scarce commodity. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle took 6-3 Oregon State point guard Gary Payton and Denver followed with 
LSU's 6-1 Chris Jackson, a 29-point scorer in his two years in college. Not 
since Detroit took Isiah Thomas with the No. 2 pick in 1981 has a guard been 
taken as high as Payton. 
</P>
<P>
Then came 6-7 Dennis Scott of Georgia Tech, an outstanding perimeter shooter 
who was taken by Orlando, and 6-5 guard Kendall Gill of Illinois, selected by 
Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
The string of shooters was broken when Minnesota selected 7-0 Felton Spencer of 
Louisville and the Sacramento Kings grabbed 6-7 player of the year Lionel 
Simmons of La Salle with the first of their record four first-round picks. 
</P>
<P>
Then came three more players slated to play guard in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble was next. Then Willie Burton, a 6-7 forward at Minnesota, was grabbed by 
Miami, which acquired the ninth and 15th picks from Denver in exchange for the 
No. 3 selection. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta, which had switched first-round picks with Golden State earlier in the 
day, then took Michigan point guard Rumeal Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson was the first of three Michigan players taken in the first round, 
matching the most ever from one college team in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Loy Vaught was selected by the Clippers with the 13th pick and forward 
Terry Mills was Milwaukee's selection at No. 16. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana had three players taken in the first round after its undefeated 
national championship season in 1976 -- Scott May, Bobby Wilkerson and Quinn 
Buckner. UCLA matched that in 1979 when David Greenwood, Roy Hamilton and Brad 
Holland were chosen in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Controversial center Dwayne Schintzius of Florida, considered by some to be a 
top 10 pick, fell all the way to No. 24 with San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
The Nets, whose 17-65 record was the worst in the NBA last season, haven't had 
a first-rate first-round selection since Sleepy Floyd in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, they have taken Jeff Turner, Pearl Washington, Dennis Hopson, Chris 
Morris and Mookie Blaylock. Only the last two, Morris and Blaylock, are still 
with the team. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman was considered the top prospect in the draft, but questions about his 
attitude left some doubt the Nets would take him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a warm, loving kind of guy," Coleman said. "I think most guys from the 
inner city get a bad rep. At Syracuse, a lot was blown out of proportion." 
</P>
<P>
Coleman said he expects to be a starter. 
</P>
<P>
"They need a couple of players to help them out," Coleman said of the Nets. 
"Hopefully, I'm one of those." 
</P>
<P>
Payton was thrilled to be taken by the SuperSonics. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to stay on the West Coast and help Seattle out," he said. "They 
needed a leader and I think they got one. They have so many premier players who 
can score. I think I can get them the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson and Gill, however, were not as happy. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll have to get used to the altitude," said Jackson, who joins 5-11 Michael 
Adams in Denver's backcourt. "I think it'll be fun (playing with him). We'll be 
very quick." 
</P>
<P>
"Our overall objective was to get a young, aggressive scorer around whom we 
could build a team," Nugget managing partner Peter Bynoe said. "The way to do 
that is with big men or point guards. We saw no big men in the middle but we 
did see some quality point guards. We think Chris is going to be a Denver 
Nugget for a long time to come. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the person we focused on from the beginning. He's the reason we traded 
up." 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, I had to go to Charlotte," Gill said. "At least it's the only 
show in town." 
</P>
<P>
The second 10 selections in the first round were 6-10 forward Tyrone Hill of 
Xavier, Ohio, by Golden State; 6-11 forward Alec Kessler of Georgia by Houston; 
Vaught by the Clippers; 6-2 guard Travis Mays of Texas by Sacramento; 6-5 guard 
Dave Jamerson of Ohio University by Miami; Mills by Milwaukee; 6-10 Jerrod 
Mustaf of Maryland by New York; 7-foot center Duane Causwell of Temple by 
Sacramento; 6-1 point guard Dee Brown of Jacksonville by Boston; and Minnesota 
took Gerald Glass of Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix took Jayson Williams with the No. 21 pick, followed by New Jersey (Tate 
George), Sacramento (Anthony Bonner) and Schintzius.

SCHINTZIUS PAYS A HEAVY PRICE; 
</P>
<P>
OVERALL: FLORIDA CENTER, AMONG THE MOST TALENTED PLAYERS IN THE DRAFT, LASTS 
UNTIL SPURS MAKE HIM THE NO. 24 CHOICE. AS EXPECTED, COLEMAN IS NO. 1 PICK.

<P>
This is what's known as balloon payments, NBA style. Gain weight, lose money. 
</P>
<P>
Dwayne Schintzius experienced it Wednesday. His wallet will be feeling it for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most talented players in the NBA draft -- not to mention a big man, 
always the top commodity -- teams proved that fears over Schintzius were not 
merely conjecture. It became reality when the 7-foot-1, guess-the-weight center 
went into a free fall through the first round before the San Antonio Spurs 
picked him at No. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Even that was a surprise. Most figured the gamble would come from someone 
picking in the teens, teams such as Golden State or Milwaukee in desperate need 
of size. Instead, the Warriors went with Tyrone Hill of Xavier and the Bucks 
with Terry Mills of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
So why didn't San Antonio fans feel as if they got a bargain? 
</P>
<P>
Schintzius' selection was booed by many of the 6,000 watching the proceedings 
at HemisFair Arena. To them he pledged a mature person, not one who showed up 
at an important pre-draft evaluation camp at 292 pounds, about 30 over his 
playing weight at the University of Florida. That was, of course, before he 
quit the Gators after 11 games and the last of several run-ins with team 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to come down, and I hope the people will give me a chance to 
develop as a player," he said. "I'm ready to go. You don't realize how much I 
love playing the game of basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had completed my senior year, I would have been up there. People were 
scared to take a chance. I have no doubt about my attitude or ability. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be upset. I think it worked out for the best." 
</P>
<P>
He couldn't have been thinking money. Schintzius could have been the No. 1 
selection, getting a multimillion dollar deal in the process. Now, he's in the 
$250,000-a-year range. A contract holdout based on potential wouldn't be wise 
either. The Spurs are kind of set at center (see: Robinson, David). 
</P>
<P>
Four centers were picked before Schintzius, and that doesn't include Hill, 6-10 
but regarded as a forward. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's perfect for our team," Coach Larry Brown said. "I think he'll 
help David and Terry (Cummings)." 
</P>
<P>
If the Spurs got a potential franchise player, Sacramento, kings of the 
pre-draft trading frenzy, picked an entire starting lineup: Forwards Lionel 
Simmons of La Salle (No. 7) and Anthony Bonner of St. Louis (No. 23), guards 
Travis Mays of Texas (No. 14) and Bimbo Coles of Virginia Tech (No. 40), and 
center Duane Causwell of Temple (No. 18). The Kings later traded Coles' rights 
to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not talking Michael Jordan, but we feel very comfortable with them," 
said Jerry Reynolds, the team's director of player personnel. "I would be 
surprised if all four aren't in the NBA six or seven years from now." 
</P>
<P>
Simmons was an obvious pick after the Kings traded Rodney McCray, last year's 
starting small forward, to Dallas. That Mays, who could have been a top-eight 
selection, was still around at No. 14 proved the depth this draft had at guard, 
if little else. 
</P>
<P>
Three guards went in the first five picks -- Gary Payton of Oregon State second 
to Seattle, Chris Jackson of Louisiana State third to Denver and Kendall Gill 
of Illinois fifth to Charlotte -- and five in the top 10. Not since Detroit 
used the No. 2 pick in 1981 for Isiah Thomas has a guard gone as high as 
Payton. 
</P>
<P>
Payton, who grew up in Oakland, was thrilled to be staying on the West Coast. 
Jackson worried about the adjustment of playing at altitude, and Gill, hoping 
to go to the Clippers and be reunited with former Illini Ken Norman, appeared 
nothing short of disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, I had to go to Charlotte," he said. "At least it's the only 
show in town." 
</P>
<P>
Nice way to endear yourself to the fans. 
</P>
<P>
Derrick Coleman had a much better start after New Jersey grabbed him with the 
No. 1 overall pick, as expected. 
</P>
<P>
"I just can't describe the emotions I will feel," said Coleman, who became 
college basketball's all-time leading rebounder while at Syracuse. "I've 
dreamed of being the No. 1 pick, and to actually get there is indescribable. 
</P>
<P>
"Playing in the New York area will make me more motivated. It was kind of like 
playing in a fishbowl in Syracuse." 
</P>
<P>
The Nets considered numerous trade offers and the selection of Scott, a premier 
scoring small forward, before deciding on Coleman. He could move right into the 
starting lineup, given the questionable status of power forward Roy Hinson 
after knee surgery, and complement center Sam Bowie, an offensive threat. 
</P>
<P>
Other notable selections in the two-round draft: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Three players from the University of Michigan went in the first round, 
Rumeal Robinson to Atlanta, Loy Vaught to the Clippers, and Mills. The 
Wolverines became the third team in NCAA history to accomplish that, after 
Indiana in 1976 and UCLA in '79. They also sent Sean Higgins, 54th and last to 
San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Chicago used the 29th pick on Yugoslav Toni Kukoc, this year's top European 
import. A forward who some say could play guard because of his shooting and 
ball-handling abilities, his talent is unquestioned. The risk is his two-year 
contract with a team in his home country, so the Bulls may have made more of a 
long-term investment. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a legitimate 6-10, left-handed and very quick," Chicago General Manager 
Jerry Krause said. "He's a talent worth waiting for. There could be the usual 
machinations of getting him over here." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Greg Foster, who attended UCLA before transferring to Texas El Paso, went 
35th to the Washington Bullets. Atlanta followed that by taking Bruin Trevor 
Wilson, based largely on his defensive abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Derek Strong of Palisades High School and Xavier went 47th to Philadelphia. 
The Phoenix Suns used the next pick for Cedric Ceballos of Cal State Fullerton, 
a much lower placing than some team executives anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Detroit Pistons used the 26th selection on guard Lance Blanks from 
Texas. The two-time defending NBA champions had only one selection and have 
already traded all their choices in next year's draft. 
</P>
<P>
Players not picked become free agents.

CLIPPERS GET BO, NOT BOOS; 
</P>
<P>
NBA DRAFT: THE SELECTION OF KIMBLE MAKES FANS HAPPY AT THE SPORTS ARENA, UNLIKE 
LAST SEASON'S FIRST-ROUND CHOICE OF DANNY FERRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bo Kimble, who said he wanted to remain in Los Angeles, got his wish when the 
Clippers selected the Loyola Marymount guard eighth in the NBA draft Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
So, after last year's first-round selection of Danny Ferry, a player who 
apparently didn't want to be a Clipper, they got a player who dreamed of being 
a Clipper. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely a dream come true," Kimble said. "The L.A. Clippers are a team 
that I wanted to play for. I couldn't have been any luckier. To have everything 
come out so perfectly. . . . God is so great." 
</P>
<P>
Kimble blew a kiss to his family after NBA Commissioner David T. Stern made the 
announcement and he accepted a Clipper hat from forward Charles Smith, who 
attended the draft in New York. 
</P>
<P>
After earning the adulation of fans as he led Loyola Marymount to the NCAA West 
Regional final after the death of Hank Gathers, the selection of Kimble was 
popular with the fans who watched the draft at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
When Coach Mike Schuler stepped to the podium to announce the selection of 
Kimble, the crowd shouted Bo, Bo, Bo before he could finish the announcement. 
The standing ovation the announcement drew was a contrast to last year, when 
the fans booed the selection of Ferry. 
</P>
<P>
"If we hadn't selected Bo, there would have been a riot," said Donald T. 
Sterling, Clipper owner. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers selected Michigan forward Loy Vaught with the No. 13 pick. 
</P>
<P>
Did Kimble's market value play a role in his selection? 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted the best possible basketball player we could get," Schuler said. "It 
was just a perfect fit. And I'm so happy that it did fit our plans and our 
needs because he's gone through a great deal of hardship and he came through 
with flying colors." 
</P>
<P>
Does Kimble think staying in Los Angeles will aid his endorsement potential? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know about my marketing prospects," Kimble said. "There's already 
another Bo (Jackson) in town. Bo (Kimble) knows L.A. and after this season, Bo 
knows winning." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers hope that Kimble will help fill the void left by the absence of 
guard Ron Harper, who is expected to return in midseason from knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The top scorer in college basketball last season, Kimble, a 6-foot-3 1/2, 
197-pound shooting guard, averaged 35.3 points in leading Loyola Marymount's 
fast break. 
</P>
<P>
Some NBA scouts were concerned about Kimble's defense, but he proved that he 
was an adept defensive player at an NBA draft evaluation camp in Orlando, Fla. 
He also played strong defense in winning the One-on-One Collegiate Challenge 
Monday in Atlantic City, N.J., defeating Gary Payton of Oregon State, the No. 2 
player selected in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's been the doubt all year, if Bo could play defense," Kimble 
said. "I went to Orlando and did well defensively and I played the One-on-One 
and beat some of the top guys defensively. Everything is clear, I can play 'D.' 
</P>
<P>
There were some nervous moments for the Clippers in the draft before it became 
clear that Kimble would be available. But when the Minnesota Timberwolves, who 
had considered taking Kimble, used the sixth pick to take center Felton Spencer 
of Louisville, there was applause in the Clipper war room, where team officials 
had gathered. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very excited to get Bo Kimble," said Elgin Baylor, Clipper general 
manager. "He's going to give us the outside perimeter shooting that we want. 
The style that Mike is going go play is really conducive to Bo Kimble's type of 
ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
Schuler agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Bo Kimble is the most impressive young man I've ever interviewed, in my nine 
years in the league," Schuler said. "I just fell in love with him. He'll fit in 
so well with the things we're going to do." 
</P>
<P>
Kimble said he wasn't surprised that the Clippers selected him. 
</P>
<P>
"If I wouldn't have been selected for the Clippers, I'd have probably fallen 
out of the chair," Kimble said. "I think I'll fit in well. I think my 
personality and my game suits the Clippers." 
</P>
<P>
Was he nervous? 
</P>
<P>
"Right around the seventh pick, I was hoping that I wasn't going to be the one 
called," Kimble said. "Once I knew I was going to available for eighth, I was 
happy because I knew that I'd be in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
After selecting a guard, the Clippers attempted to strengthen their front court 
by selecting Vaught, a 6-9, 230-pound forward, who averaged 15.5 points, 11.2 
rebounds and shot .595 from the field last season. He led the Big Ten in 
rebounding and field-goal percentage. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Clippers needed a backup center, they couldn't bypass Vaught 
because of his rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a Charles Oakley-type rebounder," Schuler said of Vaught. "He's going to 
rebound for you every night." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers also plan to use Vaught as the backup to center Benoit Benjamin. 
</P>
<P>
Vaught hopes to win fans with his work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that no one will be sorry when they see how I progress as a player and 
as a person as a result of being picked by the Clippers," Vaught said. 
</P>
<P>
Now the real work begins for the Clippers, who must sign Kimble and Vaught. And 
that may not be easy, given their negotiating history with previous top draft 
picks such as Danny Manning, Benoit Benjamin and Reggie Williams, who missed 
most of training camp after signing late.

CANSECO GETS $23.5 MILLION FOR FIVE YEARS; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: A'S OUTFIELDER PASSES MATTINGLY BY NEARLY A MILLION A YEAR AS GAME'S 
HIGHEST-PAID PLAYER.

<P>
Jose Canseco sent baseball's salary scale to new heights Wednesday when he 
officially signed a five-year, $23.5-million contract with the Oakland 
Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco's contract is the biggest in baseball history and represents an average 
annual salary of $4.7 million, almost $900,000 more than the previous high of 
$3.86 million, the average of Don Mattingly's five-year, $19.6-million contract 
with the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Mattingly's contract was signed late in spring training, eclipsing the 
$3.75-million average of the four-year, $15-million contract Will Clark signed 
with the San Francisco Giants after the 1989 season. 
</P>
<P>
Although the signing might force the A's to renegotiate Rickey Henderson's 
four-year, $12-million contract, Henderson said he will not ask to renegotiate. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't regret signing," said Henderson, who signed his $3-million-a-year 
contract last winter, "and I'm not upset with Jose. He's an outstanding player 
who is getting what he deserves. If I was mad at Jose, I'd have to be mad at 
Don Mattingly, Will Clark and everyone else who signed after I did. 
</P>
<P>
"I play for pride, but money is a part of that. I consider myself the best at 
what I do, and as such I have to believe I'm now underpaid, but I won't ask to 
renegotiate. I'm happy with the A's. I don't want to go anywhere unless I have 
to go." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson said A's General Manager Sandy Alderson showed "heart and courage" by 
coming to him to say the club was on the verge of signing Canseco and to 
explain the financial rationale. 
</P>
<P>
Alderson, however, did not mention the possibility of a renegotiation, 
Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're sensitive to disparities that occur in a rapidly changing market, but 
our general position is that a contract is a contract," Alderson said, seeming 
to leave the door ajar when asked if he would be willing to reshape Henderson's 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Stewart, whose average annual salary of $3.5 million is baseball's fourth 
highest, said he is more than satisfied. Of Canseco and Henderson, he said: 
"There's no doubt we have the two best players in the game. Like everything 
else, it comes down to timing. Jose had the timing." 
</P>
<P>
Canseco's contract calls for a $3.5-million signing bonus and annual salaries 
of $2.8 million, $3.6 million, $4.1 million, $4.4 million and $5.1 million. It 
includes a provision that allows Canseco to be traded to any team except the 
two in Canada, and Canseco can make another $200,000 a year if he is most 
valuable player of the league, playoffs and World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Agent Dennis Gilbert said the record signing bonus was negotiated with the 
possibility of an increase in federal taxes in mind. Coupled with his 1990 
salary of $2 million, it makes Canseco the first to receive $5 million in one 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that Canseco was recently hospitalized with a back ailment, Gilbert 
said: "The A's didn't break stride. They kept negotiating. They showed me a lot 
of class."

The Italian basketball team Il Messaggero "temporarily" dropped its tampering 
suit against the Boston Celtics, but said it has "not weakened in our resolve" 
to keep guard Brian Shaw from returning to the NBA club next season. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came one day after a federal judge in Boston upheld a 
five-year, $6.2-million contract that Shaw signed with the Celtics in January 
during the first season of his two-year contract with Il Messaggero. 
</P>
<P>
The Italian team's suit claimed the Celtics acted illegally by signing Shaw to 
a multiyear deal before his contract with Il Messaggero expired. 
</P>
<P>
"The judge's ruling in no way alters the fact that we have a valid contract 
with Brian Shaw that predates that of the Celtics," Il Messaggero's American 
attorney John McGovern said. "More important, Brian Shaw wants to fulfill his 
contract with Il Messaggero and we want him back next season."

Kline said the investigation was based on erroneous information, possibly from

WOMEN: GAVALDON, THE MOST SUPERSTITIOUS PLAYER IN TENNIS, MOVES INTO THIRD

Angelica Gavaldon won her second-round match Wednesday at Wimbledon, which 
means she soon will be kneeling in the bathtub again. 
</P>
<P>
It was a routine day for Gavaldon, the 16-year-old from Coronado, Calif., who 
beat Sara Gomer, 7-5, 0-6, 7-5, then reaffirmed her position as possibly the 
quirkiest player in tennis. 
</P>
<P>
In her first season as a professional, Gavaldon has proved to be a veteran of 
superstitions. At first, the nature of her superstitions was fairly 
straightforward, but they seem to be growing more strange. 
</P>
<P>
When she reached the quarterfinals of the Australian Open in January as an 
amateur, Gavaldon would eat dinner at the same restaurant each night and have a 
chocolate chip cookie for dessert. Then she would braid her hair next to the 
sink in the bathroom each night. 
</P>
<P>
At Tampa in April, Gavaldon took the same seat in the car that brought her to 
her matches. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Gavaldon seems to have refined her superstitions. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really weird," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Gavaldon is staying with a friend of her mother. Once at night and again in the 
morning, Gavaldon and her mother's friend kneel in the bathtub. 
</P>
<P>
Before each match, she eats a baked potato and sweet corn. After each match, 
Gavaldon showers in the same stall in the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's busy, I'll wait," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Gavaldon continues her practice of throwing away the clothes she wears if she 
loses a match, but she hasn't had to do that here yet. A baseliner such as 
Gavaldon doesn't always do well on the grass courts, yet she has been able to 
come from behind in both her matches. 
</P>
<P>
Against Jana Pospisilova, Gavaldon trailed, 0-5, in the second set and came 
back for a 6-3, 7-5 victory. Gomer won eight consecutive games starting the 
second set when Gavaldon told herself something: "Wake up!" 
</P>
<P>
Before coming to Wimbledon, Gavaldon lost in the first round in two tournaments 
and an exhibition, the first three matches she played on grass. 
</P>
<P>
She said she is feeling more comfortable now. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm starting to like it more, now that I'm winning," Gavaldon said. 
</P>
<P>
For luck, she is wearing the same large hoop earrings she wore at the 
Australian Open, which may not be enough to get her past Patty Fendick in the 
third round. But who knows? Maybe Fendick isn't kneeling in her bathtub. 
</P>
<P>
Steffi Graf, Monica Seles, Zina Garrison and 14-year-old Jennifer Capriati 
scored straight-set victories, but Hana Mandlikova lost, 6-3, 6-3, to Ann 
Henricksson, to end her singles career. 
</P>
<P>
Mandlikova, 28, announced last week that she will play only doubles after 
Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I really tried, I tried to play," Mandlikova said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think . . . I am able to win another Grand Slam, and that's why I made 
the decision," she said. "And so, it's not interesting for me anymore if I know 
honestly I cannot win another Grand Slam." 
</P>
<P>
Graf, of course, says she is fairly confident of winning another. She breezed 
past 19-year-old Meredith McGrath, 6-3, 6-0. McGrath turned professional after 
her freshman year at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
Graf plays Claudia Kohde-Kilsch in the third round and continues to head for a 
fourth-round showdown against Capriati. 
</P>
<P>
Already the youngest woman to win a match at Wimbledon, Capriati beat Julie 
Halard, 6-2, 7-6 (7-2) and said afterward she thought she might win Wimbledon 
in her first try. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I mean, if I didn't feel like that, I mean why should I even try for 
it?" Capriati said. "I mean, that's the way I go in every tournament." 
</P>
<P>
Seles won her 34th consecutive match, 6-3, 7-5 over Camille Benjamin. Garrison 
scored a 6-2, 6-1 victory over Cecilia Dahlman of Sweden.

CLIPPERS HAD KIMBLE ALL THE WAY

<P>
The Clippers were ready to draft Bo Kimble Wednesday, in more ways than one. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the marketing staff had a season-ticket advertisement featuring the 
former Loyola Marymount star ready for publication in today's Times, just in 
case. 
</P>
<P>
When the Clippers used the eighth pick to take him, the go-ahead was given for 
publication. A more generic ad was standing by if the choice wasn't Kimble. 
</P>
<P>
"Bo was the only advertisement we had prepared," said Mitch Huberman, the 
Clippers' vice president of marketing and broadcasting. "With the impact Bo 
could have on this team in this city, that was an opportunity we had to take 
advantage of." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday afternoon, with the ad finished and delivered, the marketing staff 
had no indication from General Manager Elgin Baylor that the Clippers would 
take Kimble if he was still around. Like many fans, they just hoped. 
</P>
<P>
The Cleveland Cavaliers will have the right to match any free-agent offers for 
forward John (Hot Rod) Williams, an arbitrator ruled. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel G. Collins, who presided at the arbitration hearing, ruled that Williams 
will not be credited with a year of NBA experience for the season he sat out 
before being cleared of point-shaving charges lodged against him at Tulane. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling means Williams has four years of NBA experience, making him eligible 
to become a restricted free agent July 1. Under NBA rules, the Cavaliers have 
the right of first refusal on any offer he gets from another team. 
</P>
<P>
Had he been credited with the extra season, Williams would have become an 
unrestricted free agent, permitting him to go to the highest bidder. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers are continuing negotiations with Williams, who reportedly turned 
down a $10 million, five-year offer.

GOLD CUP OUTCOME RESURRECTS THORNY ISSUE THAT WON'T GO AWAY -- JOCKEY'S USE OF 
WHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY HOVDEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The outcome of last Sunday's Hollywood Gold Cup has resurrected a thorny issue 
in thoroughbred racing: the use of the whip. 
</P>
<P>
Is the whip an integral part of the sport, required to elicit the best possible 
performance from a recalcitrant creature? Or is it a tool of abuse, used in 
place of sound horsemanship? 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Whittingham, trainer and part owner of Sunday Silence, maintains that 
the horse resents being whipped and proved it again last weekend. Sunday 
Silence was beaten a head by Criminal Type after a stretch-long duel, during 
which Pat Valenzuela hit Sunday Silence 10 times in the last eighth of a mile. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela, on the other hand, insisted after the race that Sunday Silence 
responded to the whip and was gaining on Criminal Type at the end. 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham and Valenzuela will need to reach an agreement before Sunday 
Silence runs again. In the meantime, the whip question is beginning to receive 
attention from several voices within the racing industry. Some go so far as to 
suggest whips be banned. Others see a need for increased regulation, at the 
very least. 
</P>
<P>
The use of whips is barely addressed in the California rules of racing. Jockeys 
may not whip a horse on the head, or use the whip "excessively or brutally," 
leaving enforcement open to interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
There is even a stipulation that seems to encourage the use of the whip without 
placing any limits. Section 1688 states, in part, that: "No jockey carrying a 
whip during a race shall fail to use the whip in a manner consistent with using 
his best efforts to win." 
</P>
<P>
Translation: If a jockey is beaten by a nose and hasn't used his whip, he has 
some explaining to do. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Park steward Pete Pedersen noted that jockeys are regularly reminded 
to be judicious in their use of the whip. 
</P>
<P>
"We decry any overuse of the whip," Pedersen said. "We've had riders flailing 
away at horses who were hopelessly beaten. I think that's terrible, and we call 
them in when it happens." 
</P>
<P>
Pedersen admitted, however, that jockeys can be encouraged to excessive whip 
use by demanding trainers and a single-minded public -- a public interested 
only in cashing a bet. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Church, a former jockey who works in the Del Mar publicity department, 
recalls that pre-race instructions rarely included a lecture on cruelty to 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
"A trainer wanted to see his jock coming down there doing something to win," 
said Church, who won the 1964 Santa Anita Handicap on Mr. Consistency. "He 
wasn't too concerned about how many times the horse got hit." 
</P>
<P>
Most horses don't even need to be urged on with constant whipping, Church 
added. 
</P>
<P>
"You can get a little extra from a horse when you sting them the first time," 
Church said. "It's more from surprise than anything. But after a while, they go 
the other way. It's got to be a form of communication, not punishment." 
</P>
<P>
Some riders can be quite crude in their "communication." 
</P>
<P>
"I've had horses come back bleeding from whip cuts," trainer Dave Hofmans said. 
"Those riders I avoid using." 
</P>
<P>
Caught in close quarters during a race, horses are sometimes hit in the face by 
opposing riders -- accidentally or otherwise. Other jockeys can be targets, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
"There were times I came back with welts across my back," Church said. "I 
remember getting hit on the toe in cold weather, and man did that hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Shoemaker once returned from a race, whipped and bruised, and had a few 
words for Johnny Longden. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind you beating me for the money, John," Shoemaker said. "But I do 
mind you beating me up in the bargain." 
</P>
<P>
As far as critics of the whip are concerned, the riders can take care of 
themselves. It is the horse who is being abused. 
</P>
<P>
Monty Roberts, famous for his "no-pain" method of training young horses, would 
like to see whip use curtailed. Lighter, thicker whips should be used, he says, 
in place of the thin, fiberglass whips that weigh up to a pound. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to suggest that some kind of contact at some point could not be 
an advantage," Roberts said from his office in Solvang. "What I do know, 
however, is that eventually every horse will run slower from the use of the 
whip. 
</P>
<P>
"The horse is an 'into-pressure' animal," Roberts said. "Unlike a human, who 
recoils from pain, the horse has a tendency to press on pain. It stands to 
reason, then, that if you're hitting them on the flank, they will back into the 
pain and consequently run slower." 
</P>
<P>
Race commentator Trevor Denman also is a strong advocate of limiting the whip. 
His calls at Santa Anita and Del Mar reflect his attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"I get laughed at as being naive," said Denman, who is a member of a 
Washington-based animal rights organization. "They say I'm obsessed. But I 
don't agree, because if anything we've got the extreme case going the opposite 
way. 
</P>
<P>
Denman has been urging the American racing industry to adopt England's rule 
that limits a jockey to 10 strikes in the last quarter mile. 
</P>
<P>
"If English racing can do it, then we can," he said. "This could go on for two 
or three years, and then you reduce the number to five. And then you reduce it 
to naught." 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jefforee, ridden by Corey Nakatani, took the lead at the six-furlong mark and 
held off Bidder Cream in the stretch to win Wednesday's $37,000 feature race at 
Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Jefforee finished a neck in front of Bidder Cream in the 1 1/16-mile turf 
allowance race, with Tanya's Tuition another 2 1/2 lengths back in third.

SIDNEY SOLOMON DIES; FOUNDER OF LONG BEACH ACTIVIST GROUP

<TEXT>
<P>
Sidney S. Solomon, a widely respected community activist who founded Long Beach 
Area Citizens Involved, died Sunday at the age of 71. 
</P>
<P>
Solomon, known as Sid, died of a heart attack at a Bellflower hospital hours 
after he was admitted complaining of shortness of breath. 
</P>
<P>
A retired manager for Radio Shack, Solomon became actively involved in local 
politics not long after moving to Long Beach in 1971. Five years later he 
founded the liberal political watchdog organization known as LBACI, and through 
it, influenced a number of key city decisions over the years. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't care how unpopular an issue was. If he thought it was morally right, 
he got in there and pushed for it," said public safety commissioner Larry 
Davis, who worked with Solomon this year to gain voter approval of a 
long-sought Citizen Police Complaint Commission to review police brutality 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"He was trained in another generation," observed Alan Lowenthal, who recently 
succeeded Solomon as president of LBACI. "He was just so committed and he 
believed people could make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
Solomon was a fixture at City Council meetings, quietly keeping tabs on the 
council and only occasionally speaking. "He had a remarkable ability to sit in 
the back and not have all the adulation," said Councilman Ray Grabinski, who 
also remembered Solomon's "uncanny sense for what was going on in the city. 
Sometimes I'd challenge him and he'd laugh and wave his hands and say, 'You'll 
see, you'll see.' " 
</P>
<P>
Among his successful crusades was a 1976 campaign against the installation of 
an oil pipeline to Long Beach Harbor, the switch from citywide balloting to 
district elections for both the City Council and the school board, and the 
adoption of local ordinances barring discrimination against gays and people 
with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Lowell, Mass., Solomon worked as a labor organizer before World War II, 
served in the U.S. Army during the war and afterward earned a degree in 
electrical engineering from George Washington University. He got a job in the 
electronics industry and moved to Chicago, where he met his wife Phyllis, whom 
he married in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife, their two sons, and two stepchildren from his 
wife's previous marriage. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service will be held at 2 p.m. Sunday at the Unitarian Universalist 
Church, 5450 Atherton St.

<P>
A consumer advocacy group today released a nationwide compendium that 
identifies nearly 7,000 medical professionals who have been disciplined by 
state and federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The roster, two inches thick and titled "6,892 Questionable Doctors," lists 
actions taken against physicians, dentists, chiropractors and podiatrists in 40 
states and the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
Ten states did not respond. 
</P>
<P>
"If your doctor is among the 6,892 on this list, you ought at least to question 
the quality of his or her care. At the very minimum, you should find out why," 
Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the Public Citizen Health Research Group, said in 
a statement released with the compilation. 
</P>
<P>
Although the nation's system for protecting the public from incompetent 
physicians has "vastly improved" in the last 15 years, it is still inadequate, 
said the group, founded by consumer activist Ralph Nader.

Seven people died and 50 were reported missing because a low-caste 15-year-old 
bridegroom from India's Taj Mahal town of Agra wanted to ride to his wedding on 
horseback, a local member of Parliament said today. 
</P>
<P>
Police in Agra, 125 miles south of Delhi, said they had arrested 200 people and 
were keeping four ghettos for Harijans -- the untouchables at the bottom of the 
Hindu caste hierarchy -- under curfew after the wedding sparked a caste war. 
</P>
<P>
Bridegroom Ram Deen, a Harijan, eventually rode to nearby Panwari village in a 
police jeep to marry 13-year-old Mundra while the army fought back thousands of 
enraged Jats, the caste of small landowners, in the village and police 
confronted thousands of Agra Harijans just outside.

Federal officials today released a videotape showing Mayor Marion Barry smoking 
a substance alleged to be crack cocaine the night of his arrest in an FBI sting 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
The tape was released at the U.S. District Courthouse at the same time it was 
to be shown to jurors in Barry's drug and perjury trial. 
</P>
<P>
FBI cameras hidden in a downtown hotel room recorded Barry's visit to the room 
of a longtime friend, Rasheeda Moore, on Jan. 18. 
</P>
<P>
The fuzzy tape shows Barry inhaling twice from a pipe, and a few moments later, 
FBI agents bursting into the room and telling him he was under arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't do anything," Barry said, uttering a string of expletives in Moore's 
direction. "I've been set up." 
</P>
<P>
The tape shows Barry initially expressed reluctance to inhale unless Moore did 
so first -- a potentially important development in view of his defense claims 
that he was the victim of government entrapment. 
</P>
<P>
Barry looked at the substance and then said, "I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Moore: "You do it." 
</P>
<P>
Barry: "No." 
</P>
<P>
At one point Barry said "How does this work?" and Moore responded, "What?" 
</P>
<P>
A few moments later, he inhaled and then appeared momentarily wobbly. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, who was cooperating with the government sting, asked if he was all 
right. 
</P>
<P>
The tape was aired after a morning of testimony by Moore about the events of 
the night. 
</P>
<P>
Moore said the mayor was "uncomfortable" with visiting her in her room. 
</P>
<P>
"There are too many nosy rosies around," Barry complained in a phone call to 
Moore shortly before his arrival. That call and others were recorded by agents 
and played for the jury today. 
</P>
<P>
Moore testified that she was surprised when Barry said he did not know how to 
use the crack pipe that she gave him after he arrived in the room. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you mean? You've used that a lot," Moore said she told Barry. Barry's 
attorney has portrayed the mayor as a reluctant, inexperienced drug user in 
recounting Barry's version of the night.

The controversial French abortion pill has won backing from the American 
Medical Assn., the nation's largest doctors' association. 
</P>
<P>
In a voice vote Wednesday, the AMA's 436-member policy-making House of 
Delegates endorsed testing and possible use of the RU-486 abortion pill. 
</P>
<P>
"The abortion issue, pro and con, should not interfere with our ability to 
conduct all kinds of investigations for all kinds of problems," said Dr. 
Charles Sherman, chairman of the AMA committee that recommended support for the 
pill. 
</P>
<P>
The pill is not available in the United States, and no U.S. companies have 
applied for Food and Drug Administration approval to market it in this country 
because, doctors say, they fear running afoul of the anti-abortion movement. 
</P>
<P>
Some doctors in the AMA said the pill appears safer and cheaper than surgical 
abortion and may be useful in treating brain tumors, breast cancer and other 
illnesses.

LAWYER CALLS BOESKY 'A PILE OF GARBAGE' IN WALL STREET TRIAL

Convicted swindler Ivan Boesky is "a pile of human garbage" who lied repeatedly 
on the witness stand about dealings with former stock speculator John A. 
Mulheren Jr., Mulheren's lawyer said today. 
</P>
<P>
In closing arguments in Mulheren's fraud and conspiracy trial, attorney Thomas 
Puccio attacked the credibility of Boesky, who testified against Mulheren as 
part of a plea deal that settled insider trading charges. 
</P>
<P>
"If there ever was a person to whom the title Prince of Darkness could be 
applied," Puccio said, "Ivan Boesky is that man: the king of greed, a person 
who stood for nothing except his own ambition, his own greed." 
</P>
<P>
"Boesky, ladies and gentlemen, is a pile of human garbage," he said. "And that 
is what the government of the United States had put up to testify against John 
Mulheren." 
</P>
<P>
Mulheren, 40, is charged with 30 counts of conspiracy, securities and mail 
fraud, and keeping false books and records in connection with allegedly illegal 
securities transactions with Boesky in 1985 and 1986.

A former Nissan executive was elected today as president of Fuji Heavy 
Industries Co., giving Nissan effective control over the slumping manufacturer 
of Subaru cars. 
</P>
<P>
Fuji shareholders approved the selection of Isamu Kawai, former president of 
Nissan Diesel Motor Co., a subsidiary of Nissan Motor Co., during a meeting 
here. 
</P>
<P>
Nissan, Japan's second largest auto maker, is Fuji's largest shareholder, with 
a 4.2% stake, and its superior in a corporate grouping, or keiretsu. Japan has 
many such groups, bound together by cross share-holdings, other financial ties 
and common business strategies. 
</P>
<P>
"Fuji would have been probably taken over if it were in the United States, and 
I'm sure even Nissan had difficulty deciding whether it should acquire it," 
said Kimihide Takano, an analyst with Chemical Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, Nissan chose a typically Japanese way, taking advantage of its 
superior position in the group to send an executive to exercise effective 
control.

Imelda Marcos and Adnan Khashoggi heard themselves described as willing 
participants in a complex scheme of fraud and deception as government 
prosecutors wrapped up their case against the pair. 
</P>
<P>
Asst. U.S. Attorney Charles LaBella delivered a final, stinging rebuttal to the 
defense today. 
</P>
<P>
He stacked packs of Philippine pesos on the rail of the jury box to dramatize 
his claim that Marcos knew her husband, the late President Ferdinand Marcos, 
was enriching himself by stealing millions from his country's treasury. 
</P>
<P>
And he charged that Khashoggi knew a U.S. federal court injunction had frozen 
the Marcoses' U.S. assets before he agreed in 1986 to backdate documents to 
show that he, not they, owned four New York buildings and some paintings. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at all the evidence you will be convinced beyond a reasonable 
doubt that Imelda Marcos is guilty and that Adnan Khashoggi also is guilty," 
LaBella told the jurors. 
</P>
<P>
Today, U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan instructed the jurors on the law in 
the case. The jurors, who will be sequestered at the close of his charge, were 
to begin deliberations in the afternoon.

LIZ SMITH: PAPARAZZI HOT FOR IVANA; DUNNE CASTING ABOUT

<P>
OF ALL the names attending Helen Gurley Brown's 25th anniversary party Monday, 
the one the paparazzi went mad over was Ivana Trump. They liked her even better 
than Don Johnson, once the sizzling hero of "Miami Vice." 
</P>
<P>
As for those photos of Ivana embracing Don in such a warm way -- big deal. He 
and his wife, Melanie Griffith, getting ready to take a Mediterranean cruise 
together, have long been pals of both the Trumps. 
</P>
<P>
Hot skinny yesterday had it that some of Ivana's admirers are saying "I told 
you so!" They wanted her to accept the money of the nuptial agreement and take 
it and run. Says one: "She'd have been better off. Now she may end up with half 
of nothing!" But Ivana is going ahead with her lawsuit to declare herself the 
equal partner in Donald's empire, and she'll be giving legal depositions early 
next month. Her plans haven't changed. She does not intend to accept the terms 
of the nuptial agreement nor to file for divorce. 
</P>
<P>
AUTHOR DOMINICK Dunne has blanketed the United States with his promo tour for 
his new novel, "An Inconvenient Woman." (This is the sizzler about a powerful 
and rich California couple with friends at the top. The wife is Madame 
Perfection. The husband has a longtime mistress who makes trouble, etc.) 
</P>
<P>
Now didn't Nick Dunne recently have a little "meet" with Farrah Fawcett, who is 
dying to play the "inconvenient woman"? And who does the writer envision in the 
film version as the all-too-perfect wife? Faye Dunaway! 
</P>
<P>
HAVE A staggering statistic. Conservative columnist Patrick J. Buchanan's 
coming "From the Right" newsletter will tell us that if Trump wanted to stay 
rich, he should have gone to law school! 
</P>
<P>
Buchanan reports that the Resolution Trust Corp. (set up to oversee the savings 
and loan bailout) has budgeted $500 million to be paid to consulting lawyers in 
1990 alone. These fees will grow to billions before it's over, even if it is 
ever over in our lifetimes. 
</P>
<P>
The General Accounting Office's low estimate now of the cost of the S&amp;L 
bailout is $325 billion. (Their pessimistic estimate is $500 billion.) The 
Stanford Law and Policy Review, meanwhile, predicts that the bailout could 
reach -- wait for it -- $1.4 trillion. Write that as $1,400,000,000,000.

TO KNOW her is to love her! That's Tina Turner. And that's all it took for 
Britain's Lord and Lady Tavistock to reverse their ban on rock shows on the 
grounds of their Woburn Abbey. His lordship and her ladyship had a personal 
talk with Tina, and suddenly the regal estate near London will become the site 
for two very special performances -- July 28 and 29 -- for more than 130,000 
concertgoers.

The head of the Justice Department's criminal division today announced his 
resignation to enter private law practice, creating another vacancy in the 
agency's top ranks. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Atty. Gen. Edward S. G. Dennis Jr., a career federal prosecutor who 
has headed the criminal division since 1988, said in a letter to Atty. Gen. 
Dick Thornburgh that he plans to leave the Justice Department on Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis, who is the first black to head the Justice Department's criminal 
division, said in a statement that he will become a senior partner at the 
Philadelphia law firm of Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis' departure adds another vacancy to the top echelons of the Justice 
Department, which has been plagued by a series of personnel difficulties under 
Thornburgh. 
</P>
<P>
But officials stressed that Dennis' resignation is unrelated to the recent 
staff turmoil, which came to a head in May when Deputy Atty. Gen. Donald B. 
Ayer resigned. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, two sources said Dennis had grown frustrated with Thornburgh's 
management style, which had centralized decision-making in the attorney 
general's office.

<TEXT>
<P>
A Supreme Court justice today refused to help a Texas television news reporter 
who has begun serving a six-month jail term for refusing to surrender the name 
of a source. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Byron R. White, without comment, denied an emergency request by Brian 
Karem of San Antonio's KMOL-TV. 
</P>
<P>
The request sought to postpone Karem's sentence while he appeals the 
contempt-of-court finding against him. 
</P>
<P>
"I sure don't want to do six months in jail," KMOL-TV reporter Brian Karem said 
on the Bexar County Jail steps as he surrendered to begin serving the jail term 
Wednesday. "But I'm going to keep my promise." 
</P>
<P>
The reporter has defied three court orders to turn over confidential notes of a 
telephone interview last year with one of the two suspects jailed in the murder 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecution and defense lawyers, who are preparing for the murder case, contend 
they need to know who arranged the interview. Karem has said the source fears 
for his life if his identity is revealed. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't live up to our principles every day in life," Karem told reporters as 
he entered the jail. "But I think this is an important enough issue and I feel 
strongly enough about it that I want to live up to how I believe." 
</P>
<P>
Karem had hoped to stay out of jail while he appealed the contempt citations. 
But those hopes ended Tuesday when the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 
refused to issue a stay. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff Harlon Copeland met Karem on the steps of the jail. The reporter was 
accompanied by KMOL news director Ron Harig, station manager Bob Donohue and 
Karem's father, James. 
</P>
<P>
Karem said his only hope for release would be for the source to come forward or 
for the U.S. Supreme Court to block his sentence pending appeal.

Nostalgia abounds at the 11th U.S. Senior Open. 
</P>
<P>
There are those aging heroes -- Arnold Palmer, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus, Lee 
Trevino -- playing with all the old flair and flavor that did so much to raise 
professional golf to new heights 25, 30, 35 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
For Palmer, another confrontation with his old friends and golfing foes, 
however, is a prelude to a sentimental journey that will close an important 
part of his career. 
</P>
<P>
His appearance at the Old Course in St. Andrews, Scotland, next month will be 
his last in the British Open. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless something happens that I don't know of, this will be my swan song" in 
the British Open, Palmer said before teeing off today in the first round of the 
Senior Open. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a sentimental journey back to St. Andrews, 30 years to the day that 
I went to my first British Open Championship," Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer finished second to Australian Kel Nagle in his first British Open 
appearance in 1960, then won the title the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
"Winning those two British Opens was an important step for me, an important 
part of my career, something I'll always cherish," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll have the same caddy I had 30 years ago. I'm sure we'll do a lot of 
reminiscing, remembering old times, shots played 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't that I wouldn't like to continue playing the British Open; it isn't 
that I don't still enjoy it," said Palmer, now 60. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's time. I'm getting older. It's time I started concentrating more on 
our Senior Tour." 
</P>
<P>
And the Senior Tour, he said, just keeps getting better and better. 
</P>
<P>
"Scores keep going down. They're almost at the level of the regular tour. The 
competition is very good, very strong," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any of us are surprised at the success of the Senior Tour, but a 
lot of us are surprised that it has raised to such a magnitude in 10 short 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer, who continues to have putting problems, said the Senior Open 
championships for golf's over-50 set should follow the trend of the Senior 
Tour. 
</P>
<P>
"Typically in recent months, we've have some exceptionally low scoring. I think 
you'll see some good scoring here, some very good rounds," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A case in point, he said, was the record-setting, 27-under-par performance by 
Nicklaus in the Senior TPC three weeks ago. Trevino was 21 under par in the 
same tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Trevino, who plays the Senior Tour on a full-time basis, has won five times 
this season and finished second in his last two starts. Nicklaus has won two of 
his three Senior Tour starts. 
</P>
<P>
"They certainly have shown us how strong they can play," Palmer said. "But they 
aren't the only ones in the field. 
</P>
<P>
"There's the same guys who were there 30 years ago on the regular tour, Gary 
(Player), (Bob) Charles, Chi Chi (Rodriguez). All can win. Orville Moody played 
a helluva tournament last year at Latrobe and won this championship, and he's 
capable of doing it again. 
</P>
<P>
"And there are some others in the field you don't hear much about: Don Bies, 
Charles Coody, George Archer. You don't want to overlook them. 
</P>
<P>
"All that being said, you can't get away from Trevino and Nicklaus and the way 
they've been playing." 
</P>
<P>
And what about Arnold's chances? 
</P>
<P>
"I hope I'm able to find something in my putting that hasn't been there for a 
while, something that will give me a little more confidence," he said.

WIMBLEDON: PLAY SUSPENDED BRIEFLY IN FALSE ALARM BOMB SCARE. NAVRATILOVA

<P>
Ivan Lendl's mission to finally win Wimbledon took another powerful step 
forward today with a victory over a hard-hitting Swiss. 
</P>
<P>
The top-ranked player in the world used pounding serves, sharply angled volleys 
and a lot of skill to beat Jakob Hlasek of Switzerland 6-1, 6-3, 6-0 to advance 
to the third round. 
</P>
<P>
"He made me look bad because he played so good," said Hlasek, a quality player 
ranked 50th in the world. "But not (only) did he play well, he has really 
improved on grass. The whole game -- the volley, the serve, the confidence. 
Everything." 
</P>
<P>
Another player who has dedicated the season to winning Wimbledon, second-seeded 
Martina Navratilova, looked overpowering, too. She beat Anne Smith of the 
United States 6-2, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Also advancing, although with a bit more difficulty, was Gabriela Sabatini. The 
women's fourth seed from Argentina beat Anke Huber of West Germany 6-2, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
Out of the tournament went Henri Leconte. The 15th seed from France was 
eliminated by Alex Antonitsch of Austria 2-6, 6-4, 7-6, 2-6, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
As the fourth day of the Grand Slam tournament played out in cool, breezy 
weather, a bomb scare paralyzed part of the ground outside Centre Court for 
about a half hour. 
</P>
<P>
Play was suspended on three outside courts after a suspicious item -- it turned 
out to be a camera in a leather case -- was found near the main gate. Police 
bomb-squad officers gave the all-clear after checking the item with a portable 
X-ray machine. 
</P>
<P>
The victory by Antonitsch was built on a booming serve and passing shots, and 
Leconte's mistakes. The Frenchman double-faulted and flubbed a volley in the 
eighth game of the fifth set to give Antonitsch the service break he needed for 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Leconte was the eighth seed out of the men's draw with the third round not even 
finished. He had been seeded to meet Lendl in the fourth round. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl played almost-perfect tennis in racing by Hlasek in 78 minutes. His only 
lapse came when he tried to be perhaps too fancy in his first service game, 
after opening with an ace. He double-faulted to 30-40 when he smacked two hard 
serves instead of trying to get the second serve in, then lost the game on a 
lob by Hlasek. 
</P>
<P>
After that, however, Lendl toyed with Hlasek, who beat the top seed in the 
Masters in New York in 1988. Lendl won six straight games and never lost serve 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl polished off the match with a 20-minute third set in which he seemed at 
times to be playing in slow motion, winding up and gunning shots left and right 
at the helpless Hlasek. He ended the match with an ace and a pair of service 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
"I returned well, I lobbed well," Lendl said. "I think I can play a bit better. 
I can definitely make more first serves." 
</P>
<P>
Lendl hit on only 62% of his first serves, the same as Hlasek. It was the only 
part of the game on which the two were equals. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova, seeking a record ninth Wimbledon crown, overwhelmed Smith in the 
early going but appeared to be having some problems with her left leg as the 
match wound down. 
</P>
<P>
Smith did not get a break point until the eighth game of the second set. She 
broke at love then, on three Navratilova errors and a passing shot, and 
stretched her mini-streak to seven points when she went up 15-0 in the ninth 
game. But Navratilova, who complained of a sore knee last week, broke back for 
the match. 
</P>
<P>
Other seeds advanced easily as well. Men's ninth seed Jim Courier beat Jason 
Stoletenberg of Australia 6-2, 7-6, 6-4. Women's No. 7 Katerina Maleeva beat 
Kimiko Date of Japan 6-1, 6-4, and No. 14 Judith Wiesner of Austria beat Karine 
Quentrec of France 6-3, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
A former semifinalist, American Kevin Curren, beat South Africa's Gary Muller 
in a marathon match, 6-7 (1-7), 6-4, 7-6 (7-4), 6-7 (3-7), 6-4. Muller 
eliminated seventh-seeded Tim Mayotte in the first round.

UNKNOWNS COME OFF BENCH TO STAR ROLES

A lot of the fun in major sports tournaments, such as Wimbledon or the NCAA 
basketball March Madness, is the paradoxical rise of unknowns and fall of 
giants. The same goes for soccer's monthlong World Cup, now passing from the 
busy opening two rounds to this weekend's quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
The goal-scoring leader of the 1986 World Cup, with six, England's striker Gary 
Lineker has only one goal in four games this time. And Argentina's Diego 
Maradona, who took the '86 tournament for his own, has not scored at all and, 
until his fourth game, had not even taken a shot. Although he has saved his 
team with two game-turning plays, he clearly is not the old Maradona. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, what was logically expected here of Maradona and Lineker and the other 
marquee players -- the Netherlands' pair of Ruud Gullit and Marco Van Basten -- 
instead has come from Cameroon's Roger Milla, Italy's Salvatore Schillaci and 
Czechoslovakia's Tomas Skuhravy. Unlikely heroes, to say the least. 
</P>
<P>
Milla, 38, came into the tournament as the oldest field player. (Only English 
goalkeeper Peter Shilton, at 40, is older.) Having already retired once, Milla 
was referred to, sarcastically, as being "not quite a hundred years old" by the 
French sports daily L'Equipe. He has played only in reserve, coming off the 
bench in each of his team's four games. Yet he has scored four times and become 
one of the World Cup's most lovable characters. In the Cameroon capital of 
Yaounde, there are plans to build a monument to Milla. 
</P>
<P>
Schillaci, by coming off the bench to win Italy's first game, and by scoring 
twice more after the host team moved him into the starting lineup, has prompted 
the headline: "Toto" -- his nickname -- "We Want to Hug You!" Also a 
bench-warmer when the World Cup opened, and a longtime minor-leaguer to boot, 
Schillaci's discovery, just when Italy needed to score goals, already has 
raised him to legendary status. 
</P>
<P>
Skuhravy, meanwhile, has almost quietly become the tournament's leading scorer, 
thanks to playing twice against teams from one of the world's weakest zones -- 
the North-Central America-Caribbean region. With two goals against the United 
States and three against Costa Rica, the previously unknown Skuhravy has five 
goals, and a job offer to play professionally in Italy next year. 
</P>
<P>
A star is born; it happens every time.

KID STUFF: THE SOUND OF BEING A KID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
If you could capture all the simple joys of being a kid -- building 
sandcastles, biking around the neighborhood with your pals, running and jumping 
and acting silly just for the heck of it -- and set them all to music, you'd 
have a pretty good idea of what Parachute Express sounds like. The 
Glendale-based trio will drop into Anaheim's Celebrity Theatre on Saturday 
morning for an hour of bouncy, funky, swingy music that's geared toward kids 2 
to 8, but shouldn't send parents into sugar shock. 
</P>
<P>
The performers want "to create rhythms and music so catchy that parents would 
love to listen with their children, instead of just tuning it out," says Donny 
Becker, who co-founded the group in 1982. "The whole focus of our music is to 
help the family connect, to give them a time to really come together, enjoy 
each other and just get silly. 
</P>
<P>
"Plus, we try to write music that has so much in it melodically, rhythmically 
and lyrically that it will reach children on all different levels. At 4, a 
child who has been listening to us since he was 2 can suddenly turn to Mom and 
say, 'Wow, did you hear such and such?' New doors should always be opening up." 
</P>
<P>
The group's bouncy "Around the Block," for example, brings the lofty ideal of 
world harmony into a child's perspective: 
</P>
<P>
"Look at the world as one big street 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone's your neighbor 
</P>
<P>
 Come on, neighbor, put a smile on your face 
</P>
<P>
 Let's run together in the human race" The group relies heavily on simple 
choreography and pantomime to bring children into the show's action. In 
"Choo-Choo," Becker takes the audience on a rollicking make-believe train ride, 
inviting kids to make the wheels turn by rolling their arms and to clang the 
bell with a pull of their arms. "When I Build My House" finds youngsters 
pretending to saw wood, hammer nails and paint walls. 
</P>
<P>
Parachute Express is associated with the Gymboree Corporation, an international 
network of children's "play-movement" programs. The trio was born when Becker, 
who owns a Gymboree franchise in the San Fernando Valley, found a dearth of 
original children's music to use in his classes and set out to create his own. 
</P>
<P>
One evening, the former teacher and camp director threw out the idea to his 
neighbor, musician Stephen Michael Schwartz, while the two were emptying their 
trash. Schwartz brought in artist Janice Hubbard and two years later the trio 
released its first recording, "Shakin' It." 
</P>
<P>
These days, the group's catalogue includes four other records (all sold 
exclusively through Gymboree retail stores and franchises) and a video, 
"Parachute Express: Live in Concert." The group, which has been featured on the 
Disney Channel, tours about six months a year.

The Pacific Symphony's five-concert summer series at the Irvine Meadows 
Amphitheatre, which starts Wednesday, will focus on the tried-and-true, "very 
popular classical music," in the words of Louis G. Spisto, the orchestra's 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
The concerts have been organized around such "themes" as the opening "All 
American Celebration" (Wednesday is July 4; there'll be fireworks); all-Mozart 
and all-Beethoven programs July 21 and Aug. 18 respectively, an "Espana" 
program Sept. 1 and the closing "Tchaikovsky Spectacular" Sept. 15. Conductors 
are Evans Haile July 4; Toshiyuki Shimada July 21; Kate Tamarkin Aug. 18; Lucas 
Richman, the Pacific's assistant conductor, Sept. 1; and Bruce Ferden Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
"People like to feel, when coming to a summer venue, that they are there to 
hear and experience music they already believe they will enjoy," Spisto says. 
"They're not coming for new experiences." 
</P>
<P>
"That's true for us and for Hollywood Bowl as well," he adds. "They want music 
that is pleasant, pleasurable and to a large extent entertaining. We make no 
excuse for the programs." 
</P>
<P>
So far the strategy is a success. "Certainly the themes have helped sales," 
says Spisto, reporting 4,638 series subscriptions sold as of June 15 (last 
summer, the orchestra sold fewer than 2,700). That translates into 
approximately $570,000; reaching the summer budget figure of $600,000 should be 
a piece of cake. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very likely that we will be expanding in future seasons. But not next 
year," Spisto says, striking another don't-rock-the-boat-type note. "We want to 
have two to three seasons of a real solid base before we expand. One thing that 
is clear about other orchestras which have gotten into trouble: When you expand 
too fast, you wind up paying for it later. We're very happy with doing five 
concerts." 
</P>
<P>
What: The Pacific Symphony 
</P>
<P>
When: Wednesday at 8:30 p.m. Series continues July 21, Aug. 18, Sept. 1 and 15. 
Picnic grounds open before each program, at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Where: The Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre, 8800 Irvine Center Drive, Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Whereabouts: 405 Freeway to Irvine Center Drive exit. Turn left at the end of 
the ramp if you're coming from the south, right if you're coming from the 
north. 
</P>

Wherewithal: $10.50 to $37.50. Lawn seating: $8.50. Series tickets: $65 to

"Conceptual Impulse" marks the first anniversary of the Security Pacific 
Gallery, the contemporary art gallery at the Security Pacific Bank headquarters 
in Costa Mesa. There have been some ups and downs during the past 12 months, 
but this exhibit contains some genuinely fresh and provocative work. 
</P>
<P>
Which is not to say that the show is easy to breeze in and out of. Most of the 
seven American artists in the show -- who live in Los Angeles, New York and 
Tupelo, Tenn. -- want to slow you down and dance awhile on your brain. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Ballou offers coy glimpses of human flesh wedged in between sheets of 
colored wood veneer. In some of these works, the contours of the bodies look as 
weirdly arbitrary as the political boundaries on a map. That's no accident -- 
Ballou is concerned with the notion of covert glimpses at information some 
consider too provocative for public consumption. 
</P>

Uta Barth uses optical effects to give viewers a hard time. Each of her four 
paintings is a four-foot-square field of thin black-and-white stripes with a 
tiny photograph in the center, of a house or apartment with brightly 
illuminated windows. While your eyes experience the retinal tease of the 
eye-popping stripes, your mind tries to make sense of them as an evocation of 
nocturnal danger lurking outside the comfort of the home.

Mel Chin concerns himself with elements of the scientific method; he seems 
fascinated with the processes of proof and cause and effect. In "Revival Field

VIDEO DISCOVERY: STANLEY KUBRICK'S CHILLING 'KILLING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG LIST

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most everyone has seen the precise, epic-like sweep of Stanley Kubrick's 
direction in "Dr. Strangelove," "2001," "A Clockwork Orange," "The Shining" 
and/or "Full Metal Jacket." 
</P>
<P>
As a young filmmaker in the 1950s, though, Kubrick was attuned to the gritty, 
low-budget film noir thriller technique epitomized in "The Killing," recently 
released on video. 
</P>
<P>
Similar in story and intensity to John Huston's "The Asphalt Jungle," Kubrick's 
film follows a band of very serious thugs planning the biggest score of their 
careers -- a million-dollar heist at a race track. 
</P>
<P>
Led by Sterling Hayden (who also starred in "Asphalt Jungle"), the robbery 
seems to go as planned except for the intrusion of a small-time gangster 
(played by Vince Edwards), who learns of the robbery from the two-timing wife 
of one of the gang members. 
</P>
<P>
Like so many crime films of the 1940s and '50s, "The Killing" has an urgent, 
desperate mood, intensified by no-nonsense dialogue and newsreel-like 
narration. This is an unrelenting 83 minutes, devoid of stylish diversions or 
secondary plots. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Killing" (1956), directed by Stanley Kubrick. 83 minutes. No rating.

CALIFORNIA COMMENTARY;

<P>
IN L.A., SOME PEOPLE DON'T COUNT; 
</P>
<P>
THE TEACHERS' UNION CAN ENHANCE ITS POSITION BY HELPING TO ENSURE THAT THE 
BURDEN OF BUDGET CUTS IS EQUITABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK RIDLEY-THOMAS; JOHN W. MACK; JOSEPH H. DUFF, Mark Ridley-Thomas is 
executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership of Greater Los Angeles; 
John W. Mack is president of the Los Angeles Urban League, and Joseph H. Duff 
is president of the Los Angeles Chapter of the NAACP. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From one end of this town to the other, in the public sector and the private 
sector, the message is clear: Some people don't count. The very people who have 
the least capability of economically fending for themselves and their families 
are the ones policy-makers and corporate executives put on the chopping block. 
This is fundamentally unjust, we challenge it. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Board of Education's proposal for slashing $220 million from 
its budget is blatantly unjust because the largest personnel cuts are 
concentrated in jobs with the highest percentages of people of color. For 
example, custodians, 93% of whom are people of color, are confronted with a 16% 
cutback. At the same time, assistant principals, less than half of whom are 
people of color, face a 5% cutback in their ranks. 
</P>
<P>
No one who is deserving of the title of community leader would tolerate 
injustice being visited upon those who we claim to represent, or passively 
accept such mistreatment without a struggle. Therefore, we developed a set of 
budget proposals that were inherently more fair because they required every 
district employee to share the burden and no group (ethnic or otherwise) to 
bare the brunt of the budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was the result of much work and consultation among leaders in the 
African-American community. Last Saturday, the Black Leadership Coalition on 
Education, along with Assemblywoman Maxine Waters, convened an unprecedented 
emergency meeting with more than 100 representatives of the African-American 
community, including school administrators, teachers, union leaders, community 
leaders, parents, religious leaders and education activists. We met not only to 
express outrage over the threat of layoffs, but also to apply everyone's 
creativity to the problem and come up with a proposal that looks to the future, 
offers an alternative to layoffs and goes beyond knee-jerk protest. 
</P>
<P>
Equity has been the primary principle of concern to the Black Leadership 
Coalition in this budget-reduction process. In other words, we asked ourselves 
the question: "Is this a fair process and are the results equitable?" On the 
basis of our historic understanding of racial and economic justice, we 
concluded no, in each instance. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the composition of the district's workforce, the current board 
proposed budget cuts will have a major impact on workers of color. An injury to 
one is an injury to all--this is a basic tenet of the American labor movement. 
Major unions representing Los Angeles school employees should live up to this 
principle by working toward a more equitable resolution of this budget crisis. 
Even though United Teachers-Los Angeles felt that it could not support our 
proposals, as the most influential bargaining unit in the district, it has a 
major responsibility in this regard. Such a move would strengthen the position 
of all employee unions--showing an unequivocal concern for the well-being of 
the children, enhancing their public image as caring organizations, and giving 
them a powerful moral position from which to continue good-faith bargaining in 
the future. The district will owe them one. 
</P>
<P>
The major players--board members, administrators, unions, parents, students and 
the community--representing all ethnic groups in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District have an unprecedented opportunity to come together for the children.

BASEBALL: ROYCE CLAYTON, A FIRST-ROUND DRAFT CHOICE OF THE GIANTS IN 1988, IS 
LIVING UP TO EXPECTATIONS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former St. Bernard High shortstop Royce Clayton, who had the game-winning hit 
in the California League All-Star Game at San Bernardino last week, is one of 
baseball's hottest commodities in his third year as a professional. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Lacy, an agent and former major league player with Baltimore, Pittsburgh 
and the Dodgers, is one of many baseball people intrigued by Clayton's 
potential. After watching Clayton, 20, hit a home run for the Class-A San Jose 
Giants June 12 in a game at Bakersfield, Lacy made a point of introducing 
himself to the 6-foot, 185-pound shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, Royce, I'm Lee Lacy," he said. "You looked good tonight, you can really 
swing the bat." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Davis, a former Dodger outfielder who signed with San Jose after being 
released by Los Angeles last season, was putting away his bats outside the 
clubhouse at Sam Lynn Ballpark. "Royce can play, can't he, Mike?" Lacy asked. 
</P>
<P>
"You bet he can," Davis said. "Just wish we had a few more like him." 
</P>
<P>
Lacy continued to sell his services as an agent to Clayton. 
</P>
<P>
"That was your first?" Lacy asked Clayton while his associate handed the young 
player a business card. "That's OK, they come in bunches, don't they, Mike? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, you don't have an agent yet? Well, nice to meet you, Royce, and think 
about joining us, OK?" 
</P>
<P>
Clayton, as much as any young prospect in the California League, is used to 
getting a lot of attention. The right-hander was the San Francisco Giants' 
first-round draft choice in 1988 and the 15th player taken overall. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants are pleased with his development. San Jose Manager Tom Spencer said 
that Clayton is a better player at this stage of his career than the Chicago 
Cubs' Shawon Dunston was at a similar point. 
</P>
<P>
"I was with the Cubs' organization and was with Shawon Dunston in the minors 
when he was about the same age as Royce," Spencer said. "'And there's no 
question in my mind that Royce is more advanced than Dunston was at a similar 
stage. Royce is the type of player that you just naturally focus on when you're 
watching a game." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Giants managed only a third-place finish (33-38) in the first half 
in the California League's Northern Division, Clayton enjoyed individual 
success. He hit .252 (fourth best on the team), drove in 34 runs (tied for 
third on the team) and stole a team-high 14 bases. His slugging percentage for 
the first half of the season was .367 and his on-base percentage was .357. His 
hitting prowess and solid play on defense earned him a starting position in the 
All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
He responded by singling in the go-ahead run in the sixth inning as the North 
Division defeated the South Division, 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
As a rookie in the Northwest League at Everett, Wash., in 1988, Clayton hit 
.259 and stole 10 bases in 60 games. Last year, he hit only .236 with 28 steals 
in 104 games at Clinton, Iowa, a Midwest League team in low single-A. He was 
moved up to San Jose, but hit a disappointing .120 with 10 steals in 28 games. 
</P>
<P>
Clayton is a different player in 1990. He attributes the turnaround to his 
upbringing in Inglewood, which has enabled him to endure the tough times. 
</P>
<P>
"I got off to a really rough start (at Clinton) and had to battle back to get 
my average where it ended up," Clayton said. "And then things were tough at San 
Jose, too. 
</P>
<P>
"But I've adapted well. And I give all the credit to my parents. We have a 
strong family. I never feel like they're far away from me." 
</P>
<P>
Besides his parents, Antoinette and Royal, Clayton has a brother, Royal Jr., 
24, a former UC Riverside star and a pitcher for the Albany (N.Y.) Colony 
Yankees in the double-A Eastern League. Like his brother, Royal Jr. will 
participate in the league's All-Star Game (Monday at London, Ontario). 
</P>
<P>
Royal is 5-5 with a 3.47 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
"I got the call from my mom that (Royce) made All-Stars too, and I felt a lot 
of pride," Royal Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
Royce's relationship with Royal Jr. has developed the past several years into 
one of mutual respect. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been telling me I can play a little bit for the first time ever," said 
Royce, who signed a letter of intent with USC but never attended college. "In 
high school, I could go 4 for 5, but I'd come home and he'd say, 'But you 
didn't knock in that run,' or something like that. 
</P>
<P>
"He was tough on me, but it helped push me. One time we were playing together 
when I got a bad bounce and the ball hit me square in the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
"I was bleeding a little bit and I think a couple teeth were a little loose. I 
was thinking maybe I'd have to leave the game, but he said, 'You're not going 
anywhere.' 
</P>
<P>
"And I stayed in and finished the game. Things like that helped me a lot. 
</P>
<P>
"And I'm really happy for the success he's having. Because of our age 
difference, we were apart a lot as kids, but every year we get closer and 
closer." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Royal greatly admires his brother. "He liked to play with me and 
other older guys sometimes, so it was tough on him, but I never wanted him to 
give up or make excuses," Royal said. 
</P>
<P>
"When he got hit by the ball that time I told him if he was looking for a way 
out now, he would in the future. Now to see him coming through in the pros, 
it's a good feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Another of Royce's admirers is the Giants' major-league hitting instructor, 
Dusty Baker, another former Dodger outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
"Royce has a lot of pressure on him as a No. 1 pick," Baker said. "But I think 
he's got the makeup -- mental and physical -- to make it here." 
</P>
<P>
Clayton grew up a Dodger fan and once attended a clinic featuring Baker. Royce 
got Baker to autograph a napkin and he keeps the souvenir at his parents' house 
in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Dusty about that when I met him after I signed," Clayton said. "And 
we've developed a special relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a special feeling to have him teaching me after I watched him for so 
long. He's a great hitting coach, so I always look forward to going up to 
Candlestick (Park) to work with him whenever I can." 
</P>
<P>
Clayton feels at home working out at a big-league stadium. He remembers his 
first chance to perform at a major league park: St. Bernard was competing in 
the CIF-Southern Section championships at Dodger Stadium in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember being in the Dodger Stadium clubhouse and feeling a sense of awe," 
Clayton said. "But at the same time, I felt pretty comfortable there. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I belonged. I could picture myself being there in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Clayton might have the potential to be a power hitter despite only five career 
home runs. His first home run of the season was a low line drive to left-center 
field with a man on base. The following night he hit a grand slam. 
</P>
<P>
"I hit a lot balls like that," Clayton said after his first homer. "But at (San 
Jose Municipal Stadium) we have a much bigger field, which is why I have a 
bunch of triples (a league-high seven). 
</P>
<P>
"And I think home runs are overrated anyway -- especially in this league where 
there are so many big parks." 
</P>
<P>
Clayton doesn't want to be a typical light-hitting shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been hitting in some tough luck, but my RBIs are up," Clayton said. "And 
I know I'm capable of driving in some runs." 
</P>
<P>
Clayton struck out 64 times in the first half of the season, but he isn't 
overly concerned. When asked if the Giants' organization wants him to cut down 
on his strikeouts to take better advantage of his speed, he said: "Not to the 
point where I'm a Punch-and-Judy hitter. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, when I make contact, I usually make good, solid 
contact. I'm not just trying to slap the ball around. 
</P>
<P>
"I like having men on base . . . you see a lot better pitches and pitchers make 
a lot more mistakes. It puts me in the driver's seat; it gets me going." 
</P>
<P>
San Jose Manager Spencer said: "He's one of the most intense hitters I've ever 
seen with men on base. The look on his face tells you how badly he wants to 
drive in runs." 
</P>
<P>
Spencer believes Clayton can become a major leagues player. 
</P>
<P>
"His talent makes him stand out from everyone else on the field," he said. 
"He's an exciting player because of his total package of skills." 
</P>
<P>
Clayton knows he has talent. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I have an above-average arm that enables me to step in the hole and 
make a good throw," he said. "As far as range is concerned, that's more natural 
than anything -- it's instincts." 
</P>
<P>
Clayton said getting to know the opposing players in the California League has 
improved his play defensively. 
</P>
<P>
"Against guys that I know can run a little bit, I'll cheat in," he said. 
"Against guys that pull the ball, I'll shade over to the hole." 
</P>
<P>
Clayton said there is not a big difference between high school and Class-A 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest difference is mental," he said. "But actually now I'm getting to 
the point where it feels like high school -- where I'm getting myself out as 
much as the pitchers are getting me out. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like I'm overmatched. Now, when I make outs, a lot of times I'm just 
hitting the ball hard at somebody." 
</P>
<P>
Clayton said he learned from the difficulties he endured in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking back, it was definitely a positive," he said. "A lot of guys will get 
to the big leagues without ever struggling before, and they won't know how to 
react when they get into a slump. They've never been through anything like 
that. At least, I can say I have the experience of fighting out of something 
like that." 
</P>
<P>
Clayton's role model is Cincinnati shortstop Barry Larkin, although St. Louis' 
Ozzie Smith also rates favorably. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a Dodger fan and really liked Davey Lopes and Bill Russell, basically 
the old Dodgers," he said. "But when they started making a lot of moves, I lost 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
"And Ozzie was always a guy I could look up to -- there's just nobody that can 
do what he does -- and I'm still looking forward to meeting him someday. In 
fact, my room at home was like an Ozzie Smith museum." 
</P>
<P>
Clayton said the struggles of day-to-day life in the minor leagues are 
overrated. 
</P>
<P>
"That's always a question, but it's not always that bad or so tough, even on 
the road," Clayton said.

EX-RACER GOES FROM BICYCLES TO THREE-PIECE SUITS AND A BRIEFCASE; 
</P>
<P>
BUSINESS: CYCLING GOLD MEDALIST MARK GORSKI SWITCHES GEARS AND STARTS A NEW 
CAREER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year ago, Mark Gorski's working wardrobe was spandex shorts, skintight 
jerseys and funny looking shoes with large front cleats. His equipment was a 
custom-made bicycle with no brakes, built for speed. 
</P>
<P>
Today he wears business suits, drives an expensive car and carries a briefcase. 
</P>
<P>
He used to talk about 50-tooth gears and 200-meter intervals. Now he discusses 
investment parameters and trust portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
Until last fall he was America's most decorated sprint cyclist, an Olympic gold 
medalist and a celebrity on the velodrome circuit. Now he's a retired athlete 
in his rookie year in investment management. 
</P>
<P>
He appears to have landed on a winning team. Gorski, 30, is one of three former 
athletes hired for Wells Fargo Bank's Asset Management Division, a group of 14 
people throughout California handling large-asset investments for groups and 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Where he used to spend his days cycling from Newport Beach to the Olympic 
Velodrome at Cal State Dominguez Hills for sprint workouts, Gorski now drives 
the South Bay area from Long Beach to Marina del Rey, or puts in long hours at 
his desk at Wells Fargo Center in downtown Los Angeles, selling potential 
investors on his company's program. 
</P>
<P>
Gorski competed in his last race in October, in the international NEC 
Invitational at the Olympic Velodrome. He planned to continue racing into this 
summer's Goodwill Games, next year's Pan Am Games and maybe the '92 Olympics, 
but an odd premonition came over him that weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I wasn't going anywhere in the sport," he said. "I had a hard time 
motivating myself. I wasn't even nervous before races. That was a bad sign. As 
we were leaving for the race this really strange feeling came over me and I 
told my wife, 'I think this is gonna be my last race.' It really surprised 
her." 
</P>
<P>
It was prophetic as well. Gorski hung up his cycling shoes, and began looking 
around for business opportunities. As one of the sport's few spokesmen with 
viable sponsors, he considered positions associated with the business side of 
cycling. 
</P>
<P>
Through a friend of a friend he met at the 1984 Olympics, Gorski was introduced 
to the Wells Fargo group and did well in what he describes as a rigorous 
interview process. 
</P>
<P>
Now Gorski is busy finding and advising investors, learning on the job and 
continuing to think big. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been on the job from Day One. There was no real training," he said. "I 
see a wide variety of people. It's important to be credible, professional, 
accommodating. If you come in as a slick salesman you're not gonna get 
anywhere. What it's all about is pushing yourself, making as much contact as 
possible and providing ongoing service. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking for something with unlimited upward potential, where the amount 
of time you put into it, the better you do. Like sports. I'm only now beginning 
to appreciate what athletics gives you -- self-confidence, the ability to deal 
with pressure, those kinds of things." 
</P>
<P>
The way had been paved for Gorski by two former pro football players in the 
Asset Management Division, Bill Ring and Paul McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
Ring, 33, who retired from the San Francisco 49ers in 1987, has become the 
top-earning salesman in the division. Ring had been preparing for a financial 
career while playing football, working in investment firms during the 
off-season. His success prompted Wells Fargo to hire his friend, former USC 
quarterback Paul McDonald, straight out of the NFL last year. McDonald has 
risen to the division's No. 2 revenue producer. 
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old McDonald, one of the long line of quarterbacks who came out of 
Bishop Amat High in the 1970s, works the Orange County area and, Gorski said, 
has been something of a mentor to him. 
</P>
<P>
"I came in absolutely cold," McDonald said. "A lot of our colleagues had horror 
story after horror story about losing their money (while playing) through bad 
investments, agents who made bad decisions. The impetus was the idea of helping 
players with investments. Bill shared the same concerns about athletes and we 
had a few conversations about the direction I could take." 
</P>
<P>
McDonald was looking at another job when Ring persuaded him to talk to his 
supervisor at Wells Fargo, Art Rutzen. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought a bank could do a good job in that arena," McDonald said. "I 
was pleasantly surprised." 
</P>
<P>
And he was hired. 
</P>
<P>
Rutzen, a former wrestler, said he had no qualms about hiring untrained jocks. 
"I made the transition from athlete to Wall Street. All that extra work and 
drive transferred over," he said. "I look for intrinsics in people, not 
substantive knowledge. Show me somebody who's a superstar in one arena and 
obviously intelligent, and they can be a superstar in another arena. Especially 
(athletes), who make it on heart, not just talent. They'll sublimate all that 
drive that they put into winning a gold medal or a Super Bowl into a new 
arena." 
</P>
<P>
Rutzen, a senior vice president, said that his division accounts for about 10% 
of Wells Fargo's profits -- which were $700 million in the last fiscal year -- 
and that it is the fastest-growing profit area of the bank, with the prospect 
of continuing to grow. 
</P>
<P>
Rutzen said Gorski has fit right in. "He's going great guns. He hit this with a 
bang," Rutzen said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorski, who had done a fair amount of marketing and sales work with his cycling 
sponsors and had dabbled in real estate as well, was probably better suited for 
his new career than most athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think for the majority it's intimidating to leave your circle and start at 
the bottom," he said. "There were times I've wondered what I was doing. It 
wasn't easy. But I'm glad I gave it a shot. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been great having guys like McDonald and Ring to talk to. Paul came cold 
to the business. I think there were some raised eyebrows (when he was hired). 
The fact he's been so successful speaks well of Art and really helped me." 
</P>
<P>
As an articulate and attractive spokesman, Gorski has long been one of the best 
salesmen for cycling in general and for the track tour's sponsors as well. He 
remains a member of the U.S. Cycling Federation board and could have continued 
to make a living in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
But while road racers -- notably Tour de France hero Greg Lemond -- have gained 
wide acclaim, track cyclists continue to struggle for backing and recognition. 
</P>
<P>
It hit home for Gorski when his 7-year-old son, Alex -- who took a victory lap 
on his father's shoulder in the 1984 Olympics -- told him he'd like to be 
called "Ryne" -- as in baseball star Ryne Sandberg. 
</P>
<P>
"Track racing is going through a tough time," Gorski said. "Most of the quality 
guys are on the road -- and they've turned pro. Guys are not staying amateur 
very long. There are so many more opportunities as a road rider. If I were 
coming up now, with the way they're changing Olympic rules and amateur rules, I 
don't think I'd stay amateur very long. The major sponsors have dropped their 
sponsorship. It's an exciting sport but it just hasn't come as far as I hoped. 
I can't explain it." 
</P>
<P>
Gorski, who competed from his early teens, said that for a while it was 
difficult not to work out. Most of his exercise now is limited to weekends, 
riding in the Newport Beach area where he lives with his wife, Mary, and 
children Alex and Kate, 3. 
</P>
<P>
"It took some getting used to," he said. "The first couple months (away from 
competition) was like withdrawal. It took some getting used to. I'd had a 
routine for a long time. But I don't miss all the travel. While I was cycling I 
was away -- a lot. Now I may work long hours, but I see my family every day." 
</P>
<P>
Gorski stays in touch with other velodrome veterans and misses the camaraderie 
of riding. 
</P>
<P>
"The sport has been great to me," he said. "I wouldn't trade the experience for 
anything.

UNMASKING ART; 
</P>
<P>
ISABEL DIAMOND'S WORK MIXES HER LATINO HERITAGE WITH EXPRESSIONS OF MANY 
CULTURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
First, the moral of the story: Never take a mask at face value. 
</P>
<P>
A procession of masks used to drive Isabel Camacho Diamond to hide from the 
annual Lent festivals in the Costa Rican village where she grew up. 
</P>
<P>
But now another crowd of masks has delivered Diamond and several of her recent 
works to the galleries of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
"To me," Diamond said, "a mask is a way of transforming one's self. We use them 
every day. . . . I think if we took our masks off, we wouldn't recognize 
ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Diamond, 56, has been an artist for more than 30 years, the last two in 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
And her work is beginning to win attention in galleries and museums. 
</P>
<P>
On June 7, the Los Angeles Southwest College Campus Art Gallery concluded a 
dual exhibition that paired Diamond's works with pieces from Joe Bastida 
Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
And on Aug. 3, five pieces of Diamond's work will go on display in the rental 
and sales gallery of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, along with pieces 
from seven other Latino or black artists from Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit, "L.A. Expressions: The Cultural Shift," was organized by the 
museum's Community Resource Advisory Committee, and will run through Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone told me about her work. So I called her and asked to see some slides," 
said Cecil Fergerson, curator of the exhibit. "But she loaded all these 
paintings into a van, drove down, and brought them into my studio. I took one 
look at them, and I was very impressed." 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Fergerson liked the way Diamond uses bold colors and geometric 
shapes, uniting the influences of various cultures with her Latino heritage. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing I love about Isabel," Fergerson said, "is she works all the time. If 
she walks out in her garden and sees a rock that looks like a head, she'll put 
some eyes in it." 
</P>
<P>
Which helps explain Diamond's hillside Ventura home, where masks, paintings and 
sculptures lie on the lawn, dangle in the patio and stand like sentries at the 
staircase. 
</P>
<P>
"As you see," said the artist, mid-stride, "I can't keep still." 
</P>
<P>
Diamond was born in Costa Rica, where each year on the Sunday before Lent, the 
faithful would climb into elaborate masks and costumes. 
</P>
<P>
At 14, she moved with her father to New Orleans, the home of Mardi Gras and all 
manner of spooky disguises. Then came New York, and long and various succession 
of exotic residences and trips -- Iran, Spain, Lebanon, France, Haiti. In 
Pakistan, Diamond took up art and found herself reworking the powerful 
iconography that results when Catholic ceremony mingles with folk culture. 
</P>
<P>
She moved to Ventura in 1988 with civil engineer Dale Diamond, her husband of 
11 years. 
</P>
<P>
One piece she will show at the L.A. County exhibit includes a bearded man, his 
face cast in clay, broken and reassembled. The face was mournful to begin with. 
Now a fissure runs down it beneath his right eye, suggesting the path of a tear 
or the line of a passing shadow. 
</P>
<P>
"I was testing myself," said Diamond, standing beneath the face. "It's OK to 
make something beautiful. But are you good enough to break it and pull 
something stronger from it?" 
</P>
<P>
Maureen Davidson, executive director of the Ventura Arts Council, met Diamond 
in 1988, as Davidson was putting together the council's Momentum Gallery on 
Palm Street. 
</P>
<P>
Davidson's gallery walls were bare, but Diamond came in anyway and, Davidson 
recalls, "kind of demanded to know what the heck we were doing." 
</P>
<P>
Davidson wanted the first exhibit to be untraditional and strong. 
</P>
<P>
She saw Diamond's work, and plans were hatched for the show that opened the 
Momentum Gallery in May, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, Davidson said, Diamond's remains the most emotionally 
provocative show the gallery has hung. 
</P>
<P>
"The comment that I always remember came from this one irate person," said 
Davidson. "He said, 'This is the religion of the ugly.' " 
</P>
<P>
"My work is religious," Diamond said. "And it deals also with relationships and 
communication, or the lack of it. As you know, human beings aren't very good at 
communicating . . . not to other countries, and not to other people." 
</P>
<P>
Diamond has all manner of plans for communication. When she first moved to this 
area two years ago, she was appalled by the litter on beaches. She started 
gathering it into waterfront installations, complete with anti-litter messages. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Diamond turned her attention to drug abuse and produced a cautionary 
canvas that shows a gray-fleshed, drug-sick mother struggling to keep hold of 
her child. Diamond is looking for a public agency interested in displaying the 
work. 
</P>
<P>
And recently, Diamond started a large semi-abstract painting with an 
environmental theme, beginning with a tangle of black strokes suggestive of an 
oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
But as they did with the bearded man's mask, her instincts are threatening to 
overthrow her original plans. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond hangs the paint-spattered, 10-foot-high canvas in her living room and 
surveys it from a healthy distance. 
</P>
<P>
Black foreground, peach strokes, a smear of red and purple that might be a 
tropical fish . . . 
</P>
<P>
"See that old man in there?" Diamond asked suddenly. "There's an old, old man 
in there, saying he wants to come out. So now I look at it, and it dictates to 
me what I must do to it."

AFTER $3.5-MILLION DEAL WITH BEARS, HE'S STILL MARK FROM POLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Carrier, although he is now rich, was not lounging by a country-club pool. 
He was sweating on a searing field at Long Beach Poly High School. 
</P>
<P>
On scruffy grass outside the locker rooms, Carrier, 22, sprinted forward and 
backward, then high-stepped through a maze of pylons as he prepared for a 
football career with the Chicago Bears, who will pay him more than $3.5 million 
over five years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost like I never left," he said. "Kids who go to Poly now see me and 
it's no big deal to them. I get treated the same. They know I'm still Mark." 
</P>
<P>
In the distance was Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue and, in the haze beyond, 
Signal Hill. It was a view permanently imprinted on his retinas, so he did not 
need to look. 
</P>
<P>
A lifelong resident of the inner-city neighborhood around the school at 1600 
Atlantic Ave., Carrier was 7 and a Pop Warner player when he first stepped onto 
the Poly football field. He was a star safety and a campus hero at Poly in the 
mid-1980s and then went to USC, where he became an All-American. 
</P>
<P>
Now, after deciding to forgo a final college season, he will go on to Chicago. 
"We needed somebody who will turn some heads," Bears Coach Mike Ditka had 
explained in April when asked why the Bears drafted Carrier in the first round 
(the sixth pick, overall). "This kid will turn your head. If you don't watch 
where you're going, he'll knock it off." 
</P>
<P>
In three years at USC he had 336 tackles and 13 interceptions and, as a junior 
last season, won the Jim Thorpe Award as the nation's best defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had a kid fulfill his potential the way Mark has fulfilled his," 
said Jerry Jaso, co-head coach at Poly. 
</P>
<P>
Carrier fits the Bears' tough, aggressive image, but off the field remains the 
affable model of good behavior he was at Poly. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark is a very down-to-earth kid and he works hard to stay that way," said his 
mother, Marie Carrier. "He's still the same. I don't think he'll ever change." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the 20 pounds of muscle he has added to the 6-foot-1, 175-pound frame he 
had in high school, Carrier has not changed noticeably, even in light of sudden 
wealth. 
</P>
<P>
"He's more mature, but he's the same nice well-mannered kid," said Thomas 
Whiting, Poly's other co-coach. 
</P>
<P>
Carrier, too, detects no alteration: 
</P>
<P>
"I act the same way and carry about the same amount of money in my wallet that 
I did before I got paid by the Bears. A lot of my friends give me a hard time 
because they see me dress the same way and act the same way. 
</P>
<P>
"We sit here and make bets, and I bet $5 and if I lose I get mad and they look 
at me like I'm crazy. After I signed, a lot of people came up to me and said I 
would have a new car, a luxury wardrobe and buy my mom a house. All that wasn't 
really needed. I have a car that works fine, and my mom lives comfortably. I 
just take care of her bills for her." 
</P>
<P>
Carrier, who leaves for the Bears' rookie camp early next month, lives in a 
condominium on Ohio Avenue in Signal Hill with his mother and two sisters, 
Lynn, 24, and Rhonda, 23. 
</P>
<P>
"I still sleep on the couch," Carrier said. "Nothing's changed; they show no 
mercy on me. They're not going to treat me special because I play for the 
Bears." 
</P>
<P>
Marie Carrier, an occupational safety and health manager at the Long Beach 
Naval Shipyard, said she plans no changes in her lifestyle, either. "People ask 
why am I still working? I used to work for them (her children). We had to 
divide the money four ways. Now my paycheck is my paycheck. That's important to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Although her son's bank account has enlarged dramatically, his head has not. 
She would not allow it anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"If I see him getting out of hand, I'll call it to his attention," she said. 
</P>
<P>
It has always been difficult to envision Carrier getting out of hand. "He's a 
guy you'd want to bring home to Mom," said Tim Tessalone, USC sports 
information director. 
</P>
<P>
Carrier, who redshirted in 1986 because of a broken foot, would have been a 
fifth-year senior this fall at USC. He worried about his decision to turn pro 
because he said he has a "binding agreement" with his mother that he will 
finish his education. 
</P>
<P>
"For me to leave school, I had to show her that I was not a year away (from 
graduating)," he said. "I'm right there, but I had an opportunity that I didn't 
think was going to come around again, so I took it." 
</P>
<P>
He plans to return to USC next January and take the three classes he needs to 
graduate in May with a degree in communications. 
</P>
<P>
But what he anticipates the most now is the start of his pro career and 
especially the home opener Sept. 9 against Seattle at Soldier Field. "I can't 
wait to put my Bear uniform on and run through the tunnel," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago already has impressed him. "Big, very big city," he said with his easy 
smile. "I hope to buy a home there in three years and make that my city, but 
Long Beach will always be my home. If I don't have a house here, my mom will. 
Someone will always be here. I just love this city, plus I don't like the 
winters in Chicago, so I'll at least be out here for half the year." 
</P>
<P>
Carrier was told by his family and friends that he could expect resentment from 
some of his former high school teammates because of his sudden fortune, but he 
said he has not experienced any. 
</P>
<P>
"I've run into people I haven't seen in many years and they were as happy for 
me as if they got drafted," he said. "They tell me I deserve everything I got. 
They know how hard I've worked to get where I am." 
</P>
<P>
Carrier's workout partners this week were three childhood buddies and Poly 
alumni -- Alvin Warren, a wide receiver at New Mexico State; Eugene Burkhalter, 
a defensive back at the University of Washington, and Chuckie Miller, a 
defensive back with the Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark has the money, but he wants to show he's worth it," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
During a break, Carrier said: "People know how hard I've worked. I went to 
school and I paid a price. I'm here working out on a hot day, so it's not like 
I'm taking any shortcuts." 
</P>
<P>
The workout continued as the summer afternoon turned into a replica of all the 
others Carrier has known at Poly. As the sun got even hotter, the new pro did 
what he always has: 
</P>
<P>
He sprinted harder.

<P>
SOCCER: DEFENDERS FOR NATIONAL CHAMPION SANTA CLARA WILL BE OPPONENTS FOR FIRST 
TIME IN UPCOMING OLYMPIC FESTIVAL.

<P>
Everyone knew about Cam Rast. The Simi Valley product had not only led Royal 
High to a state soccer championship, he had played a big part in the Under-19 
U.S. national team's rise to the semifinals of the Youth World Cup in Saudi 
Arabia in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually every college coach in the country wanted Cam Rast in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Almost everyone knew about Matt Rast. Cam's twin generally was regarded as a 
better player than his brother until he tore a ligament in his knee in August, 
1985. The fullback underwent reconstructive surgery, took a year off to 
rehabilitate his knee and wore a brace for his final two years of high school 
soccer. 
</P>
<P>
Few college coaches, it seemed, wanted Matt in their programs as much as they 
wanted Cam. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers, both of whom will compete in the U.S. Olympic Festival in 
Minneapolis next month, had decided long before college recruiters came calling 
that they wanted to attend the same school. Little did they know what ugly 
possibilities could lie behind such a decision. 
</P>
<P>
"Some coaches made it clear to Matt that they would take him just to get 
Cameron, that he would get no playing time," said Patty Ally, mother of the two 
college juniors. "Then they would call me and say that Matt was just dividing 
the scholarship package. Cameron could get the whole package or it would just 
be divided in two. 
</P>
<P>
"Matt felt bad about it and the way he was treated made it worse." 
</P>
<P>
While other schools said they would take both, Santa Clara Coach Steve Sampson 
gave strong indications that he wanted both. 
</P>
<P>
"All along, I was recruiting both together or each as individuals," Sampson 
said. "Despite Matt's injury, I felt he had the potential to be one of the 
better players in the country. I made it clear that I wasn't recruiting Matt 
because he was Cam's brother. I was interested in Matt independent of Cam. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of coaches ignored Matt Rast's ability." 
</P>
<P>
It turned out to be shrewd recruiting by Sampson. 
</P>
<P>
Both players figured prominently this past season for national champion Santa 
Clara. Cam, an All-American selection as a sophomore, scored 11 goals and 
dished out eight assists from his sweeper position. Matt, meanwhile, 
contributed three goals and two assists as a center back and was named most 
improved player on the team. 
</P>
<P>
So Cam, already a member of the U.S. Olympic team, is still the star. He will 
play in the Olympic Festival as a member of the East team, which features seven 
players on the U.S. Olympic team. Matt, one of 30 players given an outside 
chance of making the Olympic team, will play for the West. 
</P>
<P>
When the twins go head to head in one of the Twin Cities, it will mark the 
first time since they started playing soccer at age 7 that they will have 
played on opposing teams. 
</P>
<P>
If their mother had her way, she probably would red-card Festival organizers. 
During a practice at Royal, it was Cameron who delivered the fateful kick that 
jeopardized Matt's career. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always been a rule, ever since they were little, that they not play 
against each other," Ally said. "Because when one boy won, the other one lost. 
I told them to tell the Olympic (Festival) Committee that their mom didn't like 
them being on opposing teams," she said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, many agree that Matt was the better player at one time. And 
could be again. 
</P>
<P>
"Matt struggled for a while with whether or not he still had the talent," Ally 
said, "while Cameron has always known that Matt has the talent. Maybe a little 
more than he did." 
</P>
<P>
Sampson said that even though Cam, a member of the Olympic team since January 
of this year, is a "solid member" of the squad, Matt could soon elevate his 
play to a level higher than that of his brother. 
</P>
<P>
"Cam would have to play poorly for a long period of time" to lose his position 
on the Olympic squad, Sampson said. "Knowing Cam, that won't happen. And Matt 
has surpassed the level that he was at before the injury." 
</P>
<P>
While Cam has called soccer "his life" and plans to stick with it in some 
regard for as long as he can, Matt does not see a future in it beyond his last 
couple of years in college. That is, "unless something really special happens." 
</P>
<P>
The start of that could be in Minneapolis in a couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Then, will everybody want the Rast brothers?

People crowd into Chris Pezzulo's express line -- "the prison" as she calls it 
-- at a Lomita supermarket. Although she is fighting a cold, she taps the 
electronic cash register and whittles through throngs of late afternoon 
shoppers at a rapid pace. 
</P>
<P>
An All-American goalkeeper at Cal State Dominguez Hills, Pezzulo has always 
been in a whirlwind of activities. At times she has paid the price with her 
health, but now that fast-paced lifestyle might be jeopardizing her soccer 
career. 
</P>
<P>
"I live this life of pressure all the time," she said. "My friends tell me that 
I need to slow down and (that's why) I am sick all the time because I'm pushing 
myself to the limit all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Her financial problems and refusal to cut back on visits to local dance clubs 
have left little time for training, although the start of fall soccer practice 
is only seven weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
"She has done nothing," said Coach Marine Cano of the senior goalkeeper. "She 
isn't training and I'm telling you this right now, it's going to be very hard 
for her. I have two other goalkeepers coming in. She better get it together 
quick." 
</P>
<P>
Said Pezzulo: "A lot of time I'll push myself, then I slack off. It takes 
Marine to get on me to get me going again." 
</P>
<P>
Pezzulo set school season records of 15 shutouts and 18 victories and was named 
to the All-NCAA tournament team after making a fantastic one-on-one save in the 
Lady Toros' 1-0 loss to Keene State of New Hampshire in the Division II Final 
Four. Dominguez Hills (18-3) was the top-ranked team on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Pezzulo has gained 20 pounds in the off-season and has not touched a ball in a 
month. She does not make excuses. 
</P>
<P>
"I got lazy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She has also been distracted by personal problems, mostly financial. After 
graduating from Narbonne High in 1986, she moved out of the family home in 
Lomita. She enrolled at El Camino College and played soccer there, paying her 
own tuition. But school, sports and finding a job became big burdens, and 
Pezzulo discovered that it was difficult to stay ahead of bill collectors. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a credit card-aholic," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mounting debts and problems with roommates forced her to swallow some pride and 
move back into the family home this month. It wasn't the outcome she was 
looking for when she left, but at least, she says, it is the means by which she 
can pay the bills and get her mind back on soccer. She doesn't plan to stay at 
home long. 
</P>
<P>
"I pretty much got myself out of (financial trouble) now," she said. "I haven't 
charged much for a while. I had to learn the hard way. But I think it has made 
me a better person." 
</P>
<P>
Pezzulo says her visits to dance clubs allow her to escape, although she says 
she just likes to dance, not drink or smoke. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to fit in a social life," she said. "Because if I don't fit in that 
social time, I'll go nuts. I need to have that time for my friends to go out 
dancing or whatever I just have to do." 
</P>
<P>
She is also a racewalker. In April, Pezzulo, 23, finished first in the under-29 
category in the Los Angeles Marathon, besting her 27-year-old sister, Lisa, by 
30 minutes. Lisa had won that category the previous two years. 
</P>
<P>
Pezzulo, who trains by walking the streets of Lomita and the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula with light weights strapped to her arms, took up racewalking three 
years ago after a collision with an opponent in front of the goal at El Camino 
broke a small bone in her back. Pezzulo missed most of her sophomore season 
because of the injury and walking was the only exercise she could get. 
</P>
<P>
She contends that walk-training keeps her in shape to return to the soccer 
field. Cano, a professional goalie with the Los Angeles Heat, isn't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
"Aerobics and running and walking are fine," he said. "But she needs to get out 
in goal and train. She hasn't been doing that." 
</P>
<P>
Cano's concern is twofold. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year we elevated the level of the program, and this year I will maintain 
that, as far as our schedule is concerned," he said. "She better be ready 
because we will have to work extremely hard to get some results." 
</P>
<P>
Cano says three of the team's four defenders, the players who often cleared the 
ball away from the net so Pezzulo would not be challenged, have completed their 
eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
Said Pezzulo: "Mentally, I think I'm ready for this. I realize I lost my back 
four that did support me 200%. They saved my butt a lot of times. But I do have 
the ability to (stop shots) on my own, as well. I have the potential to be a 
great goalkeeper." 
</P>
<P>
At Narbonne, Pezzulo was the starting goalie on the boys' varsity soccer team, 
but she decided to quit playing soccer after the back injury at El Camino. 
Pezzulo earned an associate of arts degree, took the checker's job at the 
supermarket and earned enough money to take a long cruise. 
</P>
<P>
In August, two weeks before the collegiate season began, she received a call 
from Cano. He needed a goalie. 
</P>
<P>
"He was pretty desperate, to be honest," she said. "Someone had given him my 
name. I thought it would be a good opportunity to get back into the sport and 
also to get back into school." 
</P>
<P>
Despite missing all of the preseason two-a-day practices, Pezzulo started in 
goal in the Lady Toro opener Sept. 5 and shut out United States International 
University, 2-0. She went on to allow only two goals in her first 11 games, but 
after the loss to Keene State, Pezzulo lost intensity. 
</P>
<P>
"I started out in the off-season matches and players were scoring on me left 
and right," she said. "Right after the regular season ended we started with our 
Sunday league and Marine was very disappointed in me and I was disappointed in 
me. I think I took it very lax." 
</P>
<P>
Pezzulo, who says she will start summer conditioning with some of her returning 
teammates July 6, says she wishes she could have the past sixth months back. 
</P>
<P>
"I really regret going into that with a bad attitude," she said. "I'm kicking 
myself for it, but unfortunately, you can't take it back."

HARRIS ON UPSWING, SEARCHING FOR NO. 1; 
</P>
<P>
TRACK AND FIELD: HURDLER FADED OUT OF THE 400-METER PICTURE THREE YEARS AGO 
AFTER ENDING EDWIN MOSES' WINNING STREAK AT 107. NOW, HE IS UNDEFEATED AND HAS 
THE WORLD'S BEST TIME THIS YEAR. 
</P>

<P>
The scene at UC Irvine's track stadium last week was as it usually is each 
summer morning -- tranquil, serene, unhurried, and amid these quiet 
surroundings world-class hurdler Danny Harris focuses on his world-class 
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be ranked No. 1 in the world this year," said Harris, 24. "And I 
want it bad." 
</P>
<P>
Six years ago at the Olympic Games in Los Angeles, Harris became an Olympic 
silver medalist at 18 when he finished second to Edwin Moses in the 400-meter 
intermediate hurdles. Three years later, Harris gained more notoriety when he 
ended Moses' decade-long, 107-race winning streak at a meet in Madrid, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
But since, Harris, who had once been described as the heir apparent to Moses' 
impressive legacy, has met disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
At the 1988 U.S. Olympic trials, Harris finished fifth in the 400 hurdles -- 
missing the U.S. team by two places. And in 1989, after moving from Ames, Iowa, 
to Santa Monica, Harris had his worst season. 
</P>
<P>
But now, Harris, a three-time NCAA champion from Iowa State who moved to Irvine 
last fall, is on an upswing. 
</P>
<P>
With a 48.3-second victory at Sao Paulo, Brazil, May 20; a 47.62 at Seville, 
Spain, May 30; and a 47.77 at Madrid, June 6, Harris is undefeated and leads 
the world with the three fastest times of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's remarkable for anybody -- even Edwin Moses -- to run this fast 
and this consistently this early," said Jon Hendershott of Track &amp; Field 
News. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, a former state hurdles champion from Perris High School, is not quite 
as surprised. Last fall, with a push from his girlfriend, Swedish 800-meter 
runner Maria Akraka, he began a strenuous training program that included 
30-minute runs in the morning and longer-distance track workouts in the 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
For Harris, who usually wouldn't train the last three months of the year, this 
was a significant and successful change. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps more significant was Harris' decision to adjust his attitude after 
the disappointments of '88 and '89. 
</P>
<P>
"(Not making the 1988 Olympic team,) It was trauma of the worst kind," said 
Harris, who re-injured a hamstring in a tuneup race a week before the trials. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, after you've been on an Olympic team -- at 18 -- you know what it 
was like. You know what it's like to get the accolades from the crowd, you know 
what it's like when they announce your name as being an (Olympic) team member, 
you know the process the people go through after you make the team, getting 
their uniforms and getting their gear . . . it's just like (being part of) a 
special little family. 
</P>
<P>
"I was quite depressed after the trials. I thought I had done everything I 
could to prepare myself. . . . For the rest of '88, I ran OK. I ended up the 
season with a 48.04 in Greece. I felt pretty good about that, but the season 
was over. Everybody else was in Seoul and I was in Ames, watching it on TV." 
</P>
<P>
A few months later, Harris decided to leave Ames -- where, competing for Iowa 
State he had been undefeated in collegiate competition from 1984-86 -- to Santa 
Monica, hoping new surroundings might be stimulating. But, away from his coach, 
Steve Lynn, and a structured environment, Harris got worse. 
</P>
<P>
"1989 was a terrible year -- my worst year I ever had," he said. "Not being 
focused, not having a coach, or a set plan . . . I mean, I would go to practice 
some days and some days I would choose not to." 
</P>
<P>
It showed. Harris was ranked only fourth in the world by Track &amp; Field News 
last year, his lowest since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"You know when it comes time to race, and you know how many days you've put 
into practice, well, when you go out there on the track, confidence is 
something that you need in abundance," he said. "You don't need to be 
second-guessing yourself. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I found myself many times on the line getting ready to start a race . . 
. thinking back to that Thursday, those 300s that you missed, wishing you had 
got them down because you know that you'll be needing them here in the next 48 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year I lost some races that there was no way I should have lost. I'd 
never run a 50 (second) race in Europe in my life and I'd never run, I don't 
think, more than three 49s. So to have a season like I had last year, it was . 
. . terrible. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think that was a really big growth period for me. I did a lot of growing 
up as a person, and as an athlete. Because when you have something that's taken 
away from you, I mean you'll do either one of two things. You'll either lie 
down and let it happen to you, or you'll get back up and start fighting back. 
</P>
<P>
"And this is my get-up-and-fight-back year right here." 
</P>
<P>
Harris considers his top threats to be Andre Phillips, 1988 Olympic gold 
medalist who is currently injured, former UCLA star Kevin Young, the world's 
top-ranked intermediate hurdler in 1989, and Jamaica's Winthrop Graham, who won 
the NCAA title last year for Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"That's it," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
But what of the legendary Moses, 34, who still holds the world record at 47.02? 
</P>
<P>
"Edwin? . . . I think for one race, he can still be as good as anyone in the 
world," said Harris, who ran his career-best of 47.48 in finishing second to 
Moses at the 1987 World Championships at Rome. 
</P>
<P>
"In a three-series race, I think (Moses) might have a little bit of tougher 
time, uh, because it's more taxing," Harris said. "But I'd like to see him out 
on the track again. . . . "You know, I never even took a victory lap when I 
beat Edwin. I think from the moment I crossed the finish line, it was like a 
dream. Although I realized what I had done, it wasn't really until the next 
day, flying back, where it really sunk in. I read the paper on the plane, saw 
myself in the paper, but it wasn't really until then that I said, 'Hey you've 
done something good, Danny.' "

ROSTAGNO IN WORLD OF HIS OWN: 3RD ROUND

<P>
One day after he beat John McEnroe, refused to bow to the Royal Box and knew so 
little about his next opponent that he called him "Jeremy who?" Derrick 
Rostagno came back to the All England Club and basically did it all again. 
</P>
<P>
No, Rostagno didn't have McEnroe around any more, but he did beat England's 
best player, Jeremy Bates, in front of a Court 1 crowd cheering on their 
Wimbledon favorite. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, Derrick, you were rattled by the pro-Bates crowd, right? 
</P>
<P>
(Long pause). "You know, I didn't really notice, sorry to say," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rostagno, marching to the beat of a different drummer, possibly the bongos he 
plays, advanced to the third round with a 6-1, 3-6, 6-4, 6-1 victory Wednesday 
over Bates, thereby brightening up an otherwise routine day. 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded West German Boris Becker strode past Aussie Wally Masur, 6-7 
(7-5), 6-2, 6-3, 6-2, and said afterward he isn't bothered that many are 
picking Ivan Lendl to win his first Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't pick him," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
Seventh-seeded Brad Gilbert beat South African qualifier Danie Visser, 5-7, 
6-3, 6-2, 6-2, and joined another American, 21-year-old David Wheaton, in the 
second round. 
</P>
<P>
Wheaton beat Paul Annacone, 6-4, 1-6, 6-4, 6-7 (7-3), 6-4, helped greatly by a 
controversial umpire's ruling. Chair umpire George Grime overruled a call on 
Wheaton's serve and gave him an ace, setting up match point. 
</P>
<P>
Annacone was philosophical: "Anything can happen over here and anything usually 
does." 
</P>
<P>
That would seem to include Rostagno. The 24-year-old from Brentwood, son of 
Juan Rostagno -- a former violinist with the Los Angeles Philharmonic -- 
reached the third round for only the second time. 
</P>
<P>
He dropped the second set to Bates and blamed a natural letdown from his 
first-round victory over McEnroe. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, it's, you know, to come back right away the next day, I knew there 
would be a letdown," Rostagno said. "I tried to get excited to play again, 
which I did." 
</P>
<P>
Although Juan and Helga Rostagno were not in the crowd, Rostagno said he felt 
his parents' presence. 
</P>
<P>
"They are here in spirit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, if there is anything Rostagno himself has, it is spirit. Juan 
Rostagno, a lawyer, said his son sometimes has too much of it. 
</P>
<P>
"He causes me much anxiety," Juan Rostagno said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Rostagno said Derrick worries him with his varied off-court 
activities, such as diving from waterfalls, flying airplanes and riding 
motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
Last winter, he said his son rode a motorcycle from St. Augustine, Fla., to 
Toronto to play in a tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly that was not pleasing me too much," Juan Rostagno said. "I finally 
convinced him to sell his Harley-Davidson. I was very fearful for his life. 
</P>
<P>
"He loves life too much." 
</P>
<P>
Rostagno's parents came to the United States in 1960. Juan is Italian and was 
raised in Buenos Aires. He met Helga, who is German, while he was studying 
music in Paris. Derrick was born in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
At 10, he quit soccer to concentrate on tennis at the Jack Kramer Tennis Club 
in Palos Verdes. Rostagno went on to play tennis at Stanford and studied 
economics but turned professional after his sophomore year. 
</P>
<P>
On the tour, Rostagno has been ranked as low as No. 129, which he is now, and 
as high as No. 35. He has never won a tournament, possibly because he hasn't 
devoted himself exclusively to tennis. 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder sometimes if he put in the dedication to tennis, what he would do," 
Juan Rostagno said. "But his other intents are good for him. They diffuse his 
passion. If he channeled all into tennis, he would probably explode." 
</P>
<P>
Rostagno plays five instruments and until recently, kept a van on both coasts 
to travel to tournaments. A recent article in World Tennis said Rostagno owns a 
Porsche and a 1978 Volkswagen bus covered with bumper stickers. One reads "Dead 
Head." Another reads "No MBA, No Condo, No BMW." Still another reads "Are you 
lost? Such is the human condition." 
</P>
<P>
It seems clear that Rostagno isn't lost on grass. Sure, he can identify Bach's 
"Toccata and Fugue in D Minor" when he hears it, but he also knows how to play 
some pretty fair grass-court tennis. 
</P>
<P>
In the third round, he meets Goran Ivanisevic, a hard-hitting, left-handed 
Yugoslav who reached the quarterfinals of the French Open. As usual, Rostagno 
will appear on court in clothes he bought because he does not have a clothing 
contract. Neither does he have a shoe or racket contract. Rostagno doesn't 
believe in them. 
</P>
<P>
"I just focus on the match and think about playing," Rostagno said. "And that's 
the end of it." 
</P>
<P>
He even sounded as if he believed it. Maybe he did. After all, the van is back 
home.
