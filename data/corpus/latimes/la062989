Expressions of conflicting ideology, even when contained in symbolic speech on 
the fringe of the extreme, deserve protection from government sanction. The 
willingness to allow the free exchange of ideas and philosophy is the core of 
the American democratic process. Any decision other than the courageous and 
honorable one refusing to place off limits the ultimate symbol of our declared 
liberty would have been clearly incorrect.

How inane the reasoning of five Supreme Court justices when they rule that flag 
burning is just another "expression" of free speech as protected by the First 
Amendment to the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
It is one thing to verbally duel at 50 feet with adjectives about Old Glory or 
any other topic, but a world apart from burning the American flag which a 
million or so people have died for during our 213 years of independence.

"Angry Congressmen Vow to Protect Flag" is the headline on your article (Part 
I, June 23) over reactions to the Supreme Court ruling upholding the right of 
dissenters to desecrate the U.S. flag. 
</P>
<P>
Congress already has authority, under the Constitution, to bar the high court 
from ruling on this highly controversial case. Article III, Section 2, of the 
Constitution includes the following language: "The Supreme Court shall have 
appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such exceptions as the 
Congress shall make" (emphasis added). 
</P>
<P>
There it is, in plain language. The Supreme Court is not "supreme" in all 
cases. Congress can make exceptions for some matters that it considers outside 
the jurisdiction of the court. In view of the strong nationwide critical 
reaction to the American flag decision, this would seem the logical time for 
Congress to assert its authority. 
</P>
<P>
That would be a better way to go instead of resorting to the proposed 
constitutional amendment route, which entails the time-consuming requirement of 
approval by three-fourths of the 50 state legislatures. Congress can achieve 
the same objective by prompt action under the Constitution language cited 
above.

The Supreme Court decision to support the freedom of expression and speech 
inherent in the burning of the American flag is clearly going to swell your 
mail bins, and mostly, I suspect with the outcries of the enraged, including 
most "leaders" in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The most ludicrous complaint will be that this somehow demeans the sacrifices 
made by those who "died for our flag." Nonsense! One, hopefully, doesn't die 
for a symbol. The right to have that symbol? Of course. The principle for which 
that symbol stands? Most assuredly. But not for the simple, albeit beautiful 
piece of cloth. 
</P>
<P>
It is ironic, in fact, that the desire of the seeming majority of our citizens 
to allow prosecution of flag burners would cheapen and violate part of our Bill 
of Rights, probably the most important single set of principles that has made 
our country so great. 
</P>
<P>
And, no, I could not, would not, participate in such an act; neither I, nor any 
of those justices who voted to uphold the basic freedom in this issue, support 
or condone the burning of our flag: We support the right to do so. 
</P>
<P>
A simple, but true allegory: My father, Robert R. Rissman, was a partner in the 
'50s and '60s law firm of Wirin, Rissman, and Okrand, the legal representatives 
for the local chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (before it became 
fashionable to be card-carrying members!). A.L. Wirin, as the senior partner, 
fought for and won the right for a local neo-Nazi spokesman to utilize public 
school facilities to spew out his vitriolic messages: As long as he stopped 
short of inciting to riot, it is his right to publicize his point of view, 
however offensive it might be to most of us. But to express his personal 
distaste for the content of that meeting, leading the parade of picketing 
protesters outside the meeting he worked to ensure would convene, was Wirin 
himself: "I support your right to speak; I can't stand the ideas you wish to 
spread" -- principle personified. 
</P>
<P>
If we bemoan the decline of morality in too many our public figures (with 
sorrowful examples from the political and religious right and left), let's take 
pride in and have hope from such acts of principle by our high court, 
epitomizing what this country is truly about.

MUST A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT COME AT THE COST OF JOBS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE PINCETL, Stephanie Pincetl is a lecturer at the UCLA Graduate 
School of Architecture and Urban Planning. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Air Resources Board last week delayed a far-reaching program to fight 
air pollution in Southern California, largely because business leaders raised 
objections about the costs of the program. Virtually every attempt to regulate 
industrial pollution has been countered by industry arguments that such 
regulations will cause the loss of jobs and force firms to move. Yet nearly all 
of the evidence available for the past 20 years has shown that environmental 
regulations have little direct bearing on jobs and business location. The 
situation, in fact, is much more complicated, involving the availability of 
cheap versus skilled labor, the location of markets or linkages with other 
industries. Nevertheless, we continue to hear dire predictions of people losing 
their jobs if we set environmental standards for industry. 
</P>
<P>
Will the new South Coast Air Quality Management District plan hurt our region, 
as critics claim? In the Los Angeles area, both the economy and the population 
(especially Latino) have been growing. But the local economy has become based 
on a two-tier labor force in which the gap between low- and high-income 
populations, often racially defined, has grown wider. Minorities are 
concentrated in the sectors of the economy that have been growing slowly, 
declining or moving out of the country. These are strong trends to which the 
new air quality management plan is mostly incidental. 
</P>
<P>
Though structurally complex, this polarization is the result of economic 
restructuring. In Los Angeles it has several general tendencies. For consumer 
goods, like wood furniture manufacturing, there is intense competition and a 
relatively static market. Firms try to trim their costs of production by 
reducing costs and wages. New environmental regulations may require better 
equipment and retraining, costs that firms would rather avoid. One way to avoid 
it is by relocating to Mexico or another U.S. region. In other types of 
industry, like metal plating, environmental regulations have precipitated the 
restructuring process: Parent firms now are choosing to subcontract these 
activities to avoid the restrictions imposed on them by workplace health- 
and-safety and environmental regulations. The parent firms escape compliance, 
transfering the burden of regulation onto less capitalized and less-informed 
companies that generally employ non-union and often Latino workers. The real 
effect of environmental regulations is to accelerate already existing trends in 
the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Debate about environmental regulation and jobs hides several issues. For one, 
low- income people and disadvantaged minority groups are disproportionately 
employed by industries that use hazardous substances or maintain unsafe work 
environments. Second, low-income and minority people pay more proportionally 
for environmental cleanup, especially clean air. Finally, low-income 
neighborhoods often have the worst air quality and water quality, as in East 
and Central Los Angeles, the East San Fernando Valley and the Southern San 
Gabriel Valley. In their homes as well as at work, these residents and workers 
are the most at risk from industrial pollution and are least insulated from its 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
Saving jobs is often used by employers to justify other objectives, such as 
cutting wages, reducing benefits and destroying neighborhoods, but the bottom 
line is maintaining profit margins. It is ironic that the industries pressuring 
the AQMD to back down from enforcing the Clean Air Act because of the threat of 
job loss are some of the very same industries that, according to most economic 
predictions, are likely to be moving away from Los Angeles in the next 10 years 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in the current economic landscape, a unionized, decently paid work 
force is in jeopardy. This makes low-income and minority communities even more 
vulnerable, since unions have improved standards for workplace safety and job 
security that have trickled down into many non-unionized sectors of the 
economy. As jobs have shifted to non-union work forces, the hazards of the 
whole community have increased. 
</P>
<P>
In casting the proposed AQMD environmental regulations as a clash between jobs 
and the environment, there is an implicit judgment that low-income people care 
less about their health and safety and the ambient quality of their environment 
than others. There is, furthermore, the supposition that as long as industry 
supplies these people jobs, government ought to stay out of the picture. As a 
consequence, implicit assumptions are made that low-income people can continue 
to be exposed to environmental hazards and that, if provided jobs, they will be 
quiet about their work and community conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Whose responsibility is it, then, to make sure that questions of equity and 
justice become part of economic growth and environmental regulation 
considerations? A healthy environment, both at work and at home, has to be a 
right for all, and its costs should not be borne by those least able to afford 
it. It is grossly misleading to perpetuate poor environmental quality both in 
the workplace and in the community for the sake of jobs without questioning the 
basic premises of capital flight. To make jobs and environment a trade-off 
raises not only disturbing social policy questions but also disturbing 
questions about business ethics.

MOBILE MISSILE DEAL IS SHOT FULL OF HOLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK J. GAFFNEY JR., Frank J. Gaffney Jr. was a senior official in the 
Defense Department during the Reagan Administration. This article is adapted 
from a recent paper by the Center for Security Policy, of which he is currently 
director. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration has struck a Faustian bargain with members of Congress 
concerning mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles. In broad outline, the 
deal involves the following: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The executive branch will agree to find almost $1 billion extra from the 
defense budget to invest in the development of the Midgetman ICBM over the next 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Congress is supposed to agree that it will approve the Administration's 
funding request for both a rail-mobile version of the MX and a road-mobile 
Midgetman. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Once that is done, the Administration will abandon the proposal in the 
draft strategic arms reduction treaty that calls for a complete ban on such 
mobile systems, offering instead schemes for constraining the permitted numbers 
of mobile missiles and for verifying such limitations. 
</P>
<P>
This is a political compromise that makes no sense fiscally, strategically or 
in terms of prudent arms control. 
</P>
<P>
Under present and prospective budgetary conditions, mobile missiles -- at 
upwards of $25 billion for the Midgetman and $5 billion for the MX -- are an 
unjustifiable expense. Even if the country could afford to pay for them, it is 
inconceivable that the United States could operate the missiles -- either in a 
rail-based or road-mobile scheme -- in a manner offering levels of 
survivability comparable to those enjoyed by Soviet SS-24s and SS-25s. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the Soviets have some decisive advantages with their mobile 
missiles -- for example, the enormity and barrenness of the country's landmass 
and the absolute priority given to the military in that society. As a result, 
such systems are routinely and realistically exercised in the Soviet 
countryside. By contrast, American mobile missiles, if they can be deployed at 
all, seem certain to be constrained in ways that will impinge on (if not 
eliminate) their benefits. The Air Force plans to deploy the rail-mobile MX 
missiles on its bases, from which they would be dispersed in times of crisis or 
conflict. Unless and until they are dispersed, these missiles would be even 
easier to destroy than if they were left in their present silo launchers. They 
simply could not escape the operating bases in the event of a surprise attack. 
It is even a debatable point whether the nation's political leadership would be 
willing to disperse the MX force onto the rail network in a time of escalating 
tensions but before warning of an actual attack. Such flushing of the missiles 
could be misinterpreted by Moscow as the signal that preparations for a U.S. 
nuclear strike were under way, thereby risking Soviet preemption. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Midgetman may have its own survivability problems. Cost 
considerations would probably preclude significant numbers of these missiles 
from ordinarily being deployed away from their operating bases on U.S. military 
reservations. Missiles not so dispersed would be readily targetable. In other 
words, under any foreseeable circumstances, U.S. investment in an effort to 
mimic Soviet mobile-missile programs is unlikely to produce strategic benefits 
commensurate with the cost in defense resources. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration and congressional supporters of its mobile-missile plan have 
also set the stage for a rout in the arms-control negotiations. The Soviets 
have been put on notice that the United States is not serious about its current 
proposal calling for a complete ban on such missiles. Evidently, in exchange 
for congressional funding commitments that have proven in the past to be 
utterly ephemeral, the Administration has promised that it will, instead, 
introduce a proposal for limits on mobile ICBMs. 
</P>
<P>
There is simply no way to verify such limitations. Over the years, a variety of 
possible solutions to this intractable verification conundrum have been 
considered and found wanting. Were mobile missiles to be permitted under START, 
militarily significant Soviet cheating would be greatly simplified. Mobile 
launchers enable non-deployed and/or covertly stockpiled missiles to be 
utilized rapidly and with a minimum of discernable preparations. Sufficient 
Soviet capability could be retained under any identified limitation scenario to 
permit Moscow to minimize, if not largely offset, the strategic effect of 
reductions stipulated by a START treaty. 
</P>
<P>
It is time for those who consider themselves serious about arms control and 
responsible about national security to recognize the new deal on mobile 
missiles for what it is: an impermanent marriage of convenience that will make 
effective strategic arms reductions even more problematic and preclude steps 
urgently needed to provide for the common defense. Resources should be applied 
differently, namely to development and deployment of effective strategic 
defenses and to less ambitious ICBM modernization programs -- programs that are 
compatible both with U.S. deterrent requirements and with verifiable 
arms-control agreements.

DODGERS THROWN FOR LOSS BY DAVIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They were just six pitches. A few curveballs, a few fastballs. 
</P>
<P>
But in the eighth inning Wednesday night, with San Diego Padre reliever Mark 
Davis pitching and the Dodgers attempting the hitting, they were six pitches 
that illustrated a season. 
</P>
<P>
With the bases loaded and one out and the Dodgers trailing by a run, Dodger 
pinch-hitters Mickey Hatcher and Mariano Duncan stared at, and hacked at, and 
ultimately struck out on the six pitches as the Dodgers lost, 2-1, in front of 
33,708 at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
With the Padres scoring in the eighth on a two-out, bases-loaded single by Tony 
Gwynn, once again the other team made the comeback. 
</P>
<P>
"We get the bases loaded and one out and you see what happened," Dodger Manager 
Tom Lasorda said. "But they get the bases loaded with two out and what happens? 
They get the runs. I wonder how many late-inning comebacks we've made this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
If a late-inning comeback is one that happens in the eighth inning or later, 
the answer is three. Overall, the Dodgers have lost three in a row and blown 
two consecutive chances to gain ground on the National League West-leading San 
Francisco Giants. Instead of looking ahead, they must now look back, as the 
Padres have caught them in a tie for fourth place, 8 1/2 games behind the 
Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Also hitting them with the approximate force of a Davis fastball Wednesday was 
the news that the team's leading hitter, second baseman Willie Randolph, will 
miss at least a couple of games with a strained right hamstring. He irritated 
it on the turf in Cincinnati last weekend and then aggravated it by playing 
nine of 17 innings in Tuesday night's 5-3 loss to the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
Entering Wednesday night's game, Randolph's .298 average was fifth in the 
league, and he was just getting better, having hit in seven straight games. 
</P>
<P>
"With a hamstring the scary part is, you just don't know how bad it is, and you 
don't know how much to test it," said Randolph, who was replaced Wednesday by 
Dave Anderson. "I'd rather take a few days now and makes sure it's right." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers can only hope he will hurry back. Then again, against a reliever 
such as Davis, maybe he wouldn't have been much help anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers did many things right Wednesday night against the Padres, including 
getting good starting pitching from Mike Morgan (who still leads the league 
with a 1.69 earned-run average), three more hits from Alfredo Griffin and one 
of the best catches Jose Gonzalez will ever make. But it came down to the 
bottom of the eighth, after the Padres took a 2-1 lead in their half of the 
inning on a two-run single by Gwynn against reliever Ricky Horton. 
</P>
<P>
With one out in the eighth against Padre reliever Greg Harris, Mike Scioscia 
reached first base on a grounder that went between the legs of first baseman 
Rob Nelson, a defensive replacement. Jeff Hamilton singled to left and Gonzalez 
also singled, loading the bases. 
</P>
<P>
Out went Harris and in came Davis, who is second in the National League with 19 
saves and who has 43 strikeouts in 39 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
What happens when a poor hitting team meets Davis? "It's a nightmare," Padre 
pitching coach Pat Dobson said. "Even teams that are hitting good, when he's 
on, he's unhittable." 
</P>
<P>
With the Dodgers needing just a flyball to score a run, Hatcher, batting for 
Anderson, came to the plate. He took a called strike. He fouled off a pitch. 
And then he took a half swing at a dipping curveball for strike-three. 
</P>
<P>
Time for Duncan, pinch-hitting for reliever Alejandro Pena. Duncan looked at 
strike-one. He swung at strike-two. Then he swung again for strike-three to end 
the inning. 
</P>
<P>
"He has that big breaking curveball," Duncan said. "I don't know if he's the 
best in the league, but he's good." 
</P>
<P>
Said Lasorda: "He got his curveball over. And they missed it." 
</P>
<P>
That the game ended an inning later when Eddie Murray looked at a called third 
strike with Kirk Gibson standing on first base was anti-climatic. 
</P>
<P>
And how about poor Morgan (5-7), for whom the team has scored just three runs 
in his last three starts. In the eighth, fueled by the Dodgers' fifth-inning 
run on Griffin's RBI single, Morgan was looking at his first complete game of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
But Benito Santiago started the inning with a single to right. Tim Flannery 
followed with another single to right, putting runners on first and second. 
Neither ball was hit particularly hard, so Morgan was allowed to stay in the 
game to face pinch-hitter Bip Roberts, whose bunt did nothing but force 
Santiago at third. Marvell Wynne flied out and it seemed as if Morgan would be 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
But then he threw three straight balls to Roberto Alomar, who had not hit a 
ball into the air against Morgan all night. Two pitches later, Alomar walked to 
load the bases for Gwynn. 
</P>
<P>
"That walk really hurt him," said Lasorda, who promptly took Morgan out. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Horton, who had allowed just two of 14 his previous inherited baserunners 
to score. After getting Gwynn to look at a strike, and then a ball, Horton then 
threw a good sinker. But Gwynn, hitting a league-leading .361 at the time, 
picked it off and grounded up the middle, under the glove of diving second 
baseman Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
John Tudor spoke with both anger and determination Wednesday in evaluating his 
season debut on Tuesday night. In the Dodgers' 5-3, 17-inning loss to the 
Padres, Tudor allowed two runs on five hits in 4 1/3 innings. It was his first 
start since undergoing extensive surgery on his shoulder and elbow this winter. 
"I pitched bad, pure and simple," Tudor said. "No, I wasn't tired. I made bad 
pitches. I made pitches Little Leaguers could hit, and these guys weren't 
Little Leaguers." When asked if he was being a bit hard on himself, considering 
that his performance earned good reviews from both Fred Claire, Dodger vice 
president, and team doctor Frank Jobe, Tudor said: "That's the way I am, that's 
the way I'll always be. I won't settle for anything less than pitching well." 
Dodger physical therapist Pat Screnar said Wednesday that Tudor's arm recovered 
well from his start, noting he was able to do all of his usual pregame 
exercises and should be ready for his next start. Tudor agreed, but said that 
while his elbow felt fine, his shoulder was still a bit tender, a feeling that 
set in last week as soon as he said he was ready to return after two minor 
league rehabilitation assignments. "As soon as I said I was ready, my shoulder 
said, 'Hey man, maybe you're not ready.' " Tudor said. "I think it has to do 
with all the sitting around I've been doing on flights lately. Hopefully, the 
shoulder will come back next time." Next time should be Sunday against 
Pittsburgh at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Two days after being sent to triple-A Albuquerque despite a 2.73 earned-run 
average in 33 innings, Dodger pitcher Tim Crews has formally requested to be 
traded if he's not back in the big leagues within 20 days. Crews met Wednesday 
with Claire and said he was pleased with the response. "He said he's going to 
give it his full effort to take care of me, and I believe him," said Crews, who 
will join Albuquerque Friday in Edmonton, a day later than the usual 72-hour 
deadline for reporting to a minor league team from the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Claire said, "If Tim Crews tells me he is unhappy, I'll certainly 
hear that."

ANGELS ARE LEFT IN TOUGH SPOT; 
</P>
<P>
WITH MINTON OUT, THEY CAN'T STOP INDIANS FOR ABBOTT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Greg Minton said it was "my damn spot," but because of a strained tendon in his 
right elbow, Willie Fraser got the call. 
</P>
<P>
With the score 1-1 and Indian baserunners on second and third in the eighth 
inning Wednesday night in Cleveland Stadium, Fraser unleashed a wild pitch that 
gave Cleveland a 2-1 victory in front of 11,211. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, General Manager Mike Port and Manager Doug Rader told 
Minton that he had been placed on the 15-day disabled list, retroactive to June 
23. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't exactly lose it in there, but I certainly didn't agree with their 
decision," Minton said after the meeting. "What they said made some sense, 
logically, I guess. But I'd rather be pitching. I threw some today and my arm 
felt fine." 
</P>
<P>
"They said they need me to pitch in 30 games in the second half of the season, 
but that was my damn situation tonight. That's what they pay me a ton of money 
for." 
</P>
<P>
The same injury -- a strained flexor tendon in his right elbow -- caused Minton 
to miss nine weeks at the beginning of the 1988 season. He hurt the elbow again 
Friday night while warming up in the bullpen when he tried to snap off a slider 
without warming up enough. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland team physician John Bergfeld examined Minton before Wednesday's game 
and told the Angels that he should not touch a baseball for at least three or 
four days. Minton will be eligible to come off the disabled list in 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
"It's in exactly the same place that kept him out in '88, so for six days, 
we're not going to compromise it," Rader said. 
</P>
<P>
"He has virtually no pain and it bothers him to go on the DL, but if he injures 
it again, we're talking about eight weeks minimum." 
</P>
<P>
Minton has five saves and a 1.84 earned-run average -- and Wednesday night was 
a classic case in point. 
</P>
<P>
Starter Jim Abbott pitched a strong 7 2/3 innings, giving up only four hits. 
Tony Armas hit an eighth-inning home run into a strong wind and the Angels had 
a shot at winning their fifth consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott got the first out of the bottom of the eighth and then gave up a 
ground-ball single to Felix Fermin. Jerry Browne, who scored the game's first 
run in the first inning when the Indians got two singles and a walk off Abbott, 
followed with a line-drive single to center. Danny Sheaffer then hit a roller 
to third that resulted in the second out, but the runners advanced to second 
and third. 
</P>
<P>
Fraser had the count at 1-and-1 on Joe Carter when he bounced a forkball that 
eluded catcher Lance Parrish, and Fermin sprinted home with the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to throw a strike down," Fraser said. "It was just a bad pitch, 
period. There's nothing else to be said about it." 
</P>
<P>
Parrish, however, had considerable comment. 
</P>
<P>
"I've blocked that ball lots of times before," Parrish said. "I'll take the 
blame. I definitely should have blocked it. I should have anticipated that and 
gotten down and out on it faster." 
</P>
<P>
Rader blamed the Angel offense. Left-hander Scott Bailes (3-3) hit the outside 
corners against the right-handed Angel hitters all night. 
</P>
<P>
"We just can't seem to get over the hump with those guys (left-handed finesse 
pitchers)," Rader said. "We're very vulnerable to those types of pitchers. His 
stuff looks fat and we were overswinging instead of just redirecting the ball 
up the middle and into the gaps." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels had better luck with closer Doug Jones, who pitched the ninth inning 
and picked up his 18th save in 21 opportunities. Dick Schofield led off the 
inning with a single to left and two outs later, Wally Joyner's single put 
runners on first and third. But Brian Downing lined out to shortstop to end the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott made 94 pitches, 63 of them strikes. 
</P>
<P>
"He was pitching really well, obviously well enough to win," Parrish said. "I 
didn't think anyone could hit it out in this wind, especially to the opposite 
field, so we were pitching a lot of guys up and away." 
</P>
<P>
The strategy worked as seven Indian hitters flied out to right. But when Abbott 
neared the 100-pitch mark and his deliveries began to sail high, Rader decided 
he had to make the move to Fraser. 
</P>
<P>
"(Abbott) did a fantastic job," Rader said. "You love to see him pitch like 
that. We just didn't score and then we gave them the win in the ninth." 
</P>
<P>
Said Abbott: "It was a tough loss for me and the whole team. It's difficult to 
lose when you're in a pennant race, no matter how early it is, and especially 
the close ones." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Brian Downing's ninth-inning walk Tuesday night was the 1,000th of his career, 
making him one of five active players to reach that milestone (Darrell Evans, 
Dwight Evans, Keith Hernandez and Willie Randolph are the others). "Two years 
ago, when I figured I only had a few years left in my career, that was one of 
my goals," Downing said. "But the only time I ever go up there thinking about 
trying to get a walk is if it's the ninth inning and we're a couple of runs 
down. When I'm leading off, I do try to make a pitcher throw 25 to 30 pitches 
to me during the course of the game, hoping that will benefit us in the last 
third of the game." Downing also said all those walks are partly due to his 
hitting style. "I look for specific pitches," he said. "A lot of guys just look 
for the baseball, but I can't hit that way. I'm not good enough." He is, 
however, good enough to have a .297 average with 13 extra-base hits in June. 
</P>
<P>
Claudell Washington, who has missed three games because of an infection on his 
left shin, said the swelling has gone down but the pain has not subsided. "It 
feels fine in the morning when I first get up," he said, "but if I walk a 
block, it hurts. Right now, the treatment is just to elevate it and stay off 
it. It's getting better. I don't think I'll be out more than a day or two 
more." . . . Tony Armas extended his hitting streak to 82 days with a single to 
center in the third inning Wednesday night. The streak dates to April 8, but 
spans only nine games. It also includes two stints on the disabled list 
totaling 65 days. Armas is hitting .423 with three homers and five RBI during 
the "streak."

DFG PRODUCES 31 WARDENS IN FIRST GRADUATING CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rich Roberts 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They filed onto a stage to a recording of "Pomp and Circumstance" to receive 
their diplomas, but this was a different kind of June graduation. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of gowns, they wore forest green uniforms. Instead of mortarboards, 
they wore side arms. 
</P>
<P>
These were the 31 graduates of the first class of wardens fully trained by the 
California Department of Fish and Game. They completed 20 weeks -- 22 weeks for 
the 13 women -- of the normal intensive schooling at the Napa Valley College 
Police Academy, plus 400 hours of special fish, wildlife and environmental 
indoctrination. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremonies were held June 16 at the California Maritime Academy in Vallejo, 
where the students were housed. Although they still must serve three months of 
probation with veteran wardens in the field, each is not only fully qualified 
in law enforcement, with expertise in 70 different firearms and the Vehicle 
Code, but can tell a salmon from a salamander and when wildlife habitat is 
being abused. 
</P>
<P>
Or, as class coordinator Greg Cook said with a demonstration of duck calls, 
"They now know the difference between the soft whistle of a pintail and the 
loud quack of a mallard." 
</P>
<P>
Previously, candidate wardens were placed at whichever police schools were 
convenient, whenever one was needed, and got their specialized field training 
on the job. With this class, the DFG still will have only 374 wardens to patrol 
the whole state and its offshore marine jurisdictions, but the attitude seems 
to be one of harder resolve. 
</P>
<P>
The class called itself the Poacher Pinchers. 
</P>
<P>
Class president Salvatore Amato of Wilton, Conn., said: "A new generation of 
wardens. Before we could become game wardens, we had to become cops." 
</P>
<P>
DFG Director Pete Bontadelli, who swore them in, called them "our thin green 
line." 
</P>
<P>
There doesn't seem to be much question about their dedication. All were 
required to have two years of college, were paid $1,900 a month during training 
and will start as low as $2,036, with steps up to $2,437 over three years. 
</P>
<P>
All are also qualified to work, say, for the California Highway Patrol, which 
pays about 28% better. 
</P>
<P>
"I took a $900 pay cut to work for the Department of Fish and Game," said 
Jonathan Willcox of Downey, as his wife Karen sighed audibly. 
</P>
<P>
Willcox, tops in the class, has a degree in wildlife management from Humboldt 
State but also wanted to be a policeman. He quit his job with the Gardena 
police force to take the DFG course because, he said, "It's more than just the 
money." 
</P>
<P>
Willcox has been assigned to the patrol boat Yellowtail out of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
The female wardens were required to take two extra weeks of initial physical 
training, and two dropped out of the rigorous course. Eva Marie Schultz of San 
Juan Capistrano -- 5 feet 4 inches tall -- was tops in weaponless defense, and 
Christina Barnes of San Luis Obispo was most knowledgeable in the Fish and Game 
Code. Schultz will be based in Long Beach, Barnes in West Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
The new program was made possible by an increase in the training budget from 
$300,000 to $800,000 under Bontadelli, who pointed out the necessity of special 
preparation. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the time they'll be out alone in areas where they have no backups, and 
70% of their contacts will be dealing with armed people," Bontadelli said. 
</P>
<P>
He hopes to have at least one full class a year. 
</P>
<P>
The International Game Fish Assn. is revising and expanding its all-tackle 
world record program by opening it to freshwater and saltwater species not 
currently on its record lists and by reviewing well-documented applications for 
past catches that exceed current listings. 
</P>
<P>
Catches not included on the IGFA's list of 157 species must be in accordance 
with the IGFA angling rules and world-record requirements. Applications for 
possible record catches made in the past must include as much information as 
possible, including a photograph and positive verification of the weight of the 
fish and the method of catch. 
</P>
<P>
The Nevada Department of Wildlife says the killing of birds of prey for their 
body parts has reached epidemic proportions in that state and other parts of 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
Cliff Jett, supervising game warden for the department, said that there have 
been cases where hundreds of raptor carcasses have been discovered by 
investigators. Talons of hawks have been found swinging from cars' rear-view 
mirrors, the feathers of golden eagles hanging from hatbands and, in one 
instance, the head of a great horned owl was found "adorning a living room 
coffee table." 
</P>
<P>
It is not known how many of Nevada's raptors are killed each year, but Jett 
said: "We do know that quite a bit of illegal traffic is taking place across 
the nation." 
</P>
<P>
Possession of birds of prey or their body parts, even if taken from a road 
kill, is illegal and anyone with information about possession or trafficking of 
such birds or their parts is asked to notify the authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Fish and Game has been unloading more catchable-size trout 
than usual in Mono County lakes because of low production from the wells 
providing water to the Fish Springs Hatchery. It means fewer fish will be 
available later in the summer. Also, Black Rock Hatchery has been under siege 
by white pelicans, cutting the crop about in half. The birds descend by the 
dozens on the open ponds until workers chase them away every morning. . . . 
Angler-author Ronnie Kovach's second and last instructional session on 
freshwater fishing in California is scheduled tonight, 7-10 p.m., at Cerritos 
College. 
</P>
<P>
Californians Larry Hopper of Santa Ana, Mike Reynolds of Modesto, Dan Leichty 
of Arnold and Al Layton of Parker Dam, qualified to compete among 43 weekend 
bass anglers for the $100,000 first prize in Operation Bass' Red Man 
All-American tournament Friday and Saturday at Little Rock, Ark. . . . 
California Angler magazine's inshore fishing school, featuring advice on how to 
catch local species, will be held July 22 from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. at Harbor 
Town Hotel in Ventura. Information: (714) 261-9779. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Council of Conservation Clubs will conduct a bighorn sheep census 
Saturday through Tuesday. Those interested may phone (213) 598-5158. . . . The 
Eastern Sierra Bowmen will have their first Family Fun Shoot Saturday and 
Sunday at the Sherwin Creek campground in Mammoth Lakes. They'll be firing at 
28 three-dimensional targets. Entry fees are $25 for a family, $19 a couple and 
$12 for singles. . . . The U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary will have two eight-week 
courses on "Boating Skills and Seamanship" starting on July 5 and 6, 7:30 p.m., 
at the Newport Harbormaster, 1901 Bayside Dr., Newport Beach. Classes are free 
except for the cost of materials. Information: (714) 675-9582 or (714)

Alaska wildlife officials and lodge owners say the oil spill in Prince William 
Sound should not affect fishing or bird shooting at two of the state's 
important locations: Bristol Bay and Katchemack Bay. According to the report, 
only 700 of Alaska's 35,000 miles of coastline have been affected. . . . The 
Project Mexico Fisherman's Fiesta, a release-only tournament to benefit

Gains in retail sales and employment continued to propel San Diego growth, 
surging the city past other metropolitan centers that showed signs of economic 
slowdown, according to a study released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's gains in retail sales and employment were the highest among 24 
cities recorded in a study by the accounting firm Grant Thornton. 
</P>
<P>
Along with San Diego, the economies of Houston and Miami showed the most 
improvement, while Los Angeles and Detroit displayed more moderate strength. 
</P>
<P>
But such cities were the exception to the rule as Thornton's index of seven 
economic vital signs for the two dozen U. S. metropolitan areas registered a 
negative reading in this year's first quarter. It was only the second time in 
the past 17 quarters that the growth yardstick has pointed downward. 
</P>
<P>
Nineteen cities posted declines in their individual indexes based on statistics 
collected for their areas. 
</P>
<P>
The index showed that the average growth rate of 24 cities declined 0.30 points 
in the first quarter from 1988's final quarter, to 108.8. The previous decline 
occurred in the second quarter of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Houston's economy improved for the fifth straight quarter, according to Grant 
Thornton, which said the achievement has been surpassed only by San Diego. In 
the 12 months ended March 31, Houston's economic growth was greater than that 
of all the cities studied except San Diego, Minneapolis-St. Paul and Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco, the only other California city studied by Grant Thornton, saw 
its first-quarter index value dip. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the spectrum, Baltimore's index value dropped the most of 
the 19 cities that posted declines in the first quarter. Baltimore was followed 
by St. Louis, Seattle, Chicago and Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
The economic indicators that are used to rank the cities include factory hours, 
non-farm employment, construction permits, retail sales, business starts and 
failures and money supply. 
</P>
<P>
Grant Thornton, founded in 1924, provides accounting, audit, tax and management 
consulting services in more than 50 countries.

<P>
The Most Beautiful House in the World by Witold Rybczynski (Viking: $18.95; 166 
pages) 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most painfully inarticulate people I've ever known have been 
architects -- I once worked out a theory that architects tend to smoke pipes 
because it gives them something to do while pondering what to say next. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, sometimes less is more; the writing of some architectural theorists 
and historians is so abstruse and so highfalutin that it might as well be a 
dead language. Sadly, these quirks sometimes conceal the workings of a mind 
steeped in the classical tradition and yet fired with a visionary imagination. 
</P>
<P>
That's why "The Most Beautiful House in the World" is such a winning book, such 
a pleasure to read, and -- above all -- such a revelation about what architects 
actually do and how they go about doing it. 
</P>
<P>
Witold Rybczynski, an architect and a professor of architecture at McGill 
University, sets out to tell the tale of how he came to design and build his 
own house in the corner of an apple orchard on the outskirts of Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
His prose is sturdy, straightforward and yet elegant; tellingly, his little 
book has the clean lines and the human scale and the enduring beauty of the 
barn-like "boathouse" that he built as a home for his wife and himself. Like a 
well-designed home, it is comfortable and inviting and, at the same time, its 
attic and basement are full of oddities and surprises, mementos and keepsakes. 
</P>
<P>
"It began with the dream of a boat," the author writes. Soon enough, his work 
on a temporary boat-building shed turned into a much more ambitious project -- 
the creation of "the most beautiful house in the world." 
</P>
<P>
And the same phenomenon can be observed in the book itself -- the author's 
account of his own efforts at house-building turns into a masterly 
contemplation of the history, philosophy and practice of architecture. "This 
story," the author writes, "is full of accidents." 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, Rybczynski displays another quality that I have observed in some 
of the architects I've known: an intellectual vigor and curiosity that impels 
them to study all aspects of human civilization with an almost spiritual 
passion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Informative Digressions 
</P>
<P>
The author digresses into a hundred different sources and subjects: feng shui, 
or the Taoist art of selecting the most auspicious place to build; khat muhrat, 
or the Hindu rites of ground breaking; the dictates of the Koran on 
architecture; the symbolism of trees; the depiction of architects in the 
movies; the function of fun in the design process; the fraudulence of great 
works of architecture supposedly conceived and captured in a hasty sketch on a 
napkin; the mud-play of Jung; the Gastronomic Analogy in architectural history 
and theory; the exploits of the solo sailor Joshua Slocum; the magic of 
beginnings; stamp-collecting; the architectural practices of the Nabdam farmers 
of northern Ghana; the architectural excesses of Ludwig II, Hearst and Disney; 
the homes of famous authors, and so on. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most intriguing passages in "The Most Beautiful House in the World" 
are to be found in these digressions. Rybczynski's survey of the history of 
barn-building, for example, reveals the aristocratic bloodlines of what we 
perceive as the most common of structures: The barns of medieval monasteries 
followed a "basilican plan," and Jefferson's design of Monticello inspired the 
building of a "Palladian barn." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Play in Architecture 
</P>
<P>
His chapter on children's toys and games, which includes a celebration of 
building blocks and other construction toys, stands alone as a small 
masterpiece; but it also illuminates the author's theory that architecture is 
an inspired and enduring form of play. 
</P>
<P>
"Architecture takes place in a broad and worldly context, of course; but the 
building game is played within the confines of a sheet of paper or a cardboard 
model, and although it has a practical purpose, much of its satisfaction is 
derived from the play elements: the rules, the smallness, the fantasy of making 
space, the re-creation of childhood freedom," he observes. "The architect's 
scale reduced all reality to neat, comprehensible shapes. It was in this sense 
that design was play; for, like play, it not only created order, it was order." 
</P>
<P>
Rybczynski is wholly free of the faintly mystical self-importance that afflicts 
some architects; he shuns the school of architecture that looks only to great 
men and great buildings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unavoidable Art Form 
</P>
<P>
"For centuries, the difference between master masons, journeyman builders, 
joiners, dilettantes, gifted amateurs, and architects has been ill defined," 
Rybczynski writes. "If we call buildings that move us 'architecture,' then we 
leave open the question of whether they are grand or small, known or unknown, 
sheds or cathedrals." 
</P>
<P>
Architecture, of course, is one art form that we cannot avoid; we live with the 
work of architects everywhere we go. That fact alone helps to explain why 
architects are tempted to regard themselves as something more than "master 
builders." 
</P>
<P>
But Rybczynski is one architect who honors the loftiest ideals of his calling 
even as he brings them down from Olympus and plants them in humble soil. 
</P>
<P>
And, thanks to his work in "The Most Beautiful House in the World," the magic 
and power of architecture are all the more dazzling.

Being Your Own Parent: The Solution for Adult Children of Alcoholic and Other 
Dysfunctional Families by Dennis Wholey (Doubleday: $17.95). 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Wholey, former host of PBS-TV's "LateNight America," left his job to 
write "The Courage to Change," a book about his own alcoholic background. Now, 
in "Being Your Own Parent," Wholey examines the lives of 14 people whose 
addictions include alcoholism, overeating, gambling, the abuse of prescriptions 
or illegal drugs. Then there are other problems, including emotional 
abandonment. 
</P>
<P>
Variously angry, suppressed, embittered and generally haunted by ghosts from 
the past, they discuss their problems at meetings of Adult Children of 
Alcoholics, an organization found in many cities across the nation. Run along 
the lines of Alcoholics Anonymous, these talk-it-out groups promise anonymity 
and support. 
</P>
<P>
Wholey also has gathered brief, intelligent essays by experts on dysfunctional 
behavior. Though much of what is written here might seem familiar to those in 
the field of psychotherapy, Wholey has made a useful contribution by 
summarizing personal truths. At bottom, he writes: "We all feel the urgent need 
to love and be loved." And, "we've all been affected by the past, but none of 
us need to be a victim of it." ROSELLE M. LEWIS

YOUR WHEELS: SQUEEZING BY WITH HELP OF LEMON LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I have repeatedly had to return my new Chevrolet to the dealer for 
different repairs. The engine computer went out once, stranding me. Since then, 
the engine doesn't seem to run right. The power door locks would not work. And 
just recently, the automatic transmission seems to be making a loud clunk every 
time it shifts. I am worried I have a lemon. I have heard there is something 
called a lemon law. What is it and how do I use it? -- N.G. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The vast majority of problems on new cars, even difficult ones that 
defy the first repair attempt, can be solved without invoking lemon laws, but 
occasionally a car is so badly built that a motorist has no alternative but to 
do legal battle with the manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
Most states, including California, have lemon laws that give new car owners 
specific legal rights. But the lemon laws require that a series of specific 
steps be taken to solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
In California, the lemon law, which is part of 1982 amendments to the 
Song-Beverly Warranty Act, is administered by the New Motor Vehicle Board. An 
owner must have a car that's less than a year old and have fewer than 12,000 
miles to use the law. 
</P>
<P>
A motorist must make four or more attempts to have the dealer fix a single 
problem before he or she can proceed under the law; alternatively, a motorist 
must be able to show that the dealer was unable to fix all of the problems on a 
car within 30 working days at the garage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Into Arbitration 
</P>
<P>
If these conditions are met, the motorist must contact the manufacturer in 
writing about the failure of the authorized dealer to make the repairs under 
the warranty. At this point, the owner and the manufacturer are ready to go 
into third-party arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
A variety of organizations can fill the third-party role. Manufacturers use the 
Better Business Bureau, the American Automobile Assn. or the Automotive 
Consumer Action Assn., which is sponsored through the National Automotive 
Dealers Assn. Some manufacturers, such as Ford and Chrysler, have their own 
arbitration boards. Some, such as Hyundai, do not offer arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
Decisions made by the third-party arbitrator are binding on the manufacturer, 
but they can be appealed by the consumer through the state civil courts. That's 
where the lemon law's specific protections come into play. 
</P>
<P>
The law puts the burden of proof on the manufacturer to show that the car is 
not a lemon. If you win the case in court, the manufacturer has an obligation 
to buy back or replace the car. But most cases don't go that far. The New Motor 
Vehicle Board can help resolve disputes between consumers and dealers or 
manufacturers. The board handles about 150 calls per day. Its telephone number 
is (916) 445-1888. 
</P>
<P>
The New Motor Vehicle Board is separate from the California Bureau of 
Automotive Repair, which licenses and regulates repair facilities. It helps 
resolve disputes between consumers and repair garages or dealer service 
departments. Its toll-free number is (800) 952-5210. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You recently wrote about gas-line antifreeze and said isopropyl is safe to 
use. It seems to me that most antifreeze is methanol. Which should I use? -- 
M.S. 
</P>
<P>
A: You are right that methanol is the most common anti-icing additive for fuel 
lines, but most types of alcohols will work. Ethanol, another type of alcohol 
that is made from grain, also acts as an anti-icing agent. It has an affinity 
for water and picks up moisture throughout the fuel system. By moving the water 
out of the tank and fuel lines, you avoid having it freeze. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commercial Additive 
</P>
<P>
It's best to buy a commercial anti-icing additive that contains the correct 
concentration of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
But unless you have a specific problem with your fuel system, you probably 
don't need to add anything. Major gasoline brands contain an anti-icing agent 
that should provide all the protection necessary.

YOUR COLLECTIBLES: RARE ANDIRONS IN UNUSUAL SHAPES BRING HOT PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: We have a pair of fireplace andirons that probably date back to the 
late 19th Century. They stand almost 2 feet high and have a braided, or 
twisted, pattern running around the main legs of the set. What sort of value 
should my family attach to them? -- T.A. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Depending on condition and rarity, andirons have sold in a wide price 
range, from a few hundred dollars a pair to well in excess of $1,000 a set, 
according to information provided by dealer catalogues and collectors. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the more valuable andirons were fashioned in the East, such as in 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
Other factors that will affect price include the unusual shape of the andirons, 
who designed them and the materials from which they are made. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, andirons made of brass or copper will bring more cash than iron. But 
an intricate iron pattern can neutralize this rule of thumb, collectors say. 
</P>
<P>
Another collecting hint is the fact that a matched set of andirons invariably 
attracts greater collector interest -- and hence bigger cash sales -- than 
simply one andiron. 
</P>
<P>
Some 18th- and 19th-Century designs include andirons designed with animal and 
human heads. Others were more functional, topped off, for example, with hooks 
where plates and tankards could be hung. 
</P>
<P>
Collectors also specialize in related items, such as fireplace tools, bellows 
and warming pans. The shape of these items hasn't changed much over the years, 
so the beginning collector will have to be careful in sorting out the old from 
the new. 
</P>
<P>
Associated with collecting andirons are cooking items, such as pots and pans 
designed for the open hearth and used at a time when the fireplace played a 
major role in preparing meals for the early American family.

Raymond Sherrard, a government investigator, is an expert on law-enforcement 
patches. We recently received two illustrated manuals he wrote on the subject, 
"Federal Law Enforcement Patches," Vols. I and II (illustrated). 
</P>
<P>
Volume I (1983, 40 pages) sells for $13.20, including postage; Volume II (72 
pages) has a $21.50 price tag, postage included. The latter volume includes a 
detailed listing of government agencies that issue patches, plus insignia 
suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
Sherrard writes: "I plan a series of books relating to the history of federal 
badges and insignia and have two in the works now: 'Badges of the United States 
Marshals' and 'Badges of the United States Treasury Department.' " 
</P>
<P>
Sherrard said he will take reader inquiries at (714) 892-9012. His address for 
orders: RHS Enterprises, P.O. Box 5779, Garden Grove, Calif. 92645.

Making its way into bookstores is "American Indian Collectibles" (first 
edition, House of Collectibles, New York, 394 pages, illustrated, index, 
$12.95) by Dawn E. Reno. 
</P>
<P>
Writes the author in an introduction: 
</P>
<P>
"When I traveled throughout the Southwest and other parts of the United States 
to obtain materials and photos for this project, I heard, more than once, that 
people were taking money out of the stock market and instead were investing in 
American Indian art/artifacts. That fact intrigued me, because it meant the 
market for antiques would be strong -- and that the Indian market was becoming 
even stronger." 
</P>
<P>
Among other collectibles, the book covers art, baskets, blankets, clothing, 
jewelry, leather, pottery, tools and weapons. Also included are listings of 
dealers, auctioneers and collectors, plus a bibliography.

The black rap group Public Enemy has disbanded after anti-Semitic statements by 
one of its entourage provoked accusations of racism. In a recent interview with 
the Washington Times, the band's "Minister of Information" who calls himself 
Professor Griff declared that Jews were responsible for "the majority of 
wickedness that goes on across the globe," that Jews "have a grip on America" 
and had "a history of killing black men." The group fired Griff last week and 
subsequently apologized. But late Tuesday, Russell Simmons, president of Def 
Jam, the group's record label, said in a statement that "Public Enemy is 
disbanding for an indefinite period of time. We fully denounce any and all 
anti-Semitic statements by Professor Griff." ALEENE MacMINN

The palimony trial of actor William Hurt came to an end Tuesday with testimony 
from his former wife who said he once told her he was "finished with marriage." 
Mary Beth Hurt's remarks on the closing day of the non-jury trial backed up 
earlier statements by her ex-husband who claimed he never planned to wed again 
after the couple's 11-year marriage ended in divorce in December, 1982. Hurt is 
being sued for palimony in state Supreme Court in Manhattan by Sandra Jennings, 
his former girlfriend and the mother of their 6-year-old son, Alexander. 
Administrative Judge Jacqueline Silbermann, who heard the six-day trial without 
a jury, now will rule on the case after lawyers submit written summations. 
Jennings is trying to prove she and Hurt had a common-law marriage when they 
lived briefly together in South Carolina and is seeking half of Hurt's 
estimated $10 million. ALEENE MacMINN

Buyers at Sotheby's in New York City paid $1.7 million for 396 lots of 
animation artwork from the Disney/Amblin hit "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" 
Wednesday in the first major sale of art from a contemporary film. The most 
expensive item, a cel of the assembled 'Toon characters from the movie's 
finale, brought $50,600. Its pre-sale estimate was $15,000-$20,000. Each cel 
was mounted against a still from the corresponding live action scene from the 
film. The record for a piece of animation artwork was set in May, when a 
Canadian collector paid $286,000 for a cel and background from Disney's 
"Orphan's Benefit" (1934) at Christie's East. ALEENE MacMINN

how indomitably some of its pioneers have survived, was intermittently 
demonstrated during the evening. Produced by the jazz critic Ira Gitler, the 
program also included a few of the younger artists who absorbed the bop essence 
as it became the lingua franca of jazz. 
</P>
<P>
A succinct set by trumpeter Red Rodney and alto saxophonist Phil Woods 
established the mood for the evening. Like many of the participants, Rodney and 
the pianist in this group, Duke Jordan, once played with Charlie Parker, whose 
shadow hung heavily over the hall. Dizzy Gillespie, in the first of two brief 
appearances, was added toward the end of the set, and if his glory years are 
somewhere behind him, he still did justice, with muted and open horn, to one of 
his earliest compositions, "Groovin' High." 
</P>
<P>
The teaming of be-bop pianists Walter Davis Jr. and Barry Harris failed to 
jell. Instead of sounding well contrasted, they were ill-matched, with the 
flamboyant Davis overpowering the fine-tuned Harris, and the rhythm section 
(Ron Carter on bass and Roy Haynes on drums) overpowering both. Everything came 
alive a little more vividly after intermission, with the first and still 
foremost be-bop vibraphonist, Milt Jackson, in partnership with the mature and 
harmonically imaginative tenor saxophonist Jimmy Heath (who used to be known as 
"Little Bird"). Gillespie appeared again, in better form with his old band 
theme "I Waited For You" followed by a brisk re-examination of his old minor 
blues piece "Birks' Works." 
</P>
<P>
The rhythm section backing this segment was subtler and more adventurous than 
those that have preceded it, with pianist Cedar Walton expressing himself in a 
post-bop language, helped by the bassist Bob Cranshaw and drummer Mickey Roker. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Art Blakey took to the stage with his current edition of the Jazz 
Messengers, now enlarged to three saxophones, trumpet, trombone and three 
rhythm section members. 
</P>
<P>
The drummer, now 70, never ceases to produce new discoveries. 
</P>
<P>
Almost a decade ago he astonished the jazz world by introducing Wynton and 
Branford Marsalis. Today he has at least three promising and relatively 
youthful soloists: The percussively original Benny Green on piano; the 
virtuosic if occasionally extravagant trombonist Frank Lacey, now Blakey's 
musical director, whose interpretation of J. J. Johnson's "Lament" was a tour 
de force, and the trumpeter Brian Lynch, well known for his work with the 
Toshiko Akiyoshi orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Ranging from the hard bop of the 1950s to the modal sounds of the '70s, 
Blakey's team brought the evening to a climax, although to everyone's surprise, 
on the closing "Night in Tunisia," a Gillespie standard, Dizzy did not 
reappear.

'GIUSTINO' SHOWCASES YOUNG PROS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under the innocuous rubric "Showcase '89," members of the San Francisco Opera 
Center, the parent company's finishing school for young professionals, applied 
themselves to a rare Handel opera, "Giustino," on Tuesday in the Herbst 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
What emerged was not only another obscure Handel work filled with musical 
marvels, but a heartening exhibition of what a generation ago would have been a 
dead-end experience for talents on the rise. The most one could expect from a 
study of Handel opera then was the acquisition of some recital warm-up pieces. 
Remember "arie antiche"? 
</P>
<P>
The Opera Center singers were given every opportunity to shine by the seasoned 
hands to whom the production was entrusted. Director Albert Takazauckas, from 
the American Conservatory Theatre, accepted the librettists' hokum gracefully, 
without gratuitous updating, resulting in a production much like one the 
audience in London's Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, may have witnessed in 1737. 
</P>
<P>
And no shying away from the preposterous, e.g., a battle with a raging bear or 
pursuit by a sea monster, both handled as lovable velveteen plug-uglies from 
Sesame Street, eliciting the same squeals of delight from the Herbst Theatre 
audience as Handel expected from his 18th-Century viewers. Set against the 
cleverly stylized scenic design of Barbara Mesney, the opera's fantastic 
elements seemed pertinent -- not to dramatic truth or any such high-flown 
concept, but to an evening's entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
For Handel, believable human emotion was encapsulated in the arias and 
recitatives rather than in plot, and "Giustino" abounds in self-revelation 
clothed in music of often sublime loveliness. 
</P>
<P>
While one admired the stylish aplomb with which the entire cast negotiated the 
Handelian fioritura, the evening was dominated by Janet Williams' exquisite 
Arianna, empress of this Classical never-never land. Her every pose elicited 
sympathy; every note was finely tuned, with a sensitivity to dynamics that 
might serve as a model for singers far more experienced, and with, alone among 
the cast, a serviceable trill. All these qualities came together in her 
heart-stopping Act II aria, "Quel torrente." 
</P>
<P>
In the title role of the plowboy who sorts out the various plot complexities, 
Patricia Spence exhibited a smoothly produced mezzo, clumsy stage presence and 
a need to bite into the text with more urgency. As Williams' emperor, mezzo 
Patricia Racette cut a believable figure and in the glorious third-act duet 
with Arianna achieved the lofty expressive level of her partner. 
</P>
<P>
Tenor Craig Estep, as the resident villain, substituted teeth-clenching and 
eye-popping for mustache-twirling, but for the most part handled his music 
skillfully. In lesser assignments, Ann Panagulias and LeRoy Villanueva offered 
potent characterizations. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the musical strength of the production stemmed from the accomplished 
efforts (patches of sour oboe playing notwithstanding) of the period-instrument 
Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra, under the direction of Nicholas McGegan who, 
abjuring his often jumpy, full-speed-ahead approach, provided the young singers 
with a firm yet flexible rhythmic underpinning.

STAGE WATCH : 'JEROME ROBBINS' BROADWAY' IS POSTPONED; FUNDING FOR DOWNTOWN 
SHAKESPEARE FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The opening of "Jerome Robbins' Broadway" at the Shubert Theatre, earlier 
announced for fall, has been postponed until sometime during the first six 
months of 1990, reports Gerald Schoenfeld, Shubert Organization chairman, 
citing conflicts with Robbins' schedule as the reason for the delay. 
</P>
<P>
Schoenfeld denied rumors that the production might be scrubbed. "Our goal is to 
open an engagement in Los Angeles as the first stop of what will be a many-city 
tour, including Japan," he said. "I'm pleased with the way we're moving toward 
that goal." As of now, he added, nothing is slated for the Shubert prior to 
"Robbins' " -- "but that could change." 
</P>
<P>
FUND FUN: That $90,000 the Mark Taper Forum just won from the Fund for New 
American Plays, for next season's production of Arthur Kopit's "Discovery of 
America," marks the second year in a row the Taper has received one of the 
awards. Last year the Taper won $55,000 for its staging earlier this year of 
Jon Robin Baitz's "Dutch Landscape." 
</P>
<P>
For all three years of the fund's existence, Taper artistic director Gordon 
Davidson has been on the panel of judges who select the award winners. His 
Center Theatre Group colleague, outgoing Ahmanson Theatre artistic director 
Robert Fryer, also has been one of the nine panelists. 
</P>
<P>
"What can I say -- we have terrific taste," joked Davidson, when asked about 
his double roles as judge and beneficiary. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, in accordance with the fund's policy (modeled on guidelines used by 
the National Endowment for the Arts and many private foundations), Davidson 
left the room during discussion of the Taper submissions and voting on them, 
said Deborah Dixon, project director of the fund. Fryer has not attended recent 
meetings but has voted "telephonically," she said. According to Dixon, Fryer 
didn't disqualify himself from voting on the Taper submissions. (Fryer could 
not be reached for comment.) 
</P>
<P>
Davidson also pointed out that the Taper's first application, during the fund's 
first year (and Davidson's first year on the panel), was unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Davidson won't be on the panel next year. "I've asked to be rotated 
off," he said. "I thought it best to make sure it doesn't seem there is a lock 
on it." 
</P>
<P>
The awards are designed to supplement theaters' own funds. Although the total 
costs of "Discovery of America" are not yet known, an average Taper production 
costs between $500,000 and $550,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Dutch Landscape" was generally panned, and South Coast Repertory had even 
worse luck with the $64,000 it received from the fund last year for a 
production of "Infinity's House." After a dispute with playwright Ellen 
McLaughlin, South Coast canceled the production before it got off the ground -- 
and returned the $64,000. 
</P>
<P>
But some of the fund-supported projects have gone on to greater glory, most 
notably this year's big prize winner, Wendy Wasserstein's "The Heidi 
Chronicles." 
</P>
<P>
SUMMER SHAKESPEARE: Citicorp/Citibank has granted Shakespeare Festival/LA 
$30,000 for its fourth summer of alfresco Shakespeare in downtown Los Angeles. 
The company will perform "As You Like It," set in the California Gold Rush era 
and directed by Kevin Kelley, for six performances at Citicorp Plaza, beginning 
Aug. 4 and ending Aug. 13. Then the production will move to the John Anson Ford 
Theatre for three performances Aug. 18-20. 
</P>
<P>
The requested admission charge is a donation of food or clothing to the 
Salvation Army's rehabilitation program at Harbor Light Center. Vons will match 
donations of canned food (up to 10,000 cans). Downtown show times are 6 p.m. 
Fridays and 4 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays; Hollywood performances will be at 8 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Pacific Theatre Ensemble has selected "The Merry Wives of 
Windsor" as its first Equity production, to be presented on the Santa Monica 
Pier, opening Aug. 18. Performances will be at 5 p.m. Fridays, Saturdays at 11 
a.m. and 2 p.m., and Sundays at 2 p.m., closing Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
D. Paul Yeuell, who co-adapted and directed "June Second" and "The Long 
Christmas Dinner" for the ensemble, will direct. 
</P>
<P>
Only 32 of the 133 applicants for theater grants from the California Arts 
Council this year were from Los Angeles and Orange County organizations -- 
despite an often-cited impression (difficult to document) within Los Angeles 
theater circles that this area turns out a much higher proportion of the 
state's total theatrical product. 
</P>
<P>
In recent questionnaires, Theatre League Alliance (Theatre LA) asked its 
members about the under-representation of Los Angeles in the application 
process. 
</P>
<P>
The results, said Theatre LA executive director Karen Rushfield, reveal that 
many Los Angeles theaters "don't have the staff time or experience to do the 
applications" and don't see "a high probability" of success. Asked why these 
factors would apply more to Los Angeles than to the rest of the state, 
Rushfield replied, "I don't know." But she ventured that it might be "because a 
greater proportion of our theaters are newer." 
</P>
<P>
Ray Tatar, theater grants administrator for the California Arts Council, had a 
more specific answer: "A number of the smaller Los Angeles theaters are not 
nonprofit" and are therefore ineligible for public money. Those which are 
eligible "have a hard time diversifying their income base" in Los Angeles -- in 
contrast to San Francisco, for example, "which has been 
</P>
<P>
giving harder and longer to its arts organizations." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the smaller theaters are supported by their members' dues "and the 
quality is graded lower because the work is chosen to serve the artists. There 
is no public accountability." Even apart from these membership organizations, 
"the concept of (movie/TV) showcasing pervades the ethos of smaller theaters in 
Los Angeles," Tatar continued. He cited examples of Arts Council monitors 
showing up at smaller theater shows soon after opening night, only to learn 
that the original cast members had already gone on to other jobs. 
</P>
<P>
However, Tatar pointed out that some smaller theaters are improving their 
scores. This year, only six of the 31 applicants failed to reach "fundable" 
status; last year, eight of 29 applicants failed. "Fundable" status does not 
guarantee a grant, but it's the most important step. The council will make its 
final funding decisions in August. 
</P>
<P>
The recently revived Theatre LA (which replaced two moribund predecessors) may 
help Los Angeles theaters in their funding efforts, Tatar said. The 
organization plans to open a theater management library for its members and 
find consultants who will assist member theaters in their fund-raising "for 
reasonable fees," Rushfield added.

HIGH ENERGY BUT MIXED SIGNALS FROM 24-7 SPYZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG LEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Guitarist Jimi Hazel of the group 24-7 Spyz has declared, "We want to turn the 
'90s into the '60s all over again." Judging from the Bronx quartet's slam-happy 
mega-dose of thrash 'n' burn at the Roxy on Tuesday night, the punk spirit of 
'77 might be a more appropriate target. 
</P>
<P>
But what kind of "cutting-edge" band, from either the hippie or the punk days, 
would have spent part of its set endorsing a name-brand tennis shoe? And where 
does a band's consciousness lie when it goes from attacking social injustices 
and intoning reggae mysticism to using a bit of the funk classic "Brick House" 
to frame a rude, sexist limerick? We are talking about some very mixed signals 
here. 
</P>
<P>
Musically, the Spyz throw a lot into their churning stew: Jimi Hazel has 
obviously spent study hour listening to his Hendrix namesake, but he also 
employs some jazzy, augmented chords and goofy, Zappa-esque themes. Even if the 
band is fast and heavy enough to open for, say, Metallica, its real 
crowd-pleaser is a remake of Kool &amp; the Gang's '70s R&amp;B barnburner 
"Jungle Boogie." 
</P>
<P>
Singer Peter Fluid was more agitated than a Maytag, taking his party to the 
people at one point by jumping off stage and running through the club as the 
band jammed on stage. But take away the advanced musicianship, the bluster and 
the high-energy high jinks, and the Spyz's material has more calculated shock 
effect than memorable hooks. 24-7 Spyz makes a big noise, but without real 
depth or any philisophical consistency behind its "radical" image, it doesn't 
have a whole lot of soul. CRAIG LEE

LET'S EAT OUT: PAPAGAYO OFFERS A TASTE OF MEXICO IN LAKE ARROWHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"If we get to Lake Arrowhead before you, we'll just head for the Mexican 
restaurant in Blue Jay and have a cerveza. Meet us there," said a friend. 
</P>
<P>
I couldn't think of any Mexican restaurant in Blue Jay and told her so. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just as you're heading into town. Maybe it's not Blue Jay -- what's the 
name of that other place? Agua Fria? It's right next to the gas station." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, we arrived first and waited for our friends to drive us to La 
Cantina de Papagayo. It was Friday night and the place was jammed, but we 
managed to grab a tiny table on the half-completed outdoor patio while we 
waited for a larger one in the dining room. 
</P>
<P>
A basket of warm tortilla chips, some spicy salsa and a liter of Margaritas 
kept us very content until our table became available. Their chips are light 
and crispy, obviously fried in fresh vegetable shortening. They make the chunky 
salsa daily, and we discovered the consistency and flavor varies slightly not 
only from night to night but from dish to dish. All of it, however, has plenty 
of bite. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Frothy Margaritas 
</P>
<P>
The Margaritas are nice and frothy and not too sweet. We overheard another 
customer telling his friends they were "the best around." We also tried the 
strawberry variation, which tasted like it had been made with fresh berries. 
They come flavored with peach, melon and coconut too. 
</P>
<P>
Eight hot appetizers are available on the patio and in the tiny bar area. Nic's 
taquito bits are terrific -- two flour tortillas rolled up with shredded beef, 
deep fried, then cut into bite size pieces, topped with ranchera sauce and 
cheese and garnished with sour cream. 
</P>
<P>
If you prefer a little less sauce, try the nachos supremas. Tortilla chips are 
topped with Jack and Cheddar cheeses, ground beef, tomatoes, onions, black 
olives, green chiles and dabs of guacamole and sour cream. 
</P>
<P>
The pizza Mexicana is similar but uses one large crispy flour tortilla as the 
base and adds beans and enchilada sauce to the aforementioned toppings. 
Papagayo wings, a take-off on Buffalo chicken wings, was the spiciest of the 
appetizer selections we tried. 
</P>
<P>
You could easily make a meal of the appetizers at Papagayo's, but there are 
also plenty of worthwhile entrees. The carnitas are served as a build-your-own 
burrito, with a choice of three flour or corn tortillas to wrap the lean 
shredded pork, refried beans, green salsa and salad of shredded lettuce, sliced 
black olives and chopped tomatoes, jalapenos and cilantro. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Generous Portions 
</P>
<P>
Portions, in general, are generous, so it wasn't surprising the el gordo 
burrito lived up to its name. The large flour tortilla was bulging with chunk 
and ground beef, rice, cheese, refried beans, lettuce, tomatoes, black olives 
and verde sauce. It is only outdone by the el puerco grande, which is made with 
two large tortillas and billed as "a burrito that will stuff one, fill two or 
satisfy three." 
</P>
<P>
There are also dessert burritos, filled with apple or peach filling, deep fried 
and topped with whipped cream. Our waitress suggested them over the sopaipillas 
"because they were lighter." When we showed obvious doubt, she brought the can 
of light whipped cream to our table to prove her point. 
</P>
<P>
That's typical of the restaurant's service. Even when business is brisk, the 
service people are friendly and attentive. 
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere is also warm and very casual. The menu says Papagayo is home of 
the wild parrot, so a couple portraits of the bird hang on the imitation walnut 
paneling that covers most of the walls and ceiling. Where it doesn't, there is 
fern wallpaper behind the black plastic upholstered booths. An assortment of 
wrought iron lamps provide lighting and plastic flowers add a note of color. 
</P>
<P>
I had just been commenting that the carpet needed vacuuming when someone came 
past with one of those hand carpet sweepers. My friends just laughed. "This is 
a mountain kind of place. What do you expect?" 
</P>
<P>
 La Cantina de Papagayo, junction of Daley Canyon Road and State Highway 189, 
Agua Fria, (714) 337-9529. Open Sunday through Thursday, from 11 a.m. to 9 
p.m.; Friday and Saturday, from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. No reservations. Mastercard

FOOD BRIEFS: MORE DRUG ABUSERS SAYING YES TO CATTLE RUSTLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More cattle are being stolen in California during the 1980s than were rustled 
at the turn of the century, according to a meat industry publication. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, for instance, 2,400 animals were purloined by cattle thieves from 240 
livestock firms, Lean Trimmings, a Western States Meat Assn. newsletter, 
reported. Losses from these cow capers are estimated at about $1 million 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
State officials believe that the drug problem is partially to blame for the 
increase in thefts. 
</P>
<P>
"(With) the rise in beef prices . . . a wayward cow starts to look pretty 
inviting to (the) drug-crazed," the newsletter stated. "The $200 an addict can 
get on the street for a cow is more than enough to support most habits (for a 
day)." 
</P>
<P>
The escalating cattle rustling has caused the state's Department of Food and 
Agriculture to create a special Livestock Enforcement Unit. Oddly enough, 
California was forced to establish a similar anti-crime squad in 1917 when 
problems with stolen steers last arose, Lean Trimmings reports. 
</P>
<P>
Absconding with a cow, however, is not as easy as pilfering a car stereo. 
Police familiar with the problem believe that some of the disappearances are 
the work of cowhands. 
</P>
<P>
"It requires a great deal of equipment and knowledge of the cattle industry to 
steal the animals. These 'inside outlaws' often alter the cow's brands and ear 
markings, transport them across state lines and sell them to unknowing buyers," 
according to the newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
But as is the case with virtually all kinds of thefts within the state, 
officials predict that there will be more rustling than ever in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Picking a Pepper -- Few people look at bell peppers as a rich source of 
nutrients, but an Indio, Calif.-based company hopes to change that perception 
with a series of recent advertisements promoting its hybrid variety trademarked 
as Le Rouge Royale. 
</P>
<P>
The sweet red peppers, developed by Sun World International, are said to be a 
superior source of Vitamin C, potassium and fiber. The vegetables, each of 
which is tagged with the company's distinctive sticker, are also comparatively 
high in other nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
The innovative agricultural firm, which introduced a seedless watermelon last 
year, claims that laboratory tests demonstrate Le Rouge Royale contains far 
more Vitamin C than a navel orange. 
</P>
<P>
The analysis, conducted by the Produce Marketing Assn. in Newark, Del., was 
reviewed for authenticity by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Le Rouge Royale are generally oversized, only about three-fourths 
the size of an average pepper, or five ounces, was used for the tests. 
</P>
<P>
The findings indicate that five ounces of the Sun World pepper offer 180% of 
the recommended daily intake of Vitamin C. By comparison, a navel orange has 
100% of the recommended amount and a whole green bell pepper has 130% of the 
target level. 
</P>
<P>
The disparity is similar for potassium. Researchers found that five ounces of 
Le Rouge Royale contained 350 milligrams of the mineral, while a banana had 300 
milligrams and a green bell pepper contained 270 milligrams. 
</P>
<P>
The analysis revealed that the deep red vegetable was also a good source of 
fiber. For instance, one bowl of bran flakes contains five grams of fiber 
whereas three-fourths of a Le Rouge Royale has as much as four grams. 
</P>
<P>
Sun World developed its red pepper strain by combining other varieties such as 
the Bell, Cubanella and Bulgarian. The mixture is responsible for the Le Rouge 
Royale's distinctive color, size and shape. 
</P>
<P>
Although Sun World is decidedly proud of the Le Rouge Royale's nutritional 
composition, it has no plans to market a red pepper breakfast juice at this 
time. Even so, the firm recommends munching on its peppers as a "healthy 
snack." 
</P>
<P>
Meal or Pills? -- Nutritional-supplement manufacturers were not cheered when a 
federal advisory body urged Americans to obtain their recommended daily 
allotment of vitamins and minerals from food rather than tablets. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,300-page study from the National Research Council, released earlier this 
year, generated considerable news coverage for seemingly advocating a "no 
pills" dietary regimen. 
</P>
<P>
But the report's intent was somewhat misinterpreted, according to the Tufts 
University Diet &amp; Nutrition Letter. There were a number of instances where 
the council did, in fact, say that nutritional supplements were appropriate, 
the newsletter states. 
</P>
<P>
Among groups considered potentially deficient in certain vitamins or minerals 
are pregnant women, strict vegetarians, women who suffer from excessive 
menstrual bleeding, the elderly, and sick individuals whose appetites are 
depressed. Certain medications may also cause deficiencies, the Diet &amp; 
Nutrition Letter reported. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, none of this means that popping a vitamin or mineral pill should be 
viewed as a panacea for a poor diet or that taking excess amounts of one or 
another nutrient is a healthful practice," the newsletter stated. 
</P>
<P>
Those who regularly consume vitamin or mineral megadoses may actually be 
placing themselves at risk. Large amounts of Vitamin A, for instance, can lead 
to liver damage. On this topic, the Diet &amp; Nutrition Letter endorsed the 
NRC's advisory that consumers avoid taking supplements in excess of the daily 
recommended amount. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes taking one a day, under the guidance of a physician or dietitian, is 
a called-for step to take," the newsletter stated. 
</P>
<P>
Tomato's Changing Times -- Just as the red pepper is apparently undergoing an 
evolution, so is the tomato. In fact, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is 
advising consumers to alter home canning methods to accommodate the modern 
tomato's characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
Of particular importance is that the fruit today is "fleshier," or contains 
more pulp than in the past. As a result, tomatoes require additional acidity 
and processing time in order to ensure a safe product. 
</P>
<P>
The revised canning guidelines now call for two tablespoons of lemon juice per 
quart of home-canned tomatoes rather than only two teaspoons. 
</P>
<P>
Processing time is also doubled, from 15 minutes to 30 minutes for the 
hot-water bath, or when the tomatoes are sealed in jars and then placed in 
boiling water. 
</P>
<P>
A UC Davis researcher, familiar with the recent recommendations, supported the 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
"If these guidelines are followed (then) canned tomatoes will be very safe," 
said Kathryn Boor, UC Davis food scientist. "There's no reason to be gun-shy 
about home-canned tomatoes." 
</P>
<P>
The precautions are necessary because tomatoes, as is true with any raw 
agricultural product, may contain bacteria. The pathogens, if given the proper 
conditions to thrive, could multiply and contaminate the food. 
</P>
<P>
Seasoning Statistics -- While red peppers are more nutritious and tomatoes are 
fleshier, herbs are becoming fresher, according to recent federal statistics. 
</P>
<P>
This segment of the produce industry is, in fact, booming. The USDA reported 
that the fresh-herb market in 1987 totaled about 28.8 million pounds, an 
increase of 58% in just five years. 
</P>
<P>
The rise has prompted the agency to begin charting sales of fresh herbs in the 
same manner that other produce items are analyzed for national production 
totals. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the herbs to be included in the ongoing government survey are anise, 
basil, chervil, chives, cilantro, rosemary, sorrel, tarragon and watercress, 
according to the Packer, a trade journal.

ABOUT WINE: THE GRAPES OF WORTH . . . CALIFORNIA'S NORTH COAST CABERNET 
SAUVIGNONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, Times Wine Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First the conclusion: Despite the hype that 1985 California Cabernet Sauvignons 
are the best ever and despite rave reviews for many 1984s, I feel that 1986 
Cabernets will eventually top both vintages in terms of overall quality. 
</P>
<P>
After evaluating 1986 Cabernets from California's North Coast counties for more 
than a year, I am struck by the fact that there is more depth, complexity and 
classical structure here than may be apparent on first blush. 
</P>
<P>
More about the vintage after a few words about how this all came about. 
</P>
<P>
In most areas of the wine world, the harvest of grapes is orderly. As grapes 
ripen, the wine maker takes sugar samples and tastes berries from various areas 
of the vineyards to determine when to pick. When maturity is believed to be 
optimum, picking is ordered. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the crop is picked a few days early to beat an expected storm that 
could create problems if it hit while the grapes are still on the vine. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes an optimum sugar content is reached before the grapes taste mature, 
so they are left on the vine a little longer. By this, the grower gambles that 
the grapes will gain more flavor without getting an overripe character. 
</P>
<P>
When it's time to begin picking, the grower usually brings in pickers (often 
farm workers) who are told to start picking at one end of a vineyard and pick 
to the other side. 
</P>
<P>
The 1986 growing season in Napa and Sonoma counties was more erratic. 
Intermittent rains throughout the year disrupted the orderly development of the 
grapes; and after each rainfall, clouds and a warm humidity, more enemies of 
maturity, hung around to confound the grower. 
</P>
<P>
But Cabernet is a hardy, rugged vine that can hold its own against the worst 
that nature can dish out, as evidenced by the fact that the word sauvignon can 
be translated to mean "savage" or "wild," indicating a stubborn independence. 
</P>
<P>
Cabernet ripened slowly and when normal harvest time came, most wine makers 
wanted more time on the vine. Yet more rain was expected, so most wine makers 
decided to start picking early to assure that at least some of the crop was in 
just in case the worst happened. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of asking pickers to pick left to right, many chose to pick only 
the ripe blocks of vineyards. This crazy-quilt sort of picking, confusing to 
some picking crews and requiring more supervision, apparently paid off. 
</P>
<P>
It permitted the grower a feeling of some comfort, knowing that some grapes 
were being picked while others needing more maturity were still on the vine. 
And when no more rain came, the harvest wound up quite orderly with superb, 
naturally high acidity and exciting, deep flavors from full maturity. 
</P>
<P>
Each time I have tried two vintages of a winery's Cabernet, 1985 and 1986, side 
by side, the '86 always seems to have slightly better natural acid, but 
slightly lower aroma. The '86s aren't as fleshy and round, certainly not as 
immediately appealing or instantly gratifying as the '85s. The mid-palate is 
leaner and the wine a little less generous. 
</P>
<P>
After tasting through 86 of these 1986 Cabernets at the recently concluded San 
Francisco Fair wine competition at the Parc 55 Hotel, I was convinced this is 
an even greater vintage than '85 for one key reason: lower tannins and better 
overall structure. 
</P>
<P>
A problem with making this statement, however, is that many of these wines are 
not as obviously attractive at present as the '85s because of the slightly more 
reticent nature of the '86s. (But the '85s were far more tannic.) 
</P>
<P>
Still, after we had awarded medals to the '86 wines, there was agreement among 
all four panel members: myself; Alan Phillips, wine maker at Monticello 
Vineyards in the Napa Valley; Fred Dame, master sommelier now with Seagram 
Classics Wine Co., and Nick Ponomareff, editor/publisher of the California 
Grapevine newsletter. All of us said the major difference between this vintage 
and the past few was better structure, especially the lower levels of tannins 
that will not cause any concern as these wines age. 
</P>
<P>
At the San Francisco judging, 30 of the 86 wines, 35%, received medals, a high 
percentage in any competition. And the breakdown was even more impressive -- 10 
silver medals, two gold medals and five double-gold medals. Some of the wines 
listed here are not out yet, but will be released in a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Best wine of the 1986 class, in the estimation of the judges, was Shafer 
Vineyards Cabernet ($17), which offers a deep cherry aroma and extremely long, 
complex flavors in the aftertaste. 
</P>
<P>
Other double-gold winners were Kenwood Jack London Vineyard ($18) -- great 
complexity, but a touch hard; Peju Province ($15) -- an approachable, soft wine 
from a tiny Napa Valley producer; St. Francis ($20) -- youthful fruit, herbal 
complexity and a cassis-blackberry finish, and Forman ($20) -- a virtually 
unobtainable wine of intensely deep, spicy flavors, yet with an understated 
elegance in the finish. 
</P>
<P>
Best values, all of which received silver medals and which came within an 
eyelash of the gold, were J. Lohr ($6) -- a round, complex wine that needs 
little bottle age; Stratford ($11) -- delicate and restrained with subtle 
depth, and A. Rafanelli ($10) of Sonoma County. 
</P>
<P>
The Rafanelli, one of the bargains of the year, won the sweepstakes award 
earlier this year at a wine competition in Reno and a gold medal at the San 
Diego National competition. This rich, complex wine has a toastiness from aging 
in new French oak and a slight dill element to round out superb cherry fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Other wines I enjoyed immensely included Chateau Julien Private Reserve ($12), 
a dense, compact wine bursting with fruit and spice, and Hess Collection 
($13.50), a lean, delicate wine of Bordeauxlike structure, with potential to 
grow. 
</P>
<P>
A number of producers whose house styles I much admire also showed well, though 
a few of these wines are closed in at present and need bottle age to develop. 
Among these are Lambert Bridge Library Selection ($14), a Bordeauxlike wine 
with an earthy spice and classic structure needing years in the bottle, and 
Robert Pecota Kara's Vineyard ($16), which offers extremely deep, violet-tinged 
berrylike fruit as well as cassis, and a potent, rich finish. Also lovely was 
the Eberle ($12) from Paso Robles, which has an intriguing spice aroma but 
which is lean and needs time to expand. 
</P>
<P>
After the San Francisco competition, I was impressed by the new Cafaro Cabernet 
($18) from Joe Cafaro, the longtime Napa Valley wine maker (Keenan, Acacia, now 
Sinskey). The wine displays the familiar toasty quality of French oak, a slight 
chocolaty note, and deep, understated fruit. 
</P>
<P>
I also recently tasted the unreleased 1986 Arrowood Cabernet (about $19), a 
marvel of depth and complexity with cassis and a lean, Bordeauxlike crispness 
in the finish. The wine will be out in September. 
</P>
<P>
In past weeks I have praised such magnificent 1986 Cabernets as Laurel Glen 
($20) with stunning fruit and harmony; Silverado ($13.50), with perfect 
delicacy and complexity; Gan Eden ($18), with toasty chocolate/vanilla/mint 
elements, and Mazzocco ($20), with spicy, herbal notes and dense fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, at a special advance tasting in San Francisco of then-unreleased 
1986 wines, the best wines were Mondavi Reserve, Dunn, Spottswoode, Laurel 
Glen, Grace Family and Beringer Reserve. Tasters said then that even though the 
wines were so young, many of them were approachable. 
</P>
<P>
This lack of excessive tannins was considered a bonus by those attending the 
event (and the group was made up of numerous wine makers). They said excess 
tannin did not in any way help a wine age, that if anything too much 
astringency simply kept the wine hard for a longer period of time. 
</P>
<P>
Ponomareff, writing in his California Grapevine weeks after that event, wrote 
that the '86s "may not be quite as 'showy' as many of the 1984s and 1985s, but 
the wines have excellent acidity." 
</P>
<P>
This perceptive comment remained with me for a year and it has been affirmed 
recently in discussions I've had with a dozen wine makers. I sense broad though 
low-key enthusiasm for the '86s. (They are low-key because they fear the public 
won't believe a third great vintage in a row.) 
</P>
<P>
You may yet read more about the greatness of the 1985 Cabernets from 
California, and certainly many of them are mighty impressive. The richness in 
them is combined with a faint element of Bordeaux complexity. 
</P>
<P>
But classicists would do well to look carefully at the 1986s. In years to come, 
they may prove to be the better vintage of the two. 
</P>
<P>
Wine of the Week: 1987 Bodegas Montecillo Cumbrero Blanco ($5) -- What wine 
lovers love is a clean, uncomplicated, inexpensive white table wine, and this 
is an example. Made entirely from the Viura grape, this attractive wine has 
freshness and still offers depth and richness in the finish.

WINE NOTES: A MARKETING PARTNER FOR GEYSER PEAK SURFACES FROM DOWN UNDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, Times Wine Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Geyser Peak Winery in Sonoma County, which has been looking for a marketing 
partner for about three years, finally found one -- in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Penfolds Wines Pty. Ltd. of Sydney, the largest winery in Australia and a 
company that markets nine million cases of wine per year, announced June 15 
that it had acquired 50% of Geyser Peak. Details of the transaction were not 
announced, but sources within the industry said the deal was worth about $15 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Trione, chairman of Geyser Peak, acquired Geyser Peak from Stroh Brewing 
in 1982 for an estimated $20 million. Geyser Peak reached annual sales of more 
than one million cases with its Summit bag-in-the-box line of jug wine in 1985 
before selling that brand and sticking to premium wines. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Geyser Peak's sales of premium wines rose marginally to 620,000 
cases, but the winery's prices and wine quality have remained moderate. 
</P>
<P>
Penfolds indicated it had further interest in the United States wine market. 
</P>
<P>
The Trione family's vineyard operations, which includes about 1,000 acres of 
Sonoma County land, was not part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Wine maker, author and merchant Alexis Lichine, one of the wine world's most 
dominant figures and a man who openly challenged the existing order of Bordeaux 
even though he owned a chateau there, died in late May at the age of 76. 
</P>
<P>
Lichine, proprietor of Chateau Prieure-Lichine who also maintained a residence 
in New York, entered the wine business as a grape and wine buyer in the 1930s. 
His first venture on his own, as Alexis Lichine and Co., was founded in 1955. 
In addition, Lichine owned three vineyards in Burgundy as well as Chateau 
Lascombes. 
</P>
<P>
His writing on wine began in 1951 with his book "The Wines of France." In 1967 
he published the first edition of "Alexis Lichine's Encyclopedia of Wines and 
Spirits," a monumental work that has been revised and updated numerous times 
and remains one of the great works of wine literature. 
</P>
<P>
It was in that work that Lichine first challenged the legendary 1855 
Classification of Bordeaux, relisting the various properties of the Medoc into 
what he perceived to be a 20th Century rendering based on current quality. 
</P>
<P>
The $850,000 in wine sales generated by feverish bidding for many lots at the 
ninth Napa Valley Wine Auction in early June made wine lovers and winery owners 
fear that the extravagance of a few will sour the auction for others. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, auction organizers and wine makers fear that true wine lovers, 
who don't mind paying $200 to $300 for a bottle of fine and rare wine, will 
look at the $1,000 to $4,000 bids generated for a few items, conclude that 
they'll be left out of the bidding, and will simply forgo the pleasure in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the auction, after high bids of $55,000 for one three-bottle 
lot, $42,000 for another 12-bottle lot, and $38,000 for a series of painted 
bottles, wine makers expressed concern that such bidding would leave the wrong 
impression about their event. 
</P>
<P>
Auctions such as this, and particularly this one, offer few bargains. But in 
years past there have been a number of unique wine offerings that permit the 
dedicated collector to spend a few hundred dollars a bottle for a wine that few 
if any have, and a wine that will offer great pleasure when consumed. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the thrust was on hand-painted bottles, unique carved wooden boxes, 
and specialty items (such as huge 18-liter bottles that contain the equivalent 
of two whole cases under one cork) that some fear will never be consumed, only 
displayed. 
</P>
<P>
And this, they fear, created the climate that generated nearly twice as much 
revenue as the previous record total. 
</P>
<P>
This benefits the medical charities that receive contributions from the 
auction, but it left some wine makers with the feeling that such prices would 
make some bidders jaded. Savvy merchants and collectors who were outbid by the 
high-rollers expressed concern over whether they're wasting their time here. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, some fear that some of this wine has become untouchable in terms the 
average wine lover can understand. The biggest lots of wine this year went to 
folks who vowed to put them on display in wine shops or museums of viniana; 
they said they didn't intend to consume them. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest fear of locals is that this auction will be seen as all glitz and 
no substance, an affair for the wealthy egotist. 
</P>
<P>
The Napa Valley auction, which sells out every year, is a grand event for 
generating publicity about the already-best-known wine-growing region in the 
United States. The side functions (luncheons and dinners, picnics, tastings, 
concerts and vineyard tours) are marvelous for dissecting the industry and 
seeing how its denizens live. 
</P>
<P>
However, some people from the Napa Valley fear that a few ultra-rich may leave 
the wrong impression about this auction and the result could be little more 
than a gathering of the elite. 
</P>
<P>
The scandal rocking the California wine industry in the last few months, in 
which six lawsuits have been filed by the state alleging grape-switching by 
sellers, is just the first official acknowledgement that such a practice is not 
uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
The cases allege that sellers passed off less expensive red varieties as 
Zinfandel, which sells for much more, and passed off less expensive white 
varieties for Chardonnay. 
</P>
<P>
Grape growers and wine makers know that in times when a grape variety grows 
scarce, growers are tempted to state that they have that very variety when both 
grower and wine maker know better. 
</P>
<P>
The old joke -- no longer very funny -- is told about the grower who drives his 
grape-laden truck to the winery and the wine maker asks, "What kind of grapes 
you got?" to which the driver replies, "What kind you need?" 
</P>
<P>
Such a practice is not unusual, say some candid growers. When a variety of 
grape becomes scarce, wine makers have been known to look the other way and 
take the word of the grower. State and federal government agencies are now 
investigating whether there is any contributory negligence. 
</P>
<P>
The situation, however, is little more than an outgrowth of an older system 
that was not nearly as dependent on specific grape varieties as it was on grape 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
Today, for example, Zinfandel grapes are needed to make White Zinfandel wine. 
So many older field blend plantings of red wine grapes that in years past would 
have been classified merely as mixed red suddenly have showed up bearing the 
grower's certification that what's in the bin is Zinfandel. 
</P>
<P>
Such grapes might actually be only half Zinfandel, and in years past that would 
have been just fine. But times change and it no longer is acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
In years past the mixed red bins of grapes were perfectly fine for the wines 
they would make. Wine makers liked such mixes of varieties because they made 
nice red wine that often was called Burgundy or some other such generic name. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, a mix of 40% Zinfandel (for berrylike fruit), 20% Barbera (for 
earthy astringency), 10% Carignane (for light complexity), 10% Alicante 
Bouschet (for deep color), plus 20% of an odd mix of varieties often gave wine 
makers all they needed for a simple, hearty red table wine. 
</P>
<P>
The major differentiating factor then was the quality of the grapes. If they 
were clean, without leaves in the bins; if they had no mold or rot; if they 
were high enough in sugar content and acidity, they were fine and fetched top 
dollar, a higher price than some homogeneous lot (such as 100% Zinfandel) that 
had flaws. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, the game has changed," one wine maker told me. "Now it's more important 
for those grapes to be Zinfandel than for them to be good grapes." He said it's 
better for the grapes to be Zinfandel with rot than for them to be mixed red 
that are of high quality and clean as a whistle. 
</P>
<P>
And this, said the wine maker, has led to culpability on both sides of the 
fence. Growers tell wine makers they have Zinfandel when they really have 
something else; wine makers wink and look the other way. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, with wine like White Zinfandel, so much of which has no varietal 
character, it's obvious that such practices are tempting to wine makers in 
times of shortage of Zinfandel. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, the mixed red lots often produced wine of more character than 100% 
Zinfandel did, but blended wine doesn't have the marketing clout of a varietal 
designation (such as White Zinfandel). So mixed red doesn't sell as well as 
Zinfandel, wink-wink. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, these are strange times for the premium side of the wine business.

RAID NETS A NEST OF EXOTIC SNAKES AT SAN CARLOS HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego County animal control officers on Wednesday seized 26 nonpoisonous, 
exotic snakes -- some more than 10 feet long and weighing more than 35 pounds 
-- from a San Carlos snake breeder, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The snakes, the majority of them pythons, were confiscated about 9 a.m. from 
Gary Sipperley, at his home in the 6700 block of Renkrib Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Some 500 snakes at the house were not seized, but were catalogued by San Diego 
Zoo herpetologists -- experts in the study of snakes -- said Sally Hazzard, 
director of the county's animal control department. 
</P>
<P>
Officials seized the snakes along with two poisonous lizards after charging 
Sipperley with violating San Diego laws prohibiting the keeping of dangerous or 
poisonous reptiles, including adult boas and pythons more than 3 1/2 feet long 
or weighing more than 15 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
City authorities also are investigating whether Sipperley violated business 
zoning laws. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Potential Danger' 
</P>
<P>
"The snakes were seized for a variety of reasons," Hazzard said. "The rule of 
thumb is (to seize) those that pose potential danger to humans." 
</P>
<P>
Sipperley declined to comment. But a spokeswoman for the San Diego Zoo, where 
the snakes and lizards are being housed temporarily, said such reptiles are not 
necessarily dangerous when in the care of expert breeders. 
</P>
<P>
"None of the snakes were venomous, but all the snakes are definitely over 3 1/2 
feet. It was hard to tell their exact length because they were coiled," said 
Georgeanne Irvine, a zoo official. "Boas and pythons are constricting animals, 
so if they're hungry, they could be dangerous. But if someone knows how to 
handle them, they should be OK." 
</P>
<P>
The reptiles will be kept at the zoo until the county Department of Animal 
Control conducts a hearing for Sipperley. Officials said it is uncertain 
whether the breeder will get his snakes and lizards back. 
</P>
<P>
Confiscated were one South American boa constrictor, nine California king 
snakes, three pythons from Sri Lanka, five Australian pythons, eight rare 
albino Burmese pythons and two beaded lizards, Irvine said. 
</P>
<P>
The seizure, authorized by a search warrant, occurred several weeks after a 
citizen filed a complaint against Sipperley, Hazzard said. She said the 
citizen, who was not identified, feared that the snakes would escape.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RESEARCHER NAMED AS AIDE TO HAYDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Adi Liberman, the former research director for last year's Proposition O 
campaign to stop onshore drilling, was named administrative assistant in the 
district office of Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-West Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PROHIBITION EXTENDED FOR OFFENDING FENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rancho Palos Verdes City Council has extended until May, 1990, a moratorium 
on the construction or placement of fences, hedges and walls that significantly 
impair a view from an adjacent neighbor's rear yard. 
</P>
<P>
The council imposed the moratorium May 16 so that it could examine 
view-preservation amendments to the development code. The council will receive 
those recommendations from city staff at its Aug. 1 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
In a related action, the council Tuesday also adopted a second urgency measure 
similarly banning walls or hedges that block side yard views. Fences were 
excluded in the second urgency measure because five-foot fences are required 
around swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
The interim ordinance is effective until Aug. 4, when it can be extended for an 
additional 10 months and 15 days.

SDG&amp;E SCIENTISTS FIND EVIDENCE OF ACTIVITY ON ROSE CANYON FAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY MILLICAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seismologists working for San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. announced Wednesday 
that they have discovered new evidence that proves the Rose Canyon earthquake 
fault line is active, possibly settling an ongoing debate among scientists and 
public officials. 
</P>
<P>
Their findings, if borne out by further testing, would establish the only 
active fault line in the city of San Diego and could bring into play a variety 
of complex state and municipal regulations regarding development in potential 
earthquake areas. 
</P>
<P>
An earthquake "could happen tomorrow or 200 years from now. We don't know yet," 
said Scott Lindvall, a geologist with Lindvall, Richter &amp; Associates. "It's 
something that has the potential to move." 
</P>
<P>
The Lindvall firm, in conjunction with San Diego State University Prof. Tom 
Rockwell, discovered the new evidence while conducting research on the fault 
line in a trench dug in a parking lot at an SDG&amp;E operations center on 
Santa Fe Avenue. SDG&amp;E officials hired the seismologists two years ago to 
identify possible hazards to natural gas lines. 
</P>
<P>
Disruptions in soil patterns indicated that a number of earthquakes have 
occurred in the area -- east of Interstate 5 and north of Interstate 8 -- over 
the past 11,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
City planning officials contacted Wednesday said they were unsure what impact a 
reclassification of the area might have on commercial and residential 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
"The results are less than 24 hours old," said Robert Hawk, senior geologist 
with the city's Building Inspection Department. "I haven't had a chance to look 
over the evidence, so I'm not going to say whether (the fault) is or isn't 
active." 
</P>
<P>
The city currently classifies the fault line as "potentially active" under 
guidelines established by the state's mines division. The city requires 
geologic surveys for development within 500 feet of potentially active fault 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no active faults in the city of San Diego," Hawk said. "We still 
don't have an active one until we see the evidence. . . . Long Beach has one of 
the most active faults around, and they've done just fine." 
</P>
<P>
Regulations regarding development near active fault lines are substantially 
more stringent. For example, specially reinforced foundations are required and 
some lots in the area might be off-limits to any development, one official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The trench was dug Monday and the seismologists made their discovery the same 
day. They were working on a branch of the Rose Canyon Fault, which stretches 
from Mount Soledad through La Jolla Canyon west to the ocean. The branch 
follows a roughly north-south line east of I-5. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a complex zone," Lindvall said. "It's not something where you've got a 
nice, straight line." 
</P>
<P>
Lindvall said it is not clear what hazards the fault line might pose. 
</P>
<P>
"Since it's broken once, it could happen again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The group found indications that breaks have occurred since the topsoil in the 
area was formed about 11,000 years ago, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that since that soil formed, the fault has moved," he said. "The 
topsoil is very indicative of that." 
</P>
<P>
Another study is needed to determine the size of the fault line and the 
potential frequency and scope of future earthquakes, he said. In the meantime, 
charcoal samples from the dig will be tested to verify the group's findings, a 
process that could take many months, Lindvall said. 
</P>
<P>
Branches of the fault run through many expensive residential and commercial 
areas. Because the area has been so widely developed, the SDG&amp;E parking lot 
was one of the few undisturbed areas that could be studied. 
</P>
<P>
Lindvall downplayed the threat to the public and emphasized the importance of 
the settlement of the debate about the fault line. While many scientists have 
contended that the Rose Canyon Fault is active, no proof has been produced to 
meet state requirements. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a really exciting find for the geologic community," Lindvall said.

</P>
<P>
Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller said creation of the new unit, which will be called 
the Urban Street Gang Drug Trafficking Enforcement Program, comes at a time 
when gang- and drug-related violence is rising sharply in many parts of the 
county, particularly in Southeast San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The new unit should be in place by mid-August, and Miller said its members will 
include two prosecutors, two law enforcement officers and support personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The team will construct detailed profiles of young gang leaders suspected of 
drug trafficking, and rank them in order of law enforcement concern and danger 
to society. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to know the relative therapeutic impact on the community as each of 
those criminals is taken off the street," Miller said.

PANEL REJECTS 5-SCREEN THEATER IN ENCINO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A City Council committee Wednesday voted against a proposal to build a 
five-screen movie theater complex in Encino, saying the land should be used for 
retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
The council's Planning and Environment Committee voted to eliminate the 
1,500-seat theater complex and place strict conditions on the rest of the 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Marvin Braude joined Encino residents in urging the committee to 
oppose the large theater complex. He said it would generate severe traffic and 
parking problems that will spill onto neighborhood streets and further clog 
Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"I weighed the pros and cons and felt that this is no place for a regional 
movie theater complex," Braude said. He said a retail center alone would be a 
reasonable use for the land and would not hurt the community or the developer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Work a Little Harder' 
</P>
<P>
"The developer may have to work a little harder in getting a new tenant, but 
this is very prime Ventura Boulevard space," Braude said. "Overall, retail will 
not be harmful." 
</P>
<P>
The unanimous committee vote was an economic disaster for the project, said 
Gail Gordon, the developer's representative. She urged the committee to 
postpone its decision to give Heltzer Enterprises, the development firm, time 
to prepare alternative plans that could include a smaller theater complex. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Hal Bernson, the committee chairman, refused to delay the decision 
but agreed to wait until mid-August to present the plan to the full City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
Braude said a delay would give the developer time to write another plan 
"providing they have something reasonable to propose." 
</P>
<P>
The committee decision upheld a decision by the Board of Zoning Appeals, which 
found that the project would create traffic problems. The development site is 
on Ventura Boulevard between Gaviota and Gloria avenues. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to rejecting the movie theaters, the committee ordered the 
developer to abide by 19 tough development rules. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nightclubs Prohibited 
</P>
<P>
The conditions include prohibiting nightclubs or other late-night uses that 
draw large crowds, banning "high turnover" restaurants and requiring ample 
parking lots without floodlights that could disturb neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald A. Silver, president of Homeowners of Encino, said residents were 
particularly pleased with construction restrictions that prevent the builders 
from allowing work crews to park their personal vehicles along residential 
streets. In addition, trucks and cranes cannot block streets, and all 
construction activities must be contained within the site. 
</P>
<P>
To further minimize project effects on homeowners, the structure's air 
conditioners must have mufflers, and restaurant exhaust fans should "be 
constructed as to absorb grease and odors," the conditions stated.

COUNTY TRANSIT AGENCY SHELVES PLANS TO BUY LAND ALONG RAIL ROUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to homeowner protests, the Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission on Wednesday shelved plans to buy land along a San Fernando Valley 
railroad line that is one of two routes under consideration for a mass transit 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners along the so-called Chandler-Victory route had complained bitterly 
that buying the land suggested that the freight corridor had already been 
selected for the cross-Valley line. 
</P>
<P>
One homeowner leader along the route, which roughly parallels Chandler and 
Victory boulevards from North Hollywood to Warner Center in Woodland Hills, 
Wednesday compared the proposed buying of land to "constructing a gallows 
outside the courthouse before an accused is tried." 
</P>
<P>
The leader, Robert Silver of Van Nuys, afterward called the commission's 
unanimous vote a "small victory." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Freeway Route 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Chandler-Victory route, the commission is studying the 
possibility of building a rail line on pillars along the Ventura Freeway from 
Universal City to Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
That route has also drawn strong opposition from residents, who complain that 
the trains, running every three minutes during rush hours, would bring noise, 
traffic congestion and ground vibrations to their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
While there is strong opposition from those who would be immediately affected 
by the trains, opinion polls indicate widespread support for some sort of 
east-west transit line in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results of a $2.1-million study of the two proposed routes are 
expected in September. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, which is building a countywide network of rail lines, plans to 
pick a route by March and also determine whether it should be part subway or 
ground-level light rail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appraisal Studied 
</P>
<P>
At issue Wednesday was whether to direct the staff to begin an appraisal of the 
little-used freight line, which Southern Pacific announced several months ago 
that it wants to sell. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the commission's Transit Committee voted 3 to 0 to recommend that 
the 11-member commission authorize buying several properties along the corridor 
that are "ideally located for station sites." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the committee voted to recommend that the commission hire an 
appraiser to determine the value of the 14-mile-long corridor itself. 
</P>
<P>
Both recommendations were tabled by commissioners Wednesday at the suggestion 
of Los Angeles City Councilman Nate Holden, who represents the Crenshaw 
district but has developed close ties to Valley rail opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Holden said it would "show some good faith" to withhold any action affecting 
the Chandler-Victory route until the feasibility study is completed this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Transit Committee members had argued that there were competing buyers for the 
properties and that the commission could always sell the land if a different 
route was selected. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Notice Served 
</P>
<P>
But opponents countered that rival buyers are unlikely to purchase and invest 
in improvements to land that the commission has served notice that it might 
acquire by condemnation in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
While placing land purchases along the Victory-Chandler line in limbo, the 
commission authorized appraisals of three other Southern Pacific lines in 
Southern California, including the coast main line, which crosses the Valley 
diagonally from Burbank to Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
That line is being studied for a twice-daily commuter rail line, which, unlike 
light rail, would operate on existing freight tracks and would utilize standard 
rail passenger cars.

STATE SAYS CSUN MUST REINSTATE FIRED PROFESSOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state board has ordered the reinstatement of a longtime Cal State Northridge 
professor who was fired last summer for allegedly offering students "A" grades 
in exchange for selling raffle tickets to raise money for his nonprofit 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The State Personnel Board, in a closed session Tuesday, voted to suspend Eleazu 
S. Obinna for 90 days and then ordered CSUN to give him back his job in the 
Pan-African studies department, said Walter Vaughn, the board's assistant 
executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
The board upheld the recommendation of Administrative Law Judge Byron Berry 
who, in a written opinion, said that there was not enough evidence to support 
university allegations that during the spring, 1988, semester, Obinna offered 
his students A's for selling $100 worth of raffle tickets to benefit the United 
Crusade Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hearings on Campus 
</P>
<P>
Berry wrote the opinion after listening to seven days of testimony during 
appeal hearings held on the CSUN campus in November, 1988, and February. 
</P>
<P>
Berry said Wednesday that he recommended that Obinna -- a tenured, 17-year CSUN 
professor -- be suspended for unprofessional conduct for "selling tickets in 
connection with a class." 
</P>
<P>
"It is not an appropriate class activity," Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
Obinna, 54, could not be reached for comment on the decision. University 
officials declined to comment because the incident is a confidential personnel 
matter, spokeswoman Ann Salisbury said. 
</P>
<P>
The board, at Berry's recommendation, also dismissed allegations that Obinna 
lied to superiors about class requirements for the upper-division course, Field 
Work in the African-American Community, to cover up the alleged grade-selling 
scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Four CSUN students testified in November that they were told by Obinna and 
former part-time CSUN instructor Willie J. Bellamy that the only work required 
for the three-unit course was the sale of 20 $5 raffle tickets. The students 
said they were told they did not have to attend class or complete any other 
assignments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Denied Allegations 
</P>
<P>
Bellamy, who was fired but did not appeal, denied telling students that they 
would receive A's for selling the tickets. He is now a religious studies 
student at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Obinna testified in February that he never discussed "sales for a grade." He 
said students were asked if they would volunteer to sell tickets. To earn their 
grade, students were required to go on field trips, perform community service 
and write a term paper, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Obinna's testimony, four of the 83 students enrolled in his 
class testified that they never were offered grades in exchange for selling 
raffle tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Obinna's attorney, Francis E. Smith, said in closing arguments that even if 
some students had concluded that they could earn a grade by selling the 
tickets, "the discipline sought is nevertheless unreasonable." 
</P>
<P>
Colleagues of Obinna had testified that they believed the Nigerian-born Obinna 
was fired because of his blunt and often outspoken criticism of university 
officials and policies in the past. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Slight Error' 
</P>
<P>
Smith on Wednesday said that the board's decision indicated "that at most there 
was a slight error in judgment" for encouraging the sale of the tickets by his 
students. The university prohibits the sale of raffle tickets by outside 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The raffle money was to have been used by the foundation to create a community 
center in Pacoima to assist black residents, Obinna said at the February 
hearing. The raffle, which offered a donated sports car as the prize, was 
subsequently canceled and the money has been held in trust pending its return 
to ticket buyers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The state attorney general's office sent an auditor to hear testimony in the 
Obinna hearing but Deputy Atty. Gen. James Cordi said Wednesday that his office 
is no longer actively investigating Obinna's foundation. "The issue was the 
returning of the money, and most of the money paid by people has been 
returned," Cordi said. 
</P>
<P>
Students began complaining to university officials about the ticket-selling in 
April, 1988, according to university memorandums filed in the case. The 
university on April 28, 1988, announced the cancellation of Obinna's classes in 
connection with an alleged grade-selling scheme. 
</P>
<P>
After a campus investigation, CSUN President James Cleary on May 23, 1988, sent 
a letter to Obinna telling the professor that he was being fired for 
"unprofessional conduct and dishonesty" for the alleged grade-selling scheme 
and then for denying it later when asked by his superiors. 
</P>
<P>
Obinna denied the charges and appealed the firing. He continued to draw his 
salary throughout the appeal hearings, university officials said.

JURY ACQUITS MAN OF 2 SLAYINGS, CITES WITNESS'S INCONSISTENCIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 32-year-old Colombian man was acquitted Wednesday in the drug-related 
execution-style slaying of two men. 
</P>
<P>
A Van Nuys Superior Court jury found Bertulfo Loaiza not guilty of the Aug. 13, 
1987, slayings of Manuel Abreu, 32, and Javier Restropo, 26, both of Van Nuys. 
The two men had been stabbed in the chest, and Restropo was shot in the face at 
close range. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said the victims had been handcuffed and gagged before they were 
killed, allegedly because they owed Loaiza money for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Susan M. Speer said outside the courtroom Wednesday that she 
was not surprised at the jury's verdict. "I expected it. We knew it was going 
to be tough. We had a small chance . . . and we didn't want to let him walk." 
</P>
<P>
Jury members said afterward that there were too many inconsistencies in the 
testimony of the prosecution's only witness, Gloria Mendez Herrera, to find 
Loaiza guilty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Danny Did It' 
</P>
<P>
Herrera, former manager of the apartment complex where the killings took place, 
testified that Abreu managed to make his way to her apartment and tell her that 
"Danny did it" moments before he died. Herrera, 32, said she knew "Danny" to be 
Loaiza. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutors failed to find another witness to corroborate Herrera's 
testimony that Loaiza's nickname was "Danny." 
</P>
<P>
Herrera also testified that she was certain she was watching the movie "La 
Bamba" on television the night of the killings, even though "La Bamba" had not 
yet been released. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, defense attorney Mark E. Overland argued that Herrera was not a 
credible witness because she did not tell police that she knew who the killer 
was until months after the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
Herrera testified that she was hesitant to tell police everything she knew 
because she feared for her life.

LONG BEACH HARBOR COMMISSION TO UPGRADE BOARD ROOM FOR $1 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harbor commissioners in Long Beach have decided to spend an estimated $1 
million to refurbish their wood-paneled board room. 
</P>
<P>
The 1960s-era, lime-green chairs where the commissioners sit with assembled 
staff and press for their brief weekly meetings will be replaced by 25 new 
seats costing an average of $960 each. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners will no longer have to swivel their chairs and crane their necks 
to look up at a projection screen on the rear wall of their meeting room on the 
top floor of the Port of Long Beach headquarters building. Each person will 
have a video screen built into the desktop. 
</P>
<P>
They approved the plans Tuesday over the sole complaint of a Long Beach man who 
questioned the price tag for the proposed renovation. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope you would give serious consideration (before) spending a million 
dollars to upgrade a board room," said Larry Goodhue. He said the existing 
board room appears to be serviceable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not a Bad Room' 
</P>
<P>
"Quite frankly, when I came in here I was a little surprised," he said as he 
peered at commissioners assembled at the head of a horseshoe-shaped table. "As 
I walk in here, I've got to tell you, this is not a bad room." 
</P>
<P>
The board voted for the improvements without comment. Afterward, commissioners 
said in interviews that the board room has remained largely unchanged for 30 
years and needs upgrading. 
</P>
<P>
To prove the point, Commissioner David L. Hauser reached underneath his 
high-back chair and pulled out a handful of dust that looked like disintegrated 
foam rubber. 
</P>
<P>
He said the renovation has "been discussed and discussed for a long, long 
time." The board agreed to go ahead because it decided to stay in its aging 
administration building, rather than moving to a newer facility. 
</P>
<P>
"It's long overdue," Commission Chairman George F. Talin Sr. said. "They 
haven't spent a cent in that board room for 30 years." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refurbishing 
</P>
<P>
Besides $24,000 for new chairs, the commission approved spending $225,000 for 
audio-visual equipment and another $136,970 to have it installed. 
</P>
<P>
The board estimates that it will pay out another $140,000 for the "fabrication, 
delivery and installation of a board room conference table, three ancillary 
tables, dividing rail, lectern, wainscoting, custom doors, marble inlays and 
custom mill work." 
</P>
<P>
Paul E. Brown, the port's acting executive director, said the board room chairs 
are so old that springs are beginning to poke through, lighting is poor, the 
acoustics are lousy because the ceilings are too high, and the sound system 
doesn't work very well. "Our goal is to get a board room more functional and up 
to date," he said. 
</P>
<P>
State and federal legislative committees also use the room periodically for 
public hearings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the commissioners could have taken stopgap measures to fix the room's 
shortcomings, such as clamping a floodlight on the speaker's podium. But the 
port has a long-term commitment to staying in the building and should fix the 
problems permanently, even if it costs $1 million, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"A million dollars doesn't buy what a million dollars used to buy for us," he 
said. "We don't like the fact it's costing a million dollars either." 
</P>
<P>
Three City Council members, reached for comment, said they have no major 
disagreements with the port commissioners' decision. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Old Facility' 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very old facility. . . . Sometimes it costs a lot to update a 
building," said Councilman Ray Grabinski. "It's a great deal of money, but it 
would be easy for that same organization to say, 'This is an old building. 
Let's go spend the money and build a (new) one somewhere else.' " 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Warren Harwood said that the harbor board's meeting room needs 
improvement, especially the lighting. While noting "it's a lot of money," he 
said harbor commissioners can justify it by saying they need an impressive 
board room in which to meet with visiting dignitaries and conduct port 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Tom Clark, who has called for spending more money to fight crime, 
said he received a call from a resident complaining about the port's spending 
plans. He said he tried to explain that the use of port funds is restricted. 
</P>
<P>
The Harbor Commission administers the hugely successful Port of Long Beach, 
which collects revenue from rents and leases from businesses that operate in 
the port. By law, the revenue cannot be diverted to the city's general fund to 
fight crime, buy park space or finance other civic improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard for people to understand how you can put a million dollars into the 
board room, and we're indicating there are serious shortages in police and 
recreational resources," Clark said. "It does tend to . . . make it appear 
resources are not being put to their highest use."

HOUSE OKS MONEY FOR LAKE AT HANSEN DAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The House of Representatives approved a $780,000 expenditure Wednesday to help 
restore the lake at Hansen Dam Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) included the money in the Energy and 
Water Appropriations Bill of 1989, which passed the House and was sent to the 
Senate. If passed by the Senate, the bill must be signed by President Bush 
before any money could actually be released to the Los Angeles Department of 
Recreation and Parks. 
</P>
<P>
The lake, once a center for boating, swimming, fishing and water skiing in the 
northeast San Fernando Valley, filled with silt and debris during floods in 
1969 and 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Money included in Wednesday's bill comes from a fund generated by fees paid by 
Bill Blomgren, who has a contract to harvest gravel left behind by the floods. 
Berman sponsored a bill in May, 1988, to earmark those royalty payments for the 
park revitalization and lake restoration. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the $49.4-billion state budget approved Wednesday by the Assembly and 
sent to the state Senate contains $500,000 for the lake and surrounding 
recreation area. Those funds were sought by Assemblyman Richard Katz 
(D-Sylmar), Assemblywoman Marian W. La Follette (R-Northridge) and Sen. Alan 
Robbins (D-Tarzana). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Master Plan 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which owns the land around the dam and leases 
it to the city, is developing a master plan for the area. That plan, paid for 
with $200,000 from the gravel trust fund, is expected in November. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing release of that $200,000 last year, Berman vowed that a 20-acre 
lake would be completed by the end of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
However, on Wednesday, Berman aide Marc Litchman said 1991 would be a better 
estimate. The lake will cost about $1 million to build, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were being too optimistic, but I think we're being realistic now," Litchman 
said. "We've got to go through this master plan process by law. It all takes 
time." 
</P>
<P>
A pond created during the gravel removal has been declared a community hazard 
by the Corps of Engineers because its walls are too steep. Twice, most recently 
in April, corps officials have called for it to be filled in with sand. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Ernani Bernardi is fighting that order because he believes that 
the pond is at least a start on a larger lake.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEW LOOK AT BUSINESS TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The El Segundo City Council has scheduled another public hearing Wednesday to 
discuss restructuring a proposal that would increase taxes on businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from Hughes Aircraft Co., Rockwell International Corp., Northrop 
Corp., and the Chamber of Commerce told the City Council on Tuesday that they 
would like more time to offer feasible alternatives to the council plan. 
</P>
<P>
The council is considering a payroll tax paid by the employer based on a 
percentage of the amount spent on wages and salary. A draft of the ordinance 
was released by the city Friday. The city now assesses a $60-per-employee 
business tax, which was adopted in 1986. Business officials complained Tuesday 
that it would be burdensome to compute a payroll tax. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo is considering the tax increase because it has projected a deficit 
of at least $1.6 million in the $20-million operating budget for the 1989-90 
fiscal year.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA CLARITA RESTRICTS BILLBOARD SIZE, SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Continuing its war on urban clutter, the Santa Clarita City Council has passed 
a strict ordinance limiting the size and placement of billboards. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, unanimously approved Tuesday night, was developed by the 
Planning Commission after a year of study. At one point, the commission 
considered banning new billboards entirely, said Kyle Kollar, community 
development director. The commission eventually decided to allow new billboards 
under stringent guidelines, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the ordinance, the council could refuse to grant a zone change or a 
permit for a billboard if the council decided the advertising would lower 
property values or reduce the public's enjoyment of an area. The ordinance also 
restricts the size of billboards to 300 square feet. Previously, billboard 
companies could erect signs of 800 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the council refused to allow advertisements on the side of 
municipal buses, saying the advertising contributed to visual blight. This 
year, the council passed an ordinance making it illegal to place commercial 
handbills on car windshields on private property.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL PANEL CHANGES ZONING AT WOODLAND HILLS 
CHURCH SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A City Council committee cleared the way Wednesday for leaders of the Jehovah's 
Witnesses to continue negotiations to sell a landmark Woodland Hills auditorium 
to an apartment developer. 
</P>
<P>
The council's Planning and Environment Committee overturned a ruling by the 
Planning Commission and determined that the city had erred in drawing a zoning 
map for the site stipulating what kind of development will be permitted on the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
The boundary in error showed that the developer would be restricted to building 
280 to 300 apartments instead of a proposed 350-unit complex at the site of the 
former Valley Music Theater, 20600 Ventura Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
The property is owned by the Jehovah's Witnesses, who use it as their regional 
assembly hall. The religious group has outgrown the auditorium and wants to 
sell the land and move to a larger site, possibly in Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
Confusion over the zoning boundaries had stalled negotiations on the sale of 
the land because the buyer, Jay Wilton, was unsure what he would be permitted 
to build. 
</P>
<P>
The new zoning boundary enlarges the land available for multifamily housing. 
Jehovah's Witness representative Karen Black said the exact number of units 
that will be built has not been determined. She said the group will work with 
nearby homeowners who want a wide greenbelt to separate the apartments from 
their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"Today's decision allows us to move forward with our plans," Black said. "We're 
happy that the city acknowledged their mistake." 
</P>
<P>
The unanimous council committee decision still needs approval by the City 
Council and Mayor Tom Bradley.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEIGHBORS SHARE TRANSIT FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rolling Hills City Council agreed Monday to give $23,000 in special county 
transit funds to its neighbors, Palos Verdes Estates and Rolling Hills Estates, 
because Rolling Hills, as a gated community with no public streets, cannot use 
the funds. 
</P>
<P>
The money, which is Rolling Hills' 1989-90 allotment of Proposition A funds, 
will be divided equally between the two peninsula neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
The council excluded a third neighbor, Rancho Palos Verdes, from a portion of 
the Rolling Hills allotment, saying that PV Transit, a door-to-door 
transportation service administered by Rancho Palos Verdes, is too costly a way 
to use the funds. The bulk of Rancho Palos Verdes' transit funds go to PV 
Transit. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes Estates and Rolling Hills Estates are also involved in the 
dial-a-van transit service. Palos Verdes Estates recently agreed to continue 
its involvement in the service until January, when it will reevaluate continued 
participation. Rolling Hills Estates is monitoring its participation in the 
program because of the effect that a Palos Verdes Estates decision to 
discontinue participation might have on the transit system. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not averse to giving Rolling Hills Estates and Palos Verdes Estates the 
funds," Councilwoman Gordana Swanson said. "They have shown prudence."

CAGER LEONARD TAYLOR GOES FROM WHERE? TO WHEN? AND WHY NOT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As National Basketball Assn. draft day dawned Tuesday, Leonard Taylor's 
horoscope said: "You're in your element now. Travel conditions are go . . . 
fate supports your good intentions." 
</P>
<P>
But when the NBA's first nighttime draft was completed, Taylor found he was a 
not-ready-for-prime-time player. 
</P>
<P>
The husky 6-foot-8 UC Berkeley graduate -- who was all but assured he would be 
a late first-round or early second-round pick -- sat in his Inglewood home 
Tuesday, growing more and more mystified as he was passed over for long shots, 
dark horses and unknown Yugoslavs. Finally, at nearly midnight, the draft was 
over and Taylor was still a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
The outlook isn't exactly bleak. Before the draft had ended, Golden State 
Warriors Coach Don Nelson had called to invite him to camp, and the champion 
Detroit Pistons did the same minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
Still, in a draft full of surprises, everyone in Taylor's corner was caught off 
guard. Taylor had done well in several postseason camps that the scouts rate 
heavily, and he had gone to Detroit for a personal workout and physical. 
Detroit had called earlier Tuesday to let him know the Pistons were interested. 
The Miami Heat had called several times, and Milwaukee had shown interest as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
As the draft began, Taylor appeared loose, lounging in a Nike T-shirt and 
blue-and-white-checked shorts, joking with family members and friends. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Goodwin, a friend and agent representing California Diversified 
Enterprises, tried to handicap the draft and confidently felt Taylor would go 
somewhere in the draft, which was trimmed to two rounds this year. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's mother, Bernice, wasn't as calm. As the draft started, she said: "This 
is worse than waiting for one of your games." Goodwin grinned and said: "She's 
been a nervous wreck for two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, the former South Bay Player of the Year out of St. Bernard High, had a 
career at Cal akin to his checkered shorts. When he was on the court, he was 
one of the best players on the West Coast -- Freshman of the Year in the 
Pacific 10 Conference, third-leading scorer in Cal history with 1,608 points 
and All-Pac 10 this past season, averaging 19.7 points and 8.2 rebounds. Scouts 
liked his big body and soft perimeter touch. For draft purposes he was listed 
with the power forwards; Taylor preferred to think of himself as a shooting 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
But Taylor missed a season and a half in his career because of injuries, 
including a neck problem in his junior year that threatened to end his career. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor believed his strong showing as a senior and in the all-star games, as 
well as an injury-free season, had vastly improved his draft standing. "I'm 
fine. I had three good camps. No problems," he said as the draft started. 
Sacramento, headed by Kings vice president and NBA legend Bill Russell, had the 
first pick. The phone rang in Inglewood. Taylor answered and announced: "It's 
Bill." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't. In fact, the first surprise was about to unfold. The Kings took 
Louisville's Pervis Ellison. Goodwin, the agent, shook his head. "Bill 
(Russell) is sick," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In quick succession, Duke's Danny Ferry, North Carolina's J. R. Reid, 
Oklahoma's Stacey King, Louisiana Tech's Randy White and Georgia Tech's Tom 
Hammonds were among the first nine picks. "The power forwards are going quick. 
That's good," Goodwin noted. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor spent much of his time perusing the draft predictions in a newspaper and 
said he wasn't nervous. "This is exciting. Whatever happens, happens," he said. 
The only signs of anxiety were in gently chiding his mother for tying up the 
phone and in expressing frustration with the TV banter and commercials between 
picks. He talked to the television: "Cut . . . cut. Push fast forward." 
</P>
<P>
As the first round went into its second hour, Goodwin announced: "We're getting 
to LT (Leonard Taylor) time." 
</P>
<P>
At 6 p.m. -- about an hour and a half into the draft -- there was a commercial 
for the NBA with the message, "Be there." Taylor answered, "I'll be there." 
Shortly after, Boston College guard Dana Barros was a surprise No. 16 pick. The 
two had become friendly at a postseason camp. "Dana was right," Taylor said. 
"He said he'd go first round." 
</P>
<P>
By now, Taylor's mother was pacing and attending to grandchildren. Taylor 
remained cool. "This is fun," he said. "You gotta enjoy it. I don't have 
pressure. I just start packing." 
</P>
<P>
But a few minutes later, with the 20th pick, the Chicago Bulls drafted an 
unknown forward, Jeff Sanders out of Georgia Southern. For the first time, 
Taylor began to sense things were not sticking to the script. "Oh my goodness," 
he said, "Jeff Sanders? That was a surprise." 
</P>
<P>
Goodwin was shocked: "(Sanders) played terrible at the camps. Sanders is a 
second-round draft choice." Goodwin's confidence was being shaken. "We're down 
where we should be, but it's all screwed up." 
</P>
<P>
A few picks later, Phoenix selected Arizona forward Anthony Cook, a Pac-10 
rival. Taylor had predicted the move. The first-round came down to the last two 
picks -- the Lakers and Pistons. "I heard the Lakers are looking for a guard. 
That's what A. C. (Green) said," Taylor said. Instead, the Lakers took 
Yugoslavian center Vlade Divac, another shocker. 
</P>
<P>
It was Detroit's turn. There was noticeable anxiety in the living room as the 
announcement was made -- Detroit took Illinois' Kenny Battle. The first round 
was over. As the final round began, with Miami holding the first pick, hopes 
were high. Goodwin said: "Miami called twice today." Miami took Syracuse guard 
Sherman Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
As the second round stretched on, Bernice Taylor asked: "You think they forgot 
your name?" 
</P>
<P>
With the draft approaching three hours, Taylor was out of the room and 
Goodwin's spirits had fallen. "It would definitely be unexpected (if Taylor 
wasn't chosen). It's unexpected we're this far down. I'm so confused now I just 
want to hear the name," Goodwin said. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't to be. By the time the second round reached the final picks, Goodwin 
was taking a different stance: "It's almost getting to the point where it might 
be better to be a free agent and pick our own team." 
</P>
<P>
With the 50th pick, the New York Knicks took another Pac-10 rival, Brian 
Quinnett of Washington State. "I don't believe this," Taylor said. "I don't 
know what to tell you fellas. Apparently somebody knows something we don't." 
</P>
<P>
At as the draft reached the last pick, the phone rang. It was Golden State's 
Nelson, inviting Taylor to camp. Four minutes later he called back again. "I 
would definitely love to play," Taylor told him, then told the room, "He said 
they're very interested. He said I have an excellent shot of making the team." 
</P>
<P>
Two minutes later Detroit called, telling him to keep his hopes up and inviting 
him to camp. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked about it before," Goodwin said, "and there was a small chance he 
wouldn't be drafted. At the camps he clearly outplayed a number of players (who 
were drafted), including Stacey King. I have to wonder what happened after 
that. It's interesting that Detroit would call immediately after. Clearly he 
will be playing. It's just a question of where. Something positive will 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
So there is life after the NBA draft, and Taylor said he had overcome enough 
adversity not to be worried. "I've overcome much more -- harder things than 
that," he said. "That's life." 
</P>
<P>
The day after the draft, Taylor's horoscope read: "Moon in your sign highlights 
intuition, timing, judgment, sex appeal. Display your colors. . . . You've 
extricated yourself from what could have been embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Taylor's path is still in the stars. It just seemed like a roundabout way 
to go Tuesday.

ILLNESS RUMOR MAY HAVE COST TAYLOR SPOT IN DRAFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
How costly is a rumor? 
</P>
<P>
In Leonard Taylor's case, a mistaken report of illness may have cost him a spot 
in Tuesday's National Basketball Assn. draft. But Wednesday, after some 
detective work, things looked brighter. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Goodwin, Taylor's agent, was so mystified when Taylor wasn't chosen 
Tuesday that he made phone calls Wednesday and came up with this scenario: 
</P>
<P>
Taylor attended a scouting camp in Chicago but left early, returning to 
California when his grandmother became ill. Many of the teams' scouts hadn't 
yet arrived in Chicago and word began to circulate that it was Taylor who was 
ill. 
</P>
<P>
When draft day came, Detroit reportedly put out the word that it would draft 
him 27th if he was still available. Milwaukee said it would use the third pick 
in the second round if Detroit passed. In both cases, he was available and both 
teams passed him over, making other teams think that there was something wrong. 
He went undrafted. "When Detroit and Milwaukee passed, it made other teams 
leery," Goodwin said. 
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday, however, 10 teams had contacted Taylor and it appears he will get 
a good shot at making the NBA and can take his pick of Detroit, Golden State, 
San Antonio, Boston, Philadelphia, Milwaukee, Houston, Washington, Chicago and 
Miami. Goodwin said several of the teams are willing to discuss a guaranteed 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
"He's in a much better situation than it appeared yesterday," Goodwin said. 
"Leonard's on Cloud 10 now. He's actually in a better situation than a lot of 
second round picks." ALAN DROOZ

CITY 4-A TENNIS CHAMPION VINCE MACKEY LONG ON POTENTIAL, A LITTLE SHORT ON CASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY RIPTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vince Mackey is apparently a budding Arthur Ashe, but his flowering on the 
tennis court could be ampered if he doesn't find a patron as Ashe did. 
</P>
<P>
Ashe, an NCAA titlist at UCLA and a Wimbledon champion, was helped along the 
road to tennis greatness by Dr. Walter Johnson. Johnson, a black physician, was 
a patron to Ashe, Althea Gibson and other young black players for years in 
Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Mackey, it seems, could also use a helping hand. 
</P>
<P>
A University High School senior this past school year, Mackey recently won the 
Los Angeles City 4-A singles championship and is ranked eighth among Southern 
California junior players age 18 and younger. 
</P>
<P>
In three years with the University High varsity, he lost only two singles 
matches -- last year in the City singles final to then-sophomore teammate Jason 
Clark (when Mackey had a strained left shoulder) and in the 1987 City final to 
Giora Payes, a sophomore on the UCLA varsity last season. 
</P>
<P>
At last spring's Ojai Invitational, long a prestigious amateur tournament, he 
reached the semifinals in his age group, beating a couple of higher-ranked 
players. 
</P>
<P>
University High Coach Tom Anderson said that Mackey, a tall (6-2), slender 
youngster with a powerful serve and forehand, has unlimited potential. Anderson 
added, however, that his quest to reach the top among the nation's junior 
players has suffered because of limited finances. 
</P>
<P>
Oscar Ringel, a teaching professional who has been giving Mackey lessons for 
about a year, said that there "could be no end to his level of play. 
</P>
<P>
"He can develop. He is tall, strong and very, very fast. He has a big serve and 
is a big hitter. It's a question of how much hard work he'll put in to get to a 
high level of play." 
</P>
<P>
He apparently is willing to work. Anderson said that Mackey has practiced 
harder than any other player he has coached and has great determination. 
</P>
<P>
Mackey, who plans to sign a letter of intent with Cal State Long Beach, is 
determined to play in some national junior tournaments this summer. But how 
many tournaments he gets to will depend on how much he saves from his job at a 
health club snack bar and how well a friend's not-so-late model car is running. 
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes to compete in the national hard courts championships that 
begin July 7 in Burlingame and later in the clay courts tournament in Kentucky 
and the national junior championships in Kalamazoo, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said he would "put Vince up against anyone in these tournaments" and, 
if he overcomes his financial problems, "it will be to his advantage. He'll be 
a better person for his struggle." 
</P>
<P>
He said Mackey didn't make it to one junior tournament recently because the car 
"broke down. There have been (other) times he hasn't gotten to tournaments, and 
he has been playing with borrowed rackets for most of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Mackey's inability to get to tournaments has kept him from attaining a high 
national ranking, Anderson said, and absence from national competition has 
caused him to be overlooked by college recruiters. "In tennis right now, the 
major colleges are looking for the top 10 players in the world," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
"(Colleges) are so concerned with rankings when they consider who should get 
scholarships that they forget about raw talent. I think wherever Vince goes, 
he'll be a gem. 
</P>
<P>
"Pete Smith (the Cal State Long Beach men's tennis coach) is to be 
congratulated on having a knowledge of what's going on in junior tennis." 
</P>
<P>
Mackey was not overlooked by UCLA Coach Glenn Bassett. Bassett said: "I think 
he is a very, very good junior. He is left-handed and quite an athlete and will 
probably be a real good college player. He just hasn't scratched the surface of 
his ability. 
</P>
<P>
"We sure would like to have had him, but when we were recruiting him he wasn't 
doing that much with his ability." 
</P>
<P>
Mackey is the third Los Angeles City prep champion that Ringel has given 
lessons to. The others, both Fairfax High graduates, were Jeff Klaparda, the 
former UCLA star who is now on the pro circuit, and UCLA's Payes. Klaparda was 
a two-time City prep singles champion, and Payes won three consecutive City 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
Ringel said that Mackey has been held back because he did not take private 
lessons until late in his prep career. "I tell him he's not aggressive enough 
to mooch, (that) he doesn't hustle enough for his own benefit. 
</P>
<P>
"He should have been much further along. He has great potential, but he's 
losing valuable time . . . . He has world-class speed and power, all the 
attributes." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said that Mackey has had to work hard to attain about a B-minus 
average at University High. He said that going to Cal State Long Beach will be 
good for him because there will be less academic pressure than at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"Vince is a great athlete, but he is also a teeth-gritter. He is a 
conscientious, worrying type of kid." 
</P>
<P>
Mackey's worrywart approach to life does not seem to go with him when he steps 
on a tennis court. "Every time I go on the court, it's fun," he said. "It's 
interesting -- like a challenge, a battle -- and I want to be No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said he is advising Mackey "to stay with tennis. I think he can make 
it in the pros. A year in college would be appropriate for him before he gets 
to the next level." 
</P>
<P>
To make the transition to the pros, the youngster will have to develop a strong 
serve-and-volley game, Anderson said. "He has had such success from the base 
line as a junior that his game might lack something. He has size and quickness, 
but he needs to work on his backhand." Mackey thinks he also has to improve on 
his return of service. 
</P>
<P>
Ringel also believes that Mackey has what it takes to become a winner in the 
pros and should give it his best shot. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if you never make it," Ringel said, "you must do what you think is right. 
Failing is better than not trying at all." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said that failure doesn't seem to be in Mackey's vocabulary. "He's 
done nothing on or off the court that I haven't been proud of. He has survived 
the rigors of academics and economics."

STEINBERG EYES AMATEUR GOLF CHAMPIONSHIP; 
</P>
<P>
VAN NUYS OPTOMETRIST ADVANCES TO QUARTERFINALS; GREENE LOSES IN 2ND MATCH 
</P>

Craig Steinberg of Van Nuys advanced to the quarterfinals of the 78th 
California Golf Assn. Amateur Championship on the Monterey Peninsula on 
Wednesday, but 42-year-old Buz Greene of Thousand Oaks was eliminated in the 
afternoon after winning his morning match. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg, 31, an optometrist with a practice in Studio City, defeated John 
Adams of Costa Mesa, 2 and 1, in the opening round of match play at Pebble 
Beach. He came back to post a 5-and-4 victory over Earl Morley Jr. of Los 
Angeles in the afternoon to make it into today's quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't too tough of a match in the morning," Steinberg said. "I didn't play 
very well, but I was 2-over-par after nine holes and was still two (holes) up. 
I just stayed there until it was over. 
</P>
<P>
"In the afternoon I started putting real well and that saved me." 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg will play Tom Kennaday of Pacific Grove, a member of Cal's golf team. 
</P>
<P>
The semifinals will be played this afternoon and the 36-hole championship match 
is scheduled for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg advanced to the quarterfinals of the state amateur last year but lost 
his next match to Bob Marten of Alamo. Steinberg, who played for four years at 
USC, is the 1988 Southern California Amateur champion. 
</P>
<P>
Greene, who shot a 69 on Monday to lead all golfers in the first round of medal 
play, stumbled to a 78 on Tuesday and made the 32-man match play field by just 
one stroke. On Wednesday, he started strongly and defeated 48-year-old Roly 
LaMontagne of Stockton, 1-up. Greene was 1-over-par on the front nine but still 
was ahead, 2-up. He lost the 10th hole to LaMontagne and won the 11th, then won 
the 13th hole with a bogey to go 3-up. 
</P>
<P>
LaMontagne came back on the 14th hole with an eagle and won the 17th hole with 
a par to cut Greene's lead to 1-up. But both parred the 18th hole, giving 
Greene the narrow victory. 
</P>
<P>
In his afternoon match, Greene was beaten, 3-and-2, by Kennaday. 
</P>
<P>
In other quarterfinal matches Casey Boyns of Pacific Grove faces Fresno State 
All-American David Sutherland; Pat Duncan of Rancho Santa Fe faces Dave 
Stockton Jr., an All-American from USC and son veteran PGA player Dave 
Stockton; and Jack Spradlin of San Diego will take on Ben Furth of San 
Francisco. All remaining matches will be played at Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Boyns, 33, made it to the quarterfinals by defeating Steve Clark of Long Beach 
and Steve Bogan of Los Angeles.

DEEP-SEA FISHING TRIP JUST WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A group of doctors from Panorama City Community Hospital usually take 
Wednesdays off to play golf. Last week, instead of them making their rounds on 
the golf course, the prescription called for a deep-sea fishing excursion on a 
charter to Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the 31 physicians aboard the El Dorado out of Long Beach Sportfishing 
caught a limit of calico bass, and Milton Beck of Panorama City won the jackpot 
with a 25-pound white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Herb Dorphlin was the bag-weight winner. With help from his daughter, his catch 
weighed 60 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Barak Glass caught the heaviest barracuda of the day, a 7 1/2-pounder, and 
Shivhays Singh caught the largest calico bass, 6 3/4 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Caldron of activity: Summer fishing is heating up and sand bass continue to 
play a major role. Joining the limit catches, calico bass now have started 
feeding voraciously. 
</P>
<P>
The hot spots on day and twilight trips are Horseshoe Kelp and Rocky Point. 
Fishing at Catalina with live squid brings a wide-open bite. 
</P>
<P>
The Outerlimits from L. A. Harbor Sportfishing worked Catalina over the weekend 
and 36 white sea bass were taken. 
</P>
<P>
George Hawking of West Los Angeles won the jackpot with a 38-pounder. 
</P>
<P>
Sportfishing: At Port Hueneme Sportfishing: George Sanders of Simi Valley, 
fishing on the Erna B, won the jackpot with an 8 1/2-pound calico bass. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagle fished the Hueneme coast and anglers chalked up 185 calico bass, 30 
sand bass, 10 rockfish and one barracuda. 
</P>
<P>
The Ellie M anglers landed 90 calico bass, 30 sand bass and a barracuda. 
</P>
<P>
At Cisco's Landing in Oxnard: The Sea Watch fished the outside kelp and anglers 
returned with 211 calico bass, 20 sand bass and one halibut. 
</P>
<P>
The Island Tac worked the shore kelp and landed 120 calico bass and three white 
sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Freshwater: Lee Hunt of Northridge, fishing at Castaic Lake, used spinner bait 
and caught and released an 11 1/2-pound bass. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Miller of North Hollywood landed a 14-pound catfish at Castaic Lake. 
</P>
<P>
Russell Schultz of Van Nuys fished Santa Ana River Lakes and landed 22 pounds 
of catfish.

'SICKIE' MARCIKIC IS HOLDING THE ATTENTION OF MASTERS SWIMMERS IN PROGRAM AT 
UCSD 
</P>

<P>
Motivation by curiousity. It's not a concept widely used by coaches training 
athletes with visions of either national recognition or Olympic fame. 
</P>
<P>
But for one "Sickie," it's working. 
</P>
<P>
Ron (Sickie) Marcikic is the man, sometimes clown, behind the UCSD Masters 
swimming program. 
</P>
<P>
Marcikic has the task of holding the interest of 325 participants, swimmers who 
otherwise might stay away. To do so, Marcikic calls on his imagination to 
motivate. 
</P>
<P>
"I wear a lot of weird clothes," said Marcikic, 39. "A lot of times our 
swimmers will show up just because they want to see what I'm wearing." 
</P>
<P>
Marcikic's odd outfits include bright shorts, mismatched shoes and funny hats. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD's program is the largest of 24 regional San Diego/Imperial Swim Masters 
clubs, all of which are governed by United States Masters Swimming. The La 
Jolla Jewish Community Center and Carlsbad Masters have 115 swimmers each, an 
Allied Gardens club called "Different Strokes" has 80 and Coronado has 50 
members. 
</P>
<P>
There are 1,300 masters swimmers in San Diego, making it the third largest 
region in the country and in California, the state with the most clubs and 
members. Northern California is first with 6,557 swimmers, and the Los 
Angeles/Orange County/Santa Barbara region is second with 2,356 members. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these swimmers are like Larry Hill, 50, a computer programmer for the 
San Diego Unified School District. He returned to swimming in Marcikic's 
program eight years ago after a layoff of 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Sickie provides a lot of variety," he said. "If I don't come, I feel like I'm 
missing out. I'm a better swimmer now than I was in high school and college." 
</P>
<P>
Camille Thompson, a member of the U.S. 1976 Olympic swim team in Montreal, has 
been with the program for two years. 
</P>
<P>
"The coaches are great," she said. "Sickie makes it fun. He does crazy things. 
There's always something going on to keep people interested." 
</P>
<P>
In a sport in which it becomes increasingly tiresome to stare at a painted line 
at the bottom of the pool, lap after lap, Marcikic dreams up wild workouts to 
arouse interest. 
</P>
<P>
"I make up strange sets for them," he said. "I'll make them swim on their 
backs, feet first, going backwards, all sorts of different things. You treat 
them like kids but are able to talk to them like adults. The bottom line here 
is fun." 
</P>
<P>
Marcikic also has staged some unconventional dry-land activities. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he staged such a bizarre golf tournament -- players were required to 
hit the ball with a baseball bat on one hole and with a pool cue on another -- 
that the group was told not to come back to the course. And this summer, the 
group will hold its first bowling tournament, at an unsuspecting alley to be 
named later. 
</P>
<P>
But to portray the program as a pool of games is unfair. 
</P>
<P>
Of the athletes enrolled in UCSD's program, Marcikic said approximately half 
are serious triathletes or swimmers in training. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely a well-organized workout," Marcikic said. "And it's not easy. 
When you're training as many as 80 to 100 people in the water in one workout, 
you don't want to hurt the people who are serious. But you don't want to burn 
out the ones who are there for fun either." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Marcikic hired Jeff Milton four years ago to work with more serious 
swimmers such as triathletes Scott Tinley, Mark Allen and Julie Moss and 
multiple masters world-record holders Barbara Dunbar and Betsy Jordan. Milton, 
33, also is swimming coach at University City High School. 
</P>
<P>
The less-serious participants swim to stay in shape, to feel good about 
themselves and to escape, for 1 1/2 hours a day, the grind of high-stress jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Milton said: "They love to be told what to do. They have to be told to get off 
the wall just like high school kids. And they have to do a 50 butterfly on 
their birthday no matter who they are." 
</P>
<P>
In a pool, a doctor and a doorman are indistinguishable. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a number of professors, doctors, lawyers, many well-respected people 
in the community," Marcikic said. "But once they're on deck, in their Speedos, 
you don't recognize them. They're just as crazy as anyone, and they're looking 
for the same results. That's the best part." 
</P>
<P>
Matthew Belshin, 29, is a former competitive swimmer turned retail developer 
for Trammell Crow Company. Belshin said he relies on swimming to keep his 
sanity, and he likes the absence of a hierarchy in the program. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know what a lot of the people do," he said. "In the pool, 
everyone's the same. This is a time to escape work. People don't talk about it 
much." 
</P>
<P>
County Superior Court Judge Tony Joseph, 52, has been swimming under Marcikic 
for two years. In a masters meet in La Jolla in April, he won the men's 50-54 
500-yard freestyle. He says swimming is a great way to escape the pressures of 
the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good to have something you do that is completely separate from law," 
Joseph said. "It's easier to stay awake all day if you start out doing this." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a great program," said Thompson, 34, a silver-medalist in the 
400-meter medley relay in Montreal. "It's a good melting pot here, and you get 
the hours you need." 
</P>
<P>
Canyon View Pool is open for UCSD's masters swimming at 6 a.m. Marcikic and 
Milton divide the pool for two different workouts from 6-7:30. UCSD is also 
open for workouts from 7:30-9 a.m., noon-1:30 p.m. and 6:30-8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
In masters swimming, the training is much less intense then when Thompson and 
Charlie Campbell, a first-year UCSD member and 1972 Olympian, were swimming 
four to six hours a day training for the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
After a 15-year break from the sport, Campbell -- a member of the 400 medley 
relay team that set a world record in 1971 -- has returned to swimming. 
</P>
<P>
"Swimming was a way of life for me," he said. "When you're a kid, you're a 
semi-pro. Now, this is a chance to get a good workout. We do less distance then 
when I was a kid. This is a program that's sophisticated and low-key. They give 
you whatever you can handle." 
</P>
<P>
Said Thompson: "It's not like the old days. You can get out when you want. I 
swim with Jeff, and he's a great motivator. He knows where to draw the line." 
</P>
<P>
Milton said family and job commitments force the shorter workouts. 
</P>
<P>
"We can make it just as tough, but not as long," he said. "They don't have the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Marcikic and Milton, who have both coached youngsters, enjoy the built-in 
discipline of the adults.

"It's easier to coach adults," Marcikic said. "We're not just coaches to them, 
we're friends. It's not a customer/client relationship. Swimming isn't their 
whole lives. I have to build that into their workout because they won't always 
be able to be here." 
</P>
<P>
According to USMS Executive Director Dorothy Donnelly, there are 24,000 
registered members swimming on 435 clubs across the country. There are more men 
than women registered nationally, but UCSD's male-female ratio is fairly even. 
</P>
<P>
Locally and nationally, for both men and women, the most popular age group is 
25-35. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, Masters swimmers competed in age groups that were divided into 
10-year increments, beginning at 25 and stopping at 65-plus. Now there are 
five-year increments. The youngest group is 19-24, the oldest 95-up. 
</P>
<P>
There are only two men competing in the highest age group. UCSD's Tom Lane is 
one of them. He holds nine national and four world records in the 90-94 
division, despite the fact he is blind. 
</P>
<P>
"He's pretty frail," Marcikic said. "He can only swim in warm water, but he 
does the best he can." Lane turned 95 on June 21. 
</P>
<P>
Swimmers actually look forward to the birthdays that will move them up an age 
group. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't wait to move up and get away from the youngsters," said Dunbar, 
president of San Diego/Imperial Swim Masters. 
</P>
<P>
Dunbar, 40, holds of 18 national and 12 world records in the 40-44 age group.

CIF RULES 'RECRUITED' ATHLETES NOT ELIGIBLE AT CHRISTIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN GEIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Christian High School has been placed on a one-year probation for recruiting 
violations involving several of the county's top basketball players. 
</P>
<P>
The probation handed down by Kendall Webb, CIF commissioner of the San Diego 
Section, does not affect the private school's ability to compete but only rules 
ineligible to play for Christian any student the school has "solicited directly 
or by contact of his parents," according to a press release from Webb's office. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling came after an investigation by Webb into complaints from coaches and 
parents concerning a May 15 dinner attended by Ed Giles, Christian High 
principal; Gary Jenkins, a school booster, and six top basketball prospects, 
notably Valhalla's Tony Clark, who led the section in scoring last year with a 
29.5-point average. 
</P>
<P>
Others in attendance were Monte Vista center Joe McNaull, Crawford guard Tracy 
Halton, Southwest center Adalberto Silva and University City forward-centers 
Ray Hooper and Greg Ballard. All will be seniors next season except Hooper and 
Ballard, who will be juniors. 
</P>
<P>
That the dinner took place was the basis of Webb's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I found that there was recruiting activity and attempts to influence students 
to attend Christian High," Webb said from Florida, where he is attending the 
National Federation Conference. "Considering that any student who was present 
or represented at the meeting would be ineligible if he transfered seems to be 
appropriate action at this time. It also places Christian High School on alert 
to evaluate the activity of people operating on their behalf." 
</P>
<P>
After the dinner and before Webb's ruling, only Clark had announced an 
intention to transfer to Christian. Clark could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Giles, who was exonerated by Webb, said he went to the meeting under the 
impression that several parents interested in having their children transfer to 
Christian made arrangements for the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
"I do PR for our private school," Giles said of the meeting. "I walked into it 
thinking the parents had made first contact." 
</P>
<P>
But Giles said he later learned that Jenkins, who serves on a committee that 
aids students coming to Christian, had been talking to the parents. 
</P>
<P>
Giles said Jenkins came into contact with the parents through Art Clark, Tony's 
father, who is the coach of the San Diego Slam-N-Jam basketball team that 
included the players invited to the dinner. Jenkins and Clark coach Little 
League baseball together.

HANG-DOG FEELING

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On weekends, the curious gather at the base of Kagel Mountain in Sylmar to 
watch the hang gliders soar and land. Newcomers are known to squint in 
disbelief as they notice that one of the gliders is occupied by a man and his 
dog. 
</P>
<P>
Five-year-old German shepherd Baubi has been flying since he was a year old 
with his owner, 55-year-old German immigrant Ludwig von der Luhe, who has been 
flying for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
"He always made such a funny commotion when I landed that I thought maybe he 
wanted to fly too," von der Luhe recalls. "So I had a special harness made for 
him and hung him up in a tree and wiggled him around some. He seemed to enjoy 
that and the next day I took him up in the hang glider." 
</P>
<P>
Off they went. The dog was a perfect passenger and took to hang gliding like a 
duck takes to water. "He looks at the scenery from the sky just as I do, and he 
enjoys it just as well," von der Luhe says. 
</P>
<P>
They fly every weekend and stay airborne for about two hours each flight. 
Although they have separate harnesses, Baubi spends most of his time hanging 
above his master in piggyback style. When von der Luhe packs up the glider to 
return home, Baubi makes a fuss. 
</P>
<P>
"He tries to push my hands away to keep me from packing up the glider. He 
always wants to fly more," von der Luhe says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In the Spotlight 
</P>
<P>
When actress Kim Basinger ("Batman") was featured in Vanity Fair's June issue, 
a small eatery in Tarzana reaped some unexpected benefits. Father Nature's Cafe 
on Ventura Boulevard was mentioned not only in the article's lead sentence, but 
also four more times in the story. 
</P>
<P>
"They did the interview for the article here," says owner Salpy Sossikian. "I 
knew we were going to be in the article because they called from New York to 
find out about our iced tea that Kim likes. But I didn't know we were going to 
be such a big hit." She adds, "We've seen 70% new faces." 
</P>
<P>
The iced tea "that Kim likes" is spiced with oranges and cinnamon. The menu 
includes Middle Eastern salads, chicken shawerma and tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Sossikian has received a few phone calls from the star's fans, including one 
from a man in Canada who wanted his number passed along to Basinger. (Sossikian 
passed it along but doesn't know if Kim ever called.) 
</P>
<P>
"She is such a beautiful lady," Sossikian says. 
</P>
<P>
We're sure that Bruce Wayne would agree. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Keep That Door Down 
</P>
<P>
You hear tales every day about houses being burglarized. What you don't often 
hear about are garage burglaries. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm positive there are people who have had stuff stolen out of their garages, 
and they don't even know about it," says Sgt. Gary Merrifield of the Los 
Angeles Police Department. "Maybe it's a hand tool or a power tool that they 
seldom use, but when they go to find it eventually, it's gone." 
</P>
<P>
The crime happens easily enough, Merrifield says. "People have a tendency to 
leave their garage door open during the day. Maybe they run to the store to 
pick up some milk, for example. It's easy for someone to just walk in and steal 
a lawn mower or a bike. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like people to inventory what they keep in their garage on a dollar 
value," he says, adding that most of us would be surprised at how much we have 
stored there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strike Out 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, after a particularly stressful day of developing game show ideas for 
Columbia Pictures Television, Alex Carswell shattered a picture frame on his 
desktop and felt satisfied. But the relief was only temporary. So two weeks 
later he left his job and joined with a partner to start a company called Novel 
Ideas, based in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
Their first product is finding its way into stores nationwide, including L.A. 
Wild Life in Studio City. Christened the Stressball, it makes a noise similar 
to breaking glass when you throw, drop or kick it. 
</P>
<P>
Retailing for $19.95, Stressball runs on a 9-volt battery and comes with a 
small pedestal and a comic target poster. "However, you may want to pin a 
picture of your boss on the wall," Carswell notes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Zonal Planting 
</P>
<P>
The heat is on, as your garden knows. One way to keep your water bill down, 
suggests landscape architect Richard Yanez of Edward Hume &amp; Associates in 
Northridge, is to establish "precipitation zones" in your yard. 
</P>
<P>
"You group together plants with similar water requirements," Yanez explains. 
</P>
<P>
For example, plants that have to be watered frequently -- azaleas, camellias, 
most annuals -- could be in one spot, while plants that need to be watered 
weekly -- day lilies, agapanthuses and statice -- could be in another section. 
That way you don't have to constantly water the whole yard. 
</P>
<P>
And maybe you won't have to be picked up off the floor when the water bill 
comes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overheard At . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Drivers in L.A. think it's a moral imperative to get one car ahead of you on 
the freeway." -- Customer overheard in Denny's restaurant in Sylmar.

PANEL TAKES HEAT AS CITY ARTS VOTE LOOMS CULTURAL LEADERS CRY FOUL ON FUNDING 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
On the eve of today's City Council vote to allocate about $5.6 million among 
about 75 cultural institutions, a number of arts leaders and artists are 
accusing the members of a City Council committee of censorship. 
</P>
<P>
The council members who make up the committee feel they have been unjustly 
accused and that they have instead been generous in approving all but one of 
the funding recommendations of the new Commission for Arts and Culture. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, members of the arts commission feel the council committee's vote 
undermined the arts-allocations process that the commission painstakingly 
designed to be fair to all cultural groups. 
</P>
<P>
Going into the meeting, commissioners are taking a wait-and-see attitude in 
hopes that the full council may alter some of the decisions made by the Public 
Services and Safety Committee on May 31. 
</P>
<P>
The most hotly contested issue is the committee's unanimous vote not to fund 
Installation, an avant-garde, experimental-art and performance gallery. Council 
members have said they were influenced by both Installation's financial 
condition and one of two billboards it commissioned artists to paint downtown 
in April. 
</P>
<P>
The billboard was an anti-racist slap at San Diego's unwillingness to name the 
new convention center for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Installation, 
which has a $140,000 budget, had incurred a $12,000 debt, since reduced to 
$6,000. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ron Roberts has drawn criticism in his personal belief that the city 
has no obligation to fund anyone putting art on billboards. Arthur Ollman, 
director of the Museum of Photographic Arts, said that there is room for 
artists to criticize the city and that billboards are perhaps less offensive 
when given to artists. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like billboards per se, but if they exist, I much prefer artists using 
them," Ollman said. "San Diego is a big city with broad shoulders and can 
handle internal criticism with a sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of supporting institutions or supporting the people who run them, the 
City Council seems to be getting involved in the way the art is presented, and 
that's a terribly troubling prospect," said Hugh Davies, director of the La 
Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art. "I am not qualified to make specific 
decisions about how they (council members) operate their affairs. And they are 
not qualified to make curatorial decisions." 
</P>
<P>
The feeling of council censorship has pervaded the arts community. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very strongly that the council should reconsider what they are doing," 
said artist Anna O'Cain. "They're focusing on what they don't like. (Another 
artist) and I put on a children's parade sponsored by Installation during 
Artwalk. Installation pulled 400 parents and their kids to that parade." 
</P>
<P>
The council members have been angered at the charges of censorship. 
</P>
<P>
"It infuriates me to imply censorship," said member Judy McCarty, who is on the 
Public Services and Safety Committee. "It's not my motivation." 
</P>
<P>
Arts commission chairman Mickey Fredman "came in angry and got a response in 
kind," McCarty said. "It was unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most serious issue to arts commissioners is the council committee's 
vote to fund half a dozen organizations that the commission, for a variety of 
reasons, did not fund. The practical effect of that, said arts commissioner Ann 
MacCullough, was to undermine the funding process the commission had designed 
to be fair to all groups. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that some of the council members are arts supporters," said 
MacCullough, who was nominated by McCarty. "But it's frustrating to me 
personally. I really feel the process has taken a beating. I'm just waiting to 
see what happens Thursday." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Corcoran, executive director of the San Diego Area Dance Alliance, praised 
99.9% of what the City Council has done to date regarding arts funding. But he 
took issue with the council committee for approving funding for six 
organizations that are not recommended by the arts commission. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens is whoever can twist arms the strongest and scream the loudest 
gets the money," Corcoran said. "That's not arts funding, that's politics. We 
wouldn't want to build our educational system on it, and we wouldn't want to 
build art on it, either."

HOW TROUPES, AND ART GROUPS SURVIVE DEBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last week, The Times took a look at arts institutions and how they have managed 
to get out of debt. Today, we take a look at others that remain in debt, and 
how they manage to survive. The first season at the new Hahn Cosmopolitan 
Theatre went almost exactly as planned. 
</P>
<P>
With plays such as Somerset Maugham's "The Circle," Shelagh Delaney's "A Taste 
of Honey" and Larry Shue's "The Foreigner," the Hahn's parent Gaslamp Quarter 
Theatre was able to hold the line on expenses and meet its revenue projections. 
</P>
<P>
That was 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Then came Season II -- and boom! A second-year slump and a shocking $110,000 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, debt in the 1980s is as much a part of San Diego's performing 
arts community as are high-quality productions. 
</P>
<P>
The Gaslamp Quarter Theatre is dealing with a $165,000 obligation. San Diego 
Performances, which brings top-rated dance troupes to town, has in two years 
run up a debt of about $400,000. The critically hailed La Jolla Playhouse faces 
a hefty $703,000 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
For the Gaslamp, the challenge is to find a way to become "properly 
capitalized," according to managing producer Kit Goldman, "because we're going 
to have years when plays are not popular, years when the stock market is down 
and you don't have the donations you predicted." 
</P>
<P>
The Gaslamp, which was formed in 1980, incurred its debt after opening a second 
theater in 1987. Goldman explained how the debt occured after the Hahn's 
opening: 
</P>
<P>
"The first year, everybody (in the public) is curious. There's momentum and 
money designated for the opening year. The second year is traditionally a tough 
one if you don't have a cushion (that allows you) to go into debt." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't like debt," Goldman said. "The goal is to stay out of debt. We are 
learning to think bigger in what we're looking for donation-wise. When we're 
putting out a lot of energy, it's got to create a lot of zeros on the end." 
</P>
<P>
Goldman also said that the theater is "annualizing" fund-raising events to 
"create income streams annually rather than on a one-time basis." 
</P>
<P>
To eliminate its red ink, the Gaslamp will take "an extremely aggressive 
stance" in marketing to the waterfront visitor trade, she said, adding that the 
theater will be the chief beneficiary of the first black-tie gala at the new 
convention center. 
</P>
<P>
The most rewarding deal may be the planned sale of the entire block on which 
the Hahn sits. Because of a clause in the Gaslamp's lease for the Hahn, the 
Gaslamp stands to receive "a substantial lump sum" upon either the sale or 
refinancing of the property, said Goldman, whose theater pays $10,000 a month 
in rent. 
</P>
<P>
Other major expenses for theaters in general include wages, cost of sets and 
costumes, music, advertising and rights. 
</P>
<P>
Key sources of funding are tickets, fund-raisers, benefactors, grants, loans 
and, for some of the bigger concerns, endowments. 
</P>
<P>
In the Gaslamp's case -- although a number of factors, including the two-year 
delayed opening of the new convention center, contributed to the deficit -- the 
real problem is undercapitalization, Goldman said. In developing cash reserves, 
the Gaslamp is aided "tremendously by a supportive, understanding board of 
directors and staff, and a banker with a heart," she said. "The president of 
our board is a risk entrepreneur. He understands growth." 
</P>
<P>
To finance its deficit, the theater has a $250,000 line of credit with the Bank 
of San Diego, which Goldman says has "been like a rock." 
</P>
<P>
The bank provided the Gaslamp a line of credit for several reasons, said Paul 
Coy, a vice president and loan officer with the bank. 
</P>
<P>
Not the least of those reasons is the federal Reinvestment Act that requires 
banks to report annually "lending activities for worthwhile activities -- what 
does it do to reinvest in the community itself," Coy said. 
</P>
<P>
While making a "prudent banking decision and exercising due diligence," the 
bank, in making its decision, also took a look at the organization and its 
board of directors, Coy said. 
</P>
<P>
"We look at who is involved in the particular organization. The Gaslamp, for 
example, is kind of a 'Who's Who' in the city. It never hurts to show support 
that way. It enhances the bank's image in those people's eyes and, frankly, we 
experience some spinoff business from that." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, working with a theater and the creative types who produce theater "is 
fun, if that's not being too light about it," Coy said. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Gaslamp Quarter Theatre, the La Jolla Playhouse depends in part on a 
bank line of credit while dealing with its accumulated deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"We have $300,000 of our deficit covered by a line of credit and another 
$100,000 financed," said playhouse managing director Alan Levey. "I think the 
banks in this community recognize that institutions are assets, not burdens." 
</P>
<P>
Despite staging popular musicals such as "Big River" and "80 Days," the 
playhouse has incurred a deficit each year since it reopened in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"Our chronic illness is we have a limited schedule with limited seats," Levey 
said. "We have the shortest season (six months) of any (League of Resident 
Theatres) theater in the country." The playhouse's season is restricted to six 
months because it shares its two theaters with the UC San Diego drama 
department. 
</P>
<P>
The playhouse and UCSD are building two new theaters, which, when completed, 
will allow the playhouse to extend its season and expand its seating. But the 
second of the two will not be built before 1992, Levey said. 
</P>
<P>
The theater is seeking to increase income and reduce costs without affecting 
the quality of its productions. For the last play of this season the theater 
will produce "Macbeth," a relatively small-cast Shakespeare play. Seven UCSD 
graduate acting students and several design students will be involved in the 
production. 
</P>
<P>
A key to the playhouse's long-range financial recovery is a multi-year, 
National Endowment for the Arts challenge grant of $250,000, awarded earlier 
this year to stabilize its finances. To receive the $250,000, the theater must 
match it with $750,000 over three years. 
</P>
<P>
In the world of cultural arts, only museums are relatively debt-free, says 
Edward Able, executive director of the American Assn. of Museums. The 
difference, he suggested, is the uncertainty in the performing arts, production 
expenses and audiences that vary from show to show. 
</P>
<P>
"Their primary income source is ticket sales," Able said. "We have, for years, 
depended on other sources because our ticket admissions do not begin to cover 
our operations budget." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Performances, a 2-year-old dance presenter, watched its deficit grow 
to about $400,000 from $100,000 during the current season, in which it 
presented more than twice as many performances as last year. 
</P>
<P>
Besides a bank line of credit of about $100,000, San Diego Performances depends 
heavily on the good will of its creditors, said its executive director, Suzanne 
Townsend. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a tough year for fund raising," Townsend said. "We felt it was 
important to the artists and to the community to complete the season. I don't 
believe in canceling shows. We would still owe money to the artists." 
</P>
<P>
The city's arts commission declined to recommend San Diego Performances for a 
grant because it had a relatively large deficit for such a new organization. 
But Townsend figures she will eliminate the debt in about three years. 
</P>
<P>
She plans to cut next season's budget to about $1.5 million from $2.4 million 
this year and to restructure and curtail the number of performances from 40 to 
25. She is also attempting to spread the debt among a consortium of banks, much 
as the San Diego Symphony has done. Townsend also plans a special gala 
fund-raiser for the fall, with performances by artists from major dance 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Though debts cannot be merely "willed" away, attitude, including a will to 
survive, is essential in overcoming them, said Townsend, Goldman and Thomas 
Hall, managing director of the Old Globe Theatre. Once an institution has 
successfully dealt with debt, deficits are no longer quite the bugaboos they 
were. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the Globe still carries a $400,000 construction debt from a 
second fire that burned down the Festival Stage in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a $400,000 deficit on assets of $8.5 million and an operating budget 
of $7 million," Hall said, "as opposed to having a $750,000 debt and assets of 
less than half that (eight years ago). We are very solvent and stable."

PAIR OF JAZZ PLAYERS WILL RECALL CHET BAKER, LEGEND AND FRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trumpeter and singer Chet Baker, who died last May in a mysterious fall from an 
Amsterdam hotel window, was a tragic hero of mythic proportions, a James Dean 
of jazz who inspired those around him in profound ways. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego saxophonist Gary Lefebvre and Van Nuys bass player Hersh Hamel are 
just two of the many musicians whose lives and careers were touched by Baker, a 
heroin addict never able to kick his obsession. 
</P>
<P>
Both of those old friends will reminisce Sunday night at the Ken Cinema, where 
"Let's Get Lost," film maker Bruce Weber's sometimes brutal documentary on 
Baker, has its San Diego premiere. 
</P>
<P>
Weber followed the trumpeter during what turned out to be the last year of his 
life, and mixed the new material with rare concert footage, interviews with 
those who knew Baker (including Hamel) and recordings of Baker's music. 
</P>
<P>
The premiere is a benefit for KSDS-FM (88.3), the San Diego jazz radio station 
that is hosting the Ken showing. 
</P>
<P>
Along with players such as baritone saxophonist Gerry Mulligan and trumpeter 
Miles Davis in the early 1950s, Baker forged the sound that came to be known as 
"Cool Jazz," a laid-back, melodic counterpoint to the frenzied, 
</P>
<P>
gritty sound of bebop. 
</P>
<P>
Hamel was 19, barely out of high school, when he met Baker at a tiny club in 
Hermosa Beach in 1949, four years before Baker cut his first records as a 
leader and soon became an international jazz name. Baker wasn't into hard drugs 
yet -- he didn't try heroin until the mid-'50s -- and Hamel spent three years 
close to him, playing clubs, practicing, sometimes just hanging out. 
</P>
<P>
Lefebvre was in his early 20s, searching for a musical direction, when he 
encountered a much-changed Baker around Christmas, 1965, a "waning star" 
already well into his addiction. Even so, Baker's music was still powerful, 
strong enough to leave a lasting impression on Lefebvre. 
</P>
<P>
"When I met him, he'd just come back from Europe. I was working with Mel Torme 
at the Crescendo in Los Angeles. Chet came in to hear Mel and liked the way he 
sang. Their voices have a similar kind of mellow quality. Chet's lead trumpet 
player, Al Porcino, introduced me, but I already knew who he was. 
</P>
<P>
"I found out he was living in Manhattan Beach close by where I was living in 
Redondo. We swapped phone numbers and started practicing at his place. He 
connected melodic lines with such logic that he didn't leave any room for 
questions as to whether or not his playing was good." 
</P>
<P>
Baker and Lefebvre's quartet had regular gigs at Shelly's Mannehole in Los 
Angeles, and Lefebvre thinks they had a special chemistry. But Dick Bock, 
Baker's producer for the Pacific Jazz label, didn't feel the group had enough 
commercial potential. 
</P>
<P>
"He was trying to promote Chet with Bud Shank, who had more of a name draw," 
Lefebvre said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Hamel and Lefebvre remember Baker as a strong, silent type. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't talk a lot, but when he did, he said things that had to be said. He 
was short on words, long on knowledge," Lefebvre said. And Baker was a stickler 
for the smallest details. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember one job I worked with him at the Inter-Continental Hotel in Los 
Angeles," Lefebvre said. "He wanted us to wear these little black string ties, 
all of us in an eight-piece band, dressed alike. When I walked in, he was clear 
across the room and he waved me over and reached down and adjusted my tie. I 
asked what he wanted, and he said, 'That's all.' He was a perfectionist." 
</P>
<P>
That gig was to be a trial run in front of three businessmen who were 
considering backing Baker in a mariachi band, which they thought had commercial 
potential. But Baker had other ideas. 
</P>
<P>
"We were supposed to play music that would show them what could be done, but 
Chet ignored that all night. We had arrangements for the eight-piece band, but 
Chet just went into Sonny Rollins' 'Pent Up House' and expected me to come in. 
That was his way of telling them he wasn't gonna be doing that junk. He was a 
rebel in a lot of ways." 
</P>
<P>
By 1968, Baker left for New York. He hadn't recorded an album in more than 
three years. Lefebvre went to play in Las Vegas, ever thankful for their time 
together. 
</P>
<P>
"I was able to lock everything in melodically that I couldn't lock in before. 
Being able to play with someone that inspired brought me to my full potential." 
Unfortunately, their playing together never made it to vinyl. 
</P>
<P>
Bassist Hamel first heard Baker at a Sunday jam in 1949 in Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"He was playing his silver trumpet and French horn, too, which is very unusual. 
You could hear the music and I looked in," Hamel said. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked his playing. I introduced myself and sat in on the session. We started 
talking, and I asked him if he wanted to play, he said, 'Sure,' and we arranged 
to get together. He told me about another session at Esther's, on the outskirts 
of Hermosa Beach. I brought Art Pepper there, and Jack Montrose -- we were all 
sort of a little clique. 
</P>
<P>
After a year, Baker and Hamel's band hadn't been able to get enough gigs to 
support them, and Baker and drummer Bob Neel enlisted to play in an Army band 
in San Francisco, against the advice of their buddy Hamel. Baker was discharged 
a few months later after going AWOL several times and faking a "psych-out." 
Hamel lost track of him until he returned to Los Angeles about 1952 and began 
to make it, playing with Charlie Parker, eventually recording with Gerry 
Mulligan in one of his now-famous pianoless quartets. 
</P>
<P>
Hamel said the piano was dropped more by circumstances than musical 
inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan was appearing at The Haig on Wilshire Boulevard and didn't object when 
the owner moved out a grand piano to add more tables. With Baker and without 
piano, Mulligan's group got rave reviews, and their regular gigs at the small 
club were soon frequented by Marilyn Monroe, Jane Russell and other Hollywood 
types. Before long, Mulligan went to jail for marijuana possession, and Baker 
formed his own band. By the time Mulligan got out a few months later, Baker was 
a star in his own right. 
</P>
<P>
"He offered Chet a job as a sideman, but Chet turned him down. Gerry was 
dragged with it." 
</P>
<P>
Hamel went on to play with Art Pepper and others, but he can still hear Baker. 
</P>
<P>
"What stood out to me was Chet played so beautifully in the low register. He 
had a big, wide mouthpiece that gave him a mellow, flat sound. He wasn't 
interested in playing be-bop riffs or cliches, going along with the trend. He 
was more interested in playing standards and pretty tunes, yet playing them in 
a jazz way, improvising, not emulating other people, reaching down within 
himself for his own inner strength, his own musical self." 
</P>
<P>
These days, Hamel keeps Baker's music alive a few times a month with his Chet 
Baker Tribute Band around Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
He's a fan of "Let's Get Lost," having seen it three times, but he has his 
criticisms. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think there was quite enough music. It has very unflattering 
photography of Chet in the latter stages of his life. There's one scene where 
Chet's in a hotel room, and a light from across the street comes in the room 
every now and then and goes right across Chet's face. It makes him look like 
Methuselah or something. 
</P>
<P>
"Bruce has a way of capturing him in his most terrible moments. He could just 
as well have photographed him in a more flattering way, but maybe that isn't 
what he was after." 
</P>
<P>
"Let's Get Lost" plays through July 8.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO; 
</P>
<P>
WITH ITS POWER, TAKE 6 HAS FANS HEARING VOICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Saxophonist Gerry Mulligan's pianoless quartets of the 1950s were considered 
progressive. How could you sustain the music without a complete rhythm section? 
Players like Bud Shank (flute and sax) deleted drums, placing the rhythmic 
burden even more on the shoulders of musicians traditionally taxed with melodic 
and harmonic responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
So it's not hard to imagine the bravado of going it with no rhythm section at 
all -- in fact, without instruments. A cappella groups such as Take 6, which 
plays the Open Air Theatre at San Diego State University on Monday, are the 
equivalent of the tightrope walker working without a net. One slip and it all 
comes tumbling down. 
</P>
<P>
That's not likely to happen Monday. The six members of the group are 
spiritually inclined, Gospel-oriented young men, four of whom put the band 
together in 1980 after meeting at a small Southern Christian college. They have 
enough vocal power and skill to create a full orchestra. Or, as one writer put 
it, they're something like a six-headed Bobby McFerrin. 
</P>
<P>
They call their music "contemporary Christian pop jazz." On a song like "Milky 
White Way," from their first and only album, soaring voices carry the 
inspirational melody, spinning it out like lines from alto and soprano saxes, 
high over the baritone and tenors that keep the pace and anchor the bottom like 
bass and drums. 
</P>
<P>
A cappella jazz has a history of enthusiastic acceptance among listeners. Maybe 
this has to do with the inevitable human quality of the sound, with no 
instruments or electronics between raw inspiration and execution. Probably, 
it's also because the music selected by Take 6 and its predecessors, among them 
the Mills Brothers, Manhattan Transfer and Lambert Hendricks and Ross, tends to 
be uplifting, whether or not it is spiritually oriented. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Take 6, all Seventh-day Adventists, they see themselves as 
"ministers of music," carrying a religious message beyond the walls of the 
church. 
</P>
<P>
All still in their 20s, the members are enjoying phenomenal success with their 
year-old album. It's about to go gold (500,000 copies). Their 8 p.m. San Diego 
show is a stop on their two-month tour with fellow vocalist Al Jarreau, who 
shares the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Jarreau's efforts in the '70s and early '80s were often be-bop-inspired, his 
smooth scat runs winning him critical approval and a Grammy in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Although his newest album, the 1988 "Heart's Horizon," includes the Take 6-ish 
"Yo' Jeans," an a cappella duet with Bobby McFerrin, the material generally 
tends away from jazz toward pop and rhythm and blues, with light melodies and 
danceable rhythms. Jarreau, too, is enjoying sales success. "Heart's Horizon" 
has sold more than 400,000, and Reprise, his record company, is starting to see 
gold. 
</P>
<P>
The fight for consumers among San Diego's many malls has proven a boon to local 
jazz musicians, who are being used as a lure for shoppers. Three years ago, 
Fashion Valley was one of the first to book regular jazz performances when they 
featured local acts every Sunday. With several other malls now in the fray, 
Fashion Valley marketing director Marilee Bankert decided to one-up the 
competition this year, bringing in national light acts such as Free Flight, 
David Arkenstone, Grant Geissman and, coming July 9, Kim Pensyl. Bankert says 
the performances, co-promoted with KIFM (98.1), are logical because the station 
and the shopping center are after the same target: 25- to 49-year-old "upscale" 
consumers. The name acts help draw shoppers from all over the county, not just 
nearby communities, Bankert said. Malls booking local jazz include Chula Vista 
Shopping Center (Fridays from noon to 2 p.m.), Horton Plaza (occasional jazz, 
Mondays through Fridays, noon to 2 p.m.) and University Towne Centre 
(Wednesdays, lunchtime). 
</P>
<P>
Malls aren't the only place to catch outdoor jazz for free. John Lawrence and 
his San Diego Jazz Society are presenting a series of six summer concerts in 
two Carlsbad parks, funded by the Carlsbad Arts Council. The next one is at 
5:30 p.m. Friday at Stagecoach Park off Mission Estancia in La Costa, featuring 
San Diego vocalist Coral Thuet in front of a band including excellent local 
pianist Randy Porter. The July 7 evening show, also at Stagecoach Park, 
showcases the work of Joy of Sax, led by John Rekevics -- serious jazz leavened 
with saxual puns. 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: Hollis Gentry's Acoustic Quartet appears tonight through Saturday at 
Diego's Loft in Pacific Beach. The group usually concentrates on standards, but 
saxophonist Gentry said he may break out a few of his own mainstream originals 
for the first time. . . . Members of Acoustic Alchemy, the British jazz guitar 
group in town for a performance last week, checked out Gentry's fusion group 
Neon at the Catamaran last Wednesday. L. A. tenor sax man Kirk Whalen took the 
stage for an impromptu jam with Gentry. . . . San Diego flutist Lori Bell plays 
the Hilton's Sunday brunch this Sunday from 11 to 2. She'll concentrate on 
Brazilian music. . . . Dorothy Griska, the new owner of Words &amp; Music Book 
Gallery in Hillcrest, says she plans to continue the store's series of 
occasional jazz concerts. Next up is vocalist Cath Eckert on July 9. . . . 
Drummer Tony Williams' June 19 show at the City College Theater was a success, 
with 220 of 250 tickets sold. Co-presenters KSDS-FM (88.3) and the San Diego 
Jazz Festival are looking to do more jazz together soon.

MAYOR WISHES HE'D SAID, 'FORGET IT, JAKE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura Mayor Jim Monahan says it may be a long time before the city ever again 
lets a film company take over City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Monahan voiced his disillusionment with the ways of Hollywood this week after a 
production company filming "The Two Jakes," Jack Nicholson's sequel to 
"Chinatown," finally pulled up stakes. 
</P>
<P>
For two weeks, during debate over Ventura's critical growth plan for the next 
two decades, Monahan and other City Council members became virtual political 
nomads. 
</P>
<P>
Abandoning the City Council chambers to Nicholson's film crew for a court 
scene, the council met first in makeshift surroundings at Buena High School, 
then in some borrowed county conference space. 
</P>
<P>
When the filming ended, Monahan said, the city had a lot of dirty City Hall 
carpets to worry about and a complaint from movie producer Harold Schneider of 
Ojai that the city had overcharged him for use of its facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing was too disruptive of business at City Hall," Monahan said. 
"More than I anticipated. My experience is that we should think long and hard 
before we do something like this again." 
</P>
<P>
Adding insult to the entire experience, according to Monahan, was his treatment 
when he tried to present Nicholson with a key to the city of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
While Monahan eventually delivered the key to Nicholson via a secretary, the 
mayor said Schneider initially told him, "We don't accept that kind of crap."

MAN CLAIMING TO BE DEPUTY CONFRONTS SCHULTE ON TV SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When gay West Hollywood City Councilman Steve Schulte agreed to appear on a 
talk show this week presented by the Rev. Pat Robertson's Christian 
Broadcasting Network, he didn't expect it to be fun and games. 
</P>
<P>
And it wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
First, he was accused by a teen-ager in the audience of having a mental 
disorder because he is gay. Then, a young mother railed against what she said 
was the evil of homosexual relationships. A rival guest on the program chided 
Schulte and another gay guest for living immoral lives. 
</P>
<P>
The program, Scott Ross Straight Talk, was taped last week at Venice Beach. It 
was shown Tuesday on the CBN Family Channel, available to about 45 million 
cable television subscribers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Among the First 
</P>
<P>
Schulte, who has appeared on similar programs in the past, went on the show to 
talk about West Hollywood's domestic-partnership law, which provides gay 
couples and other unmarried partners with certain legally recognized benefits. 
</P>
<P>
West Hollywood is among a small number of cities -- including San Francisco, 
Berkeley and Madison, Wis. -- that have such laws. The ordinances were 
described by host Scott Ross as "striking at the very foundation of the family 
structure as we know it." 
</P>
<P>
The councilman took most of the criticism in stride. 
</P>
<P>
"You come to expect it, but I always view these kinds of programs as the chance 
to reach an audience that would otherwise be unattainable," said Schulte, who 
has appeared on the Sally Jessy Raphael Show and twice was a guest of Orange 
County TV host Wally George. 
</P>
<P>
However, even Schulte admitted to being taken aback by a man in the audience 
who claimed to be a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy assigned to West 
Hollywood. The man expressed displeasure at having to deal with gays as part of 
his law enforcement duties, calling the gay life style "disgusting." 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 35% of West Hollywood's 37,000 residents are gay, and gay 
activists have long accused the Sheriff's Department of insensitivity toward 
gays. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a deputy sheriff in the city of West Hollywood and I deal strictly on a 
lot of my runs with homosexuals, and I can't understand why so many people want 
to go to that kind of life style," the man said. "I think homosexuality is 
disgusting." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'You Have the Right' 
</P>
<P>
Responded Schulte: "You have the right to be disgusted by whatever you want to 
be disgusted by. I hope you're raising your kids in a decent manner. I also 
hope you're telling them that not everybody is like you . . . and that it's OK 
to be different, whether gay or straight." 
</P>
<P>
Although the man did not give his name on the program, Mark Vandervelden, an 
aide to Schulte who attended the taping, said he overheard the man introduce 
himself as Rene Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
That piece of news, relayed to the Sheriff's Department by Vandervelden at 
Schulte's request, quickly sent sheriff's officials scurrying to find out who, 
if anyone, from their ranks would be so bold as to insult a city councilman on 
national television. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have anyone here by that name," said Capt. Rachel Burgess, who heads 
the West Hollywood Sheriff's Station. "As a matter of fact, I've checked with 
personnel, and they show no one with that name associated with the department, 
period." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, she and other officers at the West Hollywood station viewed the 
broadcast and concluded that the man was an imposter. 
</P>
<P>
"No one here has ever seen the guy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Schulte, who characterized the man's views as "repugnant," said he never 
believed that the man was really a sheriff's deputy. 
</P>
<P>
"I was taken aback when he said who he was," Schulte said. "My first reaction 
was not to believe him. I didn't think anyone from there (the Sheriff's 
Department) would be that undisciplined or that out-of-line on national TV. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of got the feeling that some of the people in the audience were planted 
by someone." 
</P>
<P>
The program was taped outdoors near the Venice Boardwalk before an audience of 
about 75 people. Audience members who participated in the broadcast included 
gay-rights activists and people opposed to the gay life style. 
</P>
<P>
Schulte's chief antagonist on the program was Lou Sheldon, an Orange County 
minister and founder of the Traditional Values Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
He dismissed domestic-partnership laws as "undermining the moral fabric of 
society," and said that sanctioning living arrangements between unmarried 
couples threatens to "wipe out those things that have made this country great." 
</P>
<P>
In February, West Hollywood began offering medical insurance coverage to 
unmarried partners of city employees, including gays and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, West Hollywood's domestic-partnership law -- among the first measures 
championed by the gay community after the city was incorporated in 1984 -- 
remains largely symbolic. 
</P>
<P>
It provides domestic partners with jail and hospital visitation rights similar 
to those of spouses. But the city does not have a major hospital, and the only 
jail is a Sheriff's Department lock-up facility where visitors are not allowed.

SANTA MONICA INCREASES HOTEL BED TAX TO 12% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The Santa Monica City Council, capitalizing on a boom in hotel construction, 
has given preliminary approval to a two-percentage-point increase in the city's 
hotel occupancy tax over local industry objections that the council rushed the 
motion forward with little public discussion. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 6 to 1 Tuesday night for the increase, which takes effect 
Oct. 1 and is expected to bring an additional $897,000 a year to the city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dissenting Vote 
</P>
<P>
The dissenting vote came from Councilman Herb Katz, who said raising the tax 
runs counter to city goals. "We are allowing these hotels to be built, we are 
encouraging tourists to come . . . and then we tax the hell out of them," Katz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Mayor Dennis Zane said the additional income is what justifies approving 
new hotel construction. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, which raises the tax imposed on nightly room rentals from 10% to 
12%, also prompted City Manager John Jalili and officials with the Convention 
and Visitors Bureau to trade barbs over who was to blame for hoteliers' 
dissatisfaction. But all sides agreed that the dispute involved the way the 
increase was approved and they discounted the long-range impact on business. 
</P>
<P>
The increase coincides with a boom in hotel construction in Santa Monica and a 
corresponding rise in money generated by the hotel tax. Since 1981, city income 
has doubled while hotel bed tax revenue has almost quadrupled to a projected 
$4.5 million this year, said Bob Gabriel, chairman of the Santa Monica 
Convention and Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the recent opening of Loew's Santa Monica Beach Hotel and the 
soon-to-be-completed Park Hyatt and Guest Quarters hotels increase the number 
of first-class rooms in the city by 80%. The three hotels total 1,800 rooms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hotel Competition 
</P>
<P>
Visitors bureau and hotel officials say the higher tax is ill-timed because tax 
revenue is already up and the spate of construction may lead to a glut of hotel 
rooms. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many in our industry asking the question, 'Why?' " said Loew's 
Managing Director Lloyd Kirsch. 
</P>
<P>
City officials and their consultant have said since the measure was proposed in 
May that an increase would not adversely affect hotel competition with 
neighboring cities. The transient occupancy tax, as the bed tax is officially 
called, is 12% in Los Angeles and Culver City, 11% in Beverly Hills, and 10% in 
West Hollywood and Marina del Rey, which is part of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Although local hotel owners expressed mixed views on how the increase would 
affect business, they were all rankled at the short notice. On May 23, city 
officials requested implementation of the tax by July 1. After objections, that 
schedule was pushed back for discussion in June and implementation in October. 
But in a May 30 meeting, the council voted 5 to 1 to request that an ordinance 
be drafted. Gabriel said that order made the increase a fait accompli. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, visitors bureau Executive Director Beverly Moore complained that 
bookings are made up to a year in advance and that hoteliers would have to pay 
the difference in tax rates to honor contracts. Gabriel said the city 
arbitrarily increased the hotel tax because of budget considerations, violating 
precedent set in 1981, when city and businesses worked together to raise the 
tax to improve city tourism efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"The feeling was (that) they already made their decision," said Marie Tallman, 
general manager of Holiday Inn at the Pier. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel owners were also concerned that the new money will not be used for 
significant tourist-related measures, such as renovating the city's aging Civic 
Center or improving beaches or parks. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say the tax will go into the city's general fund, with some of 
it intended for improving and expanding police service.

FILLMORE'S BENEFIT BANG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHANNA GOWENLOCK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the Fourth of July in your neighborhood sounds like the shelling of Da Nang, 
you might look to the otherwise quiet town of Fillmore -- and its churches, 
charities and civic organizations -- for an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to picnics and patriotism, the Fourth in Fillmore means fireworks 
sales. And fireworks sales mean a reliable source of cash for perennially 
strapped nonprofit groups, which must vie with each other year-round for the 
limited funds available in a town of 11,400. 
</P>
<P>
For 17 years, Fillmore has bucked the anti-fireworks trend in California, 
opening its streets to droves of residents from Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa 
Barbara counties -- anyone on the lookout for such non-explosive delights as 
sparklers, whistlers and spinners. Firecrackers and skyrockets are banned. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-eight of the 85 cities in Los Angeles County allow fireworks sales; 
among jurisdictions banning their sale are the city and county of Los Angeles. 
In Santa Barbara County, only Santa Maria permits them. And Fillmore is the 
only one of Ventura County's 10 cities to allow them. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the misgivings of some local fire officials, who would prefer to see no 
sales, many fireworks vendors in Fillmore say their organizations would be in 
dire straits without them. Thanks to a city ordinance passed in 1972, they are 
able to turn the town into a star-spangled enclave of red, white and blue -- as 
well as fluorescent orange and chartreuse -- fireworks stands the week before 
each Fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"You can only have so many carwashes," said Dale Crockett, a member of the 
Fillmore Chamber of Commerce's board of directors. Crockett hopes to help the 
chamber take in $10,000 to $12,000 this week, with the money going toward the 
organization's rent and building upkeep, publishing tourist information and 
paying the salary of its one employee. 
</P>
<P>
Other organizations hope to bolster their coffers for such causes as feeding 
the hungry and homeless, donating eyeglasses to the poor, outfitting the town's 
Little League teams, providing college scholarships and maintaining local 
churches. 
</P>
<P>
In what is mainly a good-natured cooperative effort, they hawk the wares of 
Pyrodyne American Corp. -- Freedom Fireworks and Magic Dragon Fireworks -- from 
18 plywood huts along California 126. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Metzler, who spends much of her time at the Fillmore United Way Volunteer 
Services stand, can't afford to lose sleep worrying about the competition. 
After all, her husband, Michael, the Sunrisers Rotary Club treasurer, is making 
his fireworks pitch less than a mile down the road. Both will moonlight in the 
booth run by their church, St. Francis of Assisi. And as Fillmore Chamber of 
Commerce members, it just wouldn't be neighborly not to pop in for a stint or 
two there, too. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Plenty to Go Around' 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, we're not out to outsell each other or get all the customers," said 
Metzler, whose organization uses much of its fireworks income (it's hoping for 
$30,000 this year) to help feed the hungry and homeless. "There's plenty to go 
around." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, during the town's eight-day boom, it's not unheard-of for people who 
have sold all their stock to hop across the road and ask neighboring vendors 
for some spare fireworks to tide them over until the next shipment arrives, 
said Fillmore resident Mike Brown, who helps run the Foursquare Church's stand. 
</P>
<P>
But one aggressive vendor is all business, to the dismay of other groups. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Nichols, pastor of Beth-El Baptist Church, has taken out advertisements in 
area newspapers offering free fireworks and discount prices, and he has 20 
people at a time manning his 64-foot stand, the biggest in town. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people in town are grumbling that I'm trying to undercut their sales, but 
that's not true," he said. "The more people we can draw in, the more their 
businesses will do, too." 
</P>
<P>
Nichols has gone a step beyond the usual fireworks-stand security guard: He has 
equipped the stand with an interior and exterior infra-red alarm system. And 
few would-be burglars would be inclined to grapple with burly, 
camouflaged-clothed security guard Pete Dempsey. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Good Cause' 
</P>
<P>
"We are selling fireworks for a good cause, but we have to be realistic, too. 
And that means we have to advertise and we have to take steps to really protect 
our stands from people who want to steal our stuff," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Security is just one problem stemming from the sales. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Askren, chief of Fillmore's volunteer Fire Department, complains that many 
who buy fireworks don't stay and use them within the city limits, as the law 
requires. Askren has asked the city to curtail the sale of fireworks, taking a 
stance he acknowledges as unpopular in a town full of struggling charity 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to see kids get hurt with fireworks, and I don't really feel a lot of 
the parents are smart enough to watch their children," said Askren, who has 
seen children seriously burned because they stepped on still-smoldering 
fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
"But people in California think it's their God-given right to set off 
fireworks, and if we don't give them the safe-and-sane stuff, they'll go out 
and get the big stuff. Then we could have some real problems," he said.

DRUG SMUGGLERS FOCUSING ON AREA, U.S. CUSTOMS SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
AGENCY TO FORM REGIONAL TASK FORCE TO MONITOR BEACHES, LANDING STRIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Convinced that international smugglers increasingly are moving drugs through 
Ventura County harbors and airports, the U.S. Customs Service disclosed this 
week that it is forming a regional task force to combat the growing problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We have evidence of large loads of dope coming in by boat and by plane," said 
Fernando Ramos, resident agent in charge of the Customs Service investigative 
unit in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
"Indications are they are trying to get around San Diego and Los Angeles," 
Ramos said. "We have hard intelligence that they are moving up this way." 
</P>
<P>
Although he declined to give details of the Customs crackdown in Ventura, Santa 
Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties, Ramos said letters were sent last week to 
federal and local law enforcement agencies that might be involved in the 
smuggler task force. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that the only ports now officially patrolled on a full-time basis by 
Customs agents are Port Hueneme and Avila Bay, Ramos indicated that enforcement 
activities will be increased along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aggressive Presence 
</P>
<P>
Ramos pointedly declined comment when asked if Ventura Harbor and Channel 
Islands Harbor would be among the targets for increased scrutiny, but other law 
enforcement officials told The Times that plans call for a more aggressive 
presence in those areas. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to closer monitoring of possible maritime smuggling, Ramos said, 
the Customs Service wants to focus more attention on the small airports and 
hundreds of potential landing strips scattered throughout the three-county 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the recent seizure of almost 500 pounds of cocaine at a private landing 
strip in Santa Barbara County, Ramos said the wilderness areas of Ventura and 
surrounding counties are logical destinations for smugglers seeking to elude 
tighter anti-drug enforcement in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"All they have to do is add another fuel tank and they can make it to any of 
100 unapproved landing strips in this area," Ramos said. "At this point, marine 
smuggling is probably the biggest problem for us, but we also want to give more 
attention to the airports around here." 
</P>
<P>
The task force envisioned by the Customs Service probably will not be 
officially formed for at least a month, Ramos said, adding that the actual 
functions of such a joint federal and local effort are still in the planning 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're doing is just formalizing a lot of existing working relationships 
with other agencies," he said. "If we have something going in one area, it will 
give us extra resources." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Statistical Proof 
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the Customs Service has little statistical proof to support its view 
that smuggling is on the increase in the region, but cited several recent tips 
from reliable informants of major drug shipments headed for the area. 
</P>
<P>
"The Coast Guard took down 10 tons of marijuana off Santa Cruz just recently 
that was headed for this area," he said. "In the last 18 months, we have had 
reliable information of two major loads . . . that got through. We just don't 
know how much else is getting in." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the illegal drugs being smuggled into Ventura and the counties to the 
north are high-grade variants of Asian marijuana, Ramos said. But he said he is 
confident that both heroin and cocaine in smaller quantities are also being 
smuggled in by ship. 
</P>
<P>
One key partner in the planned task force will be the U.S. Coast Guard, Ramos 
said. He declined to rule out spot checks of ships in Ventura Harbor or Channel 
Islands Harbor by either Coast Guard or Customs vessels. 
</P>
<P>
While Ramos said he believes that there is some drug smuggling in Ventura and 
other areas, he said he thinks that Santa Barbara County has become the most 
active area in the region for drug smugglers. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos, a Customs agent since 1973, said he has watched smuggling activities 
switch from area to area over the years as enforcement activities have been 
stepped up in one locale or another. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Illegal Export Cases 
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the Customs Service, which devotes much of its attention in the 
Ventura area to illegal high-technology export cases, has become increasingly 
aggressive in its anti-smuggling activities in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Customs agents in California seized 271 pounds of heroin, 18,193 
pounds of cocaine, 88,465 pounds of hashish, 125,676 pounds of marijuana and 
1,262 pounds of opium. That compared to 169 pounds of heroin, 1,362 pounds of 
cocaine, 14 pounds of hashish, 68,065 pounds of marijuana and 211 pounds of 
opium just two years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Half of the heroin and almost 90% of the cocaine was seized in the San Diego 
and Los Angeles areas, one reason why Ramos and other Customs officials think 
that smugglers are actively looking for alternative entry points to the 
California drug-consuming market.

L.A. TEACHERS PACT COMPLICATES TALKS IN OTHER DISTRICTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SPENCER S. HSU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the shadow of the mammoth settlement reached last month by Los Angeles 
teachers, officials with the Beverly Hills, Culver City and Santa Monica-Malibu 
school districts are predicting slow going in contract and salary talks that 
will continue through the summer. 
</P>
<P>
While the latest round of negotiations offers no startling developments from 
either side, expectations raised by the 24% salary increase over three years 
won by Los Angeles teachers have solidified local teachers' demands. District 
administrators say such a reaction is to be expected, but repeat that fiscal 
realities are grim. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Los Angeles) settlement is way, way above what this district can afford 
to offer our teachers, and that of course puts us in a difficult position," 
said Culver City schools Supt. Kurt Rethmeyer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Time for Talks 
</P>
<P>
Between now and mid-August, Culver City and Beverly Hills unified school 
districts will reopen discussions on annual salary and benefit provisions, as 
guaranteed in the districts' existing contracts. The Santa Monica-Malibu 
Unified School District is negotiating a new contract to replace a two-year 
pact that expires Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles settlement was made possible in part by a projected state 
budget surplus, caused by an unexpected surge in tax revenue, of $2.5 billion. 
The smaller districts also will receive a share of this, although the precise 
amount each district receives won't be known for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the state windfall, however, local administrators doubt that they 
will have enough money to satisfy their teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"There's going to be a reluctance (by teachers) to accept the fact of our 
financial situation," Rethmeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Culver City, the smallest of the three Westside districts, may face the 
tightest financial crunch. Saddled with a declining enrollment and the 
subsequent reduction in state aid, the district has had to cut or reduce 
numerous programs. The Culver City Teachers Assn. (CCTA) says that its 
teachers' pay ranking has fallen from second among Los Angeles County's 45 
school districts to 38th over the past 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Our teachers are angry, too. We want to work . . . we want to be appreciated, 
we want to be paid," said Bess Doerr, CCTA president. Doerr says, although the 
union won a 6% raise last year, that boost only began to counteract years of 
much lower increases or periods when teachers were given bonuses instead of 
base-rate increases. 
</P>
<P>
This year, second in a three-year contract, teachers opened talks two weeks ago 
asking for an 8% raise. The district, which has 4,600 students and an annual 
budget of around $20 million, has responded with a 2% offer. 
</P>
<P>
"We're willing to cooperate, but we also want to be paid and respected," Doerr 
said. Referring to the state funds made available by the state's surge in tax 
revenue and the landmark public school funding measure approved last November, 
she said: "Proposition 98 passed, and there is a surplus." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Good Communications 
</P>
<P>
Doerr also praised the district's open lines for communication. In an 
interview, she took pains to avoid threatening a job action, such as the work 
stoppage and picketing by Culver City teachers three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The Los Angeles settlement really perked us up. The teachers were up jumping 
in the hall," she said, "We've been inspired by Los Angeles, and we do expect 
(the district) to work with us." 
</P>
<P>
Rethmeyer said, however, that the Los Angeles settlement was partly a product 
of rapid enrollment growth, which brought an increase in state funding. He said 
that because of the enrollment drop in Culver City, the district's increase in 
state aid might be as little as 1.4%. 
</P>
<P>
"I think all the parties are going to be disappointed, I guess that's what it 
boils down to," Rethmeyer said. He said that higher pay was the key to 
attracting good teachers, and that the alternative would be a "continuing 
deterioration" of the education system. 
</P>
<P>
In the Beverly Hills Unified School District, hopes are that teachers and 
administrators' shared frustration at state funding uncertainties will help 
settle their dispute. In June, 1987, the district barely avoided a strike 
through last-minute negotiations after 92% of teachers with the Beverly Hills 
Education Assn. (BHEA) voted to authorize a walkout. A year earlier, teachers 
picketed at the threat of job cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not blaming one another, accusing one another," said Robert French, 
Beverly Hills Unified School District superintendent. "It's the frustration 
that the funding of our schools is out of our control, it's with the state 
Legislature. I think we both understand that." 
</P>
<P>
He added that, in any event, the district could not match the Los Angeles 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Terms in Beverly Hills 
</P>
<P>
"I have a problem understanding the idea of an 8 plus 8 plus 8 (percent, 
three-year salary increase) in the cold world of a 4.6," French said, referring 
to a percentage by which many local observers were speculating that state 
funding would rise. 
</P>
<P>
But the BHEA has proposed a 12% boost in salary reopener talks in the third 
year of a three-year contract that so far has provided two raises of 3% each. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a considerably large core of teachers right now that are 
feeling quite strongly" about the 12% raise, said BHEA President Judy McIntyre. 
</P>
<P>
French, whose district has 4,800 students and a proposed $26-million annual 
budget, said that a counter-offer will not be announced until the district 
knows how much money it will get from the state. 
</P>
<P>
In the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District, where negotiations have 
been in progress for weeks over a new contract, the superintendent also says 
that Los Angeles' increase is out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
"The dilemma for us is we are not a growing district like Los Angeles is, and 
our actual income this coming year will be just about what it was this current 
year because of some decline in enrollment," said Eugene Tucker. "There's very 
little we can cut out any more," to free money for wages, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Automatic pay increases alone, for instance, which reward both teacher service 
and increases in their university credits, would outstrip new state outlays, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Progress is being made in the first half of the district's negotiating process, 
which involves non-monetary issues, Tucker said. These may include discussion 
similar to the ground-breaking Los Angeles arrangement where teachers gained a 
role in "power committees" in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Various Issues 
</P>
<P>
Although Tucker would not speak in detail, he said that "working conditions, 
planning time (and) grievance procedures" were all part of talks for the 
district, which includes 9,300 students and a budget of about $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
Salary negotiations are not expected to be completed before Aug. 17, again 
pending state action. 
</P>
<P>
June Lucas, Santa Monica-Malibu Classroom Teachers' Assn. president, would not 
comment on the state of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's any question that the settlement in Los Angeles raised 
or established an expectation level on the part of employees," said Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
"We will do everything we can to provide as fair a raise as we can," he said, 
"(but) there are still too many unknowns to the state budget, and that's the 
bottom line."

L.A. FINISHES FIRST PHASE OF REFURBISHING AT FERN DELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ESTHER SCHRADER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five years after community activists launched a fight to restore the Fern Dell 
section of Griffith Park, the initial phase of a Los Angeles-supervised 
refurbishment project has been completed. But city officials acknowledge that 
the effort has dragged and that a significant portion of the repair work has 
not begun. 
</P>
<P>
This month, 14 prefabricated bridges were installed, replacing steel and wood 
bridges that had become unsteady and unsafe. Railings were installed along the 
footpaths in the canyon that borders Fern Dell Avenue at the entrance to the 
park just north of Los Feliz Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
A bond issue approved by voters in 1984 provided $500,000 for the work on Fern 
Dell. The state funds were allocated after a community group, Friends of Fern 
Dell, spearheaded a drive for money to restore the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Irrigation System 
</P>
<P>
Still to be installed is a new $150,000 irrigation system. The ferns planted 
throughout the mile-long stream bed and canyon have been dying in recent years 
for lack of water. 
</P>
<P>
The state funds do not include the cost of installing the system. That will be 
paid by the city, but it is unclear when the complex of aboveground pipes will 
actually be installed, said Joel Breitbart, assistant general manager for 
planning and development for the city's Department of Recreation and Parks. 
</P>
<P>
The repairs have been delayed several times. 
</P>
<P>
The first time the proposal was up for bid, in 1985, the bids came in almost $1 
million over budget, Breitbart said. City architects rewrote the plans to cut 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
Then in December, 1987, the Department of Recreation and Parks awarded a 
$389,999 contract to Hacienda Landscape of Los Angeles to refurbish Fern Dell, 
and city officials said construction could start almost immediately.

Safety Assessment 
</P>
<P>
The work was held up for more than a year when inspectors at the Department of 
Building and Safety requested a safety assessment of each bridge and each 
bridge abutment in the dell. 
</P>
<P>
Installation of the bridges finally began earlier this spring. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a feeling, and justifiably so, that this has taken a long time, 
and certainly it has," Breitbart said. "Obviously, it could have gone better." 
</P>
<P>
Lenore Levan, who organized Friends of Fern Dell, said she is disappointed that 
the project -- a relatively minor one for the city -- has yet to be completed. 
</P>
<P>
"Since we did get the money and it was started because the community was 
interested, it really should be finished, and it shouldn't take five years to 
be done," she said.

NEW LAW PUTS LIMITS ON MOCK BOXING, WRESTLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a debate in which mock boxing and mock wrestling acts were variously 
described as harmless entertainment, a sex show and an incentive to batter 
women, the Long Beach City Council approved an ordinance that regulates the 
shows at local establishments. 
</P>
<P>
Regulation had been advocated by Councilman Warren Harwood, who warned in a 
memo to his colleagues that "exhibitions of mock fighting between scantily clad 
females and inebriated male customers may have the effect of sexual arousal, 
agitation, anger or other strong emotion among those participating and those 
witnessing these exhibitions." 
</P>
<P>
But Harwood wound up voting against the ordinance because it lacked many of the 
provisions he supported. Harwood argued that the ordinance should require women 
participants to wear one-piece bathing suits and breast protectors, and require 
the establishments to maintain a log of all patrons who participate in the 
wrestling. Although Councilman Jeffrey A. Kellogg did not favor the log 
provision, he too, thought the ordinance should be stronger and voted against 
it. The proposal passed 6 to 2 on first reading. Councilman Wallace Edgerton 
was absent. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance prohibits indecent exposure and lewd conduct during mock boxing 
and wrestling shows and requires establishments to obtain a city permit to 
stage them. One business in Long Beach now offers the shows, in which women in 
bathing suits box one another and wrestle with male customers.

$166-MILLION BUDGET OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city has approved a $166-million budget that will add 12 police officers to 
the 150-member force and provide for a new police station as part of a plan to 
beef up law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989-90 budget got final approval from the City Council on Tuesday night. 
The single dissenting vote came from Councilwoman Christine Reed, who objected 
to dipping into reserves to make up for a $4-million shortfall in income. 
</P>
<P>
Under the budget, spending will increase 5.8% over last year. Income is 
projected at $149.9 million and expenditures are put at $154.5 million. Most of 
an additional $12 million for the police station is expected to come from bond 
proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the debate at Tuesday's meeting centered on whether more money should 
be allotted to neighborhood associations and social service agencies. The 
council finally voted an additional $50,000 to hire another staff organizer to 
work with the Mid-City Neighbors Assn. despite that group's failure to meet 
several city requirements. The Mid-City group claimed that it needed help 
because of an onslaught of development in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Other items on the city budget include a traffic management plan, an 
environment-monitoring program, child care and Sunday hours for the public 
library.

CODES, HOTEL TAX BOLSTERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Funding for a code-enforcement task force and an increase in the hotel tax were 
among the changes approved in the final operating budget adopted by the City 
Council Monday night for the fiscal year that starts July 1. 
</P>
<P>
The task force will consist of two officers now working in building and 
property code enforcement, two additional officers, a deputy city attorney to 
prosecute violators, and two staff people, said Finance Director Robert 
Norquist. The cost of the task force, including computer and office equipment 
is $260,000. 
</P>
<P>
"This group will encourage and promote Culver City as a nicer, cleaner place to 
live and work by making sure property is kept up to a certain level and 
deterioration doesn't set in," Norquist said. 
</P>
<P>
The council also approved an increase in the transient occupancy tax -- the 
city's levy on hotel and motel rooms -- to 12% from 10%.

COUNCILMAN SNAVELY'S SENTENCING POSTPONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sentencing of South Gate Councilman Odell L. Snavely for harboring two teen-age 
girls at his toy store when he knew they should have been in school has been 
continued until July 28. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Court Commissioner J. Francis Spelman last week granted the 
continuance after Snavely's attorney requested that his client be allowed to 
seek advice from another lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Kenton E. Krogstad told the commissioner during a June 23 sentencing 
hearing in Huntington Park Municipal Court that Snavely wanted to make a motion 
before the court but he had counseled Snavely against it. Krogstad told the 
court he had advised Snavely against making the motion until he had conferred 
with another lawyer. Neither Snavely nor Krogstad said what the motion was. 
</P>
<P>
In February, Snavely pleaded no contest to two misdemeanor charges of 
contributing to the truancy of a minor. Each count is punishable by up to one 
year in jail and a fine of up to $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Kenneth Freeman said he agreed to the continuance rather 
than face the possibility later of having the outcome reversed on some 
technicality. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman has recommended that Snavely serve a one-year jail term and be placed 
on five years probation. 
</P>
<P>
Before the February plea, the Sheriff's Department conducted a six-month 
investigation of Snavely after two South Gate Junior High School girls, ages 13 
and 14, alleged that Snavely touched them on the breasts while they were 
working at his business, Del's Gifts and Toys. Freeman has stated that the 
investigation did not produce enough evidence to file molestation charges 
against Snavely. 
</P>
<P>
According to a Sheriff's Department report, which is part of Snavely's court 
file, four girls claimed they had been molested by Snavely, who would pay them 
to help clean up his store. 
</P>
<P>
Snavely has denied molesting anyone and said the girls fabricated the 
accusations to distract from the theft of some jewelry from his store. He said 
he had threatened to report them for truancy unless they returned the jewelry.

COURT LETS MALL PLAN STAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Culver City will prepare a supplemental environmental impact report for the 
proposed Marina Place shopping mall, but will not have to rescind its overall 
approval of the project, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge decided last week. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides claimed victory in the first hearing of what could be a long court 
battle over construction of the 1-million-square-foot mall on Washington 
Boulevard, where the western tip of Culver City juts into Los Angeles near 
Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
Culver City Atty. Joseph Pannone said the city had planned to do a supplemental 
environmental study anyway, and that Judge Kurt J. Lewin's decision to allow 
the approvals to stand upholds the city's right to establish its own zoning 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
Debra Bowen, an attorney representing the Venice Town Council, which along with 
the city of Los Angeles filed suit last September against Culver City 
contending that the environmental report was inadequate and threatened public 
access to the beach, said the neighborhood group got what it was asking for in 
the preparation of a new study. 
</P>
<P>
In April, the Venice Town Council rejected a settlement offer by the mall's 
developer, Prudential Insurance Co., which consisted of $6.7 million in road 
improvements and other measures to ease traffic flow and a $5-million trust 
fund to build affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
But the talks fell through when the group demanded a 50% reduction in the size 
of the project. Prudential officials made it clear that the size of the project 
was not negotiable. 
</P>
<P>
Before the court hearing late last week, the Culver City Council approved the 
scope of work for the supplemental report. A draft of the new report, which is 
expected to cost about $61,000 and is to be paid by Prudential, is expected to 
be ready by late summer.

END GOVERNMENT OF, BY AND FOR DEVELOPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura has a pro-growth City Council -- Monahan, McWherter, Drake, Crew and 
Sullard. They've appointed a bunch of cement-loving Chamber of Commerce yes-men 
to the various boards and commissions, particularly the committee to review 
Ventura's future. The pro-growth forces should not be allowed to plan for the 
future at the expense of everyone else's -- it's like letting the Bloods and 
Crips rewrite the penal codes. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind this whole update scenario began in response to growing public 
dissatisfaction with rampant development, all this traffic and all this 
concrete. That's why the council's decision to allow 25,000 new Venturans is 
such an outrage. 
</P>
<P>
The underlying assumption for all this is the inevitability of growth. Well, 
that which hasn't happened yet certainly is not inevitable. Growth certainly is 
not inevitable in Ojai or Santa Barbara -- two cities where local government 
cares for its citizens and its quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
The question is simple. Everyone in L.A. wants to live here, so are we going to 
let them? I say hell no! 
</P>
<P>
This is not a time for compromise, ladies and gentlemen; this is war. It's the 
Ventura City Council and their buddies, the developers, against the rest of us. 
Local government of the developers, by the developers and for the developers 
has gone on long enough.

City Manager John Jalili said 33 staffers from the finance and risk management

</P>
<P>
The move to Guest Quarters will be temporary, Jalili said. The city is planning

Race-car driver David Kudrave took an unexpected spin last weekend on a 
grease-slickened course at the American Racing Series event in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
Kudrave, driving a 430-horsepower Indy-style car sponsored by Arciero Wines, 
spun out on the final turn of the 40-lap race Sunday and finished ninth. He 
earned $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of our preseason races were in cool weather," said Kudrave, who lives in 
La Canada. "But the last two races have been under hot conditions and the track 
gets a little bit greasier. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to make up ground on the guy ahead of me and it cost me three 
places." 
</P>
<P>
Kudrave, 23, had qualified fifth at 105.1 m. p. h. over the 2 1/2-mile course. 
His next race is in two weeks in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
All-Star football: The first Burbank-Glendale-area All-Star Football Game will 
be played Saturday at 7:30 p.m. at Burroughs High in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy-two graduating seniors from 24 high schools in Glendale and the San 
Fernando Valley will participate in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Gerard of Marshall heads the Glendale-area coaching staff that also 
includes Dennis Hughes of Hoover and Charley Mack of Verdugo Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids have been very cooperative," said Gerard, who led his team to the 
Northeast League championship last season. "We've had great attendance and good 
attitude. They get along well and have been helping each other." 
</P>
<P>
Sid Oxford of Marshall will start at quarterback, joining Tony Gibson of 
Marshall and Rafik Thorossian of Glendale in the backfield. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams will use a 52 defense and linebacker blitzes are against the rules. 
If a team trails by eight points after scoring in the fourth quarter, it will 
have the option to receive the ensuing kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids are learning pretty fast," Wagner said. 
</P>
<P>
More all-star football: Workouts began Tuesday for the Glendale-area high 
school players that will participate in the Daily News All-Star Football Game 
on July 14 at Birmingham High. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Plaisance of Village Christian and Jeff Engilman of Sylmar are the coaches 
for the 38-player East team. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale-area players include Greg Thompson of La Canada, Fred Hughes of St. 
Francis and Greg Lloyd of Village Christian. 
</P>
<P>
Darren Haines of Crescenta Valley, Jeff Dyrek of St. Francis and Kevin Ebenhock 
of Village Christian are alternates. 
</P>
<P>
Honor roll: Eric Jacobson of Eagle Rock High has been named All-City Section in 
tennis. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobson, a senior, was selected to the first team. Jade Ellis of Eagle Rock 
was named to the second team.

Rene Gonzales pushed through the doors of the visitors' clubhouse at Anaheim 
Stadium last Thursday and, as is his habit, immediately fixed his gaze upon the 
Baltimore Orioles' lineup card posted 50 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the distance, Gonzales instantly spied his name in the column reserved 
for right-handed pinch-hitters. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales, the Orioles' reluctant utility man, shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been blessed with talents and ability to play a lot of different 
positions, which is good and bad," Gonzales said while settling into a chair in 
front of his dressing stall. "I think I should be playing every day.

<P>
"When you're playing ball in school, no one ever says, 'I'm going to be a 
utility ballplayer in the big leagues.' It's just not the way it is. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who is content with that role is a fool or a loser because if you 
don't think you can be playing every day, then what's the use of being here?" 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore has found several uses for Gonzales, 27, a former Glendale College 
shortstop who has proved a valuable component for the upstart Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Gonzales played in 72 games -- 63 at third base and the others at 
shortstop, second base, first base and in right field. 
</P>
<P>
This season, in a similarly versatile role, he has played in more than 30 
games, batting .244 with a home run, six runs batted in and five stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Gonzales) doesn't like the term 'utility,' " Orioles' Manager Frank 
Robinson said. "He feels he's capable of playing on an everyday basis and 
that's good -- I like that. But at this time I think he fits our needs where 
he's at. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't mope about it, he has a good attitude and that's why he fits on 
this ballclub." 
</P>
<P>
Said sportswriter Tim Kurkjian, who covers the Orioles for the Baltimore Sun: 
"It never looks like Rene needs to be in there for 10 straight days. He comes 
off the bench after having not played in two weeks and he never hurts you." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales made a name for himself last season when he briefly changed his name 
from Rene to R.C., even though his middle name is Adrian. R.C. just sounded 
better, Gonzalez said. Besides, he was tired of public-address and radio 
announcers confusing him with former Orioles shortstop Kiko Garcia and other 
players with Hispanic names. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales, who grew up in Rosemead, signed his first professional contract in 
1982 after the Montreal Expos selected him in the fifth round of the draft out 
of Cal State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Expos hailed him as their shortstop of the future and cleared a path to the 
big leagues by releasing or trading several veterans, including Chris Speier. 
</P>
<P>
However, in the winter of 1986, Gonzales was traded to the Orioles for catcher 
John Stefero. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore's plan supposedly called for Gonzales to play shortstop, which would 
allow perennial all-star Cal Ripken Jr. to move to third. Yet two and half 
years later, Ripken continues as the iron man shortstop while Gonzales 
languishes as a reserve. 
</P>
<P>
"The day will come when I play every day -- maybe not with the Baltimore 
Orioles," said Gonzales, who is in the final year of his contract. He is 
eligible for arbitration at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now I'm playing behind a future Hall of Famer," Gonzales said. "What can 
I do? 
</P>
<P>
"It's frustrating, but the way things are going so far this year, it makes it a 
little easier to swallow." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, fortune certainly has changed this season for the Orioles, who set a 
major league record by losing their first 21 games in 1988 and finished with a 
54-107 mark -- worst in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Baltimore has led the American League East since May 26, spending 
more time in first place than any other major league team. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the players who struggled through the dismal 1988 season aren't with 
the team this year. Longtime first baseman Eddie Murray is with the Dodgers. 
Veteran outfielder Fred Lynn is playing in Detroit. Only five players who 
started last season with the Orioles remain on the roster today. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a mix of veterans and young guys last year and it just didn't work," 
Gonzales said. "Our work ethic was pretty poor. Fundamentally, it was probably 
one of the worst teams I've been on. 
</P>
<P>
"In those first 21 games you can't mix a win in? Come on! With a lineup like 
Freddie Lynn and Terry Kennedy and Ripken and Murray? There's something wrong. 
I look back and can't remember guys bunting somebody else over, getting the 
ball to the right side or hitting sacrifice flies. 
</P>
<P>
"They (management) cleaned house and brought in a new attitude . . . From 
spring training, it was 'Fundamentals, fundamentals, fundamentals.' Everyone 
was striving for a job and I think that attitude carried over to the season. 
</P>
<P>
"This year you come to the ballpark at 2:30 and half the team is there -- guys 
are working out and everybody is joking with everybody else. Last year, you 
wouldn't have that. 
</P>
<P>
"We've won a lot of games on our hustle and enthusiasm alone -- and we're only 
going to get better."

LAB SHUT FOR MISDIAGNOSES ALSO SERVED OUT-OF-STATE CLIENTS; 
</P>
<P>
NATIONWIDE ALERT PLANNED FOR PAP SMEAR TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California health officials said Tuesday that they will issue an advisory to 
warn health officers nationwide that a Tarzana medical laboratory accused of 
misdiagnosing medical tests may have done business in their states. 
</P>
<P>
Department of Health Services spokesman Norm Hartman said the advisory will 
warn that the laboratory, Central Pathology Services Medical Group, 
misdiagnosed 21% of a random selection of Pap smear tests and was shut down in 
April. He said the notice will be issued through the National Public Health 
Information Coalition, which represents public health officers in 42 states. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to alert everybody this is going on," Hartman said. He was unsure how 
many states that the laboratory had served, but said he believed that it 
handled tests from Washington, Indiana, Arizona and Illinois, among others. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite a lot of business came from out of state," he said. "Thirty to 40% of 
the obstetricians and gynecologists in Chicago were sending their business to 
this lab." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unaware of Role 
</P>
<P>
Hartman said he is concerned that doctors in distant cities may be unaware of 
what has happened in California, even though their patients' tests may have 
been sent to Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the lab, Martin Cooper, said it "is an inaccurate perception 
that a significant amount of business out of this lab came from out of state." 
He also said the lab's affiliate, Central Diagnostic Laboratory, is not doing 
any Pap tests. Those tests are now being sent to Pennsylvania, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Central Pathology processed about 2,600 Pap tests -- used to detect cervical 
cancer -- each day. But after errors were detected by federal authorities early 
this year, the lab first lost its authority to participate in Medi-Cal and 
Medicare health insurance programs, then closed its doors under pressure from 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
The state sued Central Diagnostic and Central Pathology in May, along with four 
other defendants, for $3 million and asked for a court order requiring the 
firms to do free Pap tests for millions of women who it had screened during the 
last five years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sent Letters 
</P>
<P>
Central Diagnostic responded by sending letters to 15,000 physicians advising 
that the rescreening is available for patients who want it. 
</P>
<P>
But Hartman said he is concerned that those letters may not go far enough. He 
said Central Diagnostic reported the results of the tests performed by Central 
Pathology. Doctors, therefore, might not be aware that the Pap smear they sent 
out for analysis was reviewed by Central Pathology, Hartman said. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper responded that the letters sent out by the lab do not hide Central 
Pathology's role. "Their own attorney approved the letter," he said of state 
health officials. "They would be wise to check that fact." 
</P>
<P>
The advisory will be forwarded to the 41 other members of the coalition through 
the federal Centers for Disease Control, based in Atlanta. Hartman said the 
advisory is the first issue of concern to be addressed by the coalition since 
it was formed earlier this year.

<P>
THOUSAND OAKS GIVES NOURISHMENT TO 'URBAN FOREST' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A better name for Thousand Oaks might be "15,500 Oaks or Thereabouts," judging 
from a tree census being taken as part of the city's ambitious plan to preserve 
its urban forest. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, if numbers of non-native trees were what counted, then Sycamore City 
or Pineville might suit it as a name just as well. 
</P>
<P>
But Thousand Oaks is having its trees counted as part of an effort to make sure 
that they last for generations -- not to rename the city. The census is just 
one aspect of an unusually detailed tree preservation and maintenance plan that 
experts say will thrust Thousand Oaks into the forefront of a resurgent urban 
forestry movement. 
</P>
<P>
The city commissioned the five-volume study by a team of landscape architects 
in January for $100,000. When the study is finished in October in time for 
Thousand Oaks' 25th anniversary, residents will be able to use a computer at 
City Hall to find out the species of trees most likely to flourish in their 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
500 Building Permits 
</P>
<P>
Developers will find it more difficult to get the 500 building permits 
available each year under the city's growth-control law unless they plant 
plenty of trees and give them room to grow. Thousand Oaks will also enact stiff 
tree-protection ordinances outlined in the plan to reduce tree sabotage and 
removal of city-owned trees prompted by homeowner complaints of roots buckling 
sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
Other cities, including Los Angeles, have large landscaping crews to take care 
of trees on public land, but "there aren't a lot of places like Thousand Oaks 
that have good plans to keep their forests thriving in the concrete jungle," 
said Gary A. Moll, editor of a bimonthly newsletter published by the 
Washington-based American Forestry Assn., a nonprofit organization devoted to 
improving the health of the nation's forests. 
</P>
<P>
Only 15% of American cities have formal plans to manage their "urban forests," 
as trees planted in median strips, parks and along streets have collectively 
come to be known, Moll said. 
</P>
<P>
However, increasing awareness of the role of trees as a counter to a possible 
global warming trend is prompting new interest in the urban forestry movement, 
which first blossomed in the Midwest in the 1960s and withered in the late 
1970s, Moll said. Trees soak up carbon dioxide, which some researchers say is 
causing a "greenhouse effect," and convert it to oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Computerized Inventory 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the Los Angeles City Council earlier this month appropriated 
$500,000 for a computerized tree inventory, the first step toward better 
management of the 680,000 trees on public land, said Bob Kennedy, street tree 
supervisor for the Los Angeles Department of Public Works. Like Thousand Oaks', 
the inventory will attempt to record the location, type, condition and 
maintenance history of every city-owned tree. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very tough to put together a plan because it requires a whole lot of 
cooperation among different city fiefdoms, like the parks department, planning 
and public works," said Andy Litkis, executive director of TreePeople, a 
nonprofit conservation organization based on Mulholland Drive at Coldwater 
Canyon Avenue. "I have to congratulate Thousand Oaks." 
</P>
<P>
But officials of Thousand Oaks, which has about 200,000 trees, said they didn't 
start out with lofty ideals, such as cooling global temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the selling points of this forestry master plan is definitely to reduce 
the city's liability" in civil lawsuits filed by people who trip and fall on 
sidewalks cracked by tree roots, said Shawn M. Mason, Thousand Oaks' assistant 
city attorney. The city intends to establish a record of taking all possible 
precautions to prevent such accidents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Only about five lawsuits have been filed in the past two years, Mason said, 
enough to cause concern in this eastern Ventura County city of about 108,000 on 
the border of Los Angeles County. The city has spent about $725,000 during the 
same period to repair cracked sidewalks caused by the growth of trees planted 
by developers two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was also spurred by calls from about 25 residents a month requesting 
the removal of trees, said Joe Bravo, the city's landscape supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of these people say the trees are a safety hazard, when a lot of them 
just want to re-landscape and the trees don't fit their motif," Bravo said. 
"Sometimes if we won't remove the trees, they'll drill holes in them or pour 
gas on them to cause them to die." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tree Sabotage 
</P>
<P>
Tree sabotage is not unique to Thousand Oaks, landscapers say. In Santa 
Barbara, city crews stopped planting large trees in Shoreline Park because they 
were systematically destroyed by citizens angry over obstruction of their ocean 
views, said Billy Goodnick, a consultant with the San Francisco firm of Wolfe 
Mason Associates, which is drafting the Thousand Oaks plan. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks officials hope to counter the destruction of trees by measures 
such as enacting tough ordinances prohibiting their removal without special 
permits and fining residents thousands of dollars for violations. They will 
also plant trees, such as liquid amber or sycamores, whose root systems are 
less likely to cause safety problems. Another alternative, they said, is to 
give the roots more room by narrowing the sidewalks where they pass trees, 
although enough room must be left for residents, especially the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
Since April, an urban forestry committee made up of neighborhood activists, 
schools and parks officials, landscape architects and business leaders has been 
overseeing the study.

COUNTY STUDIES ALTERNATIVES FOR WASTE DISPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WARD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The county Sanitation Districts are studying 10 proposals from major waste 
haulers, railroads and entrepreneurs offering to take trash from Los Angeles 
County to the desert by train to be recycled, buried or burned. 
</P>
<P>
One company proposes to load 7,000 tons of trash a day on trains in City of 
Industry, Irwindale and La Verne and haul the waste 185 miles to an abandoned 
iron ore pit in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
Another company would build a waste separation and recycling plant at Puente 
Hills landfill near Hacienda Heights and ship trash by rail to a plant near 
Victorville for processing into construction materials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trash Exportation 
</P>
<P>
And a third company proposes to accept the rail-shipment of all the waste 
generated every day in Los Angeles County -- 45,000 tons -- at a dump in Kern 
County. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals were submitted to the county Sanitation Districts in response to 
a request for proposals for the design, financing and development of systems to 
export trash from Los Angeles County to remote areas. 
</P>
<P>
The districts issued the request for proposals at the urging of the San Gabriel 
Valley Assn. of Cities, which began looking into the feasibility of rail-haul 
in 1986 as an alternative to trash-burning plants proposed in Irwindale, Puente 
Hills and Pomona. Environmental opposition killed the trash-burning projects, 
but cities have continued to pursue the rail-haul alternative. 
</P>
<P>
A study undertaken by the Southern California Assn. of Governments last year 
found that hauling trash from the San Gabriel Valley to remote disposal sites 
by rail is "technically feasible and offers a potential solution to the solid 
waste disposal crisis projected for the 1990s." 
</P>
<P>
The report by the regional planning agency noted that landfills in Los Angeles 
County are nearing capacity and that recycling is only a partial solution. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, 58% of the county's trash goes to landfills in the San Gabriel 
Valley and nearby Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Closed by Noon 
</P>
<P>
The county's largest landfill, Puente Hills, is so busy that it is often closed 
to trash trucks by noon because it has reached its daily permitted limit of 
13,200 tons. Other landfills also are operating at capacity and county 
officials have predicted that by 1992, the amount of trash being generated may 
exceed the available landfill space by 6,000 tons a day. 
</P>
<P>
The Sanitation Districts are exploring six potential landfill sites in Los 
Angeles County, but there are numerous obstacles, such as opposition from 
neighbors and stringent environmental regulations, which could delay or kill 
the projects. Thus, the Sanitation Districts have begun looking into the 
feasibility of shipping trash out of the county. 
</P>
<P>
Charles W. Carry, chief engineer and general manager of the Sanitation 
Districts, said the rail-haul proposals received from private companies ranged 
from letters a few pages long to books thick with technical detail. Some of the 
proposals, he said, "are well thought out and rather complete. Others are 
little more than an expression of interest." 
</P>
<P>
His staff was scheduled to evaluate the proposals and was to have reported its 
initial findings to the waste management task force of the San Gabriel Valley 
Assn. of Cities on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Harvey, task force chairman, said he has not seen the proposals, but the 
fact that they have come from railroads and major firms in the waste disposal 
industry is encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pleased with the extent of interest shown," Harvey said. 
</P>
<P>
What remains to be seen, he said, is whether trash can be sent to the desert 
for disposal at prices that are competitive with other options and whether such 
difficult problems as finding acceptable sites for loading the trains can be 
solved. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the difficulties are already apparent. 
</P>
<P>
Mine Reclamation Corp. has proposed building waste-loading stations in La 
Verne, Irwindale and Industry and hauling 7,000 tons of trash a day by rail to 
a disposal site at Eagle Mountain in Riverside County. Gary Kovall, senior vice 
president and general counsel of Mine Reclamation, said the company notified La 
Verne, Irwindale and Industry of proposed train-loading locations and, he said, 
"I would not describe their reaction as one of open arms." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Irwindale 'Negative' 
</P>
<P>
"Industry was the most open," Kovall said. "Irwindale was negative and La Verne 
was like, 'You've got to be kidding.' " 
</P>
<P>
Two of the proposed sites, along Southern Pacific railroad lines in Industry 
and Irwindale, were suggested in the study by the Southern California Assn. of 
Governments. The third site, across from Brackett Field in La Verne, was found 
independently by Mine Reclamation Corp. But Harvey, a member of the La Verne 
City Council, said that the site appears to conflict with plans to develop a 
103-acre research and development complex. 
</P>
<P>
Kovall stressed that Mine Reclamation Corp. is not wedded to any particular 
loading site. 
</P>
<P>
"We haved mentioned our interest in having about 10 acres in those areas (of 
Industry, Irwindale and La Verne)," he said. "But that is very preliminary. We 
have not made any steps to acquire real estate or anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Kovall said, the better approach may well be to use existing 
landfills, such as Spadra in Pomona or Puente Hills, as sites to receive trash, 
separate glass, plastics, metals and other materials for recycling and then 
compact and load the remaining waste into 20-foot long containers that could be 
trucked to a rail line and loaded onto rail cars. 
</P>
<P>
Kovall said his company is willing to explore a wide range of options with the 
Sanitation Districts or the cities that would be served. 
</P>
<P>
Robert H. Collins III, president and chief executive officer of Mine 
Reclamation, said the location of train-loading stations will be based "on 
which municipalities want to go ahead and rail-haul to Eagle Mountain. There's 
no point in having a transfer station in the east end of the San Gabriel Valley 
if you're going to be moving waste from the west end or the north end." 
</P>
<P>
Mine Reclamation's chief asset is its 100-year lease on 8,000 acres at the 
Eagle Mountain mine, near Desert Center. 
</P>
<P>
The mine was opened in 1948 to supply iron ore to the Kaiser steel mill in 
Fontana and was closed in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Collins said the mine's east pit is large enough to receive 16,000 tons of 
trash a day for 100 years. Kaiser Steel Resources Inc., which owns the mine, 
would receive a portion of the trash disposal fee under its lease arrangement 
with Mine Reclamation. Mine Reclamation is a privately held corporation whose 
owners include Herzog Contracting Corp., a San Diego landfill management firm; 
EDCO Disposal, a waste collection company based in Lemon Grove in San Diego 
County, and Itel Corp., a Chicago firm that leases railroad cars and other 
transportation equipment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Riverside Plan 
</P>
<P>
The Riverside County Board of Supervisors has instructed its staff to negotiate 
an agreement with Mine Reclamation that would give the county a fee for 
allowing the importation of trash to Eagle Mountain. County officials said 
their approval of the project will depend on whether the landfill operation and 
rail-haul can be accomplished with environmental safety and whether it will 
benefit the area economically. 
</P>
<P>
Mine Reclamation earlier this month filed an application with Riverside County 
for a land-use permit, specific plan and zone changes at Eagle Mountain. The 
project will require environmental impact studies and permits from various 
governmental agencies. Company officials said the landfill could be in 
operation by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the proposals submitted to the Sanitation Districts did not specify 
where trash trains would be loaded, but at least three of the proposals would 
serve the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
International Technology Corp. of Torrance and the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa 
Fe Railway Co. proposed a system that would handle 6,000 tons of trash a day. 
The plan calls for processing waste at landfills at Puente Hills, Spadra, 
Calabasas and Scholl Canyon in Glendale, to remove materials that can be 
recycled. The remainder would then be put in containers to be hauled by truck 
to the City of Commerce and then by train to Adelanto and Needles in San 
Bernardino County. Plants in those desert communities would turn the refuse 
into fuel for factories or use it to generate electrical power. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Re-Use of Waste 
</P>
<P>
Western Product Recovery Group, Inc. of Escondido and the Union Pacific Corp. 
proposed a plan for 3,500 tons of trash a day at Puente Hills landfill. A 
processing plant would be built at Puente Hills to separate materials for 
recycling and to process refuse into fuel. Some refuse would be shipped by 
truck to the City of Commerce for transfer to trains bound for the Victorville 
area, where a plant would be established to produce construction materials. 
</P>
<P>
Grace Chan, supervisor of solid waste planning with the Sanitation Districts, 
said a number of companies submitted proposals without specifying where trash 
would be loaded onto trains. Other companies, she said, asked that potential 
loading sites, proposed disposal rates and other information be kept 
confidential. 
</P>
<P>
Western Waste Industries Inc. of Gardena proposed a system to handle 12,000 
tons of trash a day at a rate of $65 to $75 a ton, but asked that loading 
stations and disposal sites remain confidential. Browning-Ferris Industries of 
California Inc. did not specify loading stations or disposal sites, but 
estimated that it could develop a system that could handle 16,000 tons of trash 
a day at a rate of $60 to $90 a ton. 
</P>
<P>
Sage Resources of Los Angeles and the United States Borax and Chemical Corp. 
offered disposal sites in Kern County, but did not submit plans for hauling the 
trash there. Earth Technology Corp. of Long Beach proposed a Kern County 
disposal site that could handle 45,000 tons of trash a day. 
</P>
<P>
Waste Management of North America, Inc. and the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe 
Railway Co. proposed a system to take 6,000 tons of trash a day from the City 
of Commerce and El Segundo to a landfill at Amboy in San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
Railex Special Projects Group of Vancouver, British Columbia, proposed the 
rail-haul of up to 13,000 tons of trash a day from unspecified locations to 
various refuse-to-energy plants in Barstow and other San Bernardino County 
communities. The firm said the cost would be $28 a ton. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Give Me Your Trash' 
</P>
<P>
Carry, the Sanitation Districts' general manager, said the $28-per-ton figure 
is unrealistically low. 
</P>
<P>
Disposal rates at landfills in Los Angeles County currently range from $10 to 
$25 a ton. The rail-haul study by the Southern California Assn. of Governments 
last year estimated that trash could be shipped from the San Gabriel Valley and 
disposed of in remote sites for $29 to $41 a ton. 
</P>
<P>
Mine Reclamation declined to disclose its proposed disposal rate, but Kovall, 
its general counsel, said the amount is under $50 a ton. 
</P>
<P>
One of the difficulties in creating a rail-haul system is overcoming the 
competitive disadvantage of comparatively cheap disposal rates at local 
landfills. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't put up a big sign that says, 'Give me your trash for $50 a ton,' 
while Puente Hills is charging $14," Kovall said. "The trucks are not going to 
pull in." 
</P>
<P>
Kovall said it undoubtedly will cost more to haul trash to the desert than to a 
local landfill, but there are environmental benefits to be obtained from 
rail-haul, including reduced truck traffic, if train-loading stations are 
properly located. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Sanitation Districts said they will interview the companies 
that have submitted rail-haul proposals and then submit evaluations to district 
directors and the San Gabriel Valley Assn. of Cities. Then, officials said, 
they may take the most promising proposals and ask companies to develop them in 
further detail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SOME OF THE PROPOSALS 
</P>
<P>
Mine Reclamation Corp. has proposed building waste-loading stations in La 
Verne, Irwindale and Industry and hauling 7,000 tons of trash a day by rail to 
a disposal site at Eagle Mountain in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
International Technology Corp. of Torrance and the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa 
Fe Railway Co. proposed a system that would handle 6,000 tons of trash a day. 
The plan calls for processing waste at landfills at Puente Hills, Spadra, 
Calabasas and Scholl Canyon in Glendale, to remove materials that can be 
recycled. The remainder would then be put in containers to be hauled by truck 
to the City of Commerce and then by train to Adelanto and Needles in San 
Bernardino County. Plants in those desert communities would turn the refuse 
into fuel for factories or use it to generate electrical power. 
</P>
<P>
Western Product Recovery Group, Inc. of Escondido and the Union Pacific Corp. 
proposed a plan for 3,500 tons of trash a day at Puente Hills landfill. A 
processing plant would be built at Puente Hills to separate materials for 
recycling and to process refuse into fuel. Some refuse would be shipped by 
truck to the City of Commerce for transfer to trains bound for the Victorville 
area, where a plant would be established to produce construction materials. 
</P>
<P>
Railex Special Projects Group of Vancouver, British Columbia, proposed the 
rail-haul of up to 13,000 tons of trash a day from unspecified locations to 
various refuse-to-energy plants in Barstow and other San Bernardino County 
communities.

CAMARILLO BASKETBALL A SERIOUS SUMMER SPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sean Waters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Camarillo High has had its basketball team on the run since the end of the 
school year. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Scorpions played nine games in seven days while competing in the 
L. A. Summer Games and the Mater Dei Summer Tournament in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"We spent a lot of time in the car together and got to know each other real 
well," junior guard David Harbour said. "It seemed like we had to change the 
radio station every five minutes to keep everyone happy." 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo's journey began June 17th and 18th with three games in the Summer 
Games at high schools in the South Bay area. The Scorpions beat Hollywood, 
61-37, Rubidoux, 46-40, and Dominguez, 40-26. 
</P>
<P>
Next were opening games in the Santa Clara summer league on Monday June 19th 
and the Royal summer league two days later. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo came close to pulling off an upset before losing to Saddleback, 
77-76, in the first round of the Mater Dei tournament Thursday. The Scorpions 
led Saddleback, runner-up to Southern Section 5-AA champion Long Beach 
Millikan, by as many as 19 points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, Camarillo rebounded to defeat Trabuco Hills, 94-71, in a consolation 
game at Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's doubleheader began with an 8:30 a.m. game at Mater Dei. The 
Scorpions beat Bosco Tech, 79-76. Then it was back in the car en route to an 
afternoon game against Rolling Hills at El Camino College in Torrance. They 
lost, 62-48, in the championship quarterfinals of the Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
"It was tough but good for us," Harbour said. "We're playing teams and we're 
finding out what it takes to beat the best." 
</P>
<P>
Harbour, 5-10 guard Rick Schnell and 6-5 center Scott Foster are returning 
starters. 
</P>
<P>
New Raider coach: Ventura County Community College trustees approved Ken 
Wagner's selection as Moorpark College baseball coach Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner, coach of the Camarillo High baseball team for the past seven seasons, 
was named to a similar position at Moorpark last week. He succeeds Ron 
Stillwell, who resigned in May at the end of his fifth season at Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner, 43, compiled a 98-63-1 record and his teams won two Marmonte League 
titles at Camarillo. The Scorpions were 12-13 this season and finished tied for 
fourth in the league with a 5-7 mark. 
</P>
<P>
The Scorpions advanced to the Southern Section 5-A Division finals in 1985 but 
lost to Fountain Valley, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner will continue to teach physical education at Camarillo and coach at 
Moorpark on a walk-on basis. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm ready to try something new, so I was really pleased to be 
selected," Wagner said. "I've really enjoyed the high school kids, but Moorpark 
gives me a chance to work with some different kids." 
</P>
<P>
Wagner said that Mel Bannon, his assistant at Camarillo, and Mario Porto, 
former coach at Moorpark High, will join him as assistants. Porto last season 
guided Moorpark High to its first baseball playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
"I coached with Mario in several all-star games and have known him for a long 
time," Wagner said. "We're lucky he wants to coach with us. He felt, as I do, 
that it was a good opportunity to move up and coach at the college level." 
</P>
<P>
And so the shuffling of Ventura County baseball coaches continues. Last week, 
Royal High hired Danny Maye to replace Mike McCurdy and Camarillo selected Jack 
Willard, a Scorpion assistant, for the position vacated by Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
Still looking: Athletic Director Don Brockett has seven applicants for the 
position of Oxnard College baseball coach. 
</P>
<P>
Brockett said that he expects later this week to name a replacement for George 
Peraza, who resigned in May after one season as coach. The Condors finished the 
season 16-15, 11-9 in the Western State Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Quick to forgive: Some thought Santa Clara would never be allowed to play in 
another Orange County basketball tournament, but there it was entered in the 
Mater Dei Summer Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
And involved in another forfeit. 
</P>
<P>
This time the Saints were the benefactors when Camarillo failed to show up for 
the consolation championship. The Scorpions, however, notified tournament 
officials in advance that they would not appear. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara has been prohibited to play tournaments during the 1989-90 season 
after forfeiting two games last year in a Christmas tournament at Estancia 
High. 
</P>
<P>
Back in action: Center Nichole Ellis and guard Lianne Ishikawa returned to play 
their first games for the Buena High girls' basketball team after missing 
portions of last season with debilitating injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis, a 5-11 senior, did not play last season after tearing ligaments in her 
left knee. Ishikawa, a 5-5 guard, was sidelined half of the season after 
dislocating her left ankle and suffering ligament damage. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good to have both of them back in the lineup," Buena Coach Joe Vaughan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Buena reached the quarterfinals of the L. A. Games before losing to eventual 
champion Washington, 44-36. 
</P>
<P>
Quick exit: After a slow start, Kurt Schwan expected to have a high-scoring 
second half for the South team in the Ventura County All-Star basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Schwan spent the second half in a hospital emergency room after 
getting five stitches to seal a gash he sustained under his right eye in the 
second period of Friday night's game at Ventura High. 
</P>
<P>
Not exactly the way the 6-foot-9 center from Westlake High expected to end his 
high school career. 
</P>
<P>
"I will remember it for a long time," Schwan said. "It was the worst injury 
I've had playing basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Schwan's absence, the South closed to within two points of the North in 
the fourth quarter after trailing, 50-32, at halftime. The North outscored the 
South, 40-14, in the last 9:01 to clinch the 111-83 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Bass fishing at its best: Sand bass and calico bass are spawning near Ventura 
County waters and that's good news for the sportfishing industry. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura Landing, Port Hueneme Sportfishing and Oxnard Sportfishing are catching 
an average of four bass per passenger. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now is an excellent time for bass fishing, as good as you're going to 
see it," said Louie Abbott, owner and operator of Port Hueneme. It takes about 
three weeks for the waters to warm up and bingo -- the bass start biting like 
crazy up here."

'EXTENDED KINDERGARTEN' GIVES CHILDREN TIME TO DEVELOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIOK-HIAN TAY KELLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kathy Lariscy remembers her misgivings when her son's kindergarten teacher 
recommended placing him in a transitional class, rather than promoting him to 
first grade last year. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, she recalls his fidgeting at school, and the trouble he had 
coordinating his fingers for writing. 
</P>
<P>
"The main reason he was put into the class was that he was immature for his 
age," said Lariscy, who has taught in Monrovia for 20 years and will teach one 
of the transitional classes next year. "But I had to really think hard about 
it. I was afraid he'd be teased, I was concerned about his feelings. He'll be 
19 when he graduates (from high school)." 
</P>
<P>
She has since decided the extra year was worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
"I really believe now that if he'd gone ahead to first grade it would have 
squashed his spirit," she said of her son, now 7 1/2. "He would have constantly 
struggled or possibly been held back. It was just a matter of him growing up a 
little bit." 
</P>
<P>
Transitional First Grade, called T-1 for short, is a full-day program for 
children who teachers decide are not prepared, in terms of ability and 
maturity, to succeed in first grade. The program, described as extended 
kindergarten, involves a less rigid structure and less formal instruction than 
the first grade. 
</P>
<P>
Monrovia created T-1 with the idea of giving children "the gift of time" to 
develop physically, emotionally and intellectually for the academic rigors of 
first grade, said Richard Hill, district director of instructional services. 
</P>
<P>
A pilot program this year at Monroe Elementary School was so successful that 
125 students in the district's five schools will be enrolled in T-1 classes 
this fall. The Monrovia Unified School District expects to have 540 students in 
first grade next year. 
</P>
<P>
"Way down the road this is going to cut down the drop-out rate," said Hill. 
"It's not failure. We're exposing them to new concepts." 
</P>
<P>
The district is in the midst of redesigning its curricula for kindergarten 
through second grades at a time when the state Department of Education is 
examining education in the lower grades. 
</P>
<P>
A state task force released a report last year declaring that "too often 
children ages four through six are receiving inappropriate instruction" and 
recommended that schools try harder to accommodate the needs of students. 
</P>
<P>
An advisory the department sent to school districts this month noted that "in 
recent years . . . programs for young children have become increasingly 
academic and less appropriate developmentally." 
</P>
<P>
But state Department of Education officials would rather see districts 
accommodate the children within the existing grade structure, and they are 
concerned with the increasing popularity of transitional classes. 
</P>
<P>
"However you define it, it adds up to an additional year in school," said Susan 
Thompson, an administrator in the child development division. 
</P>
<P>
The department opposes holding children back from the first grade because "the 
changes that occur at ages 4 to 6 are so dramatic and rapid," she said, adding 
that another factor is possible damage to a child's self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
According to Carol Fox, elementary curriculum consultant with the county Office 
of Education, about a quarter of the 74 school districts with elementary 
schools in the county have similar transitional programs, including Azusa, Long 
Beach and Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to be working, but we're still evaluating," said Clinton Boutwell, 
assistant superintendent for educational services with the Azusa Unified School 
District. About 25% of first-grade age children receive the "gift of time" in 
the district, which formally launched its transitional classes two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Monrovia school board President Christine Goudy said transitional classes are 
designed to help children who develop at a slower pace. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that students who might drop out of school can be identified as 
early as second grade, she said, "How much better to identify them earlier." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Peterson, instructional aide in the pilot T-1 class who has worked with 
low-performing third-graders in the district, also praised the program for 
targeting the children early. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen older kids who were discouraged," she said. "It's so hard to work 
with 8-year-olds already down on themselves and convince them they're really 
OK." 
</P>
<P>
Hill agreed that "if kids are subjected to heavy academic work and they're not 
ready for it, it builds in frustration, failure, and their self-image is shot." 
</P>
<P>
Parents are consulted when assessing a child's "readiness" for promotion, and 
must consent to placing the child in a transitional class rather than the first 
grade. 
</P>
<P>
A district handbook on the program lists characteristics a typical child who 
should be placed in a transitional class might exhibit, including poor muscle 
control, emotional immaturity, short attention spans, difficulty communicating 
with words and frequent displays of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
Many are simply young. According to Monroe T-1 teacher Margie Kooiman, 
two-thirds of the 24 students in her pilot class have birthdays after June. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Social Skills 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Lindsey's daughter, now a T-1 student, was 4 years old when she started 
kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
"What is a year in reality," Lindsey said. "I was very concerned before because 
she was so quiet. If you asked her a question, she'd say yes or no. Now she's 
more sociable and talks and talks." 
</P>
<P>
Kooiman extended the kindergarten curriculum to make it "a really rich language 
and math experience. We simply go a little further than kindergarten," she 
said. Students memorize poems, sing from word charts and absorb mathematical 
concepts using graphs, cubes, dice and colored lima beans. 
</P>
<P>
"My kids will be able to catch on faster," she said, adding that instilling 
confidence in the youngsters is a key element in the program. "Most will be 
average- to high-(achieving) first-graders next year because we've taken the 
time to get the basics down much more solidly." 
</P>
<P>
The approach plays down workbook activities and rote-learning and stresses 
teaching through play and experiences. "This is hands-on, with lots of 
experimentation," Hill said. "We structure things in the classroom so that the 
kid, without realizing it, is learning. It's more of a discovery." 
</P>
<P>
Teachers will observe a kindergarten child's behavior throughout the year to 
decide whether he or she is ready for first grade, said Marilyn Jessup, the 
Monroe mentor teacher heading the district curriculum committee. 
</P>
<P>
"Most kindergarten teachers can pick out by the first semester children who 
won't make it in the first grade," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A standardized test to determine the developmental level of kindergartners will 
be given to confirm a teacher's conclusions toward the end of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
"If parents aren't for it, it's not going to work," she said. "They could go on 
to first grade, but they would be at the bottom of the heap."

OXNARD CITY GOLF CHAMPIONSHIPS SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fourth annual Oxnard City Golf Championships will be held July 8 and 9 at 
the River Ridge Golf Club in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
A field of over 150 have registered for the tournament, which is open to all 
amateur players with established handicaps. The deadline to sign up is Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"River Ridge is one of the most challenging courses in the area and it's not an 
easy score," club spokesman Chris Tormey said. Some top golfers are registered

Fernandez of Woodland Hills, who shot a tournament-record par 144 last year. 
</P>
<P>
Other championship flight golfers include Oxnard's Paul Stankowski, who attends 
the University of Texas-El Paso, and Strawberry Festival champion Doug Righter 
of Ojai. 
</P>

<P>
Summer fishing is hot. The transition from spring to summer surface fishing is 
bending rods and busting tackle. 
</P>
<P>
Sand bass continue to set the angling pace. Joining the limit catches of 
sandies, calico bass now have started biting anything in their path resembling 
food. 
</P>
<P>
The hot spots on day and twilight trips are Horseshoe Kelp and Rocky Point. 
Fishing at Catalina Island with live squid brings a wide-open bite.

U.S. LABELS BOSCH A TERRORIST; 
</P>
<P>
PLAN TO DEPORT CASTRO FOE ANGERS CUBANS IN MIAMI

Will there be no refuge here for the old Cuban terrorist -- his gray hair 
rumpled across a weary face, his 62-year-old body fighting its own battles with 
angina and ulcers and a bad prostate? 
</P>
<P>
What he wants now, Dr. Orlando Bosch says, is to remain with his wife and six 
children in Miami and continue la lucha -- the struggle against Fidel Castro -- 
this time in a legal and certainly more peaceful way. 
</P>
<P>
But last Friday the U.S. Justice Department ruled that Bosch, imprisoned here 
and in Venezuela for 16 of the past 21 years, should be denied political asylum 
and deported, exiled from the capital of el exilio itself. 
</P>
<P>
Since he fled to America in 1960, he has been "resolute and unwavering in his 
advocacy of terrorist violence . . . " said Joe D. Whitley, acting associate 
attorney general. "We must look at terrorism as a universal evil, even if it is 
directed toward those with whom we have no political sympathy." 
</P>
<P>
In the Miami area, where about 577,000 people are of Cuban birth or descent, 
the decision has been met with surprise and, in some quarters, outrage. It is 
as if a Don Quixote was being plucked from their midst -- one of the great 
icons in the courageous, if so far futile, effort to tilt the windmill Castro. 
</P>
<P>
"This man symbolizes our resistance, the ideal that each of us must fight to 
free Cuba with whatever means are available," said prominent Miami attorney 
Rafael Penalver. "Castro wants Bosch dead at any price, and now the United 
States seems to be offering him up." 
</P>
<P>
With that harrowing prospect in mind, local Republican leaders -- stuck with a 
back yard mess of the Bush Administration's making -- have pledged to send a 
delegation to see the President. And to remind him: Wealthy Cubans have always 
been an easy tap for his campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of protesters have marched downtown. Bosch's diabetic son, Willie, 32, 
has gone on a hunger strike -- and was rushed to a hospital Tuesday morning 
just after he met with Jeb Bush, the President's son. A nationwide three-hour 
shutdown of Cuban businesses has been called for this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Bosch is not a threat to the U.S.; all that he has done, he has done to 
defend democracy!" insisted taxi driver Blanco Avelino, in a comment typical 
among Cubans here, especially the older ones. 
</P>
<P>
To understand the importance of Bosch in Miami is to recall 30 regretful years 
of anti-Castroism -- and to examine the great unhealed wound of exile. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Former CIA Support 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, many Cuban refugees -- whether doctor, salesman or busboy -- 
saw themselves as part-time commandos. With CIA support, they carried out 
hit-and-run attacks against the island, tossing grenades and smuggling guns. 
</P>
<P>
But there were embarrassing failures, and the White House lost interest in its 
Cuban militia, stopped paying the bills and confiscated the boats. 
</P>
<P>
Freedom-loving commandos suddenly became law-breaking terrorists -- and most of 
them resignedly gave up their second identities as saboteurs to root their 
lives in America. Most of them -- but not all. 
</P>
<P>
Among the staunch holdouts was Bosch, an unlikely looking warrior, a baby 
doctor with thick glasses and a bad stomach. He was all at once heroic and 
hapless, the macho schemer and the bungling fool. 
</P>
<P>
The one and only Bosch: fired from a hospital for storing explosives on the 
premises, stopped by police as he drove around with a trunk full of dynamite, 
arrested for towing a homemade torpedo through downtown at rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fired Bazooka at Freighter 
</P>
<P>
In 1968, he shot off a jerry-built bazooka from an expressway median strip, 
aiming at a Polish freighter in the Miami harbor. The shell harmlessly nicked 
the ship's thick metal hull, but the deed was enough to get Bosch a 10-year 
term in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
After four years, he was paroled. He might then have returned to home and 
career, becoming, like so many others here, an elder statesman of the commando 
days. Venerated. Looked out for. A welcome guest on Cuban talk radio. 
</P>
<P>
But that was not for Bosch. In 1974, he fled America rather than face a 
subpoena in a murder case. He wandered in Latin America, a conspirator in who 
knows what, his handiwork showing up in half a dozen countries. 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, he was arrested in Venezuela and charged with masterminding the 
bombing of a Cuban jetliner, in which 73 people died. He was acquitted of the 
crime three times, but never released. 
</P>
<P>
In Miami, the jailed Bosch was a popular cause. City commissioners read his 
revered name into the minutes. Mass was said in his honor. When he went on a 
hunger strike, 20 here joined him. 
</P>
<P>
When will Bosch be freed, people demanded to know. Then, finally, in late 1987, 
the prison doors opened. And a few months later, the old doctor arrived at 
Miami International Airport, a long-gone parole violator with no visa. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, he has been held in a prison near Miami while U.S. immigration and 
Justice Department officials shooed his case from desk to desk. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Whitley ruled. He cited previously secret FBI and CIA files that 
implicate the pediatrician in a number of assassinations and bombings. 
</P>
<P>
"The conclusion is inescapable that it would be prejudicial to the public 
interest of the United States to provide a safe haven for Bosch," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, Bosch's lawyers obtained a pledge from federal authorities to not 
deport him until July 14 at the earliest. Even if Bosh is ordered to leave, the 
government must find a country willing to accept him. That may not be so easy. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the latest news skips through the streets. Bosch represents la 
lucha, not terrorism, to shopkeeper Felix Baez, who will be among those closing 
up today. "A lot of people are like me," he said. "We haven't done anything for 
many years . . . . Now we will get involved." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conjecture on Airwaves 
</P>
<P>
Cuban radio, purveyor of rumor and opinion as much as facts, is alive with 
conjecture about plots and deals. To commentators and others, sinister hands 
must be behind the Justice Department's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Is the White House wooing Castro toward diplomatic relations? Or is this just 
further evidence of Fidel's long tentacles reaching even into the Washington 
bureaucracy? 
</P>
<P>
"I think Fidel Castro's agents are really responsible for loading up the Bosch 
file with information . . . ," said Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, an early favorite in a 
special congressional election to succeed the late Claude Pepper. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, despite all this hubbub, it would be wrong to assume that every Cuban here 
would welcome back Bosch. So much has changed in 30 years. There are fewer all 
the time who dream of Havana nights or the royal palms of Miramar. 
</P>
<P>
To an ever-larger minority, the commandos seem like relics, obsolete armor in a 
war fought and lost. Besides, America is no place for counterrevolution. "If 
they let one terrorist go, they have to let 50 go," said disco owner Jose 
Teran. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Not Responsive 
</P>
<P>
To this younger generation, the voice of Bosch is like the scratchy music of an 
old rumba record, his latest message from prison sounding formal and dated: 
</P>
<P>
"I have directed and participated -- inside Cuba and out -- in numerous heroic 
actions against Castroism, in desperate efforts to contribute to the freedom of 
my country . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Our actions have always had as a goal to bring a just end to our noble 
purposes. We have never acted indiscriminately like the Eastern fanatics and 
American Marxists . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We Cubans have always denounced violence . . . . But we have a right to 
belligerence . . . . We knew we did not kill the beast, but neither did we let 
it sleep in peace." 
</P>

PANEL CUTS $800 MILLION IN STEALTH BOMBER FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The House Armed Services Committee Wednesday scrambled the Bush 
Administration's proposed $300-billion defense budget for next year, restoring 
programs slated for cancellation by the Pentagon and slicing $800 million from 
the B-2 stealth bomber production program. 
</P>
<P>
In doing so, it defied both its chairman, Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), and Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney. 
</P>
<P>
After a long session marked by haggling among committee members, Aspin proposed 
undoing the day's work in what some lawmakers called a "King of the Hill" 
amendment. Aspin asked that the committee adopt the Pentagon's proposed 
$69-billion arms production budget request as it had been submitted to 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
However, his amendment was rejected in a dramatic 26-26 vote, handing both 
Aspin and Cheney a major defeat. Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.) and Rep. 
Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley) passed during the roll call on the amendment but 
then cast "no" votes that resulted in the tie and the amendment's defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers repeatedly cut into the Air Force's controversial stealth bomber 
program in an effort to increase spending for other projects without increasing 
the $300-billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. G. V. (Sonny) Montgomery (D-Miss.), in a successful effort to increase 
purchasing funds for the National Guard and reserves, offered a provision that 
would take $500 million from the stealth bomber's $2.7-billion production 
budget. The panel voted also to direct the Air Force to shift $300 million in 
B-2 production funds into the aircraft's research and development budget. 
</P>
<P>
The aircraft's R&amp;D fund would remain at the level initially requested by 
the Air Force, however, because the committee had taken $300 million from the 
bomber's development Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by the full House and adopted by the Senate, the stealth cutbacks 
would force Northrop Corp., which is building the aircraft, to scale back its 
planned production of three airplanes in 1990. It might also force the company 
to reduce its advance purchases of parts and equipment for the bomber. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Test Flights 
</P>
<P>
In defending their votes to take production funds from the stealth bomber, 
several lawmakers have argued that it would be premature to begin high rates of 
production for the aircraft, which has not yet made its first flight. The 
plane's flight tests have been delayed repeatedly because of technical 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
The bomber's price, now expected to soar well over $500 million apiece, also 
has stirred concern on Capitol Hill. But defenders of the program argue that 
the craft will bring revolutionary capabilities to the nation's bomber force 
and warn that efforts to slow the program will only increase its final cost. 
</P>
<P>
The B-2 is designed to penetrate Soviet airspace to hunt down and destroy the 
Soviets' mobile missiles and the command bunkers into which Soviet leaders 
would retreat in periods of international crisis. Its "flying-wing" design and 
special coatings would allow the craft to elude Soviet radar while it streaks 
over the Soviet homeland. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
B-1 Bomber Troubled 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force fears that, without the stealth bomber, it will lose its ability 
to threaten such targets after the mid- to late 1990s. The troubles plaguing 
the B-1 bomber, which critics believe would have problems penetrating Soviet 
airspace, have added urgency to the development of the stealth bomber. 
</P>
<P>
The bill approved by the committee, which is expected to come to the House 
floor after members return from their Fourth of July recess, gives new life to 
two programs that Cheney had proposed to terminate in a recent budget-cutting 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
The committee bill would restore funds for the development of a unique 
tilt-rotor aircraft called the V-22 Osprey and for the continued production of 
the Navy's F-14D fighter aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would also transfer $1.2 billion from a wide range of Army and Air 
Force programs -- including the B-2 bomber -- into equipment purchases for the 
Guard and reserves. 
</P>
<P>
In a 45-5 vote, the Democrat-controlled panel gave final approval to earlier 
action cutting $1.1 billion from the Bush Administration's $4.9-billion "Star 
Wars" request. But the panel rejected an amendment that would have denied the 
Administration its requests to begin production of a new rail-basing plan for 
the 10-warhead MX missile and to accelerate development of the small mobile 
missile widely known as Midgetman. 
</P>
<P>
Members warned that they would seek a further cut of $700 million in the "Star 
Wars" research budget when the bill reaches the House floor. Lawmakers have 
proposed using the additional savings to fund cleanup of the Energy 
Department's troubled nuclear weapons complex, to fight drug smuggling and to 
strengthen non-nuclear military forces. 
</P>
<P>
The full House is expected to act on the bill during the week of July 23. 
Members said that they would pose further challenges then to the 
Administration's proposed nuclear missile programs, as well as to the B-2 
bomber. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the end of the war, but it will be difficult for the House to change 
things, since this is the committee bill," said Rep. Curt Weldon (R-Pa.), who 
spearheaded efforts to restore funds for the V-22 and the F-14D aircraft.

ECONOMIC INDEX DECLINE RENEWS RECESSION FEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A widely watched barometer of future economic activity tumbled 1.2% in May, the 
Commerce Department reported Wednesday, reinforcing other warning signals of a 
rapidly slowing economy and renewing fears of impending recession. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third drop in four months for the index of leading economic 
indicators and the largest monthly decline since November, 1987, immediately 
after the stock market crash. 
</P>
<P>
Although economists regard the index as an imperfect predictor of the economy's 
course, they observed that the May index reflected slowdowns in nine of the 11 
areas of economic activity that it measures. 
</P>
<P>
"The number was big and the decline was broad-based, and that's disturbing," 
said David Wyss of Data Resources Inc., in Lexington, Mass., an economic 
forecasting firm that predicts the economy will slow to no growth at all by the 
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"There wasn't just one major source of weakness; everything was soft," Wyss 
said. "It was a good picture of the economy, and it shows that May was a rotten 
month." 
</P>
<P>
Financial markets evidently saw in the report a harbinger of shrinking 
corporate profits. Interest rates rose, and the Dow Jones industrial average 
lost 21.63 points to 2504.74. 
</P>
<P>
"The message is that the weakness is broad-based," said Bruce Steinberg, an 
economist with the New York brokerage house of Merrill Lynch, which projects a 
brief and relatively mild recession beginning late in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg noted that the index reached a peak in January and has been declining 
gradually since. In the 44 years since World War II, Steinberg added, the 
average lag between a peak in the leading indicators and the ensuing recession 
has been nine months. 
</P>
<P>
But recessions have not always followed. The index, propelled downward by the 
stock market crash, declined for five consecutive months at the end of 1987, 
but the economy confounded most predictions and rebounded strongly in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The White House declared itself unconcerned by the leading indicators. "The 
economy is healthy and growing at a slower pace, which means less pressure on 
inflation and interest rates," said spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. "We still think 
that the economy is in very good shape." 
</P>
<P>
Like the index of leading indicators, other signals of economic activity 
recently have pointed downward. In two reports last Friday, the Commerce 
Department announced a 4.2% decline in factory orders for durable goods in May 
and a 0.3% decline in inflation-adjusted personal spending. Job growth in May 
declined to its lowest rate in three years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fed Seen as Key 
</P>
<P>
Many economists believe that the Federal Reserve holds the key to whether the 
economy is slipping into recession. Richard W. Rahn, chief economist at the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, warned that a recession would surely follow if the 
Federal Reserve did not soon relax its still-tight grip on the money supply and 
allow interest rates to decline further. 
</P>
<P>
The 0.3% decline in the money supply in May contributed substantially to the 
steep drop reported Wednesday in the index of leading economic indicators. Of 
the 11 indicators measured by the index, the only positives were contributed by 
the still-resurgent stock market and an uptick in building permits. 
</P>
<P>
The hint that housing construction might be on the verge of recovery provided 
one hopeful sign that the current period of economic growth, in its seventh 
year and approaching the post-World War II record, might not be on the verge of 
ending. 
</P>
<P>
"The cycles are not in sync," noted DRI's Wyss. "We now should be past the 
trough in housing, and exports should stay strong even while domestic 
consumption falls off." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Predicts Recession 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Allen Sinai of The Boston Co. Economic Advisers sees an actual 
recession, not just the slowdown forecast by DRI. He warned that "the economy 
could be sliding faster than we think." But Sinai also expects the service 
sector, which now contributes about two-thirds of the gross national product, 
to remain relatively stable, insulating the economy from a steep recession. 
</P>
<P>
"Consumer spending has been flat and housing is in recession now and the main 
props are capital spending and exports," Sinai said. "If one or both of those 
fade, it's hard to see how the economy can stay afloat. But because services 
count for so much, they have to fade also for us to have the standard postwar 
12-month recession." 
</P>
<P>
The factors that contributed to the decline in the index of leading indicators, 
other than the decline in the money supply, were a drop in consumer confidence, 
a decline in prices of key industrial materials, a speedup in supply deliveries 
to manufacturers, a decline in the average workweek, a slowdown in orders for 
consumer goods, a decline in manufacturers' unfilled orders for durable goods, 
a slowdown in contracts for new plant and equipment and an uptick in 
unemployment claims.

The Navy may reduce the number of warships patrolling the Indian Ocean but it 
will not withdraw all of its naval forces from the region, the Defense 
Department said. "There is no change in our commitment in the Indian Ocean. We 
will continue to have a presence in the region," the Pentagon said, responding 
to a story by the Hearst News Service, which quoted an unidentified 
Administration source as saying the United States has decided to withdraw its

YOUNG AMERICAN FLIER DRAWS HUNDREDS OF CURIOUS IN RED SQUARE

Tony Aliengena of San Juan Capistrano upstaged Lenin's tomb on Wednesday, 
drawing hundreds of Soviets out of line as he and his family unfurled a 
1,000-foot scroll in the middle of Red Square. 
</P>
<P>
The event climaxed a day in which the 11-year-old aviator and his family met 
with top Soviet officials in the Kremlin. They presented the scroll and a 
sackful of 75,000 pen-pal letters as good-will gestures from children in the 
United States to children in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The show of support softened the disappointment the Aliengenas experienced in 
not being able to meet with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who was 
reported to be presiding over the Supreme Soviet. 
</P>
<P>
The scroll, signed by more than 250,000 U.S. school children, originally was to 
be unfurled today, but buoyed by the praise of Soviet officials in the Kremlin 
meeting, Tony's father, Gary Aliengena, decided that it should be unveiled 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
So the Aliengena delegation, flanked by a dozen others, marched into Red 
Square, set up the scroll on a stand and unfurled it slowly as bystanders -- 
including hundreds in line to view Lenin's tomb -- gazed in apparent 
puzzlement. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, while struggling to hold the scroll against gusts of wind, Gary 
Aliengena frantically called out to bystanders to help. First a few people 
knelt to help hold the scroll, then more pitched in. Finally, hundreds had 
gathered to either help with the unfurling or to watch the event. 
</P>
<P>
Gennady Alferenko, director of the Soviet Foundation for Social Inventions, the 
non-government agency sponsoring Tony's trip through the country, appeared 
moved by the event. "Unbelievable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The public display lasted 20 minutes. Alferenko explained that Red Square 
security officials had instructed that the scroll be rolled back up within that 
time. 
</P>
<P>
The man in charge of Soviet youth affairs and three other officials formally 
received Tony, his family and selected members of his entourage in a lavishly 
appointed Kremlin reception room used by the Soviet president to meet foreign 
dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting with Valery Tsybukh, president of Gorbachev's Parliamentary 
Committee for Youth, lasted 40 minutes and included good will speeches and an 
exchange of gifts by both the Soviets and the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Tony is collecting the signatures of Soviet children on a second scroll, which 
he hopes to present to President Bush at the conclusion of his around-the-world 
flight. He and his entourage are expected to leave Moscow on Friday for the 
Soviet Far East.

A California congressman disclosed Wednesday that the Interior Department 
failed to assess any civil penalties against the oil industry for six years 
despite finding thousands of separate safety violations aboard offshore oil 
rigs in that period. 
</P>
<P>
The 16,000 infractions -- more than 1,300 of them on rigs off the California 
coast -- ranged from relatively minor incidents of housekeeping violations to 
more severe cases of blowouts, oil spills and malfunctioning pollution-control 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
None of the companies responsible have been punished with civil fines since 
mid-1983, when a Louisiana federal court limited the government's enforcement 
powers and the Interior Department chose not to appeal the court's ruling. 
Since then, instead of assessing penalties, investigators occasionally have 
shut down drilling operations until problems are corrected, Interior officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The new attention to government enforcement efforts provided another focus for 
a rapidly widening dispute between California legislators and the Interior 
Department over offshore drilling. Emotions have worn raw in recent days as the 
House moved toward consideration of a sweeping drilling moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez), who made the Interior Department record on 
civil penalties public, accused the agency of "scrupulous indifference" to the 
hazards of drilling. The failure of the Ronald Reagan and Bush administrations 
to restore the government's power to fine violators, he charged, had allowed 
the oil industry to act "with impunity." 
</P>
<P>
But Interior officials contended that the department sought only to operate 
within the law, and charged that the congressman had confused the issue in an 
attempt to torpedo offshore oil development. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to persuade the American public that offshore drilling is safe and 
environmentally sound," department spokesman Steve Goldstein said. "And we 
can't do that if people think the law is laxly enforced." 
</P>
<P>
The data provided to Miller by the Interior Department listed annual totals of 
inspections conducted by the Minerals Management Service, and the number of 
violations found. It did not specify the nature of individual infractions, nor 
say where each had occurred. But the statistics presented a picture of an 
offshore oil system rife with violations of federal law. Three out of 10 visits 
by inspectors to oil rigs in the last four years resulted in discoveries of 
infractions, they said. In 1988, officials found 3,987 "incidents of 
non-compliance" in 10,604 visits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Figure Dismissed 
</P>
<P>
MMS Director Barry Williamson, noting that each visit included inspection of as 
many as 150 separate components, dismissed that figure as misleading. In fact, 
he said, the oil industry had been found to be in compliance with federal 
drilling laws more than 99% of the time during 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make sure we maintain that impeccable and pollution-free 
environment," he said. "The American people have a decision to make: Do we want 
foreign oil from foreign tankers or do they think we can do a better job at 
home?" 
</P>
<P>
In a 40-month period ending in May, 1983, the Interior Department levied 32 
civil fines ranging from $1,000 to $173,000 against oil companies to punish 
their violations of federal drilling laws. That pattern was interrupted by the 
Louisiana federal court, which overturned the department's regulations on 
grounds that they gave offenders insufficient time to take corrective action. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They Are Not Serious' 
</P>
<P>
Interior never appealed that decision or sought to issue new regulations. 
Because of that inaction, Miller on Monday accused both the Reagan and Bush 
administrations of making clear that "they are not serious about enforcement of 
environmental laws covering the oil industry." 
</P>
<P>
"The industry was overjoyed by this decision," Miller said, "and the Interior 
Department simply chose to do nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Interior officials, however, noted that new Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. has 
ordered them to draw up new regulations to restore the power to levy penalties. 
And they contended that the department's power to shut down oil rigs -- at a 
cost to companies of more than $100,000 a day -- was itself a sufficient 
deterrent to lawbreaking. 
</P>
<P>
"The strongest disincentive we have is the economic hammer to shut down these 
rigs," Williamson said. 
</P>
<P>
While failing to issue any civil penalties against oil companies in the last 
six years, the Interior Department won a $750,000 criminal fine against Texaco 
last November after the company was convicted of deliberately falsifying 
records of equipment tests on a platform off Santa Barbara. A separate 
crackdown resulted in a $5-million settlement this month from Tenneco, which 
had been accused of illegally flaring natural gas.

ASSEMBLY OKS BUDGET; SOME ISSUES STILL UNRESOLVED

<P>
With Gov. George Deukmejian and legislative leaders still negotiating a 
long-term agreement on transportation and other spending issues, the Assembly 
on Wednesday passed a $49.4-billion budget to get the state through the next 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The budget was sent to the Senate on a surprising 66-3 vote. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly-approved budget would increase spending by 9.8%. It is guaranteed 
to invite numerous line-item vetoes from Deukmejian because appropriations run 
about $1 billion more than the governor has said the state can afford to spend. 
</P>
<P>
Overshadowing passage of the budget are the talks between Deukmejian and 
leaders of the Assembly and Senate. The officeholders met privately again in 
the governor's office and afterward said they were closer to agreement, but 
still had several differences to work out. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), one of the participants, said, 
"We are all optimistic, including the governor." 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the negotiators are trying to work out a deal that will 
allow them to give health, welfare and other state programs a larger portion of 
the $2.5 billion in new tax revenues expected this year and next. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian and legislative leaders want to ease the limit on government 
spending approved by voters in 1979 and repeal provisions of Proposition 98, 
the school funding initiative approved last year, that require the bulk of 
state surpluses to go to public schools and community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
If they fail to reach agreement and pass a bill by Friday midnight -- the end 
of the current fiscal year -- lawmakers are required by the state Constitution 
to distribute roughly $1.1 billion of the windfall to schools and taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly's passage of the budget came after Democratic and Republican 
negotiators reached agreement on a two-year, $1.35-billion public school 
spending plan financed by a portion of the windfall tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
With the agreement, Republicans salvaged the favorable deal they had worked out 
earlier this month that calls for a substantial amount of the new tax revenues 
to be distributed to rural and suburban school districts. Under the agreement, 
schools statewide would receive an additional $406.5 million this year and 
another $953 million next year, over and above normal state funding. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement would give schools a flat 4.6% increase -- the governor had 
recommended 3.2% -- that will be dispersed to school districts on a per-pupil 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, it would provide $250 million to increase state funding for 
suburban and rural school districts. Republicans had originally sought $300 
million, but agreed to the smaller amount to appease urban Democrats from Los 
Angeles and other big cities. The Democrats complained that money for the rural 
and suburban districts would come from allotments that normally would go to 
urban districts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Good Agreement' 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), one of the negotiators who worked out the 
agreement late Tuesday, said, "This is a good bipartisan agreement. It 
addresses the needs of suburban districts that a lot of Republicans were 
concerned about, but it does it in a way that does not screw urban school 
districts." 
</P>
<P>
The compromise will be amended into legislation carried by Hart and Assemblyman 
Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria). 
</P>
<P>
During the Assembly debate on the budget, Assemblyman Patrick Nolan 
(R-Glendale) said, "This budget and the compromise that will be voted on later 
finally address the issue of equal dollars being spent on kids. This is a major 
step forward for this Legislature." 
</P>
<P>
With the education funding issue out of the way, the 1989-90 spending plan was 
passed with none of the fractious debate that usually accompanies passage of 
the budget. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the extra spending that would be authorized by the Assembly-approved 
budget would be in health and welfare programs. 
</P>
<P>
The budget would add $68 million in spending on AIDS treatment, testing and 
counseling programs. It also would restore $36.2 million to save the state 
Office of Family Planning, which Deukmejian would like to eliminate. 
</P>
<P>
The budget contains a reserve fund of $870 million, substantially less than the 
$1.2 billion the governor has requested. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Brett, the governor's press spokesman, said vetoes are likely. "The 
governor is absolutely convinced that in the wake of the substantial revenue 
fluctuations of the last three years that we need a substantial budget 
reserve." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, tax revenues were off by about $1 billion, necessitating a series of 
extraordinary budget reductions.

EFFORTS TO GET CEASE-FIRE IN LOGGING BATTLE BREAK DOWN

Efforts by Oregon legislators to set up a temporary cease-fire in the 
controversy over cutting old-growth timber collapsed Wednesday when both sides 
said they could not reach an agreement in time to pass the necessary 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
However, environmentalists and Oregon's congressional delegation continued to 
offer hope that some accommodation might yet be developed in time for them to 
add it to legislation to accompany the federal budget for the fiscal year 
starting in October. 
</P>
<P>
California's congressional delegation also joined the old-growth fight, but on 
the side of less logging. All but two people in the 45-member delegation have 
signed a letter pleading for an immediate moratorium on the logging of virgin 
coastal redwood forests. 
</P>
<P>
For now, however, the future of the nation's dwindling old-growth forests is 
left with the federal courts, which have issued injunctions restricting logging 
on large tracts in Oregon, California and Washington, the top timber states. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deal Called Dead 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, the deal we offered on Saturday is dead," said Lee Weinstein, a 
spokesman for Oregon Gov. Neil Goldschmidt. 
</P>
<P>
The governor, along with the state's seven-member congressional delegation, 
last Saturday had developed a short-term compromise in a bitter battle between 
environmentalists and loggers over how best to manage the virgin timberland of 
the Pacific Northwest. In order to make saw logs available to mills, 
environmentalists were being asked to withdraw their successful lawsuits and 
timber industry groups were being asked to significantly improve their logging 
methods. 
</P>
<P>
Industry leaders accepted the proposal by the original Tuesday deadline but 
environmentalists balked at several points, especially at a provision 
prohibiting them from appealing or suing on any of the timber sales included in 
the compromise. 
</P>
<P>
A House of Representatives appropriations subcommittee meeting was postponed a 
day to give negotiators more time to find some middle ground, but by day's end 
Wednesday an agreement had not been made. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody still is going to search for a short-term solution, but nobody is 
able to say what that short-term solution might look like," said Gregg Kantor, 
a Goldschmidt aide. 
</P>
<P>
"Is the deal dead? I don't know, to be honest," said Rachel Gorlin, a member of 
the staff of Rep. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.). "They (environmentalists) have been 
making positive mumblings, but we missed the deadline to go into (the 1990 
budget)." 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 fiscal year budgets for the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land 
Management are being prepared this week by the House. Short deadlines were set 
to reach a compromise so that it could be included in the budget. 
</P>
<P>
Sydney J. Butler of the Wilderness Society in Washington -- echoing remarks 
made by U.S. Sen. Mark O. Hatfield in a speech in Grants Pass, Ore. -- said the 
deal offered Saturday still can serve as a framework for some future agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Any such agreement would have to be added to the budget in the Senate, then go 
back to the House for concurrence -- a process that one Senate staff member 
said will significantly reduce its chance of passage. 
</P>
<P>
"We're taking this compromise very, very seriously," Butler said. "But we could 
not work out all of the details in the short time available. We have agreed in 
concept, but we couldn't agree in detail." 
</P>
<P>
However, there appears to be substantial difference in concept and detail. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a key element of the congressional compromise is a prohibition 
against legal action by environmentalists for the life of the agreement, which 
would run through September, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Industry leaders insist on this provision, which they say is needed to help 
them plan budgets, hire workers and obtain bank loans for operating capital. 
But environmentalists seem unwilling to accept such a restriction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Bad Precedent' 
</P>
<P>
"When you get into waiving judicial review, you're setting all kinds of bad 
precedent," Butler said Wednesday, after talks broke down. "If you can't sue on 
a sale that violates the Clean Air Act or the Clean Water Act, you have 
essentially amended those very important laws." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike their Oregon colleagues, California legislators are seeking stricter 
enforcement of environmental laws. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter circulated by Rep. Pete Stark (D-Oakland) and Rep. Tom Lantos 
(D-San Mateo), 43 members of the California's House delegation asked the state 
Board of Forestry to immediately cease the cutting of all private stands of 
virgin coastal redwoods. 
</P>
<P>
The plea was aimed directly at the Pacific Lumber Co. of Scotia, Calif., which 
owns 70% of the estimated 20,000 acres of old-growth redwoods not already 
protected in state or federal parks. Palco, as the firm is known, recently was 
bought by Maxxam Corp. of Los Angeles in a leveraged buyout, or LBO. 
</P>
<P>
"Congressman Stark and Congressman Lantos were just frustrated at watching in 
effect the slaughtering of redwoods to pay the huge debt of an LBO," said Perry 
Plumart, a spokesman for Stark. "They (Maxxam) are so starved for cash they are 
not even waiting to mill many of the logs themselves; they're selling raw logs 
directly to the export market to Japan as fast as they can cut them."

COURT SAYS U.S. HAS FINAL POWER OVER GUARDSMEN

The federal government, not state governors, has the final authority over the 
deployment of National Guard troops outside the United States, an appeals court 
ruled Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. 8th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld an amendment that prohibits 
governors from withholding consent to send troops outside the country because 
of objections to the location, purpose, type or schedule of active duty. 
</P>
<P>
"We hold that the Constitution does not require gubernatorial consent to active 
duty for training of the National Guard of the United States," the court said 
in its 7-2 opinion. 
</P>
<P>
The original lawsuit was filed on behalf of Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich by 
Hubert H. Humphrey III, the state's attorney general. Minnesota was joined in 
the suit by the states of Colorado, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, Ohio and 
Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
Opposing them was the Defense Department, which was joined as friends of the 
court by the National Guard Assn. of the United States and the states of 
Alabama, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi and 
Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985 and 1986, several governors objected to deployment of National Guard 
personnel to Central America. The governors withheld or threatened to withhold 
their consent to federally ordered active duty missions by their states' 
National Guard units. 
</P>
<P>
In response, Congress enacted the Montgomery Amendment, which prohibits the 
governors from withholding consent.

Prime Minister Sosuke Uno, chosen by the governing party as a "Mr. Clean" to 
rescue it from scandal, was kept busy Wednesday denying he might resign because 
of allegations about his sexual conduct. 
</P>
<P>
In exchanges with reporters throughout the day, Uno repeatedly denied reports 
that, in meetings late Tuesday, leaders of his Liberal Democratic Party had to 
persuade him not to resign over allegations he kept paid mistresses. 
</P>
<P>
As Uno was denying reports he planned to resign, an employee at the prime 
minister's residence and a party aide told reporters that Uno was put to bed 
Tuesday night by senior party members staying there to discuss the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he might have had a nervous breakdown last night," the aide said. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing is he freaked out over how he's going to appear overseas at 
the (Paris) summit next month," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's afraid those leaders won't even want to shake hands with him." 
</P>
<P>
Uno is scheduled to attend a summit of the world's seven top industrialized 
nations in the French capital. 
</P>
<P>
Uno said Wednesday, "I'm not such an irresponsible person" as to resign before 
making political reforms he promised on taking office June 2. He told lawmakers 
and businessmen at a trade meeting that he will attend the summit. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Uno's denials, stock prices in Tokyo plunged Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Reports about Uno's alleged "woman problem" have increased in the past week. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsuko Nakanishi, a former geisha, said on television Sunday that the prime 
minister, who is married, paid her to be his mistress in 1985. The same 
allegation had appeared in a national magazine, without naming Nakanishi. 
</P>
<P>
Two weekly magazines said later that Uno had kept two other mistresses. 
</P>
<P>
One reported that a former geisha known professionally as Hatsuko said she was 
paid 100,000 yen ($700) a month for 10 years until 1985. The other quoted his 
former secretary as saying that, from 1962 to 1972, Uno paid an unknown sum to 
a Ginza bar hostess identified only as Ms. Y, who became pregnant and had an 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
In Parliament earlier this week, Uno would not answer questions about the 
alleged affair.

U.S. ENVOY SLAIN IN GRENADA RAMPAGE

ST. GEORGES, Grenada

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A high-ranking police official went on a shooting rampage at police 
headquarters here Wednesday morning, killing Grenada's acting commissioner and 
a U.S. diplomat from Southern California and wounding two high-ranking officers 
before he was killed by police. 
</P>
<P>
State Department officials in Washington said the slain diplomat, John Angelo 
Butler, 33, was killed while trying to subdue the gunman, identified as Grafton 
Bascombe. Butler was the political officer at the U.S. Embassy in St. George's, 
the capital of this Caribbean island nation. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Grenada said the target of the attack appeared to be Grenada's 
acting police commissioner, Cosmus Raymond, but that the motive was unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Searles, the acting police superintendent, and Collis Barrow, the deputy 
police commissioner, were wounded but listed in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Bascombe was a police officer from the island of St. Vincent who 
had been on loan to the Grenadian police force. 
</P>
<P>
According to Grenada officials, Bascombe had recently been questioned about 
alleged financial improprieties, but it was not clear if the shooting was 
linked to the interrogation. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Bascombe fled to a nearby building after the shooting but was 
killed after a struggle. The circumstances of his death were not clear. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Xavier, an adviser to Grenada's Prime Minister Herbert Blaize, said 
Bascombe's return to St. Vincent was delayed because he was in charge of funds 
made available for joint military exercises with the United States and was to 
have given an accounting to Raymond on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Xavier said Bascombe entered Raymond's office and fired two shots from a 
.45-caliber revolver, hitting the commissioner in the head and stomach and 
killing him. 
</P>
<P>
Bascombe then walked into Barrow's office next door, where U.S. Embassy and 
police officials were meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"Butler made a move to subdue the assailant, who then shot Mr. Butler 
point-blank before fleeing the room. Mr. Butler apparently was killed 
instantly," Harter said. 
</P>
<P>
Butler was assigned to Grenada as political officer in the summer of 1988. He 
joined the Foreign Service in 1980 and previously served in the Dominican 
Republic and Costa Rica, Harter said. A native of Twentynine Palms, Butler was 
a graduate of the University of San Diego and held a graduate degree from San 
Diego State. He leaves his wife and a stepchild, both of whom are in Grenada.

The Sri Lankan government announced Wednesday that it has reached agreement 
with the most powerful Tamil guerrilla group to end all hostilities, the first 
such accord in six years of civil war. 
</P>
<P>
The government said that Anton Balasingham, the leader of the rebel Liberation 
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, who has been negotiating with authorities, agreed to 
convert an eight-week-old truce into a permanent end to hostilities. 
</P>
<P>
"The government will end all hostilities against the (Liberation Tigers) in the 
future," said a government statement quoting Cabinet minister Shahul Hameed, 
who negotiated the accord with Balasingham. 
</P>
<P>
"From now on they will not fight us," a senior government source said. 
"Earlier, we had agreed not to fight each other for the limited purpose of 
holding talks. Now they will not oppose us permanently." 
</P>
<P>
The two sides will resolve Tamil demands for an independent nation and other 
differences through negotiations, government officials said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first such accord reported since rebels from the minority Hindu 
Tamil community began a violent campaign in 1983 for independence for the 
Tamil-dominated north and east of the Indian Ocean island nation, where 
Sinhalese Buddhists are in the majority. 
</P>
<P>
The government still is fighting an insurgency by Sinhalese angered by the 
presence of Indian peacekeeping troops and by government concessions to the 
Tamils.

HE'S TRYING TO NURTURE DEMOCRACY, S. KOREAN LEADER SAYS

South Korean President Roh Tae Woo said Wednesday that he has intentionally 
refused to "impose democracy from the top" and will continue to refrain from 
exercising "public power" to solve the country's mounting problems. 
</P>
<P>
Democracy, he said, "is not something that can be forced upon the people" but 
must develop "through self-regulation and self-help" by people in all sectors 
of society. 
</P>
<P>
Roh also spoke out against demands by some U.S. members of Congress that 
American forces stationed in South Korea be reduced, saying the troops have 
helped to maintain peace and stability for more than 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an American saying," Roh said. "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the first press conference he has given for foreign correspondents 
since assuming office in February, 1988, Roh made the statements on the eve of 
the two-year anniversary of his historic pledge to transform South Korea from 
authoritarian to democratic rule. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1-hour 40-minute session, held in the guest house on the grounds of 
the presidential Blue House, Roh was asked to evaluate developments since his 
June 29, 1987, promise. He acknowledged that dissidents and opposition figures 
are complaining that "I have hardly done anything at all." 
</P>
<P>
But, pointing to labor strikes and often violent demonstrations, he said other 
Koreans claim that democratization has gone too far. "They ask, 'How can we 
call a democracy without law and order a true democracy?' 
</P>
<P>
"Many sound people say 'what more could I have done?' " he added. 
</P>
<P>
The ex-general, handpicked by former President Chun Doo Hwan to be his 
successor and then elected by a 37% plurality in 1987, said he regrets that 
Koreans "still lack the spirit of upholding law and order." 
</P>
<P>
Roh also said that Korea's economy, which after three years of 12% real growth 
declined to a 5.7% gain in the first three months, faces "more trouble than 
expected" because of labor strife and wage increases that have totaled 62% 
since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, in the belief that democracy must take root by the people's own efforts, 
Roh said he has "exercised maximum restraint in using public power." 
</P>
<P>
Pledging to continue resisting calls for a crackdown, he refrained from 
threatening to impose the 10% limit on annual wage increases that he asked 
labor on June 19 to accept to restore competitiveness to exports. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time Roh has described his restraint as designed to nurture 
democracy in South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Roh dismissed claims that an American military presence here 36 years after the 
1950-53 Korean War fuels anti-American sentiment. Such emotions, he said, are 
"chanted by" only a tiny, radical segment of society. 
</P>
<P>
"A majority of the people share my view that America is the best and oldest 
ally we have," Roh said. 
</P>
<P>
Far from being a financial burden on the United States, as some U.S. congress 
members have charged, the maintenance of about 43,000 American troops here is 
"the wisest and most economic investment" U.S. tax dollars could buy, Roh said. 
</P>
<P>
"It helps maintain freedom and peace in the Korean Peninsula and in this part 
of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Communist North Korea, rather than joining moves toward detente, "has refused 
to open up even one tiny bit," Roh said. "To the contrary, it has introduced 
state-of-the-art weaponry from the Soviet Union and has kept its troops in a 
forward deployment ready to launch an instant offensive." 
</P>
<P>
Roh said he was "shocked" to learn that an opposition member of the National 
Assembly, Suh Kyung Won, had secretly visited Pyongyang last August. He told 
Korean reporters that several other opposition figures also are suspected of 
making secret visits to the North Korean capital. 
</P>
<P>
Suh was arrested Wednesday by the Agency for National Security Planning, the 
former South Korean CIA. Security officials said he was charged with violating 
the National Security Law, which carries a maximum sentence of death. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Dae Jung, president of the Party for Peace and Democracy, of which Suh is a 
member, issued a public apology and said his party will expel Suh, a former 
head of the dissident Catholic Farmers Union.

BEIJING CALLS ENVOYS HOME IN CAMPAIGN TO REPAIR ITS IMAGE

China's hard-line leadership Wednesday escalated a campaign to renovate its 
shattered image at home and abroad by summoning most of its ambassadors to 
Beijing for consultations and launching an internal propaganda campaign that 
glorifies China's 84-year-old senior leader, Deng Xiaoping. 
</P>
<P>
The aging face of Deng, who is widely believed to have ordered the June 3-4 
crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators, appeared uninterrupted for nearly 20 
minutes on state-run national television Wednesday night. He was shown 
delivering a June 9 speech that laid out the policy behind the crackdown and 
its aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
For almost two weeks now, Chinese have been urged to be ready to study the 
speech. Although key quotations have been cited in the official media and an 
English-language newspaper in the British colony of Hong Kong published what it 
said was a full text, its release Wednesday morning in the government press was 
the first full publication for the Chinese public. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts here noted that it was accorded a prominence that no other leader's 
words have received since the death in 1976 of Communist Party Chairman Mao 
Tse-tung. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, many Chinese embassies in Asia, Africa and Europe confirmed 
that their ambassadors have been recalled to the Chinese capital, a measure 
that diplomats here said has not been taken since the 1966-76 Cultural 
Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles officials said they were told by Ma Yuzhen, the Chinese consul 
general in Los Angeles, that he is being summoned to Beijing "for consultation" 
and hopes to return to Los Angeles soon. But the Chinese Embassy in Washington 
said that Ambassador Han Xu had not been called home. 
</P>
<P>
There was no official confirmation or explanation of the recall in Beijing, but 
several diplomats speculated that the leadership is trying to avert additional 
diplomatic defections abroad -- there have been as many as 20 worldwide since 
the crackdown -- and that it plans to hold a meeting next week that will arm 
its envoys with the official version of the crushing of the movement that 
Beijing calls "a counterrevolutionary rebellion." 
</P>
<P>
"We assume they're going to give them the government line," one diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jiang Urges Punishment 
</P>
<P>
China's new Communist Party chief, Jiang Zemin, underscored that line in a 
speech late Wednesday, declaring that "severe punishment" must be meted out "to 
the plotters, organizers and behind-the-scene commanders who staged the turmoil 
and rebellion. For them, not an iota of forgiveness should be given." 
</P>
<P>
Jiang added that the party and the government "are still facing many problems 
and difficulties," and he stressed that a key part of the solution will be the 
intensification of political education in party principles for China's masses 
to bring about "a unity of thinking." 
</P>
<P>
But the basic blueprint of the government's line was Deng's speech, which was 
delivered to senior martial-law commanders and top Communist Party leaders less 
than a week after the army's assault on the demonstrators in and around Tian An 
Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
As is the custom in China's Communist Party structure, the speech has 
circulated among high and mid-level party officials for two weeks, and its 
release Wednesday was, in effect, both a call for unity within the party and an 
appeal to China's 1.1 billion people to throw their support behind Deng and the 
military. 
</P>
<P>
Implicitly addressing the hatred that many Beijing residents, and perhaps many 
outside the capital, now feel for the army after its violent suppression of the 
movement, Deng said in the speech: "The army is still the People's Army. This 
army retains the traditions of the old Red Army." 
</P>
<P>
He added that the crackdown "shows that the People's Army is truly a great wall 
of iron and steel of the party and country." 
</P>
<P>
In delivering the party line on the turmoil that has engulfed China for nearly 
two months, Deng declared that the protesters were not just "misguided" 
students or intellectuals but also included "a rebellious clique and a large 
quantity of the dregs of society." 
</P>
<P>
"Their goal was to establish a bourgeois republic entirely dependent on the 
West," Deng continued, constantly jabbing the air with a finger and slashing 
the air with a trembling left hand. "Some comrades didn't understand this 
point." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Says Leadership Was Confused 
</P>
<P>
The 84-year-old leader also explained a still-puzzling period at the peak of 
the crisis when many analysts suggested that it was unclear who was in charge 
of the nation. In his speech, Deng conceded that the leadership itself was 
confused. 
</P>
<P>
In a part of the speech already widely cited, Deng stated the leadership's 
commitment to economic liberalization and openness to the West. But he stressed 
that "in reform and adopting the open policy, we run the risk of importing evil 
influences from the West." 
</P>
<P>
Deng concluded that his leadership's decade-old economic liberalization policy 
was not the cause of the pro-democracy turmoil; rather, it was the failure of 
the leadership to adequately indoctrinate all of China's masses through what he 
called "political education." 
</P>
<P>
Deng specifically criticized the United States for protesting the Chinese 
government's use of force, setting the tone that has filled the state-run 
airwaves for days now. 
</P>
<P>
Although the June 9 speech was the most comprehensive version of leadership 
strategy, there were additional insights in three other recent Deng speeches, 
which have yet to be published but were leaked to Western journalists. 
</P>
<P>
The aging leader indicated in those addresses that the current strategy is a 
short-term one and repeated twice his often-stated intention to resign in the 
near future. He indicated that he is well aware that his leadership has lost 
popular support, and he outlined a plan in which the party should attack 
corruption as a way to regain that popularity.

The just-departed spokesman at the U.S. Embassy in La Paz called Bolivians 
"trolls . . . short and dark and strange" in a fictional story, prompting a 
State Department review. 
</P>
<P>
The story by Mark Jacobs, called "Stone Cowboy on the High Plains," was 
published in the June editions of the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher, asked about the story Monday, said 
he was unaware of it but added, "I can assure you we'll go out and buy a copy 
of the Atlantic . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The hero of Jacobs' fictional story, Roger, is a character who has spent time 
in a Bolivian jail and is eager to leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs writes: "All Bolivians were trolls, Roger had decided a long time ago. 
They were short and dark and strange. . . . "

HOUSE PASSES BILL TO FREE MOTHER JAILED TWO YEARS IN CUSTODY CASE 
</P>

<P>
The House on Wednesday overwhelmingly passed a bill aimed at freeing a woman 
jailed nearly two years by a judge for refusing to reveal the whereabouts of 
her daughter in a child-custody case. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would require prosecutors in the District of Columbia to release or to 
file criminal contempt charges -- guaranteeing a trial and the possibility of 
bail -- against anyone who had been held more than 12 months for civil contempt 
of court. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, which passed by a 376-34 margin, is designed to apply 
retroactively to the case of Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, a local plastic surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
She was jailed for civil contempt in August, 1987, after refusing to produce 
her daughter, Hilary, for court-ordered visits with Dr. Eric Foretich, her 
ex-husband and the girl's father. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan hid Hilary after alleging that Foretich had sexually abused the 
6-year-old girl; Foretich has repeatedly denied those charges. 
</P>
<P>
Before the legislation could take effect, the Senate would have to act as well. 
Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) has introduced a similar bill, but it has not yet 
been debated. 
</P>
<P>
Congress has review power over all District of Columbia laws, but rarely uses 
its right to intervene in the city's court system. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan's case now stands before the city's appeals court, which is reviewing 
D.C. Superior Court Judge Herbert Dixon's May 11 decision to keep her behind 
bars until she reveals where her daughter is. 
</P>
<P>
The case has gained national attention as women's rights groups and 
organizations concerned with child abuse have rallied to Morgan's defense. 
Foretich has been backed by several fathers' groups. 
</P>
<P>
"The controversy (involving Morgan) is not the issue we're addressing. . . . 
We're addressing a flaw in the criminal justice system," the bill's sponsor, 
Rep. Frank R. Wolf (R-Va.), said during floor debate. "The flaw is that anyone 
-- including Dr. Morgan -- can remain behind bars indefinitely on civil 
contempt charges." 
</P>
<P>
The bill survived despite protests that it would set a bad precedent in child 
custody battles and concern that Congress should not intrude on city court 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
"This interferes with an ongoing court case, and that is bad public policy," 
Rep. Herbert H. Bateman said during debate on the bill. "If this is such a good 
idea, we should have done it for all 50 states." 
</P>
<P>
"Don't apply it just to Dr. Morgan's case -- apply it to others and see if it 
fits," pleaded Rep. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.). 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Sachs, Morgan's attorney, has repeatedly asked Dixon to file criminal 
contempt charges against Morgan so that she can receive a jury trial.

HOUSE PROBE FOCUSING ON FRAUD IN HUD CO-INSURANCE PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The House investigation of the emerging scandal at the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development now is focusing on abuse by private brokers of a 
co-insurance program that is riddled by fraud and eventually could cost 
taxpayers as much as $1 billion, congressional sources said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-year-old program, designed to share with private lenders the government's 
risk on Federal Housing Administration mortgages on apartment buildings, has 
"enormous problems," said Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), chairman of the House 
Government Operations employment and housing subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
Lantos has scheduled a hearing Friday to examine the program with top HUD 
officials and a Mortgage Bankers Assn. representative. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is how some brokers were able to inflate appraisals of multifamily 
projects to increase the size of mortgages and thus earn higher fees, while 
letting the government take most of the risk of defaults, Lantos said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
"As it was run, it was a money machine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Like the losses suffered in the savings and loan industry, the HUD program 
provided government guarantees without effective regulation of the private 
firms that carried out the mortgage underwriting, congressional sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be the next big scandal," said another member of Congress, 
who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
One mortgage broker has been indicted on federal fraud charges and three other 
indictments are expected soon, a subcommittee staff member said. HUD has barred 
six firms from making government-insured mortgage loans or taking part in any 
other federal programs. 
</P>
<P>
Under the co-insurance program, holders of 106 of 800 mortgages have defaulted. 
In 21 claims handled by HUD last year, the government was able to recoup only 
45% of the value of the multifamily residences and lost a total of $61 million. 
</P>
<P>
Another 85 claims remain to be settled, and, if the same recovery percentage 
continues, the cost to taxpayers would be another $330 million to cover losses 
on the sales of the properties. 
</P>
<P>
With a default rate of 12.8%, the co-insurance program is "very badly managed," 
one aide to Lantos said. 
</P>
<P>
The co-insurance program was launched in 1983 as part of the Ronald Reagan 
Administration's "privatization" campaign to encourage private firms to take 
over services being performed by federal agencies. Before that time, brokers 
could earn a fee equal to 1% of an FHA mortgage on apartment projects by lining 
up a developer to buy the units, but HUD officials did the appraisal and 
serviced the mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
Under the co-insurance program, however, HUD's duties were delegated to private 
mortgage brokers, who were allowed to submit their own appraisals of projects, 
underwrite the mortgages and get a much higher fee of 4.3%. They also were 
required to collect the payments, pay for 20% of the loss and resell properties 
in case of default. 
</P>
<P>
The brokers, however, were able to receive their fees immediately. If, as HUD 
charges, some brokers inflated their appraisals without justification, they 
received larger fees than were merited. But in the event of default, HUD was 
only able to collect the real value of the property, with taxpayers making up 
the difference. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, a HUD audit disclosed that 14 projects co-insured by one 
Knoxville, Tenn., mortgage company were overvalued by an average of 29%, or by 
$22 million.

The remnants of Tropical Storm Allison flooded hundreds of homes Wednesday in 
southern Louisiana and whipped up tornado-force winds that injured five people 
in Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 10 inches of rain fell in the Baton Rouge area and 3 to 6 inches more 
were expected. 
</P>
<P>
Allison came ashore Monday in Texas and was blamed for four deaths in that 
state. More than a foot of rain fell in some spots, and authorities estimated 
that damage could total $1 billion in the Houston area alone. 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana and Mississippi continued to take a pounding from the storm as Texas 
began drying out.

The 1989 Colquitt County Teacher of the Year was fired for growing marijuana in 
her back yard, although her husband insisted the pot belonged to him and was 
hidden from his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Vicki Sherling held her hands to her face and sobbed as Colquitt County School 
Board members argued for three hours Tuesday night, then deliberated 15 minutes 
before voting, 5 to 1, to dismiss her for "immorality." 
</P>
<P>
A county grand jury earlier indicted the Sherlings on charges of growing 
marijuana. They were arrested May 19 when police discovered 22 marijuana plants 
growing in their yard.

FDA REPORTEDLY AWARE OF AIDS DRUG TEST

The organizers of unsanctioned clinical trials of the touted AIDS drug Compound 
Q said Wednesday that federal officials as well as scientists conducting 
official tests of a similar drug were aware of the underground experiment 
before it became public this week. 
</P>
<P>
"Officials of the (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration were apprised of what we 
were doing," said Martin Delaney, co-director of Project Inform, which is 
conducting the underground trials. "It doesn't mean they agreed with it, or 
supported it, but they were interested to know our results. That's true of 
officials at the National Institutes of Health as well." 
</P>
<P>
Delaney also told the crowded press conference here that, "As recently as a 
week ago, Dr. (James) Kahn at San Francisco General Hospital told us that 
because of our findings, their trial had been speeded up, that they were now 
going to higher doses, and that he hoped they'd be able to wrap it up by Sept. 
1." 
</P>
<P>
The FDA announced Tuesday that it was launching an investigation of the 
underground research program after the death Saturday of one of 42 patients who 
had been injected with the drug. Another patient in the study committed 
suicide, and a handful have suffered serious side effects. Many have also shown 
considerable improvements based on laboratory tests, doctors and some patients 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was only after this very unfortunate death that everyone headed for the 
hills and acted like we were some kind of monsters," Delaney said. 
</P>
<P>
An FDA spokesman, Brad Stone, said Tuesday that the agency's investigation in 
part will look into "whether a contact (by Delaney to the agency) was made, and 
how in-depth it was." 
</P>
<P>
FDA officials could not be reached Wednesday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Kahn, who has denounced the renegade researchers, was not immediately available 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for San Francisco General issued a statement on behalf of Dr. 
Michael McGrath, the developer of the official version of the drug, in which he 
confirmed that he had been in contact with unspecified AIDS activists. 
</P>
<P>
"I have received infrequent telephone calls from AIDS activists giving 
anecdotal rumors that some form of Q was being administered to people in the 
U.S.," said McGrath, adding that he did not give the activists any advice on 
unauthorized trials. 
</P>
<P>
He did confirm, however, that Genelabs Inc. of Redwood City, the manufacturer 
of the official version of the drug, "conducted a preliminary test (of Compound 
Q imported from Shanghai) and found it to be substantially the same as 
GLQ-223," the official version of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
Compound Q, or trichosanthin, is a plant protein derived from the root tuber of 
a Chinese cucumber. GLQ-223 is a synthesized version of the drug. The substance 
has stirred considerable excitement among researchers because of its ability to 
seek out and kill infected cells known as macrophages in test tube experiments. 
</P>
<P>
Delaney said Wednesday that he welcomed the controversy that has surrounded the 
underground experiment, which is being conducted by doctors in San Francisco, 
New York, Los Angeles and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"It is time to have a national debate on whether (the scientific research 
establishment) should do things differently" in confronting the AIDS epidemic, 
which has already killed about 55,000 Americans.

A Merced County family living next to the front gate of Castle Air Force Base 
has filed a federal lawsuit here alleging that the military has not done enough 
to protect it from the hazards of a cancer-causing chemical seeping from the 
base in a poisonous ground-water plume. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Burke, his wife, Diana, and their 9-year-old daughter, Billie Jo, claim in 
the suit that the Air Force botched installation of a water filtration system 
at their home and exposed them to levels of the industrial solvent TCE 130 
times higher than the drinking water safety standard for the solvent. 
</P>
<P>
They seek at least $1 million in damages, contending that the value of their 
1.5-acre home site has been destroyed and that they face years of uncertainty 
over whether they will develop cancer.

ABORTION DEBATE STALLS SPENDING BILL IN ASSEMBLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
On the eve of a possible U.S. Supreme Court decision that may throw the 
abortion issue back to the states, emotional debate in the California 
Legislature stalled a crucial spending bill Wednesday because it contained a 
provision to pay for abortions for poor women. 
</P>
<P>
The failure of the $35l-million spending measure to win approval in the 
Assembly immediately jeopardized the paychecks of 9,960 state employees who 
work for agencies that would have received emergency funding under the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what's going to happen now," said an exhausted Assemblyman John 
Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara), the bill's author and chairman of the Assembly 
Ways and Means Committee. "At some point I guess people will do something." 
</P>
<P>
The measure could be reconsidered today. 
</P>
<P>
The bill that ignited the debate in the Legislature provided extra money, 
including $16.2 million to pay for abortions for Medi-Cal patients, to state 
agencies that had run short of finances before the end of the state fiscal year 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
It won approval in the Senate on a 32-1 vote after an attempt by anti-abortion 
lawmakers to delete the abortion money was defeated on a 19-17 vote. The 
anti-abortion senators later managed to cut $571,856 out of the bill that would 
have satisfied a court order requiring the state to pay the fees of lawyers for 
the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Center for Youth Law who 
won a 1987 judicial decision directing the state to fund Medi-Cal abortions. 
</P>
<P>
In the Assembly, however, the measure fell 10 votes short of the 54 needed for 
passage when most lawmakers opposing abortion voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
"We simply can't provide the dollars for destroying literally thousands of 
pre-born baby boys and girls," said Assemblyman Phillip Wyman (R-Tehachapi). 
Republican Leader Ross Johnson of La Habra said anti-abortion lawmakers felt 
the spending bill had made them "prisoners of conscience" because they didn't 
want to do anything to delay paychecks for state employees yet they could not 
"in good conscience vote for this bill in the form that it is sent to us." 
</P>
<P>
Vasconcellos, who said he personally opposes abortions, urged his colleagues to 
approve the measure and keep the state employees from becoming victims of a 
legislative stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Edd Fong, a spokesman for state Controller Gray Davis, said the 
spending bill would affect the paychecks of state employees working for the 
Franchise Tax Board, the Department of Forestry, the Department of Industrial 
Relations and the Fair Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
He said his office has already written checks and is prepared to deliver them 
as soon as the Legislature approves the spending bill. But if the Legislature 
does not act soon, he said, the state workers may not get them by Friday, their 
regular payday. He said workers in rural areas outside of Sacramento may 
already face delays.

RESTORATION FUNDS OKD FOR EAGLE ROCK LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A joint committee of the state Senate and Assembly has agreed to earmark 
$250,000 for the restoration of the former Eagle Rock Library. 
</P>
<P>
Three similar allocations approved by legislators since 1981 have been vetoed 
by Gov. George Deukmejian, and there are no guarantees that the allocation will 
be approved this time. 
</P>
<P>
The money to restore the 62-year-old building is part of the 1989-90 budget 
fashioned by a six-member conference committee appointed by the two legislative 
houses. Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles), who represents the Eagle 
Rock area, had asked the committee for $400,000 to restore the library. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish mission-style building has been vacant since 1981, when the library 
moved to new quarters. The grant would enable Los Angeles to bring the former 
library up to earthquake standards and to install access for the handicapped. 
The city's General Services Department would provide matching funds of $26,500. 
</P>
<P>
The budget is expected to be approved by the Senate and the Assembly this week. 
Deukmejian, who has veto power over individual spending items in the budget, 
must approve it by July 30.

TRANSITIONAL HOUSING FOR HOMELESS APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale City Council unanimously approved a five-year housing plan Tuesday 
that officially recommends providing transitional housing for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The housing plan is a mandatory five-year update to the housing provisions of 
the city's General Plan. The update's deadline is Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Although three council members oppose spending city funds on projects aimed at 
helping the homeless, they said they voted for the plan because a 1987 state 
law requires cities to address homeless problems in their general plans. 
</P>
<P>
"It's either vote for the plan or go to jail," Councilman Larry Zarian joked in 
explaining his vote during the council meeting.

Joseph Remiro, the Symbionese Liberation Army member jailed for killing 
Oakland's school superintendent, has been denied parole, authorities said. 
Remiro, 42, did not attend the Board of Prison Terms hearing at Corcoran State 
Prison. A three-member panel voted unanimously to deny a release date and 
recommended another hearing in two years. Remiro was convicted in 1973 of 
killing Oakland Schools Supt. Marcus Foster with cyanide-tipped bullets. Two 
months later, the SLA, a band of self-described revolutionaries, kidnaped 
newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst.

Hundreds of thousands of Serbs celebrated their national day in the troubled 
Yugoslav province of Kosovo, but the region's ethnic Albanian majority 
boycotted the festival. In one of the biggest gatherings seen in Yugoslavia 
since it was founded in 1918, Serbs packed the plains around Pristina, the 
capital of Kosovo, for the 600th anniversary of a battle against Turkish 
invaders. The celebrants came from all over Yugoslavia, some from North America 
and Australia. Kosovo, the heart of medieval Serbia, is today an impoverished 
southern province adjoining Albania. The Orthodox Christian Serbs are a small 
minority there and claim they are harassed by the predominantly Muslim ethnic 
Albanians.

A Czechoslovak underground publisher was jailed for 2 1/2 years, the longest 
prison term handed down for dissident activities in Czechoslovakia in recent 
years, a leading activist said. The sentence for Frantisek Starek was announced 
as police warned Vaclav Havel, the country's best known dissident, that he runs 
the risk of being sent back to prison. Havel was freed from prison in May after 
serving half of an eight-month jail term. Starek was convicted of incitement, 
according to Petr Uhl of the Charter 77 human rights movement. Starek, the 
editor of the underground journal Vokno (Window) was arrested in February.

Testimony in the case of a Cuban military hero who confessed to smuggling 
drugs, ivory and diamonds hinted at involvement by Havana in a secret operation 
in Venezuela. Several witnesses told a military tribunal in Havana that Maj. 
Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez had been an "internacionalista" in Venezuela. 
"Internacionalista" is a term Cubans use to describe someone willing to fight 
anywhere in the world for the ideals of Cuba's Communist revolution. This was 
the first mention of Ochoa's name in connection with Venezuela. Witnesses at 
the tribunal gave no details of the operation.

A father and son separated since the boy's birth were reunited after 19 years 
when both turned up as inmates in the Santa Clara County Jail. Robert Arthur 
Magoon was in custody for allegedly violating his parole and his father, 
Michael Arthur Magoon, 44, was being held on robbery charges. The elder Magoon 
also has warrants pending for investigation of felony child stealing. "When I 
first came here, they said, 'Do you have a relative here?' " said Robert. "I 
said, 'Not that I know of.' At first, I thought it couldn't be possible. For 
all I knew, he could have been on the other side of the world." Robert was 
separated from his father shortly after birth when his parents split up, and he 
spent most of his youth in foster homes. He ran away from the last one at age 
14. Michael also said he tried looking for his long-lost son and had no idea he 
was in a foster home.

Former Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos has suffered liver failure and 
the prognosis is "extremely poor," a hospital administrator said. "Mr. Marcos 
is semi-comatose, his condition has worsened and he's not recognizing friends 
or family," said Eugene Tiwanak, assistant administrator of St. Francis Medical 
Center in Honolulu, where the exiled former leader has been hospitalized five 
months. Marcos suffered heart, lung and kidney failure late last month, and he 
has been on life-support equipment since. Marcos, 71, and his wife, Imelda, 
have lived in Hawaii since a 1986 popular revolt catapulted Corazon Aquino to 
the presidency, ending his 20-year rule.

A group of current and former police employees has filed a $30-million federal 
lawsuit against the City of Concord because a video camera was secretly placed 
in the police station men's room. The department installed a hidden video 
camera above a urinal in 1986, hoping to identify the person who clogged it 
several times with toilet paper. Chief George Straka has called the 
surveillance "bad judgment" and said no one ever viewed the tapes. The overflow 
reportedly flooded a computer room and the chief's office on the floor below. 
The restroom was open to the public but used primarily by police. The suit 
accuses Straka and three commanders of invading the plaintiffs' privacy. It 
asks that the city pay $1 million each to 26 officers and three civilian 
employees who allegedly were watched by police cadets and filmed as they stood 
at urinals.

A helicopter crashed on the Greek island of Corfu when it hit the top of a tree 
during filming of the movie "Freedom or Death," killing American stuntman 
Clinton Carpenter, 23, and injuring a five-member film crew, police said. The 
film is being made by British-based All Star Pictures and stars Oliver Reed and 
George Kennedy, police said. Neither actor was involved in the accident. Police 
said the injured on the helicopter were Americans Michael Cane, 30; Phil Odel, 
33, and Lee Linguist, 32. British pilot Mark Wolff, 41, was also injured. 
Hometowns of the victims were not immediately available.

PARENTS CAUGHT IN TUG OF WAR OVER BILINGUAL SCHOOLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Yolanda Granados knows that Southern California employers value workers who 
speak both English and Spanish. So she wants her son, Luis, to grow up 
bilingual. 
</P>
<P>
But when Luis started kindergarten last fall at Glenwood School in Sun Valley, 
most of the instruction he received was in Spanish. Granados worried that, as a 
result, he would fall behind in English. She asked school officials to change 
her son's classroom assignment. 
</P>
<P>
Many Latino parents are surprised when they find out that much, and in some 
cases most, of the instruction in a bilingual classroom is in Spanish, said 
Gloria Soto, a parent activist at Glenwood. But, she said, school officials 
discourage such parents from requesting a change to a classroom where English 
predominates. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents . . . ask what they can do if they don't want their child in the 
bilingual program," Soto said. "I tell them that if they don't want their child 
in the program, then sign them out." 
</P>
<P>
In April, Soto organized a group of Glenwood parents to march at the school in 
support of Sally Peterson, the Glenwood kindergarten teacher who founded the 
group Learning English Advocates Drive. LEAD members argue that teaching in 
English, with assistance from an aide fluent in the students' native language, 
hastens their progress in speaking English. 
</P>
<P>
But the Los Angeles Unified School District's master plan for bilingual 
education is built on the principle that students are best taught in their 
native language, with daily doses of English instruction. When students able to 
read and write in their native language become fluent in English, those skills 
easily transfer to the new language, the district maintains. 
</P>
<P>
State and federal laws require that parents be allowed to choose from the 
different language approaches. At Glenwood -- as at many schools -- the 
parents' right to choose has become something of a tug of war between 
educators. 
</P>
<P>
"They brainwash parents," said Linda Meier, coordinator of the school's 
bilingual program, referring to Peterson and the other three Glenwood teachers 
affiliated with LEAD. "They literally tell the parents that the reason their 
children cannot read is because of the bilingual program, and this is not 
true." 
</P>
<P>
But Peterson said Meier and other school district officials attempt to coerce 
parents into keeping their children in bilingual classes. At some schools, she 
said, a videotape is shown in which happy children are speaking Spanish and 
tearful children are speaking English. "This kind of harassment and duress is 
an insult to parents," Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
When they start school, students with Hispanic surnames are tested to determine 
whether they are fluent in English. But the tests are so flawed that many who 
do not need bilingual instruction -- including some born in the United States, 
whose parents do not speak Spanish -- are put in the classes, Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
Meier denied that parents are coerced. "I would never do that to a parent 
because it's not my child," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Meier and Peterson agreed, however, that Latino culture causes many parents to 
be deferential to teachers, making the parents vulnerable to manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
About 500 of Glenwood's 800 students speak limited English. Meier said about 
100 of these students, including all of those in Peterson's kindergarten class, 
have been assigned at their parents' request to "individual learning plans," 
where children are taught in English. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Individual Learning Plans 
</P>
<P>
Districtwide, 22% of the 120,000 limited-English-speaking elementary school 
students are assigned to individual learning plans. But only 13% of those 
students participate in the plans at their parents' request. The other 9% are 
assigned to the programs because bilingual classes are unavailable at their 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Granados, a former executive secretary, said it took several telephone calls, 
several visits to the school and a meeting with the coordinator of Glenwood's 
bilingual program to get her son's classroom assignment changed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind my kid learning Spanish," Granados said, but not at the expense 
of learning in English. She speaks mostly Spanish to Luis, and her husband, 
Luis Sr., speaks English to him. 
</P>
<P>
"He's Latino, but he was born in this state," she said of her son. "I want him 
learning the language that is going to help him in this state." 
</P>
<P>
Meier said that since LEAD's founding, many parents have asked to remove their 
children from the bilingual program. "I had to insist that these parents get 
properly informed" about the program, she said. "Some of the stories they come 
in with, I can see that they are totally confused." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson, however, complained that Meier's counseling about the language 
instruction options has been one-sided. As a result, Peterson is the only 
teacher at the school allowed to counsel parents about where their students are 
placed. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Dominguez, whose son Mariano is a student in Peterson's class, speaks 
only Spanish. But Dominguez said through a translator that she wants her son to 
be taught in English. She said she was asked about placing him in a bilingual 
class, but refused.

COUNCIL APPROVES CENTRAL AGENCY FOR ENVIRONMENT POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARISSE JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a step that acknowledges the growing concern over Los Angeles' many 
environmental problems, the City Council on Wednesday authorized the creation 
of a Department of Environmental Affairs to seek solutions to problems ranging 
from air quality to water pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists watching the vote in the council chambers hailed the 
unanimous decision, which will make Los Angeles the first big city in the 
nation to have a centralized way of setting policy and coordinating actions on 
environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
"There are all kinds of environmental concerns, but what's happened is there 
hasn't been one (central) office to coordinate, to manage or to set policy on 
all these various issues," said Joan Milke Flores, who called for creating the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Realistic Solutions 
</P>
<P>
By "its independent evaluation of environmental problems, the department will 
help lead the city to realistic solutions and put an end to approaching 
environmental issues in a fragmented way." 
</P>
<P>
In a period when Los Angeles is being confronted with myriad environmental 
problems, the new department will assist the council and mayor by analyzing 
issues and making policy recommendations. Its staff will also monitor citywide 
environmental programs and disseminate information to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists applauded creation of the new office as a long overdue 
solution to a bureaucracy that they say has mired environmental actions in 
individual departments rather than finding comprehensive answers that could be 
applied citywide. 
</P>
<P>
"There were instances in which environmental concerns would fall into the 
cracks because different agencies would be involved with different parts of the 
projects," said Jill Ratner, a member of Citizens for a Better Environment, a 
statewide group that monitors enforcement of environmental legislation. "I 
think (the new office) will give us a place to go." 
</P>
<P>
Added Bonnie Holmes of the Los Angeles-area Sierra Club, who attended the 
council session along with Ratner, "it's a long overdue, crucial step to 
provide the integrated response we need for this city's environmental 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
13 Departments 
</P>
<P>
Currently 13 city departments exert some jurisdiction over environmental 
matters, a control system that spurred Mayor Tom Bradley to initially oppose 
the creation of the department. Fearing that such a centralized office would 
touch off a turf war among other departments handling similar issues, Bradley 
instead proposed an air quality management office with more limited authority. 
</P>
<P>
However, the mayor is expected to approve the department's creation, said 
spokesman Bill Chandler, and the duties that would have been assigned to an air 
quality management office will fall under the jurisdiction of the new 
department. 
</P>
<P>
The department is expected to have a first-year budget of approximately 
$700,000.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEW CENTER WILL FOCUS ON AGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Old age will be the focus of a new multi-disciplinary research center organized 
by UCLA and the Jewish Homes for the Aging of Greater Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first of its kind in the United States, the Borun Center for 
Gerontological Research, will conduct studies on the social, economic, 
environmental and psychological problems associated with aging. 
</P>
<P>
In the next 30 years, the number of people over the age of 65 in California is 
expected to double to more than 6 million, causing burdens on families and 
health-care professionals. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of the center, which is being financed in part by a $1-million grant 
from the Anna and Harry Borun Foundation, is to improve both institutional and 
non-institutional care for the frail elderly.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUPLE JAILED FOR SWINDLES 2ND TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A couple was sentenced for the second time Wednesday to Los Angeles County Jail 
for swindling customers of their wood products business by taking their money 
for quality goods but delivering inferior ones or none at all. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Huber, 39, and his wife, Julie Huber, 37, of Newbury Park, were each 
sentenced to six-month jail terms after admitting that their activities in 
operating a Ventura County custom door business violated the terms of their 
probation from a 1986 conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Municipal Court Judge Isabel Cohen also ordered the couple to pay up 
to $30,000 in restitution to their victims. Ronald Huber is scheduled to begin 
serving his jail term Sept. 7, and Julie Huber is to start serving hers March 
7. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986 Cohen sentenced Julie Huber to 165 days in County Jail and her husband 
to 150 days behind bars after they pleaded no contest to a similar swindle. The 
couple was also placed on three years' unsupervised probation.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MOTHER HELD IN DEATH OF DAUGHTER, 11 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman was arrested Wednesday on suspicion of murder in the death of her 
11-year-old daughter, who died in a hospital after apparently being beaten 
during an argument, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Thomas, hospitalized with a blackened eye, other facial injuries and a 
cut leg, suffered cardiac arrest and died about 2 a.m. at California Medical 
Center, Lt. Doug Collisson said. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives booked the girl's mother, Eara Ross, 33, of Los Angeles on suspicion 
of murder after interviewing the woman, her boyfriend and other residents of 
the Budlong Avenue neighborhood where she lived with her four children, 
Detective Verne King said. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy was expected to determine the exact cause of the girl's injuries and 
death, King said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors who heard loud yelling called paramedics to an apartment belonging to 
the boyfriend's mother in the 2600 block of Budlong Avenue shortly before 2 
a.m., King said. 
</P>
<P>
"The mother became upset with the little girl. There was an argument about 
something," King said. "We interviewed the mother and . . . we have evidence 
enough so that we were able to arrest her."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FERRARO ASKS SUPPORT FOR FLAG AMENDMENT

<P>
Taking up a patriotic cry in response to a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling, 
Los Angeles City Councilman John Ferraro on Wednesday called on city residents 
to support a constitutional amendment that would outlaw desecration of the 
American flag. 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro introduced his motion after the Supreme Court ruled that flag burning 
is protected under the First Amendment to the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the decision "a disappointment to patriotic Americans," the motion asks 
the city to support a resolution authored by State Sen. Cecil Green (D-Santa Fe 
Springs) asking Congress to adopt a constitutional amendment protecting the 
flag.

PASSENGERS STALLED AS AIRLINE HITS ROUGH TIMES 
</P>

<P>
Air America, a small vacation airline that has experienced problems with its 
aircraft, has caused hundreds of passengers to begin their holidays hanging 
around Los Angeles International Airport for as long as two days. 
</P>
<P>
A flight bound for Hawaii, scheduled to take off at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday with 350 
passengers, finally left at 5 a.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A flight to Nassau, the Bahamas, scheduled to leave at 11:30 p.m. last Friday 
with more than 300 passengers, finally got off the ground on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Travel agents said such delays on small airlines that have no backup equipment 
are always a possibility. Arrangements for such charter or special vacation 
package flights, they said, are usually made by passengers directly with the 
airline in response to advertisements offering bargain fares. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to say it is a common occurrence, but it is easy to see why a 
small airline would incur problems like that because they are not always going 
to have the resources to fall back on," said David Jeffrey, spokesman for 
Airline Passengers of America, a nonprofit consumer lobbying group. 
</P>
<P>
"When you pick between flying one of the biggest airlines in the world or a 
little obscure one," Jeffrey said, "common sense is going to dictate that, on 
the small one, there is a greater possibility of inconvenience." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Small Size Cited 
</P>
<P>
Air America claims its problems stem from its size -- only five airplanes, all 
wide-body L-1011s -- and the popularity of its destinations during this peak 
summer vacation and holiday period. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Davis, vice president of marketing for Air America, said the Nassau flight 
was postponed last weekend because Lockheed had delayed delivery of a plane 
that it was refurbishing for the airline. Davis said the airline expected to 
get the plane by Friday but that it was actually delivered on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Hawaii flight was delayed several times Tuesday while mechanics 
located the trouble indicated by an electrical component warning light. By 4 
p.m., he said, they had found the problem, but it took all night to replace a 
faulty throttle cable that runs from the cockpit to the tail of the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
"It is tough to be delayed that long. I feel sorry for the customers," Davis 
said Wednesday after the plane left for Hawaii. "We tried to rent another 
airplane from another airline, but every airline had all its equipment booked. 
It is the start of summer vacations." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said passengers were given meals and rooms overnight at the Airport 
Hyatt. 
</P>
<P>
He said passengers on the long-delayed Nassau flight were offered full refunds 
if they chose to cancel their trips; or, if they chose to go, were housed in 
the Hyatt and Quality Inn hotels at the airport until the plane took off, and 
were given a $200 rebate when they landed in Nassau. 
</P>
<P>
"Since some of the travel packages cost only $399," he said, "we thought that 
was fair." 
</P>
<P>
The little airline delayed a flight for 340 Hawaii vacationers 26 hours on July 
6, 1988, when one of its planes needed a new fuel valve. When the part could 
not be flown in from Chicago as arranged, Air America finally borrowed one from 
another airline. 
</P>
<P>
Even major airlines can have long flight delays, some travel agents said, if a 
plane has a mechanical problem and all of the airline's other planes are in 
use. But major carriers usually are better able to substitute equipment or find 
spare parts. 
</P>
<P>
Travel agents Mary Castiglione and Lydia Plona of Associated Travel Inc. in 
downtown Los Angeles said they try to prepare passengers by giving them the 
percentage of an airline's flights that are on time according to the Department 
of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Air America, said Plona, who had booked one passenger on a delayed Air America 
flight to Hawaii, does not participate in that rating system.

MAYOR SAYS ADMINISTRATOR QUIT BECAUSE OF THREATS

<P>
After five weeks on the job, interim City Administrator Andrew Lazzaretto 
resigned suddenly last week, leaving in his wake a contentious City Council 
disputing the reasons for his departure. 
</P>
<P>
Lazzaretto did not return numerous phone calls this week. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Donna Smith said Lazzaretto came to her office Friday at 4:30 p.m., shut 
the door and told her he was resigning, effective in 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"He could no longer work under such stressful conditions," Smith announced at 
Monday night's council meeting. "He said that on two separate occasions he saw 
a fist coming at him and he didn't know if his face was going to be smashed. . 
. . He said he didn't need the money that much." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said the blows were threatened by a councilman, but would not identify 
the person. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Nell Soto said Lazzaretto also met with her Friday afternoon about 
his resignation, but said nothing about stress or physical intimidation. Soto 
said Lazzaretto told her his part-time job with Pomona was conflicting with his 
other consulting work and family obligations. 
</P>
<P>
"My understanding was that he had a hard time keeping up with everything," Soto 
said. "Simply, he wasn't aware (when he took the job) of everything he would 
have to do. . . . I don't know what he told the mayor." 
</P>
<P>
The council voted in executive session early Tuesday morning to name Fire Chief 
Tom Fee as interim city administrator. Fee's appointment was supported by 
council members Soto, C. L. (Clay) Bryant and Tomas Ursua. Smith and Councilman 
Mark Nymeyer voted against the choice. 
</P>
<P>
Soto, Bryant and Ursua voted to hire Lazzaretto May 16 after a brief interview, 
two weeks after the three forced the ouster of City Administrator A. J. Wilson. 
Smith voted against hiring Lazzaretto. Nymeyer was absent, but later joined the 
mayor in expressing concern over the council's quick choice of an interim 
successor to Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview earlier this month, Lazzaretto spoke philosophically about the 
rancorous City Council he had encountered in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a new council group here," he said. "There is a new mix of 
personalities. It takes time for people to get in a familiar groove. I think 
after awhile, it'll kind of shake itself out." 
</P>
<P>
But according to Smith and Nymeyer, Lazzaretto had already written his 
resignation letter at the time he made those statements. Smith said the 
administrator had told her he was having trouble withstanding threats and 
harassment from Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant, Smith said, had shouted at Lazzaretto two days before his resignation, 
insisting that he fire executive assistant Hector Godinez. Bryant has sought to 
have Godinez dismissed, claiming Wilson violated the City Code when he hired 
him in January without approval of the city Merit System Commission. The 
council majority later voted to eliminate the positions of Godinez and two 
other top administrators. 
</P>
<P>
However, Bryant denied trying to intimidate Lazzaretto and said he knows of no 
physical threats to the administrator. "Donna Smith is a consummate, rotten 
liar," he said in an interview. He acknowledged that he and Lazzaretto had 
differences over Godinez's continued employment with the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I insisted that (Lazzaretto) discharge the three positions that had been 
eliminated from the budget," Bryant said. "But other than that, I respected the 
man. I think he spread himself too thin. He could not do a good job and do his 
other responsibilities, too. And I think that's why he resigned." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said Lazzaretto resigned because "he couldn't compromise any further with 
what Mr. Bryant was asking." He decided that he wanted to leave with his 
professional integrity intact." 
</P>

Nymeyer said he was not surprised by Lazzaretto's sudden exit. "Mr. 
Lazzaretto's very experienced when it comes to dealing with a council that's at 
odds," he said. "I think he looked at our City Council, the dynamics of the 
personalities, and quickly concluded that this was no ordinary council."

NEIGHBORHOOD CELEBRATES 9 YEARS OF FRIENDSHIP FORGED BY DEVASTATING BLAZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Perched above the smog on a hillside plateau, about 70 neighbors in the 
community of Duarte Mesa blocked off a cul-de-sac with an arch of balloons 
Saturday and set out tables in the street. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly nine years after a wind-swept fire ravaged this well-to-do neighborhood, 
many of the residents continue to share bonds they formed after 35 of the homes 
were reduced to ashes. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the ruins and confusion left in the wake of the Nov. 16, 1980, blaze, the 
neighbors opened their hearts and homes to each other, building lasting 
friendships and a tight-knit community out of the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
Clustered around five streets at the northern tip of Mt. Olive Drive, which is 
the only access road to the neighborhood, the homes are geographically isolated 
from the rest of the surrounding suburbs. "That's one of the things that makes 
us such a cohesive group," said resident Kathy Hancock. 
</P>
<P>
Every summer and Christmas, the neighbors get to know newcomers and reminisce 
about the fire and the community spirit that surfaced afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Van Leuven, who lived in a trailer for three months among the ashes of 
what had been her home, remembers: "That first Christmas (season), I came out 
one morning and there was a Christmas tree sitting on my (car) hood." Neighbors 
were going house-to-house giving out trees to families whose homes had been 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
"It brought everybody really close," said George Halburian, whose home was one 
of about 50 on the Mesa that survived the blaze. He and his wife, Shirley, 
invited their next-door neighbors -- a family of five -- to stay with them for 
a month until their house was rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
Elda Medina rented a condominium while her home was being rebuilt. "I was 
really down," she recalled. One neighbor provided clothing for all five members 
of Medina's family, and another gave them several hundred dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"It had been a community that lived behind their bushes," said Yrata Nelson, 
who lost several trees in her yard, but not her house. "It took that fire to 
take the bushes away and bring those people out. The attitude was not stay with 
your property but go see who you could help." 
</P>
<P>
"It was heartbreaking to see neighbors coming back and digging through the 
ashes," said Eleanore Whitaker, whose home also withstood the fire. "Some left 
without even their wallets; women were looking for their jewelry." 
</P>
<P>
The pre-dawn blaze, which started in Azusa and was fueled by strong winds, 
swept across 6,200 acres, causing an estimated $15 million in damages. A 
23-year-old Azusa man was later charged with lighting a campfire outside his 
trailer home that got out of control that night. 
</P>
<P>
The charges were dismissed March 5, 1981, in Pomona Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the extent of the destruction, almost everyone decided to rebuild, said 
Dr. James Secrest, whose new house was ready the following spring. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody faced the same situation, having to live away from the Mesa and come 
up here to supervise the building of our homes. We would go to each other's 
houses for lunch, dinner. We were using everybody else's contractors." 
</P>
<P>
But the homeowners' Duarte Mesa Assn., which before the fire had been quiet 
politically, took a more active role as the neighborhood was being rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte Mesa, at an elevation of 1,000 feet, is the city's highest neighborhood 
and commands impressive views of the San Gabriel Valley. Fears that overzealous 
owners might increase the heights of their new houses and obstruct the views 
prompted the association to ask the Duarte City Council to impose a height 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, the city imposed a ceiling of 18 feet for new construction, said Merv 
Money, a longtime Mesa resident and city councilman at the time. Today, any new 
construction or remodeling is reviewed by the Duarte Mesa Assn.'s board of 
directors, which passes its recommendations on to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
One owner who was rebuilding his home was reported to the city by the 
association after it discovered that he was exceeding the height limit. The 
city forced the owner to halt construction, and he modified his plans. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a sounding board and an arbitrator," said association President Karen 
Nellis. "We make sure nobody's doing anything they're not supposed to do as a 
courtesy to the city and other homeowners." 
</P>
<P>
Since the fire, the association has rallied residents in opposing a proposed 
trash incinerator in Irwindale and an increase in water bills. The incinerator 
plan was eventually defeated, but water fees were raised. After appealing to 
the state Public Utilities Commission in 1981, the association succeeded in 
preventing the neighborhood's quaint gas lamps from being replaced with 
conventional street lights. 
</P>
<P>
Nellis said the association distributes monthly newsletters to all 86 homes and 
coordinates a neighborhood watch program. 
</P>
<P>
"They're one of the most involved neighborhood watch groups I have," said Don 
Anderson, Duarte's director of safety coordination. He added that the crime 
rate on the Mesa is among the lowest in the city. One burglary has been 
reported so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
"They epitomize what you want neighborhood watch to do: talking to each other, 
keeping track of neighbors' cars, schedules." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Everybody Knows Neighbors 
</P>
<P>
"This is an unusual area just because everybody knows your neighbors," said 
Margaret Finlay, former co-president of the association. 
</P>
<P>
"You just don't have that lost feeling like in a metropolitan area," Nellis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"This association is far more active and closely associated than it's ever 
been," Money said at the block party. As he sat at one of the gaily decorated 
tables, he recalled the day of the fire. He said he awoke at 3 a.m. and saw the 
telephone poles outside his house turning an eerie orange. 
</P>
<P>
After sending his family down the hill, he climbed onto his roof to hose down 
the wood shingles. The fire spared his home. 
</P>
<P>
"I stayed through the whole thing," he said. "I watched all the houses around 
me burn."

PASADENA STRESSES COMMUTER PLANS TO EASE TRAFFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

PASADENA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city is blocking the lease of offices in two large buildings while it 
decides if plans devised by the developers will do enough to induce the 
tenants' employees to walk, ride a bicycle, take a bus or join a car pool to 
get to work. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city is planning to require its own 2,000 employees to stop 
driving to work by themselves or pay $25 a month for parking. The city also 
plans to offer free bus passes, cash and other incentives to lure workers away 
from commuting alone. 
</P>
<P>
And in another program aimed at easing traffic congestion, the city Board of 
Directors voted this week to allocate $30,000 to join with the Pasadena Chamber 
of Commerce in starting an organization of employers in the Civic Center area 
to cooperate on ride-sharing programs. 
</P>
<P>
David Barnhart, city engineer and transportation manager, said the city is 
trying to curb the growth of automobile traffic with a variety of strategies. 
He said city traffic studies show that traffic volume in the central part of 
Pasadena has increased 25% in the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
When the 210 Freeway was built through Pasadena in the early 1970s, he said, 
the state estimated that traffic volume would reach 153,000 vehicles a day by 
1990. But the freeway was carrying 175,000 cars a day in 1984 and 221,000 in 
1987, nearly a 26% increase in just three years. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the congestion on the freeway, Barnhart said, motorists sometimes 
avoid it by taking surface streets, adding to Pasadena's congestion. 
</P>
<P>
The newest effort by the city to ease congestion is the creation of a 
transportation plan for city employees that will go into effect in October. The 
plan will apply to at least 400 to 500 management employees initially, but the 
city hopes to include the remainder of the work force after negotiating with 
unions. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena's new program for city employees is a response to the South Coast Air 
Quality Management District regulations requiring organizations with more than 
100 employees to file ride-sharing plans by January. But the Pasadena plan goes 
beyond the minimum AQMD requirements and is intended as a model for other 
employers, Barnhart said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that it is important for the city to gain participation by employees 
because, "we can't ask a private employer to do something we're not willing to 
do ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
The city's program to limit commuter traffic began in 1986 with the adoption of 
a trip reduction ordinance requiring the preparation of ride-sharing plans for 
new or substantially expanded office, industrial, medical and retail buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas C. Reilly, city transit/commuter services coordinator, said the city 
has tried to impose its requirements without inflicting economic hardship. The 
city allowed the eight-story office tower at Plaza Las Fuentes on Los Robles 
Avenue and the 11-story office building at 301 N. Lake Ave. to accept one 
tenant each, but is barring further occupancy until transportation plans are 
adopted. Reilly said that developers of both projects have submitted revised 
transportation proposals that are being reviewed and could be approved soon. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Operating Engineers Trust Funds, developer of the office 
building at 301 N. Lake Ave., and at Maguire Thomas Partners, developer of 
Plaza Las Fuentes, said they have not been inconvenienced yet because they do 
not have other tenants waiting to move in immediately. 
</P>
<P>
The new 13-story Gateway Plaza, an office building at Lake Avenue and the 210 
Freeway, has received approval for a plan that calls for hiring a full-time 
transportation coordinator to serve tenants, reserving special parking areas 
for van pools and car pools, providing a bike rack for commuter cyclists and 
promoting public transportation to workers in the building. The company 
estimates it will cost $100,000 to implement the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The city's plan will cost more than $1 million a year, but about 75% of the 
amount will come from imposing charges for parking. Employees now park free. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parking Incentives 
</P>
<P>
Solo drivers who use city parking facilities would pay $45 a month for parking 
but would receive a $20 transportation allowance, meaning a net cost of $25 a 
month. Each employee in a two-person car pool would pay $10 a month for 
parking, and those in a car pool of three or more persons would park free, 
pocketing the transportation allowance. 
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for the city to develop a system to arrange ride-sharing, offer 
free fuel to van-pool and car-pool vehicles, provide free monthly bus passes, 
and make arrangements with a health club for bicycle commuters to have a place 
to shower and change clothes. Persons who walk to work would be eligible to 
receive $200 a year in cash or gift certificates. 
</P>
<P>
The city, which found that employees who must bring their children to 
child-care facilities are more reluctant to car pool, will pay them up to $40 a 
month if they join car pools and drop off their children on the way to work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Emergency Rides 
</P>
<P>
As an additional inducement, commuters who share rides or take public transit 
to work would be guaranteed a ride home in a city car or taxi if they become 
ill or have a family emergency. 
</P>
<P>
The plan also calls for the city to provide a shuttle-bus service for employees 
who live near their jobs and to shift about 10% of the work force to a four-day 
workweek. 
</P>
<P>
Barnhart said the city plans to participate in a Transportation Management 
Assn. for the Civic Center area. The city and the Chamber of Commerce will each 
contribute $30,000 and apply for a matching $60,000 grant from the state 
Department of Transportation to create the association to share information and 
resources with employers in the central business area.

STATE PANEL INVESTIGATES CAMPBELL OVER GIFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SACRAMENTO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state's Fair Political Practices Commission has launched an investigation 
into whether state Sen. William R. Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights) violated 
campaign contribution laws by not reporting a gift of free limousine service 
and the source of a $5,000 honorarium arranged for him by a Louisiana asbestos 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
The agency is also investigating whether the consultant -- Gordon Goldman, 
president of Asbestos Environmental Controls Inc. of New Orleans -- may have 
violated state law by not registering his company as a "major donor" after the 
firm gave Campbell more than $10,000 in 1988, FPPC spokeswoman Sandra Michioku 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell has declined to comment and Goldman has not commented on the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
A former employee of Goldman's firm has charged that Campbell repeatedly put 
pressure on officials in the state architect's office to continue employing the 
company. In an interview, Goldman called the charges by former employee 
Terrence McQuade an "absolute falsehood." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Donations to Campbell 
</P>
<P>
"Consider the source," Goldman continued, noting that McQuade was recently 
fired. "I've never gotten into any problem with the state architect's office, 
so I've never asked (Campbell) to intercede." 
</P>
<P>
Michioku said the investigation could take "a couple of months. We're looking 
into the alleged violations of the Political Reform Act, but this isn't to say 
there has been any determination yet," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's investigation comes after published reports that Campbell's 
top aide, Jerry Haleva, repeatedly pressured state officials last year to 
continue using the New Orleans firm. Meanwhile, Goldman and his company donated 
$27,000 to Campbell in 1987 and 1988, including $16,000 from the company alone 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Other favors arranged by Goldman included free limousine service for Campbell 
and his aide during the 1988 Republican National Convention in New Orleans, and 
a $5,000 speaking engagement before a New Orleans Jewish group, Friends of 
Lubavitch Inc. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Goldman acknowledged that he had loaned Campbell a car and a 
driver "just for a day" during the convention. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$600 Service 
</P>
<P>
Goldman said the limousine service cost about $600, but Campbell failed to list 
the gift on his financial disclosure forms. Michioku said state law requires 
elected officials to list all gifts in excess of $50, as well as the true 
source of all income and contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell listed the source of the $5,000 speaking fee as the Friends of 
Lubavitch, although the rabbi in charge of the group has maintained that the 
honorarium was paid by anonymous donors active with the group. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the political practices investigation, State Architect Michael 
J. Bocchicchio Sr. said Monday that his office is launching a review of its own 
to see if the state should sever its current contracts with Goldman's firm 
because the company allowed its registration for asbestos removal work to lapse 
on June 10. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the state architect's office, which administers a program to 
remove the carcinogenic material from state buildings, said the state architect 
would issue a letter giving the firm until Monday to re-register. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman said Tuesday that his company has already applied for re-registration, 
which will be completed in about 30 days. He also said he contacted the state 
architect's office on Tuesday to tell state officials of the pending 
re-registration. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman's company was one of several hired by the state architect's office in 
recent years to test public buildings, then develop plans for removal of 
asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3 Conversations 
</P>
<P>
Bocchicchio said Monday that he talked to Haleva three times last year about 
Goldman's participation in the asbestos removal program, including a June, 
1988, telephone call made by Haleva on behalf of the New Orleans consultant. At 
the time, Bocchicchio's office was threatening to cut off any business with 
Goldman because the consultant had failed to register his company with the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
But the consultant complied, registering his company by June 10, 1988, and 
Bocchicchio said he had no more contact with Campbell's office until October, 
1988. At that point, Bocchicchio said he called Haleva as a courtesy to say 
that Asbestos Environmental Controls had missed important work deadlines and 
that the state would be canceling some contracts with the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Bocchicchio said he hasn't heard from Campbell's office since then, adding that 
he didn't interpret his contacts with Haleva last year as pressure or undue 
influence. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, records with the state's Department of Industrial Relations show 
that Goldman's company has allowed its registration to lapse although it has 
hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of state contracts through 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman said his national consulting firm had been working with the state 
architect's office since 1985, 18 months before he met Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
The firm, with offices in Riverside, New Orleans and Chicago, develops plans 
for removing asbestos from buildings and monitors the process, by taking air 
samples, for instance. But the firm does not remove the hazardous material.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: THE REGION; 
</P>
<P>
EXTRA BUSES REST ON RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The governing board of Foothill Transit Zone on Tuesday authorized its 
executive director to purchase up to 60 buses if a favorable court decision is 
reached in a lawsuit that challenges the transit zone's existence. 
</P>
<P>
A monthlong trial ended last week in Los Angeles Superior Court with Judge Eli 
Chernow taking the case under submission. Chernow has 90 days to issue his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
The case concerns the county Transportation Commission's approval and funding 
of the Foothill Transit Zone, which operates two bus routes formerly operated 
by Southern California Rapid Transit District in the San Gabriel Valley. 
Foothill, which contracts with private bus companies to provide service at a 
lower cost than the RTD, is scheduled to take over 12 more RTD lines over the 
next two years. 
</P>
<P>
The RTD unions maintain that Foothill constitutes an illegal breakup of the RTD 
and that the commission lacked the authority to establish the rival transit 
operator. 
</P>
<P>
The new buses are needed to implement Foothill Transit Zone's plans to add 
another three RTD lines by January, 1990. Foothill Executive Director William 
P. Forsythe said a ruling is needed within the next two weeks to allow the 
manufacturer time to produce the buses. 
</P>
<P>
If no ruling is issued by then, he said, the transfer of the lines would be 
delayed at least another six months.

NEIGHBORHOOD PROFILE: WEST NEWPORT: FOCUS; 
</P>
<P>
WEST NEWPORT HAS THE RHYTHM OF SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Clipboard researched by Susan Davis Greene, Dallas Jackson and Rick 
VanderKnyff / Los Angeles Times; Graphics by Doris Shields / Los Angeles Times

<TEXT>
<P>
The essence of Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys echoes through the beaches and 
neighborhoods of west Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
It is an inspired setting where bodies bronze under soft blue skies and a 
gentle warming sun . . . where friends and soon-to-be-friends play spirited, 
impromptu games of volleyball in the sand . . . where boats majestically dot 
the horizon while languorously keeping rhythm with the ocean. It is an 
environment where surfers, as abundant as out-of-state license plates, dare 
uncompromising waves that swallow the novice and propel the expert back to 
shore. 
</P>
<P>
It is a community where specialty shops -- hawking mostly T-shirts, bathing 
suits and surf boards -- peacefully coexist with a diverse collection of 
restaurants from seafood to ethnic. The dress code is simple: Neckties and 
panty hose are non grata; swimsuits, shorts, jeans and black wet suits with 
shocking pink, lime green or sunny yellow day-glo stripes separate local from 
tourist. 
</P>
<P>
West Newport is an older, better-heeled section of the city, and many consider 
it to be one of its best kept secrets. Though the community is perched directly 
on the Newport-Inglewood fault, residents remain unfazed. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time in the late 1920s and 1930s when the city could barely give 
away the land at $100 per lot. Several unwitting individuals and subdividers 
did speculate on the land and built homes, but then the rains came and washed 
out the houses. Swampland is like that. 
</P>
<P>
Since the flooding cycle was bound to recur, some homeowners weighed the cost 
of frequently rebuilding against the cost of taxes and decided to let the land 
revert to the city. However, those pioneers who chose to stay in spite of the 
flooding were vindicated when the Santa Ana River Flood Control Channel was 
built in 1957. Property values in the area jumped to $15,000-$16,000 during the 
1960s, $24,000-$27,500 in the early 1970s, to the current staggering price of 
$500,000 for an oceanfront lot. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, many of the homes in west Newport are old-money family dwellings 
that have been passed on from generation to generation. Instead of selling and 
realizing a quick, sizable profit, today's generation has opted instead to 
remodel and update its inheritance. Consequently, the area is a charming, 
eclectic combination of old and new. It's not unusual to find a quaint cottage 
nestled between an older two-story stucco and a newer wood-and-glass 
contemporary. 
</P>
<P>
While hanging on to the family legacy may be rooted in sentiment, the sprouts 
of free enterprise are blossoming as well. It is these closely held properties, 
remodeled or not, that make rentals a huge business. Because the older homes 
were originally built with bachelor units on the lot, current owners have the 
luxury of living in the main house while generating as much as $500 to $1,800 
per week in rental income. 
</P>
<P>
There is one complication: Because residents are staying and because there is 
such a large influx of non-residents who need to be accommodated as well, the 
overcrowding has rendered parking a headache and traffic a nightmare. Add to 
that the ritual of "cruising" Balboa Boulevard on weekends, and the situation 
becomes, as one native describes it, "hectic." 
</P>
<P>
City planners have taken steps to solve the problem by requiring two enclosed 
parking spaces per unit on all new construction. And there are special driving 
lanes for residents, whose orange stickers allow them to bypass normally 
congested areas. But it isn't a panacea. The building restrictions apply only 
to new construction; the older homes, most of which do not have garages or 
carports, are exempt. In many neighborhoods, then, on-street parking is the 
only kind available. 
</P>
<P>
But there are prices to pay and compromises to be made in any situation. And 
the life style of west Newport Beach apparently makes it all worthwhile to 
many. So residents grumble quietly as they park the car, turn off the ignition, 
gather their belongings, lock the door and begin the half-mile trip home.

COUNCIL HANDLES SHORTFALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To make up a $260,700 shortfall in the 1989-90 city budget, the City Council 
has approved three belt-tightening moves, City Clerk Linda Gair said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting last week, the City Council voted to eliminate the entire 
six-member code enforcement division, saving $260,300, Gair said. The 
division's work, including enforcement of weed-abatement laws and issuance of 
city licenses, are being absorbed by other city departments, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The council also reallocated money from two other sources to make up the 
deficit. Gair said the city will save $25,000 on lower liability insurance 
premiums, and $28,400 will be transferred from the city's retirement fund 
surplus. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Leo King said the staff cutbacks were necessary to keep the city 
financially afloat. "We were getting to the point where we were borrowing from 
Peter to pay Paul." He said the code enforcement division was top-heavy with 
supervisors and its work could be performed by other departments.

GOLFERS GATHER FOR TOURNEY GIVING 'HIGH-PRIORITY' HELP IN FIGHT AGAINST BREAST 
CANCER

"You got to be kidding me," said Deacon Jones, letting loose with a rumbling 
laugh. "You think I'm crazy enough to tell you that?" 
</P>
<P>
Settled in a parked golf cart on a sun-baked patch of grass at the Links at 
Monarch Beach, Jones was laughing -- and balking -- at the simple question: 
What's your handicap? 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you that, because you'd write it down, and what if I lied a 
little?" joked the pro football Hall of Famer. "Listen, people talk about going 
out to relax and play golf. I play golf, but I don't know about relaxing -- 
this game is work." 
</P>
<P>
It was all work and plenty of play Monday at the Links, where 120 golfers 
gathered for a celebrity golf classic and tennis tournament benefiting the 
Orange County chapter of High Priority, a national women's networking group 
devoted to the prevention, early detection and treatment of breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The competitions were part of a two-day fund-raising drive that included a 
Sunday night buffet at the Ritz-Carlton hotel (a chip shot from the Links) and 
a post-athletics banquet and awards show, also at the Ritz-Carlton. 
</P>
<P>
The events -- ranging in price from $50 per person for the Sunday buffet to 
$250 per person for the whole shebang -- were expected to raise $25,000, said 
event chairwoman Sharon Paisley. 
</P>
<P>
Among sports superstars checking in with golf chairwoman Betty Belden-Palmer 
was Raiders' quarterback Jay Schroeder, who said he and his wife, Debbie, took 
up golf last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't hit as far as he can," said petite Debbie, gazing up at her husband, 
"so I try to get him on the par 3s." 
</P>
<P>
Peter Ueberroth -- who with his wife, Ginny, was honorary chairman of the first 
High Priority golf classic three years ago -- teed off with his father-in-law, 
Nick Nicolaus, and son-in-law Bill Booth. 
</P>
<P>
"My father taught Peter how to play," Ginny said, "and now Peter's teaching 
Bill. So I guess we've got a family tradition going here, don't we?" Ginny 
scooted back home instead of playing this year to spend time with daughter 
Vicki and grandchild Nicholas Booth. 
</P>
<P>
For Richard Agnew, a Newport Beach obstetrician, the day of blue sky and 
treacherous greens provided "a great excuse to get out of the office." 
</P>
<P>
For former baseball great Don Sutton, "Golf is like therapy." 
</P>
<P>
"If you do well on the course," said the self-described golfaholic, "you pat 
yourself on the back. If you do badly, you kick yourself a little lower down." 
</P>
<P>
George and Judie Argyros were named honorary co-chairmen of the benefit. Among 
committee members were Olivia Johnson, Charlene Immell, Claire Burt, Pepper 
Stone, Jeanne Lorti, Ledge Hale, and Wanda Cobb, who founded the local chapter 
of High Priority.

ANN CONWAY: DONORS PUT IN A GOOD FRAME OF MIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY

<TEXT>
<P>
Who framed Juan Cabrillo? 
</P>
<P>
Bowers Museum, that's who. 
</P>
<P>
A statue of the explorer holds court in a beloved fountain in the Santa Ana 
museum's tree-studded courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
But on Saturday night, the fountain had been drained of water (with 700 pounds 
of crushed ice poked with bottles of bubbly taking its place) and Cabrillo was 
surrounded by a gilt-drenched frame. 
</P>
<P>
The frame-up, one of several on the museum grounds, was all part of the fun at 
"La Fiesta . . . Framing Artistic Fantasies," a $150-per-person benefit that 
attracted 300 guests and brought $60,000 to museum coffers. 
</P>
<P>
Arriving guests, elegant in black-tie and chic cocktail wear, were directed, 
not into museum portals as in Fiestas gone by, but through a huge gold frame 
that led them directly into the courtyard. Closed since January, the museum is 
undergoing a $9.2-million renovation. It's expected to reopen in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"We're on the threshold of exciting development," said Josie De Falla, museum 
director. "But while we're developing, we're also flourishing. We want people 
to continue to come and enjoy our classes." 
</P>
<P>
During a lengthy cocktail hour (7 to 8:30), guests had several options: pluck 
delectables such as chicken and mushroom strudel from silver trays; throw on a 
smock and create a mini-masterpiece on one of several blank canvases set up 
under a portico; bid on artworks created by such celebs as tennis star Vic 
Braden (who created a "Life Clock" drawing, which depicted his 60 years of 
living -- "It's only seemed like an hour" Braden wrote on the canvas) or state 
Sen. Marian Bergeson (her work showed a flag-waving woman holding a briefcase. 
Its title -- "I Make Better Laws Than Pictures), or just plain hobnob and sip 
champagne under the stars. 
</P>
<P>
Fashions, frequently conservative at north county locales, were on the cutting 
edge: Judy Fluor Runels, a co-chairwoman, sported the newest of the new looks 
-- billowing black chiffon cocktail trousers topped with a goldenrod jacket 
trimmed in passementerie. Donna Karlen, event chairwoman, wore an ultra-chic 
black cocktail suit by Paris designer Sonia Rykiel and a cluster of fresh 
gardenias in her hair (fresh gardenias -- in the hair, on the gown or on the 
table -- are very in at black-tie affairs). Harriet Harris, outgoing president 
of the Bowers board, carried a magenta-colored sheared beaver coat. "It was an 
anniversary present," she said, beaming a megawatt smile at her husband, Bill. 
Newport Beach lawyer Marlena Fox wore -- what else? -- a fox boa over her silk 
dress. 
</P>
<P>
As for those masterpieces that were supposed to be created by guests, well, 
while they were simply adorable, Frank Stella has nothing to worry about. 
Karlen used felt pens to create stick figures of her committee members. Dick 
Runels sketched a bigger-than-life wine glass. And Ria Carlson and Katie Beall 
created a scribbly work that combined Big Ben, a grinning jack-o'-lantern and a 
tree that looked like an arrow (or was that the Eiffel Tower?). 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Consey, director of the Newport Harbor Art Museum, didn't even try. "I 
can't draw," he said. "But my wife, Susan, paints houses!" 
</P>
<P>
Dinner, catered by Pennington and set up on a parking lot-turned-French 
pavilion, featured cream of asparagus soup, Caesar salad, filet mignon with 
rosemary-cognac sauce and champagne poached pears in ginger Zabaglione 
(presented in a chocolate frame, but of course). 
</P>
<P>
Also on the scene: Arthur Strock, new president of the Bowers board of 
governors; former heavyweight contender Ken Norton (who contributed an artwork 
to the silent auction); Mike Nason and Vikki Vargas; Judy and Rogue Hemley; 
Marilyn and Tom Nielsen; Paul Apodaca, and Jim Delamore (who designed the white 
tulip and rose centerpieces). Roger Torriero was honorary chairman. Irwin 
Schatzman and Thomas Wilck were co-chairmen with Runels. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the committee: Nadine O'Connor, Nanuca Benitez, Carol Campbell, Laura 
Fischer, Bradd Linn, Teryl McEfee, Mary Anne Miller, Dori Owen and Duci 
Ziegler.

EXTRA $4.1 MILLION; 
</P>
<P>
MENTAL HEALTH FUNDS MAY GET STATE BOOST 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County's hard-pressed mental health programs could receive an extra $4.1 
million next year under a proposal put together by state legislators during the 
waning days of their budget deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
But the money -- part of a $75-million legislative package to bolster mental 
health programs throughout the state -- would still leave the county slightly 
below the state average in dollars given for care of the mentally ill, 
preliminary figures show. 
</P>
<P>
And at that rate, services for the mentally ill in Orange County would improve 
only slightly over the strained level of services currently available, said 
Timothy Mullins, the county's director of mental health. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County is seen as a wealthy county that doesn't need the scarce state 
resources," Mullins said Wednesday. "But the world we provide services to gives 
us a view that is 180 degrees different from that. We have the same tales of 
people waiting for services that you hear in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Perturbed that its reputation for wealth has left it on the short end of mental 
health funding, Orange County last month filed suit against the state in an 
effort to restore lost, state-subsidized hospital beds for mental patients. A 
hearing on a preliminary injunction is scheduled today in San Diego Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
By filing suit, Orange County has joined the growing ranks of disgruntled 
"underfunded" counties that, weary of unsuccessfully politicking to get money 
from Sacramento, have reverted to legal action to claim what they believe is 
their fair share of mental health funds. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County -- which ranks substantially lower in mental health funding 
than Orange -- has filed two suits since 1986 to shake loose more money, and in 
March, 1988, won a preliminary injunction that forced the state to increase the 
number of psychiatric hospital beds from 32 to 71. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno County, second to the bottom in funding, has also filed suit against the 
state, and Riverside County is reportedly interested in joining at least one of 
the legal actions as an intervenor. 
</P>
<P>
The rush to court has sent reverberations through Sacramento, where lawmakers 
decided this year to bolster a mental health budget that virtually everyone 
agrees has long been neglected. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the $760 million set aside as part of the regular budget for the 
state's Department of Mental Health, the Legislature also decided to throw in 
an extra $75 million taken from the state's general fund and from increases in 
tobacco taxes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Underfunded Counties Targeted 
</P>
<P>
Not only was the extra money intended to help a department that has lost 
financial ground since the early 1980s, when the state's population began to 
burgeon, but it also was supposed to be targeted for counties such as Orange, 
which traditionally have been underfunded. 
</P>
<P>
One plan, approved by the state Senate and endorsed by the Conference of Local 
Mental Health Directors, would have plowed at least 50% of the excess money 
into underfunded counties -- a formula devised in a bill authored several years 
ago by state Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim). That formula would have given 
Orange County $6.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
But that plan was revised considerably in a budgetary conference committee, 
which is convened each year to reconcile differences between the Assembly and 
Senate versions of the budget. On the committee sit Assemblywoman Maxine Waters 
and Sen. Alan Robbins, both powerful Democrats from Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the new figures came out Wednesday, Orange County had lost a 
portion of the new funding. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's share was cut to $4.1 million in extra funds, which when 
combined with the rest of the mental health budget would translate into $28.40 
per county resident, or 26th among the 57 county agencies receiving funds 
(Sutter and Yuba counties are combined). The state average with the excess 
funding is $29.80. 
</P>
<P>
In comparison, the compromise would give Los Angeles $22.4 million in new 
funds, or $32.41 per person. At the top of the list is Marin County, which 
would receive a total of $66.27 per person under the proposed legislative 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doubling of Caseworkers 
</P>
<P>
Mullins said he already has plans for the $4.1 million in extra money if 
approved. Part of it will go toward a 36-bed, 90-day treatment program for 
adults. Other chunks of money will help pay for treatment of adolescents with 
serious emotional disturbances, as well as doubling -- from four to eight -- 
the number of caseworkers for the geriatric outpatient program, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The mental health budget will go before the Senate today, where it is expected 
to be approved and be sent to Gov. George Deukmejian for final consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour, a member of the conference committee, said Wednesday that he will urge 
the governor to use his veto power to thwart Los Angeles interests and 
redistribute the excess funds as intended under the 50% plan first approved by 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PROPOSED STATE MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING 
</P>
<P>
Listed below is the proposed per capita mental health spending by county in the 
1989-90 state budget. The base funding represents $760 million distributed via 
normal channels by the State Department of Mental Health. Additional funds were 
taken from Prop. 99 (the tobacco tax) and from the state's general fund.

MAYOR OF ANAHEIM ANNOUNCES A NEW SITE FOR SPORTS ARENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU FULTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although the city has not yet acquired the land, Anaheim Mayor Fred Hunter said 
Wednesday that the seven-acre Phoenix Club property north of Katella Avenue at 
Douglass Road will be the site of the city's planned $85-million sports arena. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter's unbridled declaration came shortly after the Board of Supervisors 
agreed to lease Anaheim 17 acres along the Santa Ana River, next to the Phoenix 
Club land. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nothing but 'go' from the Phoenix Club," Hunter said of the social 
organization for local German families. 
</P>
<P>
Private developers of the proposed 21,000-seat arena agreed that obtaining the 
county lease is an important step in placing the structure northeast of Anaheim 
Stadium, but they cautioned that the Phoenix Club remains only one of several 
sites under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
The county land is crucial because it could be used in combination with other 
sites or perhaps serve as the site for the arena itself, said Neal Papiano, a 
Los Angeles lawyer and spokesman for the developers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is very good news, absolutely," Papiano said of the 4-0 vote by the 
supervisors. "This gives us much more flexibility." 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the city's preferred site would be a combination of the county 
land and the Phoenix Club parcel. 
</P>
<P>
The city is trying to negotiate a land swap with the Phoenix Club in which the 
group's land north of Katella Avenue would be exchanged for nine acres of city 
land at Weir Canyon Road and La Palma Avenue, plus relocation costs, Hunter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Club officials did not return calls seeking comment. However, the membership is 
scheduled to vote on the land swap in July, said James Ruth, Anaheim's 
assistant city manager and lead arena negotiator. 
</P>
<P>
The lease agreement Wednesday bolstered the hopes of Anaheim arena proponents 
who had suffered two serious setbacks in May: 
</P>
<P>
The city of Santa Ana announced plans to build a similar arena at Edinger 
Avenue and Lyon Street. A spokesman for the Santa Fe Pacific Realty Corp., 
which owns the site, said his company has worked out a tentative agreement with 
developers to build the facility. The company may release details of the 
agreement next week, said spokesman Bruce Ibbitsen. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the supervisors dumped plans to sell Anaheim 7.6 acres of county land on 
which the city had most wanted to build the arena. In a 3-2 vote, the board 
decided the land could not be sold because it had to be preserved as a possible 
site for a new county jail. 
</P>
<P>
But Wednesday's vote means "we're back on track," Hunter said. "It's good news 
for the city." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a giant milestone in the project," added Ruth. "We're really pleased." 
</P>
<P>
Under the 55-year lease agreement, the County Flood Control District would 
receive 5% of the net profit from the arena and 5% of the net profit from 
parking revenue. The county estimates that revenue could amount to $132 million 
over the life of the lease, according to a staff report. 
</P>
<P>
Papiano said the Anaheim arena-development group plans to select the two best 
sites by the end of July so they can be included in a required environmental 
impact report that must be approved before the arena can be built. 
</P>
<P>
The lease of county land allows the arena to be built on a number of possible 
sites, he said, depending on what additional land the city acquires. The 
options include the Phoenix Club land, the county land itself and a parcel on 
Douglass Street. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors' vote in May eliminated the possibility of building the arena 
on the initially preferred site, the Anaheim trash-transfer station on the 
northwest corner of Katella and Douglass.

'GOING TO BE WALKING';

<P>
UPBEAT MAN FIGHTS BACK FROM INJURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
For 25-year-old Danny Shaw, life was as warm and mellow as the Southern 
California sun. 
</P>
<P>
He had an auto mechanic's job he loved, in the city he loved, San Clemente. "It 
was all there for me: swimming, surfing, trips to Mexico. It was great," he 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on April 9, that dream life turned into a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
While cooling off in the ocean near Doheny Beach during that month's 
100-plus-degree heat wave, something happened. "It was a freak accident," Shaw 
said. "I still don't know what happened, but all of a sudden I was floating on 
my back." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hit Head on Sand 
</P>
<P>
Shaw somehow had struck his head on the sand and had broken a vertebra, leaving 
him paralyzed from the waist down. "I woke up in the Mission Community Hospital 
intensive care unit," he recalled. To his horror, the active, fun-loving 
bachelor learned that he could not walk and even had trouble using his hands 
and fingers. The world, he said, suddenly looked very bleak. 
</P>
<P>
But now, three months later, Shaw is in rehabilitation at Long Beach Memorial 
Medical Center, and he is cheerful and upbeat. One big reason, he said, is 
because of good friends from San Clemente. Those good friends are staging a 
Dance for Danny this Saturday night in San Clemente to raise money for Shaw, 
who has no hospitalization insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"San Clemente is a great place," Shaw said in a hospital interview. "It's 
paradise. I'm going to be going back there. And I'm determined I'm going to be 
walking." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw's primary nurse in rehabilitation, Gretchen Leathers, said she thinks the 
young man is progressing amazingly well because of his optimism. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Great Attitude' 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a great attitude," Leathers said. "It's a matter of adapting and 
realizing that, hey, you can do what you want to do -- you just have to change 
your ways a little bit. And Danny's got that real good attitude. He's very 
motivated, and he's going to be able to be independent because he is so 
motivated." 
</P>
<P>
Leathers smiled, and added: "Danny also has a great sense of humor. I suppose 
you've heard about his famous food fights? Well, he and his roommate (in the 
hospital) every now and then throw food at each other. Now, of course, their 
aim is too good, but I like the idea. It shows these guys are really trying." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Kenneth Parsons, director of the spinal cord injury program at Long Beach 
Memorial, said: "The impact of spinal cord injury can be overwhelming for some 
people, but some people, like Danny, can ride it through. He has great energy 
in tackling his rehabilitation functions. I think that Danny's a particularly 
courageous fellow in the way he's handling his situation." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw propels himself around the medical center's vast rehabilitation wing in a 
wheelchair. "At first, I had trouble even sitting up for a few minutes, but now 
I can get around in this thing pretty well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A tall (6-foot-1), slim man, Shaw at one time looked gaunt after his accident. 
He went from his normal weight of 175 down to 
</P>
<P>
140 pounds. "But now I'm back to 160 pounds and getting stronger as I work in 
rehab," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw's long brown hair is pulled back in a pony tail. It's normally not so 
long, he said. "I was due for a haircut when this accident happened . . . and . 
. . well, it's hard to get a haircut with this thing." 
</P>
<P>
The "thing" is a metal, circular-shaped brace that Shaw must wear as part of 
his therapy. "It's called a halo, and it keeps my head straight," he said. "I 
get to take it off July 19, and I can hardly wait." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw's halo and metal braces don't look like standard hospital issue. "That's 
because I painted them," Shaw said with a grin. "I have fire flames painted 
here on the front and candy stripes on the poles in back. Hey, you got to have 
a sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
Although he now seems to be an outgoing, witty person, Shaw said he was shy 
during his years at San Clemente High School, "and I wasn't in a whole lot of 
organizations." He graduated from high school in 1982 and took a job with 
Shadetree Automotive Repair in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
"The job is fun, the pay is good, and I really liked it," he said. "I learned 
to surf about three years ago, and the job allowed me lots of time for that." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw said he has always been a good swimmer and knowledgeable about the 
treacherous ways of the ocean. He said he therefore is at a loss to explain 
what happened to him on April 9. 
</P>
<P>
"I was down at the beach for a barbecue with my boss and some friends on that 
day, and it was very hot, during that heat wave, so I went in to cool off," he 
said. "I don't remember diving into the surf or anything like that. And the 
surf was real low that day. I don't know what happened. I just remember 
floating on my back -- feeling like I was drowning -- and yelling and saying a 
few choice words. I remember flapping my arms and catching a wave and landing 
on the beach. Then somebody dragged me up the beach, and then the next thing I 
remember is waking up in the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
Friends from San Clemente have frequently visited him and sent him cards and 
letters, Shaw said. "They're some really nice people, such as Katie Arons. 
Katie's been a friend since junior high," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Arons is spearheading the Dance for Danny fund-raising event that will be held 
from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. Saturday in the San Clemente Community Center at the 
intersection of Del Mar and Seville streets. The suggested donation is $20 per 
person, Arons said, and she added that San Clemente residents and businesses 
have "been really great in supporting this. . . . It makes me very proud to be 
a San Clementean." Businesses have donated many door prizes that will be given 
during the dance, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to have 500 persons attend, and that way we'd raise about $10,000 for 
Danny," Arons said. "Danny's been so brave in trying to live with his 
paralysis, and the way he jokes and laughs -- well, it's the same old Danny." 
</P>
<P>
Arons said advance tickets may be purchased at the Shadetree Automotive Repair 
in San Clemente or at the Dana Point Inn. "Some people have asked how they can 
send in donations if they can't attend the dance, and we're telling them to 
mail checks to Friends of Danny Shaw, 32901 Staysail Drive, Dana Point 92629," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw, during the hospital interview, said the outpouring of love and support 
from people in Orange County has meant a lot to him as he tries to adjust to 
his new life. 
</P>
<P>
"The little things are the hardest for me," he said. "Things like learning how 
to put on my clothes and how to shave myself. But I'm learning, and it's nice 
to have these friends. 
</P>
<P>
"I really love San Clemente. Just a perfect place. When I leave the hospital in 
September, I'm going to Oceanside to live with my mom for a while. But I want 
to go back to San Clemente eventually, and eventually that's where I'll be. I 
may be struggling with a cane, but I'll be walking those streets in San 
Clemente."

FOR BOY PILOT, FAMILY IT'S A RED-LETTER DAY IN RED SQUARE

<P>
Tony Aliengena of San Juan Capistrano upstaged Lenin on Wednesday, drawing 
hundreds of Soviets out of the line to the communist leader's tomb as Tony and 
his family unfurled a 1,000-foot friendship scroll in the middle of Red Square. 
</P>
<P>
The event represented a dramatic climax to a day in which the 11-year-old 
aviator and his family met with top Soviet officials in the Kremlin, though not 
with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. They presented the scroll and a 
sackful of 75,000 pen-pal letters as good-will gestures from children in the 
United States to their counterparts in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The boy pilot left John Wayne Airport on June 5, beginning a 17,000-mile 
around-the-world journey that is scheduled to bring him back to Orange County 
on July 21. After leaving Moscow, he will fly across the Soviet Union through 
Siberia and on to Alaska, where he will then head south over Canada and along 
the U.S. coast. 
</P>
<P>
The scroll, signed by more than 250,000 U.S. schoolchildren, originally was to 
be unfurled Thursday but, buoyed by the praise heaped upon them by Soviet 
officials in the Kremlin meeting, Tony's father, Gary Aliengena, suggested that 
the scroll be unveiled immediately. 
</P>
<P>
So the Aliengena delegation, dressed in their Sunday best and flanked by an 
entourage of a dozen people, marched directly out into Red Square, set up the 
scroll on a stand and began unfolding it slowly as bystanders gazed in 
puzzlement. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people standing in line to view Lenin's tomb, one of the more 
popular attractions in Moscow, directed their attention toward the Americans 
who were stretching the scroll across the square under a Wednesday afternoon 
canopy of threatening clouds. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, while struggling to hold the scroll still against gusts of winds, 
Gary Aliengena frantically called out to bystanders to help. 
</P>
<P>
"You Soviets, please help us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
First a few bystanders knelt to help hold the scroll and then dozens more 
pitched in, forming the leading edge of a line that in some places was 10 
people deep. 
</P>
<P>
Striding the length of the scroll after it had been unfurled, Aliengena 
recounted the names and places on the scroll, which was signed by 
schoolchildren when Tony flew across the United States on the first leg of his 
around-the-world flight. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best one. . . . Look, thumbprints," Aliengena said to Gennady 
Alferenko, director of the Soviet agency sponsoring Tony's trip through that 
country, as he pointed proudly to where Indiana elementary school students had 
drawn faces on their thumbprints. 
</P>
<P>
"And look at this one," he added, gesturing at where seven smiling students 
from Montana were shown on a photograph. "This is the whole school." 
</P>
<P>
Aliengena seemed on the verge of tears as he recounted the cities where the 
signatures had been gathered and reminisced over the months in which he and his 
wife, Susan, had stayed up nights putting together pieces of the scroll that 
had been mailed in from schools all over the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Alferenko, director of the Soviet Foundation for Social Inventions, a 
non-government agency, also appeared moved by the display. 
</P>
<P>
"Unbelievable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet citizens who crowded around the scroll at first did not know what it 
was about, but upon seeing the thousands of signatures in awkward child-like 
scrawl, they quickly caught on. 
</P>
<P>
"By children, yes?" a grizzled old man asked Aliengena, who nodded. 
</P>
<P>
A younger man in the crowd asked a Times reporter: "You are American reporter? 
Tell the people in the United States we want peace." 
</P>
<P>
Even the threatening sky failed to dampen the spirits of Aliengena and his son. 
With raindrops falling intermittently, Aliengena ordered that the scroll be let 
out another 20 feet to its very last inch. 
</P>
<P>
Tony, dressed in a gray pinstripe suit, ran back and forth along the length of 
the scroll checking it out. 
</P>
<P>
The public display lasted only 20 minutes. Alferenko explained that Red Square 
security officials had instructed that the scroll be rolled back up within that 
time. But Alferenko added that it was highly unusual for the security officials 
to have granted permission for such a spontaneous display in Red Square where 
public events normally require lengthy advance approval. 
</P>
<P>
The overwhelming show of support in Red Square softened the disappointment that 
the Aliengenas experienced in not being able to meet with Gorbachev, who was 
reported to be busy elsewhere in the Kremlin presiding over the new Supreme 
Soviet. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev instead dispatched the man in charge of Soviet youth affairs and 
three other officials to formally receive Tony, his family and selected members 
of his entourage in a lavishly appointed reception room used by the Soviet 
president to meet foreign dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting with Valery Tsybukh, president of Gorbachev's Parliamentary 
Committee for Youth, lasted 40 minutes and included good-will speeches by both 
the Soviets and the Americans, facing each other summit-style across a long 
conference table. 
</P>
<P>
"We are happy to meet the participants of such an incredible friendship flight 
and we see that Friendship Flight 89 means that all of the people of the United 
States can look forward to good understanding between our countries," Tsybukh 
said through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole world is looking at Tony now and we are also following the stories 
of his flight," he continued. "This meeting was organized by Soviet President 
Gorbachev. He is well informed about the idea of the flight and he appreciates 
it very much. He said it was a symbol of friendship between the children of our 
countries." 
</P>
<P>
"And he also said it was an example of people diplomacy, and he appreciates 
very much your idea Tony, and he said that it was a great contribution to peace 
between our two countries. . . . In this very room there are high-ranking 
international meetings; it is also symbolic that in this room we are ready to 
accept the friendship letters." 
</P>
<P>
Aliengena, speaking for his son, expressed awe that a meeting in the Kremlin 
was finally taking place. 
</P>
<P>
"In our wildest dreams we never thought that we would be sitting in the Kremlin 
right now," he said. "Every one of the quarter of a million children who 
touched this scroll feel closer to the Soviet children than they felt a year 
ago. It became my family's dream that there was more to our countries than our 
leaders. So it became people-to-people diplomacy." 
</P>
<P>
Aliengena then presented Tsybukh a certificate from the U.S. Air Force 
auxiliary to commend the Soviet Union for its cooperation with the United 
States using satellite technology to locate lost airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Susan, also gave Tsybukh a gift package containing two model swallows 
from the family's hometown of San Juan Capistrano. And Tony's 10-year-old 
sister, Aliana, presented him with a Minnie Mouse doll. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to give this to Gorbachev's granddaughter," Aliana said. 
</P>
<P>
Tsybukh in turn presented a book each to Tony and Aliana, detailing the Soviet 
Union's achievements in space flight. 
</P>
<P>
Tony and his entourage had already learned some of that country's involvement 
in spaceflight after having toured the Exhibition of Economic and Agriculture 
Achievement, which contains a space exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
After the tour, the group went to the nearby Central Political Pavilion where a 
Soviet version of the friendship scroll was unfurled in a lobby for Soviet 
children to sign. 
</P>
<P>
"Let the peace be all the time. All of the people of the Soviet Union are 
looking for it," 13-year-old Natasha wrote in Russian. 
</P>
<P>
"No war!" another youngster wrote above a drawing of an nuclear bomb blast. 
</P>
<P>
In a Wednesday morning tour of the offices of Pioneer Pravda, a children's 
newspaper with a circulation of 11 million, Tony and his family were serenaded 
by 20 members of the Young Pioneers, a Communist Party youth organization. 
</P>
<P>
Strumming guitars and clapping hands, they sang rousing renditions of such 
tunes as "It's a Small World" and "We Shall Overcome." 
</P>
<P>
"It is so nice to see young heroes like you," Olga Grekova, editor of Pioneer 
Pravda, said in welcoming Tony. "We want to tell you about our life by way of 
song." 
</P>
<P>
The youngsters, who got a chance to question the boy aviator, came away from 
their meeting impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that Tony came to (the) Soviet Union not only because he (wanted) to 
fly, but because he (wanted) to learn about life in the Soviet Union and to 
make friends with some of our children," said 14-year-old Marina Grashina, an 
eighth grader who was leading the song.

JAIL ESCAPEE ACCEPTS EXTRADITION FROM S.D. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A suspected jewel thief who masterminded an escape from County Jail in Santa 
Ana last year agreed Wednesday to drop his fight against extradition and return 
for prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Taylor appeared in court in Rapid City, S.D., and agreed to the 
extradition on the condition that California officials be advised of his fear 
that he will be harmed or killed if he is returned to the state's correctional 
system, Assistant State's Atty. Rod Oswald said. 
</P>
<P>
Oswald added that he has relayed the message to California officials, who told 
him they would ensure Taylor's safety. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, 36, was arrested in May for allegedly trying to sell a large number of 
loose diamonds at a Rapid City pawn shop. 
</P>
<P>
He faces charges of robbery, kidnaping, rape, grand theft and escape. At the 
time of the breakout from the recreation area of the men's jail in Santa Ana, 
Taylor was being held in connection with the theft of more than $2 million in 
jewels from Southern California stores over the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
Two accomplices arrested with him in South Dakota have been sent to Iowa to 
stand trial on charges of robbing a jewelry store there.

PANEL OKS BILL BARRING CIVILIAN USE OF MCAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The House Armed Services Committee in Washington on Wednesday approved a 
massive defense-spending plan that among other things would bar commercial 
aviation at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) sponsored an amendment to the 1990 
defense authorization bill that would short-circuit efforts to ease 
overcrowding at John Wayne Airport by permitting commercial aviation to make 
joint use of the El Toro military airfield. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial flights from the military base have been advocated by some in Orange 
County as a way to relieve overcrowding at John Wayne, and the El Toro airfield 
is one of several sites under consideration by the Airport Site Coalition, 
which is seeking an alternative airport in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Passage of the authorization bill and the amendment by the full House is 
virtually assured, congressional sources said. The measure would also have to 
clear the Senate before it could become law.

PREGNANCY 'CRISIS' CONFERENCE URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Declaring that thousands of poor women in Orange County face "substandard" 
maternity care, local March of Dimes officials on Wednesday called for a 
community meeting to resolve what they termed "the present crisis." 
</P>
<P>
March of Dimes leaders Fred Owens and Dr. Ralph W. Rucker also warned that 
unless more hospitals agree to treat the indigent pregnant women, "we face the 
prospect of reverting to a two-tiered level in the standard of medical care -- 
substandard for the poor and excellent for the rest of us." 
</P>
<P>
They invited hospital administrators, the Board of Supervisors, state 
legislators and advocates for the poor to attend an open forum July 13 at the 
Westin South Coast Plaza hotel on "Access to Maternity Care in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
The March of Dimes' call for a meeting is at least the fifth such request by 
various groups since June 2, when UCI Medical Center in Orange announced a 
controversial policy to turn away some women in labor because its obstetrics 
ward is overcrowded and conditions are "unsafe." The medical center cares for 
most of the county's indigent pregnant women, many of them Latinas who have had 
no prenatal care. 
</P>
<P>
UCI officials have hoped that other hospitals would sign Medi-Cal contracts, 
sharing some of the indigent-patient load, but some hospitals have expressed 
concern about Medi-Cal's low reimbursement rate. Also, some had wanted 
"obstetrics-only" contracts that state Medi-Cal officials have not been willing 
to allow. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, state Health Services Director Kenneth W. Kizer invited 
hospital administrators and others concerned about maternity care in Orange 
County to meet with him. Depending on what that meeting -- or series of 
meetings -- produces, Kizer and his officials "may or may not carry a 
particular message" to the commission that sets Medi-Cal rates, Kizer told The 
Times Orange County Edition this week. 
</P>
<P>
Also in separate discussions, officials from the Hospital Council of Southern 
California, the county's Obstetrics and Gynecology Society and United Way of 
Orange County have reacted to UCI Medical Center's "obstetrical diversion" 
policy, expressing concern about improving access to maternity care. Owens, the 
March of Dimes board chairman, said he was aware of the other meetings or 
requests for meetings. But, he said, "it seems that a lot of people are 
talking, but nobody's talking together." 
</P>
<P>
Owens said he would like to get lawmakers -- particularly county supervisors -- 
"to realize there is a problem. . . . When women are denied access to maternity 
care, that seems to be a pretty serious problem." 
</P>
<P>
Added March of Dimes Community Service Director Dorothy Andrews: "We're seeing 
a community denial that there are problems in Orange County affecting poor 
women and children. . . . We thought it was time we acted as a neutral party to 
call all the other factions and organizations together at least as a first 
step" toward improving maternity care for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
The March of Dimes letter was sent to about 100 individuals and organizations, 
including all five county supervisors, Orange County representatives in the 
state Legislature, UCI's Medical School dean and vice chancellor of health 
sciences Walter Henry, the administrators of 15 hospitals, several prominent 
obstetricians as well as advocates for the indigent. 
</P>
<P>
Henry could not be reached for comment Wednesday, but Wade Rose, an assistant 
dean at the medical school, applauded the idea of the March of Dimes' forum. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very positive sign to have people in the community reaching out to 
solve this very serious problem," Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
What various organizations describe as a crisis has been building for some time 
as more hospitals in Orange County dropped their Medi-Cal contracts and most of 
the county's obstetricians have declined to treat Medi-Cal patients because the 
reimbursement rate was so poor. 
</P>
<P>
The situation peaked in early June when UCI Medical Center officials said that 
their obstetrics ward was crowded and "unsafe," with fetal monitors in short 
supply, infections frequent among women having Cesarean deliveries and some 
mothers forced to deliver in the hall. 
</P>
<P>
Since the medical center's "obstetrical diversion" policy was announced, the 
hospital -- whenever it was full -- has turned away pregnant non-patients at 
curb-side and handed them a map to other area hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the hospital has announced four "diversions" and turned away two 
pregnant women, hospital spokeswoman Elaine Beno said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically the maternity ward, designed to handle 250 deliveries a month, may 
handle more than 600 births this month since women who have had prenatal care 
at UCI clinics have continued to be admitted during "diversions."

BOARD TENTATIVELY OKS INCOMPLETE COUNTY BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors on Wednesday tentatively adopted a $2.9-billion budget 
for the fiscal year that begins July 1. The vote was the first in a budget 
process that will continue into August. 
</P>
<P>
The budget anticipates a $24-million deficit, which county officials hope can 
be erased with the distribution of state funds now being debated in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
John Sibley, associate county administrative officer in charge of the budget, 
said the county hopes to learn this week whether the state Legislature will 
approve a block grant that could give Orange County more than $19 million. 
</P>
<P>
County officials have warned about the possibility, if the grant is not 
approved, of drastic program cuts that could include hundreds of layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's vote, taken without debate, was actually a legal technicality to 
satisfy a law that requires the county to adopt a balanced budget by June 30, 
even though the county is still waiting to learn how much money it will receive 
from the state. 
</P>
<P>
The budget adopted Wednesday -- which does not fully fund all departments for 
the complete year -- will allow the county to operate during the first weeks of 
the new fiscal year until a final version of the budget can be passed. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors are scheduled to hold hearings during the last week of July on 
the budget for the 1989-90 fiscal year. The budget must be adopted in its final 
form by Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
The awkward budget schedule -- in which the hearings are held after the fiscal 
year begins -- is a frustration forced on the county because it is so dependent 
on state funds. The Legislature has not adopted its budget, so the county can 
only estimate parts of its budget. 
</P>
<P>
The County Administrative Office released the proposed budget last week. The 
board's vote was unanimous, with Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez absent. 
</P>
<P>
In other action Wednesday, the supervisors: 
</P>
<P>
* Approved new contracts with two of the county's employee bargaining units 
representing about 1,100 technicians, heavy machinery operators, maintenance 
employees and welfare eligibility workers. Both two-year contracts, which have 
been ratified by the union memberships, call for a 4.3% salary increase 
starting Friday and another increase on June 29, 1990, that will range between 
3.5% and 5% depending on the previous year's consumer price index. In addition, 
the county increased its contribution to the unions' funds for disability and 
life insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Both contracts were scheduled to expire Friday. The contracts for two other 
unions -- the 9,000-member Orange County Employees Assn. and the county 
firefighters -- are also scheduled to expire Friday. Russ Patton, the county's 
personnel director, would not comment on those negotiations. There are about 
12,000 union employees in the county government and almost all of the contracts 
are scheduled to expire this year. 
</P>
<P>
* Adopted a fee of $362 for a massage therapy license after the Sheriff's 
Department proposed last October that the cost be raised to $939. Several 
massage therapists told the supervisors Wednesday, however, that the rate is 
still too high. 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff's proposed increase reflected the county's new cost-recovery policy 
intended to prevent taxpayers from subsidizing special industries or 
individuals. Last October, the supervisors asked for a study of the sheriff's 
proposed rate increase when dozens of Orange County massage therapists 
protested the rate hike in a meeting. The county auditor subsequently reviewed 
the actual cost for background checks and license preparations and recommended 
the fee be set at $362 for new permits and $218 for renewals.

ALBERT RAZO IS USING FOOTBALL TALENTS TO LEAVE LIFE OF DRUGS, VIOLENCE BEHIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE LOWERY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His heart on his sleeve, his family name tattooed on his arm, Albert Razo 
talked about smoking marijuana as a third grader and PCP as high school 
freshman. He talked about starting fights over such pressing issues as "Who are 
you looking at?" and about being arrested. He talked about a bad guy he knew a 
couple years back, a guy who looked, spoke, even threw a football the way he 
did. He talked about himself. 
</P>
<P>
He talked about his family name, which he's proud to show above the likeness of 
an Indian woman on his left arm. It's also a name that, in the past two years, 
found its way into newspaper stories about his older brother Jose, who went to 
Harvard but came back to La Habra and was recently convicted of robbing 
fast-food and convenience stores. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Razo, 18, talked about his life in La Habra, the only kind of life he 
has known and one he's now itching to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporter: You signed to play football at Cal State Northridge, a good Division 
II program. But there are some people who think you have the potential of being 
a Division I quarterback. They say that if you got some seasoning at Fullerton 
College that in two years you'd be a hot recruiting prospect. 
</P>
<P>
 Razo: I decided it would be best for me to get away from this area. There are 
a lot of different things around here that, if I went to Fullerton, would maybe 
stop me from pursuing my education. There are a lot of distractions, my 
friends, my peers, the gang members I used to be involved with. There's so many 
different things that I've tried to overcome and that I don't want to deal with 
in college. I have to get away." 
</P>
<P>
Albert Razo has a strong right arm. So strong that during the North team's 
workouts for Friday's Orange County High School Football All-Star game several 
receivers complained about the speed of Razo's passes and the marks they left 
in their chests. 
</P>
<P>
Razo, probably the North's starting quarterback, hopes his arm is strong enough 
to take him away from all he did to himself and all that was done to him in La 
Habra. 
</P>
<P>
In the worst of times he was smoking dope, giving up on school and ready to 
bash anyone's face who looked at him in a manner that he didn't feel fitting. 
</P>
<P>
"You didn't mess with Albert, you kept your distance," said Dave Gutierrez, a 
teammate of Razo's on the La Habra High football team who will play receiver on 
the North team. "He was his own crowd, he followed only himself, and you better 
stay out of the way." 
</P>
<P>
His third day on the La Habra campus -- he had transferred from Servite High 
early in his sophomore year -- Razo got into a fight and was suspended. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a bad guy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he could always throw. He could throw a junior-sized football more than 70 
yards while in elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
John Barnes, Los Alamitos' football coach and coach of the North team, marveled 
at Razo's arm strength the first days of practice. Like others, including Razo, 
Barnes believes that Razo must improve on staying in the pocket and reading 
defenses before he becomes an exceptional quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"But all the raw tools are there," Barnes said. "He reminds me a lot of Dave 
Wilson, who was a raw thrower at Katella, then went to Fullerton College and 
really blossomed." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Wilson now plays for the New Orleans Saints. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Barnes had to be persuaded to put Razo on the team. Razo was hurt much 
of his senior year, posting his most impressive numbers as a punter. He 
averaged 46 yards a punt. But once Barnes got a look at Razo's passes, he knew 
he had something special. 
</P>
<P>
"He puts a lot on the ball," Barnes said. "To throw like that, I'm sure 
someone's had to work with him as a kid." 
</P>
<P>
But Razo said no one taught him. His athletic ability just came naturally. 
Unfortunately for him, his ability to get into trouble came just as naturally. 
</P>
<P>
He was arrested four times as a juvenile. Three times for fighting, once for 
being in possession of stolen property. He hung with a local gang in La Habra, 
though he said he was never initiated. He fought their fights at parties and 
smoked their dope. 
</P>
<P>
"They could be tough guys," Gutierrez said. "One day they might smile at you, 
the next they might stab you." 
</P>
<P>
By the end of his freshman year at Servite, Razo was near bottom. His grade 
point average was down to a 1.2, a D-average. He didn't pay attention in class, 
when he decided to go to class. He drove a motorcycle to school each day though 
he was still too young to get a driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
He felt fine when he was playing football -- he played on a Servite freshman 
team that also had linebacker Garrett Greedy (signed with UCLA) and running 
back Derek Brown (Nebraska) -- but away from the field he was alone. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a huge chip on my shoulder," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When Servite coaches told him at the beginning of his sophomore year that they 
were moving him from the backfield to wide receiver, Razo got permission from 
his parents to leave Servite for La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't play football for the 1986-87 school year, "just loafed around and 
got in a lot of trouble. I was constantly on the street." 
</P>
<P>
On the night of July 6, 1987 Albert's older brother, Jose, was arrested in 
connection with a series of armed robberies. That same night, Albert says he 
was smoking PCP, a highly toxic psychoactive anesthetic commonly known as 
"angel dust," with some friends. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that night changed everything for me," Razo said. 
</P>
<P>
Jose had been the Razos' Abel to Albert's Cain. Jose got good grades and was 
recruited by Ivy League schools, eventually attending Harvard in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
But by July of 1987 that all ended. 
</P>
<P>
"I had always looked up to him; I couldn't believe it," Albert said. "I didn't 
know what was going on. My whole attitude changed about everything, it was like 
day and night." 
</P>
<P>
Razo says that a month after Jose's arrest, he was totally off drugs. He sought 
advice from Bob Rau, then La Habra's coach. Rau told him his football talent 
could take him away, but that it would require something of Razo. 
</P>
<P>
"He said I had to change crowds," Razo said. "It was real hard to do, I was 
close with some of those guys." 
</P>
<P>
But he made the break, approaching the gang's leader, who Razo said is now in 
prison, and told him: "I have to get away from you because I got talent." 
</P>
<P>
Rau told him he had to go to class, that he wouldn't be suiting up at La Habra 
with a 1.2 average. 
</P>
<P>
"I never really liked classes like English, but I looked at my situation and 
said to myself, 'You need to like English,' " Razo said. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of his junior year, Razo's grade-point average had shot up to 2.85. 
</P>
<P>
His junior season he platooned at quarterback. As a senior, he was going to run 
the show himself. He had made such an impression as a junior, he was receiving 
mail from such schools at Nebraska, Oregon State and Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
But a week before the start of practice, he broke his collarbone while riding a 
motorcycle in the desert. Lying in the sand, waiting for a friend to help him, 
Razo lost himself in a swell of tears. This, he thought, was the end. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing I thought was, 'There goes my career,' " Razo said. "Then I 
broke down." 
</P>
<P>
The letters stopped, but he did get back in time for the third game of the 
season, just in time to reinjure his collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, it was a real frustrating year," Razo said. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of years before, Razo might have escaped by quitting. But Jack 
Nicholls, La Habra's coach, said Razo always came to practice and worked hard. 
</P>
<P>
"He helped all the younger quarterbacks," Nicholls said. "I could leave Albert 
with the quarterbacks and know that he would get them through a drill. From 
what I've heard about him, he probably wouldn't have done that a few years 
ago." 
</P>
<P>
To Razo's amazement, Cal State Northridge recruited him. It's not the 
out-of-state distance he was hoping for -- "I wanted to get as far away as 
possible," -- but it was away from La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very proud of who I am today," Razo said. "It's hard to know all the stuff 
I've been through. I've seen both sides of the world, good and bad." 
</P>
<P>
And he has lived in both worlds. Asked what the young tough would think of 
Albert Razo today, eager to go to college, Razo said: "He'd think he was an 
idiot, a nerd." 
</P>
<P>
And what if Albert Razo saw the tough? 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't think anything, I'd just walk straight on by him." 
</P>
<P>
The interview nearing its end, Razo leans forward and his eyes widen. He's 
talking about how he changed his life and went from no future to a Division II 
scholarship. His chest inflates while he talks about being asked to speak to 
incoming La Habra freshmen about the importance of going to class and doing the 
right thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporter: What would you like to see happen for Albert Razo in the next few 
years? 
</P>
<P>
 Razo: I'd like to see Albert Razo graduating from college with a Master's in 
criminal psychology. I want to help juvenile delinquents. I want to be a 
probation officer and go into probation counseling. I want to help the young 
kids. This might sound strange, but I'd like to come back to La Habra and help 
the young Albert Razos."

SOUTH'S CRAYTON GETS ANOTHER CHANCE TO IMPRESS AT HIS CHOSEN POSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Estrus Crayton of Santa Ana High School tried for two seasons to convince 
coaches and teammates that he was a running back. 
</P>
<P>
One future teammate had his doubts the first day Crayton walked into Santa 
Ana's gymnasium after moving to Southern California from Texas as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
"I was walking through the gym with my uncle and some guys asked me if I played 
sports," Crayton said. "I told them I was a running back. 
</P>
<P>
"Robert Lee (the Saints' 1,000-yard rusher) looked at me and said, 'Running 
back? You can forget it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to Santa Ana High, Estrus Crayton. Now prove that you belong on the 
same field with some of the best athletes in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't easy. Crayton spent most of his junior season getting acclimated to a 
new school, playing cornerback and trying to talk his coaches into giving him 
an opportunity to run with the football. 
</P>
<P>
"I begged them to put me in at running back," Crayton said. "Finally, I got my 
chance one day in practice." 
</P>
<P>
Crayton ran several sweeps, accelerating around the corners and breaking into 
an open field. Afterward, Lee told him, "You made them (defense) look real 
stupid." 
</P>
<P>
Crayton had impressed Lee. The next step was the coaching staff. He became a 
third-string running back in practice, then finally got a chance to run in a 
playoff game against Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Crayton rushed for nearly 100 yards in a lopsided victory and many were 
predicting he would replace the graduating Lee at tailback as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
Before his senior year, Crayton worked out with his uncle, Jim Lyday, three 
days a week lifting weights and running in the deep sand of the Santa Ana River 
bed to increase his leg strength. He rode an exercise bicycle 10 miles every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
He anticipated a productive senior season at running back. Instead, he 
alternated with junior Garner Hicks at tailback. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like every time I made a good run and felt like I was getting 
started, I was back on the sideline," Crayton said. "I felt I should have 
played more." 
</P>
<P>
Crayton gained 639 yards in 93 carries, averaging 6.9 yards per carry and 
scoring eight touchdowns. He also started at cornerback and was tried as a wide 
receiver in an early season loss to Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
"I caught one pass for three yards in that game," he said. "Nothing worked that 
night. The next day, the coaches asked me what I wanted to play. I told them I 
was a running back and decided to prove it in league (play)." 
</P>
<P>
Crayton was convincing in leading Santa Ana to its third straight Century 
League title and was later named the most valuable player of the Century 
League. Crayton had silenced his critics as an established running back. Well, 
almost. 
</P>
<P>
Crayton was selected to play for the South team in the 30th Orange County 
All-Star football game on Friday night in Orange Coast College's LeBard 
Stadium. But he was originally picked as a defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
"I think coaches take one look at me (6-foot-3, 180 pounds) and automatically 
think I'm a receiver or a defensive back," he said. "I know defensive players 
look at me and think, 'I'm going to kill that skinny guy.' " 
</P>
<P>
But once again, Crayton has made an impression. He will be the starting 
tailback for the South team in a game that showcases the top talent in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people see him as a wide receiver or defensive back," said South 
Coach Dave Holland of Corona del Mar. "But he's shown good explosion and the 
ability to turn the corner quickly at running back. He's the best back in 
camp." 
</P>
<P>
On game night, there will be another test for Crayton. He will likely be 
compared to the North's highly publicized starting tailback, Derek Brown of 
Servite. Brown established a county single-season rushing record as a senior 
and has signed a letter of intent to play at Nebraska in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"People are saying this game is going to be the Derek Brown Show, but I feel I 
have something to show people," Crayton said. "I'm hoping people will look at 
me and say, 'Who's that guy?"' 
</P>

RESCUE DEAL SET FOR 20 FAILED BANKS IN TEXAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Banc One Corp. of Columbus, Ohio, agreed Wednesday to take over 20 failed banks 
of MCorp, a Dallas-based holding company with $13 billion in assets, federal 
bank regulators said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. refused to discuss details of 
the transaction before a news conference today, but private analysts believe 
that the deal will constitute one of the largest bank rescues ever, involving 
an infusion of about $2 billion in federal money. 
</P>
<P>
The agency, which insures commercial bank deposits, said Banc One will assume 
management of the failed banks July 5. Its chairman, John B. McCoy, will assume 
the chairmanship of the McCorp banks under the name of Bank One Texas, it said. 
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman confirmed that Banc 
One had been selected in "a highly competitive process," but he did not 
elaborate. A number of other major banks considered making bids, including 
Wells Fargo &amp; Co. in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seized in March 
</P>
<P>
FDIC spokesman Alan Whitney said Banc One is investing $500 million in the new 
Texas operation, but he declined to say how much the government is injecting. 
Many of the big banks in Texas have failed or been taken over because the 
state's real estate market collapsed after crude oil prices plunged in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Hammered by huge losses in 1988, the MCorp banks were seized by the government 
in March and have been operating under the name of the Deposit Insurance Bridge 
Bank. That new entity was formed when regulators declared 20 MCorp subsidiaries 
insolvent, leaving five subsidiary banks still operating under the private 
ownership of the original holding company. 
</P>
<P>
If analysts are correct about the $2 billion in federal assistance, MCorp will 
become the nation's third-largest commercial bank failure, ranking behind 
Continental Illinois of Chicago in 1984 and First Republic Bank of Dallas in 
1988. They required initial government pledges of $4.5 billion and $4 billion, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
A Banc One spokesman in Columbus said it was not clear how much federal help or 
overall funds the deal would require. The bank has made an estimate of the 
cost, which he declined to disclose. 
</P>
<P>
The FDIC will take over problem loans and "bring the balance sheet to a zero 
position," the spokesman said. Banc One, he added, will manage Banc One Texas 
for 120 days, identifying the problem loans and inflated assets, before the 
purchase is completed. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Wells Fargo, other prominent banks that showed interest in 
failed MCorp banks were NCNB Corp., based in Charlotte, N.C.; New York-based 
Chemical Banking Corp., the nation's sixth-largest banking company; First City 
Bancorp of Houston -- itself the recipient of an earlier federal bailout, and 
the New York-based leveraged buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. It 
is not certain whether banks actually submitted bids for MCorp. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disappointment Voiced 
</P>
<P>
The announcement marks another setback in the expansion plans of Wells Fargo, 
which sent a team of auditors to inspect MCorp's books last December but 
reportedly never submitted a formal bid. Wells Fargo lost a bid last year to 
buy First Republic Bank, which was sold to NCNB. Wells Fargo officials could 
not be reached Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Buddy Kemp, chairman of NCNB Texas, the new name of First Republic Bank, said 
his firm was disappointed with the FDIC's decision. He added: "We remain 
committed to serving the Texas market by expanding our franchise throughout the 
state." 
</P>
<P>
Kohlberg Kravis said in a statement: "We are extremely disappointed. We've 
spent an enormous amount of time, resources and effort on this matter." It 
noted that its proposal would have maintained an independent bank in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Avoided Buyout Deals 
</P>
<P>
Banc One, the 25th-largest banking company in the nation, has pioneered retail 
innovations. It was one of the first banks to offer automated tellers and has 
been a leader in the packaging of obligations owed by credit card holders to 
sell as securities to investors. It allocates more of its earnings to research 
and development than most banks. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other large banks, it has shunned participating in corporate buyout 
deals. Instead, its bread and butter has been credit cards, auto leasing and 
student loans. Still, it's had some missteps. An effort to create a 
computerized home banking network fizzled. 
</P>
<P>
With the Texas acquisition, Banc One obtains an extensive branch network with 
offices in Abilene, Austin, Houston, Ft. Worth, Dallas and other cities in the 
state.

IRVINE CO. PICKS MARRIOTT TO BUILD 1,100-ROOM HOTEL; 
</P>
<P>
O.C. RESORT WOULD BE 2ND IN SIZE ON CALIFORNIA COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Irvine Co. has signed an agreement with the Marriott hotel chain to build 
and operate the second-largest resort hotel on the California coast. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,100-room hotel would be the first of as many as three resorts to be built 
on a hilly, three-mile stretch of Orange County's Irvine Coast, between Newport 
Beach and Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel is one of several luxury resorts on the drawing boards or already 
opened along the Southern California coast, which some developers hope will 
become an international playground like the French Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
Marriott Corp., based in Bethesda, Md., outbid every major resort hotel chain 
in the nation to build the hotel, according to Irvine Co. insiders who 
requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The deal has been in negotiation for seven years between billionaire Donald L. 
Bren, chairman of the Irvine Co., and Marriott Chairman J.W. Marriott Jr., 
Irvine Co. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But the agreement is subject to the Irvine Co.'s approval of Marriott's design 
for the hotel, which is expected to cost around $220 million. 
</P>
<P>
It's also contingent on Marriott winning approval for its designs from Orange 
County government officials. 
</P>
<P>
If the hotel is built by Marriott, it would be among the chain's largest 
resorts. The largest is a 1,500-room hotel in Orlando, Fla. Under the 
agreement, the Irvine Co. will own the hotel while Marriott builds and operates 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The largest resort hotel on the California coast is also a Marriott property: 
the San Diego Marriott Hotel and Marina, which has nearly 1,400 rooms, 
according to Laventhol &amp; Horwath, a consultant to the hotel industry. 
</P>
<P>
Marriott has hired the Los Angeles office of RTKL Associates Inc., a Baltimore 
architect, to design the new hotel. 
</P>
<P>
There are no firm designs yet for the new building, which the Irvine Co. hopes 
to complete by 1993. The hotel is described only as a luxury resort big enough 
to accommodate business groups and conferences. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Coast is the largest piece of undeveloped coastline in Orange 
County, and was the subject of a long battle between the company and 
conservationists over its use. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides eventually compromised, and the company scaled back its plans for 
the area and won approval from state and local government. 
</P>
<P>
The company has government approval to build 2,100 hotel rooms, two golf 
courses and 2,600 houses on the bare hills, which loom above the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed Marriott is only the latest hotel in Southern California's seaside 
resort boom. Since 1985, eight new hotels have been built along the coast, 
bringing the total to 21. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Occupancy Rate at 72% 
</P>
<P>
The number of rooms has leaped from 4,500 to 7,500 in the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the resorts manage to keep 72% of their rooms occupied, a rate higher than 
for Southern California hotels in general. 
</P>
<P>
As workweeks get shorter, incomes increase and more families have two wage 
earners, demand for resort hotels is expected to continue to rise, said Jim 
Burba, a hotel consultant for accountants Pannell Kerr Forster. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why all the big hotel chains are looking to expand their resort 
business," Burba said. 
</P>
<P>
The new hotels don't just draw business away from inland hotels, said Sandra 
Louvier, a hotel consultant at accountants Laventhol &amp; Horwath. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County already has two such resorts, the Ritz-Carlton in Dana Point and 
the Dana Point Resort, which "are bringing a lot of people into the county and 
creating a lot of new business," Louvier said. 
</P>
<P>
Two other big resorts are also under development in the county: the Monarch 
Beach Resort in Dana Point and the Waterfront in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The developers are trying to turn the Orange County coastline into a resort of 
worldwide renown, although hotel operators acknowledge that, so far, most of 
their guests hail from California. 
</P>
<P>
Marriott Corp., the world's largest hotel operator, entered the resort business 
in 1967 by buying a resort in Arizona. It now operates 18 resorts, including 
two big ones in the California desert. 
</P>
<P>
Three more are under development in Mexico, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Marriott has been a strong performer in the hotel industry, posting earnings of 
$232 million last year on sales of $7.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"They're very highly regarded, and known for operating some very upscale 
resorts," said consultant Burba.

THE BOTTOM LINE IS OFTEN TOP DOLLAR; 
</P>
<P>
ORANGE COUNTY HOMES FETCH SOME HIGH PRICES AT IRS' HIGH-PROFILE AUCTION OF 
SEIZED PROPERTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES STROUSE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Internal Revenue Service is enlisting one of the world's oldest desires to 
get the most from the properties it seizes from delinquent taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
It is the desire for a bargain, and the IRS is appealing to it by bundling up 
real estate parcels and selling them at high-profile auctions. But bidders 
looking for deals often end up paying top dollar. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get a large group of people together, people get excited. Auction 
fever is real," IRS auctioneer David Sherrell said before beginning an agency 
auction Wednesday in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Property-hungry bidders battled for six homes seized by the IRS for unpaid 
taxes. They paid a collective $500,000 for the residences, which included a 
triplex at Big Bear Lake and single-family properties in San Juan Capistrano, 
Laguna Beach, Mission Viejo and Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
The day before, almost a hundred bidders gathered at the IRS impound lot in 
Santa Ana to compete for three cars, including a 1973 Mercedes-Benz 450-SL that 
went for $14,000 -- nearly top dollar in the current market. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, a $300,000 home in San Juan Capistrano sold for $212,500 and the 
winning bidder said he still faces the cost of evicting the current residents. 
</P>
<P>
Such relatively high prices are what the IRS auctions are all about. 
</P>
<P>
"People come thinking they are going to pay 50 cents on the dollar just like 
they used to and they end up paying 90 cents," said Gary Johnson of West Coast 
Brokerage in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's auction almost 350 people -- two-thirds of them spectators -- 
had jammed into the Santa Ana Police Department auditorium by the time Sherrell 
started the action at 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
A number left after discovering that 12 of the 18 properties advertised for 
sale had been pulled from the block because the owners coughed up enough of 
their delinquent taxes to persuade the IRS to hold off. 
</P>
<P>
But the bidding among those who stayed was hot. Hundreds of bids were made on 
the six properties as more than two dozen IRS officers kept order in the crowd 
during the frenetic 90-minute session. 
</P>
<P>
But most of those who filled the room had come to study, not to buy. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the first time I've been to one of these auctions and I'm ready to go 
to a few more before I start bidding," said David Bland, an actor from Los 
Angeles. "Right now I'm going in blind." 
</P>
<P>
Those who bid and won generally were real estate brokers with experience at 
auctions. But even they were caught up in the heat of the bidding. 
</P>
<P>
"How much did I pay?" gasped Dod Bateman as Sherrell closed bidding on a 
property and declared him the winner. The Irvine real estate agent made the 
high bid and will pay $212,500 for a San Juan Capistrano house he says is worth 
$300,000. "Feel my pulse, it's at about 185," he said as the bidding ended. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the IRS Laguna Niguel district office, the nation's third 
largest, has moved into high-profile marketing of items seized for tax liens. 
</P>
<P>
The agency is peddling goods through newspaper advertisements, sealed-bid sales 
and auctions of everything from jewelry to luxury homes. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be that we only had three or four people show up at an auction, but 
now we count them in the hundreds," said Sherrell, an IRS revenue officer for 
almost 20 years and, since January, the agency's only full-time auctioneer. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting 65% to 70% more now for land than we used to, and that means a 
better deal for the taxpayer." 
</P>
<P>
The IRS keeps only enough from the sale of a seized property to pay the federal 
income taxes that are owed. Anything left over is given to the taxpayer, an IRS 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Prospective buyers are warned that, among other things, the foreclosed-upon 
homeowner has the right to buy back the property for six months after the 
auction. They also learned that they had to pay at least 20% down -- either 
cash or certified check -- immediately after the sale. 
</P>
<P>
The local bidding is part of a national "auction mania" among government 
agencies, according to George Chelekis, a Florida-based author who recently 
assembled a 700-page listing of auctions called "The Action Guide to Government 
Auctions." 
</P>
<P>
Government property holdings have exploded in recent years -- largely because 
of drug-related confiscations and tax seizures -- and agencies have shown 
increased savvy in peddling it, Chelekis said. Combined, federal agencies hold 
more than $400 billion in seized property. The IRS holds liens on more than 
800,000 properties, double the number it held in 1980, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County, because of its affluence and a correspondingly high debt level, 
accounts for a substantial chunk of the IRS seizures, Chelekis said. 
</P>
<P>
Sherrell said he was trained by two professional auctioneers in Kentucky last 
year. So far, he has set up 30 auctions in the five counties covered by the 
Laguna Niguel District -- San Bernardino, Riverside, San Diego, Imperial and 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
To boost attendance at the auctions, the Laguna Niguel office has increased its 
advertising budget and installed an auction hot line. And after more than 450 
people showed up for the first of the IRS' large real estate auctions in Santa 
Ana in March, the department put together a seminar for interested buyers. 
</P>
<P>
That class, held last week, drew more than 700 people. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS' next Orange County auctions are scheduled in September and November. 
Auctions also will be held next month in Riverside and San Diego counties.

FIRM FEARS 'THUGS' MAY GREET PICKENS AT JAPAN MEETING 
</P>

Officials of Koito Manufacturing Co. are bracing for a rambunctious general 
shareholder meeting today, anticipating that a cast of thugs will be on the 
scene to cause trouble and discredit management when American corporate raider 
T. Boone Pickens Jr. takes the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Takao Matsuura, Koito's president, told foreign journalists Wednesday night 
that he was "very concerned" about the possibility of a disturbance at the 
meeting caused by sokaiya, underworld gadflies whose specialty is disrupting, 
or controlling, shareholder meetings in an extortion racket unique to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Matsuura, whose face is gaunt, displayed a photograph of himself in a company 
brochure and said he had lost 8.8 pounds "because of the Pickens shock." 
</P>
<P>
Pickens rankled the Koito board and sent nervous ripples throughout corporate 
Japan when he declared in April that he had become Koito's largest shareholder 
after acquiring a 20.2% stake in the automotive parts maker, which is closely 
affiliated with Toyota Motor Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The flamboyant Texan demanded three seats on the Koito board and a voice in 
running the company, portraying his acquisition as a long-term, stable 
investment. Koito rejected the demands, contending that Pickens' aim was either 
a hostile takeover bid or "greenmail." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Pickens is in Japan again to promote his brand of shareholder democracy, 
bucking a system that gives managers unchallenged power and locks up most 
outstanding stock in the hands of friendly business allies. 
</P>
<P>
At the annual shareholder meeting scheduled for today, he is expected to hold 
Koito management to task for skimping on dividend payments and shaving profits 
too thin in contracts with Toyota, which has 45% of Koito's business and owns 
19% of the company -- the largest stake until Pickens came along. 
</P>
<P>
He also might remark on the closed nature of Japan's business world and 
financial markets, a politically charged theme he has taken up extensively in 
the United States recently while hinting that he may run for governor of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
"If the United States and Japan are going to improve their trade situation, and 
if Japan is going to compete in the global marketplace, Japanese corporations 
have to change," Pickens said at a news conference in Washington on Monday. 
"They can't stay locked up. We are demanding it, and more and more Japanese 
investors are demanding it." 
</P>
<P>
But the sokaiya could make it somewhat difficult for Pickens to articulate that 
demand in what promises to be a highly publicized forum today. 
</P>
<P>
Koito officials have learned through the trust bank that handles the company's 
share registration that there were 10 sokaiya and five members of an 
ultra-rightist organization listed as investors as of March 31, the end of the 
latest fiscal year. Anyone owning stock has the right to attend the 
shareholder's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Although both groups are reputed to be linked to a major yakuza, or organized 
crime family, it is widely speculated that one group would heckle management 
while the other would harass Pickens. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Denies Any Deal 
</P>
<P>
Ordinarily, sokaiya are employed by management to quell dissent and ensure that 
meetings run smoothly and end quickly. But they also heckle and filibuster when 
payoffs are not made, which has become more common in recent years as Japanese 
police have begun enforcing a law that prohibits companies from giving money to 
sokaiya. 
</P>
<P>
Tamotsu Aoyama, general manager of Koito's corporate administration and finance 
division, said emphatically Wednesday that the company had no contacts with 
sokaiya and had never had relationships with them in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Who, then, would they be working for? 
</P>
<P>
Koito is not accusing Pickens of conspiring with the squeeze artists. 
</P>
<P>
"The company has no reason to believe that Mr. Pickens has any connection with 
any sokaiya group," said a source close to management, who spoke on the 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
But the source suggested that the sokaiya were brought into the picture by 
Kitaro Watanabe, the auto dealer, real estate speculator and occasional 
greenmailer who sold the block of Koito shares to Pickens' Boone &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
"We think there's a lot going on here that Mr. Pickens doesn't understand," the 
source said. 
</P>
<P>
Koito, meanwhile, has shored up its defense team, hiring Nomura Wasserstein 
Perella &amp; Co., a Japanese joint venture of Normura Securities and 
Wasserstein, Perella &amp; Co. of New York. Wasserstein is a U.S. investment 
firm headed by merger and acquisition specialists who have successfully fended 
off Pickens in some of his takeover attempts. Koito also has retained the New 
York public relations firm of Kekst &amp; Co., a veteran of many U.S. corporate 
battles.

General Mills Inc.: The Minneapolis-based firm said fourth-quarter profit fell 
35% to $35.6 million because of a $22.1-million loss from discontinued 
operations. Sales rose to $1.44 billion from $1.25 billion a year earlier. The 
maker of cereals and other packaged foods also said full-year net earnings rose 
46% to $414.3 million. Sales rose to $5.62 billion from $4.98 billion in 1988. 
The 1989 earnings included a net gain of $169 million from the divestiture of 
operations -- including Eddie Bauer, Talbots, York's and Vroman's -- which was 
partially offset by a $70-million loss related to an accounting change.

3 HOLDERS LOSE BID TO POSTPONE TIME MEETING

Time Inc. won a minor skirmish in its battle against the takeover bid of 
Paramount Communications Wednesday when a Delaware judge rejected three big 
shareholders' motions for postponement of Time's annual meeting scheduled for 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, shares of Paramount surged again on heavy volume amid renewed rumors 
that the hostile bidder may find itself the target of a takeover attempt. Time 
has made a $70-a-share offer for Warner Communications as a defense against 
Paramount's bid. 
</P>
<P>
The shareholders -- Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass, Hollywood producer A. 
Jerrold Perenchio, and cable operator Cablevision Systems Inc. -- contended 
that Time hadn't properly informed shareholders about the events that have 
transpired since proxy materials were mailed May 22. Paramount made a 
$175-a-share bid for the company June 7, then increased it to $200 a share last 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The three shareholders contended that information on the bids -- and Time's 
rejection of them -- could affect voting on the four incumbent directors who 
are up for reelection at Friday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Deserve More Scrutiny' 
</P>
<P>
But Chancellor William T. Allen of Delaware Chancery Court, ruling from the 
bench, said a delay was unnecessary because nothing that could happen at the 
meeting could irreparably harm shareholders' interest. Even if the incumbents 
were voted out, he said, they would continue to serve temporarily until the 
next directors' meeting was convened. 
</P>
<P>
Allen said there may be merit to other complaints of the shareholders. The 
complaints "deserve more scrutiny than the court is able to give them in this 
setting," said Allen, noting that he is preoccupied with preparation for the 
July 11 hearing on the dispute between Paramount and Time. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount's shares jumped $3.375 to $62.875, with about 2.7 million shares 
trading hands. The volume, much of it in the last hours of trading, made 
Paramount the most active stock on the New York Stock Exchange. Time shares 
fell $6, closing at $157.25 on volume of about 1.3 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
Traders speculated that the movement might be because of new rumors that oilman 
Marvin Davis, broadcast mogul John Kluge or others were accumulating shares of 
Paramount in preparation for making a bid of their own. The talk was stimulated 
by a television report Thursday night in which financial columnist Dan Dorfman 
said outsiders were accumulating Paramount shares. Dorfman last week correctly 
predicted that Paramount would increase its offer for Time to $200 a share, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Garshofsky, a vice president at the Los Angeles arbitrage and 
money-management firm of Kayne, Anderson &amp; Co., said the pattern of 
movements in Paramount's stock was in some ways consistent with the idea that 
an outsider was stockpiling large blocks of shares. He noted that Paramount's 
stock has closed higher on days it might have been expected to decline, such as 
the two days on which the company announced its offers. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he added, the pattern "may be meaningless. . . . There may be 
nobody out there." 
</P>
<P>
In Manhattan, U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet said he delayed a decision on 
Time's complaint that Paramount's tender offer has misled shareholders into 
believing that the company's offer expires July 7. 
</P>
<P>
At the hearing, Time attorney John E. Beerbower argued that shareholders would 
feel pressured to tender their shares to Paramount by July 7, although 
Paramount officials have indicated elsewhere that the company has no intention 
of ending the offer at least until the July 11 court hearing in Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Ostrager, attorney for Paramount, contended that Paramount has informed 
shareholders in other documents that it will probably extend the offer. But he 
said use of the July 7 expiration date was not misleading, because under some 
circumstances Paramount might want to close the offer then.

Growth in some big U.S. cities appears to have slowed but the economies of 
several metropolitan areas across the country are maintaining momentum, 
according to a study released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The accounting firm Grant Thornton said its index of seven economic vital signs 
for two dozen U.S. metropolitan areas registered a negative reading in this 
year's first quarter. It was only the second time in 17 quarters that the 
growth yardstick has pointed downward. 
</P>
<P>
The index showed the average growth rate of 24 cities declined in the first 
quarter by 0.30 point from 1988's final quarter to 108.8. The previous decline 
occurred in the second quarter of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Nineteen cities posted declines in their individual indexes based on statistics 
collected for their areas. 
</P>
<P>
The other five posted various increases. The economies of San Diego, Houston 
and Miami showed the most improvement, while Los Angeles and Detroit displayed 
more moderate strength. 
</P>
<P>
Gains in retail sales and employment helped power economic growth in San Diego, 
Houston and Miami. By comparison, retail sales declined on average for all the 
cities studied while employment increased. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's gains in retail sales and employment were the highest of all the 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
Houston's economy improved for the fifth straight quarter, according to Grant 
Thornton, which said the achievement has been surpassed only by San Diego. In 
the 12 months ended March 31, Houston's economic growth was greater than that 
of all the cities studied except San Diego, Minneapolis-St. Paul and Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco, the only other California city studied by Grant Thornton, saw 
its first-quarter index value dip. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the spectrum, Baltimore's index value dropped the most of 
the 19 cities that posted declines in the first quarter. Baltimore was followed 
by St. Louis, Seattle, Chicago and Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
The economic indicators used to rank the cities include factory hours, non-farm 
employment, construction permits, retail sales, business starts and failures, 
and money supply.

Crack addicts who used to spill their life stories to Jesus Frias in a basement 
office of a Brooklyn hospital are now telling them to a computer instead. 
</P>
<P>
The traditional intake interview, through which the drug counselor gained 
insight into a new patient, has been replaced by a multiple-choice 
questionnaire that the patient fills out alone. 
</P>
<P>
A computer program converts the patient's answers to the 132 questions into a 
"narrative," a formulaic two-page biography. 
</P>
<P>
Frias, 34, said he understands why computers have taken over the initial 
interviews -- for one thing, they give counselors more time for other meetings 
with patients -- but he said something is lost without that first face-to-face 
contact. 
</P>
<P>
"When you ask the question, is your father or mother alive, and they say yes, 
even that yes tells you a lot. You can say, 'You don't sound too happy your 
father's alive.' " 
</P>
<P>
The automation of some phases of addiction counseling is part of a streamlining 
and simplification of jobs everywhere, made possible by technology and 
sophisticated management techniques. Critics call it "dumbing down." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Getting Lassoed 
</P>
<P>
Wisecracking short-order cooks are disappearing from the American scene, 
replaced by drones who answer to french fry computers. Electronic monitoring is 
squeezing out the folksy airline reservation clerks who tell callers that 
Vancouver is nice this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
Even stockbrokers, those cowboys of finance, are getting lassoed. Some big 
firms now decide centrally how and where clients should invest their money, 
reducing brokers to happy-talking functionaries. 
</P>
<P>
Office automation is "rising almost floor by floor to engulf higher and higher 
strata of white-collar workers," Barbara Garson wrote in a 1988 book, "The 
Electronic Sweatshop." 
</P>
<P>
Turning human work over to computers is not an inescapable part of the emerging 
knowledge economy. Many companies are moving in the other direction, trying to 
gain a competitive edge by encouraging employees to think independently. 
</P>
<P>
But there are powerful social forces behind human automation, including a 
shortage of skilled workers and management's innate desire for greater control. 
</P>
<P>
Counselors and administrators at the Poly Drug Clinic of Kings County Addictive 
Hospital say the computerization of intake interviews has brought greater 
efficiency and uniformity. 
</P>
<P>
The questionnaire developed by Auto Assess Inc. asks, for example, how much 
patients spend daily for drugs and what they do in their spare time. 
</P>
<P>
Another company's Psychological Screening Inventory requires patients to answer 
true or false to statements such as "I enjoy classical music," "Strange voices 
have spoken to me," and "Shooting is a good sport." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Finite Instrument' 
</P>
<P>
Computers translate the answers into neat statements containing sentences such 
as, "Client feels she is a normal drinker." Counselors are supposed to plug 
holes with a personal interview. 
</P>
<P>
When interviews were done in person, the write-ups tended to be messy and 
incomplete, especially when done by the less-educated counselors hired at a 
time when it was in vogue to use former addicts in rehabilitation. They also 
took two hours or more to do right. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a finite instrument like all, but the purpose is to save us time for the 
counselor," said the clinic director, Jerry Halloran. 
</P>
<P>
"The downside of it would be a counselor getting this back and filing it away 
and never looking at it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Crack, the highly addictive, smokable form of cocaine, is ravaging poor 
neighborhoods of Brooklyn. The success rate for treatment is low, especially in 
an outpatient clinic like the Poly Drug Clinic. Knowing a patient well can help 
a counselor head off predictable trouble, Frias said. 
</P>
<P>
The computerized reports are sometimes adequate, sometimes not, Frias said. He 
fears that they could be a temptation to laziness.

PEOPLE: LUCKY STORES' EX-CHIEF WILL JOIN SEQUOIA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
John M. Lillie, who stepped down April 30 as chairman and chief executive of 
Lucky Stores, will join a Northern California investment firm as of Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Lillie, 52, a Stanford MBA with experience in forest products, printing and 
bulk chemicals, will become a general partner of Sequoia Associates, with 
responsibility for seeking out acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
The other general partners are William D. Walsh and Robert A. Ferris, who 
worked with Lillie at Arcata Corp., a printing and redwood forest products 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Sequoia Associates, based in Menlo Park, has interests in printing, heavy 
equipment manufacturing, forestry and agricultural operations, food 
manufacturing, photographic supplies and training and education. 
</P>
<P>
It holds controlling stakes in a number of companies, including Pacific Fruit 
Growers-Packers in Wenatchee, Wash., and Sequoia Pacific Systems in Exeter, 
Calif., which prints labels, business forms and election ballots and builds 
ballot machines. It also prints the All-Star baseball ballot forms. 
</P>

While at Lucky, Lillie weathered a 1986 hostile takeover effort by New York 
investor Asher B. Edelman that prompted a dramatic overhaul of the Dublin, 
Calif., food retailer. To fend off Edelman, Lucky sold its money-losing Gemco 
stores, sold or spun off some specialty retailing chains and paid a one-time 
dividend to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Within months, Wall Street analysts began applauding Lucky's return to 
profitability. The company's successful policy of offering consistently low 
prices and shunning double coupons and other costly marketing gimmicks last 
year drew the unwanted attention of rival American Stores, which operates Alpha 
Beta. 
</P>
<P>
Last June, Lucky succumbed to a $2.6-billion acquisition by American Stores. 
Although Lillie was viewed as a possible contender for a top post at American 
Stores, that was not to be, and he resigned once it appeared that American 
Stores would win approval to merge Alpha Beta and Lucky under the Lucky banner. 
However, American Stores continues to be stymied by an antitrust challenge by 
California Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
Before joining Lucky in 1979, Lillie was president and chief executive of 
Leslie Salt Co. in Newark, Calif. Earlier, he was with General Paper Corp., a 
subsidiary of Boise Cascade Corp. MARTHA GROVES

Hughes Aircraft Co. has paid $1.29 million to settle claims that it mischarged 
costs for developing the M-1 tank's infrared target simulator, the Justice 
Department said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement includes $732,900 that Hughes had previously paid the Defense 
Department under the Pentagon's voluntary disclosure program that encourages 
defense contractors to report possible civil or criminal fraud, the department 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes, a Los Angeles-based subsidiary of General Motors, made the payments to 
settle government claims that it had mischarged development and marketing 
expenses of the target simulator to Army contracts that did not provide 
reimbursement for such costs. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement signed Monday also settles government claims that Hughes 
mischarged some labor costs, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
In return, the Justice Department agreed not to file suit under the False 
Claims Act, which could have subjected Hughes to triple damages if the 
government had prevailed in court.

<P>
The stock market, wavering through an up-and-down week, fell sharply Wednesday 
after a surprisingly large decline in May leading economic indicators raised 
fears that a sharp slowdown in the economy could lead to lower corporate 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, which had been down 20.49 on Monday and 
up 14.99 on Tuesday, dropped 21.63 to 2,504.74. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide trading 
of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 485 up, 997 down and 488 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 158.47 million shares, down from 
171.09 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
"Investors may have become somewhat concerned that the U.S. economy has slowed 
too much, which may hurt corporate earnings," said Charles Jensen, market 
analyst for MKI Securities. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported that the index of leading economic indicators 
fell 1.2% in May, for a drop that exceeded most advance estimates on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
That provided new evidence that the pace of the economy was slowing 
significantly, fulfilling a goal of the Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
But the response to the news in the credit markets was unenthusiastic. Rates on 
government securities actually rose as traders cashed in some of the recent 
gains in bond prices. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, brokers said, the leading indicators were not warmly welcomed by 
traders who have been worrying that a slowing economy might be setting the 
stage for a recession and a slump in corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
Talk has also increased lately that earnings at many multinational companies 
are likely to suffer before long as a higher dollar cuts into the income they 
realize in foreign markets. 
</P>
<P>
Losers among the blue chips included USX, down 1 at 35 1/2; American Telephone 
&amp; Telegraph, down 1/4 at 36 1/8; Eastman Kodak, down 1/8 at 49; 
International Business Machines, down 1/2 at 113 7/8, and General Electric, 
down 3/8 at 53 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
Oil service stocks extended their recent gains on hopes for a revival of 
exploration and production demand. Halliburton rose 1 5/8 to 34, Schlumberger 
was up 1 to 40 7/8 and Baker Hughes gained 1 to 20. 
</P>
<P>
Technology issues were broadly lower, by contrast, in the over-the-counter 
market. MCI Communications lost 1 1/2 to 37 1/2; Apple Computer slipped 7/8 to 
41 3/4; Intel dropped 1 1/8 to 30 1/2, and Micron Technology fell 1 3/8 to 20. 
</P>
<P>
Large blocks of 10,000 or more shares traded on the NYSE totaled 3,582, 
compared to Tuesday's 3,722. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
The credit market's powerful rally ran out of energy as traders sold to collect 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the selling involved long-term government securities, which pushed the 
yield on the market's bellwether 30-year Treasury bond up to 8.13% from 8.07% 
late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The price of the key bond, which moves in the opposite direction to yield, 
tumbled 5/8 point, or $6.25 for every $1,000 in face value. The drop erased 
more than half of Tuesday's gain. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell Held, an economist with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., pinned 
the selloff on desires to cash in some winnings after the market's strong 
performance lately. 
</P>
<P>
The end of the second quarter on Friday provides an added incentive to take 
profits because money managers typically adjust holdings prior to preparing 
quarterly reports for clients. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Steen, a market analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said there was no 
fundamental economic reason for the retreat. The Commerce Department's report 
on the index of leading economic indicators predictably provided evidence of 
slower growth. 
</P>
<P>
Bond traders have been bidding up prices on rising optimism that weak business 
activity would induce the Federal Reserve Board to pursue a more generous 
credit policy and drive down interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Held of Smith Barney believes that the Fed might loosen its credit grip soon, 
leading to a decline in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts, however, doubt that the central bank is apt to relax its stance 
significantly because economic growth has maintained sufficient momentum to 
keep inflation rolling along at an unacceptably fast pace. 
</P>
<P>
"The market has been thinking the Fed will ease rates to stimulate the economy 
but we don't think the economy is as weak as all that," Steen said. "We think 
there's still strength out there." 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted late in the day at 9.563%, up from 9.438% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar ended higher against key foreign currencies in thin, lifeless 
trading despite reports of central bank intervention. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices fell. Republic National Bank of New York quoted an ounce of gold at 
$374.40 as of 4 p.m. EDT, down 85 cents from Tuesday's late bid. 
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said the dollar got a lift mainly at the expense of the 
Japanese yen, following increased speculation that Prime Minister Sousuke Uno 
of Japan might be forced to resign because of a sex scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Uno's predecessor, Noboru Takeshita, announced his resignation just two months 
ago in the wake of a financial scandal involving Cabinet ministers, officials 
and businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers said reports of dollar selling by the Bank of Japan and the Federal 
Reserve kept the currency in a fairly narrow trading range. 
</P>
<P>
Trading was described as very quiet prior to the Independence Day holiday; many 
dealers were also apparently reluctant to do much buying or selling at the end 
of the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
London financial markets also were quiet because of a one-day rail and subway 
strike that kept some dealers and investors away from their offices. 
</P>
<P>
One British pound cost $1.5613 in London late Wednesday, cheaper for buyers 
than late Tuesday's $1.5640. Sterling fetched $1.5580 later in New York, down 
from $1.5660 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
closed at 143.55 Japanese yen, up from 141.23 yen. It traded lower in London at 
142.65 yen, and at 143.25 yen in New York, up from 141.75 yen late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gold fell in London to $375.25 an ounce from $376.75 late Tuesday. The late 
Zurich, Switzerland, price was $373.75, down from $375.75. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $373.55, down from $373.85. 
</P>
<P>
Silver prices declined. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current 
delivery settled at $5.282 an ounce, down from $5.306. Silver closed in London 
at $5.30, down from $5.33.

'WHITE BADGE' OF COURAGE;

<P>
WRITING ABOUT COMBAT IN VIETNAM, AHN JUNGHYO FINDS INSIGHTS INTO CHANGES IN HIS 
NATIVE S. KOREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH VENANT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In another country, South Korean novelist Ahn Junghyo could have been a 
peaceful sort of couch potato, watching vintage American films on television, 
spending undisturbed days casting a fishing line into a quiet lake. 
</P>
<P>
But, as the writer laments, South Korea is small -- a fourth the size of 
California -- and is easily suffused with politics. Following a series of 
repressive regimes, President Roh Tae Woo has instituted democratic reform, but 
liberalization is precarious. Roh has ties to former strong man Chun Doo Hwan 
and obligations to military friends remain; anti-American sentiment runs high 
among dissidents, as does anti-establishmentarianism. 
</P>
<P>
And so the author of "White Badge," who intended his sixth book as a heavily 
autobiographical account of his experience as a soldier fighting in Vietnam, 
has found himself and his book drawn into the prevailing political currents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Politics for Survival 
</P>
<P>
"In Korea you've got to know about politics. Your survival depends on it," says 
Ahn, 47, here to promote his book, published last month by SoHo Press. 
</P>
<P>
A noted translator, Ahn has translated 130 books into Korean, ranging from 
Margaret Mitchell's "Gone With the Wind" to John Irving's "The World According 
to Garp," and rewrote "White Badge" in English himself. 
</P>
<P>
With it, he provides a significant contribution to a tiny pool of Korean 
literature to appear commercially in this country. 
</P>
<P>
In Korea, "White Badge," which refers both to the White Horse Division of the 
Republic of Korea in which Ahn served and to the Asian color for mourning, was 
hailed as the first major book about Korean involvement in the Vietnam War, 
and, as such, has been something of a weather vane for the changing political 
climate. 
</P>
<P>
When segments of "White Badge" appeared in 1983 in the radical Korean journal 
"Literature in Action," it was considered politically dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition to Korea's Vietnam involvement was suppressed under President Park 
Chung Hee and continued under Chun. Although about 300,000 Korean soldiers 
fought as American allies, with more than 4,000 killed and 8,000 wounded, it 
was a largely unknown war, unremembered by memorials or literature. 
</P>
<P>
"Writers weren't free to write about the Vietnam War," Ahn says. "And in my 
book, Koreans are losing battles. You couldn't imagine Koreans losing." 
</P>
<P>
When the manuscript version of "White Badge" won a literary competition 
sponsored by Hakwon, a large-circulation magazine, the publisher renounced the 
contest. "He said, 'If this is published I'll get arrested, so forget it,' " 
</P>
<P>
Ahn says. It was three more years before the story came out in book form. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, in the newly liberalized environment, reaction to the book has been 
the contrary. Dissidents and literary critics, says Ahn, feel he should have 
said more. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted me to have politically slanted views and write more about the 
mercenary issue. But I didn't have those opinions. That wasn't my idea in 
writing the book. I wanted to tell the human stories of fighting the war." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lives for Sale' 
</P>
<P>
In a single politically loaded passage, added for the American version, Ahn 
expresses a commonly held view of Korea's military participation. 
</P>
<P>
"The blood money we had to earn at the price of our lives fueled the 
modernization and development of the country. And owing to our contribution, 
the Republic of Korea, or at least a higher echelon of it, made a gigantic 
stride into the world market. Lives for sale. National mercenaries." 
</P>
<P>
"Many Koreans still feel that way," Ahn says. "We fought in Vietnam because the 
Americans asked us. So we were fighting for the Americans and against Asians 
who look like us. And we were paid by the American government." 
</P>
<P>
In Ahn's novel, the narrator, a book editor in Seoul, Han Kiju, joins the army 
full of soldierly fervor, only to return home from the killing as predictably 
disillusioned as his American counterparts. But Han's disorientation is all the 
more unsettling, for part of his own childhood has been spent as a refugee in 
the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, in Vietnam, Han is depicted not only in combat, but also befriending "the 
beautiful beggar children," a gentle widow, an elderly rural politician 
hopelessly trying to save his village from a fatal evacuation. And Han, like 
Ahn, recalls how he and his family previously survived by rummaging for scraps 
in American military garbage pails to prepare their meals of "piggie" soup. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Painful Memories 
</P>
<P>
The most poignant scene drawn from Ahn's childhood describes the family's 
mid-winter retreat south from Seoul amid the flow of refugees fleeing advancing 
Chinese troops. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to carry his 4-year-old sister, his mother was obliged to abandon her in 
a snowy field. She spread discarded layers of bedding on the snow, "set Kija 
upright on them like an image of Buddha . . . wrapped her tiny hands with 
woolen mufflers and put a rice ball on her right palm . . ." and, weeping, 
plodded on, Ahn writes. 
</P>
<P>
The story, like much of the author's life, has a happy finish; Ahn's sister was 
retrieved by her mother and now lives in Texas with her American husband and 
son. It was at her house that Ahn translated "White Badge" into English. And 
here too luck held. 
</P>
<P>
Ahn had been writing the book off and on for 13 years. He also had sent three 
other novels to American publishers and had collected a discouraging sheaf of 
rejection slips. "I realized there was no hope for me to get published and 
maybe I had no talent for writing, I thought," he says. When he packed up and 
went to Texas to translate his book he promised himself, "If I fail, I'll give 
up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sudden Change in Fortune 
</P>
<P>
This time around, Ahn recognized that obtaining a literary agent was essential 
to getting his manuscript published. Using the list of author's agents in 
"Writer's Market," he found the name of David Meth, with the mention that he 
was interested in Asian affairs. Ahn sent him two book chapters and the sort of 
lengthy life-recounting letter that agents often are wont to file in the 
wastepaper basket. But Meth responded, and from then on, says Ahn, "Everything 
worked out so easily. I couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
But long before then, Ahn's American associations had developed, and, like his 
feelings for Korea, become emotionally complex. The son of a carpenter, he grew 
up in war-scarred Seoul, his childhood imagination nourished by the symbols of 
Hollywood glamour. 
</P>
<P>
"Many Korean children lived with the inspirations that came from American 
movies," he says. "For us it was a dreamland. Cowboys were like old legendary 
generals on horseback going out to beat the bad guys. The movies were so fancy, 
and our reality in Korea was so miserable." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Ahn attended the American Sogang Jesuit University in Seoul, and after 
graduation many of his classmates, as well as much of his family, moved to the 
United States. Besides his sister in Texas, Ahn has a sister in Detroit and a 
brother who lives in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
His mental index of American cultural memorabilia, which informs "White Badge," 
has been accumulated during hours of watching American movies and news shows on 
Seoul's television station operated by the U.S. military. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand American life quite well," Ahn says proudly, though this is only 
his third visit to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
At Home in Texas 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in a coffee shop in Koreatown, he wears a white safari jacket and a 
buttoned-down striped sports shirt, and speaks a casual American English. In 
both looks and gestures he seems remarkably more Westernized than many of the 
enclave of his compatriots. 
</P>
<P>
"For them, they say, it's a town in Korea," he says of the neighborhood seen 
from the window. "I think it's the Oriental character to stay together in a 
very big family. Stay in one place and grow old. In some villages in Korea, the 
whole village is of the same family name." 
</P>
<P>
If there are frustrations with slow-moving traditions, however, the Korean view 
of Americans is also multifaceted. 
</P>
<P>
During the three years of the Korean War, says Ahn, "America was like a savior. 
We had so little at the time while America had so much. We used to say, 
'Everything American is good.' " 
</P>
<P>
But with greater affluency and growing trade rivalry, the image of the United 
States has changed. 
</P>
<P>
"When you are a young child, your big brother is everything," says Ahn. "But 
when you grow up and your big brother tries to bash you, you resist." 
</P>
<P>
The catalyst for anti-American sentiment was, Ahn believes, a media event, 
following the Kwangju massacre. Under the government of Chun Doo Hwan, hundreds 
of citizens were killed and injured during the 1980 uprising, protesting the 
institution of martial law and the arrest of the country's leading dissident 
leader, Kim Dae Jung. "For Koreans that incident was everything at the time," 
says Ahn. 
</P>
<P>
When five years later Chun visited Washington, Korean TV beamed pictures of him 
sharing cocktails with President Reagan. "I think Chun wanted to show the 
people he was approved by the American government," Ahn says. "You can imagine 
the kind of impact that had. Many Koreans began to believe Americans supported 
Chun even in the Kwangju incident." 
</P>
<P>
The presence of 43,000 American troops in South Korea perpetuates the negative 
sentiment, he adds. 
</P>
<P>
An avid fisherman, Ahn was minding his line on a lake bank one day when a 
rowboat with two U.S. soldiers and two Korean prostitutes approached. After Ahn 
waved them away from his fishing waters, the soldiers shouted profanities. "It 
was a very small thing," he says. "But for Koreans, when we hear something like 
that from a stranger it is a very, very strong insult. It really angers us. 
</P>
<P>
"Americans are carefree . . . they forget. But Koreans don't. Orientals have 
slower reactions, but our reactions are long and steady." Oddly, Ahn has never 
discussed Vietnam with American veterans, but here too there were differences 
as well as similarities in fighting the same war. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lessons From Japanese 
</P>
<P>
Responding to an American characterization of Koreans as ruthless warriors, Ahn 
explains that the kamikaze spirit was imbued in Korean military leaders during 
Japan's 35 years of occupation. Also, during the Vietnam War, Korea was poor. 
</P>
<P>
"Americans throw away helicopters and everything to save human lives. Koreans 
die for rifles," he says. "We were so short of materials. That sort of 
difference makes different soldiers." 
</P>
<P>
There also were essentially different natures at play. During a mortar shelling 
at an American military base, Ahn recalls, Americans hit the floor, while his 
first reaction was to look out the window. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to see what was going on," he says with a chuckle. "But for Americans 
safety is first. They do everything by the rules." 
</P>
<P>
Ahn stresses, however, that he is a non-political creature, so neutral that he 
refuses to join even the Korean branch of the international literary 
organization PEN. A former supporter of Kim, he now finds the dissident selfish 
and uninterested in the good of the nation. His anti-American harangues are not 
the view of the people, he says. Even the yearning for Korean reunification, 
felt by both the old, who are parted from their families, and the young, who 
have never known the Communist regime, seems to have skipped Ahn's generation, 
now comfortable with the material and political gains they have made. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Greater Freedom 
</P>
<P>
Censorship has been eased; government officials no longer visit newspapers as 
they did in Chun's years, dictating headlines and leads; even Communist books 
are now allowed publication. 
</P>
<P>
Roh is popular, and, for Ahn, the past is largely for textbooks. Although 
Koreans claim cultural, if not economic, superiority over the Japanese, with 
the cultural circuit historically running from China to Korea to Japan, Ahn 
views the powerful island nation as no more than a rival Asian neighbor. The 
Japanese and Chinese organize more easily than the warily independent Koreans, 
which partially explains their higher visibility even in foreign communities, 
he thinks, but to his generation, they are no longer enemies. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Ahn, like other Asians, has a more fatalistic attitude toward 
life's possibilities, hammered out of a long national history. In 1919, 23,000 
Koreans were killed and wounded by the Japanese in a pro-independence uprising 
that is still seen as a significant incident for Asians. 
</P>
<P>
Viewing the crushing of the Chinese student demonstrations, Ahn notes, 
"Americans say, 'It's unbelievable, how can such a thing happen!' But we know 
it can happen." 
</P>
<P>
Liberalization in Korea may continue or it may not. "I believe it's going well, 
but you can never tell the future in politics," Ahn says. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he continues to write. Another book, "Silver Stallion," written in 
college about a village's reaction following the rape of a woman by an American 
soldier, will be published in the U.S. next January. And Ahn will soon start 
work on a novel about life since the Kwangju massacre, which, he says, "even 
now may be difficult to get published in Korea." 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, he describes his life as a placid, contented routine. He lives with 
his mother in a house on the outskirts of Seoul, brags happily that his twin 
daughters have been accepted into the city's top university, and, readers of 
"White Badge" take note, is getting back together with his wife after a 14-year 
separation. 
</P>
<P>
"Orientals take everything so slowly," he says in the now-recognizable plaint, 
and laughs, "It's the Korean way."

CAN IT BE THAT IN ISRAEL A FUNNY BONE ISN'T KOSHER?

<TEXT>
<P>
Prof. Harvey Mindess of the Antioch University campus in Marina del Rey ran 
this one by his confreres here at the Third International Conference on Jewish 
Humor: 
</P>
<P>
 Adam asks God, "Why did you make Eve so sweet and soft?" 
</P>
<P>
 "So you should like her," God replies. 
</P>
<P>
 "And why so curvy?" 
</P>
<P>
 "So you should like her." 
</P>
<P>
 "But why so stupid?" 
</P>
<P>
 "So she should like you." 
</P>
<P>
 That may or may not be funny, but is it Jewish humor? And if it's funny and 
Jewish, what's the point? 
</P>
<P>
On such fine points, 16 learned men and women last week debated the state and 
the nature of humor in Israel, and among Jews elsewhere. They read papers to 
one another for three days in a stuffy classroom at Tel Aviv University. 
</P>
<P>
On the table for dissection were controversy (Jewish-American Princess jokes), 
obscurity (Judeo-Spanish banter in northern Morocco) and profundity (the 
functions of humor in Bernard Malamud's fiction). 
</P>
<P>
But no presentation drew more attention than that of the conference chairman, 
Prof. Avner Ziv, a well-known and widely published scholar. The visiting 
academicians, almost all of them Jewish, were getting an inside view of humor 
in Israel, which is remarkable mainly for its absence. 
</P>
<P>
In their four decades of independence and the preceding years of Zionist 
immigration, the Israelis have somehow lost track of that noble prince of 
Jewish humor, the schlemiel, Ziv said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
And it worries him. 
</P>
<P>
"A schlemiel is someone who behaves in a different way from those of us who are 
well-adjusted, who follow the rules, who see reality as it is and try to deal 
with it in an efficient way," Ziv explained. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Lost Hero 
</P>
<P>
"The schlemiel is a naive person who believes that reality is less important 
than ideals. He lives in a world where good conquers evil, where people don't 
hate each other. And therefore he won't achieve success. This world is not for 
naive people." 
</P>
<P>
But in the days when the schlemiel was a folkloric hero in the shtetls, or 
villages, of Poland and Russia, late in the last century, he was a man of 
unreasoning hope against all odds. Ziv offered this one: 
</P>
<P>
An officer of the czarist Russian army calls his troops together and says: 
"Men, the moment has come. We're going into battle. It's going to be fierce, 
hand to hand, man to man." And a little Jew speaks up: "Excuse me, sir. Could 
you show me my man? Maybe I'll talk to him, maybe we can find some 
arrangement." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a schlemiel," the humorous creation of a life so full of poverty and 
oppression that a Jew in the shtetls could only cope by laughing at both his 
oppressors and himself, Ziv said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Migration a Factor 
</P>
<P>
In Ziv's view, when the emigration of Jews from Eastern Europe began, the 
schlemiels went to America, where again the Jews were a minority and shtetl 
humor still served as a mechanism for coping. The character has never lost his 
popularity. 
</P>
<P>
"Woody Allen -- pure schlemiel," Ziv said. 
</P>
<P>
The emigration to Palestine was another matter. The men and women who built 
Israel were realists, tough chutzpaniks. 
</P>
<P>
"Israel wanted to create not only a homeland," Ziv said, "but we wanted to 
create a new Jew, not the Jews from the Diaspora, who were always victims, but 
strong, resourceful. 
</P>
<P>
"And within Israel this is the case. Tough, arrogant, always sure that we're 
right. We don't have any modesty at all." 
</P>
<P>
Also, he said, with their own country the Jews of Israel were no longer a 
minority, with all that means for a society's humor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Room for Victims 
</P>
<P>
There was no room for a schlemiel, a victim, in Israel. Jokes revolved around 
politics, as life did, and contradictions of personal relationships were put on 
the back burner. The diversity of Jewish humor in the Jewish state withered. 
</P>
<P>
But Ziv sees signs of change. 
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon started it," he said, "and now the intifada" -- referring to the 
unpopular 1982 invasion and the current Palestinian uprising in the occupied 
territories. Now the Israeli is less certain that "might makes right," Ziv 
suggested, and is reaching back for the coping mechanisms developed in the 
humor of the shtetl to deal with new conditions. Some Jews here are making fun 
of themselves again. 
</P>
<P>
Ziv was obviously pleased that his daughter had recently come home with this 
one, which takes a stab at machismo in Israel: 
</P>
<P>
Three couples sit down for dinner. The American turns to his wife and says, 
"Pass me the honey, Honey." The Briton asks his wife, "May I have the sugar, 
Sugar?" The Israeli commands his spouse, "Give me the steak, you cow!" 
</P>
<P>
Not subtle, but a beginning, Ziv suggests. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, abroad, particularly in the United States, Jewish humor continues to 
revolve around traditional characters and themes, according to the participants 
at the Tel Aviv conference. Jewish-American Princess jokes, which in the 
America of the 1980s are what Polish jokes were in the 1960s, have been a 
source of some concern to students of humor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Old Jokes 
</P>
<P>
Most see them as an extension of the old jokes about Jewish mothers, at least 
in terms of negative attitudes toward women. But among the humor researchers 
who attended the conference they were considered relatively benign, except for 
some obviously cruel examples. The so-called JAP joke has been attacked by many 
Jewish groups in the United States as both anti-Semitic and anti-feminist. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard Saper, a psychologist at Florida International University in Miami, 
sketched the well-known line of the JAP joke, the depiction of young Jewish 
women as "pushy, spoiled, shallow, self-indulgent and sexually exploitative." 
</P>
<P>
A tame example: The dream house of the Jewish American Princess has 7,000 
square feet of space with no kitchen or bedroom. Another -- and this one drew a 
laugh from the scholars here: Three words that a JAP will never hear, 
"Attention, K mart shoppers." 
</P>
<P>
The jokes have been popular with Jewish and Gentile audiences alike in the 
United States, Saper pointed out, citing Joan Rivers as a comic who has built a 
career out of princess humor. 
</P>
<P>
The question the scholars at Tel Aviv kept probing was the nature of Jewish 
humor. Why did the JAP jokes catch on, beyond, in some cases, being clever? 
</P>
<P>
Saper and Mindess, along with others here, supported what some ethnic 
communities like least to hear, that there is a grain of truth in stereotype 
jokes. 
</P>
<P>
Mindess recalled a young Jewish woman who took the floor after a speech he had 
made on humor and declared: "Some of my best friends are JAPs, and so am I. I 
only wish my father had more money to give me."

HEARING VOICES: A CALL MORE COMMON THAN BELIEVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH ANN KRIER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the critical and popular hit "Field of Dreams," a baseball fan played by 
Kevin Costner repeatedly hears a voice talking to him in his cornfield at 
night. It's loud. It's direct. And very spooky. 
</P>
<P>
Costner is a little freaked out, but he's intrigued -- enough to test the 
voice's advice. It leads him on a grand adventure that culminates in his 
finally forgiving his deceased father for a long-held grudge, and saving the 
family farm from foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
"Field of Dreams" has been hailed by critics as a glorious fantasy, a momentary 
escape into make-believe that proved to be just the box-office ticket this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Admit to Privately 
</P>
<P>
It's also kindled interest in the ages-old phenomenon of "hearing voices" -- an 
experience therapists say more people will admit to privately than in public. 
</P>
<P>
Even W. P. Kinsella, author of the novel "Shoeless Joe" on which "Field of 
Dreams" is based, thinks his story is an utter fabrication. He's especially 
irritated that some of his fans think he must hear voices himself to have 
produced such a moving depiction of the way the experience reportedly occurs. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had some annoying calls from people who confuse me with the person in the 
story," Kinsella said by phone from his home in White Rock, British Columbia. 
"I don't believe in the supernatural in any form at all. I'm strictly a 
storyteller. I know how to manipulate people's emotions. I certainly don't 
believe in the things I write about. . . . There are no gods. There is no 
magic. I may be a wizard only because it takes a wizard to know there are 
none." 
</P>
<P>
Though they debate about wizards and magic, psychologists and psychiatrists 
typically acknowledge that significant numbers of people do have what they call 
auditory hallucinations, or "outer" voices. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, inner voices are most frequently reported -- and may be called by 
other names: conscience, intuition, hunches or gut feelings. Outer voices are 
heard as if coming from outside the person, just as if somebody else were 
standing nearby and talking. Only when the hearer turns around to look for the 
speaker, nobody's there. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Rosenberg, 29, a court reporter who lives in Anaheim Hills, has heard an 
outer voice call her name. "I'll say, 'What? What?' and turn around and 
nobody's there," Rosenberg said. "The outer voice is very scary to me. But the 
inner voice . . . any time I've ever listened to it, it's never done me wrong. 
It's strange. When I was really young, a little girl, this voice -- I thought 
it was myself talking to myself. It doesn't sound like another person. . . . 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Voice's Opinion 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be looking for something and it will tell me where to find it. Any time I 
need it, it's there. I don't always want it though. I'm now dating a guy who's 
getting serious and wants to get married. This voice is telling me, 'Don't do 
it.' It's been telling me that since I met the guy. I'm going, 'Nah,' like I'm 
not listening. If I'd just listen and pay attention, I'd be better off." 
</P>
<P>
Psychologist Julian Jaynes, a visiting fellow at Princeton University, suspects 
that as many as one-third of the U.S. population may have heard an outer voice 
during childhood or at another time in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Jaynes, the author of the popular and controversial "The Origin of 
Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind," has written on the outer 
voice phenomenon, noting that it exists in varying percentages in every 
population in the world where it's been studied. 
</P>
<P>
Hearing outer voices is reported most widely by schizophrenics, he observed. 
But his research shows that the experience also occurs in significant numbers 
of "normal" individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Jaynes admits that he has heard a distinct outer voice on a couple of 
occasions. One time, "I was trying to puzzle out the mind-body problem (the 
influence of the mind on the body and vice versa) and it really was 
frustrating," he recalled. "I heard a voice say, very distinctly, 'Include the 
knower in the known.' It was so clear, I had to go outside the apartment to see 
if somebody was there." 
</P>
<P>
Only trouble was, he didn't find the voice's tip particularly useful: "It's not 
something I agree with, though I thought about it a great deal." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Controlled Study 
</P>
<P>
When Jaynes and his assistants conducted a "carefully controlled" study of 
Princeton students about a year and a half ago, they found that "fully one 
third of the students have heard (outer) voices at some time during their 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
As for why the phenomenon occurs, Jaynes doesn't claim to have the definitive 
answer to what he considers a profoundly important and mysterious phenomenon. 
He speculates that auditory hallucinations were once "the basis of a mentality 
different than the one we have now. There is evidence suggesting that this 
ability to hallucinate evolved along with the evolution of language" -- 
sometime between 50,000 and 10,000 BC. 
</P>
<P>
Non-academics also report that the phenomenon may be more popular than is 
recognized. 
</P>
<P>
"I do have people in my church who say they have heard (outer, external) voices 
and who give high importance to it," said George Regas, rector of All Saints 
Episcopal Church in Pasadena. "You do not quickly discount it. I think the 
world of the spirit is a world of mystery. I think we are more and more 
accepting the fact that the spiritual world is a world where miraculous things 
do happen." 
</P>
<P>
Regas does not hear an outer voice. But he tries "to be still for long periods 
of time and let that (inner voice) speak to me. That kind of inner voice is a 
very important part of my own journey." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heart of Experience 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi/psychotherapist Ted Falcon also listens to an inner voice and does not 
discount reports of healthy people claiming to hear outer ones. 
</P>
<P>
"At the heart of all religious tradition is the experience of revelation that 
comes through an individual. It's experienced as an inner voice, outer voice, 
an image, symbol, some kind of a call," said Tarzana-based Falcon, founder of 
Makom Ohr Shalom, a synagogue for Jewish meditation that regularly draws about 
300 participants to Friday evening services. 
</P>
<P>
A prominent Jewish businessman recalled hearing a voice and receiving what he 
terms a "revelation" during a trip to Israel in which he visited what are 
assumed to be the tombs of several Old Testament figures. 
</P>
<P>
"The question I had . . . was . . . did these people really live, were these 
real stories or not," said the man, who was willing to be interviewed on the 
condition that his name be withheld. "At the tomb of Rachel, I put my forehead 
to the tomb and received what you would call revelation. There was an 
understanding, directly to me that 'these people did live in these valleys. The 
stories you heard about them are more or less true.' A higher voice was 
speaking to me, saying, 'They are your ancestors.' I absolutely knew this was 
truth. My whole body understood it. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
But another time, the man said, he was at a retreat in the desert, in a deep 
meditation, when he heard two distinct voices -- sounds that appeared to be 
coming from outside himself: "I picked up a conversation between two men. It 
was like picking up someone else's conversation on a car phone and listening. 
It was mundane, hearing these two, normal voices talking. I decided I really 
didn't want to hear it. It was too weird for me. I shut it off." 
</P>
<P>
According to brain-mind researcher Willis Harmon, many people hear voices of 
both the inner and outer persuasion but few are willing to admit it to anyone 
but their closest friends. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just one of the things we don't talk about," said the president of the 
Institute of Noetic Sciences in Sausalito. But Harmon, who is professor 
emeritus of electrical engineering at Stanford University, doesn't mind 
revealing that he has heard both an inner voice and an outer voice on occasion 
and that he knows many others who hear voices as well. 
</P>
<P>
"I've talked to businessmen, scientists, educators, well-educated professional 
people and not only is it reasonably common, it's cherished. It's invited," 
said the author of the book "Global Mind Change." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strong Awareness 
</P>
<P>
Call it an outer voice, an auditory hallucination, or an awareness so strong 
you're certain you heard it speak to you. How do you tell if it's the benign, 
perhaps beneficial variety, or a symptom of mental illness? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think (people hearing outer voices) are always psychotic," offered 
Encino-based psychiatrist Dr. Hyla Cass, an assistant clinical professor of 
psychiatry at the UCLA School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
"I would look at what their lives look like, their social relationships, their 
family backgrounds and their belief systems. 
</P>
<P>
"Did God speak to the prophets? We don't know. The fact is that we do have 
sub-personalities, or different states of mind that can be heard as voices." 
</P>
<P>
Psychiatrist/attorney Dr. Ronald Markman, who occasionally testifies on the 
sanity of voice-hearing individuals in criminal cases, cautions that the 
hearing of outer voices is "something to be concerned about, something to be 
taken seriously." Markman subscribes to the theory that outer voices are part 
of an individual's psyche from which he or she has dissociated. 
</P>
<P>
"(Certain information) may be unacceptable for the body to deal with internally 
and so the psyche throws it out that way," explained Markman. 
</P>
<P>
Criminals sometimes claim a voice they heard instructed them to commit a crime, 
and it's Markman's job to determine if they're telling the truth and if they 
were sane at the time they committed the crimes. His experience has been that 
some criminals readily lie about hearing voices in hopes of improving their 
defenses. 
</P>
<P>
"I meticulously have to ask them where the voices are coming from," to which 
"the best answer is 'I don't know,' " said the author of the recently published 
"Alone with the Devil, Famous Cases of a Courtroom Psychiatrist." 
</P>
<P>
"Criminals often trip themselves up by making the messages too specific. The 
real messages are usually global and not very specific." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Marvin Gillick, a specialist in child psychiatry and forensic psychiatry 
and associate clinical professor of psychiatry at UCLA School of Medicine, 
observes that hallucinations and imaginary companions are often reported by 
non-criminal types, particularly children. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a way of protecting against feelings of abandonment and rejection. It's 
them hearing their own consciences, but the children externalize it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet another theory on outer and inner voices comes from former Portland 
advertising agency owner Lee Coit, author of the self-published book, 
"Listening: How to Increase Awareness of Your Inner Guide." 
</P>
<P>
Coit thinks that voices offering beneficial guidance are a part of the person, 
but come from a part that is not contained in the body. 
</P>
<P>
"My basic core belief is that we all have a connection to 'eternal knowing' and 
'universal mind' and that we can access it individually and it's well worth 
doing," he said, adding that though his book espouses no particular religious 
faith, he has received letters from Catholic priests, Buddhist monks and others 
commenting on the effectiveness of his listening techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Coit says he hears a wise inner voice guiding him "almost continually" and that 
it directed him to sell his mid-sized ad agency in the late '70s and later to 
open Las Brisas, a retreat in Wildomar, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
On a few occasions, however, he has heard an outer voice as well: "It's a 
startling experience, really. . . . It's not threatening . . . but it's not the 
way I think we get most of our guidance. Most of our guidance comes internally. 
(Continually hearing an outer voice) would be like using exclamation points all 
the time." 
</P>
<P>
Coit sometimes tells lecture audiences how, after his divorce, he set out for 
Europe. He had hoped to make the acquaintance, along the way, of someone with 
whom he could travel. But his daughter, attending college in Paris, asked him 
if she could come along instead. 
</P>
<P>
Coit says that he really didn't want to take her, figuring she would "cramp my 
style." But an inner voice advised him, clearly, that his daughter was supposed 
to accompany him. 
</P>
<P>
"After I'd been with my daughter a while, she told me she'd been very depressed 
and considered suicide," he remembered. "(At the end of the trip) I put her on 
the train and she said she felt better. When I walked out of the depot, I heard 
my inner voice saying, 'Now which (travel partner) would you choose?' " 
</P>
<P>
Coit, who has discussed the ways in which voices are heard with hundreds of his 
readers, said he enjoyed "Field of Dreams" and found it to be such an accurate 
portrayal of the voices phenomenon that he presumed the story's creator was 
intimately familiar with the experience. 
</P>
<P>
And though "Shoeless Joe" author Kinsella claims to be a complete non-believer, 
his wife suggests he is hardly unknowing. 
</P>
<P>
'His views are that it's all pretty silly," Ann Knight said, cheerfully. 
</P>
<P>
"But he lives with me and I hear (inner) voices. He has said he based Annie 
(the Costner character's wife) on me."

AN EMPHASIS ON CHILDREN'S DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the early 1960s, civil rights leader Robert Moses survived beatings and 
rifle assaults while teaching backwoods Mississippi sharecroppers how to read 
and write. But by 1965, he felt a different pressure -- a growing bitterness 
over America. 
</P>
<P>
In 1964, his efforts to help seat the black Mississippi Freedom Democratic 
Party at the Democratic Convention in Atlantic City had failed. Soon, Moses 
became convinced that Martin Luther King's advisers, particularly Bayard 
Rustin, had persuaded Dr. King that morality and politics could no longer mix. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when King, who had dominated with the tactic of moral force, lost the 
issue; derailed it," Moses says. 
</P>
<P>
"Stokely Carmichael (a prominent member of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating 
Committee) learned the lesson well, and the first chance he got, he yelled 
'black power,' and that was it. We lost the ability to speak to the inner 
city." 
</P>
<P>
The helter-skelter politics of Vietnam completed the job on Moses, and he left 
the United States to live in Tanzania with other expatriate blacks. 
</P>
<P>
The experiment didn't work. The politically sophisticated American blacks were 
a threat to the tribal culture and hierarchy of Tanzania. The Americans were 
denied citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Moses returned home and continued the doctoral studies in 
philosophy at Harvard that he had left in the late '50s. He feels today that 
civil rights is moving toward the need for greater help with "children's 
development." 
</P>
<P>
"What you are faced with," he says, "is a lack of a concept within our 
community of the need to invest in personal development. . . . We've lost the 
idea of one generation investing in the next." 
</P>
<P>
The idea of the Algebra Project and math literacy is just the entering wedge to 
the question of "the economic and political arrangements being made as we shift 
from an industrial base to a high-tech base." Blacks have to pay attention to 
this shift, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"In the '60s, things began to center around the question of the right to vote. 
It built over a number of years, and then finally mobilized enough of the 
society to make a dent, do something. People began to see voting as a 
fundamental issue, and that released a lot of energy. We may see a similar 
thing soon with children, inner-city children, and their development." ROBERT

Time to catch up on major and minor happenings around the Orange County music 
scene: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dr. Dream Records, the Orange County-based alternative rock label, 
continues to carve a niche for itself as a home for interesting local bands. 
The label's latest signing is Eggplant, a Huntington Beach band whose varied, 
witty approach to rock makes it a good candidate for acceptance on the college 
radio scene. Comparisons to Camper Van Beethoven are likely. Eggplant headlines 
July 7 at Night Moves, 5902 Warner Ave., in Huntington Beach, along with two 
other worthy local rock contenders, Lost Dog and Don't Mean Maybe. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Swamp Zombies, who last year became the first Dr. Dream band to sally 
forth with national touring, haven't forgotten their roots. The Irvine-based 
acoustic-rock quartet, with its play-on-a-street-corner folk-busker's ethic, 
has always regarded the annual Sawdust Festival in Laguna Beach as a favorite 
gig. The Swamp Zombies will be back at the festival on Laguna Canyon Road this 
year, playing on eight separate evenings, with five half-hour sets each night 
between 5:30 and 9:30. The Zombie dates are July 9, 21 and 26; and Aug. 1, 8, 
12, 15 and 20. The band's humor-filled repertoire ranges from Jimi Hendrix and 
the Sex Pistols to the "Green Acres" theme. 
</P>
<P>
 -- National People's Gang, another local band which records for Dr. Dream, 
evidently has something to say about its roots on its next album, which is 
tentatively titled "Orange." The record is expected to be out this fall. NPG 
plays July 7 at Bogart's in Long Beach. Also appearing on that bill is 
Redhouse, which includes three former members of the defunct Orange County band 
the Bell Jar. The band is promising "an entirely new color" from its Bell Jar 
days, when the murky, gloomy sonics came painted in basic black. Along with NPG 
and Redhouse will be Gypsy Trash, whose winsome singer, Dee Dee Grisham, 
recently became the bride of T.S.O.L.'s singer, Joe Wood. Gypsy Trash also 
plays July 13 at Night Moves. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Night Moves has started a Monday night jam session featuring mix-and-match 
combinations of Orange County rock band members. The soirees are being billed 
as "Roche Motel," in honor of T.S.O.L.'s bassist, Mike Roche, who serves as 
host for the jams. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The T.S.O.L. alumni association is also staying busy: Lunch Box, which 
includes T.S.O.L.'s original lead guitarist, Ron Emory, has signed to record 
for Bug Records, a new subsidiary of Capitol. Lunch Box is celebrating its 
signing tonight with a show at Club Lingerie in Hollywood. Also on the bill are 
other bands with Orange County roots: Burning Tree, the Scarecrows and One Day. 
</P>
<P>
Tender Fury, fronted by former T.S.O.L. singer Jack Grisham, has switched from 
the Chameleon/Posh Boy label to Triple X records, and is scheduled to begin 
recording its second album this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Releases also are expected from two other bands with roots in Orange County's 
early-'80s punk rock explosion: D.I. is working on its latest album for Triple 
X, and Agent Orange is starting work on another album for Enigma Records. Brent 
Liles, former bassist for Social Distortion, has joined Agent Orange, which 
continues to be led by founding guitarist Mike Palm. 
</P>
<P>
As for the current lineup of Social Distortion, it's doing just fine, having 
recently signed with Epic Records. Singer Mike Ness says the new songs for 
S.D.'s first major label album are already written -- including "Ball and 
Chain," a terrific country-rocker which the band has been playing live. Social 
Distortion will get down to recording after an extensive national summer tour. 
Ness, by the way, is described in "The New Trouser Press Record Guide" (a thick 
book that reviews thousands of alternative rock records from the punk era and 
beyond) as "more a punk pinup than Billy Idol ever was." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Shade Tree stringed instrument shop in Laguna Niguel is putting on a 
series of three acoustic folk shows this summer. The Vermont-based duo of Cathy 
Fink and Marcy Marxer will play July 17, offering banjo, guitar and mandolin 
picking and country yodeling. Singer-songwriter Steve Gillette and his wife, 
Cindy Mangsen appear July 21, and Bob Franke, a Massachusetts folkie, will play 
on Aug. 7. Information: (714) 364-5270. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Speaking of folkies, after dabbling in big-band blues the last time around, 
the unpredictable Neil Young is going back to his roots with a solo acoustic 
show Aug. 18 at the Pacific Amphitheatre. Tickets go on sale Sunday at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Local reggae and rock acts will pitch in to support what has become rock's 
latest high-profile cause: preservation of tropical rain forests. The benefit 
takes place July 8 from 5 p.m. to midnight, at Willowbrook-Anneliese's School, 
20062 Laguna Canyon Road, Laguna Beach. Appearing are Barbara Paige and 
Identity, Bill Laster and Shades of Jade, Eyes of the World, Electraflo, The 
Voice of the Forest and Jumbalaya. Information: (714) 647-5522.

A HIGHER CALLING;

<P>
DIOCESE OF ORANGE LOOKING FOR A FEW GOOD MEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT, Patrick Mott is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WANTED: Single men, any age, for entry-level position with longstanding 
international concern. Low pay, long hours, limited wardrobe. Requires five, 
possibly eight years training. Must be fluent in Spanish. Obedience to 
superiors, celibacy a must. Rewards, incentives almost entirely intangible. 
Promotion slow or nonexistent. Preferred jobs not guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not the sort of ad that would make you want to chuck that Beverly Hills 
corporate law practice and dive right in, is it? Or put that career as a pro 
shortstop on permanent hold? Or say "thanks but no thanks" to medical school? 
</P>
<P>
But that's precisely what three Orange County men did. And right now, there are 
92 others from the county like them working hard, and praying harder, hoping to 
fill that job. They look forward to it, they say, with greater fervor and 
anticipation than they have for any other event in their lives. For them, 
landing that job will be the realization of a dream, the beginning of what they 
see as an exalted future. 
</P>
<P>
Sure it's tough, they say. But they can't see themselves being truly happy with 
anything other than ordination to the Roman Catholic priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up planning to be a doctor and to go to UCI for premed," said Tim 
Freyer, 25, of Huntington Beach, who is now Father Tim Freyer, the result of 
his ordination early this month. "I wanted the nice house and the family and 
the luxuries. But at the end of my junior year at Huntington Beach High School, 
I decided I'd be much happier (being a priest). I'd thought that medicine was 
important in helping people, but I wanted to help the whole person, in this 
life and in the next. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing for me is that I've been able to follow the call of the Lord, 
and because of that, I've been able to experience a lot of love and friendship 
with the people I've worked and studied with. I could never be as happy doing 
anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Neither could Cirilo Flores, 40, of Costa Mesa, who gave up a Beverly Hills 
corporate law practice to study for the priesthood. Or Juan Hernandez, 28, of 
Santa Ana, a former semi-pro shortstop who hung up the spikes and glove in 
favor of a Roman collar and a breviary. 
</P>
<P>
All three men are products of St. John's Seminary in Camarillo, the only 
Catholic seminary in Southern California. It is a school for diocesan, or 
parish, priests, who are, said Father Daniel Murray, the director of vocations 
for the Diocese of Orange, "the general practitioners of the church." Upon 
their ordinations, the new home-grown Orange County priests return to the 
county and are assigned to a parish here. 
</P>
<P>
They are perhaps the most visible of the county's priests, differing in their 
influence and duties from priests in specific religious orders who study at 
seminaries outside California, such as the Norbertines (who teach at Mater Dei 
and Santa Margarita high schools, maintain an abbey in El Toro and study 
theology in Rome), the Servites (who teach at Servite High School, do hospital 
chaplaincy work and have their seminary in St. Louis) or the various Trinity 
Missionaries, Jesuits, Dominicans, Franciscans and others. 
</P>
<P>
The diocesan priest is the church's Jack-of-all-trades. He celebrates daily 
Mass, hears confessions, performs baptisms, visits sick parishioners, helps 
organize bingo, trains altar boys, preaches sermons, conducts funerals and in 
general ministers to a specific flock. 
</P>
<P>
In many locations throughout the country, the ranks of diocesan priests are 
thinning, and few young men are coming up to fill the jobs. However, Freyer and 
four other Orange County diocesan candidates were ordained June 10. That's one 
more than the number of priests who were ordained on the same day in the 
Archdiocese of Los Angeles, the largest Catholic diocese in the nation. The 
Archdiocese of Boston, another large and traditional Catholic enclave, ordained 
only five this year. 
</P>
<P>
But in Orange County, gains in religious vocations of all kinds are expected in 
the next few years, said Murray. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to think that we have a lot of good priests who have provided good role 
models for the young people coming up to admire," said Murray. "It also, I 
think, reflects the enthusiasm of Bishop Norman McFarland (bishop of the 
Diocese of Orange) for religious vocations. He's been very outspoken about it." 
</P>
<P>
Seminarians also say they feel that the relative youth of the Diocese of Orange 
-- it was formed in 1976 -- lends a kind of pioneering enthusiasm to the 
prospect of becoming a priest. 
</P>
<P>
And in central Orange County in particular, priests are beginning to emerge 
from traditionally devout Vietnamese Catholic families. One of the five priests 
ordained this month was Joseph Nguyen, 25, a Vietnamese refugee who had early 
seminary training in Vietnam and who was graduated from St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever their motivation, however, the candidates for the diocesan priesthood 
in Orange County are faced with a long road. They cannot simply announce their 
desire for ordination and snap on the collar. 
</P>
<P>
That's where St. John's comes in. The seminary, on a quiet hillside in 
Camarillo surrounded by citrus groves, has been turning out graduating classes 
of new diocesan priests for the southwestern United States for 50 years. On the 
wall of one of the dormitories are hung portraits of each class, and it is a 
fair bet that most current parish priests in Southern California can be found 
there. For example, the first bishop of the Diocese of Orange, William Johnson, 
appears in the class of 1944, and the current archbishop of Los Angeles, Roger 
M. Mahony, comes from the class of '62. 
</P>
<P>
There are actually two distinct parts of the seminary: the seminary college, 
which offers a four-year degree in philosophy to prospective priests who decide 
to pursue studies for the priesthood directly out of high school, and the 
theological seminary, a short walk down a hill from the college. The 
theological seminary requires another four years of study in such subjects as 
canon law, church history, homiletics (preaching), pastoral theology, Spanish 
and psychology. 
</P>
<P>
(Candidates who have earned a college degree elsewhere must attend the college 
for one year of "pre-candidacy" studies in philosophy before being admitted to 
the seminary.) 
</P>
<P>
During their time in the seminary, the candidates are elevated, successively, 
to the pre-ordination ranks of "reader" and "deacon," and by the time they are 
ordained they will have earned either a master's or a doctoral degree in 
divinity. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates in Orange County must be recommended for seminary training by Father 
Murray, who has several meetings with each man. Most of the men who come to him 
to discuss a religious vocation will never enter seminary training, he said. 
Some students in the seminary college will drop out before going on to the 
theological seminary, but once the candidates enter their final four years at 
St. John's the attrition rate is low, said Murray. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the students live at the seminary during the school year, and 
participate in a daily routine that would be considered highly regimented at a 
secular college. A typical day begins with morning prayers at 7 a.m., classes 
until Mass at 12:10, followed by lunch and quiet time for afternoon prayer. 
Some afternoons and evenings are taken up with community service work, and most 
days will involve studying after dinner. It can be a demanding and sometimes 
difficult life, say the seminarians. But most of them, like Cirilo Flores, the 
former Beverly Hills lawyer, are exactly where they want to be. 
</P>
<P>
"It came down to the bottom line that there had to be something more," he said. 
"When I told people I knew that I wanted to be a priest, they wanted to know 
how much I'd be paid. And it was rather difficult, giving up the car and the 
condo, things like that. But I find that it's very freeing not to be tied down 
to those things." 
</P>
<P>
So does Juan Hernandez, the former semi-pro shortstop who just completed his 
first year of theology at St. John's after leaving his seminary studies for 
three years to pursue, among other things, his baseball career. 
</P>
<P>
"I was quite comfortable," he said, "making good money, living in my own place. 
But I found that I was missing something. I'm very glad I came back. This year 
is the best I've ever had in any school, all around. I feel that it has been 
very right for me to be here." 
</P>
<P>
How is the decision made? When does the realization come that nothing else will 
do? Does it arrive with a blinding flash? 
</P>
<P>
Just the opposite, say the seminarians. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to be kind of a goof-off, arrogant and self-centered" said Stephen 
Duffin, 26, a Fullerton resident who recently completed his second year of 
theology at St. John's. "But that leaves you isolated and alone. For me, it was 
a gradual process of breaking down negative barriers. After the heady days of 
high school and the first couple of years of college, I still went to church, 
but it didn't take top billing in my life. There was a big emptiness there. I 
got a bachelor's degree in journalism from Cal State Fullerton, but I also took 
classes in philosophy and felt called to the priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like I woke up one day and said, 'Hey! I'll be a priest.' It's more 
like one day you finally just say, 'I have to address this.' " 
</P>
<P>
Some, like Hernandez, take an initial run at it but find they have left 
something undone in the secular world. 
</P>
<P>
"I found I loved baseball very, very much," he said, "and I wanted to give it 
one last shot. I thought that time was a factor. I couldn't always play 
baseball, but I could always be a priest." 
</P>
<P>
After graduating from St. John's college, Hernandez returned to Orange County 
and joined a semi-pro team. He played for a year and a half, then worked at a 
succession of jobs, "looking for something that would really capture my 
interest." 
</P>
<P>
He decided to obtain a teaching credential. But while he was driving with a 
friend to UC Irvine to enroll in classes, he said, "all the time I was thinking 
about the priesthood again, and it seemed to be knocking on my door again. I 
wanted to get into the spiritual realm of people's lives and in teaching I 
wouldn't have been able to do that. I knew I had to reconsider my vocation." 
</P>
<P>
Steven Holtkamp, 24, a second-year seminarian from Santa Ana, grew up, in a 
sense, with the priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
"My family was always very, very involved with the church," he said, "and I 
worked in the rectory after hours during high school. There, you get to see the 
full range of what it means to be human. It really made me stop and think that 
priests were dealing with people at the base level -- the most happy and tragic 
times in their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Like Holtkamp, who went to Mater Dei High School, many seminarians attended 
Catholic schools at one time in their lives and, said Father Murray, almost all 
were once altar boys. Freyer, however, attended public schools exclusively. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad was a Lutheran who became a convert when I was in about the fifth or 
sixth grade," said Freyer. "He got cancer when I was in the eighth grade, and I 
saw how much good the priests did for him and my family. They would come over 
for a home Mass, and that day was a big high for him. His whole disposition 
would change." 
</P>
<P>
However, said Freyer, such satisfying moments are not always part of the daily 
reality of either the priesthood or the seminary. And that realization, he 
said, sometimes comes hard. 
</P>
<P>
"My vocation became stronger with time," he said. "But there were times that I 
wondered if I could make it through the years. I didn't doubt my vocation too 
much, although now and then I thought about what I could do if I left. Also, 
I'd see that the priests had shortcomings and that the (seminary) system wasn't 
perfect, and that would get me discouraged sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
For Nguyen, the seminary could be difficult "because of the long training and 
the sometimes monotonous atmosphere. You're always longing for something that's 
ahead of you. You're anxious to be a priest. You can get tired of school." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, a first-year theology student, said, "I have to say there are times 
when I still question (my vocation). It's not something that one never asks 
again. It's like marriage in that even when some people are married they may 
not be sure it's right." 
</P>
<P>
But, said Duffin, reality can be a pleasant surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a naive picture of the seminary," he said. "I thought I'd see guys with 
their heads in the clouds, floating around, all pious. But when I first came 
here I saw guys with Walkmans bopping around, and I said, 'I can do that.' It's 
just normal guys doing normal things." 
</P>
<P>
Almost. The priestly promise of celibacy and their commitment to a life of 
relative poverty, say the seminarians, can weigh on them to differing degrees. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the rewards of the friendship and the openness people have shown me 
means more to me now than money or a family," said Freyer. "There's a freedom 
in not having a wife or family that allows you to become part of others' 
families." 
</P>
<P>
Duffin said celibacy "probably is easier for some guys than others. But what 
human beings need is intimacy, and you don't give that up when you're celibate. 
You channel all the passions and desires you have into all the good things they 
can bring." 
</P>
<P>
Flores said priests "are committing their lives for others. That's a real basic 
understanding. People are going to be coming to you at all hours, all days. 
It's a basic human fact, sexuality. But it can also be viewed as an adventure 
to be involved with people at so many intimate moments in their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Keeping the commitments, said Holtkamp, involves "remembering who's in charge 
here. If your heart's in it, it really isn't a sacrifice." 
</P>
<P>
But, said Duffin, the priest-to-be must remember that he is, in effect, 
studying not to occupy a higher position, but to be demoted. 
</P>
<P>
"With a lot of the attention that people give you, you can get swell-headed," 
he said. "But you have to remember that when you're ordained, you're stepping 
down to be a servant of the people." 
</P>
<P>
The ordination is the payoff. And because it is a joyful and relatively rare 
ceremony, the church trots out the big cast, the bright vestments and puts on 
the big show that manages at the same time to be highly personal and intimate. 
</P>
<P>
At this month's ceremony at Holy Family Cathedral in Orange, the five new 
priests' hands were anointed by Bishop McFarland, an estimated 150 priests from 
throughout the diocese laid hands on the young men's heads and embraced them 
one by one, and several hundred of their family members and friends in the 
packed church finally applauded them enthusiastically. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the parish hall, reception lines formed before each new priest, with 
family and friends offering congratulations and receiving the first blessings 
of each man's new career. 
</P>
<P>
"It's living it up in the real sense," said Nguyen. "Knowing you will be 
working with people and fulfilling a call that grows deeper within you." 
</P>
<P>
Freyer, who celebrated his first Mass at his home parish of SS. Simon and Jude 
Church in Huntington Beach the next day, said "the whole weekend (of the 
ordination) for me was beyond my wildest dreams. It was so great. It was a very 
spiritual time, a very humbling time, seeing so many people I'd met or worked 
with, and all this love just poured out on me. 
</P>
<P>

FRUSTRATED BELCHER ENGAGES IN SHOUTING MATCH WITH UMPIRE AFTER 17-INNING LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's one thing to be the losing pitcher. It's another thing to be the losing 
pitcher in relief for a second consecutive game when you feel you're really a 
starter. 
</P>
<P>
And it's yet another thing to have all of this happen at 1 a.m., Which is about 
when Dodger pitcher Tim Belcher engaged in a shouting match, and nearly a 
boxing match, with umpire Ed Montague Wednesday morning after a 17-inning, 5-3 
loss to the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
In a game that finally ended after the Padres took advantage of a crazy-hop 
single by Tony Gwynn to start their two-run rally in the 17th, the strangest 
play of the night happened 20 minutes later, after the Dodger offense had 
failed to score and saddled Belcher with another loss. 
</P>
<P>
According to witnesses, after the game, home plate umpire Montague was escorted 
by sportscaster Ross Porter toward the Dodger dugout to appear on the postgame 
radio show. As Montague neared the dugout, Belcher spotted him and began 
screaming for Montague to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Montague began screaming back, and the men approached each other. According to 
Montague, Dodger coach Joe Ferguson finally grabbed Belcher and pulled him away 
while Dodger coach Bill Russell also intervened. No contact was made. 
</P>
<P>
Montague said he would do nothing more than inform National League President 
Bill White of the incident, and indicated that he would likely not file an 
official report. 
</P>
<P>
"I had my say, it was just two men screaming at each other, nothing more," 
Montague said. "I think going to the league might be a little like going to the 
teacher and telling on somebody. He was frustrated, I was tired." 
</P>
<P>
Not that Montague wasn't also surprised. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just walking in there with Ross and then I hear this stuff and I yell at 
Belcher, 'You talking to me?' " recounted Montague, who had just flown in 
Tuesday morning from Cincinnati and had been doing deep knee bends behind the 
plate for the entire 5-hour 21-minute game. "I thought, 'Hey, I'm not going to 
take this stuff from anybody, I don't care if it's Tim Belcher, I don't care 
who it is.' It was completely uncalled for." 
</P>
<P>
Belcher, who earlier this season shouted at teammates after a loss, agreed. 
Once again, the second-year player said he was a victim of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't anything against Eddie, if it wasn't him, I would have yelled at a 
teammate, or maybe even gone home and yelled at my wife," Belcher said. "If 
anything, he did remarkably well for what time of day it was. I was just 
frustrated with how everything had turned out that night. All my life, I've 
expected to succeed every time I go out there. Sometimes I'm harder on myself 
than anybody else. I don't think that's a fault, but sometimes . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night was one of those times, as Belcher entered the game in the 14th 
inning, maybe a little weary. He had been the losing pitcher in Monday night's 
5-3 loss at Cincinnati, and had been lifted from the rotation Saturday to make 
room for Tuesday's starter John Tudor. 
</P>
<P>
He gave up one hit in three innings, but in the meantime the Dodgers had only 
two hits off Padre relievers. Then came the 17th, when Gwynn led off with a 
one-out grounder that bounced over the head of second baseman Dave Anderson. 
Three pitches later Gwynn stole second, just beating Anderson's tag. Jack Clark 
was then intentionally walked, bringing up Chris James, who at the time was one 
for seven in the game. 
</P>
<P>
But James stuck out his bat and grounded a ball between first and second base, 
scoring Gwynn and sending Clark to third. Garry Templeton then drove in Clark 
with a flyball to left. After the Dodgers went down in order against winner Pat 
Clements, Belcher had fallen to 4-8 with a 3.28 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
Don't look for the Dodgers to do anything in this incident other than remind 
Belcher to keep his cool. But maybe remind him more than once. 
</P>
<P>
"Stuff like this happens, but he didn't bump him, everything is OK, it's over, 
now we go on," Ferguson said. "From something like this, you learn."

PADRES TRADE MCKEON'S SON-IN-LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Manager Jack McKeon confirmed Wednesday night that the San Diego Padres have 
traded pitcher Greg Booker, McKeon's son-in-law, to the Minnesota Twins for a 
player to be named. 
</P>
<P>
The player is believed to be pitcher Fred Toliver (1-3), who has a 7.76 
earned-run average. Toliver has not cleared waivers, but if he is unclaimed by 
this afternoon, he will join the Padres Friday in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Booker, who has not appeared in a game since June 9, was almost traded a month 
ago in a deal with the Chicago Cubs that would have brought shortstop Shawon 
Dunston. 
</P>
<P>
Booker is expected to report to the Twins' triple-A club in Portland, Ore., for 
a 10-day assignment before joining the big league club after the All-Star 
break. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988 with Minnesota, Toliver was 7-6 with a 4.24 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Booker was 0-1 with a 4.26 ERA this season with the Padres. His ERA is the 
highest on the club. Booker had a 5-6 career record before this season with a 
3.76 ERA. BOB NIGHTENGALE

EXCERPTS OF ROSE'S DEPOSITION APRIL 20-21 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pete Rose put what he said was his 1975 World Series ring on display at a 
Cincinnati bank in April to show he hadn't sold it to pay a gambling debt. 
</P>
<P>
 In his deposition to baseball investigators on April 20-21, Rose admitted it 
was a sham and that the ring had been sold to New Jersey collector Barry 
Halper. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose was hesitant to tell investigator John Dowd the truth behind the ring. 
</P>
<P>
 Dowd: Let me go back to the World Series ring for a minute. I read somewhere 
recently that there's some World Series rings on display at Kentucky National 
Bank? 
</P>
<P>
Rose: Right. The branch office, downtown Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Dowd: Is the '75 World Series ring there? 
</P>
<P>
Rose: The one I have is there, yeah. 
</P>
<P>
Dowd: It is? I thought you traded it? That's what I'm confused about. 
</P>
<P>
Rose: I did. 
</P>
<P>
Dowd: Pardon? 
</P>
<P>
Rose: I did. But I had a new one made for me just for my personal use. I don't 
ever wear it. . . . What I was telling you yesterday, that the authentic ring 
is owned by Barry Halper . . . I wasn't going to hide that from you. 
</P>
<P>
 The ring matter came up in April when published reports out of Boston linked 
Rose to convicted bookmaker Joseph S. Cambra. The reports said Cambra had 
Rose's 1975 World Series ring, but Rose contended Cambra had only a copy of the 
ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "My World Series ring is at home," Rose said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 To prove his point, Rose asked that a northern Kentucky bank put his 1975, 
1976 and 1980 championship rings on display. The display was heavily covered by 
the media, with The Cincinnati Post running a color picture of the three rings 
on its front page.

The Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders who quit last week over proposed uniform and 
policy changes have returned after a meeting with Jerry Jones, the team's new 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
The 14 veteran members of the group had resigned, saying that Jones wanted them 
to fraternize with the players and wear more revealing costumes. In returning, 
they said they had been assured by Jones that the former policies would not 
change. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie Haynes, the cheerleader squad's director, said that the organization 
could not have survived without the 14 veterans because they provided 
leadership and served as role models for the rookies.

The Athletics Congress suspended for three months race walker Alan Price of 
Washington, for testing positive for banned over-the-counter drugs. Price, 42, 
tested positive in a sample taken at the U.S. 50-Kilometer Walk Championships 
March 5 at Atlanta, where he finished 12th. The substances found -- ephedrine, 
pseudoephedrine and phenylpropanolamine -- are commonly used in cold remedies 
and eye drops but are banned under the rules of the International Amateur 
Athletic Federation, the world governing body for track and field. 
</P>
<P>
Price has won 10 national titles, including 100-kilometer championships in 
1979, 1981 and 1984, and 100-mile titles in 1978-79, 1981, 1983-84-85 and 1987.

GET OUT OF DODGE: HUBBARD SELLING INTERESTS IN KANSAS TRACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bill Christine 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dee Hubbard, who spends a lot of his time trying to acquire race tracks, 
unexpectedly sold his interests in three pari-mutuel plants in Kansas last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Reportedly disenchanted with his partner, and concerned about cost over-runs on 
the two-track Woodlands thoroughbred/dog racing facility in Kansas City, Kan., 
Hubbard made a tentative deal to sell those properties as well as a new dog 
track in Pittsburg, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
The buyer is Paul Bryant Jr., the son of Bear Bryant, the late football coach 
at Alabama. The price is said to be about $68 million; approval by Kansas state 
racing authorities is expected. 
</P>
<P>
Bailing out in Kansas is a departure for Hubbard, who has bought Ruidoso Downs, 
the quarter horse track in New Mexico, and who has actively sought to buy both 
Hollywood Park and its sister track, Los Alamitos, in recent years. Hubbard is 
a major force in a group that currently has a $68-million offer on the table to 
buy struggling Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard's partner in Kansas City was Dick Boushka, a basketball star at St. 
Louis University who played with Bill Russell on the U.S. team that won the 
gold medal in the 1956 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant operates two successful greyhound tracks in Alabama and one each in Iowa 
and Idaho, and is seeking a license to operate a dog track in Galveston, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
He has no experience in horse racing, but in assuming Hubbard's contract will 
be obligated -- or pay a penalty of $5 million -- to complete construction of 
the horse racing phase of the dual Woodlands complex. The greyhound season is 
scheduled to open in mid-September and horses are expected to begin running at 
the Woodlands next May. 
</P>
<P>
After announcing last year that the Woodlands facility would cost about $56 
million, Hubbard learned recently that the total would be closer to $70 
million. The cost of the dog track in Pittsburg is estimated at $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
It's fortunate for Blushing John that this year's Breeders' Cup will be run at 
Gulfstream Park in Florida rather than at Belmont Park, which is where the 
seven-race, $10-million card will be run next year. 
</P>
<P>
Blushing John needs to run on Lasix, the anti-bleeder medication, which is 
permitted in Florida but not in New York. Blushing John's victories -- with 
Lasix -- in the Pimlico Special and the Hollywood Gold Cup make him one of the 
favorites for the $3-million Breeders' Cup Classic at Gulfstream on Nov. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Dick Lundy knew that Blushing John had a bleeding problem when the colt 
arrived here from Europe last fall. Arkansas also permits horses to run while 
being treated with Lasix, which was one of the reasons that Lundy started 
Blushing John's American career at Oaklawn Park there. 
</P>
<P>
It's one of the nagging inconsistencies about the Breeders' Cup that the races 
are run under different medication rules, depending on the host track's 
location. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Meeker, president of Churchill Downs, is confident that his track will get 
the Breeders' Cup in 1991, which would be the second time in four years for 
Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Anita should be favored to get the Breeders' Cup in 1992, although the 
newly rebuilt Arlington International, which opened Wednesday, can be expected 
to make a big pitch. Three of the first four Breeders' Cups -- two at Hollywood 
Park and one at Santa Anita -- were held in California, but the races haven't 
been run on the West Coast since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Hilco Scamper is a maiden again. 
</P>
<P>
That's because the thoroughbred sprinter has been running against quarter 
horses at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
Despite having won seven races -- five of them stakes -- in his own league in 
1985 and 1987, the 6-year-old gelding is considered to be a maiden at Los 
Alamitos, where he has finished second and sixth in two starts at 870 yards. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, as a 2-year-old, Hilco Scamper was one of the fastest horses in the 
country. He won his first five races by a total margin of 36 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
After that, though, the Washington-bred developed the same injury -- a severe 
tendon problem -- as his dam, Lucky Sport, whose career consisted of two races. 
</P>
<P>
Hilco Scamper's problems probably began when he ran in the Hopeful at Saratoga 
-- his first major race -- and finished seventh on a sloppy track as the 9-10 
favorite. He was never the same after that. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't run again as a 2-year-old, almost dying after an infection caused an 
abscess that had to be drained through surgery. He ran only once in 1986, made 
a mild comeback with two wins in 1987 and then ran in just one race last year. 
</P>
<P>
Part of Hilco Scamper's therapy this year consisted of swimming, and his 
second-place finish at Los Alamitos was his first race in 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to get him back into competition against thoroughbreds again," said 
John Roche, one of Hilco Scamper's owners. "I know he's lost a step or two. A 
lot of things have happened to him, but it looks like he's going to do some 
running again and we're encouraged." 
</P>
<P>
The horse that ran third in the English Derby was a California-bred. 
</P>
<P>
Cacoethes, who finished seven lengths behind the winner, Nashwan, is a son of 
Alydar and Careless Notion, the broodmare who also produced Fabulous Notion, a 
filly who won nine of 16 starts and earned $700,000. 
</P>
<P>
Cacoethes -- it's Latin for bad habits -- was bred by Ray and Fran Stark and 
sold as a yearling at Keeneland for $255,000. He won stakes in England before 
and after the Derby and is believed to be the first California-bred to win in 
Great Britain since George Pope exported some horses there in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, Cacoethes' name was Our Friend Elvis. Guess that was too American 
for Lady Harrison, who owns the colt now. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Open Mind, who's on an eight-stake winning streak, will try to become the 
seventh horse to sweep the New York triple for 3-year-old fillies when she runs 
in the Coaching Club American Oaks on Monday at Belmont Park. Beyond that race, 
trainer Wayne Lukas is thinking about running Open Mind against colts in the 
$1-million Travers at Saratoga in August. . . . Some Romance had earned almost 
$145,000 without winning a race this year when she won the Post Deb last 
Saturday at Monmouth Park. Part of Some Romance's problem was that she was 
frequently hooking up with her talented stablemates, Open Mind and Imaginary 
Lady. 
</P>
<P>
When King Glorious won the Ohio Derby, he raced on Lasix for the first time, 
after a small amount of blood had showed up in his throat after a workout at 
Thistledown. . . . Saturday is "Jockeys Across America Day." Many jockeys will 
be donating one mount fee to the Don MacBeth Memorial Jockey Fund, which helps 
disabled jockeys. The fund, named after the jockey who died of cancer in 1987, 
has collected about $250,000. The leaders of the cause are Chris McCarron and 
his wife, Judy, and comedian/horse owner Tim Conway. Since 1940, 125 jockeys 
have died on the track, there are 36 paralyzed from injuries, and in the first 
six months of last year, almost 800 jockeys were injured.

REINHOLD MESSNER -- CREAM OF CLIMBERS -- RISES TO TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SNOWBIRD, Utah 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reinhold Messner has been to the mountaintops -- the 14 highest in the world -- 
and what he has seen appalls him. 
</P>
<P>
Cable cars crisscross the great mountains of Europe, trash lines the routes 
into the Himalayas and Mt. Everest is overcrowded with expeditions. "Most of 
the expeditions the last five years have been less for adventure and more for 
show," Messner says. 
</P>
<P>
That is the inspiration for Messner's "White Wilderness" concept to defend the 
world's remaining unexplored regions against abusive intrusion -- white in that 
they appear as blank areas on maps, places where only Messner and others like 
him care to go. 
</P>
<P>
He expounded on his idea this month at the Mountain Summit, a gathering 
organized by Dan McConnell of Seattle of some of the world's best climbers, 
among whom Messner is a giant. He has made more than 3,000 climbs, including 
about 100 firsts and all 14 of the world's peaks that reach higher than 8,000 
meters (26,000 feet), most without using oxygen, and several alone. 
</P>
<P>
Climbs, he says, not conquests. Messner has paid a dear price. He has lost a 
brother and several friends, six toes and a fingertip, the latter because of 
frostbite. 
</P>
<P>
"I never conquer a mountain," he said. "You cannot conquer a mountain. This 
(thinking) is typical of the '50s." 
</P>
<P>
In 1953, Sir Edmund Hillary of New Zealand, and Sherpa guide Tenzing Norgay 
became the first to ascend Everest, the highest of all at 29,100 feet, 
according to a recent re-survey. The feat launched a new era in mountaineering 
and elevated the high-altitude climber into a romanticized role that few 
non-climbers can really understand. 
</P>
<P>
"I see the mountain as a big piece of nature which excludes human beings, and 
should remain like this," Messner said. "You can't go and see it, and it's 
difficult to watch on television, especially live." 
</P>
<P>
Those who have experienced it know that the mountain is not something 
beautiful, Messner said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something strong and destroying people," he said. "It's something for 
staying a few weeks, a few months, but not forever." 
</P>
<P>
So Messner will leave the mountains alone for a while and alter his goals from 
vertical to horizontal. In October, he and Arvet Fuchs will attempt to walk 
across Antarctica without support or the use of sled dogs. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a chance to have live television on the Antarctica expedition and I 
refused," Messner said. "It would not be the same thing. I would have to 
prepare such a big expedition that my experience, my adventure, would not be 
the same." 
</P>
<P>
His purpose: "I go to show it is still a clean place for adventure -- not to 
store atomic wastes or to explore for (oil)." 
</P>
<P>
Messner, 44, grew up in the Sud Tirol region of northeastern Italy, a 
cross-culture pocket of German-speaking people whose Alpine territory has been 
disputed since medieval times. 
</P>
<P>
It was Austrian territory until after World War I, when it became part of 
Italy. But at the outbreak of World War II, according to Messner, 90% of the 
people identified more with Hitler's Third Reich than with Mussolini -- a fact, 
he says, that "nobody likes to speak about." 
</P>
<P>
Messner, born at the end of World War II, wrote one of his 29 books on the 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
His home, he says, is "one of the most beautiful climbing areas of the world, 
like Yosemite Valley. Maybe more beautiful. Now they made roads and (it's) all 
full of skiing areas. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was 5 years old, I did my first climb with my father . . . climbed a 
10,000-foot peak. And from there, a little more difficult every year." 
</P>
<P>
Messner started as a rock climber, with no interest in lofty summits, but it 
was probably inevitable that as he exhausted the available challenges he would 
find his way to the Himalayas -- there, to mold his ethic to climb without 
oxygen and to climb alone. 
</P>
<P>
"On my first expedition at 8,000 meters I left my brother, and my second 
expedition at 8,000 meters I left two friends," he said. "After that, I said, 
'In the future, I will do it alone so I am not responsible for them.' 
</P>
<P>
"But the other reason is the experience: to be alone with your own fears. If 
you are on your own in a difficult situation, it's difficult to handle it by 
yourself . . . nobody to lean on. It's much more difficult to climb without a 
partner than without oxygen." 
</P>
<P>
Reinhold Messner, the most celebrated mountaineer of modern times, afraid? 
</P>
<P>
"Many times," he said. "On all big climbs, there is a moment before you start 
from base camp . . . knowing all the climbing history and all the things that 
can happen on a big mountain. Each of us is human. We make mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are on top of the climbing scene, it is very difficult to stay alive on 
the small line between doing something foolish and doing something great. If 
you do one mistake in a difficult situation, you did it. Forever." 
</P>
<P>
But more than fear, Messner has respect for the mountains he climbs. He speaks 
of approaching a mountain by "fair means." 
</P>
<P>
"I like to have for me, personally, the experience of what human beings are 
feeling at 8,000 meters," he said. "If I use oxygen, it's like going to 5- or 
6,000 meters. If I climbed Everest with oxygen I would cheat myself." 
</P>
<P>
Then there is Messner the environmentalist, who has seen hundreds of empty 
oxygen bottles strewn along the routes like aluminum cans. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't carry oxygen up, you cannot leave a bottle up there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Once he reached two 8,000-meter summits on a single climb, descending only to 
the saddle connecting them. It took eight days. He was alone. He used no 
oxygen. It was dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
So, it was suggested, is auto racing. 
</P>
<P>
"But in (auto racing) it is the velocity and the machine that decides (the fate 
of the driver)," he said. "In a big climb, it is nature which decides. There 
can be an avalanche, a storm. 
</P>
<P>
"But without the risk of death, climbing would not be the same. The motivation 
would not be the same. With the risk of dying, it's a totally different 
approach. We all know that death is one of the big taboos, especially for 
Western people -- not for Asian people. The most important fact in our life is 
we have to die. But normally we don't know this up to the end. 
</P>
<P>
"Going near death, you have a chance to know these things. Knowing about death 
means having the interest to know more and more -- not to die." 
</P>
<P>
Few -- perhaps no one -- will ever reach the heights that Messner has achieved. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be more difficult for the next generation," he said. "But they have to 
surpass. Otherwise, they stay the same, and human beings can never stay the 
same. 
</P>

JERRY MEYER IS LATEST OF BROMME'S WINNERS 
</P>

<P>
Ask a successful driver how he became interested in racing and the usual answer 
is that his father, or a relative, was a driver or mechanic, or that he started 
riding a minibike or driving a go-kart when he was 6 or 7. 
</P>
<P>
Not Jerry Meyer. The California Racing Assn.'s bearded sprint car leader from 
Chino didn't have the slightest inclination toward driving a race car until he 
was 20. 
</P>
<P>
Then one weekend, he and some friends went to Pismo Beach, rented five Honda 
Odysseys and went frolicking across the sand dunes. 
</P>
<P>
"We had so much fun I went right out Monday and bought an Odyssey," Meyer, now 
29, recalled. "I thought the other guys were going to do the same thing, but it 
turned out I was the only one, so I had no one to ride with. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to figure out where I could ride when someone told me about 
tracks where they held races. So my folks and I started going to places like 
Ascot, Riverside, Corona, anywhere we heard about a race going on. 
</P>
<P>
"After a couple of years, I was winning enough to go on the national circuit 
and my folks and I traveled all over the country, running the Odyssey." 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Meyer and his father heard about a sprint car that Ak Miller and Jack 
Lufkin, a couple of Bonneville dry-lake veterans, had for sale. 
</P>
<P>
"They said we could have it for $8,000 so we decided to buy it and try the 
CRA," Meyer said. "I told Dad that it would take five years before could expect 
to win a main event. That's how tough I felt the competition was in the CRA." 
</P>
<P>
Meyer was rookie of the year in 1985, finished seventh in points in 1986, won 
his first race in his parents' car in 1987 and last September got the ride in 
the red sprinter owned by Bruce Bromme of Gardena, the most successful car 
owner in CRA history. He finished third behind Ron Shuman and Mike Sweeney in 
the standings. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, Meyer will be in Bromme's No. 3, a Nance chassis with an engine 
built by Ron Shaver, in the 50-lap Firecracker 50 at Ascot Park as part of the 
Parnelli Jones Firestone CRA championship series. 
</P>
<P>
Bromme's cars have won 137 main events, the last five by Meyer, and five CRA 
championships in a career dating to 1938 at Southern Ascot. Before that, Bromme 
tagged along with his father, a riding mechanic in the days of Legion Ascot. 
</P>
<P>
Bromme won championships in 1965 with Paul Jones, Parnelli's brother, and in 
1980, '81, '82 and '85 with Dean Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson won 103 races for Bromme, including Firecracker 50s in 1978, '80 and 
'82. When Thompson retired in 1985, Bromme began looking for a replacement. He 
tried Sweeney, Jeff Haywood, Bubby Jones and Stan Atherton before settling on 
Meyer. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been watching the young man and I liked the way he was driving so we got 
together toward the end of last year," Bromme said. "I like the way he always 
finishes. He doesn't do a lot of crazy things, the way some drivers do." 
</P>
<P>
Meyer holds a 159-point lead over two-time champion Brad Noffsinger as the 
season nears its halfway point largely because of his consistency. Meyer has 
won only four races, but he has finished in the top 10 in 21 of 23 races this 
season and he has made the main event in 75 consecutive races dating to 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer also holds the track record for the half-mile at Ascot of 18.652 seconds, 
or 96.504 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
His scored his biggest win May 6 at Knoxville, Iowa, the Mecca of sprint car 
racing, when he beat dirt track veteran Jack Hewitt, a two-time United States 
Auto Club champion from Troy, Ohio, in a 30-lap chase. Meyer started in the 
front row and got off the line ahead of pole-sitter Noffsinger, with Hewitt 
right on his tailpipe. 
</P>
<P>
"I had always thought it was easier to run out front, but I found out 
different," Meyer said. "Hewitt didn't give me a second to relax for 30 laps. I 
could hear his motor all the way." 
</P>
<P>
Meyer also won consecutive races at Silver Dollar Speedway in Chico and won his 
fourth main event May 20 at Ascot. All of his victories have been over 30 laps 
and there has been some speculation about how Meyer will do over 50. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to it," he said. "I finished second to Brad (Noffsinger) 
on Memorial Day in a 50-lapper after I was running fourth at 30 laps. I passed 
Shuman and (John) Redican to get second. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the difference between 30 and 50 is as much physical as it is 
mental. Another 20 laps means that many more decisions, whether to go high or 
go low, or pass a guy in this turn or wait until the next one. You can get real 
tired mentally." 
</P>
<P>
Bromme's son, Bruce Jr., 37, is chief mechanic on Meyer's car. 
</P>
<P>
"Driving for the Brommes is so much more enjoyable than driving for myself," 
Meyer said. "Bruce knows what combinations will work and he knows how to set up 
the car to keep the driver out of trouble. I just go out and do what the car 
will do for me. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even ask what gears we're running or anything like that. I trust him. 
If I asked, I might want them set it up different, and we'd probably run 20th." 
</P>
<P>
After Ascot, the CRA drivers will make an Arizona swing, racing Sunday night at 
Manzanita Speedway in Phoenix and Monday night at Raven Raceway in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>

A brush fire that threatened two small Antelope Valley communities and charred 
more than 2,000 acres of mostly rugged terrain was 80% contained this morning, 
the Los Angeles County Fire Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
Though one home and two other structures were burned Wednesday when the fire 
skirted between Elizabeth Lake and Green Valley, forcing the temporary 
evacuation of 1,000 people, the fire was moving northwesterly into mountainous 
areas today and no communities or structures were threatened, authorities said.

INS ARRESTS 5 SMUGGLERS AND 47 ILLEGAL ALIENS IN RAID ON HOUSE

Federal immigration agents raided a suspected "drop house" early today in Bell 
where 47 illegal immigrants were being held until their relatives could buy 
their freedom, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Five smugglers were detained after the 12:30 a.m. raid on an apartment that had 
no furniture, no food in the refrigerator and only some beans on the stove, 
said Thomas Gaines of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
The smugglers found in the Bell home are suspected illegal aliens from Mexico, 
said Gaines, the assistant district director in the INS' anti-smuggling branch. 
</P>
<P>
The immigrants were Honduran and Mexican citizens, including a 17-year-old boy 
from Mexico and two women from Honduras, Gaines said. 
</P>
<P>
When the agents arrived, the telephone was "ringing off the hook" with 
relatives calling to pay the smugglers to free the immigrants at prices ranging 
from $300 to $700, Gaines said.

ABORTION SUSPENSE GROWS -- JUSTICES EXTEND SESSION; 
</P>
<P>
COURT MAY TELL RULING ON MONDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Raising the suspense over the most closely watched case of the decade, the 
Supreme Court failed to announce its decision on the fate of legalized 
abortions today but instead extended its 1988-89 term until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The court's lack of action disappointed the scores of abortion opponents and 
advocates who had waited in line overnight for one of the few seats available 
in the courtroom. Others milled outside the historic court building in 
anticipation of a decision that could overturn or retain a woman's right to an 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The justices are being asked to use the Missouri case to reverse the court's 
1973 landmark Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said from the bench, "On Monday, July 3, the 
court will announce all the remaining opinions during this term of the court." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the court left hanging its decision in an important case on 
church-state relations. 
</P>
<P>
That case stems from the holiday displays of a Christmas Nativity scene and a 
Hanukkah menorah at government buildings in Pittsburgh. Lower courts said the 
displays represented an impermissible promotion of religion by government. 
</P>
<P>
The court announced just two rulings from the bench during a brief public 
session. The Missouri case, called Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services, 
was not one of them. 
</P>
<P>
People on either side of the emotional abortion issue were left with another 
weekend of anticipation. 
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to wait for the court to hand down these decisions, of course 
it is difficult, but we remain optimistic," said Olivia Gans of the National 
Right to Life Committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Potential for Delay 
</P>
<P>
Faye Wattleton, president of Planned Parenthood, spoke of the potential for a 
delay into next year and said it would be "an indication of the turmoil that 
this court is willing to create in the country." 
</P>
<P>
The Webster case is one of three separating the court from its three-month 
summer recess, which reporters previously had been led to believe would begin 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Despite rumors that some justices are still writing opinions on the highly 
controversial abortion and religious cases, the delay could have an 
administrative explanation. For example, the court's computer print shop could 
be having trouble producing enough copies of the abortion ruling to meet what 
will surely be a flood of requests. 
</P>
<P>
The case has become the most closely watched Supreme Court controversy of the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The court must say something about the case, in which oral arguments were 
conducted April 26, before ending its current term. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of announcing a decision, the justices could choose to order 
another round of arguments during the term that begins in October. That would 
delay a decision until sometime in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Roe vs. Wade itself was a case that had to be argued twice before a decision 
was announced. Such orders are not rare. The court hears arguments in about 150 
cases each term, and since 1977 has held over at least one case for reargument 
the following term. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1973 decision, the court said women have a constitutional right, based 
on their right to privacy, to seek and obtain abortions.

A tearful Imelda Marcos quietly sang a love song today to her husband, ousted 
Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos, as he lay close to death. 
</P>
<P>
"We are praying for a miracle," she said. "If I could just tell him he could go 
back home (to the Philippines), I know this would save him." 
</P>
<P>
The Philippine bedside song, "How Much I love You," appeared to get a response 
from the deposed president, in a semi-comatose state with kidney, heart and 
lung failure. He opened his eyes and squeezed his wife's hand, friends claimed. 
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Corazon Aquino has refused repeated requests by Marcos to 
return to his homeland to die.

ISRAELIS IGNORE CRITICISM, EXPEL 8 PALESTINIANS

Israel expelled eight Palestinian activists to Lebanon today, defying criticism 
from the United States and human rights organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Military sources said the eight, accused of being organizers of the Palestinian 
uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, were flown by helicopter to 
the northern edge of Israel's self-declared security zone in south Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time Israel had deported Palestinians in six months. It 
expelled 13 accused leaders of the uprising to Lebanon on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether 55 activists have been expelled since the start of the 18-month-old 
uprising with no apparent impact on the level of unrest. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the deportees had waited months in prison while their lawyers tried in 
vain to overturn the expulsion orders in lengthy appeal proceedings in the 
Israeli Supreme Court. The orders were based on secret evidence withheld from 
the suspects.

A 28-year-old jobless man burned an American flag outside a University of 
Wisconsin-Oshkosh building today, saying it was a protest over his not being 
allowed to work at the campus radio station. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why he was burning the flag, David Machen said: "It is because the flag 
has been identified as the promise of the rights granted in the Constitution 
that are now being, I believe, grossly violated in my case by an official of 
the state of Wisconsin." 
</P>
<P>
Machen said he was involved in physical fights with station personnel when he 
worked at the station in 1978 and 1981. He blamed an "emotional condition" and 
said it has since been corrected.

BUSH TO WORK ON PAY RAISE FOR CONGRESS; 
</P>
<P>
BAN ON HONORARIA, CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORMS ALSO SOUGHT

<P>
President Bush said today that he will work with Congress on a pay raise for 
members and top federal officials, and will propose new restrictions on 
political action committees that contribute to federal campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
A fact sheet distributed by the White House said Bush would "work with Congress 
on the development of details" for a pay increase, a move members rejected 
earlier this year amid public outrage. 
</P>
<P>
It also said he will send Congress separate legislation seeking to ban the 
honoraria they earn for outside speaking engagements. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign finance reform was the focus of Bush's speech today before a group of 
congressional interns. 
</P>
<P>
The White House said his proposals were designed to lessen the power of special 
interests in politics. However, several would have the effect of harming 
Democrats the most because they are the majority party in Congress and control 
most statehouses, which have the power to draw political district lines. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's proposals would: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Abolish political action committees connected to corporations, unions or 
trade groups, while allowing so-called ideological PACs that operate 
independently of any such organization. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reduce the per-candidate contribution limit for the remaining PACs from 
$5,000 to $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
 -- More than double the amount of money political parties are allowed to give 
to each congressional candidate. For Senate races, the amount now ranges from 
$92,000 to about $1.5 million, depending on state population. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ban carrying over campaign funds from one election to the next. That would 
require congressional candidates to return leftover funds to the contributors 
or give the money to political parties or the government.

Former House Speaker Jim Wright left Capitol Hill for the last time as a 
congressman today, his 34-year career brought to an end by charges that he 
violated House ethics rules. 
</P>
<P>
Wright (D-Tex.) stepped down as Speaker June 6 and resigned from the House 
effective at the end of Friday, but he left the Capitol this noon while the 
House was debating a foreign aid bill. He and his wife, Betty, flew by private 
jet to Ft. Worth, where his supporters prepared a welcome home party and 
parade. 
</P>
<P>
Smiling and relaxed, Wright, 66, waved to the tourists and congressional 
staffers who happened to be in the area when he stepped out of the Capitol and 
walked to his chauffeured car. 
</P>
<P>
He joked with waiting reporters and photographers, "You ought to treat guys 
this well when they come to Washington. . . . They might want to stay."

CUBA FIRES NO. 3 MAN OVER DRUG SCANDAL 'DEFICIENCY'

Cuba's interior minister, Gen. Jose Abrantes, has been fired for "great 
deficiency" in this Communist nation's first drug trafficking scandal, the 
official newspaper Granma said today. 
</P>
<P>
It said in a front-page announcement signed by President Fidel Castro that the 
Communist Party Politburo decided to name Gen. Abelardo Colome Ibarra as new 
interior minister, a job diplomats say ranks third in Cuba's power structure. 
</P>
<P>
Abrantes, a well-known figure and long-time associate of Castro and his younger 
brother, Raul, became the first high-level government casualty in the scandal 
involving top Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez, a hero of the Cuban revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Granma said the Politburo decided to fire Abrantes in view "of the great 
deficiency in the direction of the Interior Ministry in relation to the conduct 
of a group of officials who during 2 1/2 years carried out with impunity drug 
trafficking operations." 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa and six accomplices, including Interior Ministry Col. Antonio de la 
Guardia Font, have been charged with helping Colombia's Medellin drug cartel to 
smuggle six tons of cocaine into the United States between 1987 and this year 
through military air bases in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
A military court of honor earlier this week recommended that Ochoa be 
court-martialed for high treason, with all its 47 members saying he was a 
traitor and deserved death by firing squad.

The West German Bundesbank led other European central banks in a surprise round 
of interest rate hikes today aimed at fighting inflation. 
</P>
<P>
France and Switzerland quickly followed West Germany, in moves that knocked the 
recently strong dollar lower against the European currencies. 
</P>
<P>
The Bundesbank said that its key rates would be raised Friday by half a 
percentage point, lifting the Lombard emergency funding rate to 7% and the 
discount rate to 5%. 
</P>
<P>
The Bank of France raised its intervention and five- to 10-day securities 
repurchase rates, its two main interest indicators, half a point to 8.75% and 
9.5%, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
In Zurich, the Swiss national bank increased its discount rate by one point to 
5.5%, effective Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Austrian and Dutch central banks also announced increases in their official 
interest rates. The Japanese central bank said it had no plans to raise rates.

Sales of new homes edged up 2.7% in May as mortgage interest rates continued to 
decline, but they remained well behind the pace set in the previous two years, 
the government reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said sales of new single-family homes rose to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 613,000 units in May following a 9.1% 
increase in April. The April figure was revised downward from the 10.9% 
increase reported earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The April increase had been attributed by some economists to an aberration in 
sales in February and March, when sales dropped 11.3% and 11.9%, respectively. 
Sales had risen 4.6% in January. 
</P>
<P>
The pace of sales in May still was well behind the 676,000 new homes sold in 
1988 and the 671,000 units sold in 1987.

ROSTENKOWSKI TO SEEK TAX HIKE, GIVES UP CUT IN CAPITAL GAINS

<P>
The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee has given up the idea of 
cutting the capital gains tax because of Democratic opposition, according to a 
published report today. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) said he plans to file a $5.3-billion tax 
increase bill with revenue-raising provisions instead of coupling a temporary 
reduction in the capital gains tax with expansions of tax breaks for low-income 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski told the Wall Street Journal that he encountered stronger 
resistance than expected from Democrats on his committee to reducing the tax. 
</P>
<P>
"I never anticipated there would be as much resistance to capital gains as 
there was," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats had argued that the tax break would be too large a benefit for 
wealthy people and also probably would cost the government revenue in the long 
run. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush supports the idea of cutting the capital gains tax, and 
Rostenkowski said his plan came after the President suggested to him, "Why 
don't you try to put together a package?"

A jury decided that outfielder Dave Winfield's live-in relationship with the 
mother of his 6-year-old daughter was a common-law marriage, opening the door 
to divorce and property proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict could force the New York Yankee slugger to pay the woman half his 
income of the last seven years. 
</P>
<P>
The jury Wednesday voted 10 to 2 in favor of Sandra Renfro, a 34-year-old 
Houston flight attendant who said she and Winfield lived as husband and wife 
from 1982 to 1985. Winfield married another woman in a formal ceremony in 1988. 
A divorce hearing is set for July 10. 
</P>
<P>
Winfield did not dispute fathering the child but denied that he ever intended 
to marry Renfro. He testified he has been paying $1,400 monthly child support 
and provided a condominium for Renfro and his daughter. Winfield, who has been 
out all season because of a back injury, left the courtroom after the verdict 
without commenting. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Alexander, Winfield's lawyer, said he will appeal.

John McEnroe overcame spotty play and a run-in with the umpire to advance to 
the third round at Wimbledon today, but No. 4 seed Gabriela Sabatini and No. 5 
Zina Garrison were ousted from the women's draw. 
</P>
<P>
Ros Fairbank of South Africa, a solid grass-court player, beat Sabatini of 
Argentina, who is more at home on clay, 6-4, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Louise Field, ranked 121st in the world, blew a 5-0 third-set lead before 
ousting Garrison, a 1985 semifinalist, 1-6, 6-2, 7-5 on her fifth match point. 
</P>
<P>
Fifth-seeded McEnroe, who needed the comeback of his career to survive a 
first-round scare from Darren Cahill, beat fellow American Richey Reneberg 6-3, 
3-6, 6-3, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
Other seeds who advanced today included two-time champion Boris Becker, who won 
in straight sets on Centre Court. Also advancing were fourth-seeded Chris Evert 
of the United States; French Open champion Arantxa Sanchez of Spain, the 
seventh seed, and Natalia Zvereva of the Soviet Union, seeded ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Evert, a three-time Wimbledon champion, came back from a 5-1 deficit in the 
first set to beat Hu Na 7-5, 6-3. The 34-year-old American, playing her 18th 
consecutive Wimbledon, won nine straight games to take the first set and lead 
the second 3-0. In all, she won 12 of the final 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
Field, who had not gotten past the second round in a Grand Slam tournament, 
used mistakes by Garrison to get back into the match, then survived a third-set 
comeback bid to score her biggest victory. 
</P>
<P>
"The chances were there. I just didn't take them," Garrison said. "It's not 
like she blew me off the court." 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe, seeded fifth, lost five straight games as Reneberg wrapped up the 
second set and took a 1-0 lead in the third on McEnroe's fifth of eight double 
faults. 
</P>
<P>
After losing the opening game of the third set, McEnroe was upset and tossed 
his racket during the changeover. When umpire Bruno Rebeuh of France gave him a 
code warning for racket abuse, McEnroe exploded. 
</P>
<P>
"That took a lot of guts. . . . An excellent decision," McEnroe yelled at 
Rebeuh. "I bet it says in the rule book that if he throws his racket, call 
racket abuse. An excellent choice." 
</P>
<P>
Although he questioned some line calls -- and muttered repeatedly to himself -- 
McEnroe kept his temper in check the rest of the way and turned his game around 
just when it looked as if he might be eliminated in the second round at 
Wimbledon for the second year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"He tried hard. I tried hard. He had games where he got hot. I had games where 
I got hot. I just got hotter at the right time," McEnroe said. 
</P>
<P>
Becker, the third seed from West Germany, defeated American Richard Matuszewski 
6-3, 7-5, 6-4 on Centre Court. 
</P>
<P>
Other women's seeds advancing to the third round included No. 12 Mary Joe 
Fernandez and No. 15 Lori McNeil of the United States and No. 14 Hana 
Mandlikova of Australia.
