<P>
A key House committee Thursday approved the most sweeping moratorium on 
offshore oil exploration ever enacted, putting 84 million acres of U.S. 
coastline -- including the entire California coast -- off limits from new 
drilling until October, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The action, which lifted the ban past its most formidable hurdle, marks a major 
victory for those who have urged new caution toward oil exploration in the 
aftermath of a series of major oil spills across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
It would effectively give Congress new control over a number of controversial 
offshore drilling plans, short-circuiting an aggressive effort by the Bush 
Administration to forge a consensus on the issue and unshackle itself from 
congressional limits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bitter Response 
</P>
<P>
In a bitter response, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. assailed Congress for 
"shooting at the wrong target" in failing to focus on the oil tankers held 
responsible for recent spills. To demonstrate the Administration's outrage, he 
announced plans to allow oil companies to begin drilling in a new 28 
million-acre, oil-rich swath of the Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The new congressional moratorium, approved on a voice vote by the House 
Appropriations Committee as part of a larger package, would go far beyond an 
existing drilling ban for Northern and Southern California, which has been 
imposed each year since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The expanded ban would, for the first time, cover a proposed lease sale off 
Central California and include vast regions in Alaska's Bristol Bay and off 
several mid-Atlantic states. Also included in the ban are areas off southern 
Florida and George's Bank, off Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
In an unprecedented step, the moratorium would also afford California the added 
protection of a ban even on pre-lease drilling activities, such as 
environmental studies -- a step certain to cause delays in the Interior 
Department's drilling timetable. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a critical victory at a critical time," said California Rep. Leon E. 
Panetta (D-Monterey), sponsor of the drilling moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
Another Californian, Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica), added, "We have 
effectively brought the entire sale process to a screeching halt." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Bill Lowery (R-San Diego), a longtime opponent of offshore drilling, said 
Thursday that he was "ecstatic" about the vote. "This is the best victory we've 
had in this seven-year fight," said Lowery, a member of the committee that 
approved the moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
Lowery said the six-vote margin of victory was significant because previous 
committee votes regarding offshore drilling usually hinged on one or two votes. 
The success was all the sweeter, Lowery said, because it represented the first 
time pre-lease activity off the California coast has been restricted. 
</P>
<P>
Lowery warned that Thursday's vote was only "one more major skirmish in a long 
battle." The bill must still be approved by the full House, then by a 
House-Senate conference committee. 
</P>
<P>
Lowery and other opponents of offshore drilling said they believe that 
worldwide coverage of recent oil spills may help persuade Congress that a 
permanent ban on drilling in sensitive areas is needed. "I've contended all 
along the technology is not there for spills," Lowery said. "Sadly, the Exxon 
Valdez and events of recent weeks have proven me correct." 
</P>
<P>
Others warned, however, that to put vast areas of the U.S. coastline off limits 
to offshore drilling represented a decision to cede control over U.S. energy to 
foreign oil producers. 
</P>
<P>
"This says that the energy policy of the United States is to do nothing," 
warned Rep. Ralph Regula (R-Ohio), the principal opponent of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Before becoming law, the moratorium must first be adopted by both the full 
House and Senate. But officials on both sides of the drilling debate said they 
expect the measure to be approved in light of the current climate of concern 
over oil exploration and its hazards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposes Measure 
</P>
<P>
While the Administration strongly opposes the measure, it is regarded as 
virtually veto-proof because it is included as an amendment to a vital 
supplemental spending measure that President Bush would be unlikely to block. 
</P>
<P>
If enacted, the moratorium would severely limit the influence of a White House 
task force appointed by Bush to advise him on whether drilling should proceed 
in controversial areas off Northern and Southern California and Florida's Gulf 
Coast. 
</P>
<P>
The task force, which has been seeking to strike a balance between the concerns 
of environmentalists and the nation's energy needs, has been instructed to make 
recommendations to Bush by the end of the year. Under the moratorium, however, 
the department would be unable to act until October, 1990, leaving Congress 
time to challenge any drilling plans that it still might find unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
"The task force has, for the most part, become irrelevant," said Robert Hattoy, 
the Sierra Club's Southern California regional director. 
</P>
<P>
Interior Department spokesman Steve Goldstein said the panel will continue its 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite clear that Congress is trying to usurp the actions of the task 
force, and we just don't believe that's correct or proper," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Controversy 
</P>
<P>
The new area put up for lease Thursday by the Interior Department lies off the 
coasts of Texas and Louisiana. The proposed drilling there has generated little 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
The heated debate over the drilling moratorium was made more ferocious by sharp 
differences among legislators over the lessons that should be drawn from the 
series of recent oil spills, including the damage caused in Alaska's Prince 
William Sound by 10 million gallons of crude oil that leaked from the tanker 
Exxon Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists and anti-drilling forces have contended that the experience 
should make lawmakers more cautious about all forms of oil exploration. While 
drilling has resulted in few spills, they noted that much of the oil gathered 
offshore must be transported to land by tankers. 
</P>
<P>
But the Administration, the oil industry and their supporters countered that 
new regulations ought to aim specifically at oil tankers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Imports Grow 
</P>
<P>
"We understand that emotions are running high. . . ," the American Petroleum 
Institute said in a statement. "(But) the rash of tanker accidents does not 
reflect on offshore drilling safety and does not change the fact that domestic 
production of oil continues to fall while imports continue to grow." 
</P>
<P>
The dispute was focused most directly on the effort to include Alaska's Bristol 
Bay in the new moratorium. The oil industry already has paid $95 million for 
drilling rights in the region, but Alaskan officials demanded the protection in 
the amendment out of concern that another spill could devastate the state's 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that years of environmental studies had deemed Bristol Bay safe for 
drilling, Regula warned, "If we can't drill here, we can't do it anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
But the committee, on a 29-22 vote, rebuffed his proposal to strip the region 
from the package. 
</P>
<P>
The special protection for the California coastline came under a provision 
preventing the Interior Department from conducting pre-leasing activity along 
the entire coast until October, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Survived Attack 
</P>
<P>
The provision survived an attack by Rep. Lindy Boggs (D-La.), who noted that 
the Interior Department needs up to 26 months to complete all of the steps 
necessary to lease an offshore oil tract. The pre-lease ban thus could extend 
the moratorium on drilling for up to two years, Boggs argued. 
</P>
<P>
But a powerful coalition of Californians and others who voiced concern about 
the recent oil spills defeated the Boggs amendment by a decisive 28-22 margin. 
</P>
<P>
David Coggin, Washington chief of staff for Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside), 
said, "The majority of the delegation working on this really did a good job, 
they really worked on getting those undecided or marginal votes to switch. Of 
course, having three oil spills the week before didn't hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Because Lease Sale 95 -- off Carlsbad, Oceanside and Camp Pendleton -- and 
Lease Sale 91 off Northern California have already been subjected to most 
pre-lease steps, the additional postponement would most likely affect Lease 
Sale 119, a massive portion of the Outer Continental Shelf off Central 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The Interior Department currently plans to begin oil exploration there in 1991. 
If the pre-lease moratorium is imposed through 1990, however, the auction of 
drilling rights for the Central California tract would almost certainly be 
stalled until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
That delay "is very welcome news to Southern Californians," Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
"It says to the oil industries . . . that they would be much better off 
dropping this fight," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Greenbrae), a fervent anti-drilling advocate whose 
district includes sensitive shoreline along Point Reyes and San Francisco, said 
she is "extremely pleased" with the committee vote on the new moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
Recent oil spills have evoked "a real sentiment that we have to be 
extraordinarily careful in the whole offshore oil drilling process," Boxer 
said. Now, she said, Congress "may well be ready" for legislation that would 
put areas permanently off limits to offshore drilling.

PROBLEMS BESET S.D. PLAN TO CUT DROPOUT RATE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Poor planning and coordination have plagued the first year of a much-publicized 
dropout prevention program that began in September as a $433,000 joint effort 
of San Diego city schools and private industry. 
</P>
<P>
Crucial elements of the innovative program have not yet been put into place, 
and administrators still have no data telling them whether the first students 
to receive special computer-assisted instruction, counseling and employment 
training have returned to their regular schools as hoped for or have dropped 
out, Deputy Supt. Bertha Pendleton confirmed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
A new, full-time administrator has been assigned temporarily beginning this 
week to the program at the city schools' Bandini Center in Southeast San Diego 
to try to iron out problems. The previous administrator had been assigned the 
role only part-time, a situation Pendleton said, was "overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disappointment Conceded 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to work through things," Pendleton said, conceding disappointment 
at the rocky road the Youth Services Center has taken during its first two 
semesters. Pendleton oversees the district's intensive efforts to begin dealing 
with its high number of dropouts, especially among black and Latino students. 
</P>
<P>
The Bandini project was conceived as a centerpiece to those efforts, modeled 
after a small but successful privately funded summer program piloted in San 
Diego for the past several years. The school district provided $150,000, and 
the Private Industry Council gave $285,000 as a commitment under the 
public-private San Diego Compact to prevent students from dropping out. 
</P>
<P>
The plan enrolls up to 60 junior-high students who are considered to be at high 
risk of dropping out. They are selected from targeted minority-area schools and 
given one semester of basic skills tutoring using a computer-assisted 
curriculum, instruction in motivation and self-esteem, and a part-time job or 
employment training. By removing students temporarily from an environment where 
they are failing, administrators say they can build confidence to attempt a 
successful return. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Return to Home School 
</P>
<P>
Following the intensive semester of individual attention, the students return 
to their home school, where counselors follow them closely as well as pair them 
with an adult mentor from the business community to help continue building 
self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
But Pendleton cited problems in all areas of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
While the three teachers selected for the program are all highly motivated to 
work with problem students, Pendleton said, they were not given sufficient 
training in the computer-assisted instructional program. That computer system, 
known as PLATO, has worked successfully in bringing poorly performing students 
up to speed in basic subjects in the Oceanside and Sweetwater school districts, 
according to county education statistics. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be visiting the Sweetwater district in the next week or so to 
take another look at what they do," Pendleton said. "I don't believe there is 
anything wrong with our (curriculum) model, but maybe there are some things 
that should be changed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Admitted Breakdown 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton also admitted a breakdown in tracking progress of the students and 
said she doesn't know precisely why such information is not yet available. She 
has no data to show how many of the 47 students who spent the first semester at 
the center -- September through January -- are now studying successfully in a 
regular program. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know where they are," Pendleton said, adding that there apparently 
has been poor communication between the center's staff and counselors at the 
regular schools. Pendleton said that every student who leaves the program is 
supposed to be placed by a district counselor, who will then maintain contact. 
"It's obvious we need a better articulation process," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody understood how hard it would be to work through the 
bureaucracy of the city schools as well as that of the Private Industry 
Council," said Jeanne Jehl, special assistant to Pendleton who took over the 
program's administration this week. "But I'm going to find out where these kids 
are because you can't tell whether the program is successful or not without the 
information." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Key Element Missing 
</P>
<P>
The mentor portion of the program has yet to begin, "and without it, we are 
missing a key element in giving ongoing support and nurturing after the 
intensive semester program," Pendleton said. 
</P>
<P>
Jehl hopes to have some type of mentor activity under way by this fall and said 
that private industry has now raised $15,000 for recruitment and training. 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest, the failure so far stems from the compact having difficulty of 
getting the attention of the business community about this program," said Jehl, 
who for several years was in charge of a more limited school-industry 
partnership that pairs a business with an individual school. 
</P>
<P>
"Many businesses here have yet to understand how important education, and the 
problem of at-risk students, is going to be in preparing trained employees for 
their companies," Jehl said. "Because of the area's high growth, businesses 
here compared to other regions are not yet hurting for employees, although they 
are beginning to feel it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Time Needed 
</P>
<P>
"In addition, it's difficult to get individuals to step up and get involved in 
tutoring, in being a mentor . . . it takes training, more time than we first 
thought." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Jehl said that most potential mentors from businesses "have never 
been to this part of the city," referring to the poor socioeconomics of 
Southeast, where the students live. 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton noted that the students selected for the program have both severe 
academic and non-academic problems, and that teachers have found it difficult 
at times to work with both the teen-agers as well as their parents. 
</P>
<P>
"At one point, we ran into some difficulty resulting from students coming from 
different gangs in the same class," Pendleton said. "But with the help of 
school security, and by moving one or two students out, we got control of it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Male Teachers 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton also expressed disappointment that no male teachers were recruited 
for the program, since positive male role models are considered critical for 
many of these students who come from homes without fathers. 
</P>
<P>
"Conceptually, I think we all agree that the model we have set up is valid," 
Pendleton said. "But we probably needed more time for planning, in that we were 
in essence setting up a new school with an interdisciplinary program." 
</P>
<P>
A formal review of the first year will be completed this summer, she said, and 
will examine whether the program might work better if housed at a regular 
school rather than at the isolated special center.

2 ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS MAY SETTLE SUIT FOR $500,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two prominent San Diego environmental groups are quietly negotiating an unusual 
legal settlement under which they would drop a highly publicized land-use 
lawsuit in return for about $500,000 from the developers of the controversial 
parcel. 
</P>
<P>
The deal, under consideration by San Diegans for Managed Growth and the local 
chapter of the Sierra Club, was assailed as "extortion" by a building industry 
official and "inappropriate" by a slow-growth leader, both of whom questioned 
whether environmental principles were being sacrificed for cash. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Sierra Club and San Diegans for Managed Growth are backing down from 
what their previously stated principles were, I have to question the 
principles," said Robert Morris, executive vice president of the Building 
Industry Assn. "Are they going to continue to do this? Are they going to 
continue to file more lawsuits against other property owners? And if they are, 
they've just found a unique form of income." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Dangerous Precedent' 
</P>
<P>
Peter Navarro, chairman of the slow-growth group Prevent Los Angelization Now!, 
also questioned the propriety of the proposed settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"A dangerous precedent is being set here," Navarro said. "I don't think you 
want to start trading small dollars for big pieces of land, and $500,000 is 
small dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the two groups and their attorneys refused to discuss the settlement 
negotiations, other than to acknowledge that discussions are taking place. 
Officials with the two development companies involved and their attorneys also 
declined to discuss the proposed deal. A negotiating session is scheduled for 
today, according to a source close to the discussions. 
</P>
<P>
However, Deputy City Atty. Les Girard and other sources close to the 
negotiations said that the two environmental groups are considering an offer 
from the Donald L. Bren Co. and the Brennan Katkov Development Corp., owners of 
land in the controversial 385-acre "county island" annexed last year by the 
city of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The two developers plan to build 676 homes on more than 180 acres of the parcel 
in the city's northern tier. But the two environmental groups last year filed a 
lawsuit against the city of San Diego claiming that 320 acres of the land 
belong in the city's "urban reserve," which is off-limits to development unless 
voters specifically approve the project. Those rules were established by the 
voter-approved Managed Growth Initiative in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Last June, a Superior Court judge ruled against the environmental groups and 
lawyer Michael Eckmann, a former plaintiff in the lawsuit. Eckmann withdrew 
from the legal action, but the two environmental groups have appealed to the 
4th District Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
Girard, who is defending the city, said he was told about the settlement 
negotiations during a meeting with lawyers from both sides Tuesday, though few 
details were made available. 
</P>
<P>
"That's my understanding. It's around $500,000," Girard said. 
</P>
<P>
Still unclear is whether the money would be earmarked for specific 
environmental projects or whether restrictions would be placed on how it could 
be used. Barbara Bamberger, the Sierra Club's conservation coordinator, said 
that one possible use of the money would be future lawsuits on environmental 
topics. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, the environmentalists turned down a proposal to use the money to 
help the city buy Famosa Slough, one source said. Preserving the slough has 
long been a goal of local environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not for Political Use 
</P>
<P>
Another source close to the negotiations said that the Bren company wants 
assurances that the money would not be used for political purposes. Without 
such restrictions, for example, the money might be used to bolster 
environmentalists' opposition to pro-development San Diego City Council 
candidates Gloria McColl, Ed Struiksma and Judy McCarty who face reelection 
Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Sierra Club released an analysis of 45 key 
environmental votes over the past 32 months, labeling Struiksma and McCarty 
members of an anti-environmental "Steamshovel Brigade" on the council. 
</P>
<P>
Also undecided is when and how the money might be paid, and whether it would be 
split by the organizations or placed into a separate fund, according to a 
source close to the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The developers are not prohibited from proceeding with the construction 
projects, which were approved by a divided City Council on June 5, 1988, but as 
long as the lawsuit is pending they face the risk that the appeals court will 
rule against the city and place the land off-limits to development. 
</P>
<P>
Eckmann, who lives near the area and is a candidate for Struiksma's council 
seat, said that vegetation has been cleared from some of the acreage and that 
preparation for water and sewer pipe hookups has been made. 
</P>
<P>
For the developers, a $500,000 settlement is a "straight business deal," said 
one attorney close to the settlement negotiations. "Five hundred thousand 
dollars may sound like a lot of money, but not when you've got huge interest 
payments that you're making. From the developer's point of view, it's cheaper 
to go forward like this."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL TO OFFER ITS OWN LEASH LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Hermosa Beach City Council majority, contending that a group of dog owners is 
seeking an exemption from the leash law under the guise of an open-space 
initiative, has added its own ballot measure. It would designate a 20-acre 
railroad right of way as parkland but ban unleashed dogs from the strip. 
</P>
<P>
The council-sponsored measure for the November ballot was adopted on a split 
vote Tuesday. It will compete with the initiative circulated by Watchdog, a 
group that formed in March after the council decided to apply the leash law on 
the Santa Fe Railway right of way once the city acquires ownership later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Both initiatives would designate the railroad strip as open space that could 
never be used for residential, commercial or other development. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Watchdog initiative, which easily qualified for the ballot, would 
allow unleashed dogs on the strip, whereas the council measure would bar them.

Sewer workers throwing smoke bombs? Sounds like the kind of activity that would 
have appealed to Ralph Kramden's friend, Ed Norton. 
</P>
<P>
But this wasn't mischief. Sewer detectives with the Los Angeles Public Works 
Department went prowling beneath Van Nuys on Thursday. They were smoke-testing 
for leaks in the city's pipes as well as unauthorized connections to the sewer 
system, which was once featured in the movie, "Alligator." 
</P>
<P>
No sooner had they set off one bomb than odorless smoke drifted up through a 
front lawn on not-so-dull Lull Street. The smoke indicated that the house had a 
leaky yard drain; yard drains are illegal because they allow rain and lawn 
water into the already overburdened sewers. 
</P>
<P>
Public Works, which has examined 250 miles of the city's 6,500-mile sewer 
system, has found numerous leaks so far. But no alligators. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe this is the flag the U.S. Supreme Court had in mind: 
</P>
<P>
The Beastie Boys, a bratty rock group, raised what a press release called 
"their own 15-foot-by-25-foot version of the American flag with the Beasties' 
logo" at the Capitol Records Tower in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
As for the real American flag, one of its biggest fans -- Thomas (Ski) Demski 
-- appeared in Los Angeles Superior Court Thursday. Demski insists on flying 
his 47-foot-by-82-foot Old Glory, though the city of Long Beach says it flaps 
too noisily.

The city was appealing a Municipal Court dismissal of seven misdemeanor counts 
against Demski on the grounds that the complaint was not properly filled out. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, the Superior Court's four-judge appellate panel tentatively voted to 
reverse the dismissal and send the case back for trial. A final ruling is 
expected next week. 
</P>
<P>
Stay tuned for the next Ski report.

<P>
It's odd how you can look at something for years without really noticing it. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Cmdr. Bill Booth, the chief spokesman for the Los Angeles Police 
Department, it's a press release form that spells out how information is to be 
passed from officers to the media. 
</P>
<P>
When a reporter showed Booth one warning contained in the form, he laughed and 
said: "I wonder if whoever wrote that knew what it meant. Fortunately, we 
haven't obeyed it." 
</P>
<P>
The form warns officers not to give the media "information which may later be 
pertinent to the case." 
</P>
<P>
Using information supplied by United Press International, this column 
incorrectly reported that Superior Court Judge David Yaffe threw out a lawsuit 
by a female stabbing victim. (The woman had alleged that security was negligent 
at County-USC Medical Center because her attacker was able to sneak into the 
facility and stab her again.) 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the suit was dismissed by Superior Court Judge Edward Ross, who ruled 
that no negligence was involved because "the only way to handle determined 
attackers is station police personnel by every citizen. . . . This is 
unfortunately the situation here." 
</P>
<P>
Unauthorized alterations of the HOLLYWOOD sign have ranged from HOLLYWEED (the 
work of a pro-marijuana group) to OLLIEWOOD (in honor of Ollie North). 
</P>
<P>
Now comes the latest indignity -- and from the industry itself! 
</P>
<P>
The opening credits for a CBS television pilot depict the sign being blown up 
-- and replaced by the show's title, B-MEN.

<P>
Could be the start of a diamond-roots movement:

$220,000 SETTLEMENT A START FOR REPAIRS TO DEFECTS AT HORTON HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE WOLF, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It wasn't quite what they were looking for, but members of the San Diego 
Interfaith Housing Foundation figure $220,000 is a good start. 
</P>
<P>
Now the foundation can start fixing the defects it claims were making life 
difficult for the residents of Horton House, a downtown housing project for the 
elderly and handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
But the amount falls far short of the millions that Interfaith was hoping to 
receive from the architects and contractors who the organization claimed did 
shoddy, substandard work on the high-rise at 333 G St. 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit foundation, which owns the building, filed suit against the 
architects and builders four years ago claiming, among other things, that the 
heating system, plumbing, ventilation and closet space were inadequate for the 
needs of the elderly residents. The case finally went to trial Monday, and 
ended with a compromise settlement the next day. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no admission of any liability whatsoever on our part," said Glen 
Rasmussen, attorney for the architecture firm of Tucker, Sadler &amp; 
Associates. "It's basically an agreement between the parties to put aside our 
differences." 
</P>
<P>
Interfaith chairman Bob Carpenter said his organization is pleased that the 
money would allow for some modifications to the building, such as upgrading the 
heating system, but added: "I can't really say we're elated." 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't enough to begin fixing all the things, but we can start," said 
Interfaith board member Crosby Milne. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Steven A. McKinley said the settlement was reached primarily because 
Interfaith's case was weakened by the testimony of a former official of the 
federal department of Housing and Urban Development, which oversaw the 
construction. "He testified that he consciously approved some of the 
construction problems that we believed were defects," McKinley said Thursday. 
The recently retired HUD official, George Bradvica, defended his testimony 
Thursday in a telephone interview from his Los Angeles home. "They wanted 
top-class material, they wanted everything gold," said Bradvica. The 
corner-cutting was necessary to keep the federal funding for the project, he 
said, "but I figured it was worth it if it would give 150 poor, elderly people 
a place to live." 
</P>
<P>
While the Interfaith board members may not agree with Bradvica's assessment, 
they are pleased that the money from the settlement will afford some work on a 
new heating system. "Those residents will be happier and warmer now, and that 
really was the prime objective," McKinley said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AIR PATROL SQUADRON TO GET A NEW ROOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Civil Air Patrol's Cadet Squadron No. 107 in Torrance will be getting a new 
place to roost after being forced from its aerie at the Torrance Airport in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
City officials and the cadet squadron have signed a lease that will give the 
squadron a 2 1/2-acre parcel of airport land for $1 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the 20-year lease, the volunteer-run organization has 2 1/2 
years to build two new aircraft hangars, plus classroom and meeting facilities, 
at the site on the airport's eastern end, said Roger Griffin, an 18-year member 
and former squadron commander. 
</P>
<P>
The squadron hopes to pay for the facilities, totaling about 6,000 square feet 
and costing an estimated $100,000, through fund-raising drives and donations, 
Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
The organization had its headquarters in buildings and a hangar at the Torrance 
airport since 1979. But the squadron was forced to leave its 7,000-square-foot 
facility when city officials decided to tear down the buildings on the site, 
which faces Crenshaw Boulevard, and replace them with a commercial development, 
Griffin said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: VISTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Vista man who was judged to be insane when he killed his brother at a North 
City West construction site was committed Thursday to a state mental hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Joel E. Ayala, 25, was told by San Diego Superior Court Judge Louis Boyle that 
he could be there for life. 
</P>
<P>
Ayala pleaded no contest May 11 to first-degree murder, and Judge Andrew Wagner 
found that he was insane at the time of the Aug. 5 shooting of Rene Ayala, 27. 
</P>
<P>
If Ayala ever wants to be released from Patton State Hospital, the burden is on 
him to prove to officials and a court that he has regained his sanity, said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Luis Aragon. The prosecutor said the chance of that is "next 
to none." All four psychiatrists who examined Ayala agreed that he was insane. 
</P>
<P>
According to a report prepared for the court, Ayala has been diagnosed as 
suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. Aragon did not oppose the insanity 
finding, saying Ayala had five years of documented mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
Aragon said witnesses told officials that Ayala approached his brother -- who 
was working on a house as a roofer -- with a .22-caliber rifle. Joel Ayala 
started talking nonsense, according to witnesses, then shot his brother twice. 
Ayala stood over his fallen brother, felt his pulse, and then fired three more 
times into his body.

SOUND DECISIONS ON WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Water wars do not always have to end in blood on the barroom floor with one 
party, or more, sorely aggrieved. In recent weeks, there have been two notable 
decisions that promise to end long, rancorous disputes with relative amity. One 
is in Northern California, but is likely to have an effect on the entire state. 
The other is in Nevada, but also is of interest to Californians. Each outcome 
provides strong environmental protection while continuing necessary supplies to 
traditional users. 
</P>
<P>
In Alameda County, Superior Court Judge Richard A. Hodge relied heavily on the 
state's evolving public-trust doctrine in reaching a preliminary decision on 
conditions under which the East Bay Municipal Utilities District could import 
water from the American River watershed to its Oakland-area service territory. 
Although East Bay has had a contract with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation for 
the water, environmental organizations and the County of Sacramento have 
battled the utility in the courts for 17 years, wanting to force the diversion 
from the Sacramento River rather than the American. The opponents contended the 
project would severely deplete flows in the lower American, damaging fish and 
wildlife and recreation opportunities. East Bay argued that the Sacramento 
River -- from which Southern California gets much of its supplies -- was too 
contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
Hodge overruled the environmentalists by allowing East Bay to take the water 
from the American. At the same time, however, he set strict flow standards that 
prevent the utility from diverting any water during dry periods in order to 
keep plenty of water in the river for spawning salmon and for recreational 
uses. The judge discussed at length the merits of the public trust doctrine, 
which was ratified by the state Supreme Court in the Audubon Society suit 
against the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power over depletion of Mono 
Lake. The doctrine provides that societal demands for water must be balanced by 
protection of natural in-stream uses such as fisheries. While Hodge refused to 
make the East Bay take water from the Sacramento River, where there was less 
danger of environmental degradation, he said that the "public-trust doctrine 
occupies an exalted position in any judicial or administrative determination of 
water-resource allocation." 
</P>
<P>
While neither side was entirely happy with the decision, both indicated they 
could live with it. Further details are to be negotiated before the judge 
renders a final decision. 
</P>
<P>
The Nevada agreement, orchestrated by Democratic Sen. Harry Reid, appears to 
settle court battles stretching back half a century over use of the Truckee 
River, which rises at Lake Tahoe and ends in Pyramid Lake north of Reno. The 
pact will provide water to the Pyramid Lake Indians to maintain their fishery, 
which is a critical part of the tribe's economic base, and also will give the 
Westpac utility new reservoir storage that will protect its service to the Reno 
area during droughts. The Reno Gazette-Journal described the agreement as a 
"truly monumental achievement." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps such cases will encourage other warring parties to see the benefits of 
negotiation. In Alameda County, Judge Hodge said he hoped to produce a decision 
that would allow all sides to declare victory. While he seemed to succeed in 
that goal, he also achieved an even higher priority: "The intention of this 
decision is to protect the river."

CONGRESSMAN BEILENSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have had the personal privilege of working with Rep. Beilenson over the last 
nine years in areas affecting this community and can attest to the fact that 
his interest in the well-being of this community has been demonstrated over and 
over and in many ways. This includes his work relating to issues such as 
transportation, environment and recreational space. 
</P>
<P>
Beilenson has been most active in securing funds to expand the Santa Monica 
Mountains wildlife areas. He has also been extremely instrumental in working to 
bring funds to provide recreational facilities for the Sepulveda Basin. It is 
through his efforts that the Valley will be the beneficiary of a 26-acre 
recreational lake, which will open within the next 18 months in the Sepulveda 
Basin. 
</P>
<P>
Beilenson brings a unique ability to representing not only his constituents but 
the country as well. His background enables him to present a broad view of the 
issues we face and his committee assignments have focused in those areas, such 
as intelligence, budgets and areas affecting the Rules Committee. He is an 
individual who I feel brings tremendous knowledge, experience and above all, 
the highest integrity to the office he serves.

IN THE SMOKE AND FLAMES, THEIR FLAGS STILL FLEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two American flags survived the major brush fire that was dying down Thursday 
after it swept through the Elizabeth Lake and Green Valley areas Wednesday and 
forced the evacuation of at least 1,500 residents. 
</P>
<P>
One flag belonged to Velma Majors. Along with porcelain figures handmade by her 
mother, it was among the few possessions she retrieved from the rubble of the 
house the Majors family rented on San Francisquito Canyon Road south of 
Elizabeth Lake, an isolated mountain community of 2,500. 
</P>
<P>
About half a mile away, Don and Mary Simpson also had a story to tell about a 
flag. But it had a happier ending, one more than a bit reminiscent of the "Star 
Spangled Banner." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One House Burned 
</P>
<P>
The Majors' home was the only house to burn in the fire -- a surprise to 
residents who surveyed charred hillsides and ruined lawns Thursday and said 
they had expected much worse. At its height Wednesday afternoon, the blaze sent 
up a fast-moving column of smoke and flames that blotted out the sun over 
Elizabeth Lake and had people predicting wholesale loss of property. 
</P>
<P>
An effective response by firefighters and some help from the winds, which 
diminished Wednesday after reaching 45 miles an hour, prevented more damage, 
residents and officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Majors said she and her family moved to the rented home four years ago from 
Redondo Beach as part of a growing number of transplanted residents to the area 
who endure long commuting trips to Los Angeles because they cherish the 
seclusion and beauty of the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
"We moved to get away from the hustle-bustle," Majors said. Of the fire, she 
said, "It comes with the territory. Just like earthquakes come with Southern 
California." 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters tried to save the Majors' home, officials said. But they were 
forced to back off by the intensity of the fire, which was fed by overhanging 
trees and heavy brush around the property. 
</P>
<P>
Helped by relatives and interrupted periodically by reporters and camera crews, 
Velma Majors sifted through what was left of her home. She pointed to a hill 
where the family recently held an outdoor wedding ceremony for her son and 
daughter-in-law in full Renaissance costume. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pictures Saved 
</P>
<P>
"No more Renaissance weddings, I guess," she said. "I just wish I had been able 
to grab some of the pictures of the house." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday afternoon, Majors said, she saw the orange glow of the fire in her 
picture window, then heard sheriff's deputies directing evacuations over their 
patrol car loudspeakers. The family bundled up her infant grandson and headed 
for safety ahead of the smoke. 
</P>
<P>
Arrayed on the blackened ground in front of Majors on Thursday were porcelain 
Nativity figures -- Madonna, infant Jesus, angels -- made by her mother. Majors 
said she was surprised that they were unscathed. She rubbed soot off them. "She 
does the most beautiful work," Majors said, her head down. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other possessions Majors and her family found unscathed was their 
flag. But the gloomy mood did not prevent the family from cracking jokes about 
their evident patriotism amid a national furor over flag-burning. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hasty Departure 
</P>
<P>
Like the Majors family, Don Simpson said he and his wife, Mary, wasted no time 
Wednesday as the blaze advanced on their home on the southeastern edge of 
Elizabeth Lake. They grabbed a family photo album, piled into their car and 
fled to an open area along with neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"One fella was pulling out in his antique car he wanted to save," Don Simpson 
said. "Other folks were rounding up their animals and their children." 
</P>
<P>
The Simpsons also expected the worst. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't figure out how it could still be standing," Mary Simpson said 
Thursday of the family home. Helicopters rumbled overhead toward the scene of 
lingering fires. The Simpsons have lived in Elizabeth Lake since 1966. Although 
the immediate community had not experienced a major fire since the 1950s, the 
Simpsons said they have seen the devastation left by fires in nearby areas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Rubble 
</P>
<P>
When they returned home Wednesday evening, however, there was no smoldering 
rubble. The garden and most of the greenery on the 5-acre property had burned. 
Flames had damaged a shed by a water storage tank and come to within 10 feet 
from the house. But the house was intact. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fire Department saved my house, that's for sure," Mary Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson said he had not given up hope. He flies an American flag on a tall pole 
in front of his property. And from the open area where he and his wife sought 
refuge, he thought he could occasionally catch glimpses of the flag through 
breaks in the smoke. 
</P>
<P>
"Once in a while I could see it," he said. "Then, there was a clearing period 
and I thought I could see the roof of the house. And then I thought it's 
probably going to make it." 
</P>

BRADLEY'S MAJOR ASSIGNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As he begins his unprecedented fifth term in office today, Los Angeles Mayor 
Tom Bradley can look back on a career that already stands as a landmark in the 
city's history. 
</P>
<P>
During his 16-year Administration, the longest ever, the mayor has helped to 
encourage a period of economic expansion that has made Los Angeles one of the 
first cities not only of America, but also of the Pacific Rim. As a champion of 
equal rights and opportunities, he has opened the corridors of civic power to 
men and women of all races and creeds. The changes he has wrought in this 
regard are so sweeping that it is difficult now to recall that he was the first 
black Angeleno elected to the City Council and the first ever to occupy the 
mayor's office. Perhaps it was his personal experience of bigotry that lead 
Bradley to work so hard -- and with such notable success -- to keep Los Angeles 
free of the communal rancor and racial divisiveness that have afflicted so much 
of urban America over the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the successes of the mayor's four previous terms, thoughts of what 
likely will be his last Administration inevitably are characterized by an 
anxious uncertainty. The serious questions of conflict of interest arising from 
Bradley's irregular handling of his personal finances and business transactions 
have yet to be resolved. Until the facts of this matter are fully laid bare and 
their consequences determined, conduct of the city's business is bound to be 
halting and distracted. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, bringing an open and equitable end to this affair remains the 
No. 1 item on the city's agenda. The second is to enact a clear, comprehensive 
and enforceable code of ethics binding on all Los Angeles' elected officials. 
Without these things, there can be no restoration of the public's badly eroded 
confidence in the city government's basic integrity. 
</P>
<P>
Recent public opinion polls here and elsewhere have found that popular faith in 
the ability of government -- particularly local government -- to solve 
society's most onerous problems is at an all-time low. This is doubly true in 
Los Angeles, where the city's most vexing difficulties have assumed a sweeping 
and fundamental aspect. 
</P>
<P>
A recent study by scholars from UCLA, for example, revealed that the economic 
boom of the past decade has obscured an alarming acceleration of income 
disparity. If it is not arrested, we confront a future in which an affluent, 
overwhelmingly white minority assumes the privileges and opportunities of a 
permanent ascendancy, while the nonwhite, non-Anglo mass of working people are 
relegated to the status of hereditary bondsmen, left to scavenge in the bleak 
wastes between the drudgery of dead-end jobs and the misery of utter 
destitution. 
</P>
<P>
Providing every man and woman with the means to achieve a decent livelihood and 
a healthy and humane environment in which to enjoy it are the only goals worthy 
of a great city. If Los Angeles is to make a start toward their realization, 
the people's basic belief in their city government's competence and honesty 
must be restored.

Tony Beilenson is indeed an intelligent, thoughtful legislator. This explains 
why he has won some tough assignments in Congress as a chair of the House 
Intelligence Committee, a member of the House Budget Committee, and a leader in 
efforts to reform the budgetary process. At the same time, he has shown a deep 
and abiding interest in the issues affecting the Los Angeles lesbian and gay 
community which is a sizeable part of his constituency, and our major concern. 
</P>
<P>
Tony has taken time to focus on many of the legislative issues affecting 
federal AIDS policies, and he has been totally responsive to our community in 
working to make funding and treatments available. He also has a 100% voting 
record on issues related to ending discrimination based upon sexual 
orientation. 
</P>
<P>
Tony has been a truly responsive, concerned and committed congressional 
representative. He has always made himself available to meet with our 
organization to discuss issues before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Beilenson is cherished because he places principle before politics.

OBNOXIOUS IT MAY BE, BUT IT'S STILL EXPRESSION; 
</P>
<P>
FLAG-CASE COURT BUILT ON HARLAN'S INSIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By YALE KAMISAR, Yale Kamisar is a professor of law at the University of 
Michigan and co-author of a widely used casebook on constitutional law. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John M. Harlan, who served on the Supreme Court from 1955 to 1971, was one of 
the most respected and admired judges of our time. Because of his strong 
analytical powers and superb craftsmanship, and what many regarded as his 
principled approach to constitutional decision-making, he was often called a 
"lawyer's lawyer" or a "lawyer's judge." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, because he usually gave great deference to governmental interests and 
on more than one occasion scolded his Warren Court colleagues for their 
"judicial activism" and "result-orientation," he became the darling of many 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, 20 years ago in a case called Street vs. New York, Justice Harlan 
wrote the opinion that foretold -- indeed, I would say, dictated -- the result 
in Texas vs. Johnson, the Supreme Court flag-desecration case that has touched 
off a patriotic storm. 
</P>
<P>
On hearing a news broadcast that civil- rights leader James Meredith had been 
shot by a sniper in Mississippi, Sidney Street, himself black, took his 
still-folded flag to a New York street corner where, in the presence of a small 
group, he set it on fire, shouting: "If they did this to Meredith, we don't 
need an American flag." New York law made it a crime "publicly (to) defile or 
defy" or "cast contempt upon" an American flag either by word or act. 
</P>
<P>
Harlan could think of only four governmental interests that might conceivably 
be furthered by punishing Street. After carefully considering each of these 
interests, the justice concluded that none of them could constitutionally 
justify Street's conviction: 
</P>
<P>
 -- As for an interest in deterring the defendant from inciting others to 
commit unlawful acts, Street's words "amounted only to somewhat excited public 
advocacy of the idea that the United States should abandon, at least 
temporarily, one of its national symbols." 
</P>
<P>
 -- As for an interest in protecting the defendant from provoking others to 
retaliate physically against him, thereby causing a breach of peace, Street's 
remarks were not so inflammatory as to come within that "small class of 
'fighting words' likely to provoke the average person to retaliation." 
</P>
<P>
 -- As for an interest in protecting the sensibilities of passers-by who might 
be shocked by the defendant's words about the American flag, "any shock effect 
on defendant's speech must be attributed to the content of the ideas 
expressed." And "it is firmly settled that under our Constitution the public 
expression of ideas may not be prohibited merely because the ideas are 
themselves offensive to some of their hearers." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Finally, as for an interest in ensuring that the defendant showed proper 
respect for our national emblem, "the constitutionally guaranteed 'freedom to 
be intellectually diverse and contrary' and the 'right to differ as to things 
that touch the heart of the existing order' encompass the freedom to express 
publicly one's opinions about our flag, including those opinions which are 
defiant or contemptuous." 
</P>
<P>
Because the New York law involved in the Street case had been applied in such a 
way as to permit the defendant to be punished merely for speaking contemptuous 
words about the flag, Harlan did not have to specifically address the question 
whether a person could be punished for physically destroying the flag rather 
than for uttering insulting words about it. But Harlan's consideration and 
rejection of the various government interests that might conceivably have 
justified Street's conviction seem to apply with equal force to someone 
prosecuted for destroying the flag as a form of protest. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist would not agree. Dissenting in Johnson vs. 
Texas, he maintained that "flag-burning is the equivalent of an inarticulate 
grunt or roar." The trouble with that view is that it is unsupported by the 
facts of the case. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Johnson's flag-burning occurred in the context of an organized 
demonstration during the 1984 Republican National Convention and after he and 
his cohorts had distributed literature and made speeches protesting the 
policies of the Reagan Administration and certain Dallas-based corporations. 
While the flag was burning, the protesters chanted, "America, the red, white 
and blue, we spit on you." Under the circumstances, there can hardly be any 
doubt that the defendant intended to convey a particular message and that the 
message was understood by those who viewed it. Johnson may be obnoxious, but he 
was not inarticulate. 
</P>
<P>
His conduct was no less imbued with elements of communication than Street's 
protest. Nor was Johnson's protest any less a form of expression than the 
conduct of a group of angry citizens who gathered on the steps of the Supreme 
Court to burn a mock robe of those worn by the justices. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson could have expressed the bitter dislike of his country -- and the 
burners of the judicial robe could have expressed their bitter dislike of the 
way the Supreme Cout decided Johnson's case -- in more tasteful and less 
emotional ways. But they did it their way. The First Amendment permits, and 
ought to permit, them to do so. 
</P>
<P>
As Justice Harlan said in another First Amendment case (one protecting the 
right of a person to inform the public of the depth of his feelings against the 
Vietnam War and the draft by wearing a jacket bearing the plainly visible words 
F--- the Draft): 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot sanction the view that the Constitution, while solicitous of the 
cognitive content of individual speech, has little or no regard for that 
emotive function which, practically speaking, may often be the more important 
element of the overall message sought to be communicated."

BUDGET HAS $21 MILLION FOR VALLEY PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The $49.4-billion state budget, which won final legislative approval Thursday, 
includes at least $21 million for legislative pet projects in the San Fernando 
Valley area, ranging from improving commuter rail service to establishing a 
day-care facility for the children of government workers. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers expressed hope that a portion of the $140 million in additional 
mental health funds in the spending plan could be channeled to Los Angeles 
County to reopen the East San Fernando Valley Mental Health Center in North 
Hollywood and to keep other facilities from shutting their doors. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate gave final approval to the budget on a vote of 34-3, after the 
Assembly on Wednesday approved it by a 66-3 margin. Gov. George Deukmejian is 
expected to act on the budget sometime next week. 
</P>
<P>
As the only Valley lawmaker on the six-member legislative budget conference 
committee, which in recent days has met to hammer out the budget, Sen. Alan 
Robbins (D-Tarzana) championed funds for a variety of projects. A smiling 
Robbins on Thursday sported a button that read: "I didn't die, I was in budget 
conference." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Possible Political Edge 
</P>
<P>
Robbins' role on the committee, on which he has served previously, was seen in 
part by colleagues as a politically savvy way for the veteran lawmaker to 
enhance his campaign if he decides to run for the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins has been raising funds to run for a supervisorial seat that does not 
yet exist, hoping that a federal lawsuit that has challenged the five-member 
board's makeup will force an expansion of the panel. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran lawmaker conceded that his "ability to fight for San Fernando 
Valley issues would be the platform on which I would run" if a Valley seat on 
the board was created. 
</P>
<P>
Despite party differences, Republican Assemblywoman Marian W. La Follette of 
Northridge acknowledged that it's "a real plus for the area" to have Democrat 
Robbins on the budget conference committee. Said La Follette: "It just seems to 
me that he does represent his district very actively and maybe he has in mind 
if he wants to run for some office at some other time . . . he'd be able to 
point to what he's been able to accomplish." 
</P>
<P>
After the Senate debate, Robbins said his top Valley priority in the budget was 
$10.1 million to pave the way for as many as three commuter trains a day from 
Simi Valley to Union Station in downtown Los Angeles. Currently, one Amtrak 
train a day serves commuters between Santa Barbara and downtown. 
</P>
<P>
As a way to reduce auto congestion, Robbins and Sen. Ed Davis (R-Chatsworth) 
tucked into the budget language urging the state Department of Transportation 
to establish a second Amtrak train between Simi Valley and downtown. A large 
slice of the rail funds are earmarked to improve tracks, including building a 
siding near the General Motors plant in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Valley area lawmakers also sought additional funds for mental health programs. 
Besides closing the East Valley Mental Health Center, the county has proposed 
curtailing a number of other mental health services in the Valley, including a 
crisis counseling center in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles), whose district includes part of 
the Valley, said the additional funds "should enable the North Hollywood center 
to reopen. . . . There's literally nowhere for these mentally ill people to go 
if they're in a life-threatening crisis." 
</P>
<P>
While Friedman termed the budget "a substantial improvement" over what 
Deukmejian sent to lawmakers in January, he expressed fear that the governor 
will "blue-pencil" important spending items. 
</P>
<P>
Among the funds set aside in the budget are: 
</P>
<P>
* $500,000 to restore the 12-acre Hansen Dam lake. The money, sought by 
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), would be used to dredge the lake and 
remove silt. 
</P>
<P>
* $800,000 to renovate a county-owned facility at the Van Nuys Civic Center for 
a child-care facility for the children of city, county and state employees. 
</P>
<P>
* $800,000 in seed money to the Valley Fair to develop trails, buildings and 
other facilities at an off-highway vehicle park at Hungry Valley near Gorman. A 
spokeswoman for Robbins said the Valley Fair hopes to stage an annual 
off-highway vehicle event there beginning in the spring of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
* $1.8 million for the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy to buy land in the 
Santa Clarita Woodlands and the Santa Susana Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
* $300,000 for additional parking at Los Encinos State Park in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
* $876,600 for the 51-acre undeveloped Santa Clarita Valley Sports Complex, 
including picnic facilities, landscaping and a parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, there were several appropriations for Cal State Northridge, 
including $2 million for a master plan for an education center in Ventura, 
$819,000 for plans for the Business Administration-Economics Building and $1.3 
million for a Science Building addition.

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: BUSALACCHI'S IS A BRIGHT STAR AMONG ITALIAN 
RESTAURANTS IN S.D. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON

<TEXT>
<P>
"Where do you like to go for Italian?" is a common question, the answer to 
which follows easily enough. Several places come to mind, and one of them is 
Busalacchi's, the Hillcrest trattoria that speaks Italian with a heavy Sicilian 
accent. 
</P>
<P>
Like Sophia Loren, Busalacchi's has mature good looks. It occupies a house of 
some age that shows its years to advantage, and the small dining rooms manage 
to be comfortable and intimate even when the place is bustling, which seems to 
be much of the time. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant's chief physical attraction, however, is the canopied terrace, 
heated during the evening to make outdoor dining not just possible, but 
pleasant. This handsome, well-appointed terrace definitely gives Busalacchi's 
some of its edge over the competition. 
</P>
<P>
Chef-proprietor Joe Busalacchi was born in Sicily and spent his early years 
there, and his menu is in many ways the only in town to emphasize the 
specialties of that large, historied island in the Mediterranean. All the 
typical Italian foods, such as olive oil, garlic and tomatoes are present, but 
these in truth are general throughout the Mediterranean, and the Sicilian touch 
shows up both in a distinctive approach to seasoning and in specific regional 
recipes. 
</P>
<P>
A bread that may not be specifically Sicilian but is decidedly delicious is 
offered hot, and replenished as needed; this is focaccia, interpreted here as a 
flat, relatively course dough dusted heavily with crushed garlic. The one 
problem with it is that one piece invites a chaser, and so on, and it is easy 
enough to fill up before the main course of the meal arrives. 
</P>
<P>
The very first dish mentioned on the menu is at once a signature dish of 
Sicilian cuisine and Busalacchi's most startling creation. This is caponata, a 
kind of fresh preserve or relish of eggplant, tomato, capers, olives and celery 
that can be served at any temperature but is best at room temperature, the way 
Busalacchi's serves it. The list of ingredients may sound unremarkable, but 
when properly combined, the result is ravishing; like many eggplant dishes, 
caponata has a meaty quality and is deeply savory. 
</P>
<P>
The appetizer list, in fact, neatly sets the tone followed by the rest of menu. 
There is a strong emphasis on squid (fried or stuffed), repeated later in the 
entree section, and on artichokes, also simply breaded and fried or stuffed 
with a sweet-savory mix of bread crumbs, Parmesan, raisins and pine nuts. 
</P>
<P>
Pine nuts and raisins, a very typical Sicilian combination, turn up repeatedly, 
even in the bucatini con sardi, a regional specialty that tops a particularly 
elegant shape of macaroni with sardines, fennel, pine nuts, raisins and a light 
tomato sauce. Some of the 17 other pasta choices are more familiar -- linguine 
with pesto, fettuccine Alfredo and the bolognese, or macaroni in a too 
mild-mannered meat sauce -- but most are a step or more off the beaten track. 
</P>
<P>
There is, for example, the spaghetti alla melanzane, which includes slices of 
eggplant as well as tomato sauce, and the pasta al Palermo, which tosses 
tubular penne with a highly aromatic sauce of capers, garlic, olives, tomato 
and sausage. The pasta tossed with ricotta cheese and marinara sauce is a calm, 
nicely mannered dish that sits at the opposite end of the spectrum from the 
pasta genovese, an unusual (for these parts) creation of noodles garnished with 
green beans and potatoes. Pungent pesto (a basil, garlic, nut and olive oil 
paste) is added to bring the dish together. 
</P>
<P>
Green beans and potatoes team again, this time with tomatoes and sliced red 
onions, in the Sicilian potato salad, a dish that might sound too heavy to be 
taken as a starter course. One friend of Sicilian heritage did just that, 
though, chattering happily all the while about how it reminded her of her 
mother's Sicilian potato salad. Oregano, rather than basil, seasons the dish. 
</P>
<P>
The entrees sampled on two recent visits were serviceable rather than 
brilliant, and the one that earned the highest favor was a simple calamari 
steak piccata, or sauteed squid filet fished with mushrooms, lemon, parsley and 
and a sauce of its sauteing butter enriched with white wine. This is a classic 
Italian preparation that works equally well with chicken and veal (the menu 
offers both) and is always a pleasure when properly done. 
</P>
<P>
The stuffed squid, or conical torsos packed with the sweet-savory paste 
mentioned above, were nice enough, but the sort of thing one might want to try 
but once. The filling lacked punch, and in any case, squid prepared in this 
manner tends to retain a strong hint of its innately rubbery nature. 
</P>
<P>
The seafood listing also offers a couple of fairly typical shrimp dishes 
(breaded and fried, and sauteed with lemon, garlic, mushrooms and capers) and 
several fish of the day, typically finished with oil, garlic, lemon and, in 
some cases, oregano. 
</P>
<P>
The most specifically Sicilian choices among the meat entrees are the vitello 
con melanzane and the spiedini, which take radically different approaches to 
the basic theme of breaded veal scallops. The vitello con melanzane is much the 
same as a cutlet Parmigiana, except that it includes a slice of prosciutto and 
another of fried eggplant between the veal base and the cheese and tomato sauce 
topping; no one ingredient really stood out, however. The spiedini method rolls 
breaded veal slices around provolone cheese, scallions and salami, then breads 
the bundles and finishes them on the charcoal grill. This is an excellent 
recipe, but the finished product seemed dry, and the crumbs were not crisp and 
brown like they would have been had they been basted with oil or melted butter. 
</P>
<P>
The dessert tray runs to elaborate ice cream fantasies catered from 
off-premises, and tiny, fragile and elegant cannoli prepared by Chef 
Busalacchi's mother. These last add up to only a couple of delicious mouthfuls, 
which is all one may want after one of the restaurant's copious meals.

JOY OVERCOMES PAIN WHEN SON, 19, FINDS FATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Father's Day took on a new meaning for Doug Vulich this year. It was the day he 
found his father. 
</P>
<P>
Doug's father had disappeared 17 years ago after he divorced Doug's mother when 
the boy was just 2. Vulich's mother, Lana Daniels, had told her son for years 
that Steve Vulich dropped from sight because she had planned to remarry and 
have her new husband adopt her son. 
</P>
<P>
"He bowed out of the picture for his son's sake," said Daniels, a Simi Valley 
resident. "I didn't know if he was dead or alive or what had happened to him." 
</P>
<P>
But on June 16, Daniels spotted feature photographs in The Times Valley Edition 
of Steve Vulich painting a giant water tower in Castaic. "I almost fell off the 
couch when I saw those pictures," she said. Two days later, on Father's Day, 
she showed the newspaper photos to Doug. 
</P>
<P>
"I was overjoyed," Doug said. He had longed to see his dad for years. "I told 
myself I would find him." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Vulich, meanwhile, had given up hope of ever seeing his son. He had 
remarried, moved out of the Los Angeles area and for 10 years skippered sail 
charters along the East Coast, Florida and the Caribbean. He returned to 
California a year ago to work for his father's painting business in Burbank and 
now lives in Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I would ever see him," Steve said. Doug is his only child. He 
had never received a Father's Day card. 
</P>
<P>
When Doug worked up his courage and called his father, he didn't know what to 
say. He finally blurted out: "Hey, Dad, how are you doing?" Both father and son 
said they could not hold back their tears during the ensuing conversation. The 
next day, they met at the home Doug and his mother share in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Doug has been introduced to uncles and grandparents he never knew. 
The whole family gathered over the weekend to celebrate Steve's 41st birthday, 
and father and son have discovered they are both avid cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
Doug also learned that his father is a daredevil who enjoys sky-diving. "I told 
him he was crazy." Doug had never considered jumping himself, but that was 
before he watched videotapes of his dad sailing gently to earth. "He does it," 
Doug said. "I want to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Steve is attending a sky-diving competition in Oklahoma through mid-July. But 
before he left, he experienced for the first time a basic rite in American 
fatherhood: He lent his son the keys to his car. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the joy of reunion, there is soul-searching and guilt for father, 
son and mother. "There's a lot of pain for Doug," Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think about why he couldn't keep in touch," Doug said. "I feel he should 
have kept in touch." 
</P>
<P>
Daniels said she and Steve had agreed that it was best to let her second 
husband adopt their son. Neither guessed her second marriage would fall apart 
as well. The adoption never became final. 
</P>
<P>
"There's going to be things they have to work out -- and questions to be 
answered," Daniels said. "But that will come in time." 
</P>
<P>
For now, father and son have agreed to focus on the future. As Daniels 
recreated a recent conversation, the two decided that they could enjoy the 
events and holidays celebrated by families everywhere. "We have birthdays and 
holidays," Steve said. 
</P>
<P>
"And we have Father's Day," Doug added. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," his father said, "I guess we do."

FAMILIES JOIN FORCES, BUY PROPERTY, BUILD HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For nearly 20 years, Margarita and Sam Revelas have lived in a small, rented 
clapboard house on the east side of Wilmington, a neighborhood that is dotted 
with oil wells and sliced by the tracks of the Santa Fe railroad. 
</P>
<P>
It is a neighborhood where many people find home ownership out of reach. And 
the Revelases, with five children, never expected to be an exception. "With 
these prices," said Sam Revelas, "who's going to afford to buy a home?" 
</P>
<P>
But the couple will soon take the home ownership plunge as part of an unusual 
do-it-yourself project that will improve the lot of 19 families in east 
Wilmington, as well as the neighborhood itself. 
</P>
<P>
The project began more than two years ago when the Revelases joined a group of 
Wilmington residents who pooled their money -- $15,000 apiece, much of it 
borrowed -- to get into the house-building business. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to helping themselves, they wanted to show bankers, developers and 
city officials that there is a market for single-family homes in Wilmington -- 
even in east Wilmington, where junkyards, abandoned cars and gang graffiti are 
an integral part of the landscape. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Construction Experience 
</P>
<P>
With experience in neither real estate investment nor development, they formed 
a limited partnership and used the more than $250,000 that they had raised for 
a down payment on three acres of land at L Street and McFarland Avenue, on 
which they proposed to build single-family homes. As blue-collar workers, many 
with experience in construction, they planned to cut costs by doing some of the 
work themselves. 
</P>
<P>
They named it Home Owners Partnership. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, others called it folly. 
</P>
<P>
But now, after numerous delays and pitfalls, Home Owners Partnership is 
beginning construction. The group has blueprints, a general contractor and 
financing -- a $2.2-million construction loan from the Bank of San Pedro. The 
sewer line was laid last week, and general partner Peter Mendoza says workers 
will soon begin pouring the foundations for the homes. 
</P>
<P>
From his back yard, Sam Revelas can look across the railroad tracks and watch 
the work progress. In a recent interview, he searched for words to convey a 
very simple desire: to own property. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'This Is My House' 
</P>
<P>
"It's something that you have here, inside," he said, tapping his chest with 
his fist. "This is one of the goals in life, to be able to own a home, to have 
something that we always wanted to have, a place where our children can grow up 
and say, 'This is my house.' " 
</P>
<P>
Technically, the development, which Mendoza hopes will be completed by 
Christmas, is a condominium project. That designation is necessary because the 
group does not own enough land to build 19 single-family houses and meet the 
city zoning code. But Mendoza says it gives the group an added benefit: a 
condominium association, through which upkeep of the development can be 
controlled. 
</P>
<P>
For his full-time work on the project, Mendoza will earn 10% of the difference 
between the cost of building each home and its appraised value. He said most of 
the homes will cost about $120,000 to build and will likely be valued at about 
$160,000. The majority of the stucco, tile-roofed houses will be one story, 
although a handful of investors will get more expensive, two-story homes. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the investors are first-time buyers and not all live in the 
community. Some, such as Olivia Fernandez, say they see the project as a solid 
investment, as well as a way to improve their community. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez said: "It was a chance to prove that single-family housing is still 
desired by people in the community as opposed to apartments." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Trends 
</P>
<P>
Home Owners Partnership is an outgrowth of two important movements in 
Wilmington: the slow-growth movement, and a trend toward neighborhood 
empowerment. 
</P>
<P>
The trend began in 1985 with establishment of the Wilmington Home Owners. 
Residents, seeing that their community was overrun with apartment developments 
as well as pollution, truck traffic and industrial blight, banded together. 
Their first major victory came in March, 1986, when they persuaded city 
officials to enact a moratorium on building apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Eight months after the moratorium was enacted, Home Owners Partnership was 
born, with Mendoza -- who has been president of the Wilmington Home Owners 
since the group's inception -- at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
There were dozens of obstacles to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
Among them were problems with Exxon Corp., which owned two oil wells on the 
property and eventually agreed to cap one; with the title search, which was 
complicated because of oil rights; with the city building and zoning code, and 
with the bank, which based its financing on the partnership redesigning the 
project with smaller houses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tired of Waiting 
</P>
<P>
As delays mounted, some investors also grew frustrated. They watched home 
prices shoot up all around them. Some dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
"It was always waiting, waiting, thinking we could buy that house right now 
instead of being in this project," Eliseo Sanchez said. He and his wife, Ana, 
stuck with the project, despite criticism from friends and relatives who 
"thought we were just throwing our money away." 
</P>
<P>
Those involved agree that it was the people who didn't have a choice, people 
like Sam and Margarita Revelas, who could not afford to buy a house any other 
way, who kept the faith -- and kept the others involved. Revelas said he never 
had a doubt about the project -- even when a potential buyer offered the group 
more than $1 million for the land that they had bought for $600,000 a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something I believed in since the beginning," he said. "I was one of the 
many that says, 'No thank you, you can keep your money. We want to see this 
thing through.' "

DODGERS, VALENZUELA PITCH IN AS PADRES WIN FOURTH IN ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Padres' curiosity was aroused. They had heard the talk. Read the box 
scores. But, could it really be? 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, with that guy, we knew anything was possible," Padre right fielder Tony 
Gwynn said. "We didn't think he could still be the same pitcher we were used to 
seeing, but with what he's done lately, I think we were anxious to see how he'd 
do?" 
</P>
<P>
Yes, it has been nearly a decade since a 20-year-old kid from Sonora, Mexico, 
emerged on the major league scene and became the creator of what is known as 
Fernandomania. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres knew that the innings and years had taken a toll on his left arm, 
but with Valenzuela winning four consecutive games after going 51 weeks without 
a victory, they wondered if the real Fernando was back to haunt them. 
</P>
<P>
"We all know what he's capable of doing," Gwynn said. "He's a guy that if you 
get just one hit off him, go one for four, you felt great." 
</P>
<P>
So you can imagine the Padres' ecstasy Thursday night when they came away with 
a 5-3 victory over the Dodgers, completing a three-game sweep over their 
most-intense rivals. 
</P>
<P>
"This is exactly what we were looking for," Padre Manager Jack McKeon said. "We 
couldn't ask for a better start for a road trip. Maybe this is what we've been 
waiting for for so long. "I know this much; we're sure the hell due." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres (39-40) took sole possession of fourth place, winning their fourth 
consecutive game for the first time since they won five straight May 15-20. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, playing against the Dodgers, the Padres are beginning to feel like 
the '27 Yankees. The Padres have won five of six games against the Dodgers in 
the past 11 days. 
</P>
<P>
And for the only the second time in the last four years, they even managed to 
beat Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not seeing the real Fernando," Padre pitcher Ed Whitson said. "I 
remember when I was with the Pirates, he had just come up and won three or four 
straight games when we came to town. Dave Parker said, 'Hey, let's take care of 
this so-called phenom everybody's talking about.' 
</P>
<P>
"Well, he struck out three times and hit about a 19-hopper to the mound in his 
last at-bat. Parker comes back to the dugout and says, 'Hey, how can I hit him? 
The guy's a phenom.' " 
</P>
<P>
Though the score indicates otherwise, the Padres hardly ripped into Valenzuela 
on this night either, benefiting instead from the Dodgers' comedy of errors. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres scored only two earned runs, and one was on a wild pitch by 
Valenzuela. 
</P>
<P>
It was that kind of night. 
</P>
<P>
But with the way the Padres have been swinging of late, they're grateful just 
to reach base. 
</P>
<P>
Tying the game in the second inning on Valenzuela's wild pitch, the Padres put 
together an offensive bonanza in the fourth inning when they scored three runs 
on one single. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn led off the inning with a single to left field, and the biggest 
contribution by his teammates was suppressing their giggling the rest of the 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela did not allow a ball out of the infield during this vaunted Padre 
attack, but with the kind of support he was receiving behind him, no one would 
have blamed him if he had got up and left in the middle of the inning pleading, 
"No mas, no mas." 
</P>
<P>
He hardly was blameless in the Dodgers' defensive collapse as he suddenly had a 
fit of wildness. He walked Jack Clark after Gwynn's single, but when Chris 
James laid down a bunt right in front of the mound, Valenzuela wheeled and 
threw in time to get Gwynn at third. But third baseman Jeff Hamilton dropped 
the ball, and umpire Bruce Froemming had to change his call. 
</P>
<P>
With the bases loaded, Valenzuela got his only break of the inning when Garry 
Templeton grounded a 2-0 pitch to Hamilton, who threw to home for the force 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Then Valenzuela walked Benito Santiago on a full count when his screwball just 
missed to force in a run. 
</P>
<P>
Pitching coach Ron Perranoski went to the mound for a chat, and whatever he 
said seemed to work as Shawn Abner hit an apparent double-play ball to 
shortstop Alfredo Griffin. Griffin did everything right by flipping the ball to 
Mariano Duncan for the second out, but Duncan's throw to first baseman Eddie 
Murray skipped in the dirt. When Murray was unable to come up with the scoop, 
Abner reached first and James and Templeton scored for a 4-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
That was enough for Padre pitcher Dennis Rasmussen to win his first game in 40 
days and 40 nights. 
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen (3-4) had last won May 20 at Philadelphia, and his only other victory 
of the season occurred April 7 at Houston. But ever since donning a Padre 
uniform, there's something about this place that Rasmussen loves. He has a 3-0 
record in three starts as a Padre at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, however, the Padres managed to keep it interesting for those of the 
36,128 who remained in the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
After retiring Jose Gonzales in the ninth, Rasmussen surrendered back-to-back 
singles to John Shelby and Rick Dempsey. McKeon, not bothering to see if 
Rasmussen could pitch his first complete-game since Oct. 2, 1988, called upon 
Mark Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Davis induced pinch-hitter Dave Anderson into a groundout for the second out, 
which scored Shelby from third. Griffin then hit a topper to the right side of 
the mound that looked like trouble the moment it left his bat. Davis fielded 
the ball, threw hurriedly to first, and then winced as it sailed off Griffin's 
back down the right-field line. 
</P>
<P>
Dempsey scooted for third, and Griffin was off for second base. 
</P>
<P>
Big mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn, who alertly was backing up the play, threw out Griffin at second by 
three feet, and perhaps fittingly, the Dodgers' night was over on a mental 
blunder. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Padre Manager Jack McKeon, who has made trades involving 152 players, or 
roughly 24.4% of the 26 major-league rosters, seemingly would have had a tough 
time emotionally with his latest. Oh, swapping two long relief pitchers who are 
hanging on for dear life in the big leagues hardly is anyone's idea of a 
blockbuster, but McKeon's trade on Wednesday night had the whole family 
talking. Padre pitcher Greg Booker is the husband of McKeon's daughter, Kristi, 
and Wednesday night McKeon uprooted the family by trading Booker to the 
Minnesota Twins for pitcher Fred Toliver. Were those misty eyes hiding behind 
McKeon's glasses Wednesday when he told Booker of the trade? "Nah, it's just 
another trade," McKeon said. "Shoot, I'd trade my own son away if I knew it'd 
help the club." . . . Dodger outfielder Kirk Gibson and his family were robbed 
at gunpoint Wednesday night. The gunman took his BMW and several hundred 
dollars in cash. Gibson was in uniform but out of the starting lineup Thursday. 
Before the game, he refused to comment on the incident. . . . Padre right 
fielder Tony Gwynn now can say that he's heard it all. Gwynn said a reporter 
came into the clubhouse Wednesday and asked, 'If you were a tree, what kind of 
tree would you be?' Said Gwynn: "Can you believe it?" . . . Gwynn was filling 
out his All-Star ballot for a USA Today survey among players when he penciled 
in Mike Scott of Houston as the starting pitcher? Why not Giant pitcher Rick 
Reuschel, he was asked? "Well, I would have," he said, "except I don't know how 
to spell 'Reuschel.' " . . . Padre second baseman Roberto Alomar committed his 
18th error of the season in the second inning when he bobbled John Shelby's 
chopper, giving him two more errors than all of last season with 83 games still 
remaining.

JACKSON PLEDGES SUCCESS, ASKS FOR NBA FANS' PLEDGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN HEWITT, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mannie L. Jackson showed up Thursday at a press conference in the Sports Arena 
and talked articulately, impressively and forcefully about the National 
Basketball Assn. franchise he plans to bring to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Trouble was, the NBA was nowhere in sight. Neither was San Diego Mayor Maureen 
O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
None of which bothered Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
"At every step of my life somebody has told me something can't be done. I don't 
know where I'd be if I had listened to the first person who told me that," 
Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson is a black business executive from Minneapolis who is heading a group 
of unidentified investors who want to return the NBA to San Diego after a 
five-year absence. Jackson said he couldn't identify the investors just now. 
And, he said, he couldn't say when he will be able to identify those investors. 
</P>
<P>
But he asked for a show of support from the San Diego sports community in the 
form of $50 season-ticket pledges that will be refunded if he can't deliver an 
NBA team. The more pledges he gets, the more he figures the NBA will pay 
attention to his bid. 
</P>
<P>
"The NBA seems to have accepted that approach (season-ticket pledges) as a kind 
of barometer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Told of Jackson's pledge program, one NBA official, who asked not to be 
identified, said, "That's dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's plans call for the NBA team to play eventually in the downtown sports 
facility being planned by La Jolla multimillionaire Harry Cooper and his 
partner, Richard Esquinas. Jackson said the NBA has told him it has no plans to 
expand and he said it was more likely he and his backers will have to buy an 
existing NBA franchise and relocate it. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper's arena plans, announced last winter, met with resistance from the local 
political community -- a situation Jackson said he is aware of. "I have been in 
contact with Mayor O'Connor's office a lot and I have gone overboard to make 
sure Maureen has been close to what's happening. I expect in another two or 
three weeks we will spend some quality time together," he said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, Jackson said, sent him flowers upon his arrival in San Diego 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's welcoming committee at the press conference included former Harlem 
Globetrotter teammate Meadowlark Lemon, who delivered an invocation, former NFL 
tight end John Mackey, Cooper, Esquinas, former NBA and UCLA basketball star 
Bill Walton and a host of groupies who often applauded loudly when Jackson said 
things like: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Our goal is to get an NBA franchise for San Diego and we're not gonna ever 
let (NBA Commissioner) David Stern forget it." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "I have a sign on my desk that says: 'Be patient and keep the pressure on.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Two of the strongest financial institutions in America are behind us and 
will be identified at the appropriate time." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said he will submit a formal application next month for entry into the 
NBA. The application, he said, will be accompanied by a non-refundable $100,000 
application fee. The name of his corporation is San Diego NBA Franchise, Inc. 
But, he said, "That $100,000 will come from me. Right now I am San Diego NBA 
Franchise, Inc." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, 49, will be chairman and chief executive of the team. But, he said, he 
will retain his position as vice president and general manager of the 
Commercial Buildings Group of Honeywell, Inc. in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
The fans, he said, will determine the name of the team. And he said he 
eventually wants at least 25% of the ownership to be local. "I want to live in 
this city one day, too," he said. "And I'll be buying property soon to 
establish a residence here." 
</P>
<P>
If he succeeds in obtaining a franchise, Jackson would be the first black owner 
in the NBA. But he stopped short of committing himself to hiring either a black 
general manager or coach. "My values and ideals say that ours will be an 
organization of inclusion that happens to be black-owned," he said. "As far as 
how we operate and manage the club, it will be with the most competent people 
we can find." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson met with Stern last March and left with the impression that he had a 
10% chance of getting a team. He said he will leave San Diego Sunday and "if I 
don't feel it's about 50-50 at this stage, I'll reconnect and reconsider my 
options." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper and Esquinas, who now run the Sports Arena, already have negotiated a 
favorable lease with Jackson if he gets a team before Cooper's arena opens. 
Jackson also said he will actively seek the support of the San Diego Sports 
Assn. in promoting the team in the community. 
</P>
<P>
Then he ticked off statistics aimed at the NBA offices in New York. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego, he said, has the sixth largest population in the United States and 
is expected to grow by another 1 million by the year 2,010. He said San Diego's 
economy is growing faster than the rest of California's and the rest of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego, he said, is larger than half the markets that already have NBA teams 
and is growing faster than all but three NBA markets.

MCDOWELL PREFERS TO BE LEFT TO HIS OWN DEVICES IN ATTEMPT TO RETURN TO WHITE 
SOX

<P>
It was April Fools' Day, the final workout of spring training, but the mood was 
anything but jocular for three young Chicago White Sox pitchers awaiting word 
of their fate. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few positions were available on the White Sox staff and Jack McDowell, 
with slightly more than a full season of major league service, stood in the 
outfield coolly imparting a veteran's words of wisdom to the less-experienced 
trio of Donn Pall, Ken Patterson and Steve Rosenberg. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't worry if you're sent back to triple A," McDowell said as he trotted off 
to answer what he thought was an informal summons from Manager Jeff Torborg. 
"Stay fired up. You'll be back." 
</P>
<P>
Three months and a career's worth of frustration later, McDowell is in 
Sarasota, Fla., attempting to heed his own advice. 
</P>
<P>
After a disastrous 1 1/2-month stint at triple-A Vancouver in the Pacific Coast 
League, a three-week sabbatical at home in Van Nuys and a visit with orthopedic 
specialist Dr. Robert Kerlan, McDowell, 23, is on rehabilitative assignment 
with the White Sox's affiliate in the Gulf Coast Rookie League. 
</P>
<P>
Daily workouts on the mound and in the weight room at Ed Smith Complex are 
designed to help the 6-foot-5, 179-pound McDowell recapture the form that made 
him the fifth player selected in the 1987 draft after pitching Stanford to its 
first National Collegiate Athletic Assn. championship. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack is getting his delivery back to where it was when he signed," said Al 
Goldis, the White Sox director of scouting and player development. "He looks 
like he did when I saw him at Stanford." 
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, McDowell pitched competitively for the first time since May 16, 
allowing one run and no walks during a four inning, 70-pitch appearance against 
the Montreal Expos' Gulf Coast League affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt a little weird being out there in a game," McDowell said by phone from 
Sarasota. "But it was exactly what I needed." 
</P>
<P>
As McDowell gains arm strength, it is becoming increasingly clear that the most 
important thing he needs is to be left alone. 
</P>
<P>
While pitching at Notre Dame High, McDowell unknowingly developed mechanics 
that compensated for a chronic hip problem and allowed him to eventually become 
an All-American at Stanford. Those mechanics, however, gradually degenerated 
over the past two seasons as White Sox instructors tinkered with their 
hard-throwing protege. 
</P>
<P>
McDowell broke in with the White Sox in September, 1987, and finished the 
season 3-0 with a 1.93 earned-run average. At that time, the only thing it 
looked like he would require was plenty of room to store future postseason 
awards. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, McDowell made the major league club after spring training in 1988. 
He compiled a 5-10 record for the hapless Sox but had a respectable 3.97 ERA 
before suffering a groin injury that caused him to miss the final five weeks of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
This spring, he was 1-1 with a 4.03 ERA when he was demoted the day before the 
White Sox broke camp for their opener against the Angels at Anaheim Stadium. 
"It wasn't his fault, but the time away from competing at the major league 
level hurt Jack," said Larry Himes, general manager of the White Sox. "He came 
down to spring training this year not completely ready to compete because of 
the injury. We didn't see the pop in his fastball." 
</P>
<P>
McDowell, however, said that he was suffering from over-coaching -- something 
he had been warned about when he first came up to to the major leagues in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"The third day I was in Chicago (former White Sox pitcher) Floyd Bannister told 
me, 'Hey, everybody is going to want a piece of you,' " McDowell said. "They 
get a guy who's 22 and a hard thrower in the big leagues and they want you to 
be the best, but sometimes they can get a little carried away. It's a tough 
thing to sort out the advice you get from people that say, 'If you do this, you 
could be great.' 
</P>
<P>
"The last five workouts during spring training they had me doing something 
different each time. I was thinking mechanics so much, I became a mechanical 
pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his troubles, McDowell was confident he'd get the opportunity to work 
them out in the major leagues. Torborg and the White Sox brass thought 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a shock," McDowell said of his demotion, adding that he went through 
periods during which he would go back and forth between laughing and being 
angry. 
</P>
<P>
"Since it was April Fools' Day, I'd tell guys that I just got sent down and 
they said, 'Right!' 
</P>
<P>
"The equipment guy wouldn't even pack my gear because he thought I was joking." 
</P>
<P>
McDowell's experience in Vancouver did nothing to cheer him. His arm felt tired 
and he had no sense of rhythm. He compiled a 1-2 record and an 8.70 ERA in 
seven games. In 30 innings, he surrendered 44 hits and issued 13 walks but only 
struck out 12. 
</P>
<P>
Things bottomed out May 18 when McDowell bolted from a bullpen mound during a 
workout between starts. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, I walked off and said, 'This is a joke, I can't do anything. I need 
to talk to someone and see what the deal is,' " McDowell said. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to Van Nuys, studied old tapes of himself and worked out with his 
brother Jim. He also visited Kerlan, who diagnosed McDowell's injury as a 
slipped capital femoral epiphysis in the left hip. The condition causes a 
flattening of the top of the femur, preventing it from fitting and moving 
properly into the hip socket. 
</P>
<P>
"Not knowing his underlying problem, they (the White Sox) didn't think that the 
motion that he developed at Stanford was really what they wanted in the major 
leagues," Kerlan said. "They had him make changes, and, in so doing, it caused 
stress on his arm." 
</P>
<P>
Kerlan advised the White Sox to let McDowell return to his old style of 
throwing. So far, the results have been positive. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to Jack and said, 'I want to make sure this doesn't happen again,' " 
Himes said. "We want him to spend as much time as it takes to develop 
durability and arm strength." 
</P>
<P>
McDowell, however, has his own timetable. "I'd like to get back up to Chicago 
and catch the second half of the season," he said. "I'm looking forward to 
coming in and having a positive influence on the team. Right now, though, it 
just feels good to be getting back to normal."

KEEPING UP WITH JONES PROVING DIFFICULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Ortega 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Angela Burnham of Rio Mesa High concluded a stellar high school track career 
with victories in the 100 and 200 meters in the state championships at Cerritos 
College earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
But Valley-area track fans might not have to wait long for another superb local 
sprinter to emerge -- Marion Jones of Sherman Oaks will enter high school in 
the fall, although which school she will attend has not been decided. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, 13, has personal bests of 12.02 seconds in the 100, 24.30 in the 200, 
and 56.98 in the 400. And West Valley Eagles' Coach Roger Lipkis says that she 
hasn't come close to tapping her potential. 
</P>
<P>
"She's just starting to work on her start," Lipkis said of Jones, 5-foot-9, 130 
pounds. "She hadn't done any (starting) block work until a couple of weeks ago. 
She'll run much faster before the summer is over." 
</P>
<P>
That's saying something because Jones smashed Burnham's national age-13 record 
in the 200 (24.91) with a 24.30 clocking in the West Coast Classic at UC Irvine 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
She also won the 100 in 12.02 at Irvine, forcing Lipkis to re-evaluate his 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"Until last week, I'd say the 100 was her worst event," Lipkis said. "But now, 
I don't know. To me, her best event is a toss-up between the 200 and 400, but 
the 100 isn't far behind." 
</P>
<P>
Lipkis may change his opinion several times in the upcoming weeks. Jones will 
compete in all three events at The Athletics Congress Youth Athletic 
championships in Arlington, Tex., on July 6-8; the Track City International 
Classic in Eugene, Ore., on July 21-23; and the TAC Junior Olympic 
championships in Spokane, Wash., on July 28-30. 
</P>
<P>
Lipkis expects Jones to challenge age-group records in the 100, 200 and 400 
along the way. 
</P>
<P>
"She's capable of getting all three before the summer's over," Lipkis said. 
"She should definitely get the 400 record." 
</P>
<P>
Angela Rolfe, who won three consecutive state 400 titles for Dorsey High from 
1987-89, set the age-13 national record of 55.2 in 1985. The 100 record of 11.7 
(hand-timed) was also set that year, by Virginia Robertson of Missouri, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
"She has some of the strongest legs I've ever seen on a sprinter her age," 
Lipkis said. "She's going to be a great one in high school. Maybe the best 
ever." 
</P>
<P>
Missing in action: Burnham withdrew from last week's Pan American Junior 
Athletic championships in Santa Fe, Argentina, for several reasons, including 
the volatile political climate in the South American country and fatigue from a 
rigorous season that began in January. 
</P>
<P>
"Her parents weren't real keen on her running there because of the violence," 
Rio Mesa co-Coach Brian FitzGerald said. "Plus, she was just exhausted from the 
last couple of months of competing, traveling and graduating. . . . It was her 
decision. She just felt like she needed a rest." 
</P>
<P>
Burnham, Track and Field News' female high school Athlete of the Year in 1988, 
is expected to compete in international junior meets next month in New 
Brunswick, Canada, and at Brown University in Providence, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
However, FitzGerald isn't expecting much. 
</P>
<P>
"Her training hasn't been that consistent in the last few weeks for a variety 
of reasons," FitzGerald said. "Plus, she'll be doing more strength work in the 
next few weeks compared to sprint work." 
</P>
<P>
Add Burnham: The five-time state sprint champion was honored by Gatorade as its 
national female high school track and field athlete in a ceremony at the 
Sheraton Universal Hotel in Universal City on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham, who is bound for UCLA, successfully defended her 100 and 200 titles in 
this year's state championships. She was Gatorade's state female Athlete of the 
Year in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Arreola update: No decision has been made concerning Darcy Arreola's membership 
on the U. S. team for the World University Games in Duisburg, West Germany, 
Aug. 22-30. 
</P>
<P>
When Arreola placed seventh in the 1,500 in the TAC championships in Houston 
two weeks ago, she appeared to have been the second collegiate qualifier -- 
behind Suzy Favor of Wisconsin -- on the national team. 
</P>
<P>
But Alisa Harvey, who finished sixth, contends that she was the second 
qualifier, despite having completed her athletic eligibility at Tennessee in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Laverne Sweat of Norfolk State, the World University Games women's team 
manager, said that Harvey might be eligible for the team if she graduated from 
Tennessee in 1988, as she claims. 
</P>
<P>
"The rules state that you are eligible for the team if you graduate during the 
previous year, or are still attending school in graduate classes," Sweat said. 
"But we still haven't determined if that is the case with Alisa." 
</P>
<P>
Right idea, wrong time: It's billed as the "Four-Minute Mile Challenge." But 
the chances of the special high school race in the Jack in the Box Invitational 
living up to its name are slim and none. 
</P>
<P>
It's not because a talented field won't be assembled for the race, but rather 
the late date of the meet virtually assures that all of the runners will be 
past peak condition, both physically and mentally. 
</P>
<P>
The event is scheduled for Aug. 6 at UCLA and most of the invited runners took 
part in their respective state championships earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Francis O'Neill of Escondido San Pasqual, Coley Candaele of Carpinteria and 
Todd Lewis of Burbank, for instance, all posted personal bests in finishing 
1-2-3 in the 1,600 meters in the California state championships June 3. 
</P>
<P>
The fastest runner in the field is Chris Lewis of Mead High in Spokane, Wash., 
with a nation-leading 1,600 mark that converts to a mile time of 4 minutes, 6.1 
seconds.

AGOURA SPRINTER PLANS TO ATTEND UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jeff Ingalls of Agoura High, third-place finisher in the 400 in the state track 
and field championships at Cerritos College earlier this month, has made an 
oral commitment to attend UCLA in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Ingalls chose UCLA over Cal State Northridge and UC Riverside. The Bruins will 
provide him with a partial athletic scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't beat the school," Ingalls said. "UCLA has just always been one of my 
dream schools. I couldn't believe it when they started talking to me." 
</P>
<P>
Having run 11.2 seconds in the 100, 22.56 in the 200 and 49.61 in the 400 as a 
junior, Ingalls improved tremendously this year, clocking 10.9 in the 100, 
22.19 in the 200 and 47.89 in the 400, the event in which he won the Southern 
Section 1-A Division title.

PIERCE'S XANTHOS STEPPING DOWN BUT NOT ASIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Springer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Today, after 43 years in public education, after 14 league tennis titles in 18 
years at North Hollywood High, after 19 conference tennis titles in 25 years at 
Pierce College, Paul Xanthos, 68, finally begins retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Well, sort of. 
</P>
<P>
If you know Xanthos, there will be no rocking chair nor Leisure World condo for 
this man. 
</P>
<P>
His idea of retirement is to give up his teaching position at Pierce but to 
continue coaching the tennis team. 
</P>
<P>
And immediately plunge into a new tennis venture in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Xanthos is one of four investors in a proposed family sports center and tennis 
complex. The center, which still must be approved by the city, would take two 
to 2 1/2 years to construct at an estimated cost of $6 million to $8 million. 
Open to the public, the Burbank facility would include 15-20 tennis courts, six 
racquetball courts, two squash courts, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, 
volleyball courts, saunas, a gym complete with a running track, and areas for 
weight training, physical therapy and massage. 
</P>
<P>
Xanthos hopes to take an active role as sports director of the facility. 
</P>
<P>
That could require a lot of time. Good thing he's retired. 
</P>
<P>
Minor hurdle: Thirteen-year-old Christopher Minor of Northridge reached the 
third round of the Southern California sectionals in the 14-and-under singles 
division before being eliminated by Derek Pope, 6-3, 6-0, Tuesday at Los 
Caballeros Sports Village in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Minor is not unfamiliar with the third round. Just to qualify for the 
sectionals, a United States Tennis Assn.-sanctioned event under the auspices of 
the Southern California Tennis Assn., a player had to have reached at least the 
third round in six other USTA-sanctioned tournaments in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a month of major events for the Minor family. 
</P>
<P>
While Christopher was competing in Fountain Valley, his parents were victorious 
in Spalding Cup competition at Porter Valley Country Club in Northridge in a 
national doubles tournament for 4.0-rated players. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Minor teamed with Michael Jameson to defeat Hal Adelman and John Gaffney, 
6-4, 6-3, and advance to the area Spalding Cup tournament next month at San 
Clemente Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
Joining him there will be his wife Rita, who teamed with Karen Gaffney to beat 
Pat Luongo and Diane Altman 6-4, 6-4, in the ladies' competition. 
</P>
<P>
Junior event: The Cal State Pacific Coast Junior Championship, a major 
tournament for young men and women, will be held in three Northern California 
locations July 3-9. 
</P>
<P>
The competition for 17- and 18-year-olds will be staged at the Harbor Bay Club 
in Alameda. The Tiburon Peninsula Club will play host to the 15- and 
16-year-olds, and the 13- and 14-year-olds will play at the Ross Valley Swim 
and Tennis Club in Kentfield. 
</P>
<P>
Entries are based on performance. 
</P>
<P>
Information: 415-461-4383. 
</P>
<P>
All in the family: North Ranch Country Club in Thousand Oaks staged its area 
event last week for the Equitable Family Tennis Challenge. The main 
registration requirement in the doubles affair is that the partners be related. 
</P>
<P>
Winners in the father-son competition were George and Mike Bannister, and Gary 
and Todd Stephens finished second. 
</P>
<P>
Other winners, followed by the runners-up, were as follows: Father and daughter 
-- Gunter and Natasha Backes; Gary and Carrie Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Mother and son -- Adam and Donna Goodley; Amy and Derek Schinden. Mother and 
daughter -- Rita Robinson and Maureen Patton; Joan and Nicole House. Husband 
and wife -- Ken and Trudy Miya; Dick and Nancy May.

MAGAZINES: 'GARBAGE': WHOLE NEW PERSPECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone who browses the news racks knows they're often littered with garbage. 
Garbage magazine, however, will be the first publication to claim that title 
with pride. 
</P>
<P>
Arriving in August, Garbage will be, according to editor and publisher Patricia 
Poore, "the best of environmental magazines, the best of science magazines, 
with a practical, how-to slant and a sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
Or, as the slick, direct mail campaign now under way puts it: "To those who say 
it's beyond the individual to grasp our environmental problems -- let alone fix 
them -- we say 'Garbage!' " 
</P>
<P>
Poore, who publishes the successful Old-House Journal, is well aware that 
postal employees already stagger under the weight of dozens, if not hundreds, 
of environmental magazines. 
</P>
<P>
"This is totally different," she said. "It comes out of magazine publishing, 
rather than the environmental movement. The others, to a great extent, exist 
for a constituency that is giving money to a cause; the magazine becomes a 
mouthpiece for the group." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Focus on Practicality 
</P>
<P>
"Garbage, the Practical Journal for the Environment," on the other hand, will 
be free to explore environmental issues for every perspective, with the focus 
on practicality. 
</P>
<P>
Poole said she has notes charting the evolution of the magazine from concept to 
reality, going back 10 years. "It's terrible and wonderful that the headlines 
have kept up with it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
With a four-color cover and engaging graphics, Garbage ($21 for six issues, 
P.O. Box 56520, Boulder, Colo., 80321-6520) looks suspiciously slick in its 
advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
Poole swears it's printed on recycled paper. "It's not high gloss, but it's not 
whole wheat either -- you know how recycled paper tends to have little goobies 
in it?" she said. And the magazine is careful not to use certain inks with 
heavy metal toxicity. "We're doing the best we can." 
</P>
<P>
Her own involvement in environmental issues has largely been limited to joining 
the Sierra Club and "sending money to lots of organizations," but she knows 
she's an environmentalist because "I feel guilty a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Garbage, she said, will show people like herself how to confront the 
environmental dilemma in a reasonable manner. The premier issue, for instance, 
will include articles on redesigning a kitchen to accommodate recycling, and a 
piece on composting a small garden. 
</P>
<P>
It also will feature more far-reaching features on environmental issues, but 
"without the jargon," Poole said. For example, the magazine will approach the 
stupefyingly complex issue of Chloroflurocarbons and atmospheric chemistry from 
the perspective, "What does a Big Mac box have to do with ozone?" 
</P>
<P>
There will be regular departments with a lighter touch. "Disposable decades" 
will look "at how we got into this mess. Magazines from the '30s and '40s and 
'50s were amazingly blatant in their ads pushing convenience and disposability. 
We poke fun at ourselves for having bought that hook, line and sinker," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Another regular feature -- "Into the Dumpster" -- "will deal with newly 
introduced products we hope will have a short shelf life -- things we'd like to 
dump," Poole said. The first item will be an excessively packaged microwave 
oven. "I'd rather not name the company," Poole said. "I want to get sued after 
it runs, not before." 
</P>
<P>
The Right Thing? 
</P>
<P>
Director and screenwriter Spike Lee's film "Do the Right Thing" opens this 
weekend amid a heat wave of controversy. Essence magazine decided to go to the 
source of the heat. The editors picked the one person who might have some 
insight into the unique director's brain: Shelton Jackson (Spike) Lee himself. 
</P>
<P>
The short interview in the July issue has "Shelton" asking "Spike" about the 
film that some predict will stir racial tensions this summer. In one exchange, 
Shelton asks, "I see there are some white people in there. . . . How was it 
working with white actors?" 
</P>
<P>
Spike: That's a stupid question. 
</P>
<P>
Shelton: I know that. 
</P>
<P>
Spike: No different from working with black actors. 
</P>
<P>
Shelton: Good. Glad we got that out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Lee later explains that "Do the Right Thing" is "about racism, about our own 
individual prejudices, which I feel are hurtling us as a nation into a 
descending spiral of hate." 
</P>
<P>
The interview concludes with Spike's prediction: "It's going to be a long, hot 
summer." 
</P>
<P>
Puppets in the Media 
</P>
<P>
Press bashing was in vogue in America long before the Reagan Revolution. The 
usual charge is that the massively powerful media, prodded by the arrogant 
liberals who control them and without a mandate from any electorate, are 
rendering America's leaders impotent. 
</P>
<P>
The July Harper's magazine, however, presents an overview of press bashing from 
an opposite perspective -- that of the press itself. 
</P>
<P>
Titled "All the Congressmen's Men," the essay by contributing editor Walter 
Karp surveys a dozen insider-type books on the subject, including Ben 
Bagdikian's "The Media Monopoly," and Mark Hertsgaard's "On Bended Knee." It 
concludes that the government spoon-feeds "news" to the American media, which 
they dutifully regurgitate for their eternally naive viewers and readers. 
</P>
<P>
"Reporters are puppets," Lyndon Johnson said. "They simply respond to the pull 
of the most powerful strings." Karp lists example after example to support that 
view, from the press' alleged misreading of Congress' Iran-Contra report to 
CBS' alleged capitulation to pressure from Nixon's henchmen during Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a bitter irony of source journalism that the most esteemed journalists 
are precisely the most servile. For it is by making themselves useful to the 
powerful that they gain access to the 'best' sources," Karp argues. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in Harper's, readers are allowed a glimpse of a piece of 
correspondence that hindsight renders particularly ugly. Written in 1985, the 
letter is a complaint to an Exxon executive from a former navigation officer. 
The subject is Capt. Joseph J. Hazelwood, the man who was supposed to be at the 
helm of the Valdez when it wrecked off the shore of Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, turned over to Harper's by the letter writer's attorney, charges 
among other things that Hazelwood falsified ship records and routinely abused 
alcohol between 1980 and 1982.

The word is already out that Hugh Hefner won't be wearing silk pajamas for his 
wedding Saturday to Playmate of the Year Kimberley Conrad. But he might wear 
silk boxer shorts under his tuxedo. Sherman Oaks haberdasher Rick Pallack, who 
prepared the bridegroom's formal wedding attire, tells us he hasn't heard 
officially, but he did give Hef a pair of black-and-white, paisley-patterned 
boxers "so he would have on some silk." The king of playboys will call an end 
to his bachelor days -- for the second time -- in a '40s-style black-wool, 
single-breasted tuxedo jacket trimmed with satin lapels, satin vest, white 
pleat-front shirt, black bow tie, satin-trimmed trousers and black patent 
leather shoes. Not bad for a man who has been known to do television interviews 
in his robe and pajamas. "He doesn't even own a tie," Pallack tells us, adding: 
"He looks very handsome in clothes. He should wear them more often."

Dealt a Full House 
</P>
<P>
A bash for Sandra Bernhard saw its share of celebrities as well as legal 
authorities. It was to celebrate Bernhard's new album, and it rapidly taxed the 
capacity of Eastside hot spot Enter the Dragon. Around 8:30 p.m. the fire 
marshal began turning away arriving guests, sending such notables as novelist 
Mark Lindquist ("Sad Movies") out into the street. Listen noticed that 
Lindquist has ditched his perennial suit-and-tie look for an ever-present blue 
blazer. The divine Miss Bernhard waited around for gal pal Madonna until the 
marshal finally shut the whole soiree down. Madonna had RSVP'd but the party 
gave up the ghost long before the Material Girl was scheduled to arrive. And we 
heard that Prince avoided the crowds by staying in his limo.

What's a $46 Batman watch doing in a place like Arlene Altman in the Rodeo 
Collection? Co-owner Carol Chase tells us the store, normally filled with 
Altman's expensive jewelry designs and pricey vintage timepieces, has a 
"Beverly Hills exclusive" on the watches and was the first shop in the nation 
to receive them. That seems only right, considering the manufacturers, DC 
Comics Inc., studied Chase's '50s Batman watch before proceeding with their 
limited-edition collection. The pieces went on sale two weeks ago, and the 
first customer was Linda Guber, who bought one for husband Peter and one for 
Jon Peters, producers of the "Batman" film, which opened last Friday.

The rumor mill's been churning out stories about how Giorgio Armani joined the 
Italian fashion revolt, and will show his next collection in Paris, not Italy. 
(Romeo Gigli made the switch last fall, Gianfranco Ferre will do so this summer 
with his first couture collection for Christian Dior, though he'll still show 
his own ready-to-wear line in Milan.) "That's all wrong," insists Armani v.p. 
Gabriella Forte, about tales of the designer's defection. The mix-up occurred, 
she believes, because Armani will in fact show his fall '89 collection in Paris 
next September at the Musee Rodin, as part of a gala social bash. But, she 
says, he'll show his newer spring '90 collection in Milan next October. It's 
all just a tempest in a tortellini to actor Michael Keaton, who bought himself 
a new tux at Armani's Rodeo Drive boutique in time for the "Batman" premiere. 
We hear from the folks at the shop that Keaton also wears several Armani suits 
in the movie, when he's playing Bruce Wayne, not Batman.

Scott's Silk Substitute 
</P>
<P>
Melody Thomas Scott of "The Young and the Restless" made a last-minute costume 
change for the daytime Emmy awards show Thursday. She was planning to wear a 
black chiffon gown, but "on a fluke" found an outfit at Ron Ross of Tarzana. 
"My husband and producer flipped when they saw it," Scott says. "I have my 
orders and that's it." The new outfit is black silk pants and jacket with a 
black-and-gold sequined bustier. About the original outfit, Scott says: "I love 
that dress and eventually I will wear it to the Emmys." As for her co-star and 
co-presenter, Eric Braeden, well, "I just keep telling him, 'wear a tuxedo, 
dear,' " she says.

As if Giorgio Beverly Hills and former owner Fred Hayman didn't have enough 
confusion over their split, now comes word that Giorgio has picked a spot for a 
new gift and fragrance store to open in early fall. But get a whiff of this. 
The address is 327 N. Rodeo Drive, not to be confused with the old Giorgio 
boutique location at 273 N. Rodeo Drive, now the home of Fred Hayman Beverly 
Hills. Following in his own fragrance footsteps, Hayman is marketing a 273 
women's scent and plans next January to offer 273 Cologne for Men. Meanwhile, 
Giorgio plans in the future to offer a full range of clothing at a second 
store. Michael Gould, chief executive of Giorgio, a unit of Avon Products, 
sniffs at the idea that the address similarity will cause confusion. But a 
Giorgio spokeswoman told Listen with a chuckle: "Somebody has already asked me 
if we're going to come out with a 327 fragrance."

Teddy Bear Wear

Roger Daltrey of the Who is wearing a Marithe &amp; Francois Girbaud wardrobe 
for his current role in "The Teddy Bear Habit," shooting in New York. Girbaud's 
Joni Fiore says they've roughed up the striped shirt, band jacket and jeans 
from the new fall collection so Daltrey will look appropriately like the aging 
hippie he plays. The film, directed by John Small and written and produced by 
Rosemary and Kevin Breslin (children of columnist Jimmy Breslin, who has a 
small role in the film) is set for an April, 1990, release.

Designing Woman

Track star Florence Griffith Joyner, known for her flamboyant running outfits 
as well as her Olympic medals, has a new assignment. She's redesigning the 
uniform of the Indiana Pacers. She was commissioned by the team to create a new 
uniform that will be used beginning in the 1990-1991 season. She'll submit 13 
or 14 designs, and team officials will select the winner and unveil the new 
wardrobe in about three weeks. When she visited the team offices Thursday, she 
was wearing a golden jacket and matching skirt with a white top, while proudly 
displaying two-inch fingernails (one of them studded with rhinestones). Asked 
about the new NBA uniform, she joked: "It may look funny, but a basketball team 
in pink lace won't be too bad."

A Farm Under a Lake by Martha Bergland (Graywolf: $16; 208 pages) 
</P>
<P>
This is a book for a Midwestern summer afternoon; just long enough to be read 
on the porch glider during the hours between lunch and the flickering of the 
first fireflies. Ideally, there would be green fields stretching into the 
distance and thunderheads gathering on the horizon. Though "A Farm Under a 
Lake" is a thoroughly contemporary novel focusing upon the 40-year-old 
narrator's search for her lost self, the book is also a celebration of an all 
but vanished America; a part of the country often bypassed in current 
literature. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Hawn is a trained nurse, married to a businessman who always intended to 
be a farmer. When she leaves her husband at the breakfast table, morosely 
studying the want ads in the Green Bay, Wis., paper, she's about to set upon a 
dual errand. The visible part is to drive her current patient, an elderly 
stroke victim named May, to her daughter's house in Illinois. The covert reason 
for the trip is a personal search along the road not taken. Janet's marriage is 
disintegrating, and her vigorous young husband has turned into an embittered 
stranger who "only reminded me of the man I had married." Her hand hesitating 
on the car door, she remembers her mother saying, "All you have to do is put 
your foot in the road," the plain phrase reminding her not only how easy change 
is, but how final. 
</P>
<P>
Once May Nickelson is dressed, packed, and settled into the car, Janet is 
relatively free to let her mind take her back to the years before she married 
Jack Hawn. She's driving south, in the direction of her own history, and May 
has not spoken since her illness. With no distractions beyond the simple 
physical necessities, Janet is able to relive her life virtually from girlhood. 
Mile by mile, she comes closer to the secure years on her own homestead, then 
confronts the unsettled period after her mother's death when the farm was sold 
and her father moved into a hotel in town. 
</P>
<P>
As the geographical and emotional distances between "then" and "now" shrink, 
Janet is finally forced to see herself as the rebel she was the summer she fell 
in love with Jack Hawn's brother, Carl. Although she was virtually engaged to 
Jack, he was away finishing his own studies while Janet was in her family 
farmhouse, now owned by the Hawns. Carl is a few hundred yards away; married 
and a father, but proximity and loneliness are a highly volatile mixture. 
</P>
<P>
The strange summer draws to a close; Carl's absent wife returns, and Janet 
marries Jack, exactly as she always intended to do. The brothers had planned to 
share the newly expanded family farm, but a short-lived experiment proves 
conclusively that the idea is unrealistic. Better educated and more 
sophisticated, Jack leaves the land to become a salesman, starting each new job 
with enthusiasm that inevitably turns to indifference. Though there are dozens 
of jobs in many cities, each time the disillusion comes faster, the spaces 
between opportunities grow longer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drifting Away From Dreams 
</P>
<P>
Once Janet completes her nurses' training, weathering these dry spells becomes 
financially easier but psychologically more trying. This, after all, is the 
heartland in the mid-'70s, not yet a world in which dual-career couples 
routinely meet after work at this week's new cafe. With each passing year, 
Janet and Jack Hawn drift further away from their hopes and dreams. Now, 
childless and living in a cramped condo in Green Bay, their roles reversed and 
their connection with the land broken, they're no longer necessary to each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
The story of Janet's mute patient, May Nickelson, surfaces only after the women 
arrive at their destination and are welcomed by May's middle-aged daughter, a 
woman whose conventional facade conceals a surprisingly uninhibited spirit. 
Though at first the sub-plot seems tangential, May's life subtly illuminates 
Janet's private quest. Told in direct and graceful prose, "A Farm Under a Lake" 
is a quiet, unpretentious success.

RADIO STATION KCBQ SOLD FOR $23.5 MILLION

<P>
Eric Chandler Communications has sold KCBQ AM and FM, better known as Eagle 
105, to rapidly growing Adams Communications for $23.5 million, it was 
announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler Communications purchased KCBQ for $12.2 million in 1986, and promptly 
switched the format from country to the oldies rock 'n' roll of Eagle 105. The 
format is simulcast on FM (105.3) and AM (1170). 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to keep the format as is," said Matt Mills, president of Adams' 
radio division. 
</P>
<P>
Adams-owned KOOL AM and FM in Phoenix feature oldies rock formats. 
</P>
<P>
"Phoenix has worked out very well for us," Mills said. "We're just real high on 
the San Diego market. San Diego is a growth market and we're specializing in 
Top 30 markets when possible." 
</P>
<P>
Mills said he did not expect to make any staff changes at the station. Jim 
Seemiller, Adams vice president of the Western region, will oversee KCBQ from 
his Phoenix office, Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1983 by Stephen Adams, Adams Communications is a national multimedia 
company with interests in outdoor advertising, publishing, television and 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
The radio division, based in Clearwater, Fla., owns 10 radio stations -- six FM 
and four AM -- in Phoenix, Seattle, St. Louis, San Antonio and other mid-sized 
markets. Adams owns nine television stations, primarily in smaller markets. 
</P>
<P>
The $23.5-million price is high for San Diego, but not unheard of, considering 
the current market for radio stations. Prices have skyrocketed in recent years, 
because of federal deregulation and a host of young companies like Adams 
bidding for stations. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel we're paying a good premium to get into the market, but that's what 
you have to do to get into a good area," Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
Radio stations changing owners is "something that goes on in radio," Eagle 105 
General Manager Jeff Apregan said. "Radio stations have become a good 
investment." 
</P>
<P>
KCBQ was the Los Angeles-based Chandler's only radio interest.

FOUNDATION SEEKS MINOR CHANGES IN MUCH-CRITICIZED ARTS PARK MODEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cultural Foundation said it was making a bold statement when it selected an 
avant-garde architectural model for the theater that would highlight an arts 
complex the group hopes to build in Sepulveda Basin. 
</P>
<P>
But after taking strong criticism for the recently unveiled model, the 
foundation has decided to speak a little more softly. 
</P>
<P>
Arts Park L.A.'s proposed theater is designed to jut above ground in what 
appears to be an industrial splay of grids, fins, elevated walkways and 
"thrusting circulation bars." The Sierra Club, among others, has complained 
that the design is inappropriate for the basin's natural surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, foundation officials asked Morphosis -- the Santa Monica 
firm that designed the theater -- to alter the intricate, monochromatic model 
so that the public can more easily understand it. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the foundation said it wanted Morphosis to add artificial grass 
and miniature trees to give the model a more natural look. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get something as sophisticated, design-wise, as the Morphosis model, 
it's hard for people to visualize it," said Linda Kinnee, executive director of 
the Cultural Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
But when the model was returned to the foundation's ARTSPACE Gallery in 
Woodland Hills, where it is being displayed, the alterations were slight. 
Morphosis merely painted in a darker shade of brown the portions of the model 
that are supposed to depict ground level. 
</P>
<P>
"The model wasn't produced for purposes of promoting Arts Park," said Thom 
Mayne, one of the partners who run Morphosis. He said of the model, which was 
selected after a lengthy design contest, "It was produced for the purposes of a 
competition." 
</P>
<P>
Kinnee said she expected Morphosis to soon add artificial grass and trees to 
the model, but Mayne said he did not intend to do that. The architect said the 
theater's landscaping will be designed after the project proceeds toward 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
Arts Park, as it is envisioned, would include the theater, a wing-like museum, 
an open-air amphitheater, an art center and clusters of colorful workshops set 
among rolling hills. The foundation, a private, nonprofit group, has yet to 
acquire funding for the 60-acre, $50-million project. Neither has Arts Park 
received official approval from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which 
controls the basin, or the City of Los Angeles, which leases the land.

It was Marilyn's witchy gift to become whatever a particular camera wanted her 
to become. -- novelist Michael Ventura on Marilyn Monroe 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it was the witchy gift, perhaps it was the '50s-era publicity machine 
that demanded thousands of photos of its stars, but the supply of 
"never-before-released" pictures of Marilyn Monroe never seems to end. 
</P>
<P>
"Marilyn got around -- and I don't mean that facetiously," said photographer 
Bill Kobrin from a telephone booth near his home in Camarillo. "I don't think a 
photographer ever walked away from Marilyn empty-handed." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, Kobrin hasn't gone empty-handed. On Wednesday, the Eye of the 
Pelican Gallery (2148 Winifred, Simi Valley; (805) 584-8394) opened a display 
of 10 still photos taken by Kobrin when he was hired by Twentieth Century Fox 
to document the shooting of the infamous skirt-blowing scene in the "The Seven 
Year Itch." 
</P>
<P>
The photos, many never used by the studio because they were too revealing ("It 
looks like the wind machine got carried away," said gallery owner Nancy 
Shapiro), were returned to Kobrin shortly after the film's 1955 release. 
</P>
<P>
But it took more than 30 years for Kobrin to try selling the shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the longer she grows as a cult figure, the more they'd be worth," 
Kobrin said. "Really, Nancy Shapiro was the heat conduit. I wasn't looking for 
a slick high-priced gallery. What could a Joe Blow hot gallery do different? 
The pictures still have to stand on their own merits." 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro grouped Kobrin's stills into sets of 10 and says that before she could 
get the show mounted, six sets sold for $10,000 apiece. A limited edition of 
100 sets of 10 photos has been printed. 
</P>
<P>
Kobrin began his career as a messenger for Associated Press and made his first 
marks in the photo world with shots of the Harlem riots -- his first 
professional assignment -- and his coverage of the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
These days he keeps busy with his company Kobrin, Inc., a photographic 
consultancy for television production companies . . . and he spends a lot of 
time talking to curious Marilyn fans about the "The Seven Year Itch." 
</P>
<P>
The scene was shot in the middle of the night, from just after midnight until 
five in the morning when the sun started to rise. 
</P>
<P>
"There were other photographers there -- bystanders who'd come out to watch," 
Kobrin said. "They weren't allowed to shoot during filming but during 
rehearsals I saw plenty of flashes go off." 
</P>
<P>
Those flashes could signify still more Marilyn shots that have yet to be seen. 
This doesn't bother Kobrin in the least: "The more the merrier." LAURIE OCHOA

AT THE GALLERIES / LEAH OLLMAN: INDIAN WORKS SUCCUMB TO THE TRITE, OBVIOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Leah Ollman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tradition weighs heavy on the minds of Native American artists, but no more so 
than on the minds of the curators and public when viewing their work. 
</P>
<P>
Two current exhibitions encourage us to see contemporary Indian art in terms of 
its cultural heritage. "Traditions -- Old and New" at the Faith Nightingale 
Gallery (535 4th Ave.) and "Paths Beyond Tradition" at the Museum of Man in 
Balboa Park claim a continuity between contemporary Indian art and the rich 
Native American traditions of weaving, pottery, jewelry making and other arts. 
</P>
<P>
Artists in both shows incorporate traditional motifs from nature and ceremonial 
life in their work, and most in the Faith Nightingale show also remain faithful 
to the traditional materials of clay and fiber, feathers and stone. 
</P>
<P>
Few of the artists in either show, however, manage to transcend the art of 
their ancestors, or even to match its solidity and integrity. Instead, most are 
ensnared by the very traditions they claim as their inspiration. Mimicry, 
exploitation and a diluted sense of spirituality are all that link most of the 
contemporary artists represented here with their forebears. 
</P>
<P>
More than 30 artists are included in "Traditions -- Old and New." Mike and 
Jackie Torivio's spectacular "Yucca Vase," in the Acoma tradition of precise 
geometric patterning, and Lucy Yearflower Tafoya's miniature black pots in the 
Santa Clara style of relief decoration demonstrate the vitality of traditional 
forms when subtly and gracefully extended into the present. 
</P>
<P>
Pahponee's "All My Relations" trilogy of pots merges ancient pictographic 
emblems of buffalo, birds, snakes and sun with a more contemporary mottled, 
smoky clay surface. Conrad House's "Two Mountain Lions," austere glass forms 
with edges encrusted with sand and midsections wrapped with feathers and 
stones, exude a convincing presence as modern-day fetishes. 
</P>
<P>
Such potent understatement is rare here, however. Much more common are blatant, 
garish expressions, such as Don Clark's drawings, which strive for a spiritual, 
mystical aura but instead wallow in the cheap theatrics of science-fiction 
illustration. George Walbye debases the traditional ceramic wedding vase form 
(two spouts emerging from a single vessel) by adding a portrait of an Indian 
bride and groom at the end of each spout. The elegant and symbolic thus succumb 
to the trite and obvious. 
</P>
<P>
Romanticized, sentimental visions prevail here, as does the stereotype of the 
Indian as a brave, proud and tragic -- not to mention generic -- character. In 
the end, the slick, predictable work insults the very tradition it means to 
honor. 
</P>
<P>
The Museum of Man exhibition also sags under the burden of abused cliches. 
William Franklin imposes gratuitous decorative schemes upon traditional 
geometric patterns and kachina motifs, bending and stretching the forms until 
they whirl dizzily across his canvases. Virginia Stroud paints idealized scenes 
of traditional Indian life using an artificially sweet spectrum of colors, with 
each rosy-cheeked squaw a cookie-cutter image of the one beside her. 
</P>
<P>
Neither of these artists leaves much to the imagination. The melodramatic 
bronzes of Michael Naranjo and the stiff stone sculpture of Clifford Fragua 
suffer as well from their makers' formulaic and overly stylized approach. 
</P>
<P>
Only Michelle Tsosie Naranjo's delicate watercolors possess a mystery and magic 
that doesn't reek of forced spirituality. Her curious, abstracted mask forms 
float ambiguously on sheets of handmade rice paper, textured and saturated with 
deep blue and magenta pigments. 
</P>
<P>
In "Dancing for the Rain Gods," an attenuated human figure at the bottom of the 
thin, vertical sheet lifts one leg and arm in homage to the hovering masks 
above. Though not profoundly affecting, Naranjo's abstracted impressions 
nevertheless have a power entirely absent from the other artists' tight 
transcriptions of physical reality. 
</P>
<P>
Such familiar Indian symbols as the snake, hand and buffalo appear ad infinitum 
in the paintings and assemblages of Richard Glazer-Danay, but least of all to 
evoke a mystical or spiritual aura. The artist, familiar to local audiences 
through his inclusion in the San Diego Museum of Art's "Cultural Currents" 
exhibition last year, delights in a dense surface decoration that rarely, if 
ever, coheres into intelligible meaning. 
</P>
<P>
By coating the rotund wooden figures of "Fry Bread Fred and Fry Bread Freda" 
with vibrant renderings of ice cream sundaes, cherry pies and Coca-Cola, 
Glazer-Danay pokes fun at the unhealthy diet that plagues many reservation 
Indians, but he shies away from any deeper sociological or economic statement. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not searching for truth and beauty," his wall text reads. "I'm just having 
a good time." 
</P>
<P>
The sheer exuberance of his painted surfaces grants the audience a good time, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Freeman's paintings also elicit smiles, but, even more than 
Glazer-Danay's work, they reduce complex, urgent subjects to simplistic 
one-liners. Freeman (who is also represented in the Faith Nightingale Gallery 
show) visualizes the clash between modern and traditional Indian ways of life. 
Beads and cigarettes, feathers and high heels, tepees and television sets all 
confront each other in his tableaux. Painted in tired, Southwestern decorator 
colors, Freeman's work merely glosses over a theme that deserves deeper 
penetration. 
</P>
<P>
Where are the Native American artists who engage their own history, who address 
issues affecting Indian life today, and who examine the survival or abandonment 
of traditional values? "Traditions -- Old and New" and "Paths Beyond Tradition" 
implicitly ask these questions, but neither show provides a satisfying answer. 
</P>
<P>
"Traditions -- Old and New" continues through July 29. "Paths Beyond 
Tradition," which also includes work by David Dawangyumptewa, Edna Davis 
Jackson and Karen Lynn Noble, can be seen through Sept. 4.

Jennifer Weir has her wedding ring back -- three months after it vanished down 
a toilet at her home in Union City. Weir, 25, called the Union Sanitary 
District after she lost the diamond ring during the Easter holiday and a crew 
came out and probed the sewer line. "It wasn't in any of the stuff that came 
out," Weir said. Crew chief Manuel Terra told her it might take a few months 
for the ring to be washed from the house plumbing into the 8-inch line in the 
street. Earlier this week, she called Terra, who came out again. The crew sent 
a water-powered cleaning ball through the line from one manhole to the next. "I 
was losing hope," Weir said. All of a sudden, Weir said, "the guy in the 
manhole was yelling, 'You struck gold!"' "It was just luck," Terra said.

The judge in the Oliver L. North case put off until today a decision on whether 
a juror's possible misconduct affected the Iran-Contra trial, court officials 
said. North prosecutors said the juror gave inaccurate information to the court 
due to "inattentiveness, forgetfulness or lack of comprehension" but that there 
is no evidence she lied. The assertions were in a seven-page court filing a day 
after juror Tara Leigh King testified that she had forgotten that one of her 
brothers had served a year in prison for armed robbery. North's lawyers say his 
trial was tainted by King's presence on the jury. The former White House aide 
was convicted May 4 on three felony charges arising from the Iran-Contra 
scandal.

MIG CRASH BLAMED ON BIRD

A Soviet MIG-29 jet fighter that crashed in flames at the Paris Air Show went 
down because a small bird was sucked into its engine, a commission has 
concluded. Specialists found feathers sticking to the wrecked engine's blades, 
the newspaper Socialist Industry said, quoting the head of the French-Soviet 
panel's Soviet contingent, Donat Ogorodnikov. The commission's findings 
absolved the organizers of the June air show of all blame, the newspaper said.

JOB ACT CHANGES PROPOSED TO AID YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Labor Secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole proposed changes in the nation's main 
jobs program for the poor that she said would direct aid and training to those 
most at risk of failure in the employment market. "Those without basic skills 
are on a one-way street to a dead-end future," Dole said in announcing a 
package of proposed amendments to the Job Training Partnership Act. At the 
heart of her proposal is a Youth Opportunities Unlimited program, which would 
offer "challenge grants" to communities with large numbers of economically 
disadvantaged youths and young adults. "We must break the cycle of cynicism 
that has hold of many of our youth," Dole told the House Education and Labor 
Committee. "There is an urgent need for more than job training. Many 
desperately need basic skills training, literacy and remedial education."

Shells slammed into a hospital in Muslim West Beirut, killing one person and 
wounding at least 15, and snipers shot at firefighters as they battled to 
control the resulting blaze. According to eyewitnesses, the shells hit the 
first and sixth floors of the hospital, the second largest in West Beirut. "One 
person was killed when the operating room was set ablaze after it received a 
direct hit," a witness said. Fifteen people, including passers-by, patients and 
personnel, were wounded. The building is near the Green Line battlefront 
dividing the Lebanese capital into Christian and Muslim sectors.

Navy investigators probing the turret explosion aboard the battleship Iowa have 
apologized to a seaman for a news release that falsely implicated him in the 
disaster that killed 47 seamen, an attorney said. Gunner's Mate 3rd Class 
Kendall L. Truitt, 21, received the apology Wednesday from two Naval 
Investigative Service agents for a news leak that suggested Truitt was linked 
to the April 19 explosion, said Miami attorney Ellis Rubin. In a related 
development, ABC News reported that the NIS admitted that much of the 
information it leaked to reporters was false. Navy officials said they could 
not comment on the ABC report. "We now demand that the Navy officially clear 
Mr. Truitt and tell the public that he is not a homosexual nor was he involved 
in any murder-suicide pact that resulted in the explosion," Rubin said.

Five black girls who failed to make the Palm Springs High School varsity 
cheerleading squad have sued the school, its principal and the Palm Springs 
Unified School District, alleging that they were passed over because of their 
race. The federal court suit charges that "racism is common" on the campus and 
that scoring during tryouts for 16 spots was tailored to favor white students. 
Represented by attorney Gloria Allred, the girls -- Aneka Knight, Carla 
Johnston, Elizabeth Williams, Tisha Pollard and Joy Brown -- ask the court to 
direct the district to cease its allegedly discriminatory practices and allow 
them to join the team in time for training camp in August. District officials 
would not comment on the suit but said a Board of Education investigation found 
no evidence of discrimination.

<P>
SPECIAL STUDENTS IN SAN PEDRO AWARDED HIGH-GRADE HUGS 
</P>

Walking the 10 yards from his seat to the podium, where he was about to address 
his fellow graduating students at Ernest P. Willenberg Special Education Center 
in San Pedro, James Holderbaum stopped to gaze at the crowd and then became 
unsure of which direction to go. 
</P>
<P>
After a little prompting from his teachers, the 22-year-old arrived at the 
microphone. Speaking slowly and deliberately, he read from his prepared speech: 
</P>
<P>
"I have been a stu-dent here for el-ev-en years and I have learned to read, and 
learned to write, and cook, and . . . and . . . and sew. I will miss you all. 
All my friends," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The applause from the students, their parents and the Willenberg staff, 
including cafeteria workers and janitors, was so loud and long that Holderbaum 
smiled broadly and hugged a nearby teacher, sparking another round of hearty 
applause. When the cheering finally stopped, several people were in tears. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Positive Environment 
</P>
<P>
"That's what (Willenberg) is all about," Principal Beverly LoPorto said. "It is 
not a place where we feel sorry for our students and treat them as someone to 
be pitied. It's about giving them the right to feel good about themselves, 
putting them in a positive environment, and rewarding them when they reach, or 
even attempt, a goal. That's what we all deserve." 
</P>
<P>
Willenberg, and the 17 other schools like it in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, serve mentally and physically handicapped students age 3 to 22 who 
are unable to keep up with special education programs in mainstream schools. 
One other special education school is in the South Bay: C. Morley Cellery in 
Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
"The type of students at Willenberg are typical of the kind of students at any 
of the district's special education centers," said Phillip Callison, assistant 
superintendent for special education, "and the (faculty) at Willenberg is a 
fair example of all of our faculty in the centers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Foster Homes 
</P>
<P>
A third of Willenberg's 387 students were put in foster homes at an early age 
because their parents couldn't deal with what LoPorto calls their "challenges." 
</P>
<P>
The slightest signs of progress from students can take years. It took one 
teen-aged student a year to learn how to dress himself and another five years 
to use a cup and spoon. The best and brightest here can barely read or write. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess most of the teachers here do have a special talent for patience and 
looking at the bright side of things," saids physical education teacher Wayne 
Oberparleiter. "I've just gotten used to telling students something over and 
over and over." 
</P>
<P>
Oberparleiter and his assistant, Paula Hardy, just spent six months teaching a 
student how to dry himself. "We literally showed him how to use a towel five 
days a week for six months. He would smile and say yes, he understood, and then 
we would give him the towel, and he would just hand it right back to us. 
</P>
<P>
"And that day when he finally took that towel. Wow! I felt like it was the 
greatest achievement he ever made. And you know, it just could be," 
Oberparleiter said. "I think every teacher or teaching assistant here can tell 
you a story like that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coping With Death 
</P>
<P>
And many can tell of watching a frail student deteriorate slowly into death. 
Three students died during the school year that ended last week. 
</P>
<P>
LoPorto said the death of a student is taken very hard by staff members. 
</P>
<P>
"We cry, and we mourn with our students," she said, "but we continue with our 
jobs. A big part of our jobs is creating a positive and joyous atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Like all of the special education centers, Willenberg is three schools in one. 
One is for students of elementary school age; another for those of high school 
age and older, up to 22. The third, called the Developmentally Handicapped Unit 
at Willenberg, is reserved for the profoundly retarded and physically disabled. 
</P>
<P>
The nine rooms in that unit resemble medical clinics more than classrooms. Rows 
of wheelchairs line the walls, and a water bed is placed in every room for 
students who are unable to sit up. 
</P>
<P>
The other two sections look like standard classrooms, although all of 
Willenberg's rooms are equipped with a phone for emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
"All three schools teach students with different levels of capabilities, of 
course," LoPorto said. "But the goal for all three is the same. That is, to 
teach them skills that make them as socially acceptable as possible. Even if 
that means taking years to learn how to bathe, or be able to buy things on a 
shopping list, that is quite an accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
Others succeed beyond that level and are able to hold low-skill jobs. For 
example, most of the 17 students who have reached 22 this year will go on to 
state-run workshops where they will perform simple tasks such as sorting nuts 
and bolts or stuffing envelopes for a small hourly wage. 
</P>
<P>
But Alberto Barrera is jumping into the true mainstream. The shy young man got 
a full-time job as a cook at the fast-food restaurant where he has worked 
part-time for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
At last week's graduation ceremony, Barrera was singled out for three honors. 
He received two recognition awards, one from the Masonic lodge and another from 
the Elks Club, and a teacher read aloud a letter from Barrera's employer, 
describing the graduate as "the most knowledgeable employee I have." 
</P>
<P>
The crowd applauded enthusiastically, while Barrera broke into a sheepish grin. 
</P>
<P>
Later, his mother, Maria DeJesus Estrada, recalled that someone recently told 
her that she should be proud of her retarded son. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't understand," she said. "I think of him as a good son and not as a 
retarded son."

TWO WHO WANT TO LIMIT OFFICE TENURE DIFFER ON HOW TO DO IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD FARIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Proponents of initiatives to limit City Council terms in two Palos Verdes 
Peninsula cities are reacting differently to a state Court of Appeal ruling 
that such local regulations are invalid because eligibility to hold office is 
controlled by state law. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills Estates City Councilwoman Jacki McGuire, though not retreating 
from her view that it is "absolutely essential" to limit council service to two 
terms, said she has shelved plans to circulate initiative petitions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Avoiding Lawsuits 
</P>
<P>
"I do not wish to engage in any type of litigation," said McGuire, who 
advocated limiting terms when she successfully campaigned for office in a March 
special election. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire said she will try to drum up interest in a statewide measure to put 
limitation of terms into state election law. 
</P>
<P>
In neighboring Rancho Palos Verdes, on the other hand, resident Joel Justin 
King said he plans to proceed with a petition drive for a November initiative 
limiting council service to two terms. He called the court ruling a "denial of 
the constitutional right to limit tenure in office." 
</P>
<P>
City Clerk Jo Purcell, however, said that even if King obtains enough voters' 
signatures to qualify his initiative, it will not be put on the ballot. "The 
city attorney would issue an opinion saying it could not be put on the ballot 
because it is unconstitutional," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills Estates and Rancho Palos Verdes are general-law cities. Such 
cities operate under the general laws of the state rather than their own 
municipal charters. 
</P>
<P>
In a ruling affecting the general-law city of South San Francisco, the 1st 
Appellate District court in San Francisco ruled on whether South San Francisco 
City Councilwoman Roberta Cerri Teglia should hold office. 
</P>
<P>
Teglia, who is serving a third term on the South San Francisco council, was 
reelected in 1987 despite an ordinance limiting council members to two 
consecutive terms, according to Jim Parrinello, her attorney. 
</P>
<P>
t The appellate court decided that numerous state code provisions governing 
eligibility to hold office in general-law cities indicate that the state 
governs such matters. 
</P>
<P>
Parrinello said the South San Francisco city attorney believed the local law 
was invalid, but it had not been repealed by the City Council. Warren 
Steinkamp, a former councilman, challenged Teglia's reelection in a lawsuit, 
Parrinello said. 
</P>
<P>
The April 12 appellate court opinion became law when it was published and was 
not appealed to the state Supreme Court within the specified time limit. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole area of term and scope and nature of election has been preempted, 
certainly in general-law cities," said Richard R. Terzian, Rolling Hills 
Estates city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legal Opinion Differs 
</P>
<P>
But because the Teglia case involved a general-law city, legal opinion is 
divided over its application to charter cities such as Redondo Beach and 
Cerritos, which have ordinances limiting time in office to two terms. 
</P>
<P>
The Redondo Beach law, enacted in a charter election in 1975, prevented former 
Mayor Barbara Doerr and Councilman Archie Snow from running for their offices 
again this year. The two then ran for other offices: Doerr won election to a 
council seat in the March General Election and Snow was defeated in a bid for 
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Gordon Phillips was firm in his belief that the Teglia case is 
limited to general-law cities and does not apply to Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We would certainly contend that the number of terms a person can serve is a 
municipal affair within the purview of a charter city," he said. "The charter 
regulates municipal affairs." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips said this view is strengthened by the fact that the term limit was 
voted in "by the people as a charter initiative. . . . My thinking is, the 
courts would give great deference to this." 
</P>
<P>
For her part, Doerr said, she supports the two-term limit and would not favor a 
legal challenge. "It's good," she said. "You need new blood, new ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Snow could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Cerritos two-term limit was approved by voters in 1986 as a means of 
preventing long-term incumbents from seeking office again. But confusing 
wording led City Atty. Ken Brown to issue an opinion that the limit applied 
only to terms beginning after the ordinance took effect. It has yet to prevent 
anyone from running again. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Statewide Interest' 
</P>
<P>
Brown, like Phillips, said he does not believe the Teglia ruling applies to 
Cerritos as a charter city. But, he said, a court might decide that the issue 
of term limitation is "a matter of statewide interest" and apply it to both 
general-law and charter cities. 
</P>
<P>
Teglia's attorney Parrinello said he thinks the ruling applies to both 
categories of cities because one of the cases cited by the Court of Appeal 
related to eligibility of elected officers in a chartered county. 
</P>
<P>
"We used this case as precedent in the Teglia matter," he said, adding that the 
other side attempted to distinguish between the two. But the court held that 
"the distinction is not pertinent in this case." 
</P>
<P>
Parrinello said there may be a distinction when it comes to executive officers, 
such as a mayor, because although there are no limits on consecutive terms in 
Congress, there is a constitutional limit on presidential terms. 
</P>
<P>
Terzian also said he believes charter cities as well as general-law cities are 
affected by the ruling, adding that the reason cities have adopted term 
limitations is that "no one has said 'no' before." 
</P>
<P>
Although they have decided to take different roads on term limitations, 
McGuire, in Rolling Hills Estates, and King, in Rancho Palos Verdes, are united 
in a belief that the limitations are needed. 
</P>
<P>
"When individuals hold office for long periods of time, they lose their 
perspective, and they stop listening to the residents," said McGuire. 
</P>
<P>
King said: "If we can't limit tenure in office, we might as well have a king."

EX-TENANTS WIN CASE IN COURT, BUT RELOCATION CHECK BOUNCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The displaced tenants of convicted slumlord Martin Cantor, who celebrated a 
victory Tuesday when a judge ordered their former landlord to pay them $4,000 
apiece in relocation fees, discovered Thursday that their troubles weren't 
over. 
</P>
<P>
The check bounced. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so angry right now I can't even think," said Dee Petty, a counselor at 
Toberman Settlement House in San Pedro. Petty has been assisting the four 
tenants since March, when Cantor promised them the money if they moved out of 
an apartment building he owned at 2319 S. Pacific Ave. 
</P>
<P>
Said tenant Josephine Shields: "This is a lot of garbage." 
</P>
<P>
Cantor's lawyer, Michael Stephenson, said in an interview that the $16,000 -- 
which he gave to the tenants Tuesday in the form of a bank draft -- would 
become available today. Stephenson complained that the tenants deposited the 
draft too quickly, before Cantor had a chance to arrange for the money to be 
transferred into his account. 
</P>
<P>
"No one expected that . . . immediately they would run out and try to cash the 
draft," Stephenson said. "That wasn't foreseen realistically by anyone." 
</P>
<P>
The deputy city attorney who prosecuted Cantor said that, if the tenants do not 
receive the money by today, she will ask San Pedro Municipal Court Judge Roy 
Ferkich to issue a warrant for Cantor's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Ferkich sentenced Cantor to 45 days in jail, beginning Oct. 2, for 
maintaining slum conditions at the Pacific Avenue apartment house. Had Cantor's 
lawyer not turned over the $16,000 bank draft, Ferkich would have sentenced 
Cantor to six months in jail.

"I was thinking in my mind that, since the judge ordered him to give up the 
money that he would try to do right to keep from going to jail," said a 
frustrated Shields late Thursday afternoon. "But evidently, he don't care one 
way or the other."

WILMINGTON, HARBOR CITY PLAN WILL BE REVISED AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
L.A. PLANNERS DELAY ACTION AFTER HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After listening for two hours to a wide range of complaints and comments, the 
Los Angeles Planning Commission Thursday once again delayed action on a plan 
that will shape the growth of Wilmington and Harbor City into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, commissioners instructed the city planning staff to examine the issues 
raised during Thursday's hearing and make further revisions in the proposed 
Wilmington-Harbor City Community Plan. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, with the new revisions, is scheduled to come back before the 
commission for the third time on Aug. 24. Commission President William Luddy 
said he hopes the commission will be able to adopt the plan at that time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Update 1970 Plan 
</P>
<P>
The revised plan will update one that was written in the late 1960s and adopted 
in 1970. The old plan left the two communities -- but Wilmington in particular 
-- subject to a patchwork of development that has allowed factories and heavy 
industry to crop up alongside single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
The new plan, which is designed to govern growth until the year 2010, tries to 
correct that. But the clash between residents and industry was evident Thursday 
in the comments of several dozen community leaders, property owners and 
business people. 
</P>
<P>
For example: 
</P>
<P>
The plan proposes zoning designations that will create a buffer between auto 
dismantling yards and nearby residential neighborhoods. Those dismantling yards 
that fall within the buffer zone would be designated "nonconforming," meaning 
they could continue to operate but would have to get special permission to 
expand. The affected businesses are fighting the nonconforming designation. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for Exxon pressed the commission to permit the Wilmington Oil Field to 
remain classified as "non-urbanized." The new plan proposes that by Jan. 1, 
2000, the oil field be designated "urbanized" -- a stricter classification 
that, lawyer Gail Gordon said, would severely hamper Exxon's oil extraction 
activities by forcing the company to cap some wells. "We think it's unrealistic 
to recognize the viability of an oil field and then cut us down," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilmington community leaders asked that a parcel at the foot of Avalon 
Boulevard, where they are planning a waterfront development, be designated 
solely for commercial uses. Under the proposed plan, only a small part of the 
parcel would be zoned for commercial development. The remainder of the 
property, which houses a tank farm belonging to the city Department of Water 
and Power, would be zoned for heavy industry. 
</P>
<P>
Residents want the tank farm eliminated eventually. "Everything in Wilmington 
is industrial," community leader Gertrude Schwab complained at Thursday's 
hearing. "Wilmington has always been, and still is, the poor stepchild of Los 
Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to striking a balance between residential and industrial uses, the 
revised plan is intended to promote revitalization of Wilmington's downtown 
business district, preserve open space, curb truck traffic and protect the 
single-family character of Wilmington's neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
On that last score, some residents have contended the plan does not go far 
enough. Community activist JoAnn Wysocki, for example, recommended Thursday 
that east Wilmington, which she said consists primarily of single-family homes, 
be zoned R1, which allows single-family development only. The proposed plan 
calls for the area to be zoned R2, allowing duplexes. 
</P>
<P>
"We are asking, we are pleading, we are literally throwing ourselves on your 
mercy to encourage, enhance and preserve the single-family nature of this 
area," she told the commission. 
</P>
<P>
It will now be up to the Planning Department staff to evaluate these 
suggestions and respond to them, either by arguing against them or by altering 
the plan to conform to them. 
</P>
<P>
The lengthy plan -- which includes maps, population estimates, housing data and 
zoning designations for every piece of property in the two harbor-area 
communities -- has been inching its way through the city bureaucracy for the 
past six years. Those familiar with it agree that most of the work is done and 
that the upcoming revisions involve fine-tuning. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the delays -- and despite predictions by some city officials that it 
may be yet another year before the plan is adopted by the City Council and put 
into place -- residents seemed pleased with the progress. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not frustrated," said Wysocki, "because every time we come to one of these 
hearings we get a little bit more, and the city commissioners understand us a 
little bit more."

SCALED-BACK PLAYA VISTA BUILDING PLAN IS RELEASED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Playa Vista, the massive residential and commercial project proposed for south 
of Marina del Rey, is shaping into neighborhoods with a mix of mid-rise office 
buildings and low-rise residential complexes. 
</P>
<P>
At public meetings last week, Nelson C. Rising, who heads the development team 
for Maguire Thomas Partners, unveiled preliminary drawings that showed three- 
and four-story residential courtyard complexes down the street from five- and 
six-story office buildings in a campus-like setting. 
</P>
<P>
Rising said he does not expect any residential complex to be taller than six 
stories, or any commercial office building to be taller than 10 stories, which 
is below the ridgeline of the nearby Westchester bluffs. 
</P>
<P>
Besides providing some early glimpses of the development's overall 
architectural look, the latest plans show several significant changes from 
earlier versions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Open Space 
</P>
<P>
About 2,300 residential units and 70,000 square feet of retail business space 
that had been planned for the southwest corner of Lincoln and Jefferson 
boulevards have been relocated. Those 47 acres will remain open, although an 
interpretive nature center may be built. 
</P>
<P>
The elimination of development on this site is contingent on settlement of a 
lawsuit filed against the developers by Friends of Ballona Wetlands, a 
preservation group. 
</P>
<P>
The previous developer had agreed to set aside 175 acres of wetlands and 41 
acres of sand dunes, and had pledged $10 million to the National Audubon 
Society to restore and maintain the wetlands. These provisions have been 
incorporated by Maguire Thomas Partners. 
</P>
<P>
A six-story senior citizen housing complex that had been planned for the far 
west corner of the parcel is being replaced with a one- or two-story recreation 
center that will be accessible only by foot, bicycle or shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
The number of streets will be increased in the southeastern part of the 
957-acre tract, where most of the development will be concentrated. Rising said 
this will allow for a mix of shops, homes, offices and parks rather than 
clustering each use in separate areas that are accessible only by car. 
</P>
<P>
In some neighborhoods, people will live above street-level retail and office 
space. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the developers plan to build 11,100 residential units, about 5 million 
square feet of office space and about 680,000 square feet of retail space. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to create neighborhoods where everyone is within six minutes' 
walking distance of town centers," Rising said. "People will not need their 
cars to get from one place to another." 
</P>
<P>
In effect, said principal architect Andres Duany of Miami, the developers will 
attempt to build a new city by borrowing many of the elements of small towns 
before 1940. Ideally, many residents will be able to work and shop within 
walking distance of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all the housing will be in multifamily complexes of apartments, 
condominiums and townhouses.

DEVICE TO NAB RED-LIGHT RUNNERS FOUND INEFFECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was to have been the latest addition to Pasadena's high-tech traffic-control 
arsenal, a computerized surveillance camera that 24 hours a day could snap 
pictures of cars zipping through red lights. 
</P>
<P>
But after several months of testing at two busy intersections, enthusiasm for 
the device, called a Multafot, has stalled. 
</P>
<P>
Police were dismayed to find that the red-light sensors -- which along with the 
city's controversial photo radar system were firsts of their kind in California 
-- were being triggered by legal driving maneuvers nearly 95% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lot of False Photographs' 
</P>
<P>
"We were getting an awful lot of false photographs," said Lt. Robert Huff, 
adding that no citations were handed out during the tests. "I wouldn't say the 
problems are insurmountable . . . but there's a number of things that we have 
to take into account that we didn't know about." 
</P>
<P>
At the two intersections -- California Boulevard and Hill Avenue, and Fair Oaks 
Avenue and Union Street -- every three or four days the magnetic sensors placed 
in the pavement indicated that about 200 cars were running red lights. But 
after developing the film, an average of only 10 to 15 of the 200 cars 
photographed were actually filmed in illegal moves, Huff said. 
</P>
<P>
The device, which takes two rapid-fire photos every time it is triggered, 
showed that most of the cars had either stopped with their noses sticking a bit 
too far into the intersection or, in making a left turn, were forced to pass 
through a red light after waiting for oncoming traffic to come to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
"Technically, those could be violations, but we would never issue a citation 
because they're not really endangering anyone," said Huff, head of the Police 
Department's traffic division. "The idea was to get the actual red-light 
runners." 
</P>
<P>
However, the firm that sells the $45,000 Multafot, which has been used 
extensively in Switzerland and West Germany, said the problem in Pasadena was 
with the choice of intersections and the positioning of the sensors. 
</P>
<P>
Had city officials been more willing to fine-tune the location of the sensors 
or to select streets with more regimented traffic flows, the Multafot would 
have detected violators more efficiently, said Robert P. Umbdenstock, president 
of Multanova/RPJ Inc., based in San Anselmo, the U.S. distributor of the 
devices.

SHORT, SASSY CUTS FOR SUMMER; 
</P>
<P>
BUSY WOMEN OPT FOR EASY-CARE STYLES WITH VERSATILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE-MARIE TURK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last week, actress Brooke Palance took the plunge. She went from so-so 
shoulder-length hair to a chic, freewheeling style that is showing up on savvy 
women around the world. 
</P>
<P>
The cut of the season is short and boyish at the nape of the neck with feminine 
fullness through the crown. A longer top layer and subtle internal layering 
make for wash-and-wear ease, myriad styling possibilities and freedom from most 
hair-styling products. 
</P>
<P>
The sassy coiffure has no official name (although Vidal Sassoon calls its 
versions Turnstyles). And depending upon how it is slicked back, flipped, 
flopped or tousled, it can conjure images of English schoolboys, the Beatles, 
Joan of Arc, French gamins, Delphine Seyrig in "Last Year in Marienbad" or 
Audrey Hepburn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nifty Natural 
</P>
<P>
What makes it a nifty natural for summer and beyond is its softness, ease and 
versatility. It's ideal for busy, time-poor women. And it's the perfect topping 
for athletic bodies, higher hemlines, lower heels, softer shoulders, 
figure-framing silhouettes and the new emphasis on femininity mixed with 
man-tailored classic clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Liberating is the word Palance uses to describe her shorter, sleeker do. 
"There's nothing to hide behind. Your face is what shows." 
</P>
<P>
Although she was guided by Beverly Hills stylist Jose Eber, other women are 
taking their direction from top fashion models, such as Paris-based Linda 
Evangelista, among the first to be photographed with the '60s-inspired cut, and 
celebrities such as Ali MacGraw, whose new, short do caused a stir at this 
year's Academy Awards ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Eber created the MacGraw cut and notes with relief: "It takes no time at all to 
convince a woman it is feminine and sexy." MacGraw's style has "a boyish feel 
to it, but once you style it, it looks feminine. She wanted something carefree 
because she's very active. She wants to wash and dry it naturally. 
</P>
<P>
"What I like about hair now is it's freer and much healthier," Eber adds. "In 
the '70s, we spiked it, we gelled it, we bleached it, we permed it. Hair 
sometimes felt like cardboard. Now it's back to being healthy, shiny and fun." 
</P>
<P>
He finds the fresh, full shape flatters neck and shoulders and solves a problem 
for some clients. "You can create the head shape you want. If someone has a 
flat head, you can cut the hair so it looks rounder." 
</P>
<P>
Stylist Allen Edwards estimates he takes 10 to 15 women each week from long to 
very short hair at his salons, including one in Beverly Hills and two in the 
San Fernando Valley. He thinks some women are influenced by world events as 
much as by fashion. 
</P>
<P>
"It's subconscious, but with so many negative things in the news, women want to 
do something positive for themselves, something to lift them up." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards likes to add natural-looking color to short cuts. He's partial to dark 
reds and rich auburns. The color should be solid rather than woven through the 
hair, he says. And he advises using a light gel on hair for shine. 
</P>
<P>
On a whim, actress-producer Patricia Carr-Bosley recently decided to get her 
haircut. She says Edwards "picked up his scissors and in about 10 minutes it 
was short. I didn't have time to cry." Her cropped hair is "shorter in back 
than most men wear theirs today and shaggy around the face with a lot of heavy 
bangs." 
</P>
<P>
For variety, Carr-Bosley says she combs it back like a little boy when she gets 
out of the pool or gels it straight back to make it look very European. 
</P>
<P>
She predicts the change will help her career: "This is going to open me up. 
When you have long blond hair, you're really pigeon-holed into the sexy roles 
that I've played." 
</P>
<P>
At Barron's salon in Studio City, owner Barron Matalon says the newly popular 
style reminds him of the '60s, mushroom-shape cut created by Vidal Sassoon. But 
it's much more layered, freer and messier now, notes Matalon, who recently 
turned both Vanessa Vadim (Jane Fonda's daughter) and actress Anne Schedeen 
very short on top. Sometimes he adds spidery tendrils at the sides and at the 
nape of the neck. If a very angular face needs more softness, he adds more 
layering. 
</P>
<P>
He uses color to deepen the outer layers and lighten the inner layers, which 
leaves "the crown really gleaming, and you have a nice definition line around 
the head." 
</P>
<P>
Like Edwards, he prefers red these days. In fact, he believes that red, not 
blond, is the most popular California color. "If you don't have a lively 
looking complexion, red brings it alive," he finds. 
</P>
<P>
Some stylists contend that short hair actually affects a woman's mood. Michael 
Morgan of L'Image salon in West Hollywood notices a change in model 
Evangelista, since she went short. (Her trend-setting cut is by Julien B. of Is 
in Paris.) 
</P>
<P>
"Before, she had a rather stern attitude," Morgan observes. "Beautiful, but 
stern. With this short cut, she has an ingratiating look. It's real. It's 
honest." 
</P>
<P>
Looking for a similar honesty, Stacey Pickren, an actress who recently switched 
careers, decided to change her image earlier this month: "I didn't want that 
Hollywood-actress look anymore," says Pickren, now a partner in a video 
production company. 
</P>
<P>
She went from "massive hair down to the middle of my back" to what she calls a 
1920s English schoolboy cut, styled by Tom Brophy at Vidal Sassoon in Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
She counts six ways she can wear "the texturized tomboy cut," including 
naturally wavy, slicked back, parted on one side with curls falling near one 
cheek or with all her hair blown straight toward her face. 
</P>
<P>
For Pickren, cutting off her hair meant more than keeping up with the latest 
style. "It's a very exposed look," she says. "I'm not hiding behind my hair 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
But she cautions: "I think you have to be ready before you can go really short. 
I'm making a conscious career change. I feel very confident these days. I'm 
ready to say, 'This is who I am.' "

THE TINY SPARK THAT SURVIVED; 
</P>
<P>
THE ROCK 'N' ROLL LIFE OF STAR'S CHILD BRIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
It's noon, and the lobby of the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel is swarming with 
the ladies-who-lunch set. Today especially they all look alike, these women who 
wear their Chanel suits, Charles Jourdan shoes and daytime jewels like merit 
badges for a life without problems. 
</P>
<P>
Slowly, a dainty, diminutive blond woman makes her way through the throng. 
Outwardly, she seems just as well-bred and well-dressed as everyone else, 
though a shade less chic in her off-the-rack knit dress. You can't put your 
finger on it, but something makes her stand out in the crowd -- maybe the 
expression of detached bemusement that's fixed upon her face. 
</P>
<P>
"Hi. I'm Myra Lewis," she says, pausing while her visitor's jaw drops open and 
then shuts again. "So what kind of picture did you have of me in your mind?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Different Image 
</P>
<P>
How about someone sort of boozed-up and blowzy-looking, with 10 divorces under 
her belt and a tragic history of addictions, abandonments, break-ups and 
breakdowns, who still wears a whiff of the worldwide notoriety that surrounded 
her Dec. 12, 1957, marriage at age 13 to her 22-year-old second cousin, rock 
'n' roller Jerry Lee Lewis? 
</P>
<P>
Well, then, certainly not this mature woman who's a Chamber of Commerce model 
of the Atlanta businesswoman, a published author and the subject of the 
just-released Hollywood movie "Great Balls of Fire," based upon her 
autobiography of the same name. 
</P>
<P>
She laughs. "I know the image you probably conjured up. I used to always hate 
it if people knew who I was before they met me. Because if they meet me and 
talk to me, then I say, 'Oh, by the way, this is my background,' it's like, 
'Whaaaat?!' But if it's before . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
She shrugs. 
</P>
<P>
"After my divorce, I had to go to a psychiatrist because I thought I've got to 
have lost it. You can't go through a life like that and come out and be OK. I 
must be insane. 
</P>
<P>
"But none of the psychiatrists would tell me I was crazy. They would say, 
'You're fine. You're fine.' But I never felt fine." 
</P>
<P>
As she says this, her eyes begin to mist. Her voice begins to quiver. 
</P>
<P>
And then the tears trickle down. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Like Years of Therapy' 
</P>
<P>
"Writing that book was like years of therapy for me. I went through a lifetime 
of grief and happiness and sadness and love and joy and scandal and all those 
things. And when the book was finished, it was gone. I felt free of my life 
because it was between those covers. And, suddenly, it just all made sense. I 
understood not only what happened, but why. 
</P>
<P>
"You see, Myra did not survive that marriage. That little girl I used to be, 
she died. She just dispersed into whatever. But there was this tiny spark of 
life left, and that's me. What you're seeing is probably the most successful 
success story that I know." 
</P>
<P>
Her life is so different now compared to what it once was. She is, after all, a 
44-year-old mother and part-owner of an Atlanta real-estate firm with her third 
husband, Richard Williams, whom she wed in 1984. She listens to Barbra 
Streisand's records instead of Jerry Lee Lewis's. She doesn't even like today's 
rock music, except for a few songs by Huey Lewis and the News. 
</P>
<P>
And, yet, let her hear the words that Jerry Lee Lewis wrote when she divorced 
him in 1970, "She Even Woke Me Up to Say Goodbye," and she'll cry every time. 
Now, with the paperback release of her autobiography and Winona Ryder's 
portrayal of her on the silver screen, Lewis is stocking up on Kleenex for the 
tears she knows will inevitably fall. 
</P>
<P>
"But people misinterpret why. Like, I was in Memphis last week and this 
interviewer asked me a question about the movie, and I just started to cry. And 
she grabbed me later and she said, 'You're still in love with him, aren't you?' 
</P>
<P>
"And I said, 'No, I'm not in love with Jerry. But I'm a soft, warm, feeling 
person and I didn't destroy my emotions when I cleansed myself of my past. I'm 
still very easily touched by the man. If I could walk away and not care, then 
I'm no better than an animal.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Skipped the Premiere 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, she passed up attending Monday's New York premiere of "Great 
Balls of Fire," opting instead to escape to Hawaii. She hasn't seen the movie 
yet. She doesn't know when she will. "I'm told that this movie made Jerry cry. 
So I get this lump right here," she says, touching her throat, "because I 
already know what it's going to do to me. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to rip me apart. And yet I've been dying to see it. But, all of a 
sudden, it's here and I'm going, 'Wait a second, I'm not sure I want to do 
this.' So I'm putting it off." 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, when her curiosity got the best of her, she visited the Memphis set 
of "Great Balls of Fire" -- even though the producers had politely requested 
that she and Jerry Lee Lewis stay away. "They just came out and said, 'Look, we 
don't want these actors playing you. We want them playing what we want them to 
play,' " Lewis recalls. "But it was impossible to keep us apart." 
</P>
<P>
Though she received $100,000 for her life story, Lewis is bitter about not 
being consulted on either the writing or casting of the movie despite promises 
to that effect. Someone from the office of producer Adam Fields simply sent her 
a copy of the screenplay and told her that 17-year-old Winona Ryder would be 
playing her. At first, Lewis didn't even know who Ryder was. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I ran out and rented 'Beetlejuice' so I could see this little girl who's 
going to play me. I saw a little girl who can act, and I thought, 'Oh, this is 
good.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hanging Out With Quaid 
</P>

And while her ex-husband was hanging out with his screen double Dennis Quaid, 
Lewis on the day before shooting was to start found herself sitting in Ryder's 
trailer, sipping hot chocolate and talking for hours. "We talked about her 
going to school, we talked about her father, we talked about everything except 
the movie," recalls Lewis, who learned that Ryder's father had been a huge fan 
of Jerry Lee Lewis and given his daughter a copy of "Great Balls of Fire" when 
it was published in hardcover in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt like she was my child, like I was her mother. She was the youthful 
Myra." 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks later, Ryder phoned Lewis and said: "I got married today." Lewis 
went into immediate shock. "And then I realized that Myra got married today on 
the set," she says, her eyes beginning to water again. 
</P>
<P>
Another tear. Another explanation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Just a Book' 
</P>
<P>
"You see, it's not just a book I wrote," she says quietly. "It's us." 
</P>
<P>
When she was researching her book, Lewis one day called up her ex-husband and 
asked when he realized he was in love with her. "And he said, 'Girl,' as he 
would affectionately call me all my life, 'I loved you from the first time I 
laid eyes on you. You were sitting at the kitchen table doing your homework and 
I knew then I was going to marry you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Lewis was touched by his memory, and she knew then and there she couldn't trash 
him in her autobiography. "Because it's a great love story. It's a fantastic 
love story. And most great love stories end in tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
She was drawn to him in the beginning, she recalls, because "he was a little 
boy. And he needed someone to take care of him. I was supposed to be the child, 
but he was the child in our relationship, really." 
</P>
<P>
Immature for her age (she still played with dolls) though physically 
well-developed, Lewis looking back thinks she was drawn into such an early 
marriage because she had "an overactive nurturing instinct. From the time I 
could remember, all I wanted was a little vine-covered cottage with a husband 
and a baby in a high chair. My mother actually gave birth to my little brother 
for me because I had begged her so hard for one. And I would go baby-sit for my 
neighbors for free just so I could hold their babies." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sense of Urgency 
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the marriage, she maintains, is that her love affair with 
Lewis took place against the backdrop of the Atomic Age. "I grew up in the '50s 
when it was said this H-bomb, or A-bomb or whatever bomb it was, could come at 
any moment, and then life as we knew it would cease to exist. I felt like it 
was going to happen any moment, and I was never going to have my life. So it 
was like, 'Let's do it.' I didn't instigate 'Let's do it,' but when it 
presented itself to me and I was given Jerry's ultimatum of now or never, well, 
I took it." 
</P>
<P>
Though Jerry Lee Lewis, who had been married twice previously, eloped with his 
child bride at the height of his stardom, a scandal didn't ensue until May 22, 
1958, when they arrived in England for a massively publicized tour and a Fleet 
Street journalist asked Myra, "Who are you, Miss?" 
</P>
<P>
She innocently replied, "Jerry's wife," and all hell broke out. 
</P>
<P>
For the next 10 years, Lewis found himself branded a "baby snatcher" and his 
singing career destroyed. He went from making $10,000 a night in ballrooms and 
concert halls to $100 split four ways in squalid Arkansas honky-tonks. "Guilty, 
that's how I felt," Myra Lewis recalls. "I just knew I was the stick they were 
going to use to beat him over the head with. All of a sudden, I wanted to say, 
'Let me explain this,' to make all this bad stuff go away. You see, writing 
this book was something I wanted to do back then in 1958 when all the news came 
out. But I never lost sight of that dream of wanting to defend Jerry and just 
set the record straight, at least one time." 
</P>
<P>
While still grieving for their loss of income and stardom, the couple also 
endured the accidental drowning of their first born, Steve Allen Lewis, who was 
named for the TV talk show host who gave Lewis his first national exposure. 
They later had a daughter, Phoebe, now 25. ("I think my daughter takes good 
notes," the mother explains. "She didn't have a boyfriend until she was 16, she 
doesn't drink and she's never taken drugs.") 
</P>
<P>
As the years progressed and her husband's career began to pick up again, Lewis 
became a scapegoat for his unhappiness and sometimes even his physical abuse. 
By 1970, their last year of marriage, she had to call the police the night he 
knocked her to the floor and threatened to kill her if she ever got up the 
nerve to leave him. That fall she found out he was cheating on her, hired a 
detective to tail him and finally served him with divorce papers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Final Plea 
</P>
<P>
When she left, he was standing at the front door, arms outstretched, crying, 
"Please don't leave." 
</P>
<P>
"I was angry at Jerry. Why did he have to be so mean? Why did he have to tell 
me I was ugly and stupid and nobody would ever have me? So he took my 
self-confidence to the ground. And I wound up turning to the first man that was 
nice to me." 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after her divorce was final, she married the detective she had 
hired, Pete Malito, and moved to Atlanta. The marriage lasted only a year and a 
half. 
</P>
<P>
"Talk about a mistake. Now that was a stupid mistake," she explains. "But I was 
glad to be out of Memphis because I could never have been anyone but Jerry's 
ex-wife. In Atlanta, I could be Myra Malito and a nobody, and that's exactly 
who I wanted to be." 
</P>
<P>
With an 8-year-old daughter to support, a paltry child support payment and a 
$125,000 alimony settlement payable over five years ("And we went to court 
every year for five years," she notes), Lewis in 1973 had to figure out how to 
make a living. "There were not many job openings for 'ex-wives of.' After all 
the financial work I had done for Jerry, I did have a little business sense. 
But I had no training." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The 'Mundane' Period 
</P>
<P>
She found a job as a $93-a-week receptionist and embarked on the most "mundane" 
period of her life. For the next five years, she worked and raised her daughter 
and baked brownies. And she also hired a co-writer, found an agent and began 
her book. "There were a couple of times I almost gave it up because I felt as 
if it wasn't worth it. I was going back and reliving it. I was waking up in the 
middle of the night and crying myself to sleep. But I didn't give it up. I made 
friends with my past, instead." 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, when the book was published by William Morrow in hardcover, sales were 
sparse. "I was disappointed, but I was not really disillusioned by it. I just 
said, well, the real life of this book is going to come when it goes into mass 
paperback." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she had received her real estate license, met Williams and joined 
his Century 21 office, where she specializes in big-ticket homes. How did she 
tell him about her past? 
</P>
<P>
"I gave him the book, he read it, and he just said, 'My hat's off to you,' " 
Lewis recalls. She says that, since then, her new husband has never had a need 
to feel jealous. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm here to tell you," says Williams, whom Lewis likens more to Alan Alda than 
her ex-husband, "that girl has pulled herself up by her own bootstraps. If ever 
there's a woman out there who doesn't need a man, she's it."

U.S. SALUTES 'HANDS-ON' MISSILE TREATY COMPLIANCE

<P>
Brig. Gen. Roland LaJoie can scarcely believe that only four years have passed 
since an American officer under his command was shot to death by a Soviet 
sentry protecting an empty tank shed at a training ground in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Now, LaJoie is commander of the U.S. forces that are monitoring Soviet 
compliance with the year-old treaty banning ground-launched medium-range 
nuclear missiles. And the Soviets are smilingly permitting his inspectors to 
view and touch -- and soon to X-ray -- some of their most secret missiles 
inside the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
LaJoie, who was commanding officer of the U.S. detachment in which the sentry's 
victim, Maj. Arthur D. Nicholson Jr., served, is almost disbelieving about the 
new U.S. accessibility. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just unreal at times," he said, "that Nicholson died then and now we can 
literally put our arms around an SS-25 missile." 
</P>
<P>
LaJoie said the Soviets "are holding up their end of the bargain" in complying 
with the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty. The first anniversary of the 
treaty's implementation is Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not cutting them any slack (allowing flexibility) whatsoever," LaJoie 
said in a recent interview. "Every possible violation is examined. We've had 
some problems and they've had some problems, but we've worked them out 
satisfactorily." 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration formally concluded last week that "the record of 
compliance on the INF treaty generally has been quite good. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been a few cases where we have raised anomalies with the Soviets, 
and . . . they have hastened to resolve those to our satisfaction," Secretary 
of State James A. Baker III told Congress. "We are satisfied there have been no 
violations." 
</P>
<P>
About half a dozen minor violations have been alleged by each side, according 
to U.S. officials. But most have dealt with an isolated training missile or 
launcher that was apparently lost in the huge arsenals until they were 
discovered by spy satellites. 
</P>
<P>
One Soviet complaint dealt with an old Pershing 1A launcher. "Maybe they 
couldn't read the 'German air force' letters from overhead," one official said. 
Because the vehicle belongs to West Germany, it is not covered by the treaty, 
although the missiles themselves, also German-owned, are to be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
The lessons learned in verifying the INF treaty are certain to be reflected in 
the much more extensive and intrusive verification rules that the Bush 
Administration is asking the Soviets to accept in the Strategic Arms Reduction 
Talks -- and even to implement in advance of signing an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
One of these lessons so far is that the United States has sometimes engaged in 
technological "overkill" in its zeal to make sure that the Soviets are not 
cheating, with delays caused by the complexity of some monitoring instruments. 
But the equipment and procedures may turn out to be necessary for a strategic 
arms treaty verification, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. On-Site Inspection Agency that LaJoie heads has conducted 245 
inspection missions in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe under INF 
provisions, compared to 97 Soviet missions to the United States and Western 
Europe. Each nation also has established a "perimeter and portal monitoring" 
system at one missile plant in the other country -- the Soviet plant is at 
Votkinsk in the Ural Mountain foothills and the U.S. plant is at Magna, Utah -- 
staffed by up to 30 on-site inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Both Ahead of Schedule 
</P>
<P>
Both sides are ahead of schedule in destroying missiles and associated 
equipment. In the presence of U.S. inspectors, the Soviets have exploded or 
launched about half of their missiles (1,030 of a total of 1,846 SS-20s and 
other smaller missiles) to be eliminated. Similarly, the United States has 
destroyed more than one-third of its weapons (325 of 846 Pershing 2 and 
ground-launched cruise missiles). 
</P>
<P>
The arsenals on both sides of missiles with ranges from 300 to 3,400 miles are 
to be eliminated by July 1, 1991. For 10 more years, until the treaty expires 
in 2001, each side will continue to have on-site inspection rights to guard 
against violations. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last year, the United States also has taken advantage of the unique 
"cooperative measures" clause in the INF treaty in which American satellites 
photograph bases now containing SS-25 mobile long-range missiles that once held 
or could hold the SS-20 intermediate-range weapons banned by the agreement. The 
United States has no mobile missiles comparable to the SS-25, so the clause 
applies only to Soviet bases. 
</P>
<P>
Six times in the last year at U.S. request, all of the SS-25 missiles at these 
bases were wheeled out and exposed for 12 hours, with the roofs of their 
so-called "garages" opened while they were photographed from space to ensure 
that no SS-20 missile was among them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all encouraging," LaJoie said. "Some people believe that INF verification 
is a picnic compared to the demands of START (the proposed strategic arms 
treaty). Still, it's been a good start." 
</P>
<P>
Besides providing confidence that the Soviets are not cheating, the INF 
verification experience has shown that relations between the superpower 
inspectors can be professional and that procedures agreed to can be carried out 
without infringing on the host's security concerns. No inspector on either side 
has been caught in any illegal activities. 
</P>
<P>
But on-site inspection has also shown U.S. hosts that there is a reciprocal 
discomfort in hosting Soviet inspectors. Under the strategic arms treaty, more 
attention is expected to be paid to the "Red-on-Blue dimension," or the 
disadvantages of permitting Soviet inspectors in the United States, one U.S. 
official predicted, including the cost of protecting U.S. secrets. 
</P>
<P>
Many more types of missiles and associated equipment are expected to be covered 
under that treaty, along with bombers and their equipment. What could prove the 
most difficult to monitor are the ceilings on the weapons -- 6,000 warheads and 
1,600 "delivery systems" with a range greater than 3,400 miles. 
</P>
<P>
The INF treaty requires the elimination of all missiles covered by its terms, 
so that even one such weapon found after July 1, 1991, would violate the 
agreement. Under the strategic arms accord, the weapons will have to be counted 
against the various limits, a much more difficult task. 
</P>
<P>
Many perimeter and portal monitoring systems probably will be set up in each 
nation, with some provision for "tagging" weapons coming out of production so 
that they can be identified later as "legal" missiles or bombers as distinct 
from possible clandestine or "illegal" production. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. technological complexity in monitoring the INF treaty is most apparent 
at the Votkinsk missile assembly plant. U.S. inspectors there use 28 TV 
cameras, while Soviet inspectors at the Magna plant rely on four. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, U.S. inspectors at Votkinsk use an infrared scanner to measure the 
outside dimensions of railroad cars and trucks, feeding the information into a 
computer that decides if the vehicle is large enough to contain an item limited 
by the treaty. The Soviets use a long pole with graduated black and white 
stripes to make the same measurements. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. inspectors at Votkinsk also soon will have a high-powered X-ray "cargo 
scanner" to peer inside missiles to ensure that the Soviets are complying by 
not hiding smaller SS-20 missiles inside the shells of bigger SS-25s. Why the 
Soviets would want to hide a less capable weapon inside a more capable one is 
unclear, but the treaty provides for inspecting eight missiles each year with 
such a device. 
</P>
<P>
The 9-million-electron-volt X-ray machine, costing between $6 million and $14 
million, did not exist before the treaty was signed. Building the device has 
taken longer than expected, and Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), an outspoken skeptic 
of arms agreements with the Soviets, has complained that the machine should 
have been in Votkinsk last December. It will not be in place until October. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets have insisted on extensive test results and other documents 
relating to the capability of the machine. U.S. officials privately have called 
their requests reasonable and have said they are intended to ensure that the 
machine will not pick up information beyond what is permitted by the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
The machine is permitted to view only a "slice" of the missile, but depending 
on its power and scope, for example, it could learn details of the rocket 
motor, including even the composition of its fuel grains. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets have reciprocal rights to put an X-ray machine at Magna. So far 
they have not, and U.S. officials speculate that they never will.

BUSH CAMPAIGN REFORMS SEEK CURBS ON PACS

<P>
President Bush, unveiling a campaign finance program intended to "free our 
electoral system from the grip of special interests," called Thursday for the 
elimination of corporate and union committees that pump millions of dollars 
into congressional election campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also proposed measures intended to reduce the advantages of congressional 
incumbency, to boost the role of political parties by increasing the amounts 
that they can spend on congressional races and to limit free congressional 
mailings. And, raising what has proved to be a particularly thorny issue, the 
President said that he would work with Congress on developing a plan to raise 
House and Senate salaries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accent on Individual 
</P>
<P>
"We need reforms that curtail the role of special interests, enhance the role 
of the individual and strengthen the parties," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
His plan was criticized by Democrats as one that would favor Republicans, who 
are in a minority in the House and Senate, by trimming the campaign advantages 
of incumbents. In the 1980s, 97.7% of House incumbents seeking reelection have 
been successful, according to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Bush acknowledged such a likely result, saying in an interview Wednesday with 
The Times as he looked ahead to the proposal: "Well, I have a good reason to 
want to lock out the status quo in terms of control of the House or control of 
the Senate." 
</P>
<P>
The trouble the proposals, if enacted, might cause for incumbents led to 
predictions that they never would make it through Congress without major change 
or -- as a senior White House official acknowledged -- without a major public 
effort by the President to put pressure on the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
And Michael Berman, a Democratic Party expert on campaign finance, pointed out 
that the proposals would not prohibit individuals from creating political 
action committees and using their own contributions to pay for the committees' 
overhead. He argued that the proposals favor candidates supported by wealthy 
business leaders who could more easily create such groups to circumvent a ban 
on corporate committees, than could union groups that also would be banned. 
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) said: "While I welcome the President's 
willingness to join our ongoing reform efforts, I regret that he has chosen to 
submit proposals that blatantly favor the Republican Party and jeopardize 
bipartisan efforts already under way. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cites Soaring Costs 
</P>
<P>
"I also regret that the President failed to address the overriding issue in 
campaign reform, namely, the skyrocketing cost of campaigns. Any real reform 
package must include some proposal to bring this runaway spending under 
control." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to eliminating the political action committees run by unions, 
corporations and trade associations, which the White House said accounted for 
nearly 90% of the approximately $160 million spent by political action groups 
before the 1988 election, the President's program would: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reduce from $5,000 to $2,500 the limits on contributions by independent 
political action committees. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Prohibit all organizations except political party committees from 
soliciting contributions from employees or members and then sending them as one 
contribution to a candidate, without the amount counting toward overall 
contribution limits. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Increase, from approximately $46,000 to $115,000, the amount that the 
individual political parties can spend on House races. The sizable increase in 
this ceiling would be likely to favor the Republicans, who have had better luck 
raising funds than the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Prohibit the forwarding of a congressional or presidential candidate's 
leftover campaign funds to the next election campaign. Such funds have helped 
incumbents build long-running war chests. Under the proposal, the money could 
be handed over to the political parties, to the U.S. Treasury or returned to 
contributors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Curb on Free Mailings 
</P>
<P>
 -- Limit the use of the "franking" privilege by members of Congress so that 
huge quantities of newsletters and other brochures that can boost their 
campaigns could no longer be mailed without the cost of postage. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Require greater public disclosure of campaign funding, in particular the 
contributions by individuals to "get out the vote" efforts. In the 1988 
campaign, the lack of limits on such contributions allowed individuals to give 
thousands of dollars -- in some cases $100,000 -- to party efforts that were 
devoted to individual candidates, despite a $5,000 limit on an individual's 
contribution to any one candidate. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the proposal called for drawing up borders of congressional 
districts along community boundaries, to eliminate "gerrymandering" of 
districts that critics say can give advantages to one party or another by 
creating congressional districts that encompass specific groups of voters. 
</P>
<P>
Bush avoided tying his proposals to other ethics issues, including honorariums 
given to members of Congress and the related question of congressional 
salaries. But he said that he would, within a few days, propose a ban on 
honorariums and recommend a 25% pay increase for judges and an increase for 
certain professionals in the government, such as surgeons and scientists, to 
make government service more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, as their influence has grown, the political action committees 
have attracted increasing criticism. They represent an opportunity for 
individuals or groups with common policy goals to gather large sums and funnel 
them to candidates -- presumably with the goal of influencing their votes on 
legislation, if their campaigns succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, special interest political action committees and their $160-million war 
chest overshadow the great parties of Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln," 
Bush said in a speech to congressional and Administration interns at the 
Library of Congress. "And, as the strength of our parties erodes, so does the 
strength of our political system. 
</P>
<P>
"By necessity, members of Congress engage in time-consuming and often degrading 
appeals for money outside the party structure," he said.

When Luis Orlando Arias was a young delivery boy in his native El Salvador, one 
of his favorite stops was the Japanese Embassy. He would gaze wistfully at 
posters of Japanese temples and graceful women in kimonos strolling under the 
shade of cherry blossom trees. He yearned to learn more about the culture he 
had grown to admire, but the dream seemed as distant as Japan itself. 
</P>
<P>
Then he came to Los Angeles. Within a few years, Arias developed a taste for 
sushi and made new friends at Little Tokyo piano bars and arcades. A school bus 
driver who speaks English and Spanish, Arias has been studying Japanese at Los 
Angeles City College with the hope that it might someday broaden his 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Triumph' 
</P>
<P>
"For me it's been a dream come true, a triumph," said Arias, 36, who still 
harbors dreams of travel to Japan and plans to study Korean next. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly in this multilingual city, learning a second or third language is 
becoming an advantage, if not a necessity. The practicalities of doing business 
in an international capital, as well as the simple desire to communicate with 
new neighbors from Latin America and Asia, is fueling a surge in the popularity 
of foreign languages in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles phenomenon is part of a burgeoning national movement, spurred 
by the desire to make the country more competitive, according to experts in the 
field. Since the mid-1980s, high school and college foreign language 
enrollments have been rising significantly throughout the country. Berlitz 
Learning Centers for adults, the world's leading language school, reports 
significant national growth, with California among the leading states. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Growing Demand 
</P>
<P>
Students are flocking to classes -- particularly Spanish and, increasingly, 
Japanese -- on university campuses and at some community colleges and private 
language schools throughout Los Angeles County. Some schools report a growing 
demand by private firms and public agencies for classes offered at the 
work-site and tailored to their needs. The translating and interpreting 
business, meanwhile, is booming, with the ranks of court interpreters almost 
doubling each year, according to leaders in that field. 
</P>
<P>
The city's diverse ethnic mix provides unique combinations of languages and 
students. Downtown lawyers and bankers, eager to do business with the Orient, 
crowd Japanese classes; Korean merchants setting up shop in East Los Angeles 
practice their Spanish; a jeweler at I. Magnin studies Korean to better serve 
his growing Asian clientele. 
</P>
<P>
Those attracted to foreign language classes "are reading the same information 
we're reading that says the future of Los Angeles is multicultural," said 
Marianne Kanter, coordinator of language courses at UCLA's extension program. 
"And they're preparing themselves for that eventuality." 
</P>
<P>
Carmelita Arsena Thomas, who runs the study-abroad program at Los Angeles City 
College, also credits the new interest in languages to the realization that, in 
international trade, "our competitors are beating us at our own game because 
they have an edge of dealing with other cultures on their terms. Finally, the 
American business community is becoming aware that we have to know the language 
and culture of countries we want to do business with." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fastest-Growing Language 
</P>
<P>
Japanese is favored among businessmen, the fastest-growing language in the 
city, according to language experts. Some schools are also seeing increased 
demand for other Asian and some Middle Eastern languages. While traditionally 
strong Romance languages, particularly French, are holding their own, Spanish 
remains overwhelmingly the most popular language. 
</P>
<P>
Syrian-born Anahid Warwarian, 23, an accounting major at Los Angeles City 
College, said she decided to learn Spanish soon after coming from Canada to Los 
Angeles, where she found that Spanish is the city's "second language." Though 
she already speaks four languages, Spanish has helped her interpret for her 
jeweler husband and his Latino employees, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's imperative that we learn to appreciate Latino culture and the language 
since we live in the heart of it," said Derrick Harrison, a free-lance writer 
who lives in Echo Park. After struggling through a Spanish class at the 
community college last semester, Harrison compares not knowing Spanish in Los 
Angeles to "going to a symphonic concert, listening but not being able to hear 
the brass or the violin sections." 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, international bankers and merchants who floundered in high school and 
college French and Spanish classes now listen to Japanese language cassettes on 
their drive in to work, practicing with colleagues in the office. 
</P>
<P>
Until Kenneth Slade joined the international law firm of Morgan, Lewis &amp; 
Bockius, he thought that "studying languages was something you did in high 
school," he said. But when Slade moved to California from the East Coast a few 
years ago, he found the large Japanese presence here "startling." 
</P>
<P>
"New Yorkers like to think of themselves as the beginning of the country and 
California as the place where the country falls off," he said. "But to the 
Japanese, California is the gateway and New York the backwater." 
</P>
<P>
Now a frequent business traveler to Japan, Slade wants to learn enough Japanese 
to at least show his new clients that "we are interested in them and their 
country." More than a dozen of his colleagues join him at a class offered 
through UCLA extension at the firm's downtown law offices. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Help Them Move Up 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Jannol, a vice president at the downtown Yasuda Trust &amp; Banking Co., 
is taking a Japanese class with about 20 colleagues. Many, he said, hope the 
class will help them move up in the Japanese firm. "I think that learning 
Japanese is an advantage and also demonstrates a greater ability and commitment 
(to the company) on my part," Jannol said. 
</P>
<P>
For free-lance commercial photographer Bruce Ayres of Culver City, who spent 
his teen-age years in Japan, the growing importance of the Japanese language in 
the business world is "like coming full circle," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ayres, 37, is increasingly finding work among Japanese advertising agencies 
that come to California to produce commercials. His plans are to eventually go 
to Tokyo to directly market his work there. In a world growing smaller by the 
day, Ayres said, "We can no longer afford to take the egotistical position of, 
'Let the rest of the world learn English.' " 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year in Washington, a task force of the National Governors' Assn. 
came to a similar conclusion. Addressing the need to make the country more 
competitive in world trade, the task force urged that all college graduates be 
conversant in a second language and that training begin as early as the first 
grade. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Insular Students' 
</P>
<P>
"How are we to sell our products in a global economy when we neglect to learn 
the languages of our customers? How are we to open overseas markets when other 
cultures are only dimly understood? How are our firms to provide international 
leadership when our schools are producing insular students?" asked Gov. Gerald 
L. Baliles of Virginia, chairman of the association. 
</P>
<P>
David Edwards of the Washington-based Joint National Committee for Languages, 
an umbrella organization of foreign language teachers and educational 
associations, said there are several signs already pointing to a shift toward a 
more multilingual society. "We bottomed out in the late '70s," he said "By the 
mid-1980s, we began to see a turnaround." 
</P>
<P>
The signs include: 
</P>
<P>
* More students taking foreign language classes in high school than at any time 
in the previous 70 years. 
</P>
<P>
* For the first time since 1971, more than 1 million college students enrolled 
in classes. 
</P>
<P>
* Enrollment has doubled in several states over the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
* And, among all states, California ranks second only to New York in high 
school foreign language enrollment, showing a 22% increase in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, the California Department of Education published its 
recommendations for foreign language instruction, including a call for schools 
to start training in the early grades. The report has been called unprecedented 
in its forcefulness and is meant to offer guidance for school districts 
throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
The report set a new direction for public school teaching, calling for what 
educators describe as "community-based teaching," an emphasis on speaking a 
language rather than the more traditional method of writing and memorizing 
grammar rules. The approach is already popular among private adult schools such 
as Berlitz. 
</P>
<P>
The state recommendations also promote another new trend in the field known as 
"conservation," calling on schools to help children who already speak foreign 
languages to continue to develop their skills. 
</P>
<P>
"We have this fantastic resource of language in our state," said Adele Martinez 
of the state Department of Education who helped prepare the report. "And the 
need is so urgent and immediate that we have to look at using the resources we 
already have." 
</P>
<P>
Yet despite the momentum in the foreign language field, she said, "changes 
don't happen overnight." 
</P>
<P>
Already there are shortages of teachers and interpreters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demand Outstrips Supply 
</P>
<P>
Despite an exponential growth in the ranks of interpreters in the Los Angeles 
County Superior Court system, the court's demand outstrips the supply. The 
courts are short an average of nearly 10 interpreters each day, said Ed 
Johnson, director of the court's interpreting and translating services. 
</P>
<P>
In 1962, the court employed five full-time interpreters at a cost of about 
$29,000 per year. Today the court -- the largest single employer of 
interpreters in the county -- keeps more than 450 on the payroll at an annual 
cost of $6 million. The interpreters speak about 80 different languages among 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that UCLA's extension program is perhaps the only school in the area 
offering state-accredited interpreter training, Johnson said there is a need 
for more of these programs. Meanwhile, the court's judges are trying to address 
the problem, including instituting an in-house training program of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Another example of the difficulty in meeting the new demand for language 
services can be found in the teaching field. Last year there were 80 Japanese 
language teaching positions available at universities throughout the country, 
but only 15 new doctoral graduates to fill them, said Noriko Akatsuka, a 
professor of Japanese at UCLA. A similar shortage exists this year. 
</P>
<P>
At UCLA, the demand for Japanese classes has more than tripled in recent years, 
with students turned away from full classes, Akatsuka said. At City College, a 
crossroads for many of Los Angeles' ethnic communities, enrollment in language 
courses has almost doubled over the last couple of years to about 2,300 per 
semester, department Chairman Roger Fernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
Most students take the courses to fulfill the state school system's foreign 
language requirement, but the classes also attract those who want to learn a 
language for their job or for more personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese classes have drawn significant numbers of Asian-Americans interested 
in learning their ancestors' language. And other students, such as music 
teacher Barbara Hasty, who recently completed a course in Chinese, are learning 
languages because they want to be able to communicate with members of Los 
Angeles' diverse ethnic communities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Common Ground' 
</P>
<P>
"It creates some common ground," said Hasty, who has numerous Asians among her 
students at East Los Angeles College. 
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Mendoza, chairman of the college's foreign languages department, has 
seen a steady rise in the numbers of Asian students taking his Spanish classes. 
Some are merchants who operate small businesses in the neighborhood and want to 
learn the language of their customers and employees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, other Los Angeles merchants are taking Asian languages to deal with 
local Asian customers. Erik Laykin, vice president of Laykin et Cie., jewelers 
at the I. Magnin downtown store, is learning Korean because, over the last 
decade, the area has come under the growing influence of nearby Koreatown, 
changing the store's clientele. About a third of the store's customers are now 
Korean or other Asians who buy fine jewelry "with a passion," Laykin said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unprecedented Growth 
</P>
<P>
Private language schools, which cater to a post-college clientele, are also 
experiencing unprecedented growth. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. enrollment at the international Berlitz Language Centers, which has 
offices in 26 countries, grew by 37% from 1986 to 1988, said spokeswoman 
Patricia Zse. In California, enrollment jumped 55% in the same period. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the dramatic surge, the United States has a long way to go to match the 
demand in Japan, which remains Berlitz's fastest-growing division worldwide, 
she said. "The Japanese have always been quick to realize that if they're going 
to get ahead, they have to speak English," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Guillermo Frixione opened One-Twelve USA Language Services about four years ago 
in Burbank, hoping to capitalize on the demand for English classes by the 
city's large immigrant population. Long waiting lists for English classes at 
the city school district's adult schools -- which has reached 50,000 at times 
-- show the desire of newly arrived immigrants to learn the language of their 
new homeland. 
</P>
<P>
But though most of his classes started out teaching English, Frixione was 
surprised to find that demand was outstripped by a stronger need for Spanish, 
especially among companies who contract with his firm's job-site program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two-Way Program 
</P>
<P>
Several manufacturing firms with predominantly Spanish-speaking staffs have 
contracted with the firm for a two-way program that provides Spanish classes 
for English-speaking managers while teaching English to workers, Frixione said. 
</P>
<P>
Frixione's clients, like those at most language schools for adults, run the 
gamut from manufacturing plants and service industries, such as hotels with 
largely Latino work forces, to a wide array of public agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Some hospitals, like many public agencies serving Latino communities, still 
depend largely on bilingual staff to interpret for patients. At Bay Harbor 
Hospital, for example, the hospital offers translation services in more than a 
dozen languages through its diverse staff. Nearby Los Angeles Harbor College 
occasionally provides teachers for classes at the hospital on medical 
terminology for Spanish-speakers participating in the hospital's interpreting 
program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increasingly Frustrated 
</P>
<P>
Still, Dr. Richard Goldin, who is affiliated with the hospital, said he became 
increasingly frustrated by his inability to communicate with Spanish-speaking 
patients. "Interpreters are worthless" when it comes to translating the 
vagaries of pain, said Goldin, a specialist in arthritis and rheumatism. 
</P>
<P>
So, when the hospital offered a Spanish class for physicians about three years 
ago, he signed up. 
</P>
<P>
Goldin, who teaches residents at the hospital, said that in his lectures, he 
tells them that in a city with such a large Spanish-speaking population as Los 
Angeles, doctors "owe it to their patients to know their language. . . . You 
can get a . . . lot deeper in a person's skin if you can talk to them."

HOUSE VOTES FOR TOUGHER CHINA CURBS; 
</P>
<P>
PROPOSED SANCTIONS WOULD GO BEYOND BUSH'S MEASURES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite expressions of concern from the Bush Administration, the House voted 
unanimously Thursday for a tough package of economic sanctions against China 
and warned Beijing officials that "the whole world is watching" its suppression 
of human rights. 
</P>
<P>
"Today we send a clear, undivided message to the leaders of China," said House 
Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri. "If you want to rejoin the 
community of nations, stop the killing now. Don't try to rewrite history." 
</P>
<P>
Gephardt commended President Bush for speaking out on the Chinese crackdown but 
added: "Someone in this government has to speak on behalf of the American 
people and take a more forceful stand than the President has been willing to 
take. I believe these amendments can bring change." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Harsh Words for Beijing 
</P>
<P>
In their vote, House members endorsed the economic sanctions that Bush already 
has proposed. But they also called for tougher penalties and couched their 
criticism of Chinese leaders in unusually harsh language. The bill, for 
example, said that China's leaders "ordered an unprovoked, brutal and 
indiscriminate assault on thousands of peaceful and unarmed demonstrators and 
onlookers in Tian An Men Square." 
</P>
<P>
The House amendment would suspend programs that guarantee private investment 
and encourage new trade activity with China. It also would halt peaceful 
nuclear cooperation as well as the export of police equipment, new arms export 
licenses and U.S. space satellites to China. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration previously had suspended military exchanges and high-level 
diplomatic contacts with the Chinese, halted arms sales to China and said it 
would work to block new loans to China by international lending bodies such as 
the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bush Could Lift Curbs 
</P>
<P>
If the new sanctions become law, Bush could lift any of them by asserting that 
such action is required in the "national interest." He also could suspend them 
by finding that China had taken significant steps to correct human rights 
abuses. 
</P>
<P>
The House bill also voiced harsh criticism of Chinese officials for executing 
protesters and demanded that China improve its respect for human rights in 
Tibet, where it has imposed martial law. 
</P>
<P>
The 418-0 vote came as the House completed action on a two-year, $23-billion 
foreign aid bill, which must be approved by the Senate and signed by Bush 
before it becomes law. 
</P>
<P>
Among amendments in the bill that affect U.S. foreign policy, the House 
endorsed a bipartisan measure barring the U.S. government from providing 
military aid to any nation that, by agreement, furnishes aid to the Nicaraguan 
Contras. 
</P>
<P>
And the House voted in favor of $1 billion in U.S. aid for an international 
effort to help the Philippines, rejecting a move to cut the amount by 60%. The 
overall foreign aid bill was approved, 314 to 101. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's vote put the House on a collision course with the Bush 
Administration, which has expressed concern over the proposed sanctions against 
China. Secretary of State James A. Baker III, speaking at a White House 
briefing, said that Bush, not Congress, should determine America's response to 
the volatile situation in China. 
</P>
<P>
"No elected official in the United States of America understands China better 
than the President of the United States," Baker said. "The President has been 
on the right track with regard to his measured response." 
</P>
<P>
Baker also said that the Administration does not believe an emotional response 
will sway Chinese leaders, and he cautioned Congress against acting in the heat 
of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not use inflammatory rhetoric," he said. "If people want us to use 
inflammatory rhetoric, that's fine. They're entitled to have that desire. But 
we do not intend to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Although Baker refused to say whether Bush would veto the legislation, he said 
that the Administration disagrees strongly with several provisions. In 
particular, he quarreled with language that would tie the lifting of U.S. 
sanctions to a correction of human rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
"The principle of human rights . . . has to be a major foundation principle for 
our foreign policy," Baker said. "But it is not the only principle which 
determines our foreign policy. And it cannot be the sole principle which 
determines the . . . degree of the response of the United States in a situation 
such as this." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, Baker and other Administration officials tried to dissuade 
House members from approving tougher sanctions against China. At first, they 
appeared to have persuaded leading Republicans to back the President. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Bipartisan Response 
</P>
<P>
But as debate began on the foreign aid bill, GOP conservatives joined with 
Democrats in fashioning a bipartisan response to the situation in China. In 
doing so, they demonstrated their impatience with Bush's low-key posture. 
</P>
<P>
"I regret that we were not able to get the backing of the Administration," said 
Rep. William S. Broomfield (R-Mich.), the ranking Republican on the House 
Foreign Affairs Committee. "The Chinese leadership should realize that there is 
a very deep-seated revulsion in Congress about the barbarian tactics they have 
employed." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Stephen J. Solarz (D-N.Y.) said that it was necessary to hammer out a 
broad compromise on the issue. Otherwise, House members would have offered a 
flurry of amendments, one more extreme than the next, and there would have been 
no consistent pattern to the legislation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want a China-bashing free-for-all," he said. "That would not have 
been very productive. We knew there was strong sentiment out there to do 
something. . . . There was never a chance of us just doing nothing." 
</P>
<P>
The House, meanwhile, avoided a divisive floor fight by approving the 
legislation banning U.S. military aid to nations that, under an agreement, 
provide military assistance to the Contras. The measure was adopted on a voice 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A WARNING TO CHINA 
</P>
<P>
House Action Thursday 
</P>
<P>
Unanimously voted for a package of economic sanctions. "Today we send a clear, 
undivided message to the leaders of China," said Majority Leader Richard A. 
Gephardt of Missouri. "If you want to rejoin the community of nations, stop the 
killing now." The bill, which must still be approved by the Senate and signed 
by Bush, backs earlier sanctions taken by the President. It also would suspend 
programs that guarantee private investment and encourage new trade with China 
and would halt various exports. 
</P>
<P>
White House Response 
</P>
<P>
Following the House vote, Secretary of State James A. Baker III reiterated that 
the President, not Congress, should determine America's response to the 
situation in China. "No elected official . . . understands China better . . ," 
he said of Bush. "The President has been on the right track with regard to his 
measured response." Baker, who said the Administration does not believe an 
emotional response will sway China's leaders, also cautioned Congress against 
acting in the heat of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier U.S. Sanctions 
</P>
<P>
On June 5, Bush suspended military dealings with China amid cries for a tougher 
response. On June 20, he suspended high-level government exchanges and support 
for loans to China.

EXTENDED VISA OFFER TO CHINESE CALLED 'CATCH-22'; 
</P>
<P>
FEW APPLY FOR PROGRAM THAT CRITICS SAY CUTS OFF OTHER OPTIONS TO REMAIN IN U.S. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly a month after the Bush Administration announced that Chinese nationals 
with expiring visas could stay in the United States for another year, only a 
small number have applied for the program, and some say they will lobby 
Congress for a more generous offer. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese students who are on temporary visas at U.S. college campuses say the 
Administration's offer would force them to return home at a time when danger 
still exists. Those who take part in the program, which allows Chinese 
nationals to remain in the United States until June 5, 1990, are not eligible 
for other visa extensions. 
</P>
<P>
"The program was announced by the Bush Administration as the solution to the 
students' problems," said San Francisco lawyer Edward Lau, who specializes in 
international law and has counseled a number of Chinese students. "But it 
should only be used as a last resort." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a Catch-22," said Yu Maochen, a graduate student at UC Berkeley. "If we 
apply for that, we will lose everything. We will be forced to go home." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service officials in Washington said few 
people have stepped forward to take advantage of the government's offer. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not been inundated with applicants," said INS press officer Duke 
Austin, who, although unable to provide exact figures, said he has heard 
reports from regional INS offices that response to the offer has been poor. 
</P>
<P>
A check with immigration offices across the nation showed San Francisco, which 
has the largest Chinese community in the United States, with 25 applicants. Los 
Angeles reported two, San Diego two, Honolulu one, Washington 15 and 
Philadelphia three. INS officials in New York would say only that the response 
there was "not overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
Immigration officials said they had not expected an early rush of applicants 
because the only ones who would benefit from the program are those whose visas 
will expire in the next year or those who are in the country illegally. 
</P>
<P>
However, INS estimates place the number of people in those categories as high 
as 18,000, or almost 25% of the 73,000 Chinese students, scholars and others in 
this country, Austin said. 
</P>
<P>
Many experts attribute the low response to confusion among the Chinese students 
over how the program works. Some students erroneously fear that signing up for 
the yearlong extension would mean that they forfeit their rights to apply for 
political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
Signing up for the Administration's offer, however, does limit the students' 
options in extending their visas -- either by staying in school or obtaining 
work permits -- because it means they automatically lose their visa status, 
said Stewart Kwoh, executive director of the Los Angeles-based Asian Pacific 
American Legal Center. 
</P>
<P>
Kwoh's organization established a hot line last week to answer visa questions 
of Chinese students and received more than 500 calls in four days. And to help 
the students further, the INS opened up a toll-free hot line Wednesday to 
explain the program's guidelines. The hot line received 91 calls by late 
Thursday afternoon, INS officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's massive confusion about what they should do on their visa status," 
Kwoh said. 
</P>
<P>
Kwoh, Lau and other attorneys are advising students in most cases not to apply 
for the one-year extension in hopes that a better offer will be forthcoming 
from the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers, along with many Chinese students, are rallying around a bill 
introduced in Congress last week by California Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San 
Francisco) that would broaden the government's offer by allowing students on 
exchange visas to stay in this country for a longer time. Most Chinese students 
seeking advanced degrees here have exchange visas that require them to return 
home and work for two years once their schoolwork is completed. 
</P>
<P>
Pelosi's bill would also allow Chinese nationals who already have applied for 
the program a chance to stay here past next June. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a dangerous situation in China right now," Pelosi said. "And we have 
reason to suspect that Chinese officials are maintaining lists of Chinese 
students." 
</P>
<P>
Chinese students from Stanford, Berkeley and colleges throughout the nation, 
such as Harvard and the University of Maryland, have been asking friends to 
lobby members of Congress to support the bill. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 students met at the Berkeley campus last week to set a course of 
action. They plan to launch a letter-writing campaign, and some vowed to 
testify at a congressional hearing for the bill set for July. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Sen. Slade Gorton (R-Wash.) proposed legislation last week 
co-sponsored by 10 senators that would allow all Chinese students to apply for 
permanent residency status immediately, even if they are staying on an exchange 
visa and are supposed to return home. 
</P>
<P>
"The President's proposal only pushes out the stay for Chinese students a 
year," said Gorton's press secretary, Sharon Kanareff. "They need longer than 
that under the circumstances the students face." 
</P>
<P>
The bill does not have as much support from the students, however, because they 
do not necessarily want to apply immediately for permanent residency in the 
United States. They also believe that the Gorton bill might be too drastically 
worded to be enacted into law. 
</P>
<P>
One student who did apply for the government's offer, Huang Shengyu at 
Berkeley, said he took advantage of it because it offered him four additional 
months in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
At the Justice Department, parent agency to the INS, David Runkel, special 
assistant to Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, said the Administration's offer 
"doesn't prohibit further action" at a later date and "takes immediate heat 
off" students and other Chinese who might otherwise be forced to return home 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
At times, the U.S. government has decided to lengthen the period that foreign 
nationals may stay in the United States to avoid political persecution at home, 
Austin said. Ethiopian refugees are still permitted to stay in this country, 
and Polish immigrants who fled their country in 1981 after martial law was 
declared received visa extensions lasting up to five years. 
</P>
<P>
"It (Pelosi's bill) is a rather drastic and dramatic move," said Austin of the 
INS. "If the situation remains the same, the U.S. has extended visa programs. 
It is generally not done at the initial stage of the problem." 
</P>
<P>
But until Chinese students are assured that they might not have to return home 
next year, many will either curtail their activities or maintain a low profile. 
</P>
<P>
"I need this bill passed to take pressure off the students," said Huang, 
noting, "My face is already on the TV many, many times." 
</P>
<P>
"If we know we have a chance at permanent residency, our energy will be 
released immediately," Yu said. "People fear in the meantime that if we do 
anything the (Chinese) government will never forgive us."

FIREFIGHTERS GET HANDLE ON 2 BLAZES

Aided by diminishing winds and cooler air, firefighters began Thursday to 
encircle a 7,500-acre fire in deep brush in the Cleveland National Forest that 
has destroyed seven structures, and they declared the upper hand on a 
3,700-acre fire that burned a house and two barns near the remote Los Angeles 
County community of Elizabeth Lake. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the several hundred Riverside County residents evacuated when the 
Cleveland National Forest fire burned close to the west shore of Lake Elsinore 
were allowed back into their homes Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Late Wednesday, firefighters made what one resident described as a "heroic" 
stand to save dozens of homes, an elementary school and several businesses in 
the Lakeland Village area of Lake Elsinore. Driven by erratic winds, the fire 
advanced quickly on the residential area, but firefighters repelled the flames 
from back yards. 
</P>
<P>
Flames and several large columns of smoke could be seen from Lake Elsinore 
throughout Thursday, but the danger to homes passed as the blaze moved through 
remote canyons north and west of the city of 15,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lost seven structures, but what is important is we've saved hundreds 
more," said U.S. Forest Service spokesman Thomas Horner. 
</P>
<P>
With the fire 40% contained Thursday evening, officials predicted full 
containment by tonight if winds remain calm. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a super day in today getting a line around this," Riverside County Fire 
Engineer Barton Ball said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,900 firefighters from a dozen departments have been battling the 
fire since it erupted Tuesday afternoon in rugged back country near the 
Orange-Riverside county line east of San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze, which originated near a candy and novelty shop in the El Cariso area 
on Ortega Highway (California 74), was not caused by weather or other natural 
acts. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not started by an act of God," Ball said. "It was started by a human." 
</P>
<P>
Ball stopped short of saying it was intentionally set, although officials 
believe that there were witnesses to the igniting of the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
"It may have been a camper discarding smoldering charcoal or a carelessly 
tossed cigarette or match," Ball said. "Or it may have been deliberately set. 
We just don't know. We are still investigating." 
</P>
<P>
Full control was expected by this morning for the smaller fire near Elizabeth 
Lake, a remote community of 2,500 in the foothills west of the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County firefighters said Thursday that the fire was "95% under 
control" after destroying a house and two barns, as well as five vehicles and 
electric power poles and lines. Southern California Edison Co. officials said 
power was restored by 10:30 a.m. Thursday to about 700 customers who were 
without power overnight. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's feeling real good about the way things are going," County Fire 
Deparment spokesman Corey Lovers said. 
</P>
<P>
Charred ground surrounded some homes Thursday, showing how close the fire came 
to causing much greater property loss. Several people praised the efforts of 
firefighters, saying they had fled their homes expecting to return to 
smoldering rubble. 
</P>
<P>
"The closest burn is 10 feet from the house," said Don Simpson, a 23-year 
resident. "Everything around the house is black." 
</P>
<P>
About half a mile away, Velma Majors and her family sifted through what was 
left of the rented home they moved to four years ago to "get away from the 
hustle-bustle" of Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Although the house was razed, Majors recovered an undamaged American flag and a 
porcelain Nativity set handmade by her mother. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wish I had been able to grab some pictures of the house," Majors said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out shortly before 2 p.m. Wednesday just north of the Green 
Valley area and raced northeast through very dry brush, sending up 60-foot 
flames and thick smoke. About 1,500 residents were evacuated from Elizabeth 
Lake and parts of Green Valley and the Leona Valley, but most returned later 
Wednesday evening. Investigators had not yet determined a cause for the fire. 
</P>
<P>
A blaze that burned nearly 100 acres at Sycamore Canyon Park in Claremont on 
Thursday was expected to be under control by early this morning, Los Angeles 
County Fire Department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Several homes near the fire were evacuated, but there were no reports of 
injuries or damage to structures, officials said. About 250 firefighters were 
on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Cause of the blaze was under investigation.

PLAN TO BAR INSURER GIFTS IN COMMISSIONER RACE DEFEATED

In an important indicator of legislative will to reform election campaign 
financing, the Senate on Thursday crushed a bill to prohibit candidates for 
insurance commissioner from taking contributions from the insurance industry. 
</P>
<P>
The state insurance commissioner currently is appointed by the governor. But 
under voter-approved Proposition 103, the post will become an elective office 
starting next year and take on vast new regulatory powers. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), author of the measure, told the Senate 
that it was important to Californians that "this office not be a captive of the 
industry it is to regulate." 
</P>
<P>
However, the proposal flew into a buzz saw of opposition and failed on a 
bipartisan vote of 15 to 19. It needed at least 27 favorable votes. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents charged, among other things, that the bill perpetuated what they said 
is the false notion that legislators and other public officers are "for sale" 
and that such legislation unfairly singled out one office and exempted others. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance companies and their chief political adversaries, personal injury 
lawyers, are among the biggest contributors to election campaigns in 
California. Life, property and casualty insurance interests and trial attorneys 
donated nearly $10 million from 1985 through 1988 alone. 
</P>
<P>
The Hart bill would prohibit insurance companies, agencies and brokerages from 
making contributions to candidates for insurance commissioner. Additionally, 
the insurance commissioner could accept no speaking fees or other "rewards" for 
services rendered. 
</P>
<P>
Individual insurance agents, brokers and lawyers involved in insurance-related 
litigation would, however, be allowed to contribute a maximum $250 to a 
candidate for insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
The fate of the Hart measure had been closely watched as a key indicator of the 
willingness of lawmakers to carry through on repeated promises to take steps to 
remove at least the perception that campaign contributions wielded undue 
influence on officeholders. 
</P>
<P>
Although no one expected legislators to enact reforms that would disadvantage 
themselves, the newly elective office of state insurance commissioner was 
regarded by some reform-minded activists as an ideal clean slate from which to 
start. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sees It as Sale Sign 
</P>
<P>
One leading opponent, Sen. Larry Stirling (R-San Diego), told his Senate 
colleagues that an inaccurate and "unstated premise of this and other measures 
is that you, ladies and gentlemen, are for sale." He termed the bill 
unnecessary and suggested that if the contribution prohibition was extended to 
teachers, for example, they no longer could make political donations to 
candidates for elected education offices. 
</P>
<P>
"Where does this stop?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Where does (reform) start?" Hart shot back. 
</P>
<P>
A supporter of the bill, Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia), argued that "it may be 
that special interests cannot buy the Legislature, but they can paralyze it" as 
the insurance lobbies and trial lawyers did in a couple of years preceding 
passage of the Proposition 103 ballot initiative. 
</P>
<P>
He asserted that an insurance commissioner unburdened by insurance company 
contributions could "balance the interests of the insurance industry and the 
trial lawyers, which we have been unable to do." 
</P>
<P>
Sens. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles) and Dan McCorquodale (D-San Jose) 
suggested that the prohibition should be applied to other elective positions as 
well. "I don't know why this office should be any different than any other 
office that is elective," Rosenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Power of the Office 
</P>
<P>
"We are talking about a regulatory agency and one person who has the power to 
make or break literally thousands of (insurance) companies in California," Hart 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana), chairman of the Senate Insurance Committee, 
noted that the elected commissioner would have an immense amount of regulatory 
power over insurance companies and "obviously those companies are going out to 
do everything they can to elect someone favorable to them and to curry favor." 
</P>
<P>
Robbins has flirted with the idea of running for insurance commissioner himself 
but formally told the Senate on Thursday that "I'm not going to be a candidate 
for insurance commissioner in the election next year." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Roxani Gillespie, the current appointed insurance commissioner 
who is a candidate for the elected office, announced she would accept no 
campaign contributions from the insurance industry.

'PORN ZONING' LAWS TO LIMIT THEATERS UPHELD BY STATE SUPREME COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP HAGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The state Supreme Court on Thursday gave local governments more power to use 
"porn zoning" laws to restrict the location of theaters that show sexually 
explicit movies. 
</P>
<P>
In a widely watched test of municipal authority, the justices rejected a 1981 
appellate court ruling that had prevented officials from enforcing zoning 
restrictions on adult theaters unless a majority of the films shown were 
X-rated. 
</P>
<P>
Under the 1981 ruling, a Long Beach theater had avoided prosecution for zoning 
violations by showing pornographic films on only one of its two screens. 
Frustrated city prosecutors had asked the high court to invalidate the 1981 
decision and allow them to move against the theater for only a single showing 
of an X-rated film. 
</P>
<P>
In their decision Thursday, the justices, seeking to balance free-speech rights 
with a city's interest in curbing blight, adopted a middle course that has been 
approved in other cases by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
The state high court held unanimously that a single showing of such a film was 
not legally sufficient to subject the theater to porn zoning restrictions. But 
on a separate vote of 4 to 3, the court said the city could take action when 
sex movies were shown on a regular basis, accounting for a "substantial 
portion" of either the total films shown or their revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"We give the ordinance a construction that is rationally tailored to support 
its asserted purpose of preventing neighborhood blight without allowing Long 
Beach to use the power to zone as a pretext for suppressing expression," Chief 
Justice Malcolm M. Lucas wrote for the majority. 
</P>
<P>
In her first opinion on the court, newly appointed Justice Joyce L. Kennard, 
joined by Justice Allen E. Broussard, issued a dissent saying the court was 
premature in imposing a new standard on its own and instead should have waited 
to review any new guidelines subsequently enacted by the city. 
</P>
<P>
"A local legislative body is better equipped than this court to determine, in 
light of local conditions, how best to identify those theaters which are likely 
to become a 'blight' on the local community, and to frame a definition which 
local authorities can enforce and which will provide adequate guidance to those 
who wish to comply with the law," Kennard wrote. 
</P>
<P>
In another dissent, Justice Stanley Mosk said the majority had engaged in 
"judicial legislating" without sufficient evidence that its new standard would 
help cities control crime, blight and other adverse effects from adult theaters 
while still protecting the right of free speech. 
</P>
<P>
Gerry L. Ensley, a prosecutor for the city of Long Beach, said the ruling "was 
exactly what we wanted to accomplish." Under the 1981 appellate decision, "porn 
zoning was dead in California," Ensley said. "That ruling was killing us." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's decision also drew praise from a Los Angeles official who said it 
would greatly assist municipalities in controlling the location of a wide range 
of businesses that offer adult entertainment -- including theaters, bookstores, 
arcades and video rental shops. 
</P>
<P>
"This removes a cloud that the (1981) decision had cast on our adult-business 
ordinances," said Los Angeles Assistant City Atty. Claudia McGee Henry. "We are 
very pleased." 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Fleishman of Los Angeles, an attorney for the Lakewood Theater in Long 
Beach, said the new standard for defining adult theaters is impermissibly vague 
and would not adequately preserve the right of free speech. 
</P>
<P>
"These films are protected by the First Amendment and all these zoning laws are 
really based on the false assumption that somehow the people who come into an 
adult theater are different from the rest of us," he said. "But we are all the 
same people. We are all interested in sex." 
</P>
<P>
"Once you say a theater can be placed at a certain location, but a theater that 
shows sex movies cannot be placed there, you have built an ordinance on an 
unconstitutional foundation," Fleishman said. 
</P>
<P>
Barry A. Fisher of Los Angeles, another attorney for the theater, said the 
decision will only lead to more lawsuits. "In the hands of zealous prosecutors, 
it will be abused and that will open the way to further rounds of litigation 
and new court tests," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling came in a 12-year legal fight over a Long Beach ordinance that 
prohibits adult theaters within 1,000 feet of a school or church and within 500 
feet of a residential area. 
</P>
<P>
The concept of using zoning laws to restrict pornography was approved by the 
U.S. Supreme Court in a landmark 1976 ruling. The court said that while such 
enterprises cannot be banned, they can be restricted to certain areas or 
dispersed throughout the community. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, however, municipalities have had trouble drafting ordinances that 
would win court approval. The courts themselves have been divided over 
often-pivotal questions, such as how many sexually explicit films must be shown 
before a theater can be defined as an adult theater. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, a state Court of Appeal, ruling on a Covina ordinance, held that a 
theater must show a "preponderance" or a majority of such films to be subject 
to porn-zoning restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Seven years later, another Court of Appeal, imposing that standard in the Long 
Beach case, upheld a trial judge's finding that the theater owners could not be 
prosecuted because X-rated films were not in predominant use at the twin-screen 
theater. While the theater had shown such explicit movies as "Take My Body" and 
"If Only My Mother Knew" on one screen, only non-pornographic films had been 
shown on the other. 
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's ruling, the high court said the city could not proceed with its 
prosecution of the theater owners because its case had been based on the 
invalid "single-showing" standard. But authorities could prosecute future 
ordinance violations by applying the court's new standard, the justices said. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, in rejecting the 1981 appellate ruling, said the "preponderance" 
standard "violates the spirit" of U.S. Supreme Court rulings upholding the 
right of cities to regulate the location of adult enterprises to protect 
against their secondary impact on neighborhood residents, businesses and 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The state high court's new standard will give cities more flexibility -- but 
still will not allow prosecution for only an "occasional or incidental" X-rated 
movie, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
The justices recognized that their definition was not exact and said that Long 
Beach and other cities could amend their ordinances to further define the 
standard for an adult theater by the actual percentage of films shown or 
revenue received. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas' opinion was joined by Justices Edward A. Panelli, David N. Eagleson and 
Marcus M. Kaufman.

Rebel Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre attended the ordinations of eight new 
traditionalist priestsThursday, one year after he was excommunicated from the 
Roman Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was conducted by Bernard Tissier de Mallerais, one of the four new 
bishops Lefebvre consecrated in 1988 in defiance of papal orders, creating what 
the Vatican said was a historic split in the church. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinations raised to 222 the number of traditionalist priests in 
Lefebvre's St. Pius X Fraternity, according to Bishop Franz Schmidberger, the 
German cleric who succeeded the archbishop.

CUBA FIRES CABINET OFFICER AS DRUG PURGE CONTINUES 
</P>

Cuba's interior minister, the Cabinet officer in charge of domestic law 
enforcement, was fired Thursday as that nation's drug purge continued, but the 
crackdown has failed to touch other leaders who U.S. officials say are involved 
in trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
The minister, Gen. Jose Abrantes, was replaced to allow an investigation to 
proceed into how a group of officers "conducted drug trafficking operations . . 
. with impunity and without being dis covered," a communique issued in Havana 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The firing came two days after a special military tribunal recommended a 
court-martial and death penalty for Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez, who confessed 
to smuggling drugs, ivory and diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
But one member of that tribunal, Vice Adm. Aldo Santamaria Cuadrado, is himself 
under a 1982 U.S. indictment, alleging that he assisted convicted marijuana and 
methaqualone smugglers. 
</P>
<P>
There are other issues that also call the Cuban crackdown into question, 
according to U.S. officials. These include the continued presence of fugitive 
U.S. financier Robert Vesco on the island, accusations that Cuban leader Fidel 
Castro mediated on behalf of the Medellin cocaine cartel of Colombia and 
continued reports of smuggling operations being carried out through Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Selective Crackdown 
</P>
<P>
The selectivity of the Cuban crackdown has led experts here to suggest that 
there were two drug-smuggling operations in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there was a official operation sanctioned by Raul and Fidel Castro, 
and then there was a second private operation by Ochoa, so Fidel and Raul 
decided to clean house," said Jaime Suchlicki, head of the Institute for 
American Studies at the University of Miami and author of a new book on the 
Cuban military. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's firing of Abrantes "is intended to put a wall between Castro and 
Ochoa," Suchlicki said. It is impossible for military-backed drug-smuggling 
operations to continue without the Castro brothers' knowledge, he asserted. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as Sunday, a plane carrying a ton of cocaine passed over Cuba and 
dropped its load in the Bahamas, according to federal officials here. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, U.S. patrols observed the Cuban navy "in the immediate area while an 
actual . . . airdrop, was going on" in Cuban waters, said Coast Guard Lt. Jeff 
Karonis.

DISAPPROVAL OF UNO GROWS, JAPAN POLL FINDS

Japanese Prime Minister Sosuke Uno is facing rising public disapproval in the 
capital for his alleged role in a sex scandal, an opinion poll released 
Thursday indicates. 
</P>
<P>
Support for Uno's administration was as low as 10% in a survey of Tokyo 
residents, while as many as 70% of respondents did not approve of his Cabinet, 
according to Kyodo News Service, which conducted the poll. 
</P>
<P>
Kyodo's telephone survey of 500 eligible voters also showed a serious erosion 
of support for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in next Sunday's Tokyo 
metropolitan election, which is expected to be a benchmark for national voting 
patterns following the convulsions of the Recruit bribery scandal that toppled 
the government of Noboru Takeshita, Uno's predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
While as many as 42% said they had supported the ruling party in the past, only 
13% of the respondents in the Kyodo poll supported it now. That was less than 
the 16% who said they would vote for a Socialist candidate. 
</P>
<P>
The results came just one day after Japanese newspapers reported that Uno was 
on the verge of quitting his post, which he assumed at the beginning of the 
month, because of an escalating scandal over peccadilloes in his private life. 
Women's groups and opposition politicians have reacted with outrage to the 
confessions of a 40-year-old former geisha who accused Uno of paying her for 
sex in a brief affair four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Uno has declined to comment on the kiss-and-tell expose, which was originally 
published in the weekly magazine Sunday Mainichi and gathered credibility in 
the minds of many Japanese only after the foreign news media circulated it 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
It is custom in Japan for the mainstream media to ignore compromising reports 
on the private lives of politicians and public figures -- outside the show 
business industry -- but Uno's position has become increasingly untenable after 
further allegations of extra-marital relations surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
With the news that another prurient report was due to come out today in the 
gossipy, voyeuristic photo magazine Focus, Uno told would-be confidants Tuesday 
night that he was inclined to resign because the sex scandal will undermine his 
credibility at the upcoming Paris economic summit, the major dailies reported 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Utterly Regrettable' 
</P>
<P>
"I find the present development utterly regrettable," the newspaper Yomiuri 
quoted Uno as telling Takami Eto, deputy general secretary of the ruling party. 
"Here I am, staking my life for this country, and commercial magazines continue 
to carry damaging articles on me, preventing me from attending the Paris 
summit." 
</P>
<P>
The Yomiuri quoted an unnamed high-ranking official in the party as saying Uno 
was "highly intoxicated" and therefore not serious when he declared: "I can no 
longer perform as prime minister." 
</P>
<P>
Other reports suggested the prime minister was on the verge of a nervous 
breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
Uno and other government officials quickly denied the reports, which Uno 
dismissed with the word "stupid." 
</P>
<P>
But pundits are still speculating on how long he will remain in office in his 
apparent caretaker capacity. It appears likely that he will continue serving as 
prime minister at least until the Liberal Democrats weather a July 23 election 
in which half the seats in the upper house of Parliament are to be contested. 
</P>
<P>
"Uno is Japan's top political leader. It is bizarre indeed that this man is 
being forced, for personal reasons, to virtually hide from the voting public 
right before important elections," the influential Asahi newspaper said in an 
editorial Thursday. "One can hardly say that Uno is living up to his 
responsibilities as prime minister." 
</P>
<P>
The Asahi summed up the public reaction to Uno's deteriorating position by 
saying, "The great majority of Japanese, including LDP supporters, have become 
disgusted with the whole sordid series of developments."

U.S. CONFIRMS 2 SESSIONS WITH ARAFAT'S NO. 2 AIDE

The Bush Administration, expanding its talks with the Palestine Liberation 
Organization, has held two unannounced meetings with the second-in-command to 
Yasser Arafat, the State Department confirmed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said the purpose was to explore prospects for holding elections 
among the 1.7 million Palestinian Arabs who live under Israeli control on the 
West Bank and in the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
But the secret sessions in Tunis, Tunisia -- one Monday and the other on an 
earlier occasion -- nonetheless touched off a furor among supporters of Israel 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Moshe Arad, Israeli ambassador, called on Assistant Secretary of State John H. 
Kelly to register his government's "regret" and "disappointment." A spokesman 
for Arad said PLO terrorist activity escalated even as the United States 
stepped up its six-month dialogue with Arafat's organization. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Incomprehensible' Action 
</P>
<P>
On Capitol Hill, Sen. Connie Mack (R-Fla.) wrote Secretary of State James A. 
Baker III that "it is incomprehensible to me that the Administration would 
escalate its contacts with the PLO without any consultation with Congress or 
any improvement in PLO behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Mack urged Baker to suspend all contact with the PLO until Congress can "fully 
review this matter in hearings and in appropriate committees." 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate word on the outcome of the meetings between Robert H. 
Pelletreau Jr., the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia, and Salah Khalaf, known also as 
Abu Iyad, who serves as Arafat's security chief. 
</P>
<P>
According to a State Department document, Terrorist Group Profiles, the Fatah 
faction of the PLO, of which Khalaf is a senior official, rejects the 1978 Camp 
David accords, which produced a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Its political objective, the document says, is formation of an independent, 
secular Palestinian state. "Originally committed to recapturing all of 
Palestine, but now (it) may accept a state based on a Gaza-West Bank 
formulation," the description of Fatah said. 
</P>
<P>
A State Department spokesman, Adam Shub, and other U.S. officials said 
Pelletreau's two meetings with Khalaf does not reflect any change in U.S. 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
"Ambassador Pelletreau is our authorized channel for conducting the U.S. 
dialogue with the PLO and as such he may meet with PLO officials," Shub said.

South Korean riot police and radical students battled with tear gas, steel bars 
and rocks Thursday as students demanded that the government lift a ban barring 
them from a youth festival in North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
President Roh Tae Woo said that leftists threaten democracy in South Korea, and 
Unification Minister Lee Hong Koo said the government may postpone planned 
talks with Pyongyang's Communist government. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 students fought riot troops around Seoul's Hanyang University after 
3,000 police sealed off the campus to stop other college students from joining 
the protest. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen students were seen to be injured. One policeman was injured seriously 
when tear gas shells exploded inside an armored van. 
</P>
<P>
In downtown Seoul, about 700 students wanting to get into Hanyang campus 
occupied a major intersection. They fought riot police with firebombs and 
rocks, forcing shoppers to race for shelter. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's march to Pyongyang!" the students shouted, demanding that the government 
allow them to attend a July 1-8 youth festival in North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Seoul says Pyongyang is using the festival to stir up radicals.

MARCOS UNDERGOES KIDNEY OPERATION, SUPPORTERS SAY

Former Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos was taken into surgery Thursday 
for what the exiled leader's supporters said was a kidney operation. 
</P>
<P>
But St. Francis Medical Center spokeswoman Norma Kop declined to comment on the 
nature of the surgery and said she did not know how long it would last. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors had been considering a kidney operation on the critically ill Marcos, 
said Roger Pijuan, an aide to former Philippine First Lady Imelda Marcos. "I 
think they are going to take a chance on repairing his kidney again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The doctors believe the organ could be the source of a persistent infection and 
other problems plaguing Marcos, who has been hospitalized since Jan. 15, Pijuan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A Mass was being held at the hospital chapel when Marcos, 71, was wheeled into 
surgery. Imelda Marcos and daughter, Irene, were both present at the Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Marcos was in a "semi-coma, in and out of consciousness," 
said Pijuan. 
</P>
<P>
The former leader "recognized people, he can open his lips to bite cotton 
soaked with water to wet his mouth," the aide said. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos has been in critical condition in the intensive care unit at St. Francis 
for more than a month and on Wednesday suffered liver failure. He is dependent 
on a respirator to breathe and has been undergoing daily kidney dialysis, 
assistant administrator Eugene Tiwanak said. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos' condition worsened Wednesday as his fever increased, and officials said 
he was unable to recognize family and friends. He also had an irregular cardiac 
rhythm and a rapid heart rate. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime Marcos supporter Joe Lazo said he spent an hour in Marcos' room and, 
speaking with reporters at about 1 a.m. Thursday, said his temperature had 
dropped from 104 degrees to 101.5. Lazo described Marcos as "very, very 
conscious." 
</P>
<P>
"He was trying to whisper to Mrs. Marcos," Lazo said. "Mrs. Marcos asked him to 
hold her hands tightly and he did. Mrs. Marcos was singing for him, directing 
her songs to the right ear of the president and the president was opening his 
eyes to her." 
</P>
<P>
Marcos and his wife, exiled since he was deposed in 1986, have continued to ask 
the Manila government to allow him to return to his homeland to die. The 
government of President Corazon Aquino has refused, saying Marcos' return would 
threaten national security.

SURGEONS REMOVE MARCOS' ONLY FUNCTIONING KIDNEY

Former Philippines President Ferdinand E. Marcos, said to be close to death 
late Thursday, underwent an unscheduled operation for the removal of his only 
functioning kidney. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Ferdinand Marcos was taken to our operating room about 1 p.m. (local time) 
for removal of his transplanted kidney," said a St. Francis Medical Center 
assistant administrator, Eugene Tiwanak. "The surgical procedure, which lasted 
less than one hour, was necessary because of rejection. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Marcos' recovery in our intensive care unit is stable. He remains 
semi-comatose and his condition is critical," Tiwanak said, adding that his 
condition could change rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors described Marcos as reacting to stimuli, but not alert after surgery. 
"He reacts to touch, he may open his eyes, that kind of reaction," Tiwanak 
said, adding that a fully comatose patient would issue only a blank stare. 
</P>
<P>
Before the emergency surgery, a tearful Imelda Marcos had sung a Philippine 
song, "How Much I Love You," to her husband as he lay in a near coma attached 
to a respirator. 
</P>
<P>
"We are praying for a miracle," she said. "If I could just tell him he could go 
back home (to the Philippines) I know this would save him." 
</P>
<P>
The song appeared to win a response from the 71-year-old Marcos, who has 
kidney, heart and lung failure. He opened his eyes and squeezed his wife's 
hand, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Corazon Aquino has refused repeated requests by Marcos, 
who went into exile in Honolulu in February, 1986, to be allowed back home. 
</P>
<P>
"His major organs are virtually shut down and he is being kept alive by 
machines," Tiwanak said earlier. Marcos, who has undergone a series of 
operations, has to be given anti-bacterial drugs. 
</P>
<P>
But Imelda Marcos said Thursday she would not allow her husband to be removed 
from the respirator. "That will be done over my dead body," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Imelda Marcos, who has kept vigil at her husband's bedside with their son 
Ferdinand Jr., was joined at the hospital Thursday by her daughter, Irene 
Araneta, who had flown from California. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos has been ruled too ill to stand trial in New York on U.S. charges of 
stealing $109 million from the Philippine treasury and of defrauding New York 
banks of $165 million. His wife is free on bail on similar charges. 
</P>
<P>
Medical bills are running into hundreds of thousands of dollars, the friends 
said.

RULING SOUTH AFRICA PARTY OKS RACIAL REFORM PLAN 
</P>

<P>
A congress of South Africa's ruling National Party endorsed a five-year plan of 
racial reform Thursday that zealously guards white-minority interests but also 
is intended to serve as the framework for power-sharing negotiations with the 
black majority. 
</P>
<P>
The program was under attack even before the end of the daylong congress. A 
spokeswoman for the outlawed African National Congress said a power-sharing 
proposal giving whites power of veto "doesn't meet our demands," while the 
right-wing Conservative Party called it a "sellout of whites in South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
"To the white electorate I want to give you this assurance," National Party 
leader and presidential heir apparent Frederik W. de Klerk told 1,700 
delegates. "The National Party will never leave you in the lurch." 
</P>
<P>
With a standing ovation, the delegates approved the seven-point "Plan of 
Action" that will guide the party through parliamentary elections in September 
against the Conservative Party and the liberally inclined Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
While stressing that the agenda is wide open for talks with the country's 28 
million blacks, the program is firmly rooted in a commitment to "group rights" 
-- a consistent policy under 41 years of apartheid rule by the party. 
</P>
<P>
The concept is that blacks, whites, Indians and South Africans of mixed race, 
or Coloreds, have the right to govern their own affairs, including segregated 
residential areas and educational facilities. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the plan calls for the abolition of all racial 
discrimination. It envisions creation of a new constitution that brings blacks 
into a legislature for the first time and a Security Council-type body as the 
supreme arbiter of disputes in which each group has veto power. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to follow the typical Westminster type of voting by just 
counting heads and throwing all the votes into one hat," De Klerk told a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
"We need consensus, and concurrent majorities is the foundation of consensus." 
</P>
<P>
The congress also swiftly put the presidency of Pieter W. Botha into the 
archives though he remains in office until September, unanimously endorsing a 
resolution recognizing his "inestimable contribution" during nearly 11 years in 
power. 
</P>
<P>
Botha was conspicuously absent. He refused to attend, and a dinner scheduled to 
have been held in his honor Wednesday night was canceled without explanation.

Reputed mobster and convicted heroin trafficker Gene Gotti went to jail 
Thursday, seven years after he was arrested on charges of running a major 
heroin operation. 
</P>
<P>
With eight minutes to spare before a 10 a.m. deadline set by a judge, Gotti and 
co-defendant John Carneglia -- both wearing nylon jogging suits and sneakers -- 
stepped out of a maroon Lincoln and swaggered into the federal courthouse in 
Brooklyn, where they surrendered to U.S. marshals. 
</P>
<P>
"Afraid we weren't going to show up?" Gotti, the brother of reputed Gambino 
crime family boss John Gotti, joked to his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge John R. Bartels on Wednesday revoked their $1-million bail 
after a three-day hearing, saying both men continued to pose a danger to the 
community, and ordered the pair to await their July 7 sentencing in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors maintained that Gotti and Carneglia continued to traffic in heroin 
and deal in Gambino family affairs after their conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors asked that the two be jailed immediately after the bail hearing in 
U.S. District Court, but Bartels gave them an additional night to be with their 
families.

EX-BUSH FUND-RAISER CHANGES HUD TESTIMONY 
</P>

The chief fund-raiser for President Bush's 1988 campaign changed his previous 
testimony Thursday about how his consulting firm had gotten $392,000 for making 
high-level contacts with officials of the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development during the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
Frederick M. Bush, who is not related to the President, acknowledged much 
closer ties with Deborah Gore Dean, a powerful aide to former HUD Secretary 
Samuel R. Pierce Jr., than he did during a May 25 appearance before House 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Dean, who controlled the allocation of sought-after discretionary grants under 
the moderate rehabilitation low-income housing program, invoked the Fifth 
Amendment privilege against possible self-incrimination when called to testify 
earlier. She has said, however, that she would testify if given access to HUD 
documents and Pierce's personal logs of visitors and telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Admits More Meetings 
</P>
<P>
Bush acknowledged Thursday that rather than seeing Dean only four or five times 
while his company had 13 grant requests pending before HUD as he previously had 
said, he actually met with her on 15 to 18 occasions, including lunches and 
dinners. 
</P>
<P>
He also revised his earlier testimony to concede that he probably had been 
advised indirectly by Hunter Cushing, then a lower-ranking HUD official, to see 
Dean for help on a proposal for a federal rent subsidy that earned him a 
consulting fee of $160,000. 
</P>
<P>
Although Cushing accompanied Dean and Bush to dinners as his guests on two 
occasions, Bush said, the three never discussed HUD business at these "social 
events." 
</P>
<P>
Testifying under oath, Bush said that he never used political influence and, 
despite his leading role in raising funds for the presidential campaign, that 
he has no political clout. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expresses Disbelief 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there is a child over the age of 6 who can believe that," said 
Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), chairman of the House Government Operations 
subcommittee on employment and housing, which called Bush back to the witness 
chair Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was a fund-raiser for vice presidential candidate George Bush in the 1980 
campaign and served as deputy chief of staff to the vice president for two 
years ending in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Other lawmakers were equally skeptical about disclaimers by Frederick Bush, who 
has been nominated by the President to be ambassador to Luxembourg, that he did 
not exert political influence in his contacts with Dean. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to go to the top," Bush said. "We wanted to find out what the procedures 
were." 
</P>
<P>
But Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), protested: "This is the most preposterous 
answer. . . . If you want to mail a letter, do you go to the postmaster? I just 
don't believe you. This was a case of cashing in on political influence." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.), who elicited Bush's revised comments about 
how many times he met with Dean during his efforts to get HUD blessing for 
clients' grant proposals, said: "When you come before us and deny you had 
political influence . . . that defies my sense of logic." 
</P>
<P>
And Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) told Bush: "One gets the feeling you're 
not trying to come clean with the committee." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Well-Prepared 
</P>
<P>
Bush, however, insisted that he was not well-prepared before his May 25 
appearance, but since then had consulted with his former partner, Michael 
Govan, and his business associate, James Nunes, to refresh his recollection. 
</P>
<P>
"I was telling the truth," he shouted at one point in Thursday's hearing when 
his previous testimony was challenged. "I just don't have a good memory." Bush 
said he was personally involved "only in the periphery" of the HUD-related 
projects and his testimony Thursday was sprinkled with such phrases as: "I was 
not the operational person on that" and "It was not even my idea." 
</P>
<P>
He also insisted that his firm deserved to win a $253,000 technical assistance 
grant to help the city of San Juan, Puerto Rico, make the best use of its 
community development block grant, despite reservations by career HUD employees 
about the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that the proposal was rewritten six times to meet criticisms and took 
two years to process through HUD. But Lantos said that the Bush firm won the 
grant in a clear case of political decision-making rather than in a victory on 
the merits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paid $6,000 From San Juan 
</P>
<P>
The firm kept only $50,000 of the sum, Bush said, and paid $203,000 to other 
consulting firms to do most of the work. At the same time, he said, his firm 
was receiving $6,000 from the city of San Juan to represent its interests in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Bush acknowledged that a promotional brochure exaggerated his firm's contacts 
with the White House and its experience in dealing with a half-dozen federal 
departments. He said it was a "fairly gross overstatement." 
</P>
<P>
He defended the document, however, saying: "But this is salesmanship -- we were 
trying to sell ourselves as best we know how." 
</P>
<P>
In a related matter, a congressional panel produced a memorandum on Thursday 
linking a member of George Bush's vice presidential staff to a project that has 
figured in alleged influence-peddling in a federal housing program. 
</P>
<P>
The memo, dated June 10, 1987, was sent from Dean to Tony Benedi, coordinator 
of special projects in the vice president's office. 
</P>
<P>
The memo details more than $2 million in HUD funding to the city of Bayamon, 
Puerto Rico, during fiscal years 1986 and 1987, information Dean provided "per 
your request" to Benedi. 
</P>
<P>
Although no HUD inspector general's investigations at that time involved 
Bayamon, the city had been asked to repay $1 million to the agency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Potentially Dangerous' 
</P>
<P>
"If advance work is handled properly, this should not present a problem, but it 
is potentially dangerous," Dean said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, President Bush said he would accept some responsibility for 
alleged influence-peddling, favoritism and mismanagement in several HUD 
programs while he was vice president in the Ronald Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to assign blame to the vice president for what happened over the 
past . . . eight years, OK, that's fine, I accept it," President Bush said. He 
added that he wanted to make sure there is no recurrence of "cronyism" and 
"special favors" in awarding government contracts.

NASA SELECTS EXPERIMENTS FOR SPACE STATION FREEDOM

NASA has chosen 27 scientific experiments that will examine everything from 
cosmic dust to tropical rain patterns to fly aboard the planned space station 
Freedom, the agency announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said 14 of the experiments will be mounted aboard elements of the 
space station's structure during its construction phase. Thirteen others will 
lay groundwork for more complicated research that will demand greater power and 
data-handling capacity than Freedom is expected to have in its initial stages. 
</P>
<P>
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration hopes to begin building the 
space station in the mid-1990s, beginning with a "man-tended" capability and 
ending with habitable modules to allow full-time operation by an international 
crew of eight or so astronauts. 
</P>
<P>
The station, expected to cost more than $20 billion to build and operate, faces 
budget hurdles in Congress, however, and it is possible construction will be 
stretched out to reduce short-term costs. 
</P>
<P>
A major factor in determining what experiments can be placed on board is 
electrical power. Initial power will come for large solar panels but later NASA 
hopes to add more powerful solar collectors. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the experiments announced Thursday will be housed in the station's 
habitable modules. They are the "Astromag," an ultra-cooled, superconducting 
electromagnet to measure cosmic rays, and the Cosmic Dust Collection Facility, 
designed to capture and record direction and speed of cosmic particles. 
</P>
<P>
The scientific studies selected for Freedom's initial operations phase will 
involve about 130 scientists from government, private industry, universities 
and five foreign nations.

SHAREHOLDERS OK ABANDONING SHOREHAM

Long Island Lighting Co. shareholders have overwhelmingly approved a deal that 
could make Shoreham the first licensed nuclear power plant in the nation to be 
abandoned before coming on line. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement approved Wednesday by 95% of the shareholders calls for the 
utility to sell Shoreham for $1 to the Long Island Power Authority, a state 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, a tentative rate hike schedule was established under which the 
company gets 11 increases over 10 years of about 5% each. The state Public 
Service Commission must approve each increase. 
</P>
<P>
The federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission still must give permission to the 
company to sell the plant and to Long Island Power Authority to dismantle it. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Secretary of Energy W. Henson Moore said the shareholders' vote "is not 
a fatal blow to the Shoreham nuclear power plant, nor is it a fatal blow to the 
energy future for the people of Long Island." Moore vowed to "preserve the 
option of using Shoreham in the future" by trying to thwart the transfer of the 
plant to the state agency. 
</P>
<P>
Long Island Lighting Chairman William Catacosinos told shareholders he doubts 
that the Energy Department can legally block the sale or keep the plant from 
being dismantled. 
</P>
<P>
Energy officials say nuclear power is essential to reducing the country's need 
for imported oil. Long Island Lighting is almost entirely dependent on foreign 
oil. 
</P>
<P>
Shoreham was completed in 1985, 10 years behind schedule, at a cost of $5.5 
billion. It was supposed to cost $261 million. Other plants have been abandoned 
before completion.

PROTEIN FOUND TO HALT BREAST CANCER CELLS

Researchers said Thursday that they had isolated a human protein that in the 
laboratory was found to stop the growth of breast cancer cells without 
affecting other types of human cells. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists said the discovery may mark a significant advance in the search 
for a breast cancer treatment and may ultimately help lead to a strategy for 
prevention of the malignancy, which now strikes one American woman in 10. 
</P>
<P>
A team of University of Michigan scientists led by Dr. Max S. Wicha, writing in 
Friday's Science magazine, said it had isolated a human protein that it 
believes plays a key role in the body's own system for controlling cell growth. 
</P>
<P>
The team has dubbed the protein mammastatin and is now trying to produce it in 
sufficient quantities to test it in laboratory animals and ultimately in 
humans, Wicha said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
"Mammastatin, which is produced by normal breast cells, is a potent inhibitor 
of breast cancer cells growing in the laboratory," Wicha said. 
</P>
<P>
"It specifically stops the growth of breast cancer cells but not cells from 
other tissues." 
</P>
<P>
Wicha said he and his colleagues were now using genetic engineering techniques 
to try to clone the human gene responsible for producing the protein. 
</P>
<P>
Achieving this would enable them to make relatively large amounts of the 
compound in the laboratory, but it may take several years to accomplish this, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 142,000 American women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and an 
estimated 43,000 will die of the disease this year, according to the American 
Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
In normal breast tissue, cell growth appears to be controlled by a balance 
between growth inhibitors and growth stimulators, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
In cancerous tissues, abnormal cell growth may occur because a stimulator 
overpowers its inhibitor, creating an imbalance, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists said they had developed a test to measure mammastatin in blood 
and found it to be present in all women, though at widely varying levels.

A former foreign editor for the Washington Post was named Thursday as ombudsman 
for the Stars &amp; Stripes military newspapers, a post created in response to 
allegations of censorship. 
</P>
<P>
Philip M. Foisie was executive editor of the International Herald Tribune after 
spending 26 years at the Washington Post, including a long stint as foreign 
editor. He is credited with originating the ombudsman position at the Post. 
</P>
<P>
Foisie's job will be to monitor the journalistic performance of the newspapers 
and to argue with military brass over news coverage and decisions on behalf of 
reporters and editors. 
</P>
<P>
He also will be able to write a column, spotlighting errors or discussing the 
manner in which news judgments are made. Foisie will be paid about $70,000 a 
year, the Pentagon said. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters who have worked for the papers say they must walk a tightrope between 
reporting the news and satisfying military commanders who are worried about 
sensitivities in the host country.

BROWN ASSAILS BUSH PLAN AS 'FAT CAT' AID

Democratic National Committee Chairman Ron Brown denounced President Bush's 
campaign finance reform proposals Thursday as the "fat cat protection act of 
1989" as he sought to regain control over what traditionally has been a 
Democratic issue. 
</P>
<P>
Brown called for partial public funding of House and Senate races and for the 
setting of spending ceilings on these contests. In a sharp reversal of past 
partisan roles, Brown found himself defending political action committees as a 
Republican president was calling for the elimination of corporate, union and 
trade association PACs. 
</P>
<P>
If "you eliminate PACs, you eliminate the opportunity of a lot of small donors 
to contribute effectively to a campaign," Brown said Thursday after a speech to 
the Center for National Policy. 
</P>
<P>
Seven years ago, it was GOP leaders who made this argument: PACs provide "a 
wonderful service in offering new opportunities for people to participate in 
the political process," Republican Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota declared in 
June, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said he would support some limits on the amount of money that labor, 
corporate and trade association PACs can give.

An American who beat his elderly employer to death with a whiskey bottle while 
the two were on a cruise ship near here was sentenced Thursday to life 
imprisonment on a reduced charge of second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Frisbee, 62, will not be eligible for parole for 10 years, the minimum 
for second-degree murder, the British Columbia Court of Appeal ruled. 
</P>
<P>
Frisbee was convicted in January, 1987, of first-degree murder and sentenced to 
life without eligibility for parole for 25 years in the slaying of Muriel 
Barnett, 80, of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
At Frisbee's trial, the British Columbia Supreme Court judge did not give the 
jury "adequate direction on the question of whether there was proof of planning 
and deliberation as distinct from intent," Appeal Court Justice W.E. Esson 
wrote in reducing the charge. 
</P>
<P>
Barnett's body was found Aug. 19, 1985, in the $2,000-a-day stateroom she 
shared with Frisbee, her traveling companion. Prosecutors argued that Frisbee 
killed Barnett because she was going to cut him out of her $3.7-million will.

BUSINESS GROUP HITS TAX HIKE IN COMPROMISE HIGHWAY PLAN

A coalition of business groups threatened to pull its support for a 
9-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax increase Thursday as committees in both 
legislative houses endorsed a transportation compromise that included the tax 
hike. 
</P>
<P>
The mammoth spending plan to upgrade and expand the state's highway and mass 
transit systems had been hammered out during weeks of negotiations between Gov. 
George Deukmejian and the legislative leadership. It was approved 
overwhelmingly during a quick series of meetings of five Senate and Assembly 
transportation and fiscal committees. 
</P>
<P>
It is scheduled to go to the floor of both houses today but cannot go into 
effect unless voters approve a proposal for modifying the state's spending 
limit in June, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5-Cent Hike Urged 
</P>
<P>
As the committees were voting on the transportation plan Thursday, a coalition 
of business, labor and medical groups known as Project 90 was continuing to 
press lawmakers to scale back the gasoline tax increase proposal to 5 cents per 
gallon. 
</P>
<P>
"Our polling indicates that there is some doubt about a 9-cent gasoline tax 
increase," said Duane Dauner, president of the California Assn. of Hospitals 
and Health Systems and a leader of Project 90. 
</P>
<P>
Until the polling, Dauner said, the group had intended to endorse the 
legislative proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Dauner said the organization may consider proposing a competing initiative if 
members decide after a meeting next week that the Legislature's plan for 
modifying the spending limit and increasing the gasoline tax is not "salable" 
to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Project 90 was organized to propose changes in the spending limit after passage 
last November of Proposition 98, a measure which dictates that 40% of the state 
budget and the lion's share of any surplus revenue must be allocated to public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
An annoyed Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), chairman of the Assembly Transportation 
Committee and an author of the proposal, predicted that lawmakers would stick 
with the 9-cent proposal, anticipating that a statewide campaign will persuade 
voters of the need for the full tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
"I just think that (Project 90 members) are wrong," he said. "I think that they 
have no faith in the voters. I think that they have no backbone. I believe that 
if we make the case with the public about what's happening in California, the 
needs of California, the fact that this is written so people will know what the 
benefits are, that people will vote for the program." 
</P>
<P>
The improvement plan pumps $18.5 billion into the state's transportation system 
over the next decade to relieve congestion and improve deteriorating highways. 
It raises money for the program by a gasoline tax hike, a 54% increase in truck 
weight fees and a $3-billion bond issue to expand rail transit systems. Voters 
would be asked to approve $1 billion of the bond issue in June, 1990, another 
$1 billion in November, 1992, and the final $1 billion in November, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for an initial 5-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax increase to go 
into effect in August, 1990. It is followed by 1-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax 
increases for each of the next four years. A separate measure tied to the 
compromise and approved by the committees would allow the Department of 
Transportation to authorize the construction of four private toll road projects 
in the state. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a tender compromise and we've done it . . . because without this plan 
we're going to have more pollution and more congestion," Assemblyman William P. 
Baker (R-Danville) said.

2 DEUKMEJIAN ADVISERS LEAVING PROP. 65 PANEL

Two of Gov. George Deukmejian's scientific advisers who helped shape 
implementation of Proposition 65 will step down from their posts amid charges 
that they favored the chemical industry, state officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Wendell Kilgore, who is under investigation for a possible violation of ethics 
laws while serving as a federal scientific expert, will leave his post as 
chairman of the governor's Proposition 65 scientific advisory panel. 
</P>
<P>
Warner North, a vocal member of the panel who has done extensive consulting 
work for industry groups, will also step down from his post. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists, who often have been at odds with the panel's decisions, said 
they were pleased to see the duo leave and called on the governor to replace 
them with scientists who have no ties with businesses affected by the 
anti-toxics law. 
</P>
<P>
"The governor needs to replace them with people who are free from pro-industry 
bias or an economic self-interest in the issues that come before the panel," 
said Al Meyerhoff, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council. "The 
cloud that has been hanging over the panel needs to be removed, and trust in 
the panel needs to be restored." 
</P>
<P>
Kilgore has been under investigation by the Environmental Protection Agency's 
inspector general for possibly violating federal ethics laws when he testified 
about the pesticide dinoseb on behalf of the Northwest Food Processors Assn. 
His testimony in an Oregon trial came shortly after he had left the EPA's 
scientific advisory panel, in which he advised the federal government on the 
same chemical. 
</P>
<P>
Under federal law, it is illegal for an employee who has worked on a specific 
issue for a federal agency to act as an agent for an outside business or group 
on the same subject. 
</P>
<P>
Kilgore could not be reached for comment, but his attorney, Peter A. Nowinsky, 
said the UC Davis toxicology professor did not violate federal law. Kilgore 
believes that the EPA was attempting to "gag him" and interfere with his 
ability to speak his mind on toxics issues, according to Nowinsky. 
</P>
<P>
Kilgore decided to leave his state post because of the controversy over the 
federal investigation and the Deukmejian Administration's failure to defend him 
against his critics, the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
"You're left with a man who feels he has given freely of his uniquely 
well-qualified service and credentials and has been treated abysmally in 
return," Nowinsky said. 
</P>
<P>
The one-year terms of both Kilgore and North were set to expire today. Both 
sent letters to the Administration requesting that they not be reappointed. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, North said his consulting work and his service on the EPA's 
scientific advisory panel did not leave him sufficient time to continue serving 
on the state panel. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, North has come under criticism from environmentalists for doing 
consulting work for such groups as the Chemical Manufacturers Assn., Chevron 
Oil and Monsanto while serving on the state panel.

PENALTY FOR POSSESSION OF CHILD PORNOGRAPHY OKD BY ASSEMBLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Possession of child pornography would be a crime under legislation passed 
overwhelmingly by the Assembly on Thursday and sent to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Approved on a 62-2 vote, the bill by Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los 
Angeles) would apply to the possession of any matter depicting a person under 
the age of 14 engaging in or simulating sexual conduct. 
</P>
<P>
The offense could be prosecuted as either a misdemeanor or a felony and would 
be punishable by up to three years in state prison and a $5,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the only way we can stop the harm that is being done to children," 
said Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), co-author of the bill. "This 
should dry up demand for child pornographers because they can't sell 
(pornography) if no one is willing to take the risk of possessing it." 
</P>
<P>
Although several statutes outlaw production, selling, distribution and 
advertisement of pornography involving children under the age of 17, mere 
possession of the material is not now against the law. 
</P>
<P>
Polanco sought to make possession a crime last year, but his bill failed in 
committee in the face of opposition from civil libertarians. This year, the 
measure was changed to more clearly separate child pornography from pornography 
picturing adults, which is legal. 
</P>
<P>
The age at which a youth could be considered the subject of child pornography 
was lowered from 17 to 14 in the possession bill. And, unlike last year's bill, 
the current version would require prosecutors to prove the "knowing possession" 
of child pornography to obtain a conviction. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would apply to developed or undeveloped film, negatives, photocopies, 
filmstrips, slides and videotapes. It would exclude drawings, figurines, 
statues or any film rated by the Motion Picture Assn. of America. It would not 
be necessary to prove that the matter is obscene to establish a violation. 
</P>
<P>
The bill is sponsored by the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles and by the 
Los Angeles county counsel's and Los Angeles city attorney's offices. 
</P>
<P>
The only opposition to the measure came from Assemblymen Terry B. Friedman 
(D-Los Angeles) and John Burton (D-San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
Burton said the bill would establish a "dangerous precedent" by making 
possession of written or pictured material a criminal offense.

<P>
FOR THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
An article Friday on a bill to outlaw the possession of child pornography 
incorrectly stated that Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles) was one 
of two Assembly members to vote against the bill. Friedman did not vote on that 
measure. Assemblymen John Burton (D-San Francisco) and Robert J. Campbell 
(D-Richmond) were the two who voted against it.

WEALTHY, INFLUENTIAL CATHOLICS INTERRED IN ORNATE MAUSOLEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. WELKOS, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He came to pay his last respects Thursday to Cardinal Timothy Manning, but 
before he did, Teolor (Sonny) Atangan walked up the stairway into the ornate 
and stately mausoleum chapel at Calvary Cemetery in East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Atangan gazed at the gated crypts on each side of the chapel, rooms of polished 
marble and chiseled stone that are the final resting places for some of the 
wealthiest and most influential members of the Roman Catholic Church in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In one crypt just to the left of the chapel altar are entombed Manning's five 
predecessors dating back to the 1800s. McIntyre. Cantwell. Conaty. Amat. Mora. 
</P>
<P>
Had Manning chosen, he too could have made this room his final resting place. 
But he wanted to be laid to rest in another section of the cemetery, in a 
simple grave alongside his fellow priests. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're rich, you get a place like this," said Atangan, a 39-year-old Los 
Angeles Catholic, who was taking his two sisters visiting from the Philippines 
on a quick tour of the mausoleum, which overlooks the oldest cemetery in the 
Los Angeles archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
Looking at one crypt, Atangan said: "They must feel they weren't able to 
complete everything in life as a person . . . and in their last moments before 
death they wanted people to like them." 
</P>
<P>
In a grotto of polished red marble located across the chapel from the bishops 
are Edward and Carrie Estelle Doheny. He was the mighty oil tycoon who died in 
1935 and whose family has a street and a state beach named in its honor. She 
was a philanthropist and collector of rare books -- including a Gutenberg Bible 
-- and was named a papal countess for her contributions to the church before 
her death in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pink Carnations 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, freshly picked pink carnations decorated the front of their tombs. 
</P>
<P>
Near the Dohenys is the final resting place of Father William Ward, who died in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
"William Ward, he was her executor and was very powerful in that regard," said 
Jerry Milanez, a Los Angeles Catholic who also decided to make a quick tour of 
the mausoleum before attending Manning's burial. "He was her confidant and 
adviser. They contributed millions and millions to the church." 
</P>
<P>
Adjacent to the bishops' crypts is one reserved for Los Angeles oilman Daniel 
Murphy and his heirs. Entombed here is his adopted daughter, Bernardine, who 
died in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Also a Papal Countess 
</P>
<P>
Like Carrie Estelle Doheny, Murphy's daughter was made a papal countess in her 
lifetime by the Pope and contributed heavily to Catholic churches, schools and 
hospitals. Because of her generosity, the archdiocese renamed St. John Vianney 
High School in Los Angeles Daniel Murphy High School. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood film legends, brothers John and Lionel Barrymore, also are entombed 
near the chapel. 
</P>
<P>
Chiseled into the white marble of John Barrymore's vault are words from Hamlet: 
"Good Night Sweet Prince." Above them is the year "1942." 
</P>
<P>
"He was too vain to put the year he was born," said Milanez, who then glanced 
up at Lionel Barrymore's vault, which has no dates on it. 
</P>
<P>
"They were actors," Milanez said. "You know how actors are."

A REAL LIFE 'WEST SIDE STORY' ON THE STREETS OF LA VERNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jason and Yolanda fell in love last February. 
</P>
<P>
He was an 18-year-old high school dropout and former neo-Nazi "skinhead" 
working the counter at a fast-food outlet in La Verne. 
</P>
<P>
Then Yolanda walked in, a pretty girl of just 15 with a frizzy mane of teased 
hair looking for part-time work, something to distance her from the street gang 
that, despite her protests, still considered her one of its own. 
</P>
<P>
Jason trained her to ring up sales and take food orders from customers. One 
month later they were living together with Yolanda's mother in a humble house 
by the railroad tracks that pass through this San Gabriel Valley city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Barrio Gang 
</P>
<P>
But members of the 1st and B Street Boys, a small barrio gang that Yolanda has 
tried to flee, have not given their blessing to the budding cross-cultural 
romance. Bristling at the sight of an Anglo youth with a Latino girl, they have 
hurled bottles and epithets and threats. They have made so much trouble for the 
pair, in fact, that Jason and Yolanda's affair has now become a regular entry 
in the La Verne police log. 
</P>
<P>
Officers -- who have likened the romance to a street-gang version of Romeo and 
Juliet -- are so concerned that someone might get badly hurt that on Tuesday 
night a patrol car was cruising past the couple's house every few minutes. On 
Wednesday, Jason was given a police escort while driving in and out of town. 
And on Thursday, charges of prowling were filed against four of five youths 
suspected of pounding on the windows of the couple's house two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
In all, officers have made 10 arrests of gang members in the neighborhood this 
month for a range of misdemeanors against the couple, including prowling, 
inciting a fight and hurling an object at a car. 
</P>
<P>
"What it comes down to is that this couple has got two choices," said an 
official in the district attorney's office who asked not to be identified. 
"They can wait for somebody to try to kill them or they can move." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Midnight Assault 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Jason and Yolanda, who are engaged to be married, had been 
awakened about midnight by five gang members who surrounded the house, pounding 
violently on the window screens. Jason, who has been made muscular by a new job 
as a gardener, grabbed the aluminum baseball bat that he keeps by the bed and 
called the police, who arrived before there was a confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
But the gang did not relent. 
</P>
<P>
"Watch your back, white boy," one of them shouted to Jason last Friday after 
spotting the couple driving through town. Bolstered by at least three other 
gang members with him, the youth spat out the window toward the couple, hurled 
a beer bottle that sailed over Jason's car and warned: "We're going to get you 
for taking our home girl away." 
</P>
<P>
Police say the 1st and B Street Boys, also known as La Verne Rifa, or La Verne 
Rules, is the only gang in this city of 30,000, a bedroom community 45 minutes 
from Los Angeles. They form an occasionally violent, multi-generational family 
of about 15 to 25 active members whose history can be traced to the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll stand up to them," said Jason Mavers, talking earlier this week at the 
couple's home, where a flower arrangement wrapped in cellophane, some photos of 
Yolanda and a small wooden cross decorate the living room. "I'm not going to 
run from anybody. Nothing's going to keep us apart." 
</P>
<P>
Yolanda, whose mother asked that her last name not be used, is hiding for now 
at a relative's house. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm kind of scared for Jason," said Yolanda, a sophomore in high school with 
dreams of attending beauty school. "But I tell him not to worry about it -- 
just think about us." 
</P>
<P>
Not that Jason or Yolanda have any pretensions of glamour. 
</P>
<P>
A big night out means hopping in Jason's purple '55 Volkswagen bug, driving to 
Hollywood, grabbing a Big Mac and cuddling in a movie theater. For their 
one-month anniversary, they went for the first time to Magic Mountain where 
Jason won Yolanda a giant black teddy bear that nearly dwarfed her. Later, he 
had "Yol" tattooed on his chest. 
</P>
<P>
"She's the best," Jason said. "If it weren't for her, I don't think I would be 
able to handle something like this." 
</P>
<P>
Jason, a lanky youth with huge blue eyes, was born in West Germany while his 
father was stationed at a U.S. military base, and grew up in East Los Angeles, 
where, at 13, he joined a group of guys with shaved heads who called themselves 
the Nazis of L.A. He wore a Mohawk haircut and patrolled the streets in 
steel-toed boots. 
</P>
<P>
"We were kind of like a neighborhood watch," he said. "I thought being in a 
gang would change things. I guess I thought I was a man." 
</P>
<P>
But he says he never sympathized with the group's bigotry and abandoned them 
after a few years when they shot and wounded a black friend of his. He then 
moved to Pomona with his mother and began high school, but dropped out just two 
months before graduation. 
</P>
<P>
"I just said, 'The hell with everything,' " said Jason, whose hope is to 
someday work as an auto mechanic on big diesel rigs. 
</P>
<P>
Yolanda grew up in La Verne, around the corner from the house where her mother, 
a 34-year-old unemployed secretary, also grew up. By 11, she had her first of a 
half dozen or so tattoos -- including one on her chest naming an old boyfriend 
-- and had already begun befriending the gang members on her street. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to be popular and hang out with a cool crowd," she said. "I wanted to 
feel a part of something." 
</P>
<P>
But she, too, grew repulsed by the violence she witnessed and says last summer 
she stopped spending time with the gang. Her mother says that Yolanda is mature 
for her age, although some of that was earned the hard way -- an abusive 
father, easy access to drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I still think they're both just kids," her mother said about the 
young couple. "But if I don't allow it, I know she'll just run off with him. 
So, I just tell her, if that's what you want, fine." 
</P>
<P>
It is not, however, an arrangement that the 1st and B Street Boys are so 
willing to accept. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, another member of the gang approached the couple at their front door 
and allegedly told Jason that he was going to "end up in the hospital or some 
place worse." He was arrested Wednesday and remains in custody. 
</P>
<P>
And of the four gang members arrested in the bottle-throwing incident, only 
one, a 16-year-old, has been charged with hurling the object and provoking a 
fight. All four have been released from custody. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, it does sort of harken back to the Montagues and Capulets or a 'West 
Side Story' kind of thing," said La Verne Police Sgt. John P. Hackworth. "We 
have had incidents where people are harassed by gang members, but not with this 
kind of twist to it." 
</P>
<P>
Jason and Yolanda, who say their plight has brought them even closer together, 
are not yet ready to run. 
</P>
<P>
"I love her," said Jason. "We're not going to let nobody bother us."

INQUIRY, CITY PROBLEMS CAST PALL OVER BRADLEY INAUGURAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY, Times City-County Bureau Chief 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After Mayor Tom Bradley is sworn in for a historic fifth term today, he faces 
the job of solving a huge list of municipal problems while his personal 
finances are under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
A glum mood caused by the twin negatives of city troubles and the Bradley 
inquiry were reflected in interviews with city officials, who voiced 
uncertainty over the mayor's future and growing impatience with the city's 
ability to deal with traffic, housing shortages, waste disposal, crime and 
social tension. 
</P>
<P>
Red and white bunting being nailed onto the City Hall inaugural rostrum 
Thursday, and workers preparing for a party on the building's lawn tonight, 
showed the effort the city Administration was making to put a festive face on 
the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
But the scheduled presence on the inaugural stand of two of the officials 
investigating Bradley, and who will also be sworn in, was evidence of the 
troubles confronting the man who will become Los Angeles' first five-term 
mayor. They are City Atty. James K. Hahn and Controller Rick Tuttle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deep Concern 
</P>
<P>
The interviews revealed deep concern over the ability of not only the mayor, 
but city government as a whole, to chip away at the troubles facing a city 
confronting the challenges and pain of great economic growth accompanied by a 
growing population of the poor. Lack of affordable housing, poor air quality 
and clogged streets and freeways are drawing more and more complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor's office sees itself as making policy but it is not set up to make 
things happen," said Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter. 
</P>
<P>
Then, expressing a deeper frustration felt by officeholders, she added, "The 
city is organized in a way so that nobody is in charge and each of us, in our 
own unique way, is helpless." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's supporters said they hope the mayor will take command of the day with 
a forward looking speech that will focus the city's attention on Bradley 
solutions, rather than Bradley troubles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Set Tone 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Mayor Mike Gage said the mayor's speech will "set a tenor or tone" 
rather than offer up a long list of specifics. 
</P>
<P>
Will the mayor discuss the investigations? "I am not sure how to answer that 
without telling you what is in the speech," said Gage, keeping the address 
under wraps. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn is conducting the major probe, touched off by revelations in the press 
that Bradley was paid for serving on the Board of Directors of Valley Federal 
Savings &amp; Loan Assn. and on the Board of Advisers of Far East National 
Bank, financial institutions that had business dealings with the city. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation, Hahn said, will take "some time" to complete. "We keep 
finding new directions that should be explored," he said. "We want to be fair 
to the mayor. He has been mayor for 16 years, up to now with an unblemished 
record." 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle said his office is moving ahead with its audit of the Africa Task Force, 
a city-funded organization promoting trade with African nations. It is headed 
by a business associate of the mayor's. Tuttle is also examining the city 
treasurer's office, which deposited city funds in the Far East National Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Until the city attorney's investigation is complete, Bradley will continue to 
have a "hard struggle," said City Councilman Marvin Braude, a political ally of 
the mayor's. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Report's Consequences 
</P>
<P>
"The consequences of that (report) nobody can predict," he said. "I think it is 
important for this to be resolved, no matter what the consequences." 
</P>
<P>
The uneasy wait was making political leaders nervous. 
</P>
<P>
Aware that their constituents are demanding action, some have begun to work on 
programs of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn, a potential candidate for mayor in four years, said he has been holding 
meetings of developers and leaders of poor communities to try to find ways of 
building more low-rent housing in a city with a diminishing supply of 
inexpensive apartments and a growing number of luxury dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley has been trying to find ways of building more low cost housing, without 
much success. His major plan calls for increasing the amount of revenue 
available from downtown city redevelopment projects and using it for housing 
construction. But that effort has been tied up in court and in disputes over 
the future of redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think enough is being done," Hahn said. "I really think we are in a 
housing crisis, and a lot of people are not that far away from ending up in the 
streets." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Environmental Concerns 
</P>
<P>
Galanter expressed concern over the Administration's ability to implement its 
environmental programs, particularly a highly touted recycling effort. "They 
don't have anyone who knows how to do it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The discontent may surface in the City Council after the legislative body 
reorganizes next week. 
</P>
<P>
The council selects its president Wednesday and Councilman John Ferraro, who 
ran against Bradley in 1985, is expected to be reelected. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in two weeks, he will appoint the heads of revamped committees. From 
those committees may come initiatives prompted by the politicians' impatience 
with City Hall inaction.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 1,000 RUSH TO APPLY FOR TEACHING JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A crush of more than 1,000 prospective teachers lined up for teaching jobs in 
the Los Angeles Unified School District this week. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Acosta, who oversees teacher recruiting, said applications have been 
particularly heavy. The major reason for the rush, he said, is that "now school 
is out, so people from other districts are applying." Large numbers of recent 
college graduates also are beginning to apply, he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,900 applications have been received since recruiting began in May, 
which may be slightly higher than average, he said. But the district normally 
interviews 7,000 to 8,000 applicants during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
More teachers from neighboring districts are applying for jobs, and some have 
reported being enticed by the higher salaries Los Angeles teachers won after a 
strike in May, Acosta said. 
</P>
<P>
Starting July 1, beginning teachers will earn $27,346, compared with $23,440 
last year. The maximum salary will rise to $47,675 from $40,871. 
</P>
<P>
The district has 2,000 vacancies, particularly in the areas of elementary, 
bilingual, special education, mathematics and science instruction. So far 850 
new teachers have been hired, Acosta said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: VICTIM FINDS ALLEGED ATTACKERS AT HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A taxi driver who was kidnaped, robbed and beaten by four people arrived at a 
Santa Monica emergency room to find two of his alleged attackers, one of whom 
was being treated. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw them I was very happy, because now the police could catch them," 
said Eshetu Bahiru, a 39-year-old Ethiopian emigre. "They almost killed me." 
</P>
<P>
Bahiru spotted the men early Wednesday when a Santa Monica police officer 
escorted him to the Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center, where one of the 
suspects was receiving treatment for a gunshot wound to the ankle. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Bahiru had just broken out of the trunk of his cab, where his 
assailants had left him, several blocks away. The escape ended a three-hour 
ordeal that began about 9:30 p.m. Tuesday in downtown Los Angeles, said Malibu 
Sheriff's Sgt. James Kagy. 
</P>
<P>
Bahiru took three men and a 17-year-old girl to Topanga Canyon, where two of 
the men pulled guns, beat Bahiru over the head, and took his money and jewelry, 
said Kagy. They then tied and gagged him, before driving toward Los Angeles and 
locking him in the trunk. They abandoned the cab about 12:45 a.m. a few blocks 
from the hospital.

Police said David Castellon, 22, a transient, and the teen-ager, whose name was 
withheld because of her age, were arrested for investigation of armed robbery, 
kidnaping and auto theft.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUIT SEEKS TO BLOCK SLOW-GROWTH LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A high-powered coalition of Pasadena community leaders and organizations, 
including the Urban League and the Chamber of Commerce, has filed suit to block 
a slow-growth initiative passed by voters in March. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed Thursday in Pasadena Superior Court, charges that the ordinance 
would restrict the housing supply, preventing low-income buyers from finding 
homes. The initiative violates federal fair-housing laws, impedes interstate 
commerce and conflicts with state legislation, charged attorney Carolyn 
Carlburg. 
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by a rising tide of slow-growth sentiment, Proposition 2 won approval 
from 57.2% of the voters in an election that had a 10.9% turnout. Coalition 
members said Tuesday that the new law excludes minorities and the poor from the 
Pasadena housing market.

JUDGE RULES FOR CAFE IN SUIT OVER BREAST-FEEDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

A Beverly Hills restaurant did not violate a woman's civil rights when a 
hostess asked her to either breast-feed her child discreetly, or do so in the 
restroom, a Los Angeles judge has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
In a suit filed five years ago against Cafe Rodeo, Nicole Kaufman alleged she 
was not given the option of discreetly breast-feeding her infant at her table. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Richard Wells ruled Wednesday in favor of the restaurant, 
which maintained that it had done so. 
</P>
<P>
"The restaurant's policy -- a continuing policy -- is that if a woman goes into 
the restaurant and she is breast-feeding but is discreet about it, we have no 
problem," Aaron Shelden, the attorney representing the restaurant, said 
Thursday. He added that the ruling was a vindication of the restaurant's 
position. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Gloria Allred, representing Kaufman, a graphics artist, blasted the 
court's decision as "anti-mother and anti-child." 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Thursday to announce plans to appeal Wells' decision, 
Allred said she will seek a broader ruling to prohibit all restaurants from 
"banning" breast-feeding mothers from their dining rooms. 
</P>
<P>
"Breast-feeding is not a crime," the attorney said. "Is the restaurant going to 
argue next that there should be separate lunch counters for breast-feeding 
mothers and infants, such as blacks were subjected to in the South in the '50s? 
</P>
<P>
". . . Breast-feeding mothers and their babies should not have to be banned to 
Devil's Island, or to a restroom, because they have chosen the most important 
form of bonding that can exist between a mother and child." 
</P>
<P>
Allred contended that the trial evidence -- including testimony of a woman who 
stated that two years ago she also was banned to the Cafe Rodeo's restroom to 
breast-feed her child -- demonstrated that, in reality, the restaurant had a 
policy limiting breast-feeding to the women's restroom. 
</P>
<P>
The witness, Bonnie Shuster, told reporters at Thursday's press conference that 
her breast was "completely covered" by a large shirt at the restaurant when she 
was asked to go to the ladies' room. 
</P>
<P>
"So why should the court believe . . . the restaurant?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging the conflicting evidence, Wells noted in his ruling that the 
burden of proof rested with the plaintiff. 
</P>
<P>
But he was apparently unswayed by evidence presented by the plaintiff's 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
In his decision, Wells said that even if the restaurant employee failed to give 
Kaufman the option of breast-feeding discreetly, "such failure was an oversight 
and did not constitute discrimination" under the law. 
</P>
<P>
The judge added that, even if, as Shuster testified, she was not allowed to 
discreetly breast-feed at the table, "this might constitute a single violation" 
but "does not establish a pattern. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Several Los Angeles-area restaurateurs told The Times earlier this week that 
they have no objection to women breast-feeding in their establishments. 
</P>
<P>
Shelden insisted that his clients, the owners and management of Cafe Rodeo, do 
not object either. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe this whole thing has just been blown all out of proportion," the 
lawyer said.

KILLING OF 2 AGED CHURCHGOERS PROVES BAFFLING 
</P>

<P>
In a whisper tinged with urgency, 81-year-old Nina Reynolds asked a special 
favor of her pastor at the conclusion of a church service in Pomona the Sunday 
before last. 
</P>
<P>
"She asked me to pray for her sister, who was going into the hospital for 
surgery," recalled Pastor Ray Watts of the New Gethsemane Church of God in 
Christ, "and to pray for her own health (she walked with the aid of a cane), so 
she could continue taking care of her sister." 
</P>
<P>
The following Sunday, a day before her 78-year-old sister's leg was to be 
amputated in surgery related to an advanced case of diabetes, relatives found 
Reynolds and her brother, Henry Williams, 88, bludgeoned to death in their 
bedrooms in the modest stucco home they shared. 
</P>
<P>
"They think she was reading the Bible when it happened," Watts said, "because 
they found a Bible beside her body." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a Los Angeles County coroner's autopsy determined that Reynolds 
died of "multiple injuries due to blunt force," spokesman Robert Dambacher 
said. Williams' body was to be autopsied today. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona police still have no motive or suspects in what appears to have been a 
burglary-homicide that has stunned friends and relatives of the victims -- both 
devout Christians, who literally lived for each other and their 450-member 
congregation. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm shocked. She was very sweet, very God-fearing," said church member Lena 
Smith. "Henry was a spry, friendly man, given to telling jokes." 
</P>
<P>
Evidence collected in the home on West 11th Street, including fingerprints, 
suggests that someone forced their way into the home through a bathroom window 
between 7 p.m. Saturday and early Sunday morning, Police Sgt. Elias Valdez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"There did not appear to be a violent struggle at the location, because there 
wasn't a great deal of furniture strewn about," Valdez said. 
</P>
<P>
Nor were any large items taken from the residence, he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the sergeant added, "they (Reynolds and Williams) kept small amounts 
of money in the house." 
</P>
<P>
"But where they kept it and how much they had, we don't know yet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds' closest relatives declined to talk about the case. But church leaders 
said Reynolds moved to Pomona from Texas in 1962 with her late husband, Fred, 
in order to be closer to their 40 grandchildren. About five years ago, 
Reynolds' sister and brother moved into the residence, which is surrounded with 
fruit trees, flower beds and grapevines. 
</P>
<P>
At home, they spent most days watching Christian TV, reading the Scriptures or 
hosting prayer meetings, church leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
At church, Reynolds held a special chair reserved for respected elders 
frequently called upon to "give counsel" to young families. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very hard to understand. Things like this happen for reasons beyond us," 
said Ruth Allen, a close friend of Reynolds for many years. "But one blessed 
thing we know beyond a shadow of doubt is that she went to live with the Lord." 
</P>
<P>
"We're just looking for spiritual guidance and a lifting of saddened hearts 
knowing they do not have to live in a world like this anymore," added church 
member Mary Hodge. "It's a tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
Because their own church is being refurbished, funeral services for the victims 
will be held at 9 a.m. Saturday at Mt. Sinai Church of God in Christ in Pomona.

Egghead Discount Software: The Issaquah, Wash., computer software retail chain 
said it lost $12.1 million during fiscal 1989, contrasted with a profit of $4.6 
million the previous year. However, sales jumped 70% to $342.4 million. The 
company said the principal factors behind the losses were fourth-quarter 
writedowns totaling $11.8 million, a change in an accounting method that 
increased expenses by $4.5 million and additional reserves for future 
writedowns of $4.1 million.

Circle K Corp.: The Phoenix-based convenience store operator reported that net 
income plunged 75% to $15.4 million for fiscal 1989. Revenue totaled $3.5 
billion, up 31%. The results include an after-tax gain of about $19.1 million 
from the disposition of assets. The company said grocery gross margins 
continued to decline during the fourth quarter as a result of industry 
pressures and inventory adjustments and that it experienced increases in 
operating expenses due to higher interest costs and depreciation related to the 
recent acquisitions of more than 1,000 stores and new store construction.

You can't pull the wool over Bob Barker's eyes. When the longtime host of "The 
Price Is Right" was asked to make promotional spots with Vanna White in 
connection with "Wheel of Fortune's" upcoming daytime move from NBC to CBS, he 
initially declined. Barker, a staunch animal rights activist, remembered that 
White has been photographed wearing fur coats and that "Wheel" has given fur 
coats as prizes. "CBS knows how I feel about furs," Barker said Thursday, 
explaining that he finally agreed to do the promos after the network assured 
him that there will be no more fur coats on the daytime "Wheel of Fortune." 
Added Barker: "There is no reason for a woman to wear a fur coat. The only 
reason she does is to demonstrate her affluence. She can just pin money to a 
cloth coat and accomplish the same thing." "Wheel" moves to CBS on July 17 and 
will be the lead-in show for "Price Is Right." ALEENE MACMINN

South African officials in New York have expressed outrage over the new 
cops-and-robbers film "Lethal Weapon II," which they perceive as showing 
Pretorian consular officials as "drug-smuggling, sadistic thugs." Paul Bryant, 
vice-consul for the Republic of South Africa in New York, charged that the film 
is part of a Hollywood trend trying to promote "the villainization of South 
Africa in films. . . . In the film industry, all of a sudden Cuba and the 
Soviet Union are the good boys. Now they cast around for another country as a 
villain, and they've picked us," he said. Warner Bros. vice president Rob 
Friedman responded that the movie was not an all-encompassing denunciation of 
South African consular activity. "It happens to be fictional. . . . 'Lethal 
Weapon II' is not a documentary." The film stars Mel Gibson and Danny Glover as 
wise-cracking Los Angeles detectives, and the principal villain is a South 
African diplomat. It opens next Friday. ALEENE MACMINN

Jim Hill, said to be the highest paid local sportscaster, has had his duties 
cut at KABC-TV Channel 7. Beginning July 10, Hill, who has nearly two years 
left on his reported $800,000-a-year contract, will no longer report sports on 
the station's 11 p.m. newscasts. Todd Donoho, formerly a sports personality on 
the FNN/Score cable network and currently a sports announcer for the ABC-owned 
radio station KLOS-FM, will assume Hill's late-night duties. Hill, who spent 12 
years reporting sports for KCBS-TV Channel 2 before moving to KABC two years 
ago, will continue to anchor sports on the station's early newscasts and its 
Sunday night "Sportscene." Meanwhile, KABC has hired former KCBS and KNBC 
weatherman Kevin O'Connell to handle the weather reports on its weekend 
newscasts.ALEENE MACMINN

Actress Amy Irving has filed for divorce from film-maker Steven Spielberg. The 
Superior Court petition cites irreconcilable differences in requesting an end 
to the 3 1/2-year marriage. Spielberg and Irving announced their intention to 
divorce in April. Irving's petition said a written agreement has disposed of 
the couple's property. She seeks child support and joint custody of the 
couple's 4-year-old son, Max. The couple were married in November, 1985, in 
Santa Fe, N.M. ALEENE MACMINN

I CANTORI AT PASADENA PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Given the limitations of the hall and other technical shortcomings, a concert 
by the vocal ensemble I Cantori at Pasadena Presbyterian Church managed to 
offer some quality music making. Singing with conviction and insight, the 
eight-person mixed chorus presented a large, diverse collection of American 
vocal works from the 20th Century, giving intelligent attention to each work. 
</P>
<P>
Five songs by Charles Ives, arranged for the group by conductor and founder 
Edward Cansino, yielded the best results. Use of props and other theatrical 
elements propelled the humor and flavor of the texts, most of them by Ives 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the presentations Wednesday night resisted an easy temptation for 
corniness, thoughtfully projecting Ives' sophisticated, sometimes eccentric 
view of popular Americana. Flutist Lisa Edelstein fittingly supplied a part 
originally for fife on the piccolo. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, a Suite from "Treemonisha" by Scott Joplin became a theatrical 
presentation with dancing, sequined skimmers for the men and feather boas for 
the women. The toe-tapping, ragtime songs joyfully set the joint a-jumpin' 
although at times pianist Lorna Eder and percussionist Timm Boatman had a hard 
time synchronizing with the ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
Giving them a different kind of a challenge, two pieces for extended vocal 
techniques by Joan La Barbara -- arranged for I Cantori by the composer -- 
produced varied results. The better of the two, "Time(d) Trials and Unscheduled 
Events," cleverly satirizes the running events of the 1984 Olympics, for which 
it was written, with pantings, coughs, grunts and groans carefully composed 
into a fugue of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
And there was a world premiere, Cansino's eclectic quodlibet "Design." Familiar 
vocal pieces throughout history are layered together sometimes cacophonously, 
other times with simplicity. A reflective text by Marcel Proust attempts to tie 
the piece together, but falls short of giving the work a clear purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Solo efforts included a set of chilling atonal songs by George Rochberg with 
mezzo Sondra Stowe spellbindingly bringing out all the grotesque images and 
obsessions in short texts by Rochberg's late son. 
</P>
<P>
But the intricacies of George Crumb's "Madrigals, Book II," sung by soprano 
Diane Thomas were lost due mostly to the boomy hall, but also a general lack of 
energy. GREGG WAGER

Painter Robin Ryan shows large acrylic-on-aper portraits that look like life 
embellished by imagination. Huge, sketchy faces and seated nudes such as "He 
Sits, He Waits" take up most of the picture space and look like shadows 
embedded behind a colorful gridding. Ryan uses half-inch tape to create a neat 
field of vertical and horizontal cross hatching, then peels away tape and fills 
in the resulting little squares with variegated color that makes the huge 
countenance in "Cold Streak" look as if it coalesces from many small pockets of 
pigment. She also shows computer-generated faces or digital paintings limned 
directly on the computer screen, then transferred to an enlarged, paper-printed 
format. What draws our attention here is the uniqueness of Ryan's techniques; 
the amateurish imagery itself -- except for the electric eroticism of "The 
Lovers" -- fails to hold our attention. (Ivey/Kaufman Gallery, 154 N. La Brea

Prints from Roy Lichtenstein's "Brushstroke Figure Series" are Pop art 
renderings of Abstract Expressionist paint swipes that wind up being faintly 
representational. They are fun loving, art-smart prints that toy with the 
language of mechanical Cubism, Surrealism and the comic strip while pushing 
hard on the technical end too. Each is a composite of lithograph, woodcut, 
screen print and encaustic. The multiple media give Lichtenstein's trademark 
screen print dots and cartoony brush strokes a genuine richness of surface that 
further stretches the work into a self parody about what looks smart and what 
looks like art. (Glenn-Dash Gallery, 962 N. La Brea Ave., to July 15.) SUVAN

New York artist Anna Bialobroda makes painting into theater. In her dark and 
brooding glimpses from the aisle, the cast is playing to an empty house. 
</P>
<P>
Each of Bialobroda's paintings catch both a portion of endless rows of vacant 
seats and a piece of the illuminated stage or screen. In the most powerful 
images the movie screen forms a flat white ground where huge black and white 
faces stare out silently into the glowing, empty depths of the movie house. The 
canvases are long narrow verticals that compress the pieces of screen and 
seating into a tight edge of stacked fragments that frustrate depth and scale. 
The work also gives the sensation of peering though a crack in a door, adding a 
clandestine feeling to the theater's emptiness. 
</P>
<P>
Less challenging are paintings where appropriated images by Van Gogh and 
Rembrandt are collaged onto large movie screens and lightly blended in with 
colored paint. Without the shifts in scale or Bialobroda's weird fragmentation 
the self portraits amid empty seats go static. 
</P>
<P>
That can't be said about "Spectacle" or "Bluff," two deftly painted 
investigations into the psychological vulnerability of the artist/performer. As 
Bialobroda shifts the viewer from balcony to orchestra, she firmly grasps a 
performer's sense of being at risk from a predatory audience. But surprisingly 
she makes that realization seem rooted in the viewer's psyche, not the 
artist's. (Saxon-Lee Gallery, 7525 Beverly Blvd., to July 29.)SUVAN GEER

There's been a rash of so-called biomorphic abstraction that makes fine art of 
those cellular spores or slowly scooting tendrils we see under a microscope or 
in a molecular model. When this art is good it can, without stooping to 
sentimentality, refer to universal mysteries like entropy, regeneration, the 
mathematical order that dictates the minutest and grandest of natural systems. 
When it's bad it can look like first-year-of-graduate-school, 
what-am-I-going-to-paint. 
</P>
<P>
Far from amateur and well exhibited in many states, Tom Savage shows large 
paintings that fall somewhere between those extremes. Savage builds amorphous, 
mostly pastel fields from coats of oil wash, then fills them with shapes that 
look like the DNA helix or organic pods beaded like pearls on a string and 
suspended in a chalky mist. In his strongest canvas, he sends spindly organisms 
floating in a reddish primordial goop and shapes snap to life from the bold use 
of color. More often than not, a decorative lilac palette and anemically 
drafted squiggles leave you feeling you can't quite hold on to any of it.

CHAPO: HATS OFF TO FRANCO-MEDITERRANEAN TASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chapo is a perfectly logical spelling of the French word for hat, which the 
French don't happen to use. And there actually is a hat at Chapo Restaurant, a 
derby perched on the end of a ceiling beam. That's Chapo for you: a little 
eccentric, but neat. 
</P>
<P>
The owners used to have a restaurant in Belgium called the Curiosity, and 
actually I suspect the hat is a little fun they're having with the excessive 
neatness of the Belgians. Belgium is a country where guests invited to dinner 
at 7 p.m. arrive at 6:50 or so and stand outside the door without knocking 
until the very second of the hour. I know such a practice would drive me to 
sticking a derby on a rafter. 
</P>
<P>
Foodwise, there's not much that reflects Belgium, though. Certainly Chapo knows 
its endives; the Caesar salad is a tile pattern of endive leaves, each 
containing a little mustardy sauce and some Parmesan (down at the bottom, there 
are some romaine leaves to throw us off). The mussel soup, made with 
particularly good mussels in a cream and sherry broth, might be a Belgian dish. 
</P>
<P>
The basic style of the place, though, is Franco-Mediterranean with a definite 
personal accent. With the bread, in place of butter, comes a bowl of olive oil 
flavored with basil. The French fries (called "Curiosity fries," referring to 
the Belgian restaurant) are made from waxy potatoes and flavored with rosemary 
and red pepper. 
</P>
<P>
There are pastas and such, but a lot of what's going on here is quite classic 
French. The wonderful smoked salmon comes with a toasted brioche. Lamb 
garnished with small white beans in garlicky lamb stock is agneau a la 
bretonne, and the pork in a sauce of mustard, cream and meat juices could come 
straight from Normandy. 
</P>
<P>
But the place seems nouvelle/California at the same time. Nothing could be more 
nouvelle/California than a sandwich of goat cheese and chicken thigh meat with 
romaine lettuce and grilled prosciutto. (It does slide around a little on the 
good chewy French bread.) There's a three-mushroom salad with balsamic vinegar, 
and a field salad with toasted pine nuts scattered over it. There's also 
grilled ahi and black-and-white fettuccine with seafood, which happen to be the 
only uninteresting dishes I've had here. 
</P>
<P>
But the restaurant ventures into areas where nobody around here has really gone 
yet. Our relentless California eclecticism only rarely plays with the 
possibilities of Moroccan food, but one night Chapo had a special of a "spicy 
lamb sausage" with sweet peppers that was certainly Provencale/North African. 
And nothing anywhere is quite like the osso buco with ginger risotto. Yes, 
ginger risotto, rich with meat juices and glowing with ginger. It's probably 
the best single thing on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
The desserts are European or American, however, and uniformly excellent. They 
can be as simple as a lemon cake ("like a really good birthday cake," as 
someone put it) or a chocolate pecan pie with caramel sauce, or as elaborate as 
an apple tart with a lattice crust that is itself topped with a layer of 
paper-thin apple slices in apricot glaze. The best might be the incredibly 
creamy cheesecake. 
</P>
<P>
This is a great little place. I guess my hat's off to it. 
</P>

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: 3RD TIME AROUND FOR A KATSU RESTAURANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH REICHL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What do you call your third restaurant when it happens to be on 3rd Street? If 
you're Katsu, you call it Katsu Third, 8636 W. 3rd St., West Hollywood, (213) 
273-3605. And if you're Katsu, you also make it look more like a gallery than a 
restaurant, filling up the white space with interesting angles, recessed light 
and very good art. If you're Katsu, you also make the menu totally different 
than the one offered at the original Katsu (mainly sushi), or that served at 
Cafe Katsu (French inspired). This time you put out chopsticks, balancing them 
artfully atop green chiles, and you offer appetizers such as a terrine made of 
scallops, halibut and eel (not, it should be noted, the easiest item to eat 
with chopsticks), or a cream cheese terrine (even harder to eat with 
chopsticks) or shrimp salad. You offer entrees that range from chicken tempura 
to wiener schnitzel and beef tenderloin at prices that are mostly in the 
mid-teens. You add a few desserts, a nice little wine list and very pleasant 
service. 
</P>
<P>
And then you might take the time to congratulate yourself for putting your 
third restaurant on a stretch of 3rd Street that is turning into quite a little 
restaurant row. RUTH REICHL

MOVABLE FEASTS: A FOOD COACH'S EXERCISE IN HEALTHY EATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By L.N. HALLIBURTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have just bitten into a stuffed red bell pepper that is so healthy it is 
positively leaking Vitamin C. Inside the pepper are 250 calories full of brown 
rice, ground turkey and a tomato sauce so clean it seems scrubbed behind the 
ears. I figure all this virtue is costing about $1 dollar a bite. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at it this way," says a friend visiting from New York. "Think of what 
you're saving. The Golden Door would cost you $3,500 plus gas." 
</P>
<P>
We're saving on the gas here. Definitely. Yolanda Bergman -- the "food coach" 
to Carrie Fisher, Kate Jackson, Ozzy Osbourne and other assorted celebrities -- 
comes to you. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes she'll arrive with oat bran waffles, low-fat pizza, grilled orange 
teriyaki chicken, barbecued scallops, berry tarts . . . or, at the very least, 
a large empty bag. 
</P>
<P>
Bergman, the former ballerina and Jane Fonda instructor who likes to be called 
just "Yolanda," will make a clean sweep of a kitchen and fill it with lean, 
healthy food (no fats, sugar, additives, caffeine, cholesterol, red meat, salt, 
MSG . . .). Many of her clients place weekly orders for precisely the sort of 
food you'd find at a spa. A week's worth of Yolanda's "The Perfect Food" meals 
runs between $200 and $250. 
</P>
<P>
I dig into the marinated grilled vegetables, a gorgeous mound (65 calories, 
$7.95) of smoky tri-colored peppers, whole mushrooms, slabs of zucchini and 
yellow squash, fat eggplant discs. It is bursting with flavor, crisp, juicy and 
amazingly fresh. I could get used to this. 
</P>
<P>
My New York friend is on the telephone. "How much does a live-in cook run these 
days?" He writes down the facts. "Really? From three-fifty to seven-fifty a 
week." 
</P>
<P>
He hangs up and announces, "We're saving money." Indeed. Two little bell 
peppers are $17.50, tomorrow's turkey meat loaf is $15.95 for two, the roast 
turkey breast is $17.95, and that small package of mixed wild and brown rice is 
$6.50. 
</P>
<P>
"What about that $10 delivery charge?" I ask. "If you have to ask prices . . . 
," he says. 
</P>
<P>
If you have to ask prices then you probably won't have your fridge bursting at 
the seams with Yolanda's microwaveable packages. But since she happily delivers 
individual meals -- $35 minimum -- with eight hours' notice, you might order a 
week of light lunches -- or have a supper now and then. 
</P>
<P>
Yolanda's food is comparable to the meals served at the best American spas -- 
with one plus: The portions are normal, not Lilliputian. (Ozzy Osbourne 
wouldn't stand for doll-sized meals.) While the muffins are gummy, the barbecue 
sauce (no sugar or honey) is a pale trace of the real thing. But the low-cal 
lasagna (plenty of fresh tomatoes, tofu and spinach) is nothing that a little 
cheese and salt wouldn't rev up, and the entrees tend to be so delightfully 
fresh (and, gosh, cheerful) you'd think they were farmed and cooked five 
minutes before. 
</P>
<P>
"I could imagine coming home to this after a hard day at the studio," said my 
pal tasting the grilled lime chicken. It is 138 calories per portion, tender 
and served with a flirty little red salsa -- I could enjoy it again too. 
Likewise the sweet, juicy roast turkey fashioned with a thin green mustard 
sauce. Even the low-calorie garlic herb salad dressing, usually, by its very 
nature, execrable, is sparkling. (It's 6 calories per tablespoon and $7 for a 
small jar.) 
</P>
<P>
The next night we're eating the fluffy turkey meat loaf woven with onions, 
carrots and zucchini. The no-oil tomato topping is even fluffier. It's exactly 
the kind of food that tastes great when you've been at a spa for five days. 
Even now, it's pretty good -- but why am I up hunting down the tamari sauce? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why," says my friend who stopped smoking two years ago, "but this 
meal makes me want to have a cigarette." 
</P>
<P>
 Yolanda's, (213) 657-3821. Call for delivery information. $35 minimum order, 
$10 delivery charge. Eight hours' notice required. American Express, 
MasterCard, Visa and checks accepted. Entrees: $6.95-$25.50.

STYLE: TODAY, CUBIC ZIRCONIA IS A GIRL'S BEST FRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EVAN CUMMINGS, Evan Cummings is a free-lance writer. This is her second 
piece for Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carol Andreson wants every woman to feel rich and beautiful. Her line of 
costume jewelry -- called Rich &amp; Beautiful -- apparently helps them do just 
that because it has been enjoying brisk sales to men and women from all walks 
of life. 
</P>
<P>
"Fabulous fakes" is what she calls her line of cubic zirconia and simulated 
gems -- rubies, emeralds and sapphires. 
</P>
<P>
The former actress is also a registered nurse who actually played a continuing 
role as a nurse on the old "Dr. Kildare" television series starring Richard 
Chamberlain. 
</P>
<P>
Her Huntington Beach waterfront condominium is filled with mementos of her days 
as an ingenue, including studio photographs from movie scenes opposite Dean 
Martin, Frank Sinatra and Jerry Lewis. Although she speaks fondly of those 
days, she insists that she has found the next best thing. 
</P>
<P>
The glamorous blonde imports her line of cubic zirconia and other simulated 
gems from Switzerland and West Germany and travels to Hong Kong once a year to 
purchase fine jewelry -- fresh water and cultured pearls and an assortment of 
Cloisonne beads, bracelets and assorted objets d'art. 
</P>
<P>
Cubic zirconia, she explains, has improved dramatically during the past few 
years, so much so that it would take an expert to tell the difference between 
real and fake jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
"Many celebrities like Elizabeth Taylor and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis are 
known to wear fake duplicates, while their real jewelry is stored away in a 
vault," Andreson says, adding that many wealthy women in Orange County also 
wear fakes. 
</P>
<P>
While many people buy fake gems because of the skyrocketing insurance rates on 
the real thing, there are those like Eve Thompson, the wife of a Seal Beach 
physician, who say they simply prefer the faux jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it," she says. "I have complete peace of mind. I don't have to worry 
about robberies or losing an earring. And, when you wear the right clothes and 
act the part, no one can really tell the difference." 
</P>
<P>
Andreson's roster of happy clients includes female executives who want to look 
successful and young couples starting out who cannot yet afford the genuine 
article. She said many couples buy the bride's wedding ring with CZs with the 
plan to replace them in a few years, with the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
Cubic zirconia is a generic name (the stones are marketed under more than two 
dozen trademarks) and quality can vary greatly with each source. Typically, a 
pair of one karat CZ stud earrings costs about $40. A CZ version of the popular 
tennis bracelet fashioned from individually cut stones and set in a 14-karat 
channel setting is priced at about $750. Actresses Linda Evans and Joan Collins 
wore custom-designed CZs on the hit show "Dynasty," and Andreson carries a 
copycat version in her line. 
</P>
<P>
She offers the following tips when choosing faux jewelry: Look for brilliance 
and clarity; each stone should be individually cut; and set in 14-karat gold, 
sterling silver or vermeil, and should come with a written guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
Andreson arranges for private showings at the homes of her clients and in fine 
hotels like the Ritz-Carlton in Dana Point. She frequently donates her time to 
charity by arranging fashion jewelry shows for groups such as the Orange County 
Medical Assn. and the Soroptimists of Newport Beach. Recently she produced a 
special show to benefit the Huntington Beach Library.

Florence Griffith Joyner, who caused a sensation with her fashion creations in 
track and field, will design new uniforms for the Indiana Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
Flo-Jo dazzled the sporting world with the one-legged body suits and 
brilliantly colored outfits she wore during the U.S. Olympic trials at 
Indianapolis. She set world records in the 100- and 200-meter dashes in 1988 
and won gold medals at Seoul in those events and the 400 relay. 
</P>
<P>
"We made an agreement that what looks good on Florence won't necessarily look 
good on Greg Dreiling and LaSalle Thompson," said Donnie Walsh, the Pacer's 
president at a press conference in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith Joyner said she already has come up with about 13 designs for Walsh to 
review. The new uniforms will not be used until the 1990-91 season, after the 
league has had a chance to display them in its merchandise catalogues.

DOW DIVE OF 46 IS BIGGEST IN 3 MONTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN PETERSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market took its steepest plunge in three months Thursday, with 
recession anxiety spreading to Wall Street as bonds and the dollar finished 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 46.47 points to close at 2,458.27, a day 
after a key official barometer suggested that a U.S. economic slowdown might be 
under way. The stock market plunge followed a 21.63-point drop on Wednesday and 
was its sharpest decline since March 17. 
</P>
<P>
"Private investors are thinking that a recession may be more likely than they 
perceived earlier in the year," said Harold C. Nathan, a vice president and 
portfolio manager with Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The jitters come during a time in which it has been hard to tell the bad 
economic news from the good. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to stocks, bond prices rallied Thursday, as investors looked 
forward to lower interest rates in a cooling economy. The dollar also gained 
against other national currencies, despite rising interest rates in Europe that 
ordinarily would undermine the value of dollar-denominated investments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recession Fears 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, investors have been upbeat about economic prospects in light of 
forecasts that a slump could be avoided, especially if inflation remains under 
control. But the psychology affecting stocks turned gloomier with Wednesday's 
release of the government's index of leading economic indicators. The gauge for 
May took its worst dive since November, 1987. It was the third decline in the 
last four months. 
</P>
<P>
"People are starting to think that maybe we're not going to have a soft 
landing, maybe we're going to have a recession," said Eric McCluskey, a 
research associate with the investment firm of Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards 
Inc. in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as last Friday, news that orders for durable goods such as cars and 
equipment fell in May was greeted as a happy sign that interest rates would 
fall, but with little economic damage. On that day the Dow Jones average shot 
up 49.7 points. 
</P>
<P>
But Wednesday's release of the leading indicators -- documenting a sweeping 
fall-off in money supply, consumer confidence, orders for consumer goods and 
other measures of economic health -- seemed to take a toll on the confidence of 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Fear of recession "definitely carried over from yesterday," McCluskey said of 
Thursday's stock nose dive. 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Stock Exchange Thursday, declines led advances 1,319 to 263 on 
volume of 167,100,000 shares, up from 158,470,000 shares Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to fears of an economic slump, some analysts said the stock market 
was affected by a wave of institutional investors seeking to cash in profits at 
the end of the quarter, a gambit known as "window-dressing." 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of institutional selling going on," McCluskey said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Stevens, chief investment officer for Wilshire Asset Management in Santa 
Monica, attributed the stock market's wild swings in recent days to doubts 
about which way the economy is headed. In such a climate, he maintained, 
uncertain investors are more likely to react in a stampede with each new 
economic indicator, even though no single statistic can be expected to reveal 
what the future holds. 
</P>
<P>
"I think investors would rather have a consensus of recession or a consensus of 
growth," Stevens said. "That would tell them what to do." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, losers among the blue chips included International Business 
Machines, down 2 3/8 at 111 1/2; General Electric, down 1 at 52 3/8; USX, down 
7/8 at 34 3/4; Eastman Kodak, down 1 3/8 at 47 5/8, and American Telephone 
&amp; Telegraph, down 5/8 at 35 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Banc One, which won the bidding to acquire the failed banks formerly operated 
by MCorp, led the active list, up 4 7/8 at 32 7/8. Amdahl, the most active 
American Stock Exchange issue, fell 3 1/2 to 16 5/8. By contrast, L.A. Gear 
rose 2 1/2 to 60. The footwear company posted sharply higher quarterly profits 
and said its order backlog continued to increase.

One-Year T-Bill Rates Plunge: The Treasury sold $9.0 billion of the 52-week 
T-bills at an average discount rate of 7.58%, down from 8.18% at the last 
comparable auction on June 1. The rates were the lowest since Oct. 20, 1988, 
when the one-year bills sold for 7.57%. The new discount rate understates the 
actual return to investors -- 8.16% with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,233.60.

U.S. MAY CANCEL UP TO $1 BILLION OF AFRICAN DEBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration is considering canceling as much as $1 billion in debt 
owed to the United States by poor sub-Saharan African countries as part of a 
package to be unveiled during the annual seven-nation economic summit in Paris 
on July 15 and 16. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, still under discussion within the Administration and with 
congressional leaders, would affect the debt that these countries owe under 
various U.S. foreign aid programs. Washington either would forgive the debts 
entirely or allow the countries to repay in local currencies. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said the ultimate size of total debt forgiveness would depend 
largely on the formula that the White House works out with Congress on how to 
count the writeoffs in the federal budget. Strategists for President Bush want 
an advance agreement to avert any misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
However, Administration planners said the proposal could provide as much as $1 
billion in total debt reduction from the $4.5 billion that these countries owe 
the United States. The bulk of Africa's debt is owed to governments rather than 
to commercial banks. 
</P>
<P>
The move is designed partly to blunt pressure from the French for the summit 
countries to provide increased debt relief on a wider front, possibly even to 
alter the broad Third World debt strategy unveiled earlier this year by U.S. 
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Invitation to Paris 
</P>
<P>
France took a similar step on its own early this year, and French President 
Francois Mitterrand has invited leaders of 30 debtor countries to a dinner in 
Paris on the eve of the economic summit. The conference is intended only for 
leaders of the seven major industrial democracies: Britain, Canada, France, 
Italy, Japan, the United States and West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand has also proposed creating new lines of credit through the 
International Monetary Fund to help Latin debtors, but the United States and 
other major industrial countries are opposed. Most analysts are dismissing the 
French plan as a political gesture. 
</P>
<P>
France often makes such gestures for Third World countries. Paris still 
maintains close commercial ties with many of its former West African colonies, 
which still sell raw materials and purchase industrial goods that are made in 
France.

M1 Retreats, M2 Rises: The narrowest measure of the nation's money supply, M1, 
fell in the week ended June 19, to a seasonally adjusted $768.3 billion from a 
revised $769.6 billion, the Federal Reserve Board reported. A broader measure, 
known as M2, rose to a seasonally adjusted $3,092.9 billion from a revised 
$3,088.6 billion the week before. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in 
checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like 
savings deposits and money-market mutual funds.

U.S. Deeper in Debt: The United States, already the world's largest debtor 
nation, strengthened its hold on that dubious title in 1988 as its foreign debt 
surged 41% to $532.5 billion. The Commerce Department, releasing its annual 
balance sheet on America's global economic standing, said the U.S. debt burden 
had risen by $154.2 billion in 1988, up from $378.3 billion in debt to 
foreigners the United States owed at the end of 1987. The figures mean that 
foreigners own more in U.S. assets than Americans own abroad.

PEOPLE: PAULEY'S CONTROVERSIAL HEAD OF REFINING TO RESIGN SOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mark G. Newgard, one-time president and chief operating officer of Pauley 
Petroleum Inc., will resign his current job as executive vice president of the 
independent oil company effective July 31, the company announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Newgard, who joined Pauley in 1987 from Edgington Oil Co., oversaw the 
company's refining operations in Southern California. Company spokesman Larry 
Fisher said Newgard decided to leave after Pauley put its Carson refinery on 
the block last December as part of its strategy to phase out its refining 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Newgard was on vacation and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
In its announcement, the company said Newgard would pursue other professional 
interests but did not go into specifics. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Pauley Chairman Robert O. Anderson said: "It is with regret 
that we accept Mr. Newgard's resignation. He has brought our refinery 
operations forward effectively and their future success seems assured. We wish 
him well." 
</P>
<P>
As head of refining, Newgard found himself the target of charges by the South 
Coast Air Quality Management District for alleged violations of air quality 
regulations. Those charges were eventually dropped, Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
Newgard also found himself at odds with city officials during the expansion of 
the Carson refinery, exchanging heated letters until permits were approved. 
</P>
<P>
Before joining Pauley in 1987, Newgard was president and chief executive of 
Edgington Oil, which at the time was a subsidiary of Saudi arms merchant Adnan 
Khashoggi's Triad Corp. Newgard was reportedly instrumental in persuading the 
billionaire to sell the Los Angeles asphalt and oil company in late 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1987, Newgard joined Pauley, the small oil company founded by the late 
millionaire Edwin W. Pauley, under William R. Pagen, who was then chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly afterward, Pauley announced its merger with Hondo Oil &amp; Gas, the 
private oil company owned by former Atlantic Richfield chairman and legendary 
oilman Robert O. Anderson. Anderson took over the company and Newgard was named 
executive vice president in charge of refining operations. 
</P>
<P>
Newgard was also president of Pauley subsidiary Fletcher Oil &amp; Refining 
Co., which operated the Carson refinery. Pauley bought Fletcher, which at the 
time had filed for bankruptcy protection, for $8 million.

PEOPLE: MCKITRICK IS NEW CEO OF BUILDERS EMPORIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Builders Emporium, the Irvine-based home improvement chain, has named James T. 
McKitrick as its new president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
He succeeds acting president Ted W. Kazleman, who continues as executive vice 
president. Kazleman had assumed the presidency in April when Jack Edwards 
resigned as president and chief executive for personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
The changes are effective immediately. 
</P>
<P>
McKitrick, 43, previously was executive vice president and chief administrative 
officer of Ames Department Stores and chairman of its Zayre Discount Stores. He 
began his retailing career in 1965 at K mart, working his way up from store 
management to corporate director of merchandising. He left to join T. G. Y. 
Discount Stores in Oklahoma City in 1984, where he became executive vice 
president and general manager. In 1987, McKitrick became president and chief 
operating officer of the G. C. Murphy division. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a record in retailing, merchandising and operations that is 
sensational," said James R. Birle, co-chairman and chief executive of Wickes 
Cos., the chain's parent company. "He has a reputation as being a tremendous 
leader. He has creative insights and we just have enormous confidence in his 
ability." 
</P>
<P>
Builders Emporium is perhaps best known to Southern California consumers for 
its "We got the message, Mr. Sigoloff" advertisements. The ad campaign, which 
ran from 1982 until last year, featured former Wickes Chairman and Chief 
Executive Sanford C. Sigoloff, who stepped down after the Santa Monica company 
was acquired by Birle's investment group, WCI Holdings late last year. 
</P>
<P>
WCI had planned to sell Builders Emporium but recently decided to keep the 
chain, which operates stores in California, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico and 
Texas, because it is a valuable asset, Birle said. 
</P>
<P>
"We will focus our attention primarily in California and Nevada. We feel 
Builders Emporium is a California company, we want to grow it and enhance it 
where its heritage lies," Birle said. It had 1988 sales of about $675 million.

FORMER DISNEY EXECUTIVE RIPS SAUL STEINBERG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former chief executive of Walt Disney Co. slammed a co-defendant in court 
Thursday, saying he had not wanted corporate raider Saul P. Steinberg "to come 
back and rape the company again" after the firm's $325-million buyout in 1984 
of Steinberg's 11% stake in Disney. 
</P>
<P>
The corporate raider "is motivated only by greed," Ronald W. Miller, son-in-law 
of the late Walt Disney, added heatedly. 
</P>
<P>
His remarks came as he explained the board of directors' insistence on a 
Steinberg pledge not to buy Disney stock again. Without the condition, Miller 
testified, the directors would not have purchased the stake from Steinberg's 
Reliance Group Holdings. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony came in the fourth day of a jury trial of stockholder suits 
alleging that the 11-member board, the company, Steinberg and their investment 
advisers breached their fiduciary duty in buying Steinberg's stake at an 
above-market price. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by attorneys for both sides, Miller defended the 1984 board's 
decision, saying the purchase was necessary to save the company and benefited 
shareholders. At one point, plaintiffs attorney William Lerach produced a 
deposition in which Miller had referred to the payment to Steinberg as 
"greenmail." 
</P>
<P>
In a full day of continued testimony in Los Angeles County Superior Court, 
Miller threw new light on New York negotiations between the board's lawyers and 
Steinberg that worked out the buyout arrangement on the weekend of June 9 and 
10 in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently the decisive factor was the directors' threat to have Disney make a 
tender offer for its own stock at a high price, Miller testified. Although such 
a step would have been "suicidal," he said, the board never intended to carry 
out the move, which would have loaded the firm with as much as $2 billion of 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
In response to questions by Lerach, Miller acknowledged that he was playing 
golf that weekend and did not learn of the results of the final negotiations 
until Monday, June 11, before the directors voted on the deal.

A Montana law limiting the damages people may collect when wrongfully fired 
does not deprive employees of their rights under the state constitution, a 
divided Montana Supreme Court ruled Thursday in upholding the law. 
</P>
<P>
A dissenting justice, however, said the decision clears the way for a 
legislative onslaught against plaintiffs' rights in lawsuits, adding, "It may 
be the blackest judicial day in the history of this state." 
</P>
<P>
The court's 4-3 decision may have national implications because other states 
are considering "wrongful discharge" statutes similar to Montana's, said Joel 
P. Kelly, a Los Angeles lawyer who represented a company that was sued in the 
Montana case.

BANK BAILOUT TO COST U.S. $2 BILLION; 
</P>
<P>
FDIC OUTLINES TERMS OF DEAL FOR BANC ONE TO SAVE MCORP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. disclosed details Thursday of the complex 
arrangement under which Banc One Corp. of Columbus, Ohio, won a bidding 
competition to take over 20 failed banks of MCorp of Dallas, a bailout that 
will cost the federal government about $2 billion and constitute the 
second-largest bank rescue ever. 
</P>
<P>
FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman, describing the arrangement worked out in 
principle a day earlier, said the FDIC share would involve $300 million in cash 
outlays and an additional $1.7 billion debt to the Federal Reserve. It is part 
of a rescue package that includes from $3 billion to $3.5 billion in bad debts 
that are to be transferred to a separate asset pool, marked down to current 
market value and liquidated. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the flexibility to forgive all of that" $2 billion, Seidman said. He 
said the eventual cost could range as much as 15% higher or lower, depending on 
the outcome of the liquidation, which is expected to take up to five years. 
</P>
<P>
He said the 1984 bailout of Continental Illinois Corp., which originally 
involved an FDIC assumption of about $3.5 billion in bad debts, is now 
estimated to have reduced the aggregate loss to $1.5 billion. That operation, 
unprecedented at the time, is now ranked as only the third most costly bank 
bailout, after the $3-billion First Republic Bancorp rescue and now that of 
MCorp. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Terms of Transaction 
</P>
<P>
Under the arrangement announced Thursday, Banc One is to put up $500 million in 
new capital immediately, most of it in a $462.5-million loan to FDIC, which in 
turn would acquire outstanding non-voting stock in the MCorp banks and assume 
the risk of ownership of 92.5% of the failed holding company's equity for five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Banc One is to acquire the remaining equity, in the form of Class A voting 
stock, for $37.5 million in cash and will assume ownership of the remaining 
assets in prescribed stages by the fifth anniversary of the deal being 
finalized. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman said Banc One won out over five other bidders: Wells Fargo &amp; Co. of 
San Francisco; NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C.; Chemical Banking Corp. of New 
York; First City Bancorp of Houston, and the leveraged buyout firm of Kohlberg 
Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. of New York. 
</P>
<P>
NCNB is already a partner with FDIC in the bailout last year of First Republic 
Bank of Dallas. That, Seidman said, was -- by FDIC policy -- "not a positive 
factor" and weighed against the North Carolina holding company in the decision 
to award the MCorp deal to a competitor. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman said Banc One did not demand any tax breaks to sweeten the deal and 
that FDIC did not offer any. In the First Republic bailout, which at a 
currently estimated federal cost of $3 billion is the largest bank rescue ever, 
NCNB acquired tax benefits estimated at nearly $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Out in 5 Years 
</P>
<P>
The present arrangement, whose complex feature of Banc One lending most of the 
stake to FDIC, receiving gradual forgiveness of the loan, then paying an added 
$10 million risk premium to the federal agency, was tailored by Banc One for 
internal accounting reasons, Seidman said, "because they believed that for 
market reasons it would favor them." 
</P>
<P>
He added that the deal equally suits his agency. "The FDIC will be out totally 
in five years," Seidman said. The bottom line, he added, is that "for bank 
regulatory purposes this will be consolidation" of MCorp's 20 Texas banks under 
ownership and eventual management of Banc One. 
</P>
<P>
As a practical matter, the $500 million Banc One intends to put up in cash and 
in the form of the $462.5-million loan to FDIC, will count as an immediate 
capital infusion to MCorp, which has been reorganized since it was seized by 
the government last March and has operated under the temporary name of Deposit 
Insurance Bridge Bank, Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
The assets of the 20 MCorp banks, estimated at $13 billion, include bad loans, 
real estate investments that soured and other troubled assets estimated at $3 
billion to $3.5 billion. These are to be pooled separately and liquidated. 
</P>
<P>
"For practical purposes," Seidman said, "we will own the bad loans, and we 
intend to renegotiate them at the end of the five years if they have not been 
liquidated by then. We estimate the loss to be within 10% or 15% of $2 
billion."

VONS CONTRACT LINKS PAY, STORE PERFORMANCE; 
</P>
<P>
SUNDAY SALES, BONUSES KEY FOR TIANGUIS WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Workers at Vons' seven Tianguis food markets have ratified an innovative 
contract that will tie their pay to the performance of their stores. 
</P>
<P>
Labor experts said Thursday that the three-year contract, ratified last week by 
1,000 workers, is unusual because it links productivity and pay in a service 
industry. The concept is common in manufacturing where individual workers' 
productivity can be more easily measured. 
</P>
<P>
Although contract issues are still being worked out, the agreement includes two 
key provisions, according to Bill Bailey, director of labor relations for Vons 
Cos. 
</P>
<P>
First, the company and the union have agreed to a form of profit sharing in 
which employees would be paid bonuses for helping to boost profit. In addition, 
employees working Sundays, by far the Latino-oriented chain's busiest day, 
would be paid according to a formula based on sales per square foot. 
</P>
<P>
Under a long-standing rule, food industry employers generally pay workers time 
and a half on Sundays. Unions nationwide fought for that premium years ago, 
largely in an effort to discourage food merchants from opening on Sundays so 
that workers could be off. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Pay Formula 
</P>
<P>
But in recent years Sunday has become a huge shopping day. Tianguis assigns 85% 
to 90% of its staff to come in on Sundays to handle the crush of customers. 
</P>
<P>
With the aid of UCLA Prof. William G. Ouchi, a management expert, the El 
Monte-based company and the United Food and Commercial Workers devised a new 
pay formula. The UFCW represents the Tianguis chain's clerks and most of its 
meat cutters. 
</P>
<P>
Workers will start out making straight time on Sundays, but their pay will be 
adjusted upward as sales rise. Company and union officials anticipate that 
workers eventually could earn nearly double the straight pay. 
</P>
<P>
Audrey Freedman, a labor economist with the Conference Board research group in 
New York, praised the contract as one that should promote teamwork. 
</P>
<P>
"They're paying workers for the burden of serving more people," she said. "It 
encourages cooperation (because) a group is being rewarded on a group basis for 
taking on an extra load." 
</P>
<P>
Ranging from 21,000 to 60,000 square feet, the Tianguis stores are more 
dependent on service than typical self-service supermarkets. The larger stores 
employ as many as 400 workers. 
</P>
<P>
Among other departments, they feature a large delicatessen, a Mexican-style 
bakery, a pizzeria and a tortilleria, where workers make and bag tortillas 
daily. 
</P>
<P>
"The Tianguis operation is labor intensive," said Rick Icaza, president of UFCW 
Local 770 in Los Angeles. "They service you to death. Tianguis allows employees 
to kibitz, making it more of a social event." 
</P>
<P>
Union sources noted that profit sharing programs of one sort or another do 
exist at a few other chains in the East, including A &amp; P and Kroger stores. 
</P>
<P>
But the Tianguis pact is unusual in tying Sunday wages to productivity and in 
combining two job categories -- food clerks and lower-paid general merchandise 
clerks -- into one, affording Tianguis more flexibility in assigning workers. 
</P>
<P>
Icaza said the union is excited about the possibilities. "We like the idea that 
if we work hard we can earn potentially more than in the mainstream," he said. 
"I think this may be the contract of the future."

NBC'S 'SANTA BARBARA' IS TOP DAYTIME EMMY WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
With "Santa Barbara" winning six Emmys, including best soap opera honors for 
the second consecutive year, NBC had something to crow about Thursday at the 
16th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
NBC, which televised the two-hour ceremonies at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel here, 
won a total of seven Emmys, followed by ABC with five, syndicated programs with 
three, CBS with two and PBS with one. 
</P>
<P>
It was a day of disappointment, however, for Susan Lucci, who was making her 
10th bid to win a best actress Emmy as Erica Kane of ABC's "All My Children." 
That honor went instead to Marcy Walker, who plays Eden Capwell on "Santa 
Barbara." 
</P>
<P>
Other "Santa Barbara" cast members who picked up Emmys were Nancy Lee Grahn 
(who plays Julia Wainwright) as best supporting actress, Justin Deas (Keith 
Timmons) as best supporting actor, and Justin Gocke (Brandon Capwell) as best 
juvenile male. It was the second consecutive win for Deas. 
</P>
<P>
"Santa Barbara" also won for best writing on a daytime serial, bringing its 
total Emmys this year to eight. In nontelevised ceremonies for the craft 
categories last Saturday, the NBC soap had been honored for makeup and 
hairstyling. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Lucci's loss, "All My Children" won other tributes Thursday. David 
Canary was a repeat winner as best actor in a soap opera, honored for the 
second straight year for his dual roles of Adam and Stuart Chandler, and Debbi 
Morgan (who plays Angie Hubbard) shared supporting actress honors with Grahn of 
"Santa Barbara." Canary also had won in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
For the third year in a row, "The Oprah Winfrey Show" was named daytime's best 
talk show. But neither Winfrey nor nine-time winner Phil Donahue won as best 
talk show host. They lost out to Sally Jessy Raphael for the syndicated series 
that bears her name. 
</P>
<P>
Public television's "Newton's Apple," the 6-year-old science magazine, was 
named best children's series, and ABC's "The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh" 
won as best animated program. 
</P>
<P>
CBS' "The $25,000 Pyramid" was named best game show, while Alex Trebek picked 
up the award as best game show host for his work on the syndicated "Jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
In the first year that they were eligible for Daytime Emmys, cable programs did 
not win any during Thursday's ceremonies. But the cable industry had picked up 
four of the golden statuettes at the nontelevised event last Saturday. HBO's 
children's series "Encyclopedia" won two, for makeup and costume design, 
Cinemax's "James Stewart's Wonderful Life" captured a special program award and 
the Disney Channel's "Kids Incorporated" picked up an Emmy for lighting 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
Counting the craft awards, CBS wound up with a total of 17 Daytime Emmys. NBC 
had nine, PBS got eight, ABC and syndicated programs collected seven each. 
</P>
<P>
During the telecast Thursday, Victoria Wyndham of NBC's "Another World" paid 
tribute to her longtime co-star in the series, Douglass Watson, who died May 1. 
A former Emmy winner, he had been posthumously nominated for again as best soap 
opera actor. 
</P>
<P>
Wyndham, who worked with Watson for 16 years, called him "a risk taker, 
exacting and a gentleman. He gave 100%. . . . He was generous with his 
compliments and gentle with his criticism. He was the perfect acting partner." 
</P>
<P>
The Daytime Emmys, covering the period between March 6, 1988, and March 5, 
1989, were presented jointly by the Los Angeles-based Academy of Television 
Arts &amp; Sciences and the New York-based National Academy of Television Arts 
and Sciences. 
</P>

Awards for prime-time programming will be presented Sept. 17.

COMMUNITY COALITION THREATS COMPROMISE KVEA'S FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR VALLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite some apparent concessions to its critics, Spanish-language station KVEA 
Channel 52 was threatened Thursday with an escalation of hostilities from a 
community coalition accusing the station and its parent Telemundo network of 
discriminating against Mexicans and Mexican-Americans in its programming and 
senior management. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Mexican Coalition for the Improvement of Mass Media on Thursday 
expanded their attacks against KVEA, demanding that the station replace its six 
top managers with Mexicans or Mexican-Americans because of their alleged 
efforts to orchestrate the recent firing and forced resignation of the last 
high-ranking Mexican-Americans in KVEA senior management. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition's members gave Telemundo one week to respond to its demands 
before taking further action, including a threatened lawsuit and a campaign to 
revoke KVEA's operating license granted by the Federal Communications 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran English-language TV newscaster Frank Cruz left his position as KVEA's 
vice president and general manager in February while Bob Navarro, another 
English-language veteran TV reporter, said he was fired last month because of 
differences with Cruz's replacement, KVEA's present general manager and vice 
president, Stephen Levin. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the latest round of charges and countercharges by KVEA's critics 
were made inside a station studio provided by Donald G. Raider, Telemundo's 
chief operating officer, as an expression of good will following a more than 
three-hour meeting Wednesday with members of the newly formed coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Raider characterized the coalition's latest demands as "totally 
unreasonable," adding that "it would be a major disaster for the station and 
the employees themselves. Some of the managers are Hispanic-Americans who are 
very capable officers." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Raider promised that Levin would make every effort to develop and 
promote Latino staffers, including persons of Mexican descent, to the general 
manager position as soon as possible. "But I would like for the coalition to 
realize the difficulty of finding qualified talent to fill those positions," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Ruiz said the coalition was not being unreasonable. "We don't think that's such 
an illegitimate list of demands," he said. "They have caused the problems they 
now find themselves in." He also answered the allegations that the coalition 
was asking KVEA to discriminate against other Latinos with this question: "Why 
is it that no one is concerned that there are so few Mexicans represented in 
this station's management?" 
</P>
<P>
Raider also promised that KVEA would soon invite Latino leaders and 
professionals to sit on a station advisory council as well as create a 
full-time community liaison position to act as the general manager's 
representative in community and government affairs. This position, Raider 
added, would most likely be filled by a person of Mexican descent. 
</P>
<P>
But the coalition's leaders, though thankful for Raider's gestures, 
nevertheless insisted that Telemundo's Raider had not offered any concrete 
proposals to satisfy their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Except for KVEA's present news anchorman Alberto Aguilar, "There are no persons 
of Mexican descent in any policy-making positions," said Antonio Rodriguez, 
director of the Latino Community Justice Center. "This reflects a 
discriminatory attitude toward their audience whose majority is Mexican." 
</P>
<P>
"With one possible exception, no Chicanos or Mexicans are employed as Telemundo 
network employees," said Ruiz. But he dismissed as irrelevant claims of a 
so-called "Cubanization" of Spanish-language TV. He said a careful look at 
Telemundo's corporate hierarchy and its parent corporations show that virtually 
all its directors are white males.

KCET JUBILANT OVER INCREASE IN BUDGET, VIEWER RESPONSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MICHAELSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a steadily bullish fiscal track, KCET Channel 28 says that its budget for 
the fiscal year that begins Saturday will be $44.4 million -- a 15% increase 
over the current year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just really so up," William H. Kobin, the Los Angeles public-television 
station's president and chief executive officer, said this week. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to his list of happy statistics, in the midst of KCET's 25th anniversary 
celebrations, are a 6% increase in viewership and a 5% increase in subscribers 
over the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Those numbers, Kobin said, are even more dramatic when measured over the last 
five years. In fiscal 1984, an average of 1.5 million households watched KCET 
for at least 15 minutes a week; today the figure stands at 2.6 million 
households. In 1984, there were 200,000 financial contributors; today there are 
325,000. 
</P>
<P>
The consistent improvement in the station's financial picture follows a 
dramatic turnaround in 1986, when Kobin, then three years on the job, was able 
to help pull the station into the black, where it has been ever since. KCET had 
been in severe debt for several years. 
</P>
<P>
According to Barbara Goen, vice president for public information, the breakdown 
of the new budget is: 56% for production and broadcasting; 17% for fund raising 
and marketing; 12% administrative; 8% building facility support and 7% 
promotion and advertising. 
</P>
<P>
At the annual board meeting last week, where the new budget was approved, Kobin 
reported that more than half of the area's households watch KCET every week and 
more than 70% watch the station every month. 
</P>
<P>
The movie "Stand and Deliver," a PBS "American Playhouse" production, turned 
out to be KCET's "most-watched program of the year," said Kobin. The movie 
registered the second-highest rating in the station's history, behind a 
"National Geographic" special on tigers. 
</P>
<P>
"Stand and Deliver" has particular relevance to the station's leadership, which 
is trying to increase ethnic viewers and subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's interesting to note," Kobin told the board, that "Stand and Deliver," 
which aired with a Spanish simulcast on radio, "produced 3,000 pledges for 
$162,000, with over a third of the pledges coming from people with Hispanic 
surnames." 
</P>
<P>
The $44.4 million projected in the coming fiscal year includes an estimated 
$1.4 of capital expenditures to purchase equipment, Kobin said.

HOME TECH: SALES OF SPORTS VIDEO TO JUMP TO $50 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sports video market is booming. 
</P>
<P>
This year it will become a $50-million market, according to projections from 
Betsy Niesyn, managing editor of the trade newsletter Home Video Publisher. In 
each of the last two years, the market total has been $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
Industry executives cite a variety of factors for the surge, including lower 
prices, better quality and new marketing methods. 
</P>
<P>
In the latter category, for example, is the fact that mass merchants such as 
Target and K mart have become a significant outlet for sports videos. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the (sports) tapes are shipped to the mass merchants -- about 
three-quarters of them," said Peter Liguori, marketing manager of HBO, which 
specializes in boxing tapes. "That has helped build up the sports video market 
tremendously." 
</P>
<P>
In the old days, sports video companies had to rely heavily on video retailers, 
who have traditionally been too concerned with stocking hit movies to set aside 
much shelf space for anything else. That left the limited catalogue/mail-order 
route as the primary outlet for sports videos. 
</P>
<P>
Also helping to fuel the boom has been the premium sales business. Companies 
such as Sports Illustrated now buy sports videos -- particularly blooper tapes 
-- to use as promotional giveaways. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big market now," said Janice Whiffen, vice president of marketing at 
Media Home Video, distributor of the National Football League video series. "A 
sports-video company can sell hundreds of thousands of copies of a tape that 
way. The profit margins are small, but you can sell a lot of tapes very easily 
that way." 
</P>
<P>
Sports-video producers have also learned to make their programs more 
entertaining. "The product is much better," said John Gaffney of CBS-Fox, which 
releases National Basketball Assn. tapes. "People are willing to spend money 
for a better product." 
</P>
<P>
But they don't want to spend too much. That's why the drop in price has also 
been a huge factor is the growth of the sports video market. 
</P>
<P>
"Sports videos used to cost $30 or $40 just three years ago," Whiffen said. 
"The price was a problem. Now everyone is in the volume business -- sell as 
many as you can at a low price. Now just about everything is $19.95 or even 
cheaper. That's more appealing to consumers." 
</P>
<P>
Most sports video are either instructional or documentaries -- a category 
dominated by the sport's bloopers tapes, like those put out by the National 
Football League's video company. 
</P>
<P>
"Documentaries, meaning those blooper tapes, sell better than instructional 
because they have all-around appeal," said Niesyn of Home Video Publisher. "The 
bloopers tapes have a broad audience, while tennis or golf instructional tapes 
are just for people who are into that sport. Those blooper tapes sell well at 
the mass-merchant level." 
</P>
<P>
Highlight tapes released right after a pro championship are popular too, like 
the NFL's Super Bowl winners' series. CBS-Fox has had success with Lakers' 
championship videos and will soon market a Detroit Pistons program. 
</P>
<P>
MPI had a surprise hit in 1985 with "The Super Bowl Shuffle," featuring members 
of the colorful Chicago Bears rapping to dance music. Other videos presenting 
members of other football teams rapping weren't as successful, however. 
</P>
<P>
In the instructional market, Niesyn said, the four most popular sports-video 
categories are golf, tennis, baseball and basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"There are more golf tapes on the market than any other kind of sports video," 
she said. "Golf is like a religion to golfers. They'll do anything to improve 
their game. Some golf tapes are very expensive, but those golfers don't care. 
In numbers of tapes on the market, tennis is next. But tennis players aren't as 
fanatical as golf nuts, so those tapes don't sell quite as well. Tapes for 
these solitary sports do better than tapes for organized sports like baseball 
and basketball."

3,700-ACRE ELIZABETH LAKE BLAZE NEARLY UNDER CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Firefighters declared Thursday that they have gained the upper hand on a 
3,700-acre fire that burned a house and two barns near the remote Los Angeles 
County community of Elizabeth Lake. 
</P>
<P>
Full control was expected by this morning. Elizabeth Lake is a community of 
2,500 in the foothills west of Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County firefighters said the fire is "95% under control." They said 
five vehicles and electric power poles and lines were also destroyed. Southern 
California Edison Co. officials said power was restored by 10:30 a.m. Thursday 
to about 700 customers who had been without power overnight. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's feeling real good about the way things are going," County Fire 
Department spokesman Corey Lovers said. 
</P>
<P>
Charred ground surrounded some homes Thursday, showing how close the fire came 
to causing much greater property loss. Several people praised the efforts of 
firefighters, saying they had fled their homes expecting to return to 
smoldering rubble. 
</P>
<P>
"The closest burn is 10 feet from the house," said Don Simpson, a 23-year 
resident. "Everything around the house is black." 
</P>
<P>
About half a mile away, Velma Majors and her family sifted through what was 
left of the rented home they moved to four years ago to "get away from the 
hustle-bustle" of Redondo Beach.

CHP UNVEILS SPECIAL TROUBLE TEAMS TO UNSNARL FREEWAY JAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARRELL DAWSEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stepping up its offensive on the traffic snarls plaguing Los Angeles County, 
the California Highway Patrol on Thursday unveiled an ambitious six-month pilot 
program designed to alleviate congestion on the most troubled portions of the 
San Bernardino, Santa Ana and San Diego freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed Operation CLEAR -- for Clearing Lanes Efficiently And Rapidly, the 
program will use specially trained teams of "congestion relief officers," CHP 
officers whose sole duty will be to patrol specific sections of the three 
freeways in search of stalled cars, debris and other traffic impediments. 
</P>
<P>
The program, scheduled to begin Monday, will also use at least one helicopter 
and a fleet of tow trucks to find and remove obstructions. 
</P>
<P>
And because the special squads will not issue tickets for most minor 
violations, CHP officials said they hoped the extra time will enable the agency 
to improve its response time to no more than 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
CHP officials in Orange County said they would like to duplicate the Los 
Angeles pilot project but must await the Los Angeles results. CHP Officer Jill 
Angel in Los Angeles said Los Angeles was selected for the pilot project 
because it has the busiest freeways in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, however, Caltrans intends to hire tow truck companies to 
remove stalled vehicles during the Santa Ana Freeway widening project, 
beginning this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Although CHP spokesman Sgt. Michael H. Brey called the current response time 
for officers "anybody's guess at this point," he said the agency's tow trucks 
now take an average of 23 minutes to arrive at a trouble spot. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we must do more to identify traffic problems," Chief Edward Gomez, 
head of the Southern Division of the CHP, said at a press conference on 
Thursday. "(Traffic) is one of the biggest concerns affecting the quality of 
life in Southern California. . . . Frankly, I see this program being 
implemented in all major urban areas of the country. Right now, there is 
nothing like it." 
</P>
<P>
Gomez said he could not estimate the cost of the program and said there is no 
specific timetable for expanding it to other parts of the state. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was concerned that some motorists might try to take advantage of the 
fact that the "relief officers" will not write many tickets. But he emphasized 
that other CHP officers regularly assigned to patrol freeways will continue 
citing motorists. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez called the program unique because "you have people dedicated to nothing 
but looking for items obstructing traffic." He said the program will use 30 to 
35 CHP officers from 6:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. and from 2:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. Monday 
through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The officers will patrol the portion of the San Bernardino Freeway that 
stretches from the Long Beach Freeway to the San Gabriel River Freeway; the 
section of the Santa Ana Freeway that runs from the East Los Angeles 
interchange to the Indiana Street overpass, and a stretch of the San Diego 
Freeway that snakes from the southern part of the Harbor Freeway to the Marina 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The teams will receive help from the California Department of Transportation, 
which will continue its practice of patrolling the freeways and notifying the 
CHP of any impediments or hazards. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez said that, in addition to the greater amount of time officers would spend 
patrolling the freeways, response time would be improved by the "visual 
support" the helicopter would provide. The tow trucks automatically will be 
dispatched with officers responding to calls. 
</P>
<P>
"If a vehicle breaks down, we have in our plan the ability to traverse 30 miles 
of highway in minutes," Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
During traffic jams, the new "relief officers" will continue to use traditional 
methods of reaching trouble spots -- patrol cars will ride along the shoulders 
of the freeways and motorcycles will weave through traffic, Brey said. But the 
addition of a helicopter and the emphasis on road hazards, rather than 
violators, would make the difference, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez, speaking outside Southern Division Headquarters, added that the CHP was 
soliciting motorists -- particularly those with mobile phones -- to help make 
the agency's efforts a success. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had an emergence of cellular phones over the past few years," he said. 
"We're asking the public to use these to help us identify (problems). We're 
also asking individuals whose cars have mechanical problems not to pull into 
the center lane. Try to make it to the right shoulder." 
</P>
<P>
Some CHP officers said they were confident the new program would be successful. 
</P>
<P>
"From what I've heard of it, I think it'll work," Officer Warren A. Stanley 
said. "But it's going to take that and a lot more to solve some of the traffic 
problems around here." 
</P>
<P>
However, the CHP's enthusiasm over the new program was lost on many Los Angeles 
County commuters, who registered mixed reactions to Operation CLEAR. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (CHP officers) screw up the freeways enough," said Robert Fowler, 31, 
a Los Angeles resident who services elevators. "Every time something happens, 
they slow things down. Traffic is just going to get worse." 
</P>
<P>
Other Los Angeles motorists agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the program will have much impact," said Gerald Collins, 35, a 
banker who works downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Jeffrey A. Perlman in Orange County also contributed to this 
report.

CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTION FOR FLAG LAUNCHED IN HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
With the endorsement of President Bush, House members Thursday introduced a 
constitutional amendment that would ban desecration of the U.S. flag. 
</P>
<P>
The one-sentence amendment, which came in response to last week's Supreme Court 
decision permitting flag burning as a form of free speech, reads: "The Congress 
and the states shall have the power to prohibit the physical desecration of the 
flag of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel of Illinois, who introduced the proposed 
amendment along with Rep. G. V. (Sonny) Montgomery (D-Miss.), said: "We are 
taking this step because it is the only way to protect the flag, given the 
recent Supreme Court decision. 
</P>
<P>
"The flag already is consecrated through 200 years of love and sacrifice and 
reverence of a special, almost sacred kind. We seek only to protect it, just as 
you'd protect any loved one under attack." 
</P>
<P>
In its 5-4 decision, the high court held that a Texas law banning desecration 
of the flag violated an individual's right to criticize the U.S. government. 
The decision sparked an uproar across the country, and many elected officials, 
including Bush, have vowed to take steps to reverse the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Bush said that he would sponsor a constitutional amendment 
to overturn the court's decision. But the President later decided to let House 
members proceed with their own proposal, according to a Republican leadership 
aide. The President "signed off on our proposal, and that is what Congress will 
now be working with," the aide said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesman announced that Bush will travel today to the Iwo Jima 
war memorial in Arlington, Va., to rally support for the flag. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
All-Night Session 
</P>
<P>
Michel's announcement came on the heels of an all-night session of the House, 
in which 20 to 25 members made lengthy speeches denouncing the court's 
decision. During the marathon of speeches, Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden 
Grove) told the House that the government gives more protection to U.S. 
currency, by making its destruction illegal. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't rip up our own money," Dornan said. "It is protected. But beautiful 
Old Glory is not." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Don Ritter (R-Pa.) said the same protection applies to U.S. mailboxes. He 
noted that the willful destruction of a mailbox is punishable by up to 10 years 
in prison and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief press statement, Michel said that he has consulted with 
constitutional law experts and determined that legislation alone would not be 
sufficient to reverse the court's controversial ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Other members of Congress, however, have suggested that federal and state 
flag-burning laws could be rewritten to meet the court's objections. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drops 'Harm' Reference 
</P>
<P>
Last week, for example, the Senate unanimously approved a bill by Sen. Joseph 
R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) that would change the current federal statute banning 
flag desecration. Biden said that the proposed law would ban desecration of the 
flag but make no reference to the "harm" such action could cause, as the Texas 
law did. 
</P>
<P>
Michel, brushing aside concerns about the constitutionality of his proposed 
amendment, said that he has more faith "in the strength of the Constitution and 
in the common sense of the American people to believe that the First Amendment 
can be weakened by protecting the flag from desecration." 
</P>
<P>
The Republican leader said that his amendment would be heard by the House 
Judiciary Committee shortly after Congress returns from its Fourth of July 
recess. At that time, he said: "I will address the various specific questions 
of interpretation that will arise. This amendment will protect Old Glory and 
our First Amendment rights."

SCIENTIST WARNS IRVINE COUNCIL ON OZONE PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARCIDA DODSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A chemical physicist warned the Irvine City Council Thursday evening that a 
sweeping proposed ordinance designed to help protect the ozone layer could 
prompt businesses and industry to turn to solvents and cleaners that are unsafe 
in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
"There are always technological alternatives," said Kathleen Wolf, who said she 
has researched ozone-depleting substances. Some of the alternatives being 
discussed, however, she said, are flammable and could endanger employee safety, 
may be carcinogens, or could pollute water. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to do it in an orderly way, so we don't endanger people in other 
ways," Wolf said of the effort to find alternatives to ozone-depleting 
compounds. 
</P>
<P>
Wolf was one of about 10 people, including renowned ozone expert F. Sherwood 
Rowland, a UC Irvine professor, to testify during a 2 1/2-hour public hearing 
at Irvine City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Rowland endorsed the measure, but Wolf told council members: "I'm frightened to 
death that people will start using things that are different but also 
dangerous. There is no free lunch. We have to be careful about our trade-offs." 
</P>
<P>
It was the first public hearing for the proposed ordinance, which would be, it 
is believed, the most far-reaching in the nation in its restriction on the use 
of ozone-depleting compounds. Other cities have banned foam food containers 
made with chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, and the state of Vermont has banned 
automobile air conditioners that use CFCs beginning in 1993. Irvine's 
ordinance, however, would address those areas as well as go after businesses 
that use ozone-depleting compounds to, for example, make or clean circuit 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine ordinance would severely restrict the use of CFCs and Halon, 
substances that research has shown deplete the earth's ozone layer, which 
protects the planet from harmful ultraviolet radiation. It would affect 
electronics and other high-tech businesses, home insulation, the repair of 
automobile and building air conditioners, the use and sale of plastic foam 
dishes and cups, and even the testing of fire extinguishers in computer rooms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Action Taken 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of about six businesses and industrial groups also spoke before 
the council, which did not take any action and continued the public hearing to 
July 18. 
</P>
<P>
One speaker -- David S. Shiffman, director of administration for Canon Business 
Machines in Costa Mesa, which would not be affected by the ordinance -- warned 
Irvine council members that the costs of complying with the proposed law would 
drive businesses out of Irvine, leading to a loss of revenue and employment in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
The council also heard from representatives of other businesses, one of which 
was Western Digital. Its spokesman said the push to restrict CFCs is feasible 
and that Western Digital once used CFCs-laden solvents to make computer 
components such as printed circuit boards and integrated circuits but that it 
switched to a "water wash" five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
It was Rowland's pioneering research at UC Irvine in 1974 that established that 
the ozone layer was being depleted. In his presentation Thursday, Rowland 
explained that CFCs destroy the ozone layer, and that when that happens, 
harmful ultraviolet radiation can reach the earth. Researchers have linked 
ultraviolet radiation to skin cancer and immune system disorders. At the same 
time, CFCs also do not allow the earth's heat to escape, thus creating a 
condition known as the greenhouse effect. 
</P>
<P>
CFCs, Rowland told the council, have a lifetime of 75 to 110 years in the lower 
atmosphere, eventually traveling up to the stratosphere, where they burn off 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Local ordinances restricting CFC use, he said, can be forerunners of more 
far-reaching laws. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What It Would Do 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's ordinance would: 
</P>
<P>
* Bar the use of any ozone-depleting compound in manufacturing, production, 
cleansing, degreasing or sterilization (although the military and licensed 
health care facilities would be exempt). 
</P>
<P>
* Prohibit the use of packaging materials such as containers for fast food that 
use CFCs as well as the sale of any foam products using CFCs. 
</P>
<P>
* Prohibit the use of building insulation that contains or uses CFCs. 
</P>
<P>
* Require the recovery and proper disposal of insulation material when it is 
removed from a building. 
</P>
<P>
* Require anyone working on air conditioners -- in vehicles or buildings -- or 
on refrigeration units to use a machine that recovers and recycles the 
refrigerant, which contains CFCs. 
</P>
<P>
* Prohibit anyone from selling coolant for use in refrigeration or air 
conditioning unless the buyer has a certificate showing he or she has a 
recycling system; 
</P>
<P>
* Prohibit the release of Halon in the testing of fire extinguishing systems or 
in training without a permit; 
</P>
<P>
* Create a position for an environmental program coordinator, who would work 
with businesses to help them comply with the ordinance (such a post would cost 
$300,000 for two years, according to a city report). 
</P>
<P>
Irvine City Council aide Katherine Lyon said information about the proposed 
ordinance and reply cards were mailed several weeks ago to more than 5,000 
businesses. The city received 238 responses, of which 11% said they use CFCs. 
Of those, 50% were supportive of the ordinance. Of those not affected, 80% said 
they favor the proposed law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Effects Argued 
</P>
<P>
But Wolf contended that Irvine's ordinance would make it illegal for residents 
to use suede shoe cleaner, which contains methylchloroform, or brake cleaner. 
Many hospitals, which would be exempt, do not sterilize their own instruments, 
instead sending them out to businesses, which would not be exempt, she said. 
</P>
<P>
She warned that there are "a number of entrepreneurs who are excited about 
this, who are marketing products (as alternatives to CFCs) and not always 
telling the truth. I think we must be very careful." 
</P>
<P>
After she made her remarks, she was immediately surrounded by business 
representatives who apparently took heart in her criticisms of the proposed 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Wolf said after the meeting that the ordinance is not necessary because the 
Montreal Protocol -- an agreement among the CFC-producing nations around the 
world -- will begin taking effect in July. That would reduce the amount of CFCs 
available, which would raise its cost and therefore prompt industry to find 
alternatives. The Montreal Protocol calls for a 50% reduction by the turn of 
the century, although it is believed that the agreement will be revised next 
year to call instead for a total ban by the end of the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
It is important to proceed cautiously and to be certain that the industry does 
not substitute CFCs with something just as bad, Wolf argued. 
</P>
<P>
Wolf is project manager of the Source Reduction Research Partnership, a venture 
between the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and the 
Environmental Defense Fund, which is attempting to reduce the use of 
chlorinated solvents. She said she previously worked on the issue of CFCs for 
13 years with the RAND Corp. and plans to set up a nonprofit consulting office 
to offer technical assistance to businesses and industries grappling with the 
CFC issue. 
</P>
<P>
Shiffman of Canon said the proposed law has no provisions for businesses that 
use a small amount of CFCs and recycle their compounds. Further, he said, the 
July 1, 1990, implementation date allows insufficient time to come up with 
workable and affordable alternatives.

Lower sewer rates: The Irvine Ranch Water District has adopted a 1989-90 budget 
that includes a reduction in sewer rates and no change in water rates, district 
officials announced this week. The sewer service charge for a residential 
customer, now $8.95 a month, will be reduced to $8.35, effective Saturday. The 
decrease is due to lower operating costs and greater revenue, water district 
officials said.

FORGERY CHARGES AGAINST ASSEMBLYMAN TO STAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge in Sacramento on Thursday refused to dismiss charges 
against Republican Assemblyman John R. Lewis of Orange, who is accused of 
forging former President Reagan's name on campaign-endorsement letters mailed 
to California voters in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis' attorney, Clyde M. Blackmon, said he will appeal the decision of 
Superior Court Judge James I. Morris to the 3rd District Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Blackmon had asked Morris to dismiss the charges on grounds that the phony 
endorsement letters could not constitute forgery under California law because 
there was no intent to defraud anyone of money or property. But Morris said the 
letters could have defrauded voters of their right to fair elections. 
</P>
<P>
The motions filed by Blackmon parallel those he filed earlier this year that 
were rejected by Morris and the Court of Appeal. But Blackmon maintains that 
the Court of Appeal ruled against Lewis on a procedural point the first time, 
and that this time, the court will be able to examine the merits of the case. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, indicted Feb. 6 by the Sacramento County Grand Jury, has pleaded 
innocent and is scheduled to go to trial Sept. 25.

<P>
El Modena's Craig Gibson knows the story of George Tuioti all too well. 
</P>
<P>
He remembers how Tuioti, the flamboyant linebacker at Santa Ana High School, 
tore ligaments in his left knee while practicing for last year's Orange County 
All-Star football game. He knows how Tuioti underwent arthroscopic surgery and 
missed his freshman season at USC, where he had landed a football scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
And because he has heard Tuioti's saga, Gibson understands the risk he will 
take Friday night when he plays in the Orange County All-Star game at Orange 
Coast College's LeBard Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson, a 6-foot-3, 240-pound offensive lineman with the North team, knows his 
future in football, and his career at USC, could be at stake every time he 
throws a block. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a pretty big risk to play," Gibson said, "but if you love this sport, you 
want to play as much as you can. A game like this is a lot of fun, too. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too bad something like that happens (to Tuioti). But it's something you 
can't control." 
</P>
<P>
Several of Gibson's teammates and opponents will risk college careers on Friday 
night. North Coach John Barnes said about half of the 72 players in Friday's 
game have scholarships to such schools as USC, UCLA, Air Force, Nebraska and 
Brigham Young. About 15 others will attend community colleges, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Servite running back Derek Brown originally turned down an offer to play in the 
Orange County game. He had planned to work part time this summer in Nebraska, 
where he will play next fall, but changed his mind after attending a banquet 
for the players. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to get the feeling of playing with new people," said Brown, who also 
will play in the Shrine All-Star game on July 29 in the Rose Bowl. "This is 
just for the fun of it." 
</P>
<P>
And that's why it's a risk. Scores and records don't matter. The games are a 
showcase for talent. Most of the players already have signed letters of intent 
and have little to gain, but a lot to lose. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said it's worth risking injury to play against the best players in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
"If you think about getting hurt, you will," he said. "If you think about 
playing hard, you will. Life is one big risk, and I'll take it." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Petko, a former Servite teammate of Brown's, decided not to take the risk 
last year. Petko, now a second-string linebacker at Nebraska, turned down an 
offer to play in the all-county game to train at Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
Petko said Nebraska coaches didn't like the idea of him playing in the game, 
but "they left it up to me." 
</P>
<P>
"I think they didn't want their investment to get hurt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
USC made the same investment in Tuioti, a 6-foot-4, 229-pound linebacker who 
blew through offensive lines like a twister in a trailer park. 
</P>
<P>
Tuioti still takes on an angry edge when he recalls the day he injured his 
knee. He usually wore knee braces during practices and games, but didn't think 
he needed them because the South team was working on pass-coverage drills. 
After all, there was little, if any, contact, he thought. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Tuioti tried to avoid contact when he covered a tailback who had just 
caught a swing pass. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to hold off from hitting him," Tuioti recalled. "My leg hyperextended 
in front of me. I did a flip and heard a loud pop." 
</P>
<P>
As coaches and teammates rushed to his side, Tuioti remembered how his parents 
had warned him about the risk of playing. And he thought about how the USC 
coaches would react. 
</P>
<P>
"Most parents don't want their kids playing in a game because of the risks," he 
said. "I kept telling my parents it would be OK." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't. After surgery, Tuioti underwent months of rehabilitation. He never 
attended USC because he didn't meet the freshman eligibility standards under 
the NCAA's Prop. 48 rule. 
</P>
<P>
"The (injury) was definitely a turning point in my life," Tuioti said. "I had 
to humble myself after this." 
</P>
<P>
He has since enrolled at San Diego State and hopes to play this fall.

<P>
"I don't have any regrets about playing in the game," he said. "That's one 
thing I've learned from this. If you regret things, your life falls apart." 
</P>
<P>
Tuioti hopes he's as fortunate as former Sunny Hills quarterback Jim Karsatos, 
who recovered from a knee injury he suffered in the 1982 Orange County All-Star 
game. 
</P>
<P>
After surgery and a redshirt year in 1982, Karsatos passed for 5,089 yards in 
four years at Ohio State. He led them to a 9-3 record and a victory over 
Brigham Young in the Citrus Bowl in 1985 and a 10-3 record and a victory over 
Texas A&amp;M in the Cotton Bowl the next season. 
</P>
<P>
A year after he injured his knee, Karsatos told reporters he would play in the 
all-star game again, if given the chance. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact I kind of wish I did have a chance to go back again," he said. "I 
don't have any regrets." 
</P>
<P>
Neither does Jerry Gillespie, an offensive guard from Westminster who's wearing 
a knee brace and will watch Friday night's game from the sidelines. Gillespie, 
who plans to attend Golden West College in the fall, strained tendons in his 
right knee while practicing with the South team on Saturday. "It didn't even 
come to mind being a risk," he said "I would do it all over again. Injuries are 
part of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the risks, college coaches wonder if they should let their recruits 
play. 
</P>
<P>
USC Coach Larry Smith said the games reward athletes, but added that they 
should consider the consequences before playing. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell them, 'You're the guy who achieved this, so it's up to you,' " he said. 
"I just want them to make sure they're in condition when they play." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Workman, Orange Coast College coach, watched 11 of his current players in 
last year's county all-star game. He said he encourages his recruits to play in 
postseason games. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great culmination to a high school career," he said. "I think it's a 
shame if they don't play." 
</P>
<P>
Tuioti said players should keep the games in perspective when deciding whether 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real hard decision," he said. "All they think about is that it's an 
all-county game. They don't think about the negative side." 
</P>
<P>
Tuioti said he supported the decision by former Capistrano Valley quarterback 
Todd Marinovich to sit out last year's game. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody should be forcing them to play," he said. "No one gave Marinovich a 
hard time when he said no. If you play, you should protect yourself. It's just 
a game. You don't have to go all out and bust your head or anything." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said he thinks college seniors take more of a risk when they play in 
all-star games such as the Hula Bowl and the East-West Shrine game. College 
players are trying to increase their bargaining power with professional teams, 
while high school players already are committed to a college. 
</P>
<P>
"A scholarship won't be taken away because of an injury," he said. "But it will 
still have a drastic effect on (a player's) performance." 
</P>
<P>
Gibson said conditioning helps the players avoid injury. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone showed up in pretty good shape," he said. "Everyone has been doing 
their running and conditioning. But a game like this gets you used to hitting 
again." 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, hitting too hard. 
</P>
<P>
"This game is meant to show what these athletes have," Tuioti said. "But they 
shouldn't put all they worked for in high school into this game. If they do, 
they'll just break down."

<P>
Derek Brown, Servite High School's outstanding running back, will make a 
curtain call after all at 7:30 tonight in the 30th Orange County All-Star 
football game at LeBard Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who set many of the county's rushing records in his three-year career, 
originally declined to participate in the charity game for graduating high 
school seniors. But Brown changed his mind while attending a pregame banquet 
three weeks ago and game officials agreed to add him to the North roster. 
</P>
<P>
Brown sustained a minor ankle injury at Wednesday's practice that forced him to 
the sidelines, but North Coach John Barnes of Los Alamitos said he expects 
Brown to rush 20-25 times in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll try to get the ball in his hands as much as possible," Barnes said. 
"We've got shovel passes, delay routes, screens and even a halfback option pass 
play designed with Derek Brown in mind." 
</P>
<P>
Brown became the county's single-season rushing leader with 2,301 yards last 
fall and finished with 4,663 yards in his career, second only to former 
Valencia star Ray Pallares' 5,398 yards in county history. 
</P>
<P>
Brown also scored 30 touchdowns, tying Kerwin Bell of Edison and Eric Fox of 
Capistrano Valley for second place on the single-season scoring list. He also 
holds the third and fifth-best single game rushing marks of 338 yards and 312 
yards, both against rival Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, Brown returned kickoffs of 90 and 95 yards for touchdowns in the 
Division I playoffs last fall, a statistic South Coach Dave Holland of Corona 
del Mar was well aware of. Holland insisted that game officials follow the 
national federation rules that prohibit any kickoff that goes into the end zone 
from being returned. 
</P>
<P>
The South will counter with a passing game. David Henigan, who led Fountain 
Valley to the Division I title, will start at quarterback. Henigan passed for 
4,620 yards in his three-year career, ranking fifth on the county's career 
list. 
</P>
<P>
"Henigan had adapted well to our possession-type passing game," Holland said. 
"One of our strengths is at quarterback, and I think we'll throw quite a bit." 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, defense has dominated and this year should be no exception. 
Garrett Greedy, a hard-hitting linebacker from Servite, anchors the North 
defense. Greedy will attend UCLA in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Linebackers John Katovsich and Chris Deuchar, who led Corona del Mar to the 
Division VI title, are the standouts for the South's defense. The starting 
front four and linebackers average 229 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to take some mighty good offense to score," Barnes said. "Our 
defense is a coach's dream, and I expect their defense to be awesome." 
</P>
<P>
Kicker Phil Nevin of El Dorado could be a factor if the North's offense 
sputters. Nevin had the longest field goal (57 yards) in the state last season 
and has declined an offer from the Dodgers as an infielder to kick at Cal State 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"If we get anywhere near the 30-yard line and stall, I wouldn't hesitate to try 
a field goal with Nevin," Barnes said.

<P>
The developers of a plush oceanside resort in Dana Point say construction has 
been delayed again, this time at least until fall. 
</P>
<P>
The California Coastal Commission approved the $300-million Monarch Beach 
Resort more than a year ago. As late as March, Dana Point developer Stein-Brief 
Group Inc. said construction would begin in May. 
</P>
<P>
Now it could be the end of the year before construction starts, Stein-Brief 
said this week. 
</P>
<P>
The developer said the delay was caused by "minor processing things" but 
declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the developer referred questions to Hemmeter Development Co., the 
Hawaiian resort developer that is an equal partner with Stein-Brief in the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Stein-Brief's public relations firm traced the delay to "lengthy negotiations" 
with community groups over obligations to build playing fields in Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
The two companies plan to build 1,126 hotel rooms in a main hotel and a smaller 
wing, part of an explosion of county seaside resorts. 
</P>
<P>
Another project, Waterfront in Huntington Beach, is under development. And the 
Irvine Co. said this week it had selected Marriott Corp. to run an 1,100-room 
resort it plans on land it owns between Laguna Beach and Newport Beach.

NO WORD FROM MAI ON MEETING RIVAL BID; 
</P>
<P>
J. H. WHITNEY LAUNCHES TENDER OFFER FOR PRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
J. H. Whitney &amp; Co. officially launched its tender offer for Prime Computer 
Inc. on Thursday, while MAI Basic Four Inc. extended its offer without 
announcing whether it will match or beat the rival Whitney bid. 
</P>
<P>
Whitney, a private New York venture capital firm, is offering to buy Prime, a 
Natick, Mass., minicomputer maker, in a cash and securities deal valued between 
$1.2 billion and $1.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Prime announced on June 23 that it had agreed to be purchased by Whitney in a 
friendly acquisition that would result in publicly held Prime becoming a 
private company. Prime had been searching for a "white knight" for months to 
save it from MAI's hostile bid. 
</P>
<P>
MAI, a Tustin computer maker, has been pursuing Prime since November. On June 
22, the day Prime revealed that it had received an offer from an unnamed 
bidder, MAI said it would increase its $1.1-billion offer for Prime. MAI "is 
still evaluating the situation and is hopeful that we will be able to meet the 
Whitney offer," MAI spokeswoman Toni Lee said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Separately Thursday, MAI filed a lawsuit against Prime, some of its directors 
and Whitney. The suit, filed in Delaware Chancery Court, alleges that Prime and 
Whitney engaged in a "rigged auction" in order to interfere with the bidding 
process for Prime. 
</P>
<P>
Among other charges, the suit alleges that Prime refused to provide 
confidential corporate data to MAI after entering into the merger agreement 
with Whitney. MAI said the information is needed to allow MAI to make its best 
offer for Prime. 
</P>
<P>
Prime officials were unavailable for comment on the MAI suit. 
</P>
<P>
Whitney is offering $21.50 in cash for Prime's 49.5 million outstanding shares 
of common stock, or about 79% of Prime's stock. Whitney would exchange 
securities with a face value of $22 per share for the remainder of Prime stock. 
Various analysts have estimated the "blended value" of the Prime offer at 
between $19 and $20 per share. 
</P>
<P>
MAI's offer is a similar combination of cash and securities. The Tustin firm is 
offering $19.50 per share for about 75% of Prime, and a mixture of preferred 
stock and bonds for the rest. Analysts have estimated the value of the MAI 
offer at about $18 per share. 
</P>
<P>
Prime's stock closed Thursday at $19.25 per share, up 25 cents, in New York 
Stock Exchange trading. MAI closed at $5.75, down 12.5 cents, in Big Board 
trading.

PRECOCIOUS PASTA GRILL LEAVES FORMULA BEHIND BUT HAS GROWING PAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Max Jacobson

<TEXT>
<P>
Spaghettini, the swank Seal Beach grill and pasta house, celebrated its first 
birthday last weekend. Like many babies, it gets by largely on beauty. 
</P>
<P>
Its many dining rooms are large and airy, with high ceilings, terra-cotta 
floors, handsomely dressed tables, ladder-back chairs and French country murals 
on the walls. There is a library room with cabbage-green carpets and 
crescent-shaped booths under shelves of ancient-looking books, so this baby can 
grow up smart. And there is an open kitchen, complete with mesquite grill and a 
brick, oak-burning pizza oven, so it won't have to be jealous of the other 
kids' toys. And there is even an ultrachic bar, so it won't be lonely when it 
is old enough to swing. 
</P>
<P>
But right now, I would say the kitchen is having its share of growing pains. An 
appetizer of fried mozzarella dipped in seasoned bread crumbs has almost no 
character at all, dripping with an undeveloped tomato basil sauce. Green-lipped 
New Zealand mussels are quite a bit better -- large and meaty with a chewy 
bite, and can stand all by themselves. Too bad some doting chef props them up 
with more of that tomato sauce. As for the steamed artichoke, expect one so 
overcooked that it will taste like Pablum. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily, babies are unpredictable. Even though the iceberg lettuce on the house 
salad could be crisper, the dressing, a creamy Parmesan with celery seed, is 
terrific. That makes up for the inclusion of a cherry tomato you couldn't spear 
with a fork. And one of the house soups, cioppino, is another surprise, 
chock-full of shrimp, crab and lusty chunks of snapper. A bowl of this and the 
fine house bread makes an inexpensive light lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Pizzas are full grown, though yeasty, with plenty of bounce and an aroma of 
oak. The excellent sausage pizza (using wonderful sausage made by a local 
company called Santa Fe) has plenty of grilled mushrooms and roasted peppers; 
the shrimp pizza with virgin olive oil, herbs and provolone cheese makes me 
want to bill and coo. Only a gooey sausage calzone, oozing ricotta and mushy 
black olives, makes me cranky. The olives taste as if they come from a can. 
</P>
<P>
All pasta at Spaghettini is made fresh daily -- but not necessarily cooked with 
care. The pastas I ate at lunch were fine, served al dente with the proper 
amount of sauce. But the ones I sampled at dinner were bland, overcooked and 
drowning in sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Chicken fettuccine with seasonal vegetables is about the best -- excellent 
strips of mesquite-broiled chicken in a rich Alfredo sauce. And you can't go 
far wrong with fusilli and vine-ripened tomatoes in a cheese sauce with fresh 
basil. 
</P>
<P>
But stay clear of linguine with whole clams: The clams were flavorless and came 
sitting on top of a bowl of sticky glop. That goes double for half-moon ravioli 
stuffed with lobster and ricotta cheese: The sauce is starchy, and the filling 
tastes as if it was made by Gerber. 
</P>
<P>
The entrees, however, are mature and impressive -- the best things to eat in 
this restaurant. The meats are well grilled and seem to be first-quality. 
</P>
<P>
A mixed grill -- paillard of chicken with fresh rosemary, that wonderful 
sausage, and marinated, blackened shrimp -- comes with seasoned Swiss chard, 
firm, tender asparagus and perfectly cooked buttered pieces of carrot. 
</P>
<P>
A large, tender veal chop arrives perfectly blackened and fragrant with 
rosemary and thyme. 
</P>
<P>
Thick, juicy lamb chops, my personal favorite, are basted in extra virgin olive 
oil with oregano and garlic and taste like something you might find in a 
country house in Tuscany. Sliced, marinated sirloin steak is great too; the 
marinade is one of the best I have ever tasted. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, there are sweets, which all babies love. Top recommendation here 
would be Spaghettini mud pie, a wonderfully cloying, convoluted concoction with 
a chocolate oatmeal crust and a praline almond ice cream filling, floating on a 
pool of caramel sauce. Also worth hollering about is green apple strudel, 
served warm with whipped cream. 
</P>
<P>
For adults, there is something called an Italian kiss; it's made of Bailey's, 
steamed milk and Frangelico and it is served in a brandy snifter. I'll have to 
try that one when I grow up. 
</P>
<P>
Spaghettini is moderately priced. Appetizers are $3.25 to $7.95. Salads and 
homemade soups are $3.95 to $8.25. Brick-oven pizzas are $6.95 to $8.95. Pastas 
are $10.25 to $14.50, including soup or salad. Entrees, which include soup or 
salad and pasta, are $10.95 to $16.95. The good, reasonably priced wine list 
has many excellent California selections.

VIVE LA FRANCE! Friday July 14 brings the bicentennial celebration of Bastille 
Day, and many of Orange County's French restaurants promise gala festivities. 
The Bouzy Rouge in Newport Beach will offer a designer fashion show in the 
afternoon, an artist to sketch the guests, door prizes every half hour and 
cancan dancers (!). A methuselah of champagne (that's six liters, no less) will 
be opened to toast the evening. For reservations, call (714) 673-3440. 
</P>
<P>
At Le Biarritz in Newport Beach, chef John Sharpe promises a weeklong emphasis 
on the southwestern -- southwestern part of France, that is. Specialties will 
include a cassoulet of fava beans and several Basque specialties, priced from 
$14.95 to $19.95. Reservations: (714) 645-6700. 
</P>
<P>
La Vie en Rose in Brea will import a mime, a Maurice Chevalier-style singer 
crooning "Thank Heaven for Little Girls," a left-bank caricaturist and more of 
those cancan girls. A special five-course dinner will cost $45 per person. 
Reservations: (714) 529-8333. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon and Grant Showley, who've just returned from eating their way across 
France, will share their discoveries at Showley-Wrightson in Newport Beach July 
14 and 15. Their special Bastille Day dinners will highlight Provencal fish 
soup, hot garlic chicken salad, young veal with mustard sauce and roulade of 
chocolate with fresh raspberries. The six-course dinner, with wines from 
Burgundy and Champagne, will cost $65, including tip and tax. Reservations: 
(714) 760-9700. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach's Chanteclair will be transformed into a French marketplace, with 
revelry beginning at 4 p.m. July 14. For $10, guests can sip wine and sample 
fare a la Francaise: cheeses, pates, sausages, pasta, seafood, grilled chicken 
and desserts, all to the accompaniment of a French accordionist. And, yes, 
there will be cancan dancers. 
</P>
<P>
Le Meridien Hotel in Newport Beach will commemorate the French Revolution with 
a bal populaire dinner-dance on the 15th at 7 p.m. in the Cafe/Bistro. The tab: 
$55 per person will cover a four-course, gourmet French dinner, wine, music and 
dancing. On the 16th, the hotel presents a bicentennial brunch in the Cafe from 
10:30 to 2 p.m., tabbed at $23 per person ($30 with champagne). An exhibit of 
more than 50 works by French artist Guy Buffet, portraying scenes from the 
French Revolution, will be on display throughout the hotel. Reservations: (714) 
476-2001, Ext. 2194. 
</P>
<P>
La Brasserie in Orange will celebrate the holiday by unveiling a new, 500-label 
wine list with numerous rare vintages, plus a new lunch and dinner menu. 
</P>
<P>
But hey, what about our July holiday? Johnny Reb's Southern Smokehouse in 
Anaheim makes Independence Day entertaining easy with take-out cold packs (to 
heat on the barbie or in the oven) or ready-to-serve hot packs. Beef ribs, 
barbecued chicken, pork ribs and pick-two combos come with barbecued pinto 
beans, Southern slaw, tater salad, corn bread and peach cobbler. They're priced 
from $49.95 (for four hongry folks) to $104.95 (for 12). Phone (714) 535-7322. 
</P>
<P>
DINNER EPICENTER: We knew it all along, but Nation's "Restaurant News" confirms 
that households in Orange County spend more in restaurants than those in Los 
Angeles. We're third in the nation, behind San Francisco and Boston. 
</P>
<P>
'ROUND AND ABOUT: Hemingways in Newport Beach is in escrow, but the prospective 
owners don't plan to change the name or the dining concept . . . John Rader, 
whom many remember from Chanteclair and the Balboa Bay Club, is new GM at 
Bistango in Newport Beach . . . Rick and Diane Buford (he publishes Wine Line 
and will be remembered from the Hobbit, Alfredo's and the Golden Truffle) take 
over the Black Sheep Bistro in Tustin from Tom Harrison and Maribeth Seaton, as 
of July 14. 
</P>
<P>
ON THE MOVE: After 20 years in its Santa Ana location, Nieuport 17 will move to 
Tustin after the first of the year. The new restaurant is under construction in 
Lafayette Plaza at Newport Avenue and Irvine Boulevard . . . Showley-Wrightson 
will relocate in a new, larger spot with banquet facilities, just three-fourths 
of a mile away in Newport Beach. A February opening is planned . . . 
Negotiations are under way for J.J. Shaw to move JJ's Bistro from Dana Point to 
the site now occupied by Gandhi in South Coast Village, and for Gandhi to move 
around the corner to the spot vacated by the Belgian Waffle Inn . . . A new 
Royal Thai is abuilding in Dana Point, targeted for an end-of-the-year opening. 
</P>
<P>
LEGALITIES: Delaney's Restaurants and its owner, Francis Delaney, have filed 
for protection from creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. The chain has agreed to 
be acquired by an unnamed corporation . . . Gemmell's in Costa Mesa also has 
filed under Chapter 11 bankruptcy laws. The problem, according to Byron 
Gemmell, is with payroll taxes, not purveyors, "but we had no choice but to 
file." The restaurant will remain open "while we restructure and pay off." 
</P>
<P>
NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY: Ristorante Italiano Primavera is the new bambino on the 
block across from Mile Square Park in Fountain Valley. A trio of owners -- 
Piero Intotero, Michael McCord and chef Angelo Juliano -- will herald their 
opening all during July with a four-course special dinner. The $15.95 repast 
includes an entree of breast of chicken and prawns in white wine sauce or veal 
scallop with eggplant, tomato sauce and mozzarella. 
</P>
<P>
At Tom Brown's Bicycle Cafe in Dana Point, the only "smoking section" is on the 
patio outside. The moderately priced restaurant, next door to a health club at 
Del Prado Avenue and Amber Lantern Street, accents the healthy and offers a 
separate vegetarian menu. John Hicks is chef. 
</P>
<P>
The Restaurant at Cameron Court in Santa Ana boasts a new seafood bar in its 
Cameron Deli. Offerings include oysters and clams on the half shell, smoked 
fish and sea mussels. 
</P>
<P>
Capers, a today-look remodel of the old Dana Trader in Dana Point, now serves 
lunch and Sunday brunch, with the emphasis on California freshness. Owners 
Jules Marine and Patrick Dudley enhance the scene with changing exhibits by 
contemporary artists. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Cano and Fred LeFrank have opened Salud at Beach Boulevard and Warner 
Avenue in Huntington Beach. They're serving Mayan, Mexican and Yucatan . . . 
Meanwhile, Cano's in Newport Beach has launched a sit-down, four-course prix 
fixe Sunday brunch, served from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. The price: $11.95. 
</P>
<P>
AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO MISS NEW ORLEANS? Then head on down to the 
Irvine Hilton and Towers and tune up for the weekend with "TGIF and All that 
Jazz-Dixie Style" parties every Friday from 4:30 to 8:30 on the hotel's 
pool-side patio. Southern delicacies (crocodile meat and crayfish, for 
instance) and such drinks as Cajun martinis and Dixie beer are served to the 
accompaniment of the 20th-Century Jazz Band. 
</P>
<P>
In the same location on Saturdays, the hotel offers up Texas-style Barbecue 
Hoe-Downs -- steaks, ribs, grilled fish, biscuits and cornbread -- all to the 
tune of toe-tapping country music. Adults, $18.95; children under 12, $8.95. 
Reservations: (714) 863-3111.

The following are summaries of recent Times restaurant reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Gemmell's, 3000 Bristol St., Costa Mesa. (714) 751-1074. Open Mondays through 
Fridays 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., Mondays through Saturdays 6 to 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 You've seen it all before: the quiet, understated rooms, the tables draped 
like ballroom gowns, the silver domes, the brandy cart. At Gemmell's, thank 
heaven, it all makes sense. Treat yourself to an evening here, feasting on such 
specialties as goose liver wrapped in blackened cabbage, lobster in Sauteres, 
veal chop with morels. Chef Byron Gemmell has a carefully designed menu with 
nearly every item on it worthy of praise. Prepare to pay handsomely for the 
privilege of praising. 
</P>
<P>
McCormick and Schmick, 2000 Main St., Irvine. (714) 756-0505. Open Mondays 
through Fridays 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., Saturdays 5 p.m. to 11 p.m., Sundays 5 p.m. 
to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 McCormick and Schmick is the latest member of an exclusive chain that started 
in the Pacific Northwest, a slick, muscular operation specializing in fresh 
seafoods, and the food is terrific. Oysters like Quilicene, Olympia, Golden 
Mantle, and Skookum taste as if they have just been dragged from the sea. Fish 
like Copper River salmon in cream with bay scallops, or sea bass with Jamaican 
spices, are good enough to make a grown man weep. Non-fish eaters can feast on 
marinated chicken, or Cajun cheeseburgers. Head of the class. 
</P>
<P>
China Palms, Fullerton Metro Center, 104 W. Orangethorpe Ave., Fullerton. (714) 
526-2196. Open daily from 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Ling put a palm tree in the middle of his restaurant, an airy, ultra- 
modern dining room in Fullerton's spanking new Metro Center. But there is 
nothing tropical about the solid pan-Chinese food he serves, made in one of the 
most accomplished Chinese kitchens around. Cold dishes, dumplings and 
first-rate soups make perfect beginnings. Honey-glazed bananas, plunged 
steaming into an ice-filled bowl tableside, make perfect endings. The goodies 
you can have in between are too numerous to mention. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrantelli, 25001 Dana Point Harbor Drive, Dana Point. (714) 493-1401. Open 
Mondays through Fridays 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., Sundays through Thursdays 5:30 
to 10, Fridays and Saturdays till 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrantelli is an engaging dockside pasta house that doesn't take a lot of 
chances but offers solid meals. The house antipasto, a stunning palette of 
color and taste, gives an idea of the type of effort the kitchen puts in with 
its limited skill. Pastas are fine, too, made fresh daily by Pasta Mia and 
embellished with a variety of good sauces. But the veal dishes are tasteless, 
and main courses are often sweet and cloying. 
</P>
<P>
Yankee Tavern, 333 Bayside Drive, Newport Beach. (714) 675 5333. Open nightly 
5:30 to midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who know Yankee Tavern owner Hans Prager as proprietor of the Ritz may 
be surprised to see him in this urban roadhouse, catering to a crowd hungry for 
low prices, speedy service and an unpretentious menu. The food here is almost 
unfailingly good, though, in a cafeteria-style manner. Meat loaf, pot pie, lamb 
shanks and fresh seafoods are featured along with many New England style dishes 
such as Little Neck clams, seafood stew and blueberry cobbler. Good fun. 
</P>
<P>
Kachina, 222 Forest Ave., Laguna Beach. (714) 497-5546. Open nightly from 5:30 
to 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Kachina is new, but it already may be the county's best restaurant. Named for 
an American Indian doll of the Southwest, the restaurant serves food that is 
rare and exotic -- edible art. David Wilhelm, late of Pave and the El Torito 
Grill, has composed a menu featuring some of the most imaginative, intelligent 
cooking this side of the Twilight Zone, full of sumptuous tastes and 
color-splashed textures. Run, don't walk, to taste their green corn tamale, 
honey-glazed pork and celestial chocolate bread pudding. And go early. 
</P>
<P>
Agostino's, 34700 Coast Highway, Capistrano Beach. (714) 661-8266. Open 
Tuesdays through Sundays noon to 3 and 5 to 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Entirely new management is in place at this Chicago-style Italian restaurant, 
famous for its homemade sausage and romantic beach view. Much of the menu, 
including the tableside Caesar and the rich, creamy pastas, is the same as it 
was when the place was called Sabatino's. But Agostino already has added many 
seafood dishes including mussels, fresh salmon, and calamari. The bar is as 
good a hangout as you'll find on Capo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Tuttomare, 545 Newport Center Drive, Newport Beach. (714) 640-6333. Open 
Mondays through Thursdays 11 a.m. to 11 p.m.; Fridays 11 to midnight; Saturdays 
11:30 to midnight; Sundays 5 to 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Service is fluid and solicitous at this smart, stunning restaurant, located in 
the building that used to house the Savannah Grill, but the kitchen is having 
its ups and downs. Wonderful, yeasty foccaccia bread served with virgin olive 
oil and the fine grilled seafoods are some of the ups. Naked vegetables and 
bland pasta dishes are some of the downs. Lombata di vitello, veal chop with 
fontina and prosciutto, is one reason to go back for a second look.

ANGELS TAKE AIR OUT OF METRODOME, TWINS IN 10-3 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MINNEAPOLIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Minnesota Twins' noisy fans like to call it the Thunderdome. And every 
pitcher in the league knows it's often referred to as the Homerdome. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Angels didn't have to hit any home runs to bring peace and quiet 
to the Metrodome Thursday night. Brian Downing did slug one out in the ninth 
inning, but the Angels already had 14 hits by then, were feeling quite at home 
in the Dome and were well on their way to a 10-3 rout of the Twins before a 
crowd of 22,422. 
</P>
<P>
The weather outside was almost frightful -- 80 degrees with winds gusting to 30 
m.p.h. -- but under this inflated roof, the Angels were happily inflating their 
batting averages and runs batted in totals. 
</P>
<P>
It used to be that the Angels hated to play in this cloth-topped edifice. They 
lost their last four games here last season, but considering the kinds of 
weather they've faced on the road this season, they'd rather play the Twins in 
the Metrodome than face the elements. 
</P>
<P>
After all, they've been rained out five times already and were almost rained 
out and blown out of this week's two-game trip to Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to come into a place knowing you'll be dry and the wind won't be 
blowing 1,000 m.p.h.," Manager Doug Rader said. 
</P>
<P>
And if you make your living with a bat, it's nice to play in a facility where 
the ball skips across the carpet like a quarter on a smooth pond and sails 
through the still, dry air as if it's under its own power. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask Downing. Or Tony Armas. Or Jack Howell. Or Johnny Ray. To name a few. 
</P>
<P>
Downing had four hits, drove in four runs and scored three times. Armas had 
three hits and an RBI. Howell was two for three with two RBIs. And Ray had 
three hits and scored twice. 
</P>
<P>
Downing, who boosted his average to .307 and his homer total to eight, with 31 
RBIs, said he is swinging the bat as well as he ever has in a career that spans 
17 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just one of those nights when you go up there feeling in control, 
feeling really great," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That's probably not exactly how Twin starter Mike Dyer would describe his 
feelings on this evening. Twin Manager Tom Kelly decided to have the 
22-year-old right-hander, recalled Wednesday from triple-A Portland, make his 
major league debut instead of starting Francisco Oliveras, who has spent nine 
seasons in the minors. By the sixth inning, however, both had come . . . and 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
Dyer failed to get an out in the third and left after yielding six hits and six 
runs. Oliveras fared slightly better, giving up seven hits and "just" three 
runs in 3 2/3 innings of work. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels scored twice in the second inning on two singles, two walks and a 
wild pitch. They scored four runs in the third on five hits and a walk, two 
more in the fifth on three hits and a walk, and solo runs in the sixth and 
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Angel starter Mike Witt (6-7) thrived in the controlled environment, picking up 
his third victory in as many outings. He survived a shaky second inning -- when 
he gave up three hits but only one run due to the fact that Randy Bush lined 
into a double play with two on and none out -- but he settled down to allow 
just two hits in the next five innings. 
</P>
<P>
Witt tired in the eighth, however, hanging a curve that Tim Laudner hit into 
the left-field seats and giving up two more hits and one more run before giving 
way to Rich Monteleone, who pitched a 1-2-3 ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Witt, who had losses in four of five starts before embarking on this 
mini-winning streak, continues to regain his form and, maybe just as important 
in Rader's mind, his confidence and composure. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike threw really well," Rader said. "He really made just the one bad pitch to 
Laudner. I'm very happy to see him steadily regaining his confidence. It's 
evident in the way he projects himself on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
"That's something you can't fake if you don't genuinely feel it. It's something 
that's very difficult to mask." 
</P>
<P>
Witt isn't as worried about how he looks on the mound as he is about how long 
he lasts out there. This time out, he stuck around for eight innings. And he 
was the first to point out that an eight-run lead after five innings played a 
significant role in his longevity. 
</P>
<P>
"My curve wasn't as good as last time out, but it was good enough for an 
eight-run lead," he said. "But I'm pitching well and I still would have felt 
good about that if we had lost, 3-1. Anytime you win three in a row, you're 
confidence is going to be up." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, who managed a total of just three runs in the two games in 
Cleveland, should have a bit of offensive momentum going after this one, but 
you can't save runs for tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
"You start over every day, and a lot of it has to do with the opposing 
pitcher," Downing said. "What we've got to do is break out against 
left-handers." 
</P>
<P>
They'll have plenty of chances soon. The Angels, 13-15 against left-handed 
starters, will face at least two in the next three days. And Kelly is 
considering starting southpaw Frank Viola Sunday, which would make three in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
So all this fun in the Dome could turn into a case of the indoor blues in a 
hurry for the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
With Claudell Washington still out because of a shin infection, Dick Schofield 
was in the leadoff spot for the fourth consecutive game Thursday night. 
Schofield is hitting just .212, but Manager Doug Rader said he thinks that 
Schofield is the next best choice after Washington to hit in the No. 1 
position, even though Brian Downing has considerable experience batting 
leadoff. "I don't want to hit Brian there and I don't want to hit Devon (White) 
there, and there aren't many alternatives after that," Rader said. "I think 
Brian is better-suited down in the RBI situations. And besides, it's good for 
Dick. It's good for him to learn how to go about doing it." Schofield has had 
five hits in 19 at-bats during the last four games. "I have been swinging the 
bat better the last week, but I take pretty much the same approach whether I'm 
hitting ninth, first, third or fifth," he said. "But anytime you're struggling 
and they put you in a position where you know you'll get four or five at-bats a 
game, it certainly helps your confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Schofield was almost knocked out -- literally -- of the lineup before Thursday 
night's game when Jim Eppard, just recalled from triple-A Edmonton, hit him in 
the back of the head with a line drive during batting practice. Schofield, who 
didn't see the ball but spun around when he heard someone yell, "Look out!," 
got his hand up, and the ball struck him in the right thumb and the back of his 
head. "That doesn't say much about Ep's power," Rader quipped. "He didn't even 
knock him down." . . . When trainer Rick Smith leisurely jogged out to 
Schofield's aid, Rader said, "If I ever get hurt, tell them to send a trash 
truck out there to help me. It'd be faster than Smitty." 
</P>
<P>
The Perils of Pitching Dept.: In the ninth inning, Chili Davis drilled a line 
drive off the left knee of Randy St. Claire, sending the Twin right-hander 
sprawling. The ball ricocheted back past catcher Tim Laudner. "That's one of 
two balls I've hit hard all year," Davis said. "But I'd rather hit the ball 
where (Downing, who homered to deep right-center) did. I'd rather trot than 
watch a guy get hurt." St. Claire, who left the game with a bruised knee, will 
have X-rays taken today.

PUNTS, KICKS BIGGEST HIT WITH SOVIET FANS IN FOOTBALL'S DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REMNICK, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MOSCOW 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few years down the road, when Joe Montana is quarterbacking the "Moscow Evil 
Empires" and Tex Schramm is general manager of the "Irkutsk Igloos," they will 
look back on this day and remember with reverence how two squads of Oklahoma 
high-school boys played some fine American-style football in Dynamo Stadium 
Wednesday night, the first-ever game in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The boys played their hearts out. And the crowd loved it, though they seemed a 
bit confused. They were nonplussed by the touchdowns, which seemed to them 
random and obscure, but loved the great arc of the kicks and punts. "I think 
that's their soccer background coming into play," said Matt Cook, a quarterback 
for the eastern all-star squad, the Boomers. "It's hard to imagine a place 
where the highlight is the extra points." 
</P>
<P>
The idea of bringing U.S. football to a soccer-mad country like the U.S.S.R. 
started a couple of years back when Dan Crookham, the athletic director at 
Tulsa's Rogers High School, was drinking some "iced teas" with some buddies and 
watching the Dallas Cowboys play the Chicago Bears in London's Wembley Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that's a hell of a thing," one of them said, pointing at the William (The 
Refrigerator) Perry's revision of English country manners. 
</P>
<P>
"Wouldn't that be something to bring our boys over to London," said another. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, how about Russia?" came the answer, and Crookham, a Sooner Quixote 
braced with iced tea and ambition, set things in motion. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing the Russians wanted to know from us was, 'How many players are 
gonna get killed?' Swear to God. I said, 'The only one who gets killed in 
Oklahoma high-school football is the coach -- if he doesn't win.' " Crookham 
spoke Wednesday night as he stood on the sidelines watching his dream race up 
and down the artificial turf in front of a crowd estimated between 8,000 and 
10,000. 
</P>
<P>
In a tale of bureaucratic woe consistent with any native Muscovite's daily 
experience, it took about a year for Crookham to get the right person on the 
phone. The Oklahomans finally got some help from the state commission on sports 
and the country's rugby association. But they had a lot of explaining to do. 
</P>
<P>
"The Russians didn't know anything much about the game except that large people 
were involved," Crookham said. "They were extremely concerned about broken 
bones." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets cut themselves a sweetheart deal: the Americans would pay their own 
way for games in Moscow, Tallinn and Leningrad, and the Soviets would take 100 
percent of the gate. Tickets were sold for four rubles apiece. "What the heck," 
said Crookham, who has no future as a labor negotiator. "We said, 'Let's go.' " 
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the trip is $600,000 and each player had to come up with his 
own expenses, which are steep -- $2,800 apiece. A few of the less well-to-do 
players managed to make it here with the help of bake sales and car washes, but 
many didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival the players and coaches were somewhat less than dazzled by 
Moscow's culinary offerings. No chicken-fried steak on the menu. The first meal 
was lumpy oatmeal and lukewarm Pepsi. The next was an alleged form of bird 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"They said it was chicken but it tasted like pigeon," said Jeff Dudley, a 
slight split end from Tulsa. "Their food's got a weird taste, and my stomach 
can't handle it." 
</P>
<P>
Moscow Radio has been advertising the games here and in Tallinn and Leningrad 
for days, and a small crowd showed up Tuesday for practice. The most 
enthusiastic among them was a group of six teen-agers from Chelyabinsk, a town 
1,200 miles to the southeast. They are members of the country's first and only 
U.S.-style football club. For equipment they have been using motorcycle helmets 
with soldered iron crossbars, waterproof life vests, hockey pads and a rugby 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
"We came all the way here to Moscow just to see this," said the group 
president, Alexander Kovrigin. "We'd seen a few film clips on pirated 
videocassettes, but not much. When I was in the Marines, I tried to play a 
little bit just to keep my legs from turning to stone. They say people get 
murdered in American football, but that's all ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
After practice, the Oklahomans gave the boys from Chelyabinsk a couple of 
footballs. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball and golf have already made appearances in the Soviet Union, and 
neither one has taken hold. The Japanese are promising to build a ball yard and 
Armand Hammer, the American industrialist and longtime Soviet friend, says he 
wants to build a first-class golf course, but the Soviets themselves take all 
this with a certain bemused resignation. They have their own games in case 
anyone hasn't noticed. 
</P>
<P>
It was clear at game time Wednesday night that not a soul in the crowd -- save 
the few U.S. students studying at universities around Moscow -- knew a red dog 
from a hot dog, but they were intent on whooping it up in fine Sooner style. 
Although both sides had only a week to prepare and the offenses were running on 
about a dozen set plays, there was enough breakaway action to keep everyone 
interested. 
</P>
<P>
The Boomers, if you must know, kicked the Stars around pretty good, winning, 
28-6, with a triple reverse here and an on-the-run bomb there. But the crowd 
seemed happiest when anarchy was unleashed upon the field in the form of a 
fumble or a punt. 
</P>
<P>
"It all looks like a lot of running around to me. I can't quite make it out but 
it's fun," said one spectator, Sergei Dokin. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of the fans wore their American finery. Yuri Bogomolov wore a T-shirt 
reading "He's tan. He's rested. And he's back. Nixon in '88." 
</P>
<P>
"I hear Nixon loved football," he said, "and I do too."

DODGERS MAKE FOUR ERRORS, HELP PADRES SWEEP SERIES, 5-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those Dodger observers who have been whispering, "What next?" were granted an 
answer Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Next: The defense. 
</P>
<P>
A team that had committed fewer errors than all but two other National League 
teams committed four, including two in one game-costing inning, and lost, 5-3, 
to the San Diego Padres before 36,128 fans at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did the Padres sweep this three-game series, they ultimately made the 
Dodgers look like an old broom in doing it. The Dodgers, after making only 59 
errors in their first 76 games -- 14 fewer errors than the Padres had made -- 
completely fell apart during a three-run Padre fourth inning that eventually 
broke Fernando Valenzuela's personal four-game win streak. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Hamilton, who committed one of the errors when he dropped a throw at third 
base, later recalled the play. 
</P>
<P>
"There was my play, there were other plays. . . . It's all compounding, and we 
can't figure it out," he said. "Maybe we're trying too hard to figure it out. 
Maybe we're racking our brains too much." 
</P>
<P>
With the score 1-1, the fourth inning began rather routinely, Tony Gwynn 
getting a single to left off Valenzuela. Jack Clark then walked, something he 
had done 66 times this year, more than anyone in the league. 
</P>
<P>
But Chris James laid down a sacrifice bunt that appeared merely to sacrifice 
the Padres' chances, as Valenzuela grabbed the ball and threw to third baseman 
Hamilton to force Gwynn. 
</P>
<P>
Except Hamilton dropped the throw. No sun, no funny spin, no real excuses. 
</P>
<P>
"I just dropped it," Hamilton said. "It hit the heel of my glove and bounced 
out." 
</P>
<P>
With the bases loaded, up stepped Garry Templeton, who hit a simple grounder to 
Hamilton, who made the simple throw to catcher Mike Scioscia to force Gwynn at 
the plate. With one out, everything seemed routine again. 
</P>
<P>
For about two minutes. Six pitches later, on a full count, Valenzuela walked 
Benito Santiago, who does not lead anybody in walks this year. In fact, it was 
only the eighth walk he has drawn in 233 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
"That was my fault, my walk, you can't have that," said Valenzuela, who fell to 
4-6 even though his earned-run average dropped from 4.15 to 3.92. In seven 
innings, he gave up only one earned run on eight hits. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, it was only one earned run, but I put the men on base that caused the 
run," Valenzuela said. "Tonight is not the best I can do, or the best we can 
do." 
</P>
<P>
But wait, it got worse. Shortly after Clark trotted home with the Padres' first 
run of the inning on the walk, Shawn Abner followed with a double-play ground 
ball to shortstop Alfredo Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin made the quick toss to second baseman Mariano Duncan, who made a nice 
pivot, a nice release -- but the ball went into the dirt, scooting underneath 
first baseman Eddie Murray's glove. 
</P>
<P>
"A bad throw, I blame it on nothing," said Duncan, who was starting in place of 
the injured Willie Randolph, although Randolph later pinch-hit in the seventh 
inning despite a sore hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
James had already scored on Abner's grounder, and Templeton took advantage of 
the Duncan's error to score another run. After Padre starter and winner Dennis 
Rasmussen added a single to move Abner to third, Valenzuela escaped the mess 
when Bip Roberts flied out. 
</P>
<P>
But the damage had been done. This fourth straight loss equals the Dodgers' 
season high, a streak that they had achieved three times. With the National 
League West-leading San Francisco Giants winning, the Dodgers fell 9 1/2 games 
out of first place. Now, the only thing between last year's World Series 
champions and the basement are the Atlanta Braves, for whom the Dodgers are 
certainly thankful. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Fred Claire, Dodger vice president, gave the first official indication that the 
Dodgers might be close to finding a center fielder when he praised Jose 
Gonzalez. Going into the game, Gonzalez was on an eight-game hitting streak, 
with 11 hits in his last 23 at-bats (.478), all of which had improved his 
part-time average to .352. Then against San Diego Thursday night, he singled in 
the fourth inning and singled again in the sixth inning to drive in a run. He 
also has made several excellent fielding plays in the past few days as a 
starting right fielder and center fielder. "One thing that has happened to 
hearten me is that the opportunity has been there for Jose, and he has come 
through," Claire said. "He has become a good example of the overall philosophy 
of the organization, to develop our own talent. He hasn't been spotlighted that 
much, but he is showing an ability to step in there and play every day, an 
ability to play center field at the major league level. The only thing he has 
not shown us is power (no homers, only two extra base hits in his first 25 
games), but we know he has that. And he has shown us so much more. We have been 
very impressed." 
</P>
<P>
If Gonzalez still proves not to be the answer, a couple of other prospects have 
surfaced, according to league scouts. They say the Dodgers are looking at, 
among others, Milwaukee's Gary Sheffield and Glenn Braggs, and the Pittsburgh 
Pirates' Barry Bonds. Sheffield is the unhappy Brewer rookie shortstop who can 
also play outfield. He is hitting .265 with four homers and 27 RBIS and has 
good speed. Braggs, the Brewer left fielder, is hitting .269 with 11 homers and 
40 RBIs. Bonds, meanwhile, visited Dodger Stadium during his day off Thursday 
after the Pirates arrived in town to play the Dodgers in a weekend series 
beginning today. "Talk to me about that tomorrow, this is my vacation day," 
Bonds said about any interest he might have in the Dodgers. He is hitting .244 
with 10 homers and 28 RBIs. Pitchers Tim Leary or Tim Belcher probably would be 
involved in any trade the Dodgers make. 
</P>
<P>
Claire said that he was satisfied with Belcher's attitude after the pitcher's 
early Wednesday morning shouting match in the Dodger dugout with umpire Ed 
Montague.

USC HIRES STANLEY TO COACH WOMEN; 
</P>
<P>
SHE WON 3 U.S. BASKETBALL TITLES WHILE AT OLD DOMINION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
USC announced Thursday that Marianne Stanley, who coached Old Dominion 
University to three national titles, has been hired to coach the Trojan women's 
basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley, 35, has most recently coached at the University of Pennsylvania, where 
she compiled a two-year record of 11-41. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley was a two-time All-American point guard at Immaculata College, which in 
the 1970s was a power in the defunct Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics for 
Women. She has melded her intense, aggressive playing style with her coaching 
philosophy and is regarded as one of women's basketball's leading coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the highlights of my career, I'm thrilled," Stanley said at a 
news conference at the school. She said she met briefly with some of the 
players and is looking forward to starting work. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a great deal of work to be done," she said. "I looked at that 
schedule and I think that's probably Hollywood's version of a death march. But 
this team will not back down from any challenge, I can promise you that. We are 
going to hit the ground with our feet flying." 
</P>
<P>
Stanley will leave today to begin recruiting, which officially starts July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley replaces Linda Sharp, who resigned May 24 after 12 years at USC to 
coach the women's basketball team at Southwest Texas State. Stanley said she is 
bringing to USC her longtime assistant, Barbara Thaxton. Thaxton worked with 
Stanley for six years at Old Dominion and followed her to Penn. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Williams, a USC assistant for six years, has been retained by Stanley. 
</P>
<P>
Williams was one of the candidates for the position and was given "serious 
consideration," according to Barbara Hedges, associate athletic director. Two 
of the final four candidates withdrew their names, leaving Williams and 
Stanley. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley reportedly turned down a coaching job last month at the University of 
Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
USC won consecutive National Collegiate Athletic Assn. titles in 1983 and 1984, 
but the program has declined since. Last season, the Trojans were 12-16. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley, who has a record of 280-100, is expected to produce a disciplined, 
defensive-minded team, in contrast to USC's usual free-wheeling style of play. 
</P>
<P>
"I like a running style," Stanley said. "But more than that, I'm 
defense-oriented. All my teams have been defensive first." 
</P>
<P>
She said her philosophy might be summed up by a line from the film, "Stand by 
Me," a story of the get-tough high school principal, Joe Clark. "He says, 
'Discipline is not the enemy of enthusiasm.' I like that," Stanley said. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley's teams at Old Dominion won the AIAW title in 1979 and 1980 and the 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. title in 1985. Old Dominion also won the 
women's NIT. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, Old Dominion was put on two years' probation by the AIAW for a 
recruiting violation. Stanley was found to have visited the home of a recruit, 
a violation of AIAW rules. Under the terms of the probation, no university 
funds could be used for recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley is a two-time national coach of the year and has extensive 
international coaching experience. Among the players she has coached are former 
Olympians Nancy Lieberman and Anne Donovan. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley said that she thrives on pressure and is looking forward to the 
challenge of rebuilding USC's program. 
</P>
<P>
"Penn was pretty much a pressure-free situation," she said. "One of the things 
I've learned about me is that I don't like that kind of situation. I am an 
extremely competitive person. I like to be in a pressure situation." 
</P>
<P>
Stanley was inadvertently put under pressure Thursday as her plane was delayed 
a few hours and she nearly missed her news conference. She was rushed from LAX 
to USC and made this discovery: "I don't think I like freeways."

Calling for safeguards against NBA raids on its players, a Yugoslav basketball 
team denied center Dino Radja permission to play for the Boston Celtics, who 
drafted him earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
Bozidar Maljkovic, Radja's coach on the Jugoplastika team, said, "It would be a 
catastrophe for our basketball" if the Yugoslav federation did not adopt rules 
against allowing its best players to leave. He said no players younger than 26 
should be allowed to sign with U.S. teams. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers drafted another Yugoslav, Vlade Divac, and he has been given 
permission by his country's government to join them. Also reportedly 
negotiating with NBA teams are Yugoslavia's star guard, Drazen Petrovic, and 
center Stojko Vrankovic. Petrovic, who currently plays for Real Madrid in 
Spain, was drafted by the Portland Trail Blazers in 1986, and Vrankovic was 
chosen by the Celtics the same year.

NEWSWIRE: WASHBURN IS BANNED FOR LIFE BY NBA FOR DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chris Washburn of the Atlanta Hawks became the sixth player to be banned for 
life by the National Basketball Assn. under the league's anti-drug agreement, 
after a relapse, the league said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Washburn was suspended without pay by the NBA on Sept. 26, 1988, after his 
third substance-abuse relapse and was returned to the league's rehabilitation 
center in Van Nuys. He did not play last season. 
</P>
<P>
Washburn, a 6-foot 11-inch center/forward, may appeal his suspension after two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
John Drew, who played for the Hawks and the Utah Jazz, was the first player 
banned for life under the anti-drug agreement, in January 1986. The next month, 
it was Micheal Ray Richardson of the New Jersey Nets, and in January 1987, they 
were joined by Lewis Lloyd and Mitchell Wiggins of the Houston Rockets. Duane 
Washington of the New Jersey Nets received the same punishment in September 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Washburn's contract was terminated, which meant he lost at least $1.6 million.

CANSECO HAS POWER OUTAGE, BUT HIS INJURED WRIST PASSES ITS FIRST TEST

The fans marveled as Jose Canseco drove several balls far beyond the left-field 
fence in batting practice Wednesday night, then cheered him in each of his four 
at-bats during the game, expecting the same. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he didn't hit a ball out of the infield, managing only a scratch hit. 
</P>
<P>
The appearance of the Oakland Athletics' outfielder, most valuable player in 
the American League last season, began his second rehabilitation trip this 
season in Huntsville, where he starred for part of the 1985 season with the 
Stars of the Class AA Southern League. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco, hitting third as the designated hitter, grounded to the pitcher in the 
first inning of Huntsville's 4-3 loss to Greenville, S.C. In the fourth, with 
no one on, he beat out a hit to deep shortstop. The next inning, with runners 
on first and second, he popped up to first base, and in the eighth, with none 
on, he struck out. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Canseco said, his left wrist felt fine. He hurt it in spring 
training and reinjured it May 7 in the second game of an earlier rehabilitation 
trip to Huntsville. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night's game was rained out.

ONCE AGAIN, MCENROE OVERCOMES ALL OBSTACLES;

As usual, John McEnroe had plenty to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe, who came from two sets down to win in the first round, overcame his 
own inconsistency, a run-in with the umpire, and Richey Reneberg, 6-3, 3-6, 
6-3, 7-5, Thursday to advance to the third round at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to be easy," McEnroe said. "When people play me, they really 
want to do well. I'm just happy I won. That's the important thing. 
</P>
<P>
"He tried hard, I tried hard. He had games where he got hot. I had games where 
I got hot. I just got hotter at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
On the women's side, third-seeded Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina and 
fifth-seeded Zina Garrison weren't as fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
Ros Fairbank of South Africa, a solid grass-court player, beat Sabatini, who is 
more at home on clay, 6-4, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Louise Field of Australia, ranked 121st in the world, blew a 5-0 lead in the 
third set before ousting Garrison, 1-6, 6-2, 7-5, on her fifth match point. 
</P>
<P>
"The chances were there," Garrison said. "I just didn't take them. It's not 
like she blew me off the court." 
</P>
<P>
Garrison dominated play before slumping in the second set. She rallied from 
five games down to tie it, 5-5, in the final set and survived a fourth match 
point when Field served her eighth double-fault in the 10th game. 
</P>
<P>
But Field broke Garrison and then served out the match, winning on her fifth 
match point with a backhand volley. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe, seeded fifth, lost five straight games as Reneberg wrapped up the 
second set and took a 1-0 lead in the third on McEnroe's fifth of eight double 
faults. 
</P>
<P>
Upset at losing his serve, McEnroe tossed his racket during the changeover. 
When umpire Bruno Rebeuh of France gave him a code warning for racket abuse, 
McEnroe exploded. 
</P>
<P>
"That took a lot of guts," McEnroe yelled at Rebeuh. "An excellent decision. I 
bet it says in the rule book that if he throws his racket, call racket abuse. 
An excellent choice." 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe was able to keep his temper in check the rest of the way and turned his 
game around just when it looked as if he might be eliminated in the second 
round at Wimbledon for the second year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
With Reneberg leading, 3-2 and 40-0, in the third set, McEnroe battled back to 
send the game to deuce four times, then broke to even the match when Reneberg 
hit a volley long. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe held serve, broke at love for a 5-3 lead and served out the set on his 
fifth of eight aces, then broke in the eighth and 11th games of the fourth set. 
He served out the match at love, winning on a backhand volley. 
</P>
<P>
In other men's matches, third-seeded Boris Becker of West Germany defeated 
Richard Matuszewski, 6-3, 7-5, 6-4; No. 13 Aaron Krickstein beat Javier Frana 
of Argentina, 4-6, 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7-5), 7-5, in the completion of a match 
suspended by darkness Wednesday; No. 16 Amos Mansdorf of Israel downed Eric 
Jelen of West Germany, 4-6, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2; No. 15 Mikael Pernfors of 
Sweden was upset by Peter Lundgren, another Swede, 7-6 (7-4), 6-2, 6-4; 
seventh-seeded Miloslav Mecir of Czechoslovakia rallied to eliminate Australian 
Mark Kratzmann, 6-7 (7-5), 4-6, 6-1, 7-5, 7-5, and fourth-seeded Mats Wilander 
ousted Karel Novacek of Czechoslovakia, 6-3, 6-0, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
In a match halted by rain, second-seeded Stefan Edberg of Sweden was leading 
Todd Woodbridge of Australia, 6-4, 6-4, 1-6. The match between ninth-seeded 
Michael Chang and Ronald Agenor of Haiti was postponed until today. 
</P>
<P>
In other women's matches, fourth-seeded Chris Evert rallied from a 5-1 deficit 
in the first set to defeat Hu Na, 7-5, 6-1; seventh-seeded Arantxa Sanchez of 
Spain beat Julie Halard of France, 6-4, 6-3; ninth-seeded Natalia Zvereva of 
the Soviet Union beat Eva Paff of West Germany, 6-2, 6-3; Mary Joe Fernandez 
ousted Louise Allen, 6-4, 6-1; No. 15 Lori McNeil beat Martina Pawlik of West 
Germany, 6-1, 6-3, and No. 14 Hana Mandlikova of Australia downed Catherine 
Suire of France, 6-1, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Martina Navratilova rallied to even her match with Kristine 
Radford of Australia, 3-6, 6-3, before it was halted by rain.

SEAHAWK OIL REDUCES DEBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seahawk Oil International Inc. of Irvine was incorrectly characterized in a 
June 21 story as "debt-ridden" and "unable to pay its debts." In fact, the 
company has reduced its long-term debt to about $1.5 million by the end of 1988 
from $7.3 million three years earlier, and has missed no required debt 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Seahawk has not bought four oil companies in the last five years 
and sold off its reserves, as the story reported. The firm has acquired only 
one other company and continues to produce its reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Seahawk recently arranged to sell all of its domestic oil and gas properties 
for $4.5 million. After retiring most of its remaining debt, the company will 
have $3 million in cash it can use to finance new oil ventures or to enter 
another line of business. The firm also has about $8 million in accumulated tax 
losses it can use to shelter future income from taxes.

BRADLEY TAKES OATH FOR FIFTH TERM; 
</P>
<P>
VOWS 'MORE LIVABLE, MORE PROSPEROUS AND MORE JUST' CITY 
</P>

<P>
Tom Bradley, facing investigations that threaten his political career, became 
Los Angeles' first five-term mayor today with a pledge to make his city "more 
prosperous, more livable and more just." There was no mention of the probes of 
his personal finances in his speech prepared for an inaugural ceremony on the 
sunny First Street steps of City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, he sought to look beyond the immediate future, mapping out an agenda 
for the city for the next four years designed to funnel more municipal 
resources into programs for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
"The headlines will come and go," he said. "The 30-second sound bites will be 
heard and then fade away and be forgotten; what will remain long after we are 
gone, what will count in the ultimate balance, are the doors of opportunity 
that have been opened, the air that has been cleaned, the neighborhoods that 
have been given new life, a generation that has been given new hope." 
</P>
<P>
Strongly implying that he believes that his place in history will be determined 
by his handling of such issues rather than the current investigations, Bradley 
said, "All of this -- and more -- will be the real test of our success or 
failure, and in meeting that need, nothing will be permitted to distract our 
attention or sap our energy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Target of Investigations 
</P>
<P>
Since Spring, Bradley has been the target of probes by federal and city 
officials into his stock transactions and his employment by two local financial 
institutions which had business pending before the city. 
</P>
<P>
Also sworn in with Bradley were two high city officials in charge of aspects of 
the probes, City Atty. James K. Hahn and Controller Rick Tuttle. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley pledged to propose a "new strategy" to drive drugs and violence from 
public housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
And he reiterated his determination to obtain more revenue from downtown 
redevelopment, an effort now held up by legal and political disputes. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor also said he will soon announce a program to reduce pollution of 
Santa Monica Bay from storm drains flowing into it. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley promised to spur economic development of poor areas. "Los Angeles 
cannot permanently exist as two cities -- one amazingly prosperous, the other 
increasingly poorer in substance and hope," he said.

JARUZELSKI TO STEP DOWN ON EVE OF BUSH'S WARSAW VISIT; 
</P>
<P>
LAMENTS HE GOT MARTIAL LAW BLAME

<TEXT>
<P>
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski said today he won't run for Poland's new presidency in 
balloting next week because the people see him as the man who imposed martial 
law, not the leader of reforms that followed. 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski, the Communist Party chief, recommended the interior minister, Gen. 
Czeslaw Kiszczak, for the job -- a powerful post resembling the presidency 
created in the Soviet Union for Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
About the time the National Assembly meets to elect a president, President Bush 
comes to Poland on July 9-11 for a state visit. Bush is expected to express 
support for the recent Polish reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Kiszczak has been interior minister since 1981 and thousands of Solidarity 
activists were interned as a result of orders signed by him. However, he won 
the confidence of the Solidarity leadership during negotiations that began last 
August during a national wave of strikes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Threatened to Step Down 
</P>
<P>
And like Jaruzelski, he threatened to step down in January unless Solidarity's 
legal status was reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity sources said union leader Lech Walesa was flying to Warsaw from the 
northern port city of Gdansk for talks with Communist Party officials on 
whether the free trade union could support Kiszczak's candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not plan to be a candidate," Jaruzelski said in a statement read over 
state television. "Permit me to propose Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak for the post of 
president." 
</P>
<P>
The statement was read as the Communist Party's 230-member Central Committee 
held a daylong meeting to choose its candidate for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
In a sign of popular opposition to his candidacy, anti-Communist marchers 
shouting "Jaruzelski must go!" fought police in central Warsaw as they tried to 
reach the Central Committee building before Jaruzelski announced that he would 
not run. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Social Reality' 
</P>
<P>
"I know well that public opinion associates me more often with martial law and 
less often with the line of reforms -- with those so significant decisions of 
the 10th plenum. I must take into consideration social reality," Jaruzelski 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Party sources said Kiszczak's candidacy emerged midway through the meeting 
after supporters of Jaruzelski confidently forecast at the start that their man 
would be nominated after a brief session. 
</P>
<P>
"A tired society has the right to ask when will the sun shine again over 
Poland," Jaruzelski's statement said in an apparent reference to his 
difficulties in ruling the country for the last eight years. 
</P>
<P>
"The time has come for me to speak out. Some may ask why I took so long," 
Jaruzelski said in reference to his long hesitation over the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
"I can only say that no time is too long for a considered decision when 
Poland's fate is at stake. Personal plans, ambitions and image are not 
important," he added. "The most important thing is the supreme interest of the 
state." 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity holds 46% of the 560-seat National Assembly that makes up both 
houses of parliament and elects the president. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity's opposition to Jaruzelski as the man who imposed martial law to 
crush it in 1981 had appeared to cloud his chances of election.

Zsa Zsa Gabor was charged today with three misdemeanors, including battery for 
allegedly slapping a motorcycle officer who stopped her Rolls Royce on La 
Cienega Boulevard June 14 for having expired license tags. 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian-born actress was scheduled to be arraigned July 12 on one count 
each of battery on a police officer, disobeying a police officer and having an 
expired driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
Gabor was also charged with two infractions: having an open container of 
alcohol in a vehicle and having an expired vehicle registration. If convicted 
of the battery charge, the actress could be sentenced to a year in county jail 
and fined $2,000. The other misdemeanor charges carry maximum six-month jail 
terms and $1,000 fines. 
</P>
<P>
The infractions are punishable by $100 fines.

<P>
In another of a series of smash-and-grab jewelry store robberies, two men 
stormed into an Anaheim store this morning, shattered a display case with 
hammers and fled with an unknown amount of jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
The episode unfolded shortly after 11 a.m. when three men in their 20s entered 
Kay Jewelers in Anaheim Plaza, 500 N. Euclid, and broke into the display case, 
police said. Witnesses saw the three fleeing with two other men in a car, which 
officers later discovered abandoned a few blocks away, Lt. John Haradon said. 
Police were checking for fingerprints in the car, which they believe may have 
been stolen. 
</P>
<P>
The heist was among more than a dozen such robberies in Orange County in recent 
months.

A jury ruled today against a high-roller who claimed an Atlantic City casino 
plied him with alcohol and painkillers, forcing him to gamble until he lost 
$165,000. 
</P>
<P>
A federal jury deliberated for about three hours Thursday and today before 
finding that Shmuel Aboud, 44, of New York City must pay a $28,000 gambling 
debt he amassed in 1985 at the Golden Nugget Casino-Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Aboud had contended he suffered from narcotic and alcohol intoxication and the 
casino took advantage of his condition. The jury ruled that the Golden Nugget 
acted negligently, but that the casino's action did not cause Aboud's gambling 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
"This tells the patron that they can't get drunk and blame someone else," 
Golden Nugget attorney Steven Horn said after the verdict. "We think that this 
claim was totally frivolous -- a lie -- and the jury believed it."

CANADA CUTS 3 PROJECTS IN CHINA;

Canada announced today that it is withdrawing from three Chinese development 
projects and taking other measures to protest the crackdown against 
pro-democracy demonstrators by the Beijing government. 
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese authorities have called for 'business as usual' -- this cannot be 
accepted," External Affairs Minister Joe Clark told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
But Clark said the government will not cut off all diplomatic and business ties 
for fear of isolating China in the international community. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the measures, Clark said Canada will continue to ban high-level 
diplomatic contacts with the Chinese government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Continue Protest 
</P>
<P>
He said Canada will continue to seek action to protest the crackdown through 
U.N. agencies, particularly the Commission on Human Rights. 
</P>
<P>
"The benefit of a certain amount of international unison makes it particularly 
important to stay in touch with our friends and allies in the weeks and months 
to come," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
Canada will be using the Paris economic summit to discuss with other countries 
what actions can be taken against China. 
</P>
<P>
Canada will withdraw support for three projects worth a total of $9.1 million 
-- a state auditor training center, a plant to upgrade the quality of 
lubricating oil and an urban traffic management center. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Canada will keep on hold four of five agreements for which 
signings were postponed immediately after the military attacks on demonstrators 
around Tian An Men Square this month. And Ottawa will suspend feasibility 
studies being conducted by Canadian companies for the huge Three Gorges dam 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Canada, an outspoken critic of the Chinese government since the crackdown, 
previously announced it was withdrawing its ambassador in Beijing for 
consultations. It also extended visas by one year for about 4,000 Chinese 
students living in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Clark said he wanted these students to choose on their own whether they want to 
return to their home country. "We are simply saying to them, 'You are welcome 
here.' " 
</P>
<P>
Canada will also be "downgrading" Canada's trade representation in Beijing "in 
response to the changed circumstances and in anticipation of an expected 
downturn in trade activity," Clark said.

CHINA COMPLETES PURGE OF ZHAO, TAKES LAST POST

China today completed its purge of disgraced former Communist Party chief Zhao 
Ziyang, removing him from his last government post for what senior leader Deng 
Xiaoping called "serious mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Zhao, who sympathized with students seeking democratic reforms, was ousted as 
vice chairman of the State Central Military Commission by the Chinese 
legislature. Deng engineered Zhao's formal removal as party leader last 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Deng wrote in a letter to the National People's Congress saying that "since 
Comrade Zhao Ziyang has committed serious mistakes, I proposed his dismissal," 
the official New China News Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
President Yang Shangkun, who spent his career in the military, was reportedly 
seeking Zhao's post of senior vice chairman, second only to Deng in the 
military hierarchy. Yang has extensive contacts among the military leadership 
and was a strong supporter of the martial law decree announced by Premier Li 
Peng in May. 
</P>
<P>
Zhao reportedly opposed the decree and the use of troops to quell the 
pro-democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
Zhao, 69, was last seen when he made a tearful speech to students on a hunger 
strike in Beijing's Tian An Men Square on May 19, two weeks before the troops 
moved in.

Chrysler Corp. announced slumping sales of small cars have forced the layoff of

<P>
The layoffs take effect July 7 when the plant, where Dodge Shadows and Plymouth 
Sundances are assembled, closes for model changeover.

<P>
Sales of the Shadow fell from 44,000 in the first five months of 1988 to 37,700 
during the same period this year. Sundance sales dropped from 39,000 to 38,000 
over the same period.

The layoffs may be due to increased auto production in Mexico, said United Auto 
Workers Local 1700 President Melvin Caldwell.

"They assembled 39,674 P-cars (Sundances and Shadows) in Mexico last year," he

FIRM ADMITS GIVING FDA WRONG DRUG; 
</P>
<P>
OTHER COMPANY'S PRODUCT SUBMITTED FOR GENERIC TEST

<P>
A New York drug company acknowledged today that it gained federal approval to 
market a popular generic high blood pressure drug by submitting another firm's 
product for government testing. 
</P>
<P>
Vitarine Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Springfield Gardens, N.Y., has informed the 
Food and Drug Administration that it gained agency approval for a copycat 
version of the blood pressure drug Dyazide by putting the brand name version of 
the drug in its capsules and submitting these for FDA evaluation, Roger W. 
Jordan, Vitarine chief executive officer, told Reuters. 
</P>
<P>
"We have brought this matter to the attention of the Food and Drug 
Administration and we're actively investigating the matter to determine the 
facts and the circumstances," Jordan said, adding that the firm was cooperating 
fully with the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Product Compared to Itself 
</P>
<P>
"The FDA's approval of Vitarine's generic version was based on a study in which 
SmithKline Beckman's product was compared to itself," charged Rep. John D. 
Dingell (D-Mich.), who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee's 
investigations subcommittee, which has been investigating the FDA's generic 
drug approval procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Dingell, in a letter to FDA Commissioner Frank Young, said the disclosure 
"raises serious concerns" about procedures at the federal drug safety agency. 
</P>
<P>
He said the subcommittee was aware of four other cases in which Vitarine had 
passed off other firms' products as its own for FDA testing, though he said 
none of these was now on the market. 
</P>
<P>
The brand-name version of Dyazide is made by SmithKline Beckman Corp. of 
Philadelphia, which had no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
The drug safety agency said it was probing the matter and would have no other 
comment at this time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Ongoing Investigation' 
</P>
<P>
"The FDA is in the middle of an ongoing investigation of Vitarine and it would 
be improper to comment any further at this point," agency spokesman Jeff Nesbit 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Vitarine's Jordan said the substitution had been done without his knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going into every nook and cranny to determine the facts and 
circumstances, and whatever we find we're turning over to the FDA right away," 
he said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Off-brand versions of Dyazide, sold by several drug companies, make it the 
largest-selling U.S. generic drug. The drug combines a chemical that fights 
high blood pressure with another compound that rids the body of excess fluids. 
</P>
<P>
Industry estimates put U.S. sales of both the generic and brand-name versions 
of Dyazide at over $300 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Licensing Procedure 
</P>
<P>
Generic drugs are copycat versions of well-known, brand-name prescription drugs 
that are marketed after the original maker's patent protection has expired. 
</P>
<P>
Before a generic version of a drug can be sold, it must go through a special 
FDA licensing procedure intended to speed it onto the market to promote 
industry price competition.

That marked the biggest weekly drop for the average since it tumbled 108.42 
points March 21-25, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 5 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 637 up, 894 down and 437 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 170.49 million shares, against 167.10 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index lost .85 to 177.90. 
</P>
<P>
The market has been under pressure since the government reported Wednesday that 
the index of leading economic indicators posted a larger-than-expected 1.2% 
decline in May. 
</P>
<P>
More evidence of a drop in business activity came this morning with the news of 
a 2.5% drop in new factory orders in the same month. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, Wall Street has been welcoming news of slower growth in hopes 
of a "soft landing" that would allow for reduced inflation and lower interest 
rates without much harm to corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
In the last few days, however, investors have begun to look more closely at the 
possibility that the Federal Reserve might not be able to pull off that tricky 
mission, analysts believe. 
</P>
<P>
As evidence, they noted that stocks lately have not responded favorably to 
continuing declines in open-market money rates. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices pushed ahead and interest rates receded further as the rally in the 
credit market continued to roll along today in light pre-holiday trading. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds have been benefiting from a convergence of positive influences, including 
recurring strength in the dollar, signs of slower economic growth and, this 
week, an influx of funds from the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
In trading this morning, the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond rose 5/8 point, or 
$6.25 per $1,000 in face value. The benchmark bond's yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction from price, declined to 8.05% from 8.09% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Cohen, of the Beverly Hills-based brokerage Capital Insight, linked 
today's bond buying to Thursday's stock setback on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
"The key has been the stock market action," Cohen said. "A lot of money has 
moved from the stock market into the bond market. Everybody woke up all of a 
sudden and said this economic slowdown may not be a soft landing and that might 
not be good for corporate earnings." 
</P>
<P>
The dollar's strength has been a key force behind the bond market's advance in 
recent weeks. Increasing value in the dollar tends to draw money into such 
dollar-denominated holdings as Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more and more bond traders believe that the U.S. central bank is 
bound to ease credit conditions soon because of the weak signals the economy 
has been sending out lately.

Time Inc. shareholders today reelected a slate of four incumbent directors 
including Chairman Richard Munro, who reiterated management's opposition to a 
$12.2-billion hostile buyout offer from Paramount. "The company is not for 
sale," Munro said in response to questions by shareholders at Time's annual 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Munro and other Time officials fielded a number of questions from people 
attending the giant media company's first stockholder meeting since Paramount 
Communications Inc. announced its hostile $200-a-share cash buyout offer. 
</P>
<P>
Many shareholders openly have questioned the company's rejection of the 
Paramount offer and its decision to alternatively pursue a $14-billion buyout 
of Warner Communications Inc.

Harvard University boosted its stature as the favorite in the Ladies Challenge 
Plate at the Henley Regatta by reaching the semifinals with a hard-fought 
one-length win today. 
</P>
<P>
The Harvard heavyweight eight held off a tenacious English crew, Notts County 
B. For most of the race the distance between the boats fluctuated between half 
a length and three-quarters of a length. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard also reached the semifinals of the Britannia Cup for coxed fours, but 
rather more comfortably. It took an early lead against the Lea Rowing Club B, 
another English crew, and steadily increased this to 3 1/3 lengths by the 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
The University of Pennsylvania reached the quarterfinals of the Thames Cup, for 
eights, and the quarter-finals of the Visitors Cup, for coxless fours.

AMATEUR FROM PHOENIX IS KING FOR A DAY AS PALMER FADES

<P>
The rain stopped, the weather cooled off and so did Arnold Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
After shooting a 66, six under par, in his final tuneup late Wednesday in the 
heat, rain and high humidity, Palmer fell apart when the U.S. Senior Open began 
Thursday at his home club, Laurel Valley Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer, one of the early starters on the 6,691-yard layout he remodeled into a 
splendid open challenge, soared to a four-over-par 76. 
</P>
<P>
The mob that came to cheer the hometown hero left with heads down and Palmer, 
blaming poor timing on his swing, said he had lost all chance of finally 
winning a tournament on his home course. 
</P>
<P>
But there was still a bright aspect to the day. It concerned an amateur who is 
hardly a shade better than a duffer. He led the tournament for three hours. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Boydston, a restaurateur in Phoenix, lived the dream of all weekend 
players. A three-handicap, twice-a-week player, Boydston had seven birdies, 
shot a three-under 69 and left most of the hotshot professionals in his wake. 
</P>
<P>
Al Geiberger, one of the late starters, birdied the last two holes for a 68 and 
took the lead away from Boydston. 
</P>
<P>
And another late starter in the field of 150, Harold Henning, had five birdies 
on the back nine to tie Boydston for second at 69. 
</P>
<P>
Although Boydston was the only one of 42 amateurs who broke par, nine pros did 
it. There were four at 70, Terry Dill, Frank Beard, Bobby Nichols and Dave 
Hill. And at 71 were Larry Mowry, Jim Dent and Dale Douglass. 
</P>
<P>
If Boydston had parred the 18th hole, he would have been the leader alone. 
Instead, he took a double bogey. But it was fun while it lasted. Until his 
magnificent round, Boydston's claim to fame as a golfer was a second-place 
finish in the Arizona state match play tournament in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
So it was all new to Boydston, who owns a two-restaurant chain, called the 
Chuckbox, in the Phoenix area. He was completely unprepared for the experience 
of facing reporters in the interview room, but he was as impressive there as he 
had been on the course. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe I'm here," he said. "I'm in so far over my head. It's a dream 
come true and I love it. It can't get any better than this. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no illusions. By this time tomorrow, you can stick a fork in me, I'll 
be done. I can just see the guys I play with saying, 'He'll choke tomorrow.' 
They'll be right, too, but this is my moment." 
</P>
<P>
Boydston, asked to describe his round, couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
"Give me two hours and I'll be able to remember," he said. "All I remember is 
that most of my birdies came on 15- to 17-foot putts, except for one 40-footer 
and a 70-foot chip that went in." 
</P>
<P>
Boydston said he was 53, a graduate of Florida State and had been in Phoenix 
for the last 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I own probably the smallest restaurant chain," he said. "We specialize in 
hamburgers in a rustic setting. We use Mason jars as drink containers and tuna 
cans for ashtrays. We do serve good hamburgers, too." 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that his double bogey on the last hole had been a big 
disappointment. And he could recall that hole, too. 
</P>
<P>
The 18th is a 471-yard, par-5 dogleg right that can be reached in two with a 
long second shot over water. It used to be a par-4, but Palmer made some 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't hit my drive far enough to reach in two, so I tried to lay up," 
Boydston said. "Instead, I pulled my second shot from a sidehill lie into 
somebody's Christmas tree -- I guess it was a fir. All I could do was knock it 
a few feet, still in the rough. I hit the green with my fourth shot, but I was 
45 feet away and three-putted. The bogey try was a four-footer. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I was playing pretty well, so at No. 10, I took a look at the leader 
board just to see what it looked like to have my name up there. It looked good. 
When I was ready for the bogey putt, I told my caddy it didn't really matter if 
I made it or not, I had had a dream come true." 
</P>
<P>
Boydston, who has an unusual collection of clubs, qualified for the tournament 
by shooting a 70 in the regional at Phoenix, where two of 40 entries made it. 
</P>
<P>
In his bag, he had a metal driver, but all the rest of the clubs were irons, 
including three wedges, a set of Staff irons he bought in 1969 and a Croydon 
putter he said he bought for $8 second-hand 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how old it is, I just know the grip cost more than the putter," 
he said. "Actually, putting is the weakest part of my game. I just seemed to 
get the feel for these greens. However, I missed a two-footer and two 
four-footers. 
</P>
<P>
"I had two practice rounds before today. I played well on the first one, but on 
the other I played with Gary Player. I was so nervous I played terrible." 
</P>
<P>
Player, who is seeking his third consecutive victory in the senior open, shot a 
par 72. 
</P>
<P>
Said Player: "I played with Boydston yesterday and thought, 'He's going to have 
an awful time.' Then I saw the leader board and couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
Boydston said he wasn't even sure he could make the cut. "Even if I don't, it's 
been fun," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to cost me money when I go home, though. As an amateur I can't win 
money here, and those guys back in Phoenix are going to want strokes." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the pros were stunned by Boydston's score on a course they said was 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Henning said that when he looked up at the board and saw Boydston leading, he 
thought Billy Casper had come back in a new body. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry he got that double bogey on 18, because it would have been an 
incredible story," Henning said. "But he still had the day of his life."
