SHOROKU ONOE; RENOWNED KABUKI DANCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shoroku Onoe II, the revered Kabuki dancer-actor designated a National Living 
Treasure by Japan, has died in Tokyo, the Japanese consul's office said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Onoe, the son of Koshiro Matsumoto VII, another star of the 375-year-old 
classic theater, was 76 and had long been suffering from respiratory 
complications. 
</P>
<P>
A combination of his illness and mourning over the death of his son, 
Tatsunosuke Onoe, another celebrated Grand Kabuki performer who died in 1987, 
had limited his appearances recently. 
</P>
<P>
He died Sunday and had last performed in February in Tokyo, the consul's office 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Born to the Kabuki tradition, Shoroku Onoe first performed when he was 5. He 
took his performance name in 1935 in respect for his teacher, Onoe Kikugor, who 
passed on to him the traditional style of Kabuki (a word which comes from song, 
ka; dance, bo, and skill, ki.) 
</P>
<P>
As he developed into the legend he was at his death, Onoe began experimenting 
with Western theater, adapting "Othello" and "Cyrano de Bergerac." 
</P>
<P>
He had appeared with the Grand Kabuki, Japan's leading Kabuki theater, in Los 
Angeles at the Greek Theater and at UCLA's Royce Hall, most recently in 1985.

Karl R. Bendetsen, one of the chief architects of the government's internment 
of Japanese-Americans in World War II, has died at his home here after a heart 
attack. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
Bendetsen, a retired president and chairman of the board of Champion 
International Corp. of Stamford, Conn., and undersecretary of the Army in the 
1950s, died Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In 1942, Bendetsen, then a major in the Army provost marshal general's office, 
was assigned as a liaison officer between the Justice Department and the 
Western Defense Command, after officials decided that Japanese-Americans 
represented a potential threat to national security during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
He devised a system that divided the West Coast into prohibited military zones. 
He also designed a complex system of passes and permits for Japanese immigrants 
that the Justice Department and the FBI refused to oversee because of a lack of 
manpower. That gave supervision of Japanese immigrants, and later Americans of 
Japanese ancestry, to the Army, which subsequently ordered their internment. 
</P>
<P>
As the controversy over the internment grew over the years, Bendetsen was 
called on to testify and to give statements on the background of the internment 
process. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers determined that he had written a letter "saying he didn't feel it 
was appropriate (to the government's position) that the American public know 
that plans were already in place to intern the Japanese-Americans" even before 
the attack on Pearl Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Those who spent time in the camps were eventually awarded reparations. 
</P>
<P>
Bendetsen's military decorations included the Silver Star, three Bronze Stars, 
three Legions of Merit and a Distinguished Service Medal. He was also the 
recipient of the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian award. 
</P>
<P>
After the war, Bendetsen resumed his San Francisco law practice. He was 
appointed assistant secretary of the Army in 1950 and undersecretary in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
He became chairman, president and chief executive officer of Champion Papers, a 
forest products company, in 1965 and retired in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
From 1980 to 1984, he served as a member of a presidentially appointed 
commission to study the Strategic Defense Initiative, also known as "Star 
Wars."

ANTON DERMOTA; TENOR NOTED FOR HIS ROLES IN MOZART OPERAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anton Dermota, a Yugoslav tenor best known for his work in Mozart operas, died 
of heart failure June 22, the Vienna State Opera reported this week. 
</P>
<P>
He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
Dermota was born in the Yugoslav republic of Slovenia and moved to Vienna as a 
young man. He lived there until his death. 
</P>
<P>
Dermota sang in some of the Vienna State Opera's most noted productions, among 
them the 1945 premiere of Beethoven's opera "Fidelio," performed while the 
opera house was in ruins after heavy Allied bombing in the last days of World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
Dermota sang the role of Florestan in the same opera when the Vienna State 
Opera was reopened in November, 1955, six months after Austria gained postwar 
independence. That production was filmed and shown in the United States two 
years later. 
</P>
<P>
In a register of names kept at the opera that spans 1945 to 1980, Dermota is 
mentioned as having sung 50 opera roles in works by Verdi, Mozart, Wagner, 
Richard Strauss and Gottfried von Einem. 
</P>
<P>
Dermota's prominence in Vienna and at the Salzburg Festival made him a much 
sought-after guest performer on operatic stages around the world. 
</P>
<P>
He made about 20 recordings and was seen as Don Ottavio in a film made of 
Mozart's "Don Giovanni" at the 1954 Salzburg Festival.

NO TIME TO WASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One can begin to imagine the enormity of California's waste-disposal problems 
by just ordering a cup of coffee at a fast-food outlet. If the coffee lover 
uses cream and sugar, the leftover waste includes a Styrofoam cup, a plastic 
stirrer, the empty little synthetic cup that held the cream substitute and 
empty sugar packets. All of this stuff requires considerable energy and fuel to 
manufacture in the first place. In the end, all of it winds up occupying 
valuable space in California landfills. 
</P>
<P>
California is a particularly egregious waster. Every year Californians throw 
away 40 million tons of stuff. By the year 2000, experts predict that 
California's trash output will compose fully one-fourth of the nation's total. 
Ninety percent of California's solid waste winds up in landfills and only 10% 
is diverted to recycling programs. In parts of Japan and Europe, the reverse is 
true. 
</P>
<P>
The end must come for California's lazy, wasteful ways because the state is 
filling up its landfills and running out of new land to fill in many areas. 
Still, it has made little progress toward development of a modern, integrated 
waste- management program that will encourage or require simpler forms of 
packaging, recycling and other actions that will reduce the trash burden with 
relatively little inconvenience or cost. 
</P>
<P>
The solution is quite simple. Other states and localities, and many foreign 
countries, have such programs that are demonstrably economical and successful. 
What California needs is a plan and the political will to put it into effect. A 
reasonable plan just happens to be in hand today, compiled by the 32-member 
state Senate Task Force on Waste Management representing business, the 
environment, governmental agencies, education, the waste management industry 
and the public at large. After a year's study and deliberation, the task force 
has issued a report calling for restructuring the state Solid Waste Management 
Board and the implementation of an integrated state program that will allow 
California to get control of its trash. 
</P>
<P>
One object is to embark immediately on a program of 25% reduction in the total 
waste stream, increasing to 50% by the year 2000, if market conditions permit. 
Those are reasonable, necessary goals. They can be achieved with a vigorous 
joint state and local program that attacks waste at all levels. Composting of 
organic materials such as grass clippings and tree trimmings alone can make a 
significant impact on landfill volume. All governments must work together to 
reduce the volume of unnecessary packaging and to cut other waste at the 
source. And the state can have a major impact on the recycling market by 
requiring agencies to use recycled materials. Critics always claim the market 
will not support recycling. It will if governments create the proper 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
California must develop such a program as soon as possible to get on top of its 
trash problem. Failure to do so is a costly, messy and unacceptable 
alternative.

THE DANGER OF DALLIANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After less than a month in office, Japan's Prime Minister Sosuke Uno finds that 
his public approval rating has sunk to an almost unbelievably low 10%. Uno 
himself is said by friends to have sunk into near-depression. The man who just 
a few weeks ago was perceived as the Mr. Clean of Japanese politics -- and who 
for that reason above all others was picked to lead the corruption-plagued 
ruling Liberal Democratic Party and so became head of government -- is now 
himself battling scandal. Uno's predecessor, Noboru Takeshita, was forced to 
resign after the Recruit Co. scandal revealed business payoffs to top party 
officials in return for political favors. Uno, a married man, is in trouble for 
what is being delicately referred to as his "woman problem." 
</P>
<P>
His specific burden involves allegations of illicit sexual relations with a 
number of women, among them a 10-year affair with a geisha and a fling with a 
16-year-old. An article published by a third woman who claims she was Uno's 
mistress for four months has done him no favors with its accusations that he is 
vain, rude, callous, pompous and cheap. In the past rumors and reports of 
sexual indiscretions among certain Japanese politicians attracted little public 
notice. This time, though, Japan's feminists are treating allegations about Uno 
as a major issue. As a result his political survival is in doubt, and his 
presence at the helm of government is being seen as a liability for his party 
and an international embarrassment for the country. 
</P>
<P>
The obvious way out would seem to be for Uno to go, and quickly. For a number 
of reasons, though, he seems likely to hang on to office, at least through most 
of July. 
</P>
<P>
The most important reason is that no successor seems to be readily available. 
Uno reluctantly agreed to take the reins of the Liberal Democrats only after 
leaders of the faction-ridden party were unable to agree on anyone better. The 
list of possible replacements hasn't grown greatly in the last few weeks. So 
for now, scandal or not, Uno is stuck with the job, and the party to its 
distress is stuck with Uno. 
</P>
<P>
Being premier he must act as premier. Among other things that means 
representing Japan at the mid-July summit conference of major industrialized 
nations in Paris, a meeting Uno is said to be dreading because he fears that 
the sex scandal could produce humiliating snubs from his peers. Meanwhile, Uno, 
as head of his party, has become nominally responsible for the fate of the 
Liberal Democrats in the July 23 elections for the Upper House. A number of 
Liberal Democrats running for office are said to have asked Uno to stay as far 
away as possible from their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
The Uno affair, whatever else may be said about it, is not without certain 
theatrical ironies. For here is a man who really had little interest in 
becoming prime minister, who was content to stay what he was -- with his 
secrets safely hidden -- but who was prevailed on to take the job for the good 
of the party. Here is a man whose chief political qualification for the highest 
reward his party could give was that his public record seemed to free from 
blemish. In Uno's eyes, in the eyes of those who chose him, perhaps it was, the 
odd mistress here or there not being regarded as ethically disqualifying. 
Public opinion in Japan pretty clearly sees things differently, no doubt to the 
surprise of many. In consequence the Liberal Democrats find themselves in 
trouble, and Sosuke Uno seems to have become a politician whose future is 
behind him.

Inauguration ceremonies will be held in Chino on Friday for the first 
California mosque of a Muslim sect whose founder 100 years ago claimed to be 
the embodiment of the Christian messiah and the prophesized mahdi in Islam who 
would revive the worldwide faith. 
</P>
<P>
The $1.4-million Baitul Hameed Mosque of the Ahmadiyya Movement, which serves a 
Southern California congregation of about 500, will be dedicated by Hazrat 
Mirza Tahir Ahmad, 60, the fourth successor to the founder, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam 
Ahmad. 
</P>
<P>
The current spiritual leader lives in London, in exile from his native Pakistan 
where members of the movement are regarded as a "non-Muslim minority" and are 
prohibited from practicing their faith openly, according to Anwer Khan, a 
spokesman for the new mosque. 
</P>
<P>
The movement, claiming a worldwide following of 10 million, has established 
congregations in 122 countries, Khan said. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the 11,000-square-foot mosque, which mixes a Spanish-tile roof 
with low minarets, began after Mirza Tahir Ahmad laid the foundation stone in 
October, 1987. Prayer services were held in the building during the recent 
month of Ramadan, but Khan said full operation of the mosque will not begin 
until next week.

The Rev. Norman Lund, dean of faculty at the Lutheran Bible Institute in 
California, a 100-student school in Anaheim, has been elected by the 
theologically conservative American Assn. of Lutheran Churches to head its 
fledgling seminary program. The denomination of 62 congregations, plus 25 
churches served by affiliated pastors, was born in reaction to the 1987 merger 
that formed the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Lund said he switched 
his affiliation to the conservative denomination at its convention last week in 
Moorhead, Minn.

Radio broadcaster James Dobson, through a spokesman at his Pomona-based Focus 
on the Family Ministries, says that he has dropped his backing for the book, 
"The AIDS Cover-Up," by Gene Antonio. U.S. Surgeon General C. Edward Koop 
recently criticized Dobson and another evangelical broadcaster for echoing 
Antonio's assertions on spread of the disease. Dobson interviewed Antonio on 
his program and offered his book for a time, but the spokesman added that "we 
gave careful consideration to the feedback we subsequently received from 
members of the medical community and made the decision to discontinue it."

KNBC has decided to cancel "Checkpoint," a religious/public affairs program 
that succeeded the all-religious "Odyssey" program. That leaves KCBS' "Today's 
Religion" as the last television religious program produced and regularly aired 
by a Los Angeles station. KNBC's magazine-style show was dropped for "economic 
considerations," says producer Beth McKenzie, although programs still unaired 
and reruns will continue through the end of 1989. McKenzie will be leaving the 
station this month after 14 years with the program. She said the program has 
had a following despite its recent 5:30 a.m. Sunday time slot because of people 
who videotape the program for later viewing. JOHN DART

WHEN DREAMERS GROW OLD; 
</P>
<P>
LOST CAUSES OF YOUTH ARE CYCLICAL IN MODERN CHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEITH SCHOPPA, Keith Schoppa, a historian at Valparaiso University in 
Indiana, is the author of Xiang Lake: Nine Centuries of Chinese Life (Yale 
University Press, 1989). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"When I was young I, too, had many dreams." This confession of despair by Lu 
Xun, China's foremost 20th-Century author, could speak for countless Chinese in 
this tragic century. The Beijing massacre is simply the latest brutal death of 
a youthful dream. It is the death not only of the specific dream of "democracy 
and freedom" but, for many, of the possibility for dreams. One of the tragic 
patterns of 20th-Century China is the recurring nightmare of hope dashed to 
despair, of dreams shattered by violence and repression. 
</P>
<P>
The dream of national wealth and power in the first year of the century seemed 
to be realized by the revolution in 1911, which overthrew the Manchu monarchy 
and established a republic. Instrumental in the revolution were students 
returning from study in Japan where they had drunk the heady wine of modern 
progress and nationalism and seen the fruits of the Meiji restoration. But the 
promise of the revolution was snuffed out by the authoritarian leadership of 
President Yuan Shih-kai and, after his death in 1916, by the dismal plunge into 
warlordism. 
</P>
<P>
The twin dreams of the May 4 Movement in the late 1910s and early '20s 
similarly failed to come to fruition. One goal was to attain greater individual 
freedom from traditional social and political structures. That was, however, 
swallowed up in the repressive statism and reactionary traditionalism of Chiang 
Kai-shek's Nationalist government. The second dream was to build a nation freed 
from imperialist control and operating through self-determination. That hope 
faded in the face of Japan's military campaigns and control of much of China in 
the 1930s and '40s. 
</P>
<P>
In both efforts it was China's young people who were in the forefront, who bore 
the brunt of repression in pre-dawn raids on universities by government police 
and of violence and death engineered by the state. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist victory and the establishment of the People's Republic in 1949 
brought the reality of a nation freed from the depredations of outsiders. With 
it came the hope of a new China, energized by a popular will, modernized and 
ready to take its place in the international community. But the initial 
economic success was buried in the calamitous Great Leap Forward (1958-59), and 
the dream of a more open and tolerant system suggested in Mao's Hundred Flowers 
Movement was destroyed in the ferocity of the anti-rightist campaign of 1957. 
The insanity of the Cultural Revolution (1966-76) came when Mao tried to infuse 
the youth of the 1960s with his own utopian revolutionary dream. 
</P>
<P>
Now, once again, the hopes of China's young, symbolized by the Goddess of 
Democracy, are being destroyed by old men who once had their own dreams of 
change. It is a tragically ironic pattern repeated with depressing consistency. 
Many of the revolutionaries of 1911 became conservative statists and paranoid 
preservers of their own power in the '20s and '30s. Many of the revolutionaries 
of the May 4, Long March and Yenan periods have become the inflexible old guard 
of 1989, fearful of losing control, unwilling to admit that the dreams of their 
youth no longer match reality. 
</P>
<P>
If the repeating cycles of hope and despair continue, then we may expect that 
hope will again revive, that dreams will again flourish. What is not hopeful is 
that China has not been able to break out of this self-destructive pattern in 
order to achieve long-term stability through an equilibrium between state power 
and popular will. 
</P>
<P>
The unanswerable question now is what sort of reaction there will be among the 
Chinese people to the dashed dream of the students and their intellectual and 
proletarian comrades for a more open political system. Many in the vast country 
will likely never learn of the actual events of June 4. Among the peasants, the 
majority may well share the spirit of the Beijing-area farmer whose only 
complaint was that the demonstrations and martial law prevented him from 
selling his melons. 
</P>
<P>
What is crucial to the country's future is the response of those in China's 
cities and elsewhere who have been engaged by the recent demonstrations and the 
Tian An Men assault. Will they respond to repression with a cowed sense of 
frustration and futility, submitting to the forces in charge, like Lu Xun's 
erstwhile revolutionary character, who for his survival resignedly and 
hopelessly returned to teaching the discredited classics? Or will a massive 
purge of the intelligentsia bring a rapid rebirth of anti-government activity, 
perhaps marked by violence instead of peaceful protest? 
</P>
<P>
For now, Lu Xun's own prescription sums up the situation: "Hope cannot be said 
to exist nor can it be said not to exist." The open expression of the dreams 
for basic change may be long in reappearing. But the willful efforts of many 
will almost certainly once again make the dream alive. Lu continues: "(Hope) is 
just like roads across the Earth. For actually the Earth had no roads to begin 
with, but when many men pass one way, a road is made." 
</P>
<P>
The young will again make a road, will again dream their dreams. But when will 
those dreams stop turning to nightmares and awake finally to a new reality?

IMPLEMENTING CAR INSURANCE REFORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to Michael McCabe, vice president for Allstate Insurance ("Allstate 
Lawyer Disparages 'Socially Fair' Premiums," Part I, June 23), if he is against 
"socially fair prices (as being) antithetical to the American way of life and 
the free enterprise system," what is he for? Socially unfair prices? Business 
as usual? 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, my wife was insured by Mercury, and I by Farmers. When she reported 
that I would occasionally be driving her car, Mercury threatened to cancel my 
wife's insurance if I did not insure with them as well. No explanation. To me, 
that is coercive, an abuse of my freedom to contract with whom I choose, and an 
example of why the voters of California are upset. The insurance industry is an 
unregulated economic force with too much power. 
</P>
<P>
McCabe said, "If you force me to write business at a guaranteed loss, the 
incentive that affects my behavior is to treat those customers as badly as the 
law allows. It's an incentive to drive them away." A couple of points: 1) The 
proposition does not force "a guaranteed loss." It does require that insurance 
rates be more fairly determined. 2) McCabe doesn't need to drive anyone away. 
We're already going. We don't like the way insurance companies behave now. 
That's why we passed the proposition. If he doesn't like it, he can stay in 
Illinois. Plenty of California companies will be able to operate profitably 
under the new law. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, his statement that "Whatever went through the voters' mind (sic) is 
irrelevant," is so pompous, condescending, callous, anti-democratic, and 
mean-spirited as to need no commentary. It may become a minor classic, not 
quite in the same league as "Let them eat cake," but certainly comparable to 
William H. Vanderbilt's "The public be damned."

CONTROVERSY OVER POLICE KILLING OF MAN MISTAKEN FOR SUSPECT

In response to the letter from Jon R. Love (June 17): 
</P>
<P>
I hope Love is not a sheriff's deputy or police officer. Anyone who believes 
that a 5' 9" 160-pound 30-year-old man fits the description of a 5' 5" 
125-pound 18-year-old has a real problem. 
</P>
<P>
I must say I am amazed at how many unarmed men who "went for their waistbands" 
have been killed by LAPD and sheriff's deputies in the last 10 years. Many of 
the excuses and "reports" made in these situations are an insult to any honest 
person's intelligence.

DEATH OF I.F. STONE, 'CONSCIENCE OF INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is poignancy in Conrad's carton of June 21, showing I.F. Stone drinking 
"To truth . . . " with Socrates. That is, until one recalls Stone's book "The 
Trial of Socrates," where he has meticulously documented that philosopher's 
propensity to befuddle his opponents by deliberate distortions in the service 
of his pro-totalitarian, anti-democratic, and even anti-free speech convictions 
(so anxious was Stone to avoid error by relying upon possibly incorrect 
translations that, in his 70s, he took the trouble to learn Greek, a stupendous 
task). 
</P>
<P>
I suspect the journalist is more amused than angry, but Conrad should brace 
himself for some embarrassment when he meets Stone (but not Socrates) in the 
Elysian Fields. The cartoon is also inaccurate in depicting Socrates as much 
taller, slimmer and handsomer (and, by insinuation, nobler) than Stone: he was 
short, fat and snub-nosed, well below Golden Age standards.

<P>
It's very disturbing to me that a sheriff's deputy is back on patrol after 
killing an innocent man ("Victim's Family Blasts Sheriff's Probe of Killing," 
Metro, June 18). Deputy Patrick Maxwell was cleared of wrongdoing because he 
believed his life was in danger. Marcus Donel (the victim) made a fatal 
suspicious move. Maybe Donel thought his life was in danger, which now turns 
out to be true. 
</P>
<P>
Police officers jump to the defense of Maxwell saying he is now the victim. 
Maxwell will have to live with his mistake for the rest of his life. However, 
Marcus Donel will not be able to live with Maxwell's mistake, and what, if 
anything, is going to be done about that?

DEATH OF I.F. STONE, 'CONSCIENCE OF INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times deserves special commendation for the excellent news story (Part I, 
June 19) and editorial ("Journalist of Integrity," June 20) in regard to the 
passing of Stone. 
</P>
<P>
One additional item in his illustrious career that deserves notice: Izzy 
deserves credit for launching the successful campaign to abolish the old House 
Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). 
</P>
<P>
In mid-May, 1957, when most civil libertarians were devoting their energies on 
this issue by just defending the "victims" of HUAC (those subpoenaed to appear 
before this ongoing national witch hunt), it was Stone who correctly sensed 
that the time was ripe for its abolition. Based on a little noticed U.S. 
Supreme Court decision (Watkins vs. U.S.) at that time, where Chief Justice 
Earl Warren pointedly asked, "Who can define the meaning of Un-American 
activities?", the Weekly devoted an issue on the HUAC question and Izzy was on 
the phone to friends all over the nation, including the writer, insisting that 
not another day be lost. 
</P>
<P>
He was most persuasive. Response was immediate: Alexander Meiklejohn, Corliss 
Lamont, Carey McWilliams, Aubrey Williams, Clarence Pickett, Harvey O'Connor 
and many more took up the call -- through petitions, editorials, and 
grass-roots organizing, the campaign to end congressional inquisitions started. 
Hollywood 10's Dalton Trumbo joined Princeton's Prof. H.H. Wilson to pack 
Carnegie Hall for a kick-off rally sponsored by the then-Emergency Civil 
Liberties Committee; to be followed thereafter by the creation of the National 
Committee to Abolish HUAC. 
</P>
<P>
While it took 18 more years to do the monster in, in 1975, the ultimate victory 
over the committee and for the First Amendment, properly goes to I.F. Stone.

'HUNGARY'S CHALLENGE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The June 16 commentary ("Hungary's Challenge for the West," Op-Ed Page, June 
16) by Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo) contained factual errors and 
misrepresentations. The congressman stated that Imre Nagy, the prime minister 
of the Hungarian government formed during the 1956 Revolution, "was secretly 
executed by Soviet troops." 
</P>
<P>
Nagy was tried and sentenced to death by a court of the People's Republic of 
Hungary. This court was constituted under the aegis of the government lead by 
Janos Kadar, the man who betrayed Nagy and Hungary the entire nation. He was 
put in power by the Soviets after the Revolution was crushed on Nov. 4, 1956. 
Nagy was executed by a Hungarian hangman. 
</P>
<P>
Lantos also implies that Nagy was rehabilitated. True, the Hungarian chief 
prosecutor -- aiming at legal rehabilitation -- scheduled the retrial of Nagy 
and his associates beginning on July 6 of this year and the Central Committee 
of the Hungarian Communist Party on May 30, 1989, announced: "Although the 
relevant documents need to be carefully studied, it can already be concluded 
that (Nagy's trial) was a political show trial, Imre Nagy's execution was it 
seems, certainly judicially unlawful." 
</P>
<P>
On the same day, however, the general secretary of the party, Karoly Grosz, in 
a television address to the Hungarian nation said on Nagy's rehabilitation: "On 
the basis of the information available today I can still say that we have no 
knowledge on the basis of which the previous decision (of denying 
rehabilitation) must be changed." 
</P>
<P>
The ambiguity, the contradictions in the statements by party and government 
officials concerning the Nagy case should provide ample reasons for Lantos to 
refrain from definitive statements, and to elaborate on the significance of the 
difference between the possible judicial and the categorically denied political 
rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
Lantos' accolades directed at the government in Hungary are premature. The 
hailed new laws regulating taxes, investments are favoring foreign investors 
and discriminating against Hungarian entrepreneurs. These laws are the cause of 
the mass withdrawal of scarce native private capital from the economy. The 
newly drafted constitution contains major provisions which are strongly opposed 
by the forces of democracy in Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
I wish that Lantos would have been more explicit in his definition of what 
Washington could or should do to aid not the "reform-minded regime to overcome 
its difficulties," but the Hungarian people who day by day express their 
aspirations for genuine freedom and democracy and their distaste for the 
"reform-minded regime" and the political, economic system it represents.

IMPLEMENTING CAR INSURANCE REFORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Proposition 103 is not a moral weapon of some kind just because a majority of 
voters approved it. Your editorial "No More Mr. Nice Guys" (June 25) is yet 
another in a long line of Times articles that trash the free enterprise system. 
</P>
<P>
The voters had no right to enact Proposition 103 and the state Supreme Court 
had no right to uphold it. Of course insurance rates are high. So are food 
prices, theater tickets, new car prices, and health care costs. Yet no one has 
seriously proposed that we vote to reduce these items. 
</P>
<P>
The Times opposes the right of insurance company officials to defend themselves 
from a bureaucratic onslaught of state-approved rates and mindless regulations. 
I applaud the Allstate representatives who bluntly called Proposition 103 what 
it is -- an attempt to be "socially fair" while ignoring economic realities. 
</P>
<P>
I assume that your editorial writer lives in central Los Angeles, drives a 
sports car, is single, and has a chargeable accident and a few speeding tickets 
on his record. I say this because those who favored Proposition 103 had the 
most to gain from its passage. 
</P>
<P>
The individual thus described would receive lower rates, while a married 
50-year-old farmer from Bakersfield who drives a Chevy and has a perfect 
driving record would likely receive higher rates. This is the trade-off. Rates 
cannot be lowered in a vacuum. That is the major flaw of 103. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of more regulation we need less. The free market will provide the 
lowest insurance rates if it is allowed to operate without restriction. 
</P>
<P>
There are more than 700 casualty insurance companies in California, with wide 
fluctuations in prices. Shop around if you want lower rates. Examine your 
coverage. You likely can cut some coverage here and there and save. Raise your 
deductibles. Discover your options. And repeal Proposition 103 before it is too 
late.

MARLETTE ON GUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If it is fair for cartoonist Marlette to depict Beirut, Haiti and Washington, 
D.C., as "N.R.A. Dream Vacations" (Editorial Page, June 24), it is also fitting 
to portray China under (Chinese senior leader) Deng Xiaoping as a gun-grabber's 
paradise. 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that Beijing has gun control laws second to none; the bad news 
is that the murders, the brutality, the roundups, the terror, the torture and 
the executions continue unabated. 
</P>
<P>
Given an alternative, the unarmed martyrs of Tian An Men Square would probably 
choose Beirut, Haiti or Washington, D.C.

All the legalisms and legalese involving Pete Rose, his bookmaker, Commissioner 
Giamatti and Judge Nadel are much ado about nothing, simple delays in a drama 
fast becoming stale. As the judge said, a 14-day delay will hurt neither major 
league baseball nor the public. This thing's already gone on longer than 
Kareem's farewell tour. Either Rose will be able to explain away the hard 
evidence, especially the betting slips, or he will not. If he cannot, he should 
be gone.

Not since Bowie Kuhn, the eunuch prince of pomposity, protected baseball from 
the villainous likes of Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle has there been such a 
champion of the absurd as Bart Giamatti. Does it bother me that Pete Rose

writes letters of recommendation to judges on behalf of the seamy, self-serving 
elements of illegal gambling.

An item in the newspaper the other day told of a judge giving a last-minute 
reprieve from execution to a convicted murderer. The man had brutally butchered 
a family of seven. 
</P>
<P>
I don't particularly care whether Pete Rose is guilty. Nor whether Judge 
Norbert Nadel's two-week reprieve was a "hometown" decision. 
</P>
<P>
For more than two decades many in baseball have believed that Pete Rose has the 
body of a man and the responses of a small boy. By most accounts Rose is 
today's incarnation of Ty Cobb. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps a stupid decision by a hometown judge has extended the life of this 
bloodied and battered child of a man. Two weeks. Pete Rose should shoot his 
lawyers for aiding and abetting his own massacre. And the press has pounced on 
this two weeks more than their response to the convicted murderer of seven.

CHICAGO ART TRUSTEES CURB 'DISRUPTIVE' STUDENT WORKS

<P>
Trustees of a Chicago art school where two recent exhibits -- including one of 
a U.S. flag on the floor -- caused heated protests have issued strict new 
guidelines allowing for removal of disruptive student artworks. 
</P>
<P>
Under the guidelines, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago can "relocate 
or remove" any exhibit that may violate the law or be "hazardous to the health 
and or safety of viewers or participants." 
</P>
<P>
The guidelines, formulated by a committee of students, teachers and 
administrators, also give the school the authority to determine "when, if, how 
long and where" students' art will be shown. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can Relocate Displays 
</P>
<P>
Displays that "may be disruptive to the educational process" can be relocated 
or removed, say the rules, released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall Field IV, president of the board of trustees, spelled out the new 
policy in a letter to board members. 
</P>
<P>
A long debate in arriving at the guidelines shows "the extreme difficulty of 
balancing personal freedom of expression in an educational environment with 
responsibilities to . . . community concerns and public sensitivities," Field 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Site of Protests 
</P>
<P>
The Art Institute has been the site of protests within the last two years over 
two student exhibits -- one that included an American flag on the floor where 
it could be walked on and the other a painting of the late Mayor Harold 
Washington in women's undergarments. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Walter W. Dudycz, a Republican who led protests against the flag 
exhibit, praised the guidelines as an attempt to treat controversial student 
exhibits equally. 
</P>
<P>
But Harvey Grossman, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union in 
Illinois, said the guideline governing health and safety hazards is 
"particularly vague and could result in chilling and inhibiting student 
creativity and expression."

BAUER'S REMARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'm writing my displeasure about the remarks made by Steven Bauer. He echoes a 
sentiment that DEA agents should get diplomatic immunity to do their job in 
Mexico. The very fact that U.S. law enforcement agents are openly working in 
Mexico is an extremely sensitive and unconventional binational arrangement 
between both countries. It's evident that Bauer's racist contempt and ignorance 
about Mexico prevents him from grasping this concept. 
</P>
<P>
The article also quotes producer Michael Mann's fears for his life if he were 
to shoot the miniseries in Mexico. They are fitting remarks from the executive 
producer of "Miami Vice," a series showing Latinos primarily as drug dealers 
and continuing the slanderous stereotype of the greaser-bandido-cholo that has 
plagued American popular culture. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not sure who is at greater fault for the remarks in the article, the makers 
of "Desperados" (who are trying to grab publicity), or The Times for so 
uncritically relating their comments. The lack of editorial judgment seems 
surprising since The Times recently has made honest and intelligent efforts to 
deal with the issues regarding Spanish language media in the United States and 
binational approaches to solving binational problems.

BAUER'S REMARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steven Bauer, an actor of Cuban origin, is suddenly an expert on 
Mexican-American relations. In Bart Mills' June 19 article, " 'Desperados' 
Relives the Brutal Murder of a U.S. Drug Agent," Bauer stated that the Mexican 
people "don't like us; they really don't." Also that Mexicans want to make our 
country "look stupid, which is what Mexicans live for." 
</P>
<P>
Funny, but I get different vibes. On the whole the Mexican people admire and 
respect our political system and our immense wealth and power. Many certainly 
want to live here! When they compare their corrupt government, ballot box fraud 
and other social ills with mainstream America, we come out smelling like a 
rose.

<P>
With regard to your recent article on the National Endowment for the Arts 
(Calendar, June 23), I am the author of the one-word poem, misprinted in your 
article without acknowledgment, that was the focus of the 1969 
NEA/Congressional ruckus. 
</P>
<P>
For the record, the poem should appear -- ideally in the center of an empty 
space -- as follows:

<P>
Should any of your readers be interested in the extraordinary literary and 
fiscal history of this work, allow me to refer them to my own article, with an 
introduction by George Plimpton, in the August 1981 issue of Mother Jones, 
entitled "The Most Expensive Word in History." 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, on the 20th anniversary of the congressional maelstrom, the 
poem will soon be issued again in a special signed and numbered silk-screen 
poster edition commissioned by the Paris Review, and available from the 
magazine.

HIDDEN TREASURE

<TEXT>
<P>
I attended a performance of the Los Angeles Pops Orchestra June 23 at the 
Biltmore Bowl in the Biltmore Hotel. It was a wonderful evening of musical 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra, conducted by Carlo Spiga, played several distinctive selections, 
and delightful singer/TV star Ann Jillian performed during the second half of 
the program. I was lucky enough to be made aware of this orchestra through a 
friend; The Times seems to seldom mention it. 
</P>
<P>
It seems to me that Los Angeles has the population and potential to achieve the 
equivalency of the Boston Pops right here. If more people knew about the Los 
Angeles Pops Orchestra, I'm sure they would rather attend the concerts in 
person instead of sitting home and watching the Boston Pops on TV! GAIL BELL

ABSENCE OF SMOKE MAY FAN FLAMES OF UNREST AT CROWDED JAILS IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IGOR GREENWALD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the best of times, summer is long and hot in San Diego County's overcrowded 
jails. It could get hotter today when sheriff's deputies begin enforcing a 
total ban on smoking at all detention facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The ban could spark protests and violence from inmates suffering the effects of 
nicotine withdrawal, say health experts and corrections officials. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Kelley of the American Lung Assn. visited every facility in San Diego 
County's jail system in an attempt to help the inmates adjust to the new rule. 
</P>
<P>
"The speed with which the jails moved, and the time of year they chose to do it 
concern me," she said, adding that more time for the transition was needed. 
</P>
<P>
Tensions inside the over-crowded jails have risen since cigarette sales were 
cut off June 17. A riot Sunday at the County Jail in Chula Vista was followed 
by another Tuesday at the Descanso honor camp. Fights among inmates over the 
dwindling supply of cigarettes contributed to both disturbances, the deputies 
who serve as jail guards acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
The price of a single cigarette inside the Chula Vista jail sky-rocketed to $9, 
or $180 per pack, said Sgt. Dennis Ferons, a watch commander. "Realistically, 
if you are an inmate with a cigarette, they will try to trade for it. And if 
you don't do it, they will fight for it," Ferons said. 
</P>
<P>
Kelley said she was cooly received by most inmates during her tour of the 
jails. Some threatened to riot, while others demanded to negotiate changes to 
the no-smoking policy. "There was an awful lot of apprehension, at the 
minimum," Kelley said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Descanso honor camp, jail commander Lewis Jones said he is most 
concerned about the first weekend under the ban, anticipating possible protests 
today and on the first work day Monday. "We are seeing a lot more physical 
stuff as the cigarettes run out," he said. "Guys are walking around with 
shorter fuses." 
</P>
<P>
Extra guards may be added to work overtime over the weekend at the Descanso and 
El Cajon facilities, jail officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But a Sheriff's Department spokesman was more optimistic: "We are always 
concerned, but do not anticipate any more problems than usual." 
</P>
<P>
The smoking ban was proposed by a task force of assistant jail commanders and 
approved by the Board of Supervisors last month, Sgt. Jim Cook said. Public 
health and maintenance costs combined with the threat of litigation by 
incarcerated non-smokers, assured the policy's approval, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Similar Programs 
</P>
<P>
San Diego now joins Sacramento, Kern and Yolo counties in California, along 
with King's County in Washington State and a jurisdiction in Utah, as the only 
systems in the nation which prohibit smoking in at least some of the jails. 
Many other California counties, and one each in Michigan and Virginia, also 
plan jail smoking bans. The policy receives generally favorable reviews from 
those who live with it, but there are problems as well. 
</P>
<P>
When the ban first went into effect in Kern County, "I thought they were going 
to burn the place down," said Al Gutierrez, chief of detention for Kern County 
Sheriff's Department. "I was amazed we had as few problems as we did." 
</P>
<P>
Yolo County experienced protests and threats by inmates for a month after the 
change, said Lt. Stan Rommel, manager of the county jail. But Yolo County is 
not San Diego -- it is not 231% over its rated inmate capacity. 
</P>
<P>
"If you assume inhumane overcrowding, and an adversarial relationship between 
guards and inmates, and then throw in the ban, it could all add up to a very 
big number," Rommel said. "If I were (in San Diego County), I would be thinking 
real hard about this ban." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ban in Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
The federal Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles experimented 
with a complete ban for one month before smoking was again allowed in some 
areas, Warden Margaret Hembrick said. Inmate protests against the policy played 
a part in its reversal, she said. 
</P>
<P>
One of Sacramento County's jails adopted a smoking ban in late December, 1988, 
said Sacramento Sheriff's Capt. Philip Murphy. "The reason everyone is talking 
of doing it now is that they waited to see what would happen here. Before long 
this will be standard policy everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
But nicotine addiction expert Rosemarie Kelly said the San Diego system's 
overcrowding added a "volatile" ingredient to the mix. Kelly, program director 
of Second Breath smoking cessation clinic, said a cigarette gives the smoker an 
illusion of personal space that may not exist beyond his imagination. "You will 
see anger and hostility when that illusion is taken away" from the inmates, she 
said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEW POLICE CHIEF TAKES OVER JULY 17 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Costa Mesa Police Capt. Robert Moody will take charge of the Claremont Police 
Department on July 17, giving the city its first permanent police chief in 
almost a year, City Manager Glenn Southard announced last week. 
</P>
<P>
Moody, 54, who has been in law enforcement for 32 years, was hailed by Southard 
as "a seasoned professional with a broad base of experience." 
</P>
<P>
Moody succeeds Jimmie Kennedy, who was hired as interim police chief in January 
after the resignation of Dexter Atkinson. 
</P>
<P>
Atkinson resigned in December after a four-month investigation of allegations 
that he allowed a three-time convicted drunk driver to supervise remodeling 
work at the police station in lieu of serving required jail time. 
</P>
<P>
Southard had placed Atkinson on paid administrative leave last August.

HELP SOUGHT IN FINDING MISSING MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff's Department officials are looking for help in finding a mentally 
impaired El Cajon man who wandered away from his mother Tuesday while at the 
Del Mar Fair. 
</P>
<P>
David Allan Powers, 32, was last seen in the grandstands at the Del Mar Fair 
about 6:30 p.m. when he became separated from his mother and friends in the 
crowd that gathered for a Waylon Jennings concert, said Thelma Noel, who was 
with the group and shares her home with Powers. 
</P>
<P>
Powers had been sitting next to his mother, but "when she turned around he was 
gone," Noel said. His mother thought that Powers went to sit closer to the band 
and "she kept thinking he would come back," Noel said. 
</P>
<P>
When Powers did not return at the end of the concert, the group frantically 
began searching for him, Noel said. They searched the fairgrounds until 
midnight to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel bad because I insisted that he go" to the fair, Noel said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Evidence of Foul Play 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Lt. John Tenwolde said there was no evidence of foul play. Although 
Powers is capable of communicating and knows his name, he may not be able to 
provide detailed information. He was carrying no identification. 
</P>
<P>
A few months ago, Powers wandered away from the El Cajon home he shared with 
Noel and several others but was found three days later in Lakeside. 
</P>
<P>
"The three days he was gone, he was dehydrated," Noel said. "It took him a 
while to remember me." 
</P>
<P>
Powers might be wandering along the coast because "he loves the beach," Noel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Powers is 6 feet tall, weighs 140 pounds, and has reddish-blond hair and a thin 
mustache. He was wearing a gray, pinstripe suit coat over a blue plaid shirt, a 
pair of yellow and green jeans, and blue tennis shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information concerning Powers' whereabouts is asked to call the 
Sheriff's Department at 692-5600 or 565-5200.

MOVEMENT TO SAVE CARWASH GAINS AN ANTHEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
People were whistling distinctly different tunes Friday as the San Fernando 
Valley's carwash culture controversy turned more bizarre. 
</P>
<P>
Studio City residents wore "Save Our Corner" T-shirts and sang an 
anti-development anthem that asked, "Is there nothing sacred anymore? Is our 
community going out the door?" as they rallied to prevent a popular 
neighborhood carwash from being demolished to make room for a mini-mall. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, representatives of the developer who hopes to build the $15-million 
shopping center wore dejected looks and sang the blues as they watched the 
spectacle and mulled over ways of counteracting the growing carwash crusade. 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners announced that architects from the community have volunteered to 
help redesign developer Ira Smedra's retail project if the Los Angeles Cultural 
Heritage Commission votes July 19 in favor of making the carwash an official 
city cultural monument. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hindering Demolition 
</P>
<P>
If ratified by the City Council, such a designation would delay demolition of 
the carwash, an adjoining gas station and a coffee shop next door for one year. 
</P>
<P>
That would give the architects time to incorporate all three structures into a 
new shopping center design, neighborhood leader Walter McIntyre said. 
</P>
<P>
Showing off shirts that they plan to sell for $10 each, residents sang along 
with musicians Jean Frye of Studio City and Olivia Duke of Hollywood. Their 
lyrics demanded: "Save our corner, save our precious history. Save our corner, 
gateway to Studio City." 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter Avenue School fourth-grader Jacqueline Wolfstein, 9, read an essay 
that warned that destruction of the steel boomerang-topped carwash "would be 
bad for the movie makers who need a backdrop for the 1960s" for their films. 
</P>
<P>
In the background, developer representatives Ira Handelman and Amy Goldberg 
looked on unhappily. "This is great theater, but I think a cultural heritage 
designation is a more serious matter," Handelman said. 
</P>
<P>
Handelman said the monument nomination should have failed last week when the 
three existing members of the five-member panel failed to approve the monument 
designation. Two commission seats were vacant at the time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Panel Divided 
</P>
<P>
The commission was split 2 to 1 in favor of preservation, but commission 
President Amarjit Marwah refused to take an official vote because three 
affirmative votes are needed. 
</P>
<P>
Handelman complained Friday that Marwah should have taken a vote and the 
nomination should have died. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Handelman said, Smedra is considering suing Marwah. Smedra is also 
considering incorporating the "landmark" boomerangs into his mall -- even 
though he is convinced most Studio City residents dislike the gaudy, 
55-foot-tall tower, Handelman said. 
</P>
<P>
Marwah, who showed up at the carwash as the rally was ending, denied that he 
abused his power as president in delaying the vote until after newly appointed 
Commissioner Reynaldo Landero starts work. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt that having three members of the commission was not sufficient to vote 
that day," he said. "I did not feel it was fair to the citizens, who in my 
opinion had presented a very good case of the cultural importance." 
</P>
<P>
Landero, a Carson physician whose appointment was approved Tuesday by the City 
Council, said he plans to visit the carwash this weekend to check on its 
cultural importance for himself. 
</P>
<P>
He said he has read all of the commission documents on the carwash and is 
leaning toward supporting the landmark designation, although "I haven't really 
made my mind up yet." 
</P>
<P>
All in all, Landero said, he would rather have avoided the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's a healthy sign of democracy. And I love the diversity of culture in 
L.A.," he said.

PLANT OPERATORS ACCUSED OF MISHANDLING CYANIDE WASTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two brothers who operated a North Hollywood plating company were charged Friday 
with recklessly handling and storing thousands of gallons of cyanide waste and 
other hazardous materials, according to the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Cyanide was also dumped into the Los Angeles sewer system at the All-American 
Plating Corp. in the 7100 block of Vineland Avenue, while open and unlabeled 
tanks of acids were stored so close together that an accidental mixture could 
have formed a toxic cloud, Deputy Dist. Atty. William W. Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the cyanide had mixed with the other acid waste, you would have had a 
similar reaction to what you have in a gas chamber," Carter said. "An 
inadvertent mixture of the two would have generated a cyanide cloud." 
</P>
<P>
Carter said Yoav (Joe) Pantilant, 52, of Woodland Hills, owner and president of 
All-American Plating until it closed and was sold last month, was arrested 
Friday morning while cleaning out his desk at the business. His brother, Sarv 
(Tom) Pantilant, 45, a general manager of the firm, was arrested at his Saugus 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Carter said the brothers each face one felony count of reckless handling and 
storage of hazardous materials, seven misdemeanor counts of illegal storage of 
hazardous materials and one misdemeanor count of illegally discharging into the 
sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
The Pantilants were the first suspects to face felony charges under a new state 
law making it illegal to knowingly handle or store hazardous materials in a 
reckless manner, Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers could face up to three years in prison and $100,000 in fines if 
convicted of the felony. They were being held at County Jail in lieu of 
$250,000 bail each. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which electroplated aircraft parts in a process that involved 
placing them in large cyanide and acid baths, closed after the city of Los 
Angeles cut off its sewer hookup and the district attorney's office searched 
the business, Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation was initiated when employees told authorities about 
conditions at the plant. The company had been convicted in 1987 of illegally 
dumping cyanide into a dumpster and placed on three years probation and fined 
$25,000 in a civil complaint case, Carter said. The fine was never paid, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
On April 27, investigators with a search warrant raided the plant, Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
"We caught them discharging cyanide into the sewer on the day we were there," 
he said. "You could smell cyanide in the air." 
</P>
<P>
He said investigators found a storage room in the plant containing as much as a 
two-year buildup of various acid wastes. 
</P>
<P>
"There were thousands of gallons in big tanks, open tanks," Carter said. 
"Nothing was labeled, and it was being handled and stored in such a way that it 
was a risk." 
</P>
<P>
On May 15, the city cut off sewer service and the county Department of Health 
Services began removing hazardous materials. The company will be charged for 
the cleanup, Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
Though closed down, the business apparently was sold to a Mexican company in 
June, Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the Pantilants could not be reached for comment Friday.

PROSECUTION REJECTED IN EXCAVATION AT LANDFILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles will not be prosecuted for alleged illegal garbage 
excavation at Lopez Canyon Landfill because state laws preclude criminal 
prosecution of public agencies, a spokesman for the Los Angeles district 
attorney's office said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
David H. Guthman, head deputy district attorney in the environmental crimes 
division, said the decision not to prosecute did not mean that the city was 
blameless for grading a road through the trash in March without required 
permits. That excavation released toxic gases that caused two landfill workers 
to faint. 
</P>
<P>
"If this had been any operator other than a governmental entity, there would've 
been enough to file criminal charges," Guthman said. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said the air resources section of the state Health and Safety Code 
does not allow criminal prosecution of any public agency or employee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pursuing Action 
</P>
<P>
South Coast Air Quality Management District officials, who had asked the 
district attorney to investigate the incident, plan to proceed with civil 
action against the city's Bureau of Sanitation, said spokesman David 
Rutherford. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously we were hoping that they would take it, but we still have every 
intention of pursuing it ourselves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of neighborhoods near the dump, many of whom oppose its continued 
operation, were disappointed by the district attorney's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody feels that we're being let down by the process because time and 
again we point out violations and they recognize that there are violations and 
they're doing nothing to stop them," said Mark Hattan, who lives in Kagel 
Canyon. "It just keeps getting pushed aside." 
</P>
<P>
Bureau of Sanitation officials could not be reached for comment Friday. They 
have acknowledged that mistakes were made March 8, when the workers were 
overcome by gases while digging into 1981-vintage trash. However, they said 
they have taken precautions to prevent recurrences, including hiring an on-site 
environmental officer and delaying any further deep excavation. 
</P>
<P>
Rutherford said the AQMD also plans to push forward with four more civil 
charges that also were reviewed and rejected by the district attorney: three 
incidents of odor releases into surrounding neighborhoods and a delay in 
construction of a landfill gas collection and flare system to deal with gas and 
odor problems. 
</P>
<P>
He said AQMD attorneys also plan to pursue a sixth charge related to a report 
from hikers who earlier this month discovered a broken gas pipe at the dump, 
which they said was leaking. 
</P>
<P>
In other action, the AQMD hearing board voted Thursday to grant the city an 
extension through Aug. 2 to complete its gas collection and flare system. AQMD 
officials have said such a system could prevent future gas and odor release 
problems by venting gases to the surface and burning them off. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the board discussed filing suit to force the city to 
complete the gas system by or soon after a July 1 deadline, which had been 
extended several times. But Rutherford said the board decided Thursday not to 
go to court, at least until the city has more time to propose alternatives. 
City sanitation officials have estimated that it could take until October to 
complete the system.

OUTLOOK DIM FOR SUPERFUND LISTING OF LAB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN and MYRON LEVIN, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A U.S. Environmental Protection official said Friday that Rockwell 
International's Santa Susana Field Laboratory is unlikely to get Superfund 
status because risks at the site are too minor for it to qualify for the 
federal toxic cleanup list. 
</P>
<P>
A 1987 assessment by an EPA contractor found that the laboratory west of 
Chatsworth did not rank high enough in terms of environmental hazards to 
qualify for the Superfund list, which includes about 900 sites nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
EPA inspectors toured the site Thursday in response to pressure from Rep. Elton 
Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) and allegations that the initial assessment did not 
take into account all pollutants at the site, including radioactive 
contamination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inclusion Doubtful 
</P>
<P>
But at a news conference in Burbank late Friday, Richard Vaille, assistant 
chief of waste programs for the EPA's San Francisco regional office, said he 
doubts that the site will qualify for Superfund listing. 
</P>
<P>
He characterized chemical and radioactive contamination at Santa Susana as "low 
residues" and said there is little chance of public exposure. 
</P>
<P>
Vaille said, however, that the EPA established a working group of several 
health and environmental agencies to coordinate monitoring and cleanup of the 
site. The agencies include the state Department of Health Services, the Los 
Angeles office of the Regional Water Quality Board and the U.S. Department of 
Energy, which contracts with Rockwell for nuclear and other energy work on a 
290-acre swath of the 2,668-acre Santa Susana site. 
</P>
<P>
Vaille made his remarks after a nearly daylong organizational meeting of the 
group at the Department of Health Services' office in Burbank. He said the 
group will hold a public meeting soon to answer questions from concerned 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Pollution 
</P>
<P>
Santa Susana has long been on the state Superfund cleanup list, but not due to 
the contamination that has recently been the subject of wide public concern. 
The state Superfund listing is due to chemical-solvent contamination of ground 
water beneath an area of the site where rocket engines are tested. Levels of 
trichloroethylene (TCE) in ground water there are up to 11,000 parts per 
billion, a far higher pollution reading than any found on the Department of 
Energy portion of the site. 
</P>
<P>
Over more than three decades, Rockwell's work on the site for the Department of 
Energy and its predecessor, the Atomic Energy Commission, has included work 
with 16 nuclear reactors -- none operating now -- and the recycling of nuclear 
fuel. 
</P>
<P>
A recent Department of Energy report indicated that generally low-level 
chemical and radioactive contamination exists in several areas of the 
Department of Energy portion of the site, but said the pollution poses no 
immediate health threat. The department called for better ground-water 
monitoring at the site, and Rockwell has said it will drill 18 more monitoring 
wells.

BENEFITS OF RIDE-SHARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Warner Center's innovative ride-sharing incentive package is great news for 
Warner Center employees and local residents alike. It should significantly 
reduce the number of cars in and around Warner Center. I'm glad The Times 
featured this new program so prominently (June 16). 
</P>
<P>
The ride-sharing program and incentives are part of a comprehensive plan to 
relieve traffic congestion in Warner Center. I created the city's Warner Center 
Trust Fund to finance this plan, using $5.5 million assessed of local developer 
Robert Voit. My office is developing the traffic improvement plan with the city 
Department of Transportation and Warner Center businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The city already requires future developers to be responsible for easing 
traffic. The trust fund is a first because it also targets developers of 
existing projects. 
</P>
<P>
We're making ride-sharing as easy, stress-free and financially attractive as 
possible. The incentive package includes fare subsidies for the first three 
months, and a free month's fare after 11 months participation in a van pool or 
bus pool. The "Guaranteed Ride Home" service provides a free ride home for 
ride-sharing employees who have unexpected work or family emergencies during 
the workday. With the hot weather and smog upon us, now's the time to jump into 
the pool: the car, bus or van pool!

IMPLIED MESSAGE ON EL SALVADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Howard L. Berman deserves praise for his part in securing labor leader 
Jose Mazariego's release from a Salvadoran treasury police torture chamber 
(June 22). It is regrettable that most of the victims in El Salvador lack 
influential American supporters who can intercede to save them from torture and 
death. 
</P>
<P>
The Times quotes Berman as saying that the new Salvadoran government "is 
telling us that labor and other opposition groups will be harassed, that they 
will be threatened and that their leaders will be cruelly attacked." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Berman continues, "I don't believe the Kastenmeier Bill (which 
calls for an end to American military involvement in El Salvador) is even 
within the realm of what anybody is talking about here." 
</P>
<P>
In blunter language, Berman is telling us that Congress has no intention of 
ending the U. S. taxpayers' funding for the crucifixion of El Salvador.

ANOTHER SIDE TO NURSE REGISTRY STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Licensed registries are concerned about the article of June 4 titled "Nursing 
Registries Booming; Some Say Trend is Unhealthy." 
</P>
<P>
There exists another side as yet not represented in this article. 
</P>
<P>
A licensed nurses' registry is not the same as a temporary services agency or 
so-called "registry/agency," which places staff nurses in health facilities at 
a markup of more than 150% to 200% in fees billed to the hospital and 
convalescent hospital by the registry/agency. Such an arrangement leaves the 
agency nurse a poorly paid middleman; the health-care consumer poorly cared 
for; the hospital happy as it did not have to pay good nursing wages, health 
insurance, disability insurance, vacations, etc., and the agency a lot richer. 
The money finds its way back to the owner of the agency and the hospital, but 
never, never the nurse or the health-care consumer. 
</P>
<P>
We look forward to a day when licensed registries, operating under rules, 
regulations and standards set up by the Department of Consumer Affairs and 
State Personnel Board in Sacramento, will have their opportunity to present the 
other side.

FEAR OF WESTLAKE NORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As residents of Lake Lindero, we are very fearful of the Westlake North 
project. The density is enormous. We fear for our lake -- no provision has been 
made for a construction debris basin, no long-range plans for runoff. 
</P>
<P>
To us that means the project doesn't anticipate much runoff due to everything 
being covered with buildings, asphalt, grass and planting. That still permits 
chemical runoff that will disturb the delicate balance of our small lake. 
</P>
<P>
We also fear stepping out of our house on Lake Crest Drive to be cast in the 
shadow of a wall of office buildings. Traffic will be our worst nightmare, well 
on the way to creating another San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
We urge the city of Westlake to please stick to your general plan. Please don't 
sell out your neighbors in Agoura Hills.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN FOUND IN FIELD WAS STABBED TO DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An autopsy on the body of a woman found in a field in Pacoima determined that 
she had been stabbed to death, Los Angeles police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The badly decomposed body was found by a security guard walking to work Sunday 
morning in a field off Osborne Street near the Hansen Dam Recreation Center, 
Detective Al Ferrand said. An autopsy was completed Thursday, and medical 
examiners found multiple stab wounds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
There were no suspects, and investigators had been unable to identify the 
victim. She was described as black, 20 to 35 years old, wearing a black jacket, 
and a pink and black shirt with matching shorts. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrand said detectives were unable to match her description with reports of 
missing women. He said investigators suspect that the woman was killed in the 
field rather than dumped there.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PAROLEE ARRESTED IN SHOOTING INCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 38-year-old parolee was arrested about 3 p.m. Friday after his Sylmar 
neighbors complained that he was firing a gun, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police Lt. George Rock said Steven Dasovich, who lives at the house in the 
15000 block of Paddock Street where he was arrested, was booked on suspicion of 
being an ex-convict in possession of a firearm, a felony. 
</P>
<P>
Rock said Dasovich was on parole from the state Department of Corrections on a 
charge of possessing a dangerous weapon. He was being held at the Van Nuys Jail 
without bail because of the parole violation. 
</P>
<P>
Dasovich fired the sawed-off shotgun at least three times before police entered 
his home and arrested him without incident, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said Dasovich had been drinking the previous night and had also 
disturbed the neighborhood by firing the shotgun. No one was injured by the 
gunshots either Friday or the night before, Rock said.

After years of gang violence, during which he was shot in the leg and one of 
his best friends was shot to death, Frank Bennett got drunk, put a rifle to his 
chest and pulled the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
The suicide attempt 10 years ago left Bennett paralyzed from the waist down and 
confined to a wheelchair, but his gang activities continued. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I couldn't do was walk," Bennett, 28, said recently. "I was 
into partying, hanging out, taking drugs, marijuana, coke, anything that I 
could get." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett abandoned his gang life style more than a year ago. He became a 
Christian and returned to school full time. Recently, he received a high school 
diploma from an adult school.

</P>
<P>
He also received a congressional commendation in recognition of his academic 
achievement. He was awarded a $200 scholarship and plans to enroll at Cerritos 
College in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"After I accepted Christ, I had the desire to go back and finish school," said 
Bennett, who dropped out during his junior year at Gahr High in Cerritos in 
1978 after being shot by rival gang members. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett had been a gang member in an Artesia area known as Chivas. For years, 
his gang has fought with the rival Varrio gang in nearby Norwalk and with gangs 
from other areas. 
</P>
<P>
"They would drive by and shoot into the house," Bennett said. "My mom's car was 
set on fire and burned. Once, a young lady sitting on the sofa was wounded in 
the neck by a bullet. 
</P>
<P>
"We retaliated. I won't be specific but we always retaliated. It was an eye for 
an eye." 
</P>
<P>
A high school friend was shot and killed by a rival gang. And when he was a 
high school junior, Bennett was shot in the leg, forcing him off the track 
team. 
</P>
<P>
He said he dropped out of school after officials demanded that he switch to 
continuation school. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett now goes into the neighborhoods in his wheelchair, preaching 
Christianity and pleading with gang members to quit gang life. 
</P>
<P>
Gangs are "a waste of life, especially for young people," he said. "I wasted my 
early years. I now urge youths not to do the same. I tell them to finish school 
and make a better life for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
When Bennett tells them that it is never too late, he can point to himself as 
an example. 
</P>
<P>
During graduation ceremonies, Bennett was presented with a U. S. Congressional 
Recognition Award from the office of Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), 
whose 38th District includes the ABC Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a significant achievement given for great personal effort. I feel 
really good about the accomplishment of this young man from Artesia," said Jim 
Weisenberg, ABC school board member who presented the award. 
</P>
<P>
A mediocre student during his regular high school days, Bennett said he 
received mostly A's and B's his last year of adult school. 
</P>
<P>
"Frank was one of our oldest graduates. He was also a good student," said 
Marilyn Ghysels, who has taught at the adult school for 11 years. "Frank had 
been coming to adult school off and on since 1985. But the past year, he was 
motivated. Something happened. He turned the corner." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thought About Suicide 
</P>
<P>
Bennett said he started going to church about four years ago, but still was 
taking drugs. About 1 1/2 years ago, he contemplated another suicide attempt. 
"I put a loaded rifle to my head but something told me no," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett said he was helped by a support group that included Larry Rodriguez, 
29, a former gang member and minister in the New Heart Street Ministry, a 
program that attempts to persuade youths to give up gangs and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett, Rodriguez and another former gang member, Ralph Teran, 33, grew up in 
the Southeast area and are friends. 
</P>
<P>
"We walk the streets and tell the gang members, especially the young ones, 
about the dangers of gang activities and drugs," said Rodriguez, a Cerritos 
College graduate who is an electrician for the Los Angeles County Sanitation 
Districts. 
</P>
<P>
They also invite gang members to Bible study sessions at various locations in 
Artesia, Hawaiian Gardens and Burbank, Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett said: "We know it is difficult for them to quit but we tell them it can 
be done." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett said he hopes eventually to find a job in the computer field.

INTERPRETIVE CENTER APPROVED ON SITE NEXT TO MADRONA MARSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Torrance City Council has voted unanimously to set aside a two-acre site 
next to Madrona Marsh to build an interpretive center for the seasonal 
wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
At the recommendation of city naturalist W. Walton Wright, the council also 
voted Tuesday to modify designs for a bike path around the marsh. 
</P>
<P>
There are no proposed designs or cost estimates for the center, but Wright said 
he would like it to be about 12,000 square feet in area and house exhibits, a 
meeting room, public restrooms, a library and a laboratory where exhibits would 
be prepared. 
</P>
<P>
The center, to be located on a vacant triangular parcel at Plaza Del Amo and 
Monterey Street, will include between 50 and 75 parking spaces, Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Wetlands Remaining 
</P>
<P>
City officials said it is too early to estimate how long it will take to 
prepare designs, advertise for bids and begin construction of the center. 
</P>
<P>
Madrona Marsh, which is bounded by Sepulveda Boulevard, Madrona Avenue, Maple 
Avenue and Plaza Del Amo, is one of the few vernal wetlands remaining in 
Southern California and is a refuge for about 140 species of migratory birds, 
frogs, snakes and other small animals. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to move ahead with the center had the support of the Friends of 
Madrona Marsh, an environmental group dedicated to preserving the marsh, which 
has been lobbying for the interpretive center for years. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the council approved plans for a bike path and sidewalk landscaped 
with trees and brush that would weave along the perimeter of the marsh, varying 
40 to 60 feet inward from the street. A 17-foot-wide bike path already exists 
on the edge of the marsh along Sepulveda and part of Madrona. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, who was hired in February as the city's first full-time naturalist to 
oversee preservation of the marsh, met with several city officials and 
suggested that the landscaping be eliminated and that the path be laid out 
closer to the street. 
</P>
<P>
That way, Wright said, the bike path and sidewalk will occupy less marshland 
than under previous plans and will be easier to maintain. 
</P>
<P>
The bike path and sidewalk will run along the border of the marsh on Sepulveda 
Boulevard, Madrona Avenue and Plaza Del Amo. The eastern boundary of the marsh 
along Maple Avenue will contain only a six-foot-wide sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
The bike path will connect with one that runs along Sepulveda, Crenshaw 
Boulevard, Monterey and Madrona. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Changes Get Support 
</P>
<P>
About six members of the Friends of Madrona Marsh attended the meeting, and 
most gave tentative support to the bike path modifications. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Suitt, former president of the group, said he would prefer that the city 
not use marshland for a bike path, but added: "If you must have a bike path, 
then for heaven's sake have it on the edge and make it straight." 
</P>
<P>
City officials have said they believe that the bike path will provide a 
recreational benefit for residents while improving the marsh's appearance. 
</P>
<P>
The marsh was obtained by the city under a 1983 agreement with the developers 
of Park Del Amo, a massive residential and office project next to the marsh. In 
the agreement, the developer won the right to build 1,482 residential units and 
850,000 square feet of office space in exchange for donating 34 1/2 acres of 
marshland and selling an additional 8 1/2 acres to the city. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement required the developer, Torrance Investment Co., to pay for a 
pathway and landscaping along Sepulveda, Madrona and Plaza Del Amo. Parks and 
Recreation Director Gene Barnett estimated that it will cost at least $750,000 
for the complete bike path and sidewalk. The city will pay for the sidewalk 
along Maple Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
60 Days to Act 
</P>
<P>
The developer has 60 days to review and give final approval to the 
modifications approved by the council. 
</P>
<P>
The city has applied for a $427,000 grant from the state Department of Parks 
and Recreation to help pay for other landscaping and improvements to the 
perimeter of the marsh and the medians of some adjacent streets. Wright said he 
is not sure when a decision on the grant is expected. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council also voted to replace the rusting chain-link fence that 
encircles the marsh with a wrought-iron fence. The new fence will cost about 
$80,000 -- about $20,000 more than the cost of a new chain-link fence. City 
Council members said the wrought-iron fence is aesthetically superior. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Katy Geissert said the present chain-link fence diminishes the marsh's 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
She said the city doesn't permit chain-link fences "around people's front 
yards. I don't see why we should have it around this important piece of 
property." 
</P>
<P>
Wright suggested that the city plant only native species of trees and 
vegetation within and along the marsh's perimeter. For example, he suggests the 
city plant weeping willow, sycamore and cottonwood trees instead of eucalyptus 
trees, which inhabit the marsh and adjacent land. 
</P>
<P>
"We should start looking at what the habitat was, and we should try to keep 
that in mind," he said. "A lot of people who have been looking at this have 
been trying to plant trees that would make this look like a botanical garden 
and that is not natural."

AFTER ROBERTS GOES, SO GO THE PADRES IN LOSS TO CARDINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, Times Staff Writer

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bip Roberts, having what he believed was the game of his life, stood in the 
on-deck circle in the eighth inning Friday night watching Cardinal reliever Ken 
Dayley jog in from the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts smiled, barely able to suppress his delight. Having reached base four 
times already, scoring three runs, he now had the opportunity to be the hero. 
There were runners on first and second. Two outs. And the Padres were trailing 
by a run. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the situation any hitter wants to be in," said Roberts, who had a 
triple, two singles and a walk in his first four plate-appearances. "Man, I was 
looking forward to that." 
</P>
<P>
Particularly considering it was Dayley that was coming to the mound. 
</P>
<P>
His confidence would have been soaring with the night he was having anyway, but 
with a left-hander coming in and a .326 average from the right side of the 
plate this season, Roberts was feeling cocky. 
</P>
<P>
And why not? The only other time Roberts had faced Dayley this season, May 11 
in St. Louis, he tripled, knocking him out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
But all of a sudden, while deep in concentration, he heard someone calling his 
name. Who me? He turned around, heard Padre Manager Jack McKeon call his name 
again and watched Carmelo Martinez emerge from the dugout as a pinch-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts slowly retreated to the dugout, put his bat in the bat rack, watched 
Martinez work the count to three-two and closed his eyes when Martinez hit a 
soft popup to right fielder Tom Brunansky for the third out. 
</P>
<P>
One inning later, the game was over. The Padres were 4-3 losers to the St. 
Louis Cardinals. And McKeon was behind his desk answering rounds of questions 
about why he hit for Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a much better hitter from the left side," McKeon explained. 
</P>
<P>
But didn't Roberts enter the game hitting .326 from the right and .234 from the 
left? 
</P>
<P>
"Is that what it is?" McKeon said. "Well, he drives the ball much better from 
the left side." 
</P>
<P>
But doesn't Roberts have three triples and one double from each side of the 
plate? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, they would have played him shallow," McKeon said, "and he might not have 
even driven in a run." 
</P>
<P>
But how about the fact that Roberts already had three hits in the game? 
</P>
<P>
"What's the odds of him getting four?" McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
All of that was beside the point, McKeon said. He explained that Martinez is 
his best pinch-hitter, with four hits in his past five pinch-hitting 
appearances before Friday. So what if he's hitting .221 this season, while 
Roberts is hitting .301? 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't understand that one," Cardinal Manager Whitey Herzog said. "I guess 
he (McKeon) was going for the long ball. I was kind of surprised." 
</P>
<P>
Said Martinez: "I'm glad he had confidence to put me in that situation, but to 
tell you the truth, I was a little surprised myself. Bip was hitting the ball 
great." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon's strategy would have been a moot point, anyway, if the Padres had 
managed to hit in clutch situations, but they instead squandered most of their 
12 hits, stranding 12 runners. 
</P>
<P>
They even had a chance to at least tie up to the final out of the game, after 
Tony Gwynn hit a one-out double in the ninth. But there he remained, as Jack 
Clark hit a weak popup and Marvell Wynne grounded to first. 
</P>
<P>
It all provided Scott Terry (6-7) with the victory. Walt Terrell lost his 11th 
game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
But while Terrell could have joined in along with almost everyone else and 
second-guessed McKeon's decision, he was left deep in thought over his own 
misery. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't deserve to win anyway, not with a linescore that showed that he 
allowed eight hits and four earned runs in five innings. 
</P>
<P>
But one pitch, a changeup that hung over the plate, left him with a feeling of 
misery. 
</P>
<P>
The game-winning hit was not provided by Tom Brunansky. Not Pedro Guerrero. Not 
even Ozzie Smith. 
</P>
<P>
He was beaten by a home run that traveled 408 feet by -- oh, no -- Terry, the 
pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"That's very tough to take," Terrell said. 
</P>
<P>
"I had him oh-two, so I figured I'd waste a pitch. I'd throw him a changeup in 
the dirt and come back with a fastball. 
</P>
<P>
"I never got the chance to come back with that fastball." 
</P>
<P>
To be fair, Terry is not your typical pitcher. He was drafted by the Cincinnati 
Reds for the outfield, where he spent the first 3 1/2 years of his professional 
career before becoming a pitcher in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Still, until this season, he had not hit a home run since 1982, when he played 
for Cedar Rapids in single-A. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll never hear the end of it now," Brunansky said. "A pitcher has got the 
two longest home runs here (this season). But really, that's bull. I could 
believe the first one, but no way this one went over 400 feet. They got to be 
bring some professor in to measure this one again. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't get on the stick, we'll never hear the end of it." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Padres did not arrive to their hotel in St. Louis until 7 Friday morning, 
just 12 1/2 hours before game time. "Everybody was complaining about it, but 
you know what?" third baseman Tim Flannery said. "I kind of liked it. I got to 
see the see the sun come up. It was kind of a spiritual thing." Teammate Garry 
Templeton, overhearing the conversation, said: "You're crazy, man." . . . 
Pitcher Fred Toliver, acquired Wednesday by the Padres from the Minnesota Twins 
in exchange for pitcher Greg Booker, was in uniform Friday for the first time. 
Toliver originally was penciled in as the Twins' No. 1 right-handed starter at 
the beginning of spring training, was out of the rotation by the start of the 
season and was down to the Twins' triple-A club by mid-May. "I think there was 
too much hype, really," Toliver said. "I think I should have been left in there 
and given a chance to get in a groove. They had me all messed up. When I went 
to the ballpark, I didn't know if I was going to be sitting around for four 
days waiting for me next start, or pitching in the fifth inning." . . . The 
Padres pulled a prank on third-base coach Sandy Alomar by putting the jersey of 
batting coach Amos Otis in his locker, and Alomar, perhaps still weary from the 
trip from Los Angeles, never noticed. He wore Otis' jersey in the first inning 
before finally being told of the gag, then switched by the time the Padres 
batted in the second. . . . Jerald Clark homered on consecutive at-bats in 
triple-A Las Vegas' 4-3 victory over Phoenix Friday. Reliever Dave Leiper, on 
rehabilitation assignment from the Padres, allowed just one hit in two innings 
for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Ozzie Smith, the Cardinals' $2 million shortstop, broke the third toe in his 
right foot during the Cardinals' off-day Thursday morning when he bumped into a 
cedar chest on his way to the bathroom. Smith will remain in the lineup, 
however, with his third and fourth toes taped together.

IT'S UNLIKELY THAT SMALL VICTORIES WILL CHANGE ROSE'S FATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Pete Rose is two for two against the commissioner of baseball, A. Bartlett 
Giamatti, but what's it gotten him? Developing is a sad pattern for Rose that 
very likely began quite a while before this week: short-term success, long-term 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
Rose is in a rundown just now and about the only thing in his favor is that he 
apparently will determine where he gets tagged: in Giamatti's office or a 
court. The closer this Rose gets examined the less fragrant the aroma. 
</P>
<P>
The matter is where it ought to be, under scrutiny by someone outside baseball, 
even if the judge sits in Rose's home town and stands soon for reelection. I'm 
uncomfortable with the commissioner of any sport being able to act as 
prosecutor and judge. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Giamatti has been fair to Rose. Dumb, for writing that letter in support 
of Rose's chief accuser and thus weakening baseball's once-firm position with 
the courts, but generally generous. 
</P>
<P>
By late April, Giamatti seemed to have enough evidence to do to Rose what 
former commissioner Bowie Kuhn had done to Denny McLain: suspend him. During 
his two days of depositions, April 20 and 21, Rose admitted owing a bookmaker 
$34,000 in the spring of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Rose said: "I'm guilty of one thing in this whole mess, and 
that's I was a (bad) selector of friends." In baseball, that's a punishable 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti could have said to Rose: "You have a gambling appetite that's a major 
problem for you and a minor one for us. Even if you've never bet on baseball, 
there's the appearance that you could be compromised. Take some time off. 
Straighten yourself out." 
</P>
<P>
That would have cut everybody's losses. Giamatti pressed on -- and, when Rose 
wanted more time to respond to investigator John Dowd's report, he got it. 
</P>
<P>
Rose on Sunday won a temporary restraining order from a Cincinnati judge to 
block a Monday hearing with Giamatti. Monday was a blue one for Rose anyway, 
because the Ohio Supreme Court triggered the avalanche of accusations that came 
tumbling into public view. 
</P>
<P>
The 225-page Dowd report and accompanying exhibits were stunning beyond what 
even those cynical about Rose had imagined. As always with baseball, the stats 
were most revealing. The relevant ones against Rose were those in tiny type 
that listed the alleged baseball bets placed by him from April 8 to July 5, 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
It took 15 inches of agate to report those 88 days of action. The box score of 
most major-league games runs three inches. So the space necessary to report 
allegations of specific baseball bets by Rose before the all-star break could 
have housed five complete box scores. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not baseball that first placed the report into the public record," a 
spokesman for Giamatti said. It was Rose. 
</P>
<P>
Even worse were charges not included in Dowd's report but part of the seven 
volumes of exhibits: that Rose wanted to get involved in cocaine deals, that 
Rose once said he might throw a game if the bet was a large enough amount. 
</P>
<P>
According to one of Rose's two chief accusers, Paul Janszen: "He did say to me 
once, he said, 'You know, if I had enough money riding on a game, I'd think 
about throwing the game' ... He said there are a lot of easy ways to do it. He 
said, 'Hell, Paul, hell, I could pinch-hit a guy at the wrong (time) ... or hit 
and run at the wrong time. I could have a guy bunt at the wrong time.' " 
</P>
<P>
This supports why in baseball guilt-by-association is especially severe. There 
are so many ways a player or manager can influence games. And baseball, as well 
as any sport, has little to sell other than integrity. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone in baseball who gambles seriously on other sports chips away at 
integrity; anyone in baseball who bets on baseball hammers away at integrity; 
anyone in baseball who bets on his own team blows integrity away. 
</P>
<P>
It sometimes is worse when someone who has bet on his own team all of a sudden 
doesn't. In a manager's case, the implication is no confidence, or perhaps an 
injury not known outside the team. The obvious signal: If I'm not betting on 
us, dash to bet against us. 
</P>
<P>
Let's give Rose the presumption of innocence he deserves. Let's say he 
maneuvers his case away from Giamatti and into court. Let's say he picks apart 
everything Dowd has accumulated and wins. 
</P>
<P>
How might he be judged outside the law? 
</P>
<P>
In many situations, the fluff is what sticks. Scenes and quotes that never get 
attended to during the normal progress of justice outside of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
From Rose during his deposition is the admission that middleman Tommy Gioiosa 
"called me up and said this guy was going to burn my house down and break my 
kid's legs if I didn't pay him." 
</P>
<P>
From Janszen to baseball's investigators is Rose saying to him in reference to 
a bookmaker delinquent on his $40,000 payment: "Paul, you go up there, take a 
gun if you have to, get my money." 
</P>
<P>
Baseball will survive this. It will survive Giamatti's blunder. It will even 
survive some tinkering with the overly awesome powers of the commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Rose's judgment, denial after denial, causes deeper concern. Proving prejudice 
to Judge Norbert N. Nadel led to his soon being savaged by David Letterman. To 
get his day in court, Rose risked humiliation even if he walks out not guilty.

MORNING BRIEFING: FINALLY, IT'S PLAYERS' TURN TO DO THE WAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Houston relief pitcher Dave Smith and San Diego infielder Tim Flannery are 
longtime California surfing buddies who are building a house on a parcel of 
land they bought on the Hollister Ranch north of Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very private, no telephones, no newspapers," Flannery told the Houston 
Chronicle. "Just coastal mountains and great surf. I took Smitty up there, and 
we went straight for the water. Smitty didn't even look at the tract of land we 
were considering. After a lot of great waves, he said, 'Who do I write the 
check to and how much?' " 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that construction on the home is behind schedule, but said that was 
understandable. 
</P>
<P>
"We found some surfing carpenters," Smith said. "We gave them rights to the 
ranch, and they gave us a great bid. How can we blame them?" 
</P>
<P>
Well, no wonder: Said publicist Richard Griffin of the Montreal Expos, upon 
hearing that pitcher Pascual Perez had been accused of loading up the ball with 
an illegal substance: "Pascual Perez is an illegal substance." 
</P>
<P>
Olfactory observations: Steve Sabol of NFL Films, putting together a special on 
the Raiders, told the Houston Chronicle that he interviewed John Matuszak 10 
days before the former Raider's death and found him upbeat and typically zany. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, he said he could tell players by the smell of their cologne," 
Sabol said. "He knew that Ron Jaworski wore English Leather and Jerry Sisemore 
used Aqua Velva. Now there's something you don't hear from a typical NFL 
player."

Trivia time: What NBA players were called the Bruise Brothers?

<P>
Right, Coach: Yankee owner George Steinbrenner told the New York Times that he 
was squarely behind Manager Dallas Green but added, "Certain things he does 
sometimes make me feel like I'm the principal of the school in the movie, 
'Hoosiers.' The principal says to the coach, 'I wish I could understand why 
you're doing these things,' and the coach, Gene Hackman, says, 'Believe me, I 
know what I'm doing.' I hope he's right."

<P>
A bad spell: From Furman Bisher of the Atlanta Journal: "Sign of the times: 
'Erase illiterussy.' "

Trivia answer: Jeff Ruland and Rick Mahorn of the Washington Bullets. 
</P>
<P>
Now-it-can-be told Dept.: When the Toronto Blue Jays were coveting Lou Piniella 
as their new manager, C. Ray Hall of the Louisville Courier-Journal wrote: 
"Recently, George Steinbrenner had Piniella slip out of the broadcasting booth 
to tutor one of his minions on hitting, so that in the event Toronto ended up 
hiring Lou, he could hold the Jays up for compensation for losing a part-time 
coach. No fool, this boy Georgie."

SILVER BULLET LEADS FLEET OF 49 YACHTS IN AN ORDERLY START OF TRANSPAC RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A light, southwesterly breeze greeted the 49 sailing yachts that showed up for 
the start of the 35th Transpac race from Los Angeles to Honolulu Friday. 
</P>
<P>
It was an orderly start, with John DeLaura's Santa Cruz-70, Silver Bullet, 
leading the ultra-light 70-raters across the line as the fleet headed toward 
the west end of Catalina Island, first and only mark of the 2,225-mile course 
to Diamond Head on the island of Oahu. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Cruz-70, Citius, out of Los Angeles Yacht Club, withdrew before the 
race because of rigging problems, leaving 19 of the so-called 'sleds' seeking 
to better the elapsed-time record of 8 days 11 hours set by Merlin in 1983. 
Merlin is also entered in this year's race. 
</P>
<P>
Attempting to repeat her 1987 win is SC-70 Drumbeat, skippered by Don Ayres Jr. 
of Newport Beach. Drumbeat was two hours short of the record in '87. 
</P>
<P>
After rounding Catalina Island, skippers and crews will be watching their 
weather maps for the location of the Pacific High, a windless area that shifts 
around the ocean and could stall the boats for days. The yachts were not 
expected to pick up the northeast tradewinds before Tuesday, allowing them to 
set their big downwind spinnakers.

DISCERNING EYES TO WATCH ALL-STAR FOOTBALL GAME; 
</P>
<P>
BURBANK-GLENDALE CONTEST PROVIDES OPPORTUNITY FOR COLLEGE COACHES TO MAKE 
LAST-MINUTE EVALUATIONS 
</P>

Exposure. 
</P>
<P>
It's the name of the game for the have-nots of the college football world, and 
it's a precious commodity during the summer as athletes and schools make their 
final bids for each other. 
</P>
<P>
The first all-star football game between players from the Burbank and Glendale 
areas tonight at 7:30 at Burroughs High will offer added exposure for high 
school players hoping to continue their playing careers, and plenty of coaches 
will be on hand seeking to round out their recruiting classes. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first year of this game, and I think it's going to help give a few 
young men more exposure," East Los Angeles College Coach Al Padilla said. "It 
gives them one more opportunity to display their talents. 
</P>
<P>
"The point of it is how many can get (a scholarship) as a result of this game." 
</P>
<P>
It is unlikely that this contest will be confused with the Shrine Game. The 
players are hardly blue-chippers; most are a step slow, a few inches short or 
20 pounds light. For some the game will be a last hurrah. For others it offers 
one last chance to turn a college coach's head with a crushing hit or 
tackle-breaking run. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll play in two all-star games right now and see if I get picked up or not," 
said Glendale fullback Rafik Thorossian, who is also scheduled to compete in 
the San Gabriel Valley Hall of Fame game. Thorossian plans to play at Glendale 
College, but he hopes to elicit some interest from Division I schools with his 
all-star performances. 
</P>
<P>
"My coaches said I could go Division I," Thorossian said. "I'll walk on, 
anything to get the chance." 
</P>
<P>
While USC, UCLA and other major football powers have long since filled their 
recruiting classes, junior colleges are still scrambling for players and a 
stray scholarship or walk-on invitation might be available at smaller 
universities. A strong performance tonight could change a borderline talent's 
football future. 
</P>
<P>
"That's basically what it is," said guard Leon Panduro of Crescenta Valley 
High. "Besides having fun, a lot of guys are trying to get schools interested 
in them.. . . . (The coaches) told us there are going to be plenty of scouts, 
and these (players) will be keying up, trying to get some notoriety." 
</P>
<P>
Like several other participants tonight, Panduro hopes to join a college 
football program as a walk on. Panduro and other potential walk-ons will try to 
answer not only coaches' doubts but their own. 
</P>
<P>
"It will give me a chance to prove myself one last time," said Burbank center 
Cory Kessinger, who would like to play at Glendale College. "If I do good in 
this game maybe I can go to college and play, but I'm tentative because I don't 
know if I'm good enough to play college level." 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Russell Greene of North Hollywood High has no doubts about his 
ability. He is scheduled for three all-star games but is still in the market 
for a Division I scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I was overlooked because my school, North Hollywood, doesn't have a 
very good reputation. We don't get scouted very much," he said. "I'm interested 
in going to San Diego State, so I hope they'll go to the game." 
</P>
<P>
And so the recruiting dance drags on into the dog days of summer. The trick is 
to find the best partner, and for those still on the dance floor, that's what 
games like tonight's are all about.

PAEZ SELECTED FOR CLEVELAND BASKETBALL JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marc Paez, an assistant from St. Bernard High in Playa del Rey, will be given 
the chance to replace Bob Braswell as head basketball coach at Cleveland High, 
Cleveland Principal Ida Mae Windham said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Paez said Friday evening that he had not been officially offered the job and 
had no other comment pending notification. But Windham, who said that she was 
unable throughout the day to reach Paez to make an official offer, said that 
the job was his to refuse. 
</P>
<P>
"Marc has the skill as a basketball coach, but he's also credentialed -- with 
teaching experience in English -- and should be able to fit into the entire 
school program," Windham said. 
</P>
<P>
Paez, 29, who emerged from a list of 12 interviewees, would be expected to take 
over Braswell's teaching load of three periods of English and one course in 
both student government and physical education, Windham said. 
</P>
<P>
Paez would replace Braswell -- who resigned two weeks ago to become an 
assistant at Cal State Long Beach -- as coach of what has been the Valley's 
most successful program in the 1980s. He has coached the junior varsity at St. 
Bernard for the past seven seasons and also has coached in the Southern 
California Summer Pro League at Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Paez was the general manager of the pro league, which includes a 
potpourri of players from the National Basketball Assn., Europe, the 
Continental Basketball Assn. as well as free agents. He served as a coach in 
the league for two summers but has said that what he really desired was a high 
school program of his own. 
</P>
<P>
"I've wanted to be a high school head coach for a long time," Paez, a graduate 
of St. Bernard and UCLA, said earlier this week. "To leave St. Bernard, it 
would take an awfully good position, and Cleveland is one of the best programs 
in the state." 
</P>
<P>
For the past four years, Paez has been dean of students at St. Bernard, a 
parochial school of 1,250 students. Additionally, he taught one period of 
English for the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland was 75-19 in Braswell's tenure and often was ranked among the state's 
best teams. 
</P>
<P>
Braswell, who contacted Paez two weeks ago to notify him that the position 
would soon be vacant, urged Windham to hire Paez. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly from the aspect of the sport, his input was important," Windham said 
of Braswell. "I trust his judgment and know that his recommendation would have 
the kids' interests in mind." 
</P>
<P>
Paez also fits into the school's demographic picture. 
</P>
<P>
Windham said that filling the position with a minority was a consideration 
because the Los Angeles Unified School District requires certain levels of 
minority representation on school faculties. Paez, who is part Filipino and 
American Indian, would replace Braswell, who is black. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland has several key returning players. Bobby McRae will return to start 
at forward, and among reserves, center-forward Trenton Cornelius and guards 
Eddie Hill and Andre Chevalier also will be back from last season's team, which 
finished 21-3. In the past two years alone, Cleveland has sent seven players to 
the Division I ranks. 
</P>
<P>
Windham said that although it probably will take several weeks to process the 
official paper work with the district, Paez will be given the green light to 
coach the Cavaliers in summer league play immediately. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Cleveland will open play in the Slam-N-Jam high school tournament 
against Hawthorne High at 3 p.m. at Carson High. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament concludes next Saturday.

TAKING A GENTLER APPROACH;

DAVE FERNANDEZ PUTS WILD DAYS BEHIND IN PURSUIT OF GOLF CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH TOSCHES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Golfers tend not to be the madmen of the world. They usually come from country 
club families where the pets wear sweaters and are named after a 
great-grandfather. If you see a tattoo on a golfer, you can bet a week's pay 
it's one of those lick-'em and stick-'em types that came in a box of Cracker 
Jack. 
</P>
<P>
Golfers generally are not raised in an environment that encourages hellish 
behavior. Secondly, a golfer with dreams of making it big on the pro circuit 
cannot afford injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Which is roughly what flashed through the mind of Dave Fernandez on a hot 
summer day three years ago during that brief moment between his departure from 
the seat of a fast-moving motorcycle and his arrival onto the hard-packed 
earth. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, who led his Mission College team to the state junior college golf 
championship in 1984, landed on his right shoulder. A second after hearing many 
snapping and popping sounds, he heard himself screaming. 
</P>
<P>
His shoulder was in shambles. The impact had torn the bone of his upper arm -- 
the humerus, and it most certainly wasn't -- 3 1/2 inches out of its socket, 
doctors told him. In addition, the bone in the shoulder to which the biceps 
muscle and several tendons are attached was broken in several places. 
</P>
<P>
The shoulder is crucial to a golf swing. It controls virtually the entire 
movement. Even slight shoulder injuries have sent many a golfer back to the 
racks of bland, ordinary pants. 
</P>
<P>
A few days after the crash, Fernandez asked the doctors who had put him back 
together what the chances were of him continuing his golf career. They told 
him, in essence, that the odds were roughly the same as Elvis Presley resuming 
his singing career. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez laughed at them. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me that as a golfer, I couldn't have possibly done anything worse to 
my body than what I had done to my shoulder," said Fernandez, of Woodland 
Hills. "The told me to forget golf. Just to forget it. I told them, 'No way.' I 
was just 23 and I still felt invincible." 
</P>
<P>
The doctors told Fernandez that he might be able to begin stretching and 
exercising the shoulder in six months. Less than four months after they told 
him that, however, he was back on a golf course. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't tell them," he said. "I didn't want anyone telling me again that I 
couldn't do it. That's all I had heard from them. For a few months it was 
pretty ridiculous. I'd swing the club somehow and hit the ball, and then walk 
down the fairway with my arm just dangling at my side. Sometimes I couldn't 
even raise it." 
</P>
<P>
But within a few weeks of his return, Fernandez was shooting in the 70s again. 
</P>
<P>
"Somehow, I was still able to hit the ball and still able to score OK," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It was, he said, the first time he began to realize that he had a lot of 
natural ability. He never played golf as a child and only played on rare 
occasions as a student at Taft High. But after graduation from high school, he 
decided to learn to play the game. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later he was helping Mission College to the state title. 
</P>
<P>
"It always came so easy to me," Fernandez said. "But I never really thought 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
What he did think about as a youngster was surfing. He and his surfer buddies 
regarded golfers as a subtle blend of dead people and living -- but poorly 
dressed -- people. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a surfer," he said. "An everyday surfer. We did nothing else." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, in what he said was his first full year of playing pain-free golf 
since the motorcycle accident, he began doing nothing else but winning golf 
tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
He captured the Oxnard City Championship, the Lompoc City Championship and a 
handful of events on the Golden State Tour early in the year, and then finished 
third in the Los Angeles City Championship. 
</P>
<P>
But in April of this year, the pain returned. Nerves damaged in the accident 
became inflamed again. 
</P>
<P>
"At times, I couldn't even hold a club," said Fernandez, 26. "I tried to keep 
playing, but I just couldn't." 
</P>
<P>
So he put the clubs away for a few months and allowed the nerves to re-heal. 
"It's no fun when you're not playing well, and I definitely wasn't playing 
well," he said. "The rest was good for me." 
</P>
<P>
He began playing daily a few weeks ago and now feels he is ready to make a 
return to the course. He knows he still has a lot of potential. And others know 
it, too. Earlier this week, he received an invitation to play in the 
prestigious Pacific Coast Amateur Championship. This year's event will be held 
Aug. 1-4 at the famed Olympic Club in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been playing a lot and it's promising," said Fernandez, a construction 
worker. "I'm not real confident in my game yet, but I am real confident that I 
can work myself back to my best level." 
</P>
<P>
And he has vowed that, for the first time in his life, he will take golf 
seriously. He can, he thinks, carry it a long way. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never put much into the game of golf," he said. "Maybe I gave it 10% of 
my time and interest. I've never practiced the game very seriously until now. 
During the next year and a half or two years I'm going to find out just how 
good I can get. My goal is to make myself good enough to have a shot at turning 
professional. In my job, I often think about it when I'm covered with dirt and 
sweat every day. 
</P>
<P>
"I've lived a hard and fast life, one not geared toward a golf career. It has 
hurt me a lot in any chance I might have had for a career in golf. But it has 
taught me a lot too." 
</P>
<P>
An example? 
</P>
<P>
"I bought a new motorcycle last year. I haven't ever ridden it," he said. "And 
I never will. It's on its way out. I don't have time or room for that kind of 
stuff anymore. It's time to get serious about this game."

AT 15, JUDO COMPETITORS ALREADY AT THE TOP -- AND HEADED UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Athletes who win national championships usually must work many years before 
doing so. And the thought of repeating that feat can seem overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
But at 15 years old, Valerie Lafon and Andrea Jones of San Diego already have 
13 national judo titles between them. 
</P>
<P>
Lafon and Jones, who have been participating in the sport since age 4 and 
competing since 6, will compete today in United States Judo Assn. Junior 
Nationals at the Town and Country Hotel Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
The two-day, double-elimination tournament began Friday with the 6- through 
12-year-old divisions and will conclude today with the 13-to-20-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
Both girls were born into judo families and are coached by their fathers. 
Gerald Lafon is the coach at Byakko Judo Institute, and Jesse Jones coaches at 
the Unidos Judo Clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's harder with dad always pushing me harder than other students," Valerie 
said. "Then you have him at home to tell you to run or do extra stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Because of their caliber, Valerie and Andrea have a tough time finding adequate 
practice partners and usually must rely on their fathers for a workout. 
</P>
<P>
"She usually winds up beating me up," Gerald said. "In America there aren't as 
many women judo players, so the coach winds up being a key training part for 
the better ones. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a small man and with my experience can give her the resistence and 
necessary moves to make her better." 
</P>
<P>
Gerald's pushing and encouragement have paid off for Valerie, who has won eight 
consecutive national titles and became a member of the U.S. national judo team 
at 14. Her improvement has been continuous and steady over the years, and she's 
right on schedule to reach her goal of making the 1992 Olympic team, Gerald 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"At 15, Valerie is a very mature player. She's still considered a junior 
(because of her age), but she's definitely a senior player," Gerald said. 
</P>
<P>
Valerie today will be competing in two divisions -- junior women (15-16) at 110 
pounds and senior women (17-20) at 114. Lafon, a first-degree black belt, 
usually competes at 106 but is moving up for more resistence and competition. 
Jones will be competing in the senior women's 132-pound class. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never played these heavier girls, so I don't know how these girls will 
play," Lafon said. 
</P>
<P>
Both agree that in a tournament such as this, where there is no distinction 
between rankings, the belt you wear doesn't mean much. Lafon said that over the 
years she has defeated a number of girls with higher rankings. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't go in big headed," said Jones, a third-degree brown belt. "You can 
get beaten by someone three belts lower than you." 
</P>
<P>
Teams from Canada, Puerto Rico, Brazil will compete in the tournament. This 
will be Jones' first experience with international competition, and she is 
anxious to see how the different countries train and compete. 
</P>
<P>
Lafon has competed in six countries. She has just returned from Brazil where, 
as a member of the U.S. national team, she took first at 106 pounds in the Kodo 
Kan Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"Every country has its own style," Lafon said. "The European girls are a lot 
stronger, and they crunch you down. The Japanese girls aren't strong at all but 
have a lot of technique." 
</P>
<P>
Lafon attends judo camps each summer and July 7 will fly to France for a 
week-long camp with women from all over the world. From France, she will travel 
to Oklahoma for her first appearance at the National Sports Festival, where she 
will compete at 106 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
In the summer between camps and tournaments, the girls intensify their 
training. During the school year, Lafon said, she practices four days a week, 
two hours a day. During the summer, that increases to six days a week. The 
girls also lift weights and run or bike for an aerobic workout. 
</P>
<P>
Besides judo, Lafon has played soccer off and on since she was 8. But because 
of her travel schedule, she can't be on a team other than that at University of 
San Diego High School. She played for the Dons last year as sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
Jones said that in 11 years of judo, she has never wanted to quit.

"I've never really been burned out," Jones said. "If you stay away (from the 
sport) it's hard to get back into it. I take two weeks off if I really need 
it."

BORN IN THE MAJORS, CHRIS CANNIZZARO JR. HAS BEEN ATTEMPTING TO RETURN AS A 
PLAYER

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To say Chris Cannizzaro Jr. grew up with baseball is like saying that Hank 
Williams Jr. grew up with music, or that Edsel and Henry Ford II grew up with 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 23, 1962, Christopher John Jr. was born the first son of New York Mets 
catcher Chris Cannizzaro Sr. He was the first newborn for a member of the 
National League expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
"On my birthday, until I was about 5, all the old Mets used to send me 
presents," Cannizzaro said. "I think my mother still has some of them." 
</P>
<P>
A few years later, Chris Jr. went on trips with his father, playing catch and 
taking batting practice in every National League park. 
</P>
<P>
On the Padres' first opening day in 1969, Cannizzaro, then 7, sat in San Diego 
Stadium with his mother, Beverley, and his younger sister, Kimberlee, and 
watched Chris Sr. catch the first game in Padre history. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years later, Chris Sr. is hoping to someday watch his son play major 
league baseball. But there remains a question about when, and even if, that is 
going to happen. 
</P>
<P>
After successful years at Patrick Henry High (where he was an all-section 
shortstop while leading the Patriots to the 1980 3-A championship) and San 
Diego State (where he was an All-American second baseman in 1982), Cannizzaro 
is in his seventh season in the Boston Red Sox minor league system. 
</P>
<P>
Having spent the past 3 1/2 years with triple-A Pawtucket, Cannizzaro is still 
waiting for that first major league swing. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're a kid," Cannizzaro said, "you don't really think about what you're 
going to do for a living. I never really expected to be in the big leagues. I 
just enjoyed playing the game. It was a way of identity for me. It was what I 
did. That's what I was associated with. I think baseball kept me clean and out 
of trouble, at least somewhat." 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Henry Coach Bob Imlay said that because of Cannizzaro's early 
association with big leaguers, "He was the most polished, skill-wise and 
emotionally, kid I ever had. He told me his dad never pushed him, but he 
learned a lot just by watching and mimicking the big leaguers. He was led by 
example. 
</P>
<P>
"He never wasted any time on the field. He was always working on something. I 
remember him telling me once that Pete Rose was his idol. Because of his style 
of play, of course." 
</P>
<P>
Cannizzaro is 5-feet-8, 170 pounds, short and slightly stocky. His primary 
position is second base, although he can play any infield position and has been 
used in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
He is a switch hitter who uses the whole field from both sides of the plate. He 
hits for average, scores a lot of runs, makes things happen with his heads-up 
style and hits occasional home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Batting third for Pawtucket, which plays in the International League (known for 
low batting averages) Cannizzaro leads the team with a .270 average and 29 runs 
batted in. For whatever reason, and Cannizzaro could not explain it, he had no 
home runs in his first 200 at-bats this season after hitting eight last year. 
But in his next 38 at-bats, he hit five and had his first two-homer game as a 
professional last week. 
</P>
<P>
"He plays every game like it was his last," Chris Sr. said. "And that's the 
only way I ever taught him. I never pushed him into baseball. He always wanted 
to play. He always had enthusiasm. The only advice I gave him was to play hard. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I taught him the intricate parts of baseball, like where to play a 
certain batter and what to do with a three-and-one pitch, but Chris is his own 
person. He's done it being Chris Cannizzaro Jr. not because of Chris Cannizzaro 
Sr." 
</P>
<P>
At Patrick Henry, Cannizzaro hit in the low .400s and was awarded the team 
captain trophy after the season (Detroit Tiger catcher Matt Nokes was the most 
valuable player). Cannizzaro was not drafted and received no scholarship 
offers. 
</P>
<P>
He instead walked on at SDSU and made the varsity his freshman season. By his 
sophomore year, he had established himself as one of the best second basemen in 
the nation. He made the American Baseball Coaches Assn. All-America team after 
batting .348 with 101 hits (second best in Aztec history at the time), 48 RBIs, 
68 walks and 30 stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
His junior year was considerably better, but he was left off the All-America 
team. He hit .363 (98 for 270) with four home runs, 60 RBIs, 83 walks and 39 
stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
"Those were the learning years," Cannizzaro said. "Coach (Jim) Dietz was a very 
dedicated coach. I learned a great deal from him." 
</P>
<P>
At SDSU, Cannizzaro played with future big leaguers Tony and Chris Gwynn, Bobby 
Meacham, Al Newman and Mark Williamson. The Aztecs were always in the top 20, 
reaching No. 1 for about a month during Cannizzaro's junior year. 
</P>
<P>
After his junior year in 1983, Cannizzaro was invited to play for the U.S. 
all-star team, which would become the 1984 Olympic team. But he also was 
drafted in the ninth round by the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the hardest decision I had to make up to that point," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cannizzaro chose to forgo both his senior year and the Olympics and sign with 
Boston. That summer and the next, he played Class-A ball in Winter Haven, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, he was promoted to double-A in New Britain, Conn. After one year, it 
was on to Pawtucket, where Cannizzaro has been for 3 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I never put any timetable on making it to the majors," he said. "But I thought 
because of how fast I got to triple-A, that I would be there by now." 
</P>
<P>
He added, "No question, it gets frustrating. But if you dwell on that, that 
you're one level away from your goal, you're going to hurt your performance on 
that level. Of course, I want to play in the big leagues, but more importantly 
I want to enjoy life. I want to be happy. And right now, playing baseball on 
any level is enjoyable. It makes me happy. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had an enjoyable minor league career. The only bad part is I've been 
bypassed by the big club three or four times." 
</P>
<P>
Once was about a month ago. On June 4, Boston's regular second baseman, Marty 
Barrett, suffered torn cartilage in his right knee and was placed on the 21-day 
disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
Cannizzaro, then hitting around .280, thought he surely would get the call. He 
felt he deserved to be called up. He had performed consistently well at the 
highest level of minor league baseball for four seasons. He was ready. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox opted for Pawtucket's shortstop, Luis Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
"When Marty Barrett went down, I thought, 'This is it.' But they bring up a 
shortstop who's hitting .250 and I'm hitting .280 at the time. I understand 
(management's)thinking. They had traded for (Rivera) last winter. He has a year 
of big league experience, and he was the last one cut from spring training." 
</P>
<P>
Cannizzaro made it to the second-to-last cut. 
</P>
<P>
So what happens? 
</P>
<P>
"He goes up there and tears it up," Cannizzaro said. "And I'm happy for him. 
But that tells me I could do the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his lengthy stay in triple-A and his being passed over on a number of 
occasions, Cannizzaro is not bitter toward the Red Sox management. But neither 
is he happy. He has asked to be released or traded, but each time management 
has refused. 
</P>
<P>
After this season, his seventh in the minors, he will become a free agent. But 
he is uncertain of his future. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned that the only thing that is certain, is that nothing is certain," 
he said. "If I retire, having never made it, but knowing I was a good triple-A 
ballplayer, that's OK, I can live with that."

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: SOCKERS RENEW ARENA LEASE FOR NEXT SEASON

<TEXT>
<P>
The Sockers, encouraged by Major Indoor Soccer League Commissioner Earl 
Foreman, signed a one-year lease renewal for the San Diego Sports Arena Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"A big hurdle is past today," Socker President Ron Cady said. "I feel a lot 
better than I did 24 hours ago." 
</P>
<P>
Cady said the Sockers are sticking to their original position that they will 
only compete if there are eight teams in the league. Because the Los Angeles 
Lazers have folded, the future of both the Sockers and the MISL probably rests 
with St. Louis' plans to become the league's second expansion franchise next 
season, joining the Cleveland Crunch. 
</P>
<P>
Cady said Foreman expressed optimism that the league would wind up with eight 
teams for the 1989-90 season. 
</P>
<P>
MISL owners and coaches will meet next week in Wichita to finalize financial 
details and commitments for next season.

Kevin Bradley of Las Vegas recorded the day's biggest upset when he ousted 
third-seeded Brian Turner of San Diego in the men's open division of the 73rd 
La Jolla Beach and Tennis Championships. Bradley defeated two-time open winner 
Turner, 6-1, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Defending open champion and top-seeded Yoiam Baron of San Diego defeated San 
Diego's Jon Hoffpanir, 6-1, 6-1, in the tournament's second round of 32. All 
other seeded players advanced to today's third round, which begins at 9 a.m. at 
the La Jolla Recreation Center. 
</P>

In the first round of women's open play, fourth-seeded Christy Drage of San 
Diego defeated Jennifer Demsey of Rancho Santa Fe, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4. The top three

WALK OF FAME; 
</P>
<P>
STARS AND GRIPES IN HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the secret selection committee wrapped up its annual June meeting, the 
Hollywood Walk of Fame remained without some of the brightest lights in the 
film industry -- names such as Dustin Hoffman, Clint Eastwood, Steven 
Spielberg, Meryl Streep, Paul Newman and George C. Scott. 
</P>
<P>
But actor DeForest Kelley was no longer among them. Who is DeForest Kelley? He 
played Dr. Leonard (Bones) McCoy on the television and movie series "Star 
Trek," and in fact is the fourth member of the cast -- after William Shatner, 
Leonard Nimoy and George Takei -- to be honored with a star. Even Gene 
Roddenberry, the creator of the popular "Star Trek" series, now has a star on 
the world-famous sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
The reason the "Star Trek" crew has gone where so many great film stars have 
not is simple. Paramount Pictures, creator of the movies about the starship 
Enterprise, wanted it that way. The studio has timed the awarding of stars in 
its "Star Trek" galaxy to coincide with the release of the pictures. Indeed, 
Kelley's star was announced even as the starship was carrying the studio's 
box-office fortunes in the newly released "Star Trek V: The Final Frontier." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Advantageous Time 
</P>
<P>
As one Paramount executive put it: "It costs money to put a star in there. It's 
of no value to the studio -- or to anyone, for that matter -- if it's not 
(done) at an advantageous time." 
</P>
<P>
The Walk of Fame is the biggest, longest-running promotional gambit in town. To 
the chagrin of many entertainment purists, publicists and even some of the 
stars themselves, the 30-year-old walkway is used time and time again to hawk 
films, albums, radio shows and concert tours -- whether or not the star is 
destined for lasting glory. 
</P>
<P>
To be enshrined on the walk, a celebrity first must be nominated, and by 
someone willing to pay the $3,500 cost of installing the star. If living, the 
honoree also must agree to attend the unveiling ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Where the Costs Fall 
</P>
<P>
Typically, the cost has fallen to film studios, record companies, radio and 
television promotional departments and independent publicists, who view the 
walk like any other paid advertising tool. Out of this less than pure process 
has come a sidewalk honor roll of greats, near-greats and who-was-thats, names 
that fit the moment, whether it be Ray Charles or George Putnam, Natalie Wood 
or Pee-wee Herman, Rod Serling or Jay Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
Film premieres have been promoted with stars for John Lennon ("Imagine"), 
Sylvester Stallone and Dolly Parton ("Rhinestone"), Tom Cruise ("The Color of 
Money") and Jerry Lee Lewis ("Great Balls of Fire"). 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, luminaries such as Jane Fonda, Sidney Poitier, Warren Beatty, 
Sigourney Weaver and Peter O'Toole, just to mention a few, do not have stars. 
</P>
<P>
"You walk down the street and look at those things and you think, 'God, how did 
this person get there?' " said Bob Garcia, director of artists relations for 
Hollywood-based A&amp;M Records, whose founder, Herb Alpert, has a star. "Those 
(Walk of Fame) stars used to represent greatness, but at a certain time that 
greatness began to disappear." 
</P>
<P>
Critics say the inequities have kept the Walk of Fame from becoming a true 
monument to the immortals. One studio, Columbia Pictures, ignores the walk 
entirely, a studio official said. The studio has not made a nomination in five 
years, the official said, despite the release of films such as "Ghostbusters" 
and "Ghostbusters II" (with Bill Murray and Dan Ayckroyd), "Tootsie" (with 
Dustin Hoffman and Jessica Lange) and "Stir Crazy" (with Richard Pryor and Gene 
Wilder). 
</P>
<P>
"Most of it is pure manipulation and product selling," the official, who asked 
not to be quoted by name, said of the walk. "It's an utterly commercial 
venture." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Walk of Fame is not about to be confused with the Lincoln Memorial 
as a hallowed monument, it nonetheless is seen as a vital component of 
Hollywood's ambitious restoration plans. Officials see it as one of the city's 
strongest tourist magnets, and they finally are seeking to treat -- and promote 
-- the Walk of Fame like a star in its own right. 
</P>
<P>
Last year alone, new marketing efforts involving the sale of Walk of Fame 
books, coffee mugs and T-shirts helped to generate nearly $100,000 for the 
Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, a figure that could double as additional 
promotions get under way. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lottery Game 
</P>
<P>
One company now under license with the chamber is developing a Walk of Fame 
lottery game, aimed at gamblers in the East, and last year an agreement was 
reached with Universal Studios to duplicate 60 of the walk's 1,992 stars at a 
new theme park in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue from the various ventures will help spruce up the 2.8-mile walk -- 
which runs along Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street -- and pay for other 
restoration programs in the core of the movie capital, chamber officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The reigning duke of the Walk of Fame is Johnny Grant, 66, a former television 
game show host. For the last decade or so, Grant has served as master of 
ceremonies at the star unveilings and chairs the secret, five-member selection 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
An affable, thick-faced man who some people -- including himself -- call the 
unofficial "Mayor of Hollywood" -- Grant is a familiar figure at the star 
ceremonies, grinning behind his spectacles, cracking one-liners in his booming 
bass voice. In other words, a throwback, right off the walls of Musso and 
Franks Grill. 
</P>
<P>
Grant agrees with the critics that commercialism has cheapened the Walk of Fame 
process, but he called the promotional tie-ins a necessary evil. Often the 
period when a film opens is the only time a big-name celebrity is made 
available for public appearances, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Part of the Hype' 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather do without it," he said. "But we have to understand that in 
Hollywood, awards are just part of the hype. I am a child of hype. I am not 
sure there is any award in the world that is completely pure." 
</P>
<P>
Grant vigorously denied the longstanding rumor that a sidewalk star can be 
bought for the right occasion. The committee approves from 12 to 20 stars a 
year from a pool of 200 to 300 nominations. Most candidates, even if they have 
the financial backing, even if they have a movie or album in the offing, get 
turned away -- sometimes year after year. 
</P>
<P>
"I am sending a check back right now to somebody who wanted (to buy) a star for 
somebody," Grant said. "We send back a dozen checks every year. I've had 
friends come in here and do everything but cry, and I say, 'I don't have but 
one (committee) vote.' " 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Grant added, many of Hollywood's greatest stars are not even 
nominated, or they are unwilling to attend a ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure I could move a star for Paul Newman or Clint Eastwood very rapidly," 
Grant said. "(But) Paul Newman has no desire to have a star right now. Maybe 
someday he will have a (film) project of his own or some studio project and 
he'll say, 'Hey, this would be a good time to do it.' 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny, some stars don't want any part of it and others want it so much." 
</P>
<P>
Often the stars are most eagerly sought by performers on their way up, 
according to entertainment-industry insiders. Many view it as a way to leave a 
mark that will last longer than the fame of the moment, proof that, once 
anyway, they were somebody special. 
</P>
<P>
Publicists and relatives of candidates seeking the honor have gone so far as to 
lobby Mayor Tom Bradley and camp on Grant's front lawn. Grant recalled one 
rabid Elvis fan who appeared outside his home demanding a star -- not for 
Presley, who has one, but for his guitar. 
</P>
<P>
"It scared me," Grant said. 
</P>
<P>
The tenacity of the lobbyists has forced the chamber to keep the 
screening-committee membership a closely guarded secret. Grant is the only one 
who is publicly identified. The others are known only as top-ranking executives 
of major entertainment companies. Together they represent the five categories 
for which stars are awarded: motion pictures, radio, television, musical 
recording and live theater. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, the committee tries to award stars in each of the categories, 
weighing motion-picture nominees against other motion-picture nominees, and so 
on. Candidates are evaluated, in part, for their longevity and civic 
contributions. A few stars each year are awarded posthumously. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the secretive nature of the work -- the committee does not announce who is 
nominated or why some nominees are rejected -- has created an army of 
frustrated second-guessers. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really know how they think," complained publicist Gene Schwam. "We 
have yet to be able to convince the committee that Blake Edwards -- who has 
made 46 feature films -- deserves a star. Blake's done all the 'Pink Panther' 
movies, 'Days of Wine and Roses,' 'Breakfast at Tiffany's,' 'The Great Race.' 
He's eligible as a writer, director, producer. It seems silly." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards has become one of those figures -- and there are others -- whose name 
keeps coming up, Grant acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to call . . . every year and say, 'Your guy didn't make it,' " Grant 
said. "I think Blake Edwards should be on the Walk of Fame. Why he doesn't get 
the votes, I don't know. He must have stepped on some toes. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exasperated by Rejections 
</P>
<P>
Publicist Monique Moss has been exasperated by the repeated rejections of 
Valerie Harper, Suzanne Somers and Dr. Joyce Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Joyce Brothers is probably the foremost media psychologist in the 
country," Moss said. "She's had radio programs for almost 20 years. Valerie 
Harper has won four Emmys; she's synonymous with television. And she's been 
involved in the community. Her group, LIFE (Love Is Feeding Everyone), feeds 
about 35,000 people a week in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
After serving for several years as a chamber employee who helped to coordinate 
Walk of Fame ceremonies, Moss has come to see the landmark from the other side 
and, she said, "it angers me." 
</P>
<P>
The selection secrecy obscures some active backstage politicking. Now and then, 
often away from the limelight, one star steps forward to help another. 
Sylvester Stallone, who has a star, successfully petitioned the committee on 
behalf of Richard Crenna. Bob Hope made a call to promote actor and singer Jack 
Jones. Disc jockey Gary Owens was given a star, then helped lead the crusade 
for the Three Stooges. Disc jockey Rick Dees, another star holder, campaigned 
for Clayton Moore, the Lone Ranger. 
</P>
<P>
Rock singer Billy Vera gives much of the credit for his star -- one of the most 
controversial awarded last year -- to Angie Dickinson. After 25 years in the 
recording industry, Vera's biggest claim to fame was a single, "At This 
Moment," that reached No. 1 for two weeks in early 1987. 
</P>
<P>
But Dickinson caught his club act and became a fan, and she nominated him for a 
star on the walk. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Why Me? 
</P>
<P>
"It was a total surprise," Vera recalled. "I thought, 'My God, there are so 
many people who are famous worldwide . . . why me?' " 
</P>
<P>
Homegrown personalities have a leg up in the process. Stars have gone to local 
TV newsmen such as George Putnam, Bill Stout, Stan Chambers and Jerry Dunphy. 
Bill Welsh, chamber president and a longtime television commentator for the 
Rose Parade, has a star. So does Grant, who played host to one of television's 
first game shows in New York before becoming a TV news interviewer in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
And so do a dialful of Los Angeles radio personalities: Dees, Owens, Al Lohman 
and Roger Barkley, Ken Minyard and Bob Arthur, Chick Hearn, Dick Whittinghill. 
Charlie Tuna, the announcer, not the fish, was voted a radio star this year, 
along with the Rev. Billy Graham. 
</P>
<P>
Dees' star in 1984 -- the year he released a comedy album called "Hurt Me Baby, 
Make Me Write Bad Checks" -- was the brainchild of Wally Clark, then-general 
manager of station KIIS-FM, now a partner in Dees' weekly national "Top 40" 
radio show. Clark persuaded the committee to overlook Dees' age -- he was 
barely 30 -- and his scant three years of air time in Los Angeles, scarcely a 
tick on the clock as some measure longevity. 
</P>
<P>
The star drew attacks from columnists and industry insiders, but it became a 
boon to KIIS-FM and nettled the station's FM rivals. One competitor, Power 106 
(KPWR-FM), responded by mounting a campaign and putting up $3,500 for its own 
disc jockey, Jay Thomas, whose experience was perhaps more questionable than 
Dees'. 
</P>
<P>
sh Got His Star 
</P>
<P>
Thomas got a star last month. For a week ahead of time, the station ballyhooed 
it on the air. 
</P>
<P>
"We spent the entire morning show talking about it the day of the event," said 
station general manager Phil Newmark. "We promoted it heavily. Radio is 
surveyed 48 of the 52 weeks out of the year. . . . The key thing in radio is, 
you have to be in front of the public constantly." 
</P>
<P>
The walk's first eight stars were created in 1958, all for motion picture 
performers: Joanne Woodward, Burt Lancaster, Ronald Colman, Olive Borden, 
Edward Sedgwick, Ernst Torrence, Preston Foster and Louise Fazenda. Then, in 
1960, the chamber began a mass installation, laying down 2,500 blank stars and 
filling them with more than 1,500 names. New names have been added every year 
since. 
</P>
<P>
Author Marianne Morino, who compiled a 380-page guidebook on the walk, said 
some early radio and opera performers have receded entirely into oblivion, 
despite their stars. Libraries and archives now contain almost nothing of past 
performers such as Jessica Dragonette, a Calcutta-born soprano who sang in the 
1930s show "Palmolive Beauty Box Theater," and Parkyakarkus (pronounced "park 
your carcass"), a comic who appeared on "The Eddie Cantor Show" of the same 
era. 
</P>
<P>
Mistakes occur here and there. Sarah Vaughan accidentally was given two stars 
for recording, and comedian Harold Lloyd two for acting. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's charming," author Morino said. "It adds a certain human touch." 
</P>
<P>
Controversies have marked the walk down through the years. Charlie Chaplin, 
ostracized for his left-wing politics, was denied a star when the walk first 
was built; he was honored only after a stormy controversy -- some companies 
threatened to quit the chamber in support of him -- in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Singer Paul Robeson, who performed "Ol' Man River" in the musical "Showboat," 
also was rejected after he was accused of being a Communist. When it happened, 
in the mid-1970s, an American Legion representative presented a tall and 
elegant scroll to the chamber, commending the action. 
</P>
<P>
But hours later, the chamber committee buckled to pressures and awarded a star 
to Robeson anyway, recalled former executive director Mike Sims. 
</P>
<P>
"The next day (the American Legion representative) showed up with another 
2-foot-high scroll," Sims remembered. "(It had) the same wording, but instead 
of 'commending' us it was 'condemning' us." 
</P>
<P>
Stars lobby for prestigious positions on the walk. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want to be in front of a discount electronics store or the Pussycat 
Theatre if you can avoid it," one studio publicist said. 
</P>
<P>
The top choice, the Park Place of walk real estate, is outside Mann's Chinese 
Theatre, site of stars for Greta Garbo, Elton John, Glenn Miller, Zsa Zsa 
Gabor, John Travolta and, yes, Johnny Grant. 
</P>
<P>
But only one spot near the theater is left . . . for someone. 
</P>
<P>
"They're holding onto it," Grant said. "People call me up and say, 'I know Ted 
Mann (of the theater chain). We'll put this in front of the Chinese Theatre.' I 
say good luck. Then they call me back and say, 'What's the next-best spot?' " 
</P>
<P>
John Lennon's star went outside the Capitol Records building. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Robeson's went outside the Pussycat Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Singer Tom Jones -- like Dyan Cannon and Fleetwood Mac before him -- chose a 
place near the famous lingerie outlet, Frederick's of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Eden picked a location near an ice-cream store -- because, the star of 
"I Dream of Jeannie" said, she loves ice cream. When her limousine broke down 
on the way to the unveiling, celebrity guests found the site useful. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob Hope had several ice creams while he waited," Eden recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Reactions to the honor vary widely, and always have. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Connors, TV's tough-guy "Rifleman," cried. Bill Cosby chewed up a wad of 
gum and stuck it down on his own star -- to be the first. Actor Forrest Tucker, 
stricken with cancer, tried to attend the ceremony but fell ill and was rushed 
to a hospital. He died soon afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Allotted one of the cherished locations at the Chinese Theatre, Barbra 
Streisand failed to show up, apparently in fear of the crowds. This was a 
first, and the Walk of Fame crowd grew ugly. There was some sentiment to tear 
up her star. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a huge crowd . . . several thousand people," former chamber executive 
Sims remembered. "We kept waiting and waiting, a good hour and a half. When she 
didn't show . . . one television reporter walked down to the Hollywood Wax 
Museum . . . and borrowed a wax figure of Streisand. He put a mike in its hand 
and interviewed the wax figure: 'Where are you? Why aren't you here?' It was a 
great piece." 
</P>
<P>
The tradition of awarding stars in different categories has given a few 
celebrities multiple honors. Bob Hope, for example, has three stars -- and is 
approved for a fourth. The only performer with five stars is Gene Autry, a 
longtime benefactor of the chamber who owns KTLA television, where, yes, Johnny 
Grant is employed.

JARUZELSKI WON'T SEEK PRESIDENCY; 
</P>
<P>
POLISH LEADER CITES UNPOPULARITY, BACKS INTERIOR MINISTER

<P>
Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski threw the national political situation 
into deeper turmoil Friday by announcing to the Communist Party's Central 
Committee that he will not run for the new office of president. 
</P>
<P>
Declaring that he would not be an "obstacle to reconciliation," Jaruzelski 
endorsed instead Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak for the post, which 
will be filled by a vote of the newly elected National Assembly, expected to 
meet next week. 
</P>
<P>
The new uncertainty about Poland's leadership came little more than a week 
before President Bush is scheduled to start a three-day visit July 9. 
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee, along with Communist Party deputies in Parliament, 
immediately asked Jaruzelski to reconsider his decision. But it adjourned its 
lengthy meeting without deciding on an endorsement for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Linked to Martial Law 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski's statement to party leaders, who have been thrown into an 
unprecedented crisis by the Communists' feeble showing in last month's free 
elections, took note of the widely held public view that he is the one who 
should be held accountable for the imposition of martial law in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"I know well that public opinion associates me more often with martial law and 
less often with the line of reforms -- with those so significant decisions of 
the 10th plenum," he said, referring to the meeting at which various factions 
of the party fought over what ultimately was a decision to re-legalize the 
Solidarity trade union. "I must take into consideration social reality. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"When there is an obstacle to reconciliation, to uniting social forces, there 
is only one possible solution -- even if that obstacle is Wojciech Jaruzelski." 
</P>
<P>
There was no indication from Jaruzelski whether his decision not to run for 
head of government would affect his position as party chief. 
</P>
<P>
As the party leader spoke, about 300 demonstrators opposing his choice as 
presidential candidate were battling police, using water cannon and tear gas 
just yards from the Central Committee headquarters. There were also 
anti-Jaruzelski protests in Katowice in southwestern Poland and Kielce in the 
south. 
</P>
<P>
As head of the country's extensive police and security apparatus, Kiszczak is 
also associated with the martial-law era. However, in his case the stigma seems 
to have been erased effectively as he led the government delegation to the 
so-called "round-table" negotiations with Solidarity starting last August. 
</P>
<P>
Those talks produced the deal whereby Solidarity was once again legalized after 
seven years; a new political system, including the office of president, was set 
up; and the first free elections at which voters dealt the Communist Party a 
firm humiliation. 
</P>
<P>
Endorsing Kiszczak, Jaruzelski called him "a soldier, a politician, a patriot 
and a man who has been close to me for many years. . . . In the eyes of 
society, including opposition circles, he is rightly considered a leading 
representative of the line of reconciliation." 
</P>
<P>
Although the elections last month saw Solidarity win 99 of 100 seats in the new 
Senate and all of the 161 seats it was eligible to contest in the Sejm, the 
lower house of Parliament, the Communist-led coalition maintains a slim 
majority in both houses, and is thus able to elect its own candidate for the 
office of president. 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski's declaration, however, could throw the process of reform here into 
even more conflict. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Support From Solidarity 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the "round-table" talks, it was generally agreed by Solidarity 
activists that Jaruzelski, the undoubted architect of the negotiations, should 
hold the newly created office of president. 
</P>
<P>
The elections, however, amounted to a cold shower for the Communist authorities 
and, somewhat surprisingly, for Solidarity, which had given at least tacit 
support to Communist liberals who had helped design the agreement between 
Solidarity and the government. But where they had a choice or the opportunity 
to cross out an unopposed Communist Party candidate's name, the voters 
expressed their disapproval of the regime. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity's senators and Sejm members are scheduled to meet today to decide on 
a policy in the apparent Central Committee impasse, and activists said that 
Kiszczak is an acceptable party candidate. 
</P>
<P>
However, the party's reluctance to immediately accept Jaruzelski's withdrawal 
-- and his endorsement of Kiszczak -- suggested the possibility of a hard-line 
backlash that could threaten the Solidarity-backed power-sharing arrangement, 
which for the last year has depended on having the liberal wing of the 
Communist Party as a negotiating partner. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is of major significance not only in Poland but in Eastern Europe, 
where Communist regimes have been given a fearful lesson in electoral politics, 
suggesting that even so-called "liberals" in the Communist Party have little 
hope of winning approval in free elections. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Impact on Bush Visit 
</P>
<P>
Party spokesman Jan Bisztyiga said at a news conference that the Central 
Committee, and Jaruzelski, would make a final decision over the weekend after 
consulting the Communist-allied Democratic and Peasant parties. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, commenting on the situation 
aboard Air Force One while en route with Bush to Maine, told reporters, "All we 
can say at this point is that we don't expect that to disrupt the President's 
trip." He said that Bush "will be happy to meet with whoever the new leadership 
is."

BUSH MARKS ANNIVERSARY OF CIVIL RIGHTS ACT, URGES EXPANDED FIGHT AGAINST BIAS 
</P>

President Bush, declaring "the full promise of the civil rights movement has 
still not been achieved," called Friday for an expansion of the civil rights 
mission in the United States to encompass the fight against discrimination 
based not just on race, but on gender, age and physical disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
During the day, the President also offered support to a number of other causes. 
</P>
<P>
He met with Albertina Sisulu, wife of an imprisoned black South African leader 
and co-president of the United Democratic Front of South Africa, who said later 
that Bush told her he hoped his Administration would become a catalyst "for 
bringing about a peaceful change in South Africa." However, she reported, the 
President balked at her call for "comprehensive, mandatory sanctions" seeking 
to bring about an end to South Africa's racial separation policy, apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
And, journeying across the Potomac to the flag-bedecked Iwo Jima Memorial in 
Arlington, Va., Bush gave his backing to a proposed 20-word constitutional 
amendment that would prohibit the desecration of the American flag. 
</P>
<P>
With an audience of civil rights leaders including the Rev. Jesse Jackson 
looking on in the White House East Room, Bush marked the 25th anniversary of 
the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act, which President Lyndon B. Johnson signed 
into law on July 2, 1964. The act banned segregation in public accommodations 
and was followed by laws protecting voting rights and banning discrimination in 
housing and employment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Economic Barriers 
</P>
<P>
"The law cannot tolerate any discrimination and my Administration will not 
tolerate abuse of that principle," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
"The hard lesson of the passing years is that it has not been enough to wage a 
war against the old forms of bigotry and inequality," he said. "The lives of 
the disadvantaged in this country are affected by economic barriers at least as 
much as by the remnants of legal discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
While "much progress" has been achieved since the Civil Rights Act was passed, 
Bush said, it is time "to move forward on a broader front, to move forward into 
the century's final decade with a civil rights mission that fully embraces 
every deserving American, regardless of race, whether women, children or the 
aged; whether the disabled, the unemployed or the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
The President's 200 guests included civil rights leaders Martin Luther King 
III, Benjamin L. Hooks, Vernon Jordan, James Farmer and Rosa Parks, whose 
refusal to move to the back of a Montgomery, Ala., bus on Dec. 1, 1955, became 
a landmark in the civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony, Jackson complained that as a result of recent Supreme Court 
decisions restricting affirmative action programs and making it more difficult 
for plaintiffs to prove workplace discrimination, "we need a meeting of some 
substance with the President to deal with legislative remedies to offset" the 
impact of the court decisions. 
</P>
<P>
At the flag ceremony, Bush again showed his dismay with a Supreme Court 
decision that overturned laws in 48 states that made it illegal to burn the 
American flag. In a 5-4 decision last week, the court ruled that such statutes 
violated the First Amendment's protection of free speech. 
</P>
<P>
Using as a backdrop the bronze sculpture of the raising of the American flag on 
Mt. Suribachi during the victorious World War II battle for the Pacific island 
of Iwo Jima, Bush said: 
</P>
<P>
"For those who've championed the cause of civil rights here at home, to those 
who fought for democracy abroad, free speech is a right that is dear and close 
to all. It is in defense of that right and the others enshrined in our 
Constitution that so many have sacrificed."

Argentine President Raul Alfonsin and Vice President Victor Martinez on Friday 
submitted early letters of resignation to Parliament, government officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Alfonsin's resignation, which he announced June 13, will be formally accepted 
July 8, the day President-elect Carlos Saul Menem is due to take power. 
</P>
<P>
"They have my resignation and the resignation of the president," Martinez said. 
"The envelopes will be opened on July 7 for consideration by Congress." 
</P>
<P>
The early resignations will allow Menem to take office five months ahead of 
schedule in order to quickly tackle the country's severe economic problems. 
Argentina is suffering from hyperinflation, with the cost of living rising 
faster than 100% a month. 
</P>
<P>
Menem is expected to institute severe budgetary steps and other measures in an 
attempt to control the inflationary spiral.

The United States and Taiwan initialed a tentative North Pacific drift-net 
agreement Friday just hours after the Taiwanese were given 60 days to sign and 
implement such a pact or face possible American trade sanctions on their 
fishery products. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement allows for the "high seas boarding" of Taiwanese drift-net 
vessels suspected of illegally catching U.S. salmon and requires the placement 
of satellite transponders on all of the 166 Taiwanese ships involved. 
</P>
<P>
The United States will use the transponders to keep track of the Taiwanese 
fleet, and U.S. observers will be allowed to board Taiwanese vessels to monitor 
their catch. 
</P>
<P>
Under a 1987 law, Thursday was the deadline for reaching such monitoring and 
enforcement agreements. A 60-day time clock started running; if agreements are 
still not in force by the end of that period, the Bush Administration could 
impose an embargo or other trade sanctions on Taiwanese fishery products.

ADMINISTRATION DEFENDS ITS DIALOGUE WITH PLO 
</P>

<P>
The Bush Administration, brushing aside a storm of criticism from Israel and 
its American supporters, on Friday defended its decision to talk to the deputy 
chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization and vowed to continue the 
six-month-old U.S.-PLO dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Robert H. Pelletreau Jr., 
the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia, has held unannounced meetings recently with a 
number of PLO officials in addition to Yasser Arafat's deputy, Salah Khalaf. 
The department Thursday confirmed the talks with Khalaf after the PLO official 
told a Kuwaiti newspaper about them. 
</P>
<P>
"In addition to Mr. Khalaf . . . , there were other people that Ambassador 
Pelletreau has been meeting with over the last several weeks," Tutwiler said. 
She refused to reveal other names, but she said there has been no meeting with 
Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not an Upgrading 
</P>
<P>
Although Tutwiler said the contacts should not be considered an upgrading of 
the U.S.-PLO dialogue, she said they began after Pelletreau was recalled to 
Washington in April for strategy sessions with Secretary of State James A. 
Baker III and other officials. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler said Washington's objective in the recent contacts with the PLO has 
been to persuade the organization to end its opposition to Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's proposal for Palestinian elections in the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip to select representatives who would negotiate with Israel over 
limited Palestinian self-rule in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials believe that without at least the tacit approval of the PLO, the 
elections can never take place because few Palestinians would defy the 
organization to run or vote. U.S. officials believe it will take months to 
bring about the elections. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials, however, see the election plan as a way to split West Bank 
and Gaza Palestinians from their allegiance to the PLO. Shamir has made it 
clear that he will not deal with the PLO, even to advance his own election 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
Israel and its supporters were especially critical of Pelletreau's decision to 
meet Khalaf, also known as Abu Iyad. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Embassy in Washington issued a statement saying Khalaf "has been a 
proponent of the PLO's adherence to its national charter and has pledged its 
unwavering support for the use of violence in the armed struggle against 
Israel." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Dine, chairman of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, said 
Khalaf "has publicly boasted of his terrorist deeds against Americans and 
Israelis and bragged about his ability to deceive the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Connie Mack (R-Fla.) demanded in a letter Thursday that the Administration 
end its dialogue with the PLO. Tutwiler said Baker has read Mack's letter and 
the answer was "a polite no." 
</P>
<P>
Wire services reported these other developments: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The PLO formally asked the United States to restrain Israeli occupation 
forces in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the organization's news agency WAFA 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The PLO made the request in a memorandum delivered to Pelletreau by Hakam 
Balawi, the PLO representative in Tunis. 
</P>
<P>
WAFA said the memorandum asked the Bush Administration "to take effective 
measures with regard to Israel's terrorist acts in the occupied territories and 
to oppose (these acts)." 
</P>
<P>
 -- A Syrian-based PLO faction, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine, said that it had suspended talks on handing over the remains of an 
Israeli soldier in retaliation for Israel's deportation of eight Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army said the eight Palestinians dropped off in southern Lebanon on 
Thursday were leaders of the uprising and members of Fatah, the largest PLO 
faction, or the Democratic Front. 
</P>
<P>
The soldier, a Druze in the Israeli ground forces, was captured in April, 1983, 
during Israel's invasion of Lebanon. The Democratic Front says he was killed in 
an Israeli air strike. 
</P>
<P>
The front also accused Israel of deliberately killing a Palestinian identified 
as the kidnaper of a U.S. relief worker abducted last week in the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Abu Nasr had been identified as leader of a three-man group that 
abducted Chris George, a 35-year-old co-director of the Jerusalem office of the 
Save the Children Federation. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Front said Nasr did not belong to their faction.

TERRORISTS MAY HAVE USED EAST GERMAN LOAN

Terrorists linked to a bombing that killed a U.S. Marine got part of a 
$600-million loan made to East Germany with the help of an American bank, 
according to a former National Security Council staff member. 
</P>
<P>
Norman A. Bailey, senior director of national security planning from 1981 to 
1983, made his allegations during Thursday's taping of "Follow the Money," a 
Public Broadcasting System program to be broadcast July 12. 
</P>
<P>
He said the money from the 1985 loan was dispersed to front companies and tax 
havens around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"It was then concentrated again in Libya and was sent from Libya to various 
accounts, which were controlled by terrorist organizations, and was then used 
by those terrorist organizations in their activities," Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
The official Libyan news agency, JANA, denied the story. 
</P>
<P>
"Such claims are the latest inventions of the machine of misinformation and 
lies," JANA said. 
</P>
<P>
The bombing that killed the Marine occurred on April 5, 1986, in a West Berlin 
discotheque. It also killed a Turkish woman and wounded 204 other people. Nine 
days later, the United States, blaming the Tripoli regime, sent planes to bomb 
Libya. 
</P>
<P>
The loan, Bailey said, was traced through the National Security Agency, a 
super-secret group at Ft. Meade, Md., that listens in on international 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refuses Direct Comment 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. William E. Odom, who directed that agency from 1985 to 1988, said on 
the PBS program that he could not comment directly. 
</P>
<P>
"I will say that such flows would not be abnormal for the East Bloc's way of 
supporting Third World activities," Odom said. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Roman Papadiuk said he had no information to substantiate 
Bailey's statement, and the State Department said it had "no knowledge" of such 
a loan. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Lindeman, a spokesman for the First National Bank of Chicago, said a 
$600-million loan to East Germany was organized in 1985 with the International 
Bank of Japan. About 50 banks from various nations were involved, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Delp, the Chicago bank's senior vice president in charge of international 
banking, said he would be very surprised if the money went to Libya. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be very foolish on the part of the East Germans," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Helmut Krausser, a representative of the bank that received the money, East 
Germany's Aussenhandelsbank (Foreign Trade Bank), said on the PBS program that 
he doubts that Libya received that kind of support.

STUDENT FLIES TO N. KOREA TO ATTEND EVENT;

S. KOREA DISSIDENT DEFIES FESTIVAL BAN

<P>
In an act of political defiance that could have major repercussions on the 
divided Korean Peninsula, a young Korean woman from Seoul flew into Pyongyang 
on Friday to attend a sports and cultural festival as a representative of 
radical students in the south. 
</P>
<P>
Im Suk Yong, 20, who identified herself as a fourth-year student majoring in 
French at the Hankook Foreign Languages University in Seoul, was given a 
tumultuous, red-carpet welcome at Pyongyang Airport, with music from a student 
band and hundreds of organized greeters. 
</P>
<P>
Im was embraced as if she were a long-lost relative by a few young women, then 
surrounded by a shoving group of young male students and dozens of 
photographers from the international press corps. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd made up of Im, two or three bodyguards, the shoving students who were 
part of the welcome and the struggling photographers made its way along a red 
carpet past a cheering crowd and a portrait of North Korean President Kim Il 
Sung. 
</P>
<P>
"Reunification of the fatherland!" shouted the crowd, which included many women 
in traditional flowing Korean robes of pink or light blue. "Welcome!" 
</P>
<P>
Im, whose 10-day journey from Seoul took her through Tokyo, West Germany, East 
Berlin and a Moscow airport, then stood on steps at the edge of the tarmac and 
gave a brief press conference. 
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of the million students of South Korea who are fighting against the 
government, I have come to Pyongyang to take part in the Pyongyang festival," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
"When I left Seoul, I thought (how) one could come here in a car so easily -- 
it would only take four hours from Seoul to Pyongyang," Im said. "But it took 
me 10 days to get here, through other countries." 
</P>
<P>
Today is the opening day of the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students, a 
sort of leftist quasi-Olympics and cultural event, in Pyongyang. This festival 
was first held in Prague in 1947 and most recently in Moscow in 1985. About 
12,000 athletes and other delegates or visitors have arrived and more are 
expected, according to guides working for the event. The theme of the festival 
is "anti-imperialist solidarity, peace and friendship." 
</P>
<P>
For Pyongyang, this "anti-imperialist" theme means a demand for the withdrawal 
of American forces from South Korea, where they have been stationed since the 
1950-53 Korean War. The Pyongyang government and many South Korean student 
radicals believe that the U.S. presence in South Korea is a force blocking 
progress toward peaceful reunification. 
</P>
<P>
American and South Korean supporters of the U.S. troop presence argue that it 
is necessary to ensure stability on the peninsula and deter any possible attack 
on the south by the north. 
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government, concerned that the festival would be used for 
propaganda, has banned participation by South Koreans. In addition, all visits 
to North Korea by South Korean citizens are illegal without the Seoul 
government's advance approval. 
</P>
<P>
The largest dissident student organization in South Korea, the National Council 
of Student Representatives, usually known by the Korean name Chondaehyop, had 
been determined to send delegates to the festival. The chairman of Chondaehyop, 
Im Jong Chul, who apparently is no relative of the woman who arrived in 
Pyongyang on Friday, participated in a June 24 telephone dialogue from Seoul 
with North Korean student and youth representatives in Prague. 
</P>
<P>
Im Jong Chul, who was already in hiding but allowed South Korean television to 
report on the call -- was immediately accused of national security violations, 
and a warrant was issued for his arrest. He has not yet been apprehended. 
</P>
<P>
Im Suk Yong declared that she had come as the organization's only 
representative. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very sorry to be taking part in the Pyongyang festival alone, without 
lots of my friends, because the South Korean authorities blocked the South 
Korean students from taking part in the festival," she said. "This shows that 
the South Korean government is anti-reunification. Nowadays, the forces which 
want reunification are being suppressed." 
</P>
<P>
Accompanying Im upon her arrival were several other Koreans, apparently 
including two or three originally from South Korea who now live in West 
Germany. The presence of these people was not considered politically 
significant, however. It appeared that Im would indeed be the only activist 
South Korean citizen to attend the festival. 
</P>
<P>
In making an unauthorized visit to the north, Im is following in the footsteps 
of a dissident South Korean clergyman, the Rev. Moon Ik Hwan, and opposition 
assemblyman Suh Kyung Won. 
</P>
<P>
Moon made an unauthorized nine-day visit to Pyongyang in April, with the 
announced intention of promoting reunification. He has been imprisoned since 
his mid-April return to South Korea and is now standing trial. 
</P>
<P>
Suh, a member of the Party for Peace and Democracy led by Kim Dae Jung, made an 
unauthorized trip to Pyongyang last August. He was taken into custody early 
Wednesday and charged with violating the National Security Law, which bans 
unauthorized trips to North Korea and communicating and meeting with North 
Koreans without government approval. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said they are trying to find out if Suh was spying for North 
Korea. He met President Kim Il Sung and other Pyongyang officials during the 
visit, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Any similar treatment of Im could fuel the radicalism of leftist students in 
the south. But South Korean intelligence authorities said she will be arrested 
and charged with national security violations if she returns home. The South 
Korean prosecutor general's office ordered an investigation into the funding 
and arrangements for her trip. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Seoul, thousands of riot police firing tear gas stormed the 
campus of Hanyang University to thwart a planned march by radical students to 
protest the ban on participating in the North Korean festival. Some students 
fought back with steel bars, clubs, rocks and firebombs, and at least 80 
students and police officers were injured, police officials said. By nightfall, 
hundreds of students were barricaded in four buildings ringed by police. The 
campus was littered with rocks, clubs, tree limbs, broken chairs and lumber. 
</P>
<P>
More than 500 students were arrested on the campus, and another 50 to 60 were 
arrested after trying to pass checkpoints leading to the demilitarized zone 
that divides the peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Friday evening, several North Korean student and youth officials held a press 
conference at which they criticized the Seoul government for refusing to allow 
student dissidents to visit the north. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Mun Hyon, an official of the League of Socialist Working Youth of Korea, 
who participated in the June 24 telephone dialogue with Im Jong Chul, assailed 
Seoul for its stance on reunification and South Korean student activism. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that we succeeded in having dialogue with the South Korean student is 
denounced by the South Korean authorities as a crime," Kim declared. "All this 
means is (that) the South Korean regime is a fascist regime and is against the 
reunification of the country." 
</P>
<P>
Pok Chun Sim, a 43-year-old store salesclerk who was part of the welcoming 
group for Im at Pyongyang Airport, said that she was "deeply moved" to be able 
to join in greeting Im. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I feel that Korea is one," she said. "Nobody can divide our nation in 
two."

Former Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos remained semi-comatose and on a 
dialysis machine Friday after removal of a malfunctioning transplanted kidney, 
a hospital official said. 
</P>
<P>
"The condition has not worsened since yesterday (Thursday). He remains 
semi-comatose, but is responding to pain, but not command," Eugene Tiwanak, St. 
Francis Medical Center assistant administrator, said. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors Thursday removed the kidney -- which Marcos received in a transplant in 
1984 -- because his body had begun rejecting the organ. They hoped the 
operation would clear the massive infection that has gripped the ailing, exiled 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos' temperature was down to about 100 degrees, which Tiwanak called a 
favorable sign. It had been as high as 104 degrees before the operation. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos, 71, will have to undergo dialysis daily, said Tiwanak. Marcos remains 
on a respirator in the hospital's intensive care unit.

SANDS OF TIME TURN UNKIND IN TINY BARBUDA

CODRINGTON, Barbuda 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This languid tropical island with its miles of powder-white beaches and rare 
wildlife is verging on devastation from, among other things, the wholesale 
removal of its fine-grained sand, which is being shipped away by the barge-load 
for construction projects elsewhere in the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Barbuda doesn't disappear grain by grain over the horizon, it may be 
paved over by resort hotel developers or overrun by diseased lions and llamas, 
according to protesting leaders of the island's tiny but vocal population. The 
people are demanding veto power over the pell-mell development. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of political domination by outsiders and growing encroachment on 
their land -- such as the island's newest unwanted development as a quarantine 
base for zoo-bound wild animals -- Barbuda has become the only freed former 
slave colony on Earth that wants to scrap independence and return to British 
colonial rule. 
</P>
<P>
"We're fighting for our survival," said Hilbourne Frank, a soft-spoken, 
57-year-old former schoolteacher who represents Barbuda in the Parliament of 
Antigua and Barbuda. The Parliament governs a national union of two neighboring 
islands forced upon the reluctant Barbudans when Antigua was granted 
independence from Britain eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
At times, the fight for survival has been fierce. 
</P>
<P>
On the Thursday before Easter, most of Barbuda's roughly 1,500 people rallied 
like a small, unarmed army on the island's only wharf to prevent the American 
manager of the new quarantine center from landing a shipload of Chilean llamas. 
The quarantine enterprise hopes to profit from keeping the animals -- and other 
zoo-bound creatures -- on isolated Barbuda long enough to certify them as 
disease-free before shipping them on to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Defying a special contingent of Antiguan police, the Barbudans camped out on 
the wharf until daybreak of Good Friday, when, to triumphant jeers and cheers, 
the frustrated ship captain retreated with his unwelcome cargo still aboard. 
</P>
<P>
Days later, the 268 llamas were put ashore on a tiny, almost barren, 
uninhabited island off the east coast of Antigua. 
</P>
<P>
"America has 3 million square miles of land, and it doesn't let in sick lions 
and llamas," complained Freeston Thomas, 38, a local builder and former member 
of the once-autonomous but now-powerless Barbuda Council. "We have only 62 
square miles. Do you think we need those animals here?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Worse Than South Africa' 
</P>
<P>
"What they're doing to us is an outrage, worse than South Africa," the island's 
74-year-old resident philosopher, McChesney George, said, leaning across the 
counter of his general store. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a child no one interfered with us," he continued. "Antiguans had to 
have special permits to come here, and no Antiguan government could make laws 
affecting Barbuda. We didn't need a union with Antigua. We were already free. 
But since independence, everything Antigua has done has taken our rights away 
from us." 
</P>
<P>
Barbuda's deep-seated hostility toward Antigua, a fast-growing tourist country 
where the English-style Parliament and government are dominated by the rich, 
development-minded family of Prime Minister Vere C. Bird, dates back three 
centuries to the days of slavery. Relatively fertile Antigua was then a British 
colony. Scrubby, arid Barbuda, 26 miles to the north, was a private estate, 
leased from the Crown by an Antiguan English family named Codrington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Different Paths 
</P>
<P>
Because of the sharp physical differences between the islands, the slaves on 
Antigua and Barbuda took different paths of development from the start. 
Antiguans became field workers on the 108-square-mile island's fertile 
plantations. Barbudans became fishermen, woodworkers, weavers and boat-builders 
because their scrubby land could support only garden plots and grazing. 
</P>
<P>
According to historians, the Barbudans also developed a far greater degree of 
independence, asserting their right to roam the island at will and use freely 
what they still consider its communal land. In return, according to island 
story-tellers, the English leaseholders used Barbuda as a selective "breeding" 
colony for slaves. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, it was a stud farm breeding the tallest people in the world," said 
Thomas, who acknowledged he was speaking from island lore, not from documented 
history, which is cloudy on the question. "People here used to start at 6 feet 
2 and go up from there." 
</P>
<P>
As Britain's colonial empire began to break up after World War II, the first 
step toward decolonization cast the island as an Antiguan dependency with no 
direct rights of its own. The sturdy independence of the Barbudans flared into 
open revolt against Antigua. The Barbudans protested, demanding to be made a 
ward of the Crown. Britain refused. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, when Britain lumped Antigua and Barbuda together as a single, fully 
independent Commonwealth nation, the Barbudans sought to secede, either to make 
their own way as the tiniest micro-state in the Western Hemisphere or to 
snuggle back under the protective wing of Whitehall, which again refused. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the island's leaders even appealed for adoption by the United States or 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell the Americans to send us about 5,000 troops to help us out," resident 
philosopher George said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
"We are living in fear that the Antigua government at any moment will tread all 
over our rights," said Frank, whose election to Parliament this year broke the 
uninterrupted incumbency of wealthy, pro-Antigua businessman Eric Burton. "We'd 
rather secede in order to live in peace than have them walk all over us." 
</P>
<P>
Frank and the 11-member Barbuda Council, represented by a London lawyer, have 
sued the government to establish both their historic communal rights to the 
land and their rights to control the mining of Barbuda's especially fine 
construction sand, which is highly prized by builders as concrete mix. The 
lawsuits would also establish the council's right to veto unwanted land use 
such as the animal quarantine center and future resort projects. 
</P>
<P>
The sand mine -- actually an ever-widening open pit literally a stone's throw 
from a beach as flawless as Robinson Crusoe's -- is the council's main concern 
because it not only represents an ecological disaster in the making but is 
robbing the island of one of its few financial resources. 
</P>
<P>
"We are being ripped off on the sand," said an indignant Frank. "We're getting 
about $2,000 a barge-load, and the owners of the operation are selling it in 
Guadaloupe for $28,000 a barge-load. They get even more on some of the other 
islands." 
</P>
<P>
George complained: "We asked the (Antiguan) government to make them stop 
shipping our sand, but Prime Minister Bird intervened and let them keep 
shipping it." 
</P>
<P>
Bird's son, Deputy Prime Minister Lester Bird, was until recently one of the 
owners of the sand-mining company, along with two other Antiguan Cabinet 
ministers and an American manager, Dave Strickland, who also runs the so-far 
empty quarantine station. In a recent interview, the younger Bird, who also has 
been accused of planning to exploit Barbuda as a toxic dump, dismissed the 
Barbudans' complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole question comes from certain people at the top forming suspicions 
that the Antigua government wants to take away their lands," he said, ignoring 
the reality of Barbudan land literally leaving the island by the barge-load. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Other Incidents 
</P>
<P>
The Antiguan prime minister fueled Barbudan hostility at least twice previously 
when he boosted two other private attempts to take over major chunks of the 
island. One was by fugitive American financier Robert Vesco, who dropped the 
effort and fled Antigua when his scheme was publicized in 1982. The other, 
during the same time period but unrelated to Vesco, was an unsuccessful attempt 
by an international group called the Sovereign Order of New Aragon to set up on 
Barbuda with sovereign territorial status. 
</P>
<P>
Bird's involvement with the sand mine has been even more abrasive, according to 
the Barbudans. Aside from the loss of revenue, Frank said, the sand pit is an 
environmental threat because it is situated on top of the island's best 
freshwater aquifer. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been digging down to water level for five years," he said. "If they 
keep going that deep, the water will be polluted by a lower layer of saline 
water." 
</P>
<P>
The sand pit also has obliterated a wide area of scrubby vegetation favored by 
the island's wild pigs and deer, as well as a sisal farm that Frank said was 
one of Barbuda's chief economic resources. Sisal is used for rugs and a number 
of hand-woven products the islanders make. 
</P>
<P>
Not far away is a burgeoning beachfront hotel construction project called the 
K-Club, owned by Italian businessman Aldo Pinto and his dress-designer wife, 
Mariuccia (Krizia) Mandelli. When finished this fall, it will become one of the 
Caribbean's richest resorts, with daily rates for two persons scheduled to be 
as high as $1,500. The only other substantial hotel on the island is the 
remotely situated, 20-year-old Coco Point Lodge, a quiet luxury resort with its 
own airstrip almost adjoining the K-Club property. 
</P>
<P>
Although the sprawling new hotel's dozens of luxury villas have gone up without 
their explicit approval, most Barbudans accept the new Italian project as 
beneficial. Like Coco Point, the new hotel will provide some local employment, 
even though it will import outsiders for skilled jobs. But the Barbudans want 
the right to control future resort development and to prevent it altogether 
when construction threatens the island's delicate ecological balance or when 
imported workers threaten to outnumber natives. 
</P>
<P>
Their worst fears may already be close to nightmare proportions, said Frank, as 
the result of an ambitious proposal by a group of speculators including the 
Florida treasure hunter, Mel Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
According to a recent article in the New Yorker magazine, the Fisher group, 
apparently dealing through the Birds, has acquired a 99-year-lease on 654 acres 
north of Codrington. The magazine said the plans include a 400-unit condo-hotel 
and another "luxury hotel" that will include "a cosmetology center, a 
hyperbaric treatment center, a biomedical clinic and a longevity center," as 
well as a golf course, an underwater restaurant-observatory and excursions to 
salvageable shipwrecks on the Barbuda reefs. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the simple threats of bigness and environmental damage above and 
below the water, the Fisher development will almost surround a rare bird 
rookery. The sanctuary is a mangrove-surrounded lagoon where hundreds of giant 
frigate birds nest every winter, so gentle and unaccustomed to predators that 
bird lovers can approach within a few feet of them. Only the frigate bird 
rookery on the Galapagos Islands off Ecuador is as accessible. 
</P>
<P>
"Their only threat is too much development," said Karlin Koepcke, one of two 
young American women monitoring the nests of the 2,500 breeding frigate-bird 
couples under a grant from the National Geographic. "So far, they're still OK, 
but a hotel out there could ruin it." 
</P>
<P>
"Secession looks like our best way out," said Henry Hopkins, 69, who manages 
Codrington's small, macadam-strip airport and wants to see more development if 
it is carefully placed and controlled by Barbudans. "We need the development to 
lure back some of our young people who have moved away because there isn't 
enough for them to do here." 
</P>
<P>
About twice as many Barbudans live in New York as in Barbuda, Frank said.

<P>
But perhaps mindful that he is outnumbered by Antiguans 16 to 1 in the 17-seat 
Parliament, Frank's once-strident stand for secession has softened compared to 
that of Hopkins and other island elders. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be starting from scratch now (in Parliament) trying to find out what is 
the attitude of the Antigua government towards Barbuda," he said. "I'm not 
pressing to secede at this moment. I'm pressing to establish our political 
relationship to Antigua and to establish the fact that we have the right to 
secede if we want to." 
</P>
<P>
George, who said he does not believe Frank will win a clarification of Barbudan 
rights from the Antiguan Parliament, said with a sigh: 
</P>
<P>
"They take the sand and give us what they like. Barbuda doesn't belong to us 
now."

Several elder leaders of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on Friday urged 
Prime Minister Sosuke Uno to resign at an early date over his alleged 
involvement in a sex scandal, a Japanese news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
Kyodo News Service said three LDP leaders -- Takeo Fukuda, a former prime 
minister; Susumu Nikaido, a former party vice president, and Raizo Matsuno, a 
former Cabinet minister -- were motivated by the anticipation of a major 
setback for the ruling party in the July 23 election for the upper house of 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
The report, citing party sources, said those leaders share the view that the 
66-year-old Uno has suffered a serious loss of prestige because of his reported 
extramarital affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The three elder leaders also discussed a plan to choose an acting prime 
minister from among the present 20 Cabinet ministers, it said, suggesting 
Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama. 
</P>
<P>
The popular gossip magazine Focus published a long-awaited report Friday of an 
affair it said Uno had with an underage apprentice geisha. It also had a report 
that an Uno aide was found to belong to a prostitution club. 
</P>
<P>
Uno and his aides seemed to be trying to ignore the latest scandal Friday, 
declining to comment. 
</P>
<P>
According to an Uno aide quoted in the Focus article, Uno said: "For God's 
sake, there's no truth in it."

A fire touched off by a series of explosions sent choking smoke through a 
10-story office building Friday, killing at least four people and injuring 
dozens. Terrified workers smashed windows with chairs, and a woman jumped from 
the sixth floor. 
</P>
<P>
Many people escaped by climbing onto firefighters' ladders. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 people, many of them office workers with soot-blackened clothing and 
skin, gathered on the street outside the Peachtree 25th Building. Some sat 
down, breathing from oxygen masks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Electrical Problem 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the fire in the south tower of the black-glass building erupted 
about 10:30 a.m., about 30 minutes after a power failure. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze was preceded by a series of explosions on the sixth floor, witnesses 
said, which occurred when two electrical workers were repairing a blown fuse. 
Fire officials said one of the electrical workers was killed. They could not 
account for the source of the explosions. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze began on the sixth floor but spread two floors below and one above, 
said Sandra Walker, a spokeswoman for Mayor Andrew Young. 
</P>
<P>
"My understanding is that some firefighters could have saved or helped more 
people if they didn't panic. But some people did panic," Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have people jumping out of windows, you've got a panic situation," 
said Tom Perrin, Atlanta's acting fire chief. Perrin said the building was 
built in 1962, before a requirement that public buildings have sprinklers. 
"Three of the fire victims could have been saved if there had been a sprinkler 
system in this building," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lavon McCord of the Atlanta-Fulton County Emergency Management Agency said five 
people died in the fire, but officials could not account for the fifth death. 
Tony Gaines, an attendant in the county medical examiner's office, said the 
office had received reports of only four deaths. 
</P>
<P>
One woman who jumped from a sixth-floor window was critically injured, Walker 
said. The woman, one of 38 people taken to hospitals, suffered two broken legs, 
a fractured ankle and hand injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the others injured were treated for burns, smoke inhalation and cardiac 
arrest. Five of the injured were firefighters, four of whom suffered smoke 
inhalation and one who burned his hands, Walker said.

A judge on Friday gave custody of an orphaned toddler to his mother's longtime 
female companion, rather than the boy's blood relatives. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been co-parenting Collin," Susan Bellemare, 33, told a Vermont probate 
judge as she fought to win custody of the 15-month-old. "I would parent the 
child; I would love him, nurture him." 
</P>
<P>
Bellemare was named guardian of Collin Hamilton in the will of Susan Hamilton, 
who died in a car accident in May. Hamilton's parents are challenging the will, 
contending that they or Hamilton's sister, Kathleen, would be a better 
guardian. 
</P>
<P>
No one involved in the case would characterize the relationship of the two 
women, who owned a home together and reportedly exchanged wedding rings. They 
were companions for a dozen years and lived together while rearing the baby, 
who was conceived by artificial insemination. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not trying to cast aspersions on anybody," said Patrick Monaghan Jr., 
the lawyer for the grandparents, Philip and Elsa Hamilton of Montvale, N.J.

SLAYING SUSPECT POSSIBLY COULD BE D. B. COOPER

An FBI agent who investigated the D. B. Cooper airliner hijacking said Friday 
there are a number of similarities between Cooper and a man recently arrested 
in an 18-year-old New Jersey multiple murder case. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Himmelsbach, who retired in 1980, said Friday that he believes Cooper 
died when he parachuted from a Boeing 727 over southwest Washington in 1971 
with $200,000 in ransom. But Himmelsbach, who led the Cooper investigation, 
still believes that John E. List should be investigated. 
</P>
<P>
As a fugitive after the killings of five members of his family, List was 
considered a suspect in the hijacking from the beginning, Himmelsbach said. 
</P>
<P>
Descriptions of List and Cooper are similar. Both are accused of bizarre 
crimes, and a fugitive accused of mass murder has nothing to lose, Himmelsbach 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A man police say is List was arrested on June 1 in Richmond, Va. The man, who 
goes by the name Robert P. Clark, is in jail in New Jersey awaiting a court 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
FBI spokesman John Eyer in Seattle said Thursday that List was being 
investigated in the hijacking but said the inquiry was routine. "John List is 
one of any number of people suspected in the D. B. Cooper case," he said. 
</P>
<P>
David Baugh, List's lawyer in Richmond before he was returned to New Jersey, 
compared the alleged connection to reported sightings of Elvis Presley.

NORTH LOSES PLEA FOR NEW TRIAL BASED ON JUROR'S CONDUCT 
</P>

<P>
A federal district judge refused Friday to grant a new trial to former White 
House aide Oliver L. North, saying North had offered no proof that his 
conviction last May was biased by a juror's alleged misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, North's sentencing is expected to proceed on Wednesday as 
scheduled. North, convicted on three of 12 felony counts for his role in the 
Iran-Contra affair, could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison and fined as 
much as $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
North was found guilty on May 4 of altering and destroying top-secret 
documents, helping to mislead Congress and illegally accepting a $13,800 home 
security system as a gift. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Withheld Information 
</P>
<P>
The juror, Tara Leigh King, had failed to disclose that members of her family 
had been charged with crimes and that she had been questioned by a grand jury 
in connection with the investigation of a brother who was convicted of armed 
robbery. 
</P>
<P>
In a questionnaire, the 34-year-old copy machine operator had answered "no" 
when asked whether she or any member of her immediate family had been involved 
in any court proceeding or investigation. At a hearing Wednesday, King said she 
had forgotten the incidents. 
</P>
<P>
North's sentencing initially had been scheduled for June 23, but U.S. District 
Judge Gerhard A. Gesell postponed it to allow the hearing into questions that 
North's attorneys raised regarding King's fitness as a juror. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell noted Friday that King had voted to acquit North of many of the felony 
counts against him. 
</P>
<P>
"King was not biased for or against either side," Gesell wrote in his nine-page 
order. "No proof was presented indicating that King was unfair or that she 
failed in any way to serve conscientiously." 
</P>
<P>
Gesell wrote that King had been "distressed over (her brother's) conviction and 
the family was embarrassed. She may well have felt it would prevent her being 
considered for jury service. Her omission was knowing, but she had no desire to 
help or to hurt North or the prosecution." 
</P>
<P>
King admitted also that she had used drugs on occasion but insisted that she 
quit using them several months before the trial and never was under their 
influence during the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) announced 
Friday that he and 58 other House members plan to ask President Bush to pardon 
North. They plan to make their appeal at a news conference after North's 
sentencing.

ASSEMBLY REJECTS BILL PREVENTING CLEAR-CUTTING OF ANCIENT REDWOODS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Under heavy lobbying from the timber industry, the Assembly rejected 
legislation Friday aimed at preventing the clear-cutting of ancient stands of 
redwood trees in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Backed by environmentalists, the bill was directed particularly at the Pacific 
Lumber Co., which has greatly increased its harvest of redwood trees since it 
was taken over by the Maxxam Group with the financial assistance of junk bond 
wizard Michael Milken. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Byron Sher (D-Palo Alto), the author of the bill, conceded defeat 
after he was able to garner only 33 of the 54 votes needed for passage. He 
criticized representatives of the timber industry for spreading false charges 
that the bill would wreak havoc on the state's economy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Small Army of Lobbyists' 
</P>
<P>
"Those misconceptions emanate from the small army of lobbyists and public 
relations specialists hired by the Pacific Lumber Co. and the timber industry 
to convince you that what is really a very modest bill will destroy the economy 
of timber regions of the state and halt the construction of homes in 
California," Sher told his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Carpenter, a prominent lobbyist and former Republican state senator 
hired by Pacific Lumber, said the bill would not have had serious consequences 
for the company because it has already "promised" not to do any clear-cutting 
of redwoods. 
</P>
<P>
But he said that he and other timber industry representatives lobbied heavily 
against the measure because its passage would have given environmentalists an 
opportunity to start imposing restrictions on clear-cutting operations. 
</P>
<P>
"The timber industry has long felt that if you take one tool away, what's the 
next thing they come after?" Carpenter said. "He (Sher) has got a 
preservationist mentality that is inconsistent with trying to harvest these 
private lands the way they're zoned to be harvested." 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter pointed out that enormous stands of redwoods already have been 
preserved in public parks. "This is an emotional issue," he said. "It isn't a 
timber issue." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Dan Hauser (D-Arcata), who represents much of the timber region, 
asserted that the old-growth redwoods were in fact being destroyed by wind, 
highway construction crews and tourists who visit the area. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the impact of people in the parks that kill redwoods," Hauser told his 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Hauser succeeded in sabotaging the bill Thursday by winning passage of several 
hostile amendments. One would have required anyone who files suit against a 
timber company's harvesting plan to post a bond to reimburse the company if the 
challenge is unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expenditure Amendment 
</P>
<P>
A second amendment would have allocated $50,000 to conduct a study of the 
effects of the bill. While seemingly innocuous, this provision boosted the 
number of votes required from 41 to 54 because all expenditures require a 
two-thirds vote of the 80-member Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
But Sher pledged to return next year with another measure aimed at halting what 
he believes is the over-harvesting of old-growth redwoods -- trees that are as 
much as 1,000 to 1,500 years old. 
</P>
<P>
The assemblyman said some estimates indicate that all the old-growth redwood 
trees now in private hands will be cut within three to six years. "There won't 
be anything left to preserve," he said.

ASSEMBLY VOTES TO MOVE UP STATE PRIMARY TO MARCH

<P>
Seeking to increase the state's clout in the presidential nominating process, 
the Assembly on Friday passed and sent to the Senate a bill that would move 
California's presidential primary from June to the first week in March. 
</P>
<P>
Rushing to complete action before a self-imposed deadline Friday night, the 
Assembly also approved legislation to protect Mono Lake from water shortages 
and to require teen-age welfare mothers to get their high school diplomas. 
</P>
<P>
The presidential primary bill, approved on a 50-16 vote, would move California 
from the end of the nominating season to near the beginning, leaving only the 
Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary before Californians would have 
their say. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Jim Costa (D-Fresno), author of the bill, said the current system 
allows other states to choose 85% of the delegates to the presidential 
nominating conventions before California voters go to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
"Our citizens have very little impact on choosing the presidential nominees for 
both major parties," Costa said. "The current system makes California a 
bridesmaid." 
</P>
<P>
Although Gov. George Deukmejian has said he would support moving the primary, 
he has linked his support to the Legislature passing a proposal to elect the 
governor and lieutenant governor as a ticket. That proposal was shelved by a 
Senate committee earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Brett, the governor's press secretary, said the two issues are still 
linked in Deukmejian's mind. 
</P>
<P>
"If they send the presidential primary bill to his desk without the other 
legislation, the chances for a veto are very strong," Brett said. 
</P>
<P>
On another election issue, the Assembly narrowly passed a bill that would let 
voters decide whether to create a system of public financing for legislative 
elections. Backers of the legislation contend that the bill would reduce the 
influence of campaign contributions from special interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
The bill by Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara) would give the voters 
the chance to overrule Proposition 73, approved last year with a provision 
banning the use of taxpayers' money in state and local campaigns. The measure 
was approved by a vote of 41 to 34 and sent to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Vasconcellos argued that the voters should have another chance to decide the 
issue since they also approved Proposition 68 in the same election, which 
called for taxpayer financing of campaigns. However, the public financing 
provision of Proposition 68 never took effect because Proposition 73 received 
more votes. 
</P>
<P>
The Mono Lake measure, introduced by Assemblyman Phil Isenberg (D-Sacramento), 
is an attempt to end a decades-long dispute over how much water should be 
diverted from streams that feed the lake and shipped to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, passed by a vote of 54 to 12, would require the state Department of 
Water Resources and the city of Los Angeles to set a water level for the lake 
that would preserve its environment and protect the nesting and migratory birds 
that inhabit its islands. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the legislation would pay for a host of environmental 
projects by resolving a lingering dispute over $432 million loaned by the state 
to the Metropolitan Water District and other water contractors in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Under the compromise, the water contractors would be required to pay more than 
$200 million for environmental, recreational and agricultural cleanup programs 
-- with Mono Lake receiving top priority. The bill now goes to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The welfare bill by Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin (D-Union City) is designed to 
help young mothers get off welfare by requiring them to complete their high 
school educations. Approved by a vote of 70 to 4, the bill would apply to 16- 
and 17-year-old parents who receive welfare. 
</P>
<P>
The measure takes advantage of a provision in the new federal welfare law that 
allows a state to require teen-age welfare mothers as young as 16 to get their 
high school diplomas as a condition of receiving their welfare checks. With 
Assembly passage, the bill was sent to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, Deukmejian signed a much broader bill by Eastin that would 
conform the state's workfare program to the new federal law, including imposing 
the requirement that welfare parents with children as young as 3 participate in 
the work and training program. 
</P>
<P>
In another action, the Assembly passed a bill by Assemblyman Johan Klehs 
(D-Castro Valley) that would give a 50% tax credit for the purchase and 
installation of "telecommuting" equipment -- items used as a partial or total 
substitute for commuting to work. 
</P>
<P>
Equipment covered by the bill would include telephones, personal computers, 
modems, fax machines and copy machines. The measure, passed by a vote of 54 to 
8, now goes to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate, meanwhile passed a bill that would require the installation of 
fire-extinguishing systems in high-rise buildings. The measure by Sen. Art 
Torres (D-Los Angeles) was prompted by the May, 1988, fire at the First 
Interstate Bank Building in downtown Los Angeles that killed one person. The 
Senate sent the legislation to the Assembly on a vote of 21 to 13. 
</P>
<P>
And Deukmejian signed a bill requiring all licensed day-care homes, no matter 
how small, to install smoke detectors. The bill by Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los 
Angeles) was prompted by a fire at a Huntington Beach day-care center that 
killed two infants earlier this month.

ENVIRONMENTAL STUDY OF U.S. WATER PACTS SOUGHT

<P>
A White House council recommended Friday that major environmental studies be 
performed before the federal government renews long-term contracts for the 
delivery of irrigation water to farmers in the Central Valley of California. 
</P>
<P>
Findings by the President's Council on Environmental Quality are advisory but 
could hold great sway with a federal court that is considering a lawsuit 
brought by environmental groups seeking to block outright renewal of such 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Federal agencies have traditionally followed the council's recommendations as 
well, but it was not immediately clear whether the Interior Department, which 
administers federal water projects, would reverse its policy of renewing the 
contracts in this instance. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately at stake is 1.5 million acre-feet of water a year that the federal 
Bureau of Reclamation has delivered for four decades to farmers served by 28 
irrigation districts in the eastern San Joaquin Valley. That is roughly a 
year's supply for 3 million urban families. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Review Ordered 
</P>
<P>
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. said in a statement that he has ordered a 
review of the council's recommendations, and a spokesman added that the 
department, for the time being, would "stand by" its position. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the dispute is expected to set a precedent for about 300 
long-term contracts providing water to 2.7 million acres of irrigated land 
throughout the Central Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Reclamation, an Interior Department agency, had intended to renew 
the irrigation contracts as they expired for another 40 years for the same 
amount of water. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan has said he is "morally and legally bound" to do that under a 1956 law 
guaranteeing farmers indefinite access to the water on which they depend to 
maintain land values and obtain crucial financing. 
</P>
<P>
But a suit filed earlier this year by the Natural Resources Defense Council 
contends that the bureau should not renew the contracts without a formal 
environmental assessment. The group is concerned about the effects of massive 
water diversions on river fisheries, wetlands and water quality downstream. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposite Sides 
</P>
<P>
The dispute has pitted the Interior Department against the Environmental 
Protection Agency, which has taken the side of conservationists and asked the 
President's council to arbitrate. 
</P>
<P>
After two months of hearings and deliberations, the three-member presidential 
council agreed with the EPA that locking up huge quantities of water for 40 
more years constitutes a major federal action requiring a comprehensive study 
of the consequences under the National Environmental Policy Act.

ANTELOPE VALLEY BLAZE CONTAINED; CLEVELAND FOREST FIRE CONTROLLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Firefighters got the upper hand Friday on an 8,200-acre brush fire in Cleveland 
National Forest that destroyed 11 structures near Lake Elsinore in Riverside 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Aided by higher humidity and a decrease in wind, fire crews had more than 85% 
of the blaze surrounded late Friday afternoon and began releasing many of the 
2,300 people who had been fighting the fire. Officials predicted that the blaze 
would be completely under control by Saturday morning but would not be 
extinguished until midday Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2,000 Acres Burned 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a brush fire that burned more than 2,000 acres of mostly rugged 
terrain in the Antelope Valley this week was contained by firefighters Friday 
morning, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities estimated that fighting the fire near Lake Elsinore will wind up 
costing $1.5 million. They said the blaze resulted in more than $1.1 million 
damage to various structures in remote canyons and to the watershed that feeds 
Lake Elsinore. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the fire appears to have been caused by people near a 
roadside store just across the Orange County line, near the crest of Ortega 
Highway. They again appealed to the public for help in identifying those 
responsible. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charred Landscape 
</P>
<P>
Dean McAlister, a U.S. Forest Service spokesman, said fire crews late Friday 
were hiking into the rugged, charred landscape along the Orange-Riverside 
county line to do battle with sections of the fire still consuming brush and 
timber. Officials said they hope to salvage some of the unaffected terrain, 
which can act as habitat islands for birds and other wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
Although officials first believed that the fire would be contained by late 
Friday afternoon, they revised their estimates because of troubles battling 
lingering flames on the southern edge of the blaze, inside the rugged, 
3,400-acre San Mateo Wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
Fire crews were forced to work mostly with shovels, picks and other hand 
equipment to cut fire lines in that area. 
</P>
<P>
"It's down to the hard grunt work, the stuff for the guys who like to sweat," 
said Stephen Guarino, a Riverside County Fire Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Residents Return 
</P>
<P>
Residents evacuated from 200 homes near Lake Elsinore on Wednesday evening have 
returned to their houses, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ortega Highway will remain closed through the weekend as crews continue to 
work, effectively shutting down several popular campgrounds and picnic spots 
over the busy holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Four firefighters were injured fighting the blaze, one of them seriously, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Forest Service spokesman Robert Brady said the Antelope Valley fire was 
100% contained at 8 a.m. Friday. All Los Angeles County firefighters were 
released from the fire lines, and a crew of 95 Forest Service firefighters were 
left to "mop up," Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Home Burned 
</P>
<P>
The fire claimed 2,250 acres along the outskirts of Elizabeth Lake and Green 
Valley. Six structures were burned, including one home, and more than 1,000 
people were forced to temporarily evacuate on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
More than 300 firefighters battled the blaze during the three days. Brady said 
there were no injuries reported.

BATTERY COUNT FILED AGAINST ZSA ZSA GABOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN KENDALL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zsa Zsa Gabor was charged Friday with misdemeanor battery on a Beverly Hills 
police officer, who claimed that he was slapped by the Hungarian-born actress 
after stopping her white Rolls-Royce for having out-of-date license tags. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office also accused Gabor of 
disobeying a lawful order of a police officer and driving with an expired 
driver's license -- both misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted on the battery charge, Gabor could face a maximum penalty of a 
year in jail and a $2,000 fine, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Elden Fox, who filed 
the complaint. The other misdemeanor charges carry a maximum penalty of six 
months in jail and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to these charges, Gabor was accused of carrying an open alcoholic 
beverage container in a car and driving with an expired registration -- 
infractions subject to fines. 
</P>
<P>
Gabor, 70, was arrested June 14 on La Cienega Boulevard by motorcycle officer 
Paul Kramer, who said he first stopped her for expired license tags and was 
then forced to pull her over again at Olympic Boulevard and Le Doux Road when 
she "took off." 
</P>
<P>
Kramer said that when he ordered Gabor to get out of her car the second time 
she slapped his face. Two days later, a still angry Gabor displayed bruises at 
a press conference and declared that she was "standing up for the battered 
women of America." 
</P>
<P>
Her attorney, William T. Graysen, said Friday that Gabor intends to plead 
innocent and ask for a speedy trial. 
</P>
<P>
"My client's defense is going to be . . . that Officer Kramer was excessively 
violent in his dealings with Miss Gabor, and she used her right of self defense 
to defend herself," Graysen said. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to reach Kramer through the Beverly Hills Police Department were 
unsuccessful.

LOCKHEED TO PAY FULL $1.49 MILLION IN SAFETY PENALTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN and JAMES PELTZ, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Department of Labor announced Friday that Lockheed Corp. has agreed to pay 
$1.49 million in penalties -- the full amount proposed by the federal agency -- 
for 440 violations of workplace safety rules. 
</P>
<P>
This is the highest fine to be paid by a company for health and safety 
violations in California and the second-largest fine paid by a company in the 
19-year history of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
4-Month Inquiry 
</P>
<P>
The citations issued in March followed a four-month investigation by OSHA of a 
section of Lockheed's Burbank plant where highly classified Defense Department 
work is done. Lockheed is building the top-secret stealth jet fighter, designed 
to evade enemy radar. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the settlement Friday, Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co., a Lockheed 
Corp. subsidiary, also agreed to correct all violations for which it was cited. 
</P>
<P>
The company stated that it already had corrected a number of the alleged 
violations and agreed to correct the rest within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got an employer who seems to have turned the corner," Frank Strasheim, 
OSHA's regional director, said in San Francisco. "I compare the progress 
they've made now to what it was like when we went in, and I'd say they're 80% 
of the way there. . . . They've made a commitment of resources (to correct the 
alleged violations) that are above and beyond our standards." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worker Complaints 
</P>
<P>
The investigation was prompted by workers' claims that dozens of Lockheed 
employees had become ill from exposure to hazardous substances at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
OSHA asserted that Lockheed failed to properly mark which chemicals and other 
materials were dangerous and to adequately warn workers how to safely use them. 
The agency also alleged that Lockheed kept poor records about which workers 
became sick or injured at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
By settling, Lockheed agreed to make significantly greater disclosures to 
workers about the nature and potential hazards of the chemicals they use, 
according to an OSHA official. 
</P>
<P>
In March, OSHA also announced that it was launching a "wall-to-wall" 
investigation of all Lockheed facilities in Burbank, Palmdale and Rye Canyon. 
An OSHA official said Friday that he expected that investigation to last 
another four to six weeks. About 14,000 workers are employed in more than 200 
buildings in Burbank alone. 
</P>
<P>
The OSHA official, who requested anonymity, said the agency was finding "some 
problems." But he stressed: "So far we've had outstanding cooperation. I'm 
impressed with the amount of money they've put into the correction of 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
About 90 Lockheed workers have filed civil suits against the company, alleging 
that they were injured on the job as a result of exposure to chemicals and that 
the company had failed to adequately warn them of the hazards. About 150 have 
filed workers' compensation claims. The workers who have sued contend that they 
suffer from skin rashes, headaches, memory loss and cancer, among other 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the workers also claim that they became ill after handling hazardous 
"composite" chemicals, which are lightweight yet strong plastic-like materials 
that are increasingly used in aircraft construction. Composites are essential 
in stealth planes because the materials do not reflect radar waves as readily 
as metals, making the planes harder to detect. At a U.S. Senate hearing in 
March, medical experts said composite materials pose a "widespread" health 
threat to workers exposed to them. 
</P>
<P>
Some workers had hoped that the OSHA complaint against the company would aid 
them in their civil suits. But they will not get much comfort from the 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
There is detailed legal language in the agreement that Lockheed is not 
admitting that it did anything wrong. And the agreement goes on to say that 
"nothing contained" in the settlement can be "offered or admitted as evidence 
or an admission" in court that violations occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed spokesman Jim Ragsdale said the company was pleased with the 
settlement. He stressed that the language of the settlement provided that none 
of the violations against the company were any longer classified as "willful" 
violations. Of the original 440 violations, 341 were deemed "willful," which 
under OSHA's rules means that Lockheed either knew that a workplace condition 
was a violation or was aware that an unsafe condition existed and made "no 
reasonable effort" to fix it. 
</P>
<P>
Ragsdale said it was important to the company that the characterization of the 
violations be changed because it is the company's policy "to abide by all the 
rules of OSHA. If we had known we were in violation we would have done 
something." 
</P>
<P>
However, a ranking OSHA official noted that "with the dollar amount of this 
penalty, the implicit message is that there were willful violations." The 
official emphasized that the penalties were now characterized as coming under a 
section of the Occupational Safety and Health Act that says: "Any employer who 
willfully or repeatedly violates requirements of Section 5 of this act . . . 
may be prescribed a civil penalty of not more than $10,000" a violation. 
</P>
<P>
It is unusual for OSHA to collect the full amount of a penalty that it 
proposes. In many negotiated settlements, OSHA has collected well under half of 
the original penalty that it proposed. The agency was criticized last week for 
its settlement practices in a report issued by the National Safe Workplace 
Institute, a nonprofit group based in Chicago.

GLENN S. DUMKE DIES; GUIDED STATE UNIVERSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glenn S. Dumke, who as chancellor of the California State University system 
melded 16 separate schools into a unified system during its greatest two 
decades of tumult and growth, has died at his home in Los Angeles. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
Dumke, chancellor from 1961 to 1982, died of a heart attack Thursday night, a 
spokesman for the university system announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very sad loss for everyone in higher education," said the current 
chancellor, W. Ann Reynolds, who succeeded Dumke when he retired in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Remarkable Accomplishment' 
</P>
<P>
"Glenn Dumke did something that many people thought was impossible: He 
organized 16 separate universities into a single system that has become a model 
across the nation. It was a remarkable accomplishment and it happened because 
Dr. Dumke was a visionary leader. 
</P>
<P>
"He was respected by everyone who knew him," Reynolds added, "and he will be 
greatly missed." 
</P>
<P>
As president of San Francisco State in the late 1950s, Dumke helped draft and 
remained a chief spokesman for "The Master Plan for Higher Education in 
California." 
</P>
<P>
The plan became the blueprint for the state's two-track University of 
California and State University (originally State Colleges) system and a model 
for other systems of higher education throughout the nation and the world. 
</P>
<P>
In 1961, as vice chancellor of academic affairs and then as chancellor, Dumke 
forged the once separate campuses into a viable system with unified academic 
goals and standards and lobbying clout with the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
During his tenure, the system grew from 16 to 19 campuses and enrollment 
tripled, reaching 319,000 by his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
(Although the New York college system is larger, it includes both junior and 
senior schools; California is the largest senior system in the country in both 
campuses and student population.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Survivor 
</P>
<P>
A conservative, Dumke became known as a political survivor because of his 
ability to get along with both the conservative and liberal boards of trustees 
appointed by Democratic Govs. Edmund G. Brown Sr. and Jr. and Republican Gov. 
Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
He muted the protests of continuing budget cutbacks under Gov. Reagan, and by 
doing so, many believe, enabled the State University to fare better than the 
University of California, whose officials were more outspoken in their 
objections. 
</P>
<P>
Dumke vociferously opposed militant student and faculty protests against the 
Vietnam War and tuition and fee increases when those protests flared at San 
Francisco State and other campuses in the late 1960s and early 1970s. But, 
again demonstrating his political skill, few students were expelled and few 
faculty members fired during his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
When he announced his plans to retire on his 65th birthday, a year in advance 
to give trustees time for a nationwide search for his successor, Dumke jokingly 
told news reporters that the position required "someone who can walk on water." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Green Bay, Wis., in 1917, Dumke moved to California in 1923. He earned 
his bachelor's and master's degrees at Occidental College and his doctorate at 
UCLA. During his education career, he garnered nine honorary doctoral degrees 
from universities throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
Dumke taught history at Occidental beginning in 1940 and eventually became dean 
of the Occidental faculty before leaving for the San Francisco State presidency 
in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Remained a Historian 
</P>
<P>
He remained a historian until his death, writing textbooks during his teaching 
career and historical novels as a hobby during his years in administration and 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"I have always felt in teaching history that the best kind of supplemental 
reading was the biographical novel of the kind Irving Stone writes," Dumke told 
a Times writer in 1986 after the publication of his fifth novel. 
</P>
<P>
"You can arouse people's interest in history without warping it or wrenching it 
out of shape," he said. "I think people turn against history because it's often 
so poorly written and poorly taught. I don't think history is a social science. 
It's a humanity. It's an art." 
</P>
<P>
An expert on western U.S. history, Dumke wrote three Westerns. He wrote three 
other novels centered on Haroun-el-Rashid (the one-time Caliph of Baghdad), 
England's King Richard III and Benedict Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote under the names Jordan Allen and Glenn Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
After his retirement in 1982, Dumke served as president of a San Diego-based 
think tank called the Foundation for the Twenty-First Century. Among his 
national awards were the USO Distinguished American Award and the George 
Washington Honor Medal of the Freedom Foundation for his contributions to 
education and to history. 
</P>
<P>
Dumke is survived by his wife, Dorothy. 
</P>
<P>
Services will be at the Church of the Recessional, Forest Lawn in Glendale, at 
2:30 p.m. Wednesday. The family has asked that memorial contributions be made 
to the Historical Society of Southern California.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE CAN'T WAIT FOR POLANSKI, RETIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles judge who once vowed to remain on the bench until Roman 
Polanski returned for sentencing retired Friday, saying, "I can't wait that 
long," and turned in his gavel. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Laurence J. Rittenband, the 83-year-old "judge of the 
stars" whose legal career spanned 60 years, presided over Elvis Presley's 
divorce, Marlon Brando's child custody battle, a paternity suit against Cary 
Grant and the "Billionaire Boys Club" murder trial of Joe Hunt. 
</P>
<P>
Rittenband, with his colorful vocabulary and outspoken style, said because of 
his age it was time to "let someone else do it."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FIREBOMB TOSSED IN HOUSE; WOMAN HURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Altadena woman suffered second- and third-degree burns over most of her body 
early Friday morning after a Molotov cocktail tossed through her bedroom window 
set her single-story home ablaze, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Cennie Elaine Earby, 34, suffered burns over 90% of her body when her home at 
578 W. Palm St. was firebombed about 2:15 a.m., a spokesman for the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Nine people in the home escaped unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
Earby was airlifted to Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena and, hours 
later, flown to the Sherman Oaks Burn Center. Earby, who Sheriff's Department 
spokesmen said was dragged from the house by three unnamed people, is listed in 
critical condition at the burn center. 
</P>
<P>
Department spokesmen said they suspect that the bombing may have been in 
retaliation for an earlier, undisclosed gang-related incident.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COST PANEL TO REVIEW 'RED LINE' SUBWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mindful that government officials are in a frugal mood, the county 
Transportation Commission has set up a cost-reduction panel to review the 
second stage of the Metro Rail's "red line" subway project. 
</P>
<P>
The 17.3-mile "red line" segment is a linchpin of the projected 150-mile 
countywide system, and will cost about $2.8 billion. Transportation 
Commission's executive director, Neil Peterson, said that with the recent news 
that the estimated cost of the second phase is $338 million higher than earlier 
projected, "it is absolutely necessary to convene this panel" with an eye to 
"controlling costs." About 15% of the engineering work is completed, and the 
initial 4.4-mile segment of the "red line," running from Los Angeles' Union 
Station to Wilshire Boulevard and Alvarado Street, is about one-third complete. 
</P>
<P>
The total $2.8-billion cost is being paid for by federal gas tax revenues, 
local Proposition A funds, state gas-tax funds and city and special business 
tax revenues. By 1995, all 46 miles and 39 stations of the Los Angeles portion 
of the system is expected to be operating. The entire line, out to North 
Hollywood, is expected to be open in 2001.

EMBATTLED HEAD OF NATIONAL COUNCIL OF CHURCHES QUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
When the embattled administrator of the nation's preeminent ecumenical agency, 
the National Council of Churches, announced his resignation this week, he 
confirmed what many church leaders said was inevitable, given his no-confidence 
vote a month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Arie Brouwer said his decision to resign as general secretary 
effective today was not prompted by any pressures on him but by a recognition 
that it is "a time for change" in the position, which he has filled since 
January, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the council's governing board, Brouwer referred to the board's 
tumultuous May meeting in Lexington, Ky., and said, "I subsequently decided 
that I could not continue as general secretary of the NCC because, under those 
circumstances, I could not carry further the work which is essential to my 
vocational fulfillment." 
</P>
<P>
Brouwer had earlier been accused by critics of treating the council's staff in 
an authoritarian manner. But opposition to Brouwer grew when he delivered a 
no-holds-barred speech to the board in which he accused critics of "character 
assassination" and a "lust for retribution." 
</P>
<P>
A minister in the Reformed Church in America, Brouwer narrowly retained his job 
at the May meeting when the members split -- the vote was 57-57 with 13 
abstentions -- on a motion to "seek out new leadership." 
</P>
<P>
The resignation comes at a particularly sensitive time for the financially and 
politically beleaguered body, which represents 32 denominations with a 
membership in excess of 40 million. Last month, the board also approved a plan 
for a massive overhaul and streamlining of the council's structure, intended in 
part to help overcome the financial woes of the agency, which saw its effective 
income drop by 53% from 1975 to 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Some denominational representatives who responded to news of Brouwer's 
resignation said his decision could give the council an opportunity to press on 
with the important business at hand, rather than devoting so much time and 
energy to the question of leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Edmond Browning, who heads the Episcopal Church, said, "This is a time 
for new leadership in the council to help the churches of the United States to 
move forward into a renewal of the ecumenical movement. . . . We must leave 
behind the conflicts and uncertainties of the past and teach ourselves to 
prepare for pioneering in the future." 
</P>
<P>
James A. Hamilton, the council's chief public policy and legal affairs official 
and its senior ranking staff official, has been appointed acting general 
secretary until an "interim general secretary" is named.

SUIT ACCUSES BANES OF ILLEGALLY DIVERTING STATE LUPUS FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than $1 million in state funds appropriated for lupus research has been 
illegally diverted to non-lupus projects, a coalition of lupus support 
organizations charged Friday in a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The suit on behalf of taxpayers was filed in Superior Court in Van Nuys against 
Assemblyman Tom Bane (D-Tarzana) and members of the state lupus board headed by 
Bane's wife, Marlene. 
</P>
<P>
It is the latest chapter in a bitter dispute between the volunteer lupus groups 
and Bane, who pulled the funding plug on the state Lupus Appropriations Board 
earlier this year. The legal action came three days after the state attorney 
general's office announced that it is auditing allocations by the lupus board 
and by a nonprofit lupus foundation run by Bane. 
</P>
<P>
Those inquiries were initiated in response to letters from representatives of 
the Lupus Foundation of America and the Lupus Society of America. The 
organizations, the two largest lupus support groups, also spearheaded the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Funds Freeze Sought 
</P>
<P>
The suit asked the court to freeze $400,000 that a 1987 bill sponsored by Bane 
redirected from the lupus board to a controversial blood study. It contends 
that the study would benefit the firm of a lupus board member, creating a 
possible conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the lupus groups sought an injunction to prevent $572,000 in 
unspent money appropriated for lupus research this year from reverting to the 
general state fund when the 1989-90 year begins today. A hearing on the matter 
was scheduled for July 26. In the Legislature's budget sent to Gov. George 
Deukmejian, the funds would be reappropriated for a Lyme Disease Surveillance 
and Prevention Program. 
</P>
<P>
"We are incensed that any state legislator would consider any diversion of 
funds already allocated by the state Legislature," said Nancy G. Horn, 
president of the Greater Los Angeles Chapter of the Lupus Foundation of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Bane responded that the lawsuit is futile because neither he nor the other 
defendants have the power to change the 1989-90 budget passed this week by the 
Legislature. He called the legal action political harassment. 
</P>
<P>
The lupus volunteer groups, he said, are merely "antagonizing those people who 
have been working on their behalf a lot of years." 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in the name of a Tarzana resident who suffers from lupus, also 
asserts that the Banes illegally diverted money from the lupus board to obtain 
campaign contributions for Bane and Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco). It seeks unspecified monetary damages against the Banes and the 
other two members of the state lupus board, Drs. Joshua Levy and Kenneth M. 
Nies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Personal Fiefdom' 
</P>
<P>
Scientists who applied for research grants from the lupus board have said they 
were contacted by high-pressure solicitors for Bane's and Brown's campaigns. 
Marlene Bane oversees fund raising for both her husband and Brown in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"Although we acknowledge that the board has contributed to lupus research in 
the state during this time, it has also become a sort of personal fiefdom for 
Tom Bane and for the fund-raising efforts of Marlene Bane," attorney Debra J. 
Wegman said. 
</P>
<P>
Bane said solicitors were not supposed to make any connection between tickets 
to his $500-a-person fund-raising dinner for scientists and "anything they 
received or hoped to receive." He said this applied to Brown's dinners as well. 
</P>
<P>
Under any circumstances, Wegman said, "it's an unfair pressure on those 
researchers." 
</P>
<P>
The lupus board has dispensed $6.2 million to scientists since it was 
established in 1976. The board received $572,000 for the 1988-89 fiscal year 
but never met to award any grants -- apparently because Tom and Marlene Bane 
were upset that the state Department of Health Services began to play a more 
active role in overseeing the board. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that the top recipient of lupus board funds, Dr. Raymond L. 
Teplitz, was engaged in research projects that "had little or nothing to do 
with lupus." Of the $800,000 granted to Teplitz, "less than $50,000 has been 
spent on lupus research," the suit asserts. Teplitz is a longtime friend of the 
Banes and a contributor to Tom Bane's campaign committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Institutions Funded 
</P>
<P>
Bane said Friday that the lupus board funded institutions, not individuals. He 
added that research Teplitz oversaw while he was at the City of Hope National 
Medical Center in Duarte "established the genetic factors of lupus" and 
"perfected a test to determine whether a person did or did not have lupus." 
</P>
<P>
Teplitz, who has transferred to UC Davis, has declined to discuss his research. 
</P>
<P>
The blood study controversy focuses on Levy, a lupus board member and the 
medical director of HemaCare Corp., a Sherman Oaks blood firm. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature set aside $400,000 from lupus appropriations for a blood study 
in 1987. The previous year, Bane succeeded in passing a bill that created an 
exemption from a 1977 law that prohibited the use of paid donor blood unless 
volunteer blood was unavailable. The study, which has not been done, is to 
determine whether blood from paid donors is as safe as blood from volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
Health Services officials say the prime beneficiary of the measure is HemaCare, 
another campaign contributor to Bane. Levy, a friend of the Banes and a 
campaign contributor, was appointed to the Lupus Appropriations Board in 1985 
at the Banes' recommendation.

NFL'S OWNERS IN RIFT?; 
</P>
<P>
THEY MAY SPLIT OVER COMMITTEE'S CHOICE OF FINKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fight between the National Football League's two principal factions is likely 
Thursday if an NFL committee persists in its plans to recommend a new 
commissioner at that time, a club owner said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Hugh Culverhouse, president of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, said that many of the 
league's newer owners are bitter over two of this week's developments: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The selection committee's unanimous endorsement of Jim Finks, general 
manager of the New Orleans Saints, to succeed Pete Rozelle. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The plan to round up NFL owners on less than a week's notice for a special 
meeting to choose the commissioner Thursday in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm outraged that they would unanimously recommend Jim Finks," Culverhouse 
said. "They said they would present three or four names -- and they come up 
with one man. 
</P>
<P>
"Secondly, it's an outrage to call a league meeting for July 6 on six days' 
notice. That's two days after a four-day holiday -- a holiday for which many 
people made travel plans long ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I'm leaving as planned for South America tomorrow. Other (owners) 
are overseas or out of town. It's inexcusable for them to call (a meeting) at 
this time. 
</P>
<P>
"This is probably the most important NFL meeting any of us will ever attend -- 
after all, we're selecting a commissioner -- and they call it on unbelievably 
short notice. That's arrogance." 
</P>
<P>
Other owners made similar points but asked not to be quoted. 
</P>
<P>
The co-chairmen of the selection committee, Lamar Hunt of the Kansas City 
Chiefs and Wellington Mara of the New York Giants, were unavailable, as was 
Finks. 
</P>
<P>
All were observing a long weekend over one of the few national holidays 
available to pro football people, who, Culverhouse noted, play games during 
many of the other holiday periods. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to reach the chairmen, Culverhouse, saying he was speaking for several 
of the newer owners, wired both Mara and Hunt to express discontent. 
</P>
<P>
" 'I urge you to reconsider your plans,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Finks has been called the favorite of the NFL's old guard. 
</P>
<P>
The other faction is largely made up of owners who have come into the NFL in 
recent years. Eight clubs have changed hands in just the 1980s -- Denver, 
Philadelphia, San Diego, New Orleans, Seattle, Minnesota, New England and 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
The presidents of these teams, who paid up to $100 million apiece for 
franchises, say their problems are much different from the problems of the 
old-guard owners, some of whom paid little or nothing for their franchises in a 
different era. 
</P>
<P>
The newer group is concerned that Finks or any other old-guard choice might 
ignore them and their large debt structures. 
</P>
<P>
If Finks is the only candidate endorsed, they said they'll nominate a candidate 
of their own at the Chicago meeting, precipitating a fight. 
</P>
<P>
It takes 19 of 28 owners' votes to elect. 
</P>
<P>
"When the (selection) committee was named at the spring meeting (in March), 
they said they'd come up with several (candidates) for us to (consider)," 
Culverhouse said. "That's what we want." 
</P>
<P>
Asked what he expects if Finks' name is the only one presented, Culverhouse 
said: "The (old guard) will be in deep trouble." 
</P>
<P>
It's a sore point because, to begin with, the new owners' faction was bitter 
that none of them was named to the selection committee. 
</P>
<P>
"That committee represents one point of view," said Norman Braman, owner of the 
Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Hunt and Mara, the selection group includes Art Modell of 
Cleveland, Ralph Wilson of Buffalo, Dan Rooney of Pittsburgh and Robert Parins 
of Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"When the committee was named, I was afraid of something like this," a younger 
owner said. 
</P>
<P>
Culverhouse said: "I think they should postpone the meeting for a week or 
schedule it to coincide with a (special Chicago) meeting already scheduled for 
July 18." 
</P>
<P>
Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie, set to leave for Europe Sunday, said his plans 
were now unsettled.

HONING DODGER HITTERS OF FUTURE; 
</P>
<P>
EX-SLUGGER REGGIE SMITH PROVES TEACHING CAN BE TWO-EDGED SWORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Heads turned when Reggie Smith, flourishing a samurai sword, entered the 
Bakersfield Dodgers' clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he was going to cut somebody's head off," said outfielder K. G. 
White. 
</P>
<P>
But Smith was not thinking decapitation. He simply was going to take a few cuts 
with the sword before batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
A former Dodger slugger, Smith is in his first season as a roving hitting 
instructor for the Dodgers' minor league teams in Bakersfield; San Antonio; 
Albuquerque, N.M.; Great Falls, Mont., and Salem, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
And the ceremonial sword is an instructional tool Smith uses to teach players 
the correct way to grip a bat. 
</P>
<P>
"It piques everyone's curiosity," Smith said of his sword. "But once they 
understand what I'm trying to do, then they can take it and apply it to what 
they're trying to do with a baseball bat." 
</P>
<P>
Where did Smith get the idea of using a sword to teach hitting? 
</P>
<P>
He got it in Japan, where he spent two seasons with the Tokyo Giants at the end 
of his playing career in 1983 and '84. Sadaharu Oh, the great Japanese home run 
hitter, who was Smith's manager there, practiced with a 600-year-old samurai 
sword. 
</P>
<P>
Fans stopped to stare while Smith tutored a player in the batting cage before a 
recent game here. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, it's kung fu batting practice," a boy shouted as a player gripped the 
sword. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's unusual teaching methods have apparently worked for Bakersfield, which 
won the first-half championship in the California League, its first title since 
1984. The Class A Dodgers had 10 of the 24 players in the league's All-Star 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Johnson, Bakersfield manager, credits Smith with improving the team's 
hitting. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, Reggie Smith is the finest hitting coach I've ever been around," 
Johnson said. "I played for Milwaukee for six years and I thought Harvey Kuenn 
(the late Brewer coach and manager) was the best hitting coach, but Reggie is 
better. 
</P>
<P>
"Reggie relates to the kids well. He was a superstar, but he gets down on their 
level." 
</P>
<P>
The Bakersfield Dodgers, a team composed mainly of players in their second year 
of pro ball, lead the California League in batting with a team average of .260. 
</P>
<P>
"We lead the California League in hitting due largely to Reggie's help," said 
Guy Conti, a Bakersfield coach. "He's been a tremendous asset to us. He really 
communicates well with the players." 
</P>
<P>
First baseman Eric Karros, a former UCLA player, leads the league with a .317 
average, and shortstop Jose Offerman was third with a .306 average before he 
was promoted to San Antonio, a double-A team. 
</P>
<P>
Karros said: "A lot of hitting coaches just generalize and say everybody needs 
to do this or that, but Reggie breaks down everybody personally. And I think 
that's what makes him successful. 
</P>
<P>
"He works toward your strength. He doesn't generalize. He knows what worked for 
him isn't going to work for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Braulio Castillo, who has perhaps the quickest bat in the Dodger 
minor league system, leads the league with 60 runs batted in. Castillo is one 
of Smith's projects. Smith has been trying to get Castillo to hit to the 
opposite field and rewards Castillo with a steak dinner for every 
opposite-field hit. 
</P>
<P>
"Reggie helps me a lot," Castillo said. "He's teaching me to hit the curveball 
and to stay back in the box." 
</P>
<P>
Smith displays the same work ethic as a batting instructor that he maintained 
as a player. 
</P>
<P>
He gives each player individual attention in the batting cage before games, 
analyzing their swings, stances and balance. During games, he charts his 
hitters. 
</P>
<P>
Smith stresses that the most important part of hitting is psychological. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always said the toughest ballpark to play in is the one with the 
five-inch fences," Smith said, tapping his fingers against his head. "There are 
certain natural movements that your brain has been telling your body to do ever 
since you were born. You have to listen to your brain." 
</P>
<P>
If a player is struggling, Smith goes over videotapes to diagnose the problem, 
followed by a session at the batting cage. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Boddie, a Bakersfield outfielder battling a slump, worked with Smith 
before a recent game. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm ready for my whippin,' Reggie," Boddie said as he greeted Smith in the 
clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
While watching a videotape of Boddie batting, Smith instantly noticed that 
Boddie had been collapsing his left knee before swinging. 
</P>
<P>
Smith took Boddie to a batting cage and pitched underhanded to Boddie until 
shortly before the game. A group of players watched as Smith worked with 
Boddie, hoping to pick up tips. 
</P>
<P>
'Reggie relates well to us," said Boddie. "Most of us grew up watching him 
play. Talking to him is like talking to your older brother." 
</P>
<P>
Although Smith, 44, seems to enjoy his camaraderie with the young Bakersfield 
Dodgers, bantering with players before and after games, he is able to maintain 
a teacher-student relationship while instructing them. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always thought of myself as a teacher," Smith said. "There's a difference 
between being a teacher and a coach. I have a lot of my own theories that I've 
developed and feel will help the hitters. But a coach primarily implements 
somebody else's program. I'm a teacher." 
</P>
<P>
Smith had some good teachers, too. 
</P>
<P>
While he was a rookie with the Boston Red Sox, his hitting coach was Ted 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
"He used to call me 'Bush,' " Smith said. "I don't think he ever called me by 
my real name." 
</P>
<P>
Spotting a potential hitting star, Williams spent extra time working with 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"He would ask me where each pitch was," Smith recalled. "I'd say it was about 
an inch outside, and he'd jump all over me. He said if you didn't know where 
the pitch was, how do you expect to hit it? 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest thing I learned from Ted Williams was that when I was hitting, it 
wasn't me against the pitcher, it was me against the baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Williams apparently taught Smith well. 
</P>
<P>
A switch-hitting power hitter, Smith compiled a career average of .287 with 314 
home runs and 1,092 RBIs in 17 seasons with the Red Sox, St. Louis Cardinals 
and Dodgers. He helped the Red Sox win the American League pennant in his 
rookie season, 1967, and was the catalyst as the Dodgers won the National 
League championship in 1977 and 1978, his first two seasons with the club. 
Smith also helped the Dodgers win the 1981 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has been out of the majors since 1982, Smith can still hit. He had 
a double and a single in a recent old-timers' game at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't retire because I couldn't hit," he said. "I retired because I was 
tired of getting into shape to play. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to spend more time with my kids and I was starting to think about 
other things and my concentration was starting to wane. I knew it was time to 
get out." 
</P>
<P>
His future secure after earning $2 million for playing the two seasons in 
Japan, Smith opened a successful computer-supply business after retiring in Los 
Angeles in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Why did Smith return to baseball? 
</P>
<P>
After being contacted by the black baseball coalition, an organization of 
former major league players who seek to get more blacks involved in baseball 
management, Smith called the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't really think that the Dodgers would have any openings," Smith said. 
"I thought I'd make the call just to satisfy the black baseball network." 
</P>
<P>
But there was an opening because Willie Davis, the Dodgers' minor league 
hitting instructor last season, had taken a job in the club's speakers' bureau. 
</P>
<P>
So Smith was hired. 
</P>
<P>
"I found out that I'd been suppressing an urge to teach hitting," Smith said. 
"I had been teaching hitting to kids on a private basis and I when I got back 
into (organized) baseball, I realized how much fun I'd been missing." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Claire, Dodger executive vice president, thinks Smith has done a good job. 
</P>
<P>
"We were fortunate to hire Reggie because he knows hitting," Claire said. "He 
knows every aspect of the game. And he has great intelligence for the game and 
many things beyond. I'm very pleased that he's with us." 
</P>
<P>
Smith also handles special assignments for the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
He recently joined the Dodgers in San Diego to tutor slumping outfielder John 
Shelby. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to work in reverse with him. I asked him how he wanted to hit and he was 
receptive to that. I knew we were on the right track." 
</P>
<P>
Working with the Dodgers' minor league players, however, remains Smith's 
primary job. 
</P>
<P>
"I get a thrill watching the young players develop," he said. "I want them to 
get (to the majors). That's my reward."

TOUR DE FRANCE;

<P>
DELGADO TO LEAD 200-RIDER FIELD IN PROLOGUE

<P>
The Tour de France begins today, with Pedro Delgado of Spain defending his 
title against a field of 200 riders in the 23-day event. 
</P>
<P>
The world's most famous cycling race gets under way with a 4.8-mile prologue in 
the duchy of Luxembourg. The first two official legs, a team time trial and a 
regular stage, are scheduled for Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
After two days in Belgium, the 2,020-mile journey will cover a counterclockwise 
route across France's plains, mountains and valleys before ending on the Champs 
Elysees in Paris on July 23. 
</P>
<P>
The mountain stages in the Pyrenees and the Alps will probably determine the 
champion. But the time gained on the flatlands of western France could have a 
bearing on the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
This year, in a break from the traditional format, the final portion of the 
race will be a time trial from Versailles to Paris. Instead of the winner 
riding safely in the pack, the leader will be alone and the followers trying to 
gain time. If the difference is only a few seconds, the race may be decided on 
the Champs Elysees. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Roche of Ireland, the 1987 winner; Greg LeMond, who became the first 
American to win in 1986, and Laurent Fignon of France, a two-time winner, are 
looking for another chance to wear the leader's yellow jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Delgado's win was tainted when a drug test midway through the race found traces 
of probenicid, which can be used to mask steroids. He was not penalized, 
because probenicid was not then on the International Cycling Union's list of 
banned substances. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Hampsten, who finished third in the Tour of Italy, is perhaps America's 
best hope to win. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond has had trouble since coming back from a gunshot wound he suffered in a 
hunting accident. He was far back in the Tour of Italy, although he made a 
promising effort in the final time trial. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Fignon, the French are rooting for Charlie Mottet, ranked No. 1 on 
recent performances. 
</P>
<P>
A promising newcomer is Miguel Indurain, 25, of Spain, who got off to a fast 
start this year by winning the Paris-to-Nice race. 
</P>
<P>
Others who could make a challenge for the $220,000 first prize include Luis 
Herrera of Colombia, Steven Rooks of the Netherlands and Sean Kelly of Ireland.

BOYDSTON STAYS WITHIN 6 SHOTS; BEARD TAKES SENIOR LEAD 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fog arrived early Friday, delaying the start of the second round of the 
U.S. Senior Open at Laurel Valley Golf Course -- and prolonging amateur Frank 
Boydston's stay on the leader board. 
</P>
<P>
As Frank Beard took over the lead at the halfway point of the tournament with a 
five-under-par 139, Boydston, only one stroke off the pace after the first 
round, made birdies on Nos. 17 and 18 and finished his round with a 76, four 
over par. 
</P>
<P>
Boydston, the hamburger entrepreneur from Phoenix who shocked the pros with a 
69 in the first round, was six shots off the pace but in much better shape than 
Arnold Palmer, the hometown favorite and host pro. Palmer, still having 
problems with his irons and his putter, shot a 77. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer's 153 qualified him for the final 36 holes but he has little chance to 
score his first victory before his home fans. 
</P>
<P>
Beard, playing in his eighth tournament in nine weeks since he became eligible 
for the Senior PGA Tour, shot a three-under-par 69 in the second round. He led 
Al Geiberger, Bobby Nichols and Don Bies by one stroke. 
</P>
<P>
Bies, the leading money winner in his second season as a senior, is mastering 
the course that Palmer remodeled into a U.S. Open layout, shooting 13 birdies 
thus far. In the opening round, he also had three double bogeys, but Friday he 
was on target, firing a six-under-par 66, one stroke off the tournament record 
held by Miller Barber and Doug Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
Geiberger, the first-round leader with a 68, played a steady 72 on a course 
that is rapidly drying out after having been soggy all week. Nichols had his 
second 70. 
</P>
<P>
As is usual in a U.S. Open, there were only seven golfers under par. Dale 
Douglass is two shots behind Beard at 141. Dave Hill is another shot back and 
Harold Henning, tied with Boydston after the first round, is one under at 143. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Player, seeking a third consecutive Senior Open title, shot a 73 and is 
tied with Boydston. Bob Charles, who complained about the severity of the 
greens, had putting problems and is at 147. 
</P>
<P>
Beard, who lost a playoff two weeks ago and has yet to win as a senior, gave 
credit for his recent improvement to Phil Rodgers, recently recently eligible 
for the tour. Rodgers, a Southern Californian, is renowned for helping fellow 
pros. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't be telling the truth if I didn't say that the main reason I'm here 
is because Phil Rodgers straightened me out," Beard said. "Nobody knows more 
about the golf swing than he does." 
</P>
<P>
While his fellow pros are talking about how you have to play this course 
cautiously, Bies is firing everything at the flag. Even the speeded up greens 
couldn't stop him. 
</P>
<P>
He made two equipment changes in March that changed his game completely. At the 
Vantage in Indian Wells, he changed irons. Later, he switched from a 
conventional putter to one with a 46-inch handle and now he uses the pendulum 
swing that has become so popular with the seniors. 
</P>
<P>
"Never in my life have I hit irons as well as I am now," Bies said. "I was 
hitting the ball so close to the hole that I didn't really have any long putts. 
It was really a fun round. 
</P>
<P>
"Today I missed only one fairway and one green. Yesterday, despite six birdies, 
I missed five greens, lost seven shots on those holes and wound up with a 74." 
</P>
<P>
Bies and Geiberger were together in a threesome playing behind a twosome. They 
started on the back nine when the USGA divided the field, starting half on No. 
1 and the other half on No. 10. 
</P>
<P>
The Geiberger group was called for slow play. It happened with three holes 
remaining and Geiberger was visibly upset. Not Bies, who finished with three 
birdies. 
</P>
<P>
Said Boydston, one of the last to start in the unwieldy field of 150: "Look at 
these people asking for my autograph. Can you believe it? I wonder when it will 
hit me." 
</P>
<P>
Not for another day at least. For the first time in his life, he had a gallery 
of several hundred when he teed off. Some were yelling encouragement. Most 
deserted him after he lost four strokes in seven holes, but he refused to 
collapse and finished strong. He chipped in on the 17th and sank a long putt on 
No. 18. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-five players made the cut at 156, 12 over par. That's the U.S. Open.

ATTACKERS, REPORTERS CAN ATTEST: HIS HARD-HEADED IMAGE WAS REAL

<P>
As Reggie Smith walked to his car after a game late in the 1978 season, two 
toughs attacked him in the nearly deserted Dodger Stadium parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
One of the men broke the window of Smith's car and the other smashed a beer 
bottle over Smith's head. 
</P>
<P>
"People always told me I had a hard head," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Enraged, Smith fought back. He mopped up the parking lot with his assailants, 
sending them to the hospital. And after they had recovered, they were found 
guilty of assault. 
</P>
<P>
The two men had learned, as many others had, that it wasn't wise to challenge 
Reggie Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was perceived as an angry young man, and he worked hard to maintain that 
image. He snapped at sportswriters and fought with his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"(Sportswriters) created an image for me, and I tried to live up to it for the 
sake of gaining an advantage," Smith said. "It probably cost me popularity, but 
I never really cared about that. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I needed to put up a wall around myself to get ready to play the game. 
I wasn't an angry man because when I got away from the park I left the ballgame 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"But there weren't too many people who knew me. Those that did laughed (at his 
reputation)." 
</P>
<P>
Smith comes across these days as a mellow fellow. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not playing now and I can be myself," he said. CHRIS BAKER

HE JUDGES ROSE -- FROM EXPERIENCE; 
</P>
<P>
DENNY MCLAIN IS SADDENED BY TESTIMONY ON GAMBLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN LE BATARD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Denny McLain, ex-pitcher and ex-con, spoke from the heart Friday when 
discussing Pete Rose, the embattled Cincinnati Reds manager who faces a 
possible lifetime ban from baseball for allegedly betting on his team. 
</P>
<P>
Nineteen years ago, as a member of the Detroit Tigers, McLain was suspended by 
Bowie Kuhn, the then-rookie baseball commissioner, for associating with 
gamblers. Later, he served 29 months of a 23-year prison sentence for 
racketeering, extortion, conspiracy and cocaine possession. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult for us to be judgmental, especially me," McLain says 
softly, "but if he's done what everyone says he has, he'll have to face the 
consequences. He's in serious trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"It's such a tragedy. I am terribly concerned for him, but I feel even worse 
for his family. They are suffering in silence. It is time to get this over 
with. Enough is enough." 
</P>
<P>
McLain, in town to do the Pat Sajak Show, has become something of a spokesman 
on gambling, doing several interviews a day and appearing on Nightline twice 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
McLain was suspended from Feb. 19 until July 1, 1970, after a 40-minute 
conversation with Kuhn, during which he admitted he had bet on basketball, 
hockey and football. He denies ever betting on baseball. It's too tough a sport 
to bet on accurately, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what Rose's chances would be if he had to appear before Kuhn, McLain's 
response is as sharp and hard as one of his fastballs. "Chopped liver," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
McLain is not a close friend of Rose and hasn't seen him since the day before 
the 1988 Super Bowl. They had dinner together, along with Paul Janszen and Mike 
Bertolini, who are principle accusers of Rose in Commissioner Bart Giamatti's 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The dinner, mentioned in a report by John M. Dowd, who conducted the 
investigation for the commissioner's office, was also mentioned in a phone call 
between Janszen and Bertolini, taped by Janszen. McLain said the dinner 
conversation included speculation about the Super Bowl but not about gambling. 
McLain did say, however, that he talked about some of his prison experiences 
with Rose. 
</P>
<P>
McLain, the last 30-game winner in the major leagues (in 1968), does not 
question the credibility of Janszen, Bertolini or Ron Peters, another Rose 
accuser. 
</P>
<P>
"Credibility isn't the question,' McLain says. "It's the voluminous amount of 
testimony. Take out those guys and there are 10 more willing to testify. Of 
course, he (the commissioner) would love to have a Father O'Reilly testify, but 
those guys (Peters and Janszen) hate each other and still tell the same story. 
Peters was set up by Janszen in a cocaine deal and they still gave the same 
testimony." 
</P>
<P>
McLain, host of a radio show in Detroit, has skimmed through about 900 pages of 
the complete 2,000-page report on Rose (the 225-page report is a condensed 
version) and says that the evidence is "overwhelming" and "unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
He is asked if he questions Rose's intelligence. "He was probably the greatest 
player ever to play the game," McLain says, leaving it at that. 
</P>
<P>
According to McLain, "there is no question" Rose will get some sort of 
suspension, but he declined to speculate as to length. He says he is almost 
certain that Rose will stay out of the commissioner's office through a plea 
bargain, but adds that "baseball is the least of his problems. They've got a 
huge federal grand jury in Cincinnati looking into income-tax evasion." 
</P>
<P>
McLain believes that baseball fans aren't too concerned about that. They want 
to know if Rose bet on baseball, or worse, if he bet on his team. 
</P>

CHALLENGE TO FIRST EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL DELUGACH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chairman Fred Carr of First Executive Corp. weathered a substantial challenge 
from two stockholder proposals Friday at the firm's annual meeting. The Los 
Angeles insurance holding company simultaneously announced a proposed 
$250-million public rights offering to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Some major institutional investors obviously backed the shareholder proposals 
and others withheld their votes, but pro-management voters defeated them. 
</P>
<P>
Although the company has a reputation as a leader in the U.S. insurance 
industry, management has received fallout from unfavorable news about Carr's 
close business ties to indicted "junk bond" king Michael Milken, who recently 
quit Drexel Burnham Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, despite the close vote, no one at the meeting took the floor to discuss 
the proposals before the balloting. 
</P>
<P>
The tally showed that of the 56 million shares voted, only 27 million (48%) 
supported Carr's position against a proposal to create a seven-member committee 
of major shareholders to advise the company's board. 
</P>
<P>
However, the proponents only garnered 21.3 million yes votes as the balance of 
7.7 million abstained. 
</P>
<P>
The other proposal, which could have made it easier for someone to acquire the 
company, was defeated with a pro-Carr vote of 29.6 million (53%). A total of 
18.3 million voted in favor and 8.1 million shares abstained. 
</P>
<P>
If that proposal had passed, First Executive directors would have waived the 
company's rights under a five-year "standstill" agreement dated Nov. 9, 1987, 
that restricts ICH Corp. from increasing or disposing of its 16 million First 
Executive shares, a 20% stake. ICH, a Louisville-based insurance holding 
company, has been a Carr backer. 
</P>
<P>
Three other institutions have First Executive holdings of more than 7 million 
shares. One of them, Dallas-based Rosewood Financial Partners, has been 
considered a potential suitor and indicated that it would vote for the two 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
The vote suggested that two institutions voted against management's 
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, beaming over the enthusiastic applause from the crowd at the 
meeting, Carr shrugged off the closeness of the vote, saying: "Shareholder 
democracy -- it's terrific." 
</P>
<P>
He told the session that the stock rights offering, on which the company 
submitted a prospectus Friday to the Securities and Exchange Commission, is a 
way of transferring value to its shareholders as well as raising capital. 
</P>
<P>
The offering provides that, for each share in the company, a First Executive 
stockholder may acquire a package consisting of one share of convertible 
preference stock and two stock warrants for $15 per package. 
</P>
<P>
He said he expected that a public market in the rights would provide 
"substantial" value to the shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Two investment bankers, Drexel and Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., are to underwrite 
the sale of the packages, called units.

Fixed Mortgage Rates Keep Dipping: Thirty-year fixed-rate home mortgages are 
averaging 10.07%, according to a national survey released by the Federal Home 
Loan Mortgage Corp. That rate was down from a rate of 10.19% last week. 
Adjustable-rate mortgages averaged 8.92%, down from 9.0% last week. The 
fixed-rate average is for a 30-year loan covering 80% of a home's cost. The 
average adjustable-rate mortgage also is for 30 years but for 75% of the home 
price.

Bond Appeals Panel's Ruling: Lawyers for Australian millionaire Alan Bond 
appealed a tribunal's ruling that said he was unfit to run his nationwide media 
network. Bond Media, which runs radio and television stations, applied to the 
Federal Court to overturn a ruling by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal that 
Bond is "not fit and proper" to have a broadcasting license. The ruling, due in 
part to Alan Bond's negotiation of a large defamation settlement with a leading 
politician and his alleged attempts to cover up that payment, could force the 
divestment of a network bought for more than $750 million.

Higher Bid for Gateway Corp.: A group headed by Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co. 
has raised its bid for the British food store chain Gateway Corp. by $71 
million in an effort to defeat an offer from rival Isosceles PLC. The New York 
investment firm and its partner, Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., offered 
$3.75 a share, up from $3.67. The new offer is worth about $3.34 billion. The 
bidders, operating under the name Newgateway, said this was their final offer. 
While the bid exceeds the $3.56-a-share cash portion of the Isosceles' offer, 
it falls short of the $3.79 to $3.87 a share that Isosceles' advisers claim 
their cash-and-stock bid is worth.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: QUAKE INSURANCE RATTLES POCKETBOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Carla Lazzareschi 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: Last month's temblors have us again -- thinking about getting some 
earthquake insurance. But we're still not convinced that we really need it. Can 
you help us make up our minds by giving us an idea of what it will cost and 
what we will actually be getting? Our home is our single largest investment so 
we want to do the right thing. J. L. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: First, you should know that earthquake coverage for your house and its 
contents is not included in the standard homeowner's policy. If you want it, 
you must pay extra. And it is expensive. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Insurance Information Institute, a trade association in San 
Francisco, most insurance companies charge $2 to $4 a year for each $1,000 
worth of protection. This means that to insure a house for $300,000, you will 
have to spend between $600 and $1,200 a year in addition to your regular 
homeowner's insurance premium. Your actual charges will vary according to the 
age of your house, its size and number of levels, the type of construction used 
to build it and its proximity to an earthquake fault line. 
</P>
<P>
Your should first call your insurance agent or the company issuing your 
homeowner's or renter's policy. Some insurance companies offer "riders" as 
additions to the regular policy for specific occurances, such as earthquakes. 
If this is the case, you may be able to get a more favorable rate from your 
existing insurance carrier. 
</P>
<P>
What kind of protection do you receive for the rather large earthquake 
premiums? Typically, earthquake policies have a 10% deductible, which means 
that you receive no payment for the first $30,000 of damage on a policy with 
$300,000 of coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Most policies also apply a separate 10% deductible to contents of the house. So 
if the contents are insured at $100,000, you would not be reimbursed for the 
first $10,000 worth of damage. In all, the homeowner in the above example would 
not be covered for a total of $40,000 worth of damage. 
</P>
<P>
So why get it, you ask? Consumer advocates say earthquake insurance should be 
viewed as protection against a major financial disaster for your family. If you 
did not have earthquake insurance and your home were destroyed in a quake, you 
might face financial ruin. 
</P>
<P>
Earthquake insurance, like any other type of catastrophic insurance, should 
spare you this. In fact, the insurance offers its greatest coverage the greater 
your problems are. For example, if your $300,000 house were to sustain $50,000 
worth of damage from a quake, you would typically be covered for $20,000 after 
putting up the 10% deductible. But if the damage were $100,000, earthquake 
insurance would cover $70,000, a much higher percentage of the loss. 
</P>
<P>
Until 1985, when the state Legislature required insurance companies in 
California to offer earthquake insurance with new homeowner policies, only a 
handful of homeowners had the coverage. More recently -- and especially since 
the Oct. 1, 1987, quake that rocked Southern California, as many as 20% of 
households are estimated to be covered. 
</P>
<P>
However, be advised: Most insurance companies have what they call a "magnitude 
policy." Under this, companies refuse to write new earthquake insurance 
policies for a certain period of time after earthquakes of a particular 
magnitude. Moratorium periods and the magnitude levels triggering them vary by 
company. According to the Insurance Information Institute, this requirement is 
aimed at preventing the writing of new policies while the possibility of 
aftershocks still exists. 
</P>
<P>
You should also know that you may not need special earthquake insurance to have 
at least some coverage for damage caused by a quake. For instance, fires that 
occur as the result of a quake can be covered under the normal fire insurance 
portion of the homeowner's or renter's policy. A car damaged because a tree 
falls as a result of a temblor can be covered by the comprehensive portion of 
car insurance. 
</P>

'Bite the Bullet' on Taxes From Home Sale 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am one of those people cashing out of the California real estate market 
and moving to the Midwest. We expect to sell our house here for about $500,000 
and buy a house there in the $200,000 range. Based on what we paid for and put 
into our current house, our accountant tells us that we could realize a taxable 
gain of perhaps $170,000 on the sale and face federal and California taxes 
totaling about $67,000. 
</P>
<P>
Besides buying a more expensive house in the Midwest, which we want to avoid, 
what can we do to shield some of that gain from the tax man? Could we, for 
example, lend some of it to the buyer of our California house? D. W. 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, you could make a loan to the buyer of your house, and yes, that loan 
would forestall the tax consequences of your purchase of a less expensive house 
in the Midwest. But a delay is the most you could expect from making the loan. 
Your tax obligation is never going to be erased, and our tax advisers say that 
deferring your tax payment actually could leave you exposed to a higher tax 
bill should Congress increase tax rates. 
</P>
<P>
According to the personal finance advisers we consulted, making a loan to the 
buyers of your house probably doesn't make a lot of sense for you, given the 
possibility that tax rates will be increased. Unless you're close to age 55, at 
which point you can take advantage of the one-time tax sheltering of $125,000 
in profits on your personal residence, the consultants' advice is to "bite the 
bullet" and get on with your new life in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moving IRAs From Failed S&amp;L Often Easy 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have individual retirement accounts in several savings and loan 
institutions and am increasingly concerned about the solvency of these 
institutions. If one of the institutions where I have an account fails and the 
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. pays off depositors, how would the 
Internal Revenue Service treat this payment? Would it be treated as a 
withdrawal and subject to income taxes and early withdrawal penalties, or would 
I have a chance to roll it over into another IRA? J. A. W. 
</P>
<P>
A: We sure hope you haven't been losing any sleep over this issue because your 
IRA investment, as long as it is in an FSLIC-insured institution and you have 
no more than $100,000 in any one association, should be well protected in the 
event of an S&amp;L failure. 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, in the majority of S&amp;L closings, deposits are passed along 
to the new owners of the institution with no interruption in service to the 
account holder. In fact, except for being notified of the change of ownership, 
you are unlikely to know the difference. 
</P>
<P>
However, in the event your S&amp;L is liquidated and you receive a FSLIC 
insurance payoff, you have 60 days in which to reinvest the funds in another 
IRA without penalty. As far as the IRS is concerned, the insurance payment is 
treated as though you voluntarily decided to withdraw the IRA from one 
institution and move it to another. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, you could suffer some inconveniences in the event your association 
is liquidated. For one, you may not be able to reinvest your funds in an 
account paying as much interest as you had been receiving. Furthermore, you 
would have to wait another year after reinvesting your funds to move them a 
second time. However, these restrictions would probably seem inconsequential 
after having survived a S&amp;L failure with your account intact.

STATE DEFENDS ROLE IN SALE OF 'JUNK BONDS'; 
</P>
<P>
SAYS IT TRIED TO STOP ISSUE BY LINCOLN S&amp;L PARENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
California thrift regulators said Friday that they tried last year to halt the 
sale of a second issue of "junk bonds" by the parent company of Irvine-based 
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan but that the state had no choice other than to 
approve the high-risk offering. 
</P>
<P>
The parent firm, American Continental Corp. of Phoenix, sold the bonds through 
Lincoln branches. Many were bought by unsophisticated investors who say they 
were given the impression that their investments in the bonds were insured or 
had some equivalent protection. 
</P>
<P>
"We expressed our concerns to members of the Department of Corporations (which 
reviews the sale of securities in California), but according to the law under 
which they operate, they did not have a basis for denying approval," William B. 
Davis, chief deputy commissioner of the State Department of Savings and Loan, 
said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heavily Investigated 
</P>
<P>
"When we first heard (American Continental's) ads, we became concerned," Davis 
said. "They were selling what we considered fairly high-risk investments, but 
the inference from the ads was, 'Come into a Lincoln office.' We could 
immediately see the confusion investors might have between a risky investment 
and a safer one." 
</P>
<P>
The company's offering in 1988 -- the second of two that raised a total of $200 
million for the firm -- was one of the "most investigated" offerings in some 
time, said Christine W. Bender, commissioner of the Corporations Department. 
The first was approved in late 1986. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental was a healthy company then and had a clean record of 
paying back investors, Bender said. 
</P>
<P>
But on April 13 of this year, American Continental filed for protection from 
creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws. Federal regulators took 
over the operations of Lincoln the following day, saying American Continental 
was operating it in an unsafe manner and was dissipating its $5.3 billion in 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
Likely to lose their investments are about 22,000 people who bought the junk 
bonds. More than a dozen class-action lawsuits have been filed seeking the 
return of the money.

An international agreement that stabilizes world coffee prices could fall apart 
at last ditch talks Monday, leaving the commodity at the mercy of a free market 
in which prices are likely to tumble. 
</P>
<P>
Low prices would squeeze debt-laden Third World producers but might eventually 
mean a cut in supermarket prices for coffee drinkers, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
More than a year of negotiations have failed to bridge a wide gulf between 
Brazil, the biggest producer, and the United States, the largest consumer, over 
how to continue a price support pact that regulates 90% of world coffee trade. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the dispute is how to stop producers from dumping coffee at 
cheap prices in countries outside the 74-nation pact. 
</P>
<P>
Talks Monday at the International Coffee Organization, or ICO, in London 
represent a last-ditch attempt to rescue the accord, which expires in 
September. The last round of talks collapsed earlier in June.

L .F. ROTHSCHILD HOLDINGS SEEKS BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
L. F. Rothschild Holdings, parent of a once-venerated Wall Street investment 
firm that suffered staggering losses from the 1987 stock market collapse, 
sought Friday to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
</P>
<P>
The filing for protection from creditors does not include L. F. Rothschild 
&amp; Co., a registered broker-dealer that is Rothschild Holdings' principal 
subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Rothschild Holdings, which lost $84 million in the quarter ended March 31, is 
in default on three debt issues totaling $60 million and wants to restructure 
its debt to reduce interest expenses, according to spokesman Kenneth Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the Rothschild Co. brokerage said it intends to re-enter the retail 
business with a discount operation pitting the firm against such bigger 
discount brokers as Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Rothschild Co., once a leader in public stock offerings for high-tech 
companies, will also continue to offer corporate finance and investment banking 
services with a greater focus on "middle-market and smaller capitalized 
companies." 
</P>
<P>
Rothschild Holdings filed its Chapter 11 petition with the Bankruptcy Court for 
the Southern District of New York in Manhattan. Henderson said the company soon 
would file its reorganization plan, which includes the swapping of existing 
debt for zero-coupon debt to cut current interest expenses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Much Smaller Firm 
</P>
<P>
The company's board said that while the move may affect the firm adversely in 
the short term, "following a successful reorganization . . . Rothschild will be 
better positioned" to expand its business through the brokerage arm and 
ultimately become profitable. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson said Rothschild Co. has "a large number of deals in the works" mostly 
involving mergers and acquisitions and leveraged buyouts, but he could not 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
With 75 employees, the current Rothschild is a shadow of the old-line 
investment house and full-service brokerage that employed as many as 2,200 
people before the Oct. 19, 1987, stock market crash. 
</P>
<P>
Rothschild was formed in 1899 as L. F. Rothschild &amp; Co. In 1977, it merged 
with C. E. Unterberg Towbin Co., then a young investment boutique. But 
management strife forced out partners A. Robert Towbin and Thomas Unterberg 
shortly after the company went public in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
As of Jan. 1, 1987, Rothschild ranked as the 18th-largest U.S. securities firm 
with capital of $289 million. But by the end of the year, Rothschild posted a 
$129-million annual loss, $56 million of which resulted from arbitrage and 
over-the-counter trading positions held during the Black Monday crash. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to rebound and slash fixed costs, Rothschild systematically sold 
or abandoned its retail brokerage, public finance and municipal bond sales and 
trading operations. It also ceased over-the-counter market making, arbitrage 
and the selling and trading of mortgage-backed and high-grade corporate 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
The firm, which in late 1986 became one of just 40 primary dealers that could 
buy and sell government securities as both principals and agents, left that 
business in January. 
</P>
<P>
"The object . . . in the recent past is to reduce operations and be as 
efficient as possible and go into businesses with . . . the lowest overhead," 
Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Rothschild Holdings became a subsidiary of Franklin Financial 
Services, a services company that itself is a unit of Ottawa, Kan.-based 
Franklin Savings Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the brokerage business's plans to offer discount brokerage services, 
Henderson said, "We're aware that it is a very competitive business. But we do 
have customer lists from our old retail operations and can rely on the 
Rothschild name." 
</P>
<P>
Except for advertising, the cost of setting up discount brokerage operations 
will be minimal, Henderson said. Back-office operations, which he described as 
the heaviest contributor to overhead, will be handled by another firm.

FACES . . .: MILQUETOAST TO BULLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"My biggest problem is that he was quite milquetoast," says Carl Lumbly, 
recalling his good-guy role as Det. Marcus Petrie on "Cagney &amp; Lacey." It's 
hardly a factor in his current part. In the 1927-set "Eden" (at the Los Angeles 
Theatre Center), Lumbly pulls out the stops as West Indian patriarch Joseph 
Barton, a bullying, battering separationist who blames American blacks for the 
disintegration of racial purity. 
</P>
<P>
The actor, who originally played the role in 1980, is finding the reprisal a 
tough one. 
</P>
<P>
"This man has made me feel old," he says. "Before I had all that youthful 
energy. It didn't seem to go as deeply as it does now. Certain things in life 
take you to a deeper place. I wasn't a father then, and my (Jamaican) father 
was still alive. This time, I see Mr. Barton's brutality and single-mindedness 
as less tyrannical, born of fear and hope. I love him a lot more. Of course," 
he says, laughing. "It's my job to love him." 
</P>
<P>
Since the 1988 cancellation of "Cagney &amp; Lacey," Lumbly credits 1-year-old 
son Brandon (mom is actress Vonetta McGee) with providing the constancy in his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"Not my work life," he says. "But that's OK. There were parts of the series, 
though it was consistent, that it was not really regular -- when you were there 
simply to be counted. I think the strength of the show was definitely the two 
women; the stories almost always had to come from that point of view. If I were 
to criticize, I'd say we could've been more effectively woven into their lives 
in the precinct. But I don't think the show suffered from that at all." 
</P>
<P>
Being off a series has freed Lumbly up to do lot of other work (including the 
films "Bedroom Window" and "Everybody's All-American") -- and also freed him 
from a weekly paycheck. "You do get used to that," he admits. "But I feel 
pretty fortunate. And certainly in this business, (regular work is) an 
exception. Those five years were quite sweet. But there's a part of me that 
never really believed it was happening anyway. It feels like winning the 
lottery." JANICE ARKATOV

FACES . . .: DOUBLE LIFE OF A SKATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIBBY SLATE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For most of her 20 years, Katherine Healy has led a double life. In 1983 at age 
14, she became the first U.S.-born ballerina and the youngest dancer ever to 
win a Gold Medal at the prestigious International Ballet Competition of Varna, 
Bulgaria. She has performed extensively in Europe and Japan, and even before 
her victory had worked with such greats as George Balanchine and Jacques 
D'Amboise. 
</P>
<P>
Since she was 10, Healy has also been a professional figure skater, appearing 
in ice shows with established skaters. She made her solo debut at 6 as the 
protege of 1976 Olympic champion John Curry in a Madison Square Garden 
exhibition, and at 9 was the subject of photographer Jill Krementz's book "A 
Very Young Skater." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday night Healy will display both talents in "Star Spangled Ice," a 
cabaret-style ice show starring 1980 Olympic champion Robin Cousins and other 
world-class skaters at the International Training Center in Blue Jay, near Lake 
Arrowhead. The show benefits the International Foundation for the Advancement 
of Ice Skating. 
</P>
<P>
Having discovered both endeavors at age 3, the New York-born performer now 
spends more time en pointe than on ice. 
</P>
<P>
"Ballet is my priority, my native language," she says. "It's shaped me and 
defined my style. But I'm a big skating fan, and I've been fortunate in that 
people ask me to do these shows." 
</P>
<P>
All serious figure skaters study ballet for its artistic merits, but how does 
the sport benefit Healy's dancing? 
</P>
<P>
"It gives me stamina and brute physical strength," she says. "I specialize in 
the bravura ballets, so jumping and stroking really help the muscles." 
</P>
<P>
After spending two years as a principal with the London Festival Ballet, Healy 
now free-lances as a guest artist and attends Princeton University, where she 
is a senior art history major. Her post-graduation plans are "rather vague," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
"I may join a ballet company, but not if it means giving up skating. And I'd 
like to act again (she played a dying ballerina in the 1982 film 'Six Weeks')," 
she says. "Ballet is youth-oriented -- people tend to peak at 30 or 35. So I am 
keeping an eye on the time." LIBBY SLATE

FACES . . .: PLAYING WITH 'FIRE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After playing what she calls "the rural slut" and other "angst-ridden 
emotional" roles, Lisa Blount was ready to have some fun. And her newest role, 
as the young mother of Jerry Lee Lewis' 13-year-old wife and cousin in the 
just-released "Great Balls of Fire," provided that opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing I so much enjoyed about (the character of) Lois was that she's so 
very fun-loving. She's so excited about Jerry's success and she's loving it to 
the hilt," said Blount, whose past roles -- such as Debra Winger's calculating 
girlfriend, Lynette, in "An Officer and a Gentleman" -- have included women who 
are anything but positive and uplifting. 
</P>
<P>
But while the young-at-heart, rock 'n'roll-loving Lois was a quite different 
role for Blount, playing her brought back memories of the actress's own 
upbringing. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking of my own mom," she says. "She was young when she had me and 
she also enjoyed rock 'n' roll. . . . I remember listening to the old folks -- 
who were all of about 20 -- rockin' and boppin' in the living room." 
</P>
<P>
And while Lois and the other "Great Balls of Fire" characters are from Memphis, 
Tenn., Blount hails from the nearby area of Little Rock, Ark. That factor made 
her the perfect dialect coach for much of the cast. 
</P>
<P>
"It just so happens that this (story) was from my place," said Blount, who 
worked extensively with co-star Winona Ryder (who plays her daughter, Myra) on 
such language aspects as cadence, phrasing, pronunciation and Southern 
colloquialisms. Her Southern background even enabled her to contribute some of 
her own phrases to the film script. 
</P>
<P>
But the "Great Balls of Fire" role was not merely a homecoming in terms of her 
return to the South. Blount said she also felt nostalgic about once again 
sharing the screen with Dennis Quaid (who plays Lewis) -- they worked together 
in 1976 in her very first movie, "9-30-55." SHAUNA SNOW

POP MUSIC REVIEWS: THE T'S HAVE IT IN RAP NIGHT AT THE PALACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was T time at the Palace on Thursday night, a celebration of the many T's in 
the world of rap. Howie T, Toddy T, Sweet Tee, Grandmaster D.S.T. and T La Rock 
weren't scheduled -- Ice Cream T was, but she didn't show up -- so the Palace 
crowd had to settle for T for two: local rappers Ice-T and King T. 
</P>
<P>
Not that long ago, in the brief period between high-energy rap and the 
ascendancy of gangster-chic, Ice-T was the best-known rapper on the West Coast, 
and his canny blend of raw Bronx-style rhyming and slick L.A. production made 
him an underground rap hit. Where Easterners Melle Mel and Run-D.M.C. may have 
occasionally rapped about desolation in general, he celebrated the rough beauty 
of violence as one who had seen it, and his hard-core reputation was enough to 
make him a credible anti-drug, anti-violence spokesman among gangsters 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
These days, outslicked by MC Hammer and outgunned by N.W.A, Ice-T seems 
determined to become the Redd Foxx of rap, the guy who leers through songs like 
"Sex" and "LGBNAF", sometimes like that sort of man who persists in telling 
dirty jokes at a party whether anybody laughs or not. Some new songs, performed 
here for the first time, have awesomely danceable, Public Enemy-inspired beats 
but betray the same obsession with the puerile. 
</P>
<P>
There are no giant Uzis in Ice-T's show these days, no visible weaponry save 
the pistol medallion slung around his neck on a fat gold chain, but at least a 
dozen people were on stage with him, most folding their arms on their chest and 
glowering. He rapped into a headset he'd hidden under his hat, which tended to 
make his show even less focused than it had been earlier this year -- though 
he's never sounded better. 
</P>
<P>
Though opener King T is an enormously appealing young hardcore rapper -- he 
clearly loved it on stage, striding about and brandishing a contraband can of 
the malt liquor he endorses -- and his deejay, Pooh, is among the best 
scratchers around, he's still relatively new to the large stage. Give him 
another year. JONATHAN GOLD

LAGUNA GREETS SUMMER WITH ARTS-BY-THE-SEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Suffering for art's sake" takes on a whole new meaning when you think of what 
9-year-old Kelle O'Donnell has to go through for her role in the 1989 Pageant 
of the Masters in Laguna Beach, Friday to Aug. 27. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a special safety belt because I'm the highest," says Kelle, whose perch 
is 20 feet above the stage on a cushion atop a narrow board. "You have to kneel 
down and kind of push your stomach forward and you've got to squeeze your arm 
in and then put your other arm out and look to the side. It's not that hard, 
but it's uncomfortable." 
</P>
<P>
What Kelle is doing is inserting the top half of her body through a huge 
re-creation of "Matsukaze," a Japanese print, as she becomes part of a living 
tableau. Heavy makeup, a headpiece and the top half of a costume will transform 
Kelle, who lives in Mission Viejo, into an elegant Japanese woman. 
</P>
<P>
The Pageant of the Masters is one of four major summer art events in Laguna 
Beach. The others are Festival of Arts, the Sawdust Festival and Art-A-Fair. 
</P>
<P>
The most widely known is the pageant, which for more than 50 years has used 
actors, elaborate sets, special lighting, gallons of makeup and hundreds of 
yards of fabric to create life-size versions of actual works of art. 
</P>
<P>
The pageant often is a family activity. Kelle's sister Meghan, 8, appears in 
"Egyptian Necklace" and brother Ryan, 10, is in Currier &amp; Ives' "Winter 
Wonderland." The O'Donnells are one of 13 families devoting their summer to the 
presentation of 60 living works of art in the pageant, which uses alternating 
casts of more than 100 each. 
</P>
<P>
Children are in demand because they fit more easily into some of the sets. In 
fact, sets are built and then people are cast to fit the sets. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets are $9 to $35. Veterans of this event will appreciate the new 
individual seats in the Irvine Bowl, at 650 Laguna Canyon Road, where the 
pageant is presented each evening. 
</P>
<P>
The annual Festival of Arts runs concurrently on the six acres surrounding the 
bowl. Hours are 10 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. daily. This juried show features 160 
exhibitors of paintings, drawings, serigraphs, sculpture, ceramics, 
photographs, etched and stained glass, leather work, furniture, jewelry and 
even model ships. Admission is $2 for adults, $1 for ages 65 and older, free to 
children 12 and under. For information on the festival or pageant, call (714) 
494-1145. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Colorful Booths Inside 
</P>
<P>
Art-A-Fair at 777 Laguna Canyon Road, today to Aug. 27, sports a new stucco 
facade with a contemporary flair; inside, zigzagged rows of colorful booths 
showcase oil paintings, stone sculptures, bronzes, ceramics, porcelains, 
Chinese brush painting, photography, embossed prints and etchings. 
Entertainment and special demonstrations are also scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
The show is juried, which means artists have to attain a certain level of 
achievement to be included. 
</P>
<P>
Red Skelton's clown oil paintings and limited-edition prints will be among the 
work of the more than 160 artists in Art-A-Fair. 
</P>
<P>
A 25-foot kaleidoscope with two stained-glass wheels measuring 14 feet in 
diameter is a new attraction. This ambitious undertaking is the creation of 
Kathleen Marvin and Anita Livingston of Fantasia Stained Glass in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"Each (stained-glass) wheel will weigh about 800 pounds," Marvin says, "so we 
had a lot of engineering problems to solve. I've learned more about bearings 
than I ever wanted to know." 
</P>
<P>
The giant kaleidoscope is a triangular tunnel lined with mirrors that reflect 
swirling stained-glass patterns created when a motor turns the wheels. Marvin 
also hopes to add a laser to the installation to create additional special 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
Art-A-Fair also offers an opportunity to purchase and glaze a piece of ceramic 
that will then be fired to a glossy texture in a kiln. 
</P>
<P>
Another booth features the Rocky Mountain Foundry -- on July 22-23 and 28-30 
only -- and people can purchase blocks of wax, sculpt them and have them cast 
in bronze. 
</P>
<P>
Admission to Art-A-Fair is $3.50 for adults, $2.50 for people 62 and older. 
Children under 12 are free. Hours are 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday-Thursday and 10 
a.m. to 1 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays. Information: (714) 494-4514. 
</P>
<P>
The Sawdust Festival, 935 Laguna Canyon Road, is a non-juried show (today to 
Aug. 27) featuring only Laguna artists, and is known for its whimsical nature. 
The biggest change this year is the new permanent facade, which is as eclectic 
as the festival itself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
California Bungalow Style 
</P>
<P>
Rough shingles cover most of the exterior, which is accented with glass bricks 
and a bay window. 
</P>
<P>
"It's patterned after the Greene and Greene architectural style, which has also 
been described as California bungalow," says Tina Arana, director of marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, more than 200 artists have built their booths to themes of their own 
choosing, which is part of the festival's charm. Discovery is part of the 
adventure too. 
</P>
<P>
"Our grounds are laid out in a maze or a puzzle," Arana says, and finding your 
way is "part of the fun." 
</P>
<P>
Arts and crafts on display include: glass, portraits, homemade paper art, 
painting, clay art, jewelry, glass blowing, clothing, watercolor portraits, 
ceramics, silk screens, toys, games, quilts, masks, neon, baskets, musical 
instruments and more. 
</P>
<P>
Strolling minstrels will play bluegrass, country, jazz, Mexican and Caribbean 
music. Mimes, jugglers and magicians also will perform. Hours are 10 a.m. to 10 
p.m. Sunday-Thursday and 10 a.m to 11 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays. Admission is 
$4; $3 for people 62 and older; free to children 12 and younger. Call (714) 
494-3030 for information. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Toughest Part 
</P>
<P>
The biggest challenge, however, is parking. Everyone acknowledges parking is a 
problem in Laguna, but there are a few ways to beat the hassles. 
</P>
<P>
Parking is available north of the festivals in the Act V parking lot on Laguna 
Canyon Road and at Laguna Beach High School. A shuttle bus is $2.50 for an 
unlimited pass or 75 cents one way. 
</P>
<P>
Try arriving before 10:30 a.m weekdays and before 10 a.m. on weekends, 
strolling to the festival area after a nice breakfast in town or attending on a 
weekday evening. 
</P>
<P>
People who plan to use the parking meters along Laguna Canyon Road and downtown 
should come armed with fists full of quarters, because one quarter buys only 15 
minutes of parking.

PETITE OLEANDERS: EVERGREEN DROUGHT-TOLERANT DWARF SHRUBS WITH SHOWY FLOWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
You can't live in California and not know an oleander when you see one, so 
ubiquitous is the shrub that grows happily along the highways and in row upon 
row on median strips. 
</P>
<P>
With its long, leathery olive-green leaves and clusters of pink or white 
flowers, it is perfectly suited to such disenfranchised environments -- it 
takes any kind of soil, can be overwatered and underwatered, and tolerates the 
salt buildup usually associated with dry soils. And it will bloom all year just 
the same. 
</P>
<P>
A standard oleander grows 15 to 20 feet tall, which makes it much too monstrous 
for some garden settings. About 20 years ago, samples of dwarf oleanders were 
collected and brought back from Kenya by the late Maurice Machris, a 
horticulturist by hobby who planted them in his Bel-Air garden. Later, he gave 
cuttings to the Los Angeles State and County Arboretum, where they were tested 
and then released to the nursery trade. 
</P>
<P>
"Petite Pink" and "Petite Salmon," as they are called, are rounded in form. 
"Petite Pink" grows to about 6 feet and has single, light-pink flowers. "Petite 
Salmon" has flowers that are a peach pink, and it grows to about 4 feet with a 
more compact appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Plant in full sun in the spring or fall, making a basin around the foot of each 
plant. Water deeply and infrequently. Prune to keep the shape and size you 
want; it can be pruned to 3 or 4 feet. The best time to prune oleanders is 
during Santa Ana winds: The plants are subject to bacterial gall and branches 
will callous over more quickly in the heat, preventing infection. 
</P>
<P>
One caveat: All parts of the oleander are poisonous. Symptoms include nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea and irregular heartbeat. Don't burn the plant or use it to 
skewer meat for barbecues. Ingestion is not necessarily fatal, and only three 
deaths in California have been recorded. The most recent fatality, this year, 
was called a homicide. 
</P>
<P>
Available in 1- and 5-gallon cans, petite oleanders can be ordered by nurseries 
through Monrovia Nursery Co. in Azusa and El Modeno Gardens in Irvine, among 
many others. LINDA FRENCH

Two Sunday concerts offer old-fashioned family outings that could easily turn 
into picnics-in-the-park. Ambitious families might catch a bit of both free 
events. 
</P>
<P>
The concert at Peter Strauss Ranch begins at 2 p.m. in the park amphitheater 
with Deirdre Mary Gibbons singing Irish songs. She is followed by the Avaz, a 
folk music and dance ensemble with a dozen dancers, singers and musicians. 
</P>
<P>
The ranch is at 30000 Mulholland Highway and can be reached by taking U.S. 101 
to the Kanan Road exit south. Turn left on Troutdale Road, left again at 
Mulholland to the parking lot. Information: (818) 888-3770. 
</P>
<P>
A few miles away, at Warner Park in Woodland Hills, the 15th Air Force Band of 
the Golden West will strike up the music at 5:30 p.m. for a sunset concert. 
This concert, one in a weekly summer series, is presented by the Valley 
Cultural Center and City Councilwoman Joy Picus. Warner Park is at 5800 Topanga 
Canyon Blvd., Woodland Hills. Information: (818) 704-1358.

For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen: 
</P>
<P>
Feed vegetables periodically with a mild, balanced fertilizer for bigger and 
better harvests. 
</P>
<P>
Many insects are at their peak during hot weather. Consult a nurseryman for 
tips on controlling aphids, cutworms, white flies, ants, earwigs and snails. 
</P>

If berry vines have finished producing, cut off the old canes that bore fruit 
this year and loosely twine new growth onto the trellis.

<P>
Now is an excellent time to plant almost anything from containers or flats, 
just don't let the plants dry out before or after planting. A little Vitamin 
B-1 will help them overcome the transplanting shock.

PALM DESERT PROJECT WENT BANKRUPT; 
</P>
<P>
HUD AIDED PLAN TO SELL THE POOR $85,000 CONDOS

Philip Drell wondered why the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 
which is supposed to promote affordable housing, was subsidizing a luxury 
country club and condominium development in the California desert a few miles 
from Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
"We always thought it was a curious sort of project for HUD to be involved in," 
Drell, senior planner with the City of Palm Desert, said in an interview 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Congress wondered the same thing. In 1983, then-Sen. William 
Proxmire (D-Wis.) asked HUD whether a project in which condominiums for 
low-income families cost $85,000 and $15 million was being spent for a golf 
course and clubhouse met its affordable housing guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, HUD announced that it planned to terminate the loan guarantee 
program under which the project had been subsidized, a program that has 
guaranteed $500 million in loans in the last 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
HUD Secretary Jack Kemp said the program was "riddled with abuse," had suffered 
enormous losses and had failed to benefit the needy. Kemp, who had been lobbied 
to keep the program alive by a former HUD official who represents developers it 
aided, said losses so far total $90 million. 
</P>
<P>
The guarantee program is the latest chapter in an unfolding saga of 
mismanagement and allegations of favoritism at HUD. 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, Kemp suspended another housing program that was designed to 
renovate buildings for use by moderate-income people after there were charges 
that politically connected consultants had received funding for questionable 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
Consultants were also involved as intermediaries in more than half of the 
projects under the loan guarantee program, called the Title X Land Development 
Mortgage Insurance Program, according to a 1986 report by HUD's inspector 
general. 
</P>
<P>
Title X was established to provide loan guarantees for developers of vacant 
land who might encounter difficulty with local financing. In exchange, the 
developers were supposed to set aside a certain percentage of the units for 
families with low and moderate incomes. 
</P>
<P>
The HUD inspector general's report, obtained under the Freedom of Information 
Act, declared that Title X had failed to accomplish its goal of increasing 
affordable housing. The report said 16 of the 17 projects examined provided no 
housing for moderate-income families, and none offered units for low-income 
families. Half of the 32 projects in the program at the end of 1985 were in 
default, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Housing at Acid Pit Aided 
</P>
<P>
Among the projects that benefited from the program were three housing 
developments near the Stringfellow Acid Pit in Riverside County, which the 
Environmental Protection Agency has categorized as a hazardous waste site. 
Previous reports to HUD had suggested that the ground water in the area near 
the three projects was contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
Singled out for particular criticism in the audit was the Desert Falls Country 
Club project in Palm Desert, which went bankrupt in 1985 and cost HUD $13.6 
million. Since then, the project has come under control of new owners and has 
become successful without government assistance. 
</P>
<P>
According to the HUD report, the project was originally planned to include 
1,111 residential units surrounded by a championship golf course, a 
34,000-square-foot clubhouse, 17 tennis courts and two swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
Drell, the Palm Desert planning official, said the proposal was approved by the 
city in 1979 without any HUD backing. The lead developer was Oscar A. Wiggins, 
who at the time was head of a Santa Ana firm called Pacific Coast Builders. 
</P>
<P>
The project languished for about two years until Palm Desert officials got word 
that HUD was going to guarantee part of the loan to finance the project. The 
guaranteed loan was to be used only to develop the residential units and 
related streets and common areas. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, the developer was required to set aside 20% of the units for 
families with moderate to low incomes. The price for the units was to be 
$75,000, but it later went up to $85,000. 
</P>
<P>
However, HUD's regional office in Los Angeles raised questions in late 1981 
about the eligibility of the project. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than increasing affordable housing, the report said, the project was 
"recreation-resort oriented" and "would not increase the supply of anything 
other than high-priced housing." 
</P>
<P>
The report said the recreational facilities, part of the justification for HUD 
assistance, would be available only to residents who paid a one-time $15,000 
fee and monthly dues. 
</P>
<P>
There were other problems. The environmental impact statement required as part 
of the HUD package uncovered a threat to the fringe-toed lizard, a desert 
resident that became an endangered species in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
According to Drell, the Desert Falls developers tried to satisfy environmental 
concerns by designating the sand traps on the golf course as habitats for the 
lizards. Instead, they were assessed $600 an acre to help acquire land for a 
nature conservancy in the Coachella Valley to protect the lizard. 
</P>
<P>
The HUD inspector general's report says the project was approved despite the 
objections after an unidentified assistant secretary at HUD said the $75,000 
condos were "within the spirit of our guidelines." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cost HUD $13.6 Million 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1985, the project went into default and HUD wound up losing $13.6 
million, the report said. Attempts to reach Wiggins were unsuccessful, but 
several people familiar with the project said that his company has gone out of 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley M. Wiseman, former deputy assistant secretary for housing at HUD, said 
in an interview Friday that, after taking office in 1983, she rewrote the rules 
for the loan-guarantee program. 
</P>
<P>
"We rewrote those guidelines so if there was no affordable housing there'd be 
no Title X," said Wiseman, who left the agency in 1985 and is now head of the 
National Assn. of Home Builders, a trade group in Washington, as well as being 
a builder and developer in Lexington, Ky., for over 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Wiseman was identified by Kemp as one of the consultants who assisted 
developers in obtaining Title X guarantees. The others were identified as 
Maurice Barksdale, another former HUD official, and Tricia Canzeri, wife of a 
former Ronald Reagan Administration official. 
</P>
<P>
Wiseman acknowledged that she lobbied Kemp soon after he took office this year 
to keep the program. She defended the program, contending that it had provided 
essential affordable housing.

ORTEGA BLAZE COULD BE CONTROLLED TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY and STEVEN R. CHURM, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Firefighters got the upper hand Friday on a Cleveland National Forest blaze 
that has burned 8,200 acres in Orange and Riverside counties and destroyed 11 
structures near Lake Elsinore. They predicted complete control by this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Aided by lighter winds and higher humidity, fire crews had more than 85% of the 
blaze encircled late Friday afternoon and began releasing many of the 2,300 
people who fought the fire in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities put the cost of suppressing the blaze at $1.5 million and estimated 
that the flames resulted in more than $1.1 million in damage to various 
structures in remote canyons and to the watershed that feeds Lake Elsinore. 
</P>
<P>
Even as firefighters mopped up remaining hot spots in the blaze, which broke 
out in steep terrain Tuesday afternoon near Ortega Highway in Riverside County, 
officials were already voicing concern over what promises to be a long, hot 
season of flames in the parched hills of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"It's relatively early in the season for a fire this large," said Dean 
McAlister, a U.S. Forest Service spokesman. "It may serve as an omen of things 
to come." 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials, meanwhile, warned residents in backcountry and rural areas to 
begin taking steps to prepare their property for the long fire season ahead. 
With the region in the third year of a drought, grassland areas need only a 
spark to set off an inferno that could dwarf the Ortega fire, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County fire officials say conditions are especially ripe in rural 
sections of the county. 
</P>
<P>
"The scenario in Orange County is no different than out there," Orange County 
Fire Department Capt. Hank Raymond said. "The possibility of a fire the 
magnitude of the Ortega fire is very real. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got extreme conditions, and you top that off with the fact that all the 
kids are out of school and it's the July 4th holiday coming up -- well, we have 
a real problem. The whole thing seems designed for disaster." 
</P>
<P>
On the fire lines Friday, crews were hiking into the rugged, charred landscape 
along the Orange-Riverside county line to battle sections of the fire still 
consuming brush and timber deep inside the area, McAlister said. Officials hope 
to salvage some of the unaffected trees, brush and terrain, which can act as 
islands of habitat for birds and other wildlife that return to the area. 
</P>
<P>
Officials had said early Friday that the fire would be contained in the 
afternoon. But they revised their estimates because of difficulty battling 
lingering flames on the southern edge of the blaze, inside the rugged, 
3,400-acre San Mateo Wilderness Area. About 1,000 acres were charred in that 
sector, which stretches south from Ortega Highway toward the Camp Pendleton 
Marine Corps Base. 
</P>
<P>
Fire crews were forced to work mostly with shovels, picks and other hand 
equipment to cut fire lines in that area because heavy equipment is not allowed 
in the wilderness, which is protected from intervention by man, authorities 
said. Although some chain saws helped speed the work, bulldozers and other 
heavy equipment were forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
"It's down to the hard grunt work, the stuff for the guys who like to sweat," 
said Stephen Guarino, a Riverside County Fire Department spokesman. The blaze 
is not expected to be fully extinguished until midday Sunday at the earliest, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
But fire crews, drawn from throughout the western United States and as far 
north as Washington state, generally found their efforts proving far more 
effective than earlier in the week, when strong winds drove the flames. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze grew especially intense Wednesday evening as it approached Lakeland 
Village, a secluded hamlet on the shores of Lake Elsinore. 
</P>
<P>
Although firefighters managed to beat back the flames, which licked to the 
edges of some properties in the village, four cabins and six mobile homes were 
destroyed on Wednesday in Decker Canyon, a secluded fold in the hills west of 
Lake Elsinore. Another house was burned to the ground in nearby Long Canyon, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators again appealed to the public for help in identifying people who 
they believe started the fire near a roadside store just across the Orange 
County line, along the crest of Ortega Highway. 
</P>
<P>
The highway will remain closed through the weekend as crews continue to mop up, 
effectively shutting down several popular campgrounds and picnic spots over the 
busy July 4 holiday. 
</P>
<P>
All of the residents evacuated from 200 homes near Lake Elsinore Wednesday 
night were back after spending the night with friends or in the local high 
school gymnasium, authorities said. Some of the residents defied evacuation 
orders and helped fight the flames or spray down their houses with garden 
hoses. 
</P>
<P>
Several property owners who live in the Cleveland National Forest area 
complained that authorities, in an effort to keep the public out of the fire 
area, have prevented residents from reaching their homes during the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Fraser, a rancher who has lived in the area burned by the Ortega fire since 
the 1950s, said many of his backcountry neighbors were kept out for safety 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
But Fraser said that was a mistake, because many of the property owners have 
prepared to fight major fires by equipping their homes with computerized 
sprinkler systems or purchasing bulldozers to clear away brush. 
</P>
<P>
"But what good are these preventive measures if you can't put them into 
action?" said Fraser, who used a four-wheel-drive vehicle to skirt the 
roadblocks and reach his ranch about two miles from Upper San Juan Campground. 
Most of the vegetation on his property was destroyed, but he managed to save 
three adobe structures -- including his house. 
</P>
<P>
"The public must be kept out, but they have to devise a system to let residents 
back in there during the fire," Fraser said. "My neighbor has a bulldozer and 
could have helped those fire crews, but he couldn't get to it. It was 
nonsense."

URGES WHITE HOUSE ACTION; 
</P>
<P>
DANNEMEYER SUGGESTS A TOP-LEVEL GAY DRIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In a strongly worded letter to President Bush, Rep. William E. Dannemeyer 
(R-Fullerton) suggests that homosexuals in the Administration have tilted White 
House policy away from "traditional family values" to promote the "homosexual 
movement." 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to local reports that a Washington male prostitution ring catered to 
clients high in the Administration, Dannemeyer called on Bush to sign an 
executive order banning federal employees from directly or indirectly 
encouraging homosexuality, as well as bisexuality, bestiality and pedophilia. 
</P>
<P>
"The public might ask how two consecutive, conservative administrations can do 
more to advance the influence of the homosexual movement in public policy than 
an overtly sympathetic Administration might have," Dannemeyer said in the 
letter, which was sent to the White House on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
He added: "One answer may turn up in the current investigations (of the alleged 
male prostitution ring). This would explain much." 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Times reported Thursday that federal authorities are 
investigating a ring of male prostitutes whose clients allegedly included Paul 
R. Balach, political personnel liaison to the White House for Labor Secretary 
Elizabeth Hanford Dole. Balach resigned Thursday, citing public disclosure of 
"activities concerning my personal life." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Dannemeyer told the President that Bush's announced support for a 
so-called "hate crimes" bill, that would require the Justice Department to 
annually catalogue crimes linked to the victim's race, religion, ethnic group 
or sexual preference, "is a subtle affirmation of homosexuality." The 
legislation was approved by the House this week and now must be considered by 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
"This bill is a precursor to amending the 1964 Civil Rights Act to include 
sexual orientation along with race, religion, creed and national origin," 
Dannemeyer wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The White House had no immediate reaction. 
</P>
<P>
However, the response from the nation's oldest homosexual rights group was 
swift. 
</P>
<P>
"This letter is so extreme in tone that I can only extend to Mr. Dannemeyer my 
gratitude," said Thomas B. Stoddard, executive director of the New York-based 
Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund. 
</P>
<P>
"This letter will greatly enhance our fund-raising efforts and demonstrates 
more concretely than any other document I have ever seen that gay people are 
still the object of irrational hatred in this country, even at the level of the 
U.S. Congress." 
</P>
<P>
Stoddard, who has debated Dannemeyer on national television several times on 
the issue of homosexual rights, added: "Mr. Dannemeyer's personal fascination 
with the subject of homosexuality transcends that of any gay person I know. . . 
. It's more than interest. It's really obsession." 
</P>
<P>
Stoddard said his organization believes that an executive order along the lines 
of the one suggested by Dannemeyer would be found to unconstitutionally limit 
the right to free speech. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter to the President, Dannemeyer cited half a dozen examples of what 
he described as the federal government's promotion of the homosexual life 
style. They included: 
</P>
<P>
* A decision by the National Endowment for the Arts to finance the display of a 
homosexual artist's work at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, an exhibit that 
Dannemeyer described as "homoerotic." 
</P>
<P>
* A proposal by the National Institutes of Health to study the sexual habits of 
Americans. Dannemeyer said a principal involved in the proposal "has a long 
list of credits favoring homosexual behavior." 
</P>
<P>
* The U.S. Postal Service's announcement that it will commemorate with a 
special cancellation the 1969 "Stonewall riot" in New York City. The incident, 
in which homosexuals battled with police, has been cited as a turning point in 
the homosexual rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Dannemeyer told Bush, "The greatest misuse of government funds in 
promotion of the homosexual life style in your Administration, as that of your 
predecessor, is the creation of our federal AIDS industry." 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer has long called for widespread testing for HIV, the virus that is 
believed to cause acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The congressman has 
argued that such testing should be confidential, but not anonymous, so that 
public health officials can trace the sexual partners of those found to be 
infected. 
</P>
<P>
"National leadership has only offered us the pathology of anonymity, a 
testament to homosexual influence in the policy-making process," Dannemeyer 
told the President. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the public does not care who in the federal government is 
homosexual," the letter states. "But I do believe they care when this sexual 
pathology subjectively biases otherwise rational thought or in some way 
compromises the national interest or national security." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Friday, Dannemeyer said of Stoddard's remarks: "I think the 
question we should ask the Stoddards of this world is very simple. 'Am I 
supposed to apologize for affirming the heterosexual ethic that is the 
foundation of our society?' 
</P>
<P>
"I feel sorry for Mr. Stoddard. He and others of his persuasion tragically have 
been misled by leaders in our society in the last 20 years . . . who have 
effectively questioned our standards of sexuality . . . and in so doing have 
sent the false signal . . . that if it feels good, do it."

WARRANTS ISSUED FOR 4 SUSPECTS IN UCI HIGH-TECH THEFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Arrest warrants were issued Friday for four current or former UC Irvine 
students who are suspected of breaking into dozens of university offices and 
stealing $120,000 in computer and electronic equipment through underground 
tunnels that link campus buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects, who are believed to have operated as a ring, were traced through 
witnesses who saw computers and other apparently stolen items in the suspects' 
dorm rooms or apartments, and through classified ads offering computers for 
sale in Orange County, Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley, according to 
Bruce Patterson, a district attorney supervising deputy. 
</P>
<P>
One suspect has agreed through his attorney to surrender, Patterson said. Two 
others are rumored to have fled to Canada, and police have information on the 
whereabouts of the fourth, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects are Paul Wesley Granados, 21, of San Jose and Henry Theodore Yeh, 
21, of Ridgecrest, both engineering students; Eric Howard Shay, 20, of La 
Crescenta, a social ecology major, and Robert Fan, 20, of Cerritos, a former 
UCI student. All four are charged with four counts of burglary, one count of 
grand theft and one count of receiving stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
"They would go through the tunnels underneath campus and surface in different 
buildings," Patterson alleged Friday, adding, "Then they would go into unlocked 
offices or use keys to go into locked areas and steal computer equipment and 
other items of value." 
</P>
<P>
The warrants follow an investigation by university police and the district 
attorney's office. Patterson said the continuing investigation may lead to 
charges against additional suspects who may have aided the four in selling 
stolen goods. 
</P>
<P>
The burglars, who struck mainly during holiday breaks and over long weekends, 
entered and escaped through a network of 10-foot-wide utility tunnels, which 
provide access for repair and maintenance of electrical, cooling and other 
systems, investigators allege. Police found an empty beer can propping open a 
door leading to the underground tunnel system on Dec. 27, when workers 
discovered that nearly $20,000 worth of equipment had been stolen from the 
Social Sciences Tower over the Christmas weekend. 
</P>
<P>
University Police Lt. William Miller described the thieves as "very bright 
people" who consistently stole the most expensive computer equipment, often 
passing over less-marketable brands or components. 
</P>
<P>
The thefts, which occurred on 14 occasions beginning in February, 1988, in the 
Social Sciences Tower, Adminstration Hall and the Graduate School of 
Management, ended after an April news story about the ring. The suspects are 
believed to have left the Irvine area a short time later, Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
Those whose offices were burglarized included Dennis Aigner, dean of the 
Graduate School of Business Management; Dennis Galligani, assistant vice 
chancellor of academic affairs, and Kathleen Kunz, finance director for the 
Office of University Advancement. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the stolen computers, which have not been recovered, valuable 
research data also was stolen and may never be replaced, investigators said. At 
the social sciences word-processing center, where thieves struck in May, 1988, 
and again last Thanksgiving, several computers and duplicate discs stored in 
the same room were taken. Professors and researchers who reported thefts also 
complained that they had lost months of work and, in some cases, one-of-a-kind 
computer files.

</P>
<P>
By July 4, they will be buzzing in the back yards of many Orange County 
residents, along with dozens of other fireworks that spark, fizz and pop. And 
from now until then, thousands are being sold from about 205 plywood and 
chicken-wire stands around the county. 
</P>
<P>
Although the sale, possession and use of so-called "safe and sane" fireworks 
are legal only in seven cities in Orange County, buyers in those areas Friday 
were buying up their shares of Piccolo Petes, Meteor Showers and Flashing 
Wheels. 
</P>
<P>
The Killer Bee, a fountain of light which also discharges sparkles of silver 
and gold, is just one of the most popular this year. Joe Blandino, who is 
operating a stand on Newport Boulevard for the Costa Mesa High School 
Basketball Boosters, said that the Ground Bloom Flowers, which spin at 300 
r.p.m. and change colors, seem to be selling the best. 
</P>
<P>
For about 25 nonprofit organizations in Costa Mesa, fireworks sales can be a 
great boost to their budgets. For example, the Costa Mesa High School swimming 
and water polo teams last year netted $8,700, Dean Cooper, the high school's 
athletic director, said. 
</P>
<P>
Blandino, whose group grossed about $7,000 last year, said sales seem to be 
even better this year. But he experienced a setback Friday when he found that 
his stand had been burglarized during the night. A chain lock had been cut and 
about $500 worth of fireworks taken. 
</P>
<P>
Blandino and his associate, Scott Johnson, both professional fund-raisers, had 
been sleeping in a camper next to the stand but heard nothing during the night. 
</P>
<P>
"This has never happened to me," said Blandino, 39, who has sold fireworks 
since he was 16. "We're just a charity organization and something like this 
happens. Now, we're going to stay inside the booth all night." 
</P>
<P>
Down the street, where a local division of the American Youth Soccer 
Organization was selling fireworks to raise money for a trip to Hawaii, an 
automatic sprinkler system at a Del Taco almost wiped out the stand Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We were probably the only stand in Orange County that got flooded," said 
Hillary Litwak, 41, one of 13 parents working to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
Blandino said he expects 80% of his sales to come Monday and Tuesday, when 
residents get serious about their holiday entertainment and buy up assortment 
packs that can go as high as $100. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that because more Orange County suburbs are ban 
</P>
<P>
ning the sale of fireworks, his stand could be helped by the reduced 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Only Buena Park, Costa Mesa, Fullerton, Garden Grove, Orange, Santa Ana and 
Westminster allow fireworks labeled safe and sane. State law bans all other 
fireworks, such as bottle rockets, firecrackers or Roman candles. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Brown, 30, brought her children, Christie, Brad and Jamie, and their dog, 
Emerald, to the stand to buy early. Brown bought $10 worth, including an 
assortment pack and some sparklers. 
</P>
<P>
She would try not to light them until Tuesday, she said, but "with three kids, 
it's hard to wait." 
</P>
<P>
What they didn't buy were smoke balls. Those only stink up the yard, she 
advised, adding that fountains are among the best. 
</P>
<P>
"They spray high and they're colorful," she said, "but they turn us on for 
about two seconds." 
</P>
<P>
Blandino said he considered the more expensive Chinese-made fireworks, which 
include the Happy Lamp that pops and turns into a lantern, superior to the 
American brands. 
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese stuff is by far better than the American stuff," he said. "The 
Americans can't hold a candle to the Chinese." 
</P>
<P>
At the American Youth Soccer Organization's stand, customer Mickey Ryan, 25, a 
student at UC San Diego, was satisfied with a Phoenix Tailhag. 
</P>
<P>
"They're real loud and obnoxious," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Litwak, who had just handed Ryan about $30 worth of fireworks, assured him: 
"It's a perfect item if you have a neighbor you don't like."

IRVINE STUDIES INCENTIVES FOR LOW-INCOME HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARCIDA DODSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Irvine City Council has taken the first steps toward requiring that 10% of 
all new housing in the city will be priced for "very low-income" families. 
</P>
<P>
The requirement would be part of a controversial new housing plan being debated 
by the council, which would require that a total of 30% of all new housing be 
priced for families classified as earning very low, low and moderate incomes. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 5-0 to have the city staff research how economic incentives 
can be offered to developers so that 10% of new housing can be priced for "very 
low-income" families -- those earning up to 50% of the median income, or 
$23,450 a year for a family of four. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Teachers, Tellers 
</P>
<P>
"These are a third of the people who work at City Hall, these are beginning 
teachers and bank tellers," Mayor Larry Agran said. 
</P>
<P>
The council had been considering a plan that would require 12.5% of the new 
housing to be priced for very low-income families, another 12.5% for families 
earning 50% to 80% of the median income, and 5% for families earning 80% to 
100% of the median -- a total of 30% of the new housing. 
</P>
<P>
However, Agran has said that the 30% figure left a misleading impression, 
because the market already offers adequate housing for families in the upper 
two categories. The developers are already meeting the proposed requirement 
there, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The council's action Thursday revised the housing figure for the lowest income 
category to 10% and directed the staff to look at three ways of financially 
assisting developers, said Maya Dunne, senior planner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tax-Exempt Bonds 
</P>
<P>
Those three ways would include allowing more apartment units per acre; issuing 
tax-exempt bonds, and allowing developers of more than one project to 
consolidate some of the low-income units at one location. 
</P>
<P>
City officials are also considering imposing "linkage fees" from employers, 
because the employees they bring to the city need housing. The money would go 
into a trust fund to help finance housing for low-income families. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, there is no citywide requirement for the construction of housing for 
very low-income families, although such a provision has been imposed at a few 
newer developments, Dunne said. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council will continue to consider the housing plan at its July 18 
meeting.

CAMPBELL, AIDE AMEND REPORTS TO INCLUDE GIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH FRAMMOLINO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dogged by news stories of unreported gifts from a major campaign contributor, 
state Sen. William R. Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights) and his top aide have 
amended their economic interest forms to show a gift of limousine service 
received during the Republican National Convention last year. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell and aide Jerry Haleva this week amended their forms to show $761 worth 
of "transportation" supplied by Asbestos Environmental Controls, a New Orleans 
firm for which Campbell's office reportedly interceded during its attempts to 
retain state contracts. 
</P>
<P>
The firm and its owner, Gordon Goldman, are among Campbell's top political 
donors, contributing $27,000 during 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Investigation to Start 
</P>
<P>
The state's Fair Political Practices Commission said Monday it would open an 
investigation after recent published reports said Campbell and Haleva had 
failed to disclose that Goldman gave them limousine service during the 
Republican convention last August. Campbell also failed to show the true source 
of a $5,000 fee paid to him by a New Orleans Jewish organization for a speaking 
engagement arranged by Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell and Haleva amended their disclosure forms to show the limousine gift 
the day after the commission said it would open an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
State Architect Michael J. Bocchicchio Sr. has acknowledged that Haleva 
contacted his office twice last year at a time when the asbestos-removal 
consulting firm ran into difficulty with some contracts for work on state 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Bocchicchio said his office had threatened to cancel the contracts because 
Asbestos Environmental Controls was slow in complying with a new law requiring 
all asbestos removal firms to register with the state. After a call from 
Haleva, the office extended a deadline and the firm did register. 
</P>
<P>
That registration, however, expired earlier this month and Bocchicchio's office 
has warned the New Orleans firm that its current contracts could be canceled by 
Monday if the eligibility is not renewed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warning Letter 
</P>
<P>
In an unrelated matter, the Fair Political Practices Commission earlier this 
month issued a warning letter to Haleva for failing to disclose $15,000 on his 
1986 statement of economic interest. The money was paid to Haleva in connection 
with Campbell's annual women's conference. 
</P>
<P>
The commission told Haleva he had violated the law by failing to list the 
income, but it cited "mitigating factors" in its decision to issue a letter of 
reprimand rather than seek fines. 
</P>
<P>
The mitigating factors were that Haleva had never run afoul of the commission 
before and that there was "no evidence of intentional concealment," said the 
letter, dated June 6. 
</P>
<P>
Haleva received the money for his service as the secretary of Campbell's 
Conference on Women, a nonprofit association. Haleva filed an amendment to his 
economic interest form in 1988 to show the $15,000 just days before to a 
published report disclosing his income from the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Both Campbell and Haleva have repeatedly declined comment on the most recent 
allegations about the limousine service and any actions on behalf of Goldman.

NEW ROAD IN DANA POINT EXPECTED TO EASE CONGESTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A short but strategically important new road opened Friday in Dana Point, and 
it is expected to ease some of the traffic congestion on Coast Highway, a 
county transportation official said. 
</P>
<P>
The 1.2-mile, four-lane, divided highway called Camino del Avion connects Crown 
Valley Parkway and Street of the Golden Lantern. The new highway was built with 
private funds from developers in the area, said Kenneth R. Smith, Orange 
County's director of transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley, whose district includes the area 
where the new highway opened, praised the opening of the new link. 
</P>
<P>
"The completion of Camino del Avion allows county staff to now focus on other 
critical links in the 1990 Action Plan" for county highway improvements, Riley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand the frustration of the coastal area residents in (the) south 
county who use our arterial highways," he said, but added, "I'm proud of the 
progress we have made, and more improvements are on the way." 
</P>
<P>
Camino del Avion is a "critical east-west arterial highway" that will provide 
an alternative route for residents of Laguna Niguel and Dana Point who now use 
Coast Highway, according to Riley. 
</P>
<P>
The opening of Camino del Avion has strategic significance to southern Orange 
County and provides long-needed traffic relief in booming southern Orange 
County, Smith said 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's real important because (there are) very few routes in that area 
going in an east-west direction," Smith said. "It'll relieve a lot of traffic 
on Coast Highway and on Stonehill (Drive)." 
</P>
<P>
The $4.5-million construction cost of Camino del Avion came entirely from 
developer contributions. Developer-paid highways are now "the backbone of the 
county's program for adding new roads," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been forced into this type of financing because the (state) gas tax 
hasn't been increased for many years." The state gasoline tax is used to 
finance roads, highways and their improvement. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said maintenance of the newly opened Camino del Avion will now be handled 
by the county and the city of Dana Point.

WARRANTS ISSUED FOR 2 IN FULLERTON STREET ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Arrest warrants were issued Friday for a Fullerton man and his 16-year-old 
brother in connection with a stabbing that left one man dead and another 
critically injured in an apparent drug deal gone sour, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton Police Lt. Jeff Roop said they were seeking Juan Manuel Lopez, 18, 
and his brother, whose name was withheld because of his age. Neither was in 
custody as of late Friday evening. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers were among four people originally arrested in the stabbing 
incident early Sunday that left Vernon Morris Carter III of Fullerton dead and 
Arthur Rodriguez Jr., 26, of Anaheim critically wounded. 
</P>
<P>
All four were released Tuesday after a prosecutor determined that there was 
insufficient evidence to file formal charges. 
</P>
<P>
Roop said that additional information requested by the district attorney's 
office was obtained by Fullerton detectives and the prosecutor subsequently 
decided to file charges against two of the original four suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Two other men originally arrested in connection with the slaying are no longer 
considered suspects in the case, Roop said. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't need much. The D.A. wanted some clarification on our evidence. We 
got, and he decided to file. We don't anticipate filing against the other two," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
He declined to specify the information sought by Deputy Dist. Atty. Douglas 
Woodsmall. 
</P>
<P>
Police say Carter and Rodriguez were accosted early Sunday in the 1400 block of 
Vista Del Mar Drive, where they had gone to buy a small amount of marijuana, 
although no drugs were found at the scene. Police theorize that the assailants 
tried to rob the pair. 
</P>
<P>
When authorities arrived, Carter was found lying on the pavement, bleeding 
profusely from several stab wounds. He was airlifted to UCI Medical Center in 
Orange, where he died several hours later. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials said the condition of Rodriguez was upgraded to good later 
in the week.

About 4,300 tribal people in northeastern India who claim to be Jews are 
becoming increasingly restive because of Israel's refusal to grant visas to 
these alleged descendants of one of the 10 lost tribes of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli Rabbi Eliezer Avihail, head of the Amisha organization which tries to 
help Jews immigrate to Israel, has visited the self-proclaimed Indian Jews in 
Mizoram and Manipur at least four times in the past decade. He has helped the

its members with literature on Judaism.

In 1983 the Mizo Jews appealed to then-Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin 
for recognition and assistance to "return home" but to little effect. Four 
Mizos did go to Israel, but the Jewish Agency is not convinced of the 
genuineness of the group's claim to be descendants of one of the lost tribes. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 12 tribes of Israel that were scattered after the Assyrian victory in 
721 BC, the descendants of only two returned. Those of the other 10 became 
assimilated in the populations of their host countries.

ROBERTS FINALLY GETS HIS MAN; 
</P>
<P>
EDISON LINEBACKER DROPS BROWN FOR LOSS IN FINAL SECONDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Edison High School linebacker Kevin Roberts had grown tired of chasing Servite 
running back Derek Brown across football fields for the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
And on Friday night, he finally caught up with him. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts tackled Brown for a four-yard loss with 43 seconds left to preserve a 
17-17 tie in the Orange County all-star game at Orange Coast College's LeBard 
Stadium. It was only the second tie in the 30-year history of the game; the 
first was a 0-0 deadlock in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd 7,500 watched Brown hammer the South defense like a human battering 
ram. He rushed for 96 of his game-high 121 yards and scored two touchdowns in 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone, including the South's Roberts, knew who would carry the ball for the 
North, which was facing a fourth-and-one at the South's 35. 
</P>
<P>
"I was lookin' for him," said Roberts, who stands 6-foot-1 and weighs 210 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts has learned by being burned by Brown the past five years, ever since 
they first faced each other in the eighth grade. Brown attended La Mirada 
Junior High School and Roberts went to South Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"He always went outside against me in junior high," Roberts said. "He did when 
we played our junior year in high school, too." 
</P>
<P>
And the all-star game wasn't any different. But this time, Roberts was waiting 
for the 5-10, 180-pound back. 
</P>
<P>
"He had been beating me outside all night," said Roberts, a starter who 
finished with five tackles. "I had to take his outside away and I did. When he 
cut inside, I took out his legs. I only got one hand on his leg. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew if I could shut him off outside we could get him. All the help was 
coming from the inside." 
</P>
<P>
Normally, a tackle at the 39-yard-line wouldn't be a game-saving one, but on 
this night it was. Brown was trying to move the North into field-goal range for 
kicker Phil Nevin, who had booted a 57-yarder last season. 
</P>
<P>
"We were mainly concerned with Brown," Roberts said. "We knew he only needed a 
yard to get them into field-goal range. We had a team huddle (during a timeout) 
and we said we couldn't let him get it or it would be all over." 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who has accepted a scholarship to play at Nebraska, said his final 
high-school rushing attempt got off to a bad start. He took the pitch from 
quarterback Albert Razo, headed for the left side, but saw Roberts and tried to 
cut back. 
</P>
<P>
"The play just wasn't there," Brown said. "I really don't know how to explain 
it. The whole play got off slow. The quarterback got the ball slow, he came out 
slow and finally I got the ball. We did the best we could, that's just the way 
it ended." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts couldn't have asked for a better play to end his high-school career. 
He'll play football next year for Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
Although he would have preferred a victory, Roberts said he was still happy 
with the tie. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just glad we didn't let them score on that last possession," he said.

LAGUNA OPEN HAS NEW LOOK, NEW THEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The granddaddy of beach volleyball tournaments, the Laguna Open, begins its 
35th consecutive year of competition today at Main Beach and this year the 
tournament is about more than just fun, sun and sand. This year's tournament is 
sporting an anti-drug theme. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Beach City Council banned sponsorship of the tournament by beer 
companies five years ago and this year tournament organizers have received 
written kudos from President George Bush and former First Lady Nancy Reagan for 
taking the council's stance one step further. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament is being sponsored by the city and Drug Use Is Life Abuse, a 
support organization of the Orange County Sheriff's Advisory Council that 
strives to raise community awareness about drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Though the tournament is the oldest and one of the most prestigious volleyball 
tournaments in America, top-ranking professional men such as Sinjin Smith, 
Randy Stoklos and defending champions Pat Powers and Jon Stevenson will be 
noticeably absent at Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The top 32 professional men are obligated by contract to play this weekend in a 
Manhattan Beach tournament sponsored by the Assn. of Volleyball Professionals. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Laguna Beach tournament will feature world-class competitors in the 
men's invitational division as well as the top players from the Women's 
Professional Volleyball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
A third division, the Legends, will showcase eight teams of volleyball's great 
seniors, including Gene Selznick -- the winner of the first Laguna Open 
tournament in 1955 who went on to win the next six two-man titles. 
</P>
<P>
"We are having the legends come but he is actually the grand legend of the 
beach," said tournament official Mary Jo Wheeler. "He has got to be in his 60s 
but he won't tell his age." 
</P>
<P>
The absence of some of the top male professionals as well an expansion of the 
$50,000 men's invitational division from 16 to 20 two-man teams has opened the 
field for more local talent. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach High School graduates Scott Fortune, who played for Stanford and 
the 1988 Olympic gold medal team and Dusty Dvorak, who played for USC and the 
1984 Olympic gold medal-winning team, will lead their two-man teams seeking the 
$27,500 first-place prize in the men's division. 
</P>
<P>
Fortune will team with John Ribarich and Dvorak with Judd Briechler. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart Jemeson and Rod Kinross, the top team from the Australian professional 
beach volleyball tour, also will participate. 
</P>
<P>
In the 16-team women's division, defending champion Janice Opalinski, a 
graduate of Dana Hills and UC Irvine, will team with Linda Chisholm. At stake 
is $20,000 in prize money, including an $11,000 first prize. Linda Robertson of 
Laguna Beach and Julie Schaar of San Clemente will be one of the top-seeded 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-four teams will compete in three divisions today through Monday for 
$70,000 in prize money. Championship play in all divisions is Monday afternoon 
and will be taped for telecast by SportsChannel. 
</P>
<P>
Play starts at 9 a.m. daily at the Main Beach courts. The event is free as is 
parking in the lot off Laguna Canyon Road just west of El Toro Road. Shuttles 
to the event site will run every 20 minutes.

Luther Medical Products Inc., a Tustin-based catheter manufacturer, said it has 
received $500,000 from a Japanese firm for the rights to market Luther's newest 
catheter in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines and Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Tate Scott, Luther's executive vice president, said the Japanese firm does not 
want to be identified until it begins its overseas marketing campaign sometime 
within the next 12 months. Scott would say only that the firm is a major 
distributor of catheters in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Scott said the catheter covered by the new licensing will be sold under the 
trade name ACTIV. He said the catheter is exceptionally thin and thus easier to 
insert in veins for intravenous feedings and medications. Once in the vein, the 
catheter expands to allow greater flow of medication and softens to increase 
patient comfort. 
</P>
<P>
Scott said Luther's agreement with the Japanese marketing firm extends over 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Discussions are under way with other companies to distribute ACTIV catheters in 
the United States and worldwide, Scott said.

Charles H. Loos, who lost his job as editor of Orange County Business First 
this week when the weekly newspaper closed its doors, has been hired as an 
editor at the Irvine World News. Loos will oversee special projects and edit 
business and religion stories, said Brien Manning, publisher of the weekly 
Irvine paper owned by the Irvine Co. Loos succeeds Warren Esterline, who will 
help Manning research the possibility of starting a new publication. "We're 
looking at contiguous areas," Manning said, naming Newport Beach, Costa Mesa 
and Tustin. Loos was the founding editor of Business First, which began 
publishing in August, 1986, as Orange County Businessweek. His career began at 
the Orange Coast Daily Pilot in Costa Mesa in 1961. He rose to managing editor 
of the Pilot before leaving in 1982 for a news job with Media General Co. in 
the San Fernando Valley.

DOCTORS BUY SAN CLEMENTE HOSPITAL, RENAME IT SAMARITAN MEDICAL CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Compiled by Leslie Berkman, Times staff writer

<P>
The $23-million sale of San Clemente General Hospital to a group of staff 
doctors was completed Friday, more than a year after they launched a bid to buy 
the 116-bed general acute-care facility from a bankrupt hospital chain. 
</P>
<P>
In one of their first moves, the new owners changed the hospital's name to 
Samaritan Medical Center-San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
Purchase of the hospital from American Healthcare Management of Dallas was 
accomplished by PACE, or Physician Associates Committed to Excellence, a group 
of 67 local physicians who each put up $50,000 in cash to help finance the 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest share of financing for the acquisition was provided by Cigna 
Insurance Co., said David Gordon, vice president of John Nuveen &amp; Co. Inc., 
a Chicago investment banker that represented PACE in its negotiations with AHM. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as the sale closed Friday, administration of the hospital was turned 
over to Samaritan Health Services, a subsidiary of Phoenix-based Samaritan 
Foundation. Samaritan Health Services has contracted with PACE to operate it as 
a nonprofit facility. 
</P>
<P>
Vince Townsend, who previously was an associate administrator of Good Samaritan 
Regional Medical Center in Phoenix, on Friday became the San Clemente 
hospital's chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
Townsend said one of his priorities would be to upgrade the hospital's 
emergency room, as state health officials have requested. He said he will 
submit to the state within 60 days a plan that details how and when the 
improvements will be made.

FLAWS IN U.S. HEALTH CARE SYSTEM PUSHING COUPLES INTO DIVORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN McQUEENEY MITRIC, Maturity News Service 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When a Methodist minister divorced his wife of 32 years in a Nebraska courtroom 
last month, it was not because of the usual string of irreconcilable 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, the Rev. Lincoln B. Justice, 60, and his paralyzed wife, Rose Marie, 
56, of Lincoln, dissolved their marriage to circumvent rules in the nation's 
health-care system, which, the couple says, forces its citizens into poverty 
before it will provide basic health care. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as a divorced woman, Rose Marie Justice will be able to stay in her home 
and deplete her savings until she qualifies for Medicaid and the full-time 
nursing help she needs since a 1979 auto accident left her a paraplegic. 
</P>
<P>
If she had stayed married, new provisions added to the expanded Medicare 
program, designed to prevent spousal impoverishment, would not have helped her. 
</P>
<P>
These changes, introduced by Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) allow the healthy 
spouse to keep half the couple's assets if the other is admitted to a 
professionally staffed nursing home. But if the ailing spouse chooses to remain 
at home, the benefits only cover part-time nursing for 38 consecutive days. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wrenching Decision 
</P>
<P>
The Justices made the wrenching decision after the minister, in order to pay 
for full-time care, took a new assignment requiring him to live 30 miles away, 
in the Weeping Water parsonage. That home is not wheelchair accessible. 
</P>
<P>
"And since we've already decimated our lifetime savings to make our home in 
Lincoln barrier-free and hired a homemaker," said Rose Marie Justice, "it just 
made no sense for me to leave it." 
</P>
<P>
In an emotional dissolution ceremony in his church in Lincoln, the minister 
vowed to "remarry my wife should the nation's laws ever change to allow us to 
live" in something other than poverty. 
</P>
<P>
His wife added: "We're not senior citizens yet, so we don't qualify for 
Medicare. And I'm certainly not ready for the nursing home yet." 
</P>
<P>
The couple's attorney, Virginia Johnson, said their case is far from unique. 
She said recent amendments to the catastrophic-health-care bill do nothing to 
make life simpler and more solvent "for the overwhelming percentage of the 
nation's elderly or near elderly who need help at home, but aren't nursing-home 
candidates." 
</P>
<P>
She also lamented a health-care system that encourages people to figure out 
ways to hide their assets from the government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Must Pay Full Costs 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was referring to the requirement that those who did not transfer their 
home or assets to a spouse, sibling or child at least two years before they 
were institutionalized must pay full costs for care as a private patient for up 
to 30 months. 
</P>
<P>
"The catastrophic-care bill is not aimed to help the total numbers of people 
we're dealing with. In fact, I think it makes financial survival easier for 
perhaps only 5% of the ailing old." 
</P>
<P>
While not sharing this bleak assessment, Mikulski's staff agrees that the new 
provisions to prevent spousal impoverishment are only an important first step 
that will make life easier for hundreds of thousands of elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Constance P. Carden, attorney with Legal Services for the Elderly in New York, 
concurs. She also makes the point that if all assets and income are in the 
ailing husband's name, women are forced to sue their spouses in the nursing 
home for support -- and not every state recognizes this court-ordered remedy. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead, lots of couples made the wrenching decision to divorce so they could 
separate income from assets held by an ailing, confined spouse," said Carden. 
"The Mikulski provision will be a godsend to many of our poorest clients. At 
least it will stop these court petitions. 
</P>
<P>
"Prior to the changes, a person had to have less than $5,000 to qualify for 
Medicaid. No more was allowed in savings or assets, including the cash value of 
any insurance policy they held," Carden said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Split Combined Assets 
</P>
<P>
Under the Mikulski provision, beginning Oct. 1, the community-based spouse is 
guaranteed anywhere from $786 a month to a $1,200. Couples can split their 
combined assets up to a maximum of $60,000. They are guaranteed a minimum of 
$12,000 in assets, or half of a combined estate of $24,000. 
</P>
<P>
However, in states such as Nebraska, where nursing homes are already 
overwhelmed with non-paying Medicaid patients, the banks are threatening to put 
liens against houses held by community-based spouses and to call the liens in 
should the state health system go bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Johnson predicts that scenario will become commonplace "once the 
baby-boom generation starts pounding at the nursing-home doors." 
</P>
<P>
According to Alfred Chiplin, staff attorney with the National Senior Citizens 
Law Center in Washington, while the Mikulski amendment lays a foundation for 
individual estates to decide how they are going to do property separations, 
"they do nothing to help millions like the Justices who are ill but want to 
stay at home."

AD AGENCY DEFINES BUYERS BY LIFE STYLES, NOT BY AGE ANYMORE

It used to be that age had a lot to do with how we act and what we buy. 
</P>
<P>
Now, stage could become important in how products are pitched to us, according 
to J. Walter Thompson, the ad agency that bills $3.8 billion annually 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
When they talk about stages, they aren't talking about second childhoods or 
mid-life crises. They're talking about say, a young parent, married and whose 
oldest child is preteen. That young parent could be 25 years old or 50. 
</P>
<P>
"We no longer define parents in terms of their own age, but by the age of their 
children," said Peter Kim, who heads JWT's consumer behavior department. "We 
have found that studies based on age such as 50-plus, the graying of America or 
life-style studies, such as the yuppies, are obsolete as we enter the 1990s," 
said James B. Patterson, chief executive officer of J. Walter Thompson USA. "If 
we think of people in terms of their life stage rather than their age or even 
socioeconomic position, we will have a more accurate window into their needs 
and desires." 
</P>
<P>
In the postwar years, life was fairly cut and dried. A young man got a job, 
married and started a family all before he was 30. He stayed married through 
his retirement and until he died at 69. The young woman spent her life as a 
homemaker. 
</P>
<P>
Not so today and not well into the 1990s, says Kim. Today, he says, young 
people will go through many phases between the time they leave school and die, 
at average age 80 by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
There are the singles, broken into four groups: at-home singles, young adults 
living with their parents; starting-out singles, young adults sharing or 
supporting their own apartments; mature singles, older adults either never 
married or divorced, and left-alone singles, widowed seniors or older divorced 
adults, 77% of them women. 
</P>
<P>
There are two types of couples: young couples recently married and childless, 
and the empty nesters, those left alone because their children are grown. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to young parents, the parental life stage includes mature parents 
and single parents. Mature parents are married and their oldest dependent child 
is a teen-ager or adult. Single parents are unmarried parents rearing their own 
children. 
</P>
<P>
The whole thrust of this, of course, is how to target the markets. 
Empty-nesters and mature parents, just in case you're wondering, are the 
largest groups in the country, 65 million total now and 77 million in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
The 33 million mature parents in the country control $650 billion in income 
while the 32 million empty nesters control $520 billion. 
</P>
<P>
By 1995, when baby boomers age, mature parents' ranks and income are expected 
to swell by 24% and empty nesters' by 14%. 
</P>
<P>
Move over, yuppies.

FIRST LADY STIMULATES NEW INTEREST IN HAND-STITCHED HOME ACCESSORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MAYER, AP Newsfeatures 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With Barbara Bush in the White House, interest in hand-stitched home 
accessories is on the upswing, according to Kay Cook, executive director of the 
National Needlework Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The First Lady, a devoted needle crafter, took nine years to complete the 
10-by-14-foot needlepoint rug that is now in the family sitting room at the 
White House. While under construction, sections of the rug, in basket weave on 
No. 10 canvas, accompanied the Bushes to 17 countries and 36 states. The design 
includes personal data, such as grandchildrens' initials and important family 
dates. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Bush, a skilled needleworker, said she undertook the lengthy project 
because "I wanted something that I wouldn't outgrow. Something I would have 
forever." 
</P>
<P>
Model Cheryl Tiegs and TV actress Betty White are among other well-knowns who 
enjoy needle craft. 
</P>
<P>
Between photo sessions, Tiegs is needlepointing a mirror frame. She said the 
personal aspect of the hobby is one of its most appealing attributes. Indeed, 
she stitches her initials and the completion date into each piece for an "extra 
personal touch." 
</P>
<P>
White, one of television's "Golden Girls," works on needlepoint on the set and 
in spare moments at home. She is most proud of two rugs she has completed, one 
with songbirds and another with seashells. 
</P>
<P>
Needlepoint will soon be in the governor's mansion in Cheyenne, Wyo. Jane 
Sullivan, wife of the governor, is having 24 chair seats in the formal dining 
room covered with needlepoint designs of Wyoming wildflowers. 
</P>
<P>
In thousands of less famous homes, too, needlepoint is enjoying new popularity. 
</P>
<P>
Cook estimated that in the past five years needle-craft shops have increased to 
60% from 40% the amount of space devoted to needlepoint, cross-stitch and 
crewelwork supplies. These are the materials used to create pillows, wall 
decorations, fireplace screens, footstool covers, chair seats and rugs. 
</P>
<P>
Another indication of increased interest: ready-made accessories are being 
snapped up by consumers who want the look without the work. 
</P>
<P>
Designer Michael Jackson stocked his recently opened shop in Cross River, N.Y., 
with needlepoint cushions made in China. The cushions, with designs geared to 
American interiors, sell for about $200 apiece, and within a week he had sold 
all but one. 
</P>
<P>
"Up till now," he said, "if you wanted to have a needlepoint accessory in your 
room, you either had to do it yourself or inherit it." 
</P>
<P>
Designer Mario Buatta said he has been using needlepoint in interiors for 25 
years to create an air of unstudied elegance. (His first placement was a King 
Charles spaniel pillow). Now he's designing kits and ready-made cushions in a 
new needlepoint collection for Thimbelina, a manufacturer in Amagansett, N.Y. 
Designs include dogs, rabbits, flowers and fruit and can be worked into 
pillows, fire screens, scatter rugs, chair seat covers and framed wall pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Prices range from $115 to $135 for the kits and from about $280 to $425 for the 
pillows. According to figures in Sew Business Magazine quoted by Cook, the 
average retail price for a hand-painted 14-inch needlepoint canvas is $41.73. 
</P>
<P>
As decorative accessories, needlepoint designs have many pluses. 
</P>
<P>
"They last for years," Buatta said, "and give any room in which they're used a 
warmth and individuality you just don't get from plain old pillows. That 
pattern-on-pattern look of a needlepoint pillow on top of a chintz chair takes 
away the edge of looking too new and softens the room." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson suggested placing more than one needlepoint cushion on a chair or sofa. 
Mix sizes and shapes but group them according to subject matter or color. He 
said pillows with fringe or tiny cord bows are especially appealing. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said needlepoint cushions can be embellished with cord, ribbon, fringe 
or tassels.

ON THE WATERFRONT: RISK TAKEN ON SAILBOAT PAYS OFF IN A RECORD PACE FOR WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Life.

<P>
Last summer Lydia Bird went head over heels into debt to buy a 27-foot sailboat 
to race alone from Los Angeles to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured I would make it to the other end, where I could sell the boat, or if 
the boat sank, I would crawl into a life raft and have such a story to tell 
that I could write a book and make some money to pay for the boat," says Bird. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, 14 days later, Bird, 34, arrived safely in Hawaii, setting a women's 
sailing record along the way. 
</P>
<P>
A sailing instructor at Orange Coast College, Bird hopes that her success will 
serve as inspiration to other women sailors, and she has designed a special 
class, exclusively for women, to provide some practical assistance too. 
</P>
<P>
The course, which begins July 10 at the Orange Coast College Sailing Center, 
1801 W. Pacific Coast Highway in Newport Beach, will focus on teaching big-boat 
crewing techniques aboard the college's 47-foot sloop, Saudade. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see more all-women crews out there racing," says Bird, who is 
spending the summer with a group of 10 women in Annapolis, Md., preparing for 
the Whitbread around-the-world race in September. She will return to Orange 
County to teach her weeklong course, then fly back to Annapolis for more 
training. 
</P>
<P>
"I really look forward to teaching the class," she says. "I think women's 
sailing has started to accelerate both in terms of women's events and women 
becoming involved in sailing, but it is still very much a male-dominated sport. 
Look at the America's Cup and there are all male faces. No women to be seen." 
</P>
<P>
Although Bird's class is not framed around racing, she believes that ocean 
racing is a good way to learn all the sailing skills you need. 
</P>
<P>
Bird, originally from Pasadena, says she learned by sailing in local races, 
including the Newport-to-Ensenada race. When she was 18, she made her first 
Atlantic passage. And she has participated in the Tour de France a la Voile, a 
race that covers the entire coastline of France. At the border with Spain, the 
boats are plucked out of the water, trucked across the Pyrenees and deposited 
in the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
Before sailing single-handedly from Los Angeles to Hawaii, Bird had hoped to 
compete in the OSTAR single-handed race from England to Newport, R.I. "But that 
is hard to do without a sponsor," she says. "When I realized I wasn't going to 
be able to do it, I decided to do the single-handed TransPac race, instead. 
</P>
<P>
"Originally, I wanted to charter a 40-foot boat for the race," she says. "I put 
months and months of work toward the race, and then two months before it 
started, I found I couldn't get insurance." 
</P>
<P>
Unable to charter the 40-footer without insurance, Bird opted to buy her own 
boat so that she could race it uninsured. Since her finances were limited, she 
had to settle for a much smaller, more affordable 27-foot sailboat. 
</P>
<P>
The passage was rough, with storm winds up to 35 knots and steep seas. "I had 
four or five knockdowns. The boat literally lay on its side with water coming 
in the cockpit," says Bird, who always wore a safety harness to keep her in the 
boat. "But I had suffered knockdowns before and I realized that it would come 
back up. I thought I would have felt more vulnerable (in a boat that small), 
but I had confidence in it. I was never really scared. I think I have spent 
enough time on the ocean that it wasn't scary for me." 
</P>
<P>
Because there was so much wind, Bird had to decide how hard to push the little 
boat. "It was hard for me to balance the demands of racing with the need to 
respect the boat and its gear," says Bird, who kept reminding herself that the 
boat must be in good condition when the race was over so that she could sell 
it. "It was hard for me to justify pushing the boat hard and damaging it." 
</P>
<P>
During the 14-day passage, Bird rarely slept more than an hour at a time. "I 
would set a kitchen timer for an hour and then get up and look around and check 
the compass course and the sails. Then I would go back to sleep for another 
hour," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Since Bird's small boat had little in the way of instrumentation, she was 
forced to rely on celestial navigation. "I ended up going back to the basics," 
she says. "I did a lot of my navigation by stars. It was a tremendous feeling 
to be in this tiny, skittery boat with this sextant in your hand. It was 
amazing to be in the middle of nowhere -- completely alone. But there was so 
much work to do and the race was so short, I never felt lonely." 
</P>
<P>
What Bird did feel, she says, was extreme discomfort. "You get real bruised up 
on a boat that size," she says. "It's awkward. You literally have to crawl 
around on all fours. And the boat leaked. I couldn't seal the windows and the 
entire boat was wet the whole time. Everything was soaked with saltwater. It 
was like working in a steam bath." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the discomfort, Bird says that, in retrospect, she believes it was 
better to have a small boat. "There was a lot more wind than they had had in 
other races," she says. "So this boat was more manageable for me. It was a good 
boat for me." 
</P>
<P>
Out of a fleet of 14 boats, Bird placed fifth overall and broke the women's 
record by three days. She sold the boat in Hawaii and returned to California 
with new sailing goals. This summer she joined the U.S. Women's Challenge Group 
in preparing a 57-foot aluminum sloop for the around-the-world Whitbread race. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether we get to make the race depends upon getting corporate funding," Bird 
says. "We need to get a $1.5-million corporate sponsor." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the women, who range in age from 22 to 42, are practicing in 
the waters off Annapolis. "The crew comes from all over," Bird says. "The woman 
who is organizing it is from Rhode Island. A few are from the West Coast, and 
one woman is from England." 
</P>
<P>
The all-women crew represents the change that is going on in sailing today, 
according to Bird. "If you were a woman sailor, people didn't take you very 
seriously," she says. "That was in the past. There are a lot of big changes 
going on now. Women may have to work a lot harder to get the kind of muscle 
strength you need, but as new equipment comes out, there are ways to get around 
that. I tell the women sailors in my class that you have to learn to use your 
brains more. If you can't get a line in by sheer beef, you have to get past the 
old stigmas and stereotypes. You have to set your mind on being able to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Fishing Derby -- A free fishing clinic, followed by a fishing derby with more 
than $1,000 in prizes, will be held at the San Clemente Pier on July 8 and 9. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic will run from 7 a.m. to noon on July 8 and the derby will follow on 
July 9 from 7 a.m. to noon. Although the clinic is free, the derby will cost $1 
per angler. There is no age limit, but children must be accompanied by parents. 
For information call (714) 492-8335. Preregistration begins Wednesday at Pier 
Tackle at the end of the pier on Del Mar Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Family Sailing -- You can learn to sail with your children in a new family 
sailing class being offered this summer by the Dana Point Harbor Youth and 
Group Facility. 
</P>
<P>
Children under 17 must be accompanied by parents. The class meets from 9:30 
a.m. to 12:30 p.m. beginning July 9, and continuing through Aug. 6. Cost is 
$45. For information, call (714) 661-7122.

PHOTOGRAPHY: SHARPEN FOCUS BY 'ASSIGNING' A TOUGH SHOOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
One of biggest roadblocks to good photography is the alibi -- the rationalizing 
that allows you to feel better about not working hard on a photo project. 
</P>
<P>
Well, one good way to get over these mental blocks is to give yourself a 
photographic assignment. Pretend you just got a call from Life or National 
Geographic and you need to shoot a "day in the life of" photo story. 
</P>
<P>
Try and be creative with different camera angles. You should move in close and 
pay attention to detail. In short, rely on composition. This assignment will 
give you plenty of time to think and visualize as you go along. 
</P>
<P>
Jot down a note and have a game plan. Figure out what types of film you will 
need. 
</P>
<P>
Taking pictures in the early morning hours, at sunset and at night really will 
add variety to your images. You may need to step up to a fast 400-speed film 
for the low-light situations, unless you're using a tripod. Hand-hold the 
camera at slow shutter speeds (1/30, 1/15 or 1/8) to test steadiness. 
</P>
<P>
Also, use various light sources -- window light, direct sun, open shade, 
backlighting, sidelighting, candlelight, light from neon sign, strobe light or 
even a flashlight. Even consider using a time exposure on a tripod to vary the 
look. 
</P>
<P>
When you finish the shot, the most important work begins -- editing and 
critiquing the work. Be firm yet objective. The bad frames go in the circular 
file and the good ones to slide trays or the photo album. Then enjoy your work.

JOSEPH N. BELL: ORANGE COUNTY LIBERAL LEARNS TO COEXIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some years ago, I wrote an article published in Look magazine entitled 
"America's Kinkiest County." I thought it was funny, but a lot of the Orange 
County power structure didn't. 
</P>
<P>
A few days after it came out, there was a ring at our front door. I opened it, 
and there huddled in the darkness of a winter evening was an elderly couple I 
had seen occasionally walking around the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw your article," said the man, and paused. I waited for the attack. Then 
he said, almost wistfully: "I didn't know there were any more of us in the 
whole county." 
</P>
<P>
Although that was more than a decade ago, I haven't perceived that things have 
changed a whole lot since then. In style, maybe, but not in substance. Liberal 
Democrats in Orange County still tend to huddle in the dark, reluctant to 
identify themselves -- not out of fear but mostly out of a weary disinclination 
to retread the same old arguments with the county's vociferous and voluminous 
guardians of the Right. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago, I was reminded of this incident when a piece was published in 
this section about the problems that Orange County liberals have on the dating 
scene. One dismayed, still-young divorcee wrote: "I have lived in this area for 
14 years, and I have yet to meet a married or single inhabitant who does not 
believe that Reagan was a gift from God, that prayer must be an integrated part 
of the school curriculum, and that recreational machine guns are our 
birthright." 
</P>
<P>
Well, it isn't much different for those of us to whom dating isn't a concern. 
And it always starts with the assumption on the part of virtually every Orange 
Countian with whom I come into casual contact that you are one of them -- 
especially if you appear to have the right economic and ethnic credentials. 
</P>
<P>
This cuts pretty deep and makes for a certain number of ethical problems for 
the liberal living in Orange County. Take the plumber I used for many years -- 
until he retired recently. Because I work frequently at home, I always try to 
hang out with people who come to repair our facilities, hoping -- a foolhardy 
assumption for a liberal -- to learn enough to do it myself the next time. So I 
spent a lot of time early on with this plumber. He didn't seem to mind because 
he liked to talk. And most of his talk came out of the John Birch Society Blue 
Book. 
</P>
<P>
But he was also a terrific plumber. So I had an ethical problem. Should I look 
for another plumber who doesn't know the eccentricities of my pipes and also 
probably isn't nearly as good just so the fees I pay him won't be going into a 
fund to get us out of the U.N. or prevent fluoridation of our water supplies? I 
kept the plumber. 
</P>
<P>
Same thing with my barber. I've gone to her for 15 years now, and she knows 
exactly how I want my hair cut. She's also inexpensive. For years, we talked 
mostly about Las Vegas and the Angels and the problems of raising kids. Then 
one day, in the midst of trimming my eyebrows, she allowed as how all people 
with AIDS should be colonized somewhere so they can't expose the rest of us. I 
asked, a little timidly, if she knew how AIDS was transmitted, and her shears 
began to snip angrily so I backed off. Once again, the ethical question. I 
solved it by reading or sleeping in the barber chair. 
</P>
<P>
Now these may be cowardly acts, but they are pragmatic. I like living here, and 
I don't want to spend all my time trying to persuade local citizens that there 
are quite reasonable arguments made by perfectly good Americans that all 
homeless people aren't bums, that homosexuals are not homosexuals by choice, 
and that no harm would be done to the Constitution by registering guns. 
</P>
<P>
Because my background as a small-town, Midwestern good ol' boy, church 
affiliation, and social connections when we moved to Newport Beach three 
decades ago threw us at first into a politically reactionary group of people, 
I've had to learn how to pick friends who either see things generally the way I 
do or can discuss political differences rationally. That's taken some doing in 
Orange County, even though my associates at UC Irvine were always there to fall 
back on. 
</P>
<P>
I've been fascinated with the recent surveys that keep telling us that Orange 
Countians are really quite liberal on many social issues. If that's true, they 
certainly haven't reflected it in the voting booth. Or among plumbers or 
barbers or bankers or most of the corporate executives I've found myself in 
conversation with at cocktail parties. 
</P>
<P>
In the Orange County I inhabit, I remember -- not untypically -- that after I 
published a piece in a national magazine about how my wife and I took each of 
our children individually to Washington on an "American Heritage" trip, one of 
my conservative friends said, quite seriously: "I didn't know you liberals did 
that sort of thing." 
</P>
<P>
I have a publicist friend who used to write speeches for John Wayne, and one of 
the ways he got his kicks was by slipping in quotes from obscure political 
liberals or socialists that sounded good in the context of the speech and were 
thus never caught. In a sense, I suppose I've been doing the same thing in 
Orange County for a number of years. 
</P>
<P>
The difference, I guess, is that I've made friends with a satisfying number of 
people who disagree with me, but we respect each other in an impatient sort of 
way. That, I believe, is how it is supposed to work in this country.
