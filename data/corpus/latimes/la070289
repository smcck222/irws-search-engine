As I happened upon what I thought was a science fiction movie, it instead 
turned out to be "Hard Time on Planet Earth." After watching just 30 minutes of 
it, I can see why it is having such a hard time!

FIVE SUMMER STORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE 4TH OF July weekend is summer reading's perfect holiday, the right time for 
the printed page, a beach chair and a tall, cold drink. It is also, we think, 
the perfect time for the first Los Angeles Times Magazine all-fiction issue. 
</P>
<P>
This collection of stories brings together five California writers with highly 
individual voices, all tuned to a West Coast note: 
</P>
<P>
HARRIET DOERR. Her first novel, "Stones for Ibarra," won the American Book 
Award in 1984, and her work has appeared in the New Yorker and other literary 
publications. Doerr is 79 and lives in Pasadena. Her contribution to this 
issue, "Like Heaven," will be published in January in a collection of her early 
work by the Yolla Bolly Press in Covelo, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
JOHN L'HEUREUX. At 54, L'Heureux has been director of the Stanford Writing 
Program for the past 12 years. His stories have been published in Esquire, the 
Atlantic and the New Yorker. "Father," published here, will be included in 
"Comedians," a collection of his fiction due in January from Viking. 
</P>
<P>
KATE BRAVERMAN. Her novels -- "Lithium for Medea" and last year's "Palm 
Latitudes" -- and poetry have won critical praise. "Falling in October" is part 
of a work-in-progress called "Tall Tales from the Mekong Delta." Braverman, 39, 
is an associate professor of creative writing at Cal State Los Angeles and 
lives in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
AMY TAN. Tan, 37, switched from corporate writing to fiction in 1985. Her first 
collection of stories, "The Joy Luck Club," from which "Rice Husband" is taken, 
has been on the bestseller list for 10 weeks. She lives in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
DAVID FREEMAN. Freeman's collection of stories, "A Hollywood Education," was 
published in 1986. "The Veterinarian's Daughter" is adapted from "The Mirror of 
Desire," a forthcoming novel about the life and death of Carla Tate, nee Karen 
Teitel, a child star who grows up to become an adult star. Freeman, who also 
writes screenplays, is 47 and lives in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
All of these writers are journalists in their way. Their work explains the way 
we are and the way we live with an accuracy that the facts can never quite 
convey.

<P>
LATE ON A SEPTEMBER AFTERNOON, WITH barely time for a side trip before dark, 
Elizabeth Troy left the main highway and followed a winding road to a seaside 
town she used to know. Once there, she found its light and sound, its single 
wooded hill, its mile of beach now widening at low tide, so improbably familiar 
that at first she thought she was lost. The rack of sunglasses in the drugstore 
window, the flag on the grocery, the pines and eucalyptus on the hill across 
the road, the whole look of the place struck her as magic, a triumph of 
recollection over reality. 
</P>
<P>
Standing on the cement walk that only ran for a block and a half, breathing air 
that came quick and blue from the sea, she was glad she was here, a few miles 
west of the freeway, in a place she hadn't seen for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
She parked in front of an empty lot, in case the Alvarado brothers and Mrs. Nye 
still owned their stores and might notice and recognize her, and waste time 
talking. She thought she had glimpsed a dark Alvarado head behind the meat 
counter of the grocery and Mrs. Nye's glasses gleaming behind the drugstore 
counter. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond Elizabeth, the pink stucco post office was closing for the night. A 
border of nasturtiums erupted against its side in hot reds and saffron yellows, 
the intense shades that figure more often in memory than in fact. Elizabeth 
turned to face the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Here there was a change. The end of the pier had broken off and taken with it 
fishermen's benches and a bait hut. A life preserver still hung from a loose 
guardrail. Elizabeth watched a jogger run north on the beach and two others 
pass him, running south. 
</P>
<P>
Footsteps approached her and stopped. It was an Alvarado brother, the oldest 
one, Juan, who had never learned much English. 
</P>
<P>
"Juan," she said, and shook hands. 
</P>
<P>
Juan said, "Welcome," and smiled the wide smile she remembered. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm only passing through," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Then you live here now," said Juan. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to leave before dark." 
</P>
<P>
"Which is your house?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, I'm just passing through." 
</P>
<P>
"Welcome," said Juan, and they shook hands again. 
</P>
<P>
There was less than an hour of daylight left. Elizabeth crossed the street, 
passed the closed Unitarian church and the closed real estate office and walked 
down Seaside to Pine. Pine Street climbed the hill in the rough shape of a 
question mark and shone with a recent coat of tar. Unpaved lanes ran off it. 
</P>
<P>
At the second crossroad, Elizabeth turned right. This had been a street of 
garage studios and houses split into apartments. Couples halfway between her 
age and her mother's used to rent here by the month in summer. During the week, 
the wives took care of one or two small children, rinsing sand from their hair, 
pulling up blankets at night. The husbands came for weekends and, on Friday 
night and Saturday, couples went from house to house, carrying corn chips and 
glasses out of which martinis splashed to dot the dust of the lane. Sometimes, 
over the weekend, the composition of the couples changed and new pairs formed, 
only to regroup by six o'clock Sunday into the original pairs -- the father and 
mother of the child who, bathed combed, and bearded with cookie crumbs, was 
already learning to survive. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the halves of couples failed to rejoin. This happened in the case of 
Elizabeth's cousin Jane, who left her new husband for someone's house guest so 
suddenly that her eggplant casserole was still in the oven and her wet bikini 
still on the line. 
</P>
<P>
Today, towels hung from the balcony of one apartment. A motorcycle stood at the 
front door of another. Four had signs offering them for winter rent, and a 
converted garage was for sale. 
</P>
<P>
ELIZABETH, CONTINUING UP PINE, PAUSED ON THE curve to look back at the 
glittering sea, then turned in the direction of the house where she had spent 
her summers as a girl. Scuffing through pine needles, she passed a row of new 
houses, compact and functional, before she came to one she recognized. It had 
belonged to Capt. Benton-Smith, who was wounded in the first attack on 
Gallipoli in 1915 and spent 24 hours bleeding on the beach. The captain's scars 
were visible when, before taking his swim, he sat on the sand in his Panama hat 
and the black trunks that came to his knees. His cheerful nature and reasonable 
attitude toward the rout ("We should have given the buggers a shot at the 
generals") turned the white cavities carved out of his neck and shoulders into 
metaphors of scars, acquired without pain or fear. 
</P>
<P>
The captain spent all his summers here, attended to by Irish Meg, a woman of 
such a frank green gaze and broad white smile that everyone assumed he loved 
her and, hale as he was, took her regularly to bed. Now ice plant overran Capt. 
Benton-Smith's lawn, and ivy wound its way through the louvered shutters of his 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond two more new cottages, Elizabeth came to the Scotts' and the Mannings' 
houses. Mrs. Scott and Mrs. Manning had been amateur botanists. They spent 
their summers hatted and scarved, on top of the hill or on the slopes behind 
it, carrying sketch pads and crayons and, in a hamper, watercress-and-cucumber 
sandwiches and a flask of sherry. At the end of the summer, one year in one 
house, the next in the other, they exhibited their drawings, spidery and faint, 
of blossoms and nettles and varieties of sage. 
</P>
<P>
THE POTTERS' HOUSE STOOD on a rise above a canyon that was dense with 
underbrush and the shade of trees. Elizabeth and Annie Potter had been best 
summer friends in the years before college. Then one went east and one went 
north and they began to like other people. Annie became a painter and 
eventually married one. Now she lived in Napa Valley. Elizabeth thought it was 
Napa Valley. Either Napa Valley or Monterey. 
</P>
<P>
There had been a time when she and Annie Potter, day after day, had stretched 
out, wet from the ocean, to lie for hours on adjacent towels on the sand. They 
had spent a large part of 10 summers this way, flat on their stomachs or their 
backs, in talk, in silence, and in talk again. 
</P>
<P>
Annie's Uncle Si, her father's handsome younger brother, had usually spent 
August here and was the second hero on the street. Uncle Si went into World War 
II a year before necessary. At 20, he flew a Spitfire for the British over the 
Sussex downs and Kent. The next year, he was with the Americans over North 
Africa. He was shot down twice and came home with medals and oak leaf clusters. 
Once, when Elizabeth was sitting with Annie on the Potters' fringed porch 
swing, Uncle Si happened to say, as if the strip of ocean he could see between 
two pines had reminded him of it, that he had known one or two American pilots 
who tried to shoot down their own fighters. He said he was almost picked off by 
a flyer in his squadron who wanted to claim a hit on a German bomber as his 
own. "To improve his score," said Uncle Si, "and get home sooner." Uncle Si 
said this and laughed. Uncle Si's looks set him apart. And when jokes were 
told, it was Uncle Si who always laughed the longest. 
</P>
<P>
BEYOND THE POTTERS' RAMBLING ONE-STORY, IN FRONT of the house where she herself 
had spent so many summers, Elizabeth came face to face with Mr. Elby. She 
remembered him, a master of ingenious household repairs, as if they had met 
yesterday. He was pushing a bicycle that he appeared much too old to ride. His 
nose was thinner than when she had seen him last, his eyes hollower, and his 
ears almost transparent. 
</P>
<P>
With his faded stare on her, Elizabeth stopped and said hello. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you Lizzie?" said Mr. Elby, and she saw that a front tooth, missing 15 
years ago, had never been replaced. 
</P>
<P>
This meeting would delay her. Now she might not get to the top of the hill and 
down to the beach before dark. "How are you, Mr. Elby?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Good," he said. He examined her for changes, a few white hairs, perhaps, a 
thickening waist. Then he said, "You look all right. You're still wiry." He 
held his bicycle, ready to mount. "How's that man of yours, what's-his-name?" 
</P>
<P>
"Greg," said Elizabeth, and paused. She had lived too close to her husband for 
too long to sum him up on such short notice. Without speaking, she continued to 
stare at Mr. Elby, who had once shot a skunk from her mother's bedroom window. 
("I can get a better bead on it from here.") 
</P>
<P>
"Well, Greg, how's he?" Mr. Elby persisted. 
</P>
<P>
When she still stood silent, Mr. Elby made a guess. "He's gone," he said 
soberly. 
</P>
<P>
"Not really," she said. "But he's away. He's in Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
"One of them places," said Mr. Elby. Then, "I never got to know him like I do 
you. " 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps you will sometime." She might as well have said, perhaps a tidal wave 
will leave fishes gasping on Pine Street. "He has to be at meetings," Elizabeth 
told Mr. Elby and could have added, my husband is trying to save the world. She 
placed Greg in conference, this time in a colonial building that had an 
interior carved stone balustrade and carved lintels at its windows. Under the 
windows, starving people lined the curb. 
</P>
<P>
"What kind of meetings are those?" 
</P>
<P>
"Scientific," she said. "Better ways to grow food." 
</P>
<P>
"I lost all my tomatoes to the beetle," said Mr. Elby. "Where've you been, 
anyway? How are the kids?" 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth answered the questions in order. "Lately in Mexico," she said. Then, 
"They're both in college and fine." She silently added, I hope. There was no 
way of telling how they were, out of sight and growing up too fast. 
</P>
<P>
"You living here?" Mr. Elby asked with suspicion. If she had rented one of 
these houses without telling him, he would resent the lost chance to check the 
gas outlets and get the rust out of the pipes. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I could." Then she spoke to Mr. Elby as she once would have to Annie 
Potter. "It would be like heaven." 
</P>
<P>
"Like heaven," he repeated, and was silent for a moment. "Maybe so, maybe not." 
He propped his bicycle against the choked honeysuckle on the fence. A light 
fragrance rose from the matted flowers. "What did you come for?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth sensed that she was under interrogation. "Why did you do it?" 
prosecutors asked criminals, parents asked children. "Why?" Greg asked. "Why do 
you count the beggars and not the free breakfasts in the schools? Why mourn all 
the lapses and never celebrate the gains?" 
</P>
<P>
She had tried to answer. "Because people in rags pray in churches decorated 
with gold leaf, because little boys fight to clean your windshield for five 
cents, because families gather to sift the garbage heaps," she told him. 
</P>
<P>
Now here was Mr. Elby asking why she had come back. She told the truth. She 
said, "I don't know." Then added, "Who knows when I can come again? We're in 
Mexico to stay." She superimposed on the hillside where she stood a different 
landscape, a waste of depleted earth and shriveled grain. Greg had taken her to 
such places and, a day later, gone on to an experimental patch of fertile 
ground. Here he would strip an ear of corn and expose the fat, even kernels. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at this," he would tell her at these times, with a conviction that almost 
caused this single ear to multiply until it fed every man, woman and child on 
earth. 
</P>
<P>
He would watch her face. "You don't believe it will happen," Greg said. "Why?" 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth only said, "Remember the summers at the beach? Everyone in town had 
enough to eat. They were all happy," and she would think of ocean sunlight on 
500 happy faces. 
</P>
<P>
But the last time he tried to convince her of the approaching utopia, she had 
answered, "Someday you'll make me believe it," and, standing between the rows 
of corn, had flung her arms around his neck. 
</P>
<P>
To Mr. Elby she said, "Greg is inventing a new kind of corn." 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Elby had nothing to say about the diet of Mexico. He nodded as if, all 
along, he had expected her to settle there. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth gazed at the gray-shingled house, the summer site of her growing up. 
It needed repairs. Paint, at least. Perhaps a new roof. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it empty?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lease on it," he said. "One of them teachers from the new state 
college down the coast." A smile struggled to lift the corners of Mr. Elby's 
mouth. "And the heater leaking water and the oven leaking gas and the faucets. 
. ." He was approaching a delirium of satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth interrupted. "How about the Mannings and the Scotts?" 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Elby collected himself. They faced one another on theroad, the level rays 
of the declining sun still bright on Elizabeth's left side, Mr. Elby's right. 
</P>
<P>
"The Scotts, they're gone. Haven't seen the Mannings or the Millers or the 
what's-their-names, the ones who had the boy that liked dogs. Seems like he 
always had a stray tagging after him." 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Elby was speaking of Billy Ranson, and Elizabeth already knew what had 
become of Billy. His parents were among the friends she hadn't lost. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you remember the time you shot the skunk from that window?" She pointed to 
a second-story corner of the house. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Elby flushed with anger. "I never shot a skunk," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Silence fell. Elizabeth picked a leaf of rosemary from a bush gone wild at the 
edge of the lane. She and Mr. Elby moved out of the way of a passing car. The 
driver waved to Mr. Elby and turned into the Potters' drive. 
</P>
<P>
"Another teacher," said Mr. Elby. "Wait till that old wiring blows a fuse." His 
voice grew firm in anticipation. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to go up to the cabin," Elizabeth told him, and corrected herself. 
"Up to where the cabin used to be." 
</P>
<P>
"I guess you heard about the fire." Mr. Elby shook his head. "Some of these 
kids ought to be run in." 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth rolled the rosemary leaf between her fingers and smelled it. 
Immediately, all her relinquished summers were restored, the ones before Greg, 
the ones with Greg, with one child, with two children. The cabin, built quickly 
and cheaply, had been a firetrap all along, she supposed. It was simple good 
luck that the place burned with no one in it. Even so, as she thought now of 
the sand between the children's sheets, of the hermit crabs surviving overnight 
in jars, of the shells in a bucket and the sage in a glass, of the intimacy and 
isolation of the raw wood structure, Elizabeth suffered a pang. And all four of 
them had been so young. For a second, looking backward, she believed she 
remembered exactly how it had felt. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Elby was thinking about the fire. "These kids," he said. "Do yours take 
drugs?" 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure," Elizabeth said truthfully. The sea glittered silver-blue 
between the pines. "I have to go now. I have to get down to the beach." 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Elby nodded, as if wanting to be on the beach was always reasonable, in any 
season, at any hour. "It's low tide about now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment of parting, she remembered to ask, "How's Mrs. Elby?" 
</P>
<P>
"She's gone." Mr. Elby pulled his bicycle out of the honeysuckle. "It's been 
seven years. Seven or eight." His eyes began to water. "She's in that new 
cemetery." He gestured to an unseen location behind the hill. "Seems like I 
can't keep flowers growing on her grave. The ground squirrels get them." 
</P>
<P>
His voice was shaking. Without saying goodby, he mounted his bicycle, wavered, 
righted himself and, sitting taller than Elizabeth would have thought possible, 
pedaled out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
HALF AN HOUR WAS LEFT BEFORE sunset. To save time she took a shortcut down the 
hill, through the canyon that was littered with eucalyptus pods and bark. At 
the intersection of Seaside and Pine, the business block on the west cast 
shadows halfway across the main street. Elizabeth tried to skirt the drugstore 
without being seen, but Mrs. Nye, on the lookout, tapped on the plate glass 
with her pen. Elizabeth turned back. 
</P>
<P>
An apothecary jar, filled with amethyst liquid, stood as it always had in a 
curtained alcove to the left of the door. The changeless display of dark 
glasses and sand toys crowded the window to her right. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the store, Mrs. Nye examined her through both the upper and lower lenses 
of her bifocals. "You're looking pretty good, Lizzie. You're young yet." 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Nye had trapped her new permanent in a beaded hair net. "Are you back to 
stay?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
"How could I? Someone's burned the cabin down." 
</P>
<P>
"No one burned it down," said Mrs. Nye. "There was a brush fire up there." 
</P>
<P>
"I guess Mr. Elby forgot." 
</P>
<P>
"You've been talking to Bert." Mrs. Nye, as though the month were June, carried 
a beach umbrella to the window. "Bert Elby hasn't been the same since his wife 
died. Sometimes he can't tell the difference between now and year before last." 
She passed Elizabeth a carton of chocolate bars and unwrapped one for herself. 
"They had to take his gun away after he mistook a kid's loose hamster for a 
rat." 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth supposed Mr. Elby was 80. It was harder to tell about Mrs. Nye. She 
was one of those women, double-chinned and sane, who, once past 50, never 
change. 
</P>
<P>
"What did Bert tell you?" she asked Elizabeth. 
</P>
<P>
"About everyone dying or moving away, the Scotts and Mannings and Ransoms. I 
forgot to ask about the Potters. He spoke about college professors who live in 
the houses." 
</P>
<P>
"The Lord God sent those professors to keep us going," said Mrs. Nye. "They 
don't pack up and get out on Labor Day." 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth deciphered the time from a wall clock painted over with a clipper 
under sail. "It's late," she said, and edged away. "I have to see the beach 
again, while there's still light." 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Nye stopped her. "Wait a minute," she said. "I want to tell you what's 
what." 
</P>
<P>
Leaning over the counter between twin pyramids of sun oil and shampoo, she 
brought Elizabeth up to date. 
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Scott's here now with her grandson. Mrs. Manning came down in August with 
her nurse. The captain's been gone a long time. Mr. Si Potter's dead. His car 
hit a tree on a straight piece of road in broad daylight. He always did drive 
too fast." Elizabeth had a second to think, he must have meant to die. Mrs. Nye 
passed the chocolate bars. "Annie Potter, that friend of yours, comes once in a 
while with her two kids. When the marriage split up, they split up four kids. 
He got two and she got two. She rents the loft over the Millers' garage." 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth, fleeing further news, had reached the door. She said goodby. "Thank 
you for the candy," she said, as she so often had in childhood. Her foot was on 
the sidewalk. The shadows of the stores had stretched across the road. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Nye had more to say. "You probably heard about the Ransom boy. Hit when he 
was riding his motorcycle on the freeway." She paused to remember Billy. 
"Whenever he came in here, he left some dog or other barking outside the door 
for him." 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth stepped onto the sidewalk. Sunlight was fading from the roofs on the 
hill. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Nye called after her. "I forgot to ask about your kids." 
</P>
<P>
"They're fine," said Elizabeth. But the children were thousands of miles away. 
She had no proof. 
</P>
<P>
"And that Greg you married?" Mrs. Nye looked sharply at Elizabeth. "Are you two 
still married?" 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth nodded. "We live in Mexico," she said, offering the remark as an 
explanation of anything and everything Mrs. Nye might want to know. She saw 
Greg at tomorrow's conference, in a room with tall windows, a French 
chandelier, a tilting parquet floor. Behind him pressed the starving millions. 
</P>
<P>
"What does he do?" called Mrs. Nye. 
</P>
<P>
"Hungry people," Elizabeth called back. She waved and walked into a gust of 
salt air. 
</P>
<P>
Before arriving at the wooden stairs that led down the bluff to the sand, she 
had time to wonder if anything she had just heard was true. Mrs. Nye had made 
at least one mistake. Billy Ransom didn't die on the reaches of pavement of 
Interstate 10. Seven months after his high school graduation, he was killed in 
an ambush in Vietnam. The brief obituary named his parents as survivors. There 
would be no services, the paper said. Gifts to the Humane Society were 
suggested. 
</P>
<P>
At the top of the steps, Elizabeth clung to the rusty iron rail. The Humane 
Society! she silently exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
THE SUN, ROUND AND HUGE AND ORange was only inches above the horizon. Elizabeth 
left her shoes on the lowest step and walked barefoot toward the water across a 
gleaming landscape of wet sand, passing two by two the exposed piles of what 
was left of the pier. She stood at the ocean's edge while shallow waves rippled 
in and left circles of foam around her feet. Twisting, she looked back at the 
hill. Once it had been easy to see the cabin from here. She imagined she saw 
the chimney now, a blackened square against the sky. 
</P>
<P>
Life on the hill had not been flawless. Elizabeth vaguely recalled the 
occasional tears of children and slammings of adult doors. But the immense 
peace of the place drowned out these events, leaving only a shimmering calm 
behind. Under its protection, days spent at the beach were all alike and ran 
together without distinction. So that, even while being lived, they had seemed 
eternal. 
</P>
<P>
From where she stood now, Elizabeth had watched another sunset 15 years ago. 
Then she had a child at each side, with the shadows of giants lengthening 
behind them. Not far away, Greg talked to a lifeguard who was scanning the surf 
with binoculars. A boat had capsized that morning and two fishermen were 
missing. When seaweed drifted against Elizabeth's foot, she started. She had 
expected a torn sock or the sole of a shoe. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from that, it had been an evening much like this one, of singular 
perfection. Like now, the final second of the day hung on a sliver of sun. 
Sandpipers had tracked the margin of the sea. The lifeguard's binoculars 
tracked the breakers. 
</P>
<P>
Now Elizabeth felt a sudden thudding on the sand. A few feet behind her, a 
solitary jogger ran north. Fifty yards further up the beach, a boy carrying 
swim fins walked out of the waves and headed for the steps. She supposed he was 
Mrs. Scott's grandson, aged about 16, lean of build and badly sunburned, his 
wet hair plastered to his face. Elizabeth saw him smile as he came near. Then 
his happiness spilled over, and he spoke. 
</P>
<P>
"How about this?" he said. "How about it?" Turning, he lifted his hand to the 
evening star, the shore, the water, her.

"The story is a modern-day metaphor for seeking balance. The idea that some 
sense of equality can be achieved by tallying up differences is curious. 
</P>
<P>
"The character doesn't examine what makes her feel out of balance. She never 
questions what's out of balance, but she's looking for artificial ways to 
attain balance. Her mother triggers her looking at things. 
</P>
<P>
"I have always had this sense that my mom could see things -- truths -- that I 
could not. But this is not an autobiographical story. My husband says to let 
people know he's nothing like the character in the book."

THE VETERINARIAN'S DAUGHTER

<P>
IN THE SUMMER OF 1947, THE WEEKS BEFORE CARla's movie began shooting were the 
last days she had before she began her lifetime of work. Because she remembered 
those days the best, she later came to think of them as her childhood, an 
interlude before the cameras rolled and before she became famous. Her face and 
form were still tiny, but an older, knowing creature lurked not far from the 
surface. She seemed perfectly formed, but in miniature, like a pony, or a 
bonsai tree. Her personality was still passive and serene, as if she were 
biding her time, gathering her power. She was 7 -- an age when a child tends to 
take the world as she finds it, but also to assume that the world will always 
be as it is. 
</P>
<P>
For Carla, the MGM lot in Culver City was a school, but for the adults, it was 
a workplace that looked more like a college campus than the factory to which 
the newspapers frequently compared it. The studio was populated with beautiful 
young people looking to take their youth and attractiveness to market and 
powerful older ones who could help them get what they sought. It gave the place 
a lubricious air, thick with hormones and availability. Rapaciousness was 
always there, hanging in the air as permanently as the heat. The studio was an 
erotic countinghouse and Carla would grow up in it, absorbing its customs and 
values through her pores. The studio would make her, and it would do the job 
before she could know it or judge it. 
</P>
<P>
In preparation for what was to be the first of many Dr. George movies, in which 
Carla would play the veterinarian's daughter, Metro installed a barnyard 
menagerie. Carla was encouraged to get to know the horses, cows, ducks, 
chickens and pigs. She was also enrolled in Metro's Little Red School House, 
which was neither little nor red, but a white stucco bungalow with a tiled roof 
and Spanish arches. 
</P>
<P>
When Carla started at the school, the other contract players her age were Sarah 
Milliken and Bobby Dryer. Sarah, an exquisite blonde, had been in several 
musicals and was considered the child with the brightest future. Bobby had the 
child actor's gift of looking younger than his age. He was tolerated by Sarah 
only because he was a contract player. Sarah always brought a hamster named 
Nibbles to class. Although Sarah had a cage for him, Nibbles was usually 
perched on her shoulder. Carla tried to listen in class, but most of the time 
she watched Nibbles as he climbed all over Sarah's back. 
</P>
<P>
On Carla's first morning at the school, Miss Darrington, the principal, 
introduced her to the other students and then turned the elementary 
schoolchildren over to Mr. Danzig, their instructor. Sarah whispered, "We're 
the only girls." Carla could plainly see there were other girls -- some were 
older, teen-agers in other classes, but some were grade-school age as well. As 
Carla was puzzling it through, Mr. Danzig, whom Sarah and Bobby called Skeeter, 
told the children to divide into groups. The day players broke into three 
groups while Sarah, Carla and Bobby stayed together, apart from the others. 
Sarah smiled at Carla, as if to say, "We're the ones who count." Carla knew to 
appear unassuming and to treat Sarah deferentially, as a wise, older sister. 
She knew by instinct that Sarah would be a valuable ally only as long as she 
didn't feel threatened. Carla listened to Sarah and then asked if she could pet 
Nibbles. 
</P>
<P>
"He bites," Sarah said, turning down the request. 
</P>
<P>
"Not me," Carla said, touching the jumpy hamster. "Hi, Nibbles. Want to play at 
the barn?" 
</P>
<P>
"Not allowed," Sarah said, putting him in his cage. 
</P>
<P>
After their morning class of reading and arithmetic, from 9 till noon, the 
children went to lunch at the commissary. They would march across the lot, 
accompanied by Skeeter Danzig, past Stages 21 and 5, left past the prop shop 
and the camera building. Then Skeeter would lead the children into the 
commissary, all green and chrome. On her first day, Carla saw a tattooed man 
eating a hamburger. He wore a robe to protect his costume, but ketchup was 
oozing down his face, dripping onto the purple image of a dragon whose claws 
crawled up the man's neck. "Not real tattoos, only from makeup," Sarah said 
dismissively. Carla nodded, but she wasn't sure about the difference between 
real tattoos and ones from makeup. 
</P>
<P>
The children ate in a special alcove known as the romper room. It was a safe 
distance from the raucous, lewd jokes at the writers' table or the sometimes 
gamy gossip of the publicity table and far from the exclusive precincts of the 
directors' table, which was in a screened porch off the main room and where 
actors and producers as well as directors might be found, laughing and making 
bets on anything from East Coast football games to who might come through the 
door next. Within the romper room, Sarah had asked for and gotten a special 
table for contract players only; day children were not allowed to sit there. 
</P>
<P>
Carla ignored the commissary food -- the steaks, chops, sandwiches and ice 
cream sundaes that everyone else ate. She usually had a few spoonfuls of Mr. 
Mayer's famous chicken soup and part of a fruit salad. She stuffed her pockets 
with sugar lumps from the bowl and carrot curls and apple slices from her 
salad, and pieces of matzo, a box of which sat on every table. After lunch, 
when Sarah and Bobby went off to the sound stages or their locations, Carla 
went to visit her animals. No child was supposed to go anywhere unattended, so 
a studio car, a Packard limousine, waited for her outside the commissary. As 
she rode through the studio streets, she sat up on her knees so she could watch 
out the back window for actors in costume. Sometimes she saw a few, but usually 
it was only grips on bicycles and a few young actors preening for one another 
and taking the sun. 
</P>
<P>
The barn, the part of the MGM lot Carla liked the most, was actually a Quonset 
hut with stalls and pens, installed on Lot 3, far from the Little Red School 
House. The director of animal services, the head wrangler, was Norman Katano, 
and he had been told to encourage Carla to play with the animals every day. 
Norman usually dressed in denim overalls with baggy, grass-stained knees. Even 
though the studio kept a large crew of greensmen, Norman was frequently on his 
knees with a hand-spade, turning over Mr. Mayer's earth, or pruning Mr. Mayer's 
rosebushes. It had been Norman's idea to have Carla name the animals. Ever 
since her own name had been changed from Karen Teitel, she had been interested 
in names. She had given most of the animals human names -- there was a duck 
named Mary Anne and a rooster named Bob; a cow had been named Elsie, after the 
Borden trademark. 
</P>
<P>
In the last weeks of pre-production, the studio acquired a horse, a sweet 
looking 5-year-old roan that Carla was to ride in the picture. Carla had 
planned to call him Dobbin, a name her mother had suggested, but when she saw 
him with his reddish flanks, heavy coat and deep, sad eyes, she blurted out, 
"Hi, Lewis, want a cracker?" She held out a matzo that Lewis nibbled. He then 
lapped up the crumbs in her palm with his gritty tongue. 
</P>
<P>
"He likes you," Norman said, relieved. "That's what you call him? Lewis?" 
</P>
<P>
"And he calls me Carla." 
</P>
<P>
"Want to ride him?" Despite the fact that Carla turned a little shy at the 
prospect, Norman could see she very much wanted to ride him. He brought an 
apple box for a step, and helped her up onto Lewis' back. He led horse and 
rider out of the Quonset hut to the barnyard. Norman walked Lewis in widening 
circles while Carla sat atop her new friend, her legs spread wide across his 
flanks. She leaned forward and dropped her arms around Lewis' neck and lay her 
head against his mane. Norman watched as Carla rubbed herself against Lewis, 
letting the horse's warmth become part of her. Had she been a little older it 
might have made her self-conscious; any younger and she might not have felt the 
pull and physical sensation of the horse. 
</P>
<P>
"You like horses or you just like Lewis?" Norman asked. Carla was too involved 
with the feeling of Lewis' muscles against her legs and chest to hear the 
question. For that moment, she wanted to melt her own body into Lewis'. Since 
that wasn't possible, she was happy to squeeze him with her legs, hug his neck 
and push her tiny face into his mane. 
</P>
<P>
Carla was frequently called away from her afternoons with Lewis for makeup and 
wardrobe tests and occasionally for screen tests with candidates to play her 
father. Although Maury Kelman's script still wasn't finished, one scene -- Dr. 
George and his daughter in their living room -- was declared ready enough for 
tests. With Maury's help, Carla learned the dialogue and then shot six versions 
of it in one day. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the actors was experienced, so the purpose of the test wasn't to see if 
they could act, but how they looked and interacted with Carla. Only Brandon 
Holt, a character man who had been around Hollywood since the silent days, 
stood out. Holt was 50, which was old for the role, but it seemed to give him 
additional wisdom. If he and Carla had what Fred Nugent, the Metro executive 
who had hired Carla, called "chemistry," Brandon Holt would be Dr. George. 
Brandon looked good because he had improvised a moment in the middle of the 
test. Even Maury Kelman, who had a screenwriter's distaste for improvisation, 
liked it. In the scene, after Carla told her father she didn't know where his 
medical bag was, Brandon walked over to Dr. George's old upright piano, making 
the camera follow him, and played "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" and sang the 
words known by every piano student: 
</P>
<P>
 Papa Haydn's dead and gone, but his melody lingers on 
</P>
<P>
It made Carla laugh, and for a brief moment the scene came alive. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Nugent asked Claire Berger, Carla's agent, to assess Carla's feelings. 
"She doesn't have veto power or anything," he told her. "But find out if she 
likes the guy. If you think they'll get along." 
</P>
<P>
The next day, after lunch, Claire went to the barn, and while Carla was riding 
Lewis, she walked along next to them, holding the reins. 
</P>
<P>
"Was it fun to make the tests?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
"It's OK." 
</P>
<P>
"Not as much fun as making a movie, though. Is it?" 
</P>
<P>
"Is Lewis going to be in the movie?" 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely. You like Lewis, don't you?" 
</P>
<P>
"Hi, Lewis," Carla said, leaning down and speaking directly into the horse's 
ear. It made Lewis shake his mane. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you remember the last test you did?" 
</P>
<P>
"Which one?" 
</P>
<P>
"With Brandon Holt. For your father. Do you remember?" 
</P>
<P>
"I think." 
</P>
<P>
"It was the scene in the house. Where he can't find his bag and he thinks you 
know where it is." 
</P>
<P>
"That's the one we do all the time." 
</P>
<P>
"But the last time you did it was with Brandon Holt. The tall man who played 
the piano." 
</P>
<P>
"He was nice." 
</P>
<P>
"Would you like to be in the movie with him?" 
</P>
<P>
"OK." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big decision, Carla. Are you sure?" 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know. Ask my dad." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm asking you." 
</P>
<P>
"Is he going to get the part?" 
</P>
<P>
"Possibly. It's important to know if you're comfortable with him." 
</P>
<P>
"Are we going to start pretty soon?" 
</P>
<P>
"Just as soon as we cast Dr. George. What do you think?" 
</P>
<P>
"I have to ask Lewis." She leaned over again into the horse's mane and said, 
"Is the piano guy OK to be Dr. George?" Lewis shook his mane again, reacting to 
her breath in his ear. Carla sat back up on the horse and smiled. "Lewis says 
OK." 
</P>
<P>
And so Brandon Holt, after two decades of character work, became a star. 
</P>
<P>
WHEN MAURY KELMAN'S SCRIPT WAS FINALLY APPROVED and put through the typing 
pool, a reading with the cast was arranged. The director was Bill Brady, a 
studio staff man who had worked on other movies with Maury and the technicians 
assigned to the film. 
</P>
<P>
They sat at a long table set up on Stage 8, where the movie's main interior had 
been built. It was Dr. George's living room, with beamed ceilings, a vast stone 
fireplace and bookshelves filled with leather-bound classics and books about 
animals. A painting of Dr. George's late wife -- serene and saintly, a 
gentle-looking woman who had been given Carla's features -- hung above the 
fireplace, keeping a benign eye on her family. Bill Brady sat at the head of 
the table with Maury on his left. Carla sat next to Brandon Holt, and the other 
actors arranged themselves around the table. Doughnuts, fruit and an urn of 
coffee had been provided by the commissary. 
</P>
<P>
Claire hadn't told Milton, Carla's father, about the reading in order to keep 
him away. As far as Claire was concerned, Milton had become a real pain, and 
the less anybody at the studio saw of him, the better things would be. Carla 
didn't seem concerned that her parents weren't there, which was just fine with 
Claire. The only thing Carla asked about was if Lewis the horse was going to be 
at the reading. When one of the other actors laughed, Carla said, "He has a 
bigger part than you." No one else laughed at Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
Carla could read well enough for her age, but she had always learned her lines 
with her mother's help. This time she turned to Brandon Holt, who was glad to 
assist her. At first, when she stumbled, Bill Brady looked nervous, so Claire 
intervened. "Say it for her, then she'll repeat it." Bill nodded, and when 
Carla had difficulty, she'd listen to Brandon, then repeat what he had said. 
When she had to figure out the words, she spoke in the same sing-song voice 
that all children use when they're learning to read. It terrified the adults 
until she put down the script and repeated what she had just read in the voice 
of the veterinarian's daughter. As long as she didn't have to struggle with the 
reading, her voice was simple and unaffected, direct and always clear. By the 
third time she had done it, Maury Kelman muttered, "Damndest thing I ever saw." 
</P>
<P>
The story Maury had contrived had to be a tale that was interesting and 
compelling on its own and one that could also serve as the basis for a 
continuing series. Dr. George was a rural veterinarian, a recent widower, with 
a little daughter named Georgine. Dr. George had always wanted a son, and now 
that there were just the two of them, little Georgine had to prove to her dad 
that she was just as good as a boy. In the first story and all the others that 
would follow, father and daughter would argue about Georgine's ability to 
assist Dr. George on his rounds of the farms in their area. Each time, little 
Georgine would prove her mettle as father and daughter worked to help birth a 
calf or mend a broken wing. At the end of every movie, Dr. George regretted 
that he ever doubted her. 
</P>
<P>
It always seemed to be summer in the Dr. George movies; the sun always shone 
over the meadow, and the brook always ran clear. No one ever said where the 
farms were, exactly, and the neighboring farmers, the ones with the 
never-ending supply of sick animals, spoke in a mixture of accents. Some seemed 
to be from New England, flinty Vermonters, maybe; others had soft, tidewater 
accents, Virginia gentlemen. Everyone was white and Gentile; every woman was a 
mom who spent her days making supper and wiping her hands on her apron. Dr. 
George drove a pickup truck, but in an emergency, when little Georgine had to 
find her dad, she always rode Lewis the horse. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most character actors of his era, Brandon Holt had never worked on 
Broadway or in the West End. Brandon was a man of the movies, his sense of 
acting purely behavioral. He had never played to a second balcony. Any 
exaggeration was a mistake to Brandon. Since that style was only a more 
developed version of Carla's instinctive mode, they played well together. 
Brandon had a ranch out at the western end of the San Fernando Valley where he 
kept horses. He had a natural feel for the animals, and when he was cast as Dr. 
George, he began seriously learning about veterinary medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Brandon knew as well as anyone at the studio that in the end, the success of 
the movie would come down to two things: the quality of Maury Kelman's script 
and the chemistry between Carla and himself. The script seemed right to him, 
and he knew he could count on Metro to provide good technical support. He had 
no children of his own, and although he usually got along with those he met, 
little Carla was a mystery to him. He would look at her, so tiny and opaque 
with those exquisite features, and think how difficult the movie business was. 
He tried not to dwell on it, but it was hard to keep it out of his mind: His 
career, and as Brandon saw it, the rest of his life, depended on his ability to 
get along with a 7-year-old. He had been with her a few times, and she seemed 
to respond best when he was most genuine. Claire Berger had told him she was 
crazy about her horse and he hoped that would be the way he would win her 
heart. During the last week of pre-production, when Brandon was at the studio 
every day for wardrobe and lighting tests and conferences with Bill Brady, he 
went to the barnyard after lunch, when he knew Carla would be there. He took it 
very slowly, just watching as Carla rode Lewis. She seemed to like Norman 
Katano, the wrangler, so Brandon did his best to be friendly. By the time 
Brandon began coming to the barnyard, Carla could ride Lewis without Norman 
holding the reins. She wasn't allowed to canter, but simply to move at a pace 
that Lewis found comfortable. As Brandon watched, waiting for an opening, Carla 
waved and brought the horse over to where he was standing. "Hi, Daddy," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Hello, Georgine," he answered, feeling a little shiver go down his back when 
she called him Daddy. "How's Lewis today?" 
</P>
<P>
"Ask him." 
</P>
<P>
"Hi, Lewis," Brandon said, speaking softly to the horse and offering a carrot 
from his pocket. Lewis chewed the carrot, then nuzzled Brandon, sniffing him. 
</P>
<P>
"He likes you," Carla said, delightedly. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I certainly like him," Brandon said, keeping his eyes on Carla, hoping 
she would understand they were talking about themselves as much as the horse. 
"Could we ride him together?" 
</P>
<P>
"Ask him." 
</P>
<P>
"Lewis," Brandon said, cooing to the animal, stroking his flanks, "Can I ride 
with Carla? Is that OK?" Lewis shook his head and whinnied. 
</P>
<P>
"OK. He said yes," Carla said. Norman brought the apple box and Brandon mounted 
easily, sitting behind Carla. She leaned back against him as Brandon spoke to 
the horse, urging him to move a little faster. 
</P>
<P>
As they cantered around the barnyard, Brandon leaned forward for a look at 
Carla's face. Her eyes were shining. "Shall we go for a real ride?" he asked. 
Unsure of the proper response, Carla said nothing, but Brandon pulled the reins 
to the right and sent Lewis out of the barnyard onto the lot. "We won't be 
long," he called to Norman, who didn't look pleased with this turn of events. 
</P>
<P>
"Are we going to Lot 4?" Carla asked, assuming they were headed for meadows and 
open fields. 
</P>
<P>
"Nope. We're going to show him the studio." As Carla realized what he meant, 
she began to smile. Brandon fanned out his fingers, which almost covered 
Carla's chest and stomach, and drew her to him. She leaned back, astride Lewis, 
resting against Dr. George, content and comforted. 
</P>
<P>
They trotted back toward Lot 1, where the main business of the studio was 
conducted. Each time Lewis started to slow or let his head dip, Brandon tugged 
on the reins, making him stand upright. "Come on, Lewis, move like a champion." 
He was speaking to the horse, but whispering in Carla's ear. 
</P>
<P>
As they rode past, people on the street stopped to look and point or wave. 
Benny Raskin, the unit publicist assigned to the picture, saw them and yelled, 
"Wait, wait. I gotta get a camera." They ignored him and kept going as Benny 
ran back toward his office, visions of photo spreads in his head. 
</P>
<P>
At the school, Carla shouted, "Hey, Skeeter, come here. Come on." The loudness 
and joy in her voice made Lewis whinny again, and as he did, Skeeter, followed 
by Sarah Milliken and Bobby Dryer, came outside. Skeeter laughed and waved to 
her. "You look great!" he shouted. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby said, "Holy cow!" Sarah just stared and didn't say anything. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's show him our house," Carla said. Brandon laughed and brought Lewis about 
and set off for Stage 8. Bobby Dryer ran after them, enchanted. Even when 
Skeeter called to him, Bobby wouldn't come back. 
</P>
<P>
At the sound stage, Brandon drove Lewis straight through the overhead loading 
door into the cavernous stage. The painting crew finishing the set for 
Georgine's bedroom stopped working and looked up; even the guard, who was not 
paid to have a sense of humor, called out, "Did you change it to a Western?" 
</P>
<P>
They waved and trotted over to the living-room set, where Brandon brought Lewis 
to a gentle halt. "Tell him what this is," he said to Carla. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our house, Lewis. See? You can come in. Just today, because it's 
special." 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, it is," Brandon said softly, thinking he had set out to woo this child 
and instead had himself been seduced, entirely. Behind them, standing in the 
door, Bobby Dryer watched, excited, dancing about, calling, "Hey Carla. Over 
here. Hey." But she paid no attention to him, happy to be lost with her horse 
in her new house with her new father.

"I always thought Hollywood would provide me with a living. What I hadn't 
expected was that it would also provide me with a subject. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to write about the daily life of Hollywood in a way that's more 
realistic than not. Most fiction about the movies falls into two categories: 
angry screeds about the unfairness of the business written mostly by 
disaffected screenwriters. Or supercharged fantasies that try to be about 
glamour -- mostly who wears what and who sleeps with whom. 
</P>
<P>
"My intention is to reflect what actually goes on, and that certainly includes 
anger and glamour, but I hope what I write reveals something of the way the 
business and the people in it really operate."

RESTAURATEUR MEMOIRS BRING BACK SALAD DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS, Colman Andrews writes the Notebook column for the restaurant 
pages of The Times' Sunday Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE MEMOIRS OF restaurateurs and hoteliers make wonderful reading. That's 
partly, I think, because anyone who plies the innkeeper's trade long enough to 
be able to write a memoir is almost certain to have acquired good powers of 
observation, some measure of empathy and a sense of humor along the way -- not 
a bad set of traits for a writer to possess. 
</P>
<P>
But it must also have something to do with the nature of their establishments. 
Restaurants and hotels aren't just places to go for dinner or to spend the 
night. They're microcosms of the society in which they function, reflecting 
social values, echoing fashion, helping to define celebrity. They're 
fascinating institutions; thus their owners have fascinating tales to tell. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, though, these tales don't get told as often as they used to. 
Restaurateurs write cookbooks these days, not affectionate remembrances. Modern 
hoteliers tell readers how they clawed their way to power, not how they charmed 
some particularly difficult guest. (Who'd want to read a memoir of a 900-room 
chain hotel anyway? What would the anecdotes be about? The time the credit-card 
link went down just as 375 chiropodists were trying to check out?) 
</P>
<P>
Happily, a good many splendid hotel and restaurant memoirs from earlier times 
survive. Some of these are straightforward anecdotal histories -- for instance, 
Simone Prunier's 1957 book, "Prunier's, The Story of a Great Restaurant" (whose 
first chapter is called "Paris in the Sixties" -- meaning the 1860s), or 
"Memoirs of a Wayward Inn" by Frank Case (1938), longtime owner of New York's 
famed Algonquin Hotel. (Here is Case on the theatrical profession, toward which 
he was notoriously solicitous: "People of unique abilities are unique 
creatures. . . . When you hear a woman of the theater described as sweet and 
gentle and just like anybody else, so much so that 'you would never know that 
she is an actress,' go to see her in the theater, and it's a pretty good bet 
that she isn't.") 
</P>
<P>
Other memoirs rewrite recollection with a novelist's sense of pace and color -- 
i.e., the hotel and restaurant stories of Ludwig Bemelmans' "Hotel Bemelmans," 
"Tell Them It Was Wonderful" and "La Bonne Table," with their charming 
insouciance and their famous punch lines: The chef of a Viennese restaurant 
that advertised "cutlets from every animal in the world" to a countess who has 
just ordered a cutlet made of elephant: "Madame, I am very sorry, but for one 
cutlet we cannot cut up our elephant." 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the books of George Rector, who ran Rector's restaurant in New 
York City. Rector's might, I suppose, be described as the Spago of 
turn-of-the-century Broadway. Its regulars included O. Henry, Stephen Crane, 
George M. Cohan, John Philip Sousa, Lillian Russell, Oscar Hammerstein and 
Sarah Bernhardt. Death Valley Scotty found his way to the place, Rector 
reports, and ordered "twenty dollars' worth of ham and eggs and a piece of 
pie." Diamond Jim Brady used to book a table for 10, wait for friends to show 
up and then eat all 10 dinners by himself if no one came. Stanford White ate 
his last meal at Rector's a few hours before he was shot to death by Harry K. 
Thaw, whom he had cuckolded. 
</P>
<P>
"Rector's may not have been the centre of population in the late 1890s and the 
early 1900s, but it was the centre of all the population worth knowing. . . . 
(It) was the supreme court of triviality, where who's who went to learn what's 
what. It was the cathedral of froth, where New York chased the rainbow and the 
butterfly netted the entomologist." That's George Rector himself speaking in 
"The Girl from Rector's" (1927). Modesty was not his strong suit. 
</P>
<P>
He is a joy to read, though -- chatty, urbane, amusingly opinionated. Of a 
famous soup, for instance, he explains that "borsch (sic) is to Russia what 
clam chowder is to New England. Everybody eats it, and those who don't eat it 
rub it into their hair." Elsewhere, he reminds us that "baked potatoes and 
steak are old college chums," and he notes disapprovingly that some people, in 
roasting wild duck, "grasp the duck firmly by the neck, hold it up to the fire 
and say: 'Duck, meet the fire. Fire, meet the duck,' and then serve." Iced tea, 
he says, is "the finest iced drink that ever . . . kept a perspiring husband 
and an overheated wife from deciding it was all a hideous mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of summer fare, in "Dine at Home with Rector" (1934), Rector offers 
his recipe for potato salad -- learned, he says, from an unnamed chef who was 
"the best artist in creamed potatoes who ever approached a stove on this side 
of the Atlantic." Potato salad first became popular in this country in the late 
19th Century, in both cold and hot (or "German") versions. Most recipes for the 
former call for the potatoes to be cubed and then tossed immediately with a 
mayonnaise-based dressing. Rector's is rather different -- and the results are 
quite delicious. Here is the recipe, in a slightly edited version of Rector's 
own words: 
</P>
<P>
"You boil potatoes with their jackets on till tender, then peel them quickly 
and put them in a bowl. Dive into them with a couple of big forks, stabbing and 
pulling crosswise until they're all broken up coarse and grainy. Give them our 
special family French dressing (see below) to drink, in proportions of a third 
of a cup to six medium potatoes, and let them marinate. When the dressing has 
permeated every atom, throw in half a cup of blanched almonds sliced very thin, 
a couple of tablespoons of fine chopped onion and another couple of tablespoons 
of fine chopped green peppers. Mix it thoroughly and chill it off in the 
refrigerator. Just before serving, mix in a whole cup of chilled mayonnaise and 
a tablespoon of fine chopped parsley and serve it on lettuce with paprika 
sprinkled here and there for garnish." 
</P>
<P>
Rector adds two helpful notes: "Mutilating your potatoes while they're still 
hot and 'floury' gets rid of that appalling toughness to which the cold boiled 
potato is generally subject when sliced with a knife. And your cold boiled 
spuds needn't go to waste because you don't use them in potato salad; cold 
boiled is the best possible start on hashed brown, and I have yet to meet 
anybody who looked cross-eyed at hashed brown." 
</P>
<P>
The "family French dressing" that Rector calls for is made like this: "Rub two 
teaspoons of salt, a teaspoon of fresh ground pepper, a teaspoon of paprika, 
half a teaspoon of powdered sugar, half a teaspoon of powdered mustard and a 
few grains of cayenne all together in the bottom of a bowl. Then slowly drip in 
a cup of olive oil, stirring all the time until the dry stuff is emulsified. 
Into that, drip a quarter of a cup of vinegar, also stirred vigorously. Taste 
it, making sure your sample is thoroughly mixed, and make your own improvements 
on that base."

Irvin Kershner ("The Empire Strikes Back") replaces Tim Hunter ("River's Edge") 
as director of Orion's "RoboCop II," which goes before the cameras next month. 
Peter Weller and Nancy Allen return in Frank Miller's screenplay produced by 
Jon Davison. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas reteam this fall in Columbia's 
"Hardboiled," as, respectively, star and producer. The Becky Johnston thriller 
has Turner as a female private eye whose latest case has her posing as a man to 
ferret out a killer. Douglas' Stonebridge Productions is negotiating with David 
Anspaugh ("Hoosiers") to direct. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Hopper will direct Don Johnson, who'll play a drifter who takes a job as 
a car salesman in a Midwestern town, in Orion's "Hot Spot." The dark tale -- 
Johnson becomes embroiled with two women in a conspiracy of murder and robbery 
-- films in Texas in August. Charles Williams adapted his novel, "Hell Hath No 
Fury," and Paul Lewis produces. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Jamie Lee Curtis has a supporting role next month in New Vision's "Queen's 
Logic" as a flipped-out Californian in the ensemble piece starring Joe 
Mantegna, John Malkovich, Kevin Bacon and Linda Fiorentino. Steve Rash ("The 
Buddy Holly Story") directs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Daphne Ashbrook portrays Sylvester Stallone's sister and Kurt Russell's 
romantic interest in Warners' "Setup." Jack Palance and Michael J. Pollard are 
the crime czars who do what the title implies to the star cops in Randy 
Feldman's screenplay, directed by Andrei Konchalovsky. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Entertainment Tonight's" Leonard Maltin gets his cuddly image contrasted with 
the diabolical cast of Warners' "Gremlins II," with a cameo appearance in the 
currently filming sequel. Ironically, Maltin panned the original, so expect 
director Joe Dante to exact some artistic revenge. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Zane, appearing in Trans World's "Bad Influence," is actor Billy Zane's 
sister -- not his wife, as we reported last week. Zane's wife is 
Australian-born actress Lisa Collins-Zane. LEONARD KLADY

ROSENTHAL IS A familiar name to buyers of fine china and crystal. For that 
firm, Milanese designer Marcello Morandini has created the Morandini Alphabet 
line of Rosenthal china; wearing his architect hat, he designed Rosenthal's 
headquarters in West Germany. He also designs carpets, which were hailed in a 
recent issue of the Italian design periodical Abitare as some of the most 
original of our time. Heretofore, Morandini has been an unknown quantity on 
this side of the Atlantic, but his new Corner shelving unit should end that 
obscurity. 
</P>
<P>
Corner presents an ingenious solution to an old problem. When traditional 
shelving turns a corner, part of the shelving becomes inaccessible. By angling 
the uprights so that books stand at varying angles, Morandini was able to avoid 
such wastage. Indeed, the 7-foot-tall unit, which lists for about $4,100, 
stands only 11 inches from the wall, yet can accommodate 15-inch-deep books. A 
witty touch is the set of six storage drawers with bright, primary-color 
rectangles that play off against the frame's monochrome minimalism. The effect 
intentionally mimics the work of early 20th-Century Dutch painter Piet 
Mondrian, whose brightly colored rectangles within black grids still inspire 
graphic artists. 
</P>
<P>
But calling Corner a shelving unit hardly does it justice: Finished on all 
sides, the piece also makes a stunning room divider. The complex shadows cast 
by all those 45-degree angles, the various zigzag and stepped shapes of the 
shelves and the overall effect of Corner's complicated geometry make it a 
lovely sculptural object. Says Massoud Amini, whose Massini showroom imports 
Rosenthal furniture to North America: "Half of our clients buy Corner to use as 
a bookshelf; the rest want it as a room divider for, say, their kitchen-dining 
area." 
</P>
<P>
Corner units can be seen at the Massini showroom in the Pacific Design Center, 
Los Angeles; telephone (213) 652-1060.

At the risk of appearing ignorant, I have to know if "The Red Room," by Paul 
Paree (May 21), is a true story. The story starts out like a bit of fiction 
about paint or decorating, then becomes quite disturbing. Please let me know if

HIGH FLYING BIRDS

You can tell a lot about a chef from the fried chicken he or she cooks. If, 
that is, you can find a chef who cooks fried chicken. 
</P>
<P>
Most real chefs don't consider the dish worthy of them. But I do remember 
having a particularly opulent fried chicken once at Trumps. Chef Michael 
Roberts had stuffed foie gras under the skin, then battered the bird and fried 
it. It was probably a dish that shortened your life every time you tasted it, 
which may be why the fried chicken that is now on Trumps menu is sans foie 
gras. 
</P>
<P>
It's still a pretty flamboyant bit of bird -- large, heavily battered and fried 
so crisp it has an audible crunch. It comes with very good mashed potatoes and 
gravy, and excellent slightly bitter greens. The chicken itself, however, while 
moist and tender, is so heavily battered that it just doesn't have much taste. 
Close your eyes and it could be fried anything. 
</P>
<P>
Duplex is one of the few other upscale restaurants in town that offers fried 
chicken every night. But chef Mark Carter makes a different sort of bird. 
There's nothing flamboyant about his modest plate of fried chicken; in fact it 
looks exactly like something your Aunt Millie might have made. This homey 
chicken is not too heavily battered and has a nice sprinkling of salt on the 
outside of the skin. It comes with fine homemade cole slaw too, and would be a 
perfect choice on a night you really wanted fried chicken but were paralyzed by 
fear of frying. 
</P>
<P>
The very best fried chicken I've ever tasted? Without question it was the one 
made by Judy Rodgers at the Union Hotel in Benicia, just north of San 
Francisco. What made this chicken special was that once you got beneath the 
crisp coating your teeth bit into moist flesh that shot a rush of pure chicken 
flavor into your mouth. Judy Rodgers is now at San Francisco's Zuni Cafe, where 
the only chicken she cooks is baked in a wood-burning oven. But I called to ask 
what she had done to make her fried chicken so special. "Nothing really," she 
said. "We used chickens that had some character to begin with, but the main 
thing is that I cured them in rock salt for two hours. I believe that the salt 
concentrates the flavor and makes the chicken both firmer and more tender. Then 
I rinsed off the salt and soaked the chicken in buttermilk for another two 
hours to extract the salt. After that I dried the pieces of chicken and floured 
them and then let them rest for four to eight hours until they got a hard 
crust. And then I fried them -- very carefully." RUTH REICHL

BIRDS WITH SOUL

The same factors that make fried chicken the most democratic of foods also make 
it among the hardest to judge. Where barbecue is Dionysian -- one slab of ribs 
might dazzle with intense smokiness, another with jerkylike texture, a third 
with its peppery sauce -- fried chicken is Apollonian, always measured against 
a classical ideal. Any minimally good fried chicken will be moist but not oily, 
encased in a thin golden crust, and seasoned in a way that enhances but does 
not overwhelm the delicate taste of the meat. Even a perfect plate of chicken 
may not leap out and peck you on the nose as a paradigm. 
</P>
<P>
For a cook, fried chicken is a level playing field, dependent less on the cost 
of ingredients than on their honesty, demanding more sensitivity than formal 
training. Chicken carefully fried at home will always taste best -- chicken 
must be cooked slowly, restaurant food served quickly -- but while no fast-food 
joints serve decent fried chicken, nearly all soul-food joints do. 
</P>
<P>
What's hard to find is great fried chicken. Fowl play! 
</P>
<P>
So when I realized three of the soul-food restaurants loved best had gone to 
the great greens pot in the sky, I had to restrain myself from rushing rightout 
to the fourth, which is in Atlanta, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
Even in New Orleans things aren't the same. Last year, I found soul-food master 
Buster Holmes leaning against a counter in the sterile shopping center where he 
now runs the fast-food gumbo concession. ("Oh no," Buster said, "Can't do that 
chicken here. They'd throw me right out of the mall with all that garlic.") 
</P>
<P>
When somebody torched the chicken shack that made not only the spiciest crust 
in Los Angeles but my all-time favorite dirty rice, it took me a month or two 
to stop muttering about the death penalty for arsonists. I resolved to find 
something as good as the late Cyril's or Dorothy's Soul Nook, even if I had to 
devote the better part of a week to eating fried chicken. 
</P>
<P>
Did I wing it? I did: 21 chickens in all. 
</P>
<P>
I ate chicken wings and grits at the Boulevard Cafe down by the Crenshaw Mall, 
and afterwards a chicken snack at Bertha's, where the musky greens are fine; I 
drove to Green's in Hollywood for its all-you-can-eat chicken special, which 
was, er, bountiful, and to Ruth Reichl's house for a franchise-chicken 
taste-off that seemed a little like Schick Center avoidance therapy for 
fried-chicken abuse. I wrapped a waffle around a crisp chicken leg at Roscoe's 
Chicken and Waffles and dragged it through maple syrup. (It sounded like a good 
idea at the time.) 
</P>
<P>
I had lunch at Stevie's on the Strip, which looks like a fast-food place but 
isn't all that fast and has surprisingly good smoked fried-chicken as well as 
awesome black-eyed peas. I went to Jay's Family Soul Food &amp; Car Wash in 
Compton, where I discovered they had no fried chicken at all. 
</P>
<P>
Soul-fried chicken is not really a sit-down restaurant kind of food in Los 
Angeles, and people will often confess they haven't gone out for it in years. 
The swankiest soul kitchens, Joshua's (on Manchester) and Harold &amp; Belle's 
(on Jefferson), don't serve the stuff at all. So where's the best? 
</P>
<P>
When pressed, a shop owner in Inglewood or a schoolteacher in Lynwood will 
probably direct you to the extremely suburban Aunt Kizzy's Back Porch (4325 
Glencoe Ave., Marina del Rey; (213) 578-1005), a close local equivalent to a 
respectable Southern tearoom. There are at least some ferns here, and lemonade 
served in Mason jars. You wait in a line that snakes from the door, past a 
giant diorama picturing the owners with various Lakers and television stars, to 
the steam table where you order cafeteria style. The fried chicken is big and 
meaty like the clientele -- on weekends it looks as if half the tables are 
taken up with outsize bodybuilders -- but the crust is often doughy and bland. 
Great macaroni and cheese, though. Meat loaf or smothered chicken in oniony 
gravy, dishes that hold a while, might be better choices. 
</P>
<P>
Maurice's Snack 'n Chat (5553 W. Pico Blvd., L.A.; (213) 931-3877) is where a 
screenwriter will take you for chicken, the kind of place you might see Gavin 
McLeod spooning up banana pudding or Chad Everett basking in the carefully 
calculated funk. (Snack 'n Chat is by far the most expensive soul-food joint in 
town, but at $10 it's still pretty cheap.) Pan-fried bird is cut up into 
weirdly shaped pieces here, possibly so Tone-Loc can eat it with a knife and 
fork when he comes in. And though the greaselessness might make the chicken 
seem a little dry at first, each bite bursts with fresh flavor. This could be 
as close as fried chicken ever gets to health food, a leg up on the 
competition. Corn muffins are exceptional, crisp-crusted and melting, and 
remember to order the phenomenal corn pudding they call spoonbread when you 
reserve (at least two hours in advance). 
</P>
<P>
From the street, Mae's (6200 S. Crenshaw Blvd., L.A.; (213) 971-9227) is the 
most forbidding of restaurants, a fortified grim gray building attached to a 
grim gray motel on a grim gray stretch of Crenshaw, but come on in; it's 
cheerful inside. When your hen finally shows up -- it takes 20 minutes to a 
half hour, which is an encouraging sign -- the wizened little limbs might look 
forbidding, dirt-brown and wrinkly, but the sandy, peppery crust conceals moist 
fresh meat, among the best birds in town. You get a stack of savory cornmeal 
pancakes with it. A clear case of not judging a cluck by its cover. 
</P>
<P>
The Trendy Cafe (4769 W. Adams Blvd., L.A.; (213) 733-9275) -- on the site of 
the old Chef Rose Eat Shop, where I once saw Aretha Franklin drink a glass of 
lemonade -- has cactus in the window, its lamp shades still covered with 
plastic and only two autographed photos on the clean wall, one of them of the 
guy who does weather on Channel 5. There's a Ghettoburger on the menu ("That 
means it comes with fries," the waiter said). The tart black-eyed peas are the 
best in town. And the fried chicken? Huge pieces; crunchy, spicy crust not shy 
of garlic; juicy but not that spurting thing that happens sometime; full-on 
taste of bird. JONATHAN GOLD

BIRD IN A MELTING POT

<P>
Fried chicken may be as American as apple pie, but that doesn't mean other 
cultures don't share our finger-lickin' obsession. Herewith, a survey of L.A.'s 
ethnic fried chicken specialists. 
</P>
<P>
When a place bills itself as "The House That Fried Chicken Built," as Max's of 
Manila does, you expect extraordinary chicken. At least, I did. I was even 
hoping to find my favorite Filipino snack, chicharrones de pollo -- crunchy 
deep-fried chicken skin. I found neither. 
</P>
<P>
Max's fried chicken is simple, almost unseasoned, lightly crusted and little 
more than acceptable. You can dress up Max's chicken with the accompanying 
banana catsup -- a sweet and sour condiment made from bananas, garlic and 
vinegar that appears on every table in catsup-type bottles. But the chicken 
here is certainly nothing that would entice anyone to take a midnight drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Max's of Manila, 3575 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles, (213) 384-3043. Open 
Monday-Thursday 7:30 a.m.-10:30 p.m., Friday-Sunday 7:30 a.m.-11:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 I had better luck with Furaibo, a 60-restaurant Japanese chain with a branch 
in Gardena. Furaibo serves teba saki chicken, which is based on a classic 
Japanese recipe called toriniku tatsuta-age -- fried chicken that's been 
marinated before cooking. 
</P>
<P>
At Furaibo, the chicken parts are scored deeply to better absorb the marinade's 
flavor. A faint mist of flour coats the chicken's exterior and forms a thin, 
crackly surface as the chicken is cooked. Like most well-executed Japanese 
fried dishes, this chicken seems as though it hasn't been cooked in oil at all. 
</P>
<P>
Teba-saki chicken comes in a range of flavors, from sweet to extra spicy. And 
you can be picky about which chicken parts you eat: Choose from Tarzan (half a 
chicken), Jane (a chicken breast), Chita (the leg and thigh) or Teba (a whole 
order of wings). The take-out orders are wrapped up like o-bento in colorful 
printed paper, and they come with rice and pickles -- basics of any Japanese 
meal -- plus a shredded cabbage salad. 
</P>
<P>
 Furaibo, 1741 W. Redondo Beach Blvd. (in Tozai Plaza), Gardena. (213) 
329-9441. Open Tuesday-Sunday 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m., 5 p.m.-11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few blocks away from Furaibo is Rokumeikan. This is probably Los 
Angeles' only full-fledged "cutlet parlor" or tonkatsu-ya. All over Japan, 
tonkatsu-ya are popular for quick lunches and inexpensive dinners. Pork, 
breaded and deep-fried, is the big business at a tonkatsu-ya, but most serve a 
wide variety of other cutlets, including shrimp, salmon, ground beef and, of 
course, chicken. 
</P>
<P>
Rokumeikan's chicken cutlet is, in fact, one of the best versions of fried 
chicken I have tasted. Unlike the batter-fried tempura or the dry-fried 
kara-age employed at Furaibo, the food is breaded with panko, irregularly 
shaped bread crumbs that, when fried, give each item a flaky pastrylike 
surface. A pitcher of Japanese Worcestershire sosu -- it looks like teriyaki 
sauce but the taste is more piquant -- is always presented with the cutlets. 
You can also munch on a devastatingly good appetizer of kara-age-style fried 
chicken wings, and all of Rokumeikan's cutlet dinners include soup and rice. 
</P>
<P>
 Rokumeikan Cutlet Parlor, 15607 S. Normandie Ave. (Inside the Travelodge 
Motel), Gardena. (213) 324-4477. Open for lunch Monday -Friday 11 a.m.-2 p.m.; 
dinner Monday-Friday 5:30 p.m.-9:45 p.m., Saturday-Sunday 5:30 p.m.-9:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't be alarmed if the fried chicken you've ordered at Borobudur Garden comes 
to your table looking quite black -- indeed almost burnt. It's the Ketjap 
manis, a thick, sweet molasseslike soy sauce in Borobudur's marinade that gives 
the chicken its dark ominous appearance -- and its addictive sweet-salty 
flavor. The marinade is left clinging to the bird as it cooks; then it 
caramelizes, resulting in a crispy exterior without any sort of batter or 
coating. 
</P>
<P>
I should explain that Borobudur Garden is an Indonesian restaurant specializing 
in noodle dishes and, yes, fried chicken. This chicken is so good that most 
people who order the quarter fried chicken with rice and salad ($2.75) 
invariably wish they'd ordered the half chicken for $3.75 -- or perhaps two 
halves since the chicken is sold to go and is just as appealing cold. 
</P>
<P>
Borobudur's mie dishes (thin egg noodles) and ketoprak (rice noodles) with a 
peanut-tamarind sauce, are sublime. But the restaurant's lackluster version of 
the Indonesian salad gado gado, would be a good dish to miss. 
</P>
<P>
 Borobudur Garden, 821 W. Las Tunas Drive, San Gabriel, (818) 281-6521. Open 
Tuesday-Sunday 11 a.m.-9 p.m.

The enormous plaster rooster on the roof makes it hard to miss Slavko's Harbor 
Poultry. The place has been around since 1922 when chickens were sold live, 
butchered and plucked to order on the premises. But it wasn't until the '50s, 
when competition from supermarkets was squeezing out independent sellers, that 
shop owner Slavko Frlekin bought equipment to fry chicken for his customers. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't like the seasoning that could be purchased with the equipment so he 
concocted his own. Dad loved to cook," says present owner, Jim Frlekin, who is 
Slavko's son. 
</P>
<P>
Almost as famous as Slavko's chickens are its potato "nuggets." These unpeeled 
potato chunks are dusted with Slavko's special seasoning and deep fried to a 
turn. Slavko's also sells better-than-average coleslaw and potato salad. The 
shop has take-out food only. 
</P>
<P>
 Slavko's Harbor Poultry, 1224 S. Pacific Ave., San Pedro, (213) 832-5723 or 
(213) 832-8171. Open Tuesday-Sunday 9 a.m.-6:30 p.m.

MINIMALISM DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I agree with the atonalists' argument that minimalism, at its worst, is a far 
too simple reaction to the complexity and austerity of atonality. However, I 
strongly disagree with their assertion that as atonal/serial composers they are 
the sole representatives of High-Art. 
</P>
<P>
They seem to forget the words of the ultimate atonal master, Schoenberg, who 
realized that atonality/serial techniques were not for everyone and that 
(great) music would still be composed in C major.

ART OF ART CRITICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding William Wilson's June 18 article about "The Dada and Surrealist 
Word-Image" show at LACMA: Could Calendar please hire an art critic who will 
discuss things such as composition, medium and context instead of the car in 
front of him as he was leaving the museum? 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's condescending, self-absorbed efforts to prove he is just as clever and 
hip as the artist he writes around are tiresome. 
</P>
<P>
He is guilty of what he so often criticizes in exhibit catalogues: Artspeak and 
obfuscation: "In the big picture, the dilemma of the modern artist has been 
that history lopped off his traditional function." Say what?

MINIMALISM DEBATE

<TEXT>
<P>
Concerning Donna Perlmutter's "The Growing Debate Over Minimalism," June 18: 
</P>
<P>
The eminent British composer Benjamin Britten, who was not an academician and 
certainly not a minimalist, was asked during an interview about the various 
compositional styles of the 20th Century. He replied that "the important thing 
is not what style a person composes in but whether the chap has anything to 
say." 
</P>
<P>
It seems that about all the academicians and minimalists have to say are 
commentaries they give about their music.

MINIMALISM DEBATE

<TEXT>
<P>
Who says atonality is dead? It's just reared its head in Philip Glass' 
minimalist brain, but Glass is too flip to recognize the populist craving for 
12-tone arpeggios. 
</P>
<P>
At least, that's the impression one gets from Perlmutter's interviews with 
composers Charles Wuorinen, John Adams, George Perle and David del Tredici, who 
lay the blame on Arnold Schoenberg, for the fall of music as Beethoven 
understood it. 
</P>
<P>
I guess one thing really needed in music is humor, and perhaps, at last, 
minimalism has answered our prayers. Million-dollar commissions for Steve Reich 
-- that is funny.

You watched the series, you bought the T-shirt and you've seen the movie. Now 
Batman is moving into the art world. 
</P>
<P>
Mayer-Schwarz Gallery and Galerie Michael in Beverly Hills will present a dual 
exhibition of original art by Batman creator Bob Kane later this month, marking 
the 50th anniversary of the creation of the Caped Crusader. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibits will feature original oils on canvas by Kane, as well as gouaches 
on paper, pen-and-ink sketches and limited-edition graphics. Kane said the 
exhibit will have "all the original comic book characters and villains," with 
an emphasis on Batman and the Joker. 
</P>
<P>
On July 12, the exhibits will be inaugurated at Mayer-Schwarz with a party from 
7 to 10 p.m. that benefits the American Child Foundation, a Los Angeles-based 
group dedicated to introducing and educating children about the arts. Tickets 
are $25. 
</P>
<P>
A concurrent party at Galerie Michael will be private and open only to the 
gallery's supporters and patrons. Kane will appear at both functions. 
Thereafter, all the art will be on exhibit at Galerie Michael. The exhibit will 
continue through Aug. 1 and be open to the public.

LEGENDS IN PERFORMANCE: "Art to Heart," a performance art series, will offer 
its second installment of performances Saturday and July 8 at the 73 Market 
Street Theater in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
"Art to Heart" is a series of conversations between actors impersonating 
performers and artists from various eras, presented by Los Angeles painter 
Ariel Heart in conjunction with Carine Fabius. The first "Art to Heart" 
featured unscripted conversation and audience questions with painters James 
McNeill Whistler, Eugene Delacroix and Alice Neel. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend's installment will feature actors Douglas J. Marsalli, Judith 
Piquet and Chris Kinkaid as, respectively, Frederic Chopin, Cass Elliot and Jim 
Morrison. 
</P>
<P>
"Americans are very concerned about the level of education in this country," 
Fabius said. "I feel that if it were made a little more interesting, using 
imaginative techniques like this, we could educate not only children but adults 
who want to know a little more about artists who they might or might not be 
familiar with." 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with their stated goal of "education, performance, art," Fabius and 
Heart are videotaping the "Art for Heart" performances for public-access 
broadcasting and later use in schools. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets are $10 and reservations are essential. Performances are at 8 and 10 
p.m. For information, contact Barbara at (213) 668-2588.

NEIMAN AT HIS LEISURE: LeRoy Neiman, the artist best known for his vibrant 
color fields, sports paintings and close association with Playboy publisher 
Hugh Hefner, is the subject of a major show running at the Dyansen Gallery in 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Prices for Neiman's work have escalated during the recent art market boom. A 
collection of 60 original paintings, which made its debut at Dyansen's New York 
gallery May 3, drew first-day sales in excess of $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Entitled "Man at His Leisure," the Beverly Hills exhibit features some of the 
same paintings seen in New York, along with others added specifically for the 
Los Angeles exhibition. The paintings are drawn from the 1950s, '60s and '70s 
-- and the Los Angeles and New York collections combined make up one-quarter of 
Neiman's lifetime work. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit will close July 13. 
</P>
<P>
Dyansen Gallery, 339 N. Rodeo Drive, Beverly Hills. (213) 275-0165. Open 11 
a.m. to 6 p.m. Sundays and Mondays, and 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Tuesdays through 
Saturdays.

PARENTS LOOKING for help keeping young guests happy and entertained during a 
birthday party will find many companies and individuals who furnish clowns, 
pony rides and cartoon characters. A few offer distinctive services for an 
out-of-the-ordinary birthday experience. 
</P>
<P>
Parties by Panda-monium will deliver a gym with apparatus including mats, a 
rolling donut, air log, tumbling mats and ball pit. Two staff members lead the 
activities and spot for safety. Parties can be suited for toddlers or junior 
gymnasts or for physically or mentally handicapped children. Also offered: 
"wet" parties with water balloons and three educational magic shows. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County-based Robot Co. provides a dancing, spinning robot who gives 
rides and plays hide-and-seek. The robot projects children's voices to sound 
like such characters as John Wayne and Alvin the Chipmunk or anything in 
between; older youngsters may be permitted to operate the robot's controls. 
Dance-on-Wheels does custom-designed parties, such as a "Dirty Dancing" party 
or a '50s-theme party. Children can be anything from hatching dinosaur eggs to 
tea-party guests dressed in antique clothing. Sugar Free Fun Catering offers a 
variety of cakes and ice cream sweetened without refined sugar or artificial 
sweetners. The company will also prepare the entire menu: Build-your-own-pizza 
parties are popular. The company often joins forces with Dance-on-Wheels, but 
either can be retained individually. 
</P>
<P>
For something entirely different, The Lizard Lady brings her traveling reptile 
petting zoo. After introducing children to each lizard or snake, she invites 
the youngsters to hold the animal. Many kids and even some adults like to 
"wear" Sheila, an 8-foot python. Parties for Panda-monium, based in Canoga 
Park, charges about $200 for a one-hour event. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the robot from the Robot Co., in Costa Mesa, is $125 per hour for 
the first two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Dance-on-Wheels and Sugar Free Fun Catering are located in Van Nuys. 
Dance-on-Wheels charges $120 and up for a one- to one-and-a-half-hour theme 
party. Sugar Free Fun cakes are priced from $35; one-half gallon of homemade 
ice cream is $15. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lizard Lady, in Van Nuys, charges $100 and up for a 50-minute 
presentation. All performers will travel to most areas of Southern California; 
they may add a mileage surcharge.

IT IS ONE of the ironies of design history that the Biedermeier style, so 
popular today for its simple line and understated elegance, should have 
flourished -- if only during a brief time, from 1815 to 1848 -- against the 
pompous and over-decorated background of the Austrian Empire and the German 
states of the period. The style is notable for clarity of design and superb 
craftsmanship. It was conceived of as a kind of pseudo-elegant decor for the 
bourgeoisie, a much simplified version of the sort of thing that appealed to 
minor German princelings. Thank heaven the middle class could not afford the 
extravagance of the nobility, for we now have a legacy of furniture that is 
particularly appropriate to contemporary interior design. There are many 
charming watercolors of the period in the book, along with numerous color 
photographs illustrating this tasteful 19th-Century furniture. ($55) Sam

SHIP MODELS

<P>
FROM SCANDINAVIAN fiords to the South Pacific, ship models have been made by 
many different civilizations. Among the most fascinating models are the "spirit 
ships" that were buried in Egyptian tombs to assist the dead in crossing the 
Nile. 
</P>
<P>
On long voyages under sail, some seamen passed their leisure time making 
scrimshaw artifacts, while others made smaller versions of the ships on which 
they were serving. Some of the rarest and most interesting models now popular 
were made by French prisoners of war in the 19th Century. During the Napoleonic 
Wars, prisoners in England and Scotland made wonderfully detailed models of 
French and English men-of-war, imaginatively put together from scraps of ivory 
and leftover bones from the cookhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Of great interest to collectors today are models from the 18th and 19th 
centuries, particularly those representations of great sailing ships such as 
Cutty Sark and Flying Cloud and such wonders of the sea as that iron leviathan 
of 1858, the Great Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
Models generally fall into three categories: those made by shipwrights to aid 
in the planning and construction of full-size vessels; elaborate models 
authentic down to the last bolt and the last lashing in the rigging, made for 
advertising and display purposes, and models constructed by hobbyists, many of 
them active (or retired) sailors. 
</P>
<P>
The variety is endless: Viking longboats, Portuguese carracks, Spanish 
galleons, British men-of-war, American tea clippers, paddle-wheel steamers and 
those swift, sleek ocean liners of the 1930s. There are few artifacts more 
romantic or more historical than model ships and, for homes up and down the 
California coastline, few more appropriate or more decorative. 
</P>
<P>
Antique ship models can be found at Millstein's General Store in Los Angeles; 
Dana Book and Navigation Co. in Dana Point; Minney's Ship Chandlery and Vallejo 
Gallery (previously Antiques &amp; Nautical) in Newport Beach; West Sea Co. and 
Maidhof Brothers in San Diego. NEWBOOKS

THE UNREPRESENTED

Harry Bernstein's thought-provoking June 13 column, "Union Nudges L.A. School 
Board Toward Power Sharing," makes a disquieting reference to the composition 
of the soon-to-be-formed central school council. According to the column, the 
only teachers permitted to be on the council would be those belonging to the 
teachers' union. As one concerned with the rights of all teachers I see this 
provision as inimical to the interests of those teachers who choose not to 
spend $400 a year to support a group whose leadership doesn't or can't 
represent everyone.

 Editor's Note: Union teachers are expected to be elected to the central 
council because of the majority that union members command in the school 
system, but nonunion teachers are eligible for election to the council.

NASTY NEWS ON AWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mean-spirited is the way to describe the advertising "awards" handed out by the 
Center for Science in the Public Interest ("Deceit Brings Dishonor to the Worst 
Ads of '88," June 13.) The center claims to be a public interest organization. 
Who asked them to represent the public? 
</P>
<P>
Most people never heard of the Center for Science in the Public Interest until 
their nasty "awards" hit the news. The center is actually a special-interest 
organization whose main purpose seems to be to collect money to attack private 
enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
American business is in a race for its life in a keenly competitive global 
market. Its success or failure will affect our jobs, our life styles and our 
children's futures. Constructive criticism can be useful but to single out the 
"worst" and hold those ads up to public mockery while ignoring some of the 
better ads is not in the public interest.

JUST WHO IS THE BULLY AND WHO IS STRUGGLING IN A CHANGING TELECOMMUNICATIONS 
INDUSTRY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times' "Bully on the Line?" story contained some oversights and unfair 
associations. 
</P>
<P>
First, there is the implication that as regulated monopolies, GTE California 
and Pacific Bell have inherent advantages over smaller competitors. 
</P>
<P>
We, indeed, each have franchised serving areas, with an in-place customer base. 
However, unlike new competitors, we must provide service to all customers in 
our service areas. We cannot selectively "cherry pick." 
</P>
<P>
Secondly, unlike some of our competitors, GTE has not had to refund money to 
customers for overzealous marketing practices or "competitive abuses." 
</P>
<P>
More importantly, the story implies that GTE and Pacific Bell are railing for a 
new means of "deregulation" to loosen Public Utilities Commission controls over 
local service and to cross-subsidize risky new services. 
</P>
<P>
GTE and Pacific Bell have given the PUC separate plans for a new regulatory 
process. The plans differ substantially. However, there is one commonality: 
</P>
<P>
We're not asking for deregulation. Just regulation that works. The current 
regulatory system was developed when local phone companies had a monopoly on 
most customer services. We're no longer in the long-distance business. Nor are 
we allowed to sell or lease phones and related equipment. 
</P>
<P>
We simply want a regulatory method that is more efficient, and one that gives 
us pricing flexibility to meet competitive and customer demands. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the implication of your story, GTE's plan requires that our 
shareholders bear all the financial burden for new services. At the same time, 
customers and shareholders would share earnings above PUC-set levels. 
</P>
<P>
Under GTE's plan, basic service rates would remain reasonable and predictable. 
And a new regulatory method could save taxpayers millions of dollars and open 
the way for a vast offering of new telecommunications services.

THATCHER'S TIME OF GRIM RE-EVALUATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Paul L. Montgomery, Paul L. Montgomery is an American correspondent covering 
political and economic matters in Europe. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BRUSSELS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In those bygone days when the European Parliament was known as the Cave of the 
Winds for all the effect-less speeches that stirred it, the conventional wisdom 
was that Europewide voting for members had only a tenuous connection with 
national politics. 
</P>
<P>
Political analysts argued that last month's European Parliament elections, like 
municipal elections in some countries and presidential primaries in the United 
States, were based more on whim and temporary feeling than considered judgment 
or traditional alliances. Voters, in this analysis, could afford to adopt a 
devil-may-care approach because they could be sure the people they selected 
would not actually govern them. Certainly in the first two European Parliament 
elections, the Green parties and the far right did better than they did in 
national voting. 
</P>
<P>
After the debacle for her Conservative Party in the latest round of European 
voting, Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher must be hoping fiercely that 
this conventional wisdom still holds. While her Labor opponents, who had 
finished a sad second every other time they went against Thatcher, crowed that 
the end was nigh, the Tories were engaged in a grim re-evaluation of their 
European posture. 
</P>
<P>
European Community members with socialist governments, such as France and 
Spain, could barely conceal their glee. Variations of the headline "Is the Iron 
Lady Rusting?" appeared in a variety of languages. 
</P>
<P>
Britain has 81 of the 518 seats in the European Parliament. With the recent 
elections, the situation of the Conservatives and Labor were exactly reversed 
from the last balloting five years ago. Whereas the Conservatives had 
previously held 45 seats to Labor's 32, the score now is Labor 45, 
Conservatives 32. (The rest of the seats are filled by small regional parties.) 
</P>
<P>
Worse than that, the Conservative share of the total votes dropped to 34.2%, 
the lowest percentage in a nationwide poll during this century. It was the 
first national defeat for the Tories in 14 years. A Harris poll last Sunday in 
the Observer, which is no friend of the Thatcher government, gave Labor 48% of 
the vote to 34% for the Conservatives if a national election were held now. 
</P>
<P>
But it will be at least two years before Thatcher has to face such a test. She 
dismisses the Euroresults as temporary and trendless, a mere blip in her 
relentless progress. At last week's European Community summit she showed a 
slightly increased inclination to compromise, but no sign of contrition or any 
major policy shift. 
</P>
<P>
Analyses of the vote must also take into account the peculiarities of the 
British electoral system. The United Kingdom is the only one of 12 European 
Community countries to maintain voting by constituency rather than by 
proportional representation. That means voters in constituencies certain to go 
to one party or another are especially tempted to lodge protest votes for 
special-interest parties -- or to stay home. 
</P>
<P>
Britain's turnout of 37% was the lowest among the countries voting, compared 
with 47% in the Netherlands, 49% in France and 61% in West Germany. Yet high 
turnouts do not necessarily mean high acceptance of the European ideal. In 
Belgium, where 93% of those eligible voted, voting is compulsory with a fine 
rising to $100 for recalcitrants; in Italy, with an 88% turnout, failure to 
vote is entered on a citizen's "Certificate of Good Conduct," needed for some 
civil-service jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The British Green Party, making its first nationwide showing, enjoyed 
remarkable results, winning 14% of total votes cast. 
</P>
<P>
In some Tory country strongholds of southern England, the Greens actually came 
second, ahead of both Labor and what's left of the hapless Liberal-Social 
Democrat alliance. But although they won the highest vote percentage in the 
European environmental movement, the British Greens did not win a single seat 
because of the constituency system. The French Verts got 10.6% of the vote but 
won nine seats through proportional representation, while the German Greens 
came away with eight seats on 8.4% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher, who began embracing environmental causes last fall after ignoring 
them for a decade, has implied that in a Tory-Labor showdown, the bulk of the 
Green vote would go to the Tories. It is certainly true that Labor has never 
stressed ecology -- directing its appeal instead to urban issues. However, it 
seems likely that the biggest cause of the Green surge was the disarray among 
the Liberals and Social Democrats, who had previously claimed the ecological 
issue as their campaign turf. 
</P>
<P>
In their projections for the next British general election, analysts must also 
factor in the lack of discipline among Labor ranks. Ideological splits, with 
socialists on the hard left attacking comfortable Social Democrats on the 
right, have more than once spoiled any prospect of a Labor victory. 
</P>
<P>
In his public appearances these days, Neil Kinnock, the Labor leader, stresses 
the need to adopt electable positions. But favorite Labor ideas, such as 
unilateral nuclear disarmament, withdrawal from European unity and 
renationalization of denationalized industries still keep popping up. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, most commentators pointed to Thatcher's uneasiness with European 
integration as the cause of her party's poor showing two weeks ago. The prime 
minister, in a series of scornful attacks, had spent much of the winter calling 
into question the next steps in the creation of a united Europe. She said the 
dropping of remaining trade barriers by the end of 1992 was fine, but that 
creation of a European central bank, a common currency and giving up a measure 
of national sovereignty for integration were "airy-fairy ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Such sentiments are common among small-scale businessmen fearing the arrival of 
hyper-markets, agribusiness and all the other appurtenances of expansion. The 
theory, however, is that in the Tories' high-tech party, Thatcher's protests 
were not heard by the voters. While party aides correctly observed that Labor's 
record has been even more anti-European than Thatcher's, it did seem that some 
of the traditional Conservative support was worried by the prime minister's 
recalcitrance. 
</P>
<P>
Socialists, including the British Labor Party, will be the largest bloc when 
the new European Parliament meets in Strasbourg, France, on July 25. 
</P>
<P>
Under the streamlined system adopted to speed the post-1992 market, the 
Parliament has a major voice in amending and approving enabling legislation. 
That could pit the parliamentary majority against those nations that have 
right-of-center governments, such powerful member countries as West Germany and 
Britain. If that turns out to be the case, then Thatcher's problems with Europe 
have barely begun.

DROPOUT DARWINISM: SCHOOL COUNSELORS HELPING THE FITTEST, ABANDONING THE REST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Schoolhouse Press and the author of Seeds: Some Good Ways to Improve Our 
Schools (Woodbridge Press).

<TEXT>
<P>
The superintendent of an urban school system remarked, at a campus social 
function, that a certain boy of considerable promise had dropped out on his 
16th birthday. The superintendent was brought up short to hear a first-grade 
teacher state emphatically, "No surprise to me." 
</P>
<P>
She explained: "Oh, I can tell the signs. Ask any first- or second-grade 
teacher; they'll be able to name all potential dropouts, and I swear if you put 
those names in your safe and looked at them eight or nine years down the road, 
you'd find we were right on target." 
</P>
<P>
The national dropout rate is now about 25%; some troubled urban areas are much 
higher -- a California state report last week put the Los Angeles dropout rate 
at 39%. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows for sure how many students stop attending school before they 
receive a diploma for completing the required number of courses, but current 
nationwide estimates put it as high as 50%. (Last week's California report, for 
example, put the Los Angeles "attrition rate" at 56.4%, counting dropouts plus 
students who move away or leave for other reasons.) And although students 
aren't supposed to drop out before they reach their 16th birthday, clearly many 
do. 
</P>
<P>
One reason we know so little about dropouts has to do with school counseling 
and college-guidance counselors. In most U.S. public secondary schools, only 
those students planning to go to college are given serious guidance. 
</P>
<P>
Vocational students, and all those who signal an interest in immediate job 
placement after graduation, are generally guided not so much by counselors as 
by their classroom faculty members. 
</P>
<P>
But the student who "isn't making it" -- that youngster pegged by his 
first-grade teacher as an academic failure -- is not being given any thoughtful 
and consistent guidance in what to do when he or she leaves school. 
</P>
<P>
Nor are dropouts encouraged to talk with guidance counselors during those first 
few months, when they no longer are in school but haven't found a full-time job 
or a mentor to help with the exigencies of full-time adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
Since the cumulative record for potential dropouts begins to reflect 
shortcomings in the primary grades, guidance counselors regularly cull through 
their load to find those who are "college material," virtually ignoring the 
rest, arguing that counseling them would be a waste of time. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the truth is that in today's world, the high school student who least needs 
guidance is the one bound for college. College-prep students already know a 
host of people who have gone on to college, and from them they can get an 
enormous amount of good advice and guidance. 
</P>
<P>
Most school dropouts have no idea what to do next, or how to do it. They have 
neither the academic nor vocational skills to be attractive to employers. Most 
lack financial resources and don't know how to get credit. When they do get a 
paying job, they have had no training in handling funds to their economic 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Dropouts, almost by definition, will have to find entry-level jobs, many of 
them part-time. Because they are dropouts, they have yet to learn many lifelong 
lessons, such as consistency, persistence, inherent self-worth -- the job of 
learning, the satisfaction of succeeding. 
</P>
<P>
College bound young people, on the other hand, not only have guidance 
counselors helping families work out financial support "packages" while in 
post-secondary schooling, but, once at a college, again have counselors 
assigned to help financially, socially, academically. 
</P>
<P>
What we have, then, is a system that gives the most highly educated students 
the most counseling and struggling ones the least. 
</P>
<P>
Now that's a curious way to treat half the youngsters in our nation. In fact, 
it's a national shame. We pay for it in record numbers of young adults 
suffering alcohol and drug abuse, in frightening amounts of street violence and 
tyranny, and in a serious breakdown in family structures. We will soon be a 
"democracy" where more than half of those eligible never vote -- with the 
highest percentage of non-voters at the youngest ages. 
</P>
<P>
Can the United States afford to waste this proportion of young citizens? 
Business has recently become aware of the problem -- and of the need for 
thoughtful, honest, educated citizens. Millions of dollars are being spent on 
employees for basic literacy training. 
</P>
<P>
There's no guarantee that providing good guidance counselors for potential 
dropouts, rather than lavishing it on the college-bound students, will lower 
crime rates, stabilize family structures or lift the general economy overnight. 
But as a person who has spent years wrestling with the problem, I am sure that 
providing guidance counselors for students who get the poorest grades and skip 
the most classes -- helping them with guidance, say, until they are 20 years 
old -- would ease that period of transition from full-time adolescence to 
full-time adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
A new breed of counselors is needed -- men and women who love and understand 
those struggling academically, who know the local community and its entry-level 
job openings, men and women who know which social and civic agencies stand 
ready to lend a hand to meet each dropout's special needs. And high schools 
must welcome back, for counseling, those students who failed to get diplomas. 
</P>
<P>
I recently asked 200 school principals attending a Harvard conference if they 
agreed that, nationwide, we fail to give an adequate education to nearly half 
the children attending our schools. 
</P>
<P>
They did. I then asked if they agreed that the way we administer our schools -- 
offering virtually no guidance for school dropouts -- contributed to the 
grievous fact that 50% of the nation's children fail to finish high school. 
</P>
<P>
The hands rose -- reluctantly and humbly -- in timorous agreement. It wasn't a 
fair question -- many of the principals could boast of guiding and teaching 
nearly 100% of their students. But in a nation with more than 12.4 million 
students in public school grades 9-12, there are only 68,500 counselors -- 
about 1 for every 181 students. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those 68,500 counselors are working with youngsters who need help the 
least.

AN INDIANA ALIEN TESTS SURVIVAL ALONG THE SIDEWALKS OF NEW YORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By James Nuechterlein, James Nuechterlein's impressions of urban life are 
adapted from the summer issue of This World, published by the Rockford 
Institute. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"So how do you like New York?" is the inevitable question for someone who left 
the bucolic world of small-town Indiana for the everything-that-is-not-bucolic 
world of Manhattan. Not just to work there but to live in. Norman Podhoretz 
once wrote that the longest journey in the world was from Brooklyn to 
Manhattan. He obviously never moved from Valparaiso (hard by Kouts and Boone 
Grove) to Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with the question is that, posed in its usual fashion, it's quite 
unanswerable. Does anybody like New York? People love it, they hate it -- often 
simultaneously -- but when one is groping for words to describe the city, 
likable is not the first -- or 47th -- that leaps to mind. (Perhaps the only 
less likely term would be gracious.) 
</P>
<P>
There is much about Manhattan that offends both the senses and elementary 
notions of common decency. It is incessantly noisy, unspeakably filthy. Because 
there are too many people in too close contact with each other, the most common 
attitude New Yorkers adopt toward their fellow citizens involves an admixture 
of distracted indifference, incipient hostility and impersonal rudeness. Most 
people most of the time do not even look at each other. To make eye contact in 
a public place is to risk sending an inadvertent message: a proposition, if one 
is female; a challenge or threat, if one is male. Perpetually overwhelmed by 
the presence of uncountable others, one constructs an invisible refuge of 
psychic isolation. As one of the characters in Tom Wolfe's "The Bonfire of the 
Vanities" puts it, the essential need for the New Yorker is to "insulate" 
himself from and against the existence of all those other people. 
</P>
<P>
We are speaking, of course, of life in public. There is no reason to suppose 
that New Yorkers act any differently in private among people they know than 
people anywhere else. And one does find exceptions to the public behavior 
described here -- an open and friendly smile, a gesture of personal concern, a 
supererogatory act of courtesy -- but those encounters are notable precisely 
for their singularity. 
</P>
<P>
For a great many residents the daily descent into public life begins with the 
degradation ceremony otherwise known as the subway. It is said that as many 
people ride the New York subway during rush hour as live in the city of 
Chicago, and riders know that statistic to be, if anything, understated. New 
Yorkers on a daily basis achieve the most intimate familiarity with their 
neighbors; for those inclined to cheap thrills, the subway experience cannot be 
improved on. 
</P>
<P>
Non-thrill-seekers cope as they can. Many read. Some sleep. Others retire into 
their headsets. Still others stare blankly into middle distance, apparently 
willing themselves into Zen nothingness. Some even pray. An acquaintance -- not 
Roman Catholic -- has taken to closing his eyes and reciting the rosary. (He 
finds the appeal to Mary to "pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our 
death" peculiarly compatible to the subway experience.) 
</P>
<P>
If the subway itself won't get you, the getting there will. There's the crime 
factor, of course, though in fact fear for one's personal safety isn't nearly 
so pervasive a factor of daily life here as non-New Yorkers universally suppose 
(Relatives in Indiana report that the most common question asked concerning me 
is, "How's Jim? Has he been mugged yet?"). City life anywhere in America has 
its risks, but one does not walk the streets of Manhattan in perpetual fear. 
Common-sense wariness, yes, but not fear and trembling. 
</P>
<P>
The assaults on the streets aren't so much physical as aesthetic and moral. 
Anything and everything of human experience or behavior routinely awaits the 
walker -- walker, not stroller; to stroll in New York is to risk being 
trampled. Street scenes encompass the sublime and the horrific, including 
Hogarthian rawness. Wandering about the city, tasting its life, one feels 
fascination, excitement, loathing -- everything but boredom, a sensation which, 
like serenity, is difficult to imagine in Manhattan. If New Yorkers typically 
exhibit the demeanor of those who have seen it all, it is because they have. 
</P>
<P>
There are crazies everywhere. Not as in eccentric, but as in -- to employ one 
of Mayor Edward I. Koch's favorite terms -- wacko. The unhinged rant on street 
corners, scream obscenities in crowded subway trains, carry on extended 
conversations with unseen partners (perhaps because they are so leery of 
speaking to each other, New Yorkers have a striking propensity for conducting 
audible discussions with themselves). People regularly fall asleep -- pass out 
-- in full view: in parks and playgrounds, on subway platforms, propped in 
doorways, sprawled on sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
Panhandlers are omnipresent, as are druggies, bag ladies, the homeless, the 
rootless and unsettled of every sort. On a small island like Manhattan, with a 
population piled on top of itself, extremes of wealth and poverty crowd upon 
each other with startling and ominous juxtaposition. Tom Wolfe exaggerates when 
he depicts the wealthy neighborhoods of Manhattan as besieged fortresses in an 
essentially Third World environment, but the image is closer to reality than is 
comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
All this edges one toward the conclusion so often reached about the city -- 
that it is unlivable. New Yorkers do not deny unlivability; indeed, they insist 
on it, wear it as a badge of honor. It is difficult in New York to think of 
life in other than Darwinian terms, and so the conceit comes easily that 
survival here marks one as among the fittest. 
</P>
<P>
Even if, as some critics would insist, at a terrible cost. Callousness develops 
naturally in New York; it is in some ways simply a necessity. How else endure 
the routine horror? Even the most tender of spirits must sooner or later come 
up against the limits of compassion. One becomes, if not hardened, at least 
oblivious, unseeing. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it is necessary to avoid facile moral conclusions and judgments. It is easy 
to be deceived by the surface cynicism and unconcern that New Yorkers put on as 
defensive armor. There is reason to suspect that conditions in the city are 
likely to generate increased, rather than lessened, compassion toward others. 
Where, after all, is it easier to avert one's gaze from the social miseries 
that people endure in America today: in Manhattan or in Valparaiso, Indiana? 
Homelessness and destitution are largely abstractions in Valparaiso; in New 
York they are inescapable daily realities. If New Yorkers of necessity affect 
indifference to the social pathologies that surround them, those pathologies 
nonetheless impinge on them with such pressing immediacy that they must -- in 
some way, at some level -- be attended. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent dinner party in Manhattan, a spirited discussion developed as to 
whether or not city residents should make contributions to the panhandlers they 
encounter every day. Only after lengthy debate did someone notice that it was 
the longtime residents who made it a practice to fill their pockets with 
quarters each morning for distribution to the unsortable assortment of con 
artists and genuinely needy they would run into that day; the newcomers and 
out-of-towners preached sterner social morality and practiced less generous 
personal charity. 
</P>
<P>
Which is not to suggest that the non-New Yorkers were necessarily wrong. Mayor 
Koch doesn't think so, and there is much to be said for his argument that 
giving money to street beggars is, after everything has been carefully weighed 
in the social balance, a counterproductive policy for all concerned. Nor is the 
mayor's position congenial only to conservatives and the hard-of-heart; many 
compassionate leftists would insist that the only effective solution to social 
misery lies in public policy and that indiscriminate private charity misdirects 
social energy, delaying genuine reform. 
</P>
<P>
The issues here for both morality and social policy are infinite in their 
complexity and ambiguity, but the evidence suggests that living in New York is 
not of itself necessarily destructive of moral sensibilities or injurious to 
moral health. It might even -- and here, finally, the point of these rambling 
observations -- be of some contingent value to one who has come to the city to 
help edit a journal concerned with the intricate interactions of religion and 
public life. 
</P>
<P>
But all that may be mere rationalization. One quickly learns that Manhattan, 
for all that is awful about it, is also, by virtue of variety, vitality and 
sheer manic energy, damnably seductive. One even comes to understand, even if 
not yet to take on, the core belief on which most residents build their lives, 
a belief often conveyed in the form of a question: Given a choice, how could 
anyone who is not brain dead -- and from whom the juices of life have not been 
entirely drained -- live anywhere else?

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Larry Bowler is a lieutenant in the Sacramento County sheriff's department and 
a Republican political activist. Last year, he decided to run for the state 
Assembly against a Democrat he perceived vulnerable on law-and-order issues, 
Phillip Isenberg of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Bowler expected moral, financial and manpower support from colleagues in the 
law-enforcement community; there probably isn't any occupational group more 
conservative -- police officers are Republican almost by definition. 
</P>
<P>
But when the campaign season arrived, Bowler discovered that organizations 
representing rank-and-file peace officers wouldn't support him; worse, they 
were giving aid and comfort to his political enemy. He learned that some 
law-enforcement organizations routinely endorse Democrats for reelection to the 
Legislature, including some of its most liberal members. 
</P>
<P>
Bowler is so upset about what he calls the "ultraliberal" political bent of 
police associations that he's forming a new organization to provide "a counter 
group so that conservative cops can be heard." Republican candidates may be 
helped somewhat by the mere existence of the new organization, tentatively 
called the California Law Enforcement Alliance, but there won't be any rush by 
local police unions to get under Bowler's umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of political organizations formed by rank-and-file cops isn't 
to fight for tougher drug laws, reform of the judicial system and longer prison 
terms for criminals. These organizations are no different from other unions in 
their approach to elected officials: Pocketbooks come before prisons. 
</P>
<P>
Organizations representing district attorneys, sheriffs and police chiefs do 
most of the lobbying for tougher anti-crime laws, and Democrats don't get much 
political support from these associations. 
</P>
<P>
But a symbiotic relationship exists between Democrats and organizations such as 
the Peace Officers Research Assn. of California (PORAC), the California 
Organization of Police and Sheriffs (COPS), and the California Correctional 
Peace Officers Assn. (CCPOA), perhaps the fastest-growing union in the state. 
PORAC is a federation of local police unions; COPS is a smaller organization 
with most of its membership in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats help these rank-and-file organizations get what they want on 
pocketbook issues. In return, Democrats are endorsed by these organizations at 
election time. In effect, these unions protect Democrats from opposition 
charges that they are soft on crime. It is not unusual to see a police union 
leader appear on television to support a Democratic candidate -- an action that 
infuriates Republican candidates like Bowler. 
</P>
<P>
Ray McNally, a Republican political consultant, claimed voters in Isenberg's 
district last year received campaign mailings "almost every day from some 
police labor union attacking Bowler. It was like an orgy." McNally is now 
helping Bowler produce promotional materials for the new conservative alliance. 
</P>
<P>
Lobbyists for police unions say it would be self-defeating to become aligned 
solely with the Republican Party because GOP legislators often oppose their 
bills and because Democrats have controlled the Capital most of the last 30 
years. In fact, they point out, the unions endorse candidates of both parties, 
primarily incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, it might seem that there isn't much the Legislature can give 
local police officers in pocketbook benefits. Cops negotiate salaries and 
fringe benefits with local city councils and boards of supervisors. But the 
Legislature establishes the rules for collective bargaining and passes pension 
laws especially dear to the hearts of peace officers. These unions for years 
have sought enactment of a system of binding arbitration to resolve local 
disputes. Although they have not succeeded, they have received more support on 
arbitration from Democrats than from Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
Through the generosity of the Legislature, police now enjoy extraordinary 
pension benefits. Liberalization of rules covering disability retirement allow 
many officers to quit while relatively young, collect at least half pay free of 
income taxes -- and then accept another job. Most major health problems are 
presumed to be service-connected and thus legal grounds for disability 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
The pension issue is far more important than how a politician stands on crime 
and punishment to most police officers. 
</P>
<P>
Take the case of a former California GOP Assemblyman from San Diego, E. Richard 
Barnes. A retired Navy chaplain, Barnes was one of the most conservative 
members of the Legislature. He served as an official of the right-wing 
Christian Anti-Communism Crusade and was a statewide leader in the fight 
against pornography. He was as tough on crime as any politician in California. 
</P>
<P>
Because of his prior knowledge of military pensions, Barnes was appointed to 
chair the Assembly committee that handles retirement legislation for state and 
local government. Barnes examined the situation and found himself opposed to 
many benefits sought by organizations representing local-government employees. 
</P>
<P>
In the campaign of 1972, firefighters and police officers walked precincts on 
behalf of Barnes' Democratic opponent, Lawrence Kapiloff. Voters were told that 
Barnes was weak on issues of public safety, and Kapiloff, now a juvenile judge, 
was elected by a small margin. That seat, in a solidly Republican district, has 
remained in Democratic hands ever since, although its political complexion 
changed somewhat in 1982 through reapportionment. 
</P>
<P>
The ouster of Barnes was an unusual event, but it sent a message to all 
legislators: Your career is at risk if you dare fiddle with police and fire 
retirement benefits. Most incumbents of both parties are routinely endorsed by 
the police unions, a point emphasized by PORAC President Larry Malmberg in 
defense of Bowler's charge that the organization is "ultraliberal." 
</P>
<P>
In terms of campaign contributions, the California Correctional Peace Officers 
Assn. is now the most potent of the law-enforcement unions. According to Common 
Cause, CCPOA contributed $515,126 to campaigns last year, surpassed only by 
associations representing doctors, lawyers, realtors and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
CCPOA lobbyist Jeff Thompson says his organization tries to base endorsements 
on both bread-and-butter and crime issues. "We play it down the middle and are 
definitely bipartisan. We've been good to incumbents," he reports. "We identify 
hot races and sit down with both candidates." 
</P>
<P>
The CCPOA, he adds, is quite comfortable supporting Isenberg because "he grew 
up on the grounds of San Quentin and understands our problems." The 
assemblyman's father, Walter Isenberg, was a career civil servant in the state 
Department of Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
Police-union backing has been a major defensive weapon for the Democrats in 
their successful campaign to retain control of the California Legislature. 
Polls show that crime is a major issue with voters; the GOP often tries to use 
votes on death-penalty and other public-safety bills as tools to oust incumbent 
Democrats. But these attacks don't carry much weight if Democrats can keep 
showing voters that the cops on the beat are on their side. 
</P>
<P>
GOP strategist McNally claims "most rank-and-file cops are tough conservatives 
and vote Republican." He thinks the police unions are plain deceitful when they 
tell the public that they are supporting Democrats because they are tough on 
law and order. "They ought to tell the public what they are really about -- 
salaries, pensions and binding arbitration," added McNally. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming Bowler gets his organization off the ground, voters next year will 
face conflicting evidence from groups purporting to speak for the crime-fighter 
of California. To be effective, Bowler's alliance must discredit the 
established police unions -- a monumental undertaking that must be accomplished 
on a community-by-community basis. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, most Democratic legislators will continue to enjoy political police 
protection every time they are accused of being soft on crime.

Because of John Matuszak's prominence, tests were done as quickly as possible

MAHONY ON ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You published a commentary by Archbishop Roger Mahony entitled, "Abortion: What 
Does It Say About Us as a People?" (Op-Ed Page, June 22). In my view, the 
archbishop has answered that question incorrectly and uses a line of reasoning 
that I, as a citizen of this great democracy, both think and feel is distorted, 
insulting and terrible. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that every girl and woman in the United States have a legal right to 
chose an abortion says a lot about us as a people. It says wonderful things. It 
says that teen-agers and adult women do have a right to life, liberty and the 
pursuit of happiness -- their rights take precedence over an embryo's rights. 
And it says, in this free country, we think individual women are full citizens 
with dignity, intelligence and the capability to make their own independent 
reproductive decisions without interference from anybody -- from the church or 
from the government. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to correct some misinformation and disagree with Mahony on various 
points in his column: 
</P>
<P>
* All respected polls (Harris, The Times) that I know of in the United States 
show that the majority of American people think abortion should remain safe and 
legal. 
</P>
<P>
* Living in a "free society," my belief is that it is immoral and amoral not to 
have the right to make one's own decision in one's own family about abortion, 
about the severely retarded, the comatose and care of the elderly. What is 
moral is to have a choice and for individuals and families to be able to make 
choices without outside interference. 
</P>
<P>
* I am also glad, like the archbishop, that freedom of religion and freedom of 
the press are not up for a vote. This means that the archbishop can say, write 
and act upon what he believes but that he cannot impose his moral and religious 
beliefs on free citizens. 
</P>
<P>
* I totally disagree with the archbishop about Roe vs. Wade. It seems to me, 
and I think to the vast majority of people in the United States, that the 
decision made in 1973 is deeply worthy of us as a people. That decision shows 
respect for the individual, compassion for the difficult situations that people 
get into and the difficult choices they have to make, and supports a 
pluralistic society in which many different beliefs can be held and in which we 
don't have to force beliefs on each other. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of women's lives depend on keeping abortion safe and 
legal and a matter of private choice.

KEMP'S VISIT TO JORDAN DOWNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A recent editorial ("Really Show the Man Around," May 31) in your newspaper 
indicated that I should take note of the problems and opportunities in the 
Jordan Downs housing development and their implications for broader housing 
policy reforms. I have spoken with Assemblywoman Maxine Waters and other 
outspoken advocates of public housing tenants in Los Angeles, and I share their 
concerns and intend to promote broadened tenant involvement, resident 
management and homeownership opportunities for the residents of Jordan Downs 
and other housing developments throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
Resident management and homesteading opportunities begin with tenant 
empowerment, and a commitment to a long-term process of training and community 
organization. I have directed every field office in the country, including Los 
Angeles, as well as HUD headquarters staff in Washington, D.C., to designate 
resident initiatives coordinators to work with public housing resident entities 
and housing authorities to lend the requisite technical support in this process 
of neighborhood empowerment. I have also announced a $2.5 million training 
grant process to provide direct funding to newly forming resident management 
entities. 
</P>
<P>
The residents of Jordan Downs and their political supporters in Los Angeles 
succeeded in halting a proposed disposition of the project last year. New 
policies being promulgated at the Department of Housing and Urban Development 
will provide a greater role for tenant organizations in determining their own 
destiny. Resident management and homeownership opportunities provide a clear 
alternative to unwarranted demolition and disposition activities and a 
guaranteed equity stake for the residents of public housing.

Concerning the recent historical events in China, Poland and the Soviet Union,

ALICE KAHN: HELPING MOM SAY 'NO' TO DRUG TESTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alice Kahn 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Readers of the View section know that at Little League games and debutante 
balls and county fairs, parents are shouting: "Honey, I just busted the kids." 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated with a seemingly endless drug menace, alert moms and pops are taking 
matters into their own hands. Through the use of home testing kits, parents are 
learning to detect drug abuse early. 
</P>
<P>
One such kit, marketed by the nonprofit Athletes for a Strong America and 
costing $49.95, involves the simple use of a flashlight to check for dilation 
and contraction of the pupils. This way, parents can check their kids and 
discover the big eyeballs of uppers or the pinpoint pupils of downers. 
</P>
<P>
(Hey, kids, don't get the bright idea of taking both to maintain a mid-level 
eyeball. Won't work.) 
</P>
<P>
Users of the flashlight kit say they want to monitor their children so that bad 
habits can be nipped in the bud. They also claim that knowing that he will be 
checked can be an extra incentive to the child struggling to just say no. This 
way, the child can say, "Gosh, Buzz, I'd love to take those bennies with you, 
but see, I've got to get right home to my mom, who's waiting in my closet with 
a flashlight." 
</P>
<P>
The problem, of course, is that the flashlight kit is not foolproof or 
all-inclusive. It may be misleading in the search for the current adolescent 
drug of choice -- alcohol. Alcohol has no predictable effect on the pupils 
(although it can cause profound silliness in the teachers). The concerned 
parents should acquaint themselves with the signs and symptoms of this most 
abused drug. 
</P>
<P>
Alcohol is frequently referred to by its street names: booze, hooch, suds, 
sauce, brew and an '85 North Coast fume blanc. Its physiological effects range 
from a mild euphoria to an ugly megalomania. Signs and symptoms of alcohol 
abuse include slurred speech, irregular gait and the odd oil tanker steered 
into a shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
There are several ways to detect alcohol use in your children. Here at the 
Omniscient Parent Institute, we are marketing the Rapid Jaw Movement Test for 
only $49.95. It turns out that most children will try to cover the smell of 
alcohol with ordinary household chewing gum. In fact, alcohol abuse is the 
leading cause of gum-chewing in adolescents. If your child is a chewer, you 
should have him evaluated for alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
For $79.95, we can send you the Prairie Home IQ Kit. Lack of mental alertness 
is one of the common signs of alcohol abuse. Should your child begin acting 
like a nitwit, this kit will help you assess his mental abilities. A sample 
dialogue from the kit: 
</P>
<P>
Parent: What two oceans border the continental United States? 
</P>
<P>
Kid: Gosh, I don't know. We don't learn anything in today's failing school 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Parent: Don't give me that, you little sleazebag. You're on the sauce! 
</P>
<P>
Finally, for the parent who fears that his child may have graduated from 
alcohol to the harder stuff, we offer the Complete Home Detection Kit. This 
includes flashlight, siren, reflex hammer, handcuffs and a tiny holding cell. 
</P>
<P>
It is recommended that parents wait until the middle of the night, then stand 
outside the child's room and blast him with the siren. Dad gets on the bullhorn 
(batteries not included) and shouts, "Freeze, Junior. This is a bust." 
</P>
<P>
Mom proceeds to the living room, where she sets up a makeshift interrogation 
cell with dripping water and overhead light bulb -- and cigarettes for a reward 
should the kid break under pressure and confess. 
</P>
<P>
This is the least that concerned parents can do. 
</P>
<P>
Our cities and towns may be ruled by crack kings. Our foreign policy may be 
beholden to rich drug lords. Our national policy may appear increasingly like 
that of a pitiful, helpless junkie. But in living rooms all across America, we 
can hope to hear, "Honey, I just Mirandized the kid."

SHORT TAKES: SPECIAL KIDS CUT A HEARTFELT RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK RORABACK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A line from the old carol comes to mind: "Sing, choirs of angels; sing in 
exultation. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Not that the "Kids of Widney High" are angels. Far from it. "Exultation," 
though -- that's what their new record is about. Exultation and primal energy 
and even insight, in such quantity that after a few moments of listening, the 
fact that they're a little off key, that the beat is sometimes less than 
precise, becomes of marginal importance. 
</P>
<P>
That they did the record at all, there's the miracle. 
</P>
<P>
The Widney kids are developmentally disabled. Some are victims of Down's 
syndrome, others of muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, blindness, epilepsy. . 
. . Most have behavioral problems. Their chronological age averages 17; 
intellectually, they're kindergartners at best. And they're the stars of a new 
record, to which they contributed melody, lyrics and voices. 
</P>
<P>
Under the guidance of music teacher Mike Monagan -- a young man of talent, 
compassion, rampant imagination and uncommon forbearance -- the class began to 
flesh out a project worth a lifetime of pride. "There was no precedent," says 
Monagan, who proceeded to play it by ear in more ways than one. 
</P>
<P>
"I first played them songs that I'd written, but most of them couldn't grasp 
the concept." Undaunted, Monagan asked each to pick out several random notes, 
which he spun into a song line. "Then I'd ask a kid what he'd like a song 
about. One said, for example, 'A new car.' What color? Where would you drive 
it? Result: the song 'New Car.' " 
</P>
<P>
By similar procedure, there are songs about a girlfriend, Hollywood, even 
insects. One is called "Throw Away the Trash," another "Stand Up and Dance." 
"New York" is for an East Coaster who died of muscular dystrophy ("He just came 
to the end of his road") midway through the class. 
</P>
<P>
The record is on sale at Tower outlets. Channel 5 will feature the kids on 
"Sunday's Heros." Monagan's writing a book; someone else a screenplay. For the 
protagonists, most of the fuss is incomprehensible, except for this: They've 
always been called "special children"; now they know they are.

Wimbledon: The Court of Appeal for Set of Older Players 
</P>
<P>
Ed Baumer's in Wimbledon this week. Not at Wimbledon -- in it. Baumer, of 
Pasadena, is one of 12 players picked to represent the United States against 
the best of Europe in a tourney for men 75 and older. 
</P>
<P>
"They have the Brittania Cup for 65s," Baumer lamented before enplaning for 
Blighty, "the Crawford Cup for 70s. We're not official yet, so there's no name 
(for the competition). Not yet. We'd like to name the cup for (former U.S. 
champ) Bitsy Grant. Great guy, Bitsy, but his eyesight's going. Hey, all of us 
have something. Why do you think we need 12 on the team?" 
</P>
<P>
Gardner Mulloy, another renowned Yank, was going to be on the team, Baumer 
said, "but at the last minute the King of Morocco called and asked if Mulloy 
would play with him in Monaco. He's paying him plenty, I understand. Then 
Gardner's going home to partner George Bush in a Maine tournament. He's won 75 
or 80 titles and swears he's going to catch (Southern California's) Dodo 
(Dorothy) Cheney, but she's got 135 cups and she's still going strong. She's 
only 73, you know." 
</P>
<P>
Baumer reckons he'll play for another 10 years. Or more: "By then, they'll 
probably have tournaments for 90s." He stays in shape by playing "three or four 
times a week" at the Los Angeles Tennis Club, "only 10 minutes away from my 
office," where Baumer is in the financial publishing and consulting game. 
Doesn't the boss get on his case? "Not really. I am the boss." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever, Baumer figures that at 75, he has the edge on future foes. "I didn't 
take up the game until I was 55, but I was All-American water polo, Rutgers 
'34; my legs and my wind are good. So maybe by the time I'm 80 I'll catch up 
with these guys. I hate to say it, but I think some of them have reached their 
plateaus. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Really? At 75? Imagine! 
</P>
<P>

Roots of Royal Family Tree Run Deep 
</P>
<P>
Wherever you live, whatever your lot, if your surname is Clouston the blood of 
kings courses through your arteries. OK, it's thinned some out here in Southern 
California. Nevertheless, a privileged portion of your plasma runs purple. 
</P>
<P>
Or so says Robin Clouston. 
</P>
<P>
Clouston is a civil servant in Holywood, a suburb of Belfast, Northern Ireland. 
His hobby is genealogy, his passion the Clouston clan. (Well, not officially a 
clan: "more a family, though we are entitled to wear the tartan of the kinsman 
Sinclairs (St. Clairs)." 
</P>
<P>
The line traces directly back at least to the Viking monarch Magnus I (yclept 
Magnus the Good) and, on the other side, King Malcolm II of Scotland, both of 
whom strutted their stuff in the 11th Century, and whose family blood blended 
in presumed connubial bliss on the Orkney Islands. 
</P>
<P>
Clouston was kind enough to send a copy of the family tree, whose branches are 
adorned by an enchanting galaxy of ancestors: Gospadruig, King of Cumoria; 
Margaret, the Maid of Norway; Thorfinn, Jarl of Orkney; Erling the Archdeacon. 
. . . Immediate attention, though, focuses on one Haakon Havardson, also known 
as Klo, a Norse nickname for Claw. Haakon's inherited land was called Klostath 
(Klo's part), which segued in time to "Clouston." 
</P>
<P>
The rest is history. "A great many Orkneymen went to Canada in the early 
1700s," Clouston writes, employed by the Hudson's Bay Co. because the English 
were not man enough to endure the Canadian clime. Of the Canadian Cloustons, 
Robin is sure that a number preferred the lotus to the maple leaf and bopped 
off to California, not least "a James or John who migrated to a place called 
Cottonwood in the early 1900s." 
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Clouston is compiling a broad history, hopes even to launch a family 
magazine. He'd love to hear from any of you Southland Cloustons (we'll forward 
the mail). The reward? Not a scepter (however deserving; there is a statute of 
limitations) but rather a rare chance to walk again in the mists of Jarls and 
Maids. DICK RORABACK

ZAN THOMPSON: RETURNING TO WHERE MAGNOLIAS BLOOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Zan Thompson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My sister Patsy went to South Carolina with the vacuum cleaner on her knee. Not 
just for a trip, but to move back to the scenes of her magnolia-scented young 
bridehood. Having been married to Col. Frank C. Thomas when the Lord was a 
corporal, as she so succinctly and reverently puts it, she knows more people in 
the South than Br'er Rabbit. And, in South Carolina, she has one daughter, her 
eldest, Mandy, and her 6-foot-4 baby boy, an Eastern Airline pilot stuck in 
that strange state of suspended animation that passes for employment if you're 
working for Frank Lorenzo. 
</P>
<P>
Between the two of them they have presented Patsy with seven grandchildren. 
Muffie, the middle daughter, still lives in Escanaba, Mich., with her husband 
and two more grandsons. 
</P>
<P>
Patsy and I have lived together since shortly after our husbands died a few 
months apart 17 years ago. Patsy has been planning to return to the scenes of 
her marriage and to live nearer to her children for a long time and finally did 
it. 
</P>
<P>
She has a brand-new house, and when I tell you what she paid for a living room, 
dining room, kitchen, a veranda across the back made coolly shady and 
shadow-patterned with jalousies, you will sag with disbelief. She has three 
bedrooms and two baths and an oak tree. There is also her very own pond and the 
house backs up into a piney woods. Ready? $63,000. 
</P>
<P>
Because Tommy was always a fighter pilot for the Marine Corps, they lived all 
over the South. The Marines seemed to have decided that there are more clear 
days of flying south of Mason-Dixon than anywhere else. Patsy is in Beaufort, 
S.C., near a Marine air base. She knows everyone in town because many of them 
are retired Marines and their ladies with whom Tommy and Patsy served. Half the 
people she has met were in Tommy's squadron. Thus she is the colonel's lady 
come home to levees, picnics, shrimping expeditions and all manner of wonderful 
things. 
</P>
<P>
Patsy, lucky lady, has never had a child do one thing wrong. I admit that 
occasionally, in the days of his adolescence, my Timothy made a mistake or two. 
Oh, nothing much. 
</P>
<P>
But that is why I was so delighted with a telephone call I received from Patsy 
while she, Bo and Muff were driving across the country, having flown out to 
drive with her to South Carolina. Bo is not only the baby but he is the boy. Of 
course, she has no favorites among these paragons. 
</P>
<P>
She called every night. The first night, she called from New Mexico, which 
seemed logical. The next night, she was in Texas. I said, "Well you'll call 
from Texas again tomorrow night." She said she supposed so. 
</P>
<P>
The next night she called late in the evening. I said, "Where are you?" 
</P>
<P>
She snarled into the phone, "Chattanooga, Tenn." I knew what had happened. Bo 
had done nearly all the driving and had refused to stop, deciding he was going 
to get those ladies in the back seat out of there and home. 
</P>
<P>
I said, "I'll bet you'll call tomorrow night from Columbia, S. C." That's where 
Bo lives. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I won't," she said with her voice in her boots. And then when I said "Why 
not?" she said, about her baby boy child, "Because I am never getting back in 
the car with that ornery, bossy wretch again." 
</P>
<P>
You know what happens. You have driven with someone who gave you the 
carrot-and-stick treatment and who kept promising you that he knew a dandy 
little inn just a few miles down the road. Of course, when you get there, it is 
a dented gas station with a coal box for soda pop out in front and the driver 
said, "Oh, I guess it must be just around that next curve." 
</P>
<P>
He knows it is not there because he has no intention of stopping. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Patsy and Muffie were complaining about being hungry, thirsty 
and tired. Big bad Bo just put the pedal to the metal and headed for 
Chattanooga. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, yes, Patsy called the next night, from Columbia, S. C. 
</P>
<P>
All is well, now. All of her furniture caught up with her except the lamp 
bases, and things look different after a night's sleep in your own bed with the 
katydids humming over the pond and the moon shining through the magnolia tree. 
</P>
<P>
I picked up some bits and pieces to send to Patsy through one of those 
wonderful mailing services that pack and mail for you. I went to the one we 
normally use on California Street in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
One of the women who runs the shop came in and saw my pack of stuff, which 
included a calico cow with long swooping burlycue queen eyelashes. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you have, Zan?" the proprietor asked. The cow was for my 
granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
I said, "Two raincoats, a wool scarf, a picture of Tommy in his flight suit, Bo 
in a suit of armor, age 7, two coffeepots and a calico cow." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, I see," the lady said, "the customary package, huh?"

ON AGING: PARENT CARE NOW TAKES THE MOST YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By The UCLA/USC Longterm Care Gerontology Center 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time, American couples are spending more years helping aging 
parents than caring for children, according to a recent report by the Older 
Women's League. It calls the consequences "monumental." 
</P>
<P>
Take the case of Steve and Sara S., both in their 40s. He's a professor; she's 
active in community affairs. Together with their 13-year-old daughter, they 
live in a comfortable home in a small college town in Upstate New York. For 
years they talked about building a house in the country after their daughter 
entered college. Two years ago the plans changed. Steve's bfather was 
hospitalized twice over a period of months, and Steve realized that his father 
could not return home alone. 
</P>
<P>
Steve and his wife invited his father to move in with them for six months. He's 
still there. Says Steve: "My dad has made a life here he never had in New York 
City. He's connected with people. He's a computer whiz in the college course 
he's taking, secretary for the Little League and involved in local 
environmental issues." 
</P>
<P>
The once-temporary move is now permanent, and none of the family members talks 
about change. Steve's dad helps with household chores, supervises his 
granddaughter and insists on paying a small amount for room and board. 
</P>
<P>
There have, of course, been changes. Instead of buying land in the country, 
Sara and Steve enlarged their house to give themselves more privacy. They did 
this just in time; in April, Sara's widowed mother moved in with them as well. 
</P>
<P>
A year before, she suffered a stroke and, although she made a remarkable 
recovery, life isn't the same. She gave up driving, which for her was a link to 
siblings and friends. She visited Steve and Sara monthly, each time staying a 
bit longer. 
</P>
<P>
Experience has taught this intergenerational family what to expect. Sara's 
mother is getting counseling to help her with the transition. Says Steve: 
"She's having a harder time adjusting. She was very much a force in her own 
community and an active church member for 43 years." 
</P>
<P>
Steve and Sara have no complaints about the choices they made. They are 
learning to live with the burdens and joys of aging parents. According to OWL, 
women today can expect to spend 17 years caring for children and 18 years 
assisting a parent. Nearly 2 million women are caring for children and parents 
simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
Question: I'm a 78-year-old living in Santa Barbara, Calif. Since I retired 20 
years ago, my home has greatly appreciated in value, while my income has 
remained fixed. There are many things I'd like to do and buy, but I am 
concerned about spending my small savings. I've heard about reverse mortgages, 
but very little about sale lease-back plans. Can you tell me about them? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: An increasing number of older people have substantial assets invested 
in their home, but, like you, relatively little income to meet expenses. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. Jon Pynoos of USC, aging in place is a strongly held 
preference of most older persons. A recent survey found that 70% of persons age 
65 and above, especially women over 80, agreed with the statement, "What I'd 
really like to do is stay in my own home and never move." Such strong 
attachment to place is associated with the benefits of familiarity, access to 
neighborhood services, proximity of friends, psychological attachments to the 
home and, especially for homeowners, financial security. 
</P>
<P>
Because most older homeowners do not want to move or sell their homes, several 
plans for converting home equity into cash without requiring occupants to 
vacate the residence are available: 
</P>
<P>
Sale lease-back plans were first introduced in 1978 by Fouratt Corp. in an 
attempt to help an elderly Carmel, Calif., resident. According to Rick Watson 
of Fouratt, the woman owned her home free and clear, did not want to move, but 
was living in desperate conditions because of inadequate income. 
</P>
<P>
Under sale lease-back plans, owners sell but retain the right to reside in 
their homes. By contrast, reverse mortgages enable owners to borrow against 
their home equity and repay the loan, usually within 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
In most sale lease-back plans, the owner sells the home to an individual buyer 
or investment firm, then leases it back for lifetime occupancy. If you entered 
into this arrangement, you would become a renter in your home. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase price usually is divided into a lump sum and fixed monthly 
payments in amounts based on the seller's life expectancy. According to Walton, 
the buyer also purchases a deferred annuity for the seller that begins paying 
out when the loan ends. This guarantees the seller regular income over his or 
her lifetime. If the seller dies before the full loan is repaid, the balance is 
paid to the estate. 
</P>
<P>
Seek legal advice to understand the options and risks of both sale lease-back 
and reverse-mortgage plans. 
</P>

FOURTH RIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
VISITING PRESIDENTIAL BIRTHPLACES CAN REMIND US THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Like the rest of us, our Presidents are diverse. They are the children of the 
wealthy and educated, the children of the poor. They were born on historic 
plantations on the river banks of Virginia, in modest wood-frame homes on the 
Midwestern plain, on ranches in Texas cattle country. They are the sons of 
ministers, of farmers, of land barons, of laborers. 
</P>
<P>
And some of the homes where they were born are open to the public. To visit 
those homes is to be reminded of several things: Of our right to travel to 
those homes. Of our right to aspire to their position. Of their origins, which 
often were humble. Of our right to elect the leaders of our choice. 
</P>
<P>
When our nation was born on the Fourth of July, so were our opportunities. 
Let's celebrate with a quiz on some lesser-known facts about our Presidents. 
</P>
<P>
Which two Presidents died on the same day -- July 4, 1826? 
</P>
<P>
John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. 
</P>
<P>
Which state produced the President who held office for only one day? 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky. David Rice Atchison, born in Frogtown, Aug. 11, 1807, who, as 
president pro tempore of the U.S. Senate, effectively became leader of our 
nation for one day -- March 4, 1849, when President-elect Zachary Taylor, a 
staunchly religious man, refused to take office on a Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Which President's birthplace is claimed by two states? 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Jackson, born March 15, 1767, in Waxhaw settlement on the farm of his 
aunt near the North Carolina/South Carolina border, but before the border was 
drawn. North Carolina commemorates its favorite son with a highway marker about 
20 miles south of Charlotte. South Carolina celebrates its home-grown president 
with Andrew Jackson State Park on U.S. 521, north of Lancaster. The park 
features a picnic area, nature trail, camping and fishing facilities and a 
one-room schoolhouse and museum that contain artifacts of the period and the 
area. Call (803) 285-3344. 
</P>
<P>
What is placed in a time capsule beneath the site of Gerald Ford's Omaha 
birthplace? 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, during the Bicentennial, officials planted a time capsule beneath the 
President Gerald R. Ford Birthsite &amp; Gardens in Omaha. It contained, among 
other things, a six-pack of Falstaff beer, sealed but empty. In addition, it 
contained a football, a plastic telephone showing how the parts work, two 
manikins depicting 1976-era dress and income tax information from the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
Who was the only President to be married in the White House? 
</P>
<P>
Grover Cleveland, who in June 1886 married 21-year-old Frances Folsom, 
Cleveland's ward since her father died in 1875. Her father had been one of 
Cleveland's law partners. 
</P>
<P>
What profession did the fathers of Presidents Grover Cleveland and Woodrow 
Wilson share? 
</P>
<P>
Both were Presbyterian ministers. 
</P>
<P>
Which birthplace is on land still inhabited by a late President's widow? 
</P>
<P>
The L.B.J. birth site, at the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park near 
Johnson City, Tex., is on the ranch where Lady Bird Johnson sometimes resides. 
</P>
<P>
Which state is birthplace of eight Presidents and the final resting place of 
seven? 
</P>
<P>
Eight Presidents were born in Virginia: George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, 
James Madison, James Monroe, William Henry Harrison, John Tyler, Zachary Taylor 
and Woodrow Wilson. Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, Tyler, William 
Howard Taft and John F. Kennedy all are buried in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
Which state was the birthplace of the second-greatest number of Presidents? 
</P>
<P>
Seven U.S. Presidents -- Ulysses S. Grant, Rutherford B. Hayes, James A. 
Garfield, Benjamin Harrison, William McKinley, William Howard Taft and Warren 
G. Harding -- were born in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Who is the only President born in California? 
</P>
<P>
Richard M. Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
Which President was born on the plantation where "Taps" was composed? 
</P>
<P>
William Henry Harrison (son of Declaration of Independence signer Benjamin 
Harrison, who also lived in the house, and grandfather of 23rd President 
Benjamin Harrison) was born on Berkeley plantation in Virginia. That is where 
"Taps" was composed in 1862 while Union Forces were encamped there during the 
Civil War, and where the first bourbon whiskey in America was distilled in 
1621. 
</P>
<P>
On what date was the Declaration of Independence formally adopted by the Second 
Continental Congress meeting in Philadelphia? 
</P>
<P>
If you don't know the answer to this, ask any grade-school child. (Penalty for 
an incorrect answer is that you must go to work on Tuesday.) 
</P>
<P>
As a reward for successfully completing this quiz, here are a few Presidential 
birthplaces to visit at your leisure. They also are a reminder of how we began 
and who we have become. 
</P>
<P>
George Washington (first President): Born Feb. 22, 1732, in Westmoreland 
County. The original house burned in 1779. A memorial house was reconstructed 
on the site. A Colonial farm, kitchen and workshop also help show a typical 
plantation. The land is tilled by oxen and the crops are the same as those 
planted during Washington's childhood. Washington's great-grandfather, 
grandfather and father are all buried there, about 38 miles east of 
Fredericksburg, Va., near the Potomac River. Call (804) 224-1732. 
</P>
<P>
John Adams (second President): Born Oct. 30, 1735, in Braintree, now Quincy, 
Mass. The house is at 133-141 Franklin St., Quincy. It's open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
daily, April 19 through Nov. 10. Call (617) 773-1177. 
</P>
<P>
John Quincy Adams (sixth President and son of President John Adams): Born July 
11, 1767, in Quincy, Mass., next door to the house in which his father was 
born. Both homes are open to the public (see preceding). 
</P>
<P>
William Henry Harrison (ninth President): Born Feb. 9, 1773, on Berkeley 
plantation halfway between Richmond and Williamsburg in Charles City County, 
Va. The original Georgian mansion, built in 1726, is furnished with antiques. 
It is sited in 10 acres of formal terraced boxwood gardens on the James River, 
Virginia Route 5, Charles City, Va. Call (804) 829-6018. 
</P>
<P>
Abraham Lincoln (16th President): Born Feb. 12, 1809, in a one-room log cabin 
in Hodgenville, Ky., in rolling hills in the central part of the state. The log 
cabin, which has been reconstructed on the original site, is now housed in a 
stately granite memorial. At the time the family lived there, Lincoln's father 
was a farmer. The family owned 348 acres, but probably only farmed a few acres 
at a time. The family of four, including Lincoln's parents and one sister, 
lived in the cabin until Lincoln was 2 1/2 years old. The visitor center 
contains a family Bible with Lincoln's name written in it. Three miles south of 
Hodgenville on U.S. 31E, the memorial is open daily. Call (502) 358-3874. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Johnson (17th President): Born Dec. 29, 1808, in the kitchen of an inn 
where his parents worked in Raleigh, N.C. The two-story rustic kitchen 
structure features a huge fireplace. Johnson's father, who was the hosteler for 
Casso's Inn, died when Johnson was 3 years old and the child was raised by his 
mother. In 1975 the home was moved to Mordecai Historic Park, a 1785 plantation 
at 1 Mimosa St., Raleigh, N.C. (919) 834-4844. 
</P>
<P>
Ulysses S. Grant (18th President): Born April 27, 1822, in a one-room, 
16x19-foot home in Point Pleasant, Ohio, overlooking the Ohio River. Now a 
three-room frame cottage, Grant's birthplace has been furnished with period 
items and pieces owned by the family. Of interest are a pair of boots and a 
leather chest, both made by Grant's father, who was a tanner. In 1890 the house 
was taken on a tour of the United States (either on a river boat traveling by 
waterways or by railroad flat car) so that the public could see it. The house 
later was returned to its original foundation, about 27 miles southeast of 
Cincinnati in the Clermont County village of Point Pleasant off Ohio 52. The 
birthplace is open April 1 through Oct. 31, Wednesday through Saturday, 9:30 
a.m. to 5 p.m. (closed noon to 1 p.m.), and Sunday, noon to 5 p.m. It is on 
Ohio 232, Point Pleasant, Ohio, about 15 miles from Cincinnati. Call (513) 
553-4911. 
</P>
<P>
Grover Cleveland (22nd and 24th President): Born March 18, 1837, in the 
parsonage of the First Presbyterian Church in Caldwell, N.J., where his father 
was a minister. The house is open to the public Wednesday through Sunday. Call 
(201) 226-1810. 
</P>
<P>

reconstruction of the original farmhouse sits on the original site, rebuilt by 
Johnson in 1964. The Johnsons planned it to serve as a guest house for visitors 
to the LBJ ranch, but rarely used it as such. Because Lady Bird Johnson still, 
at times, lives on the ranch, the birth site is accessible only by a bus tour

1990. Although it is not possible to get on the grounds, it is possible to 
catch a glimpse of the farm on the corner of Eureka and Yorba Linda boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald R. Ford (38th President): Born July 14, 1913, in Omaha, Neb. The house 
Ford was born in was destroyed by fire in 1971. In 1977 the site was bought and 
developed into a memorial. It houses a fountain and the Betty Ford Rose Garden. 
The original home was built in 1893 for $10,000, a high price for that period. 
When Ford was just a few weeks old, his mother separated from his father, 
Leslie King Sr., who was a well-to-do businessman. They divorced and his mother 
eventually moved to Grand Rapids, Mich., where she married Gerald R. Ford, who

Woolworth Ave., is open daily, 8 a.m. to 11 p.m.

WILLIAMSTOWN SEEMS PICTURE PERFECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Sterling Clark was a dashing exemplar of the adage that living well is 
the best revenge. 
</P>
<P>
An heir to the Singer sewing machine fortune, Clark bred and raced horses, 
roamed the globe and had an educated taste for Kentucky bourbon and French 
cuisine. He also had a passion for art. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly half a century -- he died in 1956 -- Clark and his wife, Francine, 
assembled one of the most dazzling collections ever held in private hands. 
</P>
<P>
Especially rich in works by the 19th-Century French impressionists, it includes 
more than 30 Renoirs and dozens of lapidary paintings by Pissarro, Monet and 
Degas. American artists Winslow Homer, John Singer Sargent and Frederic 
Remington are also represented, along with the European masters Hans Memling, 
Jacob van Ruisdael and Frans Hals. 
</P>
<P>
This beauty of a collection is on view in the small Massachusetts college 
community of Williamstown. Taken together with Williams College's considerable 
holdings of ancient and modern art, it makes of its bucolic setting an 
improbable world center of artistic delights. 
</P>
<P>
Clark chose Williamstown as the repository for his beloved collection because 
of its remote site in the Berkshire hills of western Massachusetts. Cities, he 
decided, were too risky in a nuclear age. 
</P>
<P>
To house his treasures he built a white marble temple in a spacious park. It 
opened in 1955. In 1973 a red granite annex was tacked on for expanded study 
and exhibition space. 
</P>
<P>
The Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute is not for devotees of abstract 
modernism. Clark bought solely for his own pleasure; what he liked did not 
include Picasso or Henry Moore. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the galleries glow with a romantic vision of sweeping seascapes and 
landscapes, tenderly portrayed nudes and the teeming vitality and gossipy 
details of everyday life in centuries past. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors enter through the annex. Two galleries dominate the ground floor. The 
larger is devoted to American art of the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
There, for example, you can savor Homer's "Summer Squall": waves climbing a 
ridge of froth, a small boat tossed on a green sea. A few steps away, 
Remington's haunting "Scout" depicts a mounted Indian straining forward on a 
moonlit snow plain for a glimpse of distant campfires. 
</P>
<P>
In the gallery opposite, Adolph-William Bouguereau's 1873 oil of four comely 
nymphs teasing a muscular satyr fills an entire wall. The painting was a 
favorite of Clark's. 
</P>
<P>
An enclosed bridge leads from the annex to the main building. The original 
galleries flow in a square around an enclosed court. 
</P>
<P>
Begin in the southwest corner with the misty landscapes of 
Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, then work your way east to the Paris street scenes 
of Eugene Boudin. There is a Van Gogh or two, the ravishing dancers that 
celebrated Degas' lifelong love affair with the ballet, and a fugue of pink 
blossoms by Monet. 
</P>
<P>
But the stars of the show grace the interior court. These are the paintings of 
Pierre Auguste Renoir, one of impressionism's leading theorists from the 1870s 
until his death in 1919. 
</P>
<P>
Renoir had only one subject, sun-drenched color: the warm flesh tones of sturdy 
farm women and the rich blues, reds and greens of the seaside and countryside. 
</P>
<P>
No connoisseur will want to miss "His Girl Crocheting" (1875), with its golden 
hair and red earring complementing a blush of lip rouge. 
</P>
<P>
Close by, the famous 1881 "Onions" stands out as an exercise in pure design. 
The pink and lavender skins of the rounded tubers are as lushly portrayed as 
one of the artist's adored nudes. 
</P>
<P>
The institute, on South Street half a mile south of Main Street, is open 
Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission free. For more 
information, call (413) 458-9545. 
</P>
<P>
As campus art galleries go, the one at nearby Williams College also is a rare 
gem: well-lit, a place for leisurely browsing. Nineteenth- and 20th-Century 
American paintings are its strengths -- oils and watercolors by Winslow Homer, 
George Inness, Thomas Eakins, Lyonel Feininger, Philip Pearlstein, Larry 
Rivers, Edward Hopper. 
</P>
<P>
The Williams College Museum of Art began life as the school's first library in 
1846. It became an art museum in 1926 and expanded steadily through the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986 the brick-faced edifice was completely renovated and enlarged once 
again with the addition of light, airy second-floor galleries springing from 
the building's centerpiece, the original columned rotunda. 
</P>
<P>
The new galleries -- bright pine flooring, blue and dove-gray walls -- focus on 
permanent holdings of 60 or so panels and canvases by the avant-garde 
Prendergast brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Maurice (1858-1924), a disciple of Cezanne and Matisse, worked in flowing, 
semi-abstract oils and watercolors. 
</P>
<P>
Charles (1863-1948) was a primitivist whose tiles and wood carvings were 
inspired by ancient craft traditions. 
</P>
<P>
The ground-floor main gallery centers on the more familiar luminaries of 
American art. A splendid selection of 19th- and 20th-Century masterpieces 
includes Childe Hassam's atmospheric "Rainy Day, Boston" (1886) and a 
turn-of-the-century seascape by Robert Henri. 
</P>
<P>
An adjoining gallery displays works by American and European modernists. There 
is, for example, Hopper's starkly realistic "Morning in the City," Pearlstein's 
massive nudes, a surreal design by Yves Tanguy and Andy Warhol's celebrated 
pop-art composition of Marilyn Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
The museum, known locally as Lawrence Hall, is on Main Street just east of 
Spring. It's open Monday through Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday, 1 to 5 
p.m. Admission is free. For more information, call (413) 597-2429. 
</P>

Except for an enclave of shops and restaurants and a clutch of outlying 
hostelries, Williams College is Williamstown. With its broad leafy avenues and 
appealing array of Georgian and Greek Revival buildings, the sprawling campus 
is a perfect place for a morning or afternoon stroll. 
</P>
<P>
Williamstown also is a convenient base for Berkshire fall foliage tours and 
outings to nearby Lenox, summer headquarters of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. 
For ticket information, call (617) 266-1492. 
</P>
<P>
Standout for comfort and ambience is The Orchards, a Berkshire version of an 
English country inn, with 49 cozy rooms and afternoon tea served in an 
impeccably appointed drawing room. Address: 419 Main St., Williamstown, Mass. 
01267. Prices: $135 to $170 double. For reservations, call toll-free (800) 
225-1517. 
</P>
<P>
The nearby Williams Inn (The Green, Williamstown, Mass. 01267; $95 double; 
(413) 458-9371) is a modern, Colonial-style establishment with 100 guest rooms. 
</P>
<P>
For cuisine centering on such seasonal specialties as quail, salmon and 
venison, The Orchards, again, is the best bet. About $70 for dinner for two 
with wine. At the River House (123 Water St.) the emphasis is on hearty 
chowders and steaks. Dinner for two is about $40 with wine. 
</P>
<P>
Specifics about hotels, restaurants and touring in and around Williamstown are 
available from the Williamstown Board of Trade, Cold Spring Road, Williamstown, 
Mass. 01267, (413) 485-9077, or the Berkshire Visitors Bureau, Berkshire 
Common, Pittsfield, Mass. 01201, (413) 443-9186.

<TEXT>
<P>
Vacationers soon will be traveling in the Soviet Union by private rail car. 
Trips are being arranged by Gerard Morgan-Granville (who got the Royal Scotsman 
rolling through Scotland) in cooperation with Alistair Ballantine, president of 
Abercrombie &amp; Kent of Illinois. Rail cars that ordinarily carry Soviet 
ministers of state will transport passengers. Deluxe accommodations are 
promised: compartments, baths, a dining room. On board will be a butler, maid, 
chef and an Intourist guide. 
</P>
<P>
One itinerary will take in towns and villages between Moscow and Leningrad, 
including Suzdal, Kostroma and Rojtov, where passengers will sightsee by 
chauffeured limousine before continuing their journey. Because this is a deluxe 
trip, prices are steep ($3,500 for six days, including an open bar). In the 
planning stage is a trans-Siberian journey using the same upscale rail cars. 
</P>
<P>
Contact Alistair Ballantine, Abercrombie &amp; Kent, 1420 Kensington Road, Oak 
Brook, Ill. 60521, phone toll-free (800) 323-7308.

<P>
England by Canal 
</P>
<P>
A company in England is booking six-day canal cruises for only $485. Sounds 
like a bargain compared with other canal holidays. Passengers board at various

<P>
Irish-French Connection 
</P>
<P>
If you're in no hurry, take the ferry from France to Ireland the next time 
you're in Europe. Sailing time from Cherbourg and Le Havre in France to 
Rosslare in Ireland (or Le Havre to Cork) is about 19 hours. One-way fares 
start at $88 during the summer peak season. (Eurailpass holders travel free.)

A Letter From Paris 
</P>
<P>
Pascal Lefebvre, president of a bed and breakfast organization in Paris, 
writes: "If you have heard that there are no more rooms in Paris in July, we 
have the pleasure to inform you that we can still offer you accommodations for 
this period. In collaboration with the Office of Tourism in Paris, our 
association is providing lodging in private homes. We do our best to choose our 
accommodations according to the profile of our visitors, directing them to 
friendly hosts." 
</P>
<P>
Write to Lefebvre c/o Bed and Breakfast 1, 73 Rue Notre-Dame-Des-Champs 75006, 
Paris, France. This same organization represents B&amp;Bs in London, Berlin, 
Rio, New York. For other lodging information, contact the French Government 
Tourist Office in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
A Small Hotel 
</P>
<P>
In the latest issue of his travel newsletter Entree, publisher/editor William 
Tomicki praises a new quality small luxury hotel in New York, The Mark. "We're 
crazy about it," says Tomicki. "The most elegant, understated, tasteful lobby, 
furnished with original oil paintings, Biedermeier furniture. Rooms of marble, 
Piranesi prints. Loads of spider orchids, full-length mirrors everywhere. A 
front desk person accompanies you to your room. One of New York's best-kept 
secrets. Rooms start at $200. The Mark, Madison Avenue at 77th Street, New 
York." 
</P>
<P>
Visas for France 
</P>
<P>
Americans visiting France for less than three months are no longer required to 
apply for a visa. And neither are French citizens traveling to the United 
States. The visa requirement by the French went into effect in 1986, a period 
during which France was involved in an anti-terrorism campaign. Previously, 
even though French citizens were required to obtain visas to visit the United 
States, Americans had been welcomed without this formality. Now we can expect 
new visitors from France and doubtless France will be welcoming still greater 
numbers of Americans. The relaxation of the visa requirement by France comes at 
a propitious moment, as France celebrates the bicentennial of its revolution 
with a special invitation to overseas visitors.

DENMARK BECOMES 51ST STATE EVERY FOURTH OF JULY

ALBORG, Denmark 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the Fourth of July in Denmark, drums roll and horns sound to the beat of 
"Stars and Stripes Forever," the breezes carrying the noise to picnicking 
families on the hills of Rebild. 
</P>
<P>
For 77 years, except during two World Wars, this small Scandinavian country of 
5 million people has celebrated the birthday of the United States at Rebild, 
the country's only national park, and in Alborg, a city 15 miles from the park. 
</P>
<P>
At Rebild, flags from the two nations fly everywhere. Also, along the walk 
leading to the park's natural amphitheater is a special tribute -- flags from 
every American state. 
</P>
<P>
Denmark's celebration of the Fourth of July means oratory by prominent Danes 
and Americans, sing-alongs to such songs as "Home on the Range," folk and 
square dancing, Danish youth choirs, a U.S. Air Force marching band and a 
California high school band complete with pompon girls. 
</P>
<P>
Visiting Americans are amazed. This is Denmark, land of Hans Christian 
Andersen, of Hamlet's castle, of a flag affectionately called "Dannebrog." 
</P>
<P>
Why all the hoopla here over the Fourth of July, about 4,000 miles east of the 
White House? 
</P>
<P>
The answer reads like a fairy tale. The story began 13 decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
From the mid-1880s through the turn of the century, one of every 10 Danes left 
their native country for America. Many were poor farmers seeking fresh soil, a 
new economy and an education for their children. Although they settled across 
the United States, the majority stayed in the upper Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
In 1912 the Danish-American Society was founded in Chicago. That same year the 
society bought 200 acres near Alborg, an old port city on sailboat-dotted Lim 
Fiord, about 160 miles northwest of Copenhagen. 
</P>
<P>
Centuries ago, wandering Visigoths revered this tranquil area of heather-laden 
hills and woods as verdant as County Cork. But the society found that most of 
the beloved heather had been sacrificed to the plow. 
</P>
<P>
The society replanted the heather and donated the land to the Danish 
government, then ruled by King Christian X. But it also wanted to honor the 
nation that had welcomed 500,000 Danish immigrants. The society told the king 
that in accepting the land, there is one very important stipulation -- 
America's Fourth of July must be celebrated in Rebild every year. 
</P>
<P>
His Majesty agreed. 
</P>
<P>
King Christian X made the area a national park to stand as a symbol of the 
close friendship between the United States and Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
Though the "Star-Spangled Banner" is sung only on the Fourth of July in Rebild, 
visitors are reminded of American-Danish kinship throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
A large Lincoln-type log cabin, constructed in 1934 as a memorial museum, 
symbolizes homes built in the United States by emigrants in the mid-1880s. Each 
of America's then-48 states contributed a log. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years Rebild's celebration has featured many speakers, including 
Walter Cronkite, Earl Warren, Walt Disney, Hubert Humphrey, Raymond Burr, 
Richard Nixon, Jean Hersholt, Danny Kaye, Ronald Reagan and Dionne Warwick. 
</P>
<P>
As Old Glory is raised to fly beside the red-and-white Dannebrog, Danes stand 
and cheer. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never felt so appreciated as an American," said teacher Elaine Boettcher 
of Oak Park, Ill., as she stood to sing the National Anthem. 
</P>
<P>
"Just gives me goose bumps all over," said Chris Thomsen, toting a huge 
American flag that he brought from the States when he left a year ago to retire 
here, the land of his birth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hot Dogs, Ice Cream 
</P>
<P>
Munching foot-long hot dogs and licking ice cream cones wrapped in red, white 
and blue, the audience eagerly follows the festivities. 
</P>
<P>
Rebild's square dancers don't have to travel far to display their Western 
attire and fancy steps. These dashing Texas-style dancers live in Alborg. 
</P>
<P>
Alborg is an easy-to-walk-about city of 155,000 people, many of whom greet 
strangers with a merry "God dag" (good day). Denmark's fourth-largest 
metropolis, this city of half-timbered houses and numerous restaurants, museums 
and amusement parks is the cultural center of northern Jutland. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,200 years ago, Alborg was a key Viking stronghold. The Norsemen's 
largest burial ground in all of Scandinavia is here; 682 tombs beneath a broad 
greensward are marked with large rocks, many set in the shape of a ship. 
</P>
<P>
Here, as everywhere in Denmark, folks are keen about bicycles and pedestrian 
shopping streets. The old section has an abundance of both. 
</P>
<P>
The best-loved and liveliest street, belying its saintly name, is Jomfru Ane 
Gade (Virgin Ann). Lined with discos, restaurants, jazz spots and pubs, Jomfru 
Ane Gade is an area where the sun never sets -- which, in summer, is almost 
true. 
</P>
<P>
Alborg is on the same parallel as Juneau, Alaska. In this latitude the 
Scandinavian sun doesn't draw its shades and go to bed until almost the stroke 
of midnight. 
</P>
<P>
Sunset lovers are in for a treat. Brilliant reds and orange, blanketing the 
sky, are stitched with lavender and pink. Rich burgundy bedecks the waters like 
a quilt. 
</P>
<P>
Long hours of daylight on the Fourth of July mean that fireworks don't begin 
until midnight. But there's still plenty of time to enjoy both the ceremonies 
at Rebild and the flavor of Alborg. 
</P>
<P>
In the morning, a parade winds through the old town. Marching bands blare out 
John Philip Sousa favorites as fervently as any Veteran of Foreign Wars brass 
band. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at the Duus Wine Cellar in the Renaissance-era Jens Bang's House, 
revelers gather to skol each other with beer and aquavit. 
</P>
<P>
For an elegant Fourth of July smorgasbord and after-dinner dance, attend the 
lavish Danish-American party in the city's conference center, Alborg Hall. 
Tables the length of a Viking ship gleam with the harvest of land and sea as 
white-gloved waiters uncork champagne. 
</P>
<P>
Across from Alborg Hall hundreds of lanterns light Kilde Park, site of more 
festivities. There, popcorn and ice cream, hot dogs and Danish beer are dished 
up to the beat of disco, Big Band and country dancing. 
</P>
<P>
When the sun finally retires, the night sky flames with the incandescent light 
of spinning pinwheels, bursting rockets and shooting fountains. One firework 
follows another like barraging sequins fired from heavenly cannons. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Fourth of July festivities in Alborg are free; others charge 
admission or are by invitation only. Free concerts are given by the U.S. Air 
Force Europe Band, Radio Denmark Girl's Choir and the Danish-American Garden 
Party for American guests. 
</P>
<P>
In Alborg, get information on all events, along with tickets, at the Fourth of 
July Reception and Registration Office at Hotel Hvide Hus, Vesterbro 2. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for the Danish-American dinner-dance at Alborg Hall cost 220 krone per 
person (about $33 U.S.). 
</P>
<P>
Buses for the ceremonies at Rebild leave Hotel Hvide Hus at 11 a.m., round trip 
about $7.50. Admission to the Rebild celebration is about $3 U.S. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chalk-Mine Gallery 
</P>
<P>
Near Rebild is an unusual and dramatic art gallery. At the hamlet Thingbaek -- 
in an old chalk mine -- are about 100 gypsum sculptures by A. J. Bundgaard and 
C. J. Bonnesen. Bronze works cast from these models decorate city squares 
throughout Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
The chalk mine also is home to five species of bats. In winter they hibernate 
in their museum/mine, but fly out by the hundreds in the spring, returning in 
the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Alborg has many attractions, including the Museum of Fine Art, which houses 
outstanding works by Danish artists and other 20th-Century masters; a castle 
dating to 1539, with a dungeon and underground passages; a historical museum 
featuring a room from a well-to-do home of 1602 and a monastery with frescoes 
from the 14th Century. 
</P>
<P>
The zoo is the second-largest in Scandinavia, and Tivoliland is a beautifully 
landscaped amusement park with 80 attractions, 15 restaurants and snack bars 
and a revolving open-air stage. 
</P>
<P>
The city also has an enormous enclosed Waterland featuring a wave pool, water 
chutes, underwater music, whirlpools, saunas and tanning and exercise 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Alborg's most treasured landmark is the five-story Jens Bang's House, one of 
the finest examples of Renaissance domestic architecture in Northern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The wealthy merchant Bang built his big brick home in 1624. Numerous grotesque 
faces dot the facade -- supposedly those of his enemies. 
</P>
<P>
Though Bang was the richest man for miles, he never became a member of the town 
council. You can plainly see what he thought about that. On the south facade is 
Bang's face, sticking its tongue out at Town Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Dining in Alborg seems to be good, particularly if you order the fish of the 
day. A newspaper elected Stygge Krumpen restaurant (Vesteraa 1) as the city's 
best, primarily because of its lunch smorgasbord, and meat and seafood dishes 
in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Cafe Rendez Voux (Jomfru Ane Gade 5) is popular among residents not only for 
its excellent Danish food but also for its American-style bar and music. 
</P>
<P>
One of Alborg's favorite family restaurants is Regensen (Jomfru Ane Gade 16), 
where steak is served on hot iron plates. 
</P>
<P>
The town's best-known wine cellar is Duus, under the stone arches of the Jens 
Bang's House. Duus specialties are warm liver paste sandwiches and cheese 
dishes. 
</P>
<P>
The white beaches and dunes of the North Sea are only about a 45-minute drive 
west of Alborg. There you'll find old resort communities, some with 
thatched-roof houses. The beaches are so wide that people use them as highways 
to drive from one village to the next. 
</P>
<P>
For a fish dinner, try the Strandingskroen, a 150-year-old inn decorated with 
maritime antiques, in Blokhus. 
</P>
<P>
The North Sea is chilly, and currents can be rough for swimming. To protect 
themselves from the wind, bathers rent oversize wicker chairs with awnings over 
the top, along the sides and the back. 
</P>
<P>
The waters of the Kattegat strait, less than an hour's drive east of Alborg, 
are much warmer and calmer. Along the coast are many beachside villages. 
</P>
<P>
Alborg is easily accessible by train, bus or air, with Scandinavian Airlines 
providing daily service from Copenhagen. 
</P>
<P>

PROTEST ON PIGGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was aghast that Bill Marriott described families as "pigging out" (The Savvy 
Traveler, June 11) in his hotels. First, the condescension toward families is 
evident in his terminology, and secondly, Marriott hotels should not have 
offered the bargain to families if it did not want their business.

WHERE THERE'S SMOKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
R. W. de Vries' letter of June 11 assures us who choose to smoke that Paris is 
the place to be. He further indicates that most of Europe happily puffs away. 
What a relief. Although I have paid the same prices for travel, food and 
lodging as nonsmokers, recent experiences have led me to believe that it is 
better to sit home and watch my bank account accumulate than try to travel. 
</P>
<P>
To be treated as a pariah and subjected to vicious attacks by health-fad 
terrorists is not my idea of enjoyable retirement travel. Although I have 
always dreamed of seeing my own country first, I am packing my bags for Europe.

PARADISE LOST

My wife and I look forward eagerly to your Travel Section every Sunday and 
enjoy reading about all the places that we hope to visit some day. We 
especially enjoyed the June 18 article by Georgia Hesse -- "Voyaging Between 
the 'Lost Islands' of Micronesia." But the article's dateline puzzled us since 
Tarawa Atoll has always been part of the Gilbert Islands and, although nearby, 
not part of the Marshall Islands. Thanks again for all the inspiring travel 
articles which propel our daydreams.

HOT PROPERTY: KASEM GIVES WIFE HOLMBY HILLS GIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CASEY KASEM, co-creator and host of "American Top 40" the nation's most widely 
syndicated radio countdown show -- is buying a house as a birthday present for 
his wife, Jean. 
</P>
<P>
They've been living at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel for several months in a suite 
that is now for lease for $20,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Their new home, which will close escrow later this month, is in Holmby Hills, 
north of Sunset Boulevard and across the street from producer Aaron Spelling's 
home -- not the nearly 60,000-square-foot one he has been building, but the 
smaller one where he has been living for some time. 
</P>
<P>
The Kasems' new home was built 34 years ago and has three bedrooms, five baths, 
a den, a family room and maid's quarters. There is a tennis court and a pool on 
the 2.37-acre property. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be interesting to see if they tear down the house, because it's old 
and on such a big piece of property," said a broker not associated with the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
The asking price was $7.9 million, but industry sources say the house is 
selling for $6.8 million. Realtors involved in the transaction would not 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
The seller was Abe Lurie, said to be the largest landlord in Marina del Rey, 
with such holdings as hotels, strip shopping centers and 1,122 of the 6,000 
boat slips in the marina. Lurie bought a home for himself in Bel-Air for about 
$8 million, sources indicate. 
</P>
<P>
Before moving into the Beverly Wilshire, the Kasems owned a house in Bel-Air, 
which they sold. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Rey of Rodeo Realty is representing the Kasems in the current 
transaction, and Stan Smith and Judy Hanaver of Jon Douglas Co. are 
representing Lurie. 
</P>
<P>
ROSCOE TANNER, whose tennis serve was once clocked at 153 m.p.h., has put his 
Santa Barbara home on the market for $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
"He has been doing a lot of commentary for ESPN, and he travels so much, 
playing in the (age) 35-and-over tournaments," said a spokesman for Tanner, who 
is 37. "Travel is a factor in his moving." 
</P>
<P>
Tanner and his wife, Charlotte, have lived in their Santa Barbara home, at Hope 
Ranch, since about 1985. The contemporary house, on a couple of acres, has what 
the spokesman described as "the most gorgeous tennis court you can imagine." 
The property is listed with Jon Douglas Co.'s Montecito office. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles bungalow where four members of the MANSON FAMILY murdered 
Rosemary and Leno LaBianca in 1969 is for sale for $599,000, but the place is a 
mess, one of the listing agents and other observers agree. 
</P>
<P>
The small (1,655-square-foot) main house, built in 1922 and remodeled in 1930, 
has broken windows, a passer-by noticed, and the guest house is a charred ruin. 
Cliff Claycomb, who shares the listing with Dee Yarnall at Jon Douglas Co.'s 
Los Feliz office, termed the home "a tear-down." 
</P>
<P>
It has been occupied primarily by tenants since the LaBiancas were slashed to 
death there 20 years ago this August. There have been several owners in recent 
years, including one who said he didn't know it was the LaBianca house when he 
bought it in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
"I was upset with the broker who sold it to me, because she didn't tell me," he 
said in a 1978 Times story, "but looking back on it, I didn't get a bad deal. 
It's a beautiful piece of property, three-fourths of an acre on a hill with a 
view." It also has a pool. 
</P>
<P>
(The house above Benedict Canyon where four members of the Manson gang murdered 
Sharon Tate and four others before killing the LaBiancas was also recently on 
the market; it closed escrow at nearly $2 million in January.) 
</P>
<P>
The Grand Promenade, the 27-story apartment building that opened on Bunker Hill 
about two months ago, already has been the scene for a couple of movies, but 
the first TV crew to work there set up last week in a one-bedroom unit on the 
eighth floor that rents for $1,525 a month. 
</P>
<P>
It's supposed to be the apartment where actor LEE HORSLEY'S character lives in 
the TV movie "Single Women, Married Men," produced by actress Michele Lee, who 
plays Horsley's lover, and CBS Entertainment. It may air this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Comedian LARRY MILLER didn't pay more than $500,000 for his condo, as we were 
told by his publicist and reported last week, but he bought the unit, at Los 
Feliz Towers, for $187,500, said Geri Hurst of Twin Towers Realty, who handled 
the sale. 
</P>
<P>
Miller's spokesman responded that the comedian will have "way over $500,000" in 
the condo, with furnishings and renovations. "And he's even having the doors 
reinforced with steel to protect his collection of Impressionist paintings."

HOLLYWOOD DOES REMAKE OF OLD INDUSTRIAL SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE MARTIN, Sue Martin is an editorial assistant at The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The film capital of the world is moving to Vernon. 
</P>
<P>
Well, not quite. 
</P>
<P>
While the major studios aren't relocating lock, stock and sound stage to the 
meat-packing city, more and more television and film production companies are 
setting up their own operations in unexpected corners of Los Angeles -- such as 
Vernon, South Gate and the Eastside. 
</P>
<P>
What has drawn the film makers to such unlikely locales are millions of square 
feet of empty industrial space with high ceilings just begging to be made into 
something Hollywood-marvelous, such as, well, the sewer tunnels of New York 
City. 
</P>
<P>
It's true. Witt-Thomas Productions, makers of CBS' cult favorite TV show 
"Beauty and the Beast" uses an old Vernon paper mill as its studio for the 
adventures of attorney Catherine Chandler and her hirsute friend Vincent, who 
inhabits tunnels and chambers below Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
"What made this space in Vernon so attractive was there was one chamber with 
17,000 square feet totally clear and a (ceiling height) of 42 feet," said Harry 
Waterson, a consultant for the show. 
</P>
<P>
The old building also has a cellar with 12-foot ceilings, where the producers 
could intertwine tunnels to create their subterranean world, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Beauty" is just one of several productions that have been filmed in deserted 
industrial buildings. Others are a pilot for a series based on "Alien Nation" 
and the movies "Robocop" and "Lethal Weapon," filmed in an empty Ford plant in 
Long Beach; "The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai" and "Swing Shift," shot in the 
Firestone plant in South Gate, and the series "Cagney and Lacey," at the 
converted factories at the Lacy Street Production Center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
And a number of production companies have turned to commercial real estate 
brokerage firms, such as the Seeley Co., Grubb &amp; Ellis, KB Management and 
ZSI, which offer listings of available industrial space. 
</P>
<P>
Such sites range from a vacant seven-story office building in downtown Los 
Angeles to a storage facility for perishables on the Eastside. 
</P>
<P>
But besides those millions of square feet of vacant industrial space waiting to 
be bathed by spotlights, there are practical and financial reasons for filming 
outside the major studios. 
</P>
<P>
"Here we're probably paying 50% less per square foot than I would be paying for 
a stage," Waterson said, "and in addition, my support staff is probably 10 
cents on the dollar to what it would cost at a full-service production facility 
at one of the major studios. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
30-Mile Limit 
</P>
<P>
". . . (And) we're not at the mercy of other companies on a lot (at a major 
studio), which are waiting in line for services. We're our own master here," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Another financial consideration favoring the reclamation of empty industrial 
buildings is the movie industry's 30-mile limit. 
</P>
<P>
An agreement worked out between the film unions and film makers provides 
economic incentives for staying within a 30-mile radius of Beverly and La 
Cienega boulevards. As Donna Wells of the California Film Commission described 
it: 
</P>
<P>
"If you go outside of that zone, you spend a lot of money on per-diem and 
travel time. So production companies try to stay in this radius." 
</P>
<P>
This adds up to 6,000 permits a year to shoot in the city of Los Angeles and 
2,500 in the county, not counting independent cities, which also issue hundreds 
of permits a year. And all this brings $5 billion in revenue to the state of 
California, Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Needed High Ceilings 
</P>
<P>
Waterson detailed the search that Witt-Thomas undertook for "Beauty." 
</P>
<P>
"We hired a location scout, and he must have looked at 30 or 40 locations, 
including the studios, around town. 
</P>
<P>
"One of our requirements was high ceilings, especially for our permanent sets. 
One of the problems at looking at warehouse space was you could get huge 
expanses, but it would all be clear, it wouldn't be segmented into separate 
boxes of space." 
</P>
<P>
But at the Vernon site there were two chambers of 17,000 square feet, as well 
as the cellar. And there is also some storage space, which is important because 
it allows the producers to recycle a set. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bring Up to Code 
</P>
<P>
"At Ren-Mar in Culver City (where "Beauty and the Beast" filmed its first 
season), when we finished something, we just threw it away because we had 
nowhere to put it," Waterson said. 
</P>
<P>
It can be expensive to bring an empty warehouse up to building and safety codes 
and make it suitable for film production, as the "Beauty" producers found out. 
</P>
<P>
"We put a million dollars into leasehold improvements here," Waterson said. The 
plumbing and fire-sprinkling system had been upgraded, but big expenses were 
incurred on air conditioning, electrical work and soundproofing -- which can be 
critical when the 10 o'clock train goes by. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby train tracks are just one of the problems that can work against a site 
as a film location. So is being under the flight patterns of an airport or 
being too close to a freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, shoots not requiring soundproofing can use such locations. Music 
videos and commercials can be booked into noisy places because either there's 
no sound being recorded or they're going to use a playback. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Location Specialist 
</P>
<P>
One of the busiest warehouse-location agents is Diane Markoff, who has been 
scouting out-of-the-way sites for four years for clients from Los Angeles to 
New York who are looking for places to shoot indoor car-chase scenes, special 
effects and explosions. 
</P>
<P>
Markoff, who once played the waitress frequently seen on the TV show "Quincy" 
starring Jack Klugman, found herself at loose ends once the show went off the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
A friend who owned the vacant 26-acre Ford plant in Long Beach needed someone 
to help with the property, so Markoff went to work selling film companies on 
the plant as an ideal space for location shooting, luring the makers of 
"Robocop" and "Lethal Weapon." 
</P>
<P>
Through her handling of the Ford plant, Markoff saw the possibilities for this 
kind of use of abandoned properties. "I didn't realize this business could be 
created when I started, but the response was tremendous," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Finding architecturally unique, soundproof property isn't easy though," she 
said. "Old factories and warehouses are frequently scheduled for demolition or 
cannot shut down their operation for filming purposes." 
</P>
<P>
Some of her other properties are vacant warehouses at 49th Street and Santa Fe 
Avenue and at 48th and Alameda streets, and the Firestone plant in South Gate. 
She also represents the Vernon paper mill where "Beauty" is filmed. 
</P>
<P>
One of the original warehouse/studios in Los Angeles is the Lacy Street 
Production Center at 2630 Lacy St., where "Cagney and Lacey" was filmed for six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The buildings' co-owner, Don Randles, explained how he and his partner, Jim 
Knight, got into the movie-location business with their abandoned factories. 
</P>
<P>
"The 'Cagney and Lacey' people were looking for a building that looked like New 
York," he said, "and then, pretty soon, they decided we could do a lot of the 
work. They spent a couple of months fixing up three buildings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fell Into Business 
</P>
<P>
"We now rent the space by the day or week or whatever. . . . Roughly, we charge 
about $3,000 a day. We just had Fox in here doing a TV pilot based on 'Alien 
Nation' (a Fox feature release last year)." 
</P>
<P>
Another out-of-the-way production location is the Dos Carlos Stages at 1360 E. 
6th St., east of downtown Los Angeles, run by Charles Shuken and his partner. 
</P>
<P>
Shuken explained that he just fell into the business. A location scout looked 
at the former storehouse for perishables one day and said: "What you've got 
here, mister, are sound stages," Shuken recalled. 
</P>
<P>
So he started asking friends who knew the movie industry and got on lists of 
places good for location shoots. "As time went by, I finally got feature film 
work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shuken said many feel location shooting in empty industrial buildings is only a 
transitional use. 
</P>
<P>
"Most real estate brokers don't view this as a business," he said, "but as an 
interim opportunistic use. They are typically looking for a long-term tenant." 
</P>
<P>
Lori Willis of ZSI, which has several buildings downtown, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"All our buildings are on the market for sale. Until it actually closes escrow, 
however, we'll rent the building out. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually for one floor we get about $2,500 (a day). . . . We don't take 
low-budget production companies because it defeats the purpose of renting them. 
You take a building worth $2 million, well, $500 for a rental just doesn't make 
it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Affordable Location 
</P>
<P>
And then there's Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
At the utmost north of the 30-mile radius, a bustling film facility called 
Valencia Independent has been set up in an empty industrial building. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia Independent President Robert Thompson moved out there because he 
wanted an affordable location. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't find anything in the San Fernando Valley," he said. "I was looking 
in the Valley because I felt there was a growing epicenter of production in 
Burbank and there was no independent facility in the Valley of this nature. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the cutting edge of independent production because we're near five 
ranches out here. We have the original raw materials needed for film 
production, which are outside locations and a studio for sets. 
</P>
<P>
"The Santa Clarita Valley is . . . home to the (few) remaining outside/exterior 
places to shoot. . . . Who knows? In a few more decades, it will have moved to 
Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the Target stores of the industry. We don't have delusions of grandeur. 
Our destiny is eventually to be bulldozed down for condos. I mean, how can you 
justify using all this space?" 
</P>

AT HOME: WESTCHESTER: SUBURB WHERE LAX IS KING; 
</P>
<P>
DESPITE DOMINANCE OF AIRPORT, COMMUNITY'S INSTITUTIONS THRIVE AND THE AIR IS 
COOL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE APPLEGATE, Applegate is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Westchester calls itself the home of Los Angeles International Airport. It is 
an apt description, for in this community of 50,000 the airport is king. 
</P>
<P>
One-third of the land in the original Westchester community is now occupied by 
LAX and its parking lots and buffer zones. The schools and shopping district 
have not yet recovered from the airport's expansion in the 1970s, which removed 
about 3,500 houses and displaced 10,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, hotels and office buildings have sprung up around the airport, 
creating business opportunities for local residents, but little in the way of 
shopping or other amenities. 
</P>
<P>
The once-thriving retail center along Sepulveda Boulevard with its landmark 
Loyola Theatre has been superseded by Fox Hills Mall in neighboring Culver 
City. 
</P>
<P>
And out of doors in Westchester, the whine and rumble of jet aircraft is 
distant but almost always discernable. Yet Westchester's location and history 
present advantages, too, mainly in its weather and community institutions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Neighborhoods Isolated 
</P>
<P>
Situated on a mesa half a mile from the ocean, Westchester receives mists and 
cooling breezes. And for all the traffic around the airport, the tracts of 
single-family houses enjoy a surprising degree of peace. 
</P>
<P>
Westchester's neighborhoods are isolated from other communities by the airport 
on the south, the bluffs above Ballona Creek to the north and the San Diego 
Freeway (405) to the east. Many of the neighborhood streets, traveling over the 
gentle hills, curve slightly, giving greater intimacy to the housing tracts. 
</P>
<P>
"I moved here to get away from the traffic and noise," said Jack Sivak, who 
sold his house after six months in Manhattan Beach and bought another house two 
years ago on Toland Avenue, a quiet, curving street lined with mature 
liquidambar trees, not far from Loyola Marymount University. 
</P>
<P>
A typical homeowner in Westchester, Sivak works in aviation -- he is an 
aerospace consultant -- and has grown children who live elsewhere. He does not 
mind that Osage Elementary School, around the corner, is closed for lack of 
children. (It serves as a conference center for teachers.) 
</P>
<P>
For him, Westchester is convenient to work and gives him "the advantages of a 
beach community without the crowds." 
</P>
<P>
Nor is he troubled by airport noise. "They were here before I was," he says of 
the jets. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Ann Holmes Schwarz, 55, moved to Westchester in 1953 when her father, an 
airlines service manager, had wearied of the commute from Burbank. "He swore 
that he would move to a place where if he had to walk to work, he could," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Westchester then was a raw suburb. Created willy-nilly in the 1940s to 
accommodate aircraft workers, the community grew in population from 353 to 
about 30,000 without a police or fire station, an emergency hospital or even a 
direct telephone line to the rest of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
As late as 1949, it still had no barber shop, according to the late California 
historian Carey McWilliams, who wrote about Westchester that same year for 
Harper's Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"Never formally planned," he wrote, "the streets of Westchester are a jumble of 
unrelated numberings and sharp, crisscrossing turns; only the oldest 
inhabitants can find their way about with ease. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Community Group 
</P>
<P>
"Yet despite these omissions, inconveniences and limitations, Westchester is 
going ahead, raising money to build a town hall, seeking by a variety of 
devices to improve community services." 
</P>
<P>
A town hall was needed because the Westport Heights Civic Assn., the first 
community group in Westchester, had been meeting in a Quonset hut on Truxton 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
McWilliams believed the cooperative spirit owed much to the fact that the 
residents were all about the same: skilled workers and World War II veterans 
who were ready to buy a house with GI financing and start a family. 
</P>
<P>
The houses they could afford were likewise the same, and in fact were built by 
just three developers: Silas Nowell, Frank Ayres and the team of Fritz B. Burns 
and Fred W. Marlow. 
</P>
<P>
Marlow had recently resigned as director of the Federal Housing Authority in 
California, and his houses were aimed so exactly at the GI market that realtors 
nicknamed them "Jeeps." Most of the houses sold originally for under $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
Today, prices in the neighborhoods most distant from the airport range around 
$390,000, said Mary Jo Bergstrom, a realtor in the area for 10 years. A 
fixer-upper in Kentwood, closer to the airport, was recently reduced from 
$344,000 to $324,000, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The priciest area is along the bluffs west of Lincoln Boulevard, bordering 
Playa del Rey. She said a view property on Riggs Place has been listed at $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Willis Marcom came to Westchester during World War II and got out of the 
dry-cleaning business to sell real estate. And he soon had another calling as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
At Christmas, 1949, his wife was asked to stage a play for Kentwood Elementary 
School, where she was PTA president. She did, and he played Santa Claus "skinny 
as I was," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"After the show was over, we had a party," Marcom said. It was such a good 
party that in order to have more, Marcom and others formed an amateur stage 
company called the Kentwood Players. 
</P>
<P>
Marcom has been performing and directing with them ever since, six shows a 
year, including a musical. The nonprofit company owns the Westchester Playhouse 
free and clear, has a subscription list of 2,000 and guaranteed sellouts 
through 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Reynolds would have lost his attachment to Westchester had it not been 
for the Kent- wood group, which he joined in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
He had come to Westchester to work for Hughes Aircraft, but moved to Redondo 
Beach when his house was taken in the airport expansion. He now lives in Santa 
Monica, but returns to Westchester almost every day to direct the players' next 
production. "This is my family," he said the other day in the playhouse lobby. 
</P>
<P>
Other community groups -- a symphony, women's and civic clubs -- have thrived 
in spite of, or perhaps because of, the proximity of the airport. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the airport today has helped to give us an identity," says Shirley 
Pheil, whose business is to welcome new residents and introduce them to local 
merchants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Apartment Buildings 
</P>
<P>
"I think the community as we knew it is phasing out," Marcom said. "But now, 
you know, people say that Westchester is the airport. Maybe it is. Maybe that's 
the future." 
</P>
<P>
Confined by the airport, new housing is almost entirely in apartments. 
Parkwest, a complex of 444 units, nears completion on Lincoln Boulevard just a 
few hundred yards from the airport's northernmost runway, where houses used to 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
"Now they're building apartments in places they said weren't fit for houses," 
Schwarz said. "I wouldn't live there." 
</P>
<P>
She added that she has never considered leaving Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
"I have everything I want here," she said. "We have the best weather, and 
downtown Los Angeles is there when you want it -- we had tickets to the Music 
Center for years -- but the rest of the time we're off here in our little 
corner, and nobody even knows where we are." 
</P>
<P>
Then she said, "Well, of course, we're next to the airport."

THE SMALL INVESTOR: CAN CO-OWNER SUCCEED IN PARTITION LAWSUIT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: About five years ago we invested in 24 acres of land with another 
couple, our best friends. We agreed this parcel had future potential as a 
commercial site as it is at the crossroads of two rural highways. But for the 
last year our co-owners have been pestering us to sell. 
</P>
<P>
A local builder made us a standing offer to buy our acreage at a decent, but 
not huge profit. We think if we wait five more years we can quadruple our 
investment. However, last month our co-owners informed us that they sold their 
half interest to the builder. He then contacted us and offered to buy us out 
for the price he paid our former best friends. If we don't sell, he says he 
will bring a partition lawsuit, whatever that is. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: I presume you were tenant in common co-owners. There is no law that 
prevents such co-owners from selling their share without the permission of the 
other co-owners. However, if you had a well-drafted partnership agreement, then 
such a sale could have been prevented with mutual buy-out or 
right-of-first-refusal provisions. 
</P>
<P>
Now your new co-owner might be successful in his partition lawsuit if the court 
agrees to order the property sold. A partition lawsuit is one of the weaknesses 
of owning real estate as tenants in common or joint tenants. Please consult a 
real estate attorney for more details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unexpected Risk in a Limited Partnership 
</P>
<P>
Q: About five years ago, I invested $20,000 as a limited partner in a motel 
built by a well-known developer. The limited partnership was sold to me by a 
stockbroker. Everything went well until March and April, when I didn't receive 
my usual dividend check and K-1 partnership income tax return. 
</P>
<P>
When I called the stockbroker, she said the limited partnership is bankrupt and 
the lenders are foreclosing. Just last December we were told the motel was 
doing very well. How can this happen and what can the limited partners do? 
</P>
<P>
A: You raise an unexpected risk of limited partnership real estate investments. 
The developer you named, but which I deleted, has more than 11,000 limited 
partners who were similarly defrauded by what appears to be looting of the 
partnership cash accounts. Other than suing the developer and alerting the 
government authorities, there isn't much you can do to get your investment back 
after the lender forecloses on the partnership assets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Should Landlord Give Tenants 1-Year Lease? 
</P>
<P>
Q: I own an apartment building. My policy has been to give tenants 
month-to-month leases. But at a recent apartment owner's association meeting a 
speaker said owners should give their tenants one-year leases to cut down on 
tenant turnover. Do you agree? 
</P>
<P>
A: Leases protect tenants more than they protect landlords. When a tenant has a 
lease, the rent cannot be raised nor can other lease terms be changed until the 
lease expires. 
</P>
<P>
However, it has been my experience that when tenants decide to move out, a 
lease won't stop them. Of course, the lease gives the landlord a legal right to 
go after the tenant for the remaining unpaid rent until the end of the lease, 
minus rent collected from a new tenant. But obtaining a judgment against such a 
tenant usually isn't worth the trouble. Also, in most states the building owner 
has a duty to try to re-rent the premises to reduce damages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Don't Invest Only for Tax Reasons 
</P>
<P>
Q: My wife and I earn over $135,000 annually and are paying a small fortune to 
Uncle Sam in income taxes. We desperately need to buy some real estate for the 
tax shelter. What kind of property do you recommend? 
</P>
<P>
A: Please don't buy investment real estate just for the tax gimmicks. Income 
property should be acquired for its long-term investment potential, and the tax 
benefits are only incidental. 
</P>
<P>
Personally, I like to buy run-down "fixer houses," which can be purchased at 
below-market prices and upgraded either to hold for long-term investment or for 
resale profits. After the 1986 Tax Reform Act, the tax shelter benefits are 
definitely not a major reason for investing in real estate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rental House Managed by Agent Unprofitable 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am undecided if I should sell or rent my home as I will be moving away 
from this area. After consulting several local realtors who will manage the 
rent collection, I find they want a fee of 10% of the gross rent plus a lease 
fee if a new tenant must be obtained. As this will result in a loss after 
making my mortgage and property tax payments, do you think this is too high? 
</P>
<P>
A: Hiring a professional property manager for a single-family rental home at an 
affordable fee is not easy. The customary fee is 10% of the gross rent. You are 
not being overcharged. From the manager's viewpoint, that fee barely covers the 
expenses of rent collection and supervising the house, especially if it needs 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Since you will be moving away from the area, I suggest you sell your home now. 
</P>

PROTECTING PLANTS FROM CHLORINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Growing plants in movable containers is a possible solution if chlorinated 
water from your swimming pool is hurting your landscape plants. 
</P>
<P>
That way, you can either change the location of the plants when the pool is in 
use or set them up on bricks to keep them above spilling water. Another 
possibility is hanging planters nearby to brighten poolside areas. 
</P>
<P>
Frequent hosing down of poolside areas to dilute the chlorine also may help. 
Using plants with vigorous, extensive and dense root systems, such as Baltic 
English ivy or periwinkle, is another possibility. 
</P>
<P>
The pool itself is another approach. Just lowering the water level will reduce 
spillover and minimize chlorine damage to nearby plants. 
</P>
<P>
There are absorbent materials that will soak up splashes, but make sure they 
are guaranteed to resist chlorine damage. 
</P>
<P>
An alternative is to plant trees, shrubs and other greenery away from the pool 
so that the plants will be safe from chlorinated water and the pool will be 
freer of floating leaves.

EPA TO RETAIN ITS CONTRACTOR TO BAR ADDITIONAL DELAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WARD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under criticism for moving too slowly to clean up polluted ground water in the 
San Gabriel Valley, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has decided to 
keep its current contractor on the project to avoid further delays. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel W. McGovern, EPA regional administrator, announced in a letter to Rep. 
Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente) that the firm CH2M Hill, which has been working 
on the project since 1983, will be retained. 
</P>
<P>
San Gabriel Valley water officials had protested a proposal by the EPA to 
assign the project to another contractor, saying that time would be lost while 
a new contractor's employees reviewed studies and other work already done. 
</P>
<P>
"I am happy to inform you that after careful consideration of the situation, 
EPA has made a final decision to continue to use CH2M Hill on the San Gabriel 
project," McGovern said. 
</P>
<P>
But although CH2M Hill will remain on the job, McGovern also said in the letter 
that a comprehensive cleanup plan, which the consulting firm has been drafting 
for the EPA, will not be unveiled to the public in July as promised at a 
congressional hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Torres, chairman of the House small business subcommittee on environment and 
labor, conducted a hearing in Baldwin Park four weeks ago to examine EPA's work 
on the San Gabriel Valley ground-water problem. The EPA told Torres at the 
hearing that it would present a comprehensive cleanup plan to the public in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
But McGovern said in his letter that the public announcement of the plan will 
not come until the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
McGovern said the EPA will first consult with local and state agencies to 
develop agreement on a strategy. 
</P>
<P>
"It is important that EPA give these agencies a meaningful opportunity to 
comment on and reach consensus on the overall planning for the San Gabriel 
Valley project," McGovern told Torres. "EPA hopes to use its draft plan as a 
vehicle for reaching consensus and develop a plan that has mutual ownership." 
</P>
<P>
"After we have worked with other agencies to refine our strategy," he said, "we 
expect to release the plan to the public by the end of the year." 
</P>
<P>
He said the agency also will hold a number of community meetings this summer 
and fall "to explain this complex problem and our proposed strategy to the 
public and to invite their input into the process." 
</P>
<P>
After reading the letter, Torres said he was concerned about the EPA's decision 
to delay the public release of its comprehensive strategy. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, the letter "is about what I expected. At least we've got their 
attention and their commitment to address the severity of the problem." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moved Too Slowly 
</P>
<P>
Torres said he plans to continue to examine the EPA's performance with 
additional hearings in Washington. Torres has complained that the EPA has moved 
too slowly on the San Gabriel Valley ground-water problem, which was discovered 
nearly 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Torres said the retention of CH2M Hill should eliminate a potential delay in 
the project. The congressman said he has no preference for CH2M Hill over any 
other contractor, but was concerned about the time that could be lost on the 
job by making a change. 
</P>
<P>
CH2M Hill, a consulting firm based in Corvallis, Ore., is one of several 
contractors employed by the EPA under the federal Superfund program for 
cleaning up toxic waste. Because of contractual limits on the amount of work it 
can assign CH2M Hill, the EPA had considered using another contractor in the 
San Gabriel Valley so that CH2M Hill could devote its time to other Superfund 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
At the congressional hearing, Robert G. Berlien, general manager of the Upper 
San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District, testified that "changing 
contractors in mid-project can only result in significant time delays as one 
contractor phases out and another gears up to take over. Vast amounts of 
specific site experience will be lost in the change, and large expenditures 
will be needed to educate the new engineering contractor." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Good News 
</P>
<P>
Berlien said last week that the decision to retain CH2M Hill is good news. "I'm 
happy to see it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Berlien said, he was not surprised that the EPA has retreated 
from its promise to deliver a comprehensive cleanup plan by July. He said it is 
normal practice for the EPA to consult with other agencies before presenting 
major proposals to the public. 
</P>
<P>
EPA officials said they believe it is especially important that a consensus be 
developed in this case because the federal Superfund alone cannot bear the 
entire burden of controlling ground-water pollution in the San Gabriel Valley. 
The EPA has estimated that it will take hundreds of millions of dollars and 
decades of work to bring the pollution under control. 
</P>
<P>
About one-fourth of the water wells in the San Gabriel Valley are contaminated 
with cancer-causing solvents. However, by digging new and deeper wells, 
blending contaminated water with purer water and installing treatment systems, 
water agencies have managed to continue delivering drinking water that meets 
state and federal standards. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the EPA's work in the San Gabriel Valley so far has been devoted to 
charting the extent of the contamination. In addition, the EPA has built a 
system to treat water from two polluted wells owned by the Richwood Mutual 
Water Co. in El Monte and is planning a $5.5-million system to treat water from 
four wells owned by Suburban Water Systems in the Whittier Narrows area. 
Construction of the Suburban system is scheduled to begin in September. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Next Major Project 
</P>
<P>
The EPA's next major project is developing a system to stop the spread of 
contaminants from the Main San Gabriel Basin, which serves 1 million people, 
southward through Whittier Narrows to the Central Basin, whose wells also serve 
1 million people. 
</P>
<P>
The Whittier Narrows plan will be circulated to state and local agencies this 
month and released for public comment in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive plan will outline various water treatment projects that 
should be undertaken in the San Gabriel Valley and establish priorities. EPA 
officials have already said that the list will be headed by treatment systems 
in Azusa and Baldwin Park, which have the area's highest concentrations of 
contaminated ground water.

<P>
GARVEY DISTRICT'S SUMMER PROGRAM SEEKS TO INVOLVE PARENTS IN CHILD'S EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Near tears, the woman explained in Spanish that she felt overwhelmed and 
frustrated as a parent of schoolchildren. Her husband, she said, shirks his 
responsibility as a father. And, she told the dozen parents gathered in a 
circle with her, he drinks too much. 
</P>
<P>
Nodding in sympathy, the discussion leader, Marcel Soriano, responded to her in 
Spanish. The most important thing, he said, is to develop self-esteem. Only 
then, he said, can you adequately help your children and husband. 
</P>
<P>
Soriano is a psychologist and the director of pupil personnel services of the 
Garvey School District, which serves 7,400 kindergarten to eighth-grade 
students in Monterey Park, Rosemead and San Gabriel. The interchange came at 
Rosemead's Bitely School during a two-week summer program designed to foster 
parental involvement. The program, which ended Friday, offered parents guidance 
in how to work with their children. There were activities for the children, 
too. More than 60 families participated this year. 
</P>
<P>
On this day, the subject was gangs. But the topic touched off a discussion of 
broader issues of family life and education. And that, says Raquel Gutierrez, 
is one goal of the program. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an attempt to involve parents in a different way in the school 
system," said Gutierrez, director of the district's Office of Community 
Services. "The parent is the child's first teacher. Involved parents means 
children won't drop out." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Soriano said, "if we develop a good partnership with parents, then 
that will translate into a good quality of instruction in the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
The program began in 1987 and has attracted queries from 30 other school 
districts. "With more and more single-parent families, more dysfunctional 
families," Gutierrez said, "there is a real need for this." 
</P>
<P>
One part of the program allows parents to participate in discussions on topics 
such as child development, drug abuse and absenteeism. "Our parents need 
support, even if it's minimal and for just two weeks," Gutierrez said. "There's 
a lot of risk, if you let parents in like this. Because then you have to listen 
to them." 
</P>
<P>
School board member Antoinette Fabela agrees that the risk is worth taking. 
"The whole family benefits, and it's important because it makes them 
knowledgeable about the school system," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Addresses Specific Problems 
</P>
<P>
And, Gutierrez said, it addresses specific problems in the district with its 
rapidly changing ethnic, social and economic makeup. Five years ago, she said, 
5% of Garvey students came from Asian families; now it's 39%. An additional 54% 
are from Latino families. 
</P>
<P>
Due to this diversity, the district must respond to cultural differences among 
parents, many of whom were educated in Asia and Latin America, where the 
educational approach is not as egalitarian as in America, Gutierrez said. 
</P>
<P>
Latino and Asian parents, she said, often are reluctant to become involved in 
the schools because they don't see that as their role. A survey conducted by 
the district two years ago, she said, showed that parents newly arrived from 
Asia, where parent volunteerism is uncommon, find volunteering in the schools a 
foreign concept. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, said An Tieu, "they don't know about the district and the school 
board." Tieu, an ethnic Chinese originally from Vietnam, is a community 
involvement coordinator in the district. In their home countries, he said, the 
foreign-born parents wouldn't have any influence on the operation of schools. 
"Parents don't realize they have the power to change and influence everything 
here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Torn Between Cultures 
</P>
<P>
Cultural differences, he said, make it even more mandatory that parents become 
involved. "Kids end up torn between the two cultures, and the parents don't 
realize it until it's too late," Tieu said. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the district has translators, Gutierrez said, some parents are 
uncomfortable because they think language barriers restrict their participation 
in school events. 
</P>
<P>
Wai-Kam Chan, one of the few Chinese-American parents participating in the 
summer program, said through a translator: "This is helping me a lot in 
understanding about the American school system." 
</P>
<P>
Reading from notes she had taken in Chinese during the sessions, she said the 
classes on child development helped her understand the pitfalls that can occur 
if she tries to compare her sons' behavior or development. Meanwhile, her boys, 
Elisha, 10, and Daniel, 9, talked about pictures they had drawn and stories 
they had read that morning. 
</P>
<P>
Like many other husbands, Chan's could not attend because he was working -- as 
an auditor for Bank of America. School officials said they hope to get more 
families to participate by holding night sessions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lunch-Hour Session 
</P>
<P>
One father, George Ramirez, used his lunch hour to attend part of the sessions. 
"My boy is in the school system and I need to know what's going on and what 
they offer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After the talk about gangs, Ramirez sat at a table with his 6-year-old son, 
Michael, and his wife, Delia. With a pencil, Michael traced around his father's 
outstretched hand on a piece of construction paper entitled: "My Family Tree." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the room, other parents and their children were doing the same, 
using the outlined hands as if they were tree branches and listing the names of 
parents, brothers, sisters, grandparents, aunts and uncles, and dogs and cats. 
"As far as I'm concerned this is gang prevention," Ramirez said. "It starts 
now."

FESTIVITIES SET FROM DAWN INTO NIGHT JULY 4 
</P>

<P>
Westsiders will be able to celebrate Independence Day from morning to night on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica's 5 a.m. "Dawn's Early Light" at Santa Monica Beach will kick off 
the celebration. Other festivities are planned in Culver City, Marina del Rey, 
Pacific Palisades and Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica began its unusual Fourth of July observance three years ago when 
the fireworks show was switched from nightfall to daybreak in response to 
complaints from city police and fire officials about unmanageable crowds -- as 
many as 500,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
About 200,000 spectators are expected for this year's early morning 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Beach parking lots open at 3 a.m. Radio station KSRF-FM will broadcast traffic 
and parking information, as well as the performance of the Los Angeles Pops 
Orchestra. The Pops will play on the beach just north of the Santa Monica Pier. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Laker Player 
</P>
<P>
A few miles away, the Pacific Palisades Americanism Parade will begin at 2 p.m. 
at Via de la Paz and Bowdoin Street, continuing onto Sunset Boulevard then down 
to Drummond Street and to Toyopa Drive, ending at Palisades Recreation Center. 
Laker basketball player Orlando Woolridge is the grand marshal. 
</P>
<P>
Free parking will be available at the Palisades High School parking lot and a 
free shuttle provided by Mort's Deli and Norris Hardware will be available 
between the parade route and the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
A fireworks display will be held at 8:30 p.m. at the Palisades High School 
football stadium, 15777 Bowdoin St. A donation is requested. 
</P>
<P>
In Culver City, the Exchange Club is sponsoring a fireworks display featuring 
music from the 1940s to 1960s. Gates open at 6 p.m. with the pyrotechnics 
scheduled to start at 9:15 p.m. at the Culver City High School football 
stadium, Harter Avenue and Braddock Drive. A donation is requested. 
</P>
<P>
Marina del Rey's annual fireworks show will begin at 9 p.m. The event is 
co-sponsored by the Marina Chamber of Commerce and the Los Angeles County 
Department of Beaches and Harbors. A Dixieland band will perform at 2 p.m. at 
Burton Chace Park, 13650 Mindanao Way. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Dicks, president of the chamber, said the best viewing areas will be from 
Fisherman's Village on Fiji Way, Burton Chace Park on Mindanao Way, and 
Mothers' Beach, between Palawan and Panay ways. 
</P>
<P>
In Hollywood, the annual festivities at the Hollywood Bowl will begin at 7:30 
p.m. on Monday and Tuesday nights, but both events are sold out. In addition to 
the fireworks, there will be music both nights by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, 
the Los Angeles Master Chorale and the USC Trojan Marching Band. 
</P>
<P>
Private use of fireworks is illegal in the cities of Santa Monica, Beverly 
Hills, West Hollywood, Culver City, Los Angeles and unincorporated areas of the 
county.

CAMP ISN'T JUST FOR KIDS;

SENIORS RELIVE TRADITION OF YOUTH

<TEXT>
<P>
Millie and Caren hiked awhile, stopping frequently to forage in the underbrush 
for stubby branches or pine cones they could add to their already abundant 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
Caren drew a small, prickly cone from beneath a scrubby pine and showed her 
hiking companions how the squirrels had plucked away the nuts. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the pair tried archery. They squealed in delight every time an arrow 
pierced the target. 
</P>
<P>
At night, they sat under a sky full of twinkling stars and joined others in 
belting out favorite old tunes in the soft glow of a roaring fire. 
</P>
<P>
As summer camp goes, Millie and Caren had the kind of experiences that give 
youngsters a lifetime of warm memories. But Caren Roberts is 72, and Millie 
Keairns won't say how old she is except to acknowledge that she is older than 
Caren. 
</P>
<P>
They were among about 30 Long Beach retirees who spent a restful four days last 
month at Camp Oakes, a YMCA-operated facility nestled at 7,300 feet of 
elevation on the edge of the San Bernardino National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
The seniors signed up through the Long Beach Senior Center to participate in 
the three-year-old program, which has become so popular it is being offered 
twice a year. The session was scheduled before the first busload of regular 
young YMCA campers arrived, giving the camp staff an opportunity to work with 
the seniors and a group of handicapped youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
The seniors did not engage in such summer-camp frivolity as short-sheeting the 
counselor's bed. And no one was thrown from a pony. 
</P>
<P>
There was, however, a wild burro that kicked over the trash can in the wee 
hours outside Merle and Lee Harlan's cabin window. And few will soon forget how 
energetic leader Howard H. Hinds set the alarm on his watch an hour too early, 
and awakened the group at 5 instead of 6 for morning calisthenics. (As a 
result, however, all of them showed up on time for exercise at 7, Hinds pointed 
out.) 
</P>
<P>
The camp schedule listed such activities as canoeing, horseback riding, 
fishing, archery, hiking, shooting, swimming and even a senior track meet. 
</P>
<P>
But it did not work out that way. Workmen were resurfacing the empty pool. 
Seniors said the Jacuzzi was on the blink. No one fished -- there were rumors 
that the fish in the camp's lake had died. The shooting range was not yet open 
for summer. Horseback rides cost $10 extra, and no one wanted to risk breaking 
a bone anyway. The track meet was canceled because of a scheduling conflict 
with the boat ride. 
</P>
<P>
More ambitious campers, such as retired barber Dorine Maze, took long hikes 
around the camp. Caren Roberts was the first to try the bow and arrow, but she 
said a stiff breeze interfered with her aim. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clear Blue Sky 
</P>
<P>
Most seniors, however, were content with group activities and relaxation in the 
pine-studded camp ringed by mountains and set under a crystal blue sky. 
</P>
<P>
"We are absorbing this beautiful air," said Hinds, leaning back in a lawn chair 
on a bright morning just moments before he lit a cigarette and took a heavy 
drag. The popular 73-year-old fitness instructor led the group on a boat trip 
around Big Bear Lake and sang old favorites, such as "When Irish Eyes Are 
Smiling," when campers sat around the campfire. 
</P>
<P>
The seniors played games and worked puzzles. They read books and talked and 
painted plaster figurines. By day, they went on a narrated nature walk. By 
night, they went to a small observatory. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked through the telescope at Jupiter. Is that the one with the rings 
around it?" asked Merle Harlan, a 64-year-old retired machinist. 
</P>
<P>
Jake Kepr, a retired butcher, was not content to just pet the horses. He 
chatted with them as well. The bright-eyed 73-year-old said: "I like horses. I 
came to talk to the horses." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eager for Food 
</P>
<P>
One of the most popular activities was eating. "The food here has been 
fabulous," Hinds said before the group dug into plates of tacos and burritos 
for lunch. "Everyone has been showing up for all three meals and eating like 
they were starving." 
</P>
<P>
The seniors were not entirely on their own at Camp Oakes. Katherine Hamilton, 
28, tagged along as a camp counselor. An employee of the Long Beach Department 
of Parks and Recreation and certified lifeguard, Hamilton said the biggest 
problem she had encountered was snoring by some of the seniors who shared the 
same room in the bunkhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not hard. They're on their own," Hamilton said. "I can't tell them what 
to do. It's like telling my mother what to do." 
</P>
<P>
Hinds said the group was a little smaller than on past outings because the 
price had increased to $65, but he had fewer gripes. While the seniors slept in 
staff cabins, rather than the three-sided airy cabins where legions of YMCA 
campers have stayed through the years, he said some considered the 
accommodations a little primitive. 
</P>
<P>
"They expect the Ritz Carlton and they don't get the Ritz Carlton," he said.

SMALL MOTEL IN MALIBU A BIG PLUS FOR VISITORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH J. GARCIA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In most beach cities, the arrival of another motel is usually greeted with all 
the enthusiasm of a new burger stand opening. In Malibu, it's considered a 
major cultural event. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is simple. Despite its world-renowned status as a celebrity haunt 
and beach party paradise, Malibu has fewer than 100 motel rooms to accommodate 
the hundreds of thousands of visitors that come to its shores each summer day. 
</P>
<P>
That room total will almost double later this month when the first modern motel 
in the coastal community opens just south of the Malibu pier. The owners of the 
Malibu Beach Inn, a three-story, 47-room motel, claim the California 
Mission-style complex is the first new beachfront motel in the town in 39 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"By lodging industry standards it's tiny, but by Malibu standards it's huge," 
said Marty Cooper, one of the partners in the venture. "A lot of people have 
been disappointed over the years that when they come to Malibu, there's almost 
no place for them to stay." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Construction Delays 
</P>
<P>
The new motel is located at the former site of the Tonga Lei motel and its 
Polynesian partner, Don the Beachcomber restaurant, which Cooper and his 
partners ran before deciding to raze them two years ago. The group planned to 
open the new $8-million motel last summer but the project was beset by 
construction delays. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to do it right and we wanted to do it within the (planning) rules," 
said Cooper, a longtime Malibu resident. "We tore down two going businesses and 
took a big risk on this project, but I think it will be a welcome addition to 
Malibu." 
</P>
<P>
Although several large hotels have been envisioned for Malibu, projects such as 
a 300-room hotel and conference center planned by the Adamson Cos. in Malibu's 
Civic Center are too large to operate on septic tanks and must wait for the 
construction of a much-disputed $43-million sewer system for the area. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the sewer system is completed, though, local leaders have said they 
will attempt to block large-scale hotel projects because they fear it will 
increase the likelihood of Malibu developing into "another Miami Beach." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper's motel project, because of its modest size, did not arouse substantial 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Original plans for the new Malibu motel called for a 56-unit, four-level 
structure with the bottom level open to allow for ocean views. But the project 
was scaled down by the Coastal Commission to meet the standards outlined in 
Malibu's Local Coastal Plan, and the bottom level was removed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Help Spur Expansion 
</P>
<P>
The Malibu Beach Inn has received high marks from local planners and business 
owners, who believe it will help spur a commercial expansion on Malibu Pier, 
one of the local landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reason I think we have so few motels is that Malibu has never been 
promoted as a tourist or visitors area," said Mary Lou Blackwood, executive 
vice president of the Malibu Chamber of Commerce. "It's never capitalized on 
its attraction but I think projects like this will be a big asset to the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said rooms in the motel will start at $135 and suites at the complex 
will cost about $235 per night. The motel has a small conference room, and each 
room has an ocean view. 
</P>
<P>
"We're thrilled that we're finally going to open," he said. "This is the size 
of hotel that people in Malibu can get behind and support."

TRUSTEE SAYS INCOMING PRESIDENT IS 'PEACEMAKER'

The Rio Hondo Community College Board of Trustees has chosen a University of 
New Mexico administrator to replace outgoing president Herbert M. Sussman, who 
has been at the center of a yearlong political struggle that has often split 
the board along racial lines. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Sanchez, a vice president at the university in Albuquerque, will take the 
23-year-old community college's top post in August, college spokeswoman Pamela 
Jo Cox said. Sanchez was chosen as the college's fifth president from 58 
applicants. Four finalists were under consideration for the $91,800-a-year 
position. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews last week, trustees said that they hoped the appointment of 
Sanchez, 54, the community college's first Latino top administrator, would help 
end the public debates among trustees over the direction the college should be 
taking. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw a peacemaker, a healer," trustee Marilee Morgan said, "someone with a 
great deal of community outreach, a lot of integrity and sincerity." 
</P>
<P>
The board's three Latino trustees have often sparred with the two Anglo 
trustees, charging that the college has not done enough to hire minority staff 
members and work with promising college students in the heavily Latino 
communities that surround the north Whittier campus. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Students 53% Latino 
</P>
<P>
Rio Hondo College, with a student population of about 25,000, serves the cities 
of Whittier, Santa Fe Springs, South El Monte, El Monte and Pico Rivera and 
parts of Norwalk, La Mirada, Downey, La Puente and the City of Industry, Cox 
said. About 53% of students are Latino, according to college records. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw that Dr. Sanchez's credentials were outstanding," board President Hilda 
Solis said. "After meeting with him, I felt like the chemistry was good." 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez, Solis said, appeared willing to meet with community leaders to develop 
programs to draw young Latinos into college. About 6% of Latinos who attend a 
community college in the state transfer to a four-year university, according to 
college records. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez's appointment ends a controversial search process that started last 
year, after Latino trustees Solis, Bill E. Hernandez and Ralph S. Pacheco 
complained of "philosophical differences" with Sussman, who was hired in 1982. 
The three in October voted not to extend Sussman's contract, which expired 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Solis has said that Sussman, 65, has not had the interests of the community in 
mind. "We've had very poor relations with the president," Solis said. "We were 
constantly at battle with Mr. Sussman over issues of community involvement." 
</P>
<P>
"He has a brash personality," Pacheco said last week. "In terms of management 
style, Mr. Sussman didn't meet the expectations of the majority of the board. 
He could be capricious and arbitrary." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Supported Sussman 
</P>
<P>
But Anglo Trustees Morgan and Isabelle B. Gonthier, both longtime board members 
who hired Sussman from the San Francisco Community College District, have 
supported Sussman's performance. 
</P>
<P>
"Herb is a great president," Gonthier said. "He has done some great things for 
Rio Hondo College. Those good things will continue on for years to come. I'll 
miss his leadership style." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan agreed with her longtime colleague. "Herb has had a great deal of 
vision," Morgan said, noting that previous boards had no problems with Sussman. 
"We did not have that type of dynamic before." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez was elected to the board in 1983, Solis in 1985 and Pacheco in 1987. 
Solis and Gonthier are up for reelection in November, and Morgan will be 
retiring from the board after 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
Sussman, who has been a college administrator in California, Pennsylvania and 
New York for the past 25 years, will remain at Rio Hondo College as a full-time 
instructor, teaching classes in human anatomy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no sour grapes here," Sussman said in a telephone interview after 
the announcement that Sanchez will replace him. "In fact, I'm happy." Sussman 
said he had made a decision to step down as president -- effective when his 
contract expired Friday -- before the board majority decided it could not work 
effectively with him. 
</P>
<P>
The board had initially voted 3 to 2 in July, 1988, to buy out Sussman's 
contract and replace him a year before his scheduled retirement. The buyout 
would have cost the district more than $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agreement Not Reached 
</P>
<P>
But after three months of negotiations, attorneys for Sussman and the district 
could not work out an acceptable agreement, school officials said. The board 
later decided to allow Sussman to remain until his contract expired. 
</P>
<P>
"We handed him a 14-karat handshake," Pacheco said. "But he wanted an 18-karat 
handshake. The negotiations never panned out." 
</P>
<P>
The debate over Sussman came as trustees were wrestling with other issues, such 
as affirmative action, student recruitment, off-campus education, and the 
decision to hire a Latino law firm to represent the college. In each issue, the 
three Latino board members and the Anglo trustees disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
Although trustees have expressed hope that the acrimony has subsided, the 
political struggle among board members may be far from over, some school 
officials said privately. For instance, the trustees were split 3 to 2 on the 
decision to hire Sanchez, even though most staff members described the New 
Mexico native as the best person to serve the heavily Latino communities 
surrounding the two-year college. But this time, the dissenters were Pacheco 
and Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
Pacheco and Hernandez favored Los Angeles Community College District 
administrator Frank Alderete, who grew up in Southern California and knows the 
Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
Also among the finalists were Donald Jenkins, assistant president of Rio Hondo 
College, and Raul Cordoza, an administrator at East Los Angeles Community 
College. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Search Teams' Advice 
</P>
<P>
Solis, Morgan and Gonthier, relying on the almost unanimous advice of the 
presidential search teams, voted to ratify Sanchez's contract. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez, an ex-U.S. Air Force officer, holds a bachelor of science degree and a 
master of arts degree from the New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic 
Arts. He is an expert in media relations, according to a biography issued by 
the college press office. 
</P>
<P>
He has worked in the University of New Mexico system since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez said that he hoped that his efforts to work with the community will 
allay fears that the Latino communities will not be overlooked. His wife, Amey, 
will be working closely with various community leaders, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez said he plans, among other things, to upgrade the college's bilingual 
education program. But he added: "We are going to have to take a comprehensive 
look at everything."

SUIT TARGETS PASADENA SLOW-GROWTH LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In March, voters passed a slow-growth initiative that proponents said would put 
the brakes on runaway development. Last week, a diverse array of community 
leaders and organizations charged in a lawsuit that the new ordinance is 
illegal and unfair to minorities and the poor. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed Thursday in Pasadena Superior Court, alleges that the 
ordinance's limits on residential development will reduce revenue for city 
services and restrict the supply of housing, making it difficult for people 
with low and moderate incomes to buy homes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bad law," said Ibrahim Naeem, director of the Pasadena-Foothill branch 
of the Urban League, the lead plaintiff in the suit. "It's perverse Robin Hood. 
It robs from the rich and steals from the poor." 
</P>
<P>
Co-plaintiffs in the suit are the Pasadena Chamber of Commerce, 
Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance of Pasadena, Minority Business Assn., 
Building Industry Assn. of Southern California, former mayors Loretta Thompson 
Glickman and Jo Heckman, former school board President Elbie Hickambottom, and 
ex-Police Chief Robert McGowan. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs contend that the reduction in new housing will 
disproportionately affect minorities, immigrants and others with lower incomes 
than most Pasadena residents. The initiative "unreasonably reduces the 
availability of housing for such racial groups and will perpetuate indefinitely 
patterns of segregated housing," in violation of the federal Fair Housing Act, 
the suit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Salazar, co-chairman of Pasadena Residents in Defense of our 
Environment (PRIDE), which sponsored the initiative, noted that low-income 
housing is specifically exempted from the housing caps included in the 
ordinance. He called the suit a "smoke screen" concocted by development 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a delaying tactic to thwart the will of the voters," Salazar said. "I 
think the real guns behind this are the Chamber of Commerce and the development 
community." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Carolyn Carlberg, who filed the suit, said the initiative also 
violates the interstate commerce clause of the state Constitution and conflicts 
with the California Environmental Quality Act and the state's community 
redevelopment act. 
</P>
<P>
However, slow-growth proponents said the plaintiffs are grasping at straws with 
some of the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
"They've alleged that the initiative is in violation of everything but the 
United Nations charter," said City Director Rick Cole. "Obviously, they're 
operating under the assumption that if they throw in every argument, the judge 
might buy one." 
</P>
<P>
The Growth Management Initiative limits multifamily housing construction to 250 
units a year and restricts construction of commercial projects larger than 
25,000 square feet to a total of 250,000 square feet a year. It also requires 
the city to give priority to those projects that "best meet the purposes and 
intent" of the law while balancing other needs such as producing jobs and 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative, titled Proposition 2 on the March ballot, won approval from 
57.2% of the voters in an election that had a 10.9% turnout. Voters chose the 
ordinance over a rival proposition drafted by the city Board of Directors. 
Chamber of Commerce President Ann Hight, who campaigned against the initiative, 
says voters were "sold a bill of goods." 
</P>
<P>
"They were told that Proposition 2 represented a solution; instead, it brought 
problems," Hight said. One problem, she said, is a $3.5-million budget 
shortfall resulting from decreased property tax valuations for vacant land. 
</P>
<P>
However, Assistant City Atty. Ann Higginbotham said the plaintiffs will have a 
difficult time convincing a judge that voters erred in passing the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"The burden (of proof for the plaintiffs) is very difficult," she said. "Courts 
are very reluctant to overturn a law that's been enacted by the voters." 
</P>
<P>
Heckman, a real estate broker, said the action was not intended to undercut the 
will of the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the people voted in good faith," she said. "They simply didn't realize 
what the total effect would be." 
</P>
<P>
Salazar disagrees. "I think they not only knew the impact of what they were 
voting for, I think they knew what they were voting against," he said, 
referring to the city's competing growth measure. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. George Van Alstine, president of the Interdenominational Ministerial 
Alliance, said that while voters may have thought they were safeguarding their 
quality of life by voting for the initiative, the resulting housing shortage 
may send many poor families into homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
"We are worried that the quality of life for these families is not being 
addressed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the plaintiffs contend the growth ordinance is riddled with legal 
flaws and social inequity, Cole said the law is "the most progressive growth 
initiative ever proposed, let alone passed, in this state in terms of providing 
affordable housing." 
</P>
<P>
"This (ordinance) is as good as it gets," Cole said. "This is the culmination 
of five years of increasing sophistication. This is not something that was 
Scotch-taped together by a bunch of zealots."

SALE OF HORSESHOE CLUB IS STALLED ONCE AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The on-again, off-again plan by two investors to buy the Horseshoe Club in 
Gardena -- which ran into trouble soon after it was proposed -- has been 
stalled again because of issues raised by the state attorney general's office 
and city officials. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to table the application of former 
Commerce Casino President Herbert Stern for the transfer of a city license to 
operate the club. Stern and Los Angeles attorney Leonard Baum have proposed 
heading a new partnership that would buy and manage the club. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City's Oldest Card Club 
</P>
<P>
The current license holders, headed by Horseshoe General Manager Milton Corwin, 
have run the city's oldest card club for more than 40 years and are negotiating 
to sell controlling interest to Stern. 
</P>
<P>
Corwin's group, however, is caught in a Catch-22 that was to leave them without 
a license Saturday.1. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council has voted to permit Corwin's group to maintain rights to the 
license, pending the outcome of applications to the state attorney general's 
office for renewal of its shareholders' gaming registration certificates. Those 
certificates are issued by the state after a background investigation into each 
shareholder's fitness for involvement in a gambling enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
However, the state gaming registration certificates held by the Horseshoe's 91 
present owners were to expire Saturday and cannot be renewed, said Michael 
Broderick, manager of the state gaming registration program. Certificates are 
issued only to shareholders who are associated with an operating club, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Horseshoe closed for remodeling on May 23 and has not reopened. 
</P>
<P>
The Horseshoe's shareholders, who live across the country, are caught in "kind 
of a Catch-22," Broderick said, because their certificates are expiring, and 
city law prohibits the group from operating the club without state approval. 
</P>
<P>
Stern and Baum's $4-million buyout plan, first proposed in March, has run into 
other problems with the city's investigation into whether the proposed buyers 
will be allowed to take over the license. 
</P>
<P>
In a memo recently, Police Chief Richard Propster, who is heading the city's 
investigation, said Stern responded falsely to a question on the application 
which asked whether he had ever sued anyone or had been sued by anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Stern indicated on the application that he had not, but the city's 
investigation found that he has been named in at least two lawsuits. One, filed 
in 1984 by a Commerce Casino shareholder, alleged financial irregularities in 
the operation of the Commerce Casino by Stern and other club managers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Never Sued Individually 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's council meeting, Baum -- who is Stern's attorney and worked for 
Stern when the lawsuit was filed -- said the suit was against Telegraph 
Properties Ltd., the corporation that owned the Commerce Casino, and that 
although Stern's name was among other Commerce employees listed in the suit, he 
was never sued individually. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was later settled out of court, Baum said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Mas Fukai, who among the council members has been most critical of 
the prospective owners' buyout proposal, questioned how Stern could have 
omitted mention of the suits on his application. 
</P>
<P>
Baum said Stern's omission from the application of the 1984 lawsuit and other 
suits was an oversight. 
</P>
<P>
"They were just things that were not on his mind at the time he filled out the 
application," Baum told the council. 
</P>
<P>
Stern, who did not address the council Tuesday, responded to the issue in a 
letter last week, saying that the Commerce Casino was involved in a number of 
lawsuits while he was president, including suits filed against customers who 
wrote bad checks, personal injury suits and suits by disgruntled former 
employees over hiring practices. 
</P>
<P>
"Although I have served as a witness in a limited number of these cases," 
Stern's letter said, "since my resignation, I have not been named as an 
individual in most of these matters." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Resigned in 1986 
</P>
<P>
Stern has said he resigned as president of the Commerce Casino in August, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The current holders of the Horseshoe Club license want to sell controlling 
interest in the club to Stern and Baum, including the right to hold the city 
license. He would still be subject to licensing conditions set by the city and 
state before he could operate. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Bleckman, an attorney for the Horseshoe Club, told the council that a 
June 8 letter to the attorney general's office advising state officials that 
the Horseshoe was closed failed inadvertently to mention that the closing is a 
temporary one for remodeling, and not permanent. 
</P>
<P>
"That will be clarified in writing" in a follow-up letter, Bleckman told the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
Broderick said he notified club officials in a June 12 letter that individual 
registrations would be canceled because he thought the club was permanently 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
Broderick said notification in writing of the club's intent to reopen under the 
old management is needed before the gaming certificates of the present owners 
can be renewed. When all the renewal applications are received, processing will 
take three to four weeks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The uncertainty over whether the Horseshoe Club will reopen "is somewhat 
unique," Broderick said in an interview. "We don't usually have this much 
confusion associated with the renewal process." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Employees Out of Work 
</P>
<P>
The status of the Horseshoe Club has left former employees out of work and 
confused about whether to look for jobs elsewhere or wait for the club to 
reopen. 
</P>
<P>
A skeleton crew of 75 to 100 employees, down from the Horseshoe's normal 
250-member work force, was employed at the club when it closed. Some employees 
picketed outside the club earlier this month to protest its closing. 
</P>
<P>
"The employees don't understand the details," said Barbara Carr, a poker dealer 
who worked at the Horseshoe for two years. "Should employees look for other 
jobs? Many of us can't live on unemployment. We don't care about the (point) 
holders. All we know is we don't have jobs." 
</P>
<P>
About 10 former Horseshoe employees have been hired by the city's other two 
poker clubs, the Eldorado Club and the Normandie Casino, Carr told the council. 
</P>
<P>
Since the buyout plan was proposed, council members have expressed concern over 
whether the new owners would have the money to operate after the remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Balked at Conditions 
</P>
<P>
In May, Stern and Baum balked at conditions city officials required of them 
before permitting transfer of the city gambling license. Those conditions 
included getting a $6-million letter of credit and setting up a $180,000 escrow 
account, which would cover four weeks' pay for club employees if the club 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's meeting, Fukai asked City Manager Kenneth Landau to write to each 
Horseshoe shareholder requesting their opinion on the proposed sale of the 
club. 
</P>
<P>
The council also required the current ownership to pay a $15,000 fee to permit 
them to hold the rights to the gaming license though they are not operating the 
club. The quarterly fee was due Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Donald Dear said the council's actions would help expedite the present 
owners' application for renewal and give a show of support to Horseshoe 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
The action "shows the employees of the club that we are behind them and not 
trying to put another stumbling block in front of the operation of the card 
club," Dear said.

<P>
Costa Mesa Police Capt. Robert Moody will take charge of the Claremont Police 
Department July 17, giving the city its first permanent police chief in almost 
a year, City Manager Glenn Southard announced last week. 
</P>
<P>
Moody, 54, who has been in law enforcement for 32 years, was hailed by Southard 
as "a seasoned professional with a broad base of experience." 
</P>
<P>
Moody succeeds Jimmie Kennedy, who was hired as interim police chief in January 
after the resignation of Dexter Atkinson. 
</P>
<P>
Atkinson resigned in December after a four-month investigation of allegations 
that he allowed a three-time convicted drunk driver to supervise remodeling 
work at the police station in lieu of serving required jail time. 
</P>
<P>
Southard had placed Atkinson on paid administrative leave last August.

RIDER OF CENTURY: CYCLIST LOVES CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK HOLGUIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Phil Millard says the record number of 100-mile races he rode on his bicycle 
last year was only a steppingstone to bigger things, such as a 500-mile race, 
and maybe even a 3,000-mile, cross-country race. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the challenge," said Millard, a 38-year-old printer. "It's another goal. 
I could sit down and say I did it. No matter what, no one could take it away 
from me." 
</P>
<P>
The Norwalk resident is the 1988 champion of the Ultra-Marathon Cycling Assn.'s 
"century" division. He rode 39 official century races last year, more than 
anyone else in the 1,500-member association, said John Marino, president of the 
Irvine-based group. The second-place finisher, Ray Balz of Long Beach, finished 
34 century races, Marino said. 
</P>
<P>
Millard has ridden six century races this year and is training every day for a 
500-mile race in October that will start in Valencia, run through Death Valley 
and finish in Twentynine Palms. 
</P>
<P>
If Millard rides well enough, he will qualify for the 1990 Race Across AMerica, 
sponsored by the Ultra-Marathon Cycling Assn. The event runs about 3,000 miles. 
This year's race will begin Aug. 13 at the Orange County Fairgrounds and end in 
New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Penseyres of Fallbrook holds the record time for the race, which he 
completed in eight days, nine hours and 47 minutes in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Millard, slender and tan, seems almost too casual as he talks about 
ultra-marathons, races of more than 200 miles. 
</P>
<P>
"One guy in the association said ultra-marathoning is a dirty job but somebody 
has to do it," Millard said. "That says it all." 
</P>
<P>
Millard said he was not big on strenuous exercise until fairly recently. He ran 
a bit from 1969 to 1975, when he was in the U.S. Marine Corps. But in the years 
after his discharge, he was mostly a couch potato. 
</P>
<P>
Then in late 1983, a friend bet Millard that during the next six months, he 
wouldn't finish a marathon run. Millard won the bet. He said he ran his first 
26.2-mile race, the Long Beach Marathon, in February, 1984. He ran the San 
Francisco Marathon the following August. His times were only average, Millard 
said, and his body did not take well to marathons. 
</P>
<P>
"I got stress fractures and shin splints," he said. "I wasn't really trained 
for the distance." 
</P>
<P>
Millard bought a bicycle in early 1985 while he was recovering. 
</P>
<P>
"I found it was much easier on my body, and never went back to running," 
Millard said. "I could go out and ride 100 or 200 miles and feel better than if 
I had run 26. It didn't seem like a hard decision." 
</P>
<P>
And there is the solitude, the emotional release, Millard said.

"What I like the most about cycling is you can gear the workout to fit your 
mood," he said. "If you're upset about something, instead of breaking things 
you get out there and ride as fast as you can." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the century races, which range from 90 to 150 miles, Millard 
said he has ridden five races of more than 200 miles. Millard says his forte is 
endurance, which enabled him to be the century champ. 
</P>
<P>
"It's strictly ability -- he who grinds the longest," Millard said. 
</P>
<P>
He finished first in four century events, which usually take him about 5 1/2 
hours to complete, including stops to refill his water bottles. His cruising 
speed is about 20 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Millard, a bachelor, says he trains every day and logs at least 300 miles a 
week on his lightweight road bike in preparation for the 500-mile qualifying 
race. He says he intends to work up to 600-mile training weeks before the 
October race through Death Valley. 
</P>
<P>
If he qualifies, he must then try to attract sponsors to help finance his ride 
in the 3,000-mile Race Across America. Marino, the cycling association 
president, said it costs at least $4,000 to participate in the race. Most of 
that is spent on food and gasoline for support staff and vehicles. Marino said 
30 to 40 cyclists enter the race, and about one in three finish. 
</P>
<P>
Those odds do not scare Millard. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no guarantees that I can make it," he said. "But I found if you can 
dream it, you can do it. Your body can do anything your mind tells it to. 
Seventy percent of it is mental."

ELDERLY HAVE OPEN MINDS ABOUT THERAPY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Far from being set in their ways, older people may be more inclined to change 
their approach to life than younger people, an Oxnard clinical psychologist has 
concluded after studying the effects of psychotherapy on the elderly at a 
Ventura County clinic. 
</P>
<P>
In studies conducted over three years, Robert Knight found that elderly 
patients, a group that had sometimes been considered too confused to respond to 
psychological treatment, benefited from therapy more than younger patients. 
</P>
<P>
Knight, 38, found that patients older than 60 were more likely than younger 
patients to show psychological improvement, based on the Global Assessment 
Scale, a standardized gauge of psychological functioning. He found that equally 
impressive results could be obtained from patients older than 80 by simply 
increasing their therapy sessions. 
</P>
<P>
"Older people don't seem to be resistant to change in the same way as younger 
people," said Knight, an associate professor of gerontology and psychology at 
USC. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Findings Hailed 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Knight studied 231 clinic patients, with an average age of 72, and 
found that more than half improved after six months of psychotherapy. Two years 
later, he compared the results of psychotherapy on a sampling of 125 patients 
with other researchers' studies of 1,200 adults under the age of 60, who had 
been drawn from other Ventura County clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Gerontologists and psychologists who treat the elderly were enthusiastic to 
learn of Knight's findings, which will be published as a book entitled 
"Outreach With the Elderly: Community Education, Assessment and Therapy" this 
summer by New York University Press. 
</P>
<P>
"We've felt that older people were receptive to therapy, but we haven't had a 
clear confirmation," said Robert Kastenbaum, a professor of gerontology at 
Arizona State University. "If he's documented this, then it would be a valuable 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
Those sentiments were echoed by Barbara Roth, director of Ventura County's 
Senior Outreach Program, the publicly funded mental health clinic where the 
studies were conducted from 1981 to 1984. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Programs for Elderly 
</P>
<P>
"People have a tendency to give up on older adults," said Roth, whose clinic 
last year treated 2,000 older people in their homes or at its Main Street 
office in Ventura. "They conclude that they're older and set in their ways. 
It's like, 'Why bother?' 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, they're really rewarding," she said. "I've seen some incredibly ill 
people who would have been put in nursing homes or killed themselves if they 
hadn't gotten treatment." 
</P>
<P>
Knight, who served as the program's director until taking the USC post last 
fall, hopes that his book will encourage providers of mental health to tailor 
more programs for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
While the elderly made up 11% of the population nationwide, they accounted for 
only 6% of the people who sought psychological counseling, according to a 1983 
study cited in "Outreach." 
</P>
<P>
The need for such programs is expected to escalate with the graying of America, 
Knight said. In the 10 years since the founding of Senior Outreach Program, 
which was one of the first state-funded mental health clinics for the elderly, 
the county's senior population has doubled, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Knight said the elderly may respond better to therapy because of their "wealth 
of information about the self and other people." He added that they are not 
distracted to the same extent as younger people by work and family pressures. 
The realization that time is running out may give the elderly a stronger 
incentive to adjust or adapt, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If life has been painful," he said, "you'd like to have some good years." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prejudice Cited 
</P>
<P>
Mental health professionals may have overlooked the elderly because of 
prejudice, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Many feel that the desire of a 70-year-old to commit suicide is reasonable, 
whereas the same desire at 32 is senseless and tragic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A tendency by elderly people to describe emotional ills in physical terms 
hasn't helped matters, Knight said. Physicians who find no physiological basis 
for the complaints often incorrectly conclude that the patient is well, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A 1982 study found that 60% of older people with physical complaints were found 
to have a mental disorder. Knight, who no longer sees patients, said he saw 
numerous examples in his practice. 
</P>
<P>
One older woman, who was upset about her marriage of 45 years, complained to 
Knight of pains in her chest, arms and legs. A man in his mid-80s refused to 
walk long after his physician believed that he had recovered from a mild fall. 
In therapy, he revealed that he was severely depressed about the death of his 
wife of 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of older people are just sad, depressed, not going out much," Knight 
said. "They wonder if it's worth it." 
</P>
<P>
Others suffer from the stress of caring for aging spouses and parents, or have 
long-term emotional illnesses that have grown worse through lack of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"The current generation of older people were well into middle age by the time 
psychiatry and counseling were widely available," Knight said. "Most of them 
think of mental health in terms of the state hospital system." 
</P>
<P>
The elderly have more trouble getting to and paying their therapists. "Many are 
either poor or feel that they should save their funds for future health 
crises," Knight wrote in his book. 
</P>
<P>
In "Outreach With the Elderly," Knight recommends that mental health clinics 
follow the model set by the Senior Outreach Program, which sends therapists to 
half of its patients' homes and helps the elderly apply for public assistance 
to pay for treatment.

<P>
THE REAL FRANK ZAPPA BOOK BY FRANK ZAPPA WITH PETER OCCHIOGROSSO (POSEIDON 
PRESS: $19.95; 352 PP., ILLUSTRATED; 0-671-63870-X) 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Is "The Real Frank Zappa Book" really a book? Can an author who starts out by 
saying, "I don't want to write a book, but I'm going to do it anyway," who 
grudgingly admits that "I think it is good that books still exist, but they 
make me sleepy," be counted on to produce anything worth reading? The answer, 
as nearly everything else about the protean Mr. Z, is both surprising and 
contradictory. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly Frank Zappa, eminence grise of the Mothers of Invention, is the 
unlikeliest rock star this country -- or any other one, for that matter -- has 
produced. An opinionated autodidact of the first water, a fierce battler both 
against censorship of rock lyrics and for teen-age voting, an admirer of 
Varese, Webern and Stravinsky who has had his own uncompromisingly modern music 
conducted by Zubin Mehta and Pierre Boulez, Zappa loves to mock convention in 
the best, most deliberately chaotic Dada style. 
</P>
<P>
Expecting this man to write a decorous, orthodox book is like expecting Manners 
the Butler to burp in public. And even in its design, "The Real Frank Zappa 
Book" pays very little mind to convention. Its authors (Zappa and writer Peter 
Occhiogrosso) don't even seem to like ordinary type very much, bursting into 
italics, bold face, even BOLD FACE CAPS whenever the spirit moves them. And 
artist and designer Awest has added surprisingly delightful squiggles and 
illustrations on almost every page. 
</P>
<P>
The book's literary format is equally unusual. Although, in an unexpected bow 
to convention, it is in fact made up of plain old chapters, "The Real Frank 
Book's" real building blocks are a series of shorter, several-paragraph-long 
apocalyptic bursts in which Zappa, rock's version of cranky raconteur Oscar 
Levant, regales us with a series of ad hominem anecdotes about his life and 
times, showing how he made the transition from youthful goof-off to mature 
guru. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Zappa was never a goof-off. Coming from a somewhat unusual background 
-- his father, a meteorologist and metallurgist who once worked for the 
poison-gas-manufacturing Edgewater Arsenal and brought gas masks home for each 
member of the family -- Zappa was a somewhat unusual teenager, discovering the 
music of Varese, for instance, and being so moved by the sounds that Look 
magazine had called "dissonant and terrible; the worst music in the world" that 
when his mother offered him anything $5 could buy for his 15th birthday, he 
opted for a phone call to the maestro's Greenwich Village apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Bands of his own soon followed, musical aggregation with evocative names such 
as Joe Perrino and the Mellotones, the Hollywood Persuaders (remember "Grunion 
Run," the flip side of "Tijuana Surf"), the Black-Outs ("the only R&amp;B band 
in the entire Mojave Desert") and the Soul Giants. Gradually developing his own 
anarchic spirit and individual brand of satiric lyrics, Zappa founded the 
Mothers in 1964, changing the name when MGM recording executives "convinced 
themselves that no DJ would ever play a record on the air by a group called 
'The Mothers.' " So, "the stock line is: 'Out of necessity we became the 
Mothers of Invention.' " 
</P>
<P>
Soon carving out a unique, perhaps indescribable niche in the chaotic rock 
market, the Mothers surprised everyone, especially those MGM executives, by 
becoming a successful band. But success, typically, did not make Zappa very 
happy, and much of the sections of his book devoted to the Golden Age of 
Motherhood are devoted to Zappa's tales of woe: how this or that record company 
cheated him, how a British concertgoer clobbered him, confining him to a 
wheelchair for nearly a year, how the British government involved him in a 
bogus obscenity trial. 
</P>
<P>
When he's not replaying his tribulations, Zappa spends a good bit of time 
providing what he feels his fans want, which is decorous recountings of those 
wild and crazy times that bands inevitably have on the road with fun-loving 
types like the infamous Plaster-Casters. His heart clearly not in the telling, 
Zappa makes these doings sound about as lascivious as a VFW meeting, and 
perhaps they were. In fact, the most appealing incident turns out to be the 
time when, at the instigation of a young fan's brothers, he drove 20 minutes 
outside of Stockholm to sneak into the bedroom of the youngster, whose name was 
Hannes, and said: "Hannes! Hannes! Wake up! It's me, Frank Zappa." "As 
expected," Zappa dryly reports, "he was very surprised." 
</P>
<P>
If the truth be told, Zappa seems barely able to interest himself in any form 
of recollection. Obviously that is a not inconsequential flaw in a book that is 
at least nominally autobiographical. And what Zappa is interested in talking 
about, what in fact seems to be the reason he agreed to do a book in the first 
place, presents problems of its own. 
</P>
<P>
What Zappa apparently likes to do more than anything except write serious music 
is fulminate against the fools and foolishness of the world, and "The Real 
Frank Zappa Book" consists largely of this hip Andy Rooney's gripes and 
grievances. We learn, for instance, that Zappa feels that "Daylight is an ugly 
time of day," that stupidity is "the basic building block of the universe," 
that "Parents have more to do with making their children weird than TV or rock 
and roll records." 
</P>
<P>
The difficulty is not that Zappa's complaints lack wit (they conspicuously 
don't) or that his targets, like the slavishness of the modern music 
establishment, aren't eminently worthy of his ire. It's just that so much 
wall-to-wall stridency is finally more tiresome than effective. Too good is no 
good, my mother used to say, and that goes for this mother as well.

<P>
THE THRIFT DEBACLE BY NED EICHLER (UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PRESS: $15.95; 116 
PP.; 0-520-06631-6) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Penny Lernoux, Lernoux is the author of In Banks We Trust. Her most recent 
book is People of God: The Struggle for World Catholicism (Viking). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few years ago, when the banking industry was undergoing one of its periodic 
crises, a spate of television documentaries tried to capture the wheeler-dealer 
atmosphere that had led to so many spectacular bank failures. But explaining 
Byzantine financial plays to ordinary viewers wasn't easy, as admitted by one 
obviously frustrated commentator. "Now pay attention," she told the audience, 
waving a pointer at a spidery diagram, "because this is real complicated." 
</P>
<P>
The seeming complexities of the financial world, which are exaggerated by 
insiders' jargon, have a lot to do with the public's -- and Congress' -- 
boredom with the subject. But as pointed out by Ned Eichler in "The Thrift 
Debacle," it behooves the taxpayer to pay attention because billions of dollars 
in tax money are being thrown down a black hole to pay for the ongoing follies 
of greedy gamblers and inept bank regulators. Financial experts estimate that 
every taxpayer will be liable for at least $1,000 in the Bush Administration's 
10-year, $126-billion bailout of the crippled savings and loan industry, and 
that's just a starter: Down the road are bailouts for commercial banks that 
lent a large chunk of their capital to bankrupt Third World countries and a 
government that has consistently overspent its income. 
</P>
<P>
Although Eichler's account is densely packed with statistics, it is more 
readable than many books on financial matters because it deals with a single 
subject, the plight of S&amp;Ls, or thrifts in bankers' parlance, and his 
argument is succinct: that the Reagan Administration made a bad situation worse 
through deregulation and that bank regulators went along with a game in which 
taxpayers' money in the form of government insurance was used to back unsound 
and/or illegal loans. 
</P>
<P>
A professor in economic history who has worked closely with the housing 
industry in California, Eichler has written extensively on house problems and 
served as a government adviser on the subject. While his book is a relatively 
balanced account of the thrifts' rise and fall, he obviously feels thwarted by 
the refusal of government regulators, particularly Richard T. Pratt, to listen 
to his arguments against deregulation. A brash young finance professor, Pratt 
was Reagan's first head of the Bank Board, which oversees the S&amp;L industry, 
and, in Eichler's opinion, the symbol of an idea that propelled Reagan into the 
White House -- to get the federal government "off people's backs." Regardless 
of its practical consequences, deregulation became a byword at the White House 
and the fashion in Congress and academia, especially among supply-siders. But 
as in other matters, Reagan left implementation to "men ill equipped to handle 
such a delicate task." When queried as to why he never briefed the President on 
the severity of the S&amp;L crisis, reports Eichler, Pratt's successor at the 
Bank Board said Reagan had no interest in such matters and that it had never 
occurred to him to talk to the President. 
</P>
<P>
Eichler begins his sobering tale with a historical overview of S&amp;Ls, the 
function of which was to finance home construction and purchase, primarily 
single-family residences. Until the Great Depression, such institutions 
operated with little government interference, but the collapse of thousands of 
banks forced the Roosevelt Administration to take an active role in the 
system's revival. Housing construction has traditionally been a weather vane 
for the economy, and Roosevelt's government rightly viewed the reactivation of 
the S&amp;L system as a priority. Medicine was administered through federal 
loans to prop up the housing market and government insurance to thrifts for 
deposits of up to $100,000, the latter administered by the Federal Savings and 
Loan Insurance Corp. (FSLIC). 
</P>
<P>
By 1935 a system had been put in place that would govern the S&amp;L industry 
until 1980. Though excluded from the activities of commercial banks and 
required to invest the majorityof their funds in home loans, the thrifts were 
able to outbid commercial banks for savings deposits through a government 
regulation that limited the interest that banks could pay for such deposits. As 
Eichler observes, "Had banks, whose main job was commercial lending, been able 
to compete equally for savings or had thrifts been free to make non-real estate 
loans, less money would have been available for housing." 
</P>
<P>
While the industry suffered ups and downs, depending on the state of the 
economy, it performed its purpose by fostering home ownership. But by the end 
of the 1970s that role was no longer clearly defined because commercial banks 
and other financial players, including large pension funds, had begun to 
encroach on the thrifts' turf at the same time that the thrifts were 
diversifying into once forbidden territory, such as consumer lending. That they 
had little competence in such a field or that 15,000 commercial banks already 
provided such services did not deter the deregulators, who lobbied for a 
free-for-all in which all financial entities, S&amp;Ls included, would compete 
on the same footing. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Reagan took office, legislation had already begun to phase out 
interest ceilings and enable S&amp;Ls to make commercial real estate loans, but 
Pratt, with congressional support, pushed deregulation further, by allowing 
thrifts to expand into money market accounts and business deposits and to 
increase commercial real estate and other loans. The aim of such measures was 
to prop up the S&amp;L industry, which was suffering from the mismatch of 
fixed-interest loans and growing competition from other financial institutions. 
But the result was disaster. Encouraged to use ingenious if questionable 
accounting gimmicks that disguised sick or moribund thrifts, go-go financiers 
were able to borrow 30 times their institutions' capital by offering a 
government guarantee in the form of insured savings deposits. 
</P>
<P>
As Eichler points out, the arrangement was like a blank check: S&amp;L managers 
and shareholders received all the profits, while the government was responsible 
for losses because of deposit insurance. Fortune hunters quickly realized the 
potential for gain, snapping up S&amp;L charters for as little as $1 million. 
Thrifts, particularly in California, created "disguised loans," by financing 
real estate ventures that they themselves initiated. Some managers and owners 
engaged in self-dealing by moving money from the institution into their own 
pockets. 
</P>
<P>
Losses skyrocketed, and by the end of 1986 the FSLIC insurance fund was 
exhausted. Healthy thrifts found themselves sucked into the vortex because they 
were forced to contribute higher fees to keep the FSLIC afloat. Even Pratt 
recognized that the situation had become untenable, but neither he nor his 
successors clamped down on the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Eichler argues that the Bank Board should have stopped issuing new charters, 
instituted tough accounting reforms and forced thrifts to reduce lending and 
increase capital ratios. Instead of bailing out bankrupt institutions, he says, 
the regulators should have let them fail because the bill to the Treasury would 
have been much less than current and future bailouts -- Eichler estimates that 
one-quarter of the country's 4,600 thrifts are so sick that they are unlikely 
to survive. 
</P>
<P>
Although his formula makes economic sense, it is politically unacceptable 
because legislators and regulators fear a public backlash. Nor are they 
prepared to go as far as Eichler in allowing the market for home financing to 
be taken over entirely by other financial entities. Indeed, if there is a 
weakness in his argument, it is a willingness to throw the baby out with the 
bathwater. The United States may not be facing a housing shortage, as he 
claims, but large numbers of people are unable to obtain affordable housing, a 
question Eichler ignores. Other experts, such as Carol O'Cleireacain, an 
economist with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal 
Employees, believe that the current bailout must get S&amp;Ls back to their 
original mission, not only through re-regulation but also through conditions 
for taxpayers' money that could produce affordable mortgages. For example, 
instead of selling off valuable residential property at any price in order to 
recoup losses from the thrifts it has taken over, the FSLIC could make it 
available to local housing agencies and nonprofit organizations to meet urgent 
housing needs. 
</P>
<P>
Government bailouts are not always a failure, as shown by the turn-around in 
the finances of Chrysler and New York City, but those that receive government 
aid are under an obligation to change the practices that got them into trouble 
in the first place. Unfortunately, as O'Cleireacain points out, there is little 
likelihood of such reform in the S&amp;L industry unless Congress forces it to 
accept new ground rules.

WHITE BANDITS OF THE WEST; 
</P>
<P>
THE SILENT BROTHERHOOD INSIDE AMERICA'S RACIST UNDERGROUND BY KEVIN FLYNN AND 
GARY GERHARDT (THE FREE PRESS: $22.95; 402 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Charles Johnson, Johnson is director of the Creative Writing Program at the 
University of Washington. His most recent book is Being and Race: Black Writing 
Since 1970. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On June 18, 1984, Alan Berg, the controversial radio personality, was gunned 
down in Denver by members of the Silent Brotherhood, a neo-Nazi terrorist group 
based in the Pacific Northwest and dedicated to establishing an "Aryan 
homeland" in five Western states. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two reporters for the Rocky Mountain News, Kevin Flynn and Gary Gerhardt, 
covered this now famous murder case, then took their investigation further by 
spending four years exploring the key personalities of the radical right and 
"Christian Identity" churches that produced the Silent Brotherhood's leader, 
Robert Mathews -- a martyr to some skinheads -- and a sub-culture of about 
20,000 zealots spread from Los Angeles to Canada, from the Ozarks to West 
Germany. The political importance of their research, presented with narrative 
flair and the novelistic techniques of the new journalism in "The Silent 
Brotherhood: Inside America's Racist Underground," cannot be stressed enough. 
</P>
<P>
According to Flynn and Gerhardt, the constituency of the far right is as wide 
as the badly wounded American psyche. From the center to the fringe of this 
political phenomenon are tax-evaders who believe the IRS is unconstitutional or 
that their money is being used to support Communist schemes. They are Vietnam 
veterans embittered by the lack of respect for their military service; former 
hippies who drifted toward Christian fundamentalism; ordinary, underemployed 
people, college professors among them, who feel Jews control the economy, who 
hate race-mixing, homosexuals and feminists, believe Affirmative Action cost 
them their jobs and will make white children second-class citizens; and people 
who simply believe, "Blacks, browns, and others celebrate their racial 
identity, so it (can't) be wrong . . . for whites to feel good about their race 
as well." 
</P>
<P>
By tracing Mathews' early life in Arizona and death on Whidbey Island in 1984, 
Flynn and Gerhardt provide us with the terrifying psychological evolution of an 
"all-American boy" who, at 11, was so frightened by the Cold War climate of the 
1950s that he joined the John Birch Society. Five years later, while still in 
high school, he found himself attending tax-resistance seminars taught by 
Marvin Cooley. "The very act of paying income tax, which he thought was 
illegal, was aiding the communist cause," write the authors. "Somehow his 
hatred of the Russians was turning around into anger at his own country. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
By age 19, he'd formed the Sons of Liberty, a paramilitary group modeled after 
the Minutemen, and trained secretly with them in the Arizona desert. That drew 
the attention of federal agents. Putting aside politics for a time, Mathews 
moved to the tiny, rural community of Metaline Falls in Washington State, and 
seemed briefly content to live a pioneer life and work his land there. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Richard Butler, founder of the Church of Jesus Christ Christian near 
Hayden Lake, Ida. Mathews gravitated toward Butler, whose plan was -- and still 
is -- to consolidate the fragmented segments of the far right on the basis of a 
religion that teaches "today's . . . white Christians (are) the true people of 
the covenant," and not Jews. He proclaims that, "hate is our law and revenge is 
our duty," and from his compound, where he prepares for racial Armageddon, 
Butler holds a yearly Aryan World Congress that attracts members from numerous 
right-wing groups linked by sophisticated computer equipment and their mutual 
hatred of ZOG (Zionist Occupation Government). 
</P>
<P>
Among these people, with their hidden survivalist camps, and study groups 
devoted to a library of racist literature, Mathews met co-conspirators who 
would form the inner circle of the Silent Brotherhood. "If we were half the men 
the leftists are," said one associate, "we'd be hitting armored cars. . . ." 
Mathews, tired of all talk and no action, took this advice to heart. By then he 
was studying Odinism (the worship of Norse gods) and reading William Pierce's 
novel, "The Turner Diaries," which depicts the counterfeiting, armored-car 
robberies, and assassinations of a white supremacist group named the Order. 
</P>
<P>
Using this novel as the basis for his own gang, and at first the name of its 
fictional terrorists, Mathews' "action group" began counterfeiting money as a 
way to fund a wide range of extremist organizations and sympathizers. Then came 
bombing a synagogue in Boise, sticking up a pornography shop and bank in 
Spokane, the murder of Alan Berg (also slated for death were TV producer Norman 
Lear and a civil rights lawyer) and armored-car robberies at Seattle's 
Northgate Mall and in Ukiah, Calif., that netted the gang more than $3 million, 
a portion of that was put aside to build a guerrilla boot camp that would lead 
to "stage six" of Mathews' plan: the sabotage of power and communication 
centers in major cities. 
</P>
<P>
As the authors report, these were "the most wanted bandits in the West." The 
rest is criminal history and, to the credit of Flynn and Gerhardt, a 
page-turner of a story about the police work that brought Mathews' storm 
troopers to justice. 
</P>
<P>
But Butler predicts that the members of the Silent Brotherhood "will become 
heroes to our grandchildren, like John Paul Jones and Sam Adams." As the FBI 
closed in, Mathews furiously wrote letters and declarations of war. "It is now 
a dark and dismal time in the history of our race . . . we have become a people 
dispossessed," he said. "Our heroes and our culture have been insulted and 
degraded. . . . Throughout this land our children are being coerced into 
accepting nonwhites for their idols, their companions, and worst of all their 
mates. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
A pluralistic vision of America is the goal toward which this country has been 
trying to move for 20 years, a much wider sense of "brotherhood," but for a few 
-- and even a few is too many -- the effort to achieve equality and unity 
within diversity has transformed their feelings of betrayal into insurrection. 
Flynn and Gerhardt have written a book that is essential reading for every 
American. It is a work we cannot ignore if, as a nation, we hope to survive 
this century.

FIGHTING THE ENEMY FROM TONKIN TO TENNESSEE; 
</P>
<P>
SOLDIER'S JOY BY MADISON SMARTT BELL (TICKNOR &amp; FIELDS: $19.95; 465 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Winston Groom, Groom's most recent novel is Gone the Sun (Doubleday). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two men, Tom Laidlaw, a white, and Rod Redmond, a black, return from Vietnam to 
a small Tennessee town near Nashville in the early 1970s. The two had grown up 
together and served on the same Long Range Reconnaisance Patrol team in the 
Army, and so they are close and intend to remain so until thugs from the local 
Ku Klux Klan begin making trouble for them. This is the simplified plot of 
Madison Smartt Bell's stark latest novel. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there's more to it than that. Laidlaw's arrival back in his 
hardscrabble little village is marked by an emptiness of spirit, drained both 
by the war and his father's recent death inside his burning farmhouse. Laidlaw 
begins to eke out a fragile existence, installing himself in a run-down tenant 
shack once occupied by Redmond's family. Aided by a kindly red-neck neighbor, 
he cultivates a garden, begins raising sheep and practices on the five-string 
banjo. All this takes such a long time that by the end of 100 or so pages I 
felt I had learned quite enough details about farming, animal husbandry and 
banjo picking. And then Redmond finally comes into the story. 
</P>
<P>
Redmond came back from the war earlier than Laidlaw, went to New York, became 
involved in an armed robbery, returned home to get enmeshed in a housing fraud 
scheme fostered by a ubiquitous white real estate agent nicknamed "Goodbuddy," 
served some more time and is now free on parole. He gets a job in a warehouse 
where he's ultimately set upon by a tire-tool wielding white man and winds up 
in a crummy rooming house near an establishment known as Mosque Number 2, which 
serves as a restaurant and house of worship run by Redmond's cousin, Raschid, 
who has converted to Mohammedanism. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, Laidlaw has found a couple of partners to form a bluegrass band -- 
Martin Brown, a guitarist with stage fright, and Adrienne Wells, a classical 
violinist turned country music fiddler, with whom Laidlaw ultimately begins a 
love affair. It is at one of their performances in a dingy saloon that Redmond 
appears and Laidlaw is so moved that he steps from the stage and embraces him. 
This begins the troubles with the Klan, which ultimately leads Laidlaw, 
Redmond, and a third member of the patrol team, a half-crazed veteran named 
"Ratman," on a sort of deja vu trip of violence in rural Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
There are sub-themes of "Soldier's Joy" worth exploring too. The relationship 
between Laidlaw and Redmond is complex. As children they played together and 
Redmond's father, Wat, now an ailing old man, showed favoritism toward Laidlaw 
at Redmond's expense, a slight that causes Redmond to resent Laidlaw. For his 
part, Laidlaw wants only friendship with Redmond and defies the Klan or anyone 
else to interfere. On the other hand, Redmond is easygoing and wants mostly to 
be left alone, having accepted his lot as an uneducated black in the South of 
the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
More friction is sparked when Laidlaw finds out that some of the nightriders 
who've been harassing him are the sons of the kindly old Mr. Giles, who's been 
helping him farm and fix up his place. The crooked Mr. Goodbuddy resurfaces as 
a player in a Klan scheme to mistreat a black gospel preacher called Brother 
Jacob, at whose revival Laidlaw's band is supposed to perform. This leads to a 
final confrontation in which everybody reverts to form. 
</P>
<P>
"Soldier's Joy" -- the title is taken from a Revolutionary War tune often 
played by banjo pickers -- is an honorable novel. Its themes pitch the forces 
of good against the forces of evil, the value of friendship and the power of 
redemption. 
</P>
<P>
A problem with this is that the author renders them in spurts, broken 
frequently by long and seemingly irrelevant passages that lead no place fast. 
Although these passages or divergences have some cumulative effect on character 
in the end, one still comes away with the impression of an uneven novel. The 
story's at its best when the action becomes fast paced, not when the writer 
lapses into his "descriptive" mode: giving us the weather report or gaggles of 
complicated interior thoughts. But Bell's writing is very good and his 
storytelling poignant and powerful, enough to make this book worthwhile 
reading.

FICTION IN BRIEF: THREE HUNTERS BY WILLIAM HARRISON (RANDOM HOUSE: $16.95; 250 
PP.)

The African landscape, and Kenya's in particular, seems to inspire rare passion 
in people who have lived there. In his third novel set in Africa, William 
Harrison tells a tale of modern Kenya and the Kenya of the old days -- zamani 
-- through the eyes of a family of legendary hunters. Chili Cavanaugh, a native 
of Oklahoma, was the first American to "enter the insular society of the 
big-game hunters" soon after World War I. His two sons, Coke and Lucien, born 
in Africa, do their wild father proud by rejecting the discipline of the 
British schools and running away to join him on safari. The three become known 
as much for their reckless courage on the hunt -- their trademark is to wait 
until the last possible moment before pulling the trigger -- as for their epic 
womanizing. Their relationship is based on constant competition; between them, 
they have divided up the range of possible masculine proficiencies, from 
whiskey drinking and card tricks to opening lines with women. 
</P>
<P>
When the story opens, Lucien Cavanaugh is an aging bachelor. He is restless: 
dissatisfied with the outfitting business he has been running since big-game 
hunting was outlawed, tired of his solitude and perplexed by the forces -- 
mainly entanglements with women -- that drove his father, brother and him 
apart. In Nairobi he meets a woman doctor, Trey, who is fetching supplies for 
the refugee camp she tends on the northern border. On an impulse, he decides to 
drive her to the camp. As they drive, he attempts an explanation of how he fell 
out with his father and brother. "Maybe it was the times," he explains. "When 
the hunting ended, all the old hunters got out of sorts." 
</P>
<P>
At the camp, they discover that a marauding leopard has been attacking and 
carrying off refugees. Big cats who develop a taste for human flesh must be 
destroyed, so Lucien invites his father and brother up to take part in a rare 
condoned hunt. "Three Hunters" weaves together the tale of the hunt and 
Lucien's musings on what went wrong in the family. 
</P>
<P>
This is a novel of restless men and the bonds between them, a terrific 
adventure story as well as a profound meditation on the intoxication of 
risk-taking.

FICTION IN BRIEF: COUNT D'ORGEL'S BALL BY RAYMOND RADIGUET TRANSLATED BY 
ANNAPAOLA CANCOGNI (ERIDANOS PRESS: $20; 174 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Raymond Radiguet produced two novels and a collection of poems before his death 
in 1923 at the age of 20, having already established acquaintance with some of 
the leading artists working in Paris at the time. He writes with the arrogance 
of a young man who knows himself to be extraordinary, a stance that would be 
repellent if the result were not so absolutely exquisite. He flippantly titled 
his collection of verse "Devoirs de vacances" -- freely translated, "What I Did 
on My Summer Vacation." His first novel, "The Devil in the Flesh," describes an 
affair between a young man and an older woman whose husband has gone to war. 
</P>
<P>
His second novel appears here in a new translation that captures the deceptive 
simplicity of Radiguet's style. "Count d'Orgel's Ball" sets up a love triangle 
in the rarefied atmosphere of post-World War I French high society. A young 
man, Francois de Seryeuse, becomes attracted to Mahaut, the beautiful Creole 
wife of the Count d'Orgel. She flirts with him and allows herself to become 
entangled. The intrigue is carried on over teas, at the theater, in drawing 
rooms. Radiguet spins the erotic tension of the affair out to an extraordinary 
degree, never letting it break or subside. 
</P>
<P>
Radiguet's interest is in the minute schemings and deceptions one practices in 
the pursuit of a forbidden lover. "The unconscious ploys of a pure soul are 
often stranger than vice's wiles," Radiguet writes at the beginning of his 
story. Francois' innocence makes him all the more dangerous: "Aware of having 
shown himself unworthy of Mahaut, he did his best to appear all the more 
amiable. No strategy would have advanced him quite as much." The twists and 
turns of plot come as Francois, Mahaut and her husband deny, then realize, then 
suppress again what they know to be happening. 
</P>
<P>
It is an absolutely innocent story in the sense that the affair is never 
consummated. Although it lacks the cold-blooded calculation of "Les Liaisons 
Dangereuses," the tale yet contains a distinct undercurrent of decadence that 
comes from the willing self-deception and manipulation in all three characters. 
All the participants can persuade themselves of the innocence of their actions. 
</P>
<P>
The book includes a foreword by Jean Cocteau (with whom Radiguet had, in the 
words of the book jacket, "a rather turbulent relationship") and a Radiguet 
short story published here for the first time. The author apparently hated the 
story, but Cocteau gave permission for it to be published, explaining: "Maybe 
the detestable mannerism of these lines will give greater relief to the purity 
of the 'Count d'Orgel's Ball.' " It certainly does that.

SOMETHING FISHY IN SIBERIA; 
</P>
<P>
POLAR STAR BY MARTIN CRUZ SMITH (RANDOM HOUSE: $19.95; 373 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Charles Champlin 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight years after "Gorky Park," his densely atmospheric and best-selling 
detective thriller about a triple murder in Moscow, Martin Cruz Smith looks in 
again on the career of Arkady Renko, the MVD homicide investigator who worked 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
The career, frankly, could not be in worse shape. Disgraced for breaking a 
whole book's worth of rules during the investigation (the murders had 
international political overtones), Renko was sent to a psychiatric hospital to 
have his mental attitude adjusted. He escaped to the mindless rigors of a 
Siberian work camp. 
</P>
<P>
He fled again, pursuing what seemed a soul-eroding downward spiral, and in 
"Polar Star," is working on the "slime line," the fish-gutting stage aboard a 
huge Soviet floating fish factory in the Bering Straits. It is a U.S.-Soviet 
co-venture, with the "Polar Star" processing the catch from American trawlers. 
</P>
<P>
Renko, whose identity is not a secret to the ship's officers and whose 
reputation for political unreliability has arrived with him, cannot leave the 
ship even on its infrequent dockings at fun spots like Dutch Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
When a sexually active female worker (the factory ship is co-educational) turns 
up, against all likelihood, in one of the trawler nets, it is murder, despite a 
suicide note that is conveniently found, well after the fact. Renko is returned 
to duty as an investigator (amid extreme reluctance, on his part and everybody 
else's). His job, it is made clear, is to prove that it wasn't murder. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who reportedly talked his way onto one of the actual Soviet factory 
ships in guise of a magazine journalist and stayed until a Newsweek story on 
"Gorky Park" blew his cover, reports the shape, size, smells, work routines 
(alternately dangerous and depressing), off-hours life-style and weather 
conditions (invariably foul) of the Polar Star and its accompanying trawlers in 
endless and engrossing detail. 
</P>
<P>
Like first-rate fiction in any genre, Smith and "Polar Star" take the reader 
deep into unfamiliar territory, and the journey has the excitement of fine 
reportage. 
</P>
<P>
But Smith is also very good indeed at inventing what goes on in this exotic 
environment. Renko has a terrible time. He is lied to (of course) at every 
level. He is slugged and left to die in one of the quick-freeze lockers -- a 
stunning narrative sequence. There are chases aboard and ashore. (He is able to 
be smuggled ashore at Dutch Harbor, where the plot thickens further.) There are 
hair's-breadth escapes from fire and knife and a climactic confrontation on 
treacherous ice. Of comfort no man speak. 
</P>
<P>
With all the action, Smith is also, as he was in "Gorky Park," fascinated by 
the dynamics of Soviet society: the edgy relationships within it and the mental 
states of a man like Renko, who does his unsuccessful best to appear gray in a 
gray society but who is by nature a kind of pre-glasnost maverick, likely to 
find the hot water in any society. 
</P>
<P>
One crime fiction anthology said of "Gorky Park" that along with its 
excellences of style and plot came a pervasive air of "dismal hopelessness." 
</P>
<P>
Renko's pursuit of the murder, despite all the unofficial and official 
obstacles put in his way, leads him to a ring of smugglers. The smuggling is 
not really big-time stuff, but it eloquently suggests a deep thirst for 
capitalist fancy-goods. He discovers evidence as well of distrustful espionage 
by both the Soviets and the Americans (a nicely satiric commentary on the 
paranoia that glasnost and perestroika have not significantly eradicated). 
</P>
<P>
The dismal hopelessness has not been eradicated either. Life along the slime 
line appears almost as dismal as hopelessness ever gets. Flashing back on his 
escape from Moscow to Siberia, managed with the help of friends, Renko muses: 
"It was as if everyone traveled the world in the dark, never knowing where he 
was going, blindly following a road that twisted, rose and fell. The hand that 
pushed you down one day helped you up the next." 
</P>
<P>
There is at least a glimmer of hope in such a musing -- light along the tunnel 
if not yet visible at the end of it. And the hope has a sardonic tinge. A 
friend who is helping him escape to Siberia explains why Renko will be safe 
there: "They say some waters are too cold even for sharks." 
</P>
<P>
The writing in thrillers is frequently of serviceable but not distinguished or 
exhilarating prose. Ludlum and Forsyth are read for their action and their 
complex and occasionally ingenious plottings. John le Carre, second to no one 
as an inventor of convoluted plots, is perhaps most enjoyed as a prose stylist 
capturing mental and emotional states of marvelous subtlety. 
</P>
<P>
Smith is not quite in Le Carre's class. But, as when he is evoking the austere 
seascapes of this remote geography, he achieves a kind of prose poetry. "Gulls 
burst over the Polar Star as if blown by light that rolled like a wind over the 
factory ship. Clouds lit. The windows of the trawlers flashed, and at last, out 
of the dark rose the low, green shore of home." 
</P>
<P>
"Polar Star" joins the still-narrow shelf of novels of crime that transcend the 
form and, in the name of entertainment, illuminate their time.

In his essay on Marshall McLuhan, Thomas Cahill states that "virtually 
everybody admits to not having finished any of his books. . . ." I certainly 
believe that Cahill is included. To refer to his most famous work, "The Medium 
is the Massage," as "The Medium is the Message" is to say very little regarding 
Cahill's undertaking of the work. Aye, there's the rub!

HOMAGE TO BRAUTIGAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As one of Gerald Locklin's publishers, I'm pleased that he followed the advice 
in a recent newsletter I wrote for authors who have published books to their 
credit: Be controversial. I'm astounded, though, at what it takes to be 
controversial these days. His poem "Homage to John Cage" is written in the 
style of Richard Brautigan's "1891-1944" (same "text" as Locklin) from "Rommel 
Drives On Deep Into Egypt," the "text" of which is claimed to be "original" by 
several of your readers. I'm willing to bet a cup of coffee that Locklin knew 
his poem was influenced by Brautigan, but that few of your other readers were 
aware of this.

Tim Rutten should have caught on to a blatant historic error in the book, 
"Russian Icons" by Father Vladimir Ivanov (Book Review, June 4). I am referring 
to the statement "icons dating from the 12th to the 20th Century." The title of 
this book, "Russian Icons," and the mention of the 12th Century, do not follow, 
for there was no "Russia" in the 12th Century. The Moscovy State, the precursor 
of modern Russia, was not founded until the middle of the 13th Century. In AD 
988, the year Christianity was officially accepted in this area, the reigning 
seat of power was concentrated in the Kievan State, which has a separate 
history from that of Moscow. All this information is clearly spelled out in the 
historic archives of various Ukrainian universities, especially in archives 
dealing with religious history. However, noting that Father Ivanov is 
associated with the Moscow Ecclesiastical Academy, I am not surprised at this 
little historic "slip up."

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE WOMAN WARRIOR BY MAXINE HONG KINGSTON (VINTAGE: $6.95)

Maxine Hong Kingston blends personal memory, family history and fantasy in this 
impressionistic autobiography, which won a National Book Critic's Circle Award 
in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
A first-generation American, Kingston describes the conflict between her 
emerging Western identity and the submissive behavior her Chinese-born parents 
expected. Differing cultural attitudes often crystallized around minor points: 
Americans regard it as good manners to look a listener in the eye; Chinese are 
taught to modestly avert their eyes as a sign of respect. 
</P>
<P>
However, the key to the conflict was the clash between Kingston's nascent 
feminism and the sexism of traditional Chinese culture. In her parents' 
village, peasant girls were born to servitude, slavery and, often, infanticide, 
while the birth of a boy was an occasion for a village-wide party. Even in the 
United States, a great-uncle called her and five other female relatives 
"maggots" at meal times, but lavished gifts on his only grandson. 
</P>
<P>
This beautifully written book is notable for its captivating imagery as well as 
its intriguing subject.

CLASSICS ON CASSETTE: THE SOUND OF WANTON SECRETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEITH LOVE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Soon after "Madame Bovary" was published in 1857, Gustave Flaubert began work 
on an English translation. He was assisted by his niece's governess, who also 
shared the author's bed on occasion. 
</P>
<P>
Flaubert's version would have been the one to put on audio cassette, given his 
obsession with rhythm and precision. But according to Herbert Lottman's 
excellent biography, "Flaubert" (Little, Brown, 1989), that translation has 
never been found. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the recording companies used one published in 1886 by Karl Marx's 
daughter, Eleanor Marx-Aveling. (It is no longer copyrighted, hence its 
attraction.) 
</P>
<P>
It is astonishing that this first English translation of "Madame Bovary" came 
out so long after the novel's publication. Even in Flaubert's day the book's 
realistic detail and the detachment of its narrator were recognized as 
monumental steps in the craft of the novel. 
</P>
<P>
That detachment, incidentally, was one reason Flaubert was charged by the 
French government with "transgressing against morality and religion" when 
"Madame Bovary" first ran in magazine installments. 
</P>
<P>
The state censors were outraged that the author drew no moral lessons from Emma 
Bovary's adulteries, and they felt certain passages ridiculed religion. 
</P>
<P>
The judge concluded that "Madame Bovary" was a serious work and declared 
Flaubert not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
It had been so long since I read "Madame Bovary" that I had forgotten much of 
it when I sampled the recorded versions. Or maybe listening to it was such a 
different experience that certain scenes seemed totally new to me. 
</P>
<P>
Take the description of the agricultural fair. Lottman says Flaubert worked on 
it endlessly in order to blend the doings in the background with what was going 
on in the foreground -- "a gentleman warming up a lady," as Flaubert put it in 
a letter to a friend. 
</P>
<P>
As the aristocrat Rodolphe lures Emma Bovary into adultery, the awarding of 
medals for agricultural projects drones on incongruously in the background. 
</P>
<P>
I do not remember appreciating the brilliance of that scene when I read the 
book. But I found it riveting on tape. 
</P>
<P>
It must be a special challenge to read this complicated scene for cassette 
without confusing listeners, but the British actress Davina Porter accomplishes 
it magnificently for Recorded Books. 
</P>
<P>
Porter's entire reading of "Madame Bovary" is a performance against which all 
others must be measured. Throughout her reading, which lasts 13 hours, I wanted 
to replay sentences again and again just to hear her pronounce certain words. 
</P>
<P>
And Porter wickedly reinforces Flaubert's intent when she speaks for the 
fatuous Monsieur Homais, the character Flaubert created as a send-up of the 
French bourgeoisie. 
</P>
<P>
The Davina Porter reading is available from Recorded Books (800-638-1304) for a 
monthly rental of $11.50 or outright purchase for $65.95. I mention the latter 
price because this is such a beautiful reading it is worth owning. 
</P>
<P>
Audio Book Contractors also offers a good reading of "Madame Bovary" by Flo 
Gibson at the purchase price of $39.95. (202-363-3429). 
</P>
<P>
Walter Zimmerman reads "Madame Bovary" for Books on Tape (800-626-3333). The 
monthly rental is $18.50; purchase price $72. 
</P>
<P>
Although I prefer hearing a woman read this book, I did like Zimmerman's 
reading of my favorite scene, the one in which Emma and Charles attend a ball 
at the estate of the Marquis d'Andervilliers. It is here that we get a hint of 
the fantasies that will lead Emma into her wanton secret life. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting at the marquis' table, Emma notices an old man eating all by himself at 
the other end, "letting drops of gravy drip from his mouth." 
</P>
<P>
He is, she learns, the marquis' father-in-law, an old duke who was once the 
lover of Queen Marie Antoinette. 
</P>
<P>
Flaubert wrote: "He had lived a life of noisy debauch, full of duels, bets, 
elopements; he had squandered his fortune and frightened all his family. A 
servant behind his chair named aloud to him in his ear the dishes that he 
pointed to stammering; and constantly Emma's eyes turned involuntarily to this 
old man with pendulous lips, as to something extraordinary. He had lived at 
Court and slept in the bed of queens!"

PAUL DOKTOR, 70, VIENNESE-BORN VIOLIST FAMED AS SOLOIST, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Doktor, a Viennese-born violist who was one of the few devotees of his 
instrument to establish a career as a soloist, has died in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported that he died June 21 at age 70 of a heart attack 
while undergoing tests at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Known for his teaching as well as for performing, Doktor graduated from the 
Vienna Academy of Music in 1938; in 1942 he became the first violist to win the 
Geneva International Music Competition. 
</P>
<P>
He had left Vienna in 1938 and, after performing for several years in Europe, 
particularly Switzerland, moved to the United States in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
In this country he taught at the Philadelphia Academy, Juilliard School of 
Music and New York University. From 1972 to 1975 he was a member of the New 
String Trio of New York.

FATAL ACCIDENT IN ANAHEIM BAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with interest the brief editorial about the dangers of alcohol and 
boating ("A Goal of Sobriety at Sea," June 25). 
</P>
<P>
However, the editorial contained an error. It stated that the boating accident 
in Anaheim Bay that killed five people happened in 1983. It actually happened 
in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
As an editor, I understand that such errors can creep into copy. But I feel 
it's important to correct the error in print for two reasons: one, those killed 
were alive in 1983; and two, because this editorial might, in turn, be used as 
a reference someday and 1983 would go on to be incorrectly cited as the date of 
the accident. 
</P>
<P>
I think it's great what Mothers Against Drunk Driving is doing. Within the 
boating press, there has been a lot of discussion about the topic of alcohol 
and boating. I am happy that the subject is seeing the light of day in the 
general press as well and hope the message continues to reach more people.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE TO O.C. ABOUT DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On April 25, George Bush, President of the United States, paid a visit to 
Orange County to present local law enforcement officials with more than $4 
million confiscated from local drug dealers. Members of the various media were 
there and dutifully documented the occasion, or did they? 
</P>
<P>
In his 20-minute presentation, President Bush discussed the tragic devastation 
perpetrated by drugs. He mentioned the 401 Orange County residents, ranging in 
age from 1 month to 82 years, who had died with cocaine and/or heroin in their 
systems in the 27 months preceding his visit. 
</P>
<P>
The President commended the officers of the Orange County Regional Narcotics 
Suppression Program who, in the same 27-month period, had taken 37 million 
doses of cocaine and 9 million injections of heroin off the streets of Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
As he has done before, President Bush called upon each member of our society to 
do whatever they could, individually or collectively, to help rid our county of 
the plague of illicit narcotics. The President praised the residents of Orange 
County, the high school students, the business leaders, church groups, sports 
organizations, civic leaders and the private individuals who had already 
answered his call to halt the demand for these substances by getting the word 
out: "We want a drug-free America." 
</P>
<P>
The President asked that even more people get involved and end the devastation 
and undermining of our society. Then, and only then, did the President present 
more than $4 million to local law enforcement, along with his entreaty to "keep 
up the good work and continue to set an example for the rest of our great 
country." 
</P>
<P>
Did the media accurately document the true and correct context of President 
Bush's visit to Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
Did they assist him in getting out the message that a resident of Orange County 
dies every other day with cocaine or heroin in his system? 
</P>
<P>
Did they point out that, in slightly more than two years, enough drugs were 
taken off the streets of Orange County to supply every man, woman and child in 
the county with 15 doses of cocaine and four injections of heroin? 
</P>
<P>
Did the media address the alarming fact that, even with a successful 
interdiction rate of 20% by local law enforcement, cocaine and heroin worth 
more than $15 million enters our county each and every month? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps members of the media merely misunderstood the true purpose of the 
President's visit to Orange County. A visit, mind you, that was initiated by 
the President and not, as was implied by grandstanding officials some two 
months later, as a "dog-and-pony show" or "political posturing" by local law 
enforcement figures. 
</P>
<P>
Let's all get with the program to support a drug-free Orange County.

FAILED LAGUNA HILLS CITYHOOD ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On June 6, voters of Laguna Hills rejected cityhood, the majority of the 
dissent originating from Leisure World (within two golf shots of my home). 
However, to my dismay, the registrar of voters informed me that my precinct of 
Laguna Hills was not included in the election. 
</P>
<P>
Since state law prohibits the same area from seeking cityhood within two years 
of a failed attempt (The Times, June 25), why not exclude Leisure World and 
allow them to be the rugged individualists that they wish to be? After all, 
they provide their own security needs and street maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
After surveying my neighbors, I decided that by including all areas of Laguna 
Hills, the 284-vote margin would be nullified (with or without Leisure World). 
But this solution appears to be too difficult, so let's try redrawing the 
boundary lines and let the votes fall where they may.

THE STATE OF HEALTH CARE IN AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recently a man in the prime of his life died because he had no medical 
insurance. Nine hospitals refused to admit him. This is a shocking indictment 
of the pathological state of health care in America. 
</P>
<P>
There are millions of such stories involving the unaffordability of health care 
insurance, of elderly people and those with catastrophic illnesses unable to 
pay for treatment, of unethical billing and waste in the hospital industry. 
</P>
<P>
Private health care has failed and is in chaos in America as Blue Cross raises 
its rates by 2% and others are in bankruptcy. We must have a national health 
care program patterned after the Canadian system.

LOOKING INTO PAST OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The president of the board of directors of Planned Parenthood, Jeanette Reese, 
offers in her article ("Office of Family Planning," June 25) reasons why the 
people of California should be happy to spend $34.6 million of their money in 
order to help them keep their "clinic" doors open. One reason is that it "will 
save at least $400 million in future costs." 
</P>
<P>
Planned Parenthood sells itself as a caring, professional family planning 
organization, when in fact it is the largest abortion provider and advocate in 
the United States. Under the guise of "reproductive rights," "unwanted 
children," "poor mothers," and other popular masks, Planned Parenthood 
continues to deceive the American taxpayer in supporting their immoral deeds. 
</P>
<P>
To truly understand the goals of Planned Parenthood, it is necessary to go back 
and discover the organization's roots. Margaret Sanger (1883-1966) was the 
founder of Planned Parenthood. She believed in the ideology of a superior breed 
ruling over the impure masses. Sanger considered the poor, immigrants, 
non-whites and certain religious groups as "reckless breeders," saying they 
would eventually bring "biological destruction" upon the world. She coined such 
phrases as "More children from the fit, less from the unfit," and "Birth 
Control: to create a race of thoroughbreds." Hitler had the same plan. The 
league's name was changed (from American Birth Control League) to Planned 
Parenthood in 1942 because of the negative public reaction to the eugenics 
program in Germany during the '30s and '40s. 
</P>
<P>
Appalling as these statements are, no major leader of Planned Parenthood has 
yet repudiated Sanger's comments or beliefs. On the contrary, she is upheld as 
a shining example. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986 Planned Parenthood made over $21 million by performing abortions. 
Government funding, Planned Parenthood's largest source of revenue, provides up 
to $91 million of taxpayer funds each year. There's more and more and more.

HIGH-SPEED TRAIN, COMMUTER INTERESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A high-speed train to take people to Las Vegas, where they lose money, while 
thousands sweat it out on freeways driving to work means only one thing: The 
gambling interests are lining the politicians' pockets with bribes. 
</P>
<P>
Who lobbies for the commuter? All he can do is write letters saying how much we 
need a good transportation system for the commuters. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe we could talk Las Vegas into having the train operate so commuters would 
benefit too.

NEWSMAKERS: AN OLD SOLDIER SENDS HIS SALUTE

<TEXT>

Charles Lindberg's voice carries a commanding presence in the nation's swirling 
controversy over the Supreme Court's recent decision to permit the desecration 
of the flag as a protest. Lindberg, of Minneapolis, is the sole surviving 
Marine who helped raise the first U.S. flag on the Japanese island of Iwo Jima 
during World War II, and he backs President Bush's call for a constitutional 
amendment to protect the flag. "I like that. I like that very much," said 
Lindberg, 69, who called the flag a "unique national symbol." Lindberg was not 
one of the Marines who hoisted the flag in the Pulitzer Prize-winning photo 
that is perhaps the most famous picture to come out of the war. That flag was 
raised four hours after Lindberg and five others raised a smaller flag on Mt. 
Suribachi on Feb. 23, 1945. "I wish I had those (Supreme Court) judges up on 
that mountain when we raised that flag," Lindberg said. "Maybe they would learn 
something. Maybe they would learn what it means to people. When that flag went 
up, and to hear all those cheers from the harbor, it really made you proud."

 -- Because of Vinod Chachra, president of the Virginia Tech Library Systems in 
Blacksburg, Va., Soviet citizens can look to the day when they will not have to 
wait five days to borrow a book from the Lenin Library. Chachra is opening 
discussions later this month in Moscow with the library's director, Nikolai 
Semyonovich Kartashov, to set up a computerized card catalogue system, which is 
expected to be operational in four years. "This is really opening up access to 
information," Chachra said. "In one sense, this is bringing in more equality 
with the technology. By automating the system, it greatly increases the access 
to all people." The library is located off Red Square and has 35 million 
volumes -- in comparison, the Library of Congress has 26 million books and the 
New York Public Library has 6 million. It was founded in 1862 as the Rumiantsev 
Library, and it is said that such luminaries as Lenin, Tolstoy, Dostoevski and 
Chekhov studied there.

 -- From Boise, Ida., comes word that the Andrus and Church families have 
engaged in a merger, of sorts. Kelly Andrus, 28, the youngest daughter of Gov. 
Cecil D. Andrus, announced her engagement to Chase Church, 31, son of the late 
Sen. Frank Church. A late summer or early fall marriage is planned. The 
governor had served as Interior secretary under President Jimmy Carter. Frank 
Church, who died in 1984, served in the Senate for 24 years and ran for the 
Democratic nomination for President in 1976. JAMES MARNELL

U.S. INDICTS TAHOE MAYOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal grand jury indicted South Lake Tahoe Mayor Terry Trupp and four other 
men on cocaine, money-laundering and currency violations growing out of a sting 
operation dubbed Deep Snow. Trupp, 46, was denied bail after his arrest June 11 
and is in jail awaiting arraignment July 5 before a federal magistrate. His 
wife, Kimberly, 24, who was freed on $100,000 bail, was not named in the two 
indictments. Trump is accused of conspiring to possess with intent to 
distribute 100 kilograms of cocaine and of money-laundering. During Trupp's 
detention hearing earlier this month, Assistant U.S. Atty. Tom Flynn produced 
transcripts of recorded conversations between Trupp and undercover agents in

A mother who reported two baby daughters abducted in similar incidents three 
years apart has been arrested in Alton, Ill., in connection with the second 
infant's death. Paula Sims, 29, was charged with obstructing justice and 
concealing a homicidal death, in the case two months ago of daughter Heather 
Lee. Sims and her husband, Robert, reported the 6-week-old girl abducted on 
April 29 from their home in Alton. The child's body was found in a trash can 
across the Mississippi River on May 3. In 1986, the couple's firstborn 
daughter, 13-day-old Loralei, was also reported missing under similar 
circumstances.

A former Exxon computer operator said he accidentally erased computer copies of 
thousands of documents on the Alaskan oil spill, the New York Times said in its 
Sunday editions. An Exxon spokesman confirmed the destruction but said company 
lawyers believe other copies exist either on paper or in other computer files. 
Kenneth A. Davis, a computer operator who had worked at Exxon's Houston office, 
said it would be difficult to determine which documents had been destroyed. 
Davis, 33, was fired June 8, the day after the destruction was detected. He 
said his superiors had been negligent in safeguarding the records and he 
decided to contact the newspaper because "they are making me the scapegoat." 
Exxon has been under a federal court order to preserve all records concerning 
the March 24 spill in Prince William Sound.

Talks on forming a new Irish government broke down when the center-right 
Progressive Democrats insisted on a coalition with caretaker Prime Minister 
Charles Haughey. Haughey, forced to resign Thursday after a snap election that 
left his Fianna Fail party worse off than before, has ruled out any coalition, 
suggesting a looser linkup instead. On Friday, he put out feelers to the 
Progressive Democrats, who have the six seats needed to give him an overall 
majority, saying he wanted a "policy-based arrangement" with them. But the 
Progressive Democrats, formed three years ago by Haughey dissidents, held out 
for a coalition.

A federal judge in Nashville has overturned a Tennessee law requiring girls age 
17 or under to get their parents' permission for an abortion. The national 
Planned Parenthood Federation and the American Civil Liberties Union of 
Tennessee sought a preliminary injunction against the law. But U.S. District 
Judge John T. Nixon said there was no need for an injunction because the 
statute is "unconstitutionally vague on its face." The law would have made it a 
misdemeanor for a doctor to perform an abortion on a minor without first 
obtaining written permission from her parents or guardian. It allows exceptions 
if the parents are divorced, if the girl wins a court waiver or if one parent 
cannot be found "within a reasonable time and manner." Nixon said that phrase 
did not give the doctor "notice as to when his actions will violate the 
statute."

A National Security Council task force plans to recommend that President Bush 
greatly heighten the military's role in fighting the drug trade by sending 
military advisers and increasing economic aid to cocaine-producing South 
American countries, the New York Times reported in its Sunday editions. Task 
force officials insisted that the effort would not be a back door for pursuing 
traffickers with military force. "What we are talking about is helping those 
countries who want to deploy their military resources to help fight narcotics 
and help them control insurgencies that are involved in trafficking," one 
official said. The number of troops had not been decided.

POLICE SWEEPS SEEK TO DEFUSE VIOLENCE OVER HOLIDAY BREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A task force of 300 police officers has been deployed in Los Angeles' most 
troubled neighborhoods in an effort to curb gang violence and reckless gunplay 
expected over the summer's first holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to set a tone and pattern for this summer, and especially for the long 
holiday weekend," LAPD Cmdr. William Booth said. "We want to reestablish in the 
minds of the community that their neighborhoods are not going to be given over 
to the violent people." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday and Saturday nights, the first of several sweeps to be conducted 
through July 4 resulted in hundreds of arrests at known gang hangouts 
throughout the LAPD's South Bureau, stretching from Watts to San Pedro, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stabbings at Coliseum Concert 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, about 150 members of the task force were suddenly dispatched to 
the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in response to reports of three stabbings 
during a rap music concert. The officers supervised clearance of the Coliseum 
after the concert ended and made several arrests in connection with the 
stabbings. One of the victims was in extremely critical condition, officers 
said. Police also received reports of several incidents of gunshots fired on 
streets adjacent to the Coliseum. One man was reported wounded. 
</P>
<P>
The task force made 47 arrests in the first two hours of Saturday night's 
sweep. Officials said they expected to be busier than Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The task force arrested 235 people -- 136 of them reputed gang members -- on 
suspicion of crimes ranging from selling narcotics to driving under the 
influence of alcohol Friday night and early Saturday morning, Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
In what Booth called the largest anti-gang dragnet of the year, police officers 
also conducted 469 field interviews, and issued warnings against lighting 
illegal fireworks or shooting guns into the air. 
</P>
<P>
"Indiscriminate shooting on the Fourth of July and New Year's Day has become a 
major problem over the past several years," Booth said. "People don't seem to 
realize that when you shoot a bullet into the air it comes down in a way that 
can be fatal." 
</P>
<P>
Massive anti-gang task forces -- nicknamed "the hammer" by department officials 
-- have been routinely deployed since early 1988, on occasion involving as many 
as 1,000 officers. They resulted in the arrest of about 25,000 people last 
year, about half of them gang members. 
</P>
<P>
Roll call for the first sweep of the weekend took place at 4 p.m. Friday in the 
parking lot of the Southeast Division Station. From there, officers patrolled 
known 
</P>
<P>
gang hangouts in the Southeast, Southwest, Harbor and 77th Street divisions 
until 1:30 a.m., Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the boundary of the crackdown, deadly gang violence erupted in the Echo 
Park area shortly after midnight Friday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Eduardo Diaz, 23, of Los Angeles, was standing on the corner of Douglas and 
Colton streets at 12:30 a.m. when he was struck in the upper torso by four to 
five shotgun rounds fired by a passenger in a passing vehicle, said Sgt. 
Richard Fox of the Rampart Division. Diaz, a suspected gang member, was 
pronounced dead at the Hospital of the Good Samaritan, Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect fired a sixth round at Eduardo Hernandez, 32, of Los Angeles, who 
was sitting in a car parked nearby, Fox said. Hernandez, who suffered minor 
wounds on the face and upper body, was in fair condition at County-USC Medical 
Center, Fox said.

RESTAURANT REVIEW: THEY KNOW THEIR DUCK AT ECCENTRIC LES PYRENEES 
</P>

"What's French food?" asked the young woman intently. 
</P>
<P>
 What's French food! How could I tell her? 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty or even 15 years ago, French food might have been a battery of 
techniques and a repertoire of classic dishes. But it was far more: a unique 
window on food as an art form, almost a privileged state of being. Americans 
went starry-eyed over French wine and passed around actual French cheese like a 
sacrament. For restaurants, being French was something to aspire to. 
</P>
<P>
Then we heard rumblings of what was being called nouvelle cuisine, and it 
turned out a lot of hot young chefs in France were actually tired of the 
classic dishes. They wanted to enrich the French tradition with Italian and 
Japanese elements. Once we got over the shock of thinking French tradition 
could be enriched, the idea made perfect sense -- we are, after all, a land of 
immigrants. Furthermore, in California, we had a lot more cuisines at our 
doorstep than just Italian and Japanese, so we started inventing dishes like 
mad, though still mostly using French techniques. 
</P>
<P>
And after a while, French restaurants as such seemed to fade from sight. I 
couldn't even think of the last French restaurant I'd been in, and now I was at 
Les Pyrenees, which is precisely what we thought of as a French restaurant in 
Los Angeles not so long ago. It's a light, dainty room with lots of mirrors, 
presided over by a maitre d' who tickles every table of diners in turn with 
Gallic wit and charm. He'd be at our table any minute, and I had to explain 
French food to the intent young woman and her friends pretty fast. 
</P>
<P>
"Well," I began, "French food is what they eat in France. Let's see: snails, 
frog's legs. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Eeoo." 
</P>
<P>
"How about if I just order for us?" 
</P>
<P>
Onion soup was no problem; she knew onion soup, though she'd have preferred 
more cheese on it. In fact, it was excellent, and I was glad it wasn't a 
floating cheese pizza. The soup of the day was a simple, old-fashioned lentil 
with wine, carrots, onions and bits of ham, also very good, neither too thick 
nor too soupy. 
</P>
<P>
The appetizers tend to be extremely old-fashioned, in fact. I'd already tried 
the mushroom caps -- plain mushrooms, nothing Japanese -- stuffed with crab, 
bread crumbs, garlic and parsley in lots of butter. The salmon mousseline was a 
big hit with the intent young woman's neighbor, though I found the light 
texture of the salmon fluffs a little floury, and the hay-sweet lobster sauce 
the best part of the dish. 
</P>
<P>
The liver pate she found ultra-familiar, and the escargots she tried with an 
unconvincing air of martyrdom. There was no doubt, though, about the best of 
the appetizers: a special that the charmingly Gallic maitre d' had pushed, of 
particularly sweet and tender mussels in cream sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The entrees are the very ones I used to see all the time on California French 
menus. New York steak with a simple -- perhaps a little too simple -- red wine 
sauce. Boneless double chicken breast with an excellent Madeira sauce, mostly 
meat glaze without an overbearing presence of the wine. Tender chunks of 
venison in wine sauce with green peppercorns (well, maybe not that 
old-fashioned: a dish of the late '70s maybe). At lunch I'd had a thin-sliced 
pork loin in a thin cream sauce full of whole-seed mustard. 
</P>
<P>
Les Pyrenees does have two eccentricities: a habit of serving two silver 
dollar-sized pancakes with every entree, and a monomania for duck. You can get 
duck with the classic orange or cherry sauces (a bit on the sweet side, as 
California French restaurants learned 
</P>
<P>
Americans like it), and also with raspberry (also sweet, but not at all crazy), 
honey (rather sweet and medieval-tasting), blueberry (too sweet) and green 
peppercorn (not sweet at all). They know their duck here; the skin is 
adequately crisp and the meat not dry. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody was puzzled by the soft raspberry cheesecake, the mocha genoise cake 
with coffee butter-cream filling and dark chocolate on top, or the brownie-like 
flourless chocolate cake. The marzipan tart was a lot better than it sounds, 
the marzipan less dry than you might fear and neatly counterpointed with bits 
of apricot. The best of the desserts was a lemon meringue tart with an 
elegantly thin filling and handsomely shaped curls of meringue on top. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the meal, my young guests studied everything as an exoticism, but at 
the end they seemed to conclude that French food wasn't that exotic after all. 
In effect, they'd had bits and pieces of this meal as California cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, but not all in the same place, right? And without the Gallic wit and charm, 
right? That's the difference; that's what French food is. These days, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended dishes: onion soup, $5.50; duck with raspberry sauce, $16.75; lemon 
meringue tart, $5. 
</P>
<P>
 Les Pyrenees, 2455 Santa Monica Blvd., Santa Monica. (213) 828-7503. Open for 
lunch 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. Tuesday through Friday, dinner 5:30 to 10 p.m. 
Tuesday through Sunday. Full bar. Street parking. American Express, MasterCard

JARUZELSKI WON'T SEEK NEW POST OF POLAND'S PRESIDENT

<TEXT>
<P>
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski said Friday he does not intend to run for Poland's new 
presidency because the people see him as the man who imposed martial law, not 
the leader of reforms that followed, the government reported. 
</P>
<P>
It said Jaruzelski, the Communist Party chief, recommended the interior 
minister, Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, for the job -- a powerful post resembling the 
presidency created in the Soviet Union for Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
The party's Central Committee neither accepted nor rejected Jaruzelski's 
proposal. Instead, the plenum asked Jaruzelski to reconsider his decision, the 
state PAP news agency reported. Party representatives in the Sejm, or 
Parliament, did likewise. 
</P>
<P>
Party spokesman Jan Bisztyga said there would be a meeting soon to choose 
between Jaruzelski and Kiszczak. The Communist-allied Peasant and Democratic 
parties also would be consulted, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"I know well that public opinion associates me more often with martial law and 
less often with the line of reforms, with those so significant decisions of the 
10th plenum," when the party agreed in principle to restore legal status to 
Solidarity, Jaruzelski told the Central Committee. "I must take into 
consideration social reality." 
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by state TV and the news agency, Jaruzelski said in 
endorsing Kiszczak: 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to ask you to extend the recommendation of the Central Committee 
for the soldier, politician, patriot and a man who has been close to me for 
many years, Comrade Czeslaw Kiszczak. 
</P>
<P>
"In the eyes of the society, including also opposition circles, he is rightly 
considered as a leading representative of . . . reconciliation." 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski said he was committed to removing obstacles to national 
reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
"When there is an obstacle to reconciliation, to uniting social forces, there 
is only one possible solution -- even if that obstacle is Wojciech Jaruzelski," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-Jaruzelski demonstrators marched in the streets of Warsaw while the 
Central Committee met, hurling stones and gasoline bombs at police, who 
responded with water cannon. 
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee convened Friday morning to choose a nominee for the 
presidency, which has been transformed from a ceremonial post. The president is 
to be elected by the National Assembly this week and the party nominee is 
considered certain of victory, although Solidarity won all but one of the seats 
put up for free election earlier in June. 
</P>
<P>
Officials want the president in office before President Bush arrives for a 
three-day visit July 9. 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski's election had been assumed since the new presidency was agreed upon 
by government and opposition negotiators. The agreements, signed in April, also 
legalized Solidarity and provided for the partially free elections. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Associated Press on Wednesday, however, Jaruzelski 
said he was not campaigning for the presidency and might not accept it without 
"at least a minimum of support" from the opposition. Solidarity legislators had 
said they would not vote for Jaruzelski. 
</P>
<P>
Kiszczak could be easier for Solidarity legislators to support because of 
Jaruzelski's connection with the martial law crackdown in December, 1981, under 
which Solidarity, formed during strikes the year before, was suppressed and 
outlawed. 
</P>
<P>
The 63-year-old army general, a Jaruzelski loyalist, directs Poland's extensive 
police network and helped conduct the government's war against Solidarity in 
much of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
He won the Solidarity leadership's confidence, however, as leader of the 
government side in the "round table" negotiations. In addition, he joined 
Jaruzelski during the January party meeting in threatening to resign unless 
Solidarity was made legal again. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly, which will elect the president in joint session, is 
expected to convene as early as Tuesday. The Communists have a 300-259 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity won 99 of the 100 seats in the new Senate and all 161 seats open to 
free election in the 460-member Sejm. One Solidarity senator-elect died of a 
heart attack Thursday, creating one vacancy in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
After the president is chosen, he is to name a premier to form a new 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The president, who is limited to two six-year terms, will be commander-in-chief 
of the armed forces and be responsible for foreign relations. He may dissolve 
the Sejm for new elections and declare one 90-day state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Solidarity is not expected to put up its own candidate.

Walking barefoot along a narrow steel beam 65 feet above the ground at the U.S. 
Navy's radio transmitting facility here, antenna mechanic John Schorpp swayed 
perilously in a sudden breeze, twisting with outstretched arms to keep his 
balance, a camera swinging crazily from his neck. 
</P>
<P>
Ahead, straddling girders inside the huge antenna, lay a conspicuous mound of 
twigs and branches, a nest fashioned by ospreys high above the Chesapeake Bay. 
The mother hawk circled the tower, shrieking alarm, as Schorpp inched forward 
and peered into the nest. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh my God!" Schorpp yelled. "This egg in here is hatching. The chick's coming 
out right now!" 
</P>
<P>
Schorpp found two hatchlings in addition to the one emerging in the nest. It 
was another milestone for the transmitting facility's growing population of the 
fish-hunting ospreys. 
</P>
<P>
Before his arrival here six years ago, Schorpp would have found little to crow 
about in the forest of radio towers that loom over the capital. Ospreys and the 
Navy weren't exactly on speaking terms then. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Navy Destroyed Nests 
</P>
<P>
Unimpressed by the ospreys' choice of nesting sites, Navy officials did their 
best to keep birds away. Often, nests were destroyed before eggs could be laid. 
</P>
<P>
Schorpp, a nature lover who walks the razor's edge, changed that. With 12 nests 
thriving in the transmitting facility, he has emerged as one of the 
Chesapeake's preeminent osprey landlords, helping the birds on a remarkable 
comeback from a time two decades ago, when DDT and other pesticides threatened 
the birds with extinction. 
</P>
<P>
Ospreys now seem to be multiplying like rabbits around the bay, partly because 
a growing number of amateur ornithologists have taken up the birds' cause. 
</P>
<P>
These large hawks have become an object of intense fascination for boaters, who 
marvel at the birds' ability to snare fish by diving into the water feet-first. 
</P>
<P>
Osprey couples have set up housekeeping on hundreds of navigational buoys and 
channel markers and seem to have an unusual tolerance for boat traffic in the 
bay's marinas. 
</P>
<P>
Nesting platforms are springing up behind docks and weekend houses along miles 
of the shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
"Ospreys essentially have saturated the area," said Glenn Therres of the 
Maryland Forest, Park and Wildlife Service. "The population is at an all-time 
high." 
</P>
<P>
The comeback is all the more remarkable in light of the pollution, overfishing 
and traffic congestion in the bay. Some researchers say the hawks are merely 
riding a run of good luck against losing odds, after having been pushed out of 
their old nesting grounds by waterfront development. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's miraculous that some of these animals have been able to hang on 
as well as they have," said biologist Jan Reese, who spent 20 years studying 
ospreys out of St. Michael's, Md., on the bay's Eastern Shore. "The osprey is 
obviously one adaptable bird. Somehow, it's managed to hang on this long." 
</P>
<P>
Therres said the osprey population around the bay has come back from a low of 
perhaps 800 pairs in the late 1960s to about 1,500 today. Measuring the change 
is tricky, Reese said, because no accurate count of the birds was made before 
it was discovered that DDT was causing serious reproductive problems. 
</P>
<P>
Reese plunged into the osprey investigation after researchers in Britain in the 
1950s uncovered evidence that DDT was causing peregrine falcons to lay abnormal 
eggs. 
</P>
<P>
Using the scant osprey records here for comparisons, Reese concluded that 
pesticides were having the same effect on ospreys. By the early 1970s, he said, 
osprey reproduction had fallen from an average of two or more eggs to a nest to 
one egg -- or none. 
</P>
<P>
A ban on DDT and restrictions on use of other pesticides have brought 
substantial improvement. Ospreys now commonly lay two, three or even four 
normal eggs. Other events have brought some good news, and some bad news. 
</P>
<P>
Building along the bay shore has meant the clearing of many acres of woodlands 
that may have provided nesting sites for 30% of the ospreys, Reese said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, though, a surge in recreational boating has prompted the 
Coast Guard to plant hundreds of additional channel markers and other 
navigational devices that house-hunting ospreys find ideal. 
</P>
<P>
Popular boating myth has it that the Coast Guard designed the buoys to 
accommodate ospreys, but in fact, the Coast Guard for years tried to discourage 
the birds because they sometimes short-circuit navigational lights and their 
bulky nests interfered with buoy maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Monstrous Nest' 
</P>
<P>
"They've found many ways to make the lights go out. And they can build a 
monstrous nest in one year," said Lt. George Walker of the Coast Guard's 
navigational-aids unit in Portsmouth, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Shooting the hawks or destroying their nests ran the Coast Guard afoul of 
environmentalists, and a cease-fire was necessary after the osprey was 
designated a protected species. 
</P>
<P>
Now the guard removes nests for maintenance only at the end of the breeding 
season. It sometimes builds alternative nesting platforms around sensitive 
navigational lights. 
</P>
<P>
"We all learn," Walker said. "Environmental protection is much more of a 
concern now than it was then." 
</P>
<P>
Those changing attitudes encourage biologist Paul Spitzer, who, under a state 
contract, has been tracking many of the ospreys Reese banded on the Eastern 
Shore. 
</P>
<P>
The birds winter in South America and typically return to the same nests here 
to raise new broods. 
</P>
<P>
Spitzer said construction of nesting platforms by local property owners has 
given the osprey a significant boost. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
States Share Chicks 
</P>
<P>
Breeding is so successful that Maryland has become an osprey exporter. Spare 
chicks are sent to areas of Pennsylvania and West Virginia to bolster 
populations there. 
</P>
<P>
"The bay could become a real garden for osprey," Spitzer said. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy transmitting facility, meanwhile, has been named a wildlife refuge 
under a cooperative agreement between the state and the Defense Department, and 
antenna mechanic Schorpp recently received a governor's award for his work. 
</P>
<P>
Back at the nest in the radio tower, Schorpp had less luck with his camera. It 
jammed just as the new chick was pulling itself from its shell. 
</P>
<P>
"Wouldn't you know it," said Schorpp, slapping the camera as he balanced on his 
slender perch, 65 feet up. "Just when you need it to work, it doesn't."

'GRUEL WITH A KICK': ANCIENT EGYPTIAN BREWERY IS UNTAPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM BOOTH, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a long day of slaving over the pottery kilns or digging tombs, the 
ancient Egyptians probably looked forward to knocking back a few jars of the 
local beverage. 
</P>
<P>
Some undoubtedly quaffed the product from what archeologists believe may be the 
oldest brewery in the world -- a recently unearthed four-vat operation capable 
of producing a dung-fired beer brewed from Nile water, half-baked bread, wheat 
malt and date juice. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm describing the beer as gruel with a kick," said Jeremy Geller, an 
archeologist in the anthropology department at Washington University in St. 
Louis. Geller is excavating the brewery in the ancient city of Hierakonpolis on 
the banks of the Nile about 450 miles south of Cairo. By examining pottery 
shards at the site and assessing a radiocarbon analysis of a mysterious black 
residue found in the vats, Geller estimates that the brewery was active about 
5,400 years ago, before the rise of the Pharaohs and construction of the 
pyramids. 
</P>
<P>
"If his dates hold up, it sounds like the oldest brewery in the world," said 
Solomon Katz, an anthropologist at the University of Pennsylvania, who believes 
a robust thirst for beer was one of the main reasons prehistoric 
hunter-gatherers banded together to create civilizations and develop 
agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Geller initially was interested in studying the pottery industry that 
flourished along the Nile about 3,400 years before the time of Jesus Christ. On 
the floor of the desert, in what was once the industrial sector of 
Hierakonpolis, Geller noticed chunks of burned clay pots and the broken lip of 
a large vessel. But the pottery kiln was unlike any Geller had ever 
encountered. 
</P>
<P>
Geller found four upright conical vats sitting on a raised platform. There was 
evidence that the vats were slowly heated with fires stoked with acacia and 
tamarisk wood and dung. Most intriguing was the presence of a glossy black 
residue that clung to the insides of the vats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Direction 
</P>
<P>
"It was certainly not the kiln I had been seeking. But if this was not a 
pottery kiln, what was it? Suddenly I realized that my doctoral research had, 
unexpectedly, taken a new direction," Geller said. 
</P>
<P>
An extract of the iridescent gunk was prepared and produced an odor that 
smelled like brandy. Closer examination by botanist Nabil el Hadidi of Cairo 
University revealed that the residue was the prehistoric dregs of a beer made 
with wheat and enriched with a sugary substance. 
</P>
<P>
"When we realized we had cereal and sugar in the same vat, we knew it had to be 
beer," said Michael Allen Hoffman, an archeologist at the University of South 
Carolina's Earth Sciences and Resources Institute and director of the 
Hierakonpolis Expedition, the organization that supports the work of Hoffman 
and Geller. 
</P>
<P>
The prehistoric Egyptians of Hierakonpolis probably brewed beer by adding 
broken-up pieces of half-baked bread to water, wheat and a syrup that might be 
date juice. The lightly baked loaves of bread contained the airborne yeast that 
drove the fermentation. The sugar also helped speed the process. Geller 
suggests that final product was frothy gruel that packed a wallop. 
</P>
<P>
"The Egyptians certainly weren't prudes. We're not talking about Nero and 
vulgar excess, but neither are we talking about a real sober people. There was 
clearly a place in ancient Egypt for dance, joy and a little indulgence in beer 
and, later, wine," Geller said. 
</P>
<P>
Beer was an important part of Egyptian life. It was drunk by laborers and 
nobles alike. Beer was also placed in tombs to provide the dead with something 
to sip while they pondered eternity. Funeral prayers invoked visions of a 
pleasant afterlife that included "bread and beer, beef and fowl, alabaster and 
linen, and all things good." Tomb walls dating back to the period of Pyramids 
of Giza show recipes for beer. 
</P>
<P>
When the brewery was active, Hierakonpolis was a city of several thousand 
inhabitants. A center of power in the upper Nile, Hierakonpolis supported a 
large pottery industry, herds of sheep and goats and a burgeoning funeral 
business.

INDIAN MATCHMAKERS MEETING THEIR MATCH IN NEWSPAPER CLASSIFIEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Newspaper advertisements and computers are replacing traditional matchmakers 
among the literate classes in India, where brides and grooms rarely choose 
their own spouses. 
</P>
<P>
Every Sunday the newspapers are filled with classified ads inviting inquiries 
about "smart, well-educated, professional boys" and "really beautiful, homely, 
university graduate girls." 
</P>
<P>
"Homely," in Indian matrimonial ad English, means someone who would make a good 
wife, mother and housekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
It did not seem odd to Saswati, a 28-year-old executive in a multinational 
firm, that her parents inserted a classified ad to find her a husband. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Wider Choice' 
</P>
<P>
"They asked if I had someone in mind I wanted to marry," Saswati said, 
insisting that her last name not be used. "When I said no, they proposed an 
advertisement in the newspaper. Frankly, I had no objections. It gave me a 
wider choice." 
</P>
<P>
"There was a special caste of matchmakers in earlier times, called 'ghataks,' " 
said Arati Srimal, a social scientist. "They were welcomed, respected and given 
pride of place wherever they visited, because every household had someone 
eligible for matrimony." 
</P>
<P>
Annu Kurien, a sociologist who found her husband through the matrimonial 
columns, said: "The image of the matchmaker is so deeply ingrained in the minds 
of even modern urban Indian youth that when newspapers replaced the 'ghatak' as 
matchmaker, they assumed a popularity the 'ghatak' could not aspire for." 
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon is not confined to Indians in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Sanjit, a 34-year-old engineer who recently visited New Delhi, has lived in the 
United States since he was 12. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Alliance Invited' 
</P>
<P>
His family received 103 responses when they inserted this ad in The Times of 
India: "Alliance invited for smart, Bengali Hindu engineer, 34, 185 cms (6 
feet), settled in the United States, music addict, no encumbrances." 
</P>
<P>
Sanjit's family narrowed the list to seven and started negotiations, writing or 
calling families of the women. 
</P>
<P>
Sanjit, who also didn't want his last name used, said he hopes his family will 
find the right woman so he can get married when he returns to India in six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents of Indians abroad seek Indian spouses for their children in a bid to 
retain traditional values and roots," said O. P. Sharma, chief of 
advertisements at the Hindustan Times, a conservative English-language 
newspaper famous for carrying the most matrimonial columns. 
</P>
<P>
"The Hindustan Times was the first newspaper in north India to begin carrying 
matrimonials in the early 1970s," Sharma said. "We now run over 4,500 such 
advertisements a month, and the number is increasing. Very few advertisements 
are repeated, an indication that the success rate is high." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
48% of Revenue 
</P>
<P>
The Hindustan Times charges 6 rupees (37 cents) a word for matrimonials and 
gets 48% of its classified advertising revenue from them, Sharma said. 
</P>
<P>
"Monthly, this means an income of approximately 1.2 million rupees ($80,000)," 
Sharma said. 
</P>
<P>
The Hindustan Times also runs a computerized matchmaking service called "Life 
Partners," which is offered free to advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
Names rarely appear in the ads, and most advertisers receive their answers in 
special mailboxes at the newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
An advertising executive at The Times of India, which runs about 2,000 
matrimonials a month, said the number of responses varies from one to hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
"Non-resident Indians and green card (U.S. work permit) holders attract a 
greater number of people," said Narayani Mantoo. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
95% From Cities 
</P>
<P>
"The phenomenon of matrimonial advertisements is predominantly urban," she 
added. "More than 95% of our clients come from cities." 
</P>
<P>
Cities have the highest concentrations of newspaper readers in a country where 
about 43% of the 880 million people are literate. Most of the ads are placed by 
Hindus, who account for 80% of the population, but Sikhs, Christians and 
Muslims use them as well. 
</P>
<P>
A social scientist interpreted the phenomenon of matrimonial advertisements as 
a sign that urban Indian society was in transition but unable to cast off 
deeply ingrained cultural customs. 
</P>
<P>
"The disintegration in the traditional joint family framework brought around, 
perforce, a more impersonal, unitary concept of family," said Manisha Bahl at 
the Center for Women's Development Studies. 
</P>
<P>
"Personal contacts have been replaced by the impersonal advertisement in a 
newspaper or agency to bring about the desired union," she said.

BANIYAS, Israeli-Annexed Golan Heights 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. and Israeli archeologists have unearthed a Roman metropolis that in its 
heyday was the ancient world's equivalent of New York. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in about AD 10 by Herod Philip, son of King Herod the Great, ancient 
Baniyas grew over the next several hundred years "into a huge city," 
archeologist Vassilios Tzarferis of the Israel Antiquities Department said 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
"We can estimate the population in Roman times of up to 15,000 people, which 
for those days means it was a New York," Tzarferis said. 
</P>
<P>
Traces of ruined villas can be found a mile from the city center, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Herod Philip chose the site near the source waters of the Jordan River and next 
to a cave where pagans worshiped Pan, the goat-like god of the shepherds. The 
cave is part of a national park that today is a favorite site for picnics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Named for Emperor 
</P>
<P>
He named his city in honor of Emperor Augustus Caesar, but it became known as 
Caesarea Philipi to distinguish it from the port of Caesarea constructed by his 
father on the Mediterranean Sea. 
</P>
<P>
American teams working at the site this year have partially uncovered a dozen 
30-foot-high arches that formed one side of what appears to be a long shopping 
mall, said John Wilson, an archeology professor from Pepperdine College in 
Malibu, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
The arches now are the bottom layer of a wedding cake of history. Wilson said 
Crusader conquerors 1,000 years later built a citadel on top. In the 13th or 
14th Century Mameluke raiders from Egypt added a palace. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Syrian Village on Top 
</P>
<P>
"On top of it all was a Syrian village," Wilson said. Baniyas was part of Syria 
until the Golan Heights region was taken by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war 
and annexed in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Diggers have uncovered a public gate dating to the 1st Century and a 2nd- or 
3rd-Century house with mosaic floors, one of which is largely intact. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said "we are encouraged there may be considerable sections of ancient 
Baniyas that are preserved." But he estimated that it would take up to 10 years 
with as many as 100 people working each digging season to expose a substantial 
part of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Historians and archeologists had many clues to the city's location, Wilson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Depicted on Coins 
</P>
<P>
"The Pan cave with niches and inscriptions appears exactly on coins of the 2nd 
and early 3rd Century that say they are from Baniyas," Wilson said. "There are 
other coins with pictures of buildings, which we feel are as accurate, and 
that's what we're looking for." 
</P>
<P>
The area is referred to as "Paneon" by the Jewish historian Josephus, who says 
Herod the Great built a white stone temple to Roman Emperor Augustus there. 
</P>
<P>
For years, it was strategically important because it controlled the road from 
Damascus to the sea, Wilson said. It lost its importance after Ottoman Turks 
took control, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Pepperdine, the other American colleges that sent students to 
work at Baniyas this year were Averett College of Danville, Va., and 
Hardin-Simmons University and Abilene Christian College, both of Abilene, Tex.

ARMY DOCTORS FIGHT OWN THAI BATTLE

<TEXT>
<P>
A dentist dressed in military fatigues bends over his patient in a tin-roofed 
shed. His arms jerk from side to side, and a crushed tooth rolls off the 
patient's lower lip. 
</P>
<P>
It is another victory for the U.S. Army. 
</P>
<P>
While about 3,000 U.S. and Thai soldiers a few miles away are battling the 
"enemy" with guns and rockets in an annual military exercise called Cobra Gold, 
U.S. military doctors and dentists are battling the age-old enemies of injury 
and disease with vitamins, medicine and chrome-plated dental pliers. 
</P>
<P>
"We've seen the entire gamut from mundane illnesses to life-threatening 
diseases," said Col. Lionel Nelson, the supervisor of the Medical Civic Action 
Project at Ban Nong Sua, about 250 miles northwest of Bangkok. 
</P>
<P>
A Thai medic with a bullhorn keeps the lines of villagers moving through the 
improvised clinic held in a 90-foot, open-sided shed covered with corrugated 
tin. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of villagers, dressed in the loose pants and sarongs of the countryside, 
point out their aches to Americans who have picked up a smattering of the 
difficult Thai language. 
</P>
<P>
Staff Sgt. Robert Bean of Los Angeles passes out everything from thyroid 
medicine to vitamins. 
</P>
<P>
On an average day, dentists pull 120 teeth. In a month of work, U.S. and Thai 
military personnel have treated more than 12,000 patients. 
</P>
<P>
During Cobra Gold, U.S. military teams also focused on preventing illness by 
building six water tanks and drilling three wells to provide safer water 
supplies in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, on his third tour in Thailand as a reserve officer in the U.S. Army, 
speaks well of Thai medical care in the rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just that there is not enough," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the criticisms of this type of operation is that you tend to give . . . 
temporary care," Nelson said. As a solution, Nelson's 20-person Thai-U.S. team 
is focusing on teaching dental hygiene. 
</P>
<P>
"Education is the most important thing we can leave behind," said Nelson, who 
lives in Los Altos, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
While Thailand's economic growth has brought Western medical methods, it has 
also brought Western medical problems. 
</P>
<P>
"This year we are concentrating on pesticide poisoning. It's a big problem over 
here," Nelson said. Liver damage, skin rashes and blood disorders brought on by 
inhalation of toxic chemicals have all become more common. 
</P>
<P>
Practicing in Ban Nong Sua's no-frills medical barn gives Nelson an opportunity 
to learn first-hand about many illnesses Western doctors only read about. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of parasitic infection, malaria, dengue fever, worm diseases 
and skin rashes that you just don't see in the United States," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's basically what it was all about when you went to medical school. There 
are no frills. There is no monetary reward here. It's strictly the joy of 
helping people who are really in need of being helped."

VENDING MACHINE OPERATORS FEEL BITE;

CANADIAN COINS TAKE A PLUG OUT OF MAINE'S PROFITS

Canadian tourists who keep cash registers jingling in this resort town also 
have vending machine operators singing the blues as lower-valued coins pile up. 
</P>
<P>
"Starting shortly, through the end of the season, probably 8% or 9% of the 
coins are Canadian," said Paul Dunn, vice president and operations manager at 
Donovan &amp; Donovan Inc., a vending company in nearby Saco. 
</P>
<P>
The nickels, dimes and quarters are the same size as their U.S. counterparts, 
and at current exchange rates -- $1.19 Canadian per $1 U.S. -- they can take a 
slow, steady bite out of profits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expensive Process 
</P>
<P>
"We have a pretty hefty discount when it goes to the bank," Dunn said. "Coins 
we get discounted 50%. The way it's explained to us is it's an expensive 
process, handling them and shipping them back." 
</P>
<P>
Dunn said his company plans to install electronic devices to make machines 
refuse the Canadian coins, but that can create new problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, that makes irate customers," Dunn said. "A few years ago, it (the 
exchange rate) was 3%, and we put in coin acceptors." 
</P>
<P>
In northern Maine, Hedrich Vending Inc. of Presque Isle winds up with so many 
Canadian coins that trying to keep them away would not be worth the effort, 
said Joe Hedrich Jr. Fixing the machines to reject the Canadian coins would 
lead to too many jammed machines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Eat the Discount' 
</P>
<P>
"We'd have service calls galore," Hedrich said. "We eat the discount." 
</P>
<P>
Up north, the discount is not as bad, with banks subtracting the actual 
exchange rate of about 20% in recent days, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But in southern Maine, banks are not fond of handling Canadian coins. 
</P>
<P>
"For a customer of Maine National Bank, we will discount it 50%, but for a 
non-customer, we will not do it at all," said Jim Parisi, head teller at Maine 
National in downtown Portland. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taken at Face Value 
</P>
<P>
In Old Orchard Beach, a seaside town 20 miles south of Portland, the tourism 
economy gets such a lift from Canadians that officials have decided to take the 
foreign coins at face value when they turn up in municipal parking lots and pay 
toilets. 
</P>
<P>
"As a courtesy we don't discount them," Town Manager Jerry Plante said. "What 
limited number we get we process through the bank, and we get discounted 40%." 
</P>
<P>
Vending companies that need to sift the Canadian change out of the U.S. coins 
have found that they can do so by running all the coins under special magnets, 
which fish the Canadian coins out, Hedrich said. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian coins also wind up in parking meters. Some Maine residents have 
found the meters to be a good place to get rid of Canadian coins that turn up 
in their pocket change. 
</P>
<P>
In Portland, parking meter supervisor Robert Henderson said the problem may be 
aggravated by businesses that buy the cheap coins and hand them out to let 
customers plug meters with them. Henderson said he cannot prove that the coins 
are being systematically used and he would not identify any suspect businesses, 
but he has received reports of the practice for several years.

RECYCLING CENTER ALL TRASHED OUT

<P>
So many people are obeying a new recycling law that newspapers were piled to 
the ceiling and trucks had to wait in line to drop trash at the local recycling 
center. The city finally closed the center. 
</P>
<P>
The National Temple Recycling Center, the main one in the city, was inundated 
with newspapers, cans and plastics after the city expanded its mandatory 
curbside pickup program, which began this spring, from 49,000 households to 
97,000 in northwestern Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
The response amazed recycling officials, who thought it would take much longer 
to educate people about the ordinance requiring them to sort recyclables and 
leave them at the curb. 
</P>
<P>
"Previous experiences led us to expect about 30% participation," said Tom Klein 
of the Philadelphia Recycling Office. Instead, unofficial surveys place it at 
close to 90% in the new recycling zone. 
</P>
<P>
"We're planners and we try to do a good job of anticipation," he said. "We just 
weren't ready for that response." 
</P>
<P>
Neither was the recycling center. Almost within days, the 'Previous experiences 
led us to expect about 30% participation (instead of the 90% who joined the 
effort). We're planners and we try to do a good job of anticipation. We just 
weren't ready for that response.' 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
amount of recycled materials received at the plant jumped from 12 tons a day to 
35 tons. 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers reached the ceiling. Bottles and cans gathered in mounds. A 
fenced-in area outside the plant, once a parking lot, became a storage area. 
Lines of recycling trucks waited to drop their cargo. 
</P>
<P>
On June 16, the city's Department of Licenses and Inspections closed the plant 
because of dangerous, unhealthy conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Since then the backlog has eased, except for newspapers. They are a special 
problem, because there is a newspaper glut on the recycling market, said Mjenzi 
Traylor, head of the plant. "It's costing us $15 to $17 to bail a ton," he 
said. "And for the most part, we're getting $5 or less per ton." 
</P>
<P>
A recycling center in nearby Bucks County has volunteered to take some of the 
excess, but Traylor said that is only a temporary solution. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a fortunate position because we have a number of major users of 
recycled paper here in the community," said Klein. 
</P>
<P>
Klein said the problems will not affect plans to expand the mandatory recycling 
program into the northeastern part of the city July 24. 
</P>
<P>
He said the city has contracted with a separate recycling company, Waste 
Management, to handle the additional 45,000 households.

FIERCELY INDEPENDENT ICELAND PLAYS RELUCTANT HOST TO AMERICAN FORCES

REYKJAVIK, Iceland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When word reached Iceland that the U.S. military planned large-scale maneuvers 
beginning June 17, the underlying strains of anti-Americanism surfaced on this 
fiercely independent island nation. 
</P>
<P>
June 17 is Iceland's national day, and the U.S. forces had to delay the start 
of their exercises by three days because of an angry 11th-hour debate in the 
Icelandic Parliament and a warning from Prime Minister Steingrimur Hermannsson 
that the timing of the maneuvers was unwise. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson also scaled down the maneuvers from 
1,300 to 1,000 reservists to allay a parliamentary outcry over a U.S. officer's 
erroneous description of the exercises as the largest in Iceland since World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
In this strategically important North Atlantic country, proud of its 
independence, reliance on the American military for defense draws gratitude 
from some and rancor from others. 
</P>
<P>
Iceland is the only member of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
with no army or navy. Under the NATO treaty, the Iceland Defense Force is 
all-American. 
</P>
<P>
With 250,000 inhabitants, Kentucky-sized Iceland has no interest in raising its 
own army, and the suggestion often sparks astonishment and laughter. 
</P>
<P>
"We are this unique nation that tries to maintain its independence without any 
military force," Hannibalsson said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
When Iceland won independence from Denmark in 1944, most people saw little 
point in establishing an army, he explained. "Who was it going to deter?" 
</P>
<P>
In World War II, the British beat the Germans to Iceland and turned over its 
defense to the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Andrew Duncan of the International Institute of Strategic Studies in 
London said Iceland was "a rather large aircraft carrier," halfway between 
Europe and North America. It is also on Soviet submarine routes into the North 
Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
The American presence is no longer the issue it was in the 1970s, but it is 
still viewed with ambivalence. 
</P>
<P>
At the government's request, enlisted service personnel in the 3,300-strong 
American force have a midnight-to-6 a.m. curfew. Armed Forces Television is 
also barred from broadcasting outside the NATO base at Keflavik, 31 miles south 
of Reykjavik, where the Americans live. 
</P>
<P>
Three of Iceland's four major parties have consistently backed the American 
presence, but a September, 1987, poll of 1,753 people by the University of 
Iceland found just 41% wanted the Americans to stay. Thirty three percent 
wanted them to leave and 26% said they didn't care. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, more than 80% consistently support Iceland's membership in NATO. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition to the U.S. military is led by a vocal left-wing minority. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been very unfriendly to them," said Gudrun Helgadottir, president of 
Iceland's Parliament, the Althing, and a member of the left-wing People's 
Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
The alliance, part of the three-party center-left coalition government, 
believes the U.S. presence makes Iceland a military target and endangers 
Iceland's culture and language, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Incidents like the timing of the military maneuvers by U.S. reservists from 
Westover Air Force Base in Massachusetts bring to light the Icelanders' 
sensitivities. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden, it was a matter of national honor not to have those exercises 
on national independence day, and all of a sudden, people discovered they were 
a disgrace because now we're living in a period of disarmament and peace," 
Hannibalsson said. 
</P>
<P>
He gave the go-ahead for the exercise, code-named Northern Viking '89, but 
changed the dates to June 20-28. He said it was far from the largest held here 
and was similar to maneuvers in 1985 and 1987, which he said nobody noticed. 
</P>
<P>
In May, Iceland officially protested a farewell speech by the outgoing U.S. 
commander, Rear Adm. Eric McVadon, in which he urged Icelanders who support the 
American forces to speak out. McVadon also implied that Icelandic authorities 
were ungrateful to U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S.-NATO request to build a second airport in northern Iceland has also 
aroused critics who fear a military buildup. 
</P>
<P>
Hannibalsson said he will decide in a few months whether to authorize a 
feasibility study. If Iceland says no, Greenland has expressed willingness to 
have the airport.

STUDENT PROTESTERS BURN CHINESE FLAGS AT ANTI-PARTY RALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
On the 68th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, Chinese 
students from several Southern California campuses burned China's national flag 
and the party's flag, canceled party memberships and called for harsher 
sanctions against their government at two rallies in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 people, most of them students, gathered in front of the Chinese 
Consulate to continue protesting the brutal massacre of Chinese students in 
Tian An Men Square last month. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the students joined about 1,500 people in front of the Federal Building 
in Westwood, calling on the U.S. government to impose harsher economic 
sanctions against China. 
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese Communist Party died today," proclaimed Walter Yuen, 39, a 
mechanical engineering professor, as he addressed the students from the steps 
of the consulate. "No political party which kills its people can maintain its 
legitimacy." 
</P>
<P>
Students hoisted placards and banners mounted on bamboo poles declaring, "The 
World Is Watching," "CCP = Crime, Cruelty, Plague," "Lies Written in Ink Cannot 
Cover Truth Written in Blood" and "Party of Murder." 
</P>
<P>
They also took turns stomping on the Chinese Communist Party flag and on copies 
of the Centre Daily News, a Monterey Park-based Chinese language newspaper that 
students claimed was taking an "anti-democracy" position on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Some students interrupted the addresses to torch the party flag. They also 
shredded and burned China's national flag, with additional students grabbing at 
the ends so they could claim they had participated. 
</P>
<P>
Hua Chuan, a biochemist at Montgomery Labs, also announced that at least seven 
Southern California students had joined 391 Chinese Communist Party members in 
the United States in quitting the party, which claims membership of more than 
40 million. 
</P>
<P>
"If I continue to be a member I will be a criminal, and I will be as guilty as 
the government and soldiers who massacred the innocent students," said Haitao 
Wang, 35, an editor of the Press Freedom Herald, a newspaper first published 
after the June 4 massacre. 
</P>
<P>
The students later joined the Westwood rally, where another replica of the 
Goddess of Democracy -- erected by students in Tian An Men Square -- was 
unveiled. The Goddess wore black arm bands and black ribbons also hung from her 
torch. 
</P>
<P>
Changqing Cao, editor in chief of the Press Freedom Herald, led speakers who 
called on President Bush to impose tougher economic sanctions on China. 
</P>
<P>
"Only the party officials in China benefit from trade . . . and the Chinese 
people are willing to play their part in bringing true democracy to China," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by a cordon of fluttering American flags, Los Angeles City 
Councilman Michael Woo announced a postcard campaign, asking people in the 
crowd to return postcards calling on Deng Xiaoping, chairman of the Communist 
Party Military Commission, to "end immediately the repression of all Chinese 
citizens who seek only to exercise their basic human rights." The postcards are 
addressed to China's Ambassador Han Xu in care of U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson 
(R-Calif.), who is co-sponsoring the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to show the Chinese government that the United States is speaking with 
one voice on this issue. Those who advise the President that the events in 
China are only a temporary aberration and (that) we must think in the long term 
are missing the point. . . . It is an apology we cannot accept because in the 
long term we will have to deal with the democracy movement," Woo said. 
</P>
<P>
A sprinkling of non-Chinese participants attended the rally. Among them were 
Israel Feuer, 58, who held aloft two placards proclaiming "Socialism Without 
Democracy Is Neither," and "Deng Li Peng, You Have Lost Heaven's Mandate," 
slogans chanted by the Chinese students before the massacre.

THE GREENING OF SAN DIEGO; 
</P>
<P>
A NEW ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT TAKES ROOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dawna Knotts, a credit reporter for a San Diego mortgage company, had taken a 
few small steps toward acting on her environmentalist ideals. The young, native 
San Diegan regularly recycled her leftover food into fertilizer for her 
back-yard garden, and quietly encouraged fellow workers to stop using Styrofoam 
cups for their coffee. 
</P>
<P>
But Knotts wanted to do more. So did Daniel Tarr, a 34-year-old glass artist in 
El Cajon, who had tried and failed to find a place for his ecological and 
political philosophies in Democratic and Republican circles. 
</P>
<P>
Then, about two years ago, the Green movement emerged in San Diego. And today, 
amid the Green of giddily ambitious college students, artists on the fringe, 
never-say-die '60s activists and white-collar professionals, Knotts and Tarr 
have found gentle strength for their convictions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Kind of a Loaner' 
</P>
<P>
"I always argued for environmental causes, but never made too big of a stand. I 
was always kind of a loner," said Knotts, 21. "The Greens opened my door." 
</P>
<P>
Knotts and Tarr, like at least 100 other San Diegans, have found their niche in 
Greenness. For them the local and the U.S. movement, born in 1984 of the strong 
Green Party influence in Europe and fueled by a growing public awareness of 
ecological issues, is not just another environmental sounding board. 
</P>
<P>
So far, it has been a chance to plant trees in East San Diego, publish 
brochures on local groceries' food quality and help develop a sewage-recycling 
plant in Tijuana (and push the concept as a comprehensive water plan for San 
Diego). 
</P>
<P>
Later, it could mean developing a Greens TV news show and collecting support 
for a 1990 state initiative that seeks to elect California politicians 
</P>
<P>
by proportional representation rather than the current winner-take-all system. 
</P>
<P>
And while it is not yet a registered political party in the United States, the 
Green movement already has begun to stir talk of a Green national agenda and 
potential Green influence on local and state elections. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a mistake to say the Greens are just an ecology party. That's only part 
of it," Tarr said. "We see ecological issues tied into other issues, like 
economics. We see everything as being interconnected." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interconnection of Problems 
</P>
<P>
The Green movement, San Diego Greens explain, examines the social, economic and 
political aspects of ecological problems, and how social problems like poverty 
relate to the environment. It is neither right nor left but forward, they say, 
adding that it espouses philosophy and practices reality. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what sets us apart," Tarr said, matter-of-factly. "We're different, and 
that's where Greens hold the key to future politics." 
</P>
<P>
Such definitions only vaguely answer the question, "Just who are the Greens?" 
But Knotts, Tarr and other San Diego Greens may be better at showing than 
telling. 
</P>
<P>
At a Greens meeting last Tuesday, 13 people (of a dues-paying membership of 
100), most young -- 20s to mid-30s -- and all Caucasian, gathered in a 
makeshift garage near San Diego State University to discuss the weekly agenda. 
Many took off their shoes, offered introductions and shared several moments of 
silence (reflection, not prayer), while a friendly tomcat wandered in and out 
of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
An open forum for thought and action is intrinsic to Green operations, members 
say. In fact, decisions are made by consensus. "If someone has a serious, 
fundamental philosophical problem with an issue, then he can actually block" a 
majority opinion, Tarr said. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Saint, a young free-lance writer, agreed to be the "facilitator" of the 
meeting. Two others volunteered to take notes and keep time. Although 
discussion was informal, Saint rigidly followed the agenda and the clock. 
Afterward, upon a suggestion by a member, all stood, linked arms and offered 
comments on the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Greens shun leadership, hierarchy and pigeonholing. Instead, members say, they 
rotate key positions and seek diversity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Ideological Purity' 
</P>
<P>
"There's no ideological purity to Green organization now, and that's one of the 
things about it that's appealing," said Jerry Russell, a 33-year-old engineer 
and newly elected member of the Rancho Bernardo planning board. His wife, 
Janet, a former lab technician with degrees in chemistry and physics, also is a 
Green. 
</P>
<P>
"If we all thought alike, that probably would mean there was somebody telling 
us what to think," Russell said. "And right now, there's nobody telling the 
Greens what to think." 
</P>
<P>
Greens are so disdainful of centralized power that a local committee will split 
when its membership exceeds several dozen. Just a few weeks ago, members of the 
original committee, the Greens of San Diego, splintered off to form the Ocean 
Beach Greens. Another subdivision may occur in the near future, when Russell 
and others try to form a North County Greens group. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean Beach Greens "sympathize with" the Greens of San Diego, but take no 
direction from them, said Pete Dustrud, a free-lance photographer and 
co-founder of the former. The new group, with about 12 members so far, has 
activities and ambitions of its own. 
</P>
<P>
Two members have opened the Green Store, an independent clearinghouse for 
information about the Greens and other political and environmental groups. 
Dustrud publishes "All Together Green," a local journal. Members have begun 
pushing for a recycling program in Ocean Beach, and participated in recent 
Greenpeace demonstrations at the harbor over whale and dolphin killing. And 
besides getting the word out about the Green movement and its issues, Ocean 
Beach members are helping to coordinate a demonstration against the Exxon 
Valdez when it docks here this month). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Future 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, members are considering sponsoring a candidate for local 
elections in the fall, Dustrud said. The idea is so new to the group that they 
haven't identified which offices they may run for. 
</P>
<P>
Individuals "will have to take the initiative, if they want to seek office," 
said Dustrud. "But we'd like to see a Green platform developed. We'd like to 
get some people involved." 
</P>
<P>
But while Ocean Beach Greens are considering running a candidate in immediate 
elections, San Diego Greens have dismissed the idea, arguing that with 
virtually no chance of winning, they would simply gain a reputation for losing. 
Instead, San Diego Greens are mulling over the idea of screening the candidates 
in upcoming fall elections and publicizing a list of those whom they support. 
</P>
<P>
That potential problem may be evidence of a larger dilemma: how to form a 
unified Green policy on major issues while maintaining independence and 
diversity among local committees. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic values are shared by all Greens," said Tarr, citing the four pillars 
of the Green movement: ecological wisdom, economic justice, nonviolence and 
grass-roots democracy. "But beyond that, there's a lot of room for different 
ideas. In our group, the debate ranges from what's the ideal solution to what 
is doable. We decide which position is most Green." 
</P>
<P>
Local Greens, aware that their membership is mostly white and middle-class, 
acknowledge that attracting diversity -- particularly ethnic minorities -- to 
its membership will be a priority. But they maintain that their economic, 
political and social issues, all with ecological roots, involve, and thus can 
appeal to, everyone. 
</P>
<P>
"There are things all of us have in common. All communities want to breathe 
clean air, eat good food and drink clean water," Tarr said. "There must be a 
lot of people who share these values who don't know where to convert their 
energies." 
</P>
<P>
Dustrud added: "Saving the Earth means we're going to need everybody. We need 
all these different groups and all these ideas to come together. 
</P>
<P>
"Because the whole world," he concluded, "needs the Greens."

Right now, what Ileen Bates needs most is bread. The other day it was spaghetti 
noodles. She can always use peanut butter, tuna and powdered milk. 
</P>
<P>
Bates' job is to help feed North San Diego County's poor, although it's a sure 
bet that none of the region's hungry has been to her office -- a small, 
nondescript warehouse in San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
Bates is a former executive secretary for a Rancho Bernardo electronics firm 
who decided, during a self-described mid-life crisis, to direct her energy 
toward a social cause so she could offer something to the world besides a 
perfectly typed memo. 
</P>
<P>
Today she is coordinator of the North County Food Co-Op, a community food 
pantry that solicits, collects, stores and distributes food to nine agencies 
from Oceanside to Escondido. The agencies provide a menu of services and 
programs to the hungry, the unemployed, the homeless and the battered. 
</P>
<P>
The Food Co-Op was formed in March, 1988, by three of the agencies -- Oceanside 
Community Action Corp., North County Interfaith Council and North County Centro 
-- which met daily with hundreds of people who were hungry but had no efficient 
way of collecting and distributing food to them. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone would call with a large food donation and none of the agencies had 
anywhere to store it, or one agency would need some food for an emergency 
situation and they wouldn't know where to turn," Bates said. "It was decided 
that a single food bank to serve all of the agencies in North County would be 
the best way to go." 
</P>
<P>
Bates estimated that since its inception 15 months ago, the co-op has collected 
and distributed more than 150,000 pounds of food. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the food comes from singularly large donations. The other day, a San 
Diego woman who happened upon 8,000 pounds of onions from a farmer near El 
Centro donated 1,000 pounds of her haul to the co-op. 
</P>
<P>
NeMo's, an Escondido wholesale bakery, sends entire pallets of baked goods -- 
carrot cake, blueberry muffins, croissants, cookies and the like -- to the 
co-op. The food does not meet cosmetic standards for retail sale but is 
nonetheless tasty and healthy. 
</P>
<P>
The Ryder truck rental company in Escondido offers the use of its vehicles to 
pick up and deliver contributions. 
</P>
<P>
The Lawrence Welk Vacation Resort recently donated hundreds of small bottles of 
shampoo and bars of soap -- the kind that are put in motel rooms -- to the 
co-op. Bates is looking for similar donations of razors, toothpaste, 
toothbrushes and other items she can put together as "street packs" for the 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Far and away, however, most contributions come from individual donors and food 
drives. A recent Girl Scout drive, for instance, generated 8,000 pounds of food 
for the co-op. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, unusable food is donated -- a fact that brings both a cringe and 
a laugh from Bates. 
</P>
<P>
"We sometimes get caviar, pate, pickled sardines -- things like that," she 
said. "You figure one of two things happened. Either the person received that 
as a gift and had no use for it, so decided to give it to us, or a youngster 
was asked to bring a donation to school and his mom or dad said grab something 
out of the pantry, and that's what he came in with." 
</P>
<P>
Such items are difficult to pass on to a hungry person who would just as soon 
eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, she said. "To give someone who's hungry 
a can of caviar is a bit like pouring salt in an open wound." 
</P>
<P>
Bates' favorite contribution is money. 
</P>
<P>
"There are things we need that people generally don't donate -- baby formula, 
disposable diapers, baby food, things like that," she said. "One time we had a 
request for roast beef from one of the agencies that has a residential home. 
The women there were getting tired of macaroni and cheese and said they would 
have died for a nice Sunday dinner. I went out and bought them one." 
</P>
<P>
With cash, Bates is able to shop around for the best possible bulk purchases of 
items that are needed all the time. The co-op has a kitty of about $4,500, the 
result of several small grants. Bates hopes to bring the account to $12,000 
with a constant source of revenue from a private foundation or funding source, 
so she can purchase $100 in hard-to-come-by food and supplies each month for 
each of the nine member agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The largest single expense for the agency is the rental of the San Marcos 
warehouse. The cities of Carlsbad, Oceanside and Escondido contribute $6,000 
each toward the rent. San Diego County contributed an additional $40,000 in 
seed money last year, and this year added $14,000 toward the program to help 
cover operating costs. Bates is the sole paid employee; others volunteer their 
time in soliciting and distributing the food. 
</P>
<P>
Member agencies say the Food Co-Op is the answer to their dreams, resolving 
what had been a logistical nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all into loaves and fishes -- feeding people who are hungry. We don't 
compete with one another but, until the Food Co-Op was established, we weren't 
able to really help one another," said Bob Klug, who coordinates North County 
Interfaith Council's food program. The council offers a soup kitchen and also 
provides emergency food to individuals in need. 
</P>
<P>
"Every once in a while, someone would offer one of the social agencies in North 
County 10 or 20 pallets of food -- and we'd have to turn it down because we 
simply had nowhere to store it," Klug said. "Now we can have it stored at the 
co-op, and even share it among the members who need it most." 
</P>
<P>
With Bates in the middle, the agencies also are able to share food among 
themselves. One agency, for instance, might receive perishable food that it 
cannot use before it spoils; the food is shared among the various agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather give, say, pistachios to another agency than to keep it for myself 
and have them rot before I can use them all," Klug said. 
</P>
<P>
He recalled the time when his agency was in need of onions, and put the word 
out to other agencies that work through the co-op. Sure enough, another agency 
had more onions than it could use, and sent them over to Klug. Everyone was 
happy. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of years ago, we were all throwing up our arms in frustration," Klug 
said. "Now we have the answer, and I don't know of anything like this in 
Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
Darlene Ulrich is the executive director of the Oceanside Community Action 
Corp., which is the fiscal agent for the co-op. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things we've learned from this is that it's easier to get donations 
from companies if they know they're serving nine agencies, not just one, with 
their donation," Ulrich said. "It's easier for companies to donate if they see 
us working together on the same problem, rather than overlapping one another 
and not being as efficient." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the three founding agencies, other members include Casa de 
Amparo, a shelter for children in Oceanside; the Ecumenical Service Center, 
which provides food, clothing and shelter in Oceanside; the Hidden Valley 
House, a shelter for women and children in Escondido; Lifeline Community 
Services, which provides crisis intervention, emergency housing and 
transportation out of Vista; St. Clare's Home, which operates three women's 
shelters in Escondido, and the Salvation Army Family Services, which provides 
food and clothing in Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the member agencies conducts its own food drives, which are warehoused 
in San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
Bates said she is aware of cynicism that food might be steadily provided to 
people who come to rely on it as their sole source and who don't then work to 
better their situations. 
</P>
<P>
"The beauty of this co-op is that each of the member agencies counsels its 
clientele to find out how they got into the problem they have, and how they can 
get out of it," Bates said. "These are the people who need some temporary help 
until they get back on their own feet. This is not a welfare giveaway program, 
and I don't think a person who is unwilling to help himself will get food from 
us more than twice before being identified." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Help for Other Agencies 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the co-op provides emergency supplies to eight other agencies in 
North County -- agencies that have no way of contributing to the food bank but 
have their own food needs. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Bates is trying to find a daily supply of bread for a youth camp 
in the Pauma Valley that will provide summer vacations for disadvantaged youths 
from Los Angeles. Since bread spoils so quickly in the summer, she is hoping 
for a daily contributor to help feed 80 teen-agers daily through the end of 
August. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to food and cash donations, there are a few big-ticket items Bates 
would love to receive: a computer, to better record donations, current 
inventory and help with fund-raising efforts, and an institution-size 
refrigerator or freezer for perishables. 
</P>
<P>
"What we could really use is a service club or someone personally to help 
sponsor us, to make us their charity," Bates said. "I know that everyone needs 
money these days, and there are a lot of charities out there, and a lot of 
groups have their pet charities. We don't have one yet, and we're like nine 
charities in one. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can provide the food needs for these member agencies so their clients 
aren't hungry, they can better do what they're trained to do."

NEIGHBORS TEAM UP IN NAME OF EDUCATION

Maria Ruvalcaba believes in a good education for her children. But as a working 
mother raising a family in San Ysidro, that belief has often been hard to put 
into action, especially after her oldest son, Miguel, dropped out of high 
school temporarily a couple of years back. 
</P>
<P>
So despite her minimal free time, Ruvalcaba said yes to Frank and Margarita 
Vargas, who also live in the 400-unit Villa Nueva apartment complex, when they 
approached her almost two years ago for help in organizing ways to motivate the 
project's many children to study harder and consider college. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of kids here don't have enough space (in the apartments) to study, and 
many parents don't have a high level of education to be able to help with 
homework," Ruvalcaba said in explaining why she joined with other adults 
recruited by the Vargases. "The kids need a place to study, to have people they 
can ask questions of on homework." 
</P>
<P>
Today, the parents of Villa Nueva can point proudly to a special study lounge 
-- nicely carpeted and with tables, chairs, a computer and wall maps -- set up 
in the complex's community center as a result of numerous fund-raisers and 
volunteer work. 
</P>
<P>
Their group, the Pro-Education Coalition, has established ties with local 
school administrators and San Diego State University students and officials, 
who provide tutors, equipment and counseling for the children, both to improve 
their secondary school performance and to cajole them into thinking about 
higher education. 
</P>
<P>
And on Friday, the parents announced their first scholarships, presenting $150 
awards to eight students at a special ceremony and banquet. Included among the 
recipients was Miguel Ruvalcaba, who, after returning to high school, graduated 
last month and will attend Southwestern College in September. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a terrific project and it has really blossomed," said George 
Hutchinson, director of student outreach at SDSU, a department whose programs 
encourage minority students to go to college. "The fact that parents and 
students have organized where they live makes a big difference . . . and by us 
setting up shop in the complex rather than just doing it at a school, it is a 
real expansion of traditional outreach." 
</P>
<P>
Hutchinson learned of Villa Nueva's efforts by chance during a meeting with 
educators in the South Bay over how to reach more students. 
</P>
<P>
"It impressed me that San Diego State came to us, responding to the initiative 
of the parents," said Father John Blethen, director of social services at Villa 
Nueva. (The 19-year-old complex is owned and operated by the Catholic 
Augustinian order, which also operates St. Augustine High School in San Diego.) 
</P>
<P>
"We've been delighted to see the grass-roots activity of the parents. . . . The 
successes, while perhaps still small, result from their own work and 
enthusiasm, and not from anyone patronizing them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parents Often Intimidated 
</P>
<P>
John Gugerty, principal of San Ysidro Middle School -- which is attended by 
almost all of the junior-high age students in Villa Nueva -- said the idea of 
taking outreach to the complex makes it easier to involve parents. Too often, 
parents fail to come to school-based programs, partly because many work during 
school hours and partly because many -- especially if new to the United States 
-- feel intimidated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego State has made a major commitment to work in the community with its 
people," Gugerty said, "whereas so often you have people come in and come out, 
who you can't get hold of a week later for follow-up information or to be 
available later to talk with parents." 
</P>
<P>
Both Gugerty and the parents reserve special praise for Ernesto Corrales, a San 
Ysidro-born graduate of SDSU who now works as a counselor at the community's 
mental health clinic. Corrales lived at Villa Nueva when it was first built, 
and he graduated from nearby Southwest High School. 
</P>
<P>
Corrales has arranged for regular tutors, works with parents on new programs 
such as summer field trips, and spends a lot of time buttonholing students with 
information about how they can attend college. 
</P>
<P>
"He really talks to us about education," said Pancho Salazar, a Villa Nueva 
resident entering his senior year at Mar Vista High, who concedes that he has 
been less than enthusiastic at times about school. "He's shown me all the 
courses in auto mechanics I can take at Southwestern, and even took me there to 
visit. . . . My parents are telling me, 'Finish high school!' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Energized Our Staff' 
</P>
<P>
"Corrales has energized our staff (at the middle school) as well," Gugerty 
said. "Four times a year now, our teachers get together with those at the high 
school level, they tell us how our graduates have been doing, and we talk about 
new students we are sending up, doing more than just sending up test scores. 
</P>
<P>
"And to show how the overall relationship has been building, we put together 
some money, along with Montgomery High, this year for some scholarships to 
students, one of whom was a former San Ysidro Middle School graduate." 
</P>
<P>
But everyone gives the major credit to the cadre of Villa Nueva parents who 
stuck together in the beginning when things looked bleak. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a number of meetings at the start but there was a lot of apathy," Frank 
Vargas said. "A lot of things sound great, but in practice they are very, very 
hard to carry out." 
</P>
<P>
About 10 parents stayed active, Vargas said, and gradually the contacts with 
SDSU brought computers, counselors and support for the study room. 
</P>
<P>
"We see peer pressure all the time on kids to do bad, but now we'd like to use 
some of that pressure for them to do well. . . . That's part of the reason 
behind the scholarships." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proven Popular 
</P>
<P>
"I want our young people to be helped, not to lose school but stick with it and 
maybe someday have something for themselves," said Fidel Arce, who, along with 
his wife, Maria, is among the original nucleus of parents who planned dances, 
food sales and car washes to raise funds. 
</P>
<P>
The study center has proven so popular that its use has been divided into two 
time periods: a 3:30-5 p.m. session for elementary school students, and a 5-8 
p.m. session for secondary and college students. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad has been very active, and I heard about the center through him," said 
Imelda Jaramillo, a graduate of Chula Vista High who plans to attend 
Southwestern this fall, along with her brother Mario. 
</P>
<P>
Griselda Villa Nueva will be a ninth-grader at Mar Vista High in the fall. 
Already, she has benefited from being tutored in reading and math by Claudia 
Alvarez, a San Diego State senior engineering major who also grew up in San 
Ysidro. 
</P>
<P>
Both Raquel Marquez, a Mar Vista graduate attending Southwestern, and Ricardo 
Sepulveda, a Montgomery High graduate who will enter SDSU this fall, have 
helped younger students at the center. 
</P>
<P>
"The parents asked me to come, and at first I didn't want to . . . but now I 
see how much it can help the kids, and at 3:30 they are at the door, waiting 
for us to open the room," Marquez said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Breaking Stereotypes 
</P>
<P>
Sepulveda said the parents have spurred San Ysidro students such as himself to 
motivate each other to graduate and go on to college, a sentiment strongly 
echoed by Miguel Ruvalcaba. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to break stereotypes," Ruvalcaba said. "Some of my friends have asked 
me why I am doing so well now , and maybe my experience can help inspire 
others. But there are others who don't want to change, too." 
</P>
<P>
The program is always in need of more tutors. Alvarez has received a part-time 
job at TRW in Rancho Bernardo and will be leaving the program soon. Many 
children still are hesitant to use the study room, Corrales said, because they 
don't believe deep down that education will benefit them. 
</P>
<P>
"Some still think they can drop out and still get a decent living by working in 
construction," Corrales said. "They don't yet understand the benefits overall 
to having a good education." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Father Blethen is optimistic. "When we opened Villa Nueva, only 
three or four kids went beyond high school at all, just a handful. Now the 
numbers have grown tremendously." 
</P>
<P>
Hutchinson said that SDSU is now considering requests from other housing 
projects in San Ysidro and Southeast San Diego for assistance similar to that 
given Villa Nueva. Ruvalcaba said that students from other apartment complexes 
occasionally come to Villa Nueva's study center for tutoring. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to create a network to help anyone with the willingness to do what the 
parents are doing there," Hutchinson said.

I am intrigued by the fact that your reporter felt it necessary to stress the 
point that only one of the candidates running for the 76th Assembly seat, 
Stephen Thorne of Escondido, is an atheist ("11 Candidates Seek Seat Held by 
Bradley," June 27). 
</P>
<P>
Why weren't the religious affiliations, or lack of religious affiliations, of 
the 10 other candidates mentioned? 
</P>
<P>
Is this the kind of one-sided reporting that we are to expect in the upcoming 
election? Let's see some balanced campaign reporting for a change.

WHERE ARE THE FACTS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We have yet to note groups opposing the Southern California Edison-San Diego 
Gas &amp; Electric merger speaking in a way that would encourage factual 
dialogue about the issues involved. The most recent example was the story 
headlined "SDG&amp;E Merger Opponents File Ad Complaints" (June 22). 
</P>
<P>
In this story, opponents resort to what has become their favorite tactic: 
catchy rhetoric that impugns the character and integrity of the utilities. 
While that approach is a tried-and-true method used by groups that have little 
factual basis for their criticism, it is harder to understand why the media 
would repeat such language without challenging its sponsors for hard facts to 
back up their rhetoric. The Coalition for Local Control and the Utility 
Consumer Action Network are using the media and getting away with it. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing coverage of this type raises a couple of questions: 
</P>
<P>
* Is the media demanding at least some proof of inflammatory grandstanding 
against the utilities? If not, why not? 
</P>
<P>
* If so, should such proof not be indicated in the coverage? 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the state attorney general's office termed the opposing groups' 
filing "an unusual complaint." That's an understatement given the fact that the 
two utilities have filed a stack of supporting information and sworn testimony 
nearly 20 inches high with the state Public Utilities Commission and the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Have the reporters covering the story read the full filings? If they have, 
little has made its way into print. There is a lot of important information 
that should be digested and presented to the public to inform the debate on an 
important public policy issue. 
</P>
<P>
It certainly would seem fair to hold merger opponents to at least some minimal 
standards of proof, even if not as detailed or rigorous as what the regulatory 
agencies required of SDG&amp;E and SCE. The lack of any insistence by the media 
on factual information to back up anti-merger spokespeople's frequent charges 
is a tolerance of a form of latter-day, anti-merger McCarthyism. 
</P>
<P>
San Diegans for the Merger was formed specifically to encourage a balanced 
discussion. Unfortunately, to the extent that the rhetoric of the opposition is 
picked up without challenge, a balanced discussion becomes much more difficult 
to achieve.

A HOLLOW ARGUMENT IN UTILITY MERGER DEBATE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL R. PEEVEY, Michael R. Peevey is executive vice president of Southern 
California Edison. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the recurring issues in the ongoing utility merger debate in San Diego 
is "local control." It is also one of the most nebulous and ill-defined. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the Southern California Edison-San Diego Gas &amp; Electric merger 
have been unable to specifically define what local control means for San Diego 
and what its continuing benefits are, other than to express a vague feeling 
that local control, however it is defined, is preferable to losing a corporate 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
That argument loses its potency when one examines the local control situation 
now and looks at the decided disadvantages that a stand-alone utility would 
face in the future. 
</P>
<P>
We agree very strongly with Mike Madigan, a merger opponent, who wrote in a 
commentary on these pages a few months ago: "We would be remiss, all of us -- 
SDG&amp;E and Edison included -- if we failed to take this opportunity to 
consider carefully, calmly and dispassionately the future of San Diego's local 
utility." 
</P>
<P>
Lost in the often-emotional response by some San Diego political and business 
leaders has been Edison's struggle to do just that: offer a calm, dispassionate 
discussion of the facts and the benefits of the merger. 
</P>
<P>
We have embarked on a long, complicated and detailed process, and the recent 
filing of our case in chief with the California Public Utilities Commission 
provides significant factual information upon which San Diego residents, 
politicians and business people can base their support or opposition. 
</P>
<P>
But let's look specifically at the local control issue. From a practical, 
regulatory standpoint, local control is somewhat of a myth. The PUC, by virtue 
of its assigned role as a watchdog for ratepayer interests, is really the 
controlling body for all state utilities -- not the City Council, not the 
County Board of Supervisors nor any local agency. 
</P>
<P>
In this capacity, the PUC makes decisions regarding rate increases or 
decreases. This would not change whether the utility were headquartered in San 
Diego, Escondido or Rosemead. SDG&amp;E's recent filings for rate reductions 
were a product of that company's normal business process, not a product of a 
local political process. 
</P>
<P>
Two critical questions exist: 
</P>
<P>
* Will a stand-alone utility find it more difficult to assure delivery of power 
in difficult times? 
</P>
<P>
* Will a stand-alone utility be limited in its ability to respond to new energy 
needs, resulting in the construction of new plants here at great cost and an 
additional impact on the environment? 
</P>
<P>
In Edison's view, the answer is yes to both questions. Dwindling excess 
capacity will be a fact of life in the near future, as assessed by many 
independent sources across the country. Dwindling supply in the near-term 
future creates an urgent necessity for advance planning now to forestall 
oppressive rates in the future. 
</P>
<P>
That is why rates is the primary issue in this merger, and not the location of 
a headquarters. Are we to believe that if this merger fails, the city 
leadership will somehow find a way to ensure San Diego's energy future? 
</P>
<P>
Rates in the future will be driven by the utility's ability to obtain or 
generate the least expensive power from a variety of sources. Not to be ignored 
is the fact that SDG&amp;E realized its future vulnerability, and that 
realization was the catalyst behind the Tucson merger proposal. We can put this 
need for future energy sources into perspective by examining the current state 
of the utility industry. 
</P>
<P>
Experts who follow the utility industry today generally agree that the 
merger/consolidation trend will continue -- and that the trend is healthy. 
These experts believe that new technologies combined with the need to exploit 
economies of scale make the prospect of a country served by perhaps 30 
generating companies an appealing one. 
</P>
<P>
Shearson Lehman Hutton commissioned a 1988 study by Experimental Engineering 
Corp. of Maryland that suggested a merging of 136 U.S. utilities into 41. That 
study pointed to continuous service areas and transmission interconnections 
that formed logical groups. The annual savings was estimated at more than $3.4 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego must not be ignored by this trend. Nationally, the oversupply 
situation that has enabled SDG&amp;E to apply recently for lower rates will be 
at an end. Utilities that are currently selling excess power at bargain rates 
will require it themselves. Or supply and demand will dictate significantly 
increased prices. 
</P>
<P>
When that happens, small, stand-alone utilities will bear a tremendously 
increased burden, and their ratepayers will suffer. Local control will not 
prevent high energy costs when that happens. A strong generating capacity and a 
variety of energy sources will. That's what the merger promises to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
In a filing as part of our case with the PUC, former U.S. Energy Secretary 
James Schlesinger aptly stated, "There is no basis for an assumption that, in 
the absence of this consolidation, the power (that) the San Diego area needs in 
excess of what SDG&amp;E plans to generate from its own power plants will 
miraculously spring forth. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The merger should not be judged on the question of civic pride, but rather on 
what is in the long-term interest of San Diego. If the electric power provider 
is not in a position to provide added capacity or acquire the added power that 
will be needed in the 1990s, San Diegans will suffer. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's utility, like those across the nation, must be ready to respond to 
increased power needs in its service area at the same time as excess power 
supplies are dwindling.Regardless of whether it remains a stand-alone SDG&amp;E 
or the major division of SCE, the utility's challenge will be the same. It is 
unlikely that any energy analyst would support the notion that SDG&amp;E could 
meet that challenge more successfully alone. 
</P>
<P>
Another major issue in the local control debate focuses on local versus 
Rosemead-based leadership. In criticizing proposed employment contracts and 
board seats for San Diegans in the merged companies, opponents are ignoring the 
important fact that these contracts and board seats are precisely the method by 
which San Diego will maintain a strong presence within the organization. 
</P>
<P>
The continuity offered by the continued leadership of current SDG&amp;E 
executives is critical to the merger process. Our approach in this matter has 
been consistent with the best interests of the community. San Diego will, in 
fact, be Edison's largest operating division, and extremely influential within 
the company just by virtue of its size. 
</P>
<P>
There are other side issues concerning local control. Will service be poorer 
with a company headquartered outside the county? No. Although SDG&amp;E's 
service is good, Edison's is better as measured by such standards as numbers of 
complaints and customer-service response time. We will increase customer 
service via additional telephone-service hours and new branch offices around 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
Will the community lose support for its charitable and cultural organizations? 
No. Edison has a solid record of community involvement in hundreds of 
organizations in its service area. It has promised, in writing, to increase 
community participation in San Diego. Indeed, to lessen community involvement 
is not in SCE's best interest. 
</P>
<P>
There is an appropriate time for all of us to make our cases to the public. The 
process of hearings before the PUC safeguards the public interest and provides 
a forum that discounts emotion and makes decisions based on facts. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, PUC President Mitchell Wilk commented that "the time has come to 
separate fact from fiction, speculation, opinion and rhetoric." Southern 
California Edison welcomes the participation of the community in that process.

COUNCIL TO REVIEW APPROVAL OF NEW THEATER AT DEL AMO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A plan to build a 2,900-seat, nine-screen movie theater complex at Del Amo 
Fashion Center in Torrance has been approved by the city Planning Commission, 
but the decision has been appealed to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The Torrance Co., owners of Del Amo Fashion Center, submitted plans earlier 
this month to build a 50,000-square-foot Mann movie theater complex in a vacant 
85,000-square-foot building that formerly housed a drugstore. 
</P>
<P>
The nine theaters, ranging in size from 192 seats to 480 seats, would be 
entered from a central lobby. 
</P>
<P>
The plans were approved at a June 21 Planning Commission meeting by a vote of 5 
to 1. Two days later, Councilman Tim Mock appealed the decision, saying he 
would like the city to further examine whether the theaters will increase crime 
and parking problems at the mall. 
</P>
<P>
Del Amo Fashion Center already has a six-screen United Artists theater at the 
north end of the mall. Less than two miles north of the mall on Hawthorne 
Boulevard is a five-screen Mann theater at Old Towne Mall. Farther north along 
Hawthorne is a six-screen General Cinema theater near the Galleria at South Bay 
in Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Mock said one theater complex may be enough for the mall. "What we are talking 
about is the mall turning into theater row," he said. "I think this is 
something the council should decide." 
</P>
<P>
He said he would also like to examine whether another theater complex in the 
mall might attract loitering youngsters, crime and gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"What type of element do you bring in when you have too many theaters," he 
asked. "Is this a new direction the mall is going?" 
</P>
<P>
Torrance Co. officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said the council will most likely decide on the plan Aug. 15. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increase in Revenue 
</P>
<P>
Planning Commissioner Frank Rizzardi said he believes that the Torrance Co. may 
want to build the complex to help boost mall revenue, which has leveled off 
since the 1985 renovation of the nearby Galleria at South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Planning Commission Chairman Jack Messerlian said Torrance Co. officials told 
him that they have no plans to close the United Artists theater. 
</P>
<P>
Rizzardi said he voted against the complex because he is concerned that it will 
cause parking congestion on adjacent lots. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't like to see gridlock over there," he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
According to a Planning Department report, Del Amo Fashion Center was granted a 
parking variance in 1979 that calculates the required parking at a ratio of one 
space for each 222 square feet of floor area. The United Artists theater 
operates under that variance. 
</P>
<P>
Based on such a ratio, the new complex needs 225 parking spaces. However, a 
code requirement specifically for theaters calculates parking at a ratio of one 
parking space for every three seats. This would require the theaters to have 
966 parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Place Under 1979 Variance 
</P>
<P>
By approving the theater project, the commission chose to place the proposed 
complex under the 1979 variance, and Rizzardi said that may not provide enough 
parking. 
</P>
<P>
Messerlian said he also has concerns about parking but voted for the proposal 
because he thought parking problems would be minimal and because the project is 
compatible with adjacent businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"I voted for it reluctantly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Principal Planner Jeff Gibson said he believes that parking overflow from the 
proposed theaters could be contained on nearby mall lots. 
</P>
<P>
Messerlian said he is not too concerned about the new theater complex 
attracting loitering youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you have any use, movie theater or otherwise, where people congregate 
. . . there is going to be loitering and so forth," he said. "It's the nature 
of the beast."

SOUTH BAY OFFICIALS BEAT THE CLOCK WITH EARLY FUND-RAISERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A flurry of fund-raising activity has taken place among South Bay officials in 
recent weeks as they raced to beat the clock on new campaign contribution 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 73, which took effect Jan. 1 this year, limits the amounts 
politicians and would-be politicians can receive from individuals and political 
action committees. 
</P>
<P>
But the limits are based on the fiscal year, not the calendar year. 
</P>
<P>
So, to get maximum contributions for their next campaigns, some officeholders 
held political dinners or receptions before the fiscal year ended Friday. 
</P>
<P>
That allows them to tap the same sources of funds again in the new fiscal year, 
in effect doubling the contributions permitted during the first calendar year 
the limits are in place. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, Carson City Councilman John Anderson held his first 
political fund-raiser since being appointed in May to fill a council vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, George Nakano, the top vote-getter in last year's Torrance 
City Council race, held a fund-raiser even though his reelection campaign is 
almost three years away. 
</P>
<P>
The previous week, Torrance City Councilman Bill Applegate, who will be up for 
reelection next March, also had a fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5 Fund-Raisers, 1 Letter 
</P>
<P>
In fact, so far this non-election year, five of the seven Torrance council 
members have held fund-raising events and one sent a letter to supporters that 
also requested funds. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Sacramento, freshman Assemblyman Curtis R. Tucker Jr. 
(D-Inglewood) had an early June fund-raising event that netted an estimated 
$15,000. 
</P>
<P>
The events were all scheduled with the fiscal year deadline in mind. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance City Councilman Mark Wirth held a $100-per-person event in early June 
at a local restaurant. "We threw it together to beat the deadline," Wirth said. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, he holds fund-raisers in the summer or early fall and in January or 
February, but not this year. "I have to beat the July 1 deadline," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wirth said the contribution limits may encourage candidates to have a 
fund-raiser every year to build up a campaign treasury. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Nakano said Proposition 73 was the reason for his decision to hold a 
$100-per-person event just two days before the deadline. "I didn't have a 
fund-raiser last year," Nakano explained. "I was going to have one 
(fund-raiser) this calendar year anyway, so I might as well have it prior to 
June 30." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Tim Mock said he had a $200-per-person event in March, the first 
fund-raiser he has held during that time of year. Usually, he holds a campaign 
event in the fall, but he postponed last year's because "I wasn't quite sure 
what would happen with the funds if I raised them before January." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Katy Geissert, who last month sent out a letter announcing her intention 
to seek reelection, said in an interview that holding a fund-raiser before June 
30 allows a candidate or officeholder to go back to the same sources after July 
1. Geissert said her letter seeking support didn't specify a deadline for 
contributions, but she said she received several checks before the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 73, approved by the voters last year, imposes limits on 
contributions in state and local races. 
</P>
<P>
Individuals can give no more than $1,000, small political action committees can 
donate up to $2,500, and larger, established political committees can give a 
maximum of $5,000 to a candidate each fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Increase Frequency 
</P>
<P>
Geissert, who intends to run for reelection as mayor next March, said 
Proposition 73 may increase the frequency of fund-raisers at the local level. 
</P>
<P>
She said it is unclear whether politicians can use surplus funds from previous 
years. "So you have to assume that you are starting from zero." 
</P>
<P>
Torrance Councilman Dan Walker rescheduled his traditional $500-a-person 
fund-raiser from December, 1988, to the end of March to avoid uncertainty about 
how the money could be used. 
</P>
<P>
Walker said all his previous fund-raisers had been held in December. "My 
fund-raiser has been as consistent as the sunrise," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I have made it very, very clear that the reason it was moved from December to 
the early part of the following year was to avoid the ambiguity and uncertainty 
of the two propositions passed by the voters," Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
Ten court cases have been filed challenging various provisions of Proposition 
73, one of two campaign reform measures on the ballot in June, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The other measure, Proposition 68, would have established public financing of 
legislative campaigns, but it received fewer votes than Proposition 73, and as 
a result did not take effect. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Had Deadline in Mind 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary injunction issued by U.S. District Judge Lawrence K. Karlton 
allows candidates to use money raised before Jan. 1 for future campaigns as 
long as the contributions are within the new limits. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Tucker said he had Proposition 73's fiscal year deadline in mind 
when he scheduled the Sacramento fund-raiser for early June. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker said the measure has not deterred fund raising, although some 
contributors have been wary about "what you can do or can't do" under the new 
law. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Tucker said he has managed to raise "a substantial amount. It 
really hasn't hampered anything." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd (D-Carson) said he has heard some of his 
colleagues say that they planned fund-raisers before June 30 so major 
contributors do not "max out" by reaching the limit. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd said he did not reschedule his fund-raisers because of Proposition 73. 
But he acknowledged that having an event before the fiscal year ends and then 
holding another in the next fiscal year "gives you a double shot" at 
contributions from the same sources. 
</P>
<P>
Aides to Assemblyman Gerald N. Felando (R-San Pedro) and Sens. Robert G. 
Beverly (R-Manhattan Beach) and Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles) said there was no 
change in fund-raising schedules because of Proposition 73. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Dave Elder (D-San Pedro) and Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-Gardena) did 
not respond to a telephone inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Nothing but Negative' 
</P>
<P>
Walter Zelman, executive director of California Common Cause, a public interest 
group that sponsored rival Proposition 68, was sharply critical of the fiscal 
year provision of Proposition 73. 
</P>
<P>
"There is absolutely no reason to put in a contribution limit based on a fiscal 
year," Zelman said. "It's nothing but negative." 
</P>
<P>
The Common Cause measure would have banned all off-year fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
Zelman said the fiscal year deadline "encourages, if not forces, legislators to 
engage in the worst form of fund raising" -- during non-election years when 
their focus should be on legislation. 
</P>
<P>
One of the authors of Proposition 73, Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco), said 
he recently received nine or 10 unsolicited contributions from political action 
committees and corporations "attributable to the end of the fiscal year and a 
feeling of reassurance that such contributions were valid." 
</P>
<P>
Kopp defended the fiscal year provision, saying the concept was intended to 
allow a fund-raising period for primary and general elections.

DEBRIS FROM CITY BUILDINGS TO BE TESTED FOR ASBESTOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An inspector from the Air Quality Management District, following up on 
complaints about possible asbestos contamination from city-owned buildings 
being demolished in Lawndale, said Friday that the agency will test debris 
taken from the site for asbestos content. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Haynes, an AQMD air pollution specialist, inspected the site Friday 
where three city-owned houses had stood, on 167th Street at Osage Avenue, after 
two people complained to the agency that material they believed contained 
asbestos was being removed from there. 
</P>
<P>
The buildings, in the old city yard, had been used to store surplus city 
material, from old tractor tires to city Christmas decorations to inoperable 
city vehicles, city officials and residents said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Neighbors Complain 
</P>
<P>
One of the complaints was filed by Anthony Reed, whose mother and sister live 
next door to the yard. Reed said the city did not take sufficient precautions 
to prevent dust generated by the demolition from drifting downwind into 
neighbors' homes. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had collected several pieces of a siding material Tuesday that city 
workers had separated from other debris and placed in 55-gallon drums near a 
wall separating his property from the city's. 
</P>
<P>
Reed, who provided pieces of the mint-green material to the AQMD, said he was 
told by a city employee working at the site that it contained asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like the city of Lawndale to make some kind of determination, whether it's 
medical people or a private agency that checks for asbestos," Reed said. 
"Unless they prove to us we're safe, I may take (legal) action." 
</P>
<P>
Haynes said that AQMD chemists will test the material and that a report on its 
content would be issued next week. If material containing asbestos is found in 
connection with demolition at the site, the city could face a citation and a 
fine, Haynes said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Haynes said he could not confirm whether the material contained 
asbestos, he said it appeared to be a type of siding, no longer in use, that 
often contains asbestos, which has been known to cause cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"When they remove it, they should take precautions not to break it up," Haynes 
said. The material Reed said he took from the drums was broken into several 
pieces. 
</P>
<P>
The problem arose when city officials attempted to expedite the razing of the 
buildings, which Public Works Director Jim Sanders said had become an eyesore 
and a source of complaints from residents. 
</P>
<P>
After the city opened a new city yard on Manhattan Beach Boulevard east of 
Inglewood Avenue, the three old houses at the old city yard fell into disrepair 
and attracted vandals, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was ugly; it was terrible," said nearby resident Debbie Larratt. "I was 
glad they tore it down, but I wish they'd told us before they did it." 
</P>
<P>
When a contractor who had won a bid to knock down the three buildings failed to 
show up to do the job, Sanders said, the city canceled his contract and decided 
to do the job itself, using city employees and a rented crawler loader to haul 
debris into large bins at the site. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders, who learned how to operate a loader when he was in high school, said 
he worked at the site himself after city employees completed their regular 
workday at 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders, who has worked for the city since April, said city officials hoped to 
clear the lot for $4,800 or less, the contractor's estimated cost for the 
demolition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Material Being Checked 
</P>
<P>
Sanders said workers separated some concrete siding from other demolition 
debris but said he did not know if it contained asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
"We're checking it out," Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Jim Arnold said he and Sanders, who is a civil engineer, had 
inspected the site before the city began tearing down the buildings and found 
no evidence that the buildings contained asbestos. In the past, he said, if 
asbestos was found at a building slated for demolition, the city has hired 
specially licensed contractors. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've done the best we can," Arnold said. "I've seen a lot of 
demolition by private contractors, and we're doing a good job." 
</P>
<P>
City Councilwoman Carol Norman, who called Sanders "well-qualified" to oversee 
the project, also defended the city's actions. 
</P>
<P>
"If there was asbestos there, it was overlooked in the pre-inspection," said 
Norman, adding that Sanders is "a very conscientious young man, and I believe 
he probably realized he could save the city (money) by doing it himself." 
</P>
<P>
Norman said Lawndale's budget cuts over the past three years may have been a 
factor in Sanders' decision to take on the job. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders said the last of the debris was scheduled to be cleared from the lot 
Monday. One use for the lot under consideration is as a park, officials said.

LUMBERYARD MANAGER TO BE TRIED IN SLAYING; 
</P>
<P>
AVALON WOMAN'S DEATH SAID TO BE THE FIRST MURDER IN 40 YEARS ON CATALINA

<P>
The manager of an Avalon lumberyard has been ordered to stand trial in the 
murder of his former girlfriend, the first murder on Santa Catalina Island in 
more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Edward Kingman, 41, will be arraigned July 14 in Long Beach Superior 
Court in the beating death of Gail Lynn Pissula, 34, on April 20. 
</P>
<P>
Catalina Justice Court Judge Peter Mirich ordered the trial Friday after 
hearing testimony from three sheriff's investigators and from a friend of the 
dead woman. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators told Mirich that Kingman gave them varying accounts of his 
alleged conflict with Pissula, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Glenn Sommers. 
</P>
<P>
Kingman allegedly admitted that he had argued with Pissula on the night she 
died. But after first telling investigators that on the night she was killed he 
did not let Pissula into the trailer where the couple lived, he later said that 
he let her in and only pushed her, Sommers said. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics called to the trailer at about 4 a.m. said they found the woman's 
body on the ground outside. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said they found blood inside the trailer. The Los Angeles County 
coroner's office later ruled that Pissula was killed by a blow to the back of 
the head. 
</P>
<P>
At Friday's preliminary hearing, a friend testified that she had previously 
seen Pissula with bumps and bruises after Pissula had been with Kingman, 
according to Sommers. 
</P>
<P>
The woman's death shocked the close-knit town of Avalon. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Catalina Justice Court and the Avalon sheriff's station said they 
can't remember the last murder on the island. John Windle, who served for 22 
years as the island's constable, said there has not been a murder on Catalina 
for at least 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1960s, a local woman was convicted of involuntary manslaughter 
after shooting an intruder in her home, said Fern Whelan, clerk of the court. 
</P>
<P>
Kingman and Pissula had known each other since 1986, when both worked in Two 
Harbors near the west end of the island, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
Kingman later took a job as manager of Pebbly Beach Building Supply Co., a 
lumberyard just outside the center of Avalon, said Jack Fennie Jr., the owner 
of the business. 
</P>
<P>
Kingman helped reorganize the lumber business and made it more profitable, 
while living alternately in a trailer behind the lumberyard and aboard a 
sailboat anchored just offshore, Fennie said. 
</P>
<P>
Kingman and Pissula had lived together until they broke up a year ago and she 
moved to the mainland, acquaintances said. They said that she returned this 
spring to live with Kingman and to look for a job in Avalon.

HAIR RESTORER FALLS SHORT OF MARKETING HOPES 
</P>

<P>
When Rogaine was unveiled last September by the Upjohn Co. as the first 
scientifically proven hair-loss remedy, financial analysts envisioned desperate 
balding men running to doctors for prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
Today, those analysts and many consumers are disappointed, and Upjohn is 
preparing a new, more aggressive marketing campaign aimed at men whose 
embarrassment at seeking help for their hair loss may have prevented them from 
trying the drug. 
</P>
<P>
Upjohn says it is pleased with Rogaine's performance and blames drug industry 
analysts -- some of whom predicted that 1989 U.S. sales would top $300 million 
-- for unrealistic expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"Any new product that saw the sales that Rogaine did in the first few months 
would be deemed an outstanding success," said Upjohn spokeswoman Kaye Bennett. 
"We expected to succeed in the long run, while the analysts thought it would be 
a runaway success." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unrealistic Expectations 
</P>
<P>
Disappointed consumers also may have set unrealistic expectations by ignoring 
Upjohn's warnings that Rogaine would not work for most men. 
</P>
<P>
Although Upjohn does not release sales figures for specific products, drug 
industry analyst Ronald Nordmann of Paine Webber Inc. estimated that domestic 
sales for Rogaine accounted for $11 million of the Kalamazoo-based company's 
$755 million in net sales for the first three months of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
While Rogaine's sales were more than double those for the fourth quarter of 
1988, Nordmann said he interpreted the figures as disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
"The product has certainly been slow out of the starting gate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There are many reasons for Rogaine's sluggish sales, researchers and hair-loss 
specialists say. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
* Upjohn's 8-month-old, $20 million advertising campaign, featuring a man 
walking along a beach with the "see your doctor" phrase, may have been too 
low-key and vague. 
</P>
<P>
* The price, about $50 for a one-month supply and the necessary lifelong 
commitment to its use. 
</P>
<P>
Once you stop using Rogaine, any hair you may have grown back will fall out. If 
the drug has stopped your hair loss, you will make up for lost time as soon as 
you quit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Baffling Result 
</P>
<P>
Most baffling, however, is that companies featuring bogus baldness remedies on 
late-night television continue to outsell Rogaine by a ratio of about 10 to 1, 
said Mike Mahoney, president of the American Hair Loss Council. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest deterrent to Rogaine is that the man has to go to his doctor and 
admit that he is not comfortable with his hair loss. With the others, he can 
call an 800 number from the privacy of his own home," said Mahoney, whose 
nonprofit organization provides consumer information on hair-loss treatments. 
</P>
<P>
Upjohn's new marketing campaign, beginning in mid-May, will feature a toll-free 
number. The consumer will be connected with a hair-care specialist to discuss 
Rogaine and then will receive information on Rogaine via mail. 
</P>
<P>
Like the previous ads, Upjohn's still will not refer to the drug by name. U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration regulations prohibit companies from advertising 
prescription drugs by name unless there also is a full disclosure of any 
warnings and potential side effects. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Release Few Details 
</P>
<P>
The company has released few details about its new marketing strategy, but says 
it is designed to identify and target the market for the drug, which was 
approved by the FDA last August. 
</P>
<P>
Though analysts see the new campaign as Upjohn's reaction to slow sales, the 
company insisted that the more aggressive campaign always was part of its 
marketing strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the blame for disappointment with Rogaine's results also lies with the 
consumer, who may have been expecting too much. Upjohn warned consumers from 
the start that the tonic would not work at all for most men. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cite Limitations 
</P>
<P>
Rogaine, the trade name for a substance called minoxidil, is recommended for 
men younger than 40 who have been losing hair for 10 years or less and who have 
an area of baldness 4 inches in diameter or less on the crown of the head. 
</P>
<P>
Clinical trials showed that about 39% of men suffering from male-pattern 
baldness will either grow some new hair or stop losing hair after six to eight 
months on the drug. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to use this stuff, you've got to be patient and use it for a 
year," said Dr. David Whiting, medical director of the Baylor (University) Hair 
Research and Treatment Center in Dallas. "Otherwise, you'll never know if it 
would have worked." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
He Saw Results 
</P>
<P>
Bert Camp, a railroad engineer in Mineola, Tex., saw results after about three 
months on Rogaine. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I started using it, I've definitely seen some new hair growing," said 
Camp, 46. "And for 10 years, I've been using everything that I could get my 
hands on to stop hair loss." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Camp said, Rogaine was "too expensive, especially since I'm going to 
have to use it for the next 20 or 30 years." 
</P>
<P>
At the 2,270-store Rite Aid pharmacy chain in Harrisburg, Pa., spokeswoman 
Suzanne Mead said Rogaine sales had been slower than expected. 
</P>
<P>
Rogaine may almost double its market if the FDA approves it for use by women. 
Of the 50 million Americans losing their hair, 20 million are women, and 
clinical trials have found the drug to be slightly more effective on women, 
Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
Upjohn also is working on advanced application methods for the alcohol-based 
solution, which tends to be messy to apply, as well as teaming up with Procter 
&amp; Gamble Co. on new ingredients designed to increase efficacy and create 
new minoxidil products, such as a cream.

"This is a beginning, something that's good, something you build on," sports 
great turned businessman Willie D. Davis said Saturday as he became the first 
person to take his place on Inglewood's fledgling Promenade of Prominence. 
</P>
<P>
A granite marker bearing the name and likeness of Davis -- a pro football hall 
of famer who spent most of his 12-year career with Vince Lombardi's Green Bay 
Packers -- was unveiled on La Brea Avenue in front of KACE radio. It is 
headquarters for Davis' five-station broadcasting company. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Daniel K. Tabor, who emceed the sunny sidewalk event that slowed 
traffic and drew honks from passing motorists, said future markers will honor 
others who have contributed to Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to show that Inglewood isn't a crime-ridden, decaying city, but 
one where people are building things up and saying there is a positive side to 
Inglewood," Tabor said. 
</P>
<P>
The Promenade of Prominence concept was born last fall in Watts, when Dr. James 
A. Mays -- a cardiologist practicing in Inglewood and Los Angeles -- borrowed 
an idea from the Hollywood Walk of Fame and honored veteran Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Kenneth Hahn in granite along the edge of Will Rogers County Park. 
</P>
<P>
He said the new promenade in Inglewood is an expansion of that idea, aimed at 
highlighting what he called the hopeful side of black America, which he also is 
taking to Lynwood and Compton. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a heart as a symbol, in contrast to a star," Mays said. 
</P>
<P>

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: HE CAME TO TALK ABOUT THE CIVIL WAR, NOT TO FIGHT IT.

Federalist Sgt. Steve Mata leaned on a porch rail at the Drum Barracks in 
Wilmington and puffed slowly on his long-stemmed clay pipe, his 1816 
cap-and-ball rifle by his side. Though he was wearing long underwear, a blue 
wool uniform and 20-pound backpack in the morning sun, Mata said he felt pretty 
comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
Although Mata, 26, and several of his army buddies from the 55th Ohio Volunteer 
Infantry (OVI) were prepared for battle Saturday, they came to the Fourth of 
July picnic to talk about the Civil War, not to re-enact it. 
</P>
<P>
They were on hand to mingle with visitors to the Civil War museum, a former 
Army post built in 1861, and to answer questions about that period of U.S 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Mata and his unit participate in mock battles staged by Civil War buffs around 
the country, but Mata said: "I really enjoy telling people about it now instead 
of fighting the battles." 
</P>
<P>
Mata has been involved in Civil War reenactments since 1976, when he and his 
parents went to see a mock battle staged at Ft. Tejon State Historic Park near 
Gorman. Mata said he has been hooked ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"Something inside of me just clicked and I knew that it was for me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mata became such an avid Civil War buff, he says, that he often got kicked out 
his high school history class for arguing with his teachers about facts of the 
war. Several years ago he formed his own brigade, the 55th OVI, named in honor 
of relatives who fought in the war. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really disgusted with the way my high school teachers skimmed that 
period. I mean, the slave trade issue alone between 1840 and 1870 is worth a 
week," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as a guest speaker, "I get to go to schools and talk all I want about it," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also gets to fight the war all he wants. A welder by trade, the Torrance 
resident has fought in more than 200 mock battles since he started playing 
soldier -- more battles than there actually were during the war. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in every major battle there was," Mata said. "I've been in the 
battle of Bull Run, Gettysburg, Shylock, Tenn., Antietam, Md., and a lot that 
didn't even exist." Some have involved more than 16,000 participants and lasted 
more than three hours. 
</P>
<P>
Although the battles are mock, some of Mata's injuries are painfully real. 
</P>
<P>
Six weeks ago he fought in Virginia and caught Lyme disease from a tick, which 
hospitalized him for a week. A year ago, a wooden spike cut through his leg, 
just below the knee, during the filming of a Civil War battle in Mississippi. 
The injury required surgery, but Mata has no permanent damage from it. 
</P>
<P>
"Just the price of fame, I guess," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite those hazards, Mata plans to fight again at Ft. Tejon this month, and 
he is especially excited about a mock battle planned in Atlanta in September. 
More than 6,000 Civil War buffs are expected to be there. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm always up for a big fight," Mata said. Louis Aguilar

HARBOR DEPARTMENT WANTS TO DEMOLISH BUILDINGS; 
</P>
<P>
AGENCY OPPOSES CANNERY-TO-SHOPS PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal to renovate a Wilmington pet food cannery into a restaurant and 
shopping complex has run into opposition because the Los Angeles Harbor 
Department wants to demolish it to make way for expansion of a maintenance 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
The plan to remodel the Heinz Petfood Co. cannery, which is scheduled to close 
Sept. 1, is backed by Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores and a 
citizens advisory committee that is planning a waterfront development on port 
property in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
The advisory committee, which was appointed by the Los Angeles Harbor 
Commission, has recommended that its study area be expanded to include the 
cannery, which is on Fries Avenue, not far from the foot of Avalon Boulevard, 
the focal point of the committee's review. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drawing Card 
</P>
<P>
"We need an anchor, we need something that is going to give this place an 
identity, something that would be unique, that would give us a drawing card 
that nobody else in the south coast area has to offer," said committee Chairman 
George De La Torre, who first proposed the cannery conversion and then 
persuaded Flores to back him after taking her to see a similar project in 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor Department officials, however, say they have reviewed the proposal and 
concluded that they can't give up the land, which they plan to use as a storage 
area for heavy machinery. 
</P>
<P>
However, their decision could be overturned by the harbor commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
"The plan to redo the yard depends on the cannery property," said Nelson 
Hernandez, the port official who acts as liaison to the committee. "Without it, 
we really can't provide the type of services that we need for our tenants right 
now and in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Top aides to Flores said Friday that the councilwoman will press for 
commissioners, along with other port officials and community leaders, to take a 
walking tour of the area to see its potential. 
</P>
<P>
Flores' chief deputy, Bernie Evans, said: "The councilwoman wants everybody to 
go down there, the citizens advisory people, the commissioners, some key staff. 
. . . Let's walk down to the cannery site, and let us visualize it before we 
set everything in concrete." 
</P>
<P>
"We're still going to pursue it," added Ann D'Amato, Flores' harbor-area 
deputy. "We're not just going to give up." 
</P>
<P>
The department's decision sparked the ire of members of the advisory committee, 
which learned of it last week from Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was shook up," said committee member Gertrude Schwab, adding that 
relations with Hernandez have been "pretty cool" ever since. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the decision, De La Torre said the committee has asked to meet 
directly with harbor commissioners. "It just seems that Wilmington has never 
really been in a position to enjoy the fruits of the harbor. . . . " he 
complained. "You look at San Pedro, you look at all the recreational 
facilities, tourist facilities. And what have they done for Wilmington?"

Photo, Scare tactics -- Charlie Alexander, 14, was one of about 30 costumed 
teen-agers who went trick or treating Saturday night in Woodland Hills. But 
they weren't looking for candy. Instead, they collected food and clothing for 
the homeless who stay at the Valley Shelter in North Hollywood. Dana 
Sonderling, a 14-year-old, and two of her friends conceived the idea weeks ago 
when they talked about how much fun it would be to have a Halloween party. The 
teen-agers passed out bulletins to 100 households notifying them of the 
unorthodox collection. "It's a wacky idea, a Halloween party on Fourth of July 
weekend," said Dana's father, Don Sonderling, but he said the cause made it 
worthwhile. DAVID BOHRER / Los Angeles Times

There are days when baseball managers have a sense of knowing whether their 
team will win or lose. 
</P>
<P>
It's difficult to explain, really. There's just a feeling a manager has on 
occasion, where he can actually forecast the outcome before the opening pitch. 
</P>
<P>
There obviously are times a manager's intuition proves wrong, as depositions in 
the Pete Rose case suggest, but you'd be surprised just how often they're 
right. 
</P>
<P>
"There are just games where the vibes are not there," Padre Manager Jack McKeon 
said. "The biorhythms are not right. Everything's messed up. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing you can do, and nothing to stop it, but there are games when 
you just know this isn't going to be your night. 
</P>
<P>
"And baby, this was one of them." 
</P>
<P>
What it was Saturday was a 9-3 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals before 42,270 at 
Busch Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
You've got to understand that McKeon's premonition was strongly assisted at 
about 4 p.m. when pitcher Eric Show stepped into his office. 
</P>
<P>
Show, scheduled to start in an hour and a half, told McKeon that he awoke with 
a bad back. He underwent massages and therapy and even sat in a whirlpool bath. 
It was of no use. He couldn't even bend over to touch his toes. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time this season, McKeon was going to have come up with another 
starter from outside his rotation, and he had 90 minutes to do it. He huddled 
quickly with pitching coach Pat Dobson, decided that it would be between Pat 
Clements and Fred Toliver, and opted for Clements because the Cardinals have 
been susceptible to left-handed pitching. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't have a whole lot of choice," McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
No one will ever know just what Show might have accomplished had he pitched 
Saturday, but the box score forever will show that Clements was not the answer. 
The Cardinals knocked him out by the fourth inning and put the Padres away two 
innings later. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Padres' fifth consecutive defeat at Busch Stadium, and unless they 
find a way to win today, they'll have accomplished a feat that no other Padre 
club has accomplished in their 20-year history: 
</P>
<P>
Being swept for an entire season in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just not doing anything right," said Tony Gwynn, the Padre right 
fielder. "We're not getting the big hits. We're not getting the clutch 
pitching. We're not even getting the breaks. 
</P>
<P>
"When all those things happen, you can't be surprised by the results." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, led again by Bip Roberts, had nine hits, just one fewer than the 
Cardinals. They even had one more extra-base hit. But they don't have pitchers 
who can hit like the Cardinals', nor do they an infield the pitchers can depend 
upon. 
</P>
<P>
You'd have thought the Padres would have learned their lesson Friday night when 
they were beaten by a 408-foot home run by pitcher Scott Terry. Nope. This 
time, they intentionally walked Tony Pena to get to starting pitcher Ken Hill, 
and two pitches later, Hill sent a fastball into left field for a run-scoring 
single that ignited a five-run second inning. 
</P>
<P>
It was Roberts who helped the Padres to peck away at the Cardinal lead, 
reducing it to 5-3 in the fourth inning with a run-scoring double. The hit tied 
Tony Gwynn's two-week-old club record of reaching base nine consecutive times, 
but by the time he grounded out in the sixth, the game's suspense already was 
over. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble might have been that Roberts wasn't playing third base this night. 
He was in left, enabling Tim Flannery to make just his second start since June 
11. 
</P>
<P>
The difference was apparent in the fifth. The Cardinals opened the inning with 
Vince Coleman drawing a walk from Toliver, and Jose Oquendo advancing him to 
third with his third of four hits. 
</P>
<P>
Ozzie Smith hit a routine grounder to Flannery. As soon as the ball was hit, 
Flannery said, he was thinking, "Should I go to home to get Coleman, or should 
I go to second for the double play? Really, I wasn't sure what I should do." 
</P>
<P>
It was a decision he never had to make. The ball skipped off the heel of his 
glove, bouncing away from him and down the left-field line. Coleman scored, 
Oquendo went to third, and Smith was at second by the time Roberts retrieved 
the ball. Before Flannery had a chance to fume, Pedro Guerrero hit a line drive 
to him. Oops. The ball caromed off his glove and rolled into foul territory. 
Two more runs scored, and Guerrero was at second. Two balls. Two errors. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I've made three errors in a game in the minors once, and I think I've 
even made two errors in the same inning," Flannery said, "but errors on 
back-to-back plays, uh-uh. I can't ever remember being that bad. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, during a course of a season, you have parts in winning games, and 
you have parts in losing games. Well, I'm the one responsible for losing this 
one. Give me the credit for this loss." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, someone else already was accepting blame for the Padres' 42nd defeat 
at the halfway point of their season. Though he was not a participant in this 
slapstick affair, Show said he felt responsible simply because he was not on 
the mound when he should have. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, it's very hard to take," said Show, who had not missed a start 
since 1986, when he was placed on the 15-day disabled list with elbow 
tendinitis. "I'm just not used to this. You hate to have someone trying to pick 
up for you anyway, but when they have to tell a guy he's starting an hour and a 
half before game time, that's really not fair. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure it's perplexing to everyone on the team, anyway. Here I was taking 
batting practice yesterday and throwing on the side, and now I'm about 
disabled. How can anyone understand that? I even can't." 
</P>
<P>
Show says he expects to be ready in time for his next scheduled start Friday 
against the Pittsburgh Pirates, but with the nature of back injuries, who knows 
for sure? 
</P>
<P>
McKeon has his own perplexity with Clements. Is this the Pat Clements who 
allowed just two hits in 4 1/3 innings Tuesday, when he was the winning pitcher 
in the Padres' 5-3, 17-inning victory over the Dodgers? Or is this the Pat 
Clements who already has bounced around in four different organizations in a 
three-year career? 
</P>
<P>
"You've got me," McKeon said. "We don't know who the real one is, but I know we 
better find out real quick." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, though, McKeon is beginning to believe that the team he has been 
seeing the first half of the season might be the same one he'll be stuck with 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, the Padres failed to obtain a hit in almost every critical 
situation, leaving 10 men on base Saturday, 21 in the first two games of this 
series. The Cardinals scored six of their runs with two outs, and their three 
others on Flannery's errors.

ELROD HENDRICKS ALWAYS AROUND GAME HE LOVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oh, for the life of a major-league baseball coach. All you do is watch a ball 
game for a couple hours a day, right? 
</P>
<P>
You don't if you're Elrod Hendricks, the Orioles' bullpen coach since Earl 
Weaver hired him in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks is a rare baseball man in that he gets out of bed before noon. He has 
to. He runs a baseball camp for kids ages 6-16 at McDonogh School with Mike 
McMillan, the school's football and baseball coach. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday morning, before 8 o'clock, Hendricks, in his red and white van, pulled 
in to the beautiful McDonogh campus to get things organized for his 130 
campers. 
</P>
<P>
"Elrod's here before I am," said McMillan. "That was the first thing we had to 
agree on when we started this seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Some baseball players think all they have to do if they have a camp is sign 
autographs. Elrod is here every day until he has to leave for the ball park." 
</P>
<P>
From 8:45 to 9, Hendricks talks with his 23 counselors, one of whom is his 
16-year-old son, Ryan, who is already a star McDonogh athlete. At 6-foot-3, 
Ryan is a lanky but broad-shouldered 190 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Ryan is our varsity tight end," says McMillan. "He has good hands and he can 
catch the football. He also plays basketball and baseball for us. He's a first 
baseman." 
</P>
<P>
"They tried to make a catcher out of Ryan," says his father, who caught in four 
World Series for the Orioles and New York Yankees, "and that about drove him 
out of baseball." 
</P>
<P>
At 9 o'clock, McMillan and Hendricks go into the cafeteria to address the 
campers. 
</P>
<P>
"You handled yourselves well when I brought Gregg Olson out here yesterday," 
Hendricks tells the youngsters, "so I'll bring some more players, plus some 
from the Toronto club. Mr. Olson signed autographs, but I want to stress that 
this is not an autograph session. The reason we're here is to learn about 
baseball. Now let's hit it." 
</P>
<P>
The kids break into their various groups, depending on their ages. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Bosley, assistant baseball coach at Randallstown High, takes some older 
boys to the varsity diamond. Ryan Hendricks has some younger ones on a junior 
field, where the bases are 60 feet apart. McMillan's son, Mike Jr., a recent 
McDonogh grad who will enter Western Maryland in the fall, is loading the 
batting machine under the football stadium for 9-year-old Nick Rogers, a 
Calvert School fourth-grader. 
</P>
<P>
"The joy of this," Elrod Hendricks says, "is seeing a kid improve. Sometimes we 
see one for the first time and we say, 'It'll take a miracle.' And then maybe I 
go on the road with the ball club for a week and when I come back the kid is 
starting to look like a baseball player." 
</P>
<P>
There are two three-week sessions each summer. More than half the campers do 
both sessions. The second begins July 10. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike McMillan is perfect for this kind of work," says Hendricks. "He's sincere 
and he loves kids. He reminds me of Brooks Robinson. By the second day, he 
knows all their names -- their first and last names." 
</P>
<P>
The air is stiflingly humid and the temperature is in the high 90s, and 
Hendricks is out on the mound with five pitchers. He is working on their 
motions. Sweat pours off the 49-year-old coach. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing about Elrod," says McMillan, "he'll always give you an honest 
answer." 
</P>
<P>
"OK, Elrod," says a visitor. "Answer this one: Are the Orioles going to win 
their division?" 
</P>
<P>
"You want an honest answer?" Hendricks says. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course." 
</P>
<P>
"Honestly," he says, "I don't know. If we stay healthy we have a real good shot 
at it. Our pitching went through hell last weekend in California. Our bullpen 
is dead." 
</P>
<P>
A McDonogh maintenance man volunteers an opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm worried about New York closing in on our lead," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks does a double take. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to start worrying in June," says this veteran of 31 years in 
professional baseball, "it's going to be a long season. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen 'em yet," says Hendricks, "but I think Toronto is the team to 
beat. They have a good club, and they're starting to play good baseball." 
</P>
<P>
In a matter of hours, Hendricks will see Toronto, which is here for a 
three-game series. 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks arrives at the Stadium at 3 o'clock to begin his day's work with the 
Orioles. He knows it will be late when he leaves. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't play a game in under three hours," he says, "so that's 10:30 when it 
ends. I'm here for at least an hour after that, getting ready for the next day. 
It's after midnight when I get home to get a little sleep so I can come to 
McDonogh first thing in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks' first 1989 look at the Blue Jays does make them look like the team 
to beat -- so the Orioles beat them, 16-6. When it ends, the clock says 11:07. 
It will be more like 1 a.m. when Hendricks gets home. 
</P>
<P>
But with the Orioles in first place, and with kids at his camp learning 
baseball and improving, Elrod Hendricks is not complaining. In spite of the 
hours, it's a very good life.

COMMENTARY; 
</P>
<P>
AN EMINENT ENTRY IN THE FACE-IS-RED BOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIRLEY POVICH, Special to The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is not to say Pete Rose is guilty, or otherwise. This is to say Major 
League Baseball, in the person of rookie commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti, 
shot itself in the foot and both shins in its pursuit to hang a guilty verdict 
on Peter Edward Rose. 
</P>
<P>
This clumsy act by the baseball commissioner took the form of a letter written 
April 18 to the presiding judge before whom Ron Peters would be up for 
sentencing. Said Peters was a convicted felon afoul of the law for such major 
mischiefs as trafficking in drugs and cheating on his taxes. He also mingled 
this activity with his sideline as a bookmaker, and recently had borne witness 
before the baseball commissioner Pete Rose was a client who had bet on 
ballgames. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter best fitting an aphorism that the best letters are those not 
written, Giamatti advised the judge in behalf of a lighter sentence for Peters: 
"It is my purpose to bring to your attention the significant and truthful 
cooperation Mr. Peters has provided my special counsel. ... I am satisfied Mr. 
Peters has been candid, forthright and truthful. ... " 
</P>
<P>
It was a pitch Giamatti now wishes he had back. Not only did Pete Rose and his 
counsel smack it out of the lot, but out of it also has spurted, with Roman 
candle effect, a series of explosions, all of them wounding organized baseball 
and its sacred fellowship with the nation's courts. 
</P>
<P>
Rose and his lawyers pounced on Giamatti's act to hale him into another court, 
citing "prejudice," and not only got a 14-day stay from Giamatti's royal 
command to appear before him for a hearing, but from a gutsy county judge they 
got ringing denunciation of the commissioner as a knave who had "prejudged" 
Rose's case. 
</P>
<P>
And well paddled was his eminence, the commissioner, by Judge Norbert A. Nadel: 
"We further find that a hearing set for tomorrow in New York would be futile 
and illusory, and the outcome a foregone conclusion." It was plain talk. 
</P>
<P>
Later there ensued some cheap shots by those baseball lovers in favor of 
lynching Rose. Nadel was denigrated as a mere county judge politicking for 
re-election in Rose's district. No sign he loved baseball. And weren't courts 
supposed to be friendly to baseball? However, an intrusion by the courts was 
always there for baseball to fear, despite the five times the game has won 
affirmation of the 1922 Supreme Court ruling it is exempt from antitrust laws. 
And three days after Nadel's ruling, baseball found itself back in court, this 
time by its own forced initiative. It was seeking from the Ohio Court of 
Appeals an overturn of Nadel's ruling for Rose. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing doing. Their plea had no legal standing, Giamatti and his counsel were 
told, because the appeals court would not intervene against a judgment that was 
not yet final. 
</P>
<P>
So the whole business is back in Nadel's court, with organized baseball forced 
to ponder whether, on July 6, Judge Nadel will decide he was wrong on June 25, 
and that what he used to believe was "prejudgment" of rules has evaporated into 
three huzzahs for Giamatti. 
</P>
<P>
Friends of the commissioner and his counsel have quickly prepared an "out." 
Such letters, they are saying, are often written by prosecutors to a judge 
before the sentencing of a friendly witness. So, no big deal. 
</P>
<P>
Ha, but the person who signed the letter to this sentencing judge was not any 
prosecutor seeking to reward a friendly witness. The signature it bore was that 
of the man who, as commissioner, would ultimately judge the Pete Rose case. 
Giamatti was being told that even baseball commissioners are not supposed to 
prejudge serious matters. 
</P>
<P>
For organized baseball the worst-case scenario is that Rose will be delivered 
from the jurisdiction of the commissioner and given the right to battle it out 
in the courts. This would be a big plus for Rose's attorneys, who would gain 
the right to cross-examine all the witnesses, an unsavory lot anyway. It would 
be different from a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
So, at a point when Rose was in a sweat about all the prospects of being banned 
from baseball and banished as a Hall-of-Famer-in-waiting, from whom did he get 
a break? From his accusers. From the commissioner who wrote the letter that 
goes into baseball's Red Book as the biggest boo-boo in commissioner history. 
And even if, as explained, the letter was written by Giamatti's lawyer and 
merely signed by the commissioner, it can still claim a record: Biggest blunder 
on advice of counsel.

FANS HAVE THE FEVER FOR ORIOLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL TANTON, The Baltimore Evening Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In suddenly baseball-mad Baltimore, the fans certainly have noticed the 
Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
And the Orioles have noticed the fans, too. 
</P>
<P>
"The people are really getting into it," Orioles infielder Rene Gonzales said. 
"The other day I stopped at a red light in Towson (Md.) near where I live, and 
a cab driver pulled up next to me. He just looked over and said, 'Do it!' " 
</P>
<P>
Things like that didn't happen to the Orioles last year. Especially not last 
year, when the Orioles lost a club-record 107 games. 
</P>
<P>
But even then, they did talk about the Orioles, as Gonzales points out. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year," he said, "people used to say to me all the time, 'What's going on 
with the Orioles?' Now they ask me the same thing -- 'What's going on?' -- only 
now the question has the opposite meaning." 
</P>
<P>
Even after Thursday night's 11-1 loss to Toronto at Memorial Stadium, the 
Orioles are in first place in the American League East by 6 1/2 games. That's 
still the biggest lead in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
That sort of thing -- a rise from last place to first -- would ignite the fans 
of any town. But several of the Orioles are quick to point out that the people 
of Baltimore have not just discovered the Birds. 
</P>
<P>
"These people supported us well even last year," said pitcher Jay Tibbs. "But I 
can see how excited they are now. I live in an apartment complex in Timonium 
(Md.), so I get to see a lot of my neighbors. They're always telling me, 'We 
saw the game last night,' or they just say, 'Keep it up.' Basically, they're 
just happy with our success. That's very noticeable to us." 
</P>
<P>
One Oriole who has not sensed any difference, as far as the fans' reaction is 
concerned, is Joe Orsulak. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not that recognized," he said, "so nobody says anything to me. I live in 
Mike Boddicker's old house in Timonium. They all recognized Mike. 
</P>
<P>
"About the only person I see the change in is my dentist," Orsulak said. "He's 
a big Oriole fan. He's really excited this year." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the other Orioles see evidence of the fever, though. 
</P>
<P>
Curt Motton, an Oriole outfielder 20 years ago and now one of Manager Frank 
Robinson's coaches, says you don't have to look far to see proof of it. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see it in the stands," Motton said. 
</P>
<P>
And indeed you can. The crowd of 39,528 Thursday night brings the total for 13 
dates in June to 463,606. The average for the month so far is 35,662, more than 
the club record of 32,935, set in August 1980. 
</P>
<P>
For the season, the Orioles have now drawn 1,052,568. Clearly, they have a good 
shot at setting an all-time Oriole attendance record. The record, set in 1985, 
is 2,132,387. 
</P>
<P>
None of that is lost on the players, either. 
</P>
<P>
"When you see crowds of 35,000 and 39,000 out here on weeknights, you know 
these people are really turned on," Traber said. "The players realize it." 
</P>
<P>
"It makes you feel great to see so many fans out here," said catcher Mickey 
Tettleton. "The players love having all this support. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't personally experienced that much contact with the fans," Tettleton 
said. "But a few times, when my wife and I have gone out to eat, we've heard 
people saying the Orioles are playing well. Stuff like that. The people don't 
say it because of me. They don't know who I am. They just say it." 
</P>
<P>
Tettleton, a relative unknown last year, is one of the Orioles' biggest heroes 
with his 17 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
When Elrod Hendricks took Tettleton to his baseball camp the other day, the 
kids mobbed the O's slugger. Mickey knew what he'd be asked. It had to do with 
Froot Loops. 
</P>
<P>
"Which came first," a youngster asked Tettleton, "the home runs or the Froot 
Loops?" 
</P>
<P>
"All I can tell you," Tettleton said, "is I've been eating Froot Loops all my 
life."

REDONDO BEACH TRIATHLETE THROWS NUTRITION TO THE WIND ON HIS SWIM, RIDE, RUN TO 
TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRYL LYNCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Garrett McCarthy is a couch jockey: He guzzles beer, despises health snacks and 
hounds junk food. Pizza, chocolate, fast-food menus, the usuals. 
</P>
<P>
But wait. 
</P>
<P>
The Redondo Beach resident also happens to be one of the country's top 
triathletes, a knotty warrior who swims, bikes and runs through a couple of 
hours of torture at about 20 races a year. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he still sticks to his rigid schedule of -- by normal athletic 
standards -- unhealthy eating habits and unusual training routines. 
</P>
<P>
And if basketball youths are buying Michael Jordan's Wheaties and midget league 
defensive ends are eating soup because Howie Long said so, then budding 
triathletes just might start skipping the health food aisle and heading for the 
storefront deli. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I do things out of the ordinary, but that's just me," the 25-year-old 
McCarthy said. "Even my dad looks at me strangely when I eat all the junk I 
do." McCarthy's father, who holds a Ph.D. in nutrition, may raise a higher 
eyebrow than even his son's racing foes. 
</P>
<P>
But McCarthy's sweet tooth and when-I-can workout schedule have always been a 
part of him; triathlons came into the picture in 1985 when he ran in one at 
USC. He has increased his number of races every year and plans on running in 30 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy's aloofness toward his sport would probably go unnoticed if he were 
just another face on the triathlon circuit. But he is fast becoming 
recognizable and there are only a handful of triathletes considered better -- 
for now. 
</P>
<P>
"He's really picking up the pace. He's the next guy to watch for in world 
triathlon competition," said Tim Downs, publicity director for the Bud Light 
U.S. Triathlon Series. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy blazed to a fifth-place finish at the USTS's meet in San Jose on June 
3, opening the eyes of such triathlon luminaries as Dave Scott, Scott Tinley, 
Mark Allen and Mike Pigg. More recently, he placed fourth in the series event 
in Baltimore on June 24. His series points this year place him fourth in the 
national standings. 
</P>
<P>
And McCarthy achieved that while not only snacking crazily but also taking part 
in an everyday ritual other triathletes can't afford -- he works at a job. Full 
time, and then some. 
</P>
<P>
"Last winter, I was working seven days a week, putting in around 80 hours. I 
was working at two wine stores at once, and I still ran in several triathlons," 
he said. McCarthy recently quit selling wine, not so he could concentrate on 
triathlon training but to take a marketing position with a new energy-drink 
company. And he still finds time for the intense training necessary to compete 
in triathlons, which consist of a one-mile swim, a 25-mile bike ride and a 
6.2-mile run. 
</P>
<P>
"It's safe to say I don't have a regular training program. I take my bike to 
work, and I have my running shoes there, and any time I get a break, wherever I 
am, I'll throw on my shoes and run several miles." 
</P>
<P>
Downs says he doesn't know of any other world-class triathlete who works at a 
day job full time. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy can think of only one, friend Mike Collins, and acknowledges the toll 
the dual role takes on his time. 
</P>
<P>
"No two weeks of training have ever been the same," he said. "That's why I 
don't have time for garbage miles. Some people say they train 300 miles a week 
on a bike, but they're not pushing themselves. Those are garbage miles." 
</P>
<P>
With the unorthodox cemented as his specialty, McCarthy gets along best under 
his own training rules -- except during the race. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough when I'm running by myself (in a race), without anyone pushing me, 
because you have no one to gauge yourself off of to see whether you're slowing 
down or holding your pace. And it's not good to look behind you, because that's 
a sign of weakness." 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy was holding fast to his philosophy during the San Jose event, leading 
the pack through the swimming and biking portions. That's when Pigg, a noted 
biker, came riding up behind him. 
</P>
<P>
"And he passed by me, as usual, and I figured, It's about time for this guy to 
know who I am. So I caught up to him and passed him back, and nobody ever does 
that to Pigg, and he's looking over me like, 'Who the hell is this guy?' " 
</P>
<P>
As sort of a topping on McCarthy's cherries-and-cream personality, he also 
hot-dogged a bit by waving at a friend in the pace vehicle cruising alongside 
the pair. "He (Pigg) must have been rolling his eyes," he said, clearly amused 
with himself. 
</P>
<P>
Along with his new success on the triathlon circuit comes fame. But that too is 
handled in an amused, everyday manner by McCarthy. He is still getting used to 
signing autographs ("I feel a little funny about someone asking me to sign my 
name") and people asking for training advice. 
</P>
<P>
He especially has problems responding to the latter request. "I guess they 
(fans) expect me to be a health nut, or to have a rigid training program. I 
don't strain my cottage cheese, I don't eat granola and my favorite snack is a 
one-pound bag of M and M's. And I drink beer, so I don't know what to tell 
them," he says, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
His beer-drinking claim is backed up by Downs: "He likes to go have his share 
of beers, but you wouldn't tell by looking at his body." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, a person couldn't tell McCarthy runs triathlons by looking at his 
body. 
</P>
<P>
The sport is tailor-made for long-legged striders with huge lungs and endless 
stamina. Most world-class swimmers, bikers and runners fit that category. So 
what's McCarthy -- 5 feet, 6 inches with padded loafers underfoot -- doing 
excelling in a lanky man's game? 
</P>
<P>
"He is a tremendous swimmer," said Downs. "His forte is swimming. He is always 
the first out of the water." 
</P>
<P>
That is the biggest advantage that has helped McCarthy stroke into the company 
of the elite names of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
He swam for four years for perennial power USC, wrapping up his career in 1986. 
He was on scholarship for only three years, however. He volunteered his 
scholarship during his junior year so that the Trojans could use it to sign a 
blue-chip prep swimmer. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave it up so that I could be on a winning team. We were ranked 15th my 
sophomore year, whereas we were always ranked in the top three," he said. With 
the new team member aboard, USC's tradition was restored with a top-five 
ranking in McCarthy's senior year. "I would rather swim and pay my own way than 
be on a sub-par team," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy is a one-man team now and sifting his way easily through the demanding 
rigors of being a triathlete. He especially gets a thrill out of one part of 
being a top-notch performer in a growing sport -- endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of neat to get $150 a month to wear a certain brand of sunglasses. I 
probably would have worn them anyway," he said. McCarthy's endorsement deals 
are in the infantile stage, nowhere near the annual thousands earned by the 
Tinleys and the Allens. But he refuses to market himself for more money, even 
though his degree from USC was earned in marketing. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, it would be like showing off if I went to all these companies touting 
myself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, he was thrilled when the sunglasses company sent him a bonus check for 
having his picture, with glasses on, appear in a recent issue of Gentleman's 
Quarterly. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly his act is far from the so-called civilized reaches of that 
publication, but McCarthy seems to do things just fine his own way. 
</P>
<P>
And he staunchly defends his method of training, which seems intent with 
defiance but is actually quite natural within his attitude toward life. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't have fun eating granola, cottage cheese, stuff like that. To me, 
the mentality of training always overcomes the body. If you're enjoying what 
you're eating, and doing, you're going to have a better frame of mind. If 
you're always saying, 'Aw, this sucks, I have to eat this stuff,' then you get 
down on yourself, and in turn it's going to affect your body." 
</P>
<P>
So if you're a so-so athlete training to keep in shape, you may not want to 
sign up for McCarthy's techniques. But if you're a world-class competitor in 
one of the world's toughest sports, then, well, you probably still wouldn't 
want to. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what makes me do so well," McCarthy said. "I guess I'll just keep 
doing what I've been doing."

L. A. BREAKERS PURSUE THIRD CONSECUTIVE DWARF ATHLETIC ASSN. BASKETBALL 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
</P>

<P>
Los Angeles basketball fans, take heart! Three-peat is alive and still 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
OK, so it's not the Los Angeles Lakers who remain in contention for a third 
consecutive title. It's the Los Angeles Breakers. 
</P>
<P>
It's not the NBA, but the DAAA. 
</P>
<P>
It's not a league for 7-footers, but an under-5-feet league. 
</P>
<P>
Don't sell these guys short. The games of the Dwarf Athletic Assn. of America 
can be just as intense, exciting and inspiring as anything seen at a higher 
level. 
</P>
<P>
The Breakers, winners of the gold medal in the past two DAAA National Dwarf 
Games, have spent 14 weeks preparing to defend their title this weekend in 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
"The Lakers couldn't do it," said Joseph Griffo of Burbank, the team's 4-foot-4 
swingman, "but we will. We are just like an NCAA team or any other team 
competing at its own level. We get so psyched." 
</P>
<P>
The co-ed dwarf league makes few allowances for size. The games are played on a 
regular court with a basket set at regulation height. There's even a 
three-point line. The only difference is the basketball. It's the slightly 
smaller one used for women's games at the collegiate level. 
</P>
<P>
"Basketball is basketball," said Lou Black, the Breakers' coach. "With their 
stature, people wonder if they can play on a regulation court. But they are 
very talented. It's just that they've been kept under wraps for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Black, 31, knows good basketball. He played the game at Central State in Ohio. 
Now an area salesman of electronic equipment, Black came to a Breaker practice 
four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
And never left. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really something," he said. "I have learned as much from them as they 
have learned from me. They know all the fundamentals. They can rebound. They 
can shoot the three-pointers. They can run the fast break. They have awed 
people. But you really have to see it to believe it. 
</P>
<P>
"When I tell people I coach a basketball team of dwarfs, they look at me 
strange and scratch their heads," he continued. "It hasn't sunk in yet what 
these people can do, but they're on the horizon. People have been calling me 
from all across the country this week asking, can we do it?" 
</P>
<P>
Team members (nine men and three women) range in height from 3-foot-6 to 
4-foot-9. 
</P>
<P>
No, the center on this squad is not known as The Little Fella, but the Breakers 
do have a pair they refer to as their Twin Towers -- Eric Heslington and Scott 
Danberg, each 4-foot-5. 
</P>
<P>
"Eric is one of the best point guards I've ever seen," Black said, "other than 
Magic Johnson. Eric sees everybody on the court. He sets them up and he can 
score." 
</P>
<P>
Basketball is not the only sport at the fourth edition of Dwarf Games. 
Competition also is held in track and field, power lifting, swimming, table 
tennis and golf. There is also competition for juniors (15 and under) and 
masters (40 and over). About 100 athletes participated in the last Dwarf Games. 
</P>
<P>
Griffo not only played for the gold medal winners in basketball last year but 
also was part of the unit that won the 400-meter relay in a time of 1 minute, 
6.4 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
For Griffo, 37, such national competition is a big step up from his younger 
days when his biggest struggles came from just trying to get on a field. Any 
field. 
</P>
<P>
Born into a family where everyone else was of normal size (his twin sister 
Janice is 5-foot-1), Griffo determined at an early age that he was going to 
take part in the normal activities of his peers. He played Little League but 
found the obstacles growing bigger when he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
In high school, in the San Gabriel Valley, he made the B football team as a 
middle guard. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, the other players thought, 'Let's take it easy on this guy,' " 
Griffo said. "But once they saw me go through the line, saw that I could cause 
havoc, they realized I was for real. I used my quickness and my strength to get 
me in there. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure the other guys were taller and stronger, but I was going to go in and try 
my best even if I got kicked on my butt. Which I often did." 
</P>
<P>
Griffo also made the high school baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
"They never let me play," he said. "They just used me as a pinch-hitter. I was 
told, 'Don't swing the bat. Just go up there and walk.' " 
</P>
<P>
It was in soccer that Griffo had his greatest success. 
</P>
<P>
"The coach didn't care what size I was," he said. "I was able to play on the 
wing because I was quicker than the other players." 
</P>
<P>
And now he has the Breakers. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel like we are really breaking ground," Griffo said. "Considering our 
difficulties, we feel we have come a long way. But we wish we could go 
further." 
</P>
<P>
There are plans to do just that. Griffo would like to compete in the World 
Games in the Netherlands in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
He hopes to compete in the Paralympic Games in Barcelona, Spain, in 1992, the 
athletic event for the disabled that follows the regular Olympics. Dwarfs took 
part for the first time in last year's Paralympics in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually, we hope to have our own Olympics, a Dwarf Olympics," Griffo said, 
"like the Special Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
None of this is cheap. In order to meet the expense of traveling and competing, 
Griffo has set up a fund through the United States Organization for Disabled 
Athletes. 
</P>
<P>
He also has a full-time job as an actor and stunt man. He has done commercials, 
appeared on television shows such as "9 to 5" and "Hardcastle &amp; McCormick," 
and recently completed a role as one of the Mario Brothers on a new kids' show. 
</P>
<P>
Griffo's wife Cindy, 3-foot-11, is also a member of the Breakers and also makes 
her living in front of the cameras. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to sometime play ourselves," Joseph said of acting, "rather than 
what we usually play, which is a puppet, an alien or a chipmunk. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to show people our family, show them that we are equal to them, 
that we can have babies, work or be athletes." 
</P>
<P>
The Griffos have been married for three years and hope to eventually have 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a 50-50 chance," Joseph said, "that our kids would be dwarfs." 
</P>
<P>
But first there is this matter of the three-peat. Black has no doubt his team 
will be successful. 
</P>
<P>
"We are building a dynasty," he declared.

OPTION PASS GIVES BURBANK 19-19 TIE; 
</P>
<P>
HALFBACK CARDENAZ'S PLAY WITH 4:46 LEFT DEPRIVES GLENDALE OF ALL-STAR VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
There were a lot of unhappy sisters after Saturday night's football game 
between the Burbank-area and Glendale-area all-star teams at Burroughs High. 
</P>
<P>
After all, who wants to kiss a brother who has just sweated his way to a 19-19 
tie? Burbank scored the tying touchdown with 4:46 left on a six-yard halfback 
option pass from Tarin Cardenaz to Tom Kilby on fourth down. Sam Cooper of 
Harvard missed the point-after try that could have produced a victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't even practice that," Burbank Coach Randy Stage of the game-tying 
play. "Cardenaz and (quarterback) Anthony Valento just executed the play." 
</P>
<P>
The halfback option was not the only trick play Stage had up his sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank opened the game with an unexpectedly short, lofted kickoff, and Mike 
Ant recovered the ensuing Glendale fumble on the Burbank 40. 
</P>
<P>
On Burbank's first play from scrimmage, quarterback Marco Arcipreste spotted 
Burroughs teammate Steve Hubbell streaking toward the left hash mark on a curl 
and hit him for a 40-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale struck back with the bull rushes of fullback Rafik Thorossian -- who 
had 58 yards on the ground in the first half and was named the game's offensive 
most valuable player -- and quarterback Sid Oxford's passing. 
</P>
<P>
Thorossian capped a 64-yard drive with a two-yard touchdown plunge that tied 
the score, 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
The game then turned into a punting duel before Glendale's Danny Hernandez 
hauled in a punt on his own 17 late in the second period and juked and weaved 
his way 77 yards before being tugged down from behind at the six. 
</P>
<P>
Oxford ducked into the end zone from the a yard out two plays later for the 
touchdown, giving Glendale a 13-7 lead with 4:25 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive MVP Dan Shaw of Burbank closed out the first-half scoring when he 
intercepted a pass by Steve Solano and sped 57 yards to a touchdown with two 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
A pass on a two-point conversion attempt fell incomplete and the teams ended 
the first half deadlocked, 13-13. 
</P>
<P>
Solano had a measure of revenge, though, as he hit tight end Greg Thompson with 
an eight-yard touchdown pass with 8:19 remaining in the third quarter to put 
Glendale ahead, 19-13. 
</P>
<P>
It looked like Glendale's lead might hold up before Burbank pulled off its 
last-gasp touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
"They worked," Stage said of the trick plays. "I expected our players to 
execute and that's what we tried to do. I was proud of them. I'm impressed with 
the quality of players." 
</P>
<P>
The game was relatively well-played even though most of the players had not 
been on a football field for nearly six months. Both teams contributed to a 
rash of fumbles and both turned in strong defensive efforts in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale's defensive front recorded several key sacks in the late going and the 
strong defensive play was somewhat surprising considering linebacker and 
secondary blitzes were outlawed and the teams were restricted to one defensive 
alignment, the standard 5-2 set.

<P>
A full day of soccer activities will be capped off today when the Los Angeles 
Heat meet the San Francisco Bay Blackhawks at West Torrance High School's 
Warrior Stadium in a matchup of the two highest scoring teams in the Western 
Soccer League. 
</P>
<P>
The Heat (8-4), the WSL's highest-scoring team with 31 goals, are led by 
forward Jeff Hooker. Hooker scored the quickest goal in WSL history last 
weekend when he scored in the 28th second against Real Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Hooker's seven goals and five assists give him 19 points, one shy of Brent 
Goulet's 1986 WSL season record. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackhawks (7-3), the WSL Northern Division leaders, are seven goals behind 
the Heat in the WSL scoring derby. San Francisco Bay is led by forward Steve 
Corpening (seven goals, one assist), former Chinese national team member 
Townsend Qin, and World Cup players John Doyle and George Pastor. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackhawks defeated the Heat, 3-1, in the league opener April 22. 
</P>
<P>
Kickoff time today is scheduled for 7:30 p.m., and the game will be followed by 
fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
The Heat will also celebrate the Hawthorne-based American Youth Soccer 
Organization's 25th anniversary by giving a series of soccer clinics for AYSO 
youths beginning at 3:30 p.m. World Cup players will be on hand for autographs 
after the clinics and before the game. STUART MATTHEWS

SCHAPERS CHOPPED UP BY CHANG

<P>
Is it about time to start taking Michael Chang seriously at Wimbledon? Wasn't 
he supposed to be getting severe grass burns or something? 
</P>
<P>
Although seeded ninth, Chang was not expected to reach the fourth round, which 
he managed on a gray Saturday when he finished the first week of Wimbledon as 
one of 16 players left in the men's singles draw. 
</P>
<P>
This doesn't necessarily mean Chang is one of the world's 16 best grass-court 
players any more than are fellow survivors Paul Chamberlin and Leif Shiras. 
</P>
<P>
Chang seems as surprised as anyone that he has done so well. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes you really have strange upsets, and people wonder why," Chang said. 
</P>
<P>
He gave up 10 inches and acres of grass-court experience to Michiel Schapers of 
the Netherlands. He spotted Schapers a 5-1 lead in the third set, then sped 
away with the match as though he were chasing down a volley. 
</P>
<P>
Chang did that plenty of times, too. He tracked balls as if he had seen them on 
radar, and collected an unexpected 4-6, 6-3, 7-5, 7-5 victory. 
</P>
<P>
He really can't win this thing, can he? 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be a surprise for everybody -- including myself," Chang said. 
"But I'm just going to try my best. And if I do, great." 
</P>
<P>
Next up for Chang is Tim Mayotte, also an experienced grass-court player, who 
said he may be just the guy for the job. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody is going to have to break that spirit," the eighth-seeded Mayotte 
said. "I'm really excited to go out there and play." 
</P>
<P>
The sixth day at Wimbledon was the first without rain, but other than that, 
everything went according to form. 
</P>
<P>
John McEnroe moved into the fourth round with an easy, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2, victory 
over Jim Pugh of Palos Verdes and Monday will play John Fitzgerald of Australia 
next. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe and Chang would meet in the semifinals, if they get that far. Defending 
champion Stefan Edberg of Sweden, who might play Chang in the quarterfinals, 
eased past Scott Davis of Largo, Fla., 6-3, 6-4, 4-6, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
But while McEnroe and Edberg were expected to advance this far, Chang's 
presence is surprising. 
</P>
<P>
Schapers, 29, is a fast-court specialist who reached the Australian Open 
quarterfinals in 1985 and 1988. A victory over clay-court devotee Andres Gomez 
of Ecuador in the second round seemed like good preparation for the Chang 
match. 
</P>
<P>
But not many are playing like Chang these days. Schapers' twisting serves got 
him 4-0 and 5-1 leads in the third set. Chang, who had little trouble solving 
Schapers' service in the second set, suddenly lost it, then found it again. 
</P>
<P>
He won the next five games and broke Schapers three times to win the set. 
</P>
<P>
"I was lucky to pull that set out," Chang said. 
</P>
<P>
There have been a lot of 1-5s in his life and some when he has been on the 
other end. So it was a long time ago that Chang learned how to deal with 
adversity. Someone else taught it to him. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes you don't always pull it out, but you always try because you know 
that there's a thought of always coming back," Chang said. 
</P>
<P>
"And for me, probably the match that stays most in my mind -- not me coming 
back, but the person I played -- I was playing Mark Rehe in a sectional 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the first round, and I was up, 5-2, in both sets and I ended up losing, 
7-6, 7-6. So that match is always going to be in my mind to always let me know 
that no matter how far you're down . . . maybe something will click." 
</P>
<P>
Chang said he was 11 when he played that junior match. 
</P>
<P>
Now, of course, he is an experienced 17 and ranked No. 6 in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Chang traded service breaks with Schapers, who served at 5-6 in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Chang maneuvered Schapers to 15-40 and won on the first match point when a 
forehand volley landed in the net. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, Chang won with his tactic of occasionally attacking, usually when 
the ball falls short. A longshot before the tournament, Chang finds the odds on 
him are now getting shorter. 
</P>
<P>
"I think anybody has a good shot at it," Chang said. "For me, being in the 
round of 16 at the French, I didn't think I could win it. 
</P>
<P>
"But . . . people play better in the big tournaments. And I think that on a 
given day, on any given day . . ." 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe hopes his day is coming. McEnroe, the last U.S. man to win Wimbledon, 
five years ago, assessed his own chances. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I'm still here," he said. "I feel like my game is improving and I like 
my chances." 
</P>
<P>
As long as McEnroe and Chang continue winning, their paths could cross. And 
that brings up the potential for some air-conditioning, McEnroe style. 
</P>
<P>
The day after Chang won the French Open, McEnroe said he would drop his pants 
on Centre Court if Chang reached the Wimbledon final. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not worried that I'm going to drop my pants," McEnroe said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not surprised, the players he's played, that he's still in the 
tournament," McEnroe said. "But I'm not holding my breath about dropping my 
pants yet. I'll be worried on Friday if he's still in the semis." 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
A death threat against John McEnroe was received before he played his 
third-round singles match against Jim Pugh on Centre Court, police said. 
McEnroe was not told about the threat until after he had completed play in 
singles and doubles, according to Sergio Palmieri, his manager. The threat came 
in two anonymous telephone calls to the All England Lawn Club and a third to a 
British newspaper, a police official said. Police said a man with a London 
accent warned: "Don't let John McEnroe go on court today or he will be 
assassinated." 
</P>
<P>
Tim Mayotte's 6-4, 6-1, 6-3, victory was over sore-shouldered David Pate of Las 
Vegas, who had to play two days to defeat Tim Nijssen in the second round. "I 
think his shoulder was hurting so he wasn't serving as hard as he normally 
does," Mayotte said. "That made a big difference because I was able to get a 
crack at every return." . . . The marathon match of the week was between two 
Americans. Greg Holmes of Salt Lake City defeated Todd Witsken of Carmel, Ind., 
5-7, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5), 4-6, 14-12, in a second-round match that lasted three 
days. Carried over from both Thursday and Friday when it was delayed because of 
rain and darkness, the match resumed Saturday at 9-9 in the fifth set. Total 
match time was 5 hours 28 minutes. Because of the backlog of matches, Holmes 
was forced to play his third-round match only two hours later. Amos Mansdorf of 
Israel beat Holmes, 6-2, 6-4, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
The only players in the men's draw who have not dropped a set are Boris Becker 
of West Germany and Mats Wilander of Sweden. The fourth-seeded Wilander 
defeated 19-year-old Australian Jason Stoltenberg, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3.

CLIPPERS ARE OFF GUARD IN THE DRAFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Clipper ship sails on, still without a coach, still without a solution to 
its No. 1 problem from last season, and with its No. 1 addition for next season 
looking less than thrilled about his destination. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the off-season? 
</P>
<P>
It has been more than two months since the Clippers ended their season, and the 
closest they have come to resolving the uncertain coaching situation is to give 
Don Casey an indefinite extension on the payroll. In other words, he did not 
get set adrift Saturday, when his contract was due to run out, but remains 
aboard as interim coach only. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Donald Sterling has been saying for several weeks that Casey is the 
leading candidate to become head coach. Others within the organization claim he 
is the only candidate. Still, the issue drags on. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers have known since Jan. 19, when Casey replaced Gene Shue, that a 
coach would have to be hired. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe they want to see how the Clippers perform in summer league games under 
Casey, the clear choice of the players for the job. Maybe exhibition games will 
serve as the final determination. 
</P>
<P>
Casey says he has no light to shed on the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"I've said everything there is to say," he said. "I don't think I need to 
comment any further. We're just looking forward to seeing Danny Ferry come in 
and join the team, along with the other rookies." 
</P>
<P>
But is Danny Ferry, the club's top draftee, looking forward to it? 
</P>
<P>
By several indications, he is not the happiest millionaire-to-be the National 
Basketball Assn. has ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
USA Today reported Thursday that Bob Ferry, the Washington Bullets' general 
manager, spent draft night trying to soothe his son, who didn't understand why 
the Clippers would pick him when they already have Ken Norman and Charles Smith 
as starting forwards and Danny Manning -- provided he returns from knee surgery 
-- and Joe Wolf in the wings. 
</P>
<P>
In the several days since, Ferry has not returned phone calls to reporters in 
Los Angeles, and the normally obligatory visit to town for top draft choices 
has yet to materialize. 
</P>
<P>
Ferry seems as puzzled by his selection as were the fans at the Sports Arena 
who booed it. Few doubt Ferry's potential or that he was, if Sean Elliott 
really has knee problems, the best player available in the draft. But where 
will his playing time come from? Norman and Smith have a combined three years 
of service and already are the foundation, and that's not even taking Manning 
into consideration. 
</P>
<P>
With the No. 2 pick in the draft, the Clippers, a team that won 21 games last 
season, went for a reserve. With No. 26, next-to-last in the first round, the 
Lakers got a probable starting center, Vlade Divac. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, it was a tough decision for the Clippers. General Manager Elgin 
Baylor claims that Ferry was the player he wanted all along, suggesting that 
reports the Duke All-American would have trouble fitting into a forward-heavy 
team were merely a smoke screen. 
</P>
<P>
If so, he took it to extremes. Miami Heat co-owner Billy Cunningham called 
Baylor 30 minutes before the draft, having already heard that the Sacramento 
Kings would take Pervis Ellison first and hoping to find out the Clipper 
selection in advance so that the Heat would know what to expect at No. 4. 
Baylor told Cunningham he didn't know. 
</P>
<P>
The Heat ended up with Glen Rice, who will probably play small forward in 
Miami. Rice would have been a shooting guard with the Clippers, their foremost 
weakness. They needed a shooter and passed on the best in the draft, instead 
waiting until the second round to select Jeff Martin of Murray State and Jay 
Edwards of Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-7 Rice tested so well at a pre-draft individual workout in Miami 
that Heat officials were bubbling. In one test, he touched 12-4 on the 
backboard with a running start, compared to 12-1 by the 6-9 Ellison. In 
another, they had Rice stand near the baseline and keep shooting and backing up 
until he couldn't hit consistently. 
</P>
<P>
They stopped the drill when he was out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
"He's as good a shooter as I've ever seen play basketball," Cunningham, who 
played 11 years in the NBA and American Basketball Assn. and coached the 
Philadelphia 76ers to three NBA finals, told Miami reporters. 
</P>
<P>
There has already been speculation around the league that Ferry, or one of the 
other forwards, will be traded, and Baylor does not discount that possibility. 
But this was not a pick for trade bait, so, depending on the recovery of the 
No. 1 pick a year removed, it could be Norman, Smith, Ferry, Wolf and Danny 
Manning lining up for playing time. 
</P>
<P>
Decisions, however, will need to be made on several other fronts. 
</P>
<P>
CENTER -- The Clippers will undoubtedly match any offer sheet tendered to 
Benoit Benjamin, a restricted free agent as of Saturday. Benjamin has yet to 
pick an agent to replace Larry Fleisher, who died in May, so another question 
is whether teams will be negotiating with Don King, which remains a 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Bannister, originally brought in last season from the Continental 
Basketball Assn. on a 10-day contract, Saturday was offered a pact for 1989-90 
and is the backup. One of Ferry's appeals is that he could also play center. 
</P>
<P>
POINT GUARD -- No decisions here. Gary Grant, the second-year player from 
Michigan, was erratic in his first few months as a pro, but he won over all 
doubters with his play down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Garrick, a second-round pick last season, seems to have stuck for good. His 
intensity and play on defense earned him a spot as a rookie, but the Clippers 
want him to work on ball-handling in hope of making him Grant's backup. 
</P>
<P>
SHOOTING GUARD -- Still up in the air, as it was going into training camp last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Williams, a former No. 4 pick, will begin his third season still trying 
to live up to his billing, or at least become a role player without becoming 
insubordinate, as when he refused to enter a game last season. He has been 
working with weights during the off-season and the starting job will probably 
be his to lose. 
</P>
<P>
The decision Saturday to not exercise the option on veteran Quintin Dailey 
makes him a free agent and also leaves Williams as the front-runner for the 
spot. It also means the Clippers have let go the person who started more games 
than any other guard and averaged 16.1 points, something of a gamble in light 
of the largely unproven talent available. 
</P>
<P>
If Martin, projected by some as a late first-round pick, or Edwards do anything 
early in the season, either could become the starter. In that case, the 
Clippers would have landed the shooter in the draft, after all.

ANGELS SLUG OUT ANOTHER INDOOR WIN OVER TWINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MINNEAPOLIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's been said that you can't carry offensive momentum from game to game, but 
for the third night in a row, the Angels failed to notice when batting practice 
ended and the game began. 
</P>
<P>
Led by left fielder Chili Davis with two prodigious homers, the Angels pounded 
the Twins into submission again Saturday night before a crowd of 28,682 at the 
Metrodome. The final score was 6-1, but with three home runs, a 410-foot triple 
and three fly-ball outs that put Twin outfielders against the wall, it seemed 
like more of a rout. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels scored in every inning except the third, eighth and ninth. Tony 
Armas hit his second home run in as many nights; Devon White had two runs 
batted in and that triple off the top of the center-field fence, and Wally 
Joyner chipped in with three singles and an RBI. 
</P>
<P>
For the fifth time in his career, Davis had home runs as both a left-handed and 
right-handed hitter in the same game. Mickey Mantle, the all-time leader, did 
it 10 times. Davis came a foot or so short of having his first three-homer game 
when he sent center fielder Kirby Puckett to the wall to snag his drive in the 
second inning. 
</P>
<P>
"It was nice, but it would've been nicer to see that first one go over too," 
Davis said. "Hitters are greedy. You're always thinking about the one that got 
away. You never seem to have a good enough night." 
</P>
<P>
On this evening, however, Davis was good enough to propel the Angels to their 
seventh victory in eight games, keeping them just a half-game behind the 
American League West-leading Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
"They pay me a whole lot of money to do that," Davis said. "They don't pay me 
to steal bases and they don't pay me to play awesome defense, 'cause I don't. 
I've got one stolen base and zero triples. I've got to drive in runs and hit 
the ball out of the park." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who has six hits in his last 11 at-bats with five RBIs, leads the team 
in homers with 11 and RBIs with 40 but isn't satisfied with his performance of 
late. 
</P>
<P>
"Some guys say you've got to have fun in this game, but there ain't no fun 
unless you're doing well," Davis said. "I've been waking up mad and I smile 
only when something is really funny. I just stay angry inside and try to take 
it up to the batter's box with me." 
</P>
<P>
Davis did manage a grin or two after this one, as did Angel starter Kirk 
McCaskill. But McCaskill (9-4) seemed to be smiling more out of relief than 
anything else. He lowered his earned-run average to 2.86, but he almost didn't 
make it out of the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
The first four Twin batters got hits -- although none were as awe-inspiring as 
many of the Angel outs on this evening -- but McCaskill squirmed out of the 
inning with just a one-run deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Bush led off with a sharp single to right field. Wally Backman followed 
with a bunt single. Puckett blooped a single to center to load the bases. Then 
Kent Hrbek dumped a run-scoring flare into right. 
</P>
<P>
But McCaskill regrouped and struck out Gary Gaetti before getting designated 
hitter Jim Dwyer to hit one back to the pitcher. McCaskill threw to catcher 
Lance Parrish, who fired to first to complete the double play. 
</P>
<P>
The Twins collected six more hits after that but didn't push a runner as far as 
third base until the ninth, when Bryan Harvey was on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I made some pretty good pitches in the first," McCaskill said. "I 
tried not to panic, figuring if I kept making pretty good pitches, something 
good might happen . . . and it did. 
</P>
<P>
"You try hard not to think, 'Oh no, it's going to be one of those days,' but 
it's important not to. Today, I managed to keep pretty level-headed, and it 
paid off. We kept notching runs, and that allowed me to relax." 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill is one of three Angel pitchers -- along with Chuck Finley (9-6) and 
Bert Blyleven (7-2) -- who merit All-Star consideration, but McCaskill says he 
"doesn't deserve" to make the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I got off to a good start, but I haven't pitched that well recently," he said. 
"I think Chuck and Bert deserve it more, not necessarily in that order. In my 
opinion, those are the two guys to choose from. It'd be an honor to make it 
someday, but I don't think I have a chance." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Manager Doug Rader said he hopes that "at least one pitcher and one 
player" from his team will be on the American League squad in the All-Star game 
at Anaheim Stadium July 11, but just about everybody with a halo on his cap 
seems more concerned with staying on the heels of the Athletics these days. 
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is we won and kept pace with Oakland," Davis said. "I hope 
somebody beats them and gives us some help. I'd hate for it to be just up to 
us. I'd like us to be like a good distance-runner: Get ahead and never look 
back." 
</P>
<P>
A few more games under the Metrodome wouldn't hurt the Angels. They used to 
think of this ballpark as the not-so-great indoors, but they've averaged 14 
hits and eight runs a game here this season. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Umpire Dan Morrison was ill, leaving a three-man crew to call the game. John 
Shulock worked behind the plate, Tim Welke at first base and Jim Evans at 
third. Welke was scheduled to work at second and Morrison at first. Morrison 
also will miss today's game. The nature of the illness was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
The mysterious case of Claudell Washington's infected left shin has taken yet 
another bizarre twist, and Manager Doug Rader is beginning to lose patience 
with the medical community's inability to figure out exactly what's wrong. 
Washington took extra batting practice Friday and said he felt fine. Then he 
played 4 1/2 innings Friday night and the shin began to swell and hurt again. 
Washington left during Saturday night's game to return home and will be 
admitted to Centinela Hospital Medical Center today for further diagnostic 
tests. "If we knew specifically what it was, we could treat it and get it over 
with," Rader said, "but we can't get a unified opinion." 
</P>
<P>
The infection was originally believed to have been caused by insect bites and 
was diagnosed by Angel dermatologist Ron Cotliar as cellulitis (an infection of 
cellular or connective tissue). Then Cleveland's team physician, John Bergfeld, 
diagnosed the condition as hives early this week. "Then Claudell's wife called 
and said the kids had contracted poision oak," trainer Rick Smith said. "He had 
been rolling around, playing with the kids before we left. It's been like a 
roller coaster. He felt as good as new (Friday). He said he was ready to go 
with no hesitation when we asked if he could go in the game and then it was 
swollen again after the game." 
</P>
<P>
Rader is worried about the durability of Washington's replacement, Tony Armas. 
Armas has already spent 65 days on the disabled list this season with a 
sprained hamstring and left Friday's game when he felt tightening in his right 
buttock. "We have to be careful with him," Rader said. "He's not in the 
greatest of shape and it's not fair to ask him to take over the entire 
workload. I'll have to think out (today's) lineup really carefully. I don't 
want to get greedy at Tony's expense." Armas' legs may be questionable, but 
there's no doubt about his ability to swing the bat. He hit his second homer in 
as many games Saturday night and added a single, extending his hitting streak 
to 12 games. . . . Jack Howell was hit in the right thigh by a pitch from Roy 
Smith in the eighth inning and left the game but should be available today. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim Stadium ticket office will be open from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. today, 
selling general admission tickets on reserved-seat basis for the July 4 game 
against the Texas Rangers and postgame fireworks show. Tickets are also 
available for Wednesday's matchup between Texas' Nolan Ryan and Finley.

DODGERS FOLLOW BOUNCING BALL AND WIN, 1-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jose Gonzalez hit a sinking line drive toward second baseman Jose Lind, as 
straight as the Dodger season has been long. Lind opened his glove and prepared 
to make the play that would send this scoreless game into extra innings. 
</P>
<P>
But as the ball bounced, it struck something. The Pittsburgh Pirates will tell 
you it just hit a bad spot on a terribly hard infield. The Dodgers prefer to 
think of it as a tiny chunk of justice. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez's ball shot up, hit Lind in the shoulder and ricocheted into 
right-center field as Eddie Murray scored from second base to give the Dodgers 
a 1-0 victory Saturday before a crowd of 33,692 at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Call it a red-letter win. As Murray sprinted across the plate, as Mike Marshall 
rounded second base with his fists pumping, as Gonzalez reached first with his 
hands clapping, Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda said he could only think of the 
calendar. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as that ball got past the second baseman, I said, 'It's July now," 
Lasorda said. "I said, 'June is over, it's time for July.' " 
</P>
<P>
For the Dodgers, who had a 12-17 record in June, ending the month with five 
consecutive losses and in fifth place, Saturday's game indeed represented a new 
start. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall was in right field for the first time after missing all of June with 
lower back problems. He responded with one of the game's biggest at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Belcher was on the mound for the first time since his dugout confrontation 
with umpire Ed Montague early Wednesday morning. He responded with a scoreless 
inning of relief for the win. 
</P>
<P>
And back, too, was the Dodger good fortune that had so abruptly abandoned them 
sometime after last Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
"Today was just one game, and we can't get too excited, but . . . " said 
catcher Rick Dempsey, who threw out two would-be base-stealers in a rare start. 
"We all know we've had more than enough opportunity to win every game we've 
lost. Maybe this is the start of taking advantage of those opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
Said coach Joe Ferguson: "Days like today make you believe the world really 
isn't coming to an end." 
</P>
<P>
After Dodger starter Tim Leary had held the Pirates to four singles in eight 
innings, and after the Dodgers had blown what few chances they had against 
Pirate starter John Smiley, the game came down to the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Gibson started the Dodger half by striking out against Smiley, leaving him 
with five hits in his last 50 at-bats, but Murray followed with a single to 
center field. Up stepped Marshall, who had gone 0 for 3 and looked as impatient 
as a man who hasn't played in a month. 
</P>
<P>
After knocking two foul balls down the left-field line, he settled in to watch 
two close pitches that were balls. 
</P>
<P>
"And then I started thinking about a walk," said Marshall, who earlier in the 
day had beenactivated from the 21-day disabled list, replacing Mariano Duncan, 
who was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a sore left hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
"I've played so much baseball in my life, I've seen so much pitching, even 
though I haven't played in a while, it came back quick," Marshall said. "He 
missed on a couple of close pitches, and I thought if I waited him out, I might 
get on." 
</P>
<P>
Two pitches later, with a full count, Marshall indeed walked. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Hamilton then popped up for the second out, bringing up Gonzalez, who 
earlier had been denied an extra-base hit when Barry Bonds made a diving catch 
of his third-inning line drive. This time, Gonzalez wasn't going to be denied. 
On the first two pitches, he swung for the fences. Both pitches were high and 
away. He missed them both. 
</P>
<P>
From the dugout, Lasorda was shouting for Gonzalez just to put the ball in 
play. Gonzalez finally heard. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell myself to relax," Gonzalez said, and on the next pitch he used a nice, 
easy swing to rap the ball toward Lind. 
</P>
<P>
It was a lucky break for the Dodgers for two reasons. If the ball is caught or 
fielded successfully, the game goes into extra innings. If the ball merely goes 
through for a single, the game also likely goes into extra innings, as center 
fielder Andy Van Slyke possesses one of baseball's best arms and could have 
easily made a play on Murray at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I was cheering when the ball hit the ground and hit (Lind)," said 
Marshall, who was running just ahead of the hit. "That was the only way we had 
a chance." 
</P>
<P>
Later, the Pirate coaches weren't cheering the hard Dodger Stadium infield that 
caused thebounce. 
</P>
<P>
"Beautiful ballpark, rotten infield," pitching coach Ray Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Added infielders coach Tommy Sandt: "It's no major league infield. It's like 
concrete. It's worse than AstroTurf." 
</P>
<P>
All of which made little difference to Leary, who improved his earned-run 
average to 2.89, even though his record remained 6-5. Even happier Saturday was 
Belcher, who improved to 5-8 with a 3.25 ERA after making his fourth relief 
appearance since his transfer from the starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
And how about the fact that for only the 19th time this season, Gibson, Murray 
and Marshall were in the same starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers have won just eight of those 19 games when all three played, but 
during those games, the trio combined to hit .282, an average better than any 
of them currently have individually. In the 19 games they also combined for six 
home runs and 32 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to realize we have a lot of talent on this club," Ferguson said of 
his team, which moved within 8 1/2 games of the first-place San Francisco 
Giants. "Now we'll see what happens when all of it is put together." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
The return of Mike Marshall and the emergence of Jose Gonzalez has moved 
outfielder Mickey Hatcher, who has been starting against left-handed pitching, 
to the end of the bench. And Hatcher, who didn't bat against left-hander John 
Smiley Saturday despite a .307 average, isn't happy about it. "They are 
treating me like an old broken-down ballplayer, and I don't appreciate it," 
said Hatcher, 34, one of last season's World Series heroes. "It would be 
different if we were tearing the cover off the ball. But we aren't. That's what 
makes it so frustrating and hard to watch, when I know I could be making a 
difference. I will play when I am told, I will do what I am told, but I don't 
like it." 
</P>
<P>
In moving Mariano Duncan to the 15-day disabled list, the Dodgers had to switch 
Chris Gwynn (stress fracture in his foot) from the 15-day list to the 21-day 
disabled list, as a team can only have two players on the 15-day list at the 
same time. Tracy Woodson is already on the disabled list with a strained leg 
muscle and is due back in the middle of next week, sooner than Gwynn, who 
thinks he still could be a couple of weeks away. "Some days I wake up and it's 
improving, other days it's regressing," he said of the fracture. "To guess when 
I would come back is still a stab in the dark." For Duncan, this is his second 
stint on the disabled list this season, as he missed 15 days in early June with 
an injured right hand.

Calvin Smith spoiled Carl Lewis' 28th birthday by defeating the Olympic 
champion in the 100 meters, and Abdi Bile ended Steve Cram's Dream Mile winning 
streak at the Bislett Games in Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, a former world record-holder and bronze medalist in the 1988 Seoul 
Olympics, won in 10.05 seconds. That broke the Bislett Stadium record of 10.19 
that Lewis set eight years ago. Lewis, running the 100 for only the third time 
this season, was second in 10.11. 
</P>
<P>
Bile, the Somalian who won the 1,500 in the 1987 World Championships, won in 
3:49.90 with a kick in the last 50 meters. Cram, who started his streak in 1985 
when he set the world record of 3:46.32, was fourth in 3:51.58. 
</P>
<P>
Ingrid Kristiansen posted the third-fastest time ever in the women's 10,000. 
The Norwegian, who set world records here in 1985 and 1986, was clocked in 
30:48.51, almost 35 seconds slower than her world mark. 
</P>
<P>
Other 1989 world bests were in the 800 by Johnny Gray of the United States, 
1:43.39; in the 3,000 by Said Aouita of Morocco, 7:34.79; in the shotput by Ulf 
Timmermann of East Germany, 71 feet 11 1/2 inches, and in the pole vault by 
Rodion Gataullin of the Soviet Union, 19-4 1/2.

USA VOLLEYBALL CUP; 
</P>
<P>
KIRALY, TIMMONS GO WITH A BANG; U.S. ROUTS SOVIETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The final point went down Saturday night, and suddenly Karch Kiraly and Steve 
Timmons were former members of the U.S. national volleyball team, on their way 
to becoming full-time members of the beach volleyball tour. 
</P>
<P>
"All the guys came up to me and said, 'Congratulations,' and, 'It was fun 
playing with you,' " Timmons said after the United States won its sixth 
consecutive USA Cup with a 15-9, 15-9, 15-5 victory over the Soviet Union at 
the Forum, an event that was overshadowed by the retirement of two of the 
greatest players in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"Time slowed down a bit," Timmons said. "It was, 'Hey, that's it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Fittingly, the night belonged to Kiraly and Timmons on the court, too, showing 
why many say they are leaving while playing the best volleyball of their 
careers. 
</P>
<P>
But they are leaving nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's hit me yet," said Kiraly, who, like Timmons, will be 
competing in the Manhattan Beach Open beginning Monday. "It hit me the most 
when I sat down for the (pre-match) ceremony. But it was just business as 
usual. One more win." 
</P>
<P>
It was the Americans' 19th consecutive victory over the Soviet Union in the 
United States, only the latest episode in U.S. domination of the No. 2 team in 
the world, which also includes a win in the gold-medal match of the 1988 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Steadied by the return of Jeff Stork, the No. 1 setter who missed Friday's 
victory over South Korea because of a shoulder injury, the United States 
controlled the match from the outset. 
</P>
<P>
The first game included a 9-1 run by the Americans, who came in having won all 
five outings against the Soviet Union during a tour that preceded the USA Cup, 
three requiring no more than four games. 
</P>
<P>
Timmons, in particular, was dominant as hitter, wasting few opportunities to 
drill the ball to the floor in the middle of the Soviet defense. When the 
visitors had a chance to close the gap in the second game, trailing only 3-5, 
they hurt themselves more than the Americans with mistimed passes and errant 
spike attempts. The U.S. quickly built the lead to 8-3 and gave up little 
momentum the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-minute pre-match festivities to honor Kiraly and Timmons included a 
standing ovation, a pair of round-trip tickets for two to Hawaii from the 
Forum, speeches, plaques, and gifts from the three other teams in the 
round-robin tournament. Among the hardware were two joint resolutions from 
state legislators reciting their accomplishments through the years, a nice 
touch even if Kiraly's did mention his career at USC, a mixup the former Bruin 
no doubt could have done without. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that so many friends and family were on hand, Timmons, who did attend 
USC, motioned toward his fiancee, Jeanie Buss. 
</P>
<P>
"Jeanie," he said, "we could just get married now." 
</P>
<P>
That will wait until November. 
</P>
<P>
For Timmons and Kiraly, more volleyball is the next order of business. 
</P>
<P>
Brazil won the consolation title with a 15-9, 13-15, 15-6, 15-12 victory over 
South Korea.

MORNING BRIEFING: PHILLIE RELIEVER HAS SUBMARINE DELIVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Philadelphia reliever Greg Harris has a special glove because he can throw with 
either hand. Pittsburgh outfielder Andy Van Slyke didn't know that, and he did 
a double take when Harris came into a game against the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
Van Slyke, who was on third, asked third base coach Gene Lamont, "Why does he 
wear a glove like that?" 
</P>
<P>
Phillie third baseman Randy Ready, overhearing the question, said, "Because 
he's amphibious." 
</P>
<P>
Said Van Slyke: "Does that mean he can throw underwater?" 
</P>
<P>
Bright remark: Said umpire Bruce Froemming to a player who complained that a 
play was too far away for Froemming to see it: "The sun is 93 million miles 
away, and I can see it." 
</P>
<P>
Grounded: Moss Klein of the Sporting News reports that the New York Yankees 
have banned all liquor on team flights after a couple of airlines complained of 
rowdyism by the players and threatened to withdraw their charters. 
</P>
<P>
Klein: "A group of players had turned flights into frights for the airlines, 
destroying property, engaging in food fights and upsetting flight attendants." 
</P>
<P>
Said one veteran Yankee: "You walk off the plane and feel embarrassed. There's 
food all over the floor, pats of butter stuck to the ceiling, seats torn out . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What were the real names of Dizzy and Daffy Dean? 
</P>
<P>
A loss at home: Washington Redskins quarterback Doug Williams, who sought to 
have his wife Lisa arrested for stealing a $75,000 check, told the Washington 
Post after she filed for separation: "Lisa's a con artist. She sold me. I 
thought she was apple pie and ice cream until the ice cream melted and the pie 
was cold. 
</P>
<P>
"I had said, 'This girl is exactly what I'm looking for, the kind of 
personality who could deal with people.' But she was a con artist. It's the 
worst sack I've ever had in my life." 
</P>
<P>
Alphabet soup: Bruce Keidan of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, on the latest of 
boxing's title-recognizers, the World Boxing Organization: "The WBO's 
international headquarters is a phone booth outside a candy store in Hoboken. 
Send $10 by check or money order and the WBO will send you your choice of a 
championship boxing belt or a mail-order degree in divinity." 
</P>
<P>
Numbers game: From Bill Sangster, dean of the engineering school and faculty 
athletic representative at Georgia Tech: "Statistics in the hands of an 
engineer are like a lamppost to a drunk. They're used more for support than 
illumination." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Jay Hanna Dean and Paul Dee Dean. Dizzy also went by the name of 
Jerome. 
</P>
<P>
Add Dizzy: Explaining why he gave out three different birthplaces to reporters, 
he said, "I give 'em each a scoop, so their bosses can't bawl the three of 'em 
out for writing the same piece." 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Bob Hope, complaining about his golf game: "Titleist offered me $50 
not to use their balls."

MIKE DOWNEY: TIME TO TAKE A FEW CUTS AT BASEBALL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Can't we all pitch in a few bucks apiece and rent an office where Bart Giamatti 
can do his interviews? Why is this poor man always out on the sidewalk? If the 
commissioner ever ends up giving Pete Rose a hearing, will he be able to hear 
him over all that traffic? 
</P>
<P>
Is it true that Pete Rose went to see "Batman" and bet $2,000 on the Joker? 
</P>
<P>
Wasn't this Rose thing the best thing ever to happen to Wade Boggs? 
</P>
<P>
Who is in charge of writing all those puns at ESPN's "Sportscenter," and how 
much would it cost us to have some friend of Paul Janszen's go over there and 
break his legs? 
</P>
<P>
Isn't there somebody -- anybody -- in San Diego who could force Jack Clark to 
move closer to the plate so he can reach that round thing when it comes flying 
across the outside corner? 
</P>
<P>
Do you ever get the feeling that someday the New York Yankees will trade Don 
Mattingly to the Oakland Athletics for any three players the A's feel like 
giving them that day? 
</P>
<P>
What is that black stuff in Lenny Dykstra's mouth when he bats? Couldn't he 
chew something a little less disgusting, like maybe a pine-tar rag? 
</P>
<P>
Does Ray Fosse wonder now if Pete Rose had a bet on that All-Star game? 
</P>
<P>
Did it ever occur to anybody that maybe Joe Jackson bet his shoes? 
</P>
<P>
Is it really true Bo Jackson didn't want to play baseball in the minors because 
he couldn't break aluminum bats over his head? 
</P>
<P>
Having seen Mickey Tettleton, don't you wonder how fast Ben Johnson might have 
run in the Olympics if the substance he abused was Froot Loops? 
</P>
<P>
Does Tommy Lasorda have to take Diet Rolaids now? Is it true that he coaches 
third base more often now because he finally fits into the coaching box? 
</P>
<P>
How often does a guy have to go to Gold's Gym to end up looking like Pete Rose, 
anyway? 
</P>
<P>
Couldn't we speed up the pace of baseball games with a few new rules? For 
example, whenever Vince Coleman singles or walks, couldn't we just 
automatically give him a double? 
</P>
<P>
How fair is it to let this Gregg Olsen kid from Baltimore throw curves that 
nearly hit the third-base coach on their way to the plate? 
</P>
<P>
Forget Rose, Boggs, Steve Garvey, etc. Wasn't the weirdest thing of the 
baseball season that shampoo commercial in which Orel Hershiser says he takes 
showers four or five times a day? Has any pitcher ever gone to the showers so 
often? How can any man pitch so well with his fingers all pruney and wrinkled? 
</P>
<P>
Did Pete Rose ever bet on how many showers Hershiser took? 
</P>
<P>
Is it possible that the best baseball development in Toronto was the 
retractable manager? 
</P>
<P>
After those trades the Phillies made, don't you figure that Mike Schmidt isn't 
the only person in Philadelphia who has been crying? 
</P>
<P>
Sparky Anderson isn't the only one in Tiger Stadium who's exhausted. Think of 
all those poor visiting players who have to keep running around and around the 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
Did Pete Rose have prior knowledge that the over-under on the condensed version 
of John Dowd's report was only 215 pages? 
</P>
<P>
You know, if Nolan Ryan is going to go out there and give up a hit every time 
he pitches, maybe he ought to think about retiring. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble with the Chicago Cubs, as usual, seems to be those long, hot summer 
nights. 
</P>
<P>
Do you think when CBS does baseball next season, Pat O'Brien and James Brown 
will be reporting from behind the dugouts? 
</P>
<P>
What about that coin flip between Kal Daniels and Marge Schott? Wasn't that 
gambling? 
</P>
<P>
If dead people were put on the All-Star ballot, how many fans would vote for 
them? 
</P>
<P>
What if Jose Canseco turns out to be the All-Star game's MVP? Would anybody 
dare award this man a car? Could somebody make sure it's one that won't go 
faster than 55? 
</P>
<P>
If Pete Rose says somebody can stop on a dime, does he mean a thousand dollars? 
</P>
<P>
The 1980s are almost over. Isn't it about time somebody televised a Texas 
Ranger game? 
</P>
<P>
In April and May, was a Gregg Jefferies trading card worth more than Gregg 
Jefferies? 
</P>
<P>
Latest reports from the minors indicate that Chris Brown will be sidelined for 
four to six weeks with hurt feelings. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't it nice the way people these days are simply referring to "pitcher" Jim 
Abbott? 
</P>
<P>
The first time somebody told me the Chicago White Sox had a Rosenberg on the 
mound, I misunderstood. I thought they meant that white powdered bag the 
pitchers use to dry their hands. 
</P>
<P>
If Pete Rose bet on Montreal or Toronto, did he at least get a decent exchange 
rate? 
</P>
<P>
Might not baseball further discourage gambling by getting rid of those 
scoreboard "guess the attendance" contests? 
</P>
<P>
OK, who's the leading candidate for National League bookie of the year?

CANSECO, SCHMIDT NOT ONLY ALL-STAR VOTING ABSURDITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ross Newhan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just because a retired player leads the National League All-Star voting at 
third base and a player who hasn't appeared in a major league game this year is 
among the American League's top three outfielders doesn't mean there should be 
another appeal to take the vote away from the fans. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, this year's results only border on the annual absurdity produced by 
the paying electorate. 
</P>
<P>
With the voting scheduled to end today and the final week's ballots still to be 
tabulated, the probable results don't appear that far out of line, even with 
the retired Mike Schmidt winning the National League's third base nod and the 
injured Jose Canseco being selected to the American League outfield. 
</P>
<P>
Based on 1989 performance, here's the way it should have gone, with the fan 
leaders in parentheses: 
</P>
<P>
AMERICAN LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
FIRST BASE (Mark McGwire): There is no position with more legitimate 
candidates, including McGwire, Alvin Davis, Don Mattingly, Fred McGriff and 
Rafael Palmeiro. They are virtually impossible to separate, but the nod here 
would be to Mattingly, who has come on in all categories to regain his Hit Man 
identification. 
</P>
<P>
SECOND BASE (Steve Sax): The former Dodger is having a big year, but Julio 
Franco, No. 2 in the voting, is having a bigger year and should have been an 
obvious choice. 
</P>
<P>
SHORTSTOP (Cal Ripken Jr.): No argument. 
</P>
<P>
THIRD BASE (Wade Boggs): Boggs has overcome all the distractions to make 
another run at a batting title, but the pick should have been Gary Gaetti, who 
is among the league leaders in home runs and runs batted in, carrying the 
Minnesota Twins back into the race. 
</P>
<P>
OUTFIELD (Bo Jackson, Kirby Puckett and Canseco): Jackson and Puckett are 
legitimate picks, but Canseco is a joke. Is this the 1988 or 1989 All-Star 
team? It's an insult to Ruben Sierra, who is No. 7 in the voting and should be 
No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
CATCHER (Terry Steinbach): The MVP of last year's All-Star game isn't a bad 
pick, but Mickey Tettleton deserves the edge based on power, production and his 
impact on the Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
PITCHERS: The fans have no voice in the selection of the pitching staff. 
Manager Tony La Russa couldn't go wrong with Dave Stewart, Roger Clemens, Greg 
Swindell, Chuck Finley, Jeff Ballard and relievers Tom Gordon, Jeff Russell and 
Doug Jones. 
</P>
<P>
NATIONAL LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
FIRST BASE (Will Clark): An obvious pick, though Pedro Guerrero is having a 
fine year as well. 
</P>
<P>
SECOND BASE (Ryne Sandberg): No argument here either. 
</P>
<P>
SHORTSTOP (Ozzie Smith): The fans voted without thinking. Barry Larkin is now 
the league's premier shortstop in every way. 
</P>
<P>
THIRD BASE (Schmidt): A nice honor for Schmidt, but this is supposed to be the 
1989 All-Star team. Howard Johnson, sixth in the voting, should be first. 
</P>
<P>
OUTFIELD (Kevin Mitchell, Darryl Strawberry and Tony Gwynn): Mitchell and Gwynn 
are bona fide picks. Strawberry might have been if he hadn't been sidelined 
recently by injuries. The third outfielder should be Vince Coleman or Eric 
Davis, with Davis having compiled legitimate statistics despite ongoing leg 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
CATCHER (Benito Santiago): In a league where no catcher has distinguished 
himself offensively, Tony Pena probably is the half-year All-Star, though 
Santiago has begun to hit some after a horrendous start. 
</P>
<P>
PITCHERS: Manager Tom Lasorda would be wise to select Rick Reuschel, Mike 
Scott, Dennis Martinez, Orel Hershiser and four relievers: John Franco, Mark 
Davis, Mitch Williams and Jay Howell. 
</P>
<P>
Lonnie Smith, having staged a remarkable comeback from the drug problems that 
took him to the minors and threatened his career, had 10 home runs and a .325 
average through Friday and figured to be the Atlanta Braves' All-Star 
representative. 
</P>
<P>
But Smith says he isn't sure he will accept, citing a tender ankle that 
recently put him on the disabled list and his dislike for Lasorda. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't be the first guy not to play for Tommy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Did Pete Rose regularly call other managers to determine the physical status of 
their teams before betting on them, as Paul Janszen testified in baseball's 
investigation into Rose's alleged gambling habits? 
</P>
<P>
Twelve managers contacted by The Times failed to confirm that. "I'm not saying 
that I've never talked to Pete on the phone," said an American League manager 
who requested anonymity. "But it would be highly unusual and suspicious for any 
manager to call another on a regular basis to ask about injuries and the status 
of a pitcher. And Pete never did that, to my knowledge at least. It seems like 
someone has it in for him, on this count anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Texas Rangers coach Davey Lopes, who set a major league record by stealing 38 
consecutive bases without being caught as a Dodger in 1975, wasn't overly 
thrilled to see the St. Louis Cardinals' Vince Coleman break his mark. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman began a weekend series against San Diego with 40 consecutive steals, 34 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I always thought that once a season terminated, it terminated what you had 
accomplished," Lopes said. "They don't carry over batting average and 
earned-run average. I'm sure he could do it in one year and that's the way it 
should be counted." 
</P>
<P>
Lopes also couldn't resist a needle when asked his opinion of Coleman's success 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess he's picking better situations," Lopes said. 
</P>
<P>
Better situations? 
</P>
<P>
"When I stole 47 of 49 (51 really) with the Cubs at age 40, Coleman said anyone 
could do it if they picked the right situations," Lopes said with a smile. "I 
guess he's picking the right situations." 
</P>
<P>
In Coleman's view, no situation is better than another. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone in the park knows I'm going," he said. "I'm going against the whole 
park. I hope I get a hundred in a row." 
</P>
<P>
Montreal Expos Manager Buck Rodgers, in his sixth full season as a major league 
manager, registered his 500th victory Tuesday night and said: 
</P>
<P>
"Five hundred doesn't mean as much to me as having a career record -- 502-450 
through Saturday -- over .500. I think the number of years you're over .500 is 
a good batting average for a manager." 
</P>
<P>
After a struggling start linked to the uncertainty of his contract talks with 
the Twins, Frank Viola has pitched 17 consecutive scoreless innings, including 
a 2-0 victory over Dave Stewart and the Oakland A's Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Viola is 6-8 while Stewart is 12-4, but he had a message for the A's ace. "Tell 
him I'm back, if he asks," Viola said. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart won't ask and doesn't have to be told. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had to pitch against Frank Viola every four days, it would eventually 
cause me mental strain and a nervous breakdown," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rickey Henderson has been on a roll since returning to the A's, but the team 
began has a 4-5 record since Henderson arrived. The A's have been hurt by the 
continued absence of relief ace Dennis Eckersley and diminished bullpen depth 
stemming from the departure of Eric Plunk and Greg Cadaret in trade for 
Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
Eckersley, sidelined by a shoulder strain since May 27, may return next 
weekend. The bullpen has a 1-7 record and four blown saves in 14 chances since 
he went out. 
</P>
<P>
And the bullpen's earned-run average since Plunk and Cadaret were traded was 
4.84 through Thursday, compared to 2.03 previously. 
</P>
<P>
What does it portend for the race in the AL West to have Texas only 2 1/2 games 
out before a weekend series with Seattle despite a combined 10-16 record and 
5.54 ERA by two pitchers who will eventually do better, Charlie Hough and Bobby 
Witt? 
</P>
<P>
Although the Dodgers have been calling Pittsburgh about the availability of 
Barry Bonds, it hasn't been with the persistance that General Manager Syd 
Thrift of the New York Yankees has been displaying in regard to third baseman 
Bobby Bonilla, whom Thrift originally signed for the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
"Syd wants Bonilla bad, but I won't trade him," Pirate General Manager Larry 
Doughty said. "If I trade him, I'll go out and buy the rope for the city of 
Pittsburgh to put around my neck." 
</P>
<P>
Baseball's worst statistical line may belong to pitcher Bill Bene, the Dodgers' 
No. 1 draft choice in 1988 from Cal State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Recently demoted from Class-A Bakersfield to a rookie league team at Salem, 
Ore., Bene has pitched 16 1/3 innings this year with 17 hits, 19 earned runs, 
36 walks, four hit batters, 10 wild pitches and 16 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
Which raises a question: Why, in an era when college players are jumping 
directly to the majors or requiring only a year or two in the minors, would the 
Dodgers use their top pick on a project who may require four or five years -- 
even if he had the best arm in the draft, as the Dodgers claim? 
</P>
<P>
McGwire had 99 home runs in 1,389 at-bats through Friday and figures to reach 
100 quicker than anyone in history except for Ralph Kiner, who did it in 1,351 
at-bats. Jim Gentile did it in 1,419, and Harmon Killebrew in 1,420. 
</P>
<P>
From Pittsburgh Pirates broadcaster Steve Blass: "I went in and saw the movie, 
Batman, last night. It was good, but I liked the book better."

<P>
Dismal: The Dodgers finished 27 games above .500 during the miracle season of 
1988, but they have a 278-286 record for the last 3 1/2 seasons, an indication 
that 1988 was strictly an aberration. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Clutch: Of the 43 runs that Baltimore Orioles shortstop Cal Ripken Jr. had 
driven in through Friday, 20 had tied games or put the Orioles ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Record-Setting: The Orioles are spending their 56th day in first place, a major 
league record for a team that finished last the year before. The 1977 Chicago 
White Sox, coming off a last-place finish in 1976, held the record, spending 55 
days in first before finishing third. 
</P>
<P>
Warpath?: The Cleveland Indians have scored one run or fewer in 21 games, 
losing 18. 
</P>
<P>
Hit Parade: The Montreal Expos' Kevin Gross can tie Don Drysdale's record of 
sharing or leading the National League in hit batters for four consecutive 
seasons if he does it again this year. He has nailed four batters in 109 1/3 
innings, but may have trouble surpassing Chicago Cub reliever Mitch Williams, 
who is known as the Wild Thing. Williams leads the National League with five 
hit batters -- in only 39 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Gross II: The Montreal right-hander has been two different pitchers this year. 
In his seven wins, he has allowed only seven earned runs in 58 innings for a 
1.40 earned-run average. In his seven losses, he has allowed 40 earned runs in 
37 innings for a 9.73 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
All-Stars: Detroit Tigers second baseman Lou Whitaker says he needs the rest 
and will probably reject a reserve selection, leaving Alan Trammell as the 
Tigers' probable All-Star representative. Whitaker had 16 home runs through 
Friday. Trammell had 19 runs batted in and drove in more than one run in a game 
Tuesday night for the first time since Sept. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Friendly Confines?: The Chicago Cubs' seven-game losing streak, which they 
ended Friday night, included an 0-6 home stand during which the Cubs scored 
only seven runs as Ryne Sandberg went hitless in 20 at-bats and Andre Dawson 
was two for 21. "We came in seven feet tall and came out a midget," Manager Don 
Zimmer said of the home stand that left the Cubs with an 18-21 record at 
Wrigley Field. ROSS NEWHAN

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
GOODEN OUT 15 DAYS AFTER BEING CHASED BY REDS IN THIRD, 6-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The New York Mets' Dwight Gooden gave up solo home runs to Barry Larkin and Kal 
Daniels before leaving the game in the third inning because of a sore right 
arm, and the Cincinnati Reds won, 6-2, Saturday at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Gooden (9-4) will be placed on the 15-day disabled list today. He pitched 
two-plus innings, the shortest outing of his career, before leaving with what 
was diagnosed as sore muscles in his right armpit. He has complained of 
stiffness in that area on several occasions in the past month. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to do it," Manager Davey Johnson said of putting Gooden on the disabled 
list. "It's like cutting off your right arm, but it's the most prudent thing to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Tapani will be recalled from triple-A Tidewater of the International 
League. Tapani was 7-3 with a 3.16 earned-run average at Tidewater. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real tough to describe," Gooden said. "You don't feel a sharp pain from 
throwing the ball. It's as if someone hit you with a stick or a hammer, more of 
that type of pain." 
</P>
<P>
Gooden left the game after giving up a home run to Daniels leading off the 
third inning. It was Daniels' second homer and his first since April 28. Larkin 
hit his homer off Gooden in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
"You could tell he wasn't 100%," Red outfielder Eric Davis said of Gooden. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds' Jack Armstrong (1-1) gave up two runs and eight hits in six-plus 
innings after being added to the roster from triple-A Nashville before the 
game. Rob Dibble pitched two innings, and John Franco finished for his 21st 
save in 23 opportunities. Franco has been in 28 games this season and has 
finished 25 of them. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Mets' fourth loss in their last five games. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 3, San Francisco 2 -- Greg Maddux gave up two runs in 7 2/3 innings and 
added a game-winning run batted in to lead the Cubs past Rick Reuschel and the 
Giants at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Maddux (7-7) won for the sixth time in his last eight starts and helped end 
Reuschel's career-high nine-game winning streak. Reuschel (12-3) hadn't lost 
since April 28. 
</P>
<P>
Maddux, who had given up two runs in his previous 24 innings, yielded seven 
hits, and Mitch Williams pitched 1 1/3 innings for his 20th save. 
</P>
<P>
With the score 2-2, Vance Law led off the fourth with a double and scored one 
out later when Maddux singled to center. Maddux is 12 for 38 (.316) with four 
RBIs this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants announced that outfielder Kevin Mitchell, who leads the major 
leagues with 25 home runs, has an inflamed left knee. The club said that 
Mitchell will take medication. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell is hitting .290 with a major leagues-leading 72 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 4, Montreal 1 -- Alex Trevino drove in all four runs with two doubles 
as the Astros beat the Expos at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Andersen (2-1), who gave up two hits in three innings, earned the 
victory. Dave Smith got the last three outs for his 16th save. 
</P>
<P>
With no score and one out in the fifth, Craig Reynolds singled against Pascual 
Perez (4-9) and scored when Trevino grounded a 3-and-2 pitch down the 
left-field line. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal tied it against Bob Forsch in the bottom of the inning. Tim Wallach, 
Tom Foley and Nelson Santovenia singled to load the bases, and Spike Owen drove 
in Wallach with a fielder's-choice grounder. 
</P>
<P>
Houston had runners on second and third with one out in the seventh when 
Montreal intentionally walked Ken Caminiti to get to Trevino, the No. 8 hitter. 
Trevino lined a double into the left-field corner to score all three runners. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 9, San Diego 3 -- Jose Oquendo had four hits in a game for the first 
time in his career, including a two-run triple in a five-run second inning, to 
lead the Cardinals past the Padres at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's Bip Roberts reached base in his first three at-bats, stretching his 
streak of consecutive times reaching base to nine, tying a club record. Roberts 
had six hits and three walks before grounding out to third base in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Power (1-2) pitched 4 2/3 innings of shutout relief after relieving Frank 
DiPino in the fourth inning. Pat Clements (1-1), a last-minute substitute for 
Eric Show, was the loser. Show has a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals scored five runs in the second after two were out. With the bases 
loaded, rookie pitcher Ken Hill singled to right field to score one run. Vince 
Coleman followed with a two-run single, and Oquendo hit a two-run triple. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis made it 8-3 in the fifth, helped by two fielding errors by third 
baseman Tim Flannery, which allowed three runs to score. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals got their final run in the sixth inning on an RBI single by Ozzie 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 4, Atlanta 2 -- Bruce Ruffin won his first game in almost a year 
as the Phillies beat the Braves at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Ruffin (1-3) gave up one run and six hits in five innings, winning for the 
first time since July 16, 1988. Roger McDowell pitched three innings for his 
ninth save. 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies took a 2-0 lead in the first inning off Pete Smith (2-9). Tom Herr 
singled with one out, went to third on Von Hayes' single and scored on a balk. 
Hayes stole third base and scored on a sacrifice fly by Ricky Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia scored two more runs in the sixth inning when Geronimo Berroa 
booted Charlie Hayes' single in right field. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta's Jeff Blauser hit a solo home run in the fifth, his fourth homer of 
the season, and Dale Murphy added a run-scoring single in the seventh.

HIS NL ALL-STAR SQUAD MIGHT BEAT AL, BUT LASORDA WILL FEEL LIKE A LOSER 
</P>

<P>
After announcing the names of his coaches and trainers for the July 11 All-Star 
game in Anaheim, National League Manager Tom Lasorda of the Dodgers said 
Saturday that he wished he was not involved in any further roster decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish the fans would pick all the players, not just the starters, and I am 
serious," said Lasorda, making his fourth appearance as the All-Star manager. 
"You have guys around the league who take it personally if you don't select 
them. You have to worry about guys on your own team. There is a lot of 
resentment. 
</P>
<P>
"And then there are guys who got it in their contracts where they make so much 
more money if they make the All-Star team. You don't pick those guys, you have 
more resentment. You have their agents mad at you." 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda, in conjunction with National League President Bill White, chose 
Montreal's Buck Rodgers and San Diego's Jack McKeon as coaches. Three of 
Lasorda's Dodger coaches were also picked to serve as batting practice staff: 
Joe Amalfitano, Mark Cresse and Bill Russell. The National League All-Star 
trainers will be San Diego's Dick Dent and Montreal's Ron McClain. 
</P>
<P>
After the starters are announced at the close of fan balloting later this week, 
Lasorda and White must choose the reserves that fill out the 28-man roster by 
this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda emphasized that White will influence the selection of the reserves. 
"He's already called me a couple of times and pointed out some things; the 
league president is very involved in this," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
But no matter, Lasorda said, the manager always ends up as the bad guy. 
</P>
<P>
"There was one year when I was sitting down with Chub Feeney, who was the 
league president, and going over the roster," Lasorda said. "He wanted a 
pitcher from my club, but I said, 'Chub, my pitcher is going to pitch on Sunday 
before the game, so I want to take this pitcher from this other team.' 
</P>
<P>
"Chub said no, he wanted my pitcher. So we picked my pitcher. And then I get a 
letter from the agent of the pitcher from the other team, the pitcher I wanted, 
giving me a hard time about not taking his guy. So what do you do?" 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda said the safest approach is to give special consideration to those who 
finish second in the fan balloting, and to adhere to a ballot submitted by each 
manager listing his votes for the league's top 10 pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
"But I still worry," Lasorda said. "I worry about my team, I worry about all of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
So which Dodger player or players will make the All-Star team? The leading 
candidate might be catcher Mike Scioscia, despite his .244 average (three 
homers, 19 RBIs). Scioscia has played well defensively, throwing out 36% of 
attempted base stealers. It would be Scioscia's first All-Star appearance. 
</P>
<P>
The other top Dodger top candidates are pitchers Orel Hershiser and Jay Howell 
and second baseman Willie Randolph. All three have worthy statistics, but all 
three face heavy competition at their positions.

CLIPPERS LET DAILEY GO BUT KEEP NORMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Clippers' youth movement, which forced Norm Nixon into retirement last 
season, claimed another victim Saturday when the club announced it would not 
pick up the option on guard Quintin Dailey. 
</P>
<P>
That was the only move of any significance for the Clippers, who, as expected, 
picked up the option on Ken Norman and made offers to restricted free agents 
Benoit Benjamin, Tom Garrick and Ken Bannister. Benjamin was offered about 
$1.25 million, a 25% raise that is required by the collective bargaining 
agreement. It may increase to match an offer from another club. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to relinquishing rights to Dailey, 28, who was not immediately 
available for comment, the Clippers also decided not to make offers to Grant 
Gondrezick and Rob Lock.

TARTIKOFF: THRIVING IN AN UNSURVIVABLE JOB; 
</P>
<P>
PROGRAMMING CHIEF WILL SOON ENTER HIS SECOND DECADE AT NO. 1 NBC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE HAITHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the audience is watching television, Brandon Tartikoff is watching the 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
He says he knows why people watch TV -- not just the medium, but specific 
programs. The president of NBC's entertainment division can create a mental 
picture of a broadcast's audience -- in detail, as vivid as the image on a 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
Take CBS' "60 Minutes," for example. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what the viewers' attitude is when they watch '60 Minutes,' " Tartikoff 
asserted in a recent conversation at NBC's Burbank headquarters. "There is 
probably a healthy population of people who watch '60 Minutes' because they had 
all these ambitious ideas about what they were going to do over the weekend. 
They were going to read the book that has been sitting on their nightstand. 
They were going to exercise. They were going to take their wife out to lunch. 
They probably didn't accomplish all of the things they set out to do this 
weekend. But if they watch '60 Minutes,' at least they can say: 'Here's an hour 
I set aside to do something worthwhile.' 
</P>
<P>
"I know there are these sociological phenomena, and you can tap into them. It's 
almost like I have an intravenous (tube) into the People Meter system. It's 
more of a sickness than a talent." 
</P>
<P>
Even after 9 1/2 years as NBC's programming czar, Tartikoff is not eager for a 
cure (although he says his passion for seeing his instincts reflected in the 
Nielsens may someday force him to undergo deprogramming at the "Betty Ford 
Center for Ratings Withdrawal.") 
</P>
<P>
If anyone is in the position to predict the fickle tastes of the American TV 
viewer, it is Tartikoff -- if only because of his longevity. Next January will 
mark Tartikoff's 10th anniversary as president of NBC Entertainment -- a period 
that has taken the executive from his 31st to his 40th birthday, as well as 
bringing NBC from a distant last place in 1980 to an almost embarrassingly wide 
lead as TV's No. 1 network for four seasons running. Measured by a more 
tangible standard, NBC's profits during that time have soared from $48 million 
to an estimated $600 million. 
</P>
<P>
So dominant has NBC become that it has now finished first in the prime-time 
ratings for 53 weeks in a row -- surpassing the previous record of 46 weeks 
that CBS set in 1962-63. 
</P>
<P>
Tartikoff's power within the network has grown with his success. Already 
president of NBC Entertainment and, since 1984, president of NBC Productions, 
the unit that produces TV programs and theatrical motion pictures, Tartikoff 
acquired his third title last October: chairman of the NBC Program Development 
Group, a committee established to encourage cross-pollination of program ideas 
among executives from the news, sports, entertainment, business affairs and TV 
stations divisions. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the only bitter taste in Tartikoff's otherwise sweet success has been 
the press criticism heaped on him and the network last season for lax broadcast 
standards that allowed some questionable programming to tarnish NBC's golden 
reputation for taste and class. The most blatant example was a Geraldo Rivera 
special on Satanic cults last November that featured detailed accounts of 
cultists' bloody rituals. The New York Times later condemned the program in an 
editorial as pornography. 
</P>
<P>
It had been years since Tartikoff or NBC had been criticized for much of 
anything -- and the knife cut deeply. Months later, Tartikoff remains 
defensive. He admits that if he were a TV critic he would have had to slam 
himself to the mat just as hard as his detractors did. But, in the same breath, 
he protests that NBC did not receive enough credit for launching a season of 
original programming on schedule despite the difficulties imposed by the 
Writers Guild of America strike. He attributes NBC's lapses of taste to the 
rush to get programs on the air. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sort of hoping there is a statute of limitations on these supposed 
crimes," Tartikoff said wearily. "I'm hoping that as we go into the 1989-'90 
season, not only does the ratings slate get wiped clean but the holdover 
effects of the blemishes of last season will be equally forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
And Tartikoff is determined not to let the pain interfere with the pleasure of 
NBC's recent triumphs. "We have, in the aggregate, done nothing to be really 
ashamed of for the past season, and a lot of things to be proud of -- not the 
least of which is this kind of statistical winning streak that we're on," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a kind of meaningless statistic, I guess, in the real world," he added. 
"But from a competitive standpoint, as a competitor -- which I am -- the fact 
that we achieved something that nobody had achieved in modern-day television, 
it's something that you can put in your book of memories or your scrapbook and 
say: 'It was there, and we did it.' We were able to put together this streak in 
the most competitive time that's ever existed for network television." 
</P>
<P>
In this most competitive time, Tartikoff still shows no signs of job burnout -- 
even though others who have held the high-pressure position have either been 
forced out or fled for their sanity in recent years. Brandon Stoddard, who was 
doing a handy job of launching sophisticated, critically acclaimed and 
demographically desirable programming for ABC, jumped ship last March, saying 
that being entertainment president just "wasn't fun anymore." CBS' Kim 
LeMasters has predicted his own meltdown will occur after about three years. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Tartikoff holds the record for longest tenure of a programming chief at 
one network. Only his one-time mentor, Fred Silverman, has spent more time in 
control of prime-time schedules -- five years at CBS, three at ABC and three at 
NBC, where, as network president, he elevated the 29-year-old Tartikoff from a 
mid-level programming job to vice president of programs on the West Coast and 
then, 18 months later, to his current post. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm probably closer to the end of this run than I am to the beginning," 
Tartikoff mused over lunch in the sunny NBC commissary, "and I look at this job 
a little differently today than I did when I went into it in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"If somebody told me in 1980 any number of facts (about today), I would have 
thought they were out of their minds. One is that, when I took this job, I'd 
still be doing it 10 years later -- because my two predecessors (Mike Weinblatt 
and Paul Klein) lasted a grand total of 18 months together. 
</P>
<P>
"The second thing is that NBC would be No. 1. I thought that there was 
something chemical about NBC, that this was something that the network can't 
do." 
</P>
<P>
But the network did it -- and Brandon Tartikoff is still doing it. Although he 
admits his NBC duties will never duplicate the high of taking a last-place 
network to the top, Tartikoff still sees network TV as "the biggest toy store 
in the world." 
</P>
<P>
One of Tartikoff's favorite games in the TV toy store is something he calls 
"This Is Them, and This Is Us," a mental exercise in which he tries to guess 
what the TV viewer will watch when faced with competing attractive choices on 
two networks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a game I play with my wife (Lilly) -- or let's say, I play it and she 
tolerates it," Tartikoff said. "And I generally like to play it when the 
match-ups are almost surrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
"This past May, we had 'The Trial of the Incredible Hulk' on, and ABC had 'War 
and Remembrance,' either the opening or the closing chapter. And I'd cut to, 
like, the Hulk hulking out, and then I'd cut to John Gielgud and Jane Seymour 
in a train station about to go off to wherever it is they were going off to. 
I'd sit there, and I'd say: 'They're loving this,' or 'This is too long. Their 
fingers are getting itchy. OK, they're looking at the clock, now they're going 
to (change channels), they're going to start grazing at this point. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Along with personal instinct, Tartikoff has come to take network research 
fairly seriously. "When I first got to NBC, I had a certain attitude toward 
research -- it was a dirty word," Tartikoff said. "It was the people who sat 
back while I worked impossible hours to do all these pilots, and they would 
come in the last week and tell me why the American public didn't like any of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"But what I've developed over the years is not a reliance on research, but an 
ability to decipher from the research what the audience is really telling you. 
Not just about one show, but things you can apply to other shows. If somebody 
slaps his wife to make a point in one pilot and it tests badly, and six months 
later you find another writer doing the same thing in another pilot, you can 
say, 'No, don't do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Unlike more reticent executives, such as ABC's Stoddard, Tartikoff also makes a 
game of his title and his position, relishing his public appearances and even 
making occasional appearances on NBC shows, including "Night Court," "Saturday 
Night Live" and "Hollywood Squares." 
</P>
<P>
Tartikoff's demeanor on the job is equally informal. As he wanders the halls of 
NBC, the people he runs into -- from noted producers working on new series to 
the guys on his Saturday softball team -- treat him less like a network 
president than a favorite counselor at Camp NBC. And, although the backlash 
following the Geraldo special still hurts like a broken nose, Tartikoff 
regained his sense of humor enough to appear as "The Satanic Messenger," an NBC 
promotional spot shown to representatives of the network's affiliated stations 
at their annual convention in May. "How do we do it (stay in first place)? We 
have no standards," says the dark stranger with the bandage on his nose. 
</P>
<P>
And Tartikoff recently made an appearance in his first promotional spot for an 
NBC series, for the so-called "Lost Episodes of Miami Vice." The network had 
scheduled the finale of "Miami Vice" to air during the important May ratings 
sweeps, even though there were four earlier episodes that hadn't aired yet. An 
NBC accountant told Tartikoff that those episodes, produced at a cost of $5 
million, could not simply be dumped. 
</P>
<P>
So rather than just put them on after the finale and risk the same low ratings 
that "Vice" had suffered throughout the season, Tartikoff, who began his career 
as a promotion writer, decided to promote the episodes as "The Lost Episodes of 
Miami Vice." The producers of the spot persuaded him to portray the network 
executive who steals the idea of presenting the lost episodes from his 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
"I would never do a straight spot where I come out and say: 'We have a great 
show on at 9:30, it's called 'The Nutt House,' and I think you'll love it," 
Tartikoff said. "But the director shot it in a way that it doesn't look like 
I'm trying push myself onto center stage -- I come off like kind of a jerk in 
the thing. It was fun, it cost $30,000 -- and it worked!" 
</P>
<P>
Tartikoff said he turns down far more requests to appear on NBC shows than he 
accepts. He also recently turned down an offer from "a major studio" to appear 
in a feature film as a head of network programming named Fred Tartenstein. 
</P>
<P>
"I do (guest appearances) if I think it's going to be fun," Tartikoff said. "I 
do it if it's not going to be demeaning to the position, and in general I try 
to do something that makes me part of the joke. 
</P>
<P>
"And besides," he added sheepishly, "I know that, when I leave the job, I'm not 
going to be offered 'Night Court' or 'Saturday Night Live' or 'Hollywood 
Squares,' or Bob Hope specials. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't recommend this for every person who's in charge of programming, but 
I've always tried to take a personal responsibility for what goes on the air. . 
. . If I can attach a name, a face, a spokesperson to this network that has 
many faces, and let them know that somebody's willing to stand up and defend 
what's on, I want to do that. And to show that there's a certain degree of fun 
to doing what we do here." 
</P>
<P>
TV has been fun in the last 10 years, but not as innovative as Tartikoff had 
hoped. Though NBC has grown during his tenure as entertainment president, 
Tartikoff notes with regret that TV really hasn't. "It bothers me that 
television in general hasn't undergone the kind of sea change that I hoped it 
would have by this time, just in terms of radically altering the way half-hour 
shows and hour shows are presented," Tartikoff said. " 'Miami Vice' was, I 
thought, the first big toe in the water. It was a whole radical way of 
storytelling that I thought could be followed up." 
</P>
<P>
That it hasn't -- at least not successfully -- is in part the fault of network 
programmers such as himself, he conceded, but also of writers, producers, 
production companies and the audience. All three networks have experimented 
with blending comedy and drama in such half-hour programs as "The Days and 
Nights of Molly Dodd," "Hooperman" and "Frank's Place," he noted, but viewers 
did not embrace them in sufficient numbers to keep them alive. Instead they 
have shown a preference for such old-fashioned melodramas as CBS' "Murder, She 
Wrote" and NBC's own "Matlock" and "In the Heat of the Night." 
</P>
<P>
"It's as if the audience wandered out to the edge with us for 'Hill Street 
Blues' and 'Miami Vice,' then turned around, came back and said, 'We're more 
comfortable 15 feet from the cliff as opposed to right on the edge,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
The networks' conservative 1989-90 prime-time schedules don't break much new 
ground either, Tartikoff acknowledged. "I think there's a return to -- I don't 
know if it's a kinder, gentler America like George Bush would like to believe 
it to be, but I think we are in very moral times," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although he did not label any new NBC shows as such, Tartikoff called the 
1988-89 season on the other networks -- whose schedules are fraught with 
returning stars and almost gratuitously wholesome family dramas -- 
"retro-television." 
</P>
<P>
"If the videocassettes of those pilots were put into a strongbox and sunk into 
the La Brea Tar Pits, and archeologists came along in the year 2050 and had to 
figure out the decade the shows were produced, who could guess? I mean, Richard 
Chamberlain as a doctor?" Tartikoff scoffed, referring to CBS' fall medical 
series "The Hawaiian," in which the former star of "Dr. Kildare" again plays a 
physician. ABC, meanwhile, will be offering revivals of "Mission: Impossible," 
"Columbo" and "Kojak." 
</P>
<P>
From a scheduling standpoint, however, Tartikoff sees the networks attempting a 
tentative experiment. Rather than creating traditional TV nights -- family 
comedies from 8 to 9 p.m., followed by adult comedies from 9 to 10 and 
action-adventure dramas in the 10-11 p.m. slot, Tartikoff predicts the networks 
will strive to create whole nights of compatible programming that cater to one 
specific group of viewers. 
</P>
<P>
"You may find nights that are constructed the way CBS' Monday night is," 
Tartikoff said, referring to that network's decision to run six comedies on 
Monday, including newcomers "Major Dad," "The People Next Door" and "The Famous 
Teddy Z." 
</P>
<P>
Tartikoff believes the CBS all-comedy night must have been inspired by a 
technique tried for one night by NBC during the February ratings sweeps. As 
counter-programming to CBS' "Lonesome Dove" miniseries, NBC presented six 
popular comedies in what the network promoted as "The Night of 1,000 Laughs." 
</P>
<P>
"I keep opening my mail every Monday and looking for a royalty check from CBS," 
Tartikoff joked. 
</P>
<P>
Tartikoff also envisions the Big Three networks each seeking its own identity, 
similar to the distinct profiles of specialized cable channels, in order to 
lure the audience in the future. 
</P>
<P>
CBS, he said, could become known as the news and sports network. That network 
recently paid $1.06 billion for the right to telecast Major League Baseball, 
including the World Series and both the National League and American League 
championships, for four years beginning in 1990. CBS also continues to feature 
more prime-time news than its competitors with three informational hours -- "48 
Hours," "West 57th" and "60 Minutes." 
</P>
<P>
ABC, Tartikoff noted, could also win points for news, with the continuing 
popularity of "20/20" and the fall debut of "Prime Time," a news program that 
features the intriguing team of Diane Sawyer and Sam Donaldson. In both daytime 
and prime time, Tartikoff guessed that ABC, home of the Emmy-winning "Wonder 
Years" and "thirtysomething," may choose to market its shows as "boutique" 
items, which are tantalizing to advertisers not for their high ratings but for 
their young-and-affluent demographics. 
</P>
<P>
And NBC? 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe NBC will continue to be a broad, all-service network -- that may be my 
own myopic view of it," Tartikoff said. "But I do believe that you're not going 
to see any one of the networks up and disappear. It was prognosticated back in 
the late '70s in the New York Times that NBC could go out of business in one or 
two years." 
</P>
<P>
If Tartikoff's predictions for network TV longevity are correct, he is in no 
danger of being out of a job any time soon. But after nearly 10 years, why does 
he want to keep going, when the lure of lucrative studio offers or the creative 
autonomy he might achieve as an independent producer grow stronger every year? 
</P>
<P>
Tartikoff said that the challenge of expanding the fledgling NBC Productions, 
as well as the diversity of his job as a programmer and his continuing desire 
to push the boundaries and find "the next show that gets people excited," will 
keep him happy for a long time. "As I find over time, what's great about this 
job is (that) if you have a thousand ideas, there are a thousand different 
places to put them," he said. "And when I looked at the logical next place to 
go, which is the production side of things, I always thought that would be 
frustrating, because you would have a thousand ideas and no place to put them." 
</P>
<P>
Tartikoff predicts, however, that he will become yet another entertainment 
president-turned-producer when he comes up with series idea so good he can't 
stand to give it away. 
</P>
<P>
"That will be the point when I say, 'Yeah, this is the one idea -- or these 
three or four ideas -- that I just don't want to give out,' " Tartikoff said. 
"These will be the ones that I really want to see if I could do myself."

DREAMS AND SCENES FROM WORKING-CLASS HOLLYWOOD;

<P>
A FILM-MAKING FAMILY FIGHTS UPHILL STRUGGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
This is the story of a hard-working family on a limited budget pursuing the 
Hollywood dream. 
</P>
<P>
Mom is actress Sharon Farrell, star of "The Reivers" and in 1970 described as 
one of the decade's most promising young film talents. Her career never quite 
gained its full potential, though she worked steadily for a good number of 
years. She's still got her looks and her sweet, ingenuous Southern personality, 
but at age 40 finds acting jobs tough to come by. 
</P>
<P>
Dad is Dale Trevillion, an engineer whiz in system and cost analysis for the 
Army before he dropped out to become a film maker. Except for an occasional gig 
consulting on the so-called "Star Wars" (Strategic Defense Initiative), the 
43-year-old Mississippi native, who wears his sandy blond hair in a 
shoulder-length mane and favors tie-died T-shirts and mirrored sunglasses, 
considers himself a Hollywood hyphenate -- a writer-director-producer of 
feature films. 
</P>
<P>
Son is Chance Boyer, 18, blond, blue-eyed, tan and handsome, teen heart-throb 
material if he can get the right acting breaks. 
</P>
<P>
Together they've made a little film. Not the artsy labor of love or personal 
statement you might expect from the Cassavettes crowd or Henry Jaglom's 
extended clan. Nor is it a major studio release built on star power and 
connections akin to the families Fonda or Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
Nope. Father knows how to analyze his systems. This project is far more 
pragmatic. It's an action-adventure flick called "One Man Force," a "designer 
film," Trevillion says without apology. Written, directed and produced by 
Trevillion and budgeted at $1.3 million, "Force" features the late John 
Matuszak as a narcotics detective. 
</P>
<P>
Highlights include the ex-football star Matuszak crushing a thug with a 
refrigerator, battling bad guys in a high-speed mountain road chase, and 
shooting a lawyer's ear off. ("I had a few guys in mind when I wrote that," 
Trevillion says with a chuckle.) Farrell plays the widow of Matuszak's partner; 
Boyer plays her troubled son. 
</P>
<P>
The idea was that "One Man Force" would help Farrell get work again on TV, 
boost Boyer's career chances and pave the way for Trevillion's move to 
bigger-budget films. Not great expectations, but reasonable ones. Now they're 
not sure what it will do. 
</P>
<P>
The film's theatrical release had been scrubbed by the time of Matuszak's death 
June 17. Distributor Shapiro Glickenhaus had earlier dropped the original 
release plans for a number of cities, including Los Angeles, due to summer 
blockbusters crowding the theaters. They decided instead to test it on 17 
screens in Atlanta. With bookings in some of that city's better theaters and a 
"substantial" advertising campaign, but, Trevillion says, virtually no 
publicity, it premiered June 2. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Constitution called it an "episode of Miami Vice caught in the 
spin-dry cycle." Action-adventure fans went to see Hulk Hogan's "No Holds 
Barred" and "One Man Force" did $12,000 in its first weekend. It closed June 8. 
</P>
<P>
"Definitely disappointing," Robert Berney, national sales director for Shapiro 
Glickenhaus, says of the results. It will now go directly to video, hitting the 
stores by September. 
</P>
<P>
Trevillion knows all too well that failures happen in Hollywood. Not one to 
dwell on the negative, he'll move ahead with efforts to get financing for his 
next project, a $4-million "youth-oriented action adventure picture." Boyer 
will be in it, but not the lead. Trevillion dreams of bagging Keifer Sutherland 
or Emilio Estevez. 
</P>
<P>
"I need a name to put it together," Trevillion says, sitting with Boyer and 
Farrell in the sunroom of their Beverly Hills apartment. (Farrell and 
Trevillion have since moved to a small cabin in Topanga. Boyer has taken an 
apartment with Josh Evans, son of Ali McGraw and Robert Evans.) "Hopefully, 
Chance, after a couple more films will be a marquee name." The same problem 
holds for Farrell. "Right now I can't star Sharon in a film because she doesn't 
have enough star power," Trevillion says. When he gets a big-enough name, he'll 
give her a role worthy of her talents. "She's definitely one of the great 
untapped resources," he says. "But try telling that to the people you're trying 
to raise money from." 
</P>
<P>
Such are the cruel realities of kinship in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell was still a name that could attract film financing when she and 
Trevillion met in 1975 on the set of "The Premonition." Trevillion describes it 
as a science-fiction "tax-shelter picture put together for Avco-Embassy." He 
was associate producer and script doctor and Farrell was the star. Trevillion 
had seen her photo in the piles of 8x10s in the producers' offices, remembered 
her from "The Reivers" and urged them to cast her. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell was attracted to his efficiency. "He was the only person I'd ever seen 
on a set that got anything done," she says. "If a car didn't work, he'd get the 
car started. I was just really impressed with him. And I wanted to be part of 
making films. I didn't want to be just an actress." 
</P>
<P>
Trevillion had been a rising young star in military research and development 
before he sought to be a film maker. The Mississippi native had been one of 20 
graduate students chosen in 1966 for an Army systems research program sponsored 
by then-Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara. As one of McNamara's Whiz 
Kids, he headed a civilian research and development group working on weapons 
for Vietnam. The field lost its appeal when, toward the end of the war, he 
often faced protesters on his way to work. 
</P>
<P>
He longed for a more creative outlet. "I liked film because it was dealing with 
people's emotions," he says, "working with their deep fears, their loves and 
desires, getting close to the human heart. That's how I prefer to make change 
in the world." 
</P>
<P>
He enrolled in film school at NYU. Classmates included Robert Colesberry, 
co-producer of "Mississippi Burning." They studied all the great European film 
makers, Trevillion recalls. Bunuel was his favorite. He dropped out after his 
first summer job working with Colesberry on an independent feature, "The 
Haunt." "The Premonition" was his second film assignment. 
</P>
<P>
"The Premonition" was a curve on the comeback trail for Farrell, trying to 
regain the momentum she'd lost after the first push from "The Reivers." She had 
been pregnant during that film. Medical complications from Boyer's birth kept 
her from film work for several years. Sharon jumps up to look for the 1970 list 
forecasting her as one of the next decade's top ten stars. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone of them is a star except me," she exclaims with a laugh, talking from 
the next room. "I mean, I'm the only one. There's like Jack Nicholson, Donald 
Sutherland, Liza Minnelli. Unknowns at that time. It's so funny! . . . Dale 
calls me 'Miss Also Ran.' Woulda Shoulda Coulda. I don't care, I'm still alive 
and kicking. I'll outlive everyone, they'll have to hire me." 
</P>
<P>
She returns without the list but has found her son's baby pictures. "No way, 
put them away," he insists. 
</P>
<P>
Her son was 4 when Farrell and Trevillion met and married. Sharon had divorced 
Chance's father, White King Soap magnate and polo player John Boyer, several 
years earlier. Chance first took direction from his stepfather when attacked by 
kids at school. They didn't believe his claim to know the "Six Million Dollar 
Man." (Mom had guested on the series.) 
</P>
<P>
"He had good strong teeth," Trevillion says. "I told him to bite the kid if it 
happened again. Next thing, we get a call from the school and they tell us to 
come pick up Chance. He'd bit somebody." 
</P>
<P>
They settled in Los Angeles. Trevillion wrote scripts. None were produced, 
though enough sold or were optioned to encourage him to continue. Farrell 
worked steadily in films and episodic television. Boyer, who had begun his 
acting career in Pampers commercials at 6 months, worked with his mother in 
such films as "The Stuntman" and "Night of the Comet," and spent a year on 
"General Hospital." 
</P>
<P>
His mother was his first manager. "The only thing I could teach him was 
acting," she says. "I wanted him to be able to make a living, not having to be 
dependent on anyone." 
</P>
<P>
He's enjoyed the work and the life style it has afforded him, like the shiny 
black Jeep Cherokee in the driveway. "It was a lot easier than a paper route," 
he says. Currently on leave from USC's theater arts program, he found living on 
residuals depressing. College got in the way of paid acting assignments. 
</P>
<P>
Good times for the family included a year living beneath Diamond Head when 
Farrell landed a recurring role on "Hawaii-Five-O." A hoped-for spin-off never 
happened and work for Farrell dried up. 
</P>
<P>
"I never made a whole lot of money," she says of her acting career, "but I made 
enough to live. Now there's no work. Not even on television. They told me I 
don't have any TV-Q! I said I'd take smaller parts. After 21 years in the 
business, I can't get arrested." 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Trevillion had to set aside his scripts to take a job at Rockwell 
International working on the B-1B bomber. "Like a lot of my films," he says. 
"It suffered from a low budget." 
</P>
<P>
He also did risk analysis on the space-based laser and space-based surveillance 
systems for the SDI program. "Star Wars was real exciting, sexy stuff," he 
admits. "Still, it was dealing with death and destruction. It wasn't real 
positive from an emotional standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
Trevillion refused to give up on film making. In 1984, a Las Vegas commodities 
investor handed him $215,000 to write, direct and produce a feature film. 
Titled "Las Vegas Weekend," it went straight to video without going into 
theaters. It explored a computer nerd's coming of age in the gambling capital. 
A minor jackpot, it made back three times its cost. 
</P>
<P>
The payoff was $1.3 million to do "One Man Force." "He got a lot of mileage for 
the money," says Lenny Shapiro of Shapiro Glickenhaus. "It's a good-looking 
film for the budget." 
</P>
<P>
Although the family had raised its hopes of hitting the big time, the film's 
flop at the Atlanta theaters brought them back down a few notches. Still, it 
hasn't destroyed their summer plans. 
</P>
<P>
Chance Boyer is up for two parts in independent films -- one as a romantic lead 
and the other as a lifeguard. Between job interviews he can be found surfing. 
"You have to be able to laugh about it," he says of the family's chosen 
business. "You have to just be happy you're here." 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated by the film's apparent flop, Farrell wrote former co-worker Burt 
Reynolds, asking for a job on his new show, "B.L. Stryker." Reynolds' producer 
called to tell her she's got a guest shot on the upcoming season. "I guess 
(Reynolds) doesn't mind being seen on screen with us old hags," she says with a 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Trevillion will continue to show "Force" to potential investors in "Young 
Gangsters." He's also been talking to engineering firms about a job, but wants 
most to sit in Topanga Canyon and develop film projects. 
</P>
<P>
"This film has shown I can direct and do action pictures," he says with 
unflagging enthusiasm, his Southern accent backed by the urgency of a producer 
on the scent of a deal. "I really look forward to doing a $4-million picture." 
</P>
<P>
"For one thing," he adds with a grin, "I could do two takes."

DREAMS AND SCENES FROM WORKING-CLASS HOLLYWOOD; 
</P>
<P>
FOR THE CREWS, IT'S ANOTHER DAY AT THE OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A sharp crack from the rifles of a police color guard echoes through the neatly 
aligned rows of tombstones in the Los Angeles National Cemetery in Westwood . . 
. again and again and again. 
</P>
<P>
It's a scene from "Seven-Year Storm," a political/police thriller starring 
Steven Seagal and Kelly LeBrock. Shoot. Repeat the scene. Set up the scene 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Properties man Sal Sommatino handed out police badges to a platoon of extras 
and later dispensed Kleenexes to the same extras dressed in funereal black, 
sweating in the afternoon sun. 
</P>
<P>
Not a particularly glamorous side of Hollywood; rather, it's the anonymous side 
of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The Warner Bros. film isn't scheduled to appear in movie theaters until next 
year. But for the bulk of the crew gathered at National Cemetery, the end is 
three days away after nearly three months of shooting. By the time Seagal and 
LeBrock gear up for the promotional push to help "Seven Year Storm" at the 
box-office months from now, most of the crew members will already have one or 
two other completed projects under their belts. 
</P>
<P>
It's a typical cycle for Hollywood's blue collar workers. 
</P>
<P>
Christine Loss initially was driven by a desire to work in Hollywood . . . .but 
it took equal parts fate and hustle for her to become a stills photographer. 
When a film she was working on as a script supervisor in Utah didn't have a 
still photographer, Loss volunteered to do double duty and had a new career. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets down to being a job and some are more fun than others," she declared. 
"I worked on this picture called "Hot to Trot" about a talking horse -- this 
horse's mouth moved to the words it was saying -- and we had a great time 
although it made no money at the box office." 
</P>
<P>
"I worked on "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" and I was shooting things with Bob 
Hoskins holding an imaginary Roger Rabbit in his hands. That was a challenge 
and he was able to get across that he was dealing with imaginary, non-existent 
creatures with his body language." 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, the still photographer is the scapegoat for everyone's 
frustration," she said. "You're trying to get your shot and the director says 
please move out of the way or the star says you're in my eye-line or the 
director of photography says you can't stand there. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked on 'Raging Bull' with Robert De Niro and he never wanted to see a 
still camera pointed at him. It just made him totally nervous so I'd be hiding 
behind the camera and shooting around things in order to get my shots. He liked 
everything I shot and asked for me on 'True Confessions.' " 
</P>
<P>
There's not very much work for gaffer Patrick Blymyer to do at the cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
Blymyer, 51, is in charge of the crew's electricians and meeting the lighting 
requirements of the cameraman on a film. But Matt Leonetti, the director of 
photography for "Seven Year Storm," is using only a couple of reflector boards 
to augment the naturally bright sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty years ago, Blymyer was visiting an acquaintance on the set of the 
"Adventures in Paradise" television series to see how films were made. He 
signed up with the union that afternoon and got a call to work on a rigging 
crew four days later. Within four years, he was a gaffer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an interesting business because something different happens all the 
time," he reflected. "I've been all over the world working on pictures and met 
a lot of people I'd never meet screwing nuts on bolts at Lockheed Aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing wrong with the picture business is the hours are too long," he 
said, sounding a common complaint. "Being at work at 6 o'clock in the morning 
and working until 10 at night 6 days a week and the next week work from 4 in 
the afternoon until 7 in the morning -- I don't think it's very glamorous." 
</P>
<P>
This is Blymyer's last day on the set. He's leaving the shoot early to return 
to his New Hampshire home, near a small country inn that he and his wife (who 
worked in the film industry as a hairdresser) actively owned and operated for a 
few years. 
</P>
<P>
"I usually do a picture, go home for 2 or 3 months, and that's the way I've 
worked the last 10 years," he said. "I don't like to work one picture after 
another. I've never had any problem getting a job when I wanted one, 
truthfully." 
</P>
<P>
There was a personal stake involved for dolly grip Dave Merrill when he moved 
into the industry. 
</P>
<P>
His father was a film editor who died when Merrill was very young, cutting off 
a string of family involvement in the movie business from the '30s through the 
late '50s. Merrill began looking to break into the business in order meet 
people who had known his father. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to get a journeyman's card in one of the crafts to get into editorial 
(film editing) and I became a dolly grip and decided I liked it," said Merrill, 
32. "When the chance came to go into editorial, I wasn't married yet and I 
stayed a grip. The woman who could have gotten me in passed away and that door 
was closed." 
</P>
<P>
Merrill outlined the job of a grip as "if it's heavy or dirty or nobody else 
knows how to do it, it's our job." Grips are the muscle of a film crew, 
responsible for doing anything that will aid the cameraman get his shots. 
</P>
<P>
The camera is mounted on the dolly and a dolly grip like Merrill physically 
starts and stops the heavy device that allows the camera to move with, or 
around, the action. 
</P>
<P>
"I like pushing the dolly," Merrill said during a brief break between takes. 
"Moving the camera, operating the cranes, keeping pace with the actors and 
being able to read their faces and moods, I feel I'm part of the creative end 
instead of the strictly technical. 
</P>
<P>
Merrill hates the time his job forces him to spend away from his family but 14 
years as a dolly grip has left him attuned to the uncertainty that comes with 
working in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way, it's like (being) a carnival performer -- I don't know what else to 
do," said Merrill. "I don't want to work 9-5 and drive to the same place to 
work every day." 
</P>
<P>
"All these people will be unemployed Friday -- I can't think of anyone that 
knows he has a show starting," said microphone boom operator Lionel Lavallee 
later that afternoon. "It's great for the first two weeks because you're 
relaxing but always in the back of your mind, there's the little kicker, 'I've 
done something wrong or got somebody mad at me so I'm never gonna work again.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Lavallee, 42, was dissatisfied with his work 17 years ago when a friend 
associated with the sound department helped him get work as a cable man. While 
he hopes to eventually become a sound mixer, a major appeal of his current job 
is the active role he plays in filming. 
</P>
<P>
"When the camera rolls, the (camera) operator works, the first assistant 
(director) works, if we're dollying, the dolly grip works and I work," he said. 
"If I make a mistake, the shot doesn't work so you're right in the action. 
</P>
<P>
"You get an affinity for working with the people and what works with people. An 
old boom man told me, 'If they like you, you can make 100 mistakes. If they 
don't, it only takes one and you're dead.' " 
</P>
<P>
But Lavallee differed from most of the other crew members interviewed -- he 
earned a degree in psychology before starting his Hollywood career and also 
left the business for three years to work as a news director at a television 
station. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the best thing I could ever have done because you get to realize how 
much you bring to everybody else by making a movie. We're not making any 
product that's detrimental to people -- physically, anyway," he said with a 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very nurturing business. The crews, generally, take care of each 
other. There are probably 45-50 crew members on this shoot but if a stranger 
walks on the set, they're spotted immediately and it's like a family: 'Who's 
(that) coming?' We're out here in a cemetery and this is like our house." 
</P>
<P>
"We're going again, Sonny," barked director Bruce Malamuth following one take. 
</P>
<P>
"Again? With the exact same angles?" 
</P>
<P>
Seated besides the camera with a bulky notebook opened in her lap, Sonny 
Filippini is the script supervisor on "Seven Year Storm." In her own words, 
she's "a writing camera," recording the pertinent details of each shot, acting 
as liaison between the director on the set and the film editors who will piece 
the various takes into the finished movie. 
</P>
<P>
"The hardest thing is that I have to be on all the time because the crew, 
producers, production managers, actors all come to me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Filippini, 37, wasn't entirely comfortable being away from the center of 
activity -- during a brief interview, she periodically glanced towards the 
camera to make sure she wasn't needed for anything. An aspiring dancer until an 
illness ended that career, she considered editing but the uninviting prospect 
of spending time in a dark room prompted a switch to the script supervisor role 
when she was 21. 
</P>
<P>
"Many times, things aren't correct and I will go to the director and it's up to 
him to say that it can be a mismatch," she related. "In my job, you bite your 
finger and go, Ummmm, because when your name goes up on the film, (people) 
don't know the director told you the mismatch was OK. They assume it's your 
fault. 
</P>
<P>
"As a rule, I work non-stop by choice, unless I say enough," she said. "I went 
straight from shooting 'Karate Kid III' to shooting this so I haven't stopped 
in about 7 months. I'm taking a month's vacation after this, no matter what."

STAGEWEEK: CRYER ISN'T HIMSELF IN LATC 'BOYS' LIFE' 
</P>

"Basically, I've had to unlearn 24 years of post-feminist training," said Jon 
Cryer of his role in Howard Korder's "Boys' Life" (opening Friday at the Los 
Angeles Theatre Center). "The story with Jack is that he's in a perpetual state 
of arrested adolescence. He's still a kid -- that vicious kid you remember from 
when you were little. He's very misogynist, his major motivation is anger. And 
that anger takes its toll on his friends." 
</P>
<P>
Cryer, Greg Kean and Charlie Stratton play the post-college buddies; Kari 
Lizer, Jennifer Tilly and Maria Tirabassi are the women in their lives. "It's 
about understanding male/female relationships, becoming a man and accepting 
responsibility," Cryer continued. "It also deals with a lot of base instincts, 
a lot of truths -- sometimes frightening. What other people think, Jack says." 
The tone, he admits, is dark. "What the play's saying about men . . . is not 
good." 
</P>
<P>
Although the actor claims that he knows a lot of people like his character, 
playing the role -- with all of its adult complications -- has been a new 
experience. "You get into bad habits forever playing teen-agers," Cryer 
acknowledged. "But this director (David Beaird) is working on getting something 
out of me I've never done before. Usually, I play people pretty close to me. 
Even Ducky -- in 'Pretty in Pink' -- though he was way out there, was kind of 
like me. This guy Jack is nothing like me." 
</P>
<P>
Cryer is looking forward to another stretch this fall, when his new comedy 
series "The Famous Teddy Z" premieres on CBS in the coveted Monday slot 
following "Murphy Brown." In the series (from "Frank's Place" creator Hugh 
Wilson), Cryer plays a young guy just out of the Army who lands a job in a 
talent agency mail room -- and is suddenly catapulted into being the hottest 
agent in Hollywood. Explained the actor: "It's a normal person's adventures 
among the world of show biz." 
</P>
<P>
THEATER FILE: Local playwright Robert Schenkkan won first place -- and $5,000 
-- in the 1989 Beverly Hills Theatre Guild/Julie Harris Playwright Competition 
for his "Heaven on Earth." Second place ($1,000) went to New Yorker Bryan 
Williams for "Icarus Variations," with third place ($500) to Richard Hellesen 
of Fullerton for his "Once in Arden." Schenkkan's work will be staged this 
summer at the National Playwrights Conference at the Eugene O'Neill Theatre 
Center in Waterford, Conn. Hellesen's play will be given a mainstage production 
next season at South Coast Repertory. 
</P>
<P>
Film commitments were cited in actor Andrew Stevens' withdrawal from the 
Pasadena Playhouse production of the one-man show "JFK: Of Cabbages and Kings." 
As a result, the Playhouse replaced "JFK" with Betty Garrett's solo piece "No 
Dogs or Actors Allowed" (opening July 13) and Grammy-winning comedian Dale 
Gonyea's "An American in Pasadena" (opening July 28). 
</P>
<P>
The Padua Hills Playwrights Festival hosts a benefit fund-raiser July 9 at the 
Cal State Northridge Art &amp; Design Center, featuring a retrospective 
selection of works presented at previous festivals -- with some of the original 
casts. The evening includes Murray Mednick's "Coyote 1: Pointing," with Norbert 
Weiser and Darrell Larson; Leon Martell and Elizabeth Ruscio in their "Hoss 
Drawin' " and John O'Keefe's "The Magician," featuring Matthew Goulish. Also 
planned: excerpts of John Steppling's "Neck" with Jack Slater, Roxanne Rogers, 
John Diehl, Kathleen Cramer and Lola Glaudini; and Maria Irene Fornes' "Fefu 
and her Friends" with Lorinne Vozoff, Susan Krebs and Laura Fanning. Hosting 
are Ed Harris, Amy Madigan and Joe Spano. For information: (213) 281-6799. 
</P>
<P>
CRITICAL CROSSFIRE: Steven Dietz's "Ten November," a new drama (with songs by 
Eric Peltoniemi) based on the 1975 disappearance of the ore carrier S. S. 
Edmund Fitzgerald, recently opened at Los Angeles Theatre Center. 
</P>
<P>
Said The Times' Dan Sullivan: "Since Dietz directed the show, as well as 
supplying the text, he deserves some of the credit for its visual sureness. But 
it's not at all clear what story Dietz the writer wants to tell." 
</P>
<P>
From Charles Marowitz in the Herald Examiner: "As an evocation of mood and an 
imaginative reconstruction of a historic event, it has unquestionable impact. 
But as soon as one looks beyond its sentiments to its sense, it begins to lose 
credibility." 
</P>
<P>
In the Orange County Register, Thomas O'Connor wrote: "Perhaps if Dietz were 
not his own director, he'd have a better fix on 'Ten November's' lack of focus, 
its tendency to ramble. Dietz is like a dutiful reporter on a feature 
assignment, determined to cram in every jotting in his notebook, when judicious 
editing would help." 
</P>
<P>
Said Tom Jacobs in the Daily News: "There's no dramatic arc here. But it's not 
missed. Dietz's writing is vivid. He manages to be angry without getting 
self-righteous or preachy. And his direction is superb. This show really moves, 
but it never seems rushed." 
</P>
<P>
And from Bruce Feld in Drama-Logue: " 'Ten November' eloquently, in shifting 
documentary style, tries to find the answers to this tragedy and becomes a 
paean to the significance of loss in general. The cast is impeccable . . . Much 
praise is due composer-lyricist Peltoniemi and guitarists Marcos Loya and 
Jeffrey Willkomm."

ART NEWS: CRAFT, FOLK MUSEUM GOES TO MAY CO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Free rent isn't the only reason Patrick Ela is happy about temporarily moving 
the Craft and Folk Art Museum's operations into the nearby May Co. store. More 
gallery space is another. 
</P>
<P>
And Ela, the museum's director, already has big plans on how to use the space. 
</P>
<P>
The craft institution will move down Wilshire Boulevard to the department store 
(four blocks west at Fairfax Avenue) while awaiting construction of its new 
home, part of a multi-use complex. The complex is scheduled to open in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, the May Co. location, with 2,500 square feet available for gallery 
use, will provide 500 square feet more than the original museum, said Ela, who 
wants to use the extra space to show correlation between traditional and 
contemporary craft and folk art. 
</P>
<P>
The objects that traditional and industrial societies produce may appear to be 
unrelated, he said, but they definitely are not. 
</P>
<P>
"We live in an industrial society and probably go to a nice craft show or a 
department store to get clothing or our vessels to drink from. A person living 
in a traditional society in Turkey or Brazil or Italy deals with those issues 
and needs in a totally different way, but they are the same issues. One of the 
most frustrating things is that we haven't been able to do concurrent shows in 
each discipline to illustrate and explore those relationships." 
</P>
<P>
While still presenting changing exhibitions, Ela also plans to feature the 
museum's permanent collection in the temporary site. He hopes to make more 
people aware that the museum is a collecting institution and to encourage 
donations of objects, largely because the new complex is to have 15,000 square 
feet for galleries. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of collections we have not acquired or accepted because we 
have not had the capability to deal with them," Ela said. 
</P>
<P>
GRANTS: Three Southern California museums have received grants for special 
exhibitions from the National Endowment for the Humanities. They are: the 
Museum of Contemporary Art ($300,000), the Natural History Museum of Los 
Angeles County ($200,000) and UCLA's Museum of Cultural History ($300,000). . . 
. Astro Artz, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit arts organization that publishes 
High Performance magazine of experimental art, has received a $40,000 gift from 
the James Irvine Foundation. The funds will be used to buy a new desktop 
publishing system. 
</P>
<P>
CALLING ALL DOCENTS: The Southwest Museum is seeking English-speaking and 
bilingual volunteers for its docent training program. Weekday and weekend 
training sessions, both beginning this September, are available. Docents 
conduct tours for students and special interest groups. To enlist, call Barbara

PROVOCATIVE READING: A book that reportedly shocked the European architectural 
community in 1896 with an impassioned plea for a "modern" style suited to 
contemporary needs and ideas has been published by the Getty Center for the 
History of Art and the Humanities in the first English translation in nearly 90 
years.

L.A.-based legal recruiter Steve Sklar and his guests had a bad experience at 
R.J.'s the Rib Joint in Beverly Hills earlier this year. The spareribs were 
cool, the coffee burnt, and they never got a chance to order a second round of 
drinks. In general, Sklar thought, the restaurant seemed understaffed; 
certainly his table's waitress seemed to have too many customers to handle. 
</P>
<P>
Following advice I've given frequently in this column in the past, Sklar wrote 
to the restaurant to express his dissatisfaction -- in this case, directly 
addressing Bob Morris, president of Mor Food 'N Fun, which runs R.J.'s. 
Although he never heard back from Morris himself, Sklar now writes to tell me, 
he did get a phone call from one of the restaurant's managers, who wanted to 
know the name of the offending waitress. 
</P>
<P>
There was no offending waitress, Sklar replied. In his opinion, the 
organization of the dining room, not the individual server, was at fault. The 
manager kept pressing for a name, promising that the waitress would not be 
fired, but Sklar was adamant. Identifying the waitress would only have given 
the management a convenient scapegoat, he says. 
</P>
<P>
I probably wouldn't have identified the server either -- and, though I don't 
know if Sklar had this reaction, it seems somewhat insulting to be asked to 
"rat." 
</P>
<P>
A call to Morris on the matter, though, revealed that he was distressed to 
learn that a manager had called Sklar directly to deal with the complaint. 
"Every single letter of this kind is supposed to come to my personal 
attention," he says -- adding that he almost always invites disgruntled diners 
back to the restaurant at his expense. He also explained the policy of asking 
for the server's name: "People develop a one-on-one relationship with their 
waiters, and then are sometimes reluctant to blame them when something goes 
wrong. We often get complaints that begin, 'We had a terrible experience, but 
it's not the waiter's fault. . . .' About 50% of the time, it probably isn't. 
But sometimes it is. We ask for the waiter's name because we're honestly trying 
to find out where the problem was. We have to start somewhere. Otherwise, we'd 
never be able to track it down. 
</P>
<P>
"It is true, though, that we never fire a waiter because a customer complains. 
The only thing I've condoned immediate firing for is when somebody shows up 
drunk, drugged or we find them chasing tips. Or, of course, if we find someone 
who's just a lousy waiter -- someone who'd probably be happier being a doctor 
or a lawyer, or maybe a restaurant critic." 
</P>

MORE NAME GAMES: Jeremiah Tower's hotshot new San Francisco restaurant, Speedo 
690, has encountered a stop sign. Speedo International, which manufactures a 
well-known line of swimsuits that look as if they've been applied with a paint 
gun, has taken Tower to court for his use of the Speedo name -- though it is 
well known that Tower borrowed the name not from the swimwear company but from 
the Speedo Carburetor Shop, which used to occupy the premises he has taken 
over. Apparently unimpressed with this fact, Speedo International wants Tower 
to stop using the name, and to share whatever profits he might reap while 
continuing to use it. But if Tower thinks he's got trouble, he might enjoy 
hearing that the Soviet government, no less, has sued the German firm of 
Henkell &amp; Sohnlein in an effort to stop the marketing of a vodka called 
Gorbatschow.

SCENES FROM THE RESTAURANT STRUGGLE IN BEVERLY HILLS: Jean Leon, who is moving 
his famed La Scala from its original Beverly Hills location this fall, has 
found new quarters for the restaurant in the same community. La Scala II, which 
Leon plans to open soon after the original closes, will be located at 410 North 
Canon Drive (on the former site of Benito's 1).

Health benefits of 85,000 retired miners and widows are being threatened by the 
wildcat strikes of an estimated 37,000 coal miners, an industry group said. 
Joseph Brennan, Bituminous Coal Operators Assn. president, said the health 
benefits are funded through hourly contributions by the coal companies, and the 
strikes have cut off much of the fund's income. United Mine Workers spokesman 
Joe Corcoran could not be reached for comment on Brennan's allegations. Miners 
began wildcat strikes June 12 to protest the Pittston Co.'s refusal to sign a 
contract with the union and to protest the past jailing and $3-million fines 
levied against the union and its members.

EX-DODGER HOLTON IS LEARNING ROPES IN AL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HENNEMAN, The Baltimore Evening Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Brian Holton takes something off his fastball it's like Rosanne Barr 
taking off two pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Who really notices? Certainly not the audience. 
</P>
<P>
The Baltimore Orioles' right-hander doesn't take high velocity equipment to the 
pitching mound. Instead of an 85 mph fastball, which is about the major-league 
average, Holton deals pitches that are closer to the legal highway speed 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
He relies on curves, control and craftiness. And when his job is done, most of 
the time it is forgotten. His record is 2-5, which is as deceiving as his 
fastball. His earned run average is a respectable but not overwhelming 3.66, 
and he's already been cast in three different roles this season. 
</P>
<P>
Quickie quiz: Who was the winning pitcher in the Orioles' opening day win over 
the Boston Red Sox? Yep, it was Holton. But since then, except for a 6-1 win 
over Nolan Ryan and the Texas Rangers on May 29, the positive side of his 
personal ledger has been bare. 
</P>
<P>
Holton was the Orioles' late-inning closer when the season opened, regressed to 
the anonymity of a long reliever shortly thereafter, and finally moved into the 
starting rotation out of necessity. While all this was going on he was dealing 
with the adjustment of going from the National to the American League as a 
result of the trade that sent Eddie Murray to the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Not exactly what you would call an easy transition. Yet, in a rather obscure 
way, Holton has managed to contribute, though it would be difficult to find the 
evidence in his record. 
</P>
<P>
Take last Wednesday night for instance. He had a four-hit shutout in the top of 
the seventh inning but gave up a home run to Fred McGriff, a single to Lloyd 
Moseby and needed a strong relief effort from Kevin Hickey to avoid a possible 
loss. It was Holton's seventh start of the season. His record in those games is 
1-2. The hidden and vastly more important statistic is that the Orioles are 5-2 
in those games. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, Holton will settle for small favors while trying to get himself 
established in the starting rotation. "This was probably my best game of the 
season," he said after the Orioles' tense 2-1 win over the Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
Between starts Holton made an emergency relief appearance against the Angels in 
Anaheim last Sunday, when he accomplished two things. He worked out some 
mechanical flaws in his delivery and pitched an inning without using his 
curveball for the first time in the major leagues. The pattern continued 
Wednesday night, but to the same extremes. 
</P>
<P>
"I threw more fastballs than normal and was hitting my spots. And I also took 
something off the fastball," said Holton. Before Wednesday night, taking 
something off his fastball might have seemed like a contradiction. "That's 
true," said Holton, "but it's the name of the game with me. I have to get 
hitters swinging off their front foot. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the game I told (catcher) Bob Melvin, 'It's your game, put your glove 
down and call what you want.' The only time I shook him off all night was when 
he told me to." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to making the transition from starter (in spring training) to 
closer to middle man and back to starter, Holton has also been bothered by 
dizzy spells lately. "I was kind of in a fog out there," he admitted. "But 
mentally I was OK. I had some tests done and my blood pressure and EKG were 
good. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad it wasn't as bad (humid) as last night (Tuesday night) because I 
probably would have run out of gas early." 
</P>
<P>
As far as the readjustment to his starting role, Holton feels he's at the point 
now where he can be more consistent with the number of innings he pitches. "I'm 
fine now," he said. "I'm in shape and I should be able to do what I did 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Which is about what Manager Frank Robinson would like to expect from each of 
his five starters. "If they can get us into the seventh inning," said Robinson, 
"I feel like we can manipulate the bullpen from there. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a good outing for Holton," said Robinson. "The reason he was able to 
take something off his fastball is because he was throwing harder than he had 
before." 
</P>
<P>
Not that we're talking breakneck speed here. "He was up around 83 (m.p.h.) most 
of the time," said Robinson, "whereas before his fastball sometimes was in the 
70s." 
</P>
<P>
That speed can be as dangerous on the pitching mound as it is on the highway. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say he threw 50% more fastballs," said Melvin. "The guys around the league 
know he (Holton) is such a good curveball pitcher that's what they're 
thinking."

COMPUTER CHIPS COULD BECOME A NEW COMMODITY ON FUTURES MARKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID OLMOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Early last year, when prices for computer memory chips were climbing as quickly 
as a squirrel up a tree, Jeff Bittner saw a good chance to make a fast buck. 
</P>
<P>
Bittner bought 5,000 of the tiny semiconductors for $3.50 each on a Wednesday, 
sold them two days later for $5 each, and pocketed a tidy $7,500 profit. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he regrets that he didn't hold on until the following Monday, when the 
price climbed another dollar. "That's how fast the price was moving," exclaimed 
Bittner, president of a small Laguna Hills microchip distributor. 
</P>
<P>
Before long, Bittner may be joined by a legion of new speculators in computer 
chips. Both the Pacific Stock Exchange and the Twin Cities Board of Trade in 
Minneapolis have proposed trading futures contracts on dynamic random access 
memory chips beginning in early 1990. DRAMs are the most common type of chip 
used to store information in personal computers and an array of other 
electronics products. 
</P>
<P>
If the proposals are approved, the memory chips will become the first high-tech 
product ever traded on a futures market, which normally handles the likes of 
pork bellies, corn and crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Applying to CFTC 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of DRAM futures trading say it would help ease price fluctuations, 
benefiting chip makers and users. But the proposal has sparked a debate within 
the semiconductor industry, with skeptics arguing that the contracts won't 
catch on because chips are different from traditional commodities and can't be 
traded the same way. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, Pacific Stock Exchange officials say they will apply to the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission in Washington in the next few weeks for 
approval to launch a futures contract for 256-kilobyte and 1-megabit DRAMs. The 
Twin Cities board, a new exchange, also is seeking CFTC approval to begin 
trading chip futures and options. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked at the semiconductor industry and said 'this is a product that needs 
a futures market,' " said Jeffrey R. LeMunyon, vice president of operations for 
the Minneapolis board. 
</P>
<P>
Skeptics, however, say there are important differences between microchips and 
other commodities that make them poorly suited for futures trading. DRAMs, they 
say, are not an interchangeable commodity like wheat or potatoes. They are 
subject to rapid technological change and are finding their way into a growing 
number of products. Increasingly, they vary according to manufacturer, speed, 
design, density and packaging, critics say. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something I'd expect to come out of Las Vegas, not the stock 
exchange," said Charles M. Clough, president of El Segundo-based Wyle 
Laboratories, the West Coast's largest semiconductor distributor. "I think the 
exchange would do better to stick to things that have a true commodity flavor." 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the DRAM futures idea argue that the memory-chip business has the 
key characteristics of any commodity market. Futures trading will help reduce 
volatility in the market and ease the financial risk for chip makers and users. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the history of price fluctuations in DRAMs, the industry needs some 
kind of instrument to enable them to hedge their risks in price fluctuations," 
said Roy Berces, a Pacific Stock Exchange spokesman. "A futures contract is an 
age-old device for doing just that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Price Protection 
</P>
<P>
A futures contract is an agreement that allows a buyer to purchase a commodity 
at a fixed price at a future date. Producers and buyers of the commodities use 
the futures market to protect themselves against sharp price fluctuations. 
Speculators, who almost never take possession of the actual commodity, use the 
market to assume the risks of rising or falling prices in exchange for a chance 
to profit on those changes. 
</P>
<P>
A semiconductor maker, for example, might use the futures market to lock in a 
price for a batch of chips that it knows it won't be able to sell to its 
regular customers until six months from now. A computer maker, worried that a 
possible rise in chip prices could make its products more expensive to build in 
six months, could buy a futures contract to protect itself against a sudden 
price fluctuation. Speculators, in principle, would make the market more fluid 
by stepping in as additional buyers or sellers, depending on which way they 
think the market will go. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Stock Exchange has declined to release details of its proposal 
until it is submitted to the CFTC. The exchange has said it will set up a 
trading floor in San Francisco because of that city's proximity to Silicon 
Valley as well as its ties to Pacific Rim nations and investors there. 
</P>
<P>
The 551-member exchange, which currently operates equity trading floors in San 
Francisco and Los Angeles and an options trading floor in San Francisco, began 
drafting plans for a DRAM futures exchange in early 1988, in the midst of a 
severe shortage of memory chips. The shortage hurt many computer firms that had 
to scramble to get enough DRAMs to keep their production lines going. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Stock Exchange officials said futures contracts would have eased the 
effects of last year's chip shortage by enabling computer makers to purchase 
DRAM contracts with locked-in prices. A futures market also would have 
addressed the reverse situation in 1985 and 1986, when semiconductor companies 
suffered badly from a glut of memory chips and falling prices, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Problems for Apple 
</P>
<P>
"There is a large structural inefficiency that exists in the semiconductor 
industry," said Bill Tai, vice president of marketing for Memory Clearinghouse 
Co. in San Francisco, a business formed last year to help the Pacific Exchange 
develop the DRAM futures proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The presence of an active "gray market" in DRAMs is evidence of the need for a 
different type of distribution system in the semiconductor industry, Tai said. 
The gray market is a collection of hundreds of electronics distributors and 
brokers that buy and sell chips that are obtained from computer makers and 
other sources. 
</P>
<P>
"The gray market now serves as an inventory buffer to absorb the swings in 
supply and demand," Tai said. But the price of DRAMs bought and sold in the 
gray market is not organized in any fashion, and buyers and sellers have no way 
of knowing if they are getting the best price possible. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Schwetje, a semiconductor analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., 
agreed that the futures exchange seems like a good idea. She notes that Apple 
Computer ran into big problems last year when it overbought 1-megabit DRAM 
chips, fearing a short supply. 
</P>
<P>
"Apple took on a big inventory of chips and when the price fell, they had to 
make their computers with higher-priced DRAMS, while their competitors bought 
less costly chips," Schwetje said. 
</P>
<P>
Apple and several other computer makers, including AST Research of Irvine and 
Sun Microsystems of Mountain View, Calif., blamed the DRAM problem as a major 
reason for a big drop in earnings earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
A big question for the San Francisco and Minneapolis exchanges is whether they 
can win the support of chip producers and their large customers, particularly 
the personal computer makers. "It is critically important to have their 
involvement," said Philip McBride Johnson, a former CFTC chairman and New York 
attorney who is advising the Pacific Stock Exchange. "Futures contracts don't 
succeed unless they become commonplace tools in the industry." 
</P>
<P>
Although the exchange said it has had extensive discussions with the 
electronics industry, several chip manufacturers and PC makers said they knew 
too little about the proposal to comment. And a few said they would not support 
the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from Texas Instruments, Hitachi America and Hewlett-Packard have gone 
on record saying they would not participate in the futures market. They say 
that chip makers and their customers can better deal with the problem of market 
volatility by themselves. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confident It Can Work 
</P>
<P>
"We really don't view DRAMs as a true commodity," said Stan Victor, a spokesman 
for Texas Instruments, one of three U.S. producers of memory chips. "Rather 
than using a financial instrument, we are addressing the volatility of the 
memory market through a combination of efforts" with customers. 
</P>
<P>
The Texas chip maker has worked out deals with some of its largest customers in 
which they are making advance payments for DRAMs. Texas Instruments is using 
those funds to build additional manufacturing facilities and boost its future 
production capacity. The customers, in turn, are being guaranteed a future 
supply of DRAMs in case of a shortage. 
</P>
<P>
Another question for the exchanges is whether they can spark enough interest 
among speculators. 
</P>
<P>
"Futures markets require hedgers," said Johnson, the former CFTC chairman. "The 
market works sort of like Lloyds of London. Some people buy insurance and bet 
that the ship won't sink, while others buy it betting that it will." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a partner in the New York law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; 
Flom, has practiced commodities law for 25 years and said he is confident a 
futures market for computer chips can work. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many different products now being traded in the futures market 
that nothing surprises me anymore," Johnson said. "People once wondered whether 
you could trade perishable items such as cattle or eggs, and they're doing 
fine." Meanwhile, speculators say they will be watching the DRAMs futures 
proposal, which would formalize a money-making idea that some savvy investors 
already have seized upon. 
</P>
<P>
During last year's DRAM shortage, "people who knew nothing about chips were 
trying to buy orders up to 1 million," said Bittner, the Laguna Hills 
distributor. "These were people like stockbrokers and accountants who wanted to 
buy DRAMs and hold them until the price went up."

ARCHITECTURE : LEVIN GIVES NEW LEASE ON LIFE TO LANDMARKS

<TEXT>
<P>
When architect Myron Hunt died in 1952, he left behind a 50-year-old legacy of 
landmarks including the Pasadena Rose Bowl, the Ambassador Hotel, the 
Huntington Library and master plans for three local colleges. The work of the 
New England-born architect bore a reticence and honesty that, one historian 
says, made him appear as a puritan in the architectural Babylon of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Many of his elegant designs have recently been renovated. But others, like the 
Ambassador Hotel, are threatened with destruction. 
</P>
<P>
"As L.A. runs out of unbuilt space we have to think hard about recycling what 
we have for economic and aesthetic reasons," architect Brenda Levin said. "Now 
there is a new appreciation of saving buildings to form a new urban identity 
out of the old and the new." 
</P>

Levin leads the field in the increasingly important movement to renovate and 
recycle Los Angeles' architectural heritage. Her landmark restorations, 
including the Wiltern Theater on Wilshire Boulevard and the downtown Oviatt 
Building, have won a number of historic preservation awards. She has also 
renovated two historic L.A. markets, the Grand Central on Broadway and the 
Chapman on 6th Street. 
</P>
<P>
But two recently completed projects illustrate the breadth of Levin's talent in 
giving new life to old buildings. 
</P>
<P>
At the high end of the architectural spectrum is her renovation of architect 
Myron Hunt's 1938 Thorne Hall at Occidental College. The low end is represented 
by Levin's skillful adaptation of an old downtown warehouse into a residential 
hotel and day-care center for homeless women. 
</P>
<P>
Levin's $2.1-million renovation of Thorne Hall gave her challenges typically 
faced by designers striving to renovate historic buildings without compromising 
their classic character. 
</P>
<P>
"Thorne Hall is one of Hunt's purest Palladian buildings," she explained. "Its 
beautiful Beaux Arts colonnade closes the western end of the main campus axis, 
and gives it its great sense of calm. I had to try and modernize the hall's 
interior without cheapening its relationship to the dignity of its exterior." 
</P>
<P>
Hunt linked Thorne Hall's landscaped forecourt, monumental porch and wide lobby 
to the shoebox-shaped auditorium within, culminating in the proscenium stage at 
the far end. Altering the character of any part of this progression could 
easily have destroyed the unity of the design. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic problem was acoustical," Levin explained. "The hall's sound quality, 
designed in an age when the science of acoustics was as yet unborn, simply 
didn't measure up to the demands of a modern orchestra and an audience attuned 
to hi-fi stereo recordings." To create a better acoustical environment, Levin 
devised an "eyebrow" of sound baffles that projects out over the proscenium 
apron to bounce the music out to the 900 seats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Daring Departure 
</P>
<P>
Levin's one daring departure from Hunt's architectural reticence is a vividly 
colored carpet, that flows from the lobby down the aisles like a spill of 
painted flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Levin argued that Thorne Hall's auditorium, with its dark-stained wooden 
wainscotting and matching ceiling, "seemed a little somber for modern tastes. I 
felt an element of flamboyance was needed, to perk up the atmosphere. In Hunt's 
sober context the carpet may startle you at first, but I think it gives the eye 
a needed shock." 
</P>
<P>
Carl Vance, an Occidental College vice president, said the faculty was very 
pleased with Levin's Thorne Hall renovation. 
</P>
<P>
"We admired Brenda's subtlety in dealing with a historic building," he said. 
"She was assured, caring, but not intimidated. She knew what needed to be done, 
and carried it out with a sure and sensitive hand." 
</P>
<P>
The conversion of a three-story commercial building on Skid Row into a 
residential hotel for homeless women presented Levin with a very different 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shelter From the Hard Life 
</P>
<P>
The Downtown Women's Center on Los Angeles Street provides small self-contained 
apartments for 48 women seeking shelter from the hard life of the streets. In 
addition, a new day-care annex designed by Levin serves another 50-60 women 
daily with a place to shelter, shower, have a hot meal, do laundry and catch a 
few hours of safe sleep. 
</P>
<P>
The day-care annex, with its lively color-tiled exterior walls, leaps out like 
a sign of life in the shabby and dangerous district. Its architecture is tough 
but playful, offering an oasis of hope for homeless women who often find 
themselves the ultimate victims in the vicious Skid Row pecking order. 
</P>
<P>
"We get women in here who are really tortured, by street criminals and their 
own private hallucinations," said Jill Halverson, founder and director of the 
Downtown Women's Center. "It's important our tenants feel secure at all times 
within the building, given the violence of the surroundings." 
</P>
<P>
Her success with historic restoration and architectural recycling has brought 
Levin respect, but it has also typecast her practice. She feels increasingly 
confined by the label of "restoration architect." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Branded a Preservationist' 
</P>
<P>
"To some extent I've been branded as a preservationist," she said. "That's made 
it hard to crossover into the realm of new architecture with no recycling 
component -- but it's beginning to happen, thank God!" 
</P>
<P>
Two projects currently on Levin's drafting tables represent a major shift 
toward non-preservation design. 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena Civic Center West development, a mixed-use project including 
shops, offices and apartments facing the historic Pasadena City Hall, will 
match the architecture of its neighbors without aping their style. A totally 
modern Levin design is displayed in the proposed Buena Vista Pumping Station 
commissioned by the Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power. 
</P>
<P>
"After nine years in practice, I feel I'm finally earning my spurs as an 
architect for all seasons," Levin said. "For a while there I feared I might be 
considered too 'sensitive' to design non-preservation projects." 
</P>
<P>
Levin is happy that clients are beginning to trust her with a wider range of 
projects, where she can begin to bring different design skills into play. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether I'm restoring old buildings or designing new ones, my experience in 
renovation and recycling has given me an awareness of the value of our 
architectural heritage, that can create a vital continuity between our city's 
first and second eras of growth."

THEY'VE MADE LIVES HERE. NOW, WATCHING THE TUMULT IN CHINA, IMMIGRANTS RECALL 
THEIR OWN HAZARDOUS PASSAGES

<P>
He is an energetic man of 66, with silky white hair, mischievous eyes and a 
voice that erupts in a laugh so intense one is sure its force is meant to 
subdue some rising pain. He is replaying the years since he fled Iran in 1980 
-- escaping a firing squad for the third time. 
</P>
<P>
"What I am really missing is my 12,000 volumes of books, which I left in 
Tehran," says Dr. Hassan Shahbaz, one of Iran's leading Persian literary 
scholars and broadcast personalities before the fall of the Shah and the 
Islamic revolution that brought the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to power. 
</P>
<P>
"They were selected books, a large number of them offered to me by the 
authors," says Shahbaz, who teaches Persian literature at UCLA, and, out of his 
Westwood condominium, edits and publishes Rahavad, a quarterly journal of 
Persian literature and Iranian culture. 
</P>
<P>
The most important works in the library of his Tehran mansion were not books at 
all. They were "original, written manuscripts . . . from the time of Homer to 
the present." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They Are All Gone' 
</P>
<P>
His voice fails for a moment. "For years, I've been throughout the world 
collecting those books. I was writing a dictionary of (Persian) literature that 
was supposed to be in 20 volumes. I was working on the seventh volume when the 
revolution began. And, of course, those books were my sources. But they are all 
gone." 
</P>
<P>
What were the "crimes" he was charged with in Iran? 
</P>
<P>
"My cook," he answers, "had joined the revolutionary guard. My house was in a 
neighborhood of mansions whose owners had fled. But I stayed. The cook thought 
it was time to occupy my mansion. He formed a file accusing me of many treasons 
to the Islamic government against Khomeini, against Islam, against the 
revolutionary mind and attitude," he explains with a weary smile. 
</P>
<P>
"But I was innocent," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Each time he was brought before a revolutionary committee for trial, he was 
freed. "Finally, a friend, a professor of theology who was a member of the 
revolutionary court, told me: 'You better leave the country because finally 
something might happen to you. They will shoot you.' " 
</P>
<P>
And so Shahbaz became one of the world's dislocated, the millions who now watch 
the political turmoil in China with particularly pained and knowing eyes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fleeing Persecution 
</P>
<P>
Whether they are refugees pushed to the United States from their homelands by 
fear of political persecution, or immigrants pulled to America in the belief 
that they are free here to pursue happiness as they choose to define it, they 
understand the social forces that can compel someone to abandon a homeland; 
they understand the anguish of separation. 
</P>
<P>
Shahbaz arrived in New York "in early April, 1980, without a penny. I made a 
collect telephone call," he laughs, "to my daughter." She had been studying in 
the United States and is now the news editor of the Persian service for the 
Voice of America, Shahbaz says. He also has a son, who holds a Ph.D. in 
neurochemistry and teaches at a university in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
The Persian scholar points to the books surrounding him in his home office. 
Among them are dozens of his translations of Western literary classics -- 
including his Iranian best seller, "Gone With the Wind," in Farsi. 
</P>
<P>
"All my life I have studied. . . . And what I have gained through reading those 
12,000 books is that I am able to start from zero under any circumstances," he 
says with vinegar in his voice. "Under any circumstances, at any age, I can 
build a new life because I feel in myself strong and young and vigorous." 
</P>
<P>
Then, as gracious as he is passionate, he begs forgiveness for the clutter of 
file boxes and books around his house and offers a guest tea and chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the pro-democracy demonstrators in China massacred in Tian An Men Square 
or rounded up afterward in a crackdown by the Communist government, then shot 
-- notices outside the People's High Court in Beijing showed big red checks 
beside the names of those executed -- Charles Penman had no death threat 
hanging over his head when he left his country. 
</P>
<P>
Nor, like many Chinese fleeing their government's crackdown on dissidents, did 
Penman have to wait for days in a queue for a visa ultimately denied. He did 
not have to escape through an underground railroad, as some Chinese are 
reportedly doing now. 
</P>
<P>
He bought a ticket, got on a plane and flew from his native Costa Rica into Los 
Angeles in November, 1966. 
</P>
<P>
"Why did I come to America? I have to quote the Marquis de Lafayette: 'The 
moment I heard of America, I loved her.' " 
</P>
<P>
His sentiments are those of the typical immigrant. His background is not so 
typical. 
</P>
<P>
"My biological father was Teodoro Picado," the president of Costa Rica from 
1944-48. Picado died in 1960, but not without acknowledging -- from the day of 
his birth -- that Penman was, he says, Picado's illegitimate son. But it was 
his mother and brother-in-law, Jose Luis Ortiz, a prominent broadcaster in 
Costa Rica, who raised him. 
</P>
<P>
Penman began working in radio as a teen-ager and could have had a successful 
career in broadcasting in his native land, he says. But he did not want a 
career built on nepotism. He wanted to be sure he could make it on his own, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
He thought about studying in the Soviet Union, just for the "adventure of it." 
But his family nixed that idea, saying it could jeopardize his future were he 
ever to consider politics. (His father, Picado, was a staunch anti-communist.) 
When he told them he was going to New York, they said they wouldn't give him 
any money. But if he ever wanted to come back home, "Just pick up the phone, 
call collect and we'll send you a one-way ticket back to Costa Rica." 
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Penman arrived in Los Angeles "with no job. And I didn't speak 
English." The little money he had ran out in a few days. He was thrown out of 
his hotel. "I found myself with no clothes and no money. I slept in the streets 
of Hollywood for a few nights." 
</P>
<P>
Then he found a job at a gas station doing janitorial work. At the end of the 
day, "I'd fake my leaving work to go home, wait for darkness, come back and 
sleep in the restroom. . . ." This was not the America he dreamed of in Costa 
Rica. 
</P>
<P>
A man of compact build, elegant manners and nervous habits, Penman puffs on 
cigarettes as if, indeed, each drag were his last before facing a firing squad. 
He fidgets at a cafeteria dining table near City Hall and trembles slightly as 
he speaks of his dead mother . . . the dead president . . . the past. 
</P>
<P>
He is 42 now. After cleaning houses, working in a plastics factory, hawking 
fish wholesale and selling used cars for six months, he is a Spanish translator 
and a part-time writer with two daughters and a second wife. 
</P>
<P>
Does he ever wish he made that phone call to his family in Costa Rica? 
</P>
<P>
He is silent for a moment, and stares, his eyes magnified behind thick glasses 
in fashionably large frames. "I did go to that pay phone many times," he 
answers finally. " And I did ask the operator to connect me, and I heard the 
phone ringing, but I'd hang up. The last time I hung up, I said I might be 
wasting the greatest opportunity of my life to learn about Charles. If I do 
this, I may never forgive myself." 
</P>
<P>
If he has regrets, if a sense of dislocation remains, Penman has made peace 
with it. "I have learned here in 20 some years what I think I would have never 
learned down there in Costa Rica in 100 years. . . . This is the most powerful 
country in the world. You are 
</P>
<P>
taken out of your environment and faced with a different language, culture, 
approach about life. In fact, you become what the early Europeans became when 
they first came to America -- a pioneer. That's what makes America great. You 
come here to play the game, not to watch the game from the sidelines." 
</P>
<P>
Leticia DeLeon is a Central American for whom the United States will never be 
home, no matter how grateful she is to be safe here from Guatemala's death 
squads. 
</P>
<P>
Formerly a science teacher in Villa Nueva, near Guatemala City, DeLeon now runs 
the Guatemalan Information Center in Los Angeles. But her income in the United 
States has come primarily from work as a domestic. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to get a job in a factory, " she explains one day in the GIC office, 
"but with no experience, no references it is impossible." She takes a tissue to 
her nose -- she has a bad cold -- and turns her head in profile. It is a regal 
silhouette. Her smooth brown skin and her angular features, accentuated by hair 
pulled tautly behind her head, conjure images of a Mayan princess -- one in 
blue cotton slacks and sneakers now. Her sneakered feet, crossed at the ankles 
under a chair, wiggle anxiously as she speaks. 
</P>
<P>
She worked as a housekeeper for a family when she came to the United States in 
1983, DeLeon says. One day, the family's secretary mistakenly accused her of 
some error and began yelling at her. "I hadn't done anything wrong," and even 
if she had, "that was no way to speak to another person -- it certainly wasn't 
the secretary's place. When she screamed in my face, I said: 'My God, I'm not 
going to accept this.' " So she talked back and lost her job. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Less Than Human' 
</P>
<P>
DeLeon, who is 42, married and the mother of three, says the loss of 
self-esteem is one of the most painful adjustments many educated people must 
face when they leave their country and start life from scratch. "You feel so 
humiliated." People think immigrants are "less than human" because of the 
language barrier or cultural differences, she says. 
</P>
<P>
America is a "cold, difficult" place, she says. She misses her extended family 
of relatives and friends in Guatemala. But she had to leave. 
</P>
<P>
She was standing in her kitchen "warming up spaghetti," when relatives told her 
the country's plainclothes death squad, La Judicial, was looking for her. She 
had been among those in her town protesting poor housing conditions, an 
inadequate water supply and government corruption. 
</P>
<P>
After hiding in the countryside and later Guatemala City, she escaped to 
Mexico. "I liked it there, they spoke Spanish, the culture was the same. I had 
a job teaching psychology at Puebla U." 
</P>
<P>
But her parents, who had been caring for her children in Guatemala, refused to 
send them to her if she stayed in Mexico. Mexico was politically unstable, they 
told her. She had to go to the United States, they said. There, they knew she 
and the children would be safe. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted my children," she said. "So I took the bus to Tijuana. Guatemala is 
such a beautiful country. I miss the beach where we would bring fruit and 
sandwiches and spend the day. I miss the trees. I miss the land." 
</P>
<P>
"Animals that wander must adapt or die," wrote philosopher Alfred North 
Whitehead. Nega Araia did not escape the murderous wrath of Ethiopian soldiers 
in Eritrea Province to waste away here from melancholy -- no matter how 
difficult life in America has proved to be. 
</P>
<P>
"Here I see the law enforced without any favoritism." In Eritrea, where 
Africa's longest-running war has been raging for 25 years against the Ethiopian 
government, the policies of "an African Hitler," -- Ethiopian president 
Mengistu Haile Mariam -- caused the death of Araia's 13-year-old adopted 
brother, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"He was shot in the street, his body riddled with 30 bullets," Araia says 
stiffly. Days later, Ethiopian soldiers warned Araia, also 13 at the time, that 
he was next. 
</P>
<P>
A steady flow of neighbors use Araia's phone in his small Santa Monica 
apartment. They are immigrants, too, some Eritrean, others Ethiopians. "I am 
very close to Ethiopians. I hate the current Ethiopian government, but not the 
people. But I am not Ethiopian. I am Eritrean," he says adamantly. 
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia forcibly annexed Eritrea in 1962. Fighting was sporadic between the 
Eritrean resistance forces and Ethiopian government until a Marxist junta, 
calling itself the Dirgue, overthrew Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974 and 
initiated a brutal campaign to collectivize the nation's farms and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Don't Waste a Bullet' 
</P>
<P>
"My mother did not want me to leave the country," Araia says. "But she did not 
want me to die, either. I was crying that I had to leave. But the Ethiopians 
were merciless. I knew an army officer, a good friend of my family." There had 
been direct orders for the Dirgue, the soldier told him, "that every bullet 
should land on people's bodies. Don't waste a bullet. If there are 4 million 
bullets, they should hit 4 million people." The population of Eritrea, a 
mountainous territory the size of Mississippi, is 4 million. 
</P>
<P>
At night, past the cross fire of Ethiopian and Eritrean forces, the 13-year-old 
Araia stole into the Sudan. When he was 17, he entered Italy with forged 
documents. All his life, he had wanted to do "something in the sciences." In 
Rome, he worked as a housekeeper and "read a lot about America." 
</P>
<P>
His six brothers and sisters had, by now, fled Eritrea and were in Sweden. But 
Araia was intent on going to America. He finally did in 1986. "I saw America as 
a multiracial society, " says Araia, now 31 and the nighttime receptionist at a 
condominium. 
</P>
<P>
The discrimination he has encountered in the United States has been 
disillusioning, he says. But the country is not "paradise or hell." 
</P>
<P>
He mentions that, as he speaks, one of his brothers has just graduated from 
medical school in Sweden. Would he have been better off had he gone there? 
</P>
<P>
He repeats that he likes the cultural mix of America. He likes African American 
culture in particular, he says. "I love jazz. . . . I love Bobby Brown." His 
goal now "is to go to Northrup College in a few months. It is time I become a 
professional. I am getting old." 
</P>
<P>
Pari Abasalti Mirhashem has some advice for the 40,000 Chinese students now 
studying at American universities and fearful of returning home: 
</P>
<P>
"It is better if one can stay in their country and fight. But sometimes people 
have a better chance of challenging a regime from the outside," says Mirhashem, 
a journalist and Iranian refugee who was her country's first female editor and 
a congresswoman who represented Tehran. "That is why I am so upset when I heard 
people cannot get visas to leave China." 
</P>
<P>
Out of their Westwood apartment, she and her husband, Houshang Mirhashem, 
publish Rah-E-Zendegi, a Farsi-language Iranian monthly. 
</P>
<P>
While the phone constantly rings in the living room, which doubles as an 
office, the animated woman of 53 -- a touch of blue shadow on her eyelids, a 
reddish cast to her light brown hair -- explains the "crimes" for which she had 
to leave Iran after the fall of the Shah in January, 1979. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Am a Nationalist' 
</P>
<P>
"I am a moderate. I am a nationalist. I am not pro a person. I am for my 
country. . . . I knew that a bunch of ayatollahs could not rule the country." 
As the editor of Ettella'at, Iran's "first leading women's magazine," Mirhashem 
says, she refused an order from the periodical's editor-in-chief to run a 
picture of Khomeini on the cover with Iranian women in Moslem dress. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew those women, they were very modern people, but they wanted to have a 
position with Khomeini's (regime)." They were willing to be photographed with 
Khomeini out of "self-interest." 
</P>
<P>
"I am a Moslem, I am religious, but at the same time I believe politics should 
be separate from religion. I left my country because I did not want to do 
something against my principle." 
</P>
<P>
But, she says, "that was the beginning of nostalgia in my life." She had heard 
the sentiment expressed in poetry and songs, "but I had never felt what it 
means." 
</P>
<P>
Weeks after she and her husband left Tehran, she sat in a New York hotel 
reading an article "about what you do when something bad happens to you -- if 
you lose your job, if you lose someone you love, if you lose your money. But 
what can one do when they have lost their country?"

HARSH APPRAISAL OF L.A. PROGRAM; 
</P>
<P>
FUZZY GOALS, FAVORITISM MARK MINORITY CONTRACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN F. BUNTING and RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a black Los Angeles businesswoman who owned a small, family clothing store, 
Erma Nelson, 48, thought she was an ideal candidate for a new program designed 
to "substantially increase" the percentage of city contracts awarded to 
minority and female entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
So three years ago, excited by her success with an Olympics gift stand, Nelson 
filled out the necessary paper work to qualify for the Minority and Women-Owned 
Business Enterprise Program and began contacting major concessionaires at Los 
Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, who hoped to get a shop in a busy terminal, made repeated calls to 
airport contractors -- all to no avail. None, she said, was returned, and 
eventually she was forced to put aside her quest. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Nelson was not surprised by reports that the wife of a prominent 
black congressman and several others with strong political connections to City 
Hall had succeeded in landing airport concession contracts where she had 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's who you know," Nelson said. "This is nothing but a racket." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson is not alone in her harsh appraisal. Six years after the program was 
first announced by Mayor Tom Bradley, it is under attack from minority and 
female professionals, City Council members and even some officials in the 
mayor's office. 
</P>
<P>
The critics say the program has been overwrought with bureaucracy while falling 
short of its promise to direct millions of dollars in city contracts to 
minorities and women. Instead, critics complain, contracts have gone to a 
favored, select group of politically connected entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
"Somewhere (beyond) the noble goals there are serious questions about 
implementation that have not been adequately addressed," said Councilman 
Michael Woo. "How do we know we aren't just providing benefits to a few 
individuals?" 
</P>
<P>
City officials, conceding the program is in trouble, are trying to re-evaluate 
the effort and spell out -- surprisingly, for the first time -- just how it 
should work, who should benefit and what office should take charge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Audit Began Last year 
</P>
<P>
The principal vehicle for this reassessment is an audit of the program started 
quietly last year by the city's chief administrative officer. The review was 
initiated by council members who had received complaints that minority 
contracts were going only to a favored few. 
</P>
<P>
The audit was accelerated sharply last month, officials have told The Times, in 
the wake of revelations about airport concession contracts awarded through the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Airports approved lucrative gift and food concessions 
contracts for a group of politically well-connected minorities and women, many 
of whom have had little involvement in running the concessions. 
</P>
<P>
The contracts were given to such influential minority partners as Betty Dixon, 
the wife of Rep. Julian Dixon (D-Los Angeles); Los Angeles Urban League 
President John Mack and Bishop H. H. Brookins, a longtime community religious 
leader and Bradley supporter who helped launch the mayor's start in politics 
nearly three decades ago. All have defended their contracts as legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
In a sweeping political gesture, Bradley in 1983 ordered all city departments 
to become "fully committed" to developing programs to "substantially increase" 
the share of city contracts going to minority- and women-owned businesses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Disadvantaged' Companies 
</P>
<P>
The plan called for city departments, which contract for everything from 
flipping burgers to building sewers, to give a greater share of their business 
to minority and women firms and encourage majority, Anglo-owned contractors to 
share a slice of business with these "disadvantaged" companies. 
</P>
<P>
What Bradley's executive order boasted in theory, it lacked in nuts-and-bolts 
guidelines. The city program allows each of the more than two dozen departments 
to implement its own plan. The departments set different goals for minority 
participation, different qualifying standards for firms and different 
procedures for monitoring the programs. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the mayor's office, which oversees the program, does not collect 
complete information from all the various departments, nor does it have a 
systematic way of reviewing what information it has. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, no one at City Hall can say exactly how many minority-business 
contracts there are, what they are worth and who holds them. The mayor's office 
estimated that for the five years ending in June, 1987, about 8% of $3.8 
billion in city contracts went to minority and women firms. But Wilfred 
Marshall, who oversees the mayor's minority business program, cautioned that 
the numbers "may not be good" because of reporting problems and lack of 
auditing. 
</P>
<P>
Compounding the confusion are federal programs that, unlike the city program, 
require minority and women partners to serve a direct management role in 
operations so they can one day compete for government contracts on their own. 
In cases like the airport, maintained with both federal and city funds, there 
is confusion whether the stricter federal or less stringent city rules should 
apply. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Help for Whom? 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the program never specified what type of minority- and 
women-owned firms it was supposed to help. Some city officials say struggling 
small businesses that need a boost should be the prime target. Others say 
large, well-established firms -- or even wealthy individuals -- should be 
allowed to participate in minority contracts, so long as they qualify as 
minority firms. 
</P>
<P>
"That's (a) basic philosophical dilemma," said J. P. Ellman, a City Council 
legislative analyst who is reviewing the program. "And we don't know what the 
answer is." 
</P>
<P>
The sweeping review by the city's administrative officer, expected to be 
completed by the fall, will provide the first detailed examination of a program 
that critics contend is vulnerable to abuse because of fuzzy goals, 
inconsistent guidelines and poor monitoring. The audit will address the lack of 
reliable citywide data to monitor the program's progress and examine the 
hodgepodge of regulations that vary from department to department, said Stephen 
Wong, the assistant administrative officer overseeing the audit. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the audit will attempt to determine whether a small number of 
minority firms are getting the bulk of the business. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, the businesswoman passed over by major concessionaires at the airport, 
said she thinks the city's program does little for small business owners. 
Nelson suffered a setback last year when she closed her South Los Angeles 
clothing store. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Record of Calls 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the main airport concessionaire, Duty Free Shoppers Group Ltd. 
Partnership, responded by saying the company had no record of Nelson's calls. 
But he added that Nelson may have called after the firm had selected its 
minority partners. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, a Teletype supervisor for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, 
said that the prominent minority leaders who received the concession contracts 
needed assistance "like I need a hole in the head." 
</P>
<P>
Criticism of the program is not new. 
</P>
<P>
Concerns were raised in connection with the minority business program during a 
running City Hall debate last year when several close allies of Bradley -- 
including airport concessionaires Brookins and attorney Andy M. Camacho -- were 
added to a team of developers seeking the contract for a hotly contested, 
$200-million expansion of the Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
The contract was controversial because, at the time the City Council selected 
the Brookins-Camacho team, the proposal as presented would have cost the city 
$3 million a year more than another bid preferred by city staff members. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said neither he nor his office was involved in the selection. 
</P>
<P>
Several months later, in November, nearly 100 black, Latino and female 
professionals came forward at an extraordinary City Hall public hearing on the 
city's program. At the meeting -- called in response to mounting criticism 
about the program -- speaker after speaker vented frustration. Many of the 
minorities and women who attended the hearing shared their own personal 
experiences about how city departments had resisted their efforts to compete 
for contracts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Five-Year Wait 
</P>
<P>
Donald A. Harvey, a black Beverly Hills businessman, said that Harbor 
Department officials told him last year they would have no business 
opportunities for minorities for the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people here are complaining about this issue of opening the doors and 
participating," Harvey said. "It just cannot be done." 
</P>
<P>
(Harbor official Lonnie Tang subsequently said the remark was made "in a 
general sense" to minority entrepreneurs regarding commercial and retail 
opportunities for any business in the port area. He said the Harbor encourages 
minority participation, but that contracts in retail and commercial areas are 
tied up in long-term commitments). 
</P>
<P>
Charles E. Dickerson, president of the John M. Langston Bar Assn., also 
testified at the hearing, complaining that few black lawyers in Los Angeles 
have been successful in their attempts to get bond counsel or legal work from 
the Community Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
"To a certain extent, the old boy network continues," Dickerson said in an 
interview last week. "Those (minority and women lawyers) who are getting the 
work were allowed in as essentially tokens so that . . . at least the 
appearance of meeting the goals (of the program) could occur." 
</P>
<P>
After listening to the complaints at the hearing, Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky 
called for the city to revamp the mayor's program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Pet Peeve' 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky, a frequent Bradley critic, said the minority business program has 
"been used to advance the interests of specific individuals occasionally and 
not to advance the causes of minority-owned businesses. This has been one of my 
pet peeves about the program. It's not what you know, but who you know that 
gets you in." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley acknowledges some concerns about the program. Earlier this month, 
before revelations about Dixon and her partners obtaining the airport contract 
became public, the mayor issued a letter endorsing the chief administrative 
officer's audit and calling for reforms that will "guard against sham 
businesses that act only as fronts." 
</P>
<P>
"The city must take every necessary step to guarantee that city contracts are 
available to all interested businesses, not just those few who have learned the 
ropes around City Hall," Bradley wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Mayoral aides, though, say the weaknesses in the program are not entirely their 
fault. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall, the Bradley aide who oversees the program, said that in most cases 
prime contractors -- not the mayor's office -- choose minority subcontractors 
on city jobs. He also said that many minority businesses do not utilize his 
office to understand the city contracting system or develop contacts with prime 
contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about complaints that the program is weighted in favor of firms who 
already have been successful in obtaining city business, he responded: 
</P>
<P>
"Don't blame me. This whole world operates on relationships. This is not about 
fairness. Business is not about fairness. Business is about taking advantage of 
what is there to take advantage of."

RARE ALLIANCES FORMED FOR STATE FISCAL ACCORD; 
</P>
<P>
URGENCY OF HEALTH, EDUCATION AND TRANSIT NEEDS BROUGHT NEW ALIGNMENT OF POWERS 
IN SACRAMENTO

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A rare convergence of interests by the most powerful players in California's 
business and political establishment led to the historic agreement on a 
10-year, $18.5-billion transportation plan and the biggest rewriting of state 
financing laws since Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
The series of votes late Friday ratifying the agreement by lopsided majorities 
in the Assembly and Senate challenged two of Sacramento's best-known 
stereotypes -- a confrontational governor who until now prided himself in 
wielding his veto power like a truncheon, and a Legislature so divided by 
internal politics and self-interest that it could accomplish little of lasting 
importance. 
</P>
<P>
After it was over, Gov. George Deukmejian, who will not run for reelection next 
year when his second term expires, was able to say proudly: "We've done what 
the people have sent us up here to do on these kinds of major problems." 
</P>
<P>
The governor and the Legislature were able to break these old patterns, many 
believe, because they were confronted with issues that were simply too urgent 
to be swept under the table. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, the governor and Legislature were forced to meet a midnight 
Friday legislative deadline in order to use a portion of a $2.5-billion tax 
windfall on financially troubled health and welfare programs during the current 
fiscal year, which began Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Also prodding them to act were dozens of business, transportation, health, 
welfare, education and other groups. For months they have been pressing state 
leaders to do something about the state's declining and congested 
transportation system and the ever-tightening financial noose put on state 
government by a constitutional spending limit approved by voters in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
A short list of groups supporting one of the measures enacted Friday night -- a 
proposed constitutional amendment to substantially repeal the spending limit -- 
included the California Chamber of Commerce, state universities, coalitions of 
cities and counties, the California Taxpayers Assn., the League of Women Voters 
and doctor, hospital and health groups. 
</P>
<P>
Pushing from another direction were land developers, building trades unions, 
pavers and contractors, and numerous corporations who wanted the Legislature to 
enact a sales tax increase to raise money for road construction and mass 
transit projects . 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Results of Accord 
</P>
<P>
The result was a series of bills that, voters willing, would: 
</P>
<P>
* Create an $18.5-billion, 10-year transportation and mass transit funding plan 
based on a 9-cent-a-gallon increase in the gasoline tax, a sharp increase in 
truck weight fees and three separate $1-billion bond issues. 
</P>
<P>
* Place on the June, 1990, ballot a constitutional amendment to relax the limit 
on government spending and repeal key provisions of Proposition 98, thus 
freeing up billions of dollars for health, welfare and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
* Provide for a two-year, $1.4-billion public school and community college 
funding program highlighted by a plan that will provide extra financial aid to 
rural and suburban school districts who believe they have been shortchanged in 
the past by funding formulas weighted toward big-city districts. 
</P>
<P>
"The governor and our legislative leaders have achieved a near miracle by 
fitting together all the pieces needed to make the budget work," said Kirk 
West, president of the California Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Until the successful conclusion of the negotiations, Deukmejian had a 
well-deserved reputation as a rigid, combative governor who seemed to take 
pride in the nickname legislators had given him for his unyielding style -- 
"the Iron Duke." For years, Democrats, with comfortable majorities in both the 
Assembly and Senate, had mimicked Deukmejian's style, at times becoming just as 
intransigent on important issues as the governor himself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Battle Weary Crew 
</P>
<P>
Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) said one of the 
reasons the talks with the governor went so well was that "everyone is war 
weary from previous battles." 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers from both parties said they sensed that Deukmejian was drawn to the 
negotiating table by his strong desire to solve the state's transportation 
crisis before leaving office. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he recognized he had a unique opportunity," Assemblyman Richard Katz 
(D-Sylmar) said. "He could have been looked upon as the governor who did less 
for roads than (former governor) Jerry Brown, or he could be part of the group 
that got California back on track. I think he made a conscious choice to do the 
latter." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman William P. Baker (R-Danville) said Deukmejian, without an eye 
toward reelection, was free to look at the "big picture" rather than focus on 
the point of view of those who helped elect him. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just that it wasn't going to get done unless someone grabbed it by the 
horns, and he decided to do that," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, despite his reputation as a stubborn bargainer, abandoned his 
longtime resistance to changing the Gann spending limit and also backed away 
from his insistence that the gasoline tax not be raised without the issue being 
placed directly before the voters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No 'Absolutes' 
</P>
<P>
"He had more of a sense of wanting to solve the problem and being more open to 
other peoples' points of view of how big the problem was," Katz said. "He 
didn't paint himself into a corner and refuse to budge. There were no 
absolutes." 
</P>
<P>
Roberti said Deukmejian seemed "much more relaxed" than he had in past 
negotiations. "It was almost like talking with George Deukmejian when you knew 
him as a state senator," Roberti said. 
</P>
<P>
But others say the real key to the deal struck Friday was the fact that health 
and welfare programs traditionally championed by Democrats stood to be the big 
losers if the Legislature did not modify Proposition 98 to permit use of the 
$2.5-billion windfall, which otherwise would have been given to schools and 
rebated to taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
"Proposition 98 locked in an ever-increasing portion of the budget for 
education at the expense of the welfare programs," said Assemblyman Pat Nolan 
(R-Glendale). "The Democrats had to be more flexible because Republicans would 
rather the money go to education than to welfare. They had to be more 
reasonable. They didn't make outlandish demands and threaten to hold their 
breath if they didn't get their way." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Steve Peace (D-La Mesa), who participated in the education 
negotiations, said both Republicans and Democrats were nudged toward agreement 
as the pressure increased from their traditional constituencies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pressure Groups 
</P>
<P>
Real estate developers and road builders pushed Republicans, particularly a 
powerful and conservative bloc of lawmakers known as "Cavemen," for a gasoline 
tax increase to pay for new highways to serve suburban developments. Health and 
welfare providers pushed the Democrats to rewrite Proposition 98 to avoid deep 
cuts in programs that serve the poor. Education interests worked with both 
parties to lock in their share of the funding while giving up enough to avoid a 
political backlash against education programs. 
</P>
<P>
"It shows what can be done when you have all the powerful special interests on 
the same side," Peace said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the euphoria inside the Capitol, the real test of success or failure of 
the package will come next June, when voters will decide whether to double the 
state's gasoline tax and increase the spending limit to a point that may never 
again trigger a tax rebate. 
</P>
<P>
The ballot language agreed upon as part of the package is less than direct in 
its description of the measure, which would be known as "The Traffic Congestion 
Relief and Spending Limitation Act of 1990." The language notes that the 
measure would "update" the spending limit to allow new funding "for congestion 
relief, mass transit, health care, services for the elderly" and other 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
The statement also mentions an increase in truck weight fees before noting that 
the measure would raise the fuel tax 5 cents in 1990 and 1 cent each year for 
four years after that. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Are Skeptical 
</P>
<P>
Peace said he believes legislators are overestimating the will of middle-class 
Californians to tax themselves, no matter how serious the state's problems 
might be. Another dissident, Assemblyman Richard Mountjoy (R-Monrovia), said he 
does not believe the voters would be "fooled" into lifting the constitutional 
spending limit. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, however, said Friday night that he is "confident" that he and other 
supporters of the plan will be able to win voter approval of the proposed 
constitutional amendment. The governor said he plans to campaign "very 
actively" for the measure.

GORBACHEV SAYS ETHNIC STRIFE IS THREAT TO UNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev warned the nation Saturday night that the 
country's growing ethnic strife is endangering its unity as a state as well as 
threatening his program of political and economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Appealing for calm and for the cool consideration of grievances after weeks of 
continuing unrest in scattered areas of the country, Gorbachev made clear the 
leadership's fear that the nation is heading into a political maelstrom that 
could tear the Soviet Union apart. 
</P>
<P>
As president, Gorbachev said, it is his "duty to warn you about the mounting 
danger of worsening inter-ethnic relations and the consequences for society, 
for every family and for every person." 
</P>
<P>
"The fate of perestroika and the unity of our state is at stake," he declared 
in a sober, 20-minute address broadcast on radio and television. "Irresponsible 
slogans, political instigation, setting one national group against another, the 
domination of some ethnic groups by others -- this could lead to disaster for 
us all. 
</P>
<P>
"The living and the succeeding generations will curse those who pushed the 
nation on this course and those who failed to caution it against the dangers 
involved in time to prevent madness." 
</P>
<P>
With serious ethnic clashes in Soviet Central Asia over the past month, with 
troops needed to maintain the peace in the southern republics of Armenia, 
Azerbaijan and Georgia and with nationalism growing stronger in the Baltic 
republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, Gorbachev is struggling to hold the 
Soviet Union together as a state while he pushes broad reforms that he believes 
will resolve most of the grievances. 
</P>
<P>
Even as he spoke, Soviet officials reported new violence in the south -- this 
time between Georgians and Azerbaijanis inside the Georgian republic but in an 
area with many Azerbaijanis. Roving gangs, armed with hunting rifles, gasoline 
bombs and other weapons, had clashed in three towns south of the capital of 
Tbilisi last week, leaving one man dead and 22 people seriously wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Although limited so far in scope, some of the ethnic conflicts could grow to 
the point where various regions of the country would be thrown into virtual 
civil war, Gorbachev suggested, and some national republics could find 
themselves in violent disputes with their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Those who encourage the unrest are "playing with fire," Gorbachev said, warning 
that the government will use its full powers and take "the most decisive 
measures" against those provoking the clashes, organizing attacks on minority 
groups or urging secession. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 300 people have been killed in communal clashes and related political 
disturbances over the past two years; tens of thousands of people have had to 
flee their homes, including 40,000 last month alone, to seek refuge from the 
violence, and nearly 25,000 special troops are now deployed in various parts of 
the country to maintain order. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be no pulling of our punches in relation to those who have taken 
the criminal path," Gorbachev said, warning of stern measures against those 
engaged in communal violence or in political agitation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Energy Drained 
</P>
<P>
The ethnic strife, much of it rooted in past Soviet policies of domination by 
ethnic Russians or in the forced deportation of hundreds of thousands of people 
during the Stalinist era, has increasingly drained the political energy 
necessary to push through major reforms and has provided conservative critics 
of reform with a potent argument against faster and broader change. 
</P>
<P>
For Gorbachev, the spread of the unrest has forced the humiliating admission 
that the Soviet Union, a superpower in world terms, cannot ensure the domestic 
tranquility that is a first priority for any government -- nor can it protect 
its own minorities against pogroms. 
</P>
<P>
If the strife here continued and grew, he asked, "What kind of example shall we 
set for others while calling on the whole of mankind to build a nonviolent 
world?" 
</P>
<P>
Of equal gravity for Gorbachev in domestic political terms has been the growth 
of not only nationalism but the appearance of secessionist groups in the Baltic 
republics and in Armenia, Georgia and Moldavia, a Soviet republic on the 
Romanian border. 
</P>
<P>
The whole issue is believed to have been the subject of a high-level Communist 
Party conference here late last week, and Gorbachev's unusual television 
address underscores the threat posed by the conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev acknowledged that ethnic relations are "wound in a tight knot of 
contradictions" because of previous Soviet policies, particularly the effort to 
pull the country's 100-plus ethnic groups into a new "Soviet nationality" with 
a unified culture. 
</P>
<P>
This policy had, in fact, collided head on with growing ethnic awareness 
throughout the country and made the problems even worse. 
</P>
<P>
Past economic policies, including the "stagnation" in many regions under the 
regime of the late President Leonid I. Brezhnev, had also made the problems 
more acute. 
</P>
<P>
"We are also reaping today the results of lawlessness in preceding decades -- 
the deportation of whole peoples from their lands and the burying in oblivion 
of the national interests of small ethnic groups," Gorbachev said, alluding to 
actions carried out decades ago by the dictator Josef Stalin. 
</P>
<P>
"Such excesses resulted in indifference to ethnic interests, to many 
outstanding social and economic problems in constituent republics and 
autonomous regions, deformities in the development of the languages and 
cultures of the country's different peoples, the deteriorating demographic 
situation and many other negative consequences that ultimately provoked tension 
in inter-ethnic relations." 
</P>
<P>
Although these questions will be dealt with during a special meeting of the 
Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee in late July and then debated 
again by the Congress of People's Deputies, the country's new national 
assembly, Gorbachev apparently felt that he could not wait for those debates, 
and he set out his own broad guidelines for dealing with the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Right of Equality 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone, regardless of his nationality, should feel an equal citizen in any 
part of the country and have a possibility to exercise all the rights 
guaranteed by the Soviet Union's constitution," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The refusal to recognize the basic principle of equality had led to attacks on 
minority groups in several parts of the country, Gorbachev said, alluding to 
the particularly vicious assaults on Mesketian Turks in Uzbekistan last month 
in which about 100 people died. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet leader outlined an approach that would seek to increase the feeling 
of various ethnic groups that they are "at home in their own land" and could 
preserve and develop their own cultures, languages and social traditions, with 
the Soviet Union evolving politically to be much more of a federal system. 
</P>
<P>
But he said that minority communities also need to be protected so that there 
is a balance of rights. "We have lived and will continue to live in a 
multi-ethnic community," he observed. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said that "profound transformations in the Soviet federation" are 
clearly essential, promising further political reforms to make it a real 
federation and not just one in name only. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demands Rejected 
</P>
<P>
But he declared at the same time his firm opposition to near-total independence 
demanded by some nationalists, particularly in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, 
and to the calls by others for the redrawing of the borders of ethnic 
territories. The Soviet Union's ethnic groups have "a common destiny," 
Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
"In quest of the better, one should not embark on the path of destroying what 
has been built and abandoning what has already been given by the federation and 
what can be multiplied within its framework," he said.

<P>
She is a new-era candidate with an old-style political campaign. 
</P>
<P>
An accomplished woman with a corruption-free record, Margarita Ortega Villa, 
38, was President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's handpicked choice for the next 
governor of Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
After proclaiming her dedication to Salinas' program of political reform and 
"modernization" last week, Ortega hauled out the pork barrel for a 
business-as-usual rally. 
</P>
<P>
"I am here to deliver the gifts that President Salinas sends to you through 
me," Ortega told 300 members of a farmers' union affiliated with the ruling 
Institutional Revolutionary Party. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Giveaways, Health Checks 
</P>
<P>
The gifts included irrigation works, a new U.S.-Mexico border crossing, a 
freeze on state electricity rates and land titles to 42 lots. Outside the union 
hall, meanwhile, party doctors offered free blood-pressure tests and wrote 
prescriptions that could be filled from a stock of free medicines in a pickup 
truck. A party social worker handed out bags of food, and a party barber 
offered haircuts. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega's campaign illustrates the conflict that the ruling party, known as the 
PRI, faces in the new era of competitive politics that Salinas embraced last 
year after opposition charges that his own election was rigged. There are 
elections in five states today, but the close races in Baja California, 
Michoacan and Chihuahua are seen as a measure of just how far the party is 
willing to go in its perestroika-style reforms. 
</P>
<P>
In these three key states, as well as in Campeche and Zacatecas, voters will 
pick new state legislatures. In Baja and Chihuahua, voters also will elect new 
mayors, but the only gubernatorial election will take place in Baja. The PRI 
has never lost a governorship during its 60 years in power, and it does not 
want to start now. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas, however, lost Baja California last year to leftist presidential 
candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, and the gubernatorial race has been warmly 
contested. The three leading candidates are strong and very different 
personalities with divergent programs. 
</P>
<P>
Polls show Ortega running neck and neck with National Action Party candidate 
Ernesto Ruffo Appel, the scrappy former mayor of Ensenada, who was born in the 
United States and worked for many years as a fisherman for a joint U.S.-Mexican 
seafood processing company. 
</P>
<P>
Although his party, known by its Spanish acronym PAN, represents the right wing 
of Mexican politics, the charismatic Ruffo has presented himself as the 
populist choice -- a kind of "everyman" alternative to the corrupt PRI 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Running a distant third is Martha Maldonado, the candidate for Cardenas' new 
Democratic Revolutionary Party. The daughter of Baja California's first 
governor, Maldonado has traveled a singular political route: She studied in the 
Soviet Union before enlisting in an urban guerrilla unit in the 1960s. She says 
she then worked illegally in the United States as a maid and seamstress in the 
1970s and returned home in the 1980s to work for the PRI. In 1987, she left the 
ruling party to work for the Cardenas movement. 
</P>
<P>
Maldonado's poor showing in the polls is surprising after Cardenas' win here 
last year, but political observers say that is because the race for governor is 
based on personalities rather than ideology. The state that voted leftist in 
1988 could conceivably vote for the rightist PAN this year. 
</P>
<P>
The campaigns have been remarkably polite given the division in the state and 
the distrust among the leading parties: Ruffo, like his party, believes 
Cardenas is a PRI ruse to divide the opposition; Maldonado believes the PRI and 
PAN offer the same conservative economic program and have teamed up to beat the 
Cardenas reform movement. 
</P>
<P>
But even the opposition concedes that their candidates have had more access to 
government-controlled media than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
Political observers are closely monitoring today's elections to see if the PRI 
can win these races fairly and, if not, whether the government will concede 
defeat honestly. Michoacan is home to Salinas' rival, Cardenas, while Chihuahua 
and Baja California are strategically important, given their location on the 
U.S. border. Although Baja is home to fewer than 3 million residents, the 
state's tourism and assembly-plant industries are vital to the national 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, some observers say the elections put the PRI in a no-win 
predicament. If the ruling party wins Baja, the opposition no doubt will cry 
fraud and question Ortega's legitimacy. But if the PRI loses, analysts are apt 
to see the defeat as evidence of the party's decline and to ask whether it 
signals success or failure for the Salinas modernization program. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega bristles at such suggestions. In the course of her tireless campaign in 
recent months, observers say she has been transformed from a tentative presence 
on the stump to an accomplished, hard-charging -- and, some say, arrogant -- 
proponent of the new PRI strategy. 
</P>
<P>
"It is infantile to condition the existence of democracy on the very improbable 
defeat of the PRI," she said in an interview aboard her campaign van. "Baja 
California has had experience with democratic processes." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Ruffo was an opposition mayor of Ensenada following on the heels of 
another opposition mayor. But the PRI has long been accused of stealing tight 
elections, including the 1983 race for mayor of Mexicali, which PAN claims it 
won. 
</P>
<P>
"The culture of fraud was created by the PRI," Ruffo said last week in his 
campaign office in a Tijuana shopping center. "The people don't believe the 
PRI." 
</P>
<P>
While few people question Ortega's integrity, some observers wonder if she can 
control a party long accustomed to resorting to electoral fraud to pile up huge 
majorities. Already, opposition politicians and newspapers have uncovered 
several voting irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
In the Tijuana squatter neighborhood of Camino Verde, a PRI stronghold, 
opposition parties reported that voter registration rolls tripled from 8,769 to 
29,741 during April, the last month for registration. Among the prospective 
voters: Pablo Picasso and Juan Sebastian Bach. In addition, the weekly 
newspaper Zeta published copies of the death certificates of two other 
registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, officials announced that the statewide voter registration list had 
mushroomed by 86,000 names between 1988 and 1989, compared to an increase of 
545 registered voters from 1986 to 1988. At the same time, the number of voting 
stations declined by 173. The opposition cried fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega says the irregularities were discovered as part of the government's 
review of the registration list and that they have been corrected. The 
registration list came down by about 21,000 names, to 883,900, but no booths 
were added. 
</P>
<P>
"The opposition always cries fraud when they predict they are going to lose," 
Ortega said with a clear edge in her voice. "For us, the success of 
modernization is a clean, democratic fight, independent of which party wins. 
Modernization was imposed with my candidacy." 
</P>
<P>
Even without fraud, the race illustrates how difficult it is for an opposition 
candidate to defeat PRI nominees: The ruling party outspent the opposition by 
many times, investing large sums in advertising, giveaways and computerized 
polling. PRI officials say they can't estimate how much has been spent. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega has served as a state and federal deputy and currently is one of Baja's 
two federal senators. Before her candidacy was unveiled, she was considered a 
dark horse in the race to represent the ruling party, but Salinas picked her 
apparently for her clean record and lack of political liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
In Mexico's heavily centralized political system, the governors are considered 
the president's personal representatives -- like colonial viceroys -- and 
customarily the president picks the PRI's gubernatorial candidates. 
</P>
<P>
If she wins, Ortega would be the first woman governor of Baja and only the 
third woman governor in the history of Mexico. The scarcity of women in 
politics here caused some observers to speculate that Ortega would be a 
"sacrificial lamb" and lose the election in the name of modernization. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega brushes off that view as sexist and notes that Salinas has vowed to 
promote women. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the backing of the president, Ortega has been running against the 
checkered legacy of her own party. Not only is the PRI blamed nationally for 
the country's weak economy, but in Baja California, the former PRI governor, 
Xicotencatl Leyva Mortera, was widely viewed as mean, corrupt and incompetent 
-- a personification of the PRI's liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after taking office, Salinas sent Leyva Mortera into political exile 
and replaced him with an interim governor. The move was regarded as essential 
here if the PRI hoped to win the governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
One of Leyva Mortera's most damaging acts as governor may have been to make a 
hero out of PAN's Ruffo. Leyva Mortera put the squeeze on the Ensenada mayor's 
budget, so Ruffo took to the streets with a broom, saying he didn't have the 
money to pay city sweepers. When word spread of the confrontation between Ruffo 
and the governor, residents turned out to help the mayor clean up their port 
city, leading to a nationwide publicity coup. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's message, however, was not lost on voters in this election. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have an opposition governor, we'll never get another thing for this 
state from the federal government," said a taxi driver who said he would vote 
for the PRI today. "We can't have an opposition governor until we have an 
opposition president." 
</P>
<P>
Adela Zaragoza, 65, agreed. A homemaker who voted for Cardenas last year, she 
said she too would vote PRI this time: "Maybe this new governor will be better. 
Maybe she'll think differently from a man."

<P>
ZARATE WILLKA GROUP TIED TO KILLING OF 2 AMERICANS, BOMBINGS

<TEXT>
<P>
American FBI agents have helped track down members of a terrorist group wanted 
for a bomb attack last August on the U.S. secretary of state's motorcade and 
for the slaying in May of two Mormon missionaries from Utah. 
</P>
<P>
The self-styled Zarate Willka Armed Forces of Liberation, a Marxist group named 
after an obscure Indian rebel of the late 1800s, claimed responsibility for 
both attacks. At week's end, authorities said that eight front members were 
under arrest and that at least three of them had participated directly in the 
bombing or the killings. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those arrested had once worked in a military government's 
"paramilitary" intelligence service, Bolivian officials said. The U.S. Embassy 
said that at least one had received training in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
In 1967, Cuba sponsored a guerrilla band led by revolutionary hero Ernesto 
(Che) Guevara in rural Bolivia. With the aid of U.S. advisers, Bolivian army 
rangers hunted the guerrillas down and killed Guevara in October, 1967. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Group Since 1970s 
</P>
<P>
Other small Bolivian guerrilla groups were defeated early in the 1970s. Since 
then, Zarate Willka is the first armed rebel organization to surface in this 
landlocked country, the poorest in South America. 
</P>
<P>
Few people had heard of the Zarate Willka group when it claimed responsibility 
for the dynamite bomb that damaged four cars in the motorcade bringing George 
P. Shultz, then secretary of state, into La Paz on Aug. 8. No one was injured 
in the blast. 
</P>
<P>
In January, the group set off a bomb at the National Congress Building. Again, 
no one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
But on May 25, the terrorist band announced the "execution" of two young Mormon 
missionaries minutes after they were shot to death on their doorstep with an 
automatic assault rifle. 
</P>
<P>
A handwritten statement delivered to a newspaper declared that "the violation 
of our national sovereignty" by "Yankee invaders" would not go unpunished. "Our 
hate is implacable and our war is to the death," the message said. 
</P>
<P>
The victims were roommates Todd Ray Wilson and Jeffrey Brent Ball, both 20 and 
both from small towns in Utah. They had been in Bolivia about a year, doing 
door-to-door proselytizing for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 400 Mormon missionaries in Bolivia, half of them young 
Americans who have saved their own money to pay for their missions. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson and Ball were returning to their rented room in a house near the La Paz 
cemetery when a yellow Volkswagen station wagon stopped nearby. Witnesses said 
that a man got out of the car and opened fire on the two as they prepared to 
enter the house. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ramiro Donoso, a Bolivian physician who is active in the church, said other 
missionaries in Bolivia were horrified by the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
"There was fear, to the point that the missionaries didn't go out to work for 
several days," Donoso said. 
</P>
<P>
But now they are working normally and have had no more trouble, he said. "I 
think the thing has been against Americans instead of against the church." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Robert S. Gelbard said that Bolivia's extreme left, unable to 
win mass allegiance, uses the United States as a scapegoat for its failure. 
Marxist politicians accused the United States of violating Bolivian sovereignty 
with anti-drug and military aid programs. 
</P>
<P>
Gelbard said the terrorists struck out at the missionaries "because the Mormons 
in their eyes are symbolic of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
After the slayings, a special six-member team of FBI agents came to work with 
Bolivian police in the investigation. The FBI brought lie detectors, ballistics 
laboratory equipment and other instruments. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers say that a $500,000 reward offered by the United States for 
information leading to the conviction of the killers also may have helped in 
the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the interior and information ministers announced the arrests of 
several Zarate Willka members, including two university students and a medical 
doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Constantino Yujra, a sociology student, "confessed having participated in the 
attack on Mr. George Shultz," Interior Minister Eduardo Perez Beltran said. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, police arrested two brothers, Felix and Nestor Encinas, accused of 
killing the Mormons. 
</P>
<P>
Still at large are the group's leader, identified only as "Horacio," and his 
second-in-command, "Sapo" -- the Spanish word for toad. 
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Herman Antelo said that there is no evidence that the 
Zarate Willka band is linked to any Bolivian political party or foreign 
organization. There had been speculation that it received support from the 
Maoist Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) guerrillas of neighboring Peru, who 
assassinated the Peruvian naval attache in La Paz last December. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trained in Cuba 
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Gelbard said in an interview that one man under arrest, Julio 
Penaranda, received bomb training in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pure Cuban terrorism, I don't think there is any question about it," the 
ambassador said. He added that the Zarate Willka group has been wounded but not 
crushed. 
</P>
<P>
"My concern is that in the short term this will cause the group to lash out and 
show they are still effective," Gelbard said. "I think they still would like to 
do something spectacular." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ZARATE WILLKA'S TARGETS 
</P>
<P>

a motorcade bringing then-Secretary of State George P. Shultz to La Paz, the

<P>
Conservative Greek Prime Minister-designate Tzannis Tzannetakis, a compromise 
choice in an unprecedented Communist-rightist agreement, began forming a new 
government Saturday dedicated to prosecuting outgoing socialist ministers. 
</P>
<P>
Tzannetakis, 62, was asked by President Christos Sartzetakis to form a Cabinet 
after a Communist alliance and the conservative New Democracy Party agreed to 
join forces and support a short-term "cleanup" government. 
</P>
<P>
The government will be announced and sworn in today. 
</P>
<P>
Tzannetakis, a former New Democracy minister and career navy officer, told 
reporters his Cabinet would reflect the determination of the 
Communist-conservative alliance "to cleanse and to restore institutions and 
democracy." 
</P>
<P>
The two camps, bitterly divided for years after the 1946-49 civil war, united 
on a single issue -- prosecuting socialist ministers accused of involvement in 
a series of multimillion-dollar financial scandals. 
</P>
<P>
Greece has been in a political crisis since inconclusive elections on June 18, 
with the main parties -- New Democracy and the socialists -- vying for the 
support of the power-broker Communists. 
</P>
<P>
Communist Party leader Harilaos Florakis told reporters: "We have decided to 
support a government under Tzannetakis, which will be for a short period of 
time, and its sole purpose will be cleansing." 
</P>
<P>
Outgoing Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, soundly defeated and recovering 
from pneumonia in a hospital, issued a defiant statement denouncing "the 
shameless forming of a coalition of conservatism with the sole purpose of 
harming the great popular (socialist) movement." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Communists' Role Unclear 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear whether the Communists would have ministers in a government for 
the first time since 1944 or simply support the conservatives in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
New Democracy emerged as the largest party in the 300-seat Parliament, with 145 
seats, but fell short of an absolute majority. The Communist-led alliance, with 
28 seats, has held the balance of power. 
</P>
<P>
Bogged down by the financial scandals, Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist 
Movement, which swept to landslide victories in 1981 and 1985, could only 
muster 125 seats. 
</P>
<P>
The most prominent affair stems from an embezzlement scheme at the private Bank 
of Crete, in which socialists are accused of pocketing interest payments on 
state accounts. More than $200 million disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Papandreou struggled in vain from his hospital bed to coax the Communists into 
a left-wing coalition, but with the designation of Tzannetakis as new prime 
minister, the curtain was brought down on eight years of socialist rule. 
</P>
<P>
New Democracy leader Constantine Mitsotakis cleared the way for the historic 
alliance on Friday by renouncing his claim to be prime minister and putting 
forward the name of Tzannetakis, a close personal friend and political ally. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsotakis remains head of New Democracy and intends to lead the conservatives 
in elections after Parliament has started the legal process for lifting 
immunity for socialist ministers and criminal probes, probably in September.

COURT-MARTIAL IN CUBA INDICTS 15 TOP OFFICERS

<P>
A Cuban court-martial formally indicted 15 high-ranking military officers on 
charges of high treason and trafficking in cocaine, diamonds and ivory, Cuba's 
official media said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The 15, including former Interior Minister Jose Abrantes and war hero Gen. 
Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez, were stripped of their rank and expelled from the 
Communist Party last week. 
</P>
<P>
They were formally indicted by the military court in a meeting late Friday and 
early Saturday, said the official Prensa Latina news agency, monitored in 
Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, the 15 could face the firing squad. 
</P>
<P>
The news agency said the court reconvened Saturday afternoon. It said the 
proceedings were attended by the Cuban press and senior government officials 
but gave no details. 
</P>
<P>
Dispatches from Havana said the defendants belonged to a secret division of the 
Interior Ministry that smuggled medicines, hospital supplies and computers to 
circumvent a U.S. trade embargo. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conspired to Smuggle Drugs 
</P>
<P>
Prensa Latina said the military prosecutor, Brig. Gen. Juan Escalona Reguera, 
told the court the defendants conspired for 2 1/2 years to help Colombia's 
Medellin cartel smuggle cocaine into the United States and also dealt in 
diamonds and ivory. 
</P>
<P>
Escalona dismissed as "absurd" arguments by Ochoa and some of the other accused 
that they dealt in cocaine to earn dollars to help Cuba's faltering economy, 
Prensa Latina said. 
</P>
<P>
The accused made these claims before a separate military tribunal on Tuesday 
and Wednesday that stripped them of all rank and decorations and recommended a 
court-martial. 
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Castro on Thursday replaced Abrantes with Maj. Gen. Abelardo 
Colome Ibarra, a confidant of Castro and the third-highest-ranking officer 
after Castro and Defense Minister Raul Castro, the president's brother.

Sudan's new military ruler, Brig. Gen. Omar Hassan Ahmed Bashir, dismissed more 
than two dozen generals in a purge of the armed forces Saturday and said he 
will seek to resume peace talks with secessionist rebels waging a six-year-long 
war in the south. 
</P>
<P>
Moving quickly to consolidate power following the bloodless coup that toppled 
the civilian government of Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi on Friday, Bashir 
announced the dismissal of 28 generals -- virtually the entire senior command 
of the Sudanese armed forces -- including the commander in chief, Fathi Ahmed 
Ali, who reportedly is also under arrest, and Chief of Staff Babu Nimir, who 
was said to be an ally of the ousted prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
Reports from the Sudanese capital of Khartoum said the city remained calm 
Saturday, with no outward signs of resistance despite what had been initial 
fears that some of the large and well-armed militias controlled by Sudan's now 
disbanded political parties might try to oppose the military takeover, which 
ended three years of democratic but chronically disorganized rule in the 
largest nation in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Troops Patrol City 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats in Khartoum said that troops continued to patrol the city, manning 
roadblocks and checkpoints at key intersections. Telex and telephone 
communications, cut immediately after the coup, were restored, but Khartoum 
airport remained closed to most air traffic. 
</P>
<P>
A state of emergency also remained in force, with Radio Omdurman, the state 
broadcasting service, warning that violators of a nighttime curfew in the 
capital risked being shot on sight. 
</P>
<P>
Egypt, Sudan's northern neighbor and the Arab country with the largest 
strategic stake in stability in Khartoum, cautiously welcomed the new regime, 
with editorials in Cairo's state-run press focusing on the political anarchy, 
sectarian tensions, corruption and economic mismanagement that were endemic to 
Mahdi's hapless government. 
</P>
<P>
Chad, another neighbor, also welcomed the change, but there was no immediate 
reaction from Libya, whose increasing military presence in Sudan was a major 
factor behind what has been a steady deterioration of Egyptian-Sudanese 
relations since Mahdi came to power. 
</P>
<P>
Bashir, who in the wake of the coup appointed himself prime minister, defense 
minister and armed forces commander, is said to be pro-Egyptian, having done 
some of his military training here. 
</P>
<P>
It is still not clear, more than a day after the pre-dawn coup, who the other 
members are of a new 15-man Revolutionary Command Council set up to govern 
Sudan. But, like Bashir, they are said to be mostly middle-ranking officers 
dissatisfied with the Mahdi government's political paralysis and seeming 
inability to negotiate an end to the bloody war in the south against rebels 
from the Sudanese People's Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
Bashir, meeting Saturday with Cabinet undersecretaries, sharply criticized 
Mahdi's ambivalent approach toward peace talks and said that he will launch a 
new initiative aimed at reaching an accord with the rebels, Radio Omdurman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our primary goal is peace. We (the army) are the people most suffering from 
war, and I will enlist the help of all experts in the quest for peace," the 
radio quoted him as saying. 
</P>
<P>
He said that a referendum could determine whether Sudan should have Islamic 
law, or sharia, which has been a key issue in the civil war. 
</P>
<P>
The civil war, pitting the Christian and animist-dominated south against the 
Muslim north, has made millions homeless, ruined the Sudanese economy and 
caused untold suffering by preventing relief supplies from reaching the 
famine-stricken south. 
</P>
<P>
Last February, the military issued a public ultimatum demanding that Mahdi 
either make peace with the rebels or give the armed forces the means to win the 
war. The prime minister's faction-ridden government appeared unable to do 
either, however, and this paralysis was seen by most observers as the key 
factor leading to his downfall. 
</P>
<P>
It was still not clear what had happened to Mahdi, who was elected premier 
three years ago when another military regime stepped down after overthrowing 
President Jaafar Numeiri in a 1985 coup. 
</P>
<P>
Some reports said that Mahdi had been arrested, along with most of the other 
senior members of his government. But other reports suggested he had escaped, 
possibly to Libya. The new government remained silent on his fate. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day, Radio Omdurman broadcast what it said were messages of 
support for the new government from army units stationed across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Little about Bashir was known to outsiders before the coup. But according to 
details now emerging about his background, he is a 43-year-old paratroop 
commander who achieved a measure of fame as the hero of a major victory over 
rebels at the town of Mayoum. 
</P>
<P>
He is a Muslim and a northerner of Arab extraction who, according to reports in 
the Egyptian press, studied in the Soviet Union but is considered to be 
anti-communist. 
</P>
<P>
His elder brother, who lives in the United Arab Emirates, was quoted by Persian 
Gulf newspapers Saturday as saying that Bashir was an admirer of Gen. 
Abdul-Rahman Swareddahab, the former defense minister who overthrew Numeiri in 
1985 and ruled for one year before stepping down in favor of a democratically 
elected government headed by Mahdi.

Residents of Staten Island, which bills itself as "the forgotten borough," 
awoke Saturday morning to learn that the state Legislature had unexpectedly 
approved a referendum to allow them to vote on whether to secede from New York 
City. 
</P>
<P>
The referendum, which could be held as early as November, 1990, emerged from an 
all-night session in Albany as lawmakers struggled toward adjournment. Gov. 
Mario M. Cuomo said Saturday he had not decided whether to sign the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Secession fever has been running high among Staten Island's 400,000 mostly 
white, middle-class residents since the Supreme Court struck down the city's 
powerful Board of Estimate in March. The court found the board's structure 
unconstitutional because it gives the same voice to boroughs of widely varying 
population. 
</P>
<P>
Staten Island has just 5% of the city's population. A charter revision panel 
that is drawing up a new form of city government has voted to abolish the Board 
of Estimate-which controls the city's budget, zoning, land use and contracts -- 
and redistribute its powers.

3 NUNS END 8-MONTH PROTEST, LEAVE MONASTERY

Three of four Roman Catholic nuns who barricaded themselves in a monastery 
nearly nine months ago to protest liberalization of their austere order ended 
the standoff Saturday, a diocesan spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth woman, whose temporary vows expired earlier in the year, remained in 
the infirmary at the Monastery of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary of Mt. Carmel, 
said Timothy Manning of the Paterson Diocese. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the 13 Carmelite nuns at the monastery barricaded themselves in the 
infirmary Oct. 4, saying they feared eviction for protesting a new prioress' 
introduction of television and sweets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Action a Surprise 
</P>
<P>
Manning said Saturday's action was a surprise. "We're presuming that the 
realization finally hit them that if they wanted to save their vows, they were 
going to have to leave." 
</P>
<P>
Manning said the diocese had planned to deliver an order Monday demanding the 
nuns leave the monastery. 
</P>
<P>
The nuns had maintained they would not leave the building until they were 
ordered to by the Apostolica Signatura, the highest court of the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
The nuns have twice ignored orders from lower-level Vatican officials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hangs Up Phone 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Williams, formerly Sister Teresita, was the only nun remaining at the 
infirmary Saturday. She hung up the telephone when reached by a reporter 
seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
The location of the other nuns was not known, Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Sutton, a lay person who has acted as a spokeswoman for the nuns, said 
she did not know where they went.

Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp has made a 
"multimillion-dollar commitment" to help resolve a longstanding housing 
desegregation case in Yonkers, N.Y. He would not specify the amount of U.S. 
funds involved. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp's actions include approval of construction, on five sites, of 142 new 
units of public housing in Yonkers. He said that the units are an integral part 
of a federal court's plan in the Yonkers litigation to provide low-income and 
moderate-income housing, open to all races, in predominantly white sections of 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
"President Bush and I are committed to fair housing and have made the full 
enforcement of laws against discrimination one of our top priorities" at HUD, 
Kemp said Friday. "Our actions will help provide low-income housing 
opportunities for those in need and promote our goal of fair housing for all."

Budding Sam Spadovitches with KGB pedigrees have set up shop in Leningrad, 
opening what they say is the first private detective agency in the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
The Leningrad detective bureau is staffed with former agents from the Committee 
for State Security, or KGB, the prosecutor's office and the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs, the newspaper Sovietskaya Kultura said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
V. Kosyakov, one of the cooperative's founders, said his agency is prepared to 
help anyone who seeks assistance, except criminals or other shady characters. 
</P>
<P>
Among the services offered are legal consultations, missing persons 
investigations and protection from racketeers. 
</P>
<P>
Kosyakov said the bureau guarantees its honesty. "Respect for order and 
professionalism -- those are the two fundamental criteria" for hiring staff, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Sovietskaya Kultura made no mention of the agency's fees.

There will be a whole lot of spiking and setting going on, as the oldest 
continuously run beach volleyball tournament in the country -- the Laguna Beach 
Open -- culminates Monday with its men's and women's finals. About 150,000 
visitors are expected to attend the three-day event at Main Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Forty teams will compete for a $70,000 purse at the tournament, which is 
celebrating its 35th year. 
</P>
<P>
Beach volleyball is played on the sand, with two people on a team. The rules 
are the same as those for indoor volleyball. Scoring is based on who has 
control, or serves, the ball, with points scored based on keeping the ball in 
play without it touching the ground or landing outside the court. 
</P>
<P>
The women's games start at 9 a.m. today, with finals slated for 2 p.m. Monday. 
Men's games begin at noon today, with finals starting at 4 p.m. Monday.

The sewage spill June 22 at Aliso Beach, in which more than 900,000 gallons of 
raw effluent was dumped into the surf after a sewage line burst, was the 
largest in Orange County in more than a year, according to county health 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Health officials say people who come into contact with water contaminated by 
untreated sewage risk contracting hepatitis. If such water is swallowed, 
stomach and intestinal problems may develop. 
</P>
<P>
The largest sewage accident in Orange County in the last decade is thought to 
be the 9-million gallon spill in January, 1980, from a Capistrano Beach 
treatment plant. Salt Creek, Doheny State and Capistrano beaches were closed 
for two months after the event.

COACHING KEEPS CIARELLIS ON THE SIDELINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBIE LUDOVISE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ciarellis of Huntington Beach are a family tailor-made to conduct a 
coaching clinic. Just tell them when and where, and they'll sign up. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, they'd probably race each other to the registration table, encouraging 
and coaching each other along the way. 
</P>
<P>
The Ciarellis -- parents Frank and Sue, son Tony and his wife, Stephanie, son 
Rocky and his wife, Cammy -- are a competitive bunch to be sure. 
</P>
<P>
Sports, friends say, have been key to the Ciarellis' bond. Frank and Sue met 
through sports, as did Tony and Stephanie, and Rocky and Cammy. 
</P>
<P>
In Huntington Beach, the Ciarellis are something of a high school sports 
institution. Frank and Sue Ciarelli say they have probably attended more Oiler 
sporting events than anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Ciarelli, now an engineer for the city of Huntington Beach, coached some 
of the nation's top women's softball teams from the late 1940s to the 
mid-1960s. He coached the Orange Lionettes to a world softball championship in 
1965, and then became one of chief organizers of the Huntington Beach 
recreation department. 
</P>
<P>
His sons followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, Tony, a former football and track star at Huntington Beach, 
coached Edison High's track and field team to a Sunset League championship. 
Rocky, a former Oiler basketball and volleyball star, coached his Huntington 
Beach High boys' volleyball team to a Sunset League championship. 
</P>
<P>
Sue, a national-class softball player in the early 1950s, instigated and 
coached some of the first recreational sports programs for girls in Huntington 
Beach. Cammy, a former All-American volleyball player at UCLA, is the assistant 
women's volleyball coach at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Only Stephanie, a one-time world-record holder in women's weightlifting, has 
yet to coach, though she plans to start this fall with youth soccer. 
</P>
<P>
The Ciarellis say the family's interest in coaching simply is an extention of 
their overall love for sports. But friends say it's more of a reflection of the 
kind of people they are: nurturing, supportive and genuinely concerned with 
helping others. 
</P>
<P>
"That is the basis of the Ciarelli family," said Liz Wilson, a longtime family 
friend. "They're very, very close themselves, and they know how to instill that 
special quality in others. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been that way since the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
When Frank and Sue met in the mid-1940s, Huntington Beach was a sleepy, 
surfside community of about 3,000. Oil wells dotted the city, and a crowded day 
at the beach came only once a year, on the Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
"Huntington Beach was just downtown, the pier and a lot of open space," Sue 
Ciarelli said. "Everybody knew everybody, it was a neat time." 
</P>
<P>
In 1946, Frank Ciarelli was a star football player at Huntington Beach High 
School. As a receiver and a kicker, Ciarelli contributed heavily to the Oilers' 
1946 Sunset League championship, the third of only five league football titles 
the school has won. 
</P>
<P>
"Frank won a few games for us," said quarterback Harlo LeBard, who retired last 
year after 31 years of teaching at Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Frank caught quite a few of my passes he probably shouldn't have caught. He 
had good athletic sense, being in the right place at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
Although Sue Ciarelli, then Sue Smith, was three years younger than Frank, they 
started dating when she was a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most girls at the time, Sue, daughter of a Texas rodeo rider, was 
athletic and extremely competitive, playing sandlot baseball with the boys 
before school because athletic options for girls, she said, were dreary. 
</P>
<P>
"In those days, they let us play basketball, but it was half-court, and you 
were only allowed to dribble once then shoot or pass," she said. "And there 
wasn't any trap, that was too hard on a woman. They let us play field hockey, 
which was kind of amazing because they wouldn't let us do track or play 
full-court basketball, but they'd let us run on a 100-yard long field with 
sticks in our hands. 
</P>
<P>
"Mostly, though, girls' sports were limited to play days. We'd all play then go 
and have punch and cookies." 
</P>
<P>
Wanting more, Sue signed up for the Buena Park Lynx, a triple-A level women's 
softball team. Playing first base, she made their double-A affiliate, the 
Kittens, and played with eventual Orange County Hall of Fame member, Carol 
Spanks. 
</P>
<P>
When the Kittens' coach quit a year later, Sue asked Frank to coach. The team 
won a Southern California championship the next year, then Frank moved up to 
coach the Lynx. 
</P>
<P>
Said Sue: "After that, my softball career was put on hold. I started having 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
Paula, now 37, came first. Like her mother, she was a talented athlete who, 
aside from being the No. 1 singles player on the Oilers' tennis team, mostly 
had to settle for play days and punch. 
</P>
<P>
Tony, now 35, became a Times' All-County defensive back at Huntington Beach, 
and placed fourth in the state shotput in 1972 at Oroville. 
</P>
<P>
It was there Tony met Stephanie, who was cheerleading for Santa Ana. Three 
years later, they married and moved to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Tony competed on Hawaii's track team, throwing the javelin, and Stephanie 
competed in weightlifting, setting a world record in 1976 for the 114-pound 
division, with a 225-pound squat. 
</P>
<P>
Rocky, who played volleyball at Cal State Long Beach, and Cammy, who after UCLA 
played professionally in Italy for two years, competed in the United States 
Volleyball Assn. national championships in Dayton, Ohio, two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Rocky, playing in the men's 30-and-over division, led his team to the title, 
and was named most valuable player. Cammy, playing on the club level, also 
helped her team win a national title. 
</P>
<P>
Rocky and Cammy aren't the only Ciarellis competing on a national level, 
though.

Saturday, Allison Ciarelli, 10, and Maryn Ciarelli, 8, daughters of Tony and 
Stephanie, competed in The Athletics Congress age-group track and field 
national championships at Berkeley. Allison won the national championship in 
the high jump. 
</P>
<P>
This makes all the Ciarellis happy, of course, but grandmother Ciarelli most of 
all. 
</P>
<P>
"With all the girls in high school competing in full-court basketball, track 
and everything, it's so great to see," Sue Ciarelli said. "And though my 
granddaughters may not choose to do sports when they get older, at least 
they'll have the opportunities."

SAVANNA'S ABDI TRANSFERS TO HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forward Mustaphi Abdi of Savanna High School, the Orange League's most valuable 
player as a sophomore, has transferred to Huntington Beach High for his junior 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Abdi, 6-foot-3, averaged 18 points and 11 rebounds last season to lead Savanna 
to a 24-3 record. He became only the third sophomore in 15 years to earn The 
Times' All-County honors, joining Tom Lewis of Mater Dei and Jamal Garner of 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Abdi moved into Huntington Beach's attendance area with his brother 
and mother and began playing for the Oilers' summer basketball team on Tuesday.

LAGUNA OPEN VOLLEYBALL TOURNAMENT; 
</P>
<P>
DVORAK TAKES A WORKING VACATION; 
</P>
<P>
WEARY OF TRAVEL, HE MAKES FEW STOPS ON THE PRO TOUR 
</P>

<P>
Financially, Dusty Dvorak has come a long way from his post-Olympic days. 
</P>
<P>
Though he won't say quite how much money he is making, Dvorak, a graduate of 
Laguna Beach High School and a member of the United States 1984 Olympic 
gold-medal-winning volleyball team, has been making quite a comfortable living 
for himself and wife, Wendi, these past two years playing the sport in Parma, 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
He will say that his financial situation has "gone beyond his wildest 
expectations." 
</P>
<P>
Dvorak, who is back in the U.S. for the summer, hopes to increase his wealth 
even more -- $20,625 more. 
</P>
<P>
That's the men's first-place share of the 35th Laguna Open, which began 
Saturday and continues at 9 a.m. today at Laguna's Main Beach. 
</P>
<P>
He is just one of several local world-class men's players who are getting a 
chance to play at Laguna Beach because of a scheduling conflict. 
</P>
<P>
The top 32 players on the men's professional tour are obligated by contract to 
play in a Manhattan Beach tournament sponsored by the Assn. of Volleyball 
Professionals this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"The top beach players are not here, but it doesn't mean that the level is a 
step below because there are some very good beach players here who haven't been 
playing on the tour," said Dvorak, who was invited to play in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Dvorak, 30, is obviously good enough to play the beach tour, but he 
concentrated on the Olympics during his eight years with the junior national 
and national men's teams. 
</P>
<P>
"The life style, all the traveling was not a lot of fun," said Dvorak, who has 
real-estate holdings in Laguna Beach. "I was willing to do it for six or seven 
years but I didn't want to make a career of it. I wasn't one of those athletes 
who was hanging on to try to do more. I moved on and now I'm enjoying my 
married life." 
</P>
<P>
And Dvorak doesn't find the pace of the pro tour attractive. 
</P>
<P>
"They have tournaments every weekend. You have to hop on an airplane every 
Friday and return every Wednesday. I'm just too busy with business to be able 
to do that full time. 
</P>
<P>
"What is life for if you're going to be always traveling and never having a 
chance to enjoy?" 
</P>
<P>
Dvorak almost didn't play the Laguna Open. His partner, University of Arizona 
basketball player Judd Buechler, canceled at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
Dvorak made a few phone calls and came up with Mike Whitmarsh, primarily a 
basketball player from San Diego who has been playing in West Berlin the past 
three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
They had never played together and got in only an hour's practice Friday. 
Seeded seventh, they lost their match Saturday, 15-13, to 10th-seeded Kevin 
Cleary and Dana McFarland, which means they will have to win the losers' 
bracket to have a shot at the championship. Dvorak-Whitmarsh got a bye in the 
first round of the losers' bracket. 
</P>
<P>
The top-seeded team of Pete Aronchick and Mark Eller advanced to the 
quarterfinals. Scott Fortune -- another Laguna Beach graduate and an 1988 
Olympian -- and partner John Ribarich ended up in the losers' bracket after 
losing their second-round match to Greg Kiernan and Scott Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's division, defending champion and top-seeded Janice Opalinski, of 
Dana Hills and UC Irvine, and partner Linda Chisholm led in their first match, 
6-1, but Sue Holmes and Rosie Bergin fought back to tie the score, 10-10 before 
Opalinski served out the match to win, 15-10. 
</P>
<P>
Opalinski and Chisholm defeated Sharky Zartman and Deb Richardson, 15-2, to 
earn a spot in the women's quarterfinal.

CREDIT CARDS ARE EVERYWHERE IN PLASTIC SOCIETY -- AND MORE ARE COMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LENA H. SUN, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You can't leave home without them. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody's wallet bulges with the plastic rectangles that Americans used last 
year to charge nearly $390 billion worth of goods and services, from food to 
clothes to gasoline to theater tickets. Even prostitutes accept credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone can or must use a card," said Alex Hart, president of New York-based 
MasterCard International Inc. the nation's third-largest credit card company. 
"It's almost impossible to rent a car or cash a check without a credit card." 
</P>
<P>
There's no doubt: America has become a plastic society. 
</P>
<P>
On average, each household qualified to carry a general-purpose credit card 
(Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover or Diners Club) has at least 
three such cards. 
</P>
<P>
Add in the cards issued by retailers, oil companies and long-distance telephone 
services, and the typical American is carrying around an average of eight 
credit cards, according to H. Spencer Nilson, publisher of the Nilson Report, a 
newsletter that covers the credit-card industry. 
</P>
<P>
And more are on the way. Despite the dominance by the Big Three -- Visa, 
MasterCard and American Express -- other players are looking to get into the 
lucrative American credit-card market. 
</P>
<P>
JCB, Japan's largest bank-related credit-card company, has made arrangements 
for its card to be accepted in the United States, and American Telephone &amp; 
Telegraph Co. hinted in May that it might convert its long-distance calling 
cards into general-purpose credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
They would join another relatively new competitor, Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 
whose Discover card has been on the market for three years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seeking New Uses 
</P>
<P>
At the same time the credit-card companies are fighting among themselves for 
more ways to hold onto their customers while finding new ways for people to use 
the cards. 
</P>
<P>
"The card pollution shows no sign of abating anytime soon," said John Love, 
publisher of Credit Card News, a Chicago-based newsletter. "There is no 
question that there is a battle for wallet space. It is intense and will get 
even greater." 
</P>
<P>
All this leaves some industry observers wondering about saturation of the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
"Does the world need another credit card?" Blair Shick asks rhetorically. He is 
a consultant at Arthur D. Little, a Cambridge, Mass.-based research firm. 
</P>
<P>
In the long run, analysts predict an industry shakeout that could greatly 
reduce the amount of plastic Americans will need to carry around. 
</P>
<P>
Some future-thinkers in the industry even see advances in electronics 
technology paving the way for a single device that consumers could use to do 
everything from taking money out of the bank to paying for the groceries. 
</P>
<P>
But most experts think it's unlikely that Americans will readily give up their 
plastic. 
</P>
<P>
"What is technically possible is not what is culturally desired," Love said. 
"It's taken a long while to amass those cards, and it will take a long while to 
get them out" of the wallet. Americans, especially baby boomers, are accustomed 
to the idea of credit, particularly flexible credit, and are paying for more 
items with plastic. 
</P>
<P>
Visa and MasterCard, which are issued by banks, allow consumers to pay off 
their purchases over time. The banks that issue the cards typically charge an 
annual fee as well as an interest rate on the unpaid balance. Those rates 
usually are several points above the prime lending rate -- making credit cards 
highly profitable businesses for banks. 
</P>
<P>
Sears' Discover card is a bank card, does not charge an annual fee and offers 
small rebates on purchases. Holders of American Express and Diners Club cards, 
which carry higher annual fees than bank cards, are required to pay off their 
balances each month but offer users a variety of other services, such as travel 
insurance. American Express also issues the Optima bank card. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to have one card, perhaps a travel and entertainment card where you 
pay off the balance every month, but it's also nice to have a low-interest 
card, where you can put purchases you can't pay off right away," said John 
Pollock, editor and publisher of Bank Credit Card Observer, a New Jersey-based 
industry newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
Any new entrants into the credit-card derby will have to prove that they can 
offer something that the existing card companies do not, according to Michael 
Goldstein, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, a New York investment management 
and research firm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Need Something Special 
</P>
<P>
Without enough differentiation to make it special, or a large base of merchants 
that accept it, a new card has a hard time gaining broad customer popularity, 
as illustrated by the experience of Citicorp's short-lived Choice card. 
</P>
<P>
Choice, a bank card that did not charge an annual fee and paid rebates to 
users, was launched by the big New York bank in the early 1980s in the 
Baltimore-Washington area. But it failed to assemble a broad enough network of 
merchants that accepted it, and Citicorp decided in 1987 to convert the 3.2 
million Choice cards to Visa cards. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed broader acceptance to make it appeal to more members," said Jim 
Bailey, Citibank's group executive in charge of MasterCard and Visa business in 
the United States. "We decided to improve that card by giving it a broader 
acceptance, making it part of the Visa network." 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough sledding in this market," said Edwin M. Cooperman, president of 
American Express Travel Related Services-North America, which oversees American 
Express's card business. "It's one thing to come in and offer a card. It's 
another thing to make money." 
</P>
<P>
That will be the challenge facing JCB and AT&amp;T if they decide to enter the 
U.S. credit-card business on a broad scale. 
</P>
<P>
JCB recently signed an agreement with Bank of America that will allow Japanese 
tourists and business travelers visiting the United States to use the JCB cards 
-- with a logo of red, green and blue stripes enclosed in a black border -- at 
Bank of America's network of more than 60,000 merchants nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"Although their merchant base is in Asia and the Pacific, they are increasingly 
signing merchants in the United States," said MasterCard's Hart. "They will be 
a factor in the market." 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T's possible entry is even more interesting. The big telephone company 
is thinking about converting its 40 million phone cards into general-purpose 
credit cards, a move that could send many in the industry scrambling because of 
AT&amp;T's sheer size and technological expertise. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T has not disclosed any details about its plans, but some industry 
experts say they believe that the giant telephone company will put out the 
cards in conjunction with a bank that issues Visa or MasterCard cards. 
</P>
<P>
For AT&amp;T to gain a market niche, it will have to win customers who already 
carry one of the existing general-purpose credit cards, experts say. Besides, 
"you don't have to carry a telephone card to use it," Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Problems With Discover 
</P>
<P>
One recent newcomer to the credit-card fray that has found it tough going is 
Sears' Discover card, which was launched in 1986 and rang up pretax losses of 
more than $400 million in its first two years, apparently because it signed up 
more non-paying customers than Sears thought possible. 
</P>
<P>
"Discover has given away the card; it has a very low merchant base; (Sears has) 
spent hundreds of millions of dollars," Cooperman said. "The jury is still 
out." 
</P>
<P>
About one-quarter of Discover's business is coming from use at Sears stores, 
according to Shick, too high a percentage if the company really hopes to make 
Discover a general-purpose card. "Discover hasn't been terribly exciting," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But that may be changing. Discover tripled its earnings in the first quarter of 
this year to $20.1 million from $6.1 million a year ago. Montgomery Securities 
analyst Ed Weller forecasts that Discover will earn $50 million in 1989, up 
from $19 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Love, encouraged by Discover's $6 billion in charge volume last year, said he 
no longer is skeptical about the ability of the card to survive. "It's the 
turnaround story this year," he said. "I think it's over the hump. I think it 
will be around." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Discover's start-up problems indicate how tough and competitive 
the credit-card business can be, and for that reason many experts foresee a 
two-tiered shakeout ahead in the increasingly overcrowded field. 
</P>
<P>
The big banks, which are the main issuers of bank cards, are getting bigger and 
swallowing the credit-card operations of smaller banks. At the same time, 
general-purpose credit cards are steadily taking business away from retail and 
oil-company cards. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's top 10 banks now account for 37% of the nearly 200 million Visa 
and MasterCard cards in the United States, up from 32% only a few years ago, 
according to Nilson. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, consumers in this decade have been charging 16% more each year on 
their general-purpose cards, while choosing to ring up fewer purchases on their 
retail and oil-company cards. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen percent of department store sales are now charged on general credit 
cards, up from 8% to 10% five years ago, according to a report by Sanford C. 
Bernstein. And general credit cards are now used for 6% of all gas-station 
purchases, up from 1% five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The card companies are moving to expand their business still further by 
offering customers more outlets where their cards can be used. The companies 
have their eye on the $2.9 trillion worth of U.S. transactions that still take 
place with cash and checks. Bradford Morgan, executive vice president of Visa 
USA, calls that "almost virgin territory." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eye Fast-Food Area 
</P>
<P>
The desire to tap some of that potential is one reason why American Express, 
Visa and MasterCard all have been exploring the $65 billion fast-food market, 
where 99% of the transactions still are done in cash, despite some limited 
experiments in paying for burgers, shakes and fries with plastic. 
</P>
<P>
Visa has done test-marketing with Arby's and Wendy's outlets, using a system 
that speeds up the card-verification process, and now is conducting tests with 
McDonald's. MasterCard executives have said the company plans to begin a 
test-marketing program with a fast-food chain by the end of the year, and even 
American Express, whose card is more often associated with the power lunch, has 
begun a test with Domino's Pizza in lower Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
"We've learned that prestige comes from having the card, not from where the 
card can be used," said American Express's Cooperman. 
</P>
<P>
While finding new markets for card use, card issuers also are working to add 
new users and keep existing customers by offering more services -- such as 
buyer protection and travel-assistance options -- to specific segments of the 
population. 
</P>
<P>
"Standard plastic will not sell any more," Love said. 
</P>
<P>
American Express, for example, has introduced a host of new services in the 
last few years, such as Buyers Assurance (to replace lost or stolen 
merchandise), Buyers Protection (a warranty plan) and the Optima credit card, 
and has made efforts to market its card better to such segments of the 
population as working women, college students and senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the American Express card's Global Assist feature, which provides 
a toll-free phone number to guide travelers to local sources of medical and 
legal assistance, is provided to all cardholders but was developed with older 
vacationers in mind. 
</P>
<P>
American Express also will invest an estimated $100 million over the next few 
years on a processing-system overhaul that it calls Project Genesis. The new 
system will vastly expand the card operation's capacity to store and analyze 
individual data about American Express cardholders, so that more customized 
services can be targeted directly at them. 
</P>
<P>
With a nod to the world of marketing, bank-card issuers also have tried to 
create unique identities for their MasterCard and Visa cards by forging 
alliances with charities, airlines and others to offer "affinity cards." 
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, more than 3,000 affinity-card programs have sprung up, 
offering MasterCard and Visa cards with links to organizations ranging from the 
Sierra Club to sports teams. There's even an Elvis Presley bank card. The 
organizations receive a small percentage of the sales charged on the cards. 
</P>
<P>
There also are "co-branded" cards, jointly issued by banks and major airlines, 
whose holders can get frequent-flier miles based on the amount of purchases 
they charge to the cards. And in another twist, Limited Inc., the Columbus, 
Ohio-based women's clothing chain, recently received approval to form a 
credit-card bank that will allow it to issue MasterCard and Visa cards carrying 
a Limited logo. 
</P>
<P>
In the future, some in the industry see the piece of plastic in your wallet 
developing into a powerful tool with which people can pay for virtually any 
product or service. And even as credit-card companies want to make cash and 
checks extinct, advances in technology could one day make the credit card -- at 
least as we know it -- a thing of the past. 
</P>
<P>
The "smart card" -- a piece of plastic with a computer chip in it -- is 
expected to take over the functions of a credit card someday as well as act as 
a debit card, with which consumers could pay for purchases and have the amount 
automatically deducted from their bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
"Smart cards are coming," said Darold Hoops, senior vice president of 
electronic-services management at MasterCard International. "It's only a matter 
of when."
