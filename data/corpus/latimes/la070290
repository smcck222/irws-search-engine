JACK SMITH: A DAUNTING PROSPECT: GOD AS RANDOM CHANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In writing recently about human creativity and the origin of life -- two 
subjects that are well over my head -- I observed that I regarded life as the 
product of Random Chance. 
</P>
<P>
Several readers have pointed out that this is probably a misinterpretation of 
Darwin's theory of evolution, and is outmoded by modern scientific thought. 
</P>
<P>
I feel obliged to say how I came about that notion. I was walking one day along 
the beach in front of our Baja house when it suddenly occurred to me that God's 
name was Random Chance. (Thus the capital letters). It was a flash of 
intuition. Scientists say human life is far too complex to have evolved by 
random chance, though chance certainly played a part in it. As several readers 
have pointed out, Richard Dawkins, in "The Blind Watchmaker," holds that the 
universe evolved, without design, by what he calls "cumulative selection." 
Stephen Jay Gould, in "Wonderful Life," calls this force "contingency," 
observing that A became B and B became C and C became D, and so on, each stage 
being contingent on the last. Both hold that blind chance could not have 
produced life. 
</P>
<P>
But both deny that there was any design, any purpose, or any watchmaker. 
</P>
<P>
I hate to give up the name Random Chance, which has served me very well, but 
one must adjust one's beliefs to the new theories of the scientists. It just 
won't do to say "Contingency Chance," or "Cumulative Selection." I liked Random 
Chance because it sounded like a river-boat gambler. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, J. David Archibald, professor of biology at San Diego State 
University, chides me for saying that "life is the product of random chance, 
but that cannot be proved, and some scientists deny it." 
</P>
<P>
Prof. Archibald points out that science can prove nothing: "There are differing 
views on how science progresses, but one common precept is that science cannot 
prove anything to be true. Rather, it proposes theories that have the potential 
of being falsified, though totally falsifying a theory is not even possible." 
</P>
<P>
Does that mean that if I say God's name is Random Chance they can't prove it 
isn't true? 
</P>
<P>
Prof. Archibald says no: "Even though we have far more questions than answers 
about the origin of life, we do know with as much certainty as one has in 
science that the combination of elements and molecules to form early life was 
far from being a totally random process." 
</P>
<P>
Thayer Smith writes again to say that in summarizing the calculations of Boyd 
Benson, professor of mathematics at Rio Hondo Community College, I did not 
grasp the magnitude of Prof. Benson's conclusion. The question was, how long 
would it take a billion monkeys to correctly type the first paragraph of 
Dickens' "A Tale of Two Cities." 
</P>
<P>
Smith suggests that I was "daunted" by the figures and backed off from quoting 
them, merely noting Prof. Benson's monumental understatement that it would take 
"too long to be considered." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, I was daunted. I talked to Prof. Benson on the telephone, and 
although he verified what I took to be his conclusions, I could not believe 
them. Smith reminds me that the figure was 15 billion (the age of the universe) 
times 6 followed by 888 zeros. Smith typed out the zeros, which took two-thirds 
of a page. 
</P>
<P>
Dawkins sets a simpler task for a baby, a monkey or a random computer: typing, 
at random, the phrase "Methinks it is like a weasel." He says it would take 
about a million million million million million years. However, he says, if a 
computer is programmed to examine each letter and choose those that most 
resemble the target phrase, the results are rather faster. He programmed a 
computer that did it in 11 seconds. That is the difference between random 
chance and cumulative selection. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Karugg and Bill Stewart each sent me a copy of "Inflexible Logic," a short 
story by Russell Maloney in which a wealthy dilettante named Bainbridge sets 
six chimpanzees at work on typewriters in his conservatory. At once they begin 
typing out such classics as Trevelyan's "Life of Macaulay," the Confessions of 
St. Augustine, "Vanity Fair" and the Essays of Montaigne -- letter perfect, 
page after page. A scientist, Prof. Mallard, is so deranged by this astounding 
feat that he arrives armed one day and shoots all the monkeys to death. He and 
Bainbridge then kill each other. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps I should take a lesson from that story and quit fooling around with 
things I don't understand. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, who knows when I might be hit by another flash of intuition?

THE CONSUMER MUST CUT THIS EVIL CHAIN; 
</P>
<P>
DRUG WAR: ERADICATION PUNISHES ONLY THE FARMER, WHO'D GROW LEGAL EXPORT CROPS 
IF THEY EARNED A FAIR MARKET PRICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GUSTAVO GONZALEZ BAEZ, Gustavo Gonzalez Baez is the minister for narcotics 
matters at Mexico's embassy in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The crime of drug use involves not just the individual consumer but an endless 
chain of individuals -- society, the state, the human race. 
</P>
<P>
The pervasiveness of this evil has no limits, and thus presents a serious 
threat to the national security and sovereignty of many countries. It also is a 
threat to the international economic system, as the multimillion profits 
generated from drug trafficking are channeled into legal operations, including 
massive investments in the world's major stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is important to continue with eradication and law-enforcement 
programs, we must understand that the problem is not just a struggle between 
cops and criminals, and cannot be resolved simply by increasing the number of 
weapons, policemen, aircraft, military units, prosecutions and prisons. Since 
1981, while the drug-enforcement effort has quintupled, prices have fallen by 
three-quarters and consumption has soared astronomically. 
</P>
<P>
We must look for the causes of drug abuse: What leads a person to use and abuse 
drugs. Is it loneliness? The desire to flee unbending social patterns? The loss 
of family values? Professional frustration? Or is it just fashionable? 
</P>
<P>
We also must look at the other end of the spectrum and ask why extremely poor 
campesinos in Asia and Latin America farm the opium poppy, coca leaf, 
marijuana. Is it because they have a direct interest in poisoning and enslaving 
millions of consumers in highly industrialized countries? Or has economic 
injustice driven the campesinos to cultivate products for which there is a high 
demand in the First World? 
</P>
<P>
Then we must ask: Shouldn't we be taking steps toward reaching international 
economic justice, so that traditional agricultural products and raw materials 
produced by developing countries can be sold at fair prices and peasants don't 
have to cultivate drugs to make a living? Coca emerged in the 1980s as the 
single most profitable export cash crop of Peru and Bolivia. The two countries 
produce 90% of the coca leaf processed into cocaine for the international 
market. Most of the rest is produced in Colombia, which controls 80% of the 
export trade in cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
The different links in the chain do not share equally in profitability. The 
costs associated with the initial stages of drug production -- cultivation, 
refining and transportation to the point of export -- account for only 8% of 
the price in the retail market, where the most profitable activities take 
place. For every dollar spent on marijuana or heroin in the United States, the 
farmers earn between 7 and 9 cents; coca farmers earn even less, only 1 to 3 
cents per dollar paid by the users. 
</P>
<P>
It is not the peasants who are the criminals; the real criminals are the 
middlemen -- those who seek to become immensely rich at the expense of the 
addiction of young people all over the world. It is not idle to point out that 
the peasants who cultivate drugs in Latin America and Asia live in extreme 
poverty and have resorted to farming these products because there is a greater 
demand for them in industrial countries than for their traditional crops. If 
governments eradicate coca, marijuana or poppy fields, they must offer the 
campesinos some realistic economic alternatives. Otherwise, the farmers will 
simply start anew elsewhere. Similarly, if governments attack drug consumption, 
they should immediately offer rehabilitation to addicts. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the decisive factor in bringing the drug war to a favorable end is 
the consumer. Drug consumption is not a disease against which we can mount 
eradication campaigns on an international level; it is a voluntarily acquired 
vice, and conquering it requires the personal action of the consumer.

L.A. COUNTY SPENDING PRIORITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After reading Joe Domanick's commentary on "L.A. Turns Its Back on Its People" 
(Commentary, June 20), I was appalled to see the cuts our county Board of 
Supervisors are planning to make in vital humans services -- closing down to 
more mental health clinics, in addition to the nine already closed; closing the 
only children's hospital in the county system, the Pediatric Pavilion at 
County-USC Medical Center; eliminating all pediatric services from Martin 
Luther King Hospital; drastically reducing outpatient services and shutting 
down 41 public health centers. 
</P>
<P>
By failing to supervise and discipline the Sheriff's Department, the county has 
had to pay more than $8.5 million in judgments to victims of excessive force 
and brutality in the last three years. In the past year the County Department 
of Children's Services has paid more than $18 million in settlements because it 
has taken children who were abused and neglected and placed them in foster 
homes where they were again abused, sexually molested, beaten and neglected. 
</P>
<P>
The county's problems are part of a larger problem that pervades our whole 
society and threatens to destroy our democratic system -- a lack of 
responsibility. How can we expect our elected officials to act responsibly and 
serve the needs of the people when the people are sending the politicians the 
message that they don't care enough about their government even to vote. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, I went up to Sacramento to lobby the state Legislature for increased 
funding of our social programs -- for education, health care, children's 
services, etc. What I heard there was very discouraging. The state has a $3.6 
billion shortfall in the budget, and funding for the social welfare programs 
will be cut rather than increased. Gov. George Deukmejian intends to leave this 
problem for the Democratic majority in the Legislature and the next governor to 
deal with. That way, the Republicans can demagogue the issue again and blame 
the Democrats for raising taxes or making drastic cuts in social services. 
</P>
<P>
When I attempted to encourage legislators to show a little political courage 
and deal responsibly with our state's problems, I was told that the people 
don't care anyway. Look at the low voter turnout in this June's primary 
election. It's politics as usual in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
There is a saying that people get the kind of government they deserve. But how 
about the abused and neglected children, the working poor with no health 
insurance, the mentally ill and the homeless? How about those of us who do try 
to exercise our civic duties by becoming informed voters, studying the issues 
and candidates' records, writing to and visiting our legislators, etc. Is this 
the government that we deserve?

EL SALVADOR'S CRISTIANI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is unclear for whose benefit Jefferson Morley ("What We're Paying for in El 
Salvador," Opinion, June 17) lambastes El Salvador's president, Alfredo 
Cristiani, and Congress' decision to financially back him. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it's for the benefit of the FMLN (the Communist guerrilla group that is 
waging war against the Salvadoran government) or for just the usual media. In 
any case, he does not speak for the proud Salvadoran people who give Cristiani 
a 72% approval rating.

U.S. SUPREME COURT OVERTURNS 'OPINION DEFENSE' IN LIBEL CASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Another blow has been struck against personal freedom in the U.S. Supreme 
Court's libel decision ("Supreme Court Strips Away 'Opinion' as Libel Defense," 
Part A, June 22). In a systematic way, the rights of the individual have been 
curtailed in this country, not for the benefit of the whole nation but in 
conformity with a narrow interpretation of a conservative vocal minority. 
</P>
<P>
Almost imperceptibly, thought control has become institutionalized. A litmus 
test of adherence to beliefs has been tacitly imposed. The voice of dissent has 
been stifled; no longer are different opinions tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
In recent events two messages are clear. One, ideas are more dangerous than 
guns and, thus, need more control. Also, writers of letters to the editor: 
Beware! 
</P>
<P>
Of course, this is just an opinion.

1984 is here, six years late. Conrad's cartoon makes the point that the libel

Now our government has apparently decided on "thought control" beyond its 
attacks on free speech and a free press.

<P>
Now The Supreme Court has ruled that the media, and even individuals, can be 
sued for libel even when statements are made as opinion. 
</P>
<P>
This is my opinion: This wrinkled pack of rabid fascist dogs have gone far 
enough in trying to restrict our rights. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist is 
a prime candidate for euthanasia, although, even when dead, worms would avoid 
his carcass like feminists avoid adult bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
If Rehnquist, or one of his ancient cronies, wants to sue me for libel, then so 
be it. As King Lear said, "Let it come down."

<P>
In response to "Is It Opinion or Is It Fact?" editorial, June 23: 
</P>
<P>
This letter is from one who seldom reads Times' editorials because of their 
liberal bias and slanted opinions. 
</P>
<P>
Your use of such inflammatory and one-sided words in this editorial as though 
they were true illustrates my point: "huge setback;" "astonishing 
recklessness;" "ignored the standard;" "chilling;" "chaos and contradiction." 
</P>
<P>
It would appear that your mean position, far from a noble cry of protection of 
free speech, is in reality the whine of a culprit who has with impunity defamed 
the innocent with words that "imply an assertion of objective fact." 
</P>
<P>
It is now time to be more careful, sensitive and fair.

FOOTNOTES: TOWERING NEIGHBORS

Now, here's an irony. A director of Good Guys, a Bay Area electronics retailer 
that opened its first Los Angeles store Sunday, is Russ Solomon, president of 
Tower Records. But the Good Guys store, in the Beverly Connection at Third 
Street and La Cienega Boulevard, sits next to a Wherehouse, another big music 
retailer. 
</P>
<P>
What gives? 
</P>
<P>
"We put the stores where people like to shop," Ron Unkefer, founder and 
president of Good Guys, said of the decision to select the site. But never 
fear, Tower. As Good Guys expands in Southern California, Unkefer added, "we do 
expect to do some deals with Tower."

Ecology Comes to the Fore 
</P>
<P>
"Green" has not normally brought to golfers' minds lofty thoughts of saving the 
planet or even their neighborhoods. But that may be about to change, whether 
they like it or not. 
</P>
<P>
As Grant Spaeth, president of the U.S. Golf Assn. recently warned, golf courses 
are coming under attack from environmentalists concerned that new ones may be 
covering wetlands and wildlife habitat and that new and old may be 
contaminating local ground-water supplies with pesticides and herbicides. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe it's a real concern to them (environmentalists)," Spaeth told a 
convention of Utah golfers. "The problem we're having is we don't have the data 
to show whether they're wrong or whether the chemicals can be used safely." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, said Spaeth, who cited environmentalist opposition to a proposed 
new course near his home in Palo Alto, the USGA is throwing everything it has 
into the fight. "It's a very, very major focal point of our resources," he 
said. 
</P>

<P>
Opening the Door to Jobs 
</P>
<P>
Business boosters like to call Southern California the Gateway to the Pacific 
Basin. But what does that mean? Well, it means jobs, for one thing -- 63,049 of 
them, according to the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Among Pacific nations, Japan leads the way as a Southern California employer 
with 528 companies accounting for 49,900 jobs in the region. Australia comes in 
second, with 121 companies that employ 7,300 Southern Californians. Other big 
Pacific-based employers are Hong Kong (1,855 jobs), South Korea (1,620) and 
Taiwan (1,240). At the lower end of the ladder, firms from China, Malaysia, New 
Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand each employ fewer than 500 
workers in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The jobs come in many forms. In a new directory of Pacific-based companies, the 
L.A. chamber cites their "amazing diversity," pointing to activity in 
advertising, banking, construction, manufacturing, importing, exporting and 
real estate investment.

VENERABLE KABUKI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are several reasons to see the Grand Kabuki Theatre of Japan and three of 
the best are named Nakamura. They are Nakamura Kichiemon II, son of the late 
Matsumoto Koshiro VIII, grandson of the great Kichiemon I and current artistic 
director of the company; Nakamura Kotaro V, next in line as successor to the 
exceptional Bando Tamasaburo as an accomplished onnagata (specialist in women's 
roles), and the young up-and-coming Nakamura Kasho III. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Sawamura Sojuro IX, the three Nakamuras constitute this company's 
principal actors, displaying their precise, rigorous comic skills in a set of 
two programs: "Narukami" ("The Thunder God") preceded by "Migawari Zazen" ("The 
Substitute Meditator"), which played the Orange County Performing Arts Center 
Saturday and Sunday -- and the famous "Kanjincho" ("The Subscription Scroll") 
paired with "Osome Hisamatsu Ukina No Yomiuri" (subtitled "Osome no Yonyaku" or 
"Osome's Four Characters"), an onnagata showpiece, which will play the Japan 
America Theatre Tuesday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time in 30 years that "Kanjincho," a play derived from the 
classical Noh Theatre of Japan and venerated enough to make the Kabuki Danjuro 
family's 18-best list (Kabuki juhachi-ban), will be performed in Los Angeles. 
This tour also marks the first time American audiences get to see the 
distinguished Kichiemon II, an actor whose reputation as a Kabuki performer is 
matched at home by his celebrity as a film and television star. It is easy to 
see why, given his power, presence and good looks (in or out of Kabuki 
make-up), though this distribution of labor among live ancient and electronic 
modern forms is a relatively new phenomenon -- particularly for descendants of 
a long line of artists molded in a theatrical forge so rigidly bound by 
history, style and convention. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from the mastery he displayed in the twin comic plays at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center Saturday, Kichiemon's brush with modernity has 
done no harm Western eyes could detect to his classical and satirical 
apparatus. Kichiemon was featured as a woman in "Zazen," a piece which, like a 
lot of others in the Kabuki repertoire, is adapted from a Kyogen, or comic Noh 
interlude, called "Hanago." 
</P>
<P>
In it, Kichiemon plays Tamanoi, the possessive wife of a philandering husband, 
Ukyo (played by Sojuro), who tries to find a way to escape her in order to 
visit a lover. After several tries, all foiled by the suspicious wife, Ukyo 
tells her he needs a night of undisturbed meditation to rid himself of evil 
dreams. Tamanoi accedes. Ukyo promptly substitutes his reluctant servant 
(Kasho) as the meditator and runs off on erotic pursuits. When the jealous 
Tamanoi comes to ply him with goodies and uncovers the ruse, she substitutes 
herself for the substitute, and waits for Ukyo's return. 
</P>
<P>
The best of the comedy lay in Ukyo's drunken stagger home from his night of 
revels (down the traditional hanamichi), as he relives his lusty exploits out 
loud. He then regales the person he thinks is his servant with the same 
detailed account. Imagine his surprise when he discovers to whom he's been 
talking. 
</P>
<P>
Kichiemon's Tamanoi seemed more sad than formidable, but this play rightfully 
belongs less to him than to Sojuro, whose elaborate and precise mugging, 
singing and dancing as the weak-willed and deceitful Ukyo was this 
curtain-raiser's centerpiece. 
</P>
<P>
"Narukami," a tale of seduction and duplicity -- or get the priest -- was more 
complex, more evenhanded with its bravura turns and more dazzling. Here 
Kichiemon played a hermit priest, Narukami, who punishes the emperor (against 
whom he bears a grudge) by trapping the rain god in a nearby pool and creating 
a drought. In desperation, the emperor sends the beautiful princess Taema 
(Tokaro) to seduce him and release the dragon. 
</P>
<P>
What transpires is delicious, including some delightfully comic asides by two 
acolyte priests (played by Nakamura Mannojo and Nakamura Kichisaburo) and the 
unhurried, highly erotic and ribald seduction of Narukami by the enchanting 
Taema. 
</P>
<P>
Kichiemon's transformation from priest and helpless lover into a raging Thunder 
God of ferocious demeanor and wild, flying hair is a galvanic example of 
aragoto (warpath technique), while Tokaro's accomplished feminine wiles, 
seductive stratagems and satirical timing confirm his standing as a rising 
onnagata star. 
</P>
<P>
The extraordinary aspect of Kabuki performance is its astonishing combination 
of elements and skills: music, song, quasi-choreographed movement, vivid sets, 
costumes, traditions and make-up, all regulated within an inch of their lives 
and yet serving the most jocular, classy and captivating fairy tales. Nothing 
more serendipitously addresses the dreamer and faker in us all. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Japan America Theatre, 224 S. San Pedro St., Tuesday at 8 p.m. and 
Wednesday at 2 p.m. $45-$50; (213) 680-3700.

REWARDS FROM GREEN AT N.Y. FEST

<P>
As the JVC Jazz Festival moved into its final weekend, one of the most 
rewarding concerts was performed Friday before a small audience at the intimate 
Weill Recital Hall by the 27-year-old pianist Benny Green. 
</P>
<P>
After attracting interest for several years through appearances and recordings 
with Betty Carter, Art Blakey and others, Green today is moving rapidly into 
the front rank of young, bop-inspired acoustic improvisers. Never on record has 
his technique been so impressive, nor his use of it more felicitous than on 
this occasion. 
</P>
<P>
He opened with a somewhat bland treatment of "Namely You," then warmed up with 
a tender "Come Sunday" and "Starcrossed Lovers" by Ellington and Strayhorn. It 
was during Bud Powell's "Celia" that his true self-image appeared. He attacked 
the fast-moving bop theme voraciously, playing it simultaneously in parallel 
lines with both hands. 
</P>
<P>
Later he applied this doubled-up process to improvised lines, executed with 
astonishing dexterity. His affection for the bop era was faithfully recalled in 
his treatment of Monk's ballad "Ruby My Dear." 
</P>
<P>
Green is a student of the veteran pianist Walter Bishop Jr., who was in the 
audience. Bishop can take pride in his bright young protege. 
</P>
<P>
Later, next door at Carnegie Hall, Stan Getz made one of his now-rare 
appearances (since a bout with cancer two years ago he has paced himself 
carefully). With Dexter Gordon, Zoot Sims and Al Cohen gone, the ranks of the 
great tenor saxophonists are thinning; Getz is the last of a vital creative 
breed. 
</P>
<P>
Any concert that offers an opportunity to hear Getz play Billy Strayhorn's 
"Blood Count" is, ipso facto, richly rewarding. He applied his nonpareil sound 
and wrenching emotion to this work, as well as to Mal Waldron's "Soul Eyes" and 
Johnny Mandel's "El Cajon" (dedicated to the late Al Cohen). 
</P>
<P>
Getz was matched by the consistently swinging Kenny Barron, who has been his 
pianist off and on since 1974; by Alex Blake, who on one tune doubled his bass 
lines with vocals a la Slam Stewart; and by the young, occasionally obtrusive 
drummer Terri Lyne Carrington. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the concert involved two additional musicians, playing 
synthesizers. One of them, Eddie del Barrio, wrote or co-wrote several of the 
tunes for the latest Getz album. On these numbers Blake switched to electric 
bass and Getz, who had dispensed with the mike entirely on some of the quartet 
pieces, was amplified. With the exception of Mike Lang's engaging "Lonely 
Lady," these were sextet experiments in largely overall sound while reducing 
the impact of Getz's solos. 
</P>
<P>
It was a pleasure to see him return, for an encore, with just Kenny Barron, for 
a duo version of Benny Carter's "People Time" that brought out the tonal beauty 
of which he is a master.

'BURGUNDIAN COURT' OPENS SEASON AT GETTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fifth season of summer concerts at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu got 
under way Saturday with a luxurious offering of 15th- and 16th-Century "Music 
at the Burgundian Court," splendidly performed by the Early Music Ensemble of 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Though without a centralized capital, the vast Burgundian Duchy was undoubtedly 
the center of musical Europe, with Guillaume Dufay, canon at Cambrai, leading 
the way for such composers as Busnois, Binchois, Ockeghem and Josquin. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the San Diegans offered 22 works that amply demonstrated the progress 
and richness of the Burgundians' art. 
</P>
<P>
Highlights included Dunstable's "Veni, Creator Spiritus," its spare polyphony 
cerebrally weaving around the solemnly sustained tenor chant; Busnois' "Je ne 
puis vivre," its startling effect made by gently sliding out of polyphony into 
foursquare homophony -- highlighting the text -- then sliding back into it; 
Dufay's landmark motet "Nuper rosarum flores," and his "Flos florum," with its 
surprising, buzzing dissonance. 
</P>
<P>
Expressive music abounded, from "O rosa bella," attributed to Dunstable, which 
is every bit as world-weary as Mahler, to the florid, aching outpouring of 
Josquin's "Plusieurs regretz," sung to the text "All the sorrows of earth, of 
every man and woman, are pleasure compared with my pain." 
</P>
<P>
The performers -- Elisabeth Marti and Constance Lawthers, sopranos; Victoria 
Heins-Shaw contralto; John Peeling, tenor; Philip Larson, bass; Michael Eagan, 
lute -- lived up to the music with precisely tuned and rhythmically clear 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
Their readings went to the core of emotional content, yet were delivered in 
radiant, unforced tones. Robert Winter's lively preconcert commentary, the 
colorful costumes and the location, the Inner Peristyle Garden, added further 
resonance to the occasion. TIMOTHY MANGAN

NEAL STULBERG CONDUCTS BAROQUE ORCHESTRA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The program for the Friday-night event at the now-concluded third E. Nakamichi 
Baroque Music Festival promised "Music for the Coronations," but, even before 
the agenda was changed, that title was stretching it. 
</P>
<P>
"Baroque Mozart," the theme of this year's festival -- the gatherings of 1986 
and 1988 focused on appropriately contrasting motifs -- was to have been 
highlighted in performances of the "Coronation" Concerto and the "Missa 
Solemnis" in C, K. 337. 
</P>
<P>
At the Royce Hall concert, K. 337 was given, though, of course it is not the 
"Coronation" Mass, as some may have been led to believe. That designation 
belongs to the composer's work numbered K. 317. 
</P>
<P>
And, in the event, the "Coronation" Concerto was replaced by the Piano Concerto 
in G, K. 453 "at the request of Malcolm Bilson," the fortepiano soloist, 
according to an insert in the program. 
</P>
<P>
With or without the crowning pieces, this performance by Philharmonia Baroque 
Orchestra, led by Neal Stulberg, turned out festive, stylish and felicitously 
pristine. 
</P>
<P>
All the performers -- conductor Stulberg, the accomplished Bay Area 
instrumental ensemble, the Southern California-based vocal group I Cantori and 
all soloists -- seemed to eschew overstatement in favor of modest savoring of 
the imposing musical values in this agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Bilson made a virtue of articulate but unpushy tempos, myriad stylistic details 
and a directness of statement that never contradicted the seraphic nature of 
the familiar work at hand. 
</P>
<P>
Stulberg and the orchestra brought irresistible grace and subtle resonances to 
the opening German Dances, K. 509. Assisted by I Cantori, they found Mozartean 
sobriety in the ear-opening deeps of the scarey Kyrie in D minor. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in the brief but pithy "Missa Solemnis," all forces -- with vocal 
soloists Judith Nelson, Lisa Turetsky, Frank Kelley and Douglas Lawrence -- 
produced as serious and faceted a reading of this largely unfamiliar 
masterpiece as it deserves. DANIEL CARIAGA

ABORTION FOES STEREOTYPED, SOME IN THE MEDIA BELIEVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SHAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When abortion opponents picketed Turner Broadcasting System last summer to 
protest the showing of a film promoting abortion rights, TBS Chairman Ted 
Turner called the demonstrators "bozos" and "idiots." 
</P>
<P>
Many in the anti-abortion movement say Turner was simply giving public voice to 
what many in the media privately think of their movement. 
</P>
<P>
Some reporters agree. 
</P>
<P>
Journalists tend to regard opponents of abortion as "religious fanatics" and 
"bug-eyed zealots," says Ethan Bronner, legal affairs reporter for the Boston 
Globe, who spent much of last year writing about abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"Opposing abortion, in the eyes of most journalists . . . is not a legitimate, 
civilized position in our society," Bronner says. 
</P>
<P>
Many journalists vigorously deny having this view. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a certain amount of newsroom debate about abortion," says Eugene 
Roberts, executive editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer, "and my general 
impression is that . . . there's a good deal of respect for both sides." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Bettag, executive producer of "The CBS Evening News," says CBS has "a large 
number of people . . . who feel very strongly on both sides" of the abortion 
issue and "that helps us cover it fairly. If we slip, someone inside tells us, 
'Hey, that's loaded.' It's a very constructive, worthwhile debate, a very 
creative process of each side trying to check the other and report this in as 
open-minded a way as you can." 
</P>
<P>
But several reporters who have written a lot about abortion agree with Bronner. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Gorney, who covers abortion for the Washington Post, says she's 
troubled by the media's tendency to portray the anti-abortion movement as 
"dominated by religious crazies" and to "ignore what I think are the very 
understandable and reasoned arguments that are put forth by the pro-life side." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Okie, medical reporter for the Post, says she herself "had a sort of 
mental image of the anti-abortion groups as all being extremists" before she 
began writing much about them. 
</P>
<P>
But Bronner, Gorney and Okie have covered abortion extensively, and they've 
come to realize that there are intelligent, rational, sincere people on both 
sides of what is an extraordinarily complex issue. Few big-city reporters -- or 
editors, television anchors or news directors -- have the opportunity that 
these three have had, though. Abortion is but one of many subjects they deal 
with every day, and because most of their colleagues, associates and friends 
generally share their support for abortion rights, it may be inevitable that 
they have a skewed view of abortion opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"Reporters often say to me, 'Gee, you're reasonable,' as if all pro-life people 
are unreasonable," says Mirianne Rea-Luthin, president of the Value of Life 
Committee of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters even try to perpetuate that stereotype, Rea-Luthin says, by asking 
her to "make sure you look angry" when she's being interviewed on television. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion opponents say the media further stereotype them, not only as fanatics 
but as almost exclusively conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
David Shribman of the Wall Street Journal, who has spent about 40% of his time 
writing about abortion over the past year, says the media is mistaken in 
perpetuating this stereotype. The anti-abortion movement is actually "one of 
the broadest political coalitions in American history," Shribman wrote on Page 
1 of the Wall Street Journal last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Shribman pointed out that the movement includes feminists, opponents of the 
death penalty and people opposed to U.S. military involvement in Central 
America -- all positions customarily associated with liberals. 
</P>
<P>
Journalists insist they try to be fair to both sides, no matter how they feel 
about the people they cover. Much of the time, they are fair. In recent months 
in particular, abortion coverage has often been more evenhanded. Some news 
organizations have even tried, on occasion, to provide explicit balance in 
their coverage by selecting one aspect of the abortion controversy and 
providing opposing viewpoints and experiences on a given day. 
</P>
<P>
The Philadelphia Inquirer did that after the U.S. Supreme Court issued its 
Webster decision a year ago Tuesday, giving states more latitude in regulating 
abortion. The Inquirer published stories on Page 1 about activities at the 
offices of Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life and at the National Abortion 
Rights Action League in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Times has several times done something similar. 
</P>
<P>
Twice last year, The Times published stories on women who had had abortions, 
and in each story, one woman told of deeply regretting her act while the other 
defended hers. The Times also published same-day stories on a women's health 
center where abortions are performed and on a crisis pregnancy center where 
women are encouraged to "deliver babies rather than seek abortions." On two 
other occasions, The Times has paired opposing abortion viewpoints on its 
opinion pages. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to provide balanced abortion coverage sometimes backfire, though. 
</P>
<P>
Early this year, concerned that The Times might have paid more attention to 
abortion-rights advocates than to abortion opponents, editors assigned a 
profile of Susan Carpenter-McMillan, whom the resultant story described as the 
"rich, crisp, stylish, sometimes sarcastic and always emotional media 
representative for the Right to Life League of Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
But in the course of his reporting on McMillan, reporter Paul Dean learned that 
she had had an abortion herself 20 years earlier, long before she began to 
oppose abortion. McMillan had kept the abortion secret from most of her family, 
friends and colleagues, and when Dean wrote about it, she was enraged. 
</P>
<P>
Given McMillan's public stance on abortion, the information was clearly 
relevant to the story. But the controversy it engendered demonstrated anew what 
a minefield the abortion subject has become for the media. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the earnest intentions of most journalists notwithstanding, an 
examination of media coverage of abortion over the past 18 months suggests 
there is often an implicit bias against abortion opponents, and some of that 
bias may stem from the media's stereotypical view of those activists. 
</P>
<P>
This may help explain, for example, why reporters looking for abortion 
opponents to interview, especially on television, sometimes choose people who 
take extreme positions, while quoting and interviewing abortion-rights 
advocates who invariably seem reasonable and reputable. 
</P>
<P>
"The media (are) determined to get people who are inflammatory, who call their 
opponents 'baby-killers'," says Frederica Mathewes-Green, vice president of 
Feminists for Life. 
</P>
<P>
But journalists say they interview the people they find the most relevant, 
articulate, available and outspoken on a given story, and at least one abortion 
opponent and media critic agrees with at least part of that explanation. 
</P>
<P>
L. Brent Bozell III, chairman of the Media Research Center, a conservative 
media monitoring agency just outside Washington, says he doesn't think the 
media's choice of abortion opponents necessarily reflects the "pro-abortion 
bias" to which he thinks the media generally succumb. 
</P>

"It has nothing to do with agenda," he says. "I think it has everything to do 
with . . . journalism. The raunchier the quote, the better it is; the more fire 
and brimstone, the better the story comes out." 
</P>
<P>
Television news executives deny being either biased or sensationalistic. 
</P>
<P>
"We . . . bend over backward . . . to make sure that we don't go for the crazy 
on any particular issue," says Paul Friedman, executive producer of ABC's 
"World News Tonight." "One of the problems we sometimes have on that side of 
the issue is avoiding the people who will do damage to their cause because 
they're so extreme and so almost incoherent on the subject." 
</P>
<P>
John Willke, president of the National Right to Life Committee, the largest 
anti-abortion organization in the nation, is probably the most frequent 
spokesmen for abortion opponents, and he is no extremist. As the Washington 
Post Magazine said in a cover story on him in April, "he clearly takes some 
pleasure in the country doctor aura and assumes in conversation a sort of 
kindly formality . . . . He does not inspire people to passion, or to civil 
disobedience." 
</P>
<P>
But, like activists for any cause, many other abortion opponents are 
belligerent, even fanatical, and Susan Smith, the committee's associate 
legislative director, says bias -- intentional or not -- is the only way to 
explain why some in the media interview them instead. 
</P>
<P>
Judie Brown, president of the American Life League, who opposes contraception 
and who says, "I've been described as a religious fanatic . . . which I don't 
really mind," has often been chosen to represent the anti-abortion side, rather 
than someone from Willke's organization, which takes no position on 
contraception. 
</P>
<P>
Randall Terry, a born-again Christian who likes to brandish a dead fetus in a 
tiny coffin and who founded Operation Rescue, which tries to blockade abortion 
clinics, is another frequent television guest. 
</P>
<P>
But the abortion-rights position is often represented -- and sometimes paired 
on television with either Terry or Brown -- by Faye Wattleton, the calm, 
attractive president of Planned Parenthood of America. In fact, when abortion 
opponents complain about bias against them, they angrily point to the 
descriptions of Wattleton and Terry in the media. 
</P>
<P>
Time magazine headlined its profile of Wattleton last December "Nothing Less 
Than Perfect" and said she was "self-possessed, imperturbable, smoothly 
articulate," "imperially slim and sleekly dressed . . . a stunning refutation 
of the cliche of the dowdy feminist." 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times Magazine put Wattleton on the cover last summer and 
described her as "relentlessly high-minded," "telegenic," "immaculately 
tailored," "a striking six-footer with an aristocratic bearing," "a tough, 
shrewd operator" and said, "Calmly, rationally, every hair in place, she will 
lead the faithful into battle . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
But Terry is almost always described as "a former used car salesman"; the 
Associated Press, New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Washington Post and 
Newsweek, among many others, have all referred to him that way. 
</P>
<P>
The phrase suggests something "a little unscrupulous . . . not quite 
trustworthy," says Eileen McNamara, who spent virtually all of 1989 covering 
abortion for the Boston Globe. 
</P>
<P>
McNamara, who admits having used the "used car dealer" phrase herself in one 
story, says most reporters "try to be fair," but most support abortion rights, 
and "I think we were delighted to find out that he sold used cars." 
</P>
<P>
Critics say the media's bias against abortion opponents is evident not only in 
the stature and characterization of the people they choose to interview but in 
their failure to identify some sources as proponents of abortion rights, thus 
leaving readers and viewers with the mistaken impression that the sources are 
impartial. 
</P>
<P>
The Alan Guttmacher Institute in New York is probably the single-most widely 
quoted source for studies and statistics on abortion, for example, but except 
for the Washington Post, the media rarely point out that the institute is 
special affiliate of Planned Parenthood of America, a major leader in the 
battle for abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
Even in the matter of numbers of sources quoted, the media often favor the 
abortion-rights side. 
</P>
<P>
Counting the number of people quoted in a given story -- or the number of 
inches or the number of photos used, as abortion opponents often do -- is not 
necessarily the best way to evaluate fairness, of course. 
</P>
<P>
As Sig Gissler, editor of the Milwaukee Journal, says: "It's hard to be 
balanced, especially in a given story. There are a lot of subtle factors," 
including deadlines, the availability of sources and "what else is in the news 
that day." What a good news organization tries for, Gissler and others say, is 
"balance over time." But over time -- the first eight months of last year -- 
the New York Times, Washington Post and three network evening news shows 
combined quoted abortion-rights activists 60% more often than activists opposed 
to abortion, according to a study by the Center for Media and Public Affairs in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Kate Michelman, head of the National Abortion Rights Action League, and Molly 
Yard, head of the National Organization for Women, were quoted 76 times during 
this study period. Willke and Terry, the two most frequently quoted 
anti-abortion activists, were quoted 26 times. (President Bush, who also 
opposes abortion, was quoted 22 times.) 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, the media don't quote anyone on the anti-abortion side. 
</P>
<P>
When the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington ruled in April that a pregnant 
woman may refuse medical treatment even if that jeopardizes the survival of her 
fetus, the Los Angeles Times and New York Times each quoted a source praising 
the decision but no one critical of it. When the Louisville Courier Journal 
published a story on a Kentucky law requiring minors to get their parents' 
consent for abortions, it quoted several sources critical of the "extremely 
burdensome" nature of the law but quoted no one who favored the law. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion opponents insist that this failure to give them "fair representation" 
is typical of the "double standard" the media apply to the abortion debate. 
</P>
<P>
The media is generally careful, for example, to include comments from 
abortion-rights advocates in stories about abortion protests, but coverage of 
abortion-rights activities sometimes fail to include balancing comments from 
abortion opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the media rarely illustrate stories on abortion with photographs of 
aborted fetuses -- or even, generally, of developing fetuses -- claiming that 
to do so would be in bad taste and might offend readers. But no such concern 
inhibits the media from showing photos of starving, tragically bloated children 
in Ethiopia. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere is the media's "double standard" more true, critics say, than in the 
treatment given Operation Rescue and other aggressive abortion protesters, on 
the news pages and the editorial pages alike. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion opponents realize that newspapers have the right to express their 
opinions on their editorial page and that, in most newspapers, that opinion 
favors abortion rights. But they don't think most papers apply the same 
standard to them as they do to others involved in public controversies. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion protesters say they have been the victims of police brutality, 
overzealous prosecution and the misapplication of a federal statute designed to 
fight organized crime, and the media have largely failed to defend or even 
question the civil liberties implications of these actions. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the kinds of issues that the media would normally make a big stink 
out of," says Wendy Wright, communications director for Operation Rescue. "But 
they don't stand with us on abortion so they ignore what's being done to us." 
</P>
<P>
Or, as Wright's boss, Randall Terry, likes to say: "Most of the secular media 
has become the lap dog, the ideological slave of the death industry. The fervor 
of their commitment to abortion makes them willingly blind to the abuses and 
injustice that we have faced." 
</P>
<P>
When the federal government used the RICO act -- officially, the 
Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act -- against white collar 
criminals on Wall Street, major editorial pages questioned whether this was an 
appropriate use of a statute originally designed to fight the Mafia and other 
"scurvy hoodlums," in the words of the New York Times. A Los Angeles Times 
editorial said flatly that the RICO act was "out of control and ought to be 
repealed." 
</P>
<P>
But the RICO act is also being invoked in civil suits against Operation Rescue 
(and other abortion protesters), and while the Philadelphia Inquirer, Wall 
Street Journal and a half-dozen or so medium-sized newspapers have 
editorialized against this, most of the major papers -- the New York Times, Los 
Angeles Times, Boston Globe, Chicago Tribune -- have ignored it. (The 
Washington Post included a paragraph critical of this application of the RICO 
act near the bottom of an editorial praising court action against Operation 
Rescue in a non-RICO case). 
</P>
<P>
Editorial page editors deny that bias against the anti-abortion movement has 
influenced their policies. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Rosenthal, editor of the editorial page of the New York Times, says he 
didn't even know RICO was being used against abortion protesters until told of 
it in the course of an interview for this story. Thomas Plate, editor of the 
editorial page of the Los Angeles Times, said the absence of any RICO/abortion 
cases in Los Angeles was largely responsible for his paper not having commented 
on the issue. The Los Angeles Times did include a sentence in an editorial last 
year saying that charging Terry with conspiracy in a non-RICO, Los Angeles case 
was "an excessive restriction on free speech." 
</P>
<P>
But the Los Angeles Times publishes many editorials on subjects with no 
immediate local connection, and newspapers in Phoenix, Lexington, Richmond, St. 
Louis and St. Paul -- all far more locally oriented than The Times -- have 
editorialized vigorously on the use of the RICO act against abortion 
protesters, focusing primarily on a case in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
While supporting conviction of the protesters for trespass and disorderly 
conduct, these papers editorialized that using the RICO act against them was an 
inappropriate restriction of legitimate political protest -- "unfair," 
"unreasonable," "outrageous," "an abomination." 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers have generally covered the various court decisions involving RICO 
and Operation Rescue in their news pages, but there have been few examinations 
of the civil liberties threat that some say this use of the statute poses. The 
Wall Street Journal published such a story in May, but most other RICO stories 
have emphasized its use in white-collar crime cases. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, there have been major media stories asking if the government, in its 
zeal to prosecute drug traffickers, is using "measures that may erode basic 
rights" of the accused, as a Page 1 story in the New York Times put it last 
October. But there have been few stories raising questions about the erosion of 
basic rights by the "police brutality" that Operation Rescue activists have 
alleged in dozens of cities, not even after Congress enacted a law last year 
banning the allocation of certain federal grants to cities that fail to prevent 
such "excessive force." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Times has written two long stories this year -- one on Page 1 
-- about the special weapon (a nunchaku) and special "pain-compliance" 
techniques -- the infliction of pain to force protesters to follow orders -- 
the police have used in these cases, and the Chicago Tribune published a 
similar story last year. But apart from an Op-Ed page column in the Wall Street 
Journal, the subject has been largely ignored by the national media. 
</P>
<P>
Nor has there been a flood of outrage on the nation's editorial pages, as there 
was when civil rights activists here and anti-apartheid activists in South 
Africa accused police of brutality. 
</P>
<P>
Most major editorial pages were equally silent when the U.S. Supreme Court 
earlier this year refused to grant a stay against an injunction prohibiting 
Operation Rescue from demonstrating at abortion clinics in Atlanta. Columnist 
James Kilpatrick, who praised another court decision unfavorable to Operation 
Rescue activities, criticized the Atlanta decision as an unconstitutional prior 
restraint on speech. 
</P>
<P>
"Something is grossly wrong," Kilpatrick wrote, "when the courts tell freeborn 
Americans that they may not speak before they have spoken." A few other 
columnists -- Nat Hentoff, Charles Krauthammer, Mark Shields, Fred Barnes -- 
have criticized the treatment of abortion protesters, but most commentators and 
editorial writers have been largely silent on civil liberties issues involving 
abortion protesters. 
</P>
<P>
It can be argued, of course, that the intimidating tactics used by Operation 
Rescue "traduce any kind of civility and go beyond the limits of reasonable 
discourse," in the words of Jack Rosenthal of the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
Although Operation Rescue says police are responsible for the violence at their 
protests, the courts haven't necessarily agreed. But many Operation Rescue 
protests are not violent, and while they certainly could not be described as 
genteel, many civil rights and anti-war protests weren't genteel in the 1960s 
and 1970s, and the media covered these activities heavily and often defended 
the First Amendment rights of those involved. 
</P>
<P>
Coverage of abortion protesters' problems has been so slight that both 
Rosenthal and Meg Greenfield, editor of the editorial page of the Washington 
Post, said they had never heard of the "pain-compliance" practices and 
resultant charges of police brutality by Operation Rescue. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal and Greenfield said they try to give anti-abortion forces the same 
respect and attention they give abortion-rights advocates, but Greenfield 
conceded that, in general, "I can't say it would astonish me to learn there's a 
double standard in writing about them." 
</P>
<P>
Abortion opponents say the media's First Amendment "double standard" goes 
beyond their treatment of Operation Rescue and others who try to blockade 
abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
When Roman Catholic bishops individually spoke out on abortion or, 
collectively, hired a public relations firm to aid them in the battle against 
abortion, some in the media grumbled about the church's intrusion into the 
political arena. Similar media lamentations were forthcoming when bishops 
criticized (and raised the specter of ex-communication for) public officials 
who refuse to oppose abortion. But no such criticism was levied at the bishops 
in earlier years, when they endorsed a nuclear freeze or opposed Reagan 
Administration economic policies. In fact, newspapers generally praised 
religious leaders who actively participated in the civil rights movement in the 
1960s. 
</P>
<P>
It can be argued that the bishops' decision to hire a public relations firm to 
help in the battle against abortion is a secular step beyond anything clergymen 
did in the 1960s, but that step alone seems insufficient to justify a media 
turnabout like that noted by columnist Mark Shields. 
</P>
<P>
In 1962, Shields points out, a New York Times editorial expressed admiration 
for the "unwavering courage" of the archbishop of New Orleans when he 
excommunicated a Louisiana political boss and white supremacist who had 
"publicly opposed the archbishop's authority in desegregating diocesan 
schools." But in 1989, when Bishop Leo Maher publicly denied Communion to Lucy 
Killea for supporting abortion rights in her campaign for the California State 
Senate, a New York Times editorial accused him of threatening "the truce of 
tolerance by which Americans maintain civility and enlarge religious liberty." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal insists the two situations are not analogous, but others disagree. 
</P>
<P>
Media treatment of the bishops -- and of police and RICO actions against 
abortion protesters -- raise a "legitimate question," says reporter Barbara 
Brotman of the Chicago Tribune. Had organizations other than abortion opponents 
been involved, "I think there might have been more of an outcry," she says. 
</P>
<P>
But abortion opponents say the media often ignores -- or are very late in 
covering -- many issues and events that would receive thorough coverage if 
abortion-rights advocates or other liberal activists were involved. 
</P>
<P>
When the National Organization for Women had its annual convention in San 
Francisco last week, the Los Angeles Times sent a reporter to cover it and made 
it the lead story in today's View section. But when the National Right to Life 
Committee had its annual convention in Sacramento last month, not a word about 
it appeared in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Nor did The Times -- or most of the other major media -- pay much attention to 
the discovery by Bob Woodward of the Washington Post last year that two 
justices who had played a major role in the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision 
legalizing abortion had conceded, in private memos, that they knew they were 
"legislating policy and exceeding (the court's) authority as the interpreter, 
not the maker of law," as Woodward wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion opponents had long made this very criticism of the Roe decision, and 
they are convinced that if a reporter of Woodward's stature had discovered 
private memos showing, say, that justices knew they were "exceeding the court's 
authority" in last year's Webster decision, the media would have swarmed all 
over the story. But except for a brief mention in Newsweek three months later, 
no major national media seem to have picked up Woodward's story. 
</P>
<P>
Why not? 
</P>
<P>
"There are more people in the news media than not who agree with the (Roe) 
abortion decision and don't want to look at how the sausage was made," Woodward 
says.

STATE MAY SEIZE COUNTY'S ABUSED CHILDREN AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>

"... the Legislature finds and declares that it has no confidence in the 
ability of the current management of the Los Angeles Department of Children's 
Services to rectify the existing disastrous situation in the county or to 
ensure the safety of the abused and neglected children in its care." -- from 
the Supplemental Report of the state's 1990 Budget Act. 
</P>
<P>
When Robert L. Chaffee, director of the Los Angeles County Department of 
Children's Services, flew to Sacramento earlier this month to discuss a 
seemingly innocuous budget item with state Sen. Bill Greene, he had no idea his 
trip would trigger a bureaucratic tug-of-war for control of his agency. 
</P>
<P>
Chaffee feared the item would cut the county's funding, and he wanted Greene to 
strike it. Instead, the Democratic senator from Los Angeles launched a 
legislative inquiry into charges that Chaffee's department is in such disarray 
it can no longer protect the county's 50,000 abused and neglected children. 
</P>
<P>
And so, rather than fighting budget provisions, Chaffee is now fighting a war 
of independence. The state Department of Social Services has already forced the 
county to surrender its authority to license foster homes. Now, with the 
backing of the Legislature, it may seize control of the entire $457-million 
county child welfare services system. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute has once again put the spotlight on Los Angeles County's checkered 
history of caring for its most vulnerable citizens: children who have been 
beaten, burned, starved, raped, abandoned or otherwise physically and 
emotionally battered by their parents or others with whom they live. 
</P>
<P>
The state-county feud has been simmering for years. The Department of Social 
Services has spent nearly a decade complaining that Los Angeles County does not 
comply with state regulations. In fact, the county Department of Children's 
Services -- the first county agency in California devoted exclusively to 
children -- was established in 1984 as the county's answer to these complaints. 
</P>
<P>
The department's mission is to care for abused children and help reunite them 
with their families. From Chatsworth to Pomona, San Fernando to Long Beach, it 
supervises 3,800 foster homes, more than 200 group homes and a variety of 
emergency shelters. It offers drug and alcohol counseling for parents, 
treatment for young victims of sexual abuse, special medical services for 
seriously ill children, and also arranges adoptions. 
</P>
<P>
In a complex urban center like Los Angeles, in an era of drug babies and 
children with AIDS, this is no easy task. But six years after its inception, 
critics say the fledgling agency has done little, if anything, to address the 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not organized and it's not systematic and the more disorganized it is the 
more it becomes," said Carol Shauffer, an attorney with San Francisco's Youth 
Law Center, a public-interest law firm that represents children. "It's like a 
snowball." 
</P>
<P>
During the last year alone, the county has paid $18 million in legal awards and 
settlements to children who were either physically or sexually abused while in 
its care. In one case, a 6-year-old boy suffered black eyes, puncture wounds, 
and cigarette burns on his genitals before his foster parents allegedly tried 
to drown him. He is now a paraplegic. In another, two sisters, ages 3 and 7, 
contracted gonorrhea when their foster father molested them. 
</P>
<P>
The county is also embroiled in a class-action suit over its dismal record of 
providing children face-to-face visits with their social workers, which are 
required by the state to ensure a child's well-being. The judge in the 
so-called Timothy J. case has recently appointed an outside referee -- a child 
welfare expert from the University of Chicago -- to help bring the county into 
line with state rules regarding visits. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, the state seized 15 file cabinets full of county foster care 
records. State officials say the records show that the county repeatedly failed 
to take proper action against allegedly abusive foster parents and in some 
cases county workers continued to place children with such parents. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe it," said Greene, who chaired a recent public hearing on 
these issues. "I kept wondering, why are we just now finding out the level of 
severity of this problem? I'm not one that believes the state should run things 
because we are too far away. But Los Angeles County, at this point in time, 
should not run that program." 
</P>
<P>
Chaffee maintains that the state's complaints are overblown and if anyone is at 
fault it is the state for not providing his department with enough money. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to tell you that the system in Los Angeles County is not in 
chaos," he said. "These are normal conflicts and problems that anybody has 
running a program. This is hardly hanging offense stuff. In a large system like 
this, sure, you are going to have a few problems." 
</P>
<P>
His detractors say Chaffee's attitude -- that problems are to be expected -- is 
itself a major problem. In a recent letter to the Board of Supervisors, the 
county Commission for Children's Services, a 15-member advisory panel that 
oversees the department, suggested that "a major change in attitude and 
leadership" is necessary if the county is to keep local control of the 
department. "We need a change of management fast," said Commissioner Stacey 
Winkler. "We need a child-oriented leader. We need a lack of arrogance." The 
controversy has left the people who are served by the county department -- 
particularly the 10,000 foster children and their foster parents -- in a state 
of uncertainty. They wonder how they will be affected by state control of 
foster home licensing. Will the state impose restrictions that foster parents 
cannot meet? Will foster children, already victims of instability, be removed 
from one home and shuttled off to another? 
</P>
<P>
"We feel terrible," said Luz Silva, a Montebello foster parent. "Even the 
children are talking about it. They hear in the news, they see the newspapers, 
especially teen-agers, and they are losing confidence, you know, in the 
system." 
</P>
<P>
But state officials say the shake-up is necessary to prevent further harm to 
children like Marie, an 18-year-old who spent her childhood moving from one 
foster home to the next. Marie was molested by her foster father when she was 
11; she sued the county and will receive $750,000 to $1 million under a 
structured settlement, according to her lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Marie said in an interview this week that the sexual abuse was not her only 
problem with the system. When she was 17, she said, her foster mother suggested 
that she find her own apartment and she supported herself on a $5-an-hour 
salary. 
</P>
<P>
She should have been under foster care until she was 18 and was eligible for 
counseling and other benefits. But she did not even know the name of her social 
worker. The system, she said, lost track of her. As teams of state lawyers and 
foster care licensing investigators wade through county records, new 
allegations about cases like Marie's are continuing to unfold. Based on a 
sampling of 100 cases, state officials estimate that they may revoke the 
licenses of up to 400 county foster homes, including some that currently may 
not be operating. 
</P>
<P>
State officials say they already have confirmed at least two "politically 
sensitive" cases in which county investigators recommended revocation but were 
overturned by their superiors. Lawrence Bolton, assistant chief counsel for the 
state Department of Social Services, acknowledged that both cases involved 
physical and sexual abuse by foster parents who are leaders of local foster 
parent organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Chaffee would not discuss the cases, saying only that his department is 
conducting a simultaneous review and would take appropriate disciplinary action 
if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other county officials have questioned the state's motivation in the 
dispute. They have suggested that the Department of Social Services is trying 
to make a political splash -- perhaps because the state is also a defendant in 
the Timothy J. suit, perhaps to ensure that its top staff remains in place when 
a new governor takes office. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is an awful lot of politics going on," said Beth Lowe, vice 
chair of the Commission for Children's Services. 
</P>
<P>
The county also complains that the state is to blame for years of serious 
understaffing in the ranks of the county social workers. They note that the 
county was unable to fill 440 social worker positions until last year, when the 
state allocated an additional $11.3 million. The vacancies accounted for 
one-third of all caseworker positions. 
</P>
<P>
State funding is now based on the number of cases the county handles. Last 
year, with the county continuing to complain that it did not have enough money, 
state officials conducted a caseload audit. 
</P>
<P>
In sampling more than 4,000 cases, the state found that 14% should have counted 
as part of the caseload. Some cases were listed twice, and in other cases, 
children who live out of state were listed. 
</P>
<P>
Legislative analysts then wrote a provision in the 1990 budget that said state 
funding should be based on the state caseload figures, not the county's higher 
figures. That meant the county would receive less money -- and it prompted 
Chaffee's June 1 visit with Sen. Greene. 
</P>
<P>
But the visit backfired when Chaffee raised questions about the audit. 
</P>
<P>
A day later, legislative analysts briefed Greene on the state's long dispute 
with the county. Then the senator, outraged, ordered a public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Out of that daylong session came the Legislature's no-confidence declaration, 
as well as an order for the state to immediately revoke the county's licensing 
authority and to prepare to take over the entire system. 
</P>
<P>
The budget -- which still must be signed into law by Gov. George Deukmejian -- 
gives the county until Oct. 1 to present the state with a detailed plan for 
complying with state law. If state officials are not satisfied, they will move 
in. Meanwhile, the county Board of Supervisors has said it will fight to keep 
local control. 
</P>
<P>
There is division among child advocates over whether state control would 
actually improve county services, and everyone involved -- even state officials 
-- believes that local leadership is ultimately best. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is any way for the county to get its act together that is certainly 
preferable to us taking it over," said Loren Suter, deputy director of the 
state Department of Social Services. "The question is, are they going to do

OZONE ACCORD SPURS DRIVE ON GLOBAL HEATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For 10 days last month, delegates from nearly 100 nations labored on the banks 
of the River Thames across from Parliament to write a new chapter in 
environmental diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
They succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
Agreement was reached on unprecedented amendments to the Montreal Protocol 
binding the industrialized West and developing nations in a single global cause 
-- protection of the Earth's eroding ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
But even before the ink dried on the new accord, world leaders were looking 
ahead to a major international conference scheduled for 1992 in Brazil to 
fashion a broad framework treaty to address an even more daunting environmental 
threat -- global warming. 
</P>
<P>
"We have established here the model for the way in which we're going to have to 
carry out future environmental diplomacy . . . (to) save this small and fragile 
planet," declared Chris Patten, Britain's environmental secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Equally enthusiastic was Mostafa K. Tolba, who, as executive director of the 
U.N. Environment Program, shepherded the talks here to a successful conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
"We are starting a new era of not only cooperation but, really, partnership," 
Tolba said. "What we have been aspiring for has come true in a legally binding 
treaty." 
</P>
<P>
But that achievement, significant as it was, pales by comparison with the hard 
work that lies ahead in fashioning a treaty on global warming. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats caution that the world has not yet entered the era sought by 
environmental gadfly Jeremy Rifkin, who has called for a new politics that is 
"species-oriented instead of ideologically oriented." 
</P>
<P>
There is much to suggest that even though the world may be confronted by a 
common threat, its peoples may not pull together to meet that threat. 
</P>
<P>
Differences in how nations view environmental problems, and the unequal sharing 
of the costs and benefits of international accords, complicate environmental 
diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
Should a nation go along with efforts to allay the greenhouse effect if it 
knows that global warming might bring it more abundant harvests? Should poor 
nations struggling to raise their standards of living spend money to reduce 
ozone depletion so that fair-skinned Europeans don't get skin cancer? 
</P>
<P>
The theory of global warming holds that increased concentrations of carbon 
dioxide, produced mostly by the burning of fossil fuels, have produced a 
so-called greenhouse effect in which the Earth's surface traps more of the 
sun's rays, raising global temperatures. This will lead to such things as 
rising sea levels and the spread of disease, it is feared. 
</P>
<P>
While few participants in the London conference doubted the genuine concern 
over the Earth's deteriorating environment, success in strengthening the 
Montreal Protocol was possible largely because practical substitutes for 
ozone-destroying substances are near. 
</P>
<P>
There are comparatively few ozone-destroying substances. They include man-made 
coolants -- called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) -- used in air conditioning and 
refrigeration, as blowing agents in foam manufacturing and as solvents. 
</P>
<P>
Chemical manufacturers in the United States and Europe are well on their way to 
developing and marketing substitutes, known as HCFCs, that are only one-tenth 
as damaging to the ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
And while it is relatively simple to address a single issue such as ozone 
depletion, the agreement nearly came unraveled over the issue of how 
industrialized nations would transfer that technology to the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
The question: When does the need to protect the world's environment take 
precedence over private property rights -- in this case the right to protect 
patented HCFC technology? 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers say that after investing millions of dollars in research and 
development of patented HCFC alternatives, they do not want to give the results 
away to Third World nations and enable them to build plants and undercut sales. 
</P>
<P>
Developing nations say they are burdened by foreign debt and cannot forever be 
buying products from the West. They want to make the products themselves. If 
they cannot, they will not join in the fight to save the ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
It was a dilemma that India's environment minister, Maneka Gandhi, said is 
certain to dog future negotiations involving global warming. 
</P>
<P>
"Either you (sell us) the technology or you change your laws or you change your 
patent rights," she said. "Start working on it! This is a new century coming up 
in which every single conference which will take place is going to take place 
for survival." 
</P>
<P>
Gandhi referred to global warming and the new technologies that will be needed 
to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas. 
</P>
<P>
"In every case it will involve a transfer of knowledge," she said. "The whole 
21st Century's survival will be based on the (transfer) of knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
Negotiators settled on somewhat vague language that, at least for the moment, 
appeared to resolve the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
But the drafting of a global-warming treaty will present far greater obstacles, 
in part because the phenomenon, unlike ozone depletion, has no single cause. 
</P>
<P>
To turn down the temperature on global warming will get at the very heart of 
national economies. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest single contribution to global warming is carbon dioxide emissions, 
which come from the burning of fossil fuels like coal, gasoline and oil -- the 
energy of modern society and the fuels that the Third World counts on to raise 
standards of living. 
</P>
<P>
Will people drive less or use less energy to heat their homes? Will the Third 
World turn aside the demands of burgeoning populations for a higher living 
standard? 
</P>
<P>
William K. Reilly, chief of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and head 
of the American delegation, said that global warming will put environmental 
diplomacy to a severe test. 
</P>
<P>
"These are enormously complicated issues," Reilly said in an interview. "They 
have nuances that involve economic advantage for countries. . . . We're dealing 
here with very complex problems that involve the interrelations between 
economic development and environmental protection." 
</P>
<P>
The United States is attempting to draw the line when it comes to future 
international cooperation to arrest global warming. It rejects the suggestion 
by European governments that the ozone agreement has set a precedent for action 
on global threats like the greenhouse effect, deforestation and the extinction 
of species. 
</P>
<P>
What concerns Washington is any impression that its contribution to a 
$240-million ozone-restoration fund, earmarked to help Third World nations 
comply with strict new environmental controls, obliges the United States to 
make similar contributions to other funds that may be set up to reduce the 
so-called greenhouse effect. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to go back home and find that we have put a siphon into the U.S. 
Treasury," said one American. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, the United States placed four conditions on its participation. 
Ozone depletion met those four tests, including a finding that there is 
"conclusive scientific evidence" on what causes it and the threat it poses to 
the planet. That is not the case with global warming, in the U.S. view. 
</P>
<P>
Many also question whether addressing the greenhouse effect could meet two 
other tests established by the United States -- that the program and actions 
being financed must reasonably be expected to solve the problem, and that the 
funds needed "must be limited and reasonably predictable."

FIREFIGHTERS HOPE TO END BLAZE TODAY;

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As firefighters armed with shovels and water hoses Sunday battled the last hot 
spots of the devastating wildfire that they expect to extinguish today, 
authorities announced they had cited about 25 people for rifling through the 
ashes of homes for valuables. 
</P>
<P>
"People are sifting through the ruins of other people's houses," said 
California Highway Patrol Sgt. Dave Kissinger at a roadblock in one 
neighborhood that was heavily damaged by the fire. "It's totally sick." 
</P>
<P>
Those cited were charged with "sightseeing at the scene of an emergency," a 
misdemeanor, after they were caught combing through the rubble in burned-out 
neighborhoods, said Tim Gracey, spokesman for the Santa Barbara County 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
CHP officers maintained roadblocks at streets leading into some neighborhoods 
and allowed in only those who could prove they lived there. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara County Sheriff Jim Thomas said there were no documented cases of 
looting, a more serious charge. But one fire victim said it was clear that 
someone had searched through the ashes of his home, moved a filing cabinet and 
opened the drawers. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing anyone could find in there," said John Warkentin, pointing to 
his demolished house, "but it's irritating to think someone was trying." 
</P>
<P>
As firefighters worked to clear out the final hot spots of the wildfire, 
officials estimated the damage at about $500 million. Estimates have varied as 
official inspections were completed. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 firefighters -- down from a peak of 1,800 -- remained Sunday, and 
officials say they expect the number to drop to a crew of about 100 today. 
</P>
<P>
"They're checking tree stumps, roots and piles of leaves, making sure nothing 
is smoldering," said U.S. Forest Service spokesman Maeton Freel. "We don't want 
to run the risk of anything flaring up again." 
</P>
<P>
The ground crews were aided by helicopters equipped with infra-red video 
cameras, designed to find burning embers in the brush and in charred houses. 
Once the smoldering areas were found, ground crews and helicopters dumped water 
and fire retardant on the embers. 
</P>
<P>
In other areas of the city, residents whose homes escaped the flames that 
scorched thousands of acres worked together to trim back trees and clear shrubs 
to be better prepared for the next wave of fire. Fire officials said Santa 
Barbara is particularly vulnerable during the remainder of the summer because 
the region has been plagued by a severe drought. 
</P>
<P>
"The scary part is, this is just the beginning," said Charles Johnson, a 
spokesman for the Santa Barbara County Fire Department. "We still have the 
whole summer to go." 
</P>
<P>
In one neighborhood hard hit by the fire, U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson and county 
officials staged a press conference Sunday afternoon after touring the stricken 
region by helicopter and on foot. 
</P>
<P>
"It is almost an unprecedented disaster in terms of the speed and the magnitude 
of the fire," said Wilson, the Republican nominee for governor. "It traveled 
3.8 miles in an hour and 20 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said Santa Barbara residents will be able to apply for federal disaster 
relief on Tuesday, when the Federal Emergency Management Agency opens a 
temporary headquarters in the area. 
</P>
<P>
An inter-agency task force headed by officials from city and county fire 
departments and the U.S. Forest Service has been formed to investigate the 
fire, caused when an arsonist used an incendiary device on the bone-dry brush. 
A $120,000 reward, raised from donations by local residents and businesses, has 
been offered for information leading to the arrest of the arsonist. 
</P>
<P>
On San Marcos Pass Road, where traffic was permitted for the first time since 
the fire began Wednesday, scores of sightseers on Sunday parked by the side of 
the road to gaze at the huge expanse of charred brush and firefighters at work. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the whole thing is incredible -- that an arsonist could do so much 
damage," said Irv Bromberg, a tourist from Coral Springs, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Bromberg and his wife, Wendy, standing near where the fire was set, watched as 
helicopters carrying huge buckets of fire retardant flew over and dumped their 
loads on smoking embers on a nearby hillside. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, the fire was contained, which means a fire line around the 
blaze was completed. The fire was expected to be under control by this morning. 
That means there are no flames within 300 feet of the fire lines. And, because 
of the coastal fog, cool temperatures and absence of winds, the fire is 
expected to be extinguished later today, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But in the aftermath of this fire, residents will eventually be confronted by a 
new danger -- mudslides. During the next week, a U.S. Forest Service team of 
geologists, soil scientists and other experts, along with officials from the 
county Flood Control Agency, will map the burn area, looking for potential 
mudslide sites. Before winter, the Forest Service will build small dams at the 
base of some denuded hills and block off some fire-ravaged ravines to prevent 
flooding during the next heavy rains. 
</P>
<P>
"The area that was burned was steep, close to populated areas and there were 
about three creeks that drain right through the cities. This makes it a prime 
area for mudslides," Freel said. "That's our next concern." 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego County, gusting winds on Sunday prolonged the life of another 
arson fire burning for the last five days near Lake Henshaw. The fire had been 
listed as contained Sunday morning until winds increased, preventing full 
containment for another 24 hours. The final damage toll is expected to be 4,350 
acres and $291,000. The fire destroyed two homes. Ten firefighters suffered 
minor injuries. Halting the flames' advance required more than 1,800 
firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
During last week's savage heat wave, brush fires -- most of them arson -- 
scorched thousands of acres in areas of Southern California, including 
Glendale, Chino Hills, Corona and Hemet.

THE TEEMING WATERS OFF MONTEREY AT LAST MAY BECOME A SANCTUARY

<P>
A hundred yards off Lover's Point Park, a trio of sea otters glided through 
thick clumps of pea-green kelp like slalom skiers breezing downhill. 
</P>
<P>
They slipped past two scuba divers in the 15-foot-deep water, seemingly 
unconcerned about predators, pollution and other dangers serious enough to have 
landed them on the federal threatened species list. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists and marine researchers, however, worry plenty about sea 
otters and countless other species of marine mammals, fish and underwater 
plants that make their home in the Monterey Bay's chilly, deep waters. This 
week, local scientists, politicians and activists expressed relief after 
President George Bush announced that he supports a plan to designate the area a 
national marine sanctuary, protecting a 2,200-square-mile stretch of sea from 
just north of Ano Nuevo to south of Big Sur. 
</P>
<P>
It is the only area earmarked for permanent protections in Bush's oil-lease 
policy, which included a 10-year drilling ban along 99% of the California 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
"The Monterey Bay, running from Santa Cruz to the Big Sur coast, is without 
question a national treasure, and it should be preserved as one," said Rep. 
Leon Panetta (D-Monterey), likening the bay's underwater community to national 
parks such as Yellowstone and Yosemite. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this designation will do that," said Panetta, who in 1986 proposed 
that Congress name the bay a national marine sanctuary. Federal environmental 
officials first suggested the move in 1978, but five years later Monterey Bay 
was pulled off the list of proposed sanctuaries. 
</P>
<P>
Congress approved the designation for Monterey Bay in 1988, and the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration drew up plans for final approval several 
months ago. Because the sanctuary plan would permanently ban oil drilling in 
the bay, the U.S. Energy and Interior departments objected to the proposal. So 
the Monterey Bay sanctuary plan remained blocked until Bush on Tuesday formally 
approved it as a part of his overall oil lease plan. 
</P>
<P>
However, the 12-year battle for comprehensive protection of the bay is expected 
to continue in public hearings this fall, when proponents of an expanded 
sanctuary area will argue that full protection of the Monterey Bay won't be 
possible without stretching the boundary north to the edge of the Gulf of the 
Fallones sanctuary off San Francisco, and south another 50 miles beyond Big 
Sur. Some, including a coalition of environmental groups called the Monterey 
Bay Sanctuary Environmental Working Group, favor protecting an area 50% larger 
than the proposed sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
"The main reason we want to see the largest boundary possible is to have a 
buffer zone," said Susan Shane, scientific director of the Monterey-based 
Friends of the Sea Otter. "You can't have national parks and have condos right 
at the boundaries." 
</P>
<P>
After the hearings, Congress will review the final version of the proposal 
before sending a sanctuary manager to work in the area. That review probably 
won't begin before late November, Panetta said. 
</P>
<P>
The largest submarine canyon in North America slices through Monterey Bay, 
which as outlined would be larger than any of the nation's eight existing 
sanctuaries. Cold water wells up from the mile-deep Monterey Canyon, carrying 
nutrient-rich deep water into shallow areas, providing an abundance of food 
that helps keep the area teeming with salmon, seals, whales and the most 
diverse collection of algae found in North America. It is also home to a number 
of California's estimated 1,800 sea otters, which are on the rebound after 
being hunted to near extinction by the 1950s. Monterey Bay is the largest 
breeding ground for marine mammals in the lower 48 states. 
</P>
<P>
Monterey Bay is a deep-water environment brought unusually close to shore 
because of the happy coincidence of the canyon's location. It provides 
scientists an unusual opportunity to study relatively unknown marine 
communities far beneath the surface. A number of research institutions operate 
on Monterey Bay, including the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, 
Stanford University's Hopkins Marine Station and the Moss Landing Marine Lab. 
</P>
<P>
The area also is home to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, which attracts an average 
1.7 million visitors each year. The facility features exhibits on the Monterey 
Bay marine community and showcases a rotating exhibit on other types of marine 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of a handful of very, very rich areas," said Alan Baldridge, 
librarian and assistant to the director at Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific 
Grove. "It's a rich area both for the scientists and for the fishermen." 
</P>
<P>
The same waters once fed schools of sardines that kept Cannery Row, made famous 
by the John Steinbeck novel, booming through the first half of the century. 
</P>
<P>
"Back in the heyday of Cannery Row, we had something in the vicinity of 20 or 
30 canneries, but now there's just one working cannery in the area," said Bob 
Leos, a marine biologist for the state Department of Fish and Game. "The 
sardine industry was a major boost to the local economy. They more or less got 
things going around here." 
</P>
<P>
Although sardines were nearly depleted by the 1960s, other catches have kept 
the Monterey Bay fishing industry alive. 
</P>
<P>
More than one-sixth of the state's $13.3-million salmon harvest in 1989 came 
from Monterey Bay's three ports -- Santa Cruz, Moss Landing and Monterey -- 
according to preliminary statistics by the state Department of Fish and Game. 
Fishermen in the area also hauled in about $1.5 million worth of squid, $1.5 
million of swordfish, and $1.8 million of rockfish. 
</P>
<P>
Fishermen hope the marine sanctuary designation will keep alive for years to 
come the fisheries they depend on for their livelihood. 
</P>
<P>
"This is very important for a lot of people," first mate Don Elkins said as he 
stood on the deck of the Vast, a 36-foot salmon boat moored in Monterey Harbor. 
"So long as the fish are protected, so are we." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MONTEREY BAY CHRONOLOGY 
</P>
<P>
A chronology of events in the campaign to designate Monterey Bay a National 
Marine Sanctuary: 
</P>
<P>
1972: Congress establishes National Marine Sanctuary program. 
</P>
<P>
October, 1979: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announces that 
Monterey Bay is an active candidate for the program. 
</P>
<P>
December, 1983: Citing budgetary reasons, NOAA removes Monterey Bay from its 
list of sanctuary hopefuls. 
</P>
<P>
November, 1986: Rep. Leon Panetta (D-Monterey) introduces legislation to name 
Monterey Bay a National Marine Sanctuary, but Congress adjourns before 
discussing the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
January, 1987: Panetta reintroduces the plan. 
</P>
<P>
November, 1988: Congress approves legislation giving Monterey Bay sanctuary 
status, subject to the approval of federal agencies, who have until December, 
1989 to sign off. 
</P>
<P>
January, 1990: Federal officials miss the deadline for establishing the 
sanctuary. 
</P>

June 26, 1990: President George Bush announces a 10-year ban on oil drilling 
along 99% of the California coast. In doing so, he also approves a 
2,200-square-mile National Marine Sanctuary at Monterey Bay. If the plan is 
approved by Congress after public hearings this fall, it would be the fourth 
such sanctuary on the California coast.

CONFERENCE: ACT UP DRAWS FIRE AND PRAISE AFTER ACTIVISTS SHOUTED DOWN A CABINET 
OFFICIAL IN SAN FRANCISCO.

<P>
For many, the final moment of the Sixth International Conference on AIDS here 
provided an outrageous sight: The conference's last speaker, Secretary of 
Health and Human Services Louis Sullivan, stepped to the microphone and was 
drowned out by protesters shouting "Shame! Shame! Shame!" and blowing whistles 
and air horns. 
</P>
<P>
When the din ended, the debate erupted: Had the protesters, members of ACT UP, 
the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, gone too far by infringing upon Sullivan's 
right to speak and be heard? Or had they simply done what was necessary to call 
attention to and confront an inadequate government response to a disease that 
is killing one U.S. citizen every 12 minutes and shows no signs of abating? 
</P>
<P>
Would the disruption alienate supporters of more funding for AIDS research and 
care, already the target of a backlash? 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan lost no time in calling the protesters "un-American," adding in an 
interview with the San Francisco Examiner and Chronicle: "I will not in any way 
work with those individuals." 
</P>
<P>
"ACT UP couldn't resist shouting down Sullivan, turning a faceless bureaucrat 
into a martyr," said David Kirp, professor of public policy at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
"It was undoubtedly an act of personal integrity and authenticity, and I am 
sure that it made them feel better," Kirp added. "But sometimes, personal 
authenticity and political effectiveness are incompatible." 
</P>
<P>
Even within the homosexual community, grieving and angry over the epidemic's 
mounting toll, there was criticism of ACT UP, which has emerged as the nation's 
dominant AIDS activist organization. "The protesters were wrong in their 
strategy," said Steve Morin, an openly gay aide to Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San 
Francisco). "It is a First Amendment issue, to let people speak and be heard. 
</P>
<P>
"But the Administration was wrong as well," Morin added. "The message President 
Bush sent to the conference was: 'I am not going to exert any leadership to be 
with you during this time of national crisis. Instead, I am going to go to 
North Carolina to campaign for Sen. Jesse Helms (R.-N.C.) and to call him a 
'man of vision.' " 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who declined an invitation to address the conference, appeared at a Helms 
fund-raiser in Charlotte on the day the conference opened. Gays and many 
scientists and public health experts consider Helms the U.S. Senate's biggest 
obstruction toward the enactment of sound AIDS policies. 
</P>
<P>
It was Helms who led the fight against the type of explicit AIDS prevention 
materials that public health experts believe are necessary to stem transmission 
of the virus; it was also Helms who authored U.S. travel restrictions on 
foreigners infected with the AIDS virus that led to a boycott of the 
conference. Bush's embrace of Helms, said Morin, "was insensitive at best and, 
more likely, inflammatory." 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the tension, the Bush Administration formally announced on the eve of 
the conference its opposition to the federal AIDS disaster-relief bill. The 
bill, which sailed through both houses of Congress, would provide funds to 
cities whose public health structures are sagging under the weight of the 
epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, many who are fighting their own personal battles against AIDS 
thought the eruption against the Administration's highest-ranking official at 
the conference was right on target. "He talks, we die," read the banner 
unfurled by the protesters as the noise-making began. 
</P>
<P>
"To have ended this conference with everybody arm in arm, grinning, would have 
misrepresented the direness of the situation," said Los Angeles writer Paul 
Monette, who chronicled the death of his lover, Roger Horwitz, in his book 
"Borrowed Time." 
</P>
<P>
"We who are in the trenches know that the nightmare is absolutely continuing," 
said Monette, who is also infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. "This 
is not a time for good manners." 
</P>
<P>
"People are offended? Well, let them join the club," added David Barr, a lawyer 
and member of ACT UP/New York. "I'm offended that there are 99 drugs that 
should be in clinical trials now but aren't, that there are thousands of 
homeless people with AIDS in New York, that 37 million Americans live without 
health insurance." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Cloutier, executive director of the National Public Health Project on 
AIDS, said critics of ACT UP misunderstand its role: "ACT UP wouldn't be doing 
its job if it didn't stir things up. As long as they are not violent, they 
provide a steam valve for an incredibly volatile situation." 
</P>
<P>
Since ACT UP was founded three years ago, the group's white-hot rage has drawn 
more attention than more polite forms of AIDS activism, such as the Names 
Project's AIDS Memorial Quilt. ACT UP boasts 50 chapters and thousands of 
members and is best known in Los Angeles for its frequent attacks on the county 
Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"You can think of the quilt as Martin Luther King and ACT UP as Malcolm X," 
said Thomas Watson, a Harvard student who is spending his senior year analyzing 
the divergent strains of AIDS activism. 
</P>
<P>
Other less visible forms of activism include the quiet lobbying done by such 
organizations as Project Inform, which seeks greater access to experimental 
drugs, and the AIDS Action Council. 
</P>
<P>
The conventional wisdom in AIDS circles is that ACT UP strengthens the hand of 
the moderates by making them seem reasonable in contrast. Said Cloutier: "I 
feel enormously energized working within the system, knowing that ACT UP is 
there. By what they do, they are a constant reminder that settling for 
compromises are not going to solve this epidemic." 
</P>
<P>
UC Berkeley Professor William Kornhauser, an authority on social protest 
movements, sees parallels between the rise of ACT UP and the anti-war movement 
of the 1960s. Like the anti-war movement, he said, ACT UP's rise is "driven by 
a sense of frustration, one of anger, one of futility." 
</P>
<P>
"But there is one great difference. By the late '60s, the American people had 
turned against the Vietnam War. I think America is still rather apathetic when 
it comes to AIDS," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Because gays and the minority group members typically stricken with AIDS in the 
United States "are marginalized and invisible, I can see why ACT UP feels the 
need to take drastic measures -- even ones that seem rude and 
counterproductive." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel AIDS activists are going to lose support from our 'many 
supporters,' " said Monette. "We don't have 'many supporters.' What's out there 
is vast, vast apathy." 
</P>
<P>
ACT UP is more than the street theater and demonstrations staged for television 
cameras. 
</P>
<P>
The group's tightly reasoned critiques of clinical drug trials, produced by a 
band of amateur scientists, helped spur the National Institutes of Health to 
create expanded access programs for such experimental drugs as DDI and DDC. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, ACT UP's protest in the AIDS conference's final moments overshadowed 
an unusual harmony that had prevailed between scientists, public health 
officials and AIDS activists attending the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Flanked by ACT UP member Peter Staley and National Institutes of Health AIDS 
research chief Dr. Anthony Fauci, speaker after speaker paid homage to the 
activists' contributions in confronting the epidemic and invoked the need for a 
partnership among activists, scientists and public health officials. 
</P>
<P>
"When it comes to clinical trials, some of them are better informed than many 
scientists can imagine," Fauci said in his speech to the conference. 
Scientists, Fauci added, "do not have a lock on correctness. Activists bring a 
special insight into the disease that can actually be helpful in the way we 
design out scientific approaches." 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing will make us go back on (the partnership)," said Dr. Paul Volberding, 
chief of AIDS activities at San Francisco General Hospital and a conference 
co-chair. 
</P>
<P>
However the debate is resolved, there seems to be no question that the kind of 
activism symbolized by ACT UP is not fading. 
</P>
<P>
ACT UP's best-known slogan used to be: "Silence Equals Death." Now, it has 
added a new one, aimed especially at public officials hoping for a respite from 
criticism: "Until there's a cure, there's ACT UP."

MIDGET MICE CREATED IN STUDY OF HORMONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new strain of midget mice that are only half normal size has been developed 
by Ohio University researchers who accomplished the feat by modifying the gene 
for a growth hormone and inserting it into the animals, the scientists report 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers say the technique should work for any animal, so it should be 
possible to develop small rodents, pigs and other laboratory animals that would 
require less space and food. 
</P>
<P>
The new discovery may also lead to the development of smaller farm animals that 
would use food more efficiently, and perhaps even to the development of new 
drug treatments for human gigantism. 
</P>
<P>
The Ohio research also represents "an important step" in understanding the 
mechanisms by which cells are stimulated to grow, according to reproductive 
biologist Neal L. First of the University of Wisconsin. "This is one piece in a 
whole puzzle that is going to allow us to understand the growth hormone 
exactly," First said. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio molecular biologists John J. Kopchick and Wen Y. Chen were not trying to 
make small mice, Kopchick said in an interview. Instead, they were trying to 
produce unusually large mice. 
</P>
<P>
They were building on work conducted in the early 1980s by researchers such as 
Ralph Brinster of the University of Pennsylvania and Richard Palmiter of the 
University of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Brinster and Palmiter found that they could produce mice that were twice normal 
size by using genetic engineering techniques to insert a growth hormone from 
cows, called bovine growth hormone or bGH, into the genes of mice. The extra 
growth hormone produced by the mice stimulated their growth. 
</P>
<P>
Kopchick and Chen hoped to make the mice grow even bigger by making three small 
changes in the structure of bGH before inserting it into mouse embryos. They 
thought the changes might make it a more powerful growth stimulant. 
</P>
<P>
"Surprisingly, instead of enhancing growth rate, these mutations suppressed the 
growth rate of the mouse," Kopchick said. "They are normal in every way except 
size," he said. The researchers now have "over a dozen" different "founder" 
mice, produced independently, that have been progenitors of strains of midget 
mice. Some of the strains are now in the third generation. 
</P>
<P>
The "most exciting scientific aspect" of the research, Kopchick said, is the 
light it sheds on the growth process. Growth hormones normally bind to specific 
sites on the surface of cells, called receptors, thereby stimulating a chemical 
reaction within the cell that leads to growth. 
</P>
<P>
The altered bGH produced by Kopchick and Chen also binds to that receptor. 
Surprisingly, however, it does not stimulate growth; it simply sits in the 
receptor. Because the altered bGH is occupying the receptors, normal mouse 
growth hormone cannot bind and stimulate growth, so that mouse growth is 
impaired. 
</P>
<P>
By allowing researchers to separate the two functions of binding to cells and 
stimulating growth, the altered hormone thus provides a valuable tool to 
explore the actual chemical changes within the cell that lead to growth. 
</P>
<P>
The Ohio researchers have not yet tried the altered hormone with any other 
animals, but "I am confident it will work in all mammals," Kopchick said. 
</P>
<P>
The work is published in today's edition of the Proceedings of the National 
Academy of Sciences.

Employees at Kaiser Permanente represented by Office and Professional Employees 
International Union Local 30 voted overwhelmingly over the weekend to ratify a 
three-year contract that calls for wage increases ranging from 11% to 16% over 
the next three years. Local 30 members voted on the pact after management and 
union negotiators reached agreement. Just over 90% of the votes cast were in 
favor of the contract.

A Southern California pilot escaped serious injury when his small plane crashed 
about a mile short of the runway at Las Vegas' McCarran International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The plane skidded across vacant lots and halted about 20 feet from a concrete 
wall. Authorities said the pilot, Donald Morrill, 57, of Highland, near San 
Bernardino, radioed the tower that he was running low on fuel. He was 
hospitalized in stable condition with face and ankle injuries. The plane was 
flying from Utah to California.

BUTTE COUNTY LOSES BID ON WELFARE COSTS

<TEXT>
<P>
The state Supreme Court has refused to order the state government to pay Butte 
County's share of welfare costs, prompting a lawyer for the county to warn that 
radical measures may be needed to stave off bankruptcy. "Proposition 13 is 
about to result in the death of the first county," attorney Ephraim Margolin 
said after the Supreme Court's action. 
</P>
<P>
The court unanimously denied a hearing on Butte County's appeal of a 
lower-court ruling that the county's current financial plight did not excuse it 
from paying 5.4% of Aid to Families with Dependent Children costs -- the share 
counties must pay under state law. The county says it was particularly hard hit 
by Proposition 13 because its property tax base was the lowest in the state 
when the 1978 measure rolled back and froze tax rates and assessments. Butte 
County supervisors must pass a balanced budget for 1990-91 by Aug. 31.

Andrea Seastrand, widow of Assemblyman Eric Seastrand of Salinas, announced she 
will run for her husband's seat. Eric Seastrand, 52, an assembly member since 
December, 1982, died June 20 of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
His district includes portions of Monterey, San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara 
counties. "My children are in college now, and I have reached that point in my 
life where I can devote my undivided attention to serving in the tradition of 
my late husband," said Andrea Seastrand, 49. The GOP central committees in the 
three counties must meet to select a replacement for the November ballot by 
Aug. 30. Only one other Republican has expressed interest, Steve MacElvainy, a 
member of the state Coastal Commission. Since the district leans Republican by 
a 48% to 40% margin, the chosen candidate has a leg up in the race.

Mandela, the Miniseries: Mandela fever seems to have infected even TV network 
execs. 
</P>
<P>
ABC Entertainment President Bob Iger, one of the Hollywood leaders who attended 
the star-studded fund-raiser for Nelson Mandela and the African National 
Congress Friday night, announced that he has green-lighted a four-hour 
miniseries about the history of the anti-apartheid movement. The miniseries 
would be produced by Jon Avnet and Jordan Kerner. According to Iger, it 
probably won't be seen during the 1991-92 TV season. But Avnet says he's aiming 
for a broadcast as soon as next May. The script by Carol Schreder ("The Burning 
Bed," "A Call to Glory") spans 30 years, and will conclude with Mandela's 
release from prison earlier this year. GREG BRAXTON

The Heart of Rock 'n' Roll: Grammy winner Bonnie Raitt, who performed at the 
freedom rally honoring Nelson Mandela in Oakland Saturday, said Mandela told 
her that he credits the Wembley rock concert tribute to him two years ago with 
focusing attention worldwide on the anti-apartheid struggle. She said Mandela 
was especially pleased by the number of young people who were politicized about 
the issue, thanks to the concert. Raitt, who talked with Mandela at the African 
National Congress fund-raiser Friday night, said that's why Mandela made a 
special point of thanking musicians at this year's Wembley concert. GREG

Apparent Suicide Leads to Talk Show Host's Firing: A New Orleans radio talk 
show host, whose wife apparently killed herself just hours after calling his 
show to complain about their marital problems, has been fired. Ron Hunter, 51, 
said: "I was expecting the sympathy of my management and my listeners. 
</P>
<P>
And what I ended up with was being fired . . . eight days after the death of my 
wife." Hunter's wife, Marilou, called his show a little more than a week ago 
and told a guest marriage counselor that they had a troubled marriage. Hours 
later, she was found shot to death in bed, next to Hunter. Authorities say she 
apparently committed suicide. Station officials said Hunter's dismissal had 
been in the works for several weeks, but the final blow was the way he handled 
the call from his wife -- specifically his decision not to cut her off the air 
as soon as he recognized her voice. GREG BRAXTON

BOUNTIFUL 'AS YOU LIKE IT' OPENS OLD GLOBE SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Old Globe Theatre began its summer season with an end-of-summer staging of 
"As You Like It." 
</P>
<P>
Set in the alfresco Lowell Davies Festival Theatre, this "As You Like It" is 
bountiful, well-spoken and without major surprises -- unless it's the fact that 
the production's overriding melancholy is underplayed in the one character, 
Jaques, where it's most needed. 
</P>
<P>
The hints of incipient autumn are established by David Jenkins' set. In the 
first scene, the apples have been harvested and are being pressed into cider. 
The leaves are beginning to fall from the trees in the Forest of Arden. And 
then there is the matter of the deer. 
</P>
<P>
Director Julianne Boyd and Jenkins were not content to simply let us hear 
Shakespeare's lines about Jaques' grief over a hunter's wounding of a deer in 
the forest. In one of the first scenes, before we even enter the forest, 
Rosalind and Celia play badminton against the backdrop of a formal garden that 
includes a bush sculpted in the form of a stag. 
</P>
<P>
As we near the end of the play, the banished duke's merry men not only sing a 
bawdy little ditty in honor of the fellow who killed the deer, but they 
actually bear the creature's headless corpse across the stage. The triumphant 
young hunter smears his hands and face with the deer's blood. After the merry 
men go on their way, leaving the deer on stage, Jaques comes forward and 
touches the animal's neck in a moment of silent sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
This scene effectively ends the notion of the forest as the halcyon retreat 
that it might resemble in the spring. Instead, this is a bloody place, where 
the food chain continues operating, where even those men who claim to love 
nature don't hesitate to exert their dominion over it. In this world, the faux 
deer (as sculpted in the garden) threatens to outlive the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
Jaques more or less articulates this point of view throughout the play. But 
this production's Jaques, Richard Kneeland, isn't the right man to embody it. 
Kneeland speaks Jaques' lines, including those about the seven ages of man, 
with grace and precision, but he doesn't look particularly glum. His eyes don't 
appear haunted. He carries himself with a bearing not much different from his 
stout-hearted comrades. 
</P>
<P>
It's a curious lapse in an otherwise well-cast staging. The magnificently 
wall-eyed Richard Easton is a superb Touchstone, suggesting the professional 
fool's wit, his hauteur, his carnality. Robert Phalen plays both the bad duke 
and his brother, the banished good duke, with conviction. The physical 
resemblance between the dukes may help us swallow the bad duke's sudden 
offstage conversion at the end of the play; they were cut of the same cloth, 
right? Well. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Any "As You Like It" hinges on its Rosalind, and Jayne Atkinson is spirited 
enough to carry off the disguise as a man -- observe the gymnastic workout she 
and Michel R. Gill's Orlando go through during her speech about the volatile 
moods of married women -- yet she is also feminine enough to make us see the 
studied aspect of her disguise. More important, in her private moments, we 
believe both her cynicism and her lovesickness. We see the anxiety behind her 
little charade: Will Orlando like her as she is? Will she like him? Will the 
real romance work out, or even be as much fun, as the fake one? With Gill's 
Orlando, this is an open question. He's perfectly handsome -- too perfect, 
perhaps, for this Rosalind. There are no character lines on his face. He looks 
several years younger and several dimensions shallower than Atkinson's 
Rosalind. 
</P>
<P>
As Celia, Katherine Leask elicits many of the play's chuckles, not only with 
her insinuating glances and artificial smiles during Rosalind's byplay with 
Orlando, but even with the simple statement that she's too tired to keep 
walking. The performances in the pastoral roles are also little comic gems: 
especially Pippa Pearthree as Phebe, Charley Lang as Silvius and M. Susan Peck 
as Audrey. Ed Hall's Corin retains a degree of dignity in the face of the 
supercilious Touchstone; Jonathan McMurtry is the noble old Adam. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Nichols fares as well as can be expected as the villainous brother who 
so thoroughly reforms. For his interrogation by the bad duke, the stage opens 
up and he's escorted to and from his dungeon in a glare of light and a wave of 
smoke. In a punitive environment like this, his knavery isn't hard to 
understand. The program sets the play in the 1630s, possibly suggesting 
Cromwellian repression to come. 
</P>
<P>
The play's other Oliver, an itinerant parson played by Nicholas Martin, gets 
more than his share of laughs with the assistance of a clever prop, and 
Martin's lisping LeBeau gets his with the aid of an outlandish outfit devised 
by Robert Wojewodski. 
</P>
<P>
The costumes are lush, Conrad Susa's score is tuneful, and Peter Maradudin's 
lights finally illuminate the forest behind the stage. In other words, this is 
"As You Like It" as most of us like it -- but the image of that unfortunate 
deer will linger, bringing us back down to earth.

OPTIMISTIC WARWICK, FRIENDS IN AIDS SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Even the specter of the suffering and despair surrounding AIDS didn't dampen 
the "That's What Friends Are For" benefit concert Saturday night at the 
Universal Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
The predominant mood at the third annual event was one of unfailing optimism as 
most of the all-star lineup -- which included Dionne Warwick, Stevie Wonder, 
and Quincy Jones -- chose to celebrate life and to concentrate on the progress 
being made against the disease. 
</P>
<P>
"I know, just as sure as Mandela is free, that we will one day find the cure," 
Wonder said during his brief, three-song set near the end of the 4 1/2-hour 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The slickly produced concert -- which was broadcast live on closed-circuit 
television to locations in five other cities -- was even injected with some 
AIDS humor. 
</P>
<P>
Comedian Byron Allen said, "Now that we have AIDS, couples work it out. Before, 
you could get dumped for any reason. Before, it was, 'Baby, I don't like that 
shirt. We're through.' Now it's, 'Baby, I know you pulled a knife on me, but we 
have something special. Now put that gun down and let's show the SWAT team we 
love each other.' " 
</P>
<P>
Despite the show's generally jubilant mood, some of the performers reflected 
somberly backstage about friends and associates who had died of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a number of friends whom I have lost to AIDS," said Melissa Manchester, 
who drew one of the evening's loudest responses for her rendition of "Somewhere 
Over the Rainbow." 
</P>
<P>
The singer said it was not always easy being an entertainer at benefits that 
are overshadowed by disease and death. "It's very hard, but we have no choice." 
she said. "The fear that surrounds the disease is uncanny, but so is the 
enormous denial surrounding it. We've got to go on talking about it until we're 
booed off the stage." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles rapper Ice-T said that he did not know anyone who has the virus but 
that he was grateful to participate in the benefit and that rap musicians have 
generally been excluded from similar events because of rap's hard-core, urban 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be involved," he said backstage. "I have a tough audience. . . . 
They think they can't get AIDS. I need to let them know it can happen to them. 
Entertainers have a responsibility to do that. And we can reach a different 
audience than Dionne's audience." 
</P>
<P>
Warwick, who coordinates the annual benefits, was hailed by the performers as 
an inspiration in the AIDS struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Since organizing the recording of "That's What Friends Are For," the 1988 hit 
featuring Warwick, Wonder, Gladys Knight and Elton John that raised nearly $2 
million for AIDS research, Warwick has been in the forefront of entertainers 
fighting the disease. (There was no estimate Saturday of how much was raised by 
the Amphitheatre concert and the dinners held in other cities.) 
</P>
<P>
"There is no problem at all getting commitments from entertainers who care and 
who have lost friendships," Warwick said in an interview. "Seeing the demise of 
so many people is getting to be too much. There's too much death. It's touched 
the lives of everyone in the industry." 
</P>
<P>
She said that she was trying to remain hopeful about the battle against AIDS 
but that it wasn't always easy. "This is as bleak as cancer was in the 
beginning," Warwick said. "The message we want to drive home is that there is 
only one alternative: death." 
</P>
<P>
However, Warwick said she was not overwhelmed by the challenges involved: "This 
has not consumed me. . . . I still sing for a living. That is my profession. I 
am not a politician. I am a concerned human being who wants the best possible 
health care for me and my family." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's audience of about 5,000 paid from $15 to $1,000 a ticket to see a 
potpourri of musical styles, ranging from Air Supply's easygoing vocals to the 
stark, aggressive rap of Ice-T and Def Jef, who performed their new 
anti-violence song, "We're All in the Same Gang," while prompting the formally 
attired audience to pump fists in the air. 
</P>
<P>
Sprinkled in between was moving gospel by Tremaine Hawkins, energetic dance-pop 
by Latin sensation Chayanne and harmonic stylings by Manhattan Transfer. 
</P>
<P>
Among the emotional high points of Saturday's concert: Warwick's duets with 
Isaac Hayes on "Deja Vu" and with Wonder on "It's You." Wonder's brief set, 
which included "Dark n' Lovely" and his "I Just Called to Say I Love You," 
received the biggest ovation. 
</P>
<P>
Although he did not know anyone who had died of AIDS, Wonder said backstage 
that he felt compelled to participate in the benefit. "We are all touched by 
hearing of any death by the virus," he said. "That's why we're here."

NEA PANEL ASKS TO MEET AFTER GRANT DENIALS; 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: REVIEW BOARD WANTS TO DISCUSS ALLOCATION OF $23,000 AFTER CHAIRMAN 
JOHN E. FROHNMAYER OVERTURNED AWARDS TO FOUR PERFORMANCE ARTISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A National Endowment for the Arts review panel that recommended awards to four 
artists that were overturned by NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer has asked for 
the panel to be reconvened to deliberate -- perhaps provocatively -- on how to 
allocate $23,000 in unspent funds. 
</P>
<P>
The call to reconvene the solo-performance fellowship panel was disclosed 
Sunday by Baltimore theater director Philip Arnoult, who chaired the panel that 
recommended 18 fellowship winners from among 90 applicants earlier this year. 
Disclosure of the call to reconvene came after Arnoult spent most of the 
weekend on the phone consulting with a variety of theater and arts community 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Arnoult said the NEA's theater program, which oversees the solo-performance 
award committee, had agreed to allow the panel to reconvene. It was not clear 
whether Frohnmayer, who is vacationing this week in Oregon and was unavailable 
for comment, would accept the appeal request. 
</P>
<P>
The four Frohnmayer grant denials were to controversial performance artists 
Karen Finley of New York City, Holly Hughes of New York City, John Fleck of Los 
Angeles and Tim Miller of Santa Monica. All four deal with politically charged 
content, some employ occasional nudity and body symbolism. All are activists on 
either feminist or sexual-preference issues whose work has been extensively 
reviewed by a broad range of established critics. 
</P>
<P>
"Our sense is that we want to get this on the table quickly," said Arnoult, who 
added that he and arts leaders with whom he spoke hope to avert what threatens 
to become a near-disintegration of support for the NEA within the arts 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Los Angeles performance artist Rachel Rosenthal, who was awarded an 
$11,250 fellowship in the program, said she will not accept the money. 
Rosenthal's action and the demand by Arnoult came as the first evidence of 
backlash over Frohnmayer's action, which was perceived by many in the arts 
community as an attempt by the NEA to appease its political critics. 
</P>
<P>
"This decision has apparently divided the performance community into the clean 
ones and the dirty ones," Rosenthal said. "Apparently, I'm among the clean 
ones, for some strange reason. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't want to be a part of a divisive issue of this nature. I am 
certainly not about to sign any obscenity clause (a condition of accepting NEA 
money this year). I think the obscenity is the singling out of certain people 
to be ostracized from this grant." 
</P>
<P>
Arnoult expressed frustration and rage, charging that by killing grants awarded 
by the panel, Frohnmayer was caving in to the political right. Arnoult said the 
embattled NEA chairman's decision had, in effect, left the endowment's 
respected grant-making procedures in tatters. 
</P>
<P>
Arnoult said that he was still assessing his options but that he will insist on 
having the panel reconvened so he and as many of its seven members as want to 
can officially quit. He said the panel might also review records of all 90 
performers it initially reviewed to select the 18 grantees and recommend 
funding for four more artists from among those who were nearly chosen -- some 
of whom do work as potentially controversial as those whose grants were denied 
by Frohnmayer. 
</P>
<P>
Arnoult declined to speculate whether the panel might take the provocative step 
of recommending grants to the same four artists Frohnmayer rejected. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the weekend, artists and arts supporters began to meet in major arts 
centers, including Los Angeles, Washington and New York, to discuss ways to 
respond to the new crisis engulfing the endowment, which faces imminent action 
in Congress on bills to extend its legal lifetime past October. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed clear that the immediate result of Frohnmayer's action would be an 
increase in the rejection rate of NEA grants by individual artists and arts 
institutions. Several influential officials of private arts groups said over 
the weekend that they also expected the beginning of a serious move within the 
arts community to force Frohnmayer out of his job. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever the short-term effects of the unprecedented decision, sources 
within the endowment and observers outside with close links to the federal arts 
agency agreed that the NEA action reflected a high-stakes, long-odds political 
gamble. 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer apparently decided that the good will of the arts community was 
expendable and that the endowment could survive only by redefining its concept 
of art to satisfy critics in Congress and the White House, according to some 
observers. 
</P>
<P>
"I would rather have to face the wrath of the arts community over turning down 
these four fellowships," said an NEA official with direct knowledge of the 
grant rejection situation, "than to deal with the White House and Congress if 
we had gone ahead and made them." 
</P>
<P>
Endowment observers said that Frohnmayer recently told a meeting of the NEA's 
program directors that his emphasis would be on accommodating political 
pressures on Capitol Hill at the expense of standing behind artistic principles 
at the endowment. "Our constituency," Frohnmayer was reliably reported to have 
told the program directors, "is the Hill." 
</P>
<P>
Immediately at issue was the rationale for Frohnmayer's decision. Earlier this 
year Arnoult's panel originally recommended the 18 fellowships. But, in May, 
the National Council on the Arts, the NEA's advisory board, was sent into a 
panic by publication of an account in a conservative newspaper column branding 
Finley's work as obscene. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to avert a new confrontation with conservatives in Congress, the council 
voted to defer action until early August on all 18 fellowships. But in the 
intervening weeks, Frohnmayer reportedly concluded that the NEA's situation in 
Congress was too volatile and precarious to wait and, on Friday morning, 
Frohnmayer rejected four of the 18 grants. 
</P>
<P>
It appeared over the weekend that a growing consensus is building that 
Frohnmayer may have satisfied no one -- that he has simultaneously failed in 
his attempt to placate conservative congressmen and undermined his support 
across all arts constituencies. 
</P>
<P>
When the NEA grant denials were made public, reaction from those in Congress 
who have been vociferous on the NEA issue was nearly absent. Sen. Jesse Helms 
(R-N.C.) declined to comment. Also ominously quiet or restrained were 
moderates, Reps. Paul Henry (R-Mich.) and Tom Coleman (R-Mo.), whose support 
Frohnmayer was apparently seeking in denying the grants. 
</P>
<P>
Henry, in particular, has proposed language to sharply restrict the kinds of 
arts projects the NEA can fund, which would include the types of performances 
that Finley, Hughes, Fleck and Miller often give. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, some arts observers said, Frohnmayer's action may have been an 
audition to demonstrate to Congress how effectively the endowment can 
neutralize controversial art. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this kind of a priori judgment of an artist's work is what is most 
onerous about this entire issue, and I think we have now seen the first 
illustration of what everybody has feared," said Bill Bushnell, artistic 
director of the Los Angeles Theatre Center. 
</P>
<P>
"One man (Frohnmayer) has set himself up as the arbiter of taste on a national 
basis," Bushnell said. "He has taken this action in some effort to appease the 
conservative right, and that's a futile gesture that, I think, will cause many 
of us to have to seriously re-examine what has been, to this date, unqualified 
support for John. I don't know yet that I'm prepared to state that he should 
resign, but I'm going to do some serious thinking about it."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: THE FULL TALE OF THE BARRY TAPE; ARSENIO VS. TED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
This one you didn't see on the Fox series "Cops." 
</P>
<P>
There he was on perhaps every newscast in the nation, as plain as a picture 
taken through a dirty lens, getting busted and handcuffed in a Washington hotel 
room by police and FBI agents who barged in as he prepared to leave. 
</P>
<P>
These brief excerpts, showing Washington Mayor Marion Barry getting snared in a 
Jan. 18 federal sting operation, were plucked from a videotape shown to jurors 
last Thursday in Barry's drug and perjury trial and captured by the ABC News 
pool camera in the courtroom. ABC provided the footage and sound to other 
broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
Quite a show. The images, which also appear to show Barry lighting and smoking 
a pipe -- allegedly containing crack cocaine -- in the presence of ex-model 
Rasheeda Moore, were commanding and indicting. No matter how many qualifiers 
anchors and reporters used, the pictures spoke for themselves, delivering a 
verdict with a heavy gavel. 
</P>
<P>
Guilty! 
</P>
<P>
This illustrates the danger of drawing conclusions from fleeting excerpts, the 
picture or word taken out of context. 
</P>
<P>
That is not to say that the Barry excerpts aren't damning. However, only by 
viewing the entire 90-minute videotape -- as shown Thursday and Sunday on 
dependable C-SPAN -- can you fully understand why some legal experts have said 
there's something in it for the defense as well as the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Only then would you see and hear the entire lengthy conversational foreplay to 
Barry's arrest, an intimate chattiness that captured the tone of the mayor and 
Moore even though many of their words were as inaudible as the pictures were 
blurry. 
</P>
<P>
Only then would you probably get the impression that Barry was initially far 
less interested in doing drugs than in having sex with the resistant Moore, his 
former mistress who had set him up for this sting. 
</P>
<P>
And only then would you hear Barry seemingly being coaxed by Moore to take 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
It was a voyeur's view that the FBI's hidden camera provided, and C-SPAN, with 
the luxury of time built into its format, let the tape run to its natural 
conclusion. "It's our philosophy to show you the whole thing when we can," 
senior vice president Susan Swain said from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, to hear the whole thing, too. After being arrested, Barry aimed 
some expletives at Moore. C-SPAN repeatedly ran a crawl alerting viewers to the 
raw language punctuating the videotape, but unlike many newscasts, did not 
speak over Barry and Moore at any time or run captions drawn from a government 
transcript. 
</P>
<P>
One particular sequence from the videotape lingers. It shows Barry, his hands 
handcuffed behind his back, berating himself for falling for the sting. "I 
should have known better," he mutters, "I should have known better." 
</P>
<P>
Following KNBC Channel 4's live coverage of Nelson Mandela's appearance in Los 
Angeles Friday -- the best coverage in town thanks to Linda Douglass' reporting 
from the field -- came Winnie Mandela's appearance on "Donahue." 
</P>
<P>
Showing why, when he's of a mind, he's still the best daytime talk-show host in 
the business, Donahue got Mandela to acknowledge that she's angrier than her 
husband and more skeptical than he about the white South African government 
that has loosened some of the binds of apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
She vowed to return to the bush and "take up the armed struggle" should 
negotiations fail between the government and African National Congress. That 
earned her a standing ovation from the studio audience. 
</P>
<P>
When the history of television in the 20th Century is written, Ted Koppel and 
"Nightline" will surely loom larger than "The Arsenio Hall Show." 
</P>
<P>
Except in St. Louis, perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
In Missouri's largest city, ABC affiliate KTVI-TV has decided to expel 
"Nightline" from its accustomed 10:30 p.m. (Central time) position to 
accommodate Hall's talk-show hour in tandem with something called "The Party 
Machine With Nia Peeples." 
</P>
<P>
Something smells. 
</P>
<P>
KTVI, which is owned by Times Mirror Broadcasting, is in business to make 
money. Fine. Profits are the soul of commercial broadcasting. And you can just 
bet that "The Arsenio Hall Show" -- which is one of TV's hottest items these 
days -- will top "Nightline" ratings. 
</P>
<P>
Something still smells. 
</P>
<P>
There are those times when doing what's "right" should take precedence over 
doing what's most profitable, and this is one of those times. Although Hall's 
show adds energy to late-night, laughs and celebrities you can get elsewhere on 
TV. "Nightline" you can't. If it's true, as a recent Times Mirror survey says, 
that today's youth are turned off by world affairs, then undercutting 
"Nightline" feeds the ignorance and apathy. 
</P>
<P>
ABC has rejected KTVI's offer to delay "Nightline" until midnight, citing its 
longstanding policy against 90-minute delays for the Koppel show, which emerged 
in 1980 as a spinoff from coverage of the Iran hostage crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The network correctly argues that allowing KTVI to delay "Nightline" 90 minutes 
would set a precedent that other affiliates surely would seek to follow. Some 
ABC stations already delay the program for as long as an hour. Moreover, ABC 
does allow two of its stations to delay it 90 minutes, but only because they've 
been doing so since its inception. 
</P>
<P>
ABC reportedly has had no success finding a home for "Nightline" on another St. 
Louis station, meaning that the city may lose this centerpiece of ABC News. 
</P>
<P>
How are blockbuster movies made? This helps. 
</P>
<P>
NBC's "Today" show followed its three-part series on "RoboCop 2" with an even 
bigger orgy on behalf of "Days of Thunder." Four parts -- including separate 
interviews with Tom Cruise and other cast members -- aired last week, with the 
fifth scheduled for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
All this for a movie of such modest merit that the best thing "Today" critic 
Gene Shalit could say in its behalf last week was that it should turn out to be 
a blockbuster. "Today" is doing its best to prove him right.

KIDBEAT: KCET SHOWS YOUNGSTERS THE JOYS OF READING; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: IF THE TUBE HAS TAKEN YOUNG PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE PRINTED PAGE, 
"HOOKED ON BOOKS" HOPES TO REVERSE THE TREND. SOUTHLAND LIBRARIES JOIN THE 
EFFORT. 
</P>

<P>
A television show that encourages kids to turn off the television? 
</P>
<P>
If KCET's new summer series "Hooked on Books" achieves its aim, children from 
kindergarten through sixth grade will be as quick to reach for a book as for 
the remote control. 
</P>
<P>
The six-week series, airing weekdays from 1 to 2:30 p.m. on Channel 28, 
beginning today, is presented in cooperation with the Southern California 
Library Systems. It will include reruns of some of KCET's best children's 
programs, chosen because they were based on books or have a strong literary 
connection: "Reading Rainbow," "WonderWorks," "Long Ago and Far Away," "3-2-1 
Contact" and "Tales From the Brothers Grimm," plus a new environmental show 
called "Kid's Eye View of Ecology." 
</P>
<P>
Each week the series will offer a different theme -- folk tales, travel, 
cultural awareness, science, fantasy and the Wild West. The programs, hosted by 
"My Two Dads" regular Chad Allen, will also feature "bookends" of commentary to 
stimulate conversation between child and parent and, most of all, reading. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any problem with young people turning off the television and 
reading," said David L. Crippens, KCET senior vice president of educational 
enterprises. He acknowledged that television in general has been a primary 
factor in taking children away from the world of books. 
</P>
<P>
"We've not intended to do that, but in some ways we have," he said. "Every 
medium has a good and bad effect. I know that television is a necessary part of 
young people's lives -- and so are books. It's imperative for us in 
telecommunications to encourage literacy. For the U.S. to remain competitive, 
we must have the most literate and educated population we can. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no throwaway young people," he stressed. "We can't say, 'Well, some 
will get it and some won't.' " 
</P>
<P>
The finale to each day's program will be a list of related books that are 
available at Southland libraries. Participating libraries will promote the 
programs and will be prepared to help curious young viewers who visit to find 
what they're looking for. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Eisenhut, children's coordinator for the Orange Public Library System, is 
joining the effort. "Different children learn in different ways. They can learn 
different things from TV and from books. We're hoping (the shows), in most 
cases based on books, will help kids discover that reading isn't drudgery, but 
is important to their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Katsouleas, a librarian at the Metropolitan Cooperative Library System in 
Altadena, said that KCET's programming ties in with "a greater interest in 
education in this country over the past few years. We feel television can be 
instrumental in bringing people back to books." 
</P>
<P>
"All the way through the series," Crippens said, "we're saying to children, 
'This is your world, and that world opens up by reading, by talking with adults 
and telling them what you've read, what you've seen, what you think and feel.' 
We want parents to talk with young people and become more involved in their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so much more difficult to be a young person today than when I was coming 
up," he said. "We have to include young people, talk with them, validate them. 
We're hoping our summer program will be a small part of that."

NO SCHOOL WILL ESCAPE THE BUDGET CUTS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: BOARD'S ACTION TO CLOSE THE $220-MILLION GAP WILL BRING LARGER 
CLASSES, FEWER TEXTBOOKS AND SUPPLIES. DIRTIER CLASSROOMS, FEWER SERVICES ALSO 
LIKELY.

Come September, kindergarten teachers at Parmelee Avenue Elementary School will 
have to vacuum their own classrooms or let their young students gather on dirty 
floors at story time. 
</P>
<P>
The PTA at Vanalden Elementary will have to stage an extra fund-raiser or two 
to try to recoup the lost state lottery funds that paid for their children's 
field trips to museums, the airport and the Los Angeles Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
And Manual Arts High School teacher Joe Cervantes will have to find a new way 
to pay for improvements to his acclaimed machine shop class facilities, or risk 
losing students. 
</P>
<P>
The sweeping budget cuts approved by the board of the Los Angeles Unified 
School District last week will touch virtually every school in the district 
this fall, bringing larger classes, less money for such basics as textbooks and 
paper, dirtier classrooms and fewer support services for schools that are 
already struggling to meet the needs of the district's 610,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it has really hit (parents and teachers) how bad it's going to 
be" when the cuts take effect, said Cathleen Kibala, principal at Parmelee in 
South-Central Los Angeles. "We are all going to suffer . . . and the children 
are going to suffer the most." 
</P>
<P>
After weeks of hand-wringing, the school board on Thursday closed a 
$220-million gap in its 1991 budget -- $81 million of which represents cuts 
that land right at the schoolhouse door. 
</P>
<P>
Schools will have less money to buy instructional materials like textbooks, or 
pay for special programs, activities or staff because they are losing lottery 
funds and facing deep cuts in campus budgets. 
</P>
<P>
Students with learning problems and those with special medical needs will no 
longer be screened by district physicians, whose services have been eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Custodial and maintenance service cutbacks will mean classrooms will be swept 
and vacuumed less often. Plugged toilets, broken windows, malfunctioning air 
conditioners -- all will take longer to repair. 
</P>
<P>
Some schools will have fewer campus security aides. 
</P>
<P>
And some schools will lose administrators, some of whom will be replaced by 
supervisors demoted from central offices. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to budget cuts that directly affect the schools, some of the nearly 
$35 million in central and regional administrative reductions will also be felt 
in the classroom, including cuts in teacher training projects, volunteer and 
tutorial programs, and support services for bilingual education. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been budget cuts every year, but nothing as serious as this year," 
said Kibala, who has spent 21 years as a teacher and principal in the school 
district. "This is so drastic." 
</P>
<P>
Over the last several years, as costs have continued to outpace revenues, the 
district has often been forced to trim services. As a result, schools have 
suffered a steady erosion, and teachers, parents and administrators have gotten 
used to scrambling to make do with less. 
</P>
<P>
"People just don't realize how little money the schools have," said Kelly 
Cooper, president of the 3rd Street Elementary PTA in Hancock Park. In her 
son's third-grade class, she said, parents have had to spend their own money to 
photocopy math enrichment work sheets because there were not enough to go 
around. 
</P>
<P>
And now, many parents and school officials fear they have been pushed beyond 
their limits by the cuts imposed last week. 
</P>
<P>
"You always have to make choices, to figure out how to slice up the pie," said 
Marvin Starer, principal of Manual Arts High School near the Los Angeles 
Coliseum. "But the pie has gotten so small now, it's come down to choices like 
are you going to have a classroom teacher or a campus (security) aide. We can't 
meet all the basic needs anymore." 
</P>
<P>
At his school, Starer faces the loss of two of his four assistant principals -- 
who would be replaced by administrators demoted in staff cutbacks from central 
or regional offices -- and the loss of more than $12,000 in lottery funds and 
another several thousand dollars that will be lopped from his school budget by 
September. 
</P>
<P>
A large portion of the school's lottery funds have been used to turn its 
industrial arts department into the pride of the district. Thousands have been 
spent to bring the district-issued, pre-World War II classroom training 
equipment up to today's standards. The showcase inside the shop, lined with 
contest-winning ribbons, attests to the students' skills. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been able to give the students training that allows them to come out of 
school with salable skills, to go to work at places like JPL (Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory) . . . to make $25 an hour right out of high school," said machine 
shop instructor Cervantes. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be devastating if our lottery funds are cut off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Inner-city schools like Manual Arts and Parmelee will be hard-pressed to 
replace the money allocated by the district through proceeds from the 
California Lottery. 
</P>
<P>
The district spends the bulk of its lottery money to pay salaries, but had 
given individual schools a portion -- $5 per student, down from $20 in 1986 -- 
to spend on special projects for students. Now, that per-school allocation will 
revert to the district's general fund to help balance the budget. 
</P>
<P>
"A school like ours doesn't have any extra money," said Starer. "We can't go to 
the booster club for $50,000 like a school in the Valley might. Our student 
body (organization) earns its money parking cars at the Coliseum." 
</P>
<P>
Some schools are luckier. The PTA at Vanalden Elementary in Reseda has pledged 
to try to make up the $2,500 the school would have received in lottery money 
next year, and many other schools' PTAs will be called upon to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
But, district PTA officials fear that may hurt other schools, since it will 
drain away money and energy usually spent on other projects, such as school 
health clinics. 
</P>
<P>
"What's going to happen is the same thing that happened after Proposition 13," 
said Diane Brahams of the 10th District PTA, which represents the southern half 
of the school district. "PTAs will say, 'Oh, this class needs globes, so we'll 
buy globes.' And that's less money for our eye and dental clinics . . . which 
may then have to close." 
</P>
<P>
While the lottery cut is the most visible and emotional for many schools, the 
cuts in custodial and maintenance service will probably hit schools the hardest 
in September. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't really see things like that until you need the services and you 
start to request them and they're not there," said Vanalden Principal Teri 
Cooke. "A door jams, a lock breaks, a light won't work . . . you call for 
repairs and what will happen?" 
</P>
<P>
The deep cuts in school maintenance will stretch further the already long 
waiting periods for things like painting and playground repair. The elimination 
of the furniture refinishing unit will mean schools will have to make do with 
shabby desks and chairs. 
</P>
<P>
Already, teachers at Parmelee Elementary have begun mopping their own 
classrooms "so the children have a clean place to come into," said Kibala. 
</P>
<P>
Kibala and her staff have tried to work around the deteriorating level of 
district-provided services, but they know it is going to get much worse. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been rationing ditto paper for a month, and I guess we'll have to cut 
the rations down," she said. "We'll have to consider cutting . . . everything, 
starting with pencils and paper." 
</P>
<P>
Until Friday, Kibala wasn't sure she would still be working at Parmelee. She 
was one of several school principals warned two weeks ago they might be demoted 
to accommodate displaced administrators. 
</P>
<P>
Now district officials say it appears no principals will be displaced after 
all. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago, as classes let out for the summer at T.S. King Junior High in 
Silver Lake, parents and teachers were still fretting over whether their 
principal would be allowed to return next fall. 
</P>
<P>
Although the principal was spared, the uncertainity attendant to the budget 
process this year left staff at King -- and the district's more than 500 other 
schools -- unable to make plans for the coming semester. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a lot of anxiety over the process and I'm sure there's going to 
be a lot of confusion during the first few weeks this fall," said King teacher 
Ed Brostoff.

40 YEARS LATER -- EXHIBIT REVIVES MEMORIES OF THE KOREAN WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JOHN H. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
Wanjoo Hyun introduces himself as a survivor. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in the first grade when the war began," Hyun, the 47-year-old owner of a 
restaurant in Orange, said last week as he visited an exhibit on the Korean War 
at the Korean Cultural Service in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though I was very young, I remember most things about the war," he said, 
recounting how fighting took the lives of family members and reduced Seoul, his 
hometown, to rubble. 
</P>
<P>
Hyun's eyes kept track of his two sons, Arnold, 14, Fred, 12, and their 
cousins, Edward and Janet Kim, ages 9 and 7, as they perused communist 
propaganda flyers, bazooka displays and a long-handled land mine detector 
propped like a mop in the exhibit commemorating the 40th anniversary of the 
start of the war. 
</P>
<P>
"The children ask me once in a while about what happened," Hyun said. "I 
explain my best, but this may be a better way to show them." 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit, open until Saturday, is one of several recent efforts to pay 
homage to the veterans who served in a war that took the lives of an estimated 
6 million Korean civilians and soldiers from 18 nations. 
</P>
<P>
Like Hyun, Koreans still cling to their memories. America's recollection of the 
conflict, though, has been less than vivid. 
</P>
<P>
From June 25, 1950, the day the war began, America's view of the conflict has 
been a curious one. Beginning with President Harry S Truman's insistence on the 
term police action to describe the U.S. role in the war, America's reluctance 
to acknowledge its full participation has been a painful subject for some 
veterans visiting the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's what really ticks me off," said Pete Hernandez, a former sergeant in 
the Army's 187th Airborne Regiment who drove four hours from Visalia to attend 
the exhibit. "In three years, 54,000 American soldiers got killed fighting the 
North Koreans. How come the American people don't know that?" 
</P>
<P>
The death toll of U.S. soldiers during three years of fighting in Korea was 
close to the 58,000 killed during the decade of warfare in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Coordinator Craig Coleman said the exhibit -- titled, "Korea: The Forgotten 
War, Remembered" -- reflects upon the eerie silence that greeted battle-weary 
troops when they returned home after a U.N. armistice agreement in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which officially called for a halt to the fighting, did not 
declare a victor or an end to the dispute, and the Korean War has since carried 
the inglorious distinction of being the only U.S. war this century that remains 
unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been bitter since I came home," Hernandez, 62, said. "Because no one 
seemed to care. No one seemed to say much about it." 
</P>
<P>
Korea's cold war continues. The peninsula, politically apportioned by 
superpowers after World War II, still is split between the communist North and 
the capitalist South. 
</P>
<P>
And for 60 million Koreans at home and abroad, June 25 provides modern 
history's most prominent reference point. For many Koreans, "before the war" is 
a phrase used commonly to describe the last time they saw family members who 
may now be dead, said Sukbong Lee, a retired brigadier general in the South 
Korean army. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Lee, 66, puzzled over the exhibit's title, "The Forgotten War," then 
found it ironic. One out every 10 Koreans in the world had died during 37 
months of warfare. 
</P>
<P>
"How could Koreans forget the war?" he asked incredulously.

MAYOR'S FIELD OF DREAMS FOR CITY SLOW TO BLOOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIME STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Calling Los Angeles "America's most fertile field of dreams," Mayor Tom Bradley 
launched his unprecedented fifth term in June, 1989, by pledging an ambitious 
series of housing, transportation and environmental programs. 
</P>
<P>
One year later, most of the mayor's reforms have yet to blossom. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Bradley's proposal to cut rush-hour truck traffic on city streets 
by 70% won initial City Council approval last November, but now is stalled. 
Mayoral staffers are trying to work out unresolved questions, such as ways to 
enforce the proposed truck ban. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's initiative to target more than $100-million a year in downtown 
redevelopment funds for affordable housing and after-school education is at an 
impasse. No visible progress has been made in what the mayor hailed as "the 
largest municipal housing and homeless plan in American history," and thousands 
of homeless people continue to sleep in cardboard "condos" and rescue missions 
within blocks of City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Other sweeping proposals -- such as turning the Los Angeles River into a 
verdant recreation area or maximizing city airport revenues by possible sale or 
long-term lease of Los Angeles International Airport to a private utility -- 
also have not moved beyond the talking stage. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of interviews in late June, Bradley and his top aides contended 
that substantial progress has been made during the last year on many of the 
more complicated and innovative proposals. 
</P>
<P>
But when the city's unwieldy bureaucracy and budgetary constraints are factored 
into the equation, they said, significant changes will take additional time and 
patience. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't discourage me or deter me just because a program may take many 
months longer than someone perceives that it should take," said Bradley, who 
has three more years to make good on his 1989 campaign promises. "I had an 
excellent year." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley and his staffers cited several significant accomplishments in the last 
year: 
</P>
<P>
* A five-year moratorium on the demolition of single-room occupancy hotels on 
Skid Row. 
</P>
<P>
* Creation of a division of storm drains to help protect Santa Monica Bay from 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
* Establishment of a public hot line for information on buses, vans and rider 
sharing to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Administration officials said that the mayor took a leadership 
role in getting the city to ban the sale of ammunition for one week before New 
Year's Eve and Independence Day. Bradley also proposed mandatory 10% cuts in 
water usage to ease the city's water shortage. 
</P>
<P>
Council members generally agree that Bradley, in seeking to move beyond the 
scandals that plagued his Administration for more than a year, has raised his 
visibility on major issues. 
</P>
<P>
"One year he ran for reelection and bragged about the fact that he did things 
quietly," said council President John Ferraro. "Now he's talking about 
everything that's coming down the pike." 
</P>
<P>
But Ferraro and several council members say it remains unclear whether the 
72-year-old mayor has the ability and inclination to accomplish his goals. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said he is encouraged that Bradley has hired several 
energetic aides, such as Chief of Staff Mark Fabiani and housing coordinator 
Michael Bodaken. However, he added, "It's too early to know how much of (the 
Bradley agenda) is going to come to fruition. I hope the staff that he has 
brought aboard is a precursor to things that will happen rather than . . . to 
create the appearance of change." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Independent Council 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores said the mayor has a more difficult time getting 
his proposals through the council. "I don't think it's as easy as it has been 
in past years for the mayor to make eight phone calls and get eight aye votes 
because I think we're looking at the issues on an individual basis," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Council supporters of Bradley counter that slow progress is the nature of big 
government and that rosy predictions are sometimes necessary to achieve 
long-term reforms. 
</P>
<P>
A case in point, said Councilman Marvin Braude, is the truck reduction 
proposal, which Bradley aides had predicted would be in place last fall. The 
measure aims to bar 70% of large trucks from city streets during rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
"That means regulating the whole of Southern California's trucking industry," 
Braude said. "It's a major step and to expect that can happen in six months is 
unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to do something new," the councilman added, "you can't admit that 
it's going to take a long time when you start. Otherwise, you're giving up 
before you begin." 
</P>
<P>
City traffic planners are conducting a noise study to assess the impact of 
late-night truck deliveries. The city also has asked the South Coast Air 
Quality Management District to assist in setting up enforcement procedures and 
fee structures for the ban, which the Bradley Administration believes should be 
used as a model for the entire Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reforms 'Dormant' 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been easy to throw something in place that wasn't well thought 
out and that didn't have the cooperation of key sectors of the Southern 
California economy," said Fabiani, who was promoted from the mayor's legal 
adviser to chief of staff last November. "The mayor chose to go around, meet 
with every affected party, try to bring them into the process. If that means a 
few extra months, in the end it is really going to be worth it." 
</P>
<P>
Fabiani said the mayor's 1988 proposal for massive affordable housing 
construction is equally complicated, since the funding scheme relies on county 
and school district approval to raise a court-imposed ceiling on Community 
Redevelopment Agency spending from $750 million to $5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have termed Bradley's initiative, which he unveiled in January, 1988, a 
thinly veiled attempt to free enormous sums of money for further redevelopment. 
They note that there is little incentive for schools and the county to 
surrender property tax revenues to the city. 
</P>
<P>
County budget officer Jerry Roos said last week that "progress has been slow," 
but that the county is open to further negotiations with the city. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley refused to discuss specifics of the impasse, saying only that "we 
haven't given up, we're going to go at it again." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor and his aides cite other progress on the affordable housing front in 
addition to the downtown demolition moratorium. In late June, the mayor 
established a new Affordable Housing Commission and a Housing Preservation and 
Production Department. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the city's housing crunch continues, according to city housing 
coordinator Bodaken, a former Legal Aid Foundation attorney who was appointed 
six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Bodaken said that the city had all but ignored the housing issue until a 1988 
city committee called for the annual production of 10,000 new housing units. 
</P>
<P>
And most reforms proposed by the committee "lay dormant" last year due to a 
nine-month vacancy in the housing coordinator's post, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Bodaken said, a top priority of the mayor's office is establishment of a 
fee system under which commercial developers would be required to pay 
per-square-foot assessments for construction of affordable housing. The council 
recently approved an ordinance placing developers on notice that the fee is 
being formulated. An extensive study is under way to help determine the fee 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recycling Scaled Down 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with a campaign promise, Bradley signed a law last January that 
eventually will require all households to recycle garbage. 
</P>
<P>
But the program has fallen behind schedule because of delays in the purchase of 
garbage trucks and in locating purchasers for the recycled plastics, glass and 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
Recycling was to begin in September in 150,000 households from Koreatown to 
Eagle Rock, but now is scheduled to start this fall in 24,000 homes in those 
areas. In other parts of the city, the starting date will be delayed until 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley wanted to establish an air quality management office staffed by four 
employees. But the City Council last year created a much larger Department of 
Environmental Affairs over the objection of the mayor. Since then, the mayor 
appointed a general manager, Lillian Kawasaki, to head the environmental 
affairs department, and 11 of the 20 authorized staff members have been hired. 
Kawasaki said her staff has begun coordinating the city's air pollution 
reduction efforts and is preparing a plan for dealing with coastline oil 
spills. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley has hired a city AIDS coordinator and a director to oversee efforts to 
expand the use of reclaimed water in public parks. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor, who had promised to expand the police force, won council approval 
for 500 new police officers last year. But his plan to hire another 400 police 
this year was rejected by the council on the recommendation of Police Chief 
Daryl F. Gates, who said that he would rather spend limited resources on more 
pressing needs. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's proposal to "green" the Los Angeles River has stirred words and 
action far beyond the river's banks. In Washington, a House committee has 
recommended a $700,000 study and in Sacramento, legislation is pending on an 
alternate plan to turn the concrete flood-control channel back into a natural 
waterway. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most controversy has been whipped up by another proposal. Later 
this summer, a $100,000 county transportation commission study is due on 
Assemblyman Richard Katz's (D-Sylmar) plan to turn the riverbed into an 
expressway.

A plutonium-powered satellite that will be launched from the shuttle Discovery 
this fall to explore the sun's poles poses little health risk in the event of 
an accident, space officials said last week. 
</P>
<P>
Ulysses' scientific instruments will be powered by a radioisotope 
thermoelectric generator, which converts heat from decaying plutonium into 
electricity. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists had opposed two such generators aboard the Galileo spacecraft 
launched to Jupiter last October, saying a Challenger-like accident could 
scatter the deadly plutonium over Florida. But Willis Meeks, Ulysses project 
manager for NASA, said at a news conference the chances of that happening were 
"very small." 
</P>
<P>
If plutonium were released into the atmosphere, Meeks said an additional 300 to 
400 cancer deaths would occur over 50 years based on the world's entire 
population. But a U.S. Energy Department engineer at the briefing said that 
estimate was much too high. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush is expected to approve the launch of the $750-million Ulysses, 
scheduled for Oct. 5. Ulysses will be the first spacecraft to orbit over the 
sun's poles, providing new insight into solar winds and magnetic fields.

RURAL ABORTION SERVICES DROP 
</P>

<P>
It is becoming increasingly difficult for women in rural areas to find a 
health-care facility offering abortions, according to a study by a 
reproductive-biology think tank that has found a 51% drop in the number of 
rural abortion providers since 1977. The study, released last week by the Alan 
Guttmacher Institute, found that 93% of all rural counties in the United States 
had no hospitals, clinics or physicians willing to do abortions in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
One half of all urban counties were in a similar position. In the latest of a 
series of abortion service surveys, the institute found a 19% drop in the 
number of rural providers between 1985 and 1988 -- a decline the researchers 
traced largely to decisions by rural hospitals to simply stop offering 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
"The greater the distance from a physician or facility providing abortions, the 
less likely a woman is to gain access to the service," the institute concluded. 
Those women are more likely to have abortions later in pregnancy, when the risk 
is higher, the researchers said.

SOVIET HEART DRUG APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new treatment for life-threatening heartbeat irregularities is believed to be 
the first Soviet drug licensed by a U.S. pharmaceutical company and approved by 
the Food and Drug Administration. Officials of Du Pont Co. said last week that 
the drug, Ethmozine, is used in the Soviet Union to treat the heart condition 
known as ventricular arrhythmia. 
</P>
<P>
The drug appears to be safer than the eight others in its class for patients 
who have had congestive heart failure, company officials said. Side effects, 
which include nausea and dizziness, occurred in 10% to 15% of patients who 
received the drug during clinical trials. The drug will be available in the 
United States in September. 
</P>
<P>
About 800,000 to 1.2 million Americans are being treated for life-threatening 
ventricular arrhythmias, which are related to more than 300,000 deaths each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The drug, developed in the Soviet Union in 1964, will be marketed by Du Pont 
under an agreement in which the Soviets receive royalties of 4% on worldwide 
sales, Landgraf said.

CARDINALS' UNEARNED RUNS ENOUGH TO BEAT DODGERS, 6-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rex Hudler and Willie McGee scored on third baseman Mike Sharperson's error to 
cap a four-run sixth inning as the St. Louis Cardinals rallied from a five-run 
deficit to beat the Dodgers, 6-5, Sunday at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals' comeback spoiled Rick Dempsey's three-for-four day and Kirk 
Gibson's two-hit, three-runs batted in performance. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers grabbed a 5-0 lead after three innings. Gibson had two-run double 
and Dempsey an RBI single in the first inning to get the Dodgers started. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second consecutive wild game between the two teams. The Cardinals 
got 12 hits off four Dodger pitchers, and Los Angeles got 11 hits off fifth St. 
Louis pitchers. On Saturday night, the Cardinals won, 6-5, as each team had 13 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, Fernando Valenzuela pitched a no-hitter while the Dodgers had 
12 hits. 
</P>
<P>
With the Cardinals trailing, 5-2, Jose Oquendo opened the sixth with a double 
that chased starter Mike Morgan. Oquendo took third on Jim Poole's wild pitch 
and scored on Ozzie Smith's groundout. Poole walked Tom Pagnozzi, threw two 
pitches to Hudler and then left with an injury. Tim Crews (1-3) walked Hudler 
and, with two out, gave up McGee's RBI double as St. Louis closed to within 
5-4. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Pendleton faked a squeeze bunt and Dempsey tried to pick Hudler off 
third, but his throw got past Sharperson at third and sailed into left field. 
Hudler scored, with the hard-charing McGee right behind. 
</P>
<P>
At first Dempsey was charged with an error, but the scoring was changed after 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Dipino (4-1) pitched two shutout innings of relief and Lee Smith got the 
last three outs to pick up his 10th save. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan, who leads the majors with three shutouts, allowed four straight singles 
with one out in the fourth. Oquendo and Pagnozzi each had an RBI in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals' sixth inning took Scott Terry off the hook. Terry was making his 
second start because Bryn Smith has a sore neck. Terry allowed seven hits in 
three innings, and with four earned runs saw his earned-run average rise to 
7.59.

MORNING BRIEFING: CARL FURILLO ALMOST PITCHED A NO-HITTER FROM THE OUTFIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED BROCK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fernando Valenzuela and Stan Javier will attest that an outfielder can keep a 
no-hitter alive with a quick jump and a running catch. But Dodger folklore 
includes a moment when an outfielder kept one going with his arm. 
</P>
<P>
In a story on the great throwing arms of outfielders in baseball history and 
those of today, Steve Marcus of Newsday writes: 
</P>
<P>
"Aug. 27, 1951. Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher Ralph Branca allowed what should have 
been his first hit of the game -- a one-hop liner to right by Pittsburgh 
Pirates pitcher Mel Queen. But right fielder Carl Furillo charged the ball and 
gunned it to first in time to nail Queen. The no-hitter lasted until the ninth 
when Branca gave up two hits. 
</P>
<P>
"In the next morning's newspaper, Dick Young wrote, 'The two fine Italian arms 
of Branca and Furillo had a no-hitter running for eight innings.' " 
</P>
<P>
Add no-hitters: The Times of London, noting that Friday was the first time 
pitchers in both the American and National Leagues had thrown no-hitters on the 
same day, made a game attempt at explaining the event's significance: "Strictly 
speaking, a no-hitter does not mean that no opponents have hit the ball. It 
means that no batter has reached first base, except, of course, those who walk. 
If you feel a little confused, please join the club. Neverthless, a no-hitter 
is a considerable achievement." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: In the last five years, what university has produced the most 
choices in the first three rounds of the NFL draft? 
</P>
<P>
Mismatched M's: According to Larry LaRue of the Tacoma Morning News-Tribune, in 
the midst of Friday night's 22-minute brawl between the Milwaukee Brewers and 
the Seattle Mariners, Pete O'Brien of the Mariners said to Dave Parker of the 
Brewers, "Oh, hell, how did I get matched up with you?" 
</P>
<P>
Down time: FIFA, the governing body of world soccer, is concerned that delays 
for fouls, placing the ball for free kicks and various other time-killing 
tactics are substantially reducing the actual playing time of World Cup 
matches. 
</P>
<P>
FIFA's study of matches played before Saturday showed that the 1-1 draw between 
England and Ireland was the shortest, just 49 minutes of real playing time out 
of the regulation 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
After England-Ireland came Austria-Czechoslovakia and Brazil-Argentina, both 
with 51 minutes of action. Romania's 2-0 victory over the Soviet Union had the 
most action, 67 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Prepare for takeoff: Each time Bruce Coslet, the new coach of the New York 
Jets, has a career record with the team above the .500 level, he'll be able to 
say he's at least one up on every other coach in Jet history. 
</P>
<P>
Since the franchise began in 1960, none of its previous nine coaches has left 
with a winning record. The first, Sammy Baugh, came the closest. He was 14-14 
in 1960-61. 
</P>
<P>
And despite Weeb Ewbank's seasons with Joe Namath, which included a victory in 
Super Bowl III, his record with the Jets (1963-73) was 73-78-6. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Miami, with 22. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Washington Bullet Coach Wes Unseld, on whether he would put 
second-round draft pick Greg Foster in the same category as Manute Bol when Bol 
was a rookie: "No. He can play basketball." TED BROCK

COMMENTARY: A GREAT WEEKEND TO TAKE IN A NO-HITTER OR THREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Fernando, you looked marvelous. 
</P>
<P>
And, Stew, that was some kind of Cy of relief. 
</P>
<P>
Be thankful today that neither of you pitch for the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
An amazing weekend: Two pitchers throw no-hitters on the same night -- and one 
of them isn't Nolan Ryan. Two days later, a Yankee throws a no-hitter and 
loses, 4-0. That's three in three days, five in a month and six in less than 
half a season. 
</P>
<P>
Any less offense and we'll have another World Cup on our hands. 
</P>
<P>
Already, Andy Hawkins is kicking himself. He was fortunate enough to no-hit the 
Chicago White Sox on Sunday -- and unfortunate enough to do it while backed by 
the Yankee defense. Two fly balls were dropped and four unearned White Sox came 
home, events that undoubtedly had to stump Merrill. 
</P>
<P>
Stranger still, however, was Friday night, when Fernando Valenzuela and Dave 
Stewart became the first men this century to pitch no-hitters on the same date. 
A double no-no. A no-no-no-no. A pair of hitless games in different leagues and 
in different countries, separated by only a few sweeps of the hour hand. 
</P>
<P>
Except for Ryan, it couldn't happen to a couple of nicer guys. You always pull 
for Ryan -- he's 43, all-natural and apparently still in need of ammunition in 
a ludicrous Hall of Fame debate that should've been put to bed a decade ago. 
But on a night Ryan doesn't pitch, it would be tough locating two more worthy 
rooting interests than the former Dodger teammates Valenzuela and Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
For nine seasons now, Valenzuela has been the Dodgers' Incredible Shrinking 
Pitcher. In 1981, the year of his miracle breakthrough, Fernando was larger 
than life. He was Dodger baseball, National League baseball, major league 
baseball. Five shutouts and eight victories in his first eight decisions. The 
league lead in strikeouts. The NL Cy Young Award. The NL rookie of the year 
award. 
</P>
<P>
And that was just for the pitching. 
</P>
<P>
Fernando also hit better than some of his infielders. He fielded everything 
that was dribbled, bunted, chopped and lined around the mound. He ran the bases 
with, shall we say, a crazed virtuosity. He was a tremendous athlete, trapped 
inside a body that resembled a bag of melted caramels. 
</P>
<P>
A movement was formed. Fernandomania. Journalistic pilgrimages were made to 
Valenzuela's birthplace in Navajoa, Mexico, to unearth the roots of the story. 
Frenzied mobs formed outside the Dodger ticket offices in anticipation of 
Fernando's next start. Talk-show callers and letter writers, having studied the 
pudgy frame and the broad features splattered across his face, wondered, in 
total seriousness, if we weren't witnessing the reincarnation of Babe Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
Ensuing years ebbed at Fernando's stature. He won 19 games in 1982, lost 17 in 
1984, won 21 in 1986 and broke even, 14-14, in 1987. He had blended into the 
scenery, just another dependable starter, just another stable ship in a sea of 
Doc Goodens, Frank Violas and Mike Scotts. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the arm gave out and Fernando was all but forgotten. He missed the last 
half of the 1988 season, and the trip to World Series fantasyland that came 
with it, sitting idly by while being replaced in Dodger hearts and minds by 
Orel Hershiser. 
</P>
<P>
Fernando was hit with a fate worse than retirement. Still shy of his 29th 
birthday, he was moved to the past tense. He became Exhibit A in the escalating 
argument that the Dodgers abuse their starting pitchers. When Hershiser 
ultimately took his turn under the knife, Valenzuela resurfaced as a point of 
reference. Well, look what happened to Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart, who played with Valenzuela from 1981 to 1983, has played out his 
career almost in reverse. A fringe talent early on, he bounced from the Dodgers 
to Texas to Philadelphia, gaining more notoriety for a lewd-conduct arrest with 
a transvestite than anything he did or didn't do on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, he was released by the Phillies and signed by Oakland. The A's 
weren't expecting much, maybe some help in middle relief. But Stewart had been 
tinkering with a new pitch, the split-fingered fastball, and once he mastered 
it, near the end of the 1986 season, his life changed. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, he became a 20-game winner. And again in 1988. And again in 1989. He 
won a World Series ring. He won a World Series MVP trophy. 
</P>
<P>
But the one thing he didn't win -- the Cy Young Award -- never failed to 
obscure that story line. Dave Stewart has become the Best Pitcher Who Can't Win 
the Cy Young. It beats talking about Lucille, no doubt, but Stewart longs for 
the day when he can get through one interview without a question about the 
missing piece of hardware in his Oakland home. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, a month ago, it looked as if it wouldn't take longer. Stewart won his 
first five decisions and was 9-3 before hitting June and hitting the skids. 
</P>
<P>
Three straight losses left him at 9-6. The slump also left him behind teammates 
(Bob Welch), old sparring mates (Roger Clemens), Angels (Chuck Finley) and even 
Eric King (!) in the latest American League Cy Young derby. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart needed to make a move. A bold move is what he came up with. On Friday 
evening, he no-hit the Toronto Blue Jays, 5-0, thus throwing the first hitless 
game inside the SkyDome. 
</P>
<P>
That's one way of turning momentum. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart has never actually been jobbed out of the Cy Young. In 1987, Clemens 
had a better earned-run average. In 1988, Viola won more games. And in 1989, no 
one, Stewart included, couldn't object to Bret Saberhagen. 
</P>
<P>
But as Fernando knows, a pitcher's brightest light flashes only briefly and 
Stewart could be running out of chances. If not this year, when? But now, he's 
halfway to 20 victories again, his ERA is in the 2.50 range -- and, in case of 
a tiebreaker, he has the no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Timing, timing. Amid the many ironies played out in Toronto and Los Angeles 
Friday night was Valenzuela no-hitting the St. Louis Cardinals while Hershiser 
looked on from the disabled list. Fortunes change so quickly. Last year, the 
Dodgers drew criticism for shelling out $2 million to re-sign a pitcher who 
went 10-13 in 1989. Today, Fernando has the look of a long-time keeper. 
</P>
<P>
No, Valenzuela and Stewart couldn't have picked better moments to notch their 
places in history. To borrow from Ernie Banks, it was a great day to no-hit 
two.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was old-timers day at Dodger Stadium, but the subject was current events. . 
. . "You've got to be lucky to pitch a no-hitter," said an authority named 
Sandy Koufax, a couple of hours before Andy Hawkins wasn't so fortunate in 
Chicago. "And if you have good stuff, it's easier to be lucky." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Fernando Valenzuela had good stuff Friday night and got lucky with two out in 
the eighth inning. St. Louis Cardinal rookie Craig Wilson was at bat for the 
first time. Dodger eye-in-the-sky Joe Ferguson knew the right-handed Wilson was 
supposed to be an opposite field hitter. He instructed Coach Bill Russell to 
move center fielder Stan Javier a few steps to his left, but then changed his 
mind and told Russell to wait until after Wilson took a swing. Wilson promptly 
hit a drive to left center that Javier wouldn't have caught had he moved. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Koufax said the best he pitched during his four no-hitters was the last two 
innings of his perfect game against the Chicago Cubs in 1965 and the first two 
innings against the New York Mets in 1962. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Fit and tanned, Sandy was perfect again Sunday. He retired the only two batters 
he faced in the old-timers game, getting Maury Wills to ground out to third 
baseman Ron Cey and Ted Sizemore to fly out to left fielder Lou Johnson. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The most unusual thing about Valenzuela pitching his no-hitter is that he's 
not overpowering," Koufax said. "You usually think of guys with exceptional 
fastballs. It's a tribute to Freddy that he did it six, seven years after he 
was at his best." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Among others delighted was Al Campanis, who signed an 18-year-old Valenzuela to 
a Dodger contract out of the Mexican League. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Fernando was a pitcher Friday," Campanis said. "He used the inside part of the 
plate. That's something we used to try to get him to do. He's always pitched 
well to the outside corner, but a pitcher should work like an accordion player 
. . . inside and outside." . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers outbid the New York Yankees for Valenzuela's services in 1979 by 
$25,000, paying Puebla $120,000. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I went with Mike Brito to see him pitch for Yucatan, where he was on loan," 
Campanis said. "He struck out Earl Williams, who once was a good major league 
hitter, with the bases loaded. That told me all I needed to know about his 
poise." . . . 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis pitcher Bob Tewskbury asked Koufax to autograph a baseball for him. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
Koufax on Roy Campanella, the Hall of Fame catcher who is hospitalized in 
Northridge with respiratory problems: "He's a special guy who has never let 
anything beat him." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Owen, 74, hit some line drives in batting practice and, with a little 
help from first baseman Tommy Davis, got an infield single to drive home the 
winning run for his side. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Al (The Bull) Ferrara recalled dropping a fly ball during his first game with 
Cincinnati in 1971 after being traded by San Diego for Angel Bravo. When he got 
to the dugout, Sparky Anderson glared at him. "What did you expect for Angel 
Bravo?" Ferrara said. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela outhit the Cardinals, 1-0, Friday and is hitting .333. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Gene Hermanski was introduced as having been involved in the last Dodger triple 
play in 1949. No, the Los Angeles Dodgers never have executed one. . . . 
</P>
<P>
From Al Downing: "I don't miss playing. Maybe infielders and outfielders do, 
but not pitchers. Pitching is painful." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Now that Tommy John is finally at home after a career that began in 1961, 
8-year-old son Taylor is touring the country as a singer with the road company 
of "Les Miserables." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Vin Scully has broadcast 14 no-hitters, including the perfect games of Don 
Larsen and Koufax. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The last play of Fernando's no-hitter suddenly appeared as the new climax to 
the Dodgers' 100th anniversary film shown on DiamondVision. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Bill Singer pitched a no-hitter for the Dodgers in 1970, Jerry Reuss in 1980, 
and Fernando in 1990. Look for Kiki Jones to pitch one in 2000. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Jaime Jarrin, looking terrific at the old-timers luncheon Saturday, will return 
to the booth for CBS Radio's Spanish-language broadcast of the All-Star Game 
July 10. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Duke Snider on Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series: "I was 0 for 3, 
but I did hit a foul ball pretty hard down the right-field line." . . . 
</P>
<P>
On the second day of July, there are only 15 more promotions left on the Dodger 
Stadium schedule. . . . 
</P>
<P>
From Tom Lasorda: "These days there are orthopedic surgeons and doctors and all 
their fancy equipment all over the place. Back when I was playing, there was 
one trainer with a bottle of rubbing alcohol and by the seventh inning, he'd 
drunk half of it."

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
METS TURN UP HEAT IN EAST, SCORE 3-2 VICTORY OVER THE SLUGGISH REDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
There is a hot race in the National League East. There is no race in the West. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets, taking advantage of some sloppy play by the Cincinnati Reds, pulled 
out a 3-2 victory Sunday at New York to take three out of four from the leaders 
of the West and keep the pressure on Pittsburgh in the East. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets, who have won 19 of their last 22 games, turned three Cincinnati 
errors into three unearned runs. The surge has wiped out all but one game of a 
9 1/2-game deficit the Mets had to make up to get back in the race. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds are 7-7 in their last 14 games. But, because there is no other team in 
the division ready to make a run at them, they have actually increased their 
lead from 7 1/2 games to 9 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds, who still have the best record in the league (46-27), don't figure to 
be able to claim that much longer. 
</P>
<P>
They have stopped hitting, their pitching is becoming suspect and suddenly, 
their defense is getting sloppy. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave them all three runs," Manager Lou Piniella said. "I don't understand 
it. We've played great defensive ball all year." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Oliver's pinch double off John Franco in the top of the ninth tied the 
score. 
</P>
<P>
But, in the bottom of the ninth, helped by a slippery field from rain that 
caused a 91-minute delay in the sixth inning, the Mets won it. 
</P>
<P>
Mackey Sasser opened with a bloop double that left fielder Billy Hatcher 
probably would have caught under normal conditions. Then, Kevin Elster bunted 
and Ken Griffey Sr., playing first base, picked it up and threw past third 
baseman Chris Sabo. Sasser scored easily to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have had him at third, I just threw too low," Griffey said. Griffey 
spent most of his career in the outfield. He was playing his fourth game at 
first base this season. 
</P>
<P>
Play was stopped with the Mets at bat in a 1-1 game. They had two runners on 
base with one out. When play resumed, second baseman Mariano Duncan fumbled 
Darryl Strawberry's grounder to load the bases. Kevin McReynolds hit a long fly 
to center to score the run. 
</P>
<P>
A two-base throwing error by Luis Quinones set up the Mets' first run in the 
second inning. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 8, San Francisco 5 -- The question is, who is going to make a run at 
the Reds? Apparently, it won't be the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
They were at home, playing the slumping Pirates, while the Reds were losing 
three out of four at New York. But the Giants lost two out of three. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates hit four home runs in this game, including two-run shots by Barry 
Bonds, Sid Bream and Jay Bell. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants, who might be without ailing veteran Rick Reuschel the rest of the 
season, continue to have pitching problems. Their staff ERA is 4.10. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Garrelts, who had a 4-0 June, was given four runs in four innings, but 
lasted only four innings himself. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem for the Giants is Kevin Mitchell's hamstring injury. Last 
year's home run king, Mitchell failed as a pinch-hitter and has gone four for 
24 the last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets were talking about their series with the Reds being a preview of the 
championship series, but the Pirates aren't conceding. 
</P>
<P>
They were encouraged by John Smiley in his first appearance since going on the 
disabled list May 15 because of a broken finger. Although he only lasted four 
innings, the left-hander reported no problems. He gave up nine hits and all 
five runs. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 11, San Diego 10 -- How about the Padres? They blew a three-game series 
to the Cubs, one of the two weak teams in the East, and have lost five in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
A former Padre, Luis Salazar, had a hand in winning the last two. He doubled 
home three runs in the eighth inning of the Cubs' 7-3 victory Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
At San Diego Sunday, Salazar hit a three-run home run in the eighth inning to 
help the Cubs erase a 10-7 deficit with a four-run rally. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Clark hit a three-run home run for the Padres and Tony Gwynn ended an 
zero-for-12 slump with three hits. But the Padres' Dennis Rasmussen couldn't 
hold a 5-1 lead and bullpen ace Craig Lefferts couldn't hold a 10-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 5, Atlanta 1 -- Oil Can Boyd held the Braves to four hits in seven 
innings at Montreal and won for the first time in his last seven starts. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd (4-3) had not won since beating San Diego, 4-0, May 23. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Mike Fitzgerald drove in three runs for the Expos, who remained 2 1/2 
games behind Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 8, Houston 4 -- The Astros, desperate for a starter, brought Danny 
Darwin out of the bullpen at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Darwin, who has made 111 relief appearances for the Astros, gave up only three 
hits and a run in six innings and left with a 3-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly thereafter, the roof fell in. The Phillies scored five runs with two 
out in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Although he gave up a run in the ninth, Roger McDowell, who has lost his job as 
closer, was the winner. DAN HAFNER

KEN JOHNSON KNOWS HOW HAWKINS FEELS; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: FORMER HOUSTON COLT .45 PITCHER RECALLS DISAPPOINTMENT WHEN HE NO-HIT 
CINCINNATI IN 1964 AND LOST, 1-0. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Ken Johnson's phone started ringing Sunday evening. 
</P>
<P>
"You're about the 10th call," he said from his home in Pineville, La., a small 
town located in the center of the state on the Red River. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 57, hasn't pitched in the big leagues since 1970, but he was suddenly 
back in the spotlight, put there by the New York Yankees' Andy Hawkins. 
</P>
<P>
Like Hawkins did Sunday, Johnson once lost a complete-game no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who pitched for seven teams during a 13-year career, was with the 
Houston Colt .45s (later the Astros) when he no-hit the Cincinnati Reds on 
April 23, 1964, at Houston and lost, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
It was pointed out to Johnson that in the 1965 edition of the Official Baseball 
Guide, he is quoted as saying, "I'm not happy about losing the game, but I know 
that if we'd won, people would have forgotten by next year that I'd pitched a 
no-hitter. This way, they'll talk about it for maybe the next 20 or 30 years." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said that didn't come from him. 
</P>
<P>
"Pete Runnels, our first baseman, came up with that," Johnson said. "I was very 
disappointed to lose the game. They don't pay you to lose. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't until a few years later that it set in that I had pitched a 
no-hitter. I was proud to have pitched it. 
</P>
<P>
"For a pitcher, a no-hitter is the ultimate." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's frustration at the time is understandable. His ninth-inning error 
contributed to the loss. 
</P>
<P>
With one out, Pete Rose bunted down the third-base line, and Johnson's throw to 
first was wide, enabling Rose to go to second. He went to third on a groundout 
and scored on an error by second baseman Nellie Fox. 
</P>
<P>
"After the game, I saw Nellie sitting there with his head down and went over 
and told him, 'Hey, it was my fault. It was my error that cost us the game.' 
</P>
<P>
"Runnels overheard me, and that's when he pointed out that at least they'd be 
talking about this for 20 or 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't much consolation at the time." 
</P>
<P>
Later, things were better. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Koufax and Jim Bunning also pitched no-hitters in 1964, Bunning pitching 
a perfect game against the New York Mets. Johnson and those two were honored 
for their no-hitters during a ceremony at the 1971 Hall of Fame inductions at 
Cooperstown, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
"It was quite a thrill to be grouped with those two guys," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was 11-16 in 1964, but improved to 16-10 in 1965 after he was traded 
early in the season to the Milwaukee Braves. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves moved to Atlanta the next season, and Johnson had records of 14-8 
and 13-9 before falling to 5-8 in the 1968. 
</P>
<P>
His three-plus seasons with Houston were tough. "One year, I tied Don Drysdale 
with a 2.65 earned-run average, about seventh in the league, and Drysdale wins 
23 games and I win 11," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
"They used to say, 'Poor ol' Ken Johnson, they never score any runs for him.' I 
remember one game against the Phillies, they had a Runs for Johnson Night, and 
any woman with a run in her stocking got in free." 
</P>
<P>
After leaving baseball in 1970, Johnson returned to his hometown of West Palm 
Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Then in 1980, he and wife Lynn moved to Pineville, where Johnson got a job at 
Louisiana College, a liberal arts NAIA school of about 1,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was hired as the assistant baseball coach, and also given a 
fund-raising job and put in charge of the men's dorm. 
</P>
<P>
He's semi-retired now, keeping only the coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was familiar with Louisiana College because sons Ken Jr. and Russell 
and daughter Janet all went there. 
</P>
<P>
"I would visit every year, especially when both my sons were playing college 
ball," he said. "I used to tell 'em back in West Palm Beach that I was taking 
off for the spring, and I'd go out there and live in a dorm." 
</P>
<P>
He got to know the baseball coach, Billy Algood, who was also the athletic 
director and basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
"During one of my visits, I kind of asked him if he needed any help, and he 
said yes," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
It's been a peaceful life. Johnson said he spends most of his time fishing. 
</P>
<P>
But things got a little more exciting on Sunday when the phone started ringing, 
and Johnson seemed to enjoy the attention. 
</P>
<P>
"Thanks for calling," he said.

MEN'S BEACH VOLLEYBALL;

<P>
KIRALY AND FROHOFF RISE TO OCCASION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Karch Kiraly was a bit worried before Sunday's Manhattan Beach Open final that 
he and partner Brent Frohoff would still be in a "nap stage" when the 
championship match began. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Kiraly and Frohoff woke up just in time -- when they were 
down, 10-5 -- to top-seeded Sinjin Smith and Randy Stoklos. 
</P>
<P>
Kiraly and Frohoff battled back to win, 15-13, and take the title in one of pro 
beach volleyball's most prestigious events. 
</P>
<P>
The winners split the first-place pot of $13,200. The winning point came when 
Stoklos tried to go over Kiraly's block and missed wide with a spike. 
</P>
<P>
It was also Kiraly who got his team even, 11-11, when he faked Stoklos to one 
side, and dropped a shot into the open court. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal for this summer is for Brent and me to come out as the best team on 
the beach," Kiraly said. "Sinjin and Randy have been great for a long time, but 
everybody wants to be No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday was another big step in that direction for the sport's hottest new 
tandem. 
</P>
<P>
Kiraly and Frohoff have reached six consecutive finals, winning three, since 
Kiraly switched from partner Kent Steffes in late May. 
</P>
<P>
The pair practiced for only one game before teaming up to win the Venice Open 
on May 29 with a 15-2 victory over Smith and Stoklos. They also won the Cape 
Cod Open last weekend at West Dennis Beach in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really starting to click as a team," Frohoff said. "We're playing off of 
each other really well right now, and that fires both of us up." 
</P>
<P>
Smith and Stoklos have been the sport's dominant team for the last decade. But 
they lost twice to Kiraly and Frohoff in Sunday's double-elimination 
tournament, the first time in the winner's bracket final, which knocked Smith 
and Stoklos into the consolation round. 
</P>
<P>
Kiraly and Frohoff waited almost two hours for Smith and Stoklos to come 
through the consolation bracket, setting up the final matchup. 
</P>
<P>
Smith and Stoklos advanced to the final with a 15-10 victory over Tim Hovland 
and Mike Dodd. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Kiraly napped. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes a team can be a little too rested," said Kiraly, a two-time Olympic 
gold medalist. "Then they never really snap out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Kiraly and Frohoff did.

CAPRIATI WILL ADD GRAF TO HER LIST IN TODAY'S FEATURE AT WIMBLEDON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WIMBLEDON, England 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who is missing from this list? Martina Navratilova, Monica Seles, Gabriela 
Sabatini and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario. 
</P>
<P>
Did you say Steffi Graf? 
</P>
<P>
In a career that began in March, Jennifer Capriati has played all the 
top-ranked players except Graf, ranked No. 1, but all that changes today. 
</P>
<P>
Capriati, 14, and Graf, 21, punctuate a long day of heavyweight matches today 
at Wimbledon as the 106th All England Championships begin a second week. 
</P>
<P>
Graf, who flew to Hamburg, West Germany, Saturday night to see a doctor about a 
flareup of sinusitis, said she expects a good match. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't that I was really eager for it before, but now that it's happened, 
I'll enjoy it," Graf said. 
</P>
<P>
Possibly, but Graf's road to a third consecutive Wimbledon title does not look 
very easy. After Capriati, she could play Jana Novotna, Seles in the semifinals 
and Navratilova in the final. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova's way seems much clearer: Judith Weisner, then possibly Katarina 
Maleeva and Gabriela Sabatini before meeting Graf in the final. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen fourth-round matches are scheduled today as well as the completion of 
Ivan Lendl's third-round match with Bryan Shelton that was halted at dusk 
Friday tied one set apiece. 
</P>
<P>
The top men's matches include second-seeded Boris Becker against Pat Cash, 
third-seeded Stefan Edberg against No. 13 Michael Chang, seventh-seeded Brad 
Gilbert against David Wheaton, Guy Forget against Christian Bergstrom and Goran 
Ivanisevic against Mark Koevermans. THOMAS BONK

STALWART CHARGER LIGHTS SILVER SCREEN; 
</P>
<P>
HORSE RACING: GELDING WINS BY 4 1/2 LENGTHS, PROMPTS TRAINER TO CALL HIM BEST 
3-YEAR-OLD IN THE UNITED STATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Forget about Unbridled, Summer Squall or all other 3-year-olds anybody cares to 
mention. 
</P>
<P>
According to Pico Perdomo, each of them has to take a back seat to his Stalwart 
Charger. 
</P>
<P>
"No 3-year-old in the country can touch this horse," he said after the gelded 
son of Stalwart did exactly what he was supposed to do in the $160,100 Silver 
Screen Handicap Sunday at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Making his first start since he dominated his California Derby foes April 21, 
the 3-5 favorite drew away when asked in the final furlong to win by 4 1/2 
lengths. 
</P>
<P>
The final time of 1:48 2/5 wasn't earth-shattering and neither was the 
competition -- Toby Jug, the longest shot in the field at almost 20-1, was 
second -- but this didn't faze Perdomo. 
</P>
<P>
The trainer has never been afraid to speak his mind when it comes to Stalwart 
Charger, and he seemed almost defiant in the winner's circle Sunday after he 
won for the fourth time in five starts. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't prove much in this race except for a couple of things," he said. "He 
proved if you have a bazooka, I know how to pull the trigger. Something people 
have to know is that I know how to train a good horse. This proved to people 
that I know my business. 
</P>
<P>
"I've told everybody all along, there's no competition in the country for this 
horse. I was telling people this long before he broke his maiden (Feb. 11 at 
Santa Anita). Now, you're waiting to cut my neck, no? Well, you better get a 
chair and sit because it's going to be a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Now, it's on to the $200,000 Swaps in three weeks for owner Sidney Factor's 
chestnut, who was purchased for $27,500 as a 2-year-old, then the Super Derby 
in September. 
</P>
<P>
"He cruised," the trainer said while watching the replay in the infield. "His 
ears were pricked. It doesn't matter four lengths, five lengths or a neck. It 
doesn't matter. He just does what he has to do." 
</P>
<P>
Third behind Big Bass and 5-2 second choice Kentucky Jazz early, Stalwart 
Charger moved up to engage the latter around the turn, then pulled away through 
the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Toby Jug, who trailed most of the way, was nearly two lengths better than 
Kentucky Jazz, then came Big Bass and Warcraft. Music Prospector was scratched. 
</P>
<P>
Aboard Stalwart Charger for the first time in the afternoon, Pincay came away 
impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"I really believe he could be a really top horse," he said. "You hate to get 
high on horses because a lot of them disappoint you, but I think this race is 
going to do him a lot of good. 
</P>
<P>
"He's kind of a lazy horse and he was kind of intimidated being on the inside 
(at the start). You just have to make him do everything. One day, he's going to 
decide to run and he's going to be a much better horse. 
</P>
<P>
"I was afraid he might get a little tired today, but he was finishing. I could 
feel that he was still strong. I think he likes the whip. Every time I hit him, 
he gave me a little more. The time wasn't that fast, but when I moved up to 
second with him, I just sat there for a long time because I didn't want to open 
up with him. He tends to loaf when he's on the lead. I'm going to keep my 
fingers crossed that he keeps improving." 
</P>
<P>
Steinlen, who bypassed the recent Inglewood Handicap, will carry top weight of 
125 pounds Wednesday in the $200,000-added American Handicap at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Conqueror of Hawkster, Golden Pheasant and others in the Hollywood Turf 
Handicap, Steinlen was one of seven entered Sunday morning for the American, 
which will be run at 1 1/8 miles on the turf. 
</P>
<P>
Laffit Pincay, who took over from Jose Santos on the 1989 Eclipse Award winner 
in the Turf Handicap, again has the call. On that day, Santos rode Criminal 
Type to an upset victory over Easy Goer and Housebuster in the Metropolitan 
Mile at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
Those scheduled to oppose Steinlen are Classic Fame, third as the favorite in 
the Inglewood; Pleasant Variety, third in the Golden Gate Handicap behind 
Petite Ile and Valdali; Shining Steel; Mohamed Abdu, who returned after an 
extended layoff to win the Inglewood; Gran Judgement, and Colway Rally. 
</P>
<P>
Away since January of 1989 after suffering a leg injury in a race at Turf 
Paradise, Mohamed Abdu went right to the front in his comeback, then held off 
Peace after they dueled for more than a quarter of a mile. 
</P>
<P>
"That first race back was a very hard race for him," said trainer Richard 
Mulhall. "He cleaned up the night of the race and did everything right. 
</P>
<P>
"The American is just a little quick and that concerns me. I didn't have many 
alternatives for him and the only other race is the Eddie Read Handicap (next 
month at Del Mar). I was also concerned that Hawkster and Peace might go in 
this race because they would add some extra speed. With them not going, it 
helped us to make a firm decision to run." 
</P>
<P>
Although he never looked like a winner in the Inglewood, Classic Fame, who 
finished in front of Steinlen in the John Henry Handicap May 13, was beaten by 
a half-length. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't break too sharp and he was too far back early," trainer Gary Jones 
said. "The fact that he was four wide into the stretch was definitely a factor 
as well. I think we were unlucky to lose, but those other two ran one heck of a 
race. The American's a little quick, but he's training well and I think he's 
got a big shot." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Pico Perdomo also won the third race with Billy Euforico and he has now 
won with five of his 17 starters at Hollywood Park. . . . There was a minus 
show pool of $2,313.13 in the sixth race, won by heavily favored My Prayer, and 
one of $4,798.13 in the Silver Screen. . . . Stalwart Charger's victory was 
worth $91,100 to his owner and pushed his earnings to $310,100. . . . Laffit 
Pincay, Julio Garcia and Kent Desormeaux all rode two winners Sunday.

STEALTH ATTACK: Heeding fears of increased airport noise, Congress last year 
passed a law to assure that commercial carriers couldn't use the El Toro Marine 
Corps Air Station. . . . But that hasn't stopped Federal Express from a second 
quiet attempt to use the base for its cargo jets. At the behest of Sen. Wendell 
H. Ford (D-Ky.), congressional investigators will visit El Toro July 11 to look 
once again into the idea of "joint civil/military use" of the base. . . . Rep. 
Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), author of the El Toro ban, reacted angrily: 
"This is illegal . . . it's certainly a waste of taxpayers' money." Jeffrey A.

IN THE RED: Caltrans says Orange County has the state's two worst cost overruns 
on new highway projects. . . . Topping the list is a section of the Santa Ana 
Freeway widening project, now $127 million over the estimate of $93 million. 
The Santa Ana and Costa Mesa freeways' interchange, now up $54 million over the 
original $46.4 million, holds second place. Delayed land purchases and soaring 
real estate prices get the official blame. Jeffrey A. Perlman and Steve Emmons

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the angry letters and calls started last year, Los Angeles lawyer J. 
Christopher Kennedy said he dismissed them as the misdirected problems of 
another lawyer who happened to share the same name. 
</P>
<P>
But when the complaints kept coming -- from desperate clients and indignant 
lawyers -- Kennedy said he began fearing for his own reputation and for that of 
his law firm, Irell &amp; Manella, which also has offices in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
He then called the State Bar of California and got some sobering news: There 
was just one J. Christopher Kennedy licensed to practice law -- himself. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like something out of a Hitchcock movie," Kennedy said of his yearlong 
ordeal. "It's one of the most bizarre experiences I've ever had." 
</P>
<P>
Today, after months of investigation by the Orange County district attorney's 
office, the man accused of posing as Kennedy is to be arraigned in Municipal 
Court in Newport Beach. Jeffery Biddle Smith of Laguna Beach is accused of 
illegally impersonating a lawyer and of fleecing unsuspecting clients of 
thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who is listed in court documents under nine other names that are 
believed by prosecutors to be aliases, did not respond to telephone messages 
and a letter from The Times, seeking his comment. Smith's most recent known 
defense attorney, who represented him during bail-reduction hearings after his 
arrest in May, declined Friday to speak on Smith's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Records show that Smith, 49, is no stranger to the criminal justice system. His 
longest stint in custody came in the 1970s, when he served five years at the 
state prison in Chino for passing bad checks. 
</P>
<P>
But many of those who became acquainted with him in Orange County during the 
past two years said they knew nothing of that. The man they knew cited his name 
on letterhead stationery as "J. Christopher Kennedy, Esq." He was a charming, 
seemingly well-connected, prosperous lawyer from Newport Beach who possessed a 
literate legal vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
Whether people dealt with him in court or in a judge's chambers, "Chris 
Kennedy" was just as plausible as, well, Arnie Becker, a character on TV's 
"L.A. Law." 
</P>
<P>
"He makes a good impression," said one county public defender who has worked 
with Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the opposing counsel in a post-domestic modification," recalled Santa 
Ana divorce lawyer Richard L. Dombrow, adding that he thought Smith handled 
himself competently last year during appearances in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
But when Smith's client did not begin making increased child and spousal 
support payments, as Superior Court Commissioner Richard G. Vogel had ordered, 
Dombrow tried and failed to contact his legal adversary. 
</P>
<P>
"I wrote a blistering, scathing letter to Mr. Kennedy," Dombrow recalled, "and 
got a stunned phone call back" -- from the real J. Christopher Kennedy, of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy and other lawyers complained anew to State Bar officials, who referred 
them to local law enforcement agencies. The State Bar's enforcement powers 
extend only to people licensed to practice law. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the State Bar and the American Bar Assn. said impersonations of 
lawyers are relatively rare. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a problem that we don't like to see," said David J. Brent, counsel to the 
ABA's standing committee on lawyers' responsibility for client protection. "The 
appropriate thing is to get the victim in touch with (local prosecutors) as 
quickly as possible." 
</P>
<P>
The most expensive crime that Smith stands charged with involves a couple 
formerly of Costa Mesa, Lester and Margaret Armstrong, who allege that they 
were swindled out of $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
To them, it is a sad irony that they were introduced to Smith by another, 
undisputed lawyer: their son-in-law, Lewis W. Clapp. 
</P>
<P>
"I end up being a fool," said Clapp, who for nine years has been an Orange 
County deputy public defender. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very smooth," Clapp said of Smith. "He has a decent vocabulary. He's 
polite. He seemed sort of distinguished. I don't know how else to explain it. 
He's a bright guy." 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong said he hired Smith in 1988 because a dispute was raging over who 
would have to pay for extensive corrosive-soil damage to his house in Costa 
Mesa. When a local contractor hired by his insurance company failed to fix his 
badly buckled foundation, Armstrong said, he saw no alternative to hiring a 
lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Based on his son-in-law's recommendation, Armstrong said, "Chris Kennedy" was 
the man for the job. Armstrong, Clapp and an insurance company attorney said 
they had regarded Smith as a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
"He had me believing he was a bona fide attorney," said Armstrong, 57, who 
manages a transmission shop in La Mirada. "When I found out he wasn't, it 
knocked the wind out of my sails. . . . I paid the man $30,000, I kid you not. 
He could charm a bulldog off a garbage truck." 
</P>
<P>
A document faxed by Smith last July to an attorney involved with the soil 
dispute described the "expert/investigative/professional and legal fees" paid 
to him by Armstrong to be $29,787. A copy of the document was provided to The 
Times by a lawyer familiar with the case. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong, who has since moved elsewhere in the county, said he ultimately 
settled the matter with the insurance company without benefit of an attorney. 
But Armstrong said he wants his $30,000 back from Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Clapp, the son-in-law, said he met Smith in July, 1988, while representing a 
man accused of securities fraud. As he understood it, Clapp said, "Chris 
Kennedy" was hired by the fraud defendant's parents to serve as co-counsel. 
</P>
<P>
Clapp said Smith impressed him with his drafting of "legal documents" and with 
his verbal skills during negotiations in the chambers of a Superior Court 
judge. That judge, Clapp said, was Brian R. Carter, who resigned from the bench 
in February, 1989, during an ethics investigation by the State Commission on 
Judicial Performance. The panel dropped its inquiry after Carter left office. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's acquaintance with Carter is of added interest to investigators because 
Carter represented Smith at the bail hearings in May. 
</P>
<P>
Smith told Clapp in 1988 that Carter "was someone he had socialized with 
previously. He said they had been out to dinner." 
</P>
<P>
Carter said Friday that, during the time he was a judge, he never sought to 
learn Smith's occupation. Carter also said that while a judge, he had 
socialized with Smith two times, which he described as a "luncheon" and a 
"birthday party." 
</P>
<P>
"I think I've known him for about six or eight or 10 years," Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
"When you've lived here as long as I have, you meet a lot of people," he said. 
"You don't necessarily know what they do. . . . He (Smith) knows people who are 
successful business people. And you assume that he's a responsible citizen." 
</P>
<P>
Carter said he had been questioned recently by district attorney's 
investigators about whether he thought that Smith was a lawyer during the 
appearances in 1988 with public defender Clapp. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, in his interview with The Times, at first referred to Smith's 
appearance before him in 1988 and his representation of him in 1990 as "an 
incredible coincidence." 
</P>
<P>
But the former judge then said he had "no recollection of his appearing in my 
court." 
</P>
<P>
As for his recent representation of Smith, Carter said the bail hearings were 
his final appearances on Smith's behalf. Carter sought to have Smith released 
from jail on his own recognizance; the district attorney's office requested 
bail of $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge Calvin P. Schmidt set bail at $20,000, an amount Smith has 
posted. Smith faces a maximum sentence of eight years and eight months, if 
convicted on all charges, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Connie Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
The case's disposition is being watched closely by the Kennedy of Los Angeles 
who, for the record, is 39, got his undergraduate degree from Harvard, his law 
degree from the University of Virginia -- and has never served time in prison. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know with what seriousness the court system will deal with this guy," 
Kennedy said. "I continue to wonder whether my reputation has been adversely 
affected. It's weird stuff. I don't know if it will ever be really over."

QUEEN URGES CANADIANS TO STAY CALM, SETTLE THEIR DIFFERENCES

<P>
Queen Elizabeth II plunged deep into Canada's troubled political waters Sunday 
as she helped Canadians celebrate their national holiday with visits to both 
the English- and French-speaking sides of this bilingual capital city. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not just a fair-weather friend, and I am glad to be here at this 
sensitive time," the queen told a crowd of about 70,000 well-wishers on the 
lawns of the Canadian Parliament building. Switching between English and French 
in her speech, she took the view, dominant in English-speaking Canada, that 
unity should prevail and the country should return to normal. 
</P>
<P>
"Knowing Canadians as well as I do, I cannot believe that they will not be 
able, after a period of calm reflection, to find a way through the present 
period of difficulties," Elizabeth said as the predominantly English-speaking 
crowd cheered and waved thousands of red and white maple-leaf flags. 
</P>
<P>
The enthusiastic welcome was to contrast sharply with the reaction she received 
later in the afternoon, when she crossed the Ottawa River to Hull, the 
capital's sister city in Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
Canada is experiencing a surge of separatist sentiment in the French-speaking 
province of Quebec, and even on the eve of the festivities for Canada Day -- 
this nation's equivalent of America's Independence Day -- Quebec's political 
leaders were meeting to work out a decidedly independent strategy for the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa and Jacques Parizeau, leader of the 
opposition Parti Quebecois, announced that they have set up a nonpartisan 
commission to canvass opinion across Quebec and draw up recommendations for the 
province's future relationship with English Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The two men differed on how the recommendations might be put to use: Parizeau 
advocated using them to write a new constitution for Quebec, while Bourassa 
said they could be the basis for negotiations with the federal government on 
new powers for the province. 
</P>
<P>
Despite those differences, the Bourassa-Parizeau announcement was an 
unprecedented show of unity for the two men, who are archrivals for power in 
Quebec. Bourassa, a federalist, has spent his political career advancing the 
cause of union with English Canada, while Parizeau is a separatist who 
advocates political independence for the province. 
</P>
<P>
Bourassa explained that change has now become necessary. "It is obvious that we 
cannot accept the constitutional status quo," he said. He added that he hopes 
the commission will complete its work by the end of this year so that 
"everything" could be wrapped up by next spring. 
</P>
<P>
Bourassa, a man famous in Canada for the ambiguity of his speeches, did not 
elaborate on what he meant by "everything." 
</P>
<P>
Given these goings-on in Quebec, it had been rumored that Queen Elizabeth, who 
to many Quebecers is a symbol of British imperial conquest, might cancel her 
appearance in the French-speaking province, which had been planned months 
before the feelings of separatism intensified. But she forged on anyway across 
the Ottawa River to French-speaking Hull, Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
For the queen, the trip was a bridge too far. A crowd of disciplined but noisy 
Quebec nationalists lay in wait for her in Hull, eager not so much to boo her 
as to use her visit as a chance to taunt English Canadians. The Francophones, 
lined up on the sidewalk across from a park the queen was scheduled to tour, 
waved blue and white fleur-de-lis flags, brandished placards saying "Our Real 
Country Is Quebec" and sang "Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, hey-ey-ey, goodby," as 
the royal motorcade rolled over the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor of Hull, Michel Legere, boycotted the royal visit, saying the queen 
is not welcome in his city. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth alighted in the midst of the cacophony, smiled at the crowds and then 
swept away from the chanting Quebecers into the park, where she accepted a 
bouquet of flowers from a child and met Canada's 1989 "Maple Leaf Baby," the 
first baby born on Canada Day last year. 
</P>
<P>
Her activities got sharply contrasting marks from English and French Canadian 
onlookers on the opposite sides of the river. 
</P>
<P>
"The queen gave a great speech," said accounting student James Piper, who 
turned out for the events on the Ottawa side. "She reinforced what a lot of 
people believe in, which is a united Canada." 
</P>
<P>
In Hull, Quebecer Normand Lapointe saw it differently. 
</P>
<P>
The British Royal Family "isn't a symbol that we respect very much in Quebec," 
he said. As for the new Bourassa-Parizeau political consultations: "It's just 
beautiful," he said. "The political study that's going on in Quebec should be 
happening in every province. We know what we are, but what are they?"

The ruling Communist Party expelled seven prominent members and warned five 
others about misuse of power under deposed hard-line President Yumjaagiyn 
Tsedenbal.

<P>
The party in April began investigating members for excesses committed under the 
Stalinist regime of Tsedenbal, who ruled from 1952 to 1984.

<P>
Bowing to pressure, the Communist Party in March relinquished its 69-year

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki offered Sunday to meet this week with 
Lech Walesa to ease the bitter political war that has torn the Solidarity 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
An aide to Walesa said the Solidarity chairman is aware of the offer and that 
arrangements for the meeting will probably be announced soon. 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki's peace gesture came at a meeting of local Solidarity citizens 
committees called by his backers in the conflict. Walesa has accused his former 
ally of moving too slowly to implement political and economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Members of citizens committees from around the country met Saturday with Walesa 
and then Sunday with Mazowiecki to discuss what direction the Solidarity union 
movement should take. 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki's backers failed to win enough support to create a nationwide 
federation of citizens committees behind the government. Instead, the issue was 
postponed until a conference July 21. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's meeting passed a resolution urging the Solidarity leader and 
Mazowiecki to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
Taking the floor earlier, Mazowiecki told the local activists meeting in the 
Parliament building that he is always willing to talk with Walesa even though 
he has been attacked by him. 
</P>
<P>
He said he will call Walesa on condition that the conversation would be 
conducted as a "full partnership" and not as Mazowiecki "paying a serf's 
homage." 
</P>
<P>
"I think that certain issues should be toned down," Mazowiecki said. "I am 
proposing to Mr. Walesa to talk this coming week." 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki said they should talk "not to remove all differences between us, 
because that would not be true, but to talk so that disputes and battles 
proceed in a way that does not destroy the common good of Poland and 
Solidarity's legacy." 
</P>
<P>
Asked later, he declined to elaborate on specific topics for discussion. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa aide Krzysztof Pusz, reached at home in Gdansk, said Walesa is aware of 
Mazowiecki's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the details should be worked out this week," Pusz said. 
</P>
<P>
The Walesa and Mazowiecki factions were competing for the allegiance of the 
grass roots during the weekend meetings, and the fight seemed to end in a draw. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates were not enthusiastic about the call from the Mazowiecki faction for 
creating a national federation that would act as a base of support for the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
But in a straw poll Sunday, they also rejected Walesa's proposal that the 
citizens committees be opened to members of other political groups. 
</P>
<P>
The nine-month government has introduced radical economic reforms. But it has 
taken a gradual approach to dismantling the old Communist power structure and 
dismissing Communist holdovers, arguing the alternative would be witch hunts 
and chaos. 
</P>
<P>
The prime minister told the meeting Sunday that there is need for "political 
support for this cause taking place in Poland."

Serbians cast ballots Sunday in a referendum called by the republic's ruling 
Communists, who are attempting to retain power by exploiting rising Serbian 
anger over ethnic Albanian separatism in Kosovo province. 
</P>
<P>
The referendum asks voters in Serbia, the largest of Yugoslavia's six 
republics, to approve a Communist political program that calls for the 
enactment of a new constitution before promised multi-party elections. 
</P>
<P>
The Communists have proposed a constitution that eliminates virtually all 
autonomy for Kosovo, where the 1.7-million-strong ethnic Albanian majority has 
called for independence. The Albanian demand has outraged the rest of Serbia.

POLICE CAR STRIKES, KILLS 3-YEAR-OLD GIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 3-year-old Inglewood girl was struck and killed by a police car late 
Saturday, moments after she let go of her mother's hand and stepped off the 
curb on a South-Central Los Angeles street, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Dominique Spears was thrown more than 120 feet by the impact of the 
black-and-white patrol car in the 900 block of West 64th Street. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the officers were answering a call about shots fired a short 
distance away. Police said they had no information about the shots. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the patrol car was traveling within the 25 m.p.h.-to-30 m.p.h. 
speed limit for the residential street, but some witnesses estimated the 
vehicle was going at least 50 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The two officers inside the patrol car, neither of whom were identified by 
police, tried to resuscitate the dying girl, according to Dessie Henry, a 
neighborhood resident who witnessed the accident. The officers were not injured 
but were severely shaken by the mishap, police said. Both have sought 
counseling from a department psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
Dominique was taken to the Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center where she 
died a short time later, police said.

GANG-PREVENTION AGENCY SHOT DOWN BY LACK OF FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a year when Orange County's gang violence has escalated to a record level, 
one of the county's most respected gang prevention programs has gone out of 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Lack of money forced the 15-year-old Turning Point Family Services Inc. to 
close its doors last week after the agency had spent 3 1/2 years battling gang 
problems in central Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Turning Point had maintained a number of programs to help families and children 
-- among them the Amparo Youth Shelter in Garden Grove for troubled and runaway 
children and teen-agers and an alcohol and drug abuse counseling service. 
</P>
<P>
These will survive by being absorbed by other agencies. But Turning Point's 
well respected gang counseling service will not. 
</P>
<P>
The program provided low-cost individual and group counseling of gang members 
who had been referred by police and probation officials or by residents of 
gang-plagued communities. 
</P>
<P>
"They were really the only game in town for us for that type of service," said 
Colleene Hodges, supervisor of the county Probation Department's gang violence 
suppression unit. 
</P>
<P>
Gus Frias, manager of the county Department of Education's Operation Safe 
Schools program, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very limited in terms of our resources here at the department and any 
help that we could get from them was very welcome. What they did in terms of 
working with schools will be missed." 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Youth and Family Services will take over Amparo Youth Shelter 
and will re-create Turning Point's alcohol and drug abuse counseling program in 
a new location with a fraction of the staff and funding. 
</P>
<P>
But gang counseling, unique to Turning Point, will cease. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never known another agency I could refer to that did counseling for gang 
kids," said counselor Jim Head as he reflected on the program last week in his 
bare office. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just really sad, depressing, there's all these emotions that come from 
seeing something you've worked on all these years go down the drain," Head 
said. "I'm not a pessimist. . . . I'm sure somebody will come up with a 
program, but right now it kind of leaves a void." 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Castillo, 19, was one of the program's success stories. Three and a 
half years ago, she was in juvenile hall, a gang member and heavy drug user. 
</P>
<P>
Working with Head taught her about positive options and helped her turn her 
life around, she said. Last week, Castillo graduated from high school and she 
plans to begin college in the fall. She will study psychology with hopes of 
becoming a gang counselor herself. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's stupid," Castillo said of Turning Point's demise. "A lot of 
people I knew went to Turning Point and they helped them, too. They need that 
place." 
</P>
<P>
Head said that private counseling is too expensive for most youths in gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have insurance," Head said. "Very few people are wealthy enough to 
pay for counseling and we're talking about a population that is at the poverty 
level." 
</P>
<P>
Although Head is out of a job along with more than 30 other Turning Point 
employees, he said his main concern is the youths. 
</P>
<P>
"We were doing a little bit more to eradicate the gang problem," he said. "You 
can't do too much when it comes to this problem because it's pretty monumental. 
. . . There's a lot of kids getting killed and I hate it when I pick up the 
paper and read about some 16-year-old getting blown away in L.A. or Orange 
County or wherever." 
</P>
<P>
Turning Point leaders approached Orange County Youth and Family Services about 
the possibility of a merger early this year. 
</P>
<P>
The idea seemed ideal: Turning Point had plenty of programs and not enough 
funding. Orange County Youth and Family Services, a nonprofit agency that has 
operated "halfway houses" for 15 years, was financially healthy and trying to 
expand its programs. 
</P>
<P>
But attorneys advised that a merger would bring Turning Point's liabilities -- 
its debt and programs that were losing money -- as well as its assets, said 
Kevin Meehan, director of Orange County Youth and Family Services. So a 
decision was made by both groups in May to dissolve Turning Point and absorb 
some of its programs into the other agency. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a shutdown of (Turning Point)," said Dennis Catron, president of 
Turning Point's board of directors. "It's just a change of name." Meanwhile, 
Tony Borbon, the widely respected director of Turning Point's gang prevention 
program, has signed on with CSP (Community Service Program) where he will work 
to create a new gang program.

STREET SMART: FEAR OF FINES: NEW SIGNS CUT CAR-POOL-LANE VIOLATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dear Street Smart Readers: 
</P>
<P>
What's black and white, about two feet across and makes motorists shiver in 
their bucket seats? 
</P>
<P>
Give up? It's one of the new signs on the Costa Mesa Freeway that warn drivers 
about the $246 fine one faces for a car-pool-lane violation. 
</P>
<P>
As innocuous as the signs might have seemed at first, they have helped persuade 
many a scofflaw that steering into the car-pool lane minus a passenger just 
isn't worth the risk. Since the signs went into place about a month ago, 
violation rates on the freeway have plummeted, California Department of 
Transportation officials say. 
</P>
<P>
In the southbound car-pool lane, the violation rate has dropped from about 7% 
in 1988 to 2.5% in recent days, Caltrans officials say. The northbound commuter 
lane has experienced an even greater decline, skidding down from 7.2% in 1988 
to 1.5% now that the signs are in place. 
</P>
<P>
Joe El-Harake, Caltrans' commuter lanes coordinator in Orange County, says the 
reason for the falling violation rates seems clear. 
</P>
<P>
Surveys conducted by Caltrans have indicated that many motorists were not aware 
of the steep fines attached to a car-pool-lane ticket, which can soar to more 
than $600 for three or more violations. The signs, El-Harake says, simply let 
motorists understand the hefty stakes involved with zipping unaccompanied onto 
the restricted strip of pavement. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people are really surprised when they realize just how much money it will 
cost them if they're caught in the car-pool lane," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The signs, financed by the Orange County Transportation Commission, are 
installed at several entrance ramps to the Costa Mesa Freeway. With the sort of 
positive results they have seen, Caltrans officials say the placards could soon 
become fixtures along other car-pool lanes in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
Coming west on Yorba Linda Boulevard and swinging onto the on-ramp to go south 
on the Orange Freeway is very dangerous. You can't tell if the meter is on 
until you are almost at it. And because the ramp is so long and curves, most 
cars have reached such a speed that they can't stop. If they try, they have a 
good chance of being rear-ended. They need a "meter-on" sign just as you turn 
onto the ramp. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Dani 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
Most everyone has been stuck in such a predicament, zooming around a cloverleaf 
trying to gain speed to merge with freeway traffic when -- lo and behold! -- 
there sits a big red signal light at the end of the ramp. 
</P>
<P>
Whoa! Throw on those brakes, Nellie! 
</P>
<P>
Since the middle of 1989, Caltrans has been routinely installing flashing 
"meter-on" signs to warn motorists that they face a signal just ahead. But many 
older on-ramps have yet to be outfitted with these warning devices. Such is the 
case at the Yorba Linda Boulevard ramp. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans officials say they plan to eventually upgrade most freeway on-ramps so 
they include the warning signs, but the work is relatively low on the priority 
list, well below such big-ticket items as widening the Santa Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
If a particular ramp has a bad accident history, the agency will step in and 
install one of the signs, but the Yorba Linda Boulevard on-ramp is not one of 
those cases, according to Caltrans officials. The ramp is free of obstructions 
that might block a motorist's view of the upcoming freeway signal, and the 
cloverleaf is a sharp enough curve that only the truly daring go much faster 
than 30 m.p.h., they say. 
</P>
<P>
But don't give up hope. After hearing of your concerns, a Caltrans official 
said he would order an agency road crew to swivel the upper signal lights so 
that they can be better seen by approaching motorists further up the ramp.

JAIL CROWDING CASE IN COURT AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
DEADLINE: A COURT-IMPOSED DEADLINE HAS PASSED AND THE COUNTY MUST EXPLAIN TO A 
JUDGE WHAT, IF ANYTHING, IT HAS DONE TO SOLVE THE CHRONIC PROBLEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In row upon row of triple-deck bunks barely a few feet apart, inmates packed 
into the downtown San Diego County Jail woke up to another day last week of 
stifling heat. 
</P>
<P>
The one working shower in each dormitory-like block, which houses dozens of 
men, offered some measure of relief. The blaring televisions, tuned to an old 
movie, offered authorized escape. 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers served triple duty. They were there to be read. They served as fans. 
Some inmates had taken individual pages and affixed them to the sides of their 
bunks as makeshift shields from the searing sun pouring through the windows. 
</P>
<P>
That day, as they had for years, according to a county judge, conditions at the 
downtown jail violated the federal Constitution. They were cruel and unusual. 
</P>
<P>
The heat only made things worse. The unresolved problem is simply that too many 
men were, and consistently have been, jammed into the aging facility. 
</P>
<P>
At a court hearing today, another judge, the most recent in a line of judges 
presiding over two major court cases protesting overcrowding at the downtown 
jail and at various other county jails, will decide whether the county has to 
do anything about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we are really getting to the moment of truth," said Betty Wheeler, an 
attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, which brought both suits. 
</P>
<P>
It already has been 10 years since the first judge, ruling in the first suit, 
declared that conditions at the downtown jail were cruel and unusual. 
</P>
<P>
Now the county has seven jails at various sites, all chronically under-funded 
and overcrowded. To avoid a lengthy and costly trial on a second ACLU suit 
challenging conditions at the newer facilities, the county agreed to a 1988 
settlement imposing caps on inmate populations. 
</P>
<P>
The date for complying with those caps was Sunday. The two suits have been 
joined together for a hearing today before the latest judge to consider 
conditions at the jails, El Cajon Superior Court Judge James Malkus. 
</P>
<P>
If the inmate population is not below the caps, Malkus said at a hearing 
earlier this year, he could issue contempt-of-court citations or impose fines 
on county supervisors or on jail officials. Though that is possible, it is 
unlikely, according to lawyers in the case. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing last month, Malkus told the county to be prepared either to put up 
tents to serve as temporary housing or to bus male inmates to jails in 
neighboring counties. 
</P>
<P>
In legal papers filed late Friday, the county said it expected to meet the 
caps. But it admitted that it would do so only through a complex series of 
maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
In part, they include the deportation of certain undocumented immigrants 
convicted of crimes and the addition of bunks at outlying jails for transfers 
from the downtown jail. The county also has made use of a system to exclude 
from the daily count -- on various grounds -- dozens of inmates who assuredly 
are in the jails. 
</P>
<P>
ACLU lawyer Wheeler, meanwhile, claims that all the county has done is engage 
in a number-juggling "shell game" and remains nowhere near true compliance. The 
inmate census fails to comply with a cap imposed on the downtown jail in the 
first suit, meeting instead only a more generous, "temporary" figure allowed by 
Malkus, she contends. 
</P>
<P>
Because it is so desperate for jail space, meanwhile, the county has adopted a 
policy of jailing only felons, while for the most part citing and then allowing 
thousands of alleged misdemeanor offenders to walk free. 
</P>
<P>
At last month's hearing, Malkus ordered that women arrested for misdemeanors be 
cited and released, just as men have been for years. That action raised 
community fears of an increase in prostitution, which Malkus said was 
groundless. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if we comply with the court order, I think conditions . . . (are) 
horrible," said Cmdr. Mel Nichols, who directs the daily operation of the 
jails. 
</P>
<P>
He added in a separate interview, "I would think that after the period of time 
that's been involved that somebody would get serious about resolving this 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1977, an inmate named Henry Hudler at the downtown jail set into 
motion the legal challenges that have led to today's hearing before Malkus. The 
population in what was then the county's only detention facility, built in 
1960, had reached 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Corrections, charged by law with determining how many 
inmates a jail should house, puts the number for the downtown jail at 730. 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU filed suit against the county on Hudler's behalf, alleging a variety 
of ills attributable to overcrowding, including understaffing by deputies and 
lack of inmate access to recreation, visitation and their attorneys, according 
to Alex Landon, the lawyer who brought the suit. 
</P>
<P>
After a seven-month trial, San Diego Superior Court Judge James Focht ruled 
that conditions at the downtown jail violated the federal Constitution's 
prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. He ordered the Sheriff's 
Department to house no more than 750 inmates there. 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU filed the second suit in 1987, again alleging overcrowding, this time 
at the five jails the county had since built. In December, 1988, San Diego 
Superior Court Judge Barbara T. Gamer approved a settlement in that suit under 
which the county agreed to meet certain inmate caps by July 1, 1990 -- 
yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU agreed in May, 1988, to a temporary cap of 1,250 at the downtown jail 
while the Vista jail was being emptied for renovation. At last month's hearing, 
with Vista fully operational, Malkus ordered the downtown cap lowered to 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
The pact called for the cap at the Vista jail to be set at 937. Other caps were 
440 at Descanso, 251 at El Cajon, 373 at Chula Vista and 478 at the Las Colinas 
women's jail in Santee, according to Landon. 
</P>
<P>
The men's jail at Las Colinas is not included in the pact because it was built 
after the 1987 suit was filed. According to jail officials, it currently holds 
nearly 600 inmates, hundreds more than the state board says it should. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the figures set forth in the agreement is also well above the 
recommendation set by the state board. For instance, the board rated the El 
Cajon facility not at 251 inmates but at 120. 
</P>
<P>
The higher figures were designed solely to satisfy the lawsuit's goal of 
meeting bare constitutional minimums -- to avoid cruel and unusual punishment 
for inmates already convicted of crimes and to assure due process to inmates 
awaiting trial, according to Landon, now in private practice but still involved 
with the jail suits. 
</P>
<P>
For months after the December, 1988, settlement agreement, the total 
populations and resultant overcrowding did not significantly improve, according 
to a court document Landon filed earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, he contended in the legal papers, the county has "essentially lost 
control of the jails." 
</P>
<P>
From July, 1988, through January, 1990, the San Diego County Sheriff's 
Department documented 35 "major inmate disturbances," or nearly one every two 
weeks, Landon said in the filing. 
</P>
<P>
Three major fights, each producing injuries to dozens of inmates, have erupted 
so far this year, each at a different jail. Though the brawls have all been 
racially motivated fights between black and Latino inmates, the crowded 
conditions played a part in escalating tensions, sheriff's deputies have said 
after each disturbance. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have massive overcrowding, you have a set of circumstances that 
jeopardizes the safety of the inmates and the safety of (the) staff," Wheeler 
said. "We're not talking at all about providing country club conditions. We're 
talking about providing conditions that result in an acceptable level of safety 
and health." 
</P>
<P>
At last month's hearing before Malkus, on June 11, the jail populations 
exceeded the caps by a total of about 230 inmates. County officials asked 
Malkus to extend the July 1 deadline by three months. 
</P>
<P>
He refused. Instead, calling it an "emergency situation," the judge ordered the 
county to return to court today with a report on the feasibility of either 
busing inmates to other jails in nearby counties or putting up tents for 
temporary housing. 
</P>
<P>
While they worked on the plan, county officials stressed that any long-term 
solution depends on money -- lots more of it. 
</P>
<P>
With more cash, the county would be able to build more jails and have the funds 
to staff them, said Rich Robinson, director of the county's Office of Special 
Projects, which since 1986 has been charged with addressing jail-related 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
A 1,000-bed facility is under construction on East Mesa, near the U.S.-Mexico 
border and seven miles east of I-805. But because the county doesn't have the 
money to operate it, the jail may sit vacant once it is completed in spring of 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
County officials contend the state is to blame for a lack of cash, saying the 
state has grossly underpaid the county in the return of tax revenues, money 
that would go into the county's general fund, which pays for most of the 
criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County ranked 57th among California's 58 counties in fiscal year 1988 
in the return of per capita general revenues, Robinson said, citing figures 
supplied by the state controller's office. It would take $140 million more a 
year just to bring San Diego County up to the average of what the state's other 
counties get, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Funds from Proposition A, the half-cent sales tax county voters approved in 
1988 for new courts and jails, "would go a long way to getting things started," 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition A money is being collected, and is sitting in a bank -- as of June 
19, all $133,382,963.17 of it, Robinson said. But the validity of the measure 
is being weighed by state appellate courts, and a final decision is months or 
years away, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a court document filed late Friday, Deputy County Counsel Nathan 
C. Northup indicated that the county was below the population caps and expected 
by today to still be below the caps. The precise figures were not expected to 
be available until early today. 
</P>
<P>
As for a tent camp, Northup said that course of action is "unavailable" because 
it would cost $4 million annually to staff and run it. And none of the counties 
surrounding San Diego have beds available, Northup reported. 
</P>
<P>
But, Northup said, officials expected to meet the cap -- through a variety of 
methods: 
</P>
<P>
* The downtown jail has fewer than 1,000 inmates, the number Malkus suggested 
last month, but got there by adding bunks to Vista and to Descanso. Northup did 
not refer to the 750 cap originally set in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
* Malkus agreed last month to allow jail officials to exclude from the count 
inmates in medical beds and those awaiting release. Last week, those categories 
included 111 inmates, according to Sheriff's Department figures. 
</P>
<P>
* The county plans to send 30 inmates to county probation camps, Northup said 
in the legal papers. 
</P>
<P>
* It was taking a renewed look at aggressive use of early-release programs, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
* Last Monday, it began using a procedure allowed under state law under which 
certain undocumented aliens can be released to Immigration and Naturalization 
Service authorities if the immigrants agree to voluntarily leave the United 
States, Sheriff's Cmdr. Nichols said. By week's end, 63 immigrants had been 
transferred, Nichols said. 
</P>
<P>
* Malkus' order to cite and release women accused of misdemeanors was having 
"an impact" at Las Colinas, Nichols said. 
</P>
<P>
Before the order, when those women were being booked into the facility, it 
typically housed 520 women, he said. Last Friday, however, officials counted 
451 toward the cap, or 27 under the limit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
ACLU lawyer Wheeler said the various maneuvers might enable the county "to 
temporarily achieve compliance." But she added, "That is an extremely cynical 
definition of compliance." 
</P>
<P>
"The circumstances don't improve for inmates if you gain compliance with the 
population cap simply by not counting some of the inmates who are physically in 
the facility," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, a count under 1,000 but over 750 at the downtown jail "tramples on the 
original court's findings," Wheeler said, referring to Focht's 1980 decision. 
She said she and Landon will "strongly oppose" at today's hearing any move by 
either the county or by Malkus allowing a figure above 750. 
</P>
<P>
The county contends that the only way it could have agreed to reduce the 
downtown population to 750 by July, 1990, was on the assumption the new East 
Mesa jail would be open by Jan. 1, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
But Wheeler said it makes no sense to rely on the East Mesa facility to take up 
slack if there is no money in the budget to run the new jail once it's built. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think (county officials) have given very thorough consideration to 
alternatives to compliance other than the East Mesa facility and their 
continued request to be excused from population caps -- or to be excused from 
the deadline based on a lack of money," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our fervent hope the judge will require them to look beyond those two 
options and to come into compliance." 
</P>
<P>
But she added, "My prediction is that the county is not going to come into 
compliance without a lot of kicking and screaming."

At his peak in 1975, he estimates, he was drinking two cases of beer a day 
chased with sedatives conned out of Navy doctors. And when the bottle was dry, 
he drank mouthwash and watered-down rubbing alcohol -- "anything," he said, "to 
make me feel good." 
</P>
<P>
But the Marine Corps has changed, and so has Perry. With the ranks fast 
becoming the few, the proud and the sober, he has done more than his share to 
reduce substance abuse among his brothers in arms from Okinawa to Quantico, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Perry, 46, who took his last drink more than 15 years ago, is the most senior 
drug and alcohol counselor in the U.S. Department of Defense and helps run one 
of the most vigorous drug and alcohol programs in the military at El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
Since his release from a Navy rehabilitation center, which he entered in a 
straitjacket, Perry has devoted his life to saving the greenest privates and 
toughest Leathernecks from addictions certain to ruin their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of officers and enlisted men have passed through his programs, where 
Perry breaks them of their excesses with the aggressiveness of a drill sergeant 
and the kind of empathy that comes from personal experience. At El Toro and 
elsewhere, he is father to even the hardest cases. 
</P>
<P>
"Perry is highly respected and well-known in the Marine Corps," said Cmdr. 
James B. Calvin, a longtime friend and Navy psychologist who helped treat Perry 
for alcohol addiction in 1975. "He will go after anybody. He'll go for what he 
believes in, and he doesn't care if they have stars on their collar." 
</P>
<P>
Perry, a fast-talking Marine from Billerica, Mass., now supervises the 
counseling of hundreds of Marines a year and oversees the testing of 1,500 
urine samples a month from 17,000 troops at facilities in Tustin, El Toro, Camp 
Pendleton and Yuma, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
The Marines have adopted strict prohibitions against drugs, and those caught 
using drugs generally face dismissal. Drinking has been curtailed by 
restrictions on happy hours, the types of drinks served on bases and 
increasingly severe punishments for drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
Department of Defense statistics show alcohol consumption in the Marine Corps 
has been reduced almost 30% since 1980. Over the last five years, those testing 
positive for drug use at El Toro have dropped from five per 1,000 Marines to 
less than four per 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning, Perry has been part of the improvement and has seen both 
sides of the problem -- first as an alcoholic himself, then as a counselor who 
became instrumental in setting up some of the first substance-abuse programs in 
the Marine Corps. 
</P>
<P>
The product of alcoholic parents and sexual and physical abuse as a child, 
Perry was a textbook case of alcoholism, he said, until a colonel who acted 
more like a father than a Marine ordered him into treatment against his will. 
</P>
<P>
Perry recalls that he started drinking when he was 3 years old, fetching beer 
for his grandfather while he listened to Boston Red Sox games on the radio. 
"I'd take little sips off the bottle as I walked from the kitchen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time I was 17, my drinking was out of hand," Perry recalled. "My 
parents told me I should have never been born. They called me a bum and a 
failure, someone who would never amount to anything. I couldn't even get a date 
because I had cavities across my front teeth. I drank to drown the pain." 
</P>
<P>
Perry enlisted in the Marines at 19 and was assigned to some of the 
hardest-drinking commands from Camp Lejeune, N.C., to Vietnam. In those days, 
happy hours at base clubs offered discounted drinks. Nearby towns seemed to 
have enough bars to slake the thirst of a division. Marines weren't Marines 
unless they were two-fisted drinkers, and the corps tended to look the other 
way as long as troopers weren't derelict in their duties. 
</P>
<P>
Perry's alcoholism peaked in 1975 at Quantico Marine Base, the hub of training 
for the corps. He was arrested nine times for drunken driving and seven times 
for reckless driving in 18 months. Police often found him passed out behind the 
wheel of his parked car. 
</P>
<P>
He was banned from the town of Quantico for writing bad checks, he says, and he 
bought three houses in Virginia under false pretenses. To make matters worse, 
he had remarried when the divorce from his first wife was not complete. 
</P>
<P>
"I just didn't give a damn anymore," Perry said. "My life was dysfunctional. I 
was the adult child of alcoholic parents. I owed everyone. People were looking 
for me all over the world . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Absent without leave, facing possible criminal charges and his body rejecting 
solid food, Perry finally turned himself in to his commanding officer on April 
10, 1975, a date he now recalls with complete clarity. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, he was put in shackles and a straitjacket for an ambulance ride to 
an alcohol treatment center at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland. Withdrawal 
followed. DTs. The shakes. Despite it all, he denied he was an alcoholic for 8 
1/2 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Although he took twice the normal time, Perry successfully completed treatment 
and was reinstated to active duty. A panel of high-ranking officers, however, 
told him that he would never be promoted beyond gunnery sergeant, something he 
has since overcome. 
</P>
<P>
"I came to believe that you have to swallow pride," Perry said, "and when you 
come to grips with it and be honest with yourself, you will get better. But you 
have to keep at it. The day I say I am well altogether is the day you will see 
me back in the street." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Perry is one squared-away Marine. He can see himself in the shine of his 
shoes. His olive-drab pants and khaki shirt are neatly pressed. His haircut is 
regulation high and tight. The only remaining sign of addiction is a pack of 
cigarettes he carries in his left sock. 
</P>
<P>
"Howard is firm but fair," said Master Gunnery Sgt. William E. Colby, who is 
stationed at the Navy Alcohol Rehabilitation Center at Miramar Naval Air 
Station in San Diego. "Howard will give you the shirt off his back, but if he 
thinks you need to be hung up wet, he will. If you need to get hit in the 
middle of your head, he will hit. He is not a man to take lightly." 
</P>
<P>
The alcoholics and drug users he counsels know this, and if they don't, they 
soon find out. Eventually, his colleagues say, he will get them to hang out 
their dirty laundry and willingly admit that they soiled it. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't matter if they are privates or rear admirals, because in treatment, 
Perry says, every Marine is the same and the distinctions of rank and formal 
courtesies he extends to officers under normal circumstances disappear. 
</P>
<P>
"He is particularly good at ripping them apart and getting down to the bone," 
said Maj.-select John A. Thomas, one of Perry's former commanders. "He has to 
be. You know you got a guy with four DUIs in a short time and they don't want 
to say they have a drinking problem. You have to overcome that before you can 
get anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
One of those was Maj. Rock Rhyne, a 20-year veteran now stationed at the Marine 
Corps Logistics Base in Barstow. He first met Perry at a Marine Corps facility 
in Norfolk, Va., in 1979, when a staff sergeant in his command had troubles 
with alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
"He somehow sensed I had a problem too," Rhyne said. "He gave me the 'Big 
Book,' the Alcoholics Anonymous manual. On the front flap, it said 'Love, 
K.I.S.S., Howard.' K.I.S.S. stood for 'Keep it simple, stupid.' My wife saw 
that and wondered, 'Who is this guy?' " 
</P>
<P>
After being transferred to Okinawa in 1982, Rhyne, then a captain, was referred 
by his commanding officer to the alcohol rehabilitation center. His counselor: 
Perry. 
</P>
<P>
"His first words to me were: 'I knew I would see you again,' " Rhyne said. " . 
. . I recall I didn't like him at first. People either love him or hate him. 
But after they get over the first three to four weeks of treatment, they find 
out he cares and doesn't want anything in return. He is probably the most 
inspirational person for me." 
</P>
<P>
In the years since his own release from treatment, Perry has returned to some 
of the bases where he used to drink. But instead of booze, he carries 
substance-abuse brochures and checks into the drug and alcohol rehabilitation 
centers instead of the noncommissioned officers club. 
</P>
<P>
At Quantico, he helped establish a substance-abuse prevention center and the 
first Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. He also volunteered his services to 
Marines who sought help. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983 and 1984, Perry was instrumental in rebuilding the drug and alcohol 
center at New River Marine Corps Air Station in North Carolina, where he 
initiated a family service center and a program for teen-agers. Both projects 
ended up helping about 2,600 Marines a year. 
</P>
<P>
He has handed out scores of toys at Christmas to the children of recovering 
alcoholics, and his speeches about his own battle with booze has moved 
audiences to tears at Marine assemblies and support groups for those in 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"Howard's hours are amazing," Rhyne said. "If there was any incident, 24 hours 
a day, they would call him, and he would be in. When someone got drunk, when 
there was a family dispute, he was there, and he looked after the family, not 
just the Marine. The examples are endless." 
</P>
<P>
Perry helps run El Toro's programs from Building 279, an austere, beige 
structure near the end of a runway where the peace and quiet is routinely 
pierced by the screaming engines of F-18s. His office is filled with awards and 
mementos of his work and life. A sign on the wall says "Sometimes the wrong 
things begin to take control." Above the saying is a picture of a whiskey 
bottle, a glass of wine and a beer mug. 
</P>
<P>
Above his desk, Jesus Christ prays in a painting and an F-4 Phantom jet fighter 
refuels in midair in a photograph. A wooden heart, painted red, hangs on the 
wall, and a plaque says "God, Serenity, Courage, Wisdom." 
</P>
<P>
Other plaques carry unit insignia. There are a U.S. Navy League Award, a 
personal commendation from former Marine Corps commandant P.X. Kelley and a 
photo of Gen. J.A. Studds inscribed "With deepest professional respect." 
</P>
<P>
But Perry keeps his favorite form of appreciation in his cramped quarters on 
the base. "Come on in. I want to show you this," he says, unlocking the door to 
his room. 
</P>
<P>
In a studio apartment not much bigger than a suite at Motel 6 are dozens of 
stuffed bears. They line the headboard of his bed and overpopulate the dresser. 
They sit in his easy chair and poke their heads out of book cases. A couple of 
them bracket two samurai swords cradled in a pair of deer antlers. 
</P>
<P>
There is hardly room left for a few sticks of furniture and half a dozen brown 
grocery bags filled with Perry's collection of glass floats lost from the nets 
of Japanese fishermen off Okinawa. 
</P>
<P>
The bears, some with ribbons that say "Hug Me," are gifts from civilians and 
other Marines he has either helped in treatment or sponsored for Alcoholics 
Anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
In the evening, Perry retires here, surrounded by his stuffed animals. "Every 
night I say a prayer," he said. "I lay my head on the pillow and thank God for 
a most beautiful day, although I might have screwed it up. But I got through it 
without a drink."

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With music tinkling from its loudspeaker, the Mel-O-Dee ice cream truck prowled 
subdivision streets near Avenida de Las Flores. 
</P>
<P>
At the wheel, 33-year-old Jim Case -- a former carpenter now better known as 
the Ice Cream Man -- was scanning the sidewalks for customers and explaining 
what he does. 
</P>
<P>
"It helps if you like kids, of course," Case said with a grin. "And it helps if 
you're still a kid yourself. . . . You have to do a little schmoozing with the 
clientele. You have to relate to them." 
</P>
<P>
It was another hot day in Case's territory -- the fast-growing, new towns of 
eastern Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Ana an hour earlier, as Case loaded his truck with Sno Cones, Slimers, 
Blue Ghosts, Cowabunga Bars and other icy delights, the temperature was in the 
70s. But by early afternoon on this backcountry route, his cab thermometer was 
hitting 90. 
</P>
<P>
It was ice cream weather, Case observed -- but then nearly every day is a good 
day to sell ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
As if to prove his point, a band of children waved at him, and, clutching 
fistfuls of money, ran to his truck. 
</P>
<P>
"Hi, guys," Case said casually. "Whatcha gonna have?" 
</P>
<P>
Eileen Ramirez, 11, asked for a UFO, a circle of vanilla ice cream wedged 
between chocolate cookies that also goes by the name Unidentified Frozen 
Object. Mike Strizik, 12, wheeled up on neon-laced, black roller blades to buy 
that old-time favorite, a Drumstick -- a 75-cent cone laced with 
chocolate-and-peanut topping. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good stuff," Mike observed. "But he (Case) always has good candy, good 
food. Everyone likes the Ice Cream Man." 
</P>
<P>
Ice cream men and women like Case are part of a longstanding American 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Around 1905, someone got the idea of selling ice cream from a horse and cart, 
said Dave Sarin, owner of Santa Ana's Mel-O-Dee Ice Cream, which leases compact 
white trucks to drivers like Case. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, as vendors traded their horse-drawn carts for trucks, ice cream 
sales flourished, Sarin said. A major setback came with the oil crisis of the 
mid-1970s. As fuel prices soared, national firms like the Good Humor Corp. sold 
off their trucks, concentrating instead on making ice cream for the dairy case. 
</P>
<P>
Still, local and regional ice cream vendors have remained. This year, Sarin 
estimated, Orange County boasts perhaps 100 vendors, some leasing the 30 
Mel-O-Dee trucks, others leasing 40 trucks from a rival Santa Ana firm, 
Tropical Ice Cream, and still others driving their own vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The competition is friendly, said Tropical owner Hossein Nabati. "Everybody has 
enough business out there. You go out. The kids are gonna buy. . . . There's 
something about ice cream. When you see it you smile. It brings the kid out of 
you, no matter what your age." 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone is smiling. Leaders in half a dozen Orange County cities have 
declared ice cream trucks a nuisance -- even "a menace." 
</P>
<P>
After a 9-year-old was run over and killed near an ice cream truck, Santa Ana 
officials in 1984 enacted regulations that bar vendors from playing music in 
city limits and require them to carry $1 million in liability insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Other cities have similar restrictions. Yorba Linda, for instance, bans the 
vehicles entirely. And in an effort to cut congestion on narrow streets, a 
Newport Beach ordinance prohibits street sales of any food south of Coast 
Highway -- which includes west Newport and anywhere on the Peninsula, said City 
Atty. Robert Burnham. 
</P>
<P>
The vendors call such ordinances an unfair restriction of their business. 
</P>
<P>
But in new communities such as Rancho Santa Margarita, Robinson Ranch and 
Portola Hills, Case hasn't had to contend with regulations. His biggest 
problem, he said, comes from some of his customers -- the indecisive ones. 
</P>
<P>
After all, to make a living he needs to close sales quickly and move on to the 
next customer, he said. But, "Have you ever tried to get a 5-year-old to hurry 
up?" 
</P>
<P>
Still, he enjoys the children, so he tries be nice when they procrastinate. 
</P>
<P>
"You want 'Um'? " he said patiently that afternoon to a little girl who 
couldn't make up her mind. "I don't have any 'Um.' " When, finally, she settled 
on a "Fun Dip," he helped her count her pennies to get the correct change. 
</P>
<P>
In his three years of selling ice cream here, Case said the subdivisions have 
grown so fast that his route has lengthened considerably. When he began, he 
served four housing tracts and finished his route in 90 minutes. Now it takes 
him six to seven hours. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he knows many customers -- children and their parents -- by their first 
names. 
</P>
<P>
With his shoulder-length blonde hair, sleeveless T-shirt and faded jeans, Case 
admits he doesn't resemble the legendary Good Humor Man. As the old ads 
depicted them, the earlier vendors wore close-cropped black hair and a uniform 
-- crisp white jacket, white pressed pants and a slim black tie. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a little overly formal for this day and age," Case said. 
</P>
<P>
Case also admits something close to sacrilege: He doesn't like ice cream. "No, 
I rarely eat the stuff," he said. He doesn't like all the artificial flavors. 
And "I just don't care for sweets," although occasionally he'll eat a fruit 
bar. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, he enjoys the job. Being the Ice Cream Man, said Case, is "like any 
job. It's got its good points and bad points. But it's kinda neat being like a 
hero to the kids."

POUND ANIMAL SALE FOR UCSD RESEARCH A GROWING ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A growing number of public officials in North County are voicing opposition to 
a policy of the county's Department of Animal Control that allows the sale of 
stray dogs and cats to UC San Diego for medical research. 
</P>
<P>
The city councils of Encinitas, Solana Beach and Carlsbad have rewritten their 
county contracts to oppose the practice -- and have gone so far as to entertain 
the notion of operating their own animal shelters, or contracting with other 
agencies that don't sell animals for medical research. 
</P>
<P>
The cities of Poway, San Marcos and Vista have adopted contractual language 
with the county to make sure they're put on notice if their strays might end up 
at UCSD, but those cities stopped short of threatening specific action if 
animals from their communities are sold to UCSD. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night, the Del Mar City Council will take up the issue. 
</P>
<P>
All this suits Bob Melvin just fine. 
</P>
<P>
Melvin, who lives in Solana Beach, heads the animal rights group called STOP, 
for Stop Taking Our Pets, which is opposed to so-called "pound seizures," or 
the practice by the county of selling strays to UCSD for medical research. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD officials note that the number of dogs and cats they buy from the county 
pounds is relatively small, but meets a critical need in their work. In the 
1988-89 fiscal year, 526 dogs and seven cats were purchased by UCSD -- 1.4% of 
the 39,347 animals taken in by the county during that period. 
</P>
<P>
Melvin has been attending one North County city council meeting after another 
in recent weeks, drumming up opposition to the county policy, and he's finding 
an increasing level of support for his agenda. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, Melvin's campaign is moot. While animals from two other county-run 
animal shelters -- one in Mission Valley, the other in Bonita -- may be 
purchased by UCSD for medical research, none are now taken from the Carlsbad 
animal shelter, which handles the strays and abandoned animals from most of 
North County. (The cities of Oceanside and Escondido have separate contracts 
with their community-based Humane Society shelters for animal control, and 
those organizations do not sell animals to UCSD.) 
</P>
<P>
The county's contract with UCSD allows the university to buy animals from the 
Carlsbad shelter as well, as long as the university gives 60 days' notice of 
its intent to tap the North County stray animal pool. 
</P>
<P>
It's that possibility that sparked Melvin's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no place in laboratories for our pets," he says. "We have an animal 
shelter system supported by the taxpayers that is supposed to humanely take 
care of animals that are lost, stolen or stray. The system has a three-fold 
mission: to reunite pets and their owners, or if it can't, to adopt them out to 
suitable families, and failing those two objectives, to humanely euthanize 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"These shelters, though, were never conceived as warehouses for research 
laboratories." 
</P>
<P>
This is the time of year when 10 of the county's 18 cities renew their annual 
contracts with the county -- and it gives the opportunity for Melvin to argue 
for stronger language in those contracts to protect the animals in those 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
The county's biggest animal control customer is the city of San Diego, which 
has taken no action to object to UCSD's use of pound animals for research. 
</P>
<P>
But elsewhere, the number of cities objecting to the county practice is 
growing. 
</P>
<P>
In Encinitas, Solana Beach and Carlsbad, there's already talk among city 
officials of dropping their contracts with the county to protest the policy of 
allowing sheltered animals to be used for research. 
</P>
<P>
"We already have a contract that tells the county, in so many words, 'You will 
not take our animals for medical research.' And now we're preparing a 
resolution, just to emphasize our point, telling the county to stay the hell 
out of our city if they want to turn our animals over for research," said 
Carlsbad City Councilwoman Ann Kulchin. 
</P>
<P>
"We're giving them fair warning," she said. "We don't want them to think we're 
not taking this seriously." 
</P>
<P>
The Encinitas City Council's contract with the county animal control 
department, approved last Wednesday night, puts three restrictions on the 
county that are intended to make sure no stray cats or dogs from its city are 
sold to UCSD. 
</P>
<P>
The contract states no animals seized in Encinitas can be sold to the 
university, requires that the city be given 60 days' notice if any animals from 
the regional shelter in Carlsbad are to be sold to UCSD, and allows the city to 
terminate its contract with the county with only 30 days' notice. 
</P>
<P>
Since no animals from North County are now taken for medical research, county 
officials had no problem signing the contract. 
</P>
<P>
Encinitas officials already have contacted the North County Humane Society in 
Oceanside to see if it can handle business from Encinitas. Ed Araiza, manager 
of the Humane Society, said his board of directors will consider the request. 
</P>
<P>
Said Encinitas Mayor Pam Slater, "We're not contesting the issue of animal 
research. But we think it's entirely inappropriate for a citizen's pet to be 
impounded and to maybe be turned over to UCSD without that citizen's permission 
just because maybe that person is on vacation, or is ill, or was taken to a 
rest home, and couldn't retrieve his or her animal. That person should feel 
secure that his animal will never end up as a research animal." 
</P>
<P>
Monday night, the Solana Beach City Council -- which already has approved its 
contract with the county that also calls for the 60 days' notice of possible 
pound seizures -- will consider sending a letter to the county formally 
objecting to the policy. 
</P>
<P>
"If our pets are picked up, we want to know where they are, and not where they 
might be -- at UCSD," said Mayor Marion Dodson. 
</P>
<P>
She said she is interested in forming "a coalition with other cities who 
support our position, because there is strength in unity." Such a coalition 
might consider forming a regional animal shelter operated by the member cities, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Some cities outside of North County also oppose the county practice, even 
though their stray dogs and cats may end up in the pound-seizure pool in 
Mission Valley or Bonita. Santee, for instance, asked the county to 
specifically promise that none of its animals would end up at UCSD. But the 
county said it couldn't do that, and that if Santee were going to specifically 
craft a contract prohibiting its animals from ending up in the medical research 
pool, the county simply would not serve Santee. 
</P>
<P>
Santee officials looked elsewhere for animal protection, but couldn't find 
another agency willing to take on the job, said city public information officer 
Bill Adams. Neighboring El Cajon, which operates its own animal control 
department, said it couldn't take on any more work. 
</P>
<P>
Santee officials, resigned to working with the county, nonetheless sent a 
letter earlier this month to the County Board of Supervisors, protesting the 
sale of animals to UCSD. 
</P>
<P>
From July 1, 1989, through the first of this year, the county has sold 174 dogs 
from its Mission Valley and Bonita pounds to UCSD, at $55 each. The university 
can also buy cats, at $25 each. 
</P>
<P>
In comparison, the department handled 22,579 animals during that same time 
period -- of which about 16,000 were euthanized because they were neither 
reclaimed by their owners nor adopted by others. The balance were either 
reclaimed by their owners or adopted out to new owners. 
</P>
<P>
In fiscal year 1988-89, UCSD paid the county about $35,000 for 533 animals that 
were purchased for medical research. 
</P>
<P>
Critics argue that the county is risking losing hundreds of thousands of 
dollars in money paid for animal control by the various cities that contract 
for it, simply to preserve the slight UCSD income. 
</P>
<P>
Encinitas alone, for instance, pays the county about $70,000 for animal 
control. But Sally Hazzard, the animal control officer for the county, notes 
that if a city were to terminate its contract, the county would save that much 
money by reducing its operating costs, which it bills the various cities on a 
an actual cost-incurred basis, determined by the number of calls or animals 
handled in a particular city. 
</P>
<P>
When a stray or abandoned animal is picked up by the county, the shelter holds 
onto it for at least three working days, in case the owner calls for it. After 
that, pound officials determine whether the animal is "adoptable," given its 
characteristics and depending on how many similar animals are in the adoption 
cages. 
</P>
<P>
If the animal is deemed unadoptable and doomed to be destroyed, officials check 
to see whether that particular type of animal -- say, a particular size and sex 
-- is desired by UCSD. If so, the animal is then put in a five-day holding 
cage, where it is given a second chance to be claimed by the owner or adopted. 
If it isn't, the animal is offered to UCSD for purchase. 
</P>
<P>
The contract between the county and UCSD has been in existence since the early 
1960s, said Hazzard. County officials most recently re-evaluated the policy in 
November, 1987, when a citizen advisory panel said there was no reason for the 
county to reconsider the pact with UCSD. The issue never got to the Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart Zola-Morgan, an associate professor of psychiatry at UCSD who chairs the 
university's animal subjects committee, said that importance of university 
access to pound animals cannot be overstated. 
</P>
<P>
The pound seizures, he said, provide a "crucial role" for medical research 
because, at a time of reduced funding for university research, they are less 
expensive than animals that are specially bred for research purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he argues, why breed additional animals for research if suitable 
animals are available locally and are doomed anyway because of pet owners' 
carelessness in controlling their pets? 
</P>
<P>
"You'd be killing two animals instead of just one," he says. "Close to 15 
million animals are put to death every year in pounds around the country. Only 
2% to 3% are used in research. Why aren't the animal protectionists out there 
with education programs about proper care of pets, and with spaying programs?" 
</P>
<P>
The animals taken from the pound are anesthetized before they are subjected 
either to surgical procedures or drugs, Zola-Morgan said. After the procedure, 
most of the animals are killed with an overdose of the same anesthesia -- "the 
same way they would be killed at the pound," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some animals are allowed to recover, to measure the effectiveness of certain 
treatments and procedures, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very defensible and noble cause," he said. "The animals suffer no 
pain and provide us with information that will increase the welfare of humans 
and animals alike." 
</P>
<P>
Melvin, of STOP, said he isn't necessarily opposed to the use of animals in 
medical research -- but that he is intent on stopping medical research on stray 
animals that are picked up by county animal control officers. 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor John MacDonald, whose district includes the North County 
cities that are debating the issue, said he favors the policy, partly because 
"the options those animals face are very limited, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Still, given the controversy, MacDonald said he is considering suggesting a 
ballot measure in November -- either binding or advisory -- that would measure 
public support or opposition to the practice. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very volatile issue, but I'm not sure that there is strong public 
opposition to the policy," he said. "It's something we need to get a handle 
on."

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: NO CHICKEN FEED: KENTUCKY FRIED IS BEHIND IN THE PECKING 
ORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Return of the Colonel. Or: It's hard to keep a good chicken down. 
</P>
<P>
When last we left Kentucky Fried Chicken, the poultry-peddling outlet on Santa 
Fe Drive in Encinitas was voluntarily closing its doors. 
</P>
<P>
A decision had been made by corporate headquarters in Louisville, Ky., to 
surrender the venerable site so nearby Scripps Memorial Hospital could expand. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital vetoed my suggestion that it show its gratitude by dedicating a 
Kentucky Fried Chicken Wing. 
</P>
<P>
For 17 years the Kentucky Fried on Santa Fe Drive had beckoned the hungry and 
tired from Interstate 5 with its big bucket in the sky. Then it was gone, and 
Encinitas was the less. 
</P>
<P>
The buzzword for Encinitas is "affluent." But can a town without Kentucky Fried 
Chicken truly be said to have everything? 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-eight countries (7,945 outlets) have Kentucky Fried, including countries 
where a picture of the current dictator hangs next to that of Colonel Sanders. 
But not Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, an Encinitas planning advisory board will consider a Kentucky Fried 
request to take over the former Long John Silver fish restaurant on El Camino 
Real, a juicy spot between Carl's Jr. and The Wherehouse. 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky Fried hopes to open by the end of August, nearly a year to the day 
since the last buttermilk biscuit was served on Santa Fe Drive. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been trying desperately to find a suitable replacement," said Kentucky 
Fried construction engineer Jack Rose. "We've got to get back in there to 
protect our market." 
</P>
<P>
One spur: the opening last year of an El Pollo Loco on El Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
To make its return, Kentucky Fried will have to make compromises. 
</P>
<P>
The exterior will have to match the surrounding red-tile fake-Spanish motif. 
And forget the outdoor bucket on a pole. 
</P>
<P>
A small price to pay for cultural restoration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Keeping the Lid On 
</P>
<P>
And another thing (or two). 
</P>
<P>
 * Rumor: San Diego City Manager John Lockwood is on the verge of announcing 
his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Truth: Soon, maybe, but not quite yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockwood, 59, says he won't make any decision until after he accompanies a 
Chamber of Commerce trade mission -- at his own expense -- to Eastern Europe in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
He adds that he thought of the manager's job as a five-year capper to his city 
career when he accepted it nearly four years ago: October, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
One piece of evidence that Lockwood is thinking of life after city government 
is that he just bought a Buick Reatta after a dozen years of driving a blah 
city-issued vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
The Reatta is sportier (bucket seats) than a city car and doesn't have any 
restrictions on how far it can be driven from City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
* A pen-and-ink street scene by French Impressionist Camille Pisarro has failed 
to sell at an auction by the San Francisco-Los Angeles auction house 
Butterfield &amp; Butterfield. 
</P>
<P>
Appraisal price was $7,000 to $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
The six-inch-square drawing was once shown at the San Diego Museum of Art. At 
the time, it was owned by Richard T. Silberman. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman's wife, Supervisor Susan Golding, says Silberman told her that he is 
no longer the owner. 
</P>
<P>
Butterfield &amp; Butterfield won't confirm, deny or comment at all about 
current ownership: "The owner was very explicit: 'No publicity.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Advertising Their Losses 
</P>
<P>
Seen and heard. 
</P>
<P>
* A Del Mar couple is posting flyers offering a $500 reward for their lost cat. 
</P>
<P>
The flyers are the work of a San Jose firm that specializes in lost pets: 
Sherlock Bones Inc. Just call 1-800-940-BONES. 
</P>
<P>
* How impoverished are enlisted Marines? 
</P>
<P>
Take that pickup truck in Vista with a Marine Corps decal in the back window. 
</P>
<P>
It also had a bumper sticker: Don't Worry, There's Always Welfare.

LUNG ASSN. FIGHTS UTILITIES MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Citing potential air pollution and health problems, the American Lung Assn. of 
California has joined Oxnard and Simi Valley officials in opposing the merger 
of Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric. 
</P>
<P>
If the merger is approved by the state Public Utilities Commission, Edison will 
increase production at its two power plants in Oxnard while curtailing 
operations at plants in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Edison has promised the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District that it 
will reduce pollutant emissions to levels it says would compensate for 
increases the merger will generate. Those reductions would not begin until 
1996, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In the agreement, Edison officials said they would reduce the level of county 
pollutants in part by replacing internal combustion engines with electric 
motors at the company's plants at Ormond Beach and Mandalay Bay in south 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
But the lung association, in a June 27 letter to Board of Supervisors 
Chairwoman Madge L. Schaefer, said electric motors are "highly profitable" for 
Edison and that the company could profit from the conversion in only two years 
through increased sales of electricity. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the association charged that Edison has already begun a conversion 
program for profit so "the agreement achieves nothing for air quality that 
would not happen anyway." 
</P>
<P>
The lung association called the agreement between the county and Edison 
premature and imprudent. It asked that the Air Pollution Control District 
suspend its agreement until officials examine the merger's potential impact on 
air quality. 
</P>
<P>
The lung association sent a position paper and petition signed by 130 county 
residents to the Public Utilities Commission on Friday. It stated that the 
merger could increase nitrogen oxide emissions in the county and called the 
shift of power generation unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Simi Valley City Council members agreed to send a letter to the 
Public Utilities Commission and the Board of Supervisors stating that the 
merger will threaten the county's air quality. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard officials also have expressed disapproval. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ

SCHOOL BOARD OKS $12.8-MILLION BUDGET 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ojai Unified School District has adopted a $12.8-million budget for the 
next school year. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not cutting programs or staff," said Leo Molitor, assistant 
superintendent of business services. 
</P>
<P>
But he said the district is not painting some of its buildings or repairing 
some roofs because of limited funds. The district had a $12.4-million budget 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
"If we get more money from the state or we get more students than predicted, 
then we could make some changes," Molitor said. 
</P>
<P>
The budget, approved unanimously by the school board, is based on a projected 
enrollment of about 3,350 students. In the 1988-89 school year, enrollment 
increased by 27 students. 
</P>
<P>
The budget includes no pay increase for the district's 141 teachers, although 
the Ojai Federation of Teachers has asked for a 12% pay raise next year. 
Contract talks between the district and teachers union will begin Sept. 17.

SOVIETS GET IDEAS FROM DISNEYLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Armed with video and still cameras, 21 Soviets inched down Disneyland's Main 
Street Sunday, stopping every few steps to take shots of everything from light 
poles and park benches to a marching band. 
</P>
<P>
For this delegation -- mostly architects, artists and designers from the 
republic of Georgia -- Main Street showed them the ultimate slice of Americana. 
With any luck, they hope to borrow the same design and concept for a proposed 
park in Moscow called the Children's Garden of Dreams. For the past week, the 
delegation has been touring amusement parks on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have in our park our Main Street," said architect Michael 
Potskhverashvili, standing on the drawbridge at Sleeping Beauty Castle. "We 
will have America Street and America land." 
</P>
<P>
". . . We want to see all of this," he said. "We want to do the same in 
Moscow." 
</P>
<P>
Although they sampled attractions such as Star Tours and Captain Eo, they spent 
much of their day just watching, listening and remarking to one another. 
Jennifer Faust, the 1990 Disneyland Ambassador to the World, gave them a crash 
course in Disney design. 
</P>
<P>
She explained how Main Street was built to scale, in which floors are built to 
size on the ground level but become gradually smaller on the second, third and 
fourth levels. The illusion gives the buildings "forced perspective," making 
them appear taller than they actually are. 
</P>
<P>
Then she told how Main Street is based on Walt Disney's hometown of Marceline, 
Mo., incorporating the best aspects of small-town America. Faust even pointed 
out, to great interest from the delegation, that the names on the second-floor 
windows are of the original contributors to the park, including the designers 
and architects as well as Disney's own father and attorney. 
</P>
<P>
As Faust spoke, Zurob Tsereteli, a Soviet sculptor who is in charge of the 
Soviet project, waved his arms and pointed to Main Street buildings, telling 
those with cameras to take pictures or to remember what she said. He hugged 
Faust and said, "Fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Soviet project is still in the conceptual stages, planners say it 
will be based on an ecology theme and built on 700 acres on an island on the 
Moscow River. It will include hotels, shops and pavilions, and attractions with 
themes from different countries. The project will be funded through private 
international investors, whose names are being kept secret, and it is scheduled 
to be completed in 1997, said Vladimir Tuchinsky, a Los Angeles businessman 
serving as liaison for the project in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Although the idea for a park dates 30 years, it has only been seriously 
considered recently, Tuchinsky said. 
</P>
<P>
"Only with perestroika and Gorbachev did it become possible to engage foreign 
enterprise and investors," he said. "Before, it was just a dream. With certain 
conditions it might be possible." 
</P>
<P>
As they got farther into the park, architects took notice of other attractions, 
including Tomorrowland and Fantasyland. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is made very clever," said Nougzar Patashouri, referring to the 
fairy tale-like buildings in Fantasyland. "The architecture is very beautiful. 
Small, beautiful houses." 
</P>
<P>
Some members of the delegation took notice of the lack of litter in the park. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is very clean here," said Irakli Gordeli, 26. 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland's long lines, bothersome to many American tourists, went virtually 
unnoticed by the delegation. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm used to it," Nadia Zeegofer said. "It's nothing new for me." TED JOHNSON

COUNTY MAY BUY SERVICE CENTER

<TEXT>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors is considering purchasing an office building in 
Simi Valley that it now leases for county use. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors are expected to vote Tuesday on whether to purchase the 
single-story, 14,400-square-foot Simi Multiservice Center from six private 
owners for $575,000. 
</P>
<P>
The lease contract between the county and the owners gives the county the 
option to buy the building by September. 
</P>
<P>
The building, in the 2000 block of Royal Avenue, houses the county Public 
Social Services Agency's district office, the county Health Care Agency's 
Public Health Services and Alcohol/Drug Abuse services, and a division of the 
county General Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The county pays $9,850 in monthly rent and is responsible for upkeep. Various 
county offices have been housed in the building since it was built in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
The county estimates that the property is worth more than $1 million. KIM KASH

PROPOSALS MAY ALTER TERMS OF OFFICE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council tonight will consider placing 13 amendments to the City 
Charter on the November ballot, one of which would extend the length of the 
mayor's term from two years to four. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed amendment also would limit the mayor to two consecutive terms. 
</P>
<P>
There is currently no limit. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor, formerly appointed by members of the council, has been directly 
elected by the voters since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The council also will consider amendments dealing with the selection and duties 
of the city manager and city attorney. Councilman John Acosta has suggested 
that the hiring and firing of both positions be made possible by a majority 
vote of the seven-member council rather than the current two-thirds 
requirement. The city clerk, the council's third appointed official, can be 
hired or fired by a majority vote. 
</P>
<P>
"This would bring everything into conformity," Acosta said. "About 99% of all 
other council action requires only a majority vote. I think all business of the 
council, except for the appropriation of funds, should be conducted by a 
majority vote." 
</P>
<P>
In February, Acosta and Councilman Richards L. Norton voted not to extend City 
Manager David N. Ream's three-year contract without an evaluation, but they 
were on the losing end of a 5-2 vote. Acosta also unsuccessfully attempted to 
have City Atty. Edward J. Cooper placed on administrative leave in October, 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
Another amendment to be considered by the council would require that the city 
manager, city attorney and city clerk be reviewed and evaluated annually on or 
before their anniversary date. GREG HERNANDEZ

CHANGES TO CITY CODE WOULD REQUIRE FINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Residents who fail to take in their trash containers after pickup day could be 
fined up to $500 if the City Council approves three recommendations of the 
Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The commission last week voted to recommend several changes in the city code 
affecting both residences and businesses and to institute fines for violators. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the city's only recourse to punish violators is to charge them in 
court with misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
City Planner Rick Warsinski said the proposed code changes were the result of 
complaints to the city. The changes include: 
</P>
<P>
* A limit on promotional banners, such as "going out of business" to 30 days 
per business per year. Also, fines would be issued to people with too many 
signs at one location or signs that exceed size limits. 
</P>
<P>
* A ban on lights that glare into neighbors' yards. 
</P>
<P>
Under the code revisions, offenders could be fined up to $100 for the first 
offense, $200 for the second and $500 for the third. 
</P>
<P>
Warsinski said that code-enforcement officers will issue warnings and that the 
fines are an "additional tool" to get people to comply with the city code. 
</P>
<P>
However, Planning Commissioner Jerry Sigler, who voted against the fine system, 
said the code doesn't explicitly require warnings first. 
</P>
<P>
"The way it is written doesn't call for a warning," Sigler said. "This gives 
code-enforcement officers the strong arm. We don't want the city becoming a 
Gestapo-type state." 
</P>
<P>
A public hearing on the proposals is expected in August. LYNDA NATALI

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL;

<P>
CITY BUDGET REFLECTS FINANCIAL STRENGTH 
</P>

<P>
The city adopted its first-ever budget last week, getting off to a healthy 
start with anticipated 1990-91 revenues of $14.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Niguel, the county's 29th city and one of its wealthiest, was formed by 
a landslide vote last November. The first budget calls for expenditures of 
$13.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
The budget includes items that reflect Laguna Niguel's inauguration into 
cityhood: a $400,000 transitional fee to the county, entry signs to the city 
and new furniture and supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Most cities wouldn't envy those expenses. However, the city also boasts a 
burgeoning population and commercial community. The population of what is now 
the city has swollen from 9,000 to 45,000 since 1977, according to Councilman 
James F. Krembas. 
</P>
<P>
Property taxes will be the single biggest contributor to the budget, accounting 
for 21% of the city's revenues, or $4.7 million. Sales taxes will contribute 
$2.2 million, or 10% of the revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Included is $3.4 million owed the Sheriff's Department under contract with the 
city for police services, said Dennis Miura, city finance director. But those 
services were to be assumed by the city as of Sunday, "and we actually have to 
pay for (them) out of the revenues we generate," Miura said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last seven months, the city contracted with the county for building 
and safety inspections, engineering and planning services, and police and fire 
protection, Miura said. In its budget, Laguna Niguel reimburses the county 
$400,000 for those services, in keeping with its agreement with the county 
Local Agency Formation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Other one-time expenses include $150,000 for transition liability insurance; 
$300,000 for the city's preparation of its General Plan, a blueprint for 
commercial and residential construction; $250,000 for a Crown Valley Community 
Park Master Plan, and other money to buy computer equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Capital improvement plans call for various road projects, including repaving 
Camino Capistrano at a cost of $264,000. The city will spend an estimated 
$500,000 on other road projects. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the city plans to spend nearly $900,000 on parks and recreation projects, 
including $416,700 on playground equipment, ball field and other improvements 
at neighborhood parks, and $35,000 for an expansion of the Crown Valley 
Community Park Amphitheatre. MARY ANNE PEREZ

MASSIVE OLIVE-OIL SPILL CLOSES STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Between 3,000 and 5,000 gallons of olive oil from a food processing plant oozed 
into nearby streets Sunday after vandals sabotaged a huge vat, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The oil, which flowed from Van Law Food Products Inc. about 3:50 p.m., forced 
the closure of South Cypress Street between Lambert Road and Imperial Highway 
for several hours. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that someone severed a hose attached to the vat inside the plant 
and then turned on a pump to start the spill. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big mess," said La Habra Police Sgt. Ron Harryman. "A lot of drivers 
were having problems steering their cars." 
</P>
<P>
Police have no suspects or motives in the incident.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles police arrested 66 men during a two-day weekend anti-prostitution 
task force operation in Pacoima and Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
The operation began Friday afternoon on San Fernando Road and Kelowana Street 
in Pacoima, where 36 men were arrested after allegedly soliciting female 
undercover vice officers for sex acts in return for money, Lt. Jim Waters said. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday the operation moved to San Fernando Road and Bleeker Street in 
Sylmar, where 30 more men were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
The men were arrested on suspicion of soliciting prostitution and later 
released. The operation was an attempt to combat a recent increase in 
prostitution in those areas of Pacoima and Sylmar, Waters said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN HELD AFTER CAR CHASE THROUGH YARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man wanted on a felony warrant led a sheriff's deputy on a wild auto chase 
through a Newhall neighborhood Sunday before he struck a telephone pole and was 
arrested, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Collins, 45, was being held without bail after the two-minute chase, 
which began at Lyons Avenue and San Fernando Road about 1 p.m., Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Sgt. Jeff Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Chris Christopher was patrolling near Lyons and San Fernando when he saw 
Collins' car run a red light. He began to chase the car and the two vehicles 
headed south on San Fernando, Thomas said. The chase wound through an alley 
before Collins began driving through the front yards of homes along Walnut 
Street, striking trash cans and parked cars. 
</P>
<P>
The car crashed into a telephone pole at Walnut and 9th Street. Collins was not 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
A handgun was found under the seat of Collins' car. 
</P>
<P>
Collins, an ex-convict, was wanted on a warrant issued by his parole officer. 
Thomas said he did not know why the warrant was issued or on what charges 
Collins had been convicted. He was arrested on suspicion of evading arrest and 
being an ex-convict with a gun.

WOMAN KILLED, 5 INJURED IN VISTA AUTO ACCIDENT

An unidentified woman was killed Saturday night in Vista when a car driven by a 
16-year-old San Marcos girl struck her and threw her about 40 or 50 feet, 
officials said. Another pedestrian, the driver and three passengers in the car 
were also injured. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager was eastbound on East Los Angeles Drive, traveling at least 50 
m.p.h., when she lost control of her convertible, struck two pedestrians and a 
fence, and crashed into a parked car and a light pole, Sheriff's Deputy Mark 
MacGregor said. 
</P>
<P>
The fatally injured woman, who was about age 30, and a companion were standing 
at the curb at about 9:25 p.m., looking for an address, Deputy Coroner Max 
Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
He said she died of a broken neck and skull fractures. She was pronounced dead 
at the scene, officials said. Her female companion, who was also struck, was 
taken to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, where she was listed in serious 
condition Sunday night, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
MacGregor said no identification was found on the pair. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the vehicle had four other passengers in the car. All but one of 
them were ejected from the car. 
</P>
<P>
The driver suffered a broken collar bone and was admitted to Tri-City Medical 
Center in Oceanside. Passenger Judy Luce, 20, of Vista, was also admitted to 
Tri-City. Tina Landers, another passenger, was taken to Scripps in La Jolla, 
where she was in critical condition Sunday night, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
A male passenger, Efrain Orosco, 19, of Vista, did not appear to be injured at 
the scene but later complained of pain, MacGregor said. Another unidentified 
passenger was not injured, he said.

HOUSING: HELPING HABITAT FOR HUMANITY BUILD HOMES IN TIJUANA BROUGHT AMERICANS 
AND THEIR MEXICAN NEIGHBORS TOGETHER IN A COMMON CAUSE.

<P>
Two Sundays ago, I sat on a dusty hillside in Tijuana, facing a temporary stage 
placed at the bottom of the hill. On stage were Los Tenientes, a Mexican 
singing group made up of police lieutenants; the governor of Baja California; 
the mayor of Tijuana, and a former President of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
My roommate and I had just pitched our tent in the village (site 44D) where 
hundreds of volunteers like us would be staying. We had met on the bus ride 
down from Midway Baptist Church in South San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
We were there because of Habitat for Humanity, an organization that has been 
working on what they call "poverty housing" for 14 years now. The group has 
spread to 31 countries, fueled by the power of a profoundly simple idea: 
</P>
<P>
Everyone deserves a decent place to live. 
</P>
<P>
After a few mariachi songs and the official greetings, each work group met at a 
separate part of the camp to divide into house crews. Then, as night began to 
fall, my crew walked together up the hill to the home sites to find House 41. 
</P>
<P>
That may have been the only quiet moment we spent at the work site all week. 
</P>
<P>
It was still dark Monday morning when the announcement came over the bullhorn: 
"It's 5 a.m., time to get up and get to work." Then these obnoxiously cheerful 
people would say something like: "At 5 a.m. in Tijuana, it's 8 a.m. in Ellijay, 
Georgia." As if anyone cared. 
</P>
<P>
The first day, we carried our steel and Styrofoam panels to the house and wired 
them together. We even put most of the rafters up that day. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of the people in the crews didn't know much about construction. 
But the panels, nicknamed "coffee cups and coat hangers," we were building with 
were new to everyone. 
</P>
<P>
As the hours and days passed, we watched our house and many new friendships 
take shape. Lupe, the new homeowner, worked alongside us. Fermin, a friend of 
the family, was strong and full of energy, showing the novices how to throw 
stucco on a wall. 
</P>
<P>
By lunchtime each day, the chair in the dining tent was as refreshing as the 
food. But the conversations at the table gave the week a special atmosphere. 
Everyone seemed easy to talk to, and they wanted to talk. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, you're from San Diego? Which house are you working on? Have you cut out the 
windows yet? Why did you come here? Did you see Jimmy? He was in the food line. 
He was in the shower. He pitched his tent while the media taped and 
photographed him. 
</P>
<P>
(Because everyone I know has asked me, the closest I got to him was Monday 
morning. He was on his way to pick up a wall panel from the stacks of them, and 
so was I. I smiled and said, "Good morning." He looked intent on what he was 
doing. But then he gave me his famous, winning smile and said "Morning" back.) 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy, ex-President of the richest country the world has ever seen but still a 
servant to his fellow man, is the perfect symbol for Habitat for Humanity. Each 
individual is what counts in that organization: 
</P>
<P>
My tentmate, a UC Santa Barbara political science student who filled my ear 
with Christian and philosophical arguments all week. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old from Jacksonville, Fla., who had just graduated from high 
school and learned how to run a cement mixer. 
</P>
<P>
The chairwoman of a packaging firm in Virginia who kept us all supplied with 
stucco and smiles. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy computer whiz from Mare Island naval base in the Bay Area who 
installed the wiring in our house. 
</P>
<P>
I was there, too, an eight-year resident of San Diego who has seen and read 
about the poverty of Tijuana for a long time. Sure, it would take more than one 
week of work to solve that city's problems. But building 100 houses for 100 
families is a realistic, one-step-at-a-time way of helping. Compared to the 
conditions that exist on the other side of our First World-Third World border, 
the sacrifice of a week of vacation time is small. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, there were the Habitat families -- the people of Tijuana, who 
would benefit the most from our hard work. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, after the evening's entertainment in our makeshift 
amphitheater, they gave us a beautiful thank you. It was announced that the 
families had something special for us to see. The stage lights were turned off, 
leaving the audience in darkness. Then, atop the facing hill, a few small 
lights appeared. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 people carrying candles were slowly walking down the hill. 
</P>
<P>
The beauty of the scene was overwhelming. These poor people, who had no things 
of value to give us, wanted to show their appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
As they drew closer, the volunteers got more excited. The candles were used to 
light a bonfire. A song was sung in Spanish. Then, spontaneously, one in 
English -- that old church camp favorite, Kumbaya. 
</P>
<P>
"O, Lord, come by here," never sounded truer than it did that night on a dusty 
hillside in Tijuana.

<P>
A few weeks ago, 15 homeless friends in Santa Ana could have pooled their 
pocket money and they might have come up with 90 cents. A day later it would 
have been $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
That was the amount settled on them for having their belongings confiscated and 
trashed by Santa Ana City park workers 18 months before. The award had been 
wrestled from the city by their lawyers and certified by a federal judge. If 
left each plaintiff with $3,300 plus change. 
</P>
<P>
A sun-shiny ending would have them all using the money to get shelter and find 
work. That hardly any did may suggest to the more thoughtful that homelessness 
in this county is harder and more expensive to cure than it is to recognize, 
predict and prevent. 
</P>
<P>
As you may have read, some of the money went for booze. Some served to test the 
limits of a compulsive gambling habit. If we leap to the conclusion that money 
given the poor is money down the drain, we have to jump over a lot of facts to 
get there. 
</P>
<P>
Legal Aid has paid me to keep track of the 15 claimants through months of 
litigation. I know them and have a curbside acquaintance with hundreds of other 
homeless in central Orange County. So I can state with modest authority that 
they're not itinerant sunbathers. Not one is homeless by choice or unemployed 
by choice. 
</P>
<P>
Many are ill, with chronic and uncared-for maladies. You can't buy back your 
health with $3,300. Others have mental difficulties. Most -- though not all -- 
are feebly educated, and life on the street has aged them past the point where 
they can easily break old habits and learn new things. Some are alcoholic and 
it's surprising more aren't. 
</P>
<P>
In the pharmacopoeia of the sidewalk, liquor plays a dangerous part. It is the 
cheapest medicine you can buy, kills aches and pains for a while, supplies 
warmth, shortens nights made endless by lack of family or television, hardens 
the habit of homelessness and destroys ambition. No arguing that drinking may 
cause homelessness. In my rounds, in four years, I see more evidence that the 
homelessness has caused the drinking. 
</P>
<P>
Total poverty is itself a hard habit to break. One $3,300 recipient discarded 
his worn-out discount clothes and bought a brand-new set of discount clothes. 
Another found herself shelter in a cut-rate motel but wouldn't pop for the 
expense of a room phone. Still another got her hair styled and couldn't think 
of anything else she wanted right then. 
</P>
<P>
Living meal-to-meal engenders a weird kind of negative pride. You get proud of 
not having starved, not having frozen, not getting thrown in jail. It is the 
pride of having survived one more day against heavy odds, but it stuns the 
ability to think past the next meal. A sudden windfall can be a shock to people 
for whom money lost any redemptive meaning. 
</P>
<P>
Especially if the newspapers are looking over your shoulder, wondering if you 
can establish yourself in an affluent society on a windfall of $3,300. 
</P>
<P>
With all the planning in the world, $3,300 doesn't go far in Orange County. It 
is not going to buy you a well-salaried job or a $200,000 house. It's enough to 
get you off the street for three months and back on it again as stony-broke as 
before. 
</P>
<P>
But my newly rich street friends are observant. They've seen more and more of 
their homeless food lines crowded with families who do have shelter and are 
paying so much for it they can't afford groceries. At feedings in Santa Ana and 
Garden Grove the homeless are now a minority, outnumbered by working families 
impoverished by the rent they have to pay. Go see it yourself and understand 
why costly shelter is not an attractive option for people who've learned to 
survive without it. 
</P>
<P>
Homelessness is a deep hole to fall into and a deeper one to climb out of. The 
ones who made the best of the $3,300 claim are those who got their lives more 
or less in shape during 18 months of waiting. They can now afford things (like 
the hair-styling) that are trifles to us and luxuries to them. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana's image makers should be delighted that its homeless population is 
reduced by four. Chuck Daigle took his piece of the $50,000 settlement and got 
a job in Las Vegas. John Close and Sandra Lundnait wrote me a happy letter from 
a $250-a-month apartment in Salt Lake City and say it's the first time they 
ever breathed clean air. 
</P>
<P>
A tall, square-shouldered old man named Bill McInnes was living in the rail 
yard, sleeping on cinders, when the money settlement came through. He bought 
himself a van and left the county with hardly a word to anyone. McInnes is not 
exactly a transient. He was born in Newport Beach 71 years ago, worked all his 
life in the local construction trades, and built a good many of the shelters in 
a county that no longer has shelter for him. I doubt we'll be hearing from 
Bill. 
</P>
<P>
It may be small comfort to lose a human landmark like that, and smaller comfort 
to know that to make it in this abundant county some of us have to leave it.

Moved by the story of a 13-year-old Westminster girl who was raped and her 
bicycle stolen, an Anaheim woman Sunday offered to replace it with her own 
15-speed bike. 
</P>
<P>
The woman asked to remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
"Just tell her somebody loves her," she told police. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster officers got the woman's Schwinn bike, gave it a license and sent 
it to a shop to fix a flat tire and add a pump. They expect to present it to 
the girl today, Lt. Andrew Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
The youngster was attacked Friday afternoon by a man who lured her to a 
secluded area at Warner Intermediate School with a ruse about needing help with 
some puppies, police have said. The rapist then took her new 15-speed mountain 
bike and was last seen heading west on Westminster Avenue near Newland Street. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Hall said the bicycle donor "called out of the blue" Sunday morning after 
reading about the rape. She insisted her name be withheld, even from the 
teen-ager, who was recuperating at home from her ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
"Really and truly, people out there are good," Hall said. "It's people like the 
woman who donated the bike today who make you get up in the morning and do it 
all over again." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators this week will try to put together a composite drawing of the 
rapist, who police said may be responsible for other recent attacks in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities described the attacker as 19 to 20 years old, about 6 feet tall, 
weighing about 175 pounds, with blue eyes and brown hair that was cut short on 
the sides and long on the top. He was wearing blue jeans and a white T-shirt.

PROVOCATIVE INSTALLATION AT LAGUNA ART MUSEUM; 
</P>
<P>
GEORGE STONE'S SYMBOL-LADEN WORK, THOUGH, PROMPTS CIRCULAR THINKING INSTEAD OF

<P>
On the face of it, plunking an art museum down in a shopping mall sounds like a 
way of compounding an already bad situation. Art has never seemed more like a 
commodity than in our era of mind-boggling auction prices and blithely 
art-ignorant collectors chasing flash and dazzle. 
</P>
<P>
There have been times during the six years that the Laguna Art Museum has had 
an outpost at South Coast Plaza that the art on view began to look like just 
another display of consumer goods to acquire in hopes of amusing or impressing 
one's friends. 
</P>
<P>
One way of refusing to collude with the shopping-mall mentality, however, is to 
focus on large-scale installation art outside the collectors' cult of the 
object. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in early 1989 with a show of San Diego artist Mathieu Gregoire's 
peculiar interior-design constructions, museum personnel seem to have begun 
rethinking their approach to survival as an art institution in a world of 
retail stores. The most memorable installation so far was Paul Kos' terse and 
timely "Ber-lin" last winter; the low point was surely Stephen Glassman's vapid 
trio of enormous make-believe beasts last fall. 
</P>
<P>
The gallery's current exhibit -- through Sept. 2 -- is George Stone's "DOUBLE 
CROSS: 1 (picture) 1,000 (words)." In the first room, a cruciform plexiglass 
case holds rows of blank books, their pages blown by a phalanx of small, 
whirring fans. There is also a large color photograph of a flame. 
</P>
<P>
The second room, invisibly partitioned into a cross shape, is dark except for a 
set of prowling spotlights. Each one pauses briefly on one or more of the words 
inscribed on the walls in neat floor-to-ceiling rows. 
</P>
<P>
A reader normally expects that the words of a text will cohere into sentences 
yielding discernable meaning. Similarly, a viewer is likely to assume that the 
words in "DOUBLE CROSS" were chosen according to some rational scheme, and that 
there is a method to the way they are revealed by the movement of the light. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the words were plucked from the dictionary according to a mechanical 
system the artist devised, and the spotlighting appears to be utterly 
arbitrary. So viewers are "double-crossed" by these words, as surely as by the 
empty, fluttering pages of books bereft of information. 
</P>
<P>
That's not to say that the installation as a whole isn't intended to carry a 
message of one sort or another, however. Stone has supplied himself with some 
heavyweight devices -- the cross shape, the flame, the light in the darkness 
and the books -- and clearly he expects a lot of them. 
</P>
<P>
In religious terms, the Word is understood as being the word of God and the 
Book is the Bible. In old-fashioned history texts, the Middle Ages were 
portrayed as the Dark Ages, during which the church kept alight the "flame" of 
knowledge in monasteries where manuscripts were patiently inscribed, read and 
stored in libraries. 
</P>
<P>
As applied to books, the image of the flame also conjures up the image of 
book-burning, the mass torching of books by an official censor during periods 
of conservative backlash, as in Ray Bradbury's science-fiction novel 
"Fahrenheit 451." In the United States today, the impetus for censorship comes 
largely from the religious right. 
</P>
<P>
Viewed in this manner, the actions of preserving and destroying the written 
word -- whether God's word or not -- are both related to aspects of 
Christianity. That's one way to make sense of the double cross shapes in the 
installation. 
</P>
<P>
But what does it mean that the word and the book have parted company in this 
installation? Is Stone saying that words now have a life of their own? That 
we've come to value words too much? After all, his title for the piece affirms 
that "one picture is greater than 1,000 words." 
</P>
<P>
Stone really seems to be addressing the status of contemporary art with this 
phrase. Texts frequently are central to significant works of art today; 
sometimes, there are no images at all. Reams of critical commentary also have 
been printed to explain this frequently hermetic and austere-looking art. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the notion of an image with "pure" sensual power and the idea of 
simply moving paint around on a canvas in pleasing ways have fallen from favor. 
Maybe Stone views this state of affairs as a "double-crossing" of the viewer. 
</P>
<P>
But if this is so, why does his own art rely so heavily on the role of 
interpretation? It's ironic that Stone himself has made more vividly sensory, 
look-at-me work in the past, including a white chair that turned out to be made 
of ice and a wall of thrusting and creaking glass panels in a piece called 
"Fault Line." 
</P>
<P>
It seems more likely that Stone means the title of his new piece to be taken 
ironically. But it is filled with so many symbols -- each dragging its own 
highly charged load of meaning -- and freighted with such a multivalent title 
that, ultimately, his meaning becomes very difficult to puzzle out. 
</P>
<P>
Ambiguity can be an excellent and provocative feature of art. But there is a 
point of meaning-overload that leads to circular thinking instead of insight. 
Still, "DOUBLE CROSS" is nothing if not teasingly provocative. And it certainly 
is refreshing to accuse an artist of packing his work with too many ideas. Too 
often, the problem is precisely the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
 George Stone's installation "DOUBLE CROSS: 1 (picture) 1,000 (words)" remains 
through Sept. 2 at the Laguna Art Museum satellite at South Coast Plaza, 3333 
Bristol St., Suite 1000 (near the Carousel Court), Costa Mesa. Gallery hours 
are 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday, 11 
a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday. Admission is free. Information: (714) 662-3366.

WHAT'S HIS LINE? HE THINKS UP GAME SHOWS FOR TELEVISION ; 
</P>
<P>
ACHIEVEMENT: MARK GOODSON, WHOSE CREDITS INCLUDE 'BEAT THE CLOCK' AND 'FAMILY 
FEUD,' WAS HONORED LAST WEEK AT THE DAYTIME EMMY AWARDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
What ingredients make a good game show? 
</P>
<P>
Don't ask Mark Goodson. Though he created such classics as "Beat the Clock," 
"What's My Line?," "To Tell the Truth," "The Match Game," "Password" and 
"Family Feud," he admits he doesn't have the foggiest notion. 
</P>
<P>
"What are the qualities that make a good sitcom?" he queries. "What makes a 
great song? You have no answer. But people always ask that same question of 
game shows. I guess the real answer is a show that attracts audiences and makes 
them involved." 
</P>
<P>
Goodson's shows have attracted audiences and made them involved for nearly 50 
years, and last week in New York, he received the Governor's Award for Lifetime 
Achievement at the Daytime Emmy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
According to John Leverence, awards director for the Academy of Television Arts 
&amp; Sciences, the award is given to an individual, a company or an 
organization for outstanding achievement of either a cumulative nature or "so 
extraordinary or universal in nature as to be beyond the scope of the awards 
presented in the categories and areas of achievement. Goodson's works are 
nonpareil." 
</P>
<P>
A week before he was to receive the award, Goodson, 75, was relaxing in his 
lush apartment at the Beverly Hills Hotel. "Great games are like great sports," 
he said. "They are very hard to come up with." 
</P>
<P>
So hard, Goodson confesses, that he hasn't had a great idea in a decade. 
"People come in my office, young guys, and they say, 'Give me a hint where to 
go.' I say, 'If I could give you a hint, I would do it myself.' " 
</P>
<P>
Game show ideas, he points out, usually come from nowhere. "I used to be known 
as the 'Man With the Yellow Pad,' " he said. "I would walk along the beach at 
the Hamptons with this yellow pad and say, 'Dear God, give me an idea and a 
place to start.' You look at everything and say 'What will inspire me?' " 
</P>
<P>
The genesis of "What's My Line?" came about at a party where Goodson tried to 
guess what certain guests did for a living. "To Tell the Truth" was based on a 
concept of courtroom cross examination. "Password" grew out of his love of 
charades. 
</P>
<P>
It takes Goodson an average of three years to get a game show on its feet. 
</P>
<P>
"Before we present it to a network, we do run-throughs in the office," he said. 
"I would say that eight times out of 10, a show is never presented at all. By 
the time we present it to a network, we are pretty much convinced it will work. 
Some people present ideas to networks the day after they think of them. They go 
on the air and they haven't really thought them through. These things are 
complicated. It's like a jigsaw puzzle." 
</P>
<P>
The only game show currently on the air that Goodson wishes he created is 
"Wheel of Fortune." 
</P>
<P>
"I think Merv Griffin has done a splendid job of taking a children's game -- 
hangman -- and making it work. Most people don't know hangman was on 20 years 
ago under the title of 'Down You Go.' It failed. Merv has put the idea in a 
great format. Ideas are 20% (of a game show's success), and 80% is how you do 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Hosts are also important to the success of a game show, though Goodson 
maintains that even a great host can't make a weak show fly. 
</P>
<P>
"There are too many people who are top-grade hosts today who have failed," he 
said, "not because they are bad but because the show is. A great show can be 
done with almost any host; however, to make it go from good to great needs a 
great host. There is no formal training ground for emcees as there use to be. 
You can't really go to the Yale Drama School and say, 'I am studying to be a 
game show host.' " 
</P>
<P>
Goodson never planned to be a game show producer. Born in Sacramento, he 
graduated from Stanford University and began his career in 1938 as an 
announcer/newscaster at KCBS radio in San Francisco. Three years later he moved 
to New York, where he produced and directed his own soap opera, "Appointment 
with Life." During World War II, Goodson directed dramatic shows for the 
Treasury Department and wrote and directed the dramatic segments of the "Kate 
Smith Hour." 
</P>
<P>
"I would have loved to have transferred and become a producer of films and TV, 
but that's not how it worked out," said Goodson. 
</P>
<P>
While in New York, Goodson met the man who was to become his partner and 
packager, Bill Todman. "He used to come around and love the shows," Goodson 
recalled. "He was a rich man's son not doing anything." 
</P>
<P>
Todman was interested, though, in selling a game show Goodson had created in 
San Francisco called "Winner Take All." Five years later, CBS bought the 
series. Simultaneously, Goodson developed and sold, with another producer, 
"Can't Stop the Music." 
</P>
<P>
"Both those shows went on together," said Goodson. "At that point, I was in the 
game show business" -- and officially in business with Todman. Their 
Goodson-Todman Productions continued until Todman's death in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Just two years later, in 1950, Goodson developed "What's My Line?" "I suggested 
it to CBS and they said, 'Why don't you give it a shot?' " That series lasted 
17 years in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
"Our shows from 1950 through 1956 were all prime time," he said. "Our first 
daytime show was in 1956. It was an early version of 'The Price Is Right,' 
which we did live on NBC with Bill Cullen. Our basic thrust was prime time, and 
we only went into daytime much later." 
</P>
<P>
Two of Goodson's classic series are returning to daytime TV. "The Match Game" 
begins July 16 on ABC, with Ross Schaefer replacing Gene Rayburn as host. "To 
Tell the Truth" joins the NBC daytime lineup in September with Australian 
Gordon Elliott as emcee. 
</P>
<P>
Besides a new host, "Match Game" is substantially altered. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been sped up, tightened, changed and new elements put into it," said 
Goodson. "It's not possible to change 'To Tell the Truth' too much. We try to 
give it a little more pace, but you can't change a waltz into rock music. Who 
knows whether it will work or not in 1990? It's hard to tell what is going to 
work any day."

THERAPISTS USE BIBLE AND PSYCHOLOGY ON TALK SHOW; 
</P>
<P>
RADIO: 'JOURNEY OF THE HEART' JOINS THE RECENT AND CONTROVERSIAL MOVEMENT THAT 
BRINGS TOGETHER FREUD AND THE SCRIPTURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In many regards, "Journey of the Heart" is like other radio psychology shows. 
Peter Robbins and Kevin Downing, the hosts, begin each program by discussing 
topics such as depression, child abuse and alcoholism. After that, they take 
calls from listeners. 
</P>
<P>
But Robbins and Downing differ fundamentally from broadcast therapists such as 
KABC's David Viscott or KFI's Barbara de Angelis. The two men discuss 
psychological problems in terms of Freud and the Bible. Halfway through a 
recent show, Robbins states that child abuse is Satan's strategy to keep 
youngsters from coming to know the Lord. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to blend the art of psychology with the philosophy of Christianity," 
said Robbins, an ordained minister with a Ph.D. in psychology from Cambridge 
Graduate School of Psychology in Los Angeles. "There are plenty of tools of 
psychology that are consistent with the Scriptures." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone in the Christian community agrees. "Journey of the Heart," which 
airs from 5 to 6 p.m. every Sunday on KKLA (99.5-FM), is the latest in a recent 
spate of local and nationally syndicated radio shows that deal in Christian 
psychology. Many Christians accept a judicious mix of behavioral science and 
Scripture, but fundamentalists and others equate psychology with a wrongful 
attempt by man to assume the duties of God. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a long debate going back to the days of Freud and Jung," said Mary 
Garascia, an assistant professor of theology at Loyola Marymount University. 
"The conservative theologians find the use of psychology obnoxious. They see it 
as being much too much anthropomorphic." 
</P>
<P>
Yet call-in psychology shows have met growing acceptance on Christian radio 
over the last five years, according to National Religious Broadcasters, a New 
Jersey-based trade association. KKLA, a Christian station in North Hollywood, 
carries five such shows, including the well-known "Minirth-Meier Clinic," which 
is syndicated to hundreds of stations nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Downing, a licensed marriage and family counselor, says Christian therapy -- 
Jung delivered with a religious twist -- differs in important ways from secular 
counseling. A Christian therapist will advise a married couple to separate only 
if the relationship is abusive or if divorce appears unavoidable. A Christian 
therapist will likely suggest prayer to accompany behavior modification. 
</P>
<P>
During a program on "Sexual Addiction: The Unquenchable Lust," Downing told 
listeners, "Through all the shame and through all the isolation, Christ really 
loves the person who is in this addictive process. He's not put off by it. He's 
not embarrassed by it." 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't blow the Lord away," Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the show, a woman called to say that she was trying to end a lesbian 
affair. "I know it's wrong because God forbids that kind of relationship," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad you see that," Downing said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a real tough area," Robbins said. "We deal with a lot of people who 
are homosexuals and want to restrain from those behaviors because of their 
Christian beliefs. I would really encourage you to get in with" a therapist 
"who works with people who have your kinds of struggles." 
</P>
<P>
Robbins and Downing asked the woman about her past. She said she'd been 
molested by her mother's boyfriend many years ago and has since had a series of 
unsatisfying relationships with men. The therapists repeated that she should 
seek counseling. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to thank you for your call," Robbins said. "And we'll be praying for 
you." 
</P>
<P>
Robbins began doing such work at his father-in-law's La Habra church. In 1983, 
he and Downing opened a nonprofit counseling service in Diamond Bar. They saw a 
need that was going unmet in the Christian community. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to seminary, and I know that the training for pastoral counseling is 
minimal," Robbins said. "If you have a pastor who is talking to a lady with an 
eating disorder, it's very unlikely that eating disorders were handled in 
seminary training." 
</P>
<P>
There was, and still is, opposition to what Robbins and Downing do. 
</P>
<P>
"Some ministers are afraid that we are bringing a philosophy that undermines 
the church," Robbins said. "They tell their people, 'well, you just have to 
pray.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Some ministers refer their people to us with great joy because they realize 
that their training is inadequate." 
</P>
<P>
Robbins and Downing met with KKLA management last year to talk about doing a 
weekly show. The station decided to add the Diamond Bar therapists to its 
line-up and "Journey of the Heart" has drawn numerous calls each week from 
listeners. 
</P>
<P>
"They add a different flavor -- a little more pastoral, not just clinical 
counseling," said station manager Dennis Worden of Robbins and Downing. "They 
are able to share the Gospel as well as doing the psychological work at hand."

TEARING DOWN WALLS IN A FEARFUL WORLD; 
</P>
<P>
STAGE: KEITH REDDIN'S NEW PLAY, 'LIFE DURING WARTIME,' TAKES A LOOK AT THE 
MORAL IMPLICATIONS OF SELLING TERROR FOR A LIVING. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Little did anyone guess that sweet, ruddy-cheeked Barnaby Tucker, whose biggest 
fantasy was to kiss a girl once before he died in Thornton Wilder's "The 
Matchmaker," was dreaming of war and nuclear destruction on his days off. 
</P>
<P>
That was in 1987 when the La Jolla Playhouse cast actor-playwright Keith Reddin 
in the role. 
</P>
<P>
Reddin is no Barnaby Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old has written about such politically charged fare as the Korean 
War ("Life and Limb"), the Cuban missile crisis ("Rum and Coke"), life in the 
United States versus life in the Soviet Union ("Highest Standard of Living") 
and the bankers-traders-dealers ("Big Time"). 
</P>
<P>
Reddin's latest work, "Life During Wartime," will have its premiere at the La 
Jolla Playhouse's Warren Theatre through July 29. 
</P>
<P>
Reddin made his first indelible impression as a playwright in San Diego when 
his "Nebraska" had its premiere last year at the La Jolla Playhouse. In that 
play, Reddin took a dark, intense look at what life at the bottom of a missile 
silo may be like for the men who keep watch over the fatal buttons. 
</P>
<P>
It was not a pretty picture, but it was a critically acclaimed one that won 
Reddin an award for the best new play from the San Diego Critics Circle. 
"Nebraska" has just completed a run at the Magic Theatre in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"Life During Wartime" tackles another contemporary and, for Reddin, morally 
loaded subject: home security systems. In the play, a young salesman wants to 
make it as a home-security salesman and learns in the process that what he is 
selling is fear. As Reddin put it in a conversation in the Mandell Weiss 
Theatre, the question the salesman tackles is: "How do you protect yourself in 
this world that seems so chaotic without building walls so that you're cut off 
from the entire world?" 
</P>
<P>
"It's about making connections," explained Reddin, who, for the record, does 
not have a home-security system and does not intend to get one. 
</P>
<P>
"He's selling these systems which are about how to keep out a world that's 
violent and crazy. At the same time, he's falling in love and trying to break 
down walls." 
</P>
<P>
It's also a very different play from "Nebraska," Reddin said. Where "Nebraska" 
was realistic, with a claustrophobic air to match the explosive feelings of the 
men in the silos, "Life During Wartime" is fanciful and expansive. There is 
even a scene in which John Calvin, the 16th-Century religious philosopher, 
waltzes in to talk to the audience about free will and original sin. 
</P>
<P>
Breaking theatrical walls is in keeping with the theme of the play, which is 
about building up and breaking down walls between people. Reddin confessed that 
some of the ideas he got for doing this may have come right out of -- of all 
things -- "The Matchmaker," where Wilder, playfully moves his actors from 
within the action of the play to the edge of the stage where they address the 
audience directly. 
</P>
<P>
And then, too, there is an innocence to the young salesman that Reddin -- who 
may be just a little bit Barnaby-like after all -- relates to. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to fall in love and have a family," the still single Reddin said. "I 
don't want to give myself up to paranoia and insecurity and see the world as a 
scary place." 
</P>
<P>
He grew up in New Jersey and attended Northwestern University as an 
undergraduate and studied playwrighting at the Yale Drama School. He would have 
preferred to go into the drama school as an actor, but being afraid that it was 
too hard to go into, he wrote a play. 
</P>
<P>
Still, his first move after graduation was to go to New York, where he became . 
. . an actor. It is in the last six years that he has written a play every 
year. That may seem a big deal to some, but not to Reddin. 
</P>
<P>
"People think I write a lot because I write a play every year," he said with a 
shrug. "It's a couple of months of writing and then a couple of months of 
acting." 
</P>
<P>
His most recent acting stints are in the movies. He has the role of a Rolling 
Stone reporter in Oliver Stone's upcoming film "The Doors," about rock star Jim 
Morrison and that of a Harvard Law student in the film "Reversal of Fortune," a 
story about Claus von Bulow starring Jeremy Irons and Glenn Close. 
</P>
<P>
And the writing continues. 
</P>
<P>
Fluency in Russian, which he studied in college, inspired him to write "Highest 
Standard of Living" and translate "The Russian Teacher," a story about a doctor 
who illegally rents out hospital beds near a seaside resort by Soviet 
playwright Alexander Buravsky. 
</P>
<P>
South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa will present the premiere of "The Russian 
Teacher" March 12 through April 14, 1991, at its Second Stage. 
</P>
<P>
Reddin has been produced at America's finest regional theaters including the 
Yale Repertory Theatre, the New York Shakespeare Festival, the American 
Repertory Theatre, the Goodman Theatre as well as the Eugene O'Neill 
Playwrights Conference and American Playhouse. And "Life During Wartime" is 
already scheduled for its next production, at the Berkeley Repertory Theatre in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
But he doesn't take anything for granted. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time you write a new play, it's like the first play and it's judged on 
its own merits," said Reddin. "It never seems to get easier. It's just a matter 
of learning to listen to your own voice and having confidence in what I have to 
say and the way I say it. Finding your voice and your style is something I'm 
still trying to do. I don't have a formula. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like Nebraska was good, but I didn't want to write the same thing in 
'Life During Wartime.' 
</P>
<P>
"I want to make sure that I'm not too comfortable or too safe. I want to dive 
into the world. I want to experience things. This play is about diving in and 
taking chances." 
</P>

Tucked away in one of Tokyo's most fashionable neighborhoods, a house thinks, 
senses and acts on its own. 
</P>
<P>
It can tell when to snap on the lights by sensing your body heat. It knows when 
to open the windows, air-condition the room and water the plants. It will flush 
the toilet, flip on the faucet and air-dry your hands, all without human help. 
</P>
<P>
If the phone rings, it mutes the stereo. If you want to cook a French meal, it 
will set the correct oven temperature after presenting a recipe and how-to 
video on a kitchen monitor.

<P>
The Jetsons haven't come to Japan. This is the TRON house, a fully intelligent 
home where hundreds of electronic brains work together like a squadron of 
invisible servants. The $6.7-million experimental home is the showpiece for a 
far-ranging project between Japanese industry and academia that ultimately aims 
to link millions of microprocessors in consumer appliances, business machines, 
industrial systems and telecommunications networks in one giant, cooperative 
web. 
</P>
<P>
To many Japanese, the TRON house offers an intriguing glimpse at what the 
nation can produce when it combines a creative vision with its technological 
strengths and love of practical gadgetry. TRON, or "The Real-Time Operating 
System Nucleus," also represents the nation's first creative breakaway from the 
dominant standards of U.S. companies such as International Business Machines 
Corp. and Intel Corp. Japanese electronics firms have generally incorporated 
those U.S. standards in their machines -- paying fees for the privilege -- but 
they are aiming to develop their own independent standards for software and 
computer chips through TRON. 
</P>
<P>
"Japan's computer industry has been copying the U.S. for over 40 years. Just 
copying. No original creations," said Kazuhiko Nishi, founder of one of Japan's 
largest software firms, ASCII Inc. "TRON is the first to be creative." 
</P>
<P>
But the TRON project also illustrates the controversy that Japan may face as it 
strives to develop its own technologies through more creative science and 
engineering. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the question of whether anyone would want to live in such a house -- 
it brings to mind Charlie Chaplin's "Modern Times" -- some Americans are 
suspicious of TRON for reasons that go beyond lifestyle. They see it as an 
ominous Japanese attempt to end U.S. dominance in 32-bit microprocessors, which 
are the computer's brains, and in operating systems, the set of instructions 
that tell the software how to behave. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese don't want to say it, but they were hoping to displace Intel and 
Motorola for 32-bit microprocessors," said Sheridan Tatsuno, head of 
NeoConcepts, a high-tech research firm in Fremont, Calif. He added that 
Hitachi, Fujitsu and Mitsubishi Electric were each devoting 100 researchers to 
developing computer chips based on TRON specifications. 
</P>
<P>
Another U.S. concern is that the TRON standards will compete with UNIX or 
MS-DOS, two U.S. operating systems that dominate today's "open architecture" 
standards. At present, the world computer industry is trying to create 
universal standards for computers, thereby solving the major problem of 
incompatibility between systems. TRON's creator, University of Tokyo professor 
Ken Sakamura, has challenged Japanese computer giants to champion their own 
standard, rather than passively follow U.S. designs. 
</P>
<P>
"Japan is an economic superpower and must act the part. A heavyweight contender 
must be prepared to slug it out for the title," Sakamura wrote last July in a 
Japanese newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse, the U.S. Trade Representative's office singled out TRON 
as a potential market barrier. U.S. trade officials feared that the Japanese 
Ministry of Education would require 700,000 school computers to be based on 
TRON specifications, which would favor Japanese manufacturers, rather than 
general criteria that more foreign bidders could meet. Another concern was that 
Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone would likewise require TRON specifications for 
its operating system. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few U.S. firms, such as IBM and WordStar of Novato, Calif., have 
developed hardware and software based on TRON standards. As a result, some 
Americans fear that TRON is a Japanese ploy to use domestic standards to limit 
foreign competition, which has occurred in the past on U.S. products ranging 
from baseball bats to skiing equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. software industry group, ADAPSO, concluded in a 1989 report on 
Japanese software that TRON had "strong undertones of nationalism and will have 
the practical effect of impeding foreign penetration of the Japanese market." 
</P>
<P>
But Sakamura said his project has been widely misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
"TRON is not a plot to conquer the world," he said during a speech in Tokyo 
last year. "In the current climate of trade friction, anything new and Japanese 
is immediately considered an economic threat by people in other countries." 
</P>
<P>
Sakamura described his creation as the world's first total computer 
architecture -- that is, the first integrated system of hardware and software 
capable of linking millions of computers in everything from rice cookers to 
satellite systems. Although smart houses and other "intelligent" products exist 
in the United States and elsewhere, Sakamura's project is distinguished by its 
extensive scope. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo professor of information science said a single TRON standard would 
unify the world's computer market, giving Western firms an equal chance to 
compete in Japan. All of the hardware and software blueprints are publicly 
available for the cost of membership in the TRON Assn. Annual fees range from 
about $23,000 a year down to $4,600. Among TRON's 147 members, 17 are foreign, 
including Motorola, Intel, IBM, Apple Computer and Texas Instruments. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a competitive system, yeah, but we've never been against competition," 
said IBM spokesman Mac Jeffery. "We got involved because we saw the possibility 
that there would be a market for TRON products, and we wanted to be part of 
it." Unlike the general observer status taken by other foreign firms, IBM 
submitted a prototype workstation for the school computers project and is also 
participating in a communications system. 
</P>
<P>
Sakamura also claimed that the system, which incorporates automatic translation 
capabilities, would lay the groundwork for unprecedented global communication. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of just paying attention to supercomputers or artificial intelligence, 
which are popular topics, I wanted a project that deals with the 
computerization of society directly," Sakamura said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"While computer technology is being applied in more and more areas of our 
lives, and household facilities and appliances are becoming ever more 
sophisticated, many people feel utterly bewildered by the rapid pace and 
increasing complexity of technological progress," he said. "What we need is not 
a random collection of gadgets, but a total system anyone can master." 
</P>
<P>
Figures on total TRON spending, composed exclusively of private funds, are not 
available. A Hitachi spokesman said the firm had spent $66 million on TRON chip 
development so far and hoped to win a 25% share of the TRON-based market for 
32-bit microprocessors by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
A source at another Japanese firm would not give spending figures but said 
IBM's dominance worldwide and NEC Corp.'s near-monopoly of Japan's personal 
computer market were "prime motivators" for its participation in the TRON 
project. "Read this as a desire to compete with the big guys," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
Should Japanese computer users switch to the TRON standard, it could mean big 
losses for American competitors. But few envision that scenario. Tatsuno 
predicted that it will be "almost impossible" for TRON to knock out UNIX or 
MS-DOS as a standard operating system in the business machines market. He 
speculated, however, that it would make its mark in home electronics and 
automobiles because the Japanese dominate both markets. 
</P>
<P>
Microsoft is confident it can retain its 65% market share of PC operating 
systems in Japan, said Ron Hosogi, a company director. 
</P>
<P>
Other Americans flatly predict that TRON will flop in the market. 
</P>
<P>
"The TRON house looks to me like an electronic whiz kid's dream. It's like the 
1938 World's Fair vision of the future," said Gib Hoxie, a senior consultant 
with the Los Angeles office of Arthur D. Little, a technology consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
He said consumers are already disgruntled with digital videocassette recorders 
and microwave ovens. They find dials easier to use and are moving toward them 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"TRON isn't addressing that at all. They say, 'Let's pull all of this together 
in a universal digital interface.' That's a nightmare to me. It means I can't 
run anything in my house," Hoxie said. After some research last fall, he 
concluded that TRON "would be of no lasting significance" in the computer 
market, and he no longer follows it closely. 
</P>
<P>
International controversies aside, the TRON house has been a big hit since 
opening in December. On one drizzly day, about a dozen people gawked their way 
through the tour, shaking their heads and smiling over the house's endless 
surprises. 
</P>
<P>
Take the toilet. It measures your blood pressure and analyzes your urine. Then 
it records the information in your computerized medical records. 
</P>
<P>
How about the roof? Weather sensors constantly measure the outdoor temperature, 
humidity, air pressure, wind velocity, wind direction, rain and light. Then the 
system opens the windows to pleasant breezes or closes them and turns on the 
air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the house uses 1,000 microprocessors. There are 20 telephones, 
including a waterproof phone for the bathroom and a "no-contact" phone in the 
toilet. The home computer features an innovative keyboard conforming to the 
human hand to avoid strain. And, in what the brochure bills as an "audiophile's 
dream," every room boasts speakers and switches that can change the music from 
stereo sound to amplified music mimicking a concert hall. 
</P>
<P>
Built in collaboration with 18 firms, such as Nippon Homes and Mitsubishi 
Electric, the home is stunningly designed in natural materials: blonde Japanese 
oak, tatami (straw mats), rice paper screens, marble and stone. A traditional 
Japanese tatami sitting room contrasts with a high-tech kitchen floored in 
marble. 
</P>
<P>
Sakamura, meanwhile, is hard at work on an intelligent car, an intelligent city 
and a 12-story, $35-million intelligent office incorporating more than 10,000 
microcomputers set to open next year. 
</P>
<P>
"What motivates me is the delight I feel in creating new things, and the sense 
of wonder which I feel when I see something new or something wonderful," 
Sakamura said. "In the end, the results of the current TRON activities will be 
accepted. I am quite sure of this."

U.S. TAKING LONG LOOK AT SEMI-GAS DEAL; 
</P>
<P>
SEMICONDUCTORS: THE SMALL SILICON VALLEY FIRM MAKES SYSTEMS CRUCIAL FOR 
ADVANCED COMPUTER CHIPS, AND NOBODY DOES IT BETTER. NOW THE JAPANESE WANT TO 
BUY THE PLACE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Andrew K. Lorenz is retiring this week, a concession not so much to the years 
-- he's only 53 -- as to the energies used up in starting, building and selling 
three companies in Silicon Valley. 
</P>
<P>
For the past two years, Lorenz has been running Semi-Gas Systems in San Jose 
for its current owner and anticipating his halcyon days. "I planned to take 
what's left, take my wife and go sailing," Lorenz said last week, as his ties 
to the company that he founded were coming to an end. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Lorenz is torn about leaving, caught up in the controversy surrounding the 
proposed sale of Semi-Gas to a Japanese competitor. 
</P>
<P>
The $23-million deal between Hercules Corp. of Wilmington, Del., and would-be 
owner Nippon-Sanso of Tokyo has been put on hold by U.S. government reviews. 
Meanwhile, vocal opponents are looking for ways to scuttle the sale. 
</P>
<P>
The deal is just a speck in the overall picture of foreign acquisition of U.S. 
companies but is significant because of Semi-Gas' role in the U.S. 
semiconductor industry. 
</P>
<P>
Semi-Gas is a leading maker of gas-handling and purification systems -- large, 
expensive chambers and complex controls used in making computer chips. Those 
who want to block its sale warn that too much of the U.S. semiconductor 
industry's infrastructure is passing into foreign hands, jeopardizing American 
efforts to regain leadership and sacrificing the long-term economic and 
security benefits that a healthy chip industry brings. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very concerned; our strategic materials base is being bought out lock, 
stock and barrel," said Peggy Haggerty, an industry lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
Such concerns have prompted the federal interagency Committee on Foreign 
Investment in the United States to review the sale. Although it can recommend 
Cabinet-level discussion or presidential action, the committee on its own has 
no power to stop the deal. The Antitrust Division of the Justice Department 
does, however, and it is continuing a protracted review of the proposed sale. 
Meanwhile, opponents are lobbying, testifying before Congress and even applying 
behind-the-scenes pressure on Nippon-Sanso, hoping to generate the kind of heat 
that helped drive off Fujitsu three years ago when it wanted to buy U.S. 
semiconductor pioneer Fairchild. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is, when there's a critical item or a critical industry that has 
national security implications, is it wise to have (it) controlled by a foreign 
producer?" said Clyde Prestowitz, president of the Economic Strategy Institute, 
a Washington think tank. And, said Prestowitz, "the debate is over America's 
wealth-producing capacity in the future and over America's independence of 
action." 
</P>
<P>
Prestowitz, a former U.S. trade negotiator, has been quietly advising Semi-Gas 
employees who are working against the sale. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenz founded the company in 1980. In 1983, when he needed more venture 
capital, he sold 20% to Hercules. He also gave Hercules an option to purchase 
the remainder of Semi-Gas within five years -- an option Lorenz admits he never 
thought the larger company, which makes graphite and carbon fibers and food and 
fragrance additives, would exercise. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, many others in the wide array of companies that supply 
chip-making materials and equipment had found their "patient" money, even new 
parent firms, across the Pacific. And because their fortunes were tied to those 
of the chip makers, the suppliers increasingly went to Asia for customers. U.S. 
dominance of the global market had faded. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-1988, when Hercules bought Semi-Gas, it was profitable and the leader in 
its market. That made it the perfect choice, a few months later, to supply the 
gas-purification and management systems for Sematech, the industry- and 
government-supported consortium designed to revitalize U.S. chip-making 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
But a year later, Hercules decided to scrap its venture into electronics. 
Semi-Gas was one of three subsidiaries put up for sale. Its dominant position 
-- 25% of the world market and about half of the U.S. market for its large, 
expensive products -- attracted several bids. One came from three Semi-Gas 
executives, including Lorenz, backed by British Oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
But as in so many other arenas these days, the highest bid came from Japan. 
Nippon-Sanso is a natural gas company that counts among its customers some of 
the biggest names in electronics and chip making, including Fujitsu. Although 
Hercules declines to confirm the figures, insiders say Nippon-Sanso's bid was 
$23 million, 20% higher than the management-British Oxygen bid, which was also 
heavily leveraged. 
</P>
<P>
What makes Semi-Gas valuable to the Sematech venture also makes it attractive 
to the Japanese. As chip makers try to pack more and more onto their already 
incredibly miniature and complex silicon chips, purity and precision are 
crucial. Even microscopic impurities act as boulders to block the chip's 
delicate circuitry, and gas used in the process must be exceptionally pure. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody can do anything that compares with Semi-Gas in gas delivery systems," 
said Joe Stroop, spokesman for Sematech. Stroop said Semi-Gas' participation 
has been critical to the third and final phase of Sematech's five-year mission: 
to design a manufacturing system for memory chips whose circuits are 0.35 
microns wide -- a size 5/1,000 the width of a human hair. 
</P>
<P>
Losing the participation of Semi-Gas, Stroop said, would deal a six-month blow 
to the Sematech efforts -- a serious threat because the consortium's charter, 
and funding, expires in 1993. And if Nippon-Sanso bought Semi-Gas, the company 
would have to drop out of the consortium: Sematech's charter bars foreign-owned 
companies from being members or suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
Sematech has warned Hercules and Nippon-Sanso that technological information 
used by Semi-Gas to develop the systems for Sematech is proprietary and cannot 
be transferred to a new owner without "our written permission. And we're not 
likely to give our permission if the new owner is foreign," Stroop said. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of Semi-Gas' customers are Sematech members and, said a Semi-Gas 
official, some have warned they would turn to another American company if the 
sale is approved. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. chip makers might have little alternative to doing business with 
Semi-Gas after it is folded into Nippon-Sanso's American company, Matheson Gas 
Products of Secaucus, N.J. Matheson's main business is gas, but it also 
competes with Semi-Gas in gas-handling systems. Together, they would control 
about 65% of the U.S. market -- a fact that spurred the antitrust review. The 
review may continue for months as the companies respond to Justice Department 
requests for vast quantities of market-share data. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more important to Nippon-Sanso is the added edge Semi-Gas would give it 
in the worldwide market; the fastest-growing sectors are outside the United 
States. Matheson officials declined to discuss the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"If Nippon-Sanso gets Semi-Gas," said one executive of the San Jose company, 
"it is doubtful any American company would ever dominate gas handling again." 
</P>
<P>
It is just such a situation that worries many in the U.S. chip industry. 
</P>
<P>
Haggerty, who lobbies for Semi/Sematech, an organization of Sematech suppliers, 
said her group would like to see a "moratorium on foreign acquisitions of these 
companies that are important to strategic defense." 
</P>
<P>
William Reed, president of the trade group Semiconductor Equipment and 
Materials Institute -- which has an international membership and does not 
oppose the sale -- said the relationship between chip makers and their 
suppliers must grow more intimate as the semiconductor devices become more 
sophisticated and the demands for precision are greater. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why the Japanese have so much success: They learn when the two groups 
work together they develop better products at a faster pace," said Reed. "And 
it is one of the strong reasons for the success at Sematech. It dawned on them 
(U.S. chip makers and suppliers) that they need to get together." 
</P>
<P>
The fear is that with the leading companies in foreign hands, U.S. chip makers 
will be shut out of technology advancements. 
</P>
<P>
Too, the majority of the materials and equipment companies are small, with 
annual revenues of less than $10 million. That makes them all vulnerable to 
foreign money, said one critic of the sale. 
</P>
<P>
If the sale to Nippon-Sanso falls through, Semi-Gas executives might again turn 
to foreign money. They said they may try to put together a new deal, with 
British Oxygen backing. 
</P>
<P>
While Reed agrees with the government's free-market policies and open door to 
investment, he also said it is vital for the United States to have an 
independent semiconductor industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. government should create an environment that would enable our 
semiconductor customers to survive in this race," he said, citing oft-repeated 
industry calls for more favorable tax treatment. "If our customers were 
healthy, the equipment and materials (companies) wouldn't be in the shape they 
are today."

PLASTIC IS 'GREENER' THAN PAPER, TRADE COUNCIL CLAIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paper or plastic? The debate over which is more environmentally sound is about 
to heat up as the paper and plastic industries compete for favor in the 
checkout line. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have an answer of their own: neither is good. 
</P>
<P>
The plastics industry today will attack the widely held notion that paper 
grocery bags and other containers are environmentally superior to plastic. An 
industry group will unveil studies that conclude plastic comes out ahead over 
the life of both materials. 
</P>
<P>
The studies, sponsored by the Council for Solid Waste Solutions, compare the 
so-called cradle-to-grave energy costs and environmental impacts of various 
disposable paper and plastic items. This means studying them from raw materials 
through manufacture and consumer use to recycling and final disposal. 
</P>
<P>
Besides shopping bags, the studies compare polystyrene foam and cardboard cups 
and plates, as well as the hinged boxes typically used to package hamburgers. A 
final study, comparing half-gallon milk containers, will be released in about a 
month, according to the council. 
</P>
<P>
The research, by Franklin Associates Ltd., a Kansas-based independent research 
firm, concludes that plastic takes less energy and produces less waste in the 
overwhelming majority of situations studied. 
</P>
<P>
Plastic grocery bags, for example, produce less waste at every stage of 
manufacture, use and disposal, the study says. Moreover, the energy required to 
produce and transport the bags is less for plastic up to the point where at 
least 60% of each kind of bag is being recycled, according to the study. Paper 
bags catch up at that point because there are greater energy savings from 
recycling paper than plastic. 
</P>
<P>
In the opposite camp, the American Paper Institute, an industry group, has 
looked at the studies and contends that they misrepresent the energy costs to 
produce each material. Also, say paper industry representatives, such questions 
as how the materials degrade in the open environment -- as litter and 
potentially harmful objects to wildlife -- were not addressed. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many environmentalists think both sides are wrong, in the long run. 
Containers shouldn't be disposable in the first place, they say. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, consumers should avoid both kinds of shopping bags by taking 
their own string sacks or canvas totes to market, says the Environmental Action 
Foundation, which concentrates on solid waste and energy issues. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're talking about plastic versus paper at the grocery store," says David 
Goeller of Environmental Action, "we recommend cloth. Shoppers in Europe have 
been carrying their own reusable sacks to the markets for years." 
</P>
<P>
"If forced to the absolute choice," Goeller says, "we'll come down on the side 
of paper. There we're dealing with a renewable resource." 
</P>
<P>
Paper industry critics make the same point, even about the energy that it takes 
to produce each material. 
</P>
<P>
Wood wastes such as bark, sawdust and pulp-plant residues -- all renewable 
resources, unlike the oil and natural gas used to produce plastics -- provide 
about 67% of the energy used to make the unbleached kraft paper in paper 
grocery bags, according to the paper institute. The papermaking and plastic 
manufacturing stages also use most of the energy in the cradle-to-grave cycle. 
And so, although it may take more energy to produce paper, the impact on 
non-renewable energy sources is greater for plastic, and that is of greater 
harm to the environment, say critics of the study. 
</P>
<P>
"This is more P.R. than science," said Robert T. McKernan of the paper 
institute. 
</P>
<P>
"We're aware of those arguments," countered Jere Sellers, program manager at 
Franklin Associates, which is in charge of the studies. "I wouldn't call it an 
unfair comparison." 
</P>
<P>
Sellers pointed out that Franklin researchers have performed such studies for 
at least two decades, not only for industry -- including the paper business -- 
but for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Defense and the 
Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst thing that we could do for our reputation would be to put out a 
study that threw objectivity out of the window," Sellers said, "and we're not 
about to do that."

Idea for 'Pretty Woman': A copyright infringement suit was filed against 
Touchstone Pictures, Disney Studios and six producers, directors and a writer 
of the hit film "Pretty Woman." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. District Court case was filed in Los Angeles by Ben-Hur Sepehr, who 
claims that in late 1983, he registered a screenplay, "Temporary Arrangement," 
about a romantic relationship between an attractive prostitute and a wealthy 
businessman. The suit seeks more than $100 million, including punitives, 
because Sepehr allegedly offered the screenplay to Disney Studios and "Pretty 
Woman" 's director between 1983 and 1989. (Filed June 28, 1990. Case No.

The Los Angeles Superior Court suit says Sequoia agreed in March, 1989, to 
design the equipment but did not finish on time and delivered substandard 
goods. The suit seeks more than $540,000 because Disney allegedly had to

JAPAN POISED FOR NEW JUMP IN ELECTRONICS; 
</P>
<P>
TECHNOLOGY: THE GOVERNMENT IS HELPING INDUSTRY DEVELOP LARGE LIQUID CRYSTAL 
DISPLAYS TO USE IN TVS AND OTHER CONSUMER PRODUCTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Japan's electronics industry, with government help, is pouring huge sums into 
liquid crystal displays, the flat screens that are used in digital watches and 
laptop computers. 
</P>
<P>
The companies are betting that they can overcome formidable technical barriers 
to develop large displays with high picture quality, allowing LCDs to be 
incorporated in full-size televisions, desktop computers and other products. 
</P>
<P>
"Technically, 40-inch LCDs with quality comparable to today's TVs will be 
realized in six or seven years. We're hopeful they can be commercialized in 
10," said Eiji Kaneko, director of the giant Electronics Research Laboratory, a 
government-sponsored consortium of 17 companies. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp, Hitachi, Hosiden and other Japanese firms will this year invest $1 
billion to research, develop and set up plants to make LCDs. Sharp, considered 
leader of the pack, plans to invest $650 million in the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
The only foreign group that is even close to the Japanese in LCD development is 
International Business Machines Corp., which makes LCDs in a joint venture with 
Toshiba. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a 'Japan-supplies-the-world' market," said Steve Myers, an industry 
analyst with Jardine Fleming Securities. 
</P>
<P>
Born in the United States and commercialized in digital watches in the 
mid-1970s, LCDs have come a long way. 
</P>
<P>
State-of-the-art production models deliver 16 colors on a laptop display. 
Samples of 14-inch displays with better picture quality and color, comparable 
to TV, are due out later this year but will cost $3,900. 
</P>
<P>
In the next year or two they are expected to fall in price, and the displays 
eventually will be combined with new integrated circuit memory cards to make 
lightweight laptops with long battery life and good graphic displays. 
</P>
<P>
LCDs, which operate by passing electricity through liquid crystal sandwiched 
between pieces of glass, use less energy than conventional cathode ray tubes 
and have flatter screens, making them attractive in portable devices. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, LCDs may gain in popularity because they appear to emit less 
electromagnetic radiation, which is seen as potentially hazardous, than cathode 
ray tubes. 
</P>
<P>
Prototypes of 20-inch LCD screens are expected next year, though 
commercialization is still three to four years off. Scaling up LCDs beyond 25 
inches will require technical breakthroughs that many people doubt are 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
Though researching LCDs is costly, brisk demand is helping to offset the 
investments. Demand is growing rapidly for smaller LCD panels for portable TVs 
and VCRs, video telephones, electronic pocket notebooks, laptop personal 
computers and automobile dashboards. 
</P>
<P>
By the middle of this decade, LCDs should eclipse cathode ray tubes as the most 
valuable display technology. By 2000, the LCD business will have grown 10 times 
to $13 billion, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
The investment blitz is reminiscent of one that gave Japan control of the 
global market for memory chips in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
But that effort had a hidden cost. When prices of memory chips fell in the 
mid-1980s, Japanese firms, having overestimated demand and built up excess 
capacity, were forced to sell chips below cost. 
</P>
<P>
Today, although excess capacity is not foreseen, few companies make money on 
LCDs because of the low percentage of panels produced without defects. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's LCD development also carries political risks, because its dominance 
over the market for another important electronic product may irritate trading 
partners such as the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be another recipe for trade friction down the road," said 
Virginia Kouyoumdjian, an industry analyst at Baring Securities in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
But to Japanese companies facing high labor costs and hungry Asian competitors, 
LCDs are a strategic imperative. Japanese companies can use LCDs to stay ahead 
in consumer electronics and further penetrate markets for computers. 
</P>
<P>
More broadly, Japan's focus on LCDs is a bonanza for its semiconductor 
production equipment makers, the companies that make the tools for producing 
microchips. Making active-matrix LCDs -- the most common type and the one 
Japanese companies are betting on -- is similar to manufacturing chips. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the Japanese blitz, the game is far from over. Active-matrix LCDs may 
never be scaled up to large sizes at affordable prices. And Japanese firms, 
along with many in the United States and Europe, are exploring alternative 
flat-panel technologies. 
</P>
<P>
But even if other approaches to LCDs turn out to be the screen technology of 
the future, Japanese firms are likely to dominate. 
</P>
<P>
"Whichever way the market moves, they'll have a product," Myers said.

U.S. agricultural exports to Pacific Rim countries are increasing again this 
year but the growth is smaller than in 1989, the Agriculture Department says. 
</P>
<P>
Exports to Japan, South Korea and Taiwan will not match the 10% gain of 1989, 
it said. 
</P>
<P>
"Economic growth in the developed Pacific Rim slowed for the second straight 
year in 1989," the report said. "Rising interest and inflation rates, and labor 
shortages in East Asia, are straining the region's economies." 
</P>
<P>
A strengthening of the dollar against the yen may have helped dampen demand for 
American farm products in Japan, the report said. Meanwhile, the dollar fell 
against currencies of South Korea and Taiwan, helping to boost export 
prospects.

HIGHER TAXES? MR. PRESIDENT: READ THEIR LIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush announced last week that he would support a tax increase to help 
lower the federal deficit. Southern Californians were variously perplexed, 
angry and philosophical. 
</P>
<P>
Did they feel betrayed by Bush's turnaround on his campaign pledge: "No new 
taxes"? Yes, but most said they didn't believe it then. Would they be willing 
to pay more taxes? Yes, some said, though many used the opportunity to lament 
high defense spending, the budget-draining savings &amp; loan crisis, housing 
prices and the trials of single-parenting. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody likes taxes. And as for the President's promise? 
</P>
<P>
Read their lips: 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that California already is expensive enough, they shouldn't raise taxes 
here. The average job doesn't include a cost of living increase. A single 
person gets eaten alive. He (Bush) contradicted himself and that makes him a 
backstabber just to get into office. That's why we vote for these people, so 
they can keep that (taxes) in check. I deal with people on a daily basis who 
are trying to get loans and I feel bad for people who are already paying high 
taxes. That's not fair." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sonya Hawkins, mortgage company representative, Costa Mesa 
</P>
<P>
"Bush, he's my man. I think it was necessary that he raised taxes now. I don't 
see any way he couldn't. I don't think it'll hurt him. He's my man." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Floyd Bates, retired parts assembly worker, Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't real confident when he said it the first time. I don't think I 
believed it then. I voted for him, not for only that but for other reasons. I'm 
a Republican. There's no way that anyone would look at the balance sheet of 
America and think we wouldn't have to raise taxes somewhere along the line. 
It's going to hurt a lot of people. It's going to hurt him the most. I don't 
know what his plans are for re-election but maybe it won't work this time." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kevin Gertsman, pharmaceutical salesman, Garden Grove

"I think it's wrongful if that's what he said. I'm not really big on politics 
but I don't want my taxes raised. I think they're right, right where they're 
at. I think they're high enough. They (federal government) are getting enough 
as it is." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Robin Shuleshko, catering representative, Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
"Half the American people voted for him on that promise. I think there are 
other avenues to recoup those needed funds. (As far as cutting Social Security 
benefits and other social programs) that's outrageous. There are other places 
he could cut, cut the military expenditures, collect from debtor nations, the 
overseas military bases that aren't needed, cut some of the military contracts, 
like the B-1. We need that money at home. I was very proud to vote for him. I 
felt he'd keep his promises. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Steven Bronte, purchasing agent, Costa Mesa 
</P>
<P>
 "Betrayal might be too strong, but he's certainly not kept his word. I think 
there would be other ways of doing it. One of the things that bothers me is 
that Reagan wouldn't have done it. He shouldn't make that kind of promise. If 
you make a promise you should keep it." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rob Tobias, Episcopal pastor, Long Beach

"It doesn't matter because either way we'll have to pay higher taxes. I'd 
rather pay more taxes to help the homeless or something like that."

<P>
"Well, I would be willing pay them. I don't think that we should really let our

taxes and pay off the debts so everything else can become more in order."

<P>
 -- Wilbert Mason, retired, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I do feel betrayed. It was just a politcal game for him to get elected. 
He knew he was going to have to raise taxes. He should have been a little more 
honest about the situation. Middle-income people like myself are the ones who 
are going to suffer. We could spend more time helping the homeless and the poor 
instead of raising the taxes for programs that are going to be cut." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Charlene Weaver, secretary, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel betrayed, really. I figured it's just something that's got to be 
taken care of . . . the deficit is just getting out of control. I don't mind 
paying extra money myself, I think we should have a United States Lottery and 
put the proceeds to fixing the deficit because then our whole economy will

<P>
 -- Paul George, electrician, La Palma

willing to pay more taxes to reduce the deficit."

ANN CONWAY: WITH KABUKI, 'YOU FEEL IT'; AT THE PARTY, YOU INTERPRET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ann Conway

<TEXT>
<P>
Instant interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were the watchwords at the Orange County Performing Arts Center on 
Saturday night when the Center board celebrated the local premiere of the Grand 
Kabuki Theatre of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
From the Japanese interpreters who helped guests chat at the pre-performance 
bash to the headphone-translations used by the audience, East met West with 
ease. 
</P>
<P>
This was a gathering where most of the calling cards had a flip side: personal 
names and company names printed in Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
"The (appearance of) Grand Kabuki is representative of the importance of the 
Pacific Rim to our community," Center Vice Chairman Roger Johnson told theater 
buffs. "We look forward to additional programming of this high quality in the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 party-goers, many from Japan, gathered in the posh Center Room to 
sip wine and pluck shrimp from the top of open parasols before hearing 
welcoming speeches from Johnson, president of Western Digital; Center President 
Thomas Kendrick; and Kiyohiko Arafune, consul general of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
During the reception, Kyoichi Miyazaki -- an executive producer for the Grand 
Kabuki -- talked about his country's 400-year-old national treasure. "Kabuki is 
not something you have to think hard about when you watch it," he said through 
an interpreter. "You just feel it." 
</P>
<P>
Up for viewing in Segerstrom Hall were two of the Grand Kabuki's most famous 
works. "Narukami" ("The Thunder God") wove a dramatic tale about drought. "A 
priest has trapped a god of rain under a waterfall and the land is dry," 
Miyazaki explained. 
</P>
<P>
"Migawari Zazen" ("The Substitute Meditator") told the story of "love between a 
man and a woman," he said. The other woman. "The husband is interested in 
someone else but pretends he is not. Chances are, such behavior would lead to 
divorce in Japan today. But this play is from feudal times. There was no such 
thing. Then, such behavior just got your wife very mad." 
</P>
<P>
Also among party guests was David Eagle, who is affiliated with the Japan 
America Society, an organization devoted to enhancing socio-economic 
communication between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
"The Grand Kabuki coming here is big news," said Eagle, sinking into one of the 
Center Room's plush sofas. "This will lead to Orange County being hospitable to 
Japanese investments and, as a community, being hospitable toward the Japanese 
living here. 
</P>
<P>
"Yukiyasu Togo (president of Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A.) sunk one million yen 
into the Kabuki tour. I believe that 12 of the 25 largest Japanese firms have 
their American corporate headquarters here in Orange County. Orange County is 
unique. It's a frontier community open to new ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Tiffany &amp; Co. at South Coast Plaza underwrote the reception, which included 
Sino-serenades strummed on a koto (zither). Earlier in the day, members of the 
Kabuki troupe visited Tiffany, said the store's vice president, Jo Qualls. 
"They loved the gold, mostly the small, tailored pieces," she said, "like Elsa 
Peretti's lima-bean necklace and her floating heart." 
</P>
<P>
More faces in the crowd: Center General Manager Judy Morr (who loves Kabuki, 
she said -- "the technique, the skill, the orchestration -- awesome!"); Henry 
and Renee Segerstrom, (who ducked out of the party early to dine with the 
Japanese consul at the Center Club -- site of the post-show party. The 
Segerstroms are planning a trip to Japan in the fall. "This is a wonderful 
exposure to the Grand Kabuki," Henry said. "I am glad we can have this 
international relationship."); Janice Johnson (who, with husband Roger, just 
returned from a business trip to the Soviet Union); Joyce and Tom Tucker; John 
and Jan Landstrom; Yasui Matsumoto, Grand Kabuki tour manager; Nancy and Rick 
Muth; Elaine Redfield; Stephanie and George Sakioka of Sakioka Farms; Candice 
and Roger Schnapp; Hisasai Takei, who donated $10,000 toward the Kabuki tour; 
and Gerald Yoshitomi, executive director of the Japan American Cultural Center 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Designing Women: The support group for the Art Institute of Southern California 
in Laguna Beach did it again. It tossed a gala extravaganza that saw a few 
hundred guests dining, dancing, bidding on auction items, and watching a style 
show staged by Kitty Leslie, fashion director for Newport Center Fashion 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
Designing Women -- founded by Muriel Reynolds -- presented an "Affaire in the 
Casbah" at the Newport Beach home of Mrs. John (Pilar) Wayne on Saturday night 
under a huge white tent on the tennis court. There, co-chairwomen Susan 
McFadden and Joleen Parham watched guests live it up in casbah garb, an arty 
array of chunky jewelry and yards of gauzy fabric. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep tripping on my flowing pants," piped Pam O'Neill, who checked out of 
the bash early to prepare a white chocolate wedding cake for Sunday's wedding 
of Five Feet Too restaurant owner Michael Kang. "It's topped with white 
chocolate lilies done up with edible 23-karat gold centers," O'Neill said. "I 
have work to do! Kang is lucky. The price of gold went down last week." (Kang 
and his bride, Renee Lippe, are lucky for another reason. Irvine Co. chairman 
Donald Bren -- a restaurant regular -- sent the couple two Baccarat decanters 
for a wedding present.) 
</P>
<P>
Gurley Brown in Town: Cosmopolitan editor-in-chief Helen Gurley Brown was at 
the Four Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach last week, sweet-talking the 
advertising crowd into buying space in her slick magazine. Last Monday, the 
willowy author of "Sex and the Single Girl" was living it up with pals in New 
York, celebrating the 25th anniversary of Cosmo. There, she received a new 
Mercedes-Benz. What did she get from Orange County? "Ooooh," she purred, 
"hotels don't get any more gorgeous than the Four Seasons." 
</P>
<P>
As for her personal style, forget the cleavage-baring Technicolor numbers she 
throws on her cover girls. Brown wears elegant Adolfo knits when she wants to 
look like a "lady"; stylish pieces by Donna Karan when she hits the office; and 
something black and covered-up when she wants to look sexy. 
</P>
<P>
As for women worrying about loving clothes (the old 
"if-you-adore-clothes-you-can't-be-serious-about-life" guilt trip), forget it, 
Brown said. "Gloria Steinem is always fabulously dressed. And Margaret Thatcher 
cares deeply about her wardrobe and does great things with her life." 
</P>
<P>
Social Scoops: Former Laker coach Pat Riley is coming to the Irvine Marriott to 
do lunch on Aug. 23. Riley will be the guest speaker at the first local 
"Winner's Circle" benefit for the City of Hope in Duarte. The topic? "His 
career and his new direction," said Joe Broady, associate public relations 
director for the City of Hope. "We got him before he resigned from the Lakers!" 
. . . The Little Mermaid Guild of Childrens Hospital of Orange County has 
landed the coup of the fall social season. CHOC will be the beneficiary of the 
Sept. 15 black-tie bash that will open the new Hilton hotel in Huntington 
Beach. The price is a steal at $125 per person. (The Hilton does it up right. 
Who can forget the caviar-smothered opening of the Irvine Hilton?)

POWER: THEY WANT IT NOW; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR WOMEN OPENS ITS 24TH ANNUAL CONVENTION 
EDGING EVER CLOSER TO FOUNDING A THIRD PARTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The delegates were beside themselves: 
</P>
<P>
* The same day the National Organization for Women opened its 24th annual 
conference here on Friday, President Bush vetoed a bill that would have 
guaranteed workers in larger businesses unpaid time off to care for seriously 
ill family members or newborn infants. 
</P>
<P>
* Three days before the NOW meeting began, the Louisiana State Senate passed 
the most restrictive abortion measure in the country (prohibiting all abortions 
unless a woman's life is endangered), a bill that also was passed by that 
state's House. Though Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer has threatened to veto the 
measure unless it includes exceptions for cases of incest or rape, legislators 
are said to be gathering to override a veto. 
</P>
<P>
* Almost a year ago exactly, the U.S. Supreme Court, in its Webster vs. 
Reproductive Health Services decision, allowed states to establish their own 
abortion rules, a devastating blow for abortion-rights activists. NOW President 
Mollie Yard estimates that 350 anti-abortion bills have been filed in state 
legislatures since last July. 
</P>
<P>
In response, NOW may become more aggressive than ever. The group said it has 
picked up 70,000 new members since the Webster decision (for a total of about 
260,000) and it intends to intensify its battles to keep abortion legal and 
accessible. 
</P>
<P>
Yard, in San Francisco, emphasized that the organization increasingly will back 
candidates of either party who favor abortion rights. And if there aren't 
enough politicians to NOW's liking, the group may start a third national 
political party to further a host of feminist causes. 
</P>
<P>
The notion of an entirely new political party was first proposed at last year's 
convention, where it reportedly met with considerable enthusiasm from the 
membership. 
</P>
<P>
The response from outside NOW's ranks, however, was disparaging. 
</P>
<P>
"Stupid, impractical, divisive -- you name it, we were called it," Yard said at 
a standing-room only session discussing NOW's just-launched "Commission for 
Responsive Democracy." 
</P>
<P>
After the November elections, the 40-member, multipartisan commission is 
expected to conduct hearings in six cities nationwide to determine the 
feasibility of a third party. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who have signed on as commission members are: 
</P>
<P>
* Rose Bird, former California chief justice; 
</P>
<P>
* Former Rep. John Anderson, a onetime presidential candidate; 
</P>
<P>
* ToneyAnaya, former New Mexico governor; 
</P>
<P>
* Ramsey Clark, former U.S. attorney general; 
</P>
<P>
* Dolores Huerta, vice president of the United Farm Workers. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been very trashed on this subject," former NOW president Eleanor Smeal 
told the convention. Currently a member of the commission and the president of 
Feminist Majority (an Arlington, Va.-based national group dedicated to electing 
feminists), Smeal emphasized that "all the issues are women's issues." 
</P>
<P>
Issues the commission will explore, as expressed in NOW's "expanded Bill of 
Rights for the 21st Century," include: 
</P>
<P>
* Rights to freedom from discrimination based on sex, race, age, disability or 
sexual orientation; 
</P>
<P>
* Reproductive freedom; 
</P>
<P>
* Freedom from violence; 
</P>
<P>
* The right to food, housing, health care and education; 
</P>
<P>
* The right to a safe and clean environ 
</P>
<P>
ment. 
</P>
<P>
The commission is expected to make its final report to the national NOW 
conference next summer. 
</P>
<P>
Though the notion of a third party appeared to have overwhelming support of 
this year's 2,000 conference attendees, Yard said in an interview, "We don't 
know what's going to come of it. We're going to look at everything. There are 
lots of different ways it could work out. 
</P>
<P>
"You might set up a system to endorse candidates, and where we didn't find 
somebody we liked, we'd put our own person up" for office, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that third parties can significantly affect established political 
parties even if they don't win many elections, NOW executive vice president 
Patricia Ireland cited George Wallace's American Independent Party's success at 
moving at both Democrats and Republicans to the right in the 1960s. And she 
pointed to a "more encouraging example": the Green Party of West Germany, 
widely known for its environmental concerns and influence. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the NOW conference heard Petra Kelly, the West German activist who 
helped found the Green Party in 1979 and who was elected to the Bundestag 
(German parliament) in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Other speakers included four women gubernatorial candidates: California 
Democrat Dianne Feinstein, Massachusetts Democrat Evelyn Murphy, Oregon 
Democrat Barbara Roberts, and Pennsylvania Republican Barbara Hafer. 
</P>
<P>
There also were two U.S. Senate candidates: Colorado Democrat Josie Heath, and 
North Carolina Democrat Harvey Gantt, who is attempting to unseat Republican 
Sen. Jesse Helms. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the conference, held at the San Francisco Hilton Hotel, 
anti-abortion activists marched outside the hotel, bearing signs such as: 
"Abortion Liberates Men Not Women," "Stop Abortion NOW," and "Feminists for 
Life." 
</P>
<P>
The anti-abortion demonstrators were peaceful, as were the hundreds of NOW 
members who participated in a pro-abortion rights rally Saturday at San 
Francisco's Union Square. 
</P>
<P>
The rally-memorial service was staged "in memory of the courageous women who 
died from illegal, unsafe abortions because they had no choice." 
</P>
<P>
"The life of a young girl is far more precious than a fertilized egg," Yard 
declared at the rally, referring specifically to the 1988 death of 17-year-old 
Becky Bell in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
Bell, according to NOW, chose an illegal abortion instead of seeking parental 
consent, required for a legal abortion in Indiana. (Indiana law requires either 
the consent of one parent or a rarely granted judicial bypass before legal 
abortions may be performed on minors.) 
</P>
<P>
Another hot abortion issue -- the testing and legalizing the French abortion 
pill RU-486 in the United States -- was discussed at another of the 
conference's standing-room only meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Yard proposed a "summit conference" of a coalition of abortion-rights groups to 
pursue means for getting RU-486 into the United States. Until this spring, the 
French manufacturer of the drug, Roussel-Uclaf, provided RU-486 to researcher 
at L.A. County-USC Medical Center, the only site of human testing of the drug 
in the United States. The firm has indicated it stopped providing RU-486 
because of the political climate on abortion in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, because RU-486 is not a difficult drug to duplicate, some feminists 
have proposed that international patent laws be ignored and an illegal, black 
market for the drug be set up in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure it's going to happen," Yard said, adding, however, that NOW would 
have "nothing to do with it. I've been approached and I've said that NOW 
doesn't engage in illegal activities."

HIGHER TAXES? READ THEIR LIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HANK STUEVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush announced last week that he would support a tax increase to help 
lower the federal deficit. Southern Californians were variously perplexed, 
angry and philosophical. 
</P>
<P>
Did they feel betrayed by Bush's turnaround on his campaign pledge: "No new 
taxes"? Yes, but most said they didn't believe it then. Would they be willing 
to pay more taxes? Yes, some said, though many used the opportunity to lament 
high defense spending, the budget-draining savings and loan crisis, housing 
prices and the trials of single-parenting. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody likes taxes. And as for the President's promise? 
</P>
<P>
Read their lips: 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter because either way we'll have to pay higher taxes. I'd 
rather pay more taxes to help the homeless or something like that." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mark Taitano, construction worker, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I would be willing pay them. I don't think that we should really let our 
children have to worry about the deficit; we should do our best to increase 
taxes and pay off the debts so everything else can become more in order." 
</P>

<P>
"Sure it's betrayal, because he lied when he said he wasn't going to raise 
taxes and then he says he is. I sure don't feel like paying any more taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wilbert Mason, retired, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I do feel betrayed. It was just a political game for him to get elected. 
He knew he was going to have to raise taxes. He should have been a little more 
honest about the situation. Middle-income people like myself are the ones who 
are going to suffer. We could spend more time helping the homeless and the poor 
instead of raising the taxes for programs that are going to be cut." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Charlene Weaver, secretary, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel betrayed, really. I figured it's just something that's got to be 
taken care of . . . the deficit is just getting out of control. I don't mind 
paying extra money myself, I think we should have a United States lottery and 
put the proceeds to fixing the deficit because then our whole economy will 
improve." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dave Edson, computer technician, Westhills 
</P>
<P>
"He should carry out what he said. And he didn't. I don't want to pay more 
taxes -- I think we should cut down on defense spending. We don't have to worry 
about the Russians any more."

<P>
"You expect a politician to lie. No, I don't want to pay more taxes because I 
think Congress needs to reorganize and prioritize their spending. We have 
enough money, they just have to redistribute it." 
</P>

promise) was only to win the campaign. It really upset me, because I tend to 
have Republican views. I guess it did the trick. But, absolutely, I would be 
willing to pay more taxes to reduce the deficit." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Deborah Selby, certified public accountant, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't real confident when he said it the first time. I don't think I 
believed it then. I voted for him, not for only that but for other reasons. I'm 
a Republican. There's no way that anyone would look at the balance sheet of 
America and think we wouldn't have to raise taxes somewhere along the line. 
It's going to hurt a lot of people. It's going to hurt him the most. I don't 
know what his plans are for reelection but maybe it won't work this time." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kevin Gertsman, pharmaceutical salesman, Garden Grove 
</P>
<P>
"Betrayal might be too strong, but he's certainly not kept his word. I think 
there would be other ways of doing it. One of the things that bothers me is 
that Reagan wouldn't have done it. He shouldn't make that kind of promise. If 
you make a promise you should keep it." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rob Tobias, Episcopal pastor, Long Beach 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that California already is expensive enough, they shouldn't raise taxes 
here. The average job doesn't include a cost-of-living increase. A single 
person gets eaten alive. He (Bush) contradicted himself and that makes him a 
back-stabber just to get into office. That's why we vote for these people, so 
they can keep that (taxes) in check. I deal with people on a daily basis who 
are trying to get loans and I feel bad for people who are already paying high 
taxes. That's not fair." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sonya Hawkins, mortgage company representative, Costa Mesa 
</P>
<P>
"Bush, he's my man. I think it was necessary that he raise taxes now. I don't 
see any way he couldn't. I don't think it'll hurt him. He's my man." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Floyd Bates, retired parts assembly worker, Santa Ana

<P>
The face flashed across the screen -- a Palestinian, somewhere in the Middle 
East, smiling faintly. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Klinghoffer, six months pregnant, was in her Greenwich Village apartment 
watching television with her husband. She saw the face and went cold, 
stiffening as if someone had splashed ice water on her spine. 
</P>
<P>
"I was paralyzed," said Lisa, 38. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the heat. 
</P>
<P>
"I started shouting. There he was, five years later, Abul Abbas, in the news 
again," she said, her throaty voice pitched and angry. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, Abbas, the leader of a small guerrilla faction of the Palestine 
Liberation Organization, masterminded the hijacking of the Italian cruise ship 
Achille Lauro. During the siege of the ship, Lisa Klinghoffer's father, Leon, 
an elderly man in a wheelchair, was shot and pushed overboard. 
</P>
<P>
"It just brought the whole thing back again, seeing him on the news," Lisa said 
of Abbas, who made headlines again in June for masterminding a raid -- aborted 
by Israeli soldiers -- on beaches near Tel Aviv. "The whole five years that 
we've gone through, I mean. I realized that this was potentially a massacre of 
hundreds of families. Thousands of people would be going through what we go 
through every single day." 
</P>
<P>
Ilsa Klinghoffer, 32, speaks more softly than her older sister. She is the 
quieter, more measured one. "You have to understand," she said, staring at her 
sister not so much for reassurance but more as a reminder of their stark 
tragedy, "we're trying to gain justice. But our parents, I believe, would have 
wanted us to have happy lives, and families, and not let this paralyze us. But 
sometimes things simply overtake us." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the Klinghoffer sisters were overtaken again. But for the first 
time, there was an ounce of satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
It came in a message on Lisa's answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
"Our lawyer called (and) said, 'I just wanted to let you girls know we won (and 
have been legally permitted) to sue the PLO,' " recalled Lisa. "And that's all 
he said. We sat there with our mouths opened. You don't know how these things 
are going to turn out. We've had this lawsuit for all these years." 
</P>
<P>
Ilsa, almost inaudibly, inserted her own reaction. "It's beyond what most 
people would try. People said to us 'What? Sue the PLO? Are you crazy?' You 
have to understand what our mother was like. She would have fought until the 
very end. And that's what we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
The image of an old man in a wheelchair shot and shoved into the Mediterranean 
has yet to fade from the American consciousness, even though there are fresher 
images of helpless victims and more recent terrorist events. There was the 
little American girl sprayed by gunfire at the El Al counter in Rome's airport. 
Americans died during a similar melee in the Vienna airport. And there were the 
259 people, mostly Americans, blown apart in a jumbo jet over Locherbie, 
Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the murder of Leon Klinghoffer, a crippled Jewish tourist on vacation in 
the Mediterranean, seemed in the 1980s to put a face on the tragedy of 
Americans getting caught in the cross-fire of the chaos of the Middle East as 
did no other event. 
</P>
<P>
And now, in the 1990s, his daughters are trying to get the people responsible 
to pay. 
</P>
<P>
Just last month, they won an initial step -- the permission to proceed -- in a 
civil lawsuit in federal court seeking damages from the PLO for their father's 
death. Although their victory may be more symbolic than practical, it could 
pave the way for others to seek American-style revenge via the courts for 
terrorist-caused deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Bert Amerman, a New Jersey high school principal whose brother died in the 
Locherbie bombing, said he hopes the Klinghoffers might lead the way for other 
families to seek retribution. 
</P>
<P>
But more important, he wants government held accountable: President Bush, 
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and West German Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl, he said, must acknowledge that "Iran, Syria and other nations are 
involved in acts of terrorism and they (Western leaders) can't do business with 
them (such governments) until they (acts of terrorism) stop." 
</P>
<P>
The Klinghoffer sisters -- upper-class women schooled not in international 
diplomacy but in the rhythms of Manhattan's fast-paced life and Jewish 
tradition -- aren't interested in the nuances of foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
They want to educate the world about terrorism through a foundation they have 
set up under the umbrella of the Anti-Defamation League. 
</P>
<P>
And they want to discredit the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
But more than anything, they are consumed by a desire for vengeance for their 
father's death. 
</P>
<P>
Abbas, in a press conference in Algiers, in 1988, discussed Leon Klinghoffer's 
demise. "Maybe he was trying to swim for it," Abbas was quoted as saying, again 
with a half-smile. Later, he compared the Achille Lauro hijacking to an 
accident that happens in the course of driving a car. Asked whether he 
regretted Klinghoffer's death, Abbas replied: "Who is Klinghoffer? . . . I wish 
that the names of our victims and martyrs were as well known as the name 
Klinghoffer." 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Klinghoffer referred to those Abbas remarks in an interview last week, 
replying bitterly: "Nobody seems to understand that these people don't value 
human life the way we do." 
</P>
<P>
She and her sister don't distinguish between Abul Abbas' open mockery and 
remarks made by PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat. The sisters are not interested that 
mainstream Palestinians may not approve of Abbas, although he is a member of 
the 15-person PLO Executive Council, or that Arafat has the impossible task of 
holding together a coalition of Palestinian groups while trying to maintain 
credibility before the world. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother wanted to get the PLO any way possible and so do we," said Lisa, 
whose mother died of colon cancer four months after surviving the 52-hour 
nightmare aboard the Achille Lauro. "She wanted to establish responsibility for 
my father's death. And that's what we want." 
</P>
<P>
Klinghoffer's widow, Marilyn, filed a lawsuit against the cruise line and the 
PLO almost immediately after she got home from the hijacking. Despite the 
cancer that was overcoming her, she labored to learn how to stop terrorism and 
who was responsible for the Achille Lauro incident. 
</P>
<P>
Before the House Foreign Relations subcommittee, Marilyn Klinghoffer, who was 
beaten by the Achille Lauro captors and later spit in their faces when she was 
identifying them for authorities in Italy, said she believed her husband's 
death had made a difference in how Americans perceived their vulnerability 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened to the passengers on the Achille Lauro could happen to anyone," 
she testified then. 
</P>
<P>
A few months later, she was dead. 
</P>
<P>
Ilsa Klinghoffer had planned to marry Paul Dworin, a magazine publisher, long 
before the hijacking incident. She had picked a date and place. Then, her 
father was gone. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to cancel, but my mother insisted we get the dress and continue on," 
recalled Ilsa, a slight woman with frosted blond curls. "Then, after she died, 
I wanted to cancel again. But I talked to the rabbi and my grandmother and they 
said you just have to go on." And there was a wedding, scaled down to 150 
guests, and Ilsa's brother-in-law, Jerry Arbittier, walked her down the aisle. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Klinghoffer daughters reached a financial settlement with the 
cruise line two years ago for an undisclosed amount, they have pursued the 
civil case against the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not in this for millions of dollars," said Lisa, who talks every day on 
the phone to her sister and lives two blocks from her. "We're in this to 
finally get someone to take responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
The federal judge's decision that the PLO could be sued in an American court 
has been viewed by some experts as an important step in the war against 
terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe Western governments, including the U.S., have failed politically and 
militarily to put a stop to terrorism," said a State Department official who 
asked not to be named. "Maybe this kind of suit could lead to a different 
deterrent. An economic one." 
</P>
<P>
But Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at the RAND Corp. in Santa Monica, 
disagreed. While it is one thing to win the right to sue the PLO, it's another 
to win the case, he said, adding: "I think it's going to be interesting to see 
if the court can determine how much control Yasser Arafat has over its 
constituent groups and people like Abul Abbas. . . . The PLO is one of the 
wealthiest terrorists groups in history. If you could win a settlement, they 
have a deep enough well that one can dip into and hurt them. But stop 
terrorism? I doubt it." 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, politicians in Washington are considering legislation to codify the 
right of American victims to seek civil damages from their foreign assailants. 
</P>
<P>
There have, in fact, been many attempts by victims of torture and terrorism to 
sue for damages. But they have been mostly unsuccessful and experts believe 
they would fail as readily in litigation against terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that unlike the PLO, most terrorist groups are elusive. They 
don't have property, cars or bank accounts in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Ramsey Clark, the former U.S. attorney general and now the PLO's attorney, 
argued to the court that the PLO couldn't be compared to terrorist groups. He 
said the PLO is, in fact, a state and should be immune from prosecution under 
international law. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. District Court Judge Louis Stanton wrote of the PLO: "Although it 
claims the attributes of a state, it controls no defined territory or populace 
and is not recognized by the United States." 
</P>
<P>
The PLO itself long has denied responsibility for the Achille Lauro hijacking; 
the group's advocates say that if PLO Chairman Arafat hadn't mediated a 
peaceful resolution of the incident, many more of the 440 passengers caught 
aboard in the siege would have died. 
</P>
<P>
Discussing the Klinghoffer case and American courts, Zuhdi Labib Terzi, the 
PLO's permanent observer to the United Nations, said: "I don't understand your 
system of justice. It is not logical." 
</P>
<P>
A seasoned diplomat who was raised in Jerusalem and studied law there in the 
1940s, Terzi said Abul Abbas' culpability for the incident is his alone, not 
the PLO's. 
</P>
<P>
"The PLO is the embodiment of the Palestinian people and it should not be 
blamed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He compared Abbas to Adm. John Poindexter, former President Reagan's national 
security adviser, who was convicted for his involvement in the Iran-Contra 
scandal, and Col. Oliver North, also convicted in that scheme. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were to hold the government of the United States responsible for every 
single act committed by an American, even if it was this Mr. Poindexter, or 
Col. South, or is it Col. North, where would the U.S. government end up?" 
</P>
<P>
In an interview in the United Nations lounge reserved for members, Terzi leaned 
forward several times in his bamboo chair, when describing what he believes is 
a conspiratorial effort by the Klinghoffers and the U.S. government to 
discredit Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
"There is not an indictment of Abul Abbas in this country," he noted. "Your 
government dropped it. Yet in the courts, they are seeking damages for the 
loss. The aim of the Klinghoffers and the U.S. government is strictly political 
and against the diplomatic trend of the times." 
</P>
<P>
He said the only assets the PLO has in the United States are its mission 
building on East 65th Street and a car, valued together at $360,000. But other 
experts have said the PLO's holdings in this country may be considerably 
larger. 
</P>
<P>
Terzi said the PLO had offered to include Klinghoffer in its list of "victims 
of the struggle," but "his people" refused. "He is one of the martyrs of the 
conflict that is going on over the question of Palestine." 
</P>
<P>
Leon Klinghoffer, 69, had lived his days far from the fierce conflicts of the 
Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
He was a small-appliance manufacturer who had worked first to overcome his 
modest Lower East Side beginnings, then labored for a decade to recover from 
two strokes. He was hard of hearing and spoke with slurred speech, but was 
determined to enjoy a normal life. His wife, a small woman 11 years younger 
than he, worked for a publishing concern and was the vocal one in the family. 
Together, they had a comfortable life, sending their daughters to private 
school and summer camps. They had an apartment in Greenwich Village, a weekend 
place on the Jersey shore and lots of good friends. 
</P>
<P>
Their Mediterranean cruise, which ended in tragedy, was their 36th anniversary 
present to each other. It was to be a 12-day voyage on an aging pale-blue 
vessel with stops at the pyramids of Egypt, the temples of Greece and historic 
Israel. The Klinghoffers had gone with nine friends with whom they had shared 
summers for decades in Long Branch, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a happy holiday for our parents," Lisa recalled. "They weren't 
devil-may-care types. If they had had even an inkling of problems, if there had 
been any governmental warnings or anything, they wouldn't have gone." 
</P>
<P>
Ilsa added: "My father, with all his problems, wanted to live more than 
anybody. And my mother, too. They never talked about death." 
</P>
<P>
The trouble aboard the Achille Lauro began a few days into the cruise when a 
ship waiter discovered four young Palestinian guerrillas cleaning their weapons 
in their room. Their plan had been to go ashore at the Israeli port of Ashod to 
take Israeli hostages but they panicked and took over the ship. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, an Italian court convicted the Palestinian hijackers and sentenced 
them to 30 years in prison. Abul Abbas and two others in the case were 
convicted, in absentia, and sentenced to life imprisonment. They remain 
fugitives. 
</P>
<P>
The Klinghoffer sisters did not attend the trial in Genoa because the Italian 
government couldn't guarantee their security. 
</P>
<P>
"In my heart, I wanted to be there to bear witness," said Lisa, who has never 
lived more than three miles from the place where she grew up in Greenwich 
Village. "But at the time, I was very vulnerable. People say my being there 
wouldn't have changed the verdict, but I always felt that my being there would 
have made a difference. Maybe they would have gotten the maximum sentence." 
</P>
<P>
Later in the interview, the subject returns to the Arab-Jewish struggle and the 
Middle East peace negotiations that the President recently suspended because of 
the alleged PLO involvement in the Tel Aviv beach attack. Ilsa, a health 
administrator who has a 17-month-old son, had to return to work. Lisa, an 
artist, had a doctor's appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Yet they both lingered, their frustration keeping them. 
</P>
<P>
"You know," Lisa said finally, looking at her perfectly polished nails, 
"everybody wants peace in the world. But you have to know how to go about it 
and who you're dealing with. In some cases, some people want it so badly that 
they don't really care who they deal with, even murderers."

<P>
In a verdict that electrified the courtroom, former Philippine First Lady 
Imelda Marcos was acquitted today of looting her homeland's treasury of $222 
million to buy New York skyscrapers, jewelry and art. 
</P>
<P>
Adnan Khashoggi, the jet-set Saudi businessman once described as the world's 
richest man, also was cleared of two counts that accused him of helping Marcos 
hide ownership of the property. 
</P>
<P>
The decision -- on Marcos' 61st birthday -- came midway through the jury's 
fifth day of deliberations. It capped a three-monthlong trial. She was 
acquitted on all counts. 
</P>
<P>
As the jury forewoman read the first innocent verdict, Marcos supporters cried 
out in happiness, ignoring U.S. District Judge John Keenan's warning against 
outbursts. Marcos was in tears. She smiled and hugged her lawyers. Others in 
the courtroom were hugging and crying. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors sat facing the judge, eyes downcast. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict was a crushing blow to the U.S. government, which had taken the 
unusual step of prosecuting a wife of a former head of state who had sought 
sanctuary in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
As she left the courthouse in a crush of reporters, Marcos said: "A great 
burden is lifted. I'm glad it's over." She appeared to be weeping as she walked 
down the steps, and she added: "Thank you. Thank you. God bless America." 
</P>
<P>
Khashoggi, smiling broadly, said, "I believe in the American system where 
people can decide the fate of an individual." 
</P>
<P>
A Muslim, he said he planned to leave New York to go to Mecca, the holy city of 
Islam, where pilgrims are gathering now. 
</P>
<P>
If she had been convicted on all four counts -- racketeering, racketeering 
conspiracy, mail fraud and obstruction of justice -- Marcos could have faced up 
to 50 years in prison and $1 million in fines. Khashoggi could have drawn a 
sentence of 10 years and a $500,000 fine on two counts -- mail fraud and 
obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos had been accused of conspiring with her late husband, former President 
Ferdinand E. Marcos, to buy art, jewelry and four Manhattan commercial 
buildings with money stolen from their country. It was charged that much of the 
millions of dollars came in kickbacks Marcos collected from government 
contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Ferdinand Marcos also was indicted in October, 1988, but was ruled too ill to 
stand trial. He died in Hawaii last September. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Marcos' flashy attorney, Gerry Spence, of Jackson, Wyo., conceded she was 
a "world class shopper," but said she did not know the source of her husband's 
wealth. In his closing argument, Spence said she was guilty only of loving and 
supporting her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses testified that the money was funneled to the United States through 
numbered bank accounts in Switzerland, Hong Kong, Manila and Los Angeles and 
was used to secretly buy the buildings for the Marcoses through nominees and 
offshore corporations. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged offenses took place in the latter part of Marcos' two decades as 
president of the Asian nation. Marcos was deposed in February, 1986, by a 
"people's revolution" led by Corazon Aquino, widow of a murdered Marcos 
opponent. She became Philippine president as the Marcoses fled to exile in 
Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Carmen Pedrosa, a spokesman for the Philippine government, said in a hastily 
written statement issued here that even though Mrs. Marcos was acquitted, the 
trial showed that her late husband's regime was rife with "unbridled corruption 
and total abuse of power" and a ban on her returning to the country remains in 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
The federal prosecutor's office issued a statement saying that "our system of 
justice has spoken" and that the team of prosecutors who tried the case had 
done a good job. 
</P>
<P>
Khashoggi, 54, is a financier and arms dealer who divides his time between 
homes in New York, France, Saudi Arabia and other locales. He played a 
middleman role in the Iran-Contra scandal, in which U.S. arms were secretly 
sold to Iran by officials of the Reagan Administration and the profits diverted 
to the U.S.-backed Contra rebels in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
The trial, which began in late March, involved 95 witnesses, all called by the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
It filled 5,900 pages of transcript and included bank records, receipts, 
letters, diaries and phone logs as evidence. Some of the key documents were 
recovered at Manila's Malacanang Palace after the Marcoses fled. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony was highlighted by witnesses' accounts of Mrs. Marcos' shopping 
habits, including spending sprees at Bloomingdale's and numerous New York 
jewelry stores. Witnesses also said she used close friends and a secretary to 
handle purchases and deliveries of large amounts of cash for her expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The New York branch of the Philippine National Bank was described as her 
"personal piggy bank," and its manager called himself the "satchel man" who 
carried a valise containing $100,000 when he accompanied Mrs. Marcos' entourage 
to a state funeral in South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution claimed its evidence, though heavily circumstantial, proved 
that as a Cabinet minister and mayor of Manila, Mrs. Marcos would have had 
knowledge of Marcos' corrupt practices. 
</P>
<P>
The basic allegation of the racketeering charges was that Mrs. Marcos violated 
U.S. laws against wire fraud and the transfer of stolen money into the United 
States.

The White House denied today that President Bush had assured Republican 
lawmakers that he will not propose income tax rate increases. The denial came a 
day after Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas said he does not expect 
the President to propose an increase in the rates. 
</P>
<P>
"He has not made any assurances on anything. Everything is up for discussion," 
White House press spokeswoman Alixe Glen told reporters accompanying Bush on a 
Fourth of July vacation in Kennebunkport, Me. 
</P>
<P>
Dole said he expects Bush will not back tax rate increases, but will support 
higher oil import fees and taxes on alcohol and tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) countered Sunday on ABC's "This Week With 
David Brinkley" that such an approach would not raise enough money to reduce 
huge budget deficits. 
</P>
<P>
Glen refused to characterize any proposals that are under discussion by

The Food and Drug Administration today warned pregnant women not to use aspirin 
during the last three months of pregnancy except on the advice of their 
doctors. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA said it will require all aspirin and aspirin-containing products to 
bear a warning on their labels alerting pregnant women to the dangers of taking 
the drug during their final trimester. Possible problems of taking aspirin 
during the last three months of pregnancy include effects on fetal circulation 
and uterine contraction. 
</P>
<P>
The new warning must immediately follow the caution against nursing mothers 
using aspirin except at the instruction of a physician.

Washington Mayor Marion Barry's wife says she warned him another woman would be 
his downfall. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him all along: 'You're going to be set up with a woman,' " Effi Barry 
was quoted as saying in today's New York Post. 
</P>
<P>
"My gut (feeling) was that this would be his downfall." 
</P>
<P>
The FBI used former model Rasheeda Moore on Jan. 18 to lure Barry to a 
Washington hotel, where he was videotaped smoking crack. 
</P>
<P>
She said "one never knows" if her marriage will last, and she blamed alcoholism 
for her husband's troubles. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Barry said she had no knowledge of any cocaine use by her husband. 
</P>
<P>
"The times I've seen him incapacitated were due to drink," she said. "Those 
other alleged activities were when I wasn't present, so at this trial I, too, 
may learn things."

PENTAGON: LACK OF INFORMATION LED CHENEY TO BRAG OF PLANES' ACCURACY DURING

The chief of the Tactical Air Command failed to tell his superiors that Stealth 
fighter-bombers missed their targets in the Panama invasion, it was reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times said the lack of information led Defense Secretary Dick 
Cheney to brag about how accurate the bombing had been when bombs actually 
missed by as much as 160 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also said a classified Air Force report concluded that there were 
defects in planning the Panama operation, confusion over the mission of the 
planes, poor coordination between the Army and the Air Force in picking targets 
and inadequate pilot training for the weather conditions over the targets. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Robert D. Russ, whose Tactical Air Command controls the Air Force fighter 
planes, issued a statement saying he had left it up to Army commanders to tell 
the Pentagon how the invasion fared. 
</P>
<P>
"There is always some confusion in the reporting of any military operation, and 
I didn't want to add to it," Russ' statement said. 
</P>
<P>
He added: "When I look back at what has transpired, it is evident that more 
detail should have been forwarded." 
</P>
<P>
The report on the performance of the F-117A, called Stealth for its ability to 
avoid radar detection, was prepared by the Air Force inspector general, Lt. 
Gen. Bradley C. Hosmer. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney had demanded an explanation after reports that a bomb from one of the 
two planes had actually hit a hillside some distance from the intended target. 
</P>
<P>
After receiving the report, Cheney's spokesman said May 31 that Cheney was 
satisfied that Air Force officials didn't try to mislead him. Spokesman Pete 
Williams said the confusion was found to have taken place between those in the 
Air Force's chain of command charged with administration of the aircraft and 
those in the service's upper chain of command. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force officials reported that both jets had accomplished their mission, 
which was to stun and disorient the Panamanian troops, even though one of the 
bombs hit a hillside.

BUSH: I DON'T EXPECT NATO 'BOMBSHELL'; 
</P>
<P>
BUT ALLIANCE LEADERS WILL AMEND POLICY ON NUCLEAR WEAPONS

President Bush said today that NATO leaders will make changes in the alliance's 
nuclear weapons policy but that "I don't happen to believe it's (of) bombshell 
dimension." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, preparing for this week's meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization in London, said he wanted to talk with Defense Secretary Dick 
Cheney and Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, about the 
current NATO policy on nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post and the New York Times reported today that Bush is 
proposing a NATO policy of using nuclear weapons only as a last resort. Current 
policy is that such warheads could be used first if an enemy were gaining the 
upper hand in conventional warfare. 
</P>
<P>
Bush talked with reporters as he stood outside his seaside vacation home with a 
coterie of advisers who flew up from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he expected changes in NATO policy to come from the meeting of the 
16-member alliance, he said: 
</P>
<P>
"What I expect is a . . . document that is unanimously agreed to that will set 
the course for the future. As conditions have changed, NATO will change. . . . 
Some will call it dramatic policy changes and others won't." 
</P>
<P>
"There will be some changes, but I don't happen to believe it's bombshell 
dimension," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said his Administration had been in close contact with the allies in 
advance of the London summit. He said "we've got broad general agreement" on 
the issues, but indicated differences remain in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
"There's still some work to be done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Bush on a blustery Maine morning at his family compound were Secretary 
of State James A. Baker III, Vice President Dan Quayle, Cheney, Powell, White 
House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu, National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, 
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and others. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said earlier that the Administration is ready to look toward 
eventual withdrawal of about 1,400 nuclear-tipped artillery shells from Western 
Europe. Bush will attend the NATO meeting on Thursday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said the Administration will consider eliminating U.S. nuclear 
stockpiles, including the artillery shells now deployed in West Germany, but 
only if the Soviets withdraw their troops completely from foreign soil in 
Europe. The shells have a range of about 18 miles.

FORSTMANN TO GET GENL. INSTS. FOR $1.6 BILLION

Forstmann Little &amp; Co., a leading leveraged buyout concern, said today it 
will buy General Instruments Corp., cable TV and gaming equipment maker, in a 
deal it valued at $1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The buyout is one of the biggest merger transactions in a relatively dormant 
year for takeovers, and is especially unusual because leveraged buyouts of big 
public companies have become a rarity. 
</P>
<P>
In a leveraged buyout, a private group acquires the public stock of a company 
and replaces it with debt. 
</P>
<P>
Forstmann entered into the definitive merger agreement to buy General 
Instruments Corp. for $44.50 a share cash, a premium over its $36.25 closing 
price on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The stock in the transaction is worth $1.2 billion, and, with the assumption or 
refinancing of existing debt, the buyout is worth about $1.6 billion, Forstmann 
Little said. 
</P>
<P>
The transaction is fully financed and not subject to any financing conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Forstmann Little, led by the outspoken junk bond critic Ted Forstmann, has 
remained active in the leveraged buyout field while others have dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
Forstmann has continued to buy companies by using more traditional types of 
financing. Most recently, the firm bought Gulfstream Aerospace from Chrysler 
Corp. for $825 million. 
</P>
<P>
The market for junk bonds, high-yield, speculative corporate bonds, meanwhile, 
has been in disarray for more than a year, after a number of junk-bond-financed 
takeovers failed. Forstmann's chief rival, Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., 
has turned its efforts to refinancing previous junk-bond funded deals like RJR 
Nabisco, instead of completing new ones. 
</P>
<P>
General Instruments, which has grown steadily by selling high-tech systems for 
cable television, lotteries and betting parlors, has seen its stock languish in 
recent months.

Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu told Peruvian President-elect Alberto 
Fujimori today he would send an aid mission and advisers to help the Andean 
country's economic reconstruction, Fujimori said. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu made the pledge during a meeting with Fujimori, the first ethnic Japanese 
to become a head of state outside Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Kaifu clearly understood our economic problems," Fujimori told reporters 
after meeting the premier at his residence. "As one means, he has promised me 
to send an economic mission." 
</P>
<P>
Japanese Foreign Ministry officials said Kaifu also promised to send economic 
advisers to Peru as soon as possible after Fujimori's inauguration later this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund and other international lending organizations 
suspended aid to Peru in 1988 because the incumbent president limited foreign 
debt servicing to a fraction of foreign earnings.

Construction spending fell 0.4% in May after dropping 2.2% in April, the 
Commerce Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
The two consecutive monthly declines follow a modest gain of 0.4% in March, 
according to a report compiled by the department's Census Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
The March and April figures were revised from previous data. 
</P>
<P>
Private construction spending dropped 1.8% in May after a 1.4% decline in 
April, while public construction regained lost ground, jumping 4.4% in May 
after taking a 4.9% dive in April, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
On the housing front, which has been battered by months of apathetic sales, 
residential construction spending was off 2.2% in May after tumbling 1.4% in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of single-family homes plummeted 3.9% in May, but construction of 
apartment buildings inched up about 1%, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
Private non-residential construction, meanwhile, fell 1.7% in May on declines 
in the building of industrial, office and private school buildings, the 
government said. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of hotels, motels and churches was unchanged while construction 
spending on private hospitals was up slightly.

Asarco Inc.'s Ray unit was struck Sunday by unions representing about 700 
copper workers. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first copper strike in Arizona since the turbulent Phelps Dodge 
strike seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The old contract expired at midnight Saturday and contract talks broke off here 
around 4 a.m. Sunday, union and company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The union coalition had rejected the company's final offer, which would have 
provided an average $2.50-an-hour wage increase over three years. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Guadiana, the United Steelworkers official who heads the talks for the 
unions, said the 24-member union committee also had "significant concerns" over 
Asarco proposals he said would damage pension, insurance and disability 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Guadiana also cited "forced overtime" rules as another problem.

Television producers say Warren Beatty is losing some of his mystique as he 
heavily promotes his role in the movie "Dick Tracy." 
</P>
<P>
"I would imagine the we-got-to-have-him attitude is somewhat diminished," Jack 
Riley, executive producer of ABC's "Good Morning America," said in the July 7 
issue of TV Guide. 
</P>
<P>
"But actually, now that he's gotten into it, he's a far better interview than 
he has been," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Beatty had stonewalled seasoned interviewer Barbara Walters early on, and 
producers were wary of the once elusive star. 
</P>
<P>
"Donahue" senior producer Lorri Benson said she was "pleasantly surprised" by 
Beatty's openness when he appeared on the syndicated show. There were no 
preconditions and no taboo subjects, and Beatty spontaneously agreed to appear 
on the show a second time, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Riley also was leery of scheduling a Beatty interview. He had previously dealt 
with the star when he was touting his mega-bomb "Ishtar." Beatty taped a 
segment for "Good Morning America" but later made so many demands that the 
producers "dumped the whole thing," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
The only constraint in the interview for "Dick Tracy" was that 11-year-old 
co-star Charlie Korsmo be on with him.

SWAYZE'S NEW ROLE: NOT JUST A 'GHOST' OF HIS OLD MOVIE SELF

Patrick Swayze hoofed his way to stardom in "Dirty Dancing" but drifted away 
from his romantic image when producers cast him as a slam-bang action star in 
his next two movies, "Road House" and "Next of Kin." 
</P>
<P>
Now he's back as his old charming self in "Ghost," to be released July 13. He 
says it is his best picture since "Dirty Dancing." 
</P>
<P>
In reality, Swayze is equal parts brawn, brains and sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
The son of a Texas cowpoke who knew hard times, Swayze idolized his father and 
is proud of his horse ranch in California and his farm in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
He also is proud of "Ghost," a non-violent drama with comedy in which he plays 
a murdered man who returns from the spirit world to communicate with the woman 
he loves (Demi Moore) in order to save her life. 
</P>
<P>
Portraying a ghost, invisible to the rest of the characters, proved 
disconcerting. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very strange to read a line and get absolutely no reaction from the 
other performers," Swayze said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"The character I play is overwhelmed by the feeling of being totally 
ineffectual, which I felt, too. It was weird doing the special effects -- . . . 
scenes like walking through walls -- all on my own with no other actors around. 
</P>
<P>
"The descriptions were written beautifully, but it was a different matter 
bringing them to life in terms of reality or playability. I'd have a five-page 
scene in which the ghost was not dealt with. It was hard to play. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of excitement about this movie, which I hate to hear. In the 
past I've never put too much stock in rumors about a picture's success. When a 
movie is over I go on to the next one, so all my cookies aren't in one basket. 
</P>
<P>
"But people keep telling me 'Ghost' is going to be the surprise hit of the 
summer because it's a love story with great warmth that has audiences feeling 
good at the end. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first movie I've ever felt 100% proud of. And maybe it's the first 
one I've done that parents can take their kids to see. It has great heart and 
good things to say about life. 
</P>
<P>
"I sort of feel I'm at home in 'Ghost.' My insides as a human being were 
screaming to do a picture where people walk out of the theater being affected 
in a positive way. I needed it for myself, too." 
</P>
<P>
While Swayze enjoys the more sensitive roles, he has not forsaken action 
thrillers. The broad-shouldered actor is in production with young Keanu Reeves 
in "River on the Storm," an action picture in which he will be called upon to 
sky-dive and surf with expertise. 
</P>
<P>
"Action pictures are great. I love 'em. I'm a male beast. But it seems I'm best 
at romance," Swayze said. "I'm a romantic fool to the core. I'd like to play 
Clark Gable kind of roles. There's a gentle part of me, and that's what my 
father was. 
</P>
<P>
"He was an intense, strong man but there was a gentleness to him, and those are 
my best qualities. Like my father, I find the vulnerable side of me confusing 
because that's not what we were taught a man was supposed to be. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe all men are trying to figure out how to handle that sensitive side of 
our nature. It's a matter of not squelching the wild man -- the unpredictable 
male thing we have inside us -- and at the same time to be sensitive and 
gentle. 
</P>
<P>
"It's those qualities that I try to project in my movie roles." 
</P>
<P>
In "River on the Storm," Swayze says he plays "an adrenaline junky who will do 
anything to get that 'alive' feeling." 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand that. I go for the action and physical thrill." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surfing almost every day so that by the time we get to Hawaii I can be 
surfing the big waves. I can't talk about sky-diving for insurance reasons. But 
I'm a guy who insists on doing his own action and stunts."

VON HAPSBURG GETS ROYAL BOOT

Princess Michaela von Hapsburg, a granddaughter of the last emperor of 
Austria-Hungary, and her family have been evicted from their posh Manhattan 
penthouse. 
</P>
<P>
The eviction became public Thursday when a city marshal announced an auction of 
the furnishings in the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
The princess's lawyers are trying to save the family's possessions, which 
reportedly include the seal of the Hapsburg dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday was the anniversary of the 1914 assassination of Von Hapsburg's 
grandfather's great-nephew, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, and his wife, whose 
deaths signaled the beginning of World War I. 
</P>
<P>
A leaking roof started the dispute, according to a New York Daily News report 
Saturday. Von Hapsburg and her husband, Duke Eric d'Antin, complained to the 
landlord about the leak, which later was fixed, said Arthur Birnbaum, lawyer 
for the landlord, Blair Tower Associates. 
</P>
<P>
But Birnbaum said the family did not make a March deadline for paying $108,000 
in back rent after the roof was fixed. They were given several more chances to 
pay before the landlord took over the apartment by changing the locks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The royal couple and their three children moved from the 5,000-square-foot 
penthouse with panoramic city views to a hotel.

Jeana Yeager, who made history in the non-stop round-the-world flight of the 
Voyager in 1986, escaped injury Sunday when an experimental plane she was 
co-piloting lost power and crashed on landing. 
</P>
<P>
Elko County Sheriff's Deputy James Neff said the 38-year-old Yeager of Nipomo, 
Calif., and the plane's pilot, Shirland K. Dickey, 48, of Chandler, Ariz., 
walked away from the craft. 
</P>
<P>
The deputy said the pair were flying an experimental propeller-driven plane in 
the Eighth Annual International E-Z Air Show and were on the final approach of 
a 120-mile race between Jackpot and Wells, Nev., when their engine caught fire 
about four miles from the runway. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, it was a dead-stick landing," the deputy said. On touching down, 
the plane left the runway and its landing gear collapsed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yeager and pilot Dick Rutan set aviation history in December, 1986, when they 
flew the Voyager in a nine-day unrefueled circumnavigation of the globe.

GRAF TEACHES CAPRIATI HARD LESSON;

<P>
Steffi Graf showed Jennifer Capriati today how much the 14-year-old has to 
learn about grass-court tennis. 
</P>
<P>
Using powerful forehands, slicing serves and a rock-solid net game, the 
top-ranked Graf beat her youngest challenger in straight sets in their first 
meeting to reach the quarterfinals at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
Graf, 21, won an eagerly awaited Centre Court match, 6-2, 6-4. Refreshed by a 
quick weekend trip to West Germany, the defending champion won the big points 
and kept Capriati from setting the rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think she's old, she just has experience," Capriati said. Graf said 
Capriati was much more advanced than she was at 14. 
</P>
<P>
Capriati, the whiz-kid from Florida who at No. 12 was the youngest seed in 
Grand Slam history, showed the type of play that has raised her so high in the 
four months since she turned pro. 
</P>
<P>
She served well, ran down shot after shot and matched Graf's firepower from the 
baseline. But she rarely came to the net and Graf wrapped it up with her 
trademark, a forehand flashed down the line and buried in the corner on her 
third match point. 
</P>
<P>
"The forehand. I had always heard about that forehand," Capriati said, her 
voice filled with awe. "It's just a bullet. She moves so quick. I mean, there's 
always a ball that comes back." 
</P>
<P>
It was a smile of relief that covered Graf's face as she shook Capriati's hand 
at the net. Her reign at the top has been under fire, with 16-year-old Monica 
Seles beating her twice in a row and Capriati climbing fast. And then there is 
the threat of 33-year-old Martina Navratilova, seeking a record ninth Wimbledon 
title. 
</P>
<P>
An autumn-like start of the second week of the Grand Slam tournament had 14 
fourth-round singles matches, and most of the seeded survivors of this 
upset-riddled event moved on. 
</P>
<P>
Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg turned Centre Court meetings of champions into 
routs, and Seles scored a quick and clean victory over an outmatched American. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg, the 1988 Wimbledon champion and runner-up last year, beat Michael 
Chang, the 1989 French Open winner, 6-3, 6-2, 6-1. Chang, who defeated Edberg 
in five sets to win in Paris last year, held serve only three times in a dozen 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Becker, the defending champion who is aiming for his fourth Wimbledon title 
overall, beat 1987 champ Pat Cash, 7-6, 6-1, 6-4. Cash was a wild-card entry 
but had looked strong in the previous three rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Seles won her 36th match in a row, taking just 45 minutes to beat Ann 
Henricksson, 6-1, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
Next for Seles is No. 5 Zina Garrison, who eliminated 10th-seeded Helena 
Sukova, 6-3, 6-3, and has not dropped a set so far. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova also won comfortably, making the quarterfinals for the 16th 
consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova, the women's second seed, registered a 6-3, 6-3 victory over 
14th-seeded Judith Wiesner of Austria. 
</P>
<P>
Ivan Lendl, the men's top seed, stayed on course to finally end his quest for a 
Wimbledon title, but he had a tougher time than expected. 
</P>
<P>
He beat Bryan Shelton, an American ranked 125th, 7-6, 6-7, 6-4, 6-4, in a match 
suspended by darkness at one set apiece Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
The day's lone upset had Christian Bergstrom of Sweden beating 11th-seeded Guy 
Forget of France 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, 7-5.

Burglars broke into the home and visitor clubhouses over the weekend and made 
off with several game jerseys, but got nothing from Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
The Texas Rangers realize how highly sought Ryan memorabilia is among souvenir 
collectors, so the club takes special security precautions to protect the 
pitcher's personal possessions.

Kevin Romine led off the ninth inning with his first home run of the season and 
Mike Boddicker outlasted Nolan Ryan for his 10th straight victory as the Boston 
Red Sox edged the Texas Rangers 3-2 today. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan who allowed just seven hits and two runs in trying for his 297th career 
victory, threw 144 pitches before being replaced by Kenny Rogers (2-4) to start 
the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Romine lined a 3-2 pitch high into the screen in left, enabling the Red Sox to 
finish 9-2 on a home stand in which they took over the lead in the AL East. 
</P>
<P>
Boddicker (11-3) allowed 10 hits, struck out nine and walked three in extending 
the longest win streak of his career. He also has three no-decisions in 13 
starts since his last loss, 3-1 to California on April 25. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, who struck out seven and walked four, became the only pitcher with 100 or 
more strikeouts in 22 seasons, one more than Don Sutton. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan is second in the AL with 104 strikeouts, eight behind California's Mark 
Langston. 
</P>
<P>
The 43-year-old right-hander, who has not won in four starts at Boston since 
May 6, 1977, is just 2-8 lifetime at Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 2-1, the Red Sox tied the score in the seventh as Romine grounded a 
single to left and Billy Joe Robidoux doubled to left.

Gov. Mario M. Cuomo today signed legislation that reopens and expands New 
York's shuttered simulcasting operations and could lead to renewed racing at 
Tioga Park near Binghamton in Upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
The bill also promotes twilight racing, allows race tracks to operate their own 
telephone betting lines and permits the New York Racing Assn. to run simulcast 
teletheaters in New York City, on Long Island and in Westchester County. 
</P>
<P>
The new law came one day after hundreds of Off-Track Betting parlors and race 
tracks were left without live broadcasts of horse races because the old 
simulcast law expired at midnight Saturday.

DANCE DUO LEADS WAY TO "42ND STREET"

<P>
Jack Tygett and Joyce Schumaker are a married couple with much in common. They 
are both trained dancers. They have both directed and choreographed major 
musicals. They both teach at schools. 
</P>
<P>
But for all they have in common, they do have a striking difference. Each is a 
product of a different era of musical theater. 
</P>
<P>
Tygett, 62, was weaned on the Busby Berkely-style of musical extravaganzas. He 
danced in lavish movie spectacles, including "Oklahoma!" "No Business Like Show 
Business," and "Flower Drum Song." 
</P>
<P>
Schumaker, 42, didn't even begin dancing until a couple of decades later, long 
after the heyday of movie musicals. 
</P>
<P>
"When I went to Los Angeles in the early '70s," said Schumaker, "they weren't 
even doing musicals. I had a ballet background as a child, and I also studied 
tap. But even then, tap had already fallen out of favor." 
</P>
<P>
Tygett experienced a different time there. 
</P>
<P>
"When I began dancing in movies and television in the early '50s," Tygett 
recalled, "it was a breakaway period, the last of the big movie musicals. It 
wasn't a lack of audiences. The problem was with the budgets. In the old days, 
we had hundreds of people in the casts. The big spectacles just got too 
expensive." 
</P>
<P>
These days, the dance duo spend most of their time teaching a new generation of 
hoofers and gypsies. Tygett, who developed the musical theater program at 
United States International University in 1969, still heads the department, 
staging old-time musicals at the university's Old Town Theater. 
</P>
<P>
Schumaker is chair of the dance department at Chula Vista High's School for 
Creative and Performing Arts. She has been directing musicals as well for the 
past five years. And this summer, they are hard at work staging "42nd Street" 
for a run at Vista's open-air amphitheatre. The show will kick off the 10th 
anniversary season July 3. 
</P>
<P>
The couple last teamed up in 1988, when they directed and choreographed a 
successful Moonlight production of "Gypsy." 
</P>
<P>
"42nd Street" is an appropriate choice for a couple of dance makers who span 
two diverse periods in musical theater. The show is of relatively recent 
vintage, but in style and content it harks back to the golden age of lavish, 
large-scale musical comedies. 
</P>
<P>
" '42nd Street' only debuted in 1980," Tygett reminded, "but the style of the 
dancing comes from the '30s." 
</P>
<P>
"It's basically a tap dance show -- a tribute to the musicals of the '30s," 
Schumaker added. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, Tygett and Schumaker make no clear lines of demarcation between 
their duties when they're working on a joint project. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working so independently on this show, we hardly even see each other," 
Tygett said. 
</P>
<P>
However, because Schumaker danced in Starlight's early-'80s production of the 
show (which was faithful to the original choreography by Gower Champion), she 
will take on the responsibility of re-creating the big production numbers that 
abound in this tap-happy musical. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm re-creating what I can remember from the Starlight production. The rest, 
I'm filling in," she admitted. "We're trying to be faithful to the period, but 
we're also bringing more story line" into the dance numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're making the dancing much more dramatic," Tygett stressed. "We're sticking 
to the style of the show, but there's more of a ballet and contemporary feeling 
to the activities. Joyce's ballet background will come through." It's not just 
danced with the end of the feet as in old-time tap, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Though many of the performers in the Moonlight Amphitheatre cast of "42nd 
Street" are tyros, Tygett and Schumaker are gung-ho about working with them. 
</P>
<P>
"What's special about Moonlight is that it involves high school kids. It gives 
them a chance to work, and this summer they're even doing 'Into the Woods,' a 
contemporary musical. (Moonlight) will be the first local group to do it," he 
said, referring to the Stephen Sondheim show scheduled to open Aug. 29. 
</P>
<P>
"Living with Rodgers and Hammerstein -- much as I admire them," Tygett said, 
"gets a little tiresome. You need better opportunities. Jobs in performing are 
hard to find. Budgets keep getting in the way. But some new and different 
things are happening now. Unfortunately, most of it is coming from England." 
</P>
<P>
 The Moonlight Amphitheatre's outdoor production of "42nd Street," with Patti 
Goodwin, William Nolan, and Judy Clark heading the heavily non-professional 
cast, will be performed on July 3, 5-8, and 11-15.

ROCKET RESEARCHERS ALREADY PLOTTING TRIP TO RED PLANET

<TEXT>
<P>
For many of us, the words "Mission to Mars" bring to mind the futuristic ride 
in Disneyland's Tomorrowland. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a speech a year ago -- on the 20th anniversary of the first Apollo 
landing on the moon -- President George Bush, in what he called a "journey to 
tomorrow," proposed a real manned flight to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
 With that speech, Bush ignited an ongoing debate about how much the nation 
should be spending on its space program and what its long-term goals should be. 
Congress is debating whether to provide seed money during the 1991 fiscal year 
to study the prospects for establishing a manned base on the moon and sending a 
manned space flight to Mars -- two projects that together are known as the 
Space Exploration Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the Mars mission will take a back seat to other National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration programs. NASA's first order of business is to begin 
launching the initial components of the Space Station Freedom by 1995 and build 
an outpost on the moon by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a host of aerospace companies have begun exploring technologies 
that could be used for a Mars mission. Among them: McDonnell Douglas in 
Huntington Beach; Ford Aerospace in Newport Beach; Lockheed in Calabasas; 
General Dynamics in San Diego; Rockwell International in Pittsburgh, Pa., and 
Martin Marietta in Bethesda, Md. Each team is busy generating a range of 
options about how to undertake the costly and technologically difficult 
35-million-mile journey to the Red Planet. Mars enthusiasts with each team are 
putting their science fiction-like ideas to paper and preparing to submit 
proposals for the Space Exploration Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Dean Takahashi discussed the subject of a mission to Mars 
with one such enthusiast: Charles A. Ordahl, vice president and general manager 
of the advanced product development and technology division at McDonnell 
Douglas Space Systems in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordahl, a 34-year veteran at the company, was chief engineer for the Delta 
rocket program and is currently in charge of the firm's strategic planning and 
research on the Space Exploration Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Q. How long have we thought seriously about going to Mars? 
</P>
<P>
A. It's always been within the aspirations of the United States space program 
that someday we would go on to Mars. But we've taken a steppingstone approach 
with early exploration on the moon, the shuttle, the development of the space 
station, and finally plans leading to Mars. If you take our space station 
efforts as the first steppingstone, we started as early as 1960. We've been 
working on it more intensively within the past year since President Bush's 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So President Bush's speech was a motivating force behind renewed efforts to 
go to Mars? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think the President wanted to provide a new and inspiring goal for the 
nation. He decided we should have a long-range space program with many facets 
to it. He said we should first complete the building of Space Station Freedom, 
which is already under way. We would then go from that base back to the moon 
and build a base for scientific research, then go to Mars and explore it, 
because it is the planet in our solar system most like the Earth. It was in 
part a response to criticism that we didn't have a long-term goal for a long 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What was the time frame? 
</P>
<P>
A. There wasn't any at first, but the President said in May that by the year 
2019 we would be on Mars. That makes it much more credible. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What are the technical challenges of a trip to Mars that make it such a 
long-range mission? 
</P>
<P>
A. We've already conquered the idea of going to space. But we're dealing with a 
much longer period of time. A shuttle flight lasts seven days, a flight to the 
moon was about three days, and a flight to Mars would be six months to a year, 
one way. So one of the big problems is the length of time man would have to 
spend in space. That exposes him to things we don't fully understand yet, such 
as cosmic radiation and zero-gravity environment. There may be psychological 
effects. With the space station, we will learn how to address some of those 
questions, such as having people in space for longer periods of time. 
</P>
<P>
A second challenge is simply to build the life-support systems for maintaining 
life for extended periods of time. That will require new technological advances 
such as a life-support system that recycles (either food or waste). 
</P>
<P>
We'll also need better propulsion systems. We have shown so far that we can do 
a Mars mission with some of the types of chemical propulsion systems we have 
today, but some of the things we're looking at are reducing the amounts of 
propellants required and increasing the speed of the spaceship. There is a 
possibility of using nuclear propulsion. 
</P>
<P>
Other challenges are building infrastructure on the moon for a permanent 
presence. We'd want to use materials on the moon to do that. That would be an 
altogether new way of doing things. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you have to have a base or space station to get to Mars? 
</P>
<P>
A. That has been a subject for debate. Some people argue that we should go 
straight to Mars and save money that way. But the President's position appears 
to be it's a more prudent approach to go to build the moon base first and learn 
along the way. It would probably be easier to build the Mars ship in space or 
on the moon base. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is it settled that the spaceship will be manned? 
</P>
<P>
A. Nothing has been settled. We believe so far that this will involve a 
combination of manned and unmanned missions. It's generally felt robotic 
missions should go first because you can afford to learn how to proceed. It is 
also felt that ultimately we want to send humans because no matter how much you 
try, you cannot replace the intellect or dexterity of man. He can adapt to his 
own senses on the site. 
</P>
<P>
Plus it's also more exciting to the American people. It was exciting to me to 
watch the first Viking probe land on Mars. But it was far more exciting to 
watch man put his foot on the moon 20 years ago. Man is an important part of 
this mission for lots of reasons that touch the soul of humankind. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Will that mean it will take a lot longer to get there? 
</P>
<P>
A. Some problems are unique to man and that could mean more time. But man has 
always been a very basic part of our space program, from Mercury, Gemini, 
Apollo, the shuttle, the space station. This is just the next step. A lot of 
what we talk about here is a long-term perspective of where we as a world are 
going. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Estimates of the cost are $300 billion to $500 billion, right? 
</P>
<P>
A. It's very difficult for me to assess costs. We have made our own 
assessments, based on a particular architecture and plan. The government has 
made some estimates in the range you mentioned. It's an expensive program, but 
it's also a great investment in the future. And though the number is large, 
when you spread it over 30 years, you're getting a better perspective. It adds 
up to less than 1% of what government spends in a year. You have to put that in 
the context of what we spend each year on defense. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Will this be a hard sell for the American people? 
</P>
<P>
A. I don't think so. Polls I've seen show there is a great deal of support for 
the program. It's very important we have a certain investment in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What are the benefits? 
</P>
<P>
A. It's difficult to quantify. One has to think in terms of things that have 
been achieved so far in the space program. For instance, it has benefits for 
our education system. We hear about a lot of problems in science and math, 
where we are in a competitive battle with other nations. Programs such as a 
trip to Mars have a way of inspiring people to go into these fields. Whether 
they ever work in the space business is incidental. When kids are in the fifth 
or sixth grades and they see things happen with this program, they will want to 
learn more. That's only one benefit for the education system. 
</P>
<P>
You have to invest, and it usually pays off with something entirely different 
from what you expected. You can tell that story many times. In the medical 
area, you can point to CAT scans as benefits from the space program. This moves 
technology forward. 
</P>
<P>
There are other reasons. There is an imperative to explore, like with Columbus 
moving to the New World. The pursuit of new knowledge. We make progress as a 
nation because we learn new things. If you look at the geology of Mars, the 
experts tell us it used to be very much like Earth a long time ago. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Mars is very unlike Earth. Once it had liquids flowing in channels. Why 
did Mars evolve so differently? Maybe there is a clue to ensure the well-being 
of our own planet. We don't know for sure, but we can try to find out. 
</P>
<P>
Q. With the conversion of the defense industry, more aerospace companies are 
going to have to build something besides weapons. Is that a selling point for 
Mars? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think so, especially with the political conditions in the world today. 
Most people believe conversion (of the defense industry) will happen. There 
will be a fair amount of distortion in the economic impact of that. The nation 
needs a certain amount of this kind of investment in defense, and it's 
important we not do too much to change the amount of work going into defense 
research. I believe that Mars is a good investment, a source where you can put 
the funds during the transition. That's a fairly potent argument for the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Can you outline an example of current thinking for a mission to Mars? 
</P>
<P>
A. The main example we've looked at is building a large rocket that can deliver 
several hundred thousand pounds of payload into low Earth orbit, which is well 
above the 50,000 pounds the shuttle could carry. 
</P>
<P>
Since it would be too heavy to launch from Earth, we would carry the parts up 
and assemble a spaceship at the space station. It would have a crew compartment 
for about four people. A large amount of the weight would be propellant. Once 
it was assembled with robots, it would take off on a trajectory to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
When it neared Mars, it would enter into Mars orbit. A portion of the ship 
would land on the planet itself. The first mission might stay on the surface 
for 30 days. It would use aerobrake technology, which is a device that works 
like a parachute, to assist in slowing down the vehicle for the landing. That 
would be more efficient than carrying fuel for reverse rockets to slow the ship 
down. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, it would not be unlike the exploration of the moon. The astronauts 
could use space suits and rovers and explore. Once having completed the 
mission, they would have to take off from the surface. Here we could use 
several scenarios, with one lander (that would be) used going down (to Mars) 
and another to take off. The return vehicle would dock with the ship, and then 
it would take six months to a year to get back to the space station. 
</P>
<P>
Once we neared Earth, we could either land at the space station and catch a 
ride down in the shuttle or enter the Earth's atmosphere directly. Aside from 
the time, space and propulsion capability, it's not different from going to the 
moon. But it's a long reach and a lot of new technology is required. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What are some of the projects your people are working on? 
</P>
<P>
A. Some of us are working on specific research and development projects, trying 
to develop life-support systems that recycle energy, making propellants out of 
lunar soil or thinking about how to make a ship that could use solar energy. 
</P>
<P>
Some of our people are looking at solar sails as an exotic way of powering a 
spaceship. This would be a large device like a sail that would absorb rays from 
the sun and use the solar photons as fuel so you could reduce the weight of the 
spaceship and save on costs. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, there are more than 60 projects under way. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Earlier you mentioned nuclear propulsion. 
</P>
<P>
A. I'm no expert, but nuclear propulsion could cut the flight time at least in 
half and maybe more. We did have some nuclear propulsion programs 20 years ago, 
but nothing since. One difficulty here would be testing. You have to test these 
propulsion systems. Twenty years ago, you could do it. Part of it is just going 
out and picking up where we left off. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Among Mars enthusiasts, what's the level of satisfaction about how fast 
things are moving? 
</P>
<P>
A. I would be happy if things went faster. But I'm thrilled we are going as 
fast as we are because the President is a great leader on this issue. We would 
be moving a lot slower without him. I understand the constraints and priorities 
that limit how fast we can do it. But there should be no limits on the resolve 
to do it. Sure, I would have been happier if we picked up after Apollo and 
progressed like (pioneer rocket scientist) Wernher von Braun wanted to so that 
we would have been on Mars in the 1980s. In the meantime, we have a working 
shuttle program and the space station is being built. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So it's a combination of gathering political support and building the 
technology you need to go to Mars? 
</P>
<P>
A. Right. There needs to be more time put into some of the issues. They have to 
be discussed with the American people, policy makers in Washington and the rest 
of the world. It will take some time to get people into it. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is it more difficult in this age of big deficits? 
</P>
<P>
A. Sure. But during the Apollo program, we spent 4% of our national budget on 
our space program. Today we spend about 1%, and we're talking about spending 
another 1%. Our priorities are different now. During Apollo, we were competing 
with the Russians, and that gave it a high priority. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How much has been budgeted so far? 
</P>
<P>
A. In January, President Bush submitted a budget for $188 million in 1991, a 
reasonable amount of money to begin the project planning for a Mars mission. 
His intent was to have government find the right plan. To move it forward, it's 
important we appropriate the funds in the 1991 budget. Without it, we could see 
a reduction in resolve in the short term. With it, more companies could be 
brought in and we are more likely to find some solutions. 
</P>
<P>
Q. When would full-scale work on contracts begin, given the 30-year plan? 
</P>
<P>
A. Full-scale design and development would have to start around 1995 to meet 
the President's expectations. We are counting on this project as a major source 
of revenue in the late 1990s and after. In 10 years, Space Station Freedom will 
be flying and we should be working very hard on this Mars project. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is there much prospect of a joint mission with the Soviets? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. I think there will be an international mission of some type. We have 
the precedence for it with the space station. Major portions of the space 
station are being built in Europe, Japan and Canada. It has become a learning 
experience for us as we think toward a mission to Mars. One reason it would be 
good is to share costs, but an international mission will also bring synergies 
as international partners each bring something to the table. 
</P>
<P>
Q. On an international mission, if you brought a rock back from Mars, who would 
own it? 
</P>
<P>
A. I'm no expert on international space law. I suspect the parties would make 
an agreement on this issue. The United Nations treaties that have been put in 
place regarding the moon would probably be extended. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How many people does McDonnell Douglas Space Systems have working on the 
Mars program? 
</P>
<P>
A. We have 30 people on it, plus a team of subcontractors. It varies since some 
programs are generically related to space more than Mars. Overall, about eight 
or 10 companies are working together and each of those has teams of 
subcontractors. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How much is being spent right now? 
</P>
<P>
A. I don't know exactly. Industry is putting a lot of funds into it even though 
at this time there isn't a lot of government money available. Anticipating the 
long-term program, we are investing at a reasonable level so that we can be a 
major contributor on system-level architectures and eventually we'd build 
hardware. 
</P>
<P>
Q. When you step off the spacecraft, what will you see on Mars? 
</P>
<P>
A. You will see large mountains and plains, a small atmosphere. It's a fairly 
arid place without vegetation. There will be rocks and dust. It has more 
character to it than the moon. The vision is that, in time, we will have a 
permanent presence on other planets. I don't know how long it will take. 
Ultimately, we will see colonies on Mars. We will have expeditions and, in 
time, settlements.

FRANK LUBIN, A BIG MAN IN TWO COUNTRIES; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: HE HELPED U.S. WIN OLYMPIC GOLD MEDAL IN 1936, AND LATER INTRODUCED 
THE SPORT TO LITHUANIA, WHERE HIS PARENTS WERE BORN.

<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The children at the junior high in Carson listened carefully as Frank Lubin, a 
former U.S. Olympic basketball player, spoke during a recent career day. 
</P>
<P>
Lubin told the youngsters to stay in school and to avoid drugs and alcohol 
because they had the potential to be Olympic athletes. 
</P>
<P>
When Lubin was finished, they pestered him for autographs. 
</P>
<P>
It was the repeat of a scene from the early part of the century. 
</P>
<P>
As a youngster, Frank Lubin had listened attentively to a former Olympian 
addressing the students of Belvedere elementary school in East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I promise you that one of you is going to be an Olympic athlete," the man 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although it happened more than 70 years ago, Lubin, 80, still recalls the 
moment vividly. 
</P>
<P>
"When he said that one of us was going to be an Olympic athlete, I think he 
looked straight at me," Lubin said. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, the prediction was accurate. Lubin eventually led the U.S. 
Olympic basketball team to a gold medal at the 1936 Games in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
"When we won the Olympic Games in 1936, I got a cable offering me employment 
from the Denver Safeway Piggly Wiggly team, subject to immediate acceptance," 
Lubin said. "The offer was $35 a week." 
</P>
<P>
Rejecting it because he was making $50 a week as a studio stagehand, Lubin went 
to visit relatives in Lithuania, where his parents had been born. He stayed for 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
Known there as Pranas Lubinas, Lubin taught the Lithuanians to play basketball. 
Serving as player-coach, he led the Lithuanian national team to European 
championships in 1937 and 1939. He scored the winning basket in the 1937 
European championship game. 
</P>
<P>
"I made them toe the line with my style," Lubin said. "I taught them fast 
break, passing and defense. It may not be the style of the pros today where one 
man, like Michael Jordan, shoots all the time. I didn't teach them to be a 
one-man team, I taught them to pass it to the man who had the best open shot." 
</P>
<P>
Lubin left Lithuania before World War II and was in Italy, coaching a 
Lithuanian women's team, when it broke out. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a problem because we had to cross Germany to get (back) to Lithuania," 
Lubin said. 
</P>
<P>
Marooned in Milan, Lubin asked for help from Italian officials, who allowed the 
team to return to Lithuania by train and boat, avoiding Germany. 
</P>
<P>
After returning to America, he continued to play basketball and is considered 
one of the greatest players in AAU history. He played until 1955, when knee 
problems prompted him to retire. 
</P>
<P>
But he wasn't forgotten in Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
Known as the godfather of Lithuanian basketball, the players Lubin taught 
eventually became coaches themselves and later helped develop such players as 
Arvydas Sabonis, Sarunas Marciulionis, Rimas Kurtinaitis and Voldemaras 
Chomicius, who led the Soviet Union's Olympic basketball team to a gold medal 
in the 1988 Olympics. In the Soviet Union's 82-76 victory over the United 
States, the four Lithuanians scored 62 points. 
</P>
<P>
"They're actually my second-generation students," Lubin said. "I had no contact 
with the four boys that played for Russia in 1988, but my students coached in 
Lithuania for many years." 
</P>
<P>
Lubin had a reunion with his players when he returned to Lithuania last year to 
celebrate the 50th anniversary of their European championship. He was welcomed 
by the president of Lithuania and the Soviet ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
Crowned with flowers and showered with chocolates, Lubin was treated as 
visiting royalty. Hounded by autograph seekers and photographers, Lubin posed 
for pictures with Sabonis. One of the biggest selling calendars in Lithuania 
has a picture of Lubin and Sabonis. 
</P>
<P>
It was their second meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"When Sabonis came to America after he was drafted by the Portland Trail 
Blazers, he said he'd come to Los Angeles if he could meet Pranas Lubinas," 
Lubin said. 
</P>
<P>
When Lubin shot up to 6 feet 6 1/2 inches at Lincoln High School, classmates 
encouraged him to try out for the basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
Rather reluctantly, he agreed. Gangly and uncoordinated, though, Lubin 
struggled. 
</P>
<P>
"My high school coach couldn't see any use for me," Lubin said. "He was making 
me jump center and then he'd put me on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
"Once, he got so mad at me that he threw the ball at me and he told me go in 
the ladies' gym and practice shooting the ball because I wasn't coordinated." 
</P>
<P>
But Lubin persisted and made the All-City second team as a senior in 1927. Then 
he moved on to UCLA, where he played basketball for the Bruins, earning 
All-Coast honors as a senior in 1931. 
</P>
<P>
After graduating from UCLA, he briefly attended Cal's law school and continued 
to play basketball for the San Francisco Olympic Club. 
</P>
<P>
But times were hard and Lubin was forced to drop out of school. Returning to 
Los Angeles, he went to work as a grip for Universal Pictures, forerunner of 
Universal Studios, where he played for the studio's AAU basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
When Universal won the U.S. Olympic tournament, the team was selected to 
represent the United States in the first Olympic basketball competition at the 
1936 Games in Berlin.

But the studio heads, angry that the Games were being held in Nazi Germany, 
refused to sponsor the team's trip to Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Determined to go anyway, the team barnstormed across the nation, playing in 
towns large and small to earn the money for the trip. 
</P>

Playing on an outdoor court, the United States won the gold medal, defeating 
Canada in the final, 19-8, during a downpour that left two inches of water on 
the court.

"Hitler didn't see basketball as an indoor sport," Lubin said. "He didn't think 
it was very popular so we had to play on a gravel court." 
</P>
<P>
After finally returning to Los Angeles in 1939, Lubin expected to receive a 
hero's welcome. After all, he had helped the United States win an Olympic gold 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
Instead he was fired. 
</P>
<P>
"Universal didn't want me to go to Nazi Germany, so when I returned, my job 
wasn't there," Lubin said. "I never worked at Universal since. We had no money 
to get back to America. We were just cut off from American society." 
</P>
<P>
Lubin continued to work in the movie industry, though, going to 20th Century 
Fox as a stagehand. 
</P>
<P>
During his 30 years at Fox, Lubin led the studio basketball team to more than 
20 Southern California AAU titles as player-coach. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, he was honored as one of the greatest Los Angeles-born athletes as 
part of the City's bicentennial celebration. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Coach Bobby Knight invited Lubin to address the U.S. Olympic team. As 
Lubin entered the dressing room before a game, Knight said, "See this man here? 
He has something you don't have. A gold medal."
