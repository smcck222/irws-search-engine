NEWSMAKERS: A NEW BEGINNING FOR COUPLE -- AND FOR POLAND'S JEWS

 -- Happy memories of the day mingled with painful recollections of the past as 
Warsaw saw its first wedding in a synagogue since the Holocaust. Families and a 
few members of the city's once-thriving Jewish community watched as American 
Jew Robert Blum and his Polish-born bride, Joanna Kan, exchanged vows. The good 
wishes came multilingually: "Congratulations," "Mazel tov" and "Wszystkiego 
najlepszego na nowej drodze zycia" -- the last Polish for "All the best on the 
new road of life." Blum, who met his wife at work in New York, said he hopes 
the wedding will help rejuvenate Poland's Jewish community. Fewer than 300,000 
of the nation's Jews survived World War II, and emigration cut their number to 
fewer than 10,000, most of them elderly. Warsaw, which itself once held 380,000 
Jews and 400 synagogues, now has only one synagogue, rebuilt in 1983. The 
rabbi, Menachen Joskowitz, a Polish concentration camp survivor, arrived from 
Israel about six weeks ago for a two-year stay.

 -- Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. and several thousand others gathered to 
make a mountain out of a milestone, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the 
addition of President Theodore Roosevelt's face to Mt. Rushmore. A 
45-by-90-foot flag was unveiled over Roosevelt's likeness as Mary Ellis Vhay, 
daughter of Rushmore sculptor Gutzon Borglum, greeted the crowd. Mt. Rushmore, 
in South Dakota's Black Hills, also includes the faces of Presidents George 
Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln. The anniversary was also used 
to launch a $40-million fund-raising effort to expand and improve the monument, 
and the state of South Dakota contributed $150,000. But one of the original 
workers on the sculpture, Howard Peterson, said Borglum "didn't want any of 
this stuff, the concession stands and all."

 -- In an emotional farewell speech to the National Education Assn. she leads, 
Mary Hatwood Futrell called on teachers to "embrace change" and to remember her 
as having "chalk dust on the sleeves of her soul." The six-year president of 
the 2-million-member union was interrupted more than 60 times by cheers, 
applause and standing ovations. About 8,400 delegates to the NEA Representative 
Assembly in Washington are to vote on Futrell's successor today. DAVE JOHNSON

JACK SMITH: OXY KIDS SPENT THEIR KISSES IN VARIOUS WAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Ten years have passed since my Occidental classmates told you, 'We don't 
expect you to come up here and make a landmark speech.' " 
</P>
<P>
It was a letter from Melody L. Malmberg, Oxy '79, inviting me to the 10th 
reunion of the class to which I had given the commencement address. 
</P>
<P>
When I was invited to give the address I had driven up to Occidental to find 
out what was expected of me, and a member of the senior council had assured me, 
"Mr. Smith, we don't expect you to come up here and make a landmark speech." 
</P>
<P>
And I didn't. I think the only advice I offered was "Spend all your kisses." 
</P>
<P>
I wrote later: "It was the most exuberant and enchanting commencement I have 
ever seen, and all its impudence, I suspect, was quite without hostility or 
malice." 
</P>
<P>
The impudence included a young woman who walked across the stage to receive her 
diploma from the college president with a tiger on her mortarboard (the tiger 
being Oxy's mascot); the young man who carried an infant across the stage, and 
the young man who led a large yellow dog across it. 
</P>
<P>
The reunion cocktail party and dinner was to be on a Saturday evening in the 
parking structure of Newcomb Hall. A parking structure is not designed for 
cocktail parties, and when my wife and I arrived, the din made conversation 
difficult. But everyone was in high spirits; we shouted in one another's ear. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd was vivacious, exuberant and euphoric, though I suspected that the 
years had not dealt equally well with all. Ten years is time enough for 
disappointment, disenchantment and heartbreak, as well as success. 
</P>
<P>
In her letter, Melody had said: "Ten years after college puts most of us at the 
somewhat interesting age of 32. Many of us are making strides in our 
professions. . . . We are world travelers and we are wrapped up in our young 
families. We have single-mothers-by-choice, gay activists, right-to-lifers, 
pro-choice advocates. The men are going bald. The women are wearing makeup." 
</P>
<P>
I was pleased when Brian Lewis introduced himself and said, "Thanks for urging 
me to 'spend my kisses.' I've been trying to do that ever since." 
</P>
<P>
John Drew was teaching political science at Williams College in Massachusetts; 
Cathy (Conant) Thomas was teaching economics in summer high school; Lois 
(Moore) Hunter was an insurance agent; Gary Coomber, a physician in Sonoma 
County; Tim Bambrick works for Transamerica but also is into play writing and 
editing. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Woods said she had brought her 6-week-old daughter, Annie. I saw Annie in 
a man's arms at a nearby table. I wondered why her mother didn't have her 
maiden name in parenthesis, like many of the others, on her name tag. She said, 
"My partner and I aren't married. We're non-traditional. I gave my daughter my 
own name." 
</P>
<P>
Well, it had been that kind of class; the anarchy of the early 1970s was gone, 
but '79 thumbed its nose at tradition and authority. Mary Woods is now a film 
story editor. She said, "Annie's Class of 2010." 
</P>
<P>
A handsome, well-dressed young man came up to introduce himself. He was Darrell 
Krasnoff, the young man who had led the dog across the stage. Krasnoff is now 
in security sales. He said Max, the dog, had been a yellow Labrador. 
</P>
<P>
"Two years later," he said, "he also got an MBA at Stanford." 
</P>
<P>
"You mean," I said, "he walked across the stage with you when you got your 
diploma?" Indeed he had. Krasnoff had then gone to New York and Max had lived 
with him in Greenwich Village. Max died a year or so ago. He spent his last 
year at ease on a ranch. 
</P>
<P>
The buffet dinner was eaten at tables under the concrete girders. The mood was 
ecstatic. After dinner Eric Newhall, professor of American studies and English, 
was one of two or three brief speakers. His wit was heroic. 
</P>
<P>
Then the evening degenerated into a television-style guessing game, in which 
the left and right sides of the class competed, with outrageous enthusiasm and 
chaotic demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
Through the noise I tried to converse with Lee Case, vice president for 
development and planning. He said, "So this is what education is all about 10 
years later! What about ultimate solutions? Are we dealing with that?" 
</P>
<P>
Melody Malmberg was standing beside us. "TV and babies," she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
While China slaughters its children and freedom seekers, where is the 
hastily-called United Nations session to condemn the terrorism and inhumanity, 
as with Israel? Where are the demonstrations demanding a withdrawal of all 
investments, as with South Africa? Where is the Administration's fanatic 
dedication to overthrowing communists in favor of freedom fighter, as we have 
been doing in Nicaragua? 
</P>
<P>
Where are the marching liberals, civil rights activists? Why the thunderous 
silence? 
</P>
<P>
Is it just that the victims are yellow, not black? Or that a communist nation 
is the barbaric terrorist? Or that it is a large nation? 
</P>
<P>
Or, God forbid, because, for a morally-bankrupt government and a hypocritical 
American population, a concern for profits comes first?

TAX PENALTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second time in three years, I received my property tax bill with a 
penalty. Each time this unwelcomed surprise has occurred, I had just bought a 
new property. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County tax assessor's office is supposed to send out the bills 
in October, but if it fails to do so, that's too bad, according to both my 
escrow office and the Long Beach office for tax information. The property owner 
has to pay the tax plus penalty -- this year it amounted to $178 over and above 
the basic rate. 
</P>
<P>
When I contacted an attorney to see if I had any rights, the secretary chuckled 
and said, "I don't know if we can help you." At that point, I decided to pay 
the penalty. Why pay a lawyer's fee if nothing can be done? 
</P>
<P>
This situation is a rip-off. Yet, I feel helpless and wonder how many others 
are being duped by our county tax structure. 
</P>
<P>
More importantly, who is pocketing all the excess in collected revenue?

'THEY REALLY DESERVE RAISE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every month or so you come up with an editorial on why you feel federal 
officials in the various branches of our government and members of Congress 
should get a raise ("They Really Deserve a Raise," June 22). You always state 
their base pay but say nothing of the many free trips officials take at 
taxpayers' expense, as well as all of the expensive perks they receive. In 
addition to this members of Congress have their lovely honorariums. 
</P>
<P>
I believe the taxpayers let it be known in no uncertain terms that they were 
tired of paying taxes to keep supporting these drones. Many of them have said 
that they could do much better in the private sector. I notice none of them 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
What we need is a good house-cleaning. We need statesmen in all branches who 
will serve for a two-year term and then return to the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
Then we would have people who would have to live with the laws they pass. This 
is, after all, a democracy and professional politicians are not conducive to 
remembering that they are not princes and princesses. 
</P>
<P>
Remember that former President Ronald Reagan was unhappy because he could only 
serve two terms. He said he wanted to do a lot more. Yes, I guess he did; he 
hadn't quite bankrupted the country yet but one more term would have done it. 
</P>
<P>
We the taxpayers didn't cause the savings and loan problems nor the HUD 
problems, etc., but we are going to have to pay the bill -- and with all of 
those expensive staff members they had to help them too! I say enough!

AMA ON THE OFFENSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leaders of the American Medical Assn. have unleashed a double national campaign 
opposing legislation that would place caps on doctor payments under Medicare 
and publicizing what they regard as the "deficiencies" of Canada's health 
system. It looks a bit like a reversion to the days when the AMA fought 
Medicare and Medicaid and vilified Britain's national health care. 
</P>
<P>
The sensitivity of organized medicine may be understandable. Both the target 
expenditures under consideration for physician payments in Medicare and the 
Canadian model of universal health insurance are methods of limiting what 
doctors can charge. Similar limits already have been applied to hospitals 
serving Medicare patients with resultant savings. 
</P>
<P>
What is less understandable is the deceptiveness of the campaign. Canadian 
medicine is being portrayed as "socialized," whatever that means, and as 
restrictive in care. The national and provincial governments do indeed play a 
part, but essentially it is universal insurance that rations care by limiting 
access to high technology in much the same way that American medicine rations 
care by excluding 37 million Americans from any form of health insurance. The 
expenditure targets for Medicare, recommended by the Physician Payment Review 
Commission created by Congress, is being portrayed also as a means of rationing 
care when it would be more accurate to say it is a means of rationing payments 
to doctors. It was proposed only when every other effort to contain medical 
inflation was circumvented by a proliferation of procedures, tests and other 
services. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian model is not likely to be translated to the United States, but 
American doctors would do well to recognize that it delivers care of equal or 
higher quality at substantially less cost. The expenditure targets for Medicare 
may not be a perfect answer, but they hold more promise than the practice 
guidelines now being advocated by some AMA officials.

INDIA TRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. government's response to the crisis in China has been, by all 
accounts, measured and resonable, supportive of democratic aspirations. Yet its 
response to the so-called "trade problem" with the vibrant democracy of India 
has been only slightly short of hysterical. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of supporting the attempts being made by India, which despite an 
autarkic past has liberalized imports, opened up hitherto unreachable markets 
and indulged market economics to an unprecedented extent, the Administration 
has sought to isolate these trends by threatening trade retaliation for those 
things that have not yet been done. How ridiculously shortsighted! 
</P>
<P>
Why is it that we always seem to cut off our collective nose to spite our face?

THE BILL COMES DUE ON IRAN AIR 655; 
</P>
<P>
THOUGH NOT OBLIGATED, U.S. SHOULD ACCEPT LIABILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID J. SCHEFFER, David J. Scheffer is a lawyer and a senior associate of 
the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the parlance of tort lawyers, strict liability is money in the bank. A 
defendant's denial of intent, negligence or culpability means little. Admitting 
mistakes means even less. The party that did the damage has to appear in court 
and usually has to pay. 
</P>
<P>
But between nations there are no hard and fast rules on strict liability, and 
rarely any obligation to face a panel of alien judges. Governments negotiate, 
barter, make excuses, deny wrongdoings and hide behind mistakes. Compensating 
the victims of a nation's tort or crime typically becomes a diplomatic hot 
potato. 
</P>
<P>
This is now the case with Iran Air Flight 655. One year ago today, 290 people 
aboard the Airbus plunged to their death in the waters of the Strait of Hormuz. 
The captain of the U.S. guided-missile cruiser Vincennes, which was battling 
some small Iranian gunboats, blew the commercial airliner out of the sky. He 
acted on the mistaken belief that the Airbus was an Iranian F-14 fighter 
descending to attack. 
</P>
<P>
The Vincennes' radars had recorded Flight IR-655 ascending in the commercial 
air corridor. Human error had fed the wrong information to the captain. 
</P>
<P>
The United States claims that the missile firing was a "lawful act of 
self-defense." The State Department refuses to concede any legal liability to 
Iran, and condemns the Iranian authorities for allowing a commercial jet to fly 
over a warship engaged in battle. 
</P>
<P>
Washington was quick to offer compensation to the victims' families for 
humanitarian purposes. It insisted that the payments be made ex gratia -- a 
gift that did not imply any legal obligation -- and that they bypass the 
Iranian government. No way has yet been found to do that. 
</P>
<P>
Several weeks ago, Iran had the gall to sue in the World Court. The Tehran 
regime wants the United States declared an outlaw and held liable for 
compensating the Iranian government directly. 
</P>
<P>
Hypocrisy is a way of life with the Iranian authorities. They refused to appear 
in the World Court 10 years ago when Washington sought the release of American 
hostages in Tehran. Since then, Iran's leaders have sponsored international 
terrorism, spurned the United Nations as the forum for grievances and waged a 
horrific war with Iraq, attacked neutral shipping and laid mines in the Persian 
Gulf, and called for the assassination of novelist Salman Rushdie. Now they 
invoke international law and repair to the World Court to squeeze a fast buck 
out of Uncle Sam. 
</P>
<P>
As two-faced as Iran's mullahs are, President Bush faces an excruciating 
decision: Should the United States defend itself in the World Court or simply 
ignore Iran's politically charged claims? 
</P>
<P>
An American no-show would grant Iran a gratuitous propaganda victory and 
denigrate the authority of the World Court. Most likely the State Department 
could get the case thrown out on procedural grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The United States is in a strong position to easily hold its own against Iran. 
Washington apologized, offered to compensate the victims, investigated the 
incident thoroughly and cooperated fully with the International Civil Aviation 
Organization, which concluded that the Vincennes' action did not violate 
aviation conventions. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Bush might spurn the World Court. Ever since the Reagan 
Administration walked out of the Hague to protest Nicaragua's claim of 
illegality in U.S. aid to the Contras, the State Department has opposed 
submitting to the World Court any case that involves the use of military force. 
The last thing Bush wants is for the World Court to muck around again in the 
rules governing warfare, rendering an adverse decision that would further 
hamper the flexible use of U.S. military might overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Many members of Congress have opposed unconditional payments to compensate for 
the downing of Iran Air 655. Going to the World Court would earn Bush no favor 
on Capitol Hill and even less from an American public that continues to be 
repelled by Iran's lawless behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the government is setting a bad precedent in its retreat behind a wall 
of excuses to avoid any legal responsibility for the downing of Flight 655. If 
the plane in fact had been a diving F-14, then destroying it in self-defense 
would have been perfectly legal. But if the fear of an attack proves illusory, 
and innocent lives on a commercial airliner are lost, then it is in the 
interest of the United States to admit some legal responsibility up front and 
pay fair compensation to the injured government and victims, even if the 
government is as lawless as Iran's. 
</P>
<P>
That, after all, is the standard the United States has held other governments 
to for 40 years. Washington has repeatedly claimed that the shooting down of 
military or commercial aircraft, or attacks on U.S. Navy vessels on the open 
seas, are violations of international law, and that the responsible state must 
pay reparations directly to the injured government. Because so many Americans 
fly on foreign carriers, the United States is typically at the forefront of 
condemning attacks on any commercial airliners. 
</P>
<P>
Washington has not excused Iraq from legal liability for firing (presumably by 
accident) an Exocet missile at the U.S. frigate Stark in the Persian Gulf two 
years ago, killing 37 servicemen. Iraq recently agreed to pay $27.3 million to 
the U.S. government on behalf of the victims' families. The State Department 
had said that such payments would not be regarded as ex gratia -- made without 
legal obligation. 
</P>

If an American or European commercial airliner had been mistakenly shot down 
over the Persian Gulf by an Iranian gunboat captain who believed he was under 
attack by U.S. fighter aircraft, Washington would have been the first to label 
the action a violation of international law and demand that Iran accept 
responsibility and pay reparations. 
</P>
<P>
A standard of strict liability, reasonably applied, may gnaw at the U.S. Navy's 
pride. But it will enhance the safety of commercial air travel and the 
credibility of acts of self-defense.

DEMOCRACY ADDS TO STRIFE OVER KOREAN ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Endowment for International Peace in Washington.

South Koreans are worried that their economy is in deep trouble. It is, but the 
real challenges are more complex than just the economy. The process of 
transforming a rigid and inflexible social and political system with a matching 
economic structure into a democratic one that depends on compromise, 
flexibility and accommodation is producing increasing tumult and unease at all 
levels of Korean society. 
</P>
<P>
The economic symptoms are declining growth (from 12% in 1988 to 6%-7% this 
year) and rising unemployment (3.4% in the first quarter from 2.5% a year 
earlier), and inflation (officially 7% but almost certainly double-digit 
according to both private and some official observers in Seoul). Wage increases 
averaged nearly 20% in 1988 and will be well above that in 1989. New investment 
in manufacturing facilities and output was virtually zero in early 1989, and 
the current account balance appears likely to fall by 40% this year. A broad 
June, 1989, survey showed 63% of foreign buying offices in Korea considering 
procuring elsewhere because of price rises. 
</P>
<P>
President Roh Tae Woo has privately described South Korea as being on the way 
to becoming an Asian Argentina. In mid-June he told his economic ministers that 
"our economic achievements of the past 30 years will burst like a bubble" if 
the slide toward stagflation is not halted, and threatened to fire them all. 
His principal economic manager, Deputy Prime Minister Cho Soon, complained to a 
group of key economic advisers at the end of May, "Someone has to find a 
solution!" "But," said one of those present, "the 'someone' has got to be you, 
sir." 
</P>
<P>
Cho's mid-June "solution" was a 10% ceiling on wage increases, a freeze of the 
won to prevent further deterioration in export competitiveness, plus more loans 
for exports and incentives for Korean industrialists to "buy Korean." But the 
wage ceiling is currently unenforceable, and holding the won in place, pushing 
exports and encouraging "local purchasing" are not only old policies, but are 
likely to increase trade frictions with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the proposed package did help brace the economy, much more is needed 
than tinkering with tax or monetary or trading rules. The longer-term challenge 
is to reallocate wealth and benefits from the enormous growth of the economy 
over the last three decades in a way that will support non-inflationary 
increases in consumption. Further, it is to formulate and pass legislation that 
readjusts fundamental Korean relationships among producers, workers and 
consumers in ways that will cut across the grain of most politicians -- 
including the opposition -- and bureaucrats who have grown up on the economic 
patterns of the past. 
</P>
<P>
During a June visit to Seoul, I found striking agreement among politicians, 
businessmen, opposition leaders and economists that inequitable distribution of 
wealth is becoming a central and increasingly explosive issue, and that Roh and 
the National Assembly are failing to face up to this. It is not that annual 
income disparities are that uneven or out of line with other Asian countries 
but that the distribution of total assets is horrendously so. This has grown, 
as a senior corporate executive acknowledged, to a point where it is "corroding 
the moral order." The five largest Korean chaebol (conglomerates), still 
overwhelmingly controlled by their founding families, hold assets equaling 
nearly 45% of the gross national product. 
</P>
<P>
A Presbyterian minister active in opposition politics and a senior corporate 
executive describe the entire society -- led by more than one-third of the 
population that lives in the huge greater Seoul metropolitan area -- as 
desperate to consume more. The poorer sectors, seeing the rich consume, strive 
for more money. 
</P>
<P>
A former government official agrees with the minister that traditional moral 
values in Korea are changing rapidly to demand greater equity, more concern for 
the environment, more attention to the health and welfare of the individual. 
</P>
<P>
The conservative director of a major government economic research institute 
bitterly complains that workers don't care whether their company can pay or 
their skills justify the wage levels they demand. A liberal labor mediator 
confirms that this is true from recent conversations with striking Daewoo 
Shipyard workers. 
</P>
<P>
There is a nationwide movement by workers to take advantage of their rights to 
bargain with management for a bigger share of the pie. They see press reports 
that 1988 corporate profits were up an average of 38%. They are unimpressed by 
explanations about the meaning of "average." 
</P>
<P>
One Korean commentator sees an effort to catch up all at once with every social 
and welfare benefit that workers in other countries have won over decades. 
There is no long-term government labor policy that is looking at how to respond 
to this. The chaebols, with only rare exception, are resisting adjustment to 
the new mood in labor. They insist on year-by-year labor contracts, thus 
assuring unrest each year. They are determined to fight any change in 
antiquated labor or tax laws and want the police to be used to support their 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
Land prices have skyrocketed, some say doubling in the last six months, driven 
by a search for inflation-resistant assets. A senior government economic 
manager criticizes the flow of huge corporate assets into land and stocks. A 
rapidly rising proportion of corporate profits now come from these investments, 
rather than from productive assets. Huge assets are disguised in under-assessed 
land, which is taxed at a tiny fraction of real value. This is spreading 
corruption more widely than ever before and breeding new political cynicism. It 
is no surprise that everyone accepts, and government officials privately admit, 
that official inflation figures seriously underestimate the real rate of 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
At the very least, there is a growing perception gap between Americans, who 
perceive Korea as flourishing even if it has some temporary problems, and South 
Koreans who see a more serious crisis looming. In this atmosphere, tough U.S. 
pressures on Korea to continue to open its markets, even if technically 
well-based, will inevitably become progressively abrasive unless we take full 
account of the internal changes taking place. 
</P>
<P>
Koreans have claimed in the past that they were approaching economic crises and 
each time emerged stronger and more economically competitive. This could happen 
again. But we may now be witnessing the emergence of a new and real crisis of 
social change, generated to a considerable degree by the very democratic 
pressures we have strongly urged.

Dubai officials turned back part of a chemical cargo ordered by Iran through a 
Duesseldorf firm, West German sources said in Bonn. About 257 tons of thionyl 
chloride, which can be used to make mustard gas, was ordered by Iran through 
Rheineisen Chemical Products, which is under investigation in West Germany's 
second chemical arms export scandal in the last six months. The Bonn sources 
said Dubai officials who inspected the ship over the weekend found six 
containers of the Indian-made chemical on board, a fraction of the amount 
ordered. They ordered the ship to return its cargo to Bombay.

Civil rights leaders in Atlanta commemorated the day their movement became law 
by praying at the crypt of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and challenging President 
Bush to live up to his stated commitment to their cause. "Mr. Bush has got to 
get up and make the White House the right house," said the Rev. Joseph Lowery, 
president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. "It's not enough to 
talk that talk. We need him to walk that walk." The SCLC was marking the 25th 
anniversary of the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned 
segregation in public facilities and has been used in court actions against 
discrimination in the workplace. Lowery said recent Supreme Court decisions 
against affirmative action programs have left black leaders doubting that the 
President would work to protect progress made under the law.

Ringed by Coast Guard vessels and a tugboat with pollution booms aboard, a 
Greek tanker began its journey to dry dock, nine days after hitting a rock and 
spilling 420,000 gallons of oil into the ocean near Newport, R.I. A 
Narragansett Bay pilot was aboard as the World Prodigy made its way out of the 
treacherous waters surrounding Brenton Reef. The tanker's captain, who faces 
federal charges of violating pollution laws, has admitted he made a mistake in 
not having a pilot aboard when the accident occurred on the afternoon of June 
23. The ship will be repaired at New York Shipyard Corp., on the site of the 
old Brooklyn Navy Yard.

A total of 6,400 American military personnel and civilians finished moving over 
the weekend onto U.S. bases in Panama, widening the rift with the regime of 
Gen. Manuel A. Noriega. The U.S. military's Southern Command said the move is 
intended to "maintain a low military profile in the face of harassment by the 
Panamanian Defense Forces in recent months." It also seems designed to increase 
pressure on Noriega to step down by depriving the battered economy of about $60 
million a year that the Americans were spending. Instead, they will make 
purchases at facilities within the Southern Command. The move was ordered in 
May by the Defense Department when violence broke out after the May 7 
presidential election.

A car bomb exploded in a housing area at a British military base in Hanover, 
West Germany, killing a soldier and injuring his wife and four children, 
officials said. There was no claim of responsibility for the attack, but 
officials suspect the outlawed Irish Republican Army, which is fighting to end 
British rule in Northern Ireland. The bomb went off as the man opened the door 
of the car while his family waited to get in, police said. Officials said bomb 
disposal experts found another explosive device in the area and defused it. It 
was the second attack in two weeks on a British installation in West Germany. 
In Northern Ireland, meanwhile, three explosions occurred at Belfast's Harbor 
Airport, damaging two aircraft but apparently causing no injuries.

Customs inspectors at the Calexico border crossing grew suspicious about a 
woman in a van, pulled her over and found 416 pounds of marijuana and 43 pounds 
of cocaine hidden in the vehicle, authorities said. Susana Robles Sanchez, 35, 
a U.S. citizen living in El Centro, was arrested on suspicion of attempting to 
import a controlled substance, customs officials said. If convicted, she could 
face a prison sentence of 10 years to life and a fine of up to $4 million. 
Customs inspectors would say only that agents noted that "the circumstances 
were similar to established smuggling profiles" when they halted the van. After 
a dog trained to sniff out narcotics gave strong indications that drugs were in 
the van, agents searched the vehicle and found a false compartment under the 
floor, authorities said.

BLYLEVEN LEAVES WITH LEAD BUT BULLPEN FALTERS

<P>
A lot of the Twins have spent much of the last four days looking over their 
shoulders -- or down at their shoes -- waiting for the inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a red-haired guy with a cream pie sneaking up behind me? Was that a 
whiff of smoke? Are my shoelaces on fire yet? 
</P>
<P>
But Bert Blyleven, baseball's premier prankster, was laying low and "saving all 
my tricks for Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe he should have broken out the lighter fluid and broken the ice. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven was admittedly pumped up for his return to the town where he pitched 
for more than three seasons and helped win a World Series in 1987. He pitched 
seven scoreless innings Sunday but was too emotionally spent to continue and 
Minnesota rallied in the eighth for a 2-1 victory before 49,098 in the 
Metrodome. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' first batter of the game scored against left-hander Frank Viola, 
but he gave up only two hits after the first inning, struck out seven and went 
the distance to improve to 7-8. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven threw only 83 pitches, but there was much stress per pitch. He worked 
out of a bases-loaded, one-out jam in the first, a two-on, one-out threat in 
the fourth and a first-and-third, one-out situation in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
"My shoulder started to stiffen up in the seventh," Blyleven said. "But mainly 
I was just emotionally drained. I don't know how many pitches I threw, but it 
felt like more than that. Sometimes, you can throw 150 pitches and still feel 
good, but this was a one-run game and I never had a chance to relax. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a firm believer in going as hard as you can for as long as you can, but it 
was mental more than physical this time. After seven, I just thought I'd had 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
The Twins might not have been too happy when Blyleven was traded to the Angels 
for three minor leaguers during the offseason, but they were glad to see him 
leave the Metrodome mound this time. 
</P>
<P>
Al Newman led off the eighth with a double down the right-field line off 
reliever Rich Monteleone and, one out later, Kirby Puckett doubled high off the 
wall in right to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
Bob McClure then replaced Monteleone and walked Kent Hrbek. Willie Fraser came 
in next, gave up a run-scoring single to Gary Gaetti and the Twins were in a 
position to avert a four-game sweep by the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Viola, as he had done five other times on this afternoon, retired the Angels in 
order in the ninth. The 1988 Cy Young Award winner had struggled early this 
season, but he has given up only one run in his last 26 innings and has won 
three in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels scored when Dick Schofield and Johnny Ray opened the first with 
back-to-back singles. The runners advanced on Devon White's sacrifice and 
Schofield scored on Wally Joyner's ground-out to second. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven (7-2) lowered his league-leading earned-run average to 2.16, but for 
the third consecutive outing came away with a no-decision. In his last three 
starts, the 38-year-old right-hander has one complete game and has given up 
only two runs -- but has nothing to show for it in the win column. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed, yes," Blyleven said. "You don't ever like to lose a game. 
But I didn't want to go out and make a mistake and create a big inning. And I'd 
rather have the bullpen start an inning than step into a problem. I went as 
hard and as long as I could and it just didn't work this time. I'll be pitching 
against Frankie (Viola) again Friday (in Anaheim) and maybe it'll work out 
differently." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels are hoping Blyleven isn't quite as pumped up for that outing. He's 
normally as loose as a clown's pants, but his teammates got their first view of 
a different, tightly wound Blyleven this week. 
</P>
<P>
"He was pretty excited," catcher Bill Schroeder said. "You could tell by a lot 
of little things he did. He's been talking about how he was going to pitch to 
these guys, which he usually doesn't do, for a couple of days. And yesterday, 
we didn't hear a peep out of him on the bench during the game, which is really 
weird. But I thought he was throwing as well in the last couple of innings as 
he did in the early innings. In fact, the location of his fastball was probably 
better in the late innings." 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven needed only 19 pitches to dispatch the Twins in the sixth and seventh, 
and that included three strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
"Bert did a tremendous job," Manager Doug Rader said. "But he put a lot of 
emotion into every pitch and that takes its toll. He's a very strong human 
being and he gave it all he had. 
</P>
<P>
"Heck, we got beat by a fantastic pitcher. Frank Viola has as much talent as 
anyone in the league. We can't let this game put a damper on this trip. We won 
four of six games and had a chance to win all six." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Kent Anderson made his major league debut as an outfielder Sunday, 
replacing Tony Armas, who had been filling in for Claudell Washington. Armas, 
who has a history of leg problems, needed the day off, according to Manager 
Doug Rader. And Washington was undergoing tests at Centinela Hospital to 
discover the cause of a lingering shin infection. Anderson said before the game 
that he saw the lineup card and thought the nine (designating right field) next 
to his name was a "six upside down." Six designates shortstop. "The only time 
I've ever played outfield was during the exhibition game at Midland (last 
month) when I replaced (coach) Joe Coleman in left," Anderson said. "I never 
even played out there in high school or Little League. I'm just going to go out 
there see what happens and have some fun." The Angels didn't take batting 
practice Sunday, but Armas took Anderson out to right and showed him a few 
things -- like how the ball comes off the trash-bag-like wall. Anderson handled 
the only two fly balls hit to right, played one ball off the wall and one in 
the corner cleanly and made a nice throw to the plate on Randy Bush's single to 
right in the eighth to keep the bases loaded and stop the Twins from scoring a 
third run.

DARK VICTORY FOR DODGERS: TUDOR IS HURT; 
</P>
<P>
LEFT-HANDER QUITS AFTER 3 INNINGS; GONZALEZ STARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD HOFFER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Dodgers got three shutout innings out of John Tudor but that development 
figures to be less encouraging than you might think. In fact, Tudor's comeback 
from elbow surgery appears to have been stalled again. 
</P>
<P>
Tudor, in only his second start since elbow surgery last October, left the game 
with pain in his left shoulder. This was not a new pain and it is apparently 
unrelated to the reconstructive work that was done on his elbow. It's just that 
each time out, it hurts a little more. 
</P>
<P>
Tudor's pain was mostly private as the Dodgers got terrific relief from the 
bullpen and three RBIs from Jose Gonzalez to beat the Pittsburgh Pirates, 3-2, 
Sunday at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
This is a two-game winning streak -- the Dodgers are undefeated in July -- and 
the second game in a row that Gonzalez has produced the winning run, one way or 
another. The news might have been the emergence of Gonzalez, whose two-run 
homer Sunday proved an improvement over his bad-hop winner of the day before. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward Manager Tom Lasorda was enthusiastic about Gonzalez in particular, 
saying: "He's putting the bat on the ball now and he's more disciplined." 
</P>
<P>
About the run production from the lower half of the batting order in general, 
Lasorda said: "Now if we can just get some runs from the other guys." 
</P>
<P>
And about another nice three innings of relief from rookie John Wetteland, 
Lasorda said: "That was a big performance today, one we needed desperately." 
</P>
<P>
However, Lasorda avoided the question of Tudor, the Dodgers' $1.3 million man, 
saying he'd know more today after Dr. Frank Jobe examined him. "I just don't 
know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody does. Tudor felt the shoulder go in the second inning, on a 3-2 pitch to 
Andy Van Slyke that the Pirate took for ball four. He got out of that inning 
after loading the bases but retired to the dressing room to think matters over. 
</P>
<P>
"I came in here and thought about it," he said, "to try and decide what to do. 
I thought I'd go back for another inning." 
</P>
<P>
Tudor appeared to sail through the third, giving up only a single to John 
Cangelosi. But he decided to give it up. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't make a lot of sense to go back out when, if I give up two or three 
hits, we can lose the ball game," he said. "Plus, I didn't have anything on the 
ball. I was down to all change-ups." 
</P>
<P>
Afterward Tudor seemed to question his value to the team, if all he could 
provide were three or four innings. Four was all he could manage in his season 
debut last week and Sunday's three seemed to signal an unwelcome trend. 
</P>
<P>
"If it feels like three innings then I'm not going to do it," he said. "Like 
today, it took three or four guys out of the bullpen. That's not fair to them. 
As much as I want to pitch, I don't want to do that to anybody. To pitch three 
innings and then run the bullpen behind a guy, that's not fair. To take up a 
spot and not do a job, I won't do it." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers have been relying a lot on the bullpen anyway. Lasorda keeps trying 
to give Jay Howell some kind of rest, for example, but just hasn't been able 
to. 
</P>
<P>
When Howell closed out the Pirates in a strange ninth inning for his 15th save, 
it was another case of an off day turning into a work day. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he has been counting how many times he's been up to warm up in the 
last week, he said, "I'd rather not." 
</P>
<P>
Howell only faced two batters, blowing Dann Bilardello away on a curve with two 
on for the final out. But he pointed out that the toll on a pitcher's arm is 
taken on the sideline as he warms up. 
</P>
<P>
"And unfortunately you can't cheat out there," he said. "You can't just lob it 
up there." 
</P>
<P>
It was Wetteland who immediately relieved Tudor, and although he gave up a 
Pittsburgh run in the fourth when Van Slyke singled Glenn Wilson in -- this 
after a wild pitch advanced Wilson to third -- he turned in another two 
scoreless innings to get the victory, his second in as many decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Then Tim Belcher, who had relieved and won the day before, came in for his 
shot. He took the game into the ninth inning when he allowed singles by Wilson 
and Rey Quinones. 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Horton came in and, in the only bullpen disappointment of recent days, 
walked Barry Bonds and Wilson scored on ball four, which got away from Mike 
Scioscia for a passed ball. Howell came in to get R.J. Reynolds and Bilardello 
and put a lid on that little rally. 
</P>
<P>
For the second game in a row, all offensive duties were left to Gonzalez. 
Lasorda had been on him to quit swinging for the fences, to just meet the ball. 
</P>
<P>
This worked fine Saturday when a sinking line drive toward second turned into a 
game-winning RBI. 
</P>
<P>
But it worked better Sunday. In the fifth inning, with Jeff Hamilton on, 
Gonzalez met Pirate starter Doug Drabek (5-6) with a shot over the left-field 
fence. This was his first home run since 1986, a minor surprise to all. 
</P>
<P>
"I made one mistake and that was the game," Drabek said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Gonzalez: "I was just trying to make contact." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez, now hitting .369, is happy enough just to be doing that. Last year at 
this time, he "figured my chances with the Dodgers were finished. But (General 
Manager) Mr. Fred Claire told me to be patient." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates were not surprised to learn that Dodger left-hander John Tudor had 
been hurting. Manager Jim Leyland noticed Tudor kept cranking his left arm, as 
if to develop more freedom of movement. "It looked to me he was fighting 
something the whole game." . . . The only spark the Pirates showed was in the 
ninth. After Glenn Wilson singled, he decided to take second on Andy Van 
Slyke's drive to left. The Dodgers' Kirk Gibson almost threw him out at second. 
Then, when Dodger third baseman Jeff Hamilton couldn't fight off Rey Quinones' 
grounder, Wilson hesitated and stayed at third. He came in on Mike Scioscia's 
passed ball. . . . If the Dodgers are getting runs from the lower half of the 
order, from Jose Gonzalez anyway, they are not getting much elsewhere. The 
vaunted trio of Gibson, Eddie Murray and Mike Marshall has not been producing. 
Gibson, after going 0 for 4 Sunday, has just five hits in his last 54 at-bats. 
Marshall, newly activated, was hitless again. . . . Tudor, asked why he was 
putting himself through the pain of his comeback, said: "Well, they're paying 
me a lot of money to go through this."

TAMMIE GREEN'S FIRST LPGA WIN IS A MAJOR TRIUMPH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tammie Green made her first LPGA victory a big one, holding off Pat Bradley and 
Betsy King for a one-shot victory at the $600,000 du Maurier tournament in 
Montreal, the third of the year's four majors. 
</P>
<P>
Green, in her third year on the tour, shot a par-72 at the 6,261-yard 
Beaconsfield Golf Club for a four-round total of nine-under-par 279. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, a three-time champion, matched the best score of the day and the 
tournament with a 67 but could only manage a share of second with King, this 
year's leading money-winner, who closed with a 70. 
</P>
<P>
Patty Sheehan and 1979 winner Amy Alcott shot 69s and were next at 281. 
</P>
<P>
Green, the 1987 rookie of the year, won $90,000 and has $172,821 in winnings 
this year. Her previous best was second at last year's Sara Lee tournament and 
this year's Dinah Shore, the first of the majors. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a big, dark cloud has just passed," Green said of her first LPGA 
victory. "I've had this frustration of not winning one when I thought my game 
was good enough to win. Then to win a major is the best way." 
</P>
<P>
Mark McCumber and Peter Jacobsen finished in a tie after 72 holes and a 3 
1/2-hour rain delay and will finish the $1 million Western Open golf tournament 
at Oak Brook, Ill. with a sudden-death playoff today. 
</P>
<P>
The two came down the stretch tied through the last three holes and decided not 
to have the playoff for the top prize of $180,000 until this morning because of 
darkness. 
</P>
<P>
McCumber shot a final-round 69 for a 72-hole total of 13-under-par 275 and 
Jacobsen had a 68 as both broke the Butler National Western record of 276 set 
by Tom Weiskopf in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Azinger shot a 69 and missed the playoff by one shot. 
</P>
<P>
Briton Nick Faldo birdied the last hole in the final round of the $472,000 
French Open golf tournament at Chantilly, France, for a one-under-par 69 and a 
one-stroke victory to retain the title he has won four times.

DAUGHTER'S READING LESSON FUELS MOODY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
LIGONIER, Pa. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Orville Moody scored his only victory on the regular PGA tour, in the 1969 
U.S. Open, his daughter, Michelle, hadn't been born. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years later, Moody has won the U.S. Senior Open -- and given the credit 
to his caddy, 19-year-old Michelle. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't have won this tournament if it hadn't been for my daughter," Moody 
said Sunday after defeating Frank Beard by two strokes. 
</P>
<P>
"Neither one of us read the greens the first two days, but beginning yesterday 
when I shot the 64, she did the job. I not only enjoy having her with me, but 
she's responsible for me winning. 
</P>
<P>
"She's had a wonderful time. In fact, you guys have given her more ink than you 
did me. She's famous." 
</P>
<P>
How does Sunday's victory compare to winning the U.S. Open? 
</P>
<P>
"This is great," he said, "but there's no comparison in the two. When I won the 
U.S. Open, it made me a lot of money for the next 15 years." 
</P>
<P>
It was an eagle on the last hole of the third round that gave Moody a tie for 
the lead and it was another eagle, on a 30-foot putt, that gave him the lead 
for good on the sixth hole Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The eagle put Moody ahead of Beard, the co-leader after 54 holes, and he went 
on to shoot a two-under 70 to win the $80,000 first prize with a 279, nine 
under par over the Laurel Valley Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody except Beard ever challenged on the last day on a course that dried out 
a little more each day and was tougher the last two days. Beard, who took the 
lead when Moody bogeyed the first hole, hung on after the eagle gave Moody the 
lead at No. 6, but never was even again. 
</P>
<P>
Beard shot a 72, the only round he didn't play under par, and finished at 281. 
Dale Douglass shot a 67 to finish in a tie with Jim Dent for third at 284. 
Twelve players finished the 72 holes under par. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the eagles, a birdie at 501-yard, par-five No. 11 was crucial 
for Moody. 
</P>
<P>
Both he and Beard tried to reach the green in two shots. Moody put his second 
shot through the green, near a tree. Although Beard landed in a bunker, he was 
pin high and in a better position to go for the birdie. 
</P>
<P>
However, Beard barely got out of the trap and missed his long birdie putt. 
Moody chipped to within 9 feet, sank the putt with his long-handled putter and 
was never in trouble again. 
</P>
<P>
"The outcome might have been different because I bogeyed one and Frank had four 
good chances for birdies early and they just failed to drop, Moody said. 
"Overall, I think he was playing better that I was. 
</P>
<P>
"But when that 30-footer trickled in for the eagle, it started my blood going 
and it gave me some fire. This was a tougher course today, so I was more than 
satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
It was on the 18th Saturday that Moody shot his way into a chance to win. It is 
a par-five that is a dogleg over a large body of water. A good tee shot enables 
the player to go for the green in two. Moody hit what he called a perfect shot, 
a slicing five-wood around the trees that ended up 12 feet from the pin to set 
up the eagle. 
</P>
<P>
With a two-shot lead, Moody was not about to go for the green Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I like Frank and I think he's a great guy," Moody said. "But I wasn't about to 
let him back in the tournament. Even if he had been able to go for the green in 
two (Beard couldn't because he drove into the rough), he would have had to be 
awful close to the pin for me to have gambled." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before both pitched to the green on their third shots, Beard and Moody 
had a conversation and then laughed. What was it about? 
</P>
<P>
"Frank said there were 2,000 coaches who wanted me to go for the green," Moody 
said of the gallery. "I said, 'No way.' Frank said, 'Make that 2,001, who 
wanted you to.' " 
</P>
<P>
Although he says he doesn't play nearly as well as he did when he was on the 
regular tour -- when he played well but had trouble putting, Moody acknowledged 
he is on the hottest streak of his career. In the last five weeks, he has won 
twice, including the Senior TPC, finished second twice and was 10th in the 
other tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Douglass quipped that even if the United States Golf Assn. was to outlaw 
long-handled putters such as Moody's, which is 50 inches long, the seniors 
money leader ($318,923) would make so much money in the next few years that it 
wouldn't make any difference. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned a long time ago not to worry about things I have no control over," 
Moody said of a possible ban. "Maybe by the time they do ban it, I won't be on 
the tour. All I know is the putter has done wonders for me." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't too surprising that Beard seemed content with his second-place 
finish. After all, he has been away from competitive golf for eight years. 
Already he has two second-place finishes in eight senior events. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I wanted to win," he said, "and if some putts had dropped I could have. 
But it is still a surprise to me I am doing this well. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just that. My life was a mess when I left the tour, emotionally and 
otherwise. I remarried, straightened out my life and now I know I can play on 
this tour. I was close to Orville Moody, the best player on this tour, and if I 
can stay close to him, I'll make a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
After one of the worst showings of his career, Arnold Palmer was asked if he 
would retire. "You mean not play in any more tournaments?" he said. "No way. 
This was just a bad outing. I'll come out of it." . . . With a final round of 
77, Palmer finished at 312, 24 over par. . . . Palmer is committed to play in 
the West Classic at Ojai Valley in late November. 
</P>
<P>
Chi Chi Rodriguez, still trying to recover from a neck injury, wasn't eager to 
talk about his golf game. He had other things on his mind. "How come if they 
are going to outlaw the long-handled putter two years from now, it's legal 
now?" he asked. "It's like the baseball commissioner not suspending Pete Rose 
while he investigated the gambling." . . . Amateur Frank Boydston of Phoenix 
came to earth with a thud on the final round, shooting an 82. After an opening 
69 he finished at 305.

YOUNT, STILL GOING STRONG, GETS 2,500TH HIT IN BREWERS' 10-2 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Outfielder Robin Yount got his 2,500th career hit and drove in five runs to 
help the Milwaukee Brewers end a three-game losing streak by defeating the New 
York Yankees, 10-2, Sunday at New York. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels good to get 2,500," Yount said. "But I'm playing for the competition 
of the game. We really needed to win today." 
</P>
<P>
Yount homered in the fourth inning and got his 2,500th hit during the Brewers' 
six-runfifth inning with a two-run single. 
</P>
<P>
Yount reached the 2,500 mark at 33 years and 10 months. Ty Cobb was the 
youngest to reach 2,500 hits at 31 years and seven months. Pete Rose was 34 
when he got his 2,500th hit. 
</P>
<P>
Others to reach 2,500 hits at a younger age than Yount are Rogers Hornsby at 
33, Hank Aaron at 33 and four months and Mel Ott at 33 and five months. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to comprehend when you say names like that," Yount said. "My 
motivation right now is to get to a World Series." 
</P>
<P>
Don August (8-7) won for the sixth time in his last seven decisions. He lost 
his shutout in the eighth when Jesse Barfield and Mike Pagliarulo had 
run-scoring singles. 
</P>
<P>
Lance McCullers (3-3) lost his first start of the season after 27 relief 
appearances. His last start was in 1986 for San Diego. McCullers gave up six 
runs and five hits in four-plus innings. 
</P>
<P>
With the Brewers leading, 2-0, in the fifth inning, McCullers walked Gary 
Sheffield and Glenn Braggs to open the inning. Charlie O'Brien doubled then in 
and then scored on Jim Gantner's single off Jimmy Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Molitor's single and a throwing error by shortstop Wayne Tolleson put 
runners on second and third, and the Yankees walked Terry Francona 
intentionally. Yount singled in two runs and Greg Brock's sacrifice fly made it 
8-0. 
</P>
<P>
Yount, who went three for four, added another two-run single in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't cheat anyone. He plays hard all the time," Brewers Manager Tom 
Trebelhorn said of Yount. "He doesn't care one hoot about his stats. 
</P>
<P>
"Yount's not slowing down to me," Trebelhorn said. "He's got knee problems, but 
he's still playing center field and is our third-place hitter." 
</P>
<P>
The loss snapped the Yankees' three-game winning streak. But Don Mattingly 
extended his hitting streak to 15 with a single in the first. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 7, Baltimore 3 -- Mike Heath doubled home an unearned run that snapped 
a sixth-inning tie and Lou Whitaker hit a three-run homer as the Tigers beat 
the Orioles at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles, who have given up 12 unearned runs, the fewest in the major 
leagues this season, lost for the third time in four games and the sixth time 
in their last nine. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore remained 5 1/2 games ahead in the AL East while last-place Detroit 
won for the fourth time in its last six. 
</P>
<P>
Heath, who hit two homers in the first game of the series, greeted reliever 
Mark Williamson with a flare down the right-field line that drove in Chet 
Lemon, who had reached first on a throwing error by third baseman Craig 
Worthington. 
</P>
<P>
Whitaker hit his 17th homer in the ninth inning off Kevin Hickey. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 7, Kansas City 3 -- Harold Baines homered, drove in four runs and moved 
into second place on Chicago's all-time RBIs list, helping Greg Hibbard get his 
first major-league victory as the White Sox beat the Royals at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Baines, who also hit a two-run double and sacrifice fly, moved past Minnie 
Minoso with 809 RBIs. Luke Appling leads the White Sox with 1,116. 
</P>
<P>
Hibbard (1-2), making his seventh big-league start, yielded all three runs and 
seven hits in 5 1/3 innings. Donn Pall finished up for his fourth save. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 4, Toronto 1 -- Danny Heep hit Boston's first pinch-hit home run in more 
than two years, a three-run shot in the 11th, to lift the Red Sox over the Blue 
Jays at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Romine went five for five with two doubles for the first five-hit game of 
his career as the Red Sox extended their season-high winning streak to four 
straight. He singled and scored in the second inning and his two-out single in 
the 11th began Boston's winning rally. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Clemens, bidding for his 22nd career shutout, took a four-hitter and 1-0 
lead into the ninth. With one out, George Bell singled and Fred McGriff drove 
him in with a double. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Murphy (1-3) won for the first time since Sept. 27, 1987, a span of 115 
appearances. He pitched the 10th inning and Lee Smith worked the 11th for his 
11th save. 
</P>
<P>
Romine and Rich Gedman singled in the 11th against David Wells. Heep hit Tom 
Henke's first pitch over the right-field fence for his first home run since 
Aug. 17, 1986, when he was with the New York Mets. Boston's last pinch-hit 
homer was on June 1, 1987, by Mike Greenwell. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 11, Cleveland 3 -- Rickey Henderson hit the 37th leadoff home run of 
his career and Dave Parker homered and drove in four runs as the Athletics 
defeated the Indians at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Jamie Quirk also homered for the Athletics, who got 15 hits and completed a 
three-game sweep. Henderson had three hits and scored three times as every 
Oakland starter hit safely. 
</P>
<P>
Storm Davis (7-3) won his fifth consecutive decision. He has won four times 
since returning June 10 from a strained hamstring that sidelined him nearly a 
month. Davis allowed two runs and seven hits in seven innings. Bill Dawley 
pitched the final two innings.

NEWSWIRE: BETTING RECORDS CHALLENGED BY 'EXPERT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Chicago bookie told a Chicago newspaper that records of bets Pete Rose 
allegedly made should have been destroyed, or organized crime members would 
have placed a hit on the bookmaker. 
</P>
<P>
"Hanging on to records is stupid," the bookmaker, who did not want his name 
used, was quoted in the Chicago Sun-Times. "Not only would it be unfair to the 
customers and yourself, but the (outfit) would put you out of business for 
leaving evidence lying around. That's a ticket to the penitentiary." 
</P>
<P>
The comments were the latest in the wake of baseball's investigation into 
gambling allegations against Rose, manager of the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
John M. Dowd, a Washington attorney serving as baseball's special investigator, 
compiled a lengthy report with witnesses detailing Rose's gambling, including 
baseball games involving the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
Dowd's conclusion prompted Rose to file a lawsuit last month in which he he 
successfully blocked his scheduled hearing before Commissioner Bart Giamatti. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton County (Ohio) Common Pleas Judge Norbert A. Nadel has scheduled a 
hearing Thursday on a preliminary injunction that would prevent Giamatti from 
making a final determination on Rose indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
Part of baseball's evidence against Rose consists of documents alleged to be 
bookmakers' records of bets that Rose made. 
</P>
<P>
Robert R. Fuesel, formerly an IRS special agent now employed by a top private 
detective agency, told the paper: "The only possible excuse I can find for 
keeping records like that would be if the bookmakers planned to use them in the 
future against Pete Rose." 
</P>
<P>
During his deposition with Dowd on April 20-21, Rose repeatedly said he has 
never bet on baseball games. He also questioned the character and motives of 
those who claim he did. "Well, it's nobody that's got any credibility," Rose 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Dowd has publicly called Rose's credibility into question, concluding that 
evidence supports the accusations that Rose bet on his own team -- an offense 
that carries a lifetime ban from baseball.

CLIMBERS CONTEND THAT SOME REMOTE WILDERNESS AREAS NEED A MASS CLEANUP EFFORT

<TEXT>
<P>
Glenn Porzak, president of the American Alpine Club, offered a travel tip 
during the recent Mountain Summit: "If you want a wilderness experience, don't 
go to Mt. Everest." 
</P>
<P>
The thrust of the symposium was concern shared by some of the world's top 
mountaineers and rock climbers for their deteriorating environment. 
</P>
<P>
Reinhold Messner, an Italian mountaineer, was aghast at plans to build cable 
cars across Mt. Olympus in Greece. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Hill, the world's best woman rock climber, told of a runaway tendency in 
her exploding sport to "chip a hole if they reach a place they think is 
impossible to climb. People should be adapting to the environment rather than 
making the environment fit their needs." 
</P>
<P>
France's Jean-Claude Droyer said: "They're turning natural rocks into 
gymnasiums." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Hill of the U.S. National Park Service said that until recent cleanup 
efforts, Alaska's Mt. McKinley was so bad that a person could collect the 
discarded equipment and "equip an expedition to anywhere in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Darrell Knuffke, acting director of the Wilderness Society, said: "We're a 
people under siege from ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Several spoke of trash along the Khumbu Glacier, the main route to Everest and 
one-third of the Himalayas. 
</P>
<P>
Whom to blame? 
</P>
<P>
John Roskelley, America's top Himalayan climber, said, "It isn't the trekkers 
that deposit garbage. Climbers, yes -- (empty oxygen) bottles, boots, rope." 
</P>
<P>
Lou Whittaker, who with his twin brother Jim has led Himalayan expeditions for 
years, said: "In the 60s we'd go in and we would litter. We'd throw bottles 
around because we didn't think about those things back then . . . didn't think 
anybody else would ever be there." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Whittaker said, he has disciplined his own teams and worked with 
Nepalese officials to educate the natives about littering. 
</P>
<P>
"We tell 'em they're hired on the basis of keeping the trail clean and won't be 
paid if they don't," Whittaker said. 
</P>
<P>
On one expedition, he said, "We hired 80 porters to carry (our trash) out. It 
cost us a lot of money and we wound up $40,000 in the hole, but we left it 
clean." 
</P>
<P>
Sir Edmund Hillary, who with Sherpa guide Tenzing Norgay was the first to 
ascend Everest in 1953, last year proposed a five-year moratorium on 
expeditions to allow the mountains to regenerate. 
</P>
<P>
But others doubt it would work. The bacteria that break down human trash and 
body waste are not effective above 17,000 feet, so even biodegradable material 
lingers indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem is the yaks -- beasts of burden -- that bring in the equipment 
and remain to graze out the upper meadows. 
</P>
<P>
"I was there in '79 and we'd camp in meadows," Jeff Lowe said. "Now it's mud or 
dust." 
</P>
<P>
He has suggested that the yaks be employed not only to carry supplies in but to 
carry trash out. Roskelley, who likes to travel light, proposed that the local 
governments charge duty for excess gear brought in by large expeditions. 
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-70s, Whittaker said, he has seen cypress trees felled along the 
way by the native porters for firewood, although many expeditions were starting 
to bring in kerosene and propane for cooking. 
</P>
<P>
"We made some suggestions that they not burn the forests," Whittaker said. 
</P>
<P>
But Roskelley questioned how foreigners could tell the natives not to burn 
their own wood. 
</P>
<P>
"That's their right, these people whose culture depends on burning that wood," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Porzak, who visited the Khumbu last year, said there are just too many people 
entering the valley either to trek or climb these days. 
</P>
<P>
"I was blown away by the number of new lodges and tea houses that have been 
built there since I was last there in '81," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bob McConnell is a leader of the Everest Environmental Expedition that plans to 
go into the valley next year to collect trash and install refuse collection 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
Messner, creator of the "White Wilderness" concept, said the ultimate solution 
is a matter of education on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to have some places where human beings are not the center of the 
world," he said, "where nature is the center. People in Pakistan, in Nepal and 
other places are not thinking about what they're losing."

26 DIE IN ROAD CRASHES; 1,469 ARRESTED AS DRUNK DRIVERS 
</P>

Beatrice and Chester Green, a retired Burbank couple, always made a point of 
trying to avoid holiday traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother doesn't like to travel on holidays," their daughter, Cynthia 
Rasmussen, 29, of Reno, Nev., explained Sunday. "She would say, 'Who likes to 
deal with all of the traffic?' " 
</P>
<P>
But when the Greens were invited to spend the Fourth of July boating on Lake 
Havasu with their family, they couldn't resist. They loaded up their 1986 Capri 
with picnic coolers and lawn chairs, and headed out late Friday evening, hoping 
to beat the weekend rush. 
</P>
<P>
The decision had fatal consequences. The Greens, both in their late 60s, were 
killed in a head-on collision that claimed five lives early Saturday morning 
near Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Since the four-day holiday weekend began at 6 p.m. Friday, 26 people have been 
killed in traffic accidents throughout the state, the California Highway Patrol 
said Sunday morning. For the same period last year, 30 deaths were reported, 
officers said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Arrests 
</P>
<P>
Drunk driving arrests are up from last year with 1,469 people arrested by 
midday Sunday, compared to 1,413 at this time last year, the CHP said. This 
year's Fourth of July weekend runs through Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
CHP officials said the next available totals will be released this morning. 
</P>
<P>
"I just know what happens on holidays with increases in traffic flow and more 
drinking -- people are going to get killed. And that's a fact," CHP Sgt. Jim 
Pitsor said. 
</P>
<P>
But the Greens' three children, and a dozen grandchildren, could take no 
comfort in statistics. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all close," said 27-year-old grandson Christopher Koch. "They were 
healthy people who didn't deserve to die like they did." 
</P>
<P>
As family members sat around the Greens' dining room table Sunday afternoon, 
they reminisced about happier occasions and tried to piece together the chain 
of events that led to the catastrophic collision. 
</P>
<P>
"We just can't say enough good things," said daughter Brenda Green, 46, of 
Burbank, fingering a dainty white doily that was to have been a gift from her 
mother. "My dad never raised his voice. My mother never came to my house 
without bringing me something -- cookies or flowers." 
</P>
<P>
Beatrice and Chester Green were the third link in the family caravan heading 
out of town for the holiday, Brenda said. 
</P>
<P>
The Greens' son, Chester Green Jr., 43, of Burbank, his wife and their four 
children, led the pack in a Jeep that pulled the power 
</P>
<P>
boat. A granddaughter and her boyfriend were driving behind them and the Greens 
brought up the rear. 
</P>
<P>
At about 1:40 a.m., a car driven by Salvatore Parise, 56, swerved across the 
center divider on California 62, and smacked into the boat trailer before 
hitting the Greens' car head on, Brenda said. 
</P>
<P>
Parise, of Montebello, his wife, Filomena, 52, and daughter Mary, 20, were 
killed instantly, San Bernardino County coroner's officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Beatrice Green also died at the scene, officials said. Chester Green, a retired 
General Motors employee, remained conscious after the crash, pinned to the 
car's floorboard, daughter Brenda said. He died Saturday evening of internal 
injuries at Loma Linda University Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
No other members of the Green caravan were injured in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
The Greens were no strangers to the road, family members said. They often 
traveled to Reno to visit relatives, and recently took a cross-country trip to 
Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
When they weren't traveling, the Greens spent their days quietly around the 
house, family members said. They had one ritual -- going out for lunch every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
"They were always together," Brenda said. "They are going to be very missed."

DANGERS OF PARLORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
More than 1 million Americans a day bask in one of the 20,000 tanning salons in 
the United States -- greatly increasing their risk of skin cancer, an expert 
panel has concluded. 
</P>
<P>
"We are clearly recommending against the use of tanning parlors for cosmetic 
purposes," said David Bickers, a dermatologist who chaired a National 
Institutes of Health panel on sunlight, ultraviolet radiation and the skin. 
</P>
<P>
Tanning parlors have often been advertised as being safer than exposure to 
natural sunlight. That is because most tanning parlors rely on lights that 
produce ultraviolet A rays -- a longer wavelength thought to cause less damage 
than shorter-wavelength ultraviolet B rays. 
</P>
<P>
But the 14-member panel of experts noted in its report that some UVA lamps 
"generate more than five times" the amount of UVA radiation reaching the 
Earth's equator. "At these doses, even pure UVA is likely to have adverse 
biologic effects," the panel concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Only two states, California and Ohio, have any kind of consumer regulation of 
tanning salons. In both these states, consumers must read a statement about the 
risks of exposure and sign a release before entering the tanning booth. The 
panel called for other states to follow suit and issue similar regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest users of tanning parlors are adolescents and young adults, 
especially women, the panel noted. "We want to make sure that consumers know 
what they are doing," Bickers said. SALLY SQUIRES

<P>
ON BEACH, SLOPES OR IN SALONS, TANNING IS DANGEROUS, 14 SCIENCE EXPERTS 
CONCLUDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

section, in which this story originally appeared.

<TEXT>
<P>
Zonker Harris, the Doonesbury comic-strip character known for his great tan, 
got the message and went "pale" a few months ago. But for sun worshipers still 
denying the dangers of too much sun, a government panel issued a report 
recently that left no more room for doubt. 
</P>
<P>
The 14-member panel, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, spent two 
days examining the scientific evidence on the effects of sunlight and 
ultraviolet radiation on the skin. They concluded that tanning, whether it 
occurs on the beach, in a tanning parlor or on the ski slopes, is "deleterious 
to the skin." 
</P>
<P>
"Tanning is visible evidence of injury to the skin," said David Bickers, 
chairman of the panel and director of the Skin Diseases Research Center at Case 
Western Reserve University in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
That damage can be measured not just by sagging and wrinkling -- signs of early 
aging -- but also by an increased risk of skin cancer. Skin cancers caused by 
ultraviolet-radiation exposure, the kind found in sun rays, are now the most 
common form of cancer in the United States. In 1978, the latest year for which 
figures are available, half a million new cases of skin cancer were diagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
The panel said recently that this figure is "probably a gross underestimate 
(for the number of cases) in 1989." The reason: visits to the doctor for 
non-melanoma skin cancer treatment rose 50% in the past 10 years, at a time 
when visits for other ailments increased just 11%, reported Kenneth Kraemer, a 
dermatologist with the National Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of time spent baking in the sun is directly correlated with the risk 
of skin cancer. That is one reason why basal-cell carcinomas, the most common 
skin cancer found in Caucasians, form primarily on sun-exposed areas of the 
body, such as the face and neck. 
</P>
<P>
Basal-cell carcinoma and squamous-cell skin cancer are far less deadly than 
melanoma -- the most virulent type of skin cancer. "While the risk factors for 
melanoma . . . are less clear, it too has been associated with exposure to 
ultraviolet radiation," the panel concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Too much sun also causes changes in the immune system, and that may in turn 
increase the risk of other forms of cancer. Margaret L. Kripke, a researcher 
with M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, told the panel that only in the 
past several years have researchers discovered that ultraviolet radiation can 
modify immune function in animals. "There is increasing evidence that similar 
effects occur in humans exposed to UV radiation," Kripke said. 
</P>
<P>
For those who thought that they could simply slather on Retin-A to help erase 
sun-caused wrinkles and other damage, the panel's advice is that there is no 
proof that it works. "Available evidence is insufficient to recommend the use 
of Retin-A and similar compounds for treating sun-induced wrinkles," the panel 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Because people who use Retin-A must continue it for the rest of their lives, 
one concern about the drug is whether its long-term use also could pose a 
cancer risk. 
</P>
<P>
Ortho Pharmaceutical Co., the maker of Retin-A, said the company has completed 
studies of 2,000 patients who have used the drug to treat sun damage since 
1985. The results, not yet made public, will be submitted later this year to 
the Food and Drug Administration. "We are very confident about that data," an 
Ortho spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The best bet for preventing both premature aging and skin cancer is to minimize 
sun exposure, especially between the peak hours of 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., the 
panel advised. More than 60% of the ultraviolet rays reaching the Earth's 
surface do so during midday. 
</P>
<P>
Children and adolescents who spend a lot of time outdoors playing or involved 
in sports are the most likely to be affected during these peak hours. Studies 
show that more than half of all lifetime sun exposure occurs before age 18. 
</P>
<P>
For this reason, the panel advised parents and schools to change the time of 
outdoor activities. "Keep recess and recreation time away from those peak 
hours," Bickers said. 
</P>
<P>
Those who cannot avoid the sun need to take precautions when exposed, the panel 
said. They should start by wearing clothing "constructed of tight woven 
fabrics, long sleeves, long pants, (and the like)," they advised. 
</P>
<P>
The next step is frequent and liberal use of sunscreens, with sun-protection 
factors (SPF) of 15 or higher. But a sunscreen with a very high SPF rating is 
not necessarily that much more protective. "There is no evidence to suggest 
that a sunscreen with an SPF of 44 is twice as good as one with an SPF of 22," 
Bickers said. 
</P>
<P>
What most sunscreens do not do is guard against the effects of ultraviolet A 
radiation -- the longer-wave type known as UVA. Many studies in animals and 
humans suggest that UVB -- the shorter-wave ray -- is the more dangerous as far 
as causing cancer. But both types of rays penetrate the skin, and UVA is not 
without damaging effects, the panel noted. Studies of mice and guinea pigs 
show, for example, that UVA can damage DNA, cause redness and produce 
squamous-cell carcinoma. 
</P>
<P>
For this reason, the panel said, "combination sunscreens that are effective 
against UVB and UVA are preferable." Currently only one -- Photoplex, which 
offers extensive protection against both -- is on the market. It is available 
without prescription. Whatever sunscreen consumers choose, the panel said, 
should "be applied 30 minutes before exposure" and then frequently reapplied. 
Those living in the Sun Belt were advised to consider daily use of sunscreens 
for the best protection. 
</P>
<P>
The panel also advised people taking regular medication of any sort to check 
with their doctor before going into the sun. Among the drugs that can react to 
sunlight are some oral antibiotics, blood pressure medicine, drugs to suppress 
the immune system and anti-inflammatory medication. 
</P>
<P>
Worries about the possible cancer-causing effects of sunscreens themselves also 
surfaced in recent weeks. Lester Gurelik, a photochemist with the National 
Cancer Institute's Cancer Prevention and Control Branch, told the panel that a 
class of chemicals called benzophenones, which are found in many sunscreens, 
may themselves help promote cancer. With sun exposure, benzophenones "produce 
intermediate chemicals that cause reactions in the skin that normally cannot 
occur," Gurelik said. "These chemicals could potentially cause damage that 
might promote cancer." 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing the current scientific evidence, however, the panel said 
benefits of sunscreens clearly outweigh their risks. Benzophenones have been 
used for 10 to 15 years, Bickers said. "The panel has considered this at great 
length," he said. "At the moment, the use of sunscreens is (deemed) safe." 
</P>
<P>
Despite all their precautionary warnings about sun exposure, the panel said 
they are not advising Americans to live hermit-like existences indoors. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to lead a normal life," said Maria Turner, a panel member who 
practices dermatology at George Washington University Medical Center. "I tell 
my patients to adopt a more Spanish life style. Play tennis at 4 p.m. Swim at 5 
p.m., and children should not be out in the sun at noon." 
</P>
<P>
ANATOMY OF SKIN CANCER 
</P>
<P>
BASAL-CELL CARCINOMA 
</P>
<P>
May be a small pearly nodule, a red patch, or a smooth growth with a rolled 
border and an indented center. There may also be tiny blood vessels on the 
surface. Often on exposed areas, such as the back of hands and face, but may be 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SQUAMOUS-CELL CARCINOMA 
</P>
<P>
May be a thick, hard nodule with white or yellow scales, or a red, crusty 
patch. May ulcerate or bleed easily. Usually on exposed areas, including lips, 
but may be elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MALIGNANT MELANOMA 
</P>
<P>
Can be a lethal form of skin cancer. Usually a brown-black or multi-colored 
patch or nodule. Asymmetrical, raised shape, with an irregular border which may 
bleed easily. Usually on the upper back and also on the legs of women. 
</P>

IN BRIEF: MODERATE DRINKING MAY CUT STROKE RISK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Moderate consumption of alcohol may reduce the risk of suffering one type of 
stroke while heavy drinking may greatly increase the chances of suffering 
another kind, cardiologists at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Oakland 
reported last week in the journal Stroke. 
</P>
<P>
In a study of 100,000 California men and women, researchers found that those 
who consumed fewer than three alcoholic drinks a day appeared to be at a 
reduced risk of suffering a type of stroke caused by blood clots plugging an 
artery supplying the brain. However, people who consumed more than three drinks 
a day were four times as likely as those who drink less to have a more severe 
stroke in which brain hemorrhaging or bleeding occurs, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
Strokes occur when the blood supply to a part of the brain is cut off, either 
by blockage of a vessel or bleeding. Deprived of oxygen, nerve cells in the 
affected area of the brain die within minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing in this study to justify heavy drinking," said Dr. Arthur L. 
Klatsky. "What this means is that heavy drinkers should cut down, there's no 
reason for (those) who drink moderately and are in control of their drinking to 
change their habits and those who don't drink . . . should not drink to prevent 
a stroke," he said.

PIECEMEAL STREET WIDENING FORCES DRIVERS TO JOG AROUND JUTOUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

It's hard to miss Roger Curry's place when you drive along Mason Avenue in 
Chatsworth. His is the house with the front yard that sticks about 30 feet into 
the street -- the one that some motorists have to swerve to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
Curry's small dirt parcel is a "jutout," one of hundreds of pieces of unpaved 
land on street rights of way scattered along thoroughfares across the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners find themselves living on a jutout when the street is widened in 
front of neighboring properties, but not theirs. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1962, such widenings have been required of landowners applying for 
permission to build on lots facing streets that have not already been paved to 
their planned ultimate width. 
</P>
<P>
It is up to property owners to donate the land for the widening and pay for 
asphalt paving and concrete curbs, gutters and sidewalks, which can cost almost 
$20,000 for a 100-foot-wide lot. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles officials say jutouts exist because the city has to wait for 
landowners' money because it does not have the funds to widen every street 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
Property owners who have not built on their land since 1962 are not forced to 
widen streets or install sidewalks unless their jutout creates a safety hazard. 
But the accelerating pace of construction, replacing older Valley homes with 
new houses or condominiums, results in an increasing number of older streets 
being widened to their intended size on a piecemeal basis. That's causing the 
leftover land to jut out at motorists. 
</P>
<P>
Drivers on Louise Avenue in Encino face an obstacle course as they maneuver 
around 12 jutouts on both sides of the two-lane street along a half-mile 
section between the Ventura Freeway and Ventura Boulevard. One small jutout 
exists to preserve a 600-year-old oak tree. 
</P>
<P>
In the East Valley, countless jutouts extend from North Hollywood tract houses 
built in the 1940s and '50s along Tujunga and Vineland avenues and parts of 
Burbank Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
In the West Valley, jutouts at 1920s and '30s farmhouses cause motorists 
traveling on such streets as Woodlake Avenue in West Hills to squeeze into 
single lanes. 
</P>
<P>
The jutout in front of her house sticks out "like a sore thumb," said Betty 
Curry, whose jutout was formed about eight years ago when developers on both 
sides of her Mason Avenue home north of Devonshire Street widened the street as 
a tract-approval requirement. 
</P>
<P>
Roger and Betty Curry tried to eliminate their jutout by joining with the 
subdividers in widening the street. But Betty Curry said they were forced to 
drop that plan when city officials required that the couple also widen a side 
street next to their property as part of the deal. That would have required 
them to tear down their guest house. 
</P>
<P>
When their jutout was first formed, unsuspecting motorists traveling southward 
on Mason Avenue would occasionally drive into it, she said. After several 
errant drivers damaged their water and sewer lines, the Currys persuaded the 
city to install a reflectorized barricade at the edge of the jutout. That ended 
the problem, she said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say jutouts can be an inconvenience to drivers but are seldom a 
safety hazard. 
</P>
<P>
The most dangerous jutouts have long ago been paved over, said Jim Glasgow, the 
city Department of Public Works engineer in charge of street design for the 
Valley. In some cases, the city spent its own money rather than wait for 
adjoining property owners to get around to financing the work, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Owners not planning to redevelop their property any time soon can rid 
themselves of jutouts by petitioning the city to form an assessment district to 
handle the cost of road widening and sidewalk building. Payments, added to the 
property tax bills of jutout owners, can be spread out over 10 years, officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of eliminating a typical jutout from a 50-foot-wide lot ranges from 
$8,000 to $10,000, officials said. That pays for asphalt pavement, concrete 
curbs, gutters and driveway entrances, a sidewalk and decorative trees. 
</P>
<P>
The typical jutout-removal project takes about two years, counting the time 
needed to form an assessment district, draw up plans and do the actual 
construction. Some jutouts are far from typical, however. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have been trying since 1974 to remove a two-block-long jutout on 
Parthenia Street at the northern edge of Canoga Park. The 43-foot-wide dirt 
strip extends from Lurline Avenue almost to De Soto Avenue. It pinches 
Parthenia's busy four lanes into two, causing jam-ups in the morning and 
evening when heavy traffic from nearby industrial areas squeezes through. 
</P>
<P>
The city's proposal to eliminate the bottleneck has been delayed by nearby 
homeowners' unhappiness at losing what have become the extended front yards of 
a row of one-acre mini-estates on the north side of Parthenia. Some residents 
believe that the strip contributes to what they regard as the rural look of 
their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
When 34 Parthenia Avenue property owners were advised five years ago that they 
would be assessed an average of $9,000 each to pay for the widening, the 
resulting outcry forced the City Council to waive requirements that the 
widening project include street lights, sidewalks and sewer hookups. 
</P>
<P>
The protests have triggered eight redesigns to the Parthenia project over the 
years. The most recent revision was finished a month ago, clearing the way for 
city officials to begin discussing sharing the cost of the $1.8-million project 
with property owners. 
</P>
<P>
"The city will pick up a portion of the costs because Parthenia is a secondary 
highway," Glasgow said. "We're just now beginning negotiations with the 
owners." 
</P>
<P>
Officials hope to iron out the details in time for the Parthenia widening 
project to get under way in March, 1991, he said. Residents say they are 
equally eager to resolve the long-running dispute. 
</P>
<P>
"I have mixed feelings about the widening," said Vicki Johnson, whose family 
has owned one of the Parthenia mini-estates for nearly 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"The new street will be closer to our house. But there will be fewer accidents. 
There have been a lot of them -- people don't see the barricades. I've taken 
blankets out to people who have been hurt in accidents out there." 
</P>
<P>
But a more frequent problem involves motorists in four-wheel-drive vehicles who 
race over the dirt strip and stir up billowing clouds of dust, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Others who live behind Valley jutouts say traffic problems are few, however. 
</P>
<P>
"There's never even the screeching of brakes, not even in the morning rush 
hour," said Steve Fletcher, who rents a small clapboard one-time farmhouse on a 
jutout lot next to Wilbur Avenue in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Franzalia, whose Studio City front yard forms a jutout on busy Coldwater 
Canyon Avenue, said only one motorist has driven onto his property. "Ten years 
ago some woman landed on my front porch. I think she got a little confused 
trying to make a turn there at the corner," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Won't Sell 
</P>
<P>
Franzalia, who has lived in his home for 30 years, said his jutout was formed 
when apartment houses were built on either side of him. He said apartment 
developers, who would have to pave over the jutout, frequently ask him if he is 
interested in selling his house to them. "I tell them I'm not selling to 
anybody," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Down the street, operators of the landmark Little Brown Church -- which also 
sits on a Coldwater Canyon Avenue jutout -- say the same thing. They aren't 
interested in selling. And they have not been troubled by cars crashing into 
their jutout. 
</P>
<P>
"God really watches over our chapel," said Catherine Martin, a church 
secretary. "Someone hit our picket fence six or eight years ago. But that's 
all." 
</P>
<P>
Martin said the jutout is one of the reasons the tiny 48-year-old chapel, which 
was the scene of the Feb. 29, 1952, marriage of Ronald Reagan and Nancy Davis, 
has never been changed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Frequent Offers 
</P>
<P>
"The street would be right up to the front door if we got a building permit. 
That's one of the reasons we've never remodeled," Martin said. She said the 
church is approached frequently by developers, "but we have no intention of 
selling it or tearing it down." 
</P>
<P>
Glasgow said the cost to property owners of widening streets varies, depending 
on the size of the jutout. Local residential streets are only 36 to 40 feet 
wide, while secondary streets are 66 feet wide and "major highways" are 
designated to be 80 feet in width. 
</P>
<P>
The city shares the cost of paving over large jutouts under the philosophy that 
people should not be penalized for living on a busy street. "If the widening is 
more than a local benefit, they shouldn't have to pay for more than their 
share," Glasgow said. 
</P>
<P>
Glasgow said the city is in no rush to force landowners to eliminate jutouts 
that do not cause traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
Those jutouts, motorists will have to wait out.

sheriff's deputies who had ordered about 100 wedding guests to leave, said Sgt. 
Mike De Los Santos. 
</P>
<P>
Enriquez Amezcua, 23, and Hugo Tamayo, 19, also were arrested on suspicion of 
refusing to disperse. 
</P>
<P>
De Los Santos said he did not know what originally provoked the fight. 
Twenty-five officers were called to help disperse the crowd, and several 
deputies suffered minor injuries.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: MEDIA / KEVIN BRASS: THREATS GO WITH TERRITORY FOR 
MEMBERS OF THE MEDIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN BRASS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A few years ago, Larry Himmel's home phone was tapped and he was under 
surveillance by the San Diego County Sheriff's Department. Himmel was a 
commentator and host of a nightly comedy show for KFMB-TV (Channel 8) at the 
time. Someone who apparently didn't appreciate his humor was sending 
threatening letters to his home, and the Sheriff's Department took the threats 
seriously enough to beef up security. 
</P>
<P>
"It just goes with the territory," Himmel said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the occasional in-depth conversation with a crackpot, and letters and 
calls from revenge-minded story subjects, secret admirers and genuinely sick 
people, are practically common for some members of the media, and not just for 
the big-name controversial commentators/television personalities like Michael 
Tuck, Ted Leitner and even Himmel. 
</P>
<P>
Usually the threats are easy to ignore. Sometimes they're not. 
</P>
<P>
Himmel's notes were arriving at his home and seemed to be coming from someone 
who knew him. 
</P>
<P>
Another member of the media kept finding little obscene statues on the kitchen 
porch. Another was being followed. Sometimes the letters are graphic and 
detailed, indicating a scary depth of knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
The number of threats against members of the media is increasing, said 
Sheriff's Detective Floyd Feese, who has handled "5 to 10" such cases in the 
last two years from the Encinitas substation. 
</P>
<P>
"We definitely have a group of people going after news media and public 
officials," said Feese, who handles the cases differently than "normal" cases. 
"They (reporters) have a job to do. My job is to be paranoid." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the media who report threats to the San Diego Police Department are 
"treated like any other citizen who wants to make a report of a threat," 
according to Police Department spokesman Bill Robinson. He recalls about five 
such cases in the last five years: "Mainly males calling female reporters or 
anchors." 
</P>
<P>
It is often hard for reporters to know if a threat or incident is serious 
enough to warrant reporting to the police. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, one local radio reporter is worried that the subject of a story is 
looking for revenge. The reporter's house was broken into on the same day the 
story aired, but nothing was stolen. However, there were clear signs that 
someone had been in the house. The incident is being investigated by the 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
"It scared me," the reporter said. "I took it as a message." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, a reporter for a local television station called 911 to report a 
group of four men trying to break into a neighbor's car. After the reporter's 
name appeared in news reports about the incident, a book critical of the media 
and a copy of the news reports appeared in the reporter's mailbox. 
</P>
<P>
The case, investigated by the Sheriff's Department, turned out to be false 
alarm. A neighbor left the book in the mailbox. But the reporter, who had 
received threatening phone calls in the past, has increased security around the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing I thought about was, what stories am I working on now?" the 
reporter said. 
</P>
<P>
Some stories make reporters a little more alert than usual, such as the Karen 
Wilkening prostitution story, currently making headlines. It contains unknown, 
titillating and potentially dangerous elements -- mysterious and powerful 
figures possibly working behind the scenes and a potential link to a series of 
murders, for example. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of reporters are scared" about the Wilkening case, the radio reporter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Most television, radio and newspaper offices have extensive security measures. 
Although some officials for the local television stations didn't want to 
discuss specifics, occasionally they intensify security because of threats. For 
example, an extra security guard was hired to patrol the KFMB-TV (Channel 8) 
studio at night a few years ago; later, a large fence was built around the 
whole station. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is that if someone wants to get you, they'll get you," Himmel said. 
"People who write and call won't touch you." 
</P>
<P>
Himmel taped audition segments for KGTV (Channel 10) last week. "Just taking a 
look," News Director Paul Sands said. . . . 
</P>
<P>
KNSD-TV's (Channel 39) "SportsTalk" show brings all the excitement of radio to 
television, which is to say it is as visually stimulating as a can of bean dip. 
It's a radio sports talk show on television (after Saturday afternoon baseball 
games), and it doesn't try to be anything else. XTRA-AM's (690) Lee (Hacksaw) 
Hamilton is the host, droning on and on about any sports topic. Sometimes he 
even seems to know something about the subjects. He sits in a darkened set made 
to look like a radio studio, fielding phone calls. Cameras provide different 
views of Hamilton's head. It's a show for sports addicts and insomniacs only. .

Locally based pretentious high-brow magazine Arete is starting a national 
marketing effort. A subscription mailer was recently sent to 350,000 homes. . .

</P>
<P>
Former North County Entertainer publisher Brian Cook has started a three-dot 
column for the Blade Tribune, er, uh . . . the Oceanside-based paper now called 
the Blade-Citizen. To promote the column, he got San Francisco Chronicle 
columnist Herb Caen to pose for a photo. Cook flew up to San Francisco and 
spent a grand total of maybe 30 seconds with the granddaddy of three-dot 
columnists. "I had to develop the film to see what he looks like," Cook said. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Constance Powers, a Chula Vista landlord featured in a Channel 10 "10 
on Your Side" segment, accused reporter Bill Griffith, now the co-host of 
Channel 10's homey morning talk fest "InSide San Diego," of hitting her in the 
face with a microphone and generally harassing her. She filed a lawsuit seeking 
at least $25,000 in damages. Videotape of the incident suggested that Griffith 
didn't even have the alleged microphone/weapon in his hand, and Powers' 
original attorney withdrew from the case, citing its lack of merit. Last year, 
a Superior Court judge made a summary judgment in Channel 10's favor. But 
Powers' new attorney has filed an appeal. . . . 
</P>
<P>
New News Director Donald Shafer has started work at Channel 39. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In the last two weeks, Channel 39 reporter Bill Ritter lost two producers. Both 
Candace Armstrong, the producer for his investigative segments, and Barry 
Martin, producer of "San Diego Chronicles," the new show hosted by Ritter, 
resigned to pursue other interests. Martin was originally hired to produce 
Himmel's show. With a contract that ran through June, he was assigned to 
"Chronicles," which premiered last month with a show on entrepreneurs. Although 
no decision has been made, station personnel expect "Chronicles" to become a 
regular feature, although some at the station would like to see it tackle more 
hard-news topics. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Channel 10 reporter and weekend anchor Adrienne Alpert, on jury duty, was 
called up for the case of an Oregon man charged with trying to kill a 
prostitute in San Diego. But she was excused when it was learned she had 
covered the case.

SHE DESIGNED MOVIE OUTFITS THAT THE KILLER CALLS 'JUST LIKE MINE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Goodness gracious: leopard lapels and shiny suits! Stepping out as Jerry Lee 
Lewis in "Great Balls of Fire," Dennis Quaid's clothes are the perfect fit for 
the role of The Killer, thanks to Los Angeles designer Mary Kay Stolz. 
</P>
<P>
After looking at hours of videos, Stolz re-created Lewis' 1950s wardrobe, shiny 
suits and all. "It was a fine line to get the clothes recognizable without 
overdoing it," she said in her Hollywood Hills studio. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest help, Stolz said, was a video of Elvis Presley footage. "That's 
what Jerry Lee was aspiring to." 
</P>
<P>
Stolz's job in "Great Balls of Fire" was similar to what she did for Quaid in 
"The Big Easy," designing the clothes of one character. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Big Easy," Quaid played a New Orleans cop on the take with a wardrobe 
that a police officer would be hard-pressed to afford. "He had all his clothes 
made," Stolz said. "We were giving a character a look." 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, the look of Quaid's clothes in "Great Balls of Fire" is similar 
to "The Big Easy," said Tracy Tynan, "Great Balls" costume designer. "They were 
the same '40s and '50s style," she said. "They weren't that radically 
different." 
</P>
<P>
Stolz, who had also done concert clothes for Eddie Murphy, Prince, Sheila E. 
and Kim Carnes, views movie costumes as part of the nonverbal narrative. "They 
must tell something about the character and make the story proceed the way it 
should." 
</P>
<P>
After watching the '50s footage, Stolz said she noticed that the clothes 
entertainers like Lewis and Elvis wore made them stand out from the band. The 
styles were not that much different, she said, "but they hung differently, they 
were drapier." In addition, the singers pushed the norm a little further. "They 
were a little more theatrical." 
</P>
<P>
Tynan said Lewis and Elvis used to buy clothes at a Memphis store called 
Lansky's. "Black entertainers got their clothes there," Tynan said. "They had a 
much more interesting sense of style." The bands dressed more conservatively, 
with plaid coats and string ties, she said. Lansky's, still owned by Bernard 
Lansky, is now a big and tall men's shop -- with nine locations in Greater 
Memphis -- and an Elvis Presley gift shop. "We had real sharp, way-out clothes. 
People thought we were crazy, but we had the sharpest clothes," Lansky said. 
"We were the outfitters to the King. Jerry Lee started coming in right after 
Elvis." 
</P>
<P>
For "Great Balls of Fire," Stolz and Tynan had to take some liberties because 
much of the '50s footage was in black-and-white and some fabrics weren't 
available. "We didn't know what the colors or the fabrics were," Tynan said. 
</P>
<P>
Stolz did find some '50s fabrics, though, from stores in Beverly Hills and in 
St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
"There's still lots of stuff left over from the '50s in St. Louis," she said. 
</P>
<P>
While Stolz, who is also a senior design instructor at Otis/Parsons, is 
building a reputation for performance clothes and flashy movie costumes, she 
doesn't like to see out-of-character clothes in films. "I don't like it when 
terrorists look like GQ models," she says. 
</P>
<P>
She did the opposite of fancy dress while working as costume designer for 
"Weeds," which starred Nick Nolte as a convict who goes straight by writing a 
play. 
</P>
<P>
"People told me: 'You can't do real clothes,' " Stolz said. "I finally got to 
prove that I could in 'Weeds.' " 
</P>
<P>
She wanted unstylish clothes that looked as though they belonged to ex-cons. To 
get that effect, she did such things as having clothes run over with a car and 
pants pockets abused to the point where they looked as if a guy had been 
"sticking his hands in them every day for five years." 
</P>
<P>
Stolz started out in manufacturing but doesn't plan to head back into street 
wear any time soon. "I'm trying to do mostly movies," she said. "I'd much 
rather do that than try to think of what women in the Midwest want to wear to 
work next year." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, she said, in the movies, "when you make people look good, they like 
you and everyone's happy." 
</P>
<P>
And how about The Killer himself, who had an active role in the production of 
the film and has been promoting the movie in everything from Esquire and 
Rolling Stone spreads with Quaid to the unveiling of a Jerry Lee Lewis star on 
Hollywood Boulevard? 
</P>
<P>
Well, he ended up wearing one of Stolz's suits for a promotional photo, Tynan 
said. And, Stolz said, the best compliment for her was when Lewis said, "These 
clothes look just like mine."

VIOLENCE MARS SUPERFEST AT COLISEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONNIE JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The crowd loved his cool strut, his funk-powered dancers, his dark sunglasses 
and new jack-swingin' persona. But the most fervent response Kool Moe Dee 
received during his performance at the 10th Annual Budweiser Superfest on 
Saturday at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum was to the brief snippet he 
performed from "Self-Destruction," the rap plea for an end to the 
black-on-black crime and violence that has been escalating in the inner city in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
But neither Dee's appeal nor the heavy police presence on foot, on horseback 
and in helicopters stopped fights from breaking out during the course of the 
six-hour concert -- fights that would send hundreds of skittish people running 
for the nearest exits. Police reported three stabbing incidents at the event, 
which was attended by a crowd of 41,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, I'm just here to see Kool Moe Dee and Karyn White," said 19-year-old Tina 
Jefferson from Carson as she watched one fracas down on the field. "Otherwise, 
I wouldn't even be putting myself through this kind of a scene." 
</P>
<P>
The bill included rappers (Dee, Rob Base &amp; DJ Easy Rock, M. C. Hammer), 
young soul stars (Tony! Toni! Tone!, New Edition, Guy) and one soul matriarch 
(Patti LaBelle). White didn't make her scheduled appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Dee's set had its moments, hampered though they were by what may have been the 
world's muddiest sound system. And if you didn't have great seats or a pair of 
binoculars, you may have missed some of his flashier dance steps, since the 
Budweiser folks didn't spring for giant video screens. But none of that stopped 
the kids in the bleachers from chanting along to the lyrics of Dee's "Go See 
the Doctor," a rap about the perils of condom-less sex. 
</P>
<P>
While he's an authoritative performer on record, Dee suffered from the same 
problem that plagued many of the young performers on the bill Saturday: How to 
pace a show, build momentum and keep an audience fully engrossed are pesky 
little conceptual wrinkles that haven't been totally ironed out by Dee -- or, 
for that matter, by the act that followed him, New Edition. 
</P>
<P>
Back when Bobby Brown was a member of this group, it was Ralph Tresvant -- with 
his teen-dream good looks and teasingly sweet falsetto -- who garnered most of 
the spotlight. Now it's Brown's replacement in the group, Johnny Gill, who gets 
the screams that used to go to Tresvant. 
</P>
<P>
With his from-the-old-school soulfulness, Gill tends to overpower his fellow 
group members. But his bravado didn't disguise the fact that their act also 
contained a lot of annoying stop-and-start moves that kept New Edition from 
chugging along like the well-oiled entertainment machine it should be. 
</P>
<P>
Pacing was a problem in Guy's set also, though lead singer Aaron Hall 
compensated with his church-derived vocal delivery. Muddy sound system aside, 
Guy performed a string of tunes ("Teddy's Jam," "Piece of My Love," "I Like") 
that succeeded despite the feedback and distortion. 
</P>
<P>
M. C. Hammer and his Posse also came across strongly -- even though there were 
a few lulls when it looked as if they had no clear idea of what was supposed to 
happen next. Short of Michael Jackson, Prince and Bobby Brown (when the spirit 
moves him), nobody delivers more exciting choreography than the Bay Area-based 
rapper and crew. 
</P>
<P>
Like Dee, Hammer got his most fevered response to a "stop-the-violence" 
message. On Saturday, that message was more well-meaning than effective.

STRIKE THEATRE OFFERS '3 FOR 1!' AT CALLBOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, Times Theater Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A couple of weeks ago the Strike Theatre launched its summer repertory season 
at the Callboard with Cyril Tourneur's grim "The Revenger's Tragedy." Last 
weekend, the company followed that up with three contemporary one-acts -- 
simply called "3 for 1!" -- that should have been, comparatively speaking, a 
piece of cake. 
</P>
<P>
Should have been. Weren't. This energetic young company, new to Los Angeles, is 
more at home, it seems, with Jacobean melodrama than 20th-Century comedy. 
Granted, "3 for 1!" offers off-the-wall pieces whose satirical intent (in two 
out of three cases, anyway) Tourneur himself might have admired. It's the edge 
that's missing here, the sense of absurdist style. 
</P>
<P>
The first short play, Nancy Beverly's "Attack of the Moral Fuzzies," is an 
attempt to see modern life as a game show: Make those difficult moral choices, 
win a prize. What'll it be? Heart transplants for adults, liver transplants for 
kids or better Medicare for the poor? 
</P>
<P>
A clever idea, but the actors have a hard time of it, huffing and puffing with 
the bursts of enthusiasm television game shows require. And neither director 
Steve Josephson nor lighting designer Ken Scarborough help matters, the former 
by keeping things too hyper and the latter by keeping them too dark. (This is 
television, remember? A paradigm for lights.) 
</P>
<P>
No matter. Once we get the hang of what is aimed for (which is soon), the idea 
is spent. Only Alice Haberman as the beleaguered contestant-with-a-conscience 
escapes artistically (if not morally) unscathed. Everyone else is simply 
working too hard at being phony or vapid -- attributes that shock only when 
they come naturally. 
</P>
<P>
One might conclude that this company is perhaps too bright to play stupid 
convincingly. But "To Live and Die Like a Cactus," Marguerite MacIntyre's 
portrait of a bizarre love affair between a young woman named Daisy (Nell 
Balaban) and a young man named Gibbs (Bill Kohne) takes us through similar 
excesses in its determination to make wondrous her fascination with the offbeat 
(a strange attachment to maps) and his efforts at neutralizing it. 
</P>
<P>
Again, Balaban and Kohne work overtime at delivering these curious people. The 
piece rambles and director Joshua D. Rosenzweig (who staged "Revenger's 
Tragedy") seems powerless to shape it, while Scarborough pursues his obsession 
with murkiness. There is no climactic conclusion to this commentary on modern 
relationships and its only obvious connection to the cactus of the title is 
Daisy's prickly and immovable disposition. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Kondoleon's "The Fairy Garden," on the other hand, does have a perfectly 
splendid climax -- and displays no shortage of imagination getting to it. Again 
directed by Rosenzweig, it has brittle, Noel Cowardish repartee, dispensed by 
the bored denizens of affluent (if not high) society. It is festooned with 
flippant comedic violence descended of Joe Orton. And its crowning achievement 
might have been borrowed from Jean Giraudoux: a take-charge fairy (of the 
Tinker Bell kind) with a good head for business, a proper heart and, as we 
discover, a sense of elfin solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
This final piece, which takes up the evening's second half, should be its 
highlight. Kondoleon's play is an original -- an unfettered fantasy with a 
clear sense of style. If only the Strike actors possessed an equally clear 
sense of how to embrace it. "The Fairy Garden" may be set in a patio (Kevin 
Adams provided the pretty, trellised set, brightly lit -- at last -- by 
Scarborough), but its style is drawing-room comedy. They might as well be 
playing Oscar Wilde. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, only Paola de Florio, as the green-garbed garden fairy, delivers an 
enchanted performance. Balaban (a rich, bored wife), Kohne (a "mechanic" with a 
few surprises up his kazoo) and Christian J. LeBlanc (a bisexual hunk with the 
timid name of Mimi) manage some semi-enchantment. Unfortunately, Grant Heslov, 
who carries most of the piece as a spurned gay lover in despair, is too 
mannered and too whiny. Instead of being clever, urbane and acidly funny, he 
becomes merely grating. 
</P>
<P>
This time the Strike Theatre's grasp exceeds its reach. Who would have thought 
one might long for a second round of "The Revenger's Tragedy"? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
At 8451 Melrose Place in West Hollywood, Thursdays and Saturdays at 8 p.m. (in 
repertory with "The Revenger's Tragedy," playing Fridays, 8 p.m. and Sundays, 7

AUDIENCES THINK SPIKE LEE DID THE 'RIGHT THING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARREL DAWSEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Virginia Harris waited her turn Saturday in the tortuous ticket line that 
stretched from the box office of the Baldwin Hills Entertainment Complex to 
outlying La Brea Avenue, she marveled at what she believed was a queue for 
Spike Lee's controversial new film, "Do the Right Thing." 
</P>
<P>
When she entered the theater showing the film, however, Harris noticed that the 
crowd had dwindled considerably. Most had gone next door for "Batman." 
</P>
<P>
In her eyes, they'd done the wrong thing. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe it," chuckled Harris, a Los Angeles resident. "When we got 
inside, the crowd wasn't bad, but I thought almost everybody was coming to see 
(Lee's film). . . . People need to. This is a definitely a film for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Her sentiments were echoed by many of those among the crowd that did opt for 
"Do the Right Thing." Despite warnings from critics that the film -- which 
explores the racial tensions and ultimately violent events of one summer day in 
a largely black Brooklyn, N.Y., neighborhood -- could prove incendiary in 
multi-ethnic venues, Angelenos of widely ranging ethnic and racial backgrounds 
praised it as "the best movie of the summer." 
</P>
<P>
"These days we talk about a person's right to be a racist," said Sylvia 
Castillo, standing alongside Harris in a cluster of five people who were 
discussing the film outside the theater. "It's as if there's nothing wrong with 
that, but a when movie like this comes around, it's viewed as threatening." 
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the movie critics who cautioned that "Right Thing" was 
inflammatory, Castillo defended the film by saying, "It just puts dialogue 
right on the table." 
</P>
<P>
Anne Davis, another Los Angeles resident, said many of the critics manufactured 
the film's supposed incendiary potential because Lee is black. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something that's emphasized because a black man wrote it, produced it 
and directed it," she said. "The media doesn't talk about the skinheads' 
violence or (police brutality) like that." 
</P>
<P>
Added Brian Hudson: "Movies like this can only do good. There is nothing 
negative about this movie, nothing at all. It's the best movie of the summer." 
</P>
<P>
Others commended the film for its accurate portrayal of life styles in black 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
"It showed life from the black community's perspective," said Karen Bass. "It 
wasn't like 'Mississippi Burning,' where black people were just nameless, 
helpless victims." 
</P>
<P>
Bass said that most people tend be "uncomfortable about talking about racism" 
but that "Right Thing" makes discussion of the issue nearly unavoidable. 
</P>
<P>
Bass and others said they were also impressed by how Lee subtly took stances on 
some of the recent, highly publicized incidents of alleged racism in New York. 
For instance, in a scene in which blacks and Hispanics loot and burn a pizzeria 
after police murder a black youth, the angry mob chants "Howard Beach! Howard 
Beach!" In another scene, Lee stands near a wall bearing the spray-painted 
proclamation "Tawana Told the Truth," a reference to the Tawana Brawley rape 
case. 
</P>
<P>
But, while many gave the film high marks, not everyone came away with the same 
message. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the message was that people think we can solve problems with violence, 
but we can't," said Vordie Friday of Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
"It was saying that (black people) really need to come together," said Rubbey 
Brown, a Baldwin Hills man. "It showed what's really going on in the minds of 
black people. But whites should come see it too." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Dorsey, a 45-year-old Los Angeles resident, said the film focused on 
racial differences just to point out human commonality. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the message was epitomized by the Korean man in the movie who said he 
was just like the black people," Dorsey said. "We are all one. We need to let 
down our walls, our prejudices." 
</P>
<P>
Harris said she believed that "Right Thing" would not only foster interracial 
harmony but encourage greater cohesion in the black community. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, movies like this can build a movement, especially in light of the 
recent Supreme Court decisions," she said, citing rulings by the high court 
that many perceive as rollbacks of civil rights gains. "Movies like this also 
help create solidarity among the races. It showed the unity between blacks and 
Hispanics, which was a nice touch." 
</P>
<P>
The emotions touched off by "Right Thing" were as varied as the messages it 
broadcasted. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel uplifted by it," said Bass. "It was very positive; it left me feeling 
like there was some hope." 
</P>
<P>
Said Harris: "I left angry. To think, that, in 1989, we still haven't solved 
the problems of racism. That's a shame."

British actress Julie Covington, whose recording of "Don't Cry for Me, 
Argentina" was a worldwide hit, has pulled out of an Australian production of 
"Evita" where she was to play Eva Peron for the first time. Covington, 42, 
suffered a stress fracture, the show's producers said Sunday without being more 
specific. Covington, who recorded the original "Evita" album 13 years ago, 
arrived in Sydney, Australia, in a blaze of publicity. However, the Australian 
media of late has been carrying reports of friction with producer Thomas 
Guerra. Stephanie Lawrence, who played Eva Peron for three years on the London 
stage, will take Covington's place in the show, which is scheduled to open July 
18. ALEENE MacMINN

WHITTIER PARK COUNTRY FEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By wSTEVE HOCHMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
Someone at the weekend "Birthday Bash" country music festival at the hot and 
dusty Whittier Narrows Park had a good sense of irony: On a Saturday that 
culminated with Merle Haggard performing a new anti-flag-burning song, someone 
used a tape of Jackson Browne's "For America" -- which promotes a decidedly 
conflicting view of patriotism -- to fill time between acts at one of four 
music stages. 
</P>
<P>
But then, this whole event celebrated the incongruities of American culture. 
Next to a stand dealing rub-on "tattoos" was one trading in peace-sign 
T-shirts. Over by the outlying stage reserved for Cajun music, sounds of 
Louisiana blended with the post call from the nearby pig races, while smells of 
Cajun cuisine mingled with those from the too-nearby pony rides. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to those juxtapositions, the range of music was relatively 
predictable, though still fairly notable within the context of contemporary 
country music. From the down-home traditions of the Whites to the occasionally 
experimental bluegrass and Everly Brothers-influenced style of the O'Kanes to 
the sentimentality of Gary Morris, the lineup pretty much defined today's 
mainstream country spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
Haggard provided an appropriate conclusion to the day. A bit hoarse but 
otherwise in fine form, he led his band the Strangers through his usual 
sparkling mix of honky-tonk and swing, finishing with his new patriotic anthem 
before leaving the stage beneath the rockets' red glare of pre-Independence Day 
fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
The "Birthday Bash" -- which drew perhaps 15,000, short of the promoters' 
prediction of 22,000 -- ran smoothly, with the music on the two main stages 
alternating nearly seamlessly. The event was scheduled to continue Sunday with 
Jerry Lee Lewis topping the bill, followed by "Honky Tonk Monday" today and a 
Latino-oriented celebration of the Fourth of July on Tuesday. wSTEVE HOCHMAN

Public radio station KLON-FM (88.1) raised $80,000 during a five-day emergency 
fund-raising drive, exceeding the station's projected goal of $75,000. The June 
21-25 drive, the first in KLON's history, coincided with the end of the fiscal 
year and was necessary because of a revenue shortfall. General manager Rick 
Lewis said the drive was the "first of several initiatives to produce revenue, 
including corporate and foundation support and earned income from concert 
productions." More than 1,000 listeners called in with pledges. ALEENE MacMINN

"Batman" continued its torrid record-breaking box office pace during its second 
weekend in release, and the second sequel to "The Karate Kid" got off to a much 
stronger start than expected, according to weekend projections made Sunday by 
industry sources. Those sources said "Batman's" grosses would total about $30 
million over the weekend, and that the Warner Bros. film would break the 
$100-million mark by the end of the Fourth of July holiday. Disney's surprise 
hit, "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids," held onto second place, with a projected $13 
million for its second weekend. Columbia had the third- and fourth-best 
performing films in theaters with "The Karate Kid Part III" (more than $10 
million in grosses expected) and "Ghostbusters II" (between $9 million and $10 
million). "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" (about $7 million) and "Dead 
Poets Society" (about $6.5 million) were next, followed by Orion's 
just-released "Great Balls of Fire" (less than $4 million, according to 
projections). No figures were available on Universal's "Do the Right Thing," 
which opened on a limited basis around the country, but exhibitors showing the 
film said it opened very strong. ALEENE MacMINN

COMPOSERS ORCHESTRA REVIVES CHARTS -- ON ONE LEVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Masters has a good idea with his Jazz Composers Orchestra: Revive and 
rejuvenate the arrangements of some of jazz's finest orchestrators. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the ensemble's vigorous Big Band program at Long Beach's El Dorado 
Regional Park on Saturday evening, the idea worked just fine -- on one level. 
The 16-piece assemblage of young professionals performed the charts (written by 
such sterling arrangers as Gil Evans, Bill Holman, Hank Levy, Willie Maiden and 
Don Piestrup) with crisp precision. 
</P>
<P>
But a significant element was missing. As important and fascinating as good 
jazz charts may be, if they're not performed with vitality and spunk by 
performers who can solo as well as swing collectively, they become little more 
than exercises in technical expertise. 
</P>
<P>
Only occasionally -- in the work of alto saxophonist Danny House, flugelhornist 
Paul Mazio and trombonist Dave Woodley -- did the improvisation match the high 
achievement level of the written charts. Equally bothersome, the ensemble, for 
all its mechanical accuracy, never really got down to the basic swinging that 
might have brought their archive repertory back to vivid and pulsating life. 
</P>
<P>
Alto saxophonist Lee Konitz, who appeared with the Orchestra as a guest artist, 
limited himself to brief excursions through the Big Band charts associated with 
his playing in the '50s: "Stella by Starlight," "Out of Nowhere," "What's New" 
and "Stairway to the Stars." 
</P>
<P>
Listening to his playing, it seemed remarkable that Konitz had been described, 
in the '50s and '60s, as having a thin and passionless sound. His playing on 
this program clearly indicated what was not always apparent in his earlier work 
-- that he is a lineal descendant of Lester Young, both in the warmness of his 
tone and in the lyricism of his melodies. 
</P>
<P>
This was not, however, one of his better recent outings in the Southland. 
Although he occasionally came up with strikingly lovely phrases, his playing -- 
which never quite got in sync with the orchestra -- had the offhand, detached 
quality of another day at the musical office. DON HECKMAN

MOVIE HISTORY TAKES CENTER STAGE AT LONDON MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

LONDON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Designer Neal Potter spent more than a year translating other men's dreams and 
documents into this city's new Museum of the Moving Image. His working credo, 
written in block letters on a piece of tape across his drafting table, was a 
simple one: "Don't forget the magic!" 
</P>
<P>
They didn't. Uniformed guards have been replaced by costumed actors who oversee 
everything from Hollywood sound stages to Russian railroad cars stocked with 
propaganda films. Six huge statues of silent-film stars support a ceiling 
papered with mug shots. Even the museum's high-tech control center has been 
turned into an exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
Run by the British Film Institute, the museum opened last September and had 
more than 165,000 visitors its first four months. Potter and museum co-founder 
Leslie Hardcastle believed they had "a magical story to tell and we shouldn't 
become too academic or downbeat," Potter says. "This was entertainment, fantasy 
and art." 
</P>
<P>
More than 90 TV and film screens broadcast images drawn from, among others, 
"The Birth of a Nation," British newsreels and films by French directors Renoir 
and Clair. Potter estimates about 50 miles of cables and laser discs eliminate 
rewind time. Visitors can star in TV and films, then play back their own work 
instantly. 
</P>
<P>
The museum capitalizes on an apparently insatiable fascination with movie 
history and memorabilia. It opened about the same time as New York's American 
Museum of the Moving Image, run out of a former movie studio in Astoria, 
Queens, and in Los Angeles, the Hollywood Exposition broke ground in March on a 
Hollywood Boulevard site near Mann's Chinese Theater. The Exposition, focusing 
on film, TV, radio and recording arts, is operating out of donated office space 
at Paramount, but president Phyllis Caskey says the $22-million, 
31,000-square-foot first phase could open in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, the London museum's mission is more global than that of its American 
counterparts. A large display on the making of a TV serial may center on 
"Coronation Street," Granada TV's long-running drama, but there are still many 
U.S. references, including information on the 1959 TV quiz-show scandals. 
French films go as far back as the turn of the century, and films of the '30s 
are shown above a miniature model of Parisian rooftops. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing I respect most about MOMI is that in spite of the considerable 
wealth of material they covered, there's a coherence about the experience," 
says Malibu-based Barry Howard, who will design the proposed Hollywood museum. 
"You can trace what's happening in an easy way." 
</P>
<P>
Getting there wasn't so easy, however. Museum founders Hardcastle, controller 
of the British Film Institute South Bank, and David Francis, curator of the 
National Film Archive, started planning the museum more than 10 years ago, but 
it took all that time to raise the money. The museum's start-up costs of 12 
million ($18 million) came entirely from the private sector, including such 
donors as J. Paul Getty Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The 30,000-square-foot museum is tucked under Waterloo Bridge in the massive 
South Bank Arts Centre that also houses the National Theatre and Hayward 
Gallery. Mostly chronological, the museum's displays start with an image of the 
human eye, then move on to Asian shadow plays. Besides tracing how the shadow 
plays moved on to Europe, the museum documents such things as magic lanterns, 
the French Phantasmagoria and the zoopraxiscope of British photographer 
Eadweard Muybridge. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't forget early films either. Photo stills from D.W. Griffith's 1915 
epic, "The Birth of a Nation," are accompanied by a page enumerating such 
statistics as the film's cost of $500,000. (The film employed 18,000 people and 
3,000 horses; it took 200 seamstresses two months to make the costumes.) 
</P>
<P>
The fare varies. In the avant-garde section, there's a reproduction of the 
robot from Fritz Lang's "Metropolis" looking down from a landing. Not too far 
away is a huge padded hand crawling with bugs; it sets the mood for the grisly 
film segment from Luis Bunuel's "Un Chien Andalou" playing on a near-by 
monitor. Pictures from Salvador Dali's surrealist dream sequence in Alfred 
Hitchcock's "Spellbound" are on a wall above a couch that Dali once designed to 
represent Mae West's lips. 
</P>
<P>
Inside a door marked "casting office" is a suitably red-carpeted room full of 
movie star lore such as the metamorphosis of Theodosia Goodman, daughter of a 
Cincinnati tailor, into Theda Bara. Among the photos: Harold Lloyd pool side in 
Benedict Canyon with "one of his 65 Great Danes." 
</P>
<P>
A barn-like room becomes a Hollywood sound stage with assorted film departments 
on all sides. There's a re-created story board from "The Wizard of Oz" showing 
a matte painting of Dorothy and friends in front of the Yellow Brick Road; it 
backs up to a floor plan of the interior of the breakfast room from "Citizen 
Kane." In the adjoining costume department, Fred Astaire's tail coat and 
trousers from a 1936 film are on display. A video in the makeup department 
starts when your body weight descends on the chair in front of the 
makeup-mirror-cum-video screen. 
</P>
<P>
From the sound stage, you exit through the glass doors just under a full-size 
marquee advertising Claire Trevor and John Wayne in Walter Wangers' 
"Stagecoach." But the '30s facade of the Odeon is deceptive. Inside you see no 
movies but instead an award-winning demonstration of the Baird TV system and 
other facts and artifacts about the early days of television. 
</P>
<P>
Ever wonder what people thought about TV at its start? Right next to a display 
of early TV sets of every size and style -- all of them tuned at that moment to 
Phil Silvers as Sgt. Ernie Bilko -- are some early comments. Frank Lloyd Wright 
called it "chewing gum for the eyes," and Bertrand Russell was even more 
damning: "Television will be of no importance in your lifetime or mine." 
</P>
<P>
Display panels also detail the televised coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 
June, 1953; an audience of 200 million people in Europe and the United States 
made the coronation the biggest event in broadcasting history at that time. 
Panels similarly recall that on Sept. 1, 1939, the BBC was ordered to cease 
transmission because its broadcasts would have provided easy targets for enemy 
aircraft. On June 7, 1946, the BBC came back on with the same Mickey Mouse 
cartoon it was showing when it went down in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
But the reading material is clearly secondary to the viewing material. Potter 
figures most people have short concentration spans "and become quite lazy in a 
museum setting," so exhibits are not only as visual as possible, but short and 
visual. Twenty-four hours of British TV is condensed to three minutes in one 
exhibit, for instance, while a film depicting the history of film sound rushes 
by in nine. 
</P>
<P>
There's plenty of time to linger in the gift shop, however, with its assorted 
items sporting Mickey Mouse and Roger Rabbit logos, not to mention its date 
book from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Or in the 3,000-square-foot 
temporary exhibition showing -- extended until at least Aug. 30 -- "The Nine 
Worlds of Charlie Chaplin," an exhibit on the actor's life and career, 
including photographs, film clips, and personal belongings. 
</P>
<P>
The museum's attendance is nearing the half-million mark, and Potter says many 
visits run as long as five hours apiece.

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: UCLA FESTIVAL SHOWS RESTORED FILM CLASSICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The UCLA Film and Television Archive's second annual Festival of Preservation 
at once calls attention to the archive's invaluable, ongoing contributions 
toward retrieving and protecting our endangered film heritage and provides 
delightful summer entertainment as well. 
</P>
<P>
The festival gets off to a roaring start at 8 p.m. Friday in Melnitz Theater 
with one of Hollywood's truly legendary movies, Howard Hughes' "Hell's Angels" 
(1930), which restores the film to its full running time of 127 minutes, 
re-creates its tinted portions and incorporates a long-missing, eight-minute, 
two-color Technicolor sequence that represents the only color footage of Jean 
Harlow. 
</P>
<P>
On the ground, "Hell's Angels" is pretty corny, following two brothers -- one 
weak and cynical (Ben Lyon), the other strong and virtuous (James Hall) -- as 
they are swept away by a shallow society girl (Harlow) and swept up by the 
outbreak of World War I, which prompts their enlistment in the Royal Flying 
Corps. (The film's three stars make no real stab at British accents, merely 
sprinkling their conversation with rathers and rightos.) 
</P>
<P>
In the sky, however, the film remains one of the most exciting examples of 
aerial warfare, thrilling and unnervingly personal. Almost as suspenseful is 
whether Harlow will fall out of her gown. (In the late '40s, as executive 
talent director for Fox, Lyon would be instrumental in launching the career of 
another dynamite blonde, Marilyn Monroe.) 
</P>
<P>
The archive's preservation expert, Robert Gitt, and his team had an easier job 
with John Ford's "The Quiet Man" (1952), which screens after "Hell's Angels." 
However, a fresh print reveals how subtle three-strip Technicolor could be in 
this glorious romantic comedy set in Ireland and starring John Wayne and 
Maureen O'Hara, whose red-haired beauty was perfect for color. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne plays a retired boxing champ who returns to the birthplace he left as a 
small child. He has his reasons for avoiding a donnybrook with O'Hara's 
comically stubborn brother (Victor McLaglen), who won't allow O'Hara to have 
her rightful dowry. Ford's pace is appropriately leisurely, matching the tempo 
of rural Irish life, and the film is resonant with the director's wise and 
compassionate humor. Wayne is splendid and understated, as he always was under 
Ford's direction, and it's gratifying to be reminded that O'Hara was not merely 
"fiery" but delightfully varied as she alternates between pride and dismay. 
This is an adult film in the best sense. 
</P>
<P>
Cecil B. DeMille's "The Sign of the Cross" (1932), which has had its suggestive 
(rather than explicit) pre-code sex and violence restored, isn't as much fun as 
you would expect. In this ponderous extravaganza of Christian martyrdom in 
Nero's Rome, there's something queasy in DeMille's patented prurience-and-piety 
formula: The Christians, led by a pallid and insufferably noble Elissa Landi, 
are hard to take and so are the Romans, an unappetizing, sadistic crew, led by 
Charles Laughton's campy Nero. Fredric March seems too cerebral for Marcus, 
prefect of Rome, who falls for Landi. The film's bright spot is Claudette 
Colbert, as Poppaea, who takes what was a highly publicized milk bath and who 
has the wit to make wickedness seem chic. Lots of Deco-influenced Mitchell 
Leisen costumes. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sign of the Cross" is screening Sunday at 8 p.m. Also screening Sunday at 
2 p.m.: "The Line-Up at Police Headquarters" (1914) and the long-lost Jackie 
Coogan picture, "Daddy" (1923). 
</P>
<P>
The preservation festival, which runs weekends through July and includes many 
rarities, continues July 13 at 8 p.m. with the recently rediscovered Roland 
West silent "The Bat" (1926), which West remade (in 65 millimeter) only four 
years later as a talkie, "The Bat Whispers." With William Cameron Menzies' 
stark, vast sets and cinematographer Arthur Edeson's dramatic play of light and 
shadow, "The Bat" is almost as striking a triumph of the visual as its remake. 
</P>
<P>
It is one of the pioneer "old dark house" mysteries and adapted from the Mary 
Roberts Rhinehart-Avery Hopwood play, based in turn on Rhinehart's novel. The 
big deal is to guess the identity of The Bat as he -- or she -- terrorizes a 
mansion in the country that has been rented for the summer by a formidable New 
York aristocrat. The film is of special current interest as a clear inspiration 
for "Batman" creator Bob Kane, even though the Bat was a villain. Information: 
(213) 206-FILM, 206-8013.

WAVE OF REGULATIONS SWEEPS COUNTY'S BEACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you yearn to sit on the sand sipping champagne from a crystal goblet while 
watching the sunset this summer, do it on the Silver Strand. It's illegal in La 
Jolla and Del Mar and almost everywhere else along the county coastline. 
</P>
<P>
It's not the alcoholic beverage that puts champagne sippers on the wrong side 
of the law, it's the glass. Most of the county's 42 miles of sandy ocean 
shoreline are off limits to glass containers, although many of the beach parks 
allow alcoholic beverages. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, that champagne-spiced sunset on Silver Strand will have to be cut 
short. The sun sets a few short moments before 8 p.m. these days, and the state 
beach parks along the strand close at 8. 
</P>
<P>
To the dismay of many laid-back San Diegans who seek the calming beauty of the 
ocean to wash away the tensions of the working world, regulations are mounting 
on public beaches, leading to more prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
Lifeguards, who have been pressed into double duty to enforce the beach 
restrictions, are not all that happy about their new duties. From bronzed hero 
to bad guy is a big comedown. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Lifeguard Grant Larson, after warning three youngsters that their dog was 
not allowed on the Del Mar city beach (except north of 29th Street and south of 
the main lifeguard tower, and then only on a leash), philosophized that "a few 
bad guys" have eroded the freedom of the beaches for the many. 
</P>
<P>
A case in point is the beach bonfire ban passed by the Del Mar City Council 
last fall. Because of a series of rowdy parties in the popular north beach 
area, where the San Dieguito River empties into the ocean, beach residents 
demanded a stop to the nighttime debauchery outside their bedroom windows. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council responded with a beachwide ban on bonfires and city crews 
removed the popular fire rings that had served for decades as beacons for 
grunion runs and graduation parties. 
</P>
<P>
The same phenomenon brought a no-dog ordinance in Carlsbad starting June 1. The 
city controls a half-mile stretch of sand and surf north of the Carlsbad State 
Beach area, and has revoked the rights of residents to walk their dogs along 
that section because, a city employee explained, "a few bad guys refused to use 
a pooper scooper." 
</P>
<P>
"Next they will be banning people from the beach, and then everybody will be 
happy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Each beach, from San Onofre to Border Field, has its own do's and don'ts. Most 
of the regulations are designed to prevent recurrences of past problems that, 
in some cases, are unlikely to occur ever again. 
</P>
<P>
The effect "is stress city," according to Andrew O'Leary, Solana Beach director 
of marine safety (the new city's glorified title for chief lifeguard). 
</P>
<P>
O'Leary, who has been lifeguarding since he was a pup, has watched the beach 
turn from a free zone to a stress zone over the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
"It is nothing but hassle for people nowadays," he said. "The traffic on the 
freeway, finding a place to park, finding a fire ring, then sunburn and sand 
and finally heading home and fighting the traffic." 
</P>
<P>
Solana Beach, with two small accessible parks at Fletcher Cove, at the foot of 
Lomas Santa Fe Drive, and Tide Park, at the north end of the city, has posted 
rules. No glass, no dogs, fires in fire rings only. No fire rings were visible 
over the Independence Day holiday, but picnickers improvised, bringing hibachis 
and outdoor cookers from home. 
</P>
<P>
Solana Beach allows alcohol consumption (beer and wine) on the beach, but not 
in nearby parking lots. Last call for booze will be 9 p.m. after a recently 
passed City Council ordinance goes into effect July 27. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Famous for Collapsing 
</P>
<P>
O'Leary also warned about the bluffs that flank most of the Solana Beach 
shoreline. They are famous for collapsing on sunbathers below. And, he warned, 
swiping sea life from the tide pools is a serious offense. 
</P>
<P>
Some questionable behavior has escaped the local ordinances. A gang of surfers 
at Fletcher Cove recently convened in a brief ceremony to the Great Kahuna 
(patron of big waves), then shed their swimsuits and, with shouts of 
"Cowabunga!" surfed in the buff. The scene brought laughter and applause from 
the less adventurous beach-goers who were there to watch the sunset. 
</P>
<P>
Up and down the coast, jet skiers are the peskiest problem. Most lifeguards 
evict the skiers who land their expensive craft in swimming areas, especially 
during crowded beach days. The speedy craft often ride the waves at the surf 
line, endangering swimmers and surfers alike, then skim away at 35 m.p.h., too 
fast for land-based pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
North Coast lifeguards recommend a launching ramp at Cardiff State Beach to the 
jet ski owners who inquire, but state park officials say there is a statewide 
ban on launching or landing motor-driven craft at state beaches between May 15 
and Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
State beaches make up much of the North County coast, and extend to the 
international border, spanning three state park jurisdictions. 
</P>
<P>
At Border Field State Park, there are no bans on glass or alcohol use. Fire 
rings are scarce but available, and the chief complaint is sewage contamination 
from the nearby Tijuana River and a sewage outfall to the south in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plenty of Minor Problems 
</P>
<P>
Park rangers are helped in enforcement by U. S. Border Patrol officers who are 
in the area routinely to nab illegal aliens and guard against drug smugglers. 
Despite relatively good surf and beaches, Border Field gets little use from 
locals. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial Beach, with 3-plus miles of beaches, reports few major problems on 
them, but plenty of minor ones that Lifeguard Capt. Harold Seuquay admits could 
be solved if the city were not in such dire financial straits. 
</P>
<P>
Dogs on leashes are permitted except in posted areas around the pier and on it. 
Glass containers are prohibited but alcohol is allowed. A launching ramp for 
jet skis and other craft is located north of the south jetty, but the City 
Council is working on a set of regulations to curb their use. 
</P>
<P>
Jet skiers, Seuquay said, "are basically jerks," but he doubts if city 
ordinances are going to reform them. Lifeguards have no power to enforce local 
laws and jet skiers are reportedly quick to leave when sheriff's deputies 
appear. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial Beach permits beach fires within fire rings, but someone stole the 
rings. Who? Why? No one knows. And the city has no funds to replace them. 
</P>
<P>
At Silver Strand State Beach, which park rangers and lifeguards say is almost 
exclusively a "family beach," there are few restrictions other than a ban on 
dogs and an early (8 p.m.) closing time. Fires are allowed in fire rings; jet 
skis are not a problem; alcoholic beverages and glass containers are allowed 
and will remain so unless a problem arises. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Used by Families 
</P>
<P>
The broad beach in the city of Coronado is another one used mainly by families. 
Unlike a growing number of beach towns, the north end of the beach, across from 
Sunset Park, has fire rings, and people use them late into the night. However, 
the city has a ban on alcohol and glass containers. 
</P>
<P>
The most northern part of the beach is known as Dog Beach, where unleashed dogs 
are allowed to romp freely, chasing Frisbees and tennis balls into the waves. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's city beaches, from Ocean Beach north to Torrey Pines, are generally 
open to dogs (on leashes) and to fires (in fire rings), according to San Diego 
Police Capt. Dave Crow, Northern Division commander. Glass containers are 
banned everywhere along the city sand, but alcohol is allowed. 
</P>
<P>
However, alcohol possession and consumption is prohibited in all beach area 
parking lots in the city, posing an interesting question as to how beach-goers 
can legally get their booze from car to sand. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego city beaches are generally off limits between midnight and 6 a.m., 
and police enforce earlier curfews on popular party spots such as Fiesta Island 
in Mission Bay (10 p.m.) and suspected drug-dealing areas such as the South 
Mission Beach parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
Lifeguards and law enforcement officers admit that they "look the other way" 
when grunion hunters, fishermen or beach walkers break the curfew rules meant 
to curb late-night partiers and all-night campers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Under State Control 
</P>
<P>
North at Del Mar, the fire rings have been stored and no fires are allowed, 
except for self-contained portable cookers. Glass is banned, but alcohol is 
allowed. Leashed dogs are allowed at the extreme north and south ends of the 2 
miles of sand. 
</P>
<P>
From Solana Beach north to Oceanside, much of the seashore is under the control 
of the state. Chief Ranger Jim Van Schmus said that glass containers are banned 
at most of the beaches and alcohol is allowed except at Moonlight Beach and 
state beaches within the city of Carlsbad. Fire rings are provided at Moonlight 
Beach (at the foot of Encinitas Boulevard) and South Carlsbad and Carlsbad 
state beaches, but have been removed along Cardiff's Restaurant Row. 
</P>
<P>
Leashed dogs are permitted at Cardiff and Leucadia state beaches but banned in 
other beach areas of heavy use. And all the state beaches close at 11 p.m., Van 
Schmus said, although fishermen and grunion hunters are not bothered. 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside bans alcoholic beverages on its beaches, a longstanding prohibition 
growing out of Marine-versus-townie gang fights and beer busts of a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
No dogs, no glass, no overnight camping and fires only in fire rings round out 
the restrictions along the Oceanside Strand, beach lifeguard Bill Richardson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
From the earlier turbulent days, the Oceanside beach has matured into a 
mellower mood where law enforcement officers are kept busier writing parking 
tickets than busting up brawls. 
</P>
<P>
North of Oceanside lies Camp Pendleton Marine Base, but its beaches are open to 
civilians only by invitation. At the extreme northwestern corner of the county, 
San Onofre State Beach carves out a tiny section of the sprawling military 
complex for a camping park and surfing-swimming area in the shadow of the 
nuclear power plant. 
</P>
<P>
There, alcohol is allowed, glass bottles are banned. Dogs are allowed on 
sections of the camping area but not on the surfing beach. Fire rings are 
located on the surfing beach, not at the camping beach. 
</P>
<P>
The day use area closes at 10 p.m. and, according to the locals, the waves are 
"gnarly."

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: SHOULD MASKED MARAUDER HAVE A LICENSE TO THRILL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the World Wrestling Federation rolls into the San Diego Sports Arena on 
Friday, fans will witness the body slams and atomic death grips of King Duggan, 
the Ultimate Warrior, Red Rooster, the Brooklyn Brawler, the Fabulous Rougeau 
Brothers and more. 
</P>
<P>
The arena will be packed, the heroes will be heroic, the villains villainous, 
and the fans will go home hoarse but happy. 
</P>
<P>
Three days later, serious-minded public servants will meet in Sacramento to 
debate whether what the San Diego fans saw was real. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is a bill by Assemblyman Dick Floyd (D-Carson), who says that pro 
wrestling is more show business than a sporting event. He wants the state to 
quit requiring wrestlers to have state licenses, as boxers do. 
</P>
<P>
After all, the state doesn't make actors, musicians or clowns have licenses. 
It's time to deregulate Hulk Hogan and Macho Man, argues Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
You might think the reality matter had been settled. State law already says 
that any event in which "the winner may have been selected before the 
performance commences" cannot be billed as a match or contest. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, WWF uses the term "exhibitions." And WWF likes Floyd's bill 
because licenses cost money. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-June, the bill passed the Assembly by a 50-2 vote and was set for a July 
10 meeting of the Senate Business and Professions Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, a similar bill was pinned to the mat by three formidable 
performers in the political ring: Gov. George Deukmejian, the State Athletic 
Commission and committee Chairman Sen. Daniel Montoya (D-La Puente). 
</P>
<P>
Deregulation will mean loss of revenue (about $200,000), according to the 
governor. Deregulation will leave the state without the power to punish rowdy 
wrestlers, said the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd promises some surprises this time. Maybe an appearance by a WWF star in 
costume. Maybe a philosophic approach: If the state licenses WWF wrestlers, why 
not mud wrestlers and roller derby participants? 
</P>
<P>
Floyd figures Montoya is unmovable. But he hopes that other committee members 
might be persuaded, especially conservatives who want government to butt out 
whenever possible. 
</P>
<P>
One of those seen as key is Sen. Bill Craven (R-Oceanside). He is neutral on 
AB1040, but he admits he was surprised to learn that pro wrestlers are licensed 
by the state. 
</P>
<P>
He promises to consider the bill strictly on its merits. He is not a wrestling 
fan. His athletic addiction is college basketball, particularly Villanova, his 
alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
No Sissies Allowed 
</P>
<P>
Move over, Over-the-Line. Make room for the first Downtown San Diego Stickball 
Tournament, Saturday, July 22, sponsored by the Central City Assn. 
</P>
<P>
It's an urban sport, lots of diving onto pavement to catch a ball, none of this 
sissy stuff of landing in soft sand. The rules are an amalgam of stickball's 
various East Coast and Midwest venues, including all-important Rule 9: 
</P>
<P>
"Once a player is substituted, that player is out of the game unless there is 
an injury. Umpire shall determine if a player is faking an injury!" 
</P>
<P>
No Hard Feelings 
</P>
<P>
Douglas K. Seymour, the former San Diego reserve cop who sued the Police 
Department for stress suffered while infiltrating the Ku Klux Klan, has 
resurfaced in La Crosse, Wis., working in the construction business and writing 
a book about his exploits. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before he accepted a $300,000 settlement last August, Seymour dropped 
from sight to escape what he said were death threats against him and his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
Now he has resumed giving interviews and appearing on the Phil Donahue and 
Oprah Winfrey shows and talking about his 2 1/2 years skulking in the KKK. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Ted Vollmer, a former Times reporter now working for the 
La Crosse Tribune, Seymour says he's no longer interested in going undercover 
but he's willing to give lectures for $2,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
He says he bears no ill will toward San Diego, despite a bruising trial. On his 
office wall is an SDPD cap and a commendation from the brass for a job well 
done.

2 ARRESTED AFTER SHOOTING SPREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego man and a Los Angeles woman were arrested Saturday night after 
allegedly spraying gunfire around a Poway neighborhood, authorities said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies responded about 7:40 p.m. to reports of shots being fired in 
the 12000 block of Cobblestone Creek Road, and sealed off the area as the shots 
continued, said Sgt. Chris Von Olnhausn. 
</P>
<P>
After pinpointing the house from which the shots were emerging, deputies 
flushed out and arrested Zachary Cowan, 35, the owner of the house, and Linda 
Young, 38, of Woodland Hills, on suspicion of shooting at inhabited dwellings 
and negligent discharge of firearms, Von Olnhausn said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities seized six rifles and shotguns, three handguns and an assault 
weapon from Cowan's home, he said. 
</P>
<P>
About 32 rounds had been fired, and some were recovered from the walls and 
roofs of nearby homes, Von Olnhausn said. 
</P>
<P>
Cowan also was under suspicion of unlawful possession of slot machines, after 
deputies found and seized nine machines in his home, the spokesman said.

FIREWORKS NOT A DOG'S BEST FRIEND, AUTHORITIES WARN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dog owners should be prepared on the Fourth of July for strange or wild 
behavior in their canines, which may panic and try to flee the sounds of 
fireworks, animal control authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
Dogs have acute hearing and may respond to the sounds in unusual ways, said 
animal control officers, who have reported incidents of spooked dogs jumping 
through screened doors and windows and over walls, or running away and becoming 
lost, according to Sally Hazzard, director of the county's animal control 
department. 
</P>
<P>
To minimize such responses, pet owners should give their dogs food, water and 
extra attention and confine them to a safe place, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
They should also make sure their pets are wearing identification tags, 
including a license. If a dog runs away, its owner should contact the animal 
control department, which can use a computer to track the animals, Hazzard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The computerized system will be especially valuable to people who find animals 
and report them, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to be so busy on Tuesday that we won't be able to pick up all the 
dogs that are found and called in," Hazzard said. "What we hope to do is do the 
reuniting over the phone, by giving the finder the owner's address and phone 
number. That's why a license is your dog's call home." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say they expect an additional 100 dogs a day to be brought to the 
county's three shelters Tuesday through Thursday. Some 525 dogs a day normally 
stay at the shelters, Hazzard said. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, pet owners can call the county's emergency line at 278-9760. After 
that they can call the South Bay shelter at 263-7741, the central shelter in 
San Diego at 236-4250 or the Carlsbad shelter at 438-2312.

SOUTH KOREAN STEEL FIRM SET TO BUY U.S., CANADA MILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM JAMESON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SEOUL, South Korea 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move heralding an emerging South Korean role in overseas investment, Sammi 
Special Steel Corp. is about to become the first Korean firm to buy American 
factories. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, $180 million of the $220-million deal will be financed by an 
international syndicate of banks led by a South Korean bank, a sign of South 
Korea's growing financial strength. South Korea, once deeply in debt, will 
enter the ranks of net creditors this year, Kim Kun, a Bank of Korea governor, 
said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
The governments of Canada, the United States and South Korea must authorize 
Sammi's purchase, but approval is expected "in the very near future," according 
to Jin Byung Hwa, overseas investment director at the Ministry of Finance. 
</P>
<P>
Sammi, South Korea's largest specialty steel firm, will purchase three 
specialty steel-producing divisions of Rio Algom of Toronto, a mining and 
resource exploration firm that is a subsidiary of the London-based RTZ Corp. 
The divisions are Atlas Stainless Steel, situated in Tracy, Quebec; Atlas 
Speciality Steel, in Welland, Ontario, and AL Tech Specialty Steel Corp. of 
Dunkirk, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
The Dunkirk division operates specialty steel mills in both Dunkirk and 
Watervliet, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Together the four plants produce about 500,000 tons of specialty steel a year. 
Last year, they registered an operating profit of $63.8 million on sales of 
$582.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
South Korea's largest integrated steelmaker, Pohang Steel Corp., has invested 
in a joint-venture steel mill with USX, and such electronics giants as Samsung 
and Gold Star have built manufacturing plants in the United States. But Sammi's 
purchase represents the first takeover by a Korean firm of existing American 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago South Korea's foreign debt peaked at $47 billion. But with the 
emergence of trade surpluses, rising wages and the appreciation of South Korean 
currency, South Korean manufacturers have begun investing overseas. Net 
overseas assets are expected to surpass claims against the country by the end 
of this year, making South Korea a net creditor, and the government has been 
loosening controls on foreign investment and Korean banks' overseas activities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Rare' Korean-Led Loan 
</P>
<P>
Jin, the Finance Ministry official, said a Korean-led loan for an overseas 
manufacturing purchase "is rare." Korea First Bank has arranged the loan, in 
which two Korean state-run banks and eight foreign banks will participate. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of April, total Korean overseas investment amounted to $1.1 billion, 
with $362 million of it in manufacturing projects, Jin said. In the United 
States, investment had reached $358 million, with $179 million of it in 
manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, cumulative foreign investment in South Korea amounted to about $4 
billion at the end of last year. 
</P>
<P>
Delegations from Europe, Southeast Asia and the United States are making 
increasingly frequent visits to Seoul seeking private Korean investment. 
</P>
<P>
To date, overseas investment has been led by three of South Korea's largest 
electronics firms, Gold Star, Samsung and Daewoo. By the end of this year, the 
three firms will be operating 21 plants overseas. Footwear and textile firms 
are also getting into operations abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Hwang Cheol Kyu, a Sammi spokesman, said the company will retain all the 
employees at all three of the Rio Algom divisions it is buying. It will send 
Korean representatives to each, but has not yet decided how many. 
</P>
<P>
Although Sammi plans to complete a new plant, expanding its annual capacity to 
1 million tons from 385,000 tons, the company will still lack the ability to 
produce hot coil specialty steel and plans to import that product from its new 
North American plants, Hwang said. Currently, 70% of its imports of 180,000 
tons a year comes from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition will give South Korea a new assured source of supply of hot 
coil steel, Jin said. Hot coil is processed into stainless sheet for use in 
automobile manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
"Sammi has a history of only 20 years in specialty steel," Hwang said. "AL Tech 
has a history of more than 100 years, and our acquisition of it will enhance 
our technology." 
</P>
<P>
The purchase will bring Sammi's total production capacity to 1.5 million tons, 
making it one of the largest specialty steel firms in the world. The purchase 
will ensure that South Korea, for the first time, becomes self-sufficient in 
specialty steel other than hot coil.

FOOTNOTES: MORE ZOOM TO THE GALLON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Motorists with money to burn, Unocal Corp. has your number. 
</P>
<P>
It's 100, as in the octane of its racing-formula unleaded gasoline making a 
California debut this summer at three stations in Orange, Riverside and San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The high-performance fuel, designed for muscle cars from Alfas to turbo Zs, is 
made in Illinois and sold in about 450 stations in the East for a high-powered 
$2.50 a gallon. The price here is undetermined. 
</P>
<P>
C. O. Thompson Petroleum Inc. of Orange, which operates the three fuel 
stations, will be the first California distributor of the specialty gasoline. 
But Unocal does not plan to distribute the gas widely, even in car-crazy 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, not every Joe who drives in the street will buy this; people who 
race will," said Unocal spokesman Barry Lane. 
</P>
<P>
A Job for Romantics 
</P>
<P>
Are you a hopeless romantic and out of work? Well, does Korbel Champagne 
Cellars have a job for you: director of romance. 
</P>
<P>
The Guerneville, Calif.-based winery already has received numerous calls and a 
dozen roses from individuals responding to a help-wanted ad placed in the Wall 
Street Journal last week. The preferred candidate, it said, will have authored 
books or articles on romance, hold a degree in psychology, or "personify 
romance in some highly visible or glamorous way." 
</P>
<P>
The new director will replace astrologer Joyce Jillson, who left to further her 
publishing and writing career -- and will be responsible for such reports as 
"The State of Romance in the Nation" and the most romantic people of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The pay? "There is no salary established," said a Korbel spokeswoman. "It would 
depend on their background and experience." Kiss and tell. 
</P>
<P>
Don't Try to Burn This Flag 
</P>
<P>
When Supreme Court justices called flag-burning a legal form of protest, they 
prompted a venture to go with the controversy. While other Americans did a slow 
burn, Skipp Porteous established an operation that produces fireproof flags. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad we have the freedom to burn the flag, but I wouldn't do it," said 
Porteous, who supports the court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
He's selling the 12-inch-by-18-inch flags -- treated with a flame retardant 
called Cease Fire -- from his Great Barrington, Mass., mail order company for 
$10 each; a Sacramento man was among the first to order. 
</P>
<P>
The former writer said he'll use the proceeds to help finance a celebration of 
the 200th anniversary of the drafting of the Bill of Rights, a commemoration 
that begins in September. 
</P>
<P>
Said Porteous: "You can burn the flag. But you can't burn my flag." 
</P>
<P>
Be Yourself -- My Way 
</P>
<P>
Lots of would-be professional-school students are qualified in all ways but 
one: they freeze when asked to write a few words about themselves. That, 
anyway, is the theory behind a new book called "How to Write a Winning Personal 
Statement." 
</P>
<P>
Penned by West Los Angeles consultant Richard J. Steltzer, the 112-page book 
includes such suggestions as "review your life very carefully" and "be sure to 
answer the question." It also contains interviews with law, medical and 
business school admissions officers and examples of "successful" personal 
essays. 
</P>
<P>
How does the very existence of the book square with the notion that one should 
tell a truly personal story and not try to "psych out" the admissions committee 
by guessing what they're looking for? 
</P>
<P>
"It's advice to calm people's anxiety about where to begin," said Steltzer. "I 
ran into some very bright, successful people who had been staring at a blank 
sheet of paper for weeks."

New Name for Rice Brand: The Rice Growers Assn. of California has nearly three 
months to come up with a new name for its Hinode California Harvest brand. The 
Hinode California Harvest brand name for long-grain rice will disappear from 
grocery shelves by Sept. 25 under an agreement reached in a trademark 
infringement case. The agreement, subject to approval by a federal judge, will 
end legal action by Pacific International Rice Mills Inc. of Woodland against 
the association, a grower-owned co-op.

Appoint Environmentalists, Oil Firms Asked: State Controller Gray Davis, in a 
letter written with New York City Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin, called on six 
major oil companies to appoint an environmentalist to their boards as Exxon 
Corp. did after the Valdez oil spill. The two officials also recommended that 
the boards appoint committees to monitor environmental, worker health and 
safety policies. Davis wrote as trustee of two state pension plans that hold 
11.2 million shares of stock in the six companies; Goldin represented several 
New York City funds holding more than 2.3 million shares. The six companies 
were Amerada Hess, Amoco Corp., Ashland Oil, Kerr-McGee Corp., Pennzoil Co. and 
Tenneco.

GE Sued Over Vincennes Radar: Relatives of airliner passengers killed when the 
warship USS Vincennes shot down an Iran Air jet in the Persian Gulf a year ago 
have sued General Electric Corp., maker of the ship's radar system, spokesman 
Nagib Ghafoor said. The suit was filed in San Francisco on behalf of relatives 
of 83 of the 290 victims. The complaint charged that the radar equipment 
indicated that the aircraft approaching the Vincennes was an attacking F-14 
rather than the Iran Air flight.

AMI Deadline for Bids Passes: American Medical International's official 
deadline for the submission of acquisition bids expired Thursday. The Beverly 
Hills-based hospital management chain has sought bids in the wake of 
$1.8-billion acquisition proposal from a partnership led by Clayton &amp; 
Dubilier, a New York investment firm. The Clayton &amp; Dubilier offer expired 
June 15. AMI executives would not say whether the firm has received other bids.

CONTINENTAL DRASTICALLY CUTS FARES FOR 3 DAYS 
</P>

<P>
In a one-shot effort to sell tickets during the summer doldrums, Continental 
Airlines on Sunday launched what could become a short-term fare war by 
dramatically cutting prices on round-trips beginning later this week. 
</P>
<P>
The airline will charge a flat round-trip fare of $152 for some seats on nearly 
all of its 1,400 daily flights. To qualify for the fare, travelers must leave 
this Thursday, Friday or Saturday but they may return any time they like, 
beginning Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
United Airlines responded to Continental's announcement by saying that it will 
match the fares in all markets where the two carriers compete. Other airlines 
either could not be reached for comment or said they were still considering the 
fare cuts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big Savings 
</P>
<P>
With the one-time discount, a round-trip flight between Los Angeles and Newark, 
the airport Continental serves in the New York metropolitan area, will cost 
roughly half of the lowest "MaxSaver" fares. These round-trip fares normally 
range from $278 to $318, depending on when they are scheduled. A full, 
unrestricted one-way coach fare between the two cities costs $588. 
</P>
<P>
Continental said a family of four traveling between Boston and Los Angeles 
would save $744 from the lowest fares currently available. The fare would be 
$608 instead of $1,352 for the same travel on a regular discount ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Continental said it is offering the "Spirit of '76" fares -- the price will be 
$76 each way -- partly because it expects business travel to be light this 
week, with the Independence Day holiday falling on Tuesday. The airline said it 
is making more than 200,000 seats available at the low fares during the 
three-day sale period. 
</P>
<P>
Although airlines do not reveal the number of seats allocated to cut-rate 
fares, Ned Walker, a Continental spokesman, estimated that the average flight 
would carry about 50 passengers on the new low fares. Thus, on a Boeing 727 
flight, for example, more than a third of the seats will be allocated to the 
promotional fares. Continental's DC-9s carry about 100 passengers and its 
Boeing 747s have seats for about 400 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the MaxSaver fares pioneered by Continental in 1987 and matched by all 
of the other carriers, the "Spirit of '76" fares carry no restrictions, though 
they are not refundable. A traveler must make a return trip reservation at the 
time the ticket is purchased this weekend. However, for an extra $75 for each 
round-trip ticket, the return travel date may be changed. This would make the 
round-trip fare $227, still lower than the nearest low fare in many cases. 
</P>
<P>
"This may be a move by Continental to get the consumer to believe that low 
fares are not gone forever," said Paul Karos, airline analyst with First Boston 
Corp., a New York brokerage house. 
</P>
<P>
"There will always be promotions like this to fend off the backlash of 
travelers who are unhappy about higher airline fares." 
</P>
<P>
Karos added that "there is clearly elasticity in the industry when it comes to 
fares. As fares go up, the number of passengers comes down."

Leo's Discontinues Manufacturing: Leo's Industries said it would close down its 
30-employee home stereo manufacturing and wholesaling division to focus 
resources on its cellular telephone business. Leo's, which operates a 39-store 
stereo and electronics chain, said executives at its Long Beach-based ESS 
stereo subsidiary have offered to buy the division. The company blamed losses 
from ESS and one-time costs associated with closing the division for most of 
Leo's $2.4-million loss for the fiscal year ended March 31.

PICNICKING TO SUIT ANY STYLE; 
</P>
<P>
WHETHER THE OUTING CALLS FOR CHINA OR PAPER PLATES, A GAS GRILL OR CHARCOAL 
BRIQUETTES, SUPPLIERS ARE SET FOR SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
John Duncan gestured toward an artfully arranged display of imported English 
picnic baskets at the Marjorie Duncan &amp; Associates wholesale showroom in 
the L.A. Mart. They are, he pointed out, the real thing: made of sturdy wicker, 
lined with linen and filled with country-styled crockery, vacuum bottles and 
everything else a party of six might need. 
</P>
<P>
Those hampers, made by Brexton and found in such upscale retailers as Geary's 
of Beverly Hills, run about $400, Duncan said. More elaborate outfittings, 
featuring fine china, crystal and silver, can quickly send the price into the 
thousands of dollars. Such customized hampers hardly cater to a mass market, he 
observed, but "you only have to sell one." 
</P>
<P>
Although most California picnickers get by much more modestly, the Brextons 
find a steady market among those who enjoy the tradition of hauling what 
amounts to catered dinners to such venues as the Hollywood Bowl, whose season 
of picnics under the stars preceding concerts begins, incidentally, with a 
"preview" this evening. (Among caterers providing meals for these patrons: 
Tarzana-based Someone's in the Kitchen, offering a "Hollywood Bowl Feast" for 
four at $35 a person; Los Angeles' Along Came Mary, and Rococo Custom Caterers 
in Van Nuys.) 
</P>
<P>
But baskets are only the beginning when it comes to the picnic business. 
</P>
<P>
The Barbecue Industry Assn., a trade group based in the Chicago suburb of 
Naperville, Ill., expects spending on picnic items to top $6 billion in 1989 
for the second straight year. And that doesn't count the purchase of a hamper 
(or the occasional use of a caterer). 
</P>
<P>
Food and grocery items will account for nearly $5 billion, barbecue grills $565 
million, charcoal briquettes $434 million and lighters $145 million. Consumers 
will spend another $125 million on such gear as cooking tools and equipment -- 
not to mention such oddments as mitts, aprons and chef's toques. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gas More Convenient 
</P>
<P>
Grills fueled by charcoal briquettes, introduced more than 40 years ago, remain 
the nation's favorite in sales, accounting for 9.1 million of the 13.1 million 
grills sold last year. But gas-fired grills -- with sales of 3.85 million units 
-- have significantly closed the gap in this convenience-oriented decade. 
Electric grills are a distant third with 135,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been seeing the gradual growth and development of the gas grill over 
about the last decade," said Arthur W. Seeds, president of the Barbecue 
Industry Assn. "Most people like the charcoal grill because of the flavor, but 
the gas grill is winning favor among consumers who consider it more convenient 
in terms of lighting and cleanup." 
</P>
<P>
Speed and ease are important qualities to Baby Boomers, who now account for 
most of the population between the ages of 25 and 45, prime child-raising 
years. Because of the pressure of heavy work schedules in this age group, Seeds 
said, "they're looking for convenience." (Convenience also explains the fact 
that 14% of all charcoal sold last year was packed presoaked in lighter fluid 
and contained in self-lighting packages.) 
</P>
<P>
But tastes, too, are changing. 
</P>
<P>
More consumers are adding flavor agents. These include varieties of wood chips 
-- mostly mesquite, hickory, oak and fruitwood. A Northern California 
entrepreneur offers "Winesmoke," described as "a blend of California's finest 
grape cuttings" (though the label says nothing of which cuttings might best 
accompany fish, fowl or flank steak). And S.A.M. Sales, another wholesaler 
represented at the L.A. Mart, offers a charcoal-fired "water smoker" -- a metal 
cylinder fitted with a fire pit at the bottom that is topped successively by a 
water container (into which flavoring agents are added) and racks for the foods 
to be smoked. 
</P>
<P>
Seeds credited an extinct Burbank firm, Big Boy Grills, with pioneering 
development of deluxe grills. The more elaborate rigs are popular with serious 
patio chefs and professional caterers alike, he said, because they offer not 
only speed and easy cleanup but also stove-style burners beside the fire pit 
where the rest of a meal can be prepared. Such other amenities as windows in 
the hood for closer observation of smoking can boost prices to $300 to $600 and 
more. While these command only a small share of the total market nationally, he 
said, they are becoming a notable segment in Southern California, where outdoor 
cooking takes place all year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Use Lava Rocks 
</P>
<P>
"Grills are still very good buys," Seeds said, "and the market is very 
competitive." Thirty-nine manufacturers produced grills last year (a dozen 
specializing in gas, 13 in charcoal, the rest producing both). A Cleveland firm 
offers a bare-bones brazier at about $2, he said, and Weber's round "Smokey 
Joe" retails for less than $25. (Weber's mainstay, featuring a grill 22 inches 
across, costs about $70.) 
</P>
<P>
The big market for gas grills is in models costing from $150 to $200, Seeds 
said, but small units can be found for about $50. Gas grills heat reusable lava 
rocks, or some other radiating substance, so there is rapid and steady heat and 
no live coals to be disposed of later. 
</P>
<P>
So far, he said, gas grills are found most frequently in the Northeast. 
Californians seem to prefer charcoal barbecuing -- especially the new, 
easy-lighting varieties. And some time-pressed chefs in the Midwest are 
experimenting with use of microwave ovens to precook whole fowl and large 
roasts to be finished over charcoal just before eating. 
</P>
<P>
Regional differences are apparent in menu selection, as well. Cooks in the 
South and Southwest, for example, favor more highly spiced sauces and smoke 
flavorings, and they usually grill the plentiful and inexpensive chickens that 
the region produces, according to a consumer survey conducted for the Barbecue 
Industry Assn. Northeasterners, on the other hand, want their cooking 
"straight," Californians are experimenters, and coastal residents, not 
surprisingly, grill more fish than do other regional chefs, with salmon 
particularly favored in the Pacific Northwest. Beef, pork and sausages are 
popular fare in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, beef remains the leading picnic menu staple, Seeds said, though the 
national trend toward eating lighter and whiter (in terms of meat) is beginning 
to show up in outdoor cooking as well. 
</P>
<P>
"People are looking for ways to cut calories," he said, "and we try to sell 
them on doing that by cooking on the grill because the fat will drip out of the 
food. And people are cooking leaner cuts."

VOTERS GO TO POLLS AS MEXICO TESTS REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
With unprecedented scrutiny from the media and opposition political parties, 
voters went to the polls Sunday in five Mexican states, three of them highly 
competitive elections seen as key tests of Mexico's commitment to democratic 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
Major attention was focused on the governor's race here in Baja California and 
on contests for state legislatures in Michoacan and Chihuahua. These are 
considered critical measures of the reformist impulse of the ruling 
Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, and its national 
standard-bearer, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
</P>
<P>
Some early unofficial results from Tijuana, Baja California's most populous 
city, had the opposition National Action Party winning the governor's race by a 
substantial margin -- a result that, if it stands up, would signal a historic 
change in Mexican politics. 
</P>
<P>
President Salinas, who critics say owes his position to a rigged vote last 
year, has vowed to clean up elections nationwide as part of a perestroika-style 
apertura, or opening, of a Mexican political process that has long been 
dominated by the PRI. 
</P>
<P>
In the 60 years since it was founded, the PRI has never officially lost a 
governor's seat, a state legislature or the presidency, although opposition 
leaders say numerous elections have been stolen. Baja was the only governor's 
seat contested Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
State legislatures were also chosen in Baja, Campeche and Zacatecas, and some 
mayors' posts were on the ballot in Baja and Chihuahua. 
</P>
<P>
Even before initial voting tallies were released, representatives of both major 
political parties, the PRI and PAN -- as the National Action Party is known 
from its Spanish initials -- declared that their respective candidates had 
likely emerged victorious. The PRI even held a victory party in its Tijuana 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Election results were slow to filter in from Baja on Sunday night, in part 
because of widespread confusion in a number of Tijuana precincts. 
</P>
<P>
By 8 p.m., fully two hours after the polls were due to close, more than 100 
would-be voters in the outlying community of Sanchez Taboada were still waiting 
in line. Opposition groups attributed the confusion to a concerted PRI effort 
to hold down electoral turnout in the neighborhood, which is a stronghold of 
anti-government sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
The election in Michoacan also tested the Democratic Revolutionary Party of 
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, whose leftist coalition in last year's presidential 
elections confronted Mexican officialdom with the most serious electoral 
challenge in the history of the PRI. Michoacan is Cardenas' home state. 
</P>
<P>
The PRI lost both Baja and Michoacan in the presidential election and has run 
long, expensive campaigns in an effort to win them back. 
</P>
<P>
In Michoacan, the PRI-claimed victory in 10 of 18 electoral districts but was 
unable to provide figures to back up the assertion. The ruling party accused 
Cardenas of "proselytizing" on election day in the company of journalists. 
Irate Mexican reporters protested the charge during a ruling party press 
conference and demanded figures to back up the victory claim. 
</P>
<P>
It was still unclear whether PRI will take a majority of the state legislature. 
There are 18 direct-vote seats and six seats to be distributred proportionally 
among the minority parties. 
</P>
<P>
PRI officials charged that Cardenas supporters brought in out-of-state 
residents to vote, intimidated PRI supporters trying to cast ballots and stole 
ballot boxes, in addition to the charge of illegal campaigning on election day. 
</P>
<P>
In Baja, the PRI's gubernatorial candidate, Margarita Ortega Villa, a 
38-year-old sociologist who has served in a variety of electoral posts, faced a 
stiff challenge from Ernesto Ruffo Appel, a popular, 37-year-old former mayor 
of Ensenada and one-time fish-processing industry executive who is the 
candidate of the right-wing PAN. Polls showed that two other candidates 
representing left-of-center parties trailed badly. 
</P>
<P>
If elected, Ortega would be the third woman governor in Mexico's history and 
also the youngest-ever governor of Baja California, which became a state a 
quarter-century ago. She would also be the first-ever Baja native elected chief 
executive of the state, known for its huge numbers of migrants from other areas 
of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Handpicked for Job 
</P>
<P>
President Salinas, as is customary, handpicked Ortega as the Baja candidate, so 
her loss could be viewed as a humiliating defeat for his government. On the 
other hand, some experts say that a loss by Ortega -- if recognized by the PRI 
-- would bolster Salinas' claim that he is committed to substantive change. 
</P>
<P>
PAN officials mobilized hundreds of party workers and volunteers to help 
monitor the state's 1,164 polling places. PAN sympathizers with walkie-talkies 
traveled from voting station to station, checking frequent reports of 
irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the unprecedented vigilance, however, PAN charged that old-style PRI 
electoral chicanery was widespread. The opposition alleged that PRI 
sympathizers were voting numerous times, that PAN observers were being shut out 
from polling sites and that plans were in the works to "cook" the results once 
the ballots were collected by state electoral authorities, whose purported 
independence is questioned. 
</P>
<P>
PAN monitors outside one PRI stronghold in Tijuana reported the departure of 
buses filled, they said, with PRI loyalists being taken to vote in various 
areas of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"They (PRI officials) are doing what they have always done -- trying to steal 
the election," charged Hector Teran Teran, a representative of PAN's statewide 
electoral committee. 
</P>
<P>
At PRI headquarters a few blocks away, authorities dismissed such allegations. 
"We are respecting the electoral process," said Luis Morones, a PRI spokesman 
who expressed confidence that the party's candidate, Ortega, would vanquish the 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Similar confidence was also voiced by PAN followers, who expressed the view 
that they could only lose due to alquimia -- "alchemy," as electoral fraud here 
is known. 
</P>
<P>
At stake in Michoacan were 24 seats in the state legislature -- 18 district 
representatives by direct vote and six representatives by proportional vote. 
</P>
<P>
Turnout appeared to be low at several polling stations in Maravatio, where 
about 10% of the prospective voters either had not received their required 
credentials or did not find their names on voting lists. 
</P>
<P>
In each case, the Cardenistas argued with poll workers and charged that the 
government was systematically trying to prevent the opposition from voting. 
</P>
<P>
In the nearby town of Tungareo, poll secretary Nicolas Martinez said: "We (the 
PRI) lost here last year by a small margin. We are trying to conduct this 
election transparently, honestly and correctly." 
</P>
<P>
But Cardenas supporters, standing with arms crossed in the town's central 
plaza, claimed that they saw at least a dozen PRI supporters vote in more than 
one place and that minors were voting. They pointed to a group of boys nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Jorge Martinez and Rigoberto Villanueva, each wearing a PRI T-shirt, said they 
were 18 and voted for the ruling party. However, neither could show a voter 
credential or recall his birthday. 
</P>
<P>
"April 23, 1963," guessed Martinez. That would make him 26. 
</P>
<P>
But the PRI also had legitimate support in the farming town, which is home to 
the PRI candidate for its district. 
</P>
<P>
"We are PRIistas to the core," said Belen Lopez, 20. "The PRI has given us 
roads, schools, markets, Conasupo (state stores), electricity. And if our 
candidate wins, he is going to pave our road and put in drainage." 
</P>
<P>
News agencies reported that in the northern state of Chihuahua, where PAN is 
the strongest opposition party, voters elected mayors and 28 state legislators. 
The ruling PRI was expected to win elections in most of the 57 municipalities. 
</P>
<P>
Zacatecas, a PRI stronghold in central Mexico, registered a low turnout for the 
election of 15 state representatives. 
</P>
<P>
Fernando Loyo, head of the electoral commission in the Yucatan Peninsula state 
of Campeche, said voting for 28 state legislators went smoothly, although 
turnout was low. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell reported from Baja and Miller from Michoacan.

SOVIET UNION WAKES UP TO POVERTY

LENINGRAD, Soviet Union 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Elena Gareliv, 88, spooned tomato slices onto her plate as she described to a 
stranger her days before the Soviet Union's first soup kitchen opened its 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
"My monthly pension normally lasted two weeks. The rest of the time I could 
only afford bread and tea," she said, drawing knowing nods from the three women 
sitting around her. "And then, even when I could buy sausage, it was difficult 
to prepare a meal. I live alone and need a cane, you see." 
</P>
<P>
The fare may be plain and the tables rickety, but the presence of a soup 
kitchen off quiet Novoizmailovsky Prospekt in this maritime city has wrought a 
small miracle in the lives of 100 elderly Soviets. It provides a free midday 
meal five days a week and, perhaps as important, it offers a chance to escape 
loneliness, if only for 60 minutes a day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Small Miracle 
</P>
<P>
It also is a small miracle in the pages of Soviet history. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since the founding of this Communist country 72 years ago, Soviet 
officials have asserted that the state protects the social welfare of all, 
preventing unemployment, poverty or homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
"To acknowledge the existence of poverty was to acknowledge that this society 
has a class structure, and for obvious reasons, no one wanted to do that," one 
American specialist in the Soviet economy said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
But now, under the leadership of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, officials are 
slowly admitting that millions of people have fallen through the cracks of the 
social welfare system -- and that the state can use some help from private, 
voluntary organizations to cope with the problem of elderly poor. 
</P>
<P>
The process, however, is slow. The problem of elderly poor exists nationwide. 
Leningrad is one of the few cities where it is beginning to be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the American specialist, who asked not to be identified, noted: 
"Just by saying, 'Yes, we've got a problem,' they've taken a big step forward." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$95-a-Month Pensions 
</P>
<P>
One-fifth of the Soviet population is of retirement age, and, according to 
official estimates, more than one-third of the country's 58 million retirees 
receive pensions of less than 60 rubles a month, or about $95 at the official 
exchange rate. 
</P>
<P>
Those earning less than $120 a month are considered to be living below the 
Soviet poverty level, and Soviet officials privately acknowledge that as many 
as 50% of the country's elderly may fall into that category. 
</P>
<P>
Comparatively, 9% of the U.S. population, or 23.8 million people, are retirees 
receiving Social Security, and 1.4% of the population is composed of retirees 
living below the poverty level of $450 per person per month. 
</P>
<P>
In the Soviet Union, however, health care and housing are subsidized, generally 
costing only a few rubles a month. 
</P>
<P>
Zinieda A. Lavrov, 63, is among this country's elderly poor. A former worker in 
a clothing factory, she receives 52 rubles a month in pension. 
</P>
<P>
To understand how that translates in daily expenses, consider that Soviet 
economists estimate it costs a minimum of 30 rubles a month to feed one adult 
with only bread, porridge, milk and tea. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband, a journalist in Leningrad, died of a heart attack nine years ago, 
and things took a turn for the worse," Lavrov said in the city's soup kitchen 
over a healthy serving of cabbage soup. 
</P>
<P>
"The system was not able to care for me," she said. "I sold all my jewelry so I 
could have food, and then I didn't know what to do. Being able to come to this 
free cafeteria once a day has saved me." 
</P>
<P>
Pensions vary in the Soviet Union, but average about 45% of a person's salary 
at the time of retirement. Women who have worked for at least 20 years are 
eligible to receive pensions at the age of 55, and men who have worked at least 
25 years are eligible at age 60. 
</P>
<P>
Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, addressing the Soviet Union's newly elected 
legislators last month, drew sustained applause when he promised that a first 
task of the lawmaking Supreme Soviet would be to amend the 30-year-old law 
regulating pensions and to provide retirees with larger monthly allowances. But 
Soviet media have said the amendment, even once approved, is not expected to go 
into effect until 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, there is a desperate need for more free cafeterias like the one in 
Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Good Use of a Free Meal 
</P>
<P>
About one-quarter of Leningrad's population of 4.4 million is of retirement 
age, and many of those could make good use of a free meal a day, according to 
Nayalya P. Dyachenko, a founding member of the Leningrad Mercy Society, which 
opened the soup kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, she said, about 20,000 Leningraders are homeless and in need of 
help. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now in Leningrad, there are people dying from starvation," she said in 
an interview. 
</P>
<P>
But she said that opening more soup kitchens would not be easy. 
</P>
<P>
"Our society was founded two years ago with personal approval from Comrade 
Gorbachev. From the beginning, we wanted to open the soup kitchen, but we 
couldn't get permission," she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"The official position was that by its mere existence, the free cafeteria would 
show that there are people who are hungry and people who are poor," she said. 
"And in our schools we are taught such people do not exist in the Soviet 
Union." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opened With Donated Funds 
</P>
<P>
City officials finally relented, and the Leningrad Mercy Society, using funds 
donated by 14 professional organizations and trade unions, opened the soup 
kitchen in April. 
</P>
<P>
The meals change daily, but the ingredients are often the same, including 
potatoes and cabbage. Dyachenko estimates that running the free cafeteria for a 
year will cost the equivalent of $35,200. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have that much money right now, but we are sending volunteers out on 
the streets with jars to collect change," she said. "We're determined to keep 
the kitchen open." 
</P>
<P>
Poverty is not the only problem cited by the nation's elderly. Alienation is 
equally pervasive, and a need for companionship draws the elderly to 
Leningrad's soup kitchen as surely as hunger. 
</P>
<P>
"When I gave one woman a certificate to indicate she was entitled to free meals 
at our kitchen, she looked at me quite proudly and said she would give it a try 
only for a day or two," said Dr. Vladimir A. Lykianov, a Mercy Society 
volunteer who was given the task of selecting the 100 people living in the area 
of the soup kitchen and most in need of daily meals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'She Cried With Joy' 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw her a week later, she thanked me and cried with joy. It was not the 
food but the new friendships that made her so happy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most elderly Soviets who live below the poverty line are those whose nearest 
relatives have either died or live far away, because families in the Soviet 
Union usually take care of their own. Thus, the elderly poor here frequently 
have very little human contact, Lykianov said. 
</P>
<P>
Meals, remembered as a time of family sharing, can be particularly lonely. 
</P>
<P>
Rosa P. Solovyov, 63, with light blue eyes and a single bottom tooth, lives 
alone. A typist before retiring, she receives a pension of 60 rubles a month. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband died four years ago, and everything is so quiet now that he is 
gone," she said. "I don't eat much at home, but it's not the money only -- I 
just don't feel like eating." 
</P>
<P>
"Nor do I," added 81-year-old Agenya P. Lebediv, who was sitting across the 
table from Solovyov. "I am old now. I cannot see well enough to read, and it is 
hard to walk. At home I mostly lie in bed and listen to the radio." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Almost Like the Old Days 
</P>
<P>
But when they go out for their daily luncheons together, the women said, it is 
almost like the old days, when they were young. They put on their best clothes 
and pat their hair into place. They try to forget about aches and pains, both 
physical and mental. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't dwell on the bad times here," said 79-year-old Leida A. Dimetriv, who 
was wearing a bright red dress and a string of imitation pearls. 
</P>
<P>
"The hour we spend here is the best hour of the day," Dimetriv said, nodding 
firmly as she gestured at the lunch tables around her filled with elderly 
Leningraders. "We may be alone. We may be poor. But while we are here, we are 
merry widows."

<P>
Longtime foreign minister and former president Andrei A. Gromyko has died at 
age 79, Tass reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The official news agency did not give a cause of death, but a Foreign Ministry 
spokesman said on Friday that Gromyko was suffering from a vascular problem. 
</P>
<P>
Gromyko, whose career survived Kremlin purges and five leadership changes, was 
a glib spokesman for Soviet foreign policy and a stone-faced negotiator with 
Western leaders from Winston Churchill to Jimmy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
His tenure as foreign minister extended 26 years, lasting until July, 1985, 
when he became the Soviet Union's president, a ceremonial post but one that 
honored his past. 
</P>
<P>
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who succeeded Gromyko as president on Oct. 1, announced 
the statesman's death to the Supreme Soviet, the new legislature. The deputies 
stood to honor Gromyko's memory, Tass reported. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to being replaced as president, Gromyko also was retired from the 
Communist Party's ruling Politburo last fall. 
</P>
<P>
In April, he was retired from the policy-making Central Committee along with 
dozens of other senior officials, to make way for new blood in the leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Under Gorbachev, the Communist Party chief, the post of president became more 
powerful. 
</P>
<P>
Gromyko died Sunday, Tass reported without giving details. 
</P>
<P>
In confirming rumors that Gromyko was in poor health, Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh had said last week Gromyko was hospitalized for "a 
vascular pathology phenomenon which demanded surgical intervention." 
</P>
<P>
Before becoming foreign minister in 1957, Gromyko had served as ambassador to 
the United States, the United Nations and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
As a diplomat, ambassador and foreign minister, he helped forge the 
Soviet-American World War II alliance, joined in drafting the United Nations 
Charter and sat in on superpower talks that shaped the face of the modern 
world. 
</P>
<P>
He also was the man who taught Americans and others what the Russian word 
"nyet" meant during his years as the Soviet ambassador to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
His long tenure as foreign minister -- under five Kremlin leaders -- attested 
to the competence that enabled him to survive the political upheavals in the 
Soviet Union. In negotiations, he knew when to take a hard stance, when to 
bully and when to compromise -- with unrelenting patience. 
</P>
<P>
A more detailed obituary on Andrei A. Gromyko will appear in Tuesday's editions 
of The Times.

ANACHRONISM FOR SALE: NEWPORT'S 'FUN ZONE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Speth is rolling up the tarpaulin around the merry-go-round. Joe Tunstall 
unlocks a door and considers the bumper cars, which must get their 
twice-monthly oiling today. A soft breeze off the harbor ruffles the canvas 
tarpaulin, and the water sparkles in the sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
As he works, Tunstall reflects on how owning this amusement park looked like so 
much fun when he was a child, and how much work it is now. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fun Zone's no fun anymore," said Tunstall, 51. 
</P>
<P>
So Tunstall and Speth want to sell the bumper cars and the merry-go-round, the 
small Ferris wheel, the fun house and other amusement park equipment. If they 
do, another milestone will have been reached in the 53-year history of the Fun 
Zone: The new operator is likely to be a big corporation, possibly one of the 
giant Southern California amusement parks. 
</P>
<P>
The milestones have been coming faster lately. Last year the Japanese, after 
spending $43 billion on U.S. office buildings, hotels and shopping centers in 
the last few years, finally discovered the Fun Zone. A restaurateur from Osaka 
bought the land and building that house the amusement park for $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
Three years earlier, a former owner razed the original Fun Zone, which included 
among its collection of shopworn structures some of the buildings from the 
boatyard that occupied the site in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
In its place is a 1 1/2-story building of drab yellow wood that takes up a 
hundred yards or so of prime waterfront real estate on the Balboa Peninsula, 
which shelters Newport Harbor from the open sea. 
</P>
<P>
The little Newport Beach amusement park became an anachronism a decade ago, 
outliving two larger competitors to become the last seaside amusement park in 
the Los Angeles area. The Fun Zone has remained an Orange County landmark, even 
if it seems Lilliputian alongside Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't long after the park opened in 1936 that the Fun Zone and the 
Rendezvous Ballroom, a few blocks away, were attracting enough people to cause 
traffic jams on Pacific Coast Highway, which had only two lanes then. Motorists 
would park on the beach right up to the surf -- there were few parking lots 
then -- and when big bands like Tommy Dorsey's finished playing in the 
ballroom, the audience would help push the cars back onto the road. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rendezvous Ballroom Burns 
</P>
<P>
The Rendezvous, however, burned down in 1966, the day after a rock group called 
the Cindermen played there. It was replaced by condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
The Fun Zone almost ended up as condos, too. The original owner, a man named Al 
Anderson, filed for bankruptcy in 1957 after a teen-ager was injured diving off 
Anderson's dock and sued. In 1961 Anderson sold the Fun Zone for $305,000. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, as waterfront real estate appreciated, the owners of Southern 
California's bigger seaside amusement parks realized that they could make a lot 
more money using the land for something else. Pacific Ocean Park in Santa 
Monica was razed in 1975 and the Pike Amusement Park in Long Beach bit the dust 
three years later. 
</P>
<P>
Developers also began to covet the Fun Zone's more modest three-quarters of an 
acre, which overlooks the thickets of sailboat masts in Newport Harbor and 
affluent Balboa Island -- like a moated castle -- just a few hundred yards 
across the water. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, a developer bought the park and persuaded the city of Newport Beach to 
let him tear it down and build 47 expensive condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State Rescues Fun Zone 
</P>
<P>
Only state intervention saved the amusement park from extinction. In 1974, the 
newly formed California Coastal Commission said condos would conflict with the 
commercial character of the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The Fun Zone property changed hands a few more times. By 1981, it was sold for 
$3.75 million, but it drifted along with the rest of the neighborhood, getting 
older and shabbier. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Los Angeles lawyer Jordan M. Wank tore down the old Fun Zone 
buildings. The new Zone -- a spiffier, cleaned-up version of the old honky-tonk 
Fun Zone, with 30 yacht slips instead of an open beach -- opened in 1986. Then 
last year Wank sold it to Haruo Nakahara, who is said to own more than a dozen 
restaurants around Osaka through a private company called Shintoyo Ltd. He also 
bought a small office building in Los Angeles in 1987, his first U.S. purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Nakahara is part of a second wave of Japanese real estate investment in the 
United States. The giant life insurance companies and real estate concerns got 
here first and have already lumbered over the landscape, picking off the big 
buildings that were for sale. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Smaller Investors Mop Up 
</P>
<P>
Now the smaller investors are mopping up, buying properties too small for the 
big guys to bother with. 
</P>
<P>
Like Japanese buyers are sometimes said to do, Nakahara may have overpaid, 
according to some local real estate experts. 
</P>
<P>
Here's why: A couple of the small shops in the Fun Zone building are empty, 
like missing teeth. The merchants sometimes fold shortly after moving in. A 
photo shop, for instance, lasted only two days. 
</P>
<P>
"Stores go in and out of there like yo-yos," said one local real estate agent. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, the shops in the new Fun Zone building had an 80% turnover rate, 
said the building's former manager. Business booms in the summer -- 30,000 
people got on the Ferris wheel last August, for instance -- and dwindles in the 
doldrums of winter, when the Ferris wheel has only about 4,500 riders a month 
and business tails off for the Fun Zone's bikini shops and fast-food stores. 
</P>
<P>
"This neighborhood lives and dies with the sun," said Mel Fuchs, a local real 
estate broker with an office around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traffic Strangles Peninsula 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the traffic: Two-thirds of the Balboa Peninsula often strangles on 
traffic on Friday and Saturday nights, most of the cars filled with young 
cruisers. 
</P>
<P>
When you finally get to the Fun Zone, there's often no place to park. The 
narrow, sandy peninsula is no more than 500 yards across at its widest point 
and the houses squat cheek by jowl on both the ocean and bay sides. There are 
few places left on which to squeeze a parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"The parking problem may well be insoluble," said Bret B. Bernard, an associate 
city planner assigned to study the neighborhood. Many homeowners on the 
peninsula oppose more parking, he said, believing it will only draw more 
tourists and more traffic to the already crowded peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's the neighborhood's acute case of retailing schizophrenia: You 
can often find expensive restaurants next door to the typical tourist shops 
found at many California beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Residents, who get more affluent toward the end of the peninsula, "feel the 
area needs more neighborhood services, like dry cleaners," said Bernard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
T-Shirt and Bikini Business 
</P>
<P>
But that's not likely. "It's at a point where it can get more schlocky or less 
schlocky. But more and more, it's becoming a T-shirt and bikini business down 
there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nakahara was aware of these problems when he bought the Fun Zone property, said 
Yoji Nobunaga, his U.S. investment adviser. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew a little bit of the history of the Fun Zone, but we also knew it was a 
good location," said Nobunaga. "Nakahara's typical of the middle-market 
investor from Japan. They're very careful, and they're very shrewd business 
people. He won't buy just anything." 
</P>
<P>
The Fun Zone appealed to the Japanese restaurateur because he could buy the 
building and the land outright. Most commercial buildings in that part of 
Newport Beach, says Nobunaga, are built on leased land. The Japanese tend to 
hold real estate for a long time, and the Fun Zone's three-quarters of an acre 
on the dense peninsula can only increase in value. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looking for Buyers 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Tunstall has been looking for buyers for the amusement park equipment 
for several months. Dressed in denim jacket and jeans, he strolls the 
waterfront on his way to get coffee -- anything to delay the oiling of the 
bumper cars. 
</P>
<P>
Tunstall and Speth started working at the old Fun Zone as eighth-graders in the 
1940s. Their dream was to own the place. Speth, now a Fountain Valley 
firefighter, bought the Ferris wheel right out of high school and ran it for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Tunstall opened a bicycle dealership in Fountain Valley, which grew large 
enough to allow him to retire at 39 and indulge his passion for carnival rides. 
A small train runs around the barn at his farm and an old tilt-a-whirl swirls 
nearby, all bought from vanished amusement parks. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago Speth and Tunstall came back to run the new Fun Zone's rides. 
It wasn't quite the same. The old Ferris wheel, a 1918 portable model made by 
Eli Bridge Co., was gone. (The company was so named because its investors 
thought the Ferris wheel business might be a bust, and the company would have 
to switch to bridge building.) The old Ferris wheel was too aged to have lasted 
much longer, but Tunstall still speaks wistfully of finding parts of the old 
Ferris wheel a few years ago in the debris from the construction of the new Fun 
Zone. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ferris Wheel Profitable 
</P>
<P>
The two men bought a new Ferris wheel for about $60,000. It generates one of 
the biggest pieces of a yearly profit of about $370,000 before taxes, according 
to Speth and Tunstall. (The arcade games are the most profitable attraction, 
followed by the bumper cars, they say.) That profit is on sales of about $1 
million a year, the two men said, an enviable profit margin. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any product costs," said Tunstall, sipping his coffee at a table 
overlooking the harbor. "We're not giving people something like a hamburger for 
their money." 
</P>
<P>
They're selling, they say, because they don't want to spend all their time 
running an amusement park. Among those interested in buying are several big 
Southern California amusement parks, Tunstall said. Nakahara, too, has made an 
offer, said Tunstall, although it was below the $2.5 million he wants. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Japanese bought the rides, they'd definitely have the cash flow to make 
this project work," said Tunstall. "But they have to make a serious offer." 
</P>
<P>
Whoever buys, it seems likely the little amusement park will be around well 
into the next century. With the bumper cars, the Ferris wheel and the rest 
comes a 13-year lease with a 10-year option. Altogether, there are 22 more 
years to go on the lease. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Zoning Restrictions 
</P>
<P>
The zoning and code restrictions on the lot are also tight enough to make 
building something else there difficult. The city of Newport Beach allows 
construction only to a maximum of three stories. And offices -- which one owner 
once proposed for the site -- aren't allowed by the zoning. So it appears 
Nakahara is going to be in the amusement park business for some time. And 
that's OK with him, said Nobunaga, his investment adviser. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, we have quite a few things to do to make it more attractive," 
Nobunaga said. 
</P>
<P>
"But the Fun Zone will stay the Fun Zone."

Youths playing with smoke bombs apparently unleashed a fire that swept across 
300 acres in San Bernardino County, and 250 acres were burned in Riverside 
County, which was hit last week by a 7,840-acre fire that was nearing full 
control, authorities said. Another blaze that blackened 203 acres on the edge 
of Sequoia National Park over the weekend was brought under control. Witnesses 
told officials they saw three youngsters playing with the fireworks north of 
San Bernardino, said U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Lindsay Maierhofer. There 
were no immediate arrests, she added, saying the fire charred 100 acres of the 
San Bernardino National Forest and 200 acres of county land. "The temperatures 
are hot and the terrain is very difficult," Maierhofer said. (Related story,

STATE COUNTS ON 1% SAMPLE TO DETECT FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TROMBLEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California election officials count heavily on a 1% manual recount of randomly 
selected precincts to protect against inaccuracy and fraud in election returns 
that are counted by computer. 
</P>
<P>
The state-mandated 1% hand count is "the last check on the system," said 
Deborah Seiler, assistant to the secretary of state for elections and political 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing we have going is that 1% manual recount," said Ralph C. 
Heikkila, who is in charge of elections in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The county actually counts more than 1% since state law also requires that at 
least one precinct in each ballot style be counted by hand. In last November's 
general election the county used 388 different ballot styles, with voters 
divided into congressional districts, Assembly districts, school board 
districts, etc. This meant that 100 precincts, or about 1.5% of the total, were 
hand counted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Statisticians Doubtful 
</P>
<P>
But is a 1% or 1.5% manual recount enough to catch error or fraud? 
Statisticians consulted by The Times were doubtful. 
</P>
<P>
The chances of finding one wrong precinct out of 7,000 (there were about 6,200 
in Los Angeles County in November, 1988) would be about 1 in 100, according to 
Donald Ylvisaker, director of the Division of Statistics at UCLA. But if 1%, or 
70, of the precincts were bad, then the prospect of finding one or more of them 
with a 1% hand count would rise to 1 in 2, Ylvisaker added. 
</P>
<P>
Solomon W. Golomb, professor of electrical engineering and systems engineering 
at USC, agreed with this calculation. 
</P>
<P>
"If you sample 1% of 7,000 precincts, and there are 70 precincts with problems, 
the chance that you would pick one up is almost 50-50," Golomb said. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is systematic, widespread fraud going on, they have a reasonable 
chance of finding it with a 1% check," Golomb added. "But if it is limited to a 
few precincts, the chances are much poorer." 
</P>
<P>
Both Ylvisaker and Golomb pointed out that sampling 5%, or even 3%, of the 
precincts, would substantially increase the chances of detecting error or 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Robert J. Naegele, California's chief consultant on computerized vote 
tabulation, said he recommended 10 years ago that 10% of the precincts be 
recounted by hand but the secretary of state's office said that would be too 
expensive. 
</P>
<P>
One estimate is that the 1% recount cost about $350,000 statewide in November, 
1988. A 3% recount would cost slightly more than $1 million and a 5% recount 
would cost about $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
But Heikkila of Los Angeles County said more than cost is involved. He said a 
larger sample would not necessarily improve the chances of finding error or 
fraud. Heikkila pointed out that candidates, campaign advisers, journalists, 
political analysts, university professors and others "pore over these results 
long after the election is over." 
</P>
<P>
"They know the voting patterns," he added. "If something is off, they'll find 
it" faster than a hand recount of any percentage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1.5% Recount Questioned 
</P>
<P>
But Naegele replied, "even if these people find something, it's after the fact; 
the election is over. The time to prevent mistakes is before the election, not 
after." 
</P>
<P>
Roy G. Saltman of the federal government's Institute for Computer Sciences and 
Technology described a situation in which the 1.5% recount used by Los Angeles 
and many others would be inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
Saltman said a clever perpetrator of fraud "would select an intermediate number 
of precincts and make changes small enough" so that neither election officials 
nor party workers would detect them. 
</P>
<P>
"In that case, you're dealing with a simple statistical problem," Saltman said. 
"How many precincts do you have to check to find a bad one? In most cases, I 
think 4% or 5% of the precincts would do it . . . but in that kind of 
situation, 1% is clearly not enough."

SAVED FROM POUND, HE POUNDS POLICE BEAT

<P>
Just a few months back, he was on doggie death row, a scruffy mutt so hyper 
that animal control officers called him Spaz -- for spastic -- and couldn't 
give him away. 
</P>
<P>
Today, he's the desert's most famous pooch, a celebrity canine winning 
accolades that would make Spuds McKenzie howl with envy. 
</P>
<P>
Meet Popeye, the Palm Springs Drug Dog. 
</P>
<P>
Adopted by this resort city's Police Department, Popeye has evolved almost 
overnight from a sick stray into Palm Springs' first drug-sniffing hound. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing," said Officer Pat Beltz, Popeye's handler and trainer for the 
department's K-9 unit. "He was doomed. . . . He was days away from death. And 
now he's working for the City of Palm Springs." 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, young Popeye, a black and white beagle-spaniel mix, is already 
earning his Alpo. Trained to aid police in their search for narcotics secreted 
in homes, luggage, mail or any other place, Popeye has detected cocaine in a 
package, marijuana under a mattress and drug-tainted money in a locked steel 
box. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Customs agents frequently seek his help in airport searches, and his 
trained nose has been in demand by the California Highway Patrol as well. Palm 
Springs High School officials have also enlisted Popeye's help, deploying his 
talents on student lockers. 
</P>
<P>
His colleagues on the five-dog K-9 unit may be huskier, handsomer and boast 
more impressive bloodlines, but Popeye already has become an instant hit with 
the public. At demonstrations, where kids and other dog lovers traditionally 
cheer the big, burly specimens used to bite and tackle suspects, Popeye now 
captures the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
"He steals the show," said Beltz, who boards Popeye in a custom-built, 
city-financed $1,000 doghouse in his back yard. "He's little and so funny 
looking that he just stands out in the crowd." 
</P>
<P>
He's been booked on radio talk shows -- he barks on command -- and, who knows, 
Oprah and Donahue could be next. 
</P>
<P>
Palm Springs may be teeming with celebrities, but this one had a decidedly 
rapid rise to glory. Found wandering the streets in February, the dog was 
friendly but "basically too hyper for anyone to adopt," recalled Palm Springs 
Animal Control Officer Ted Nickerson. 
</P>
<P>
"We nicknamed him Spaz because all he'd do in the kennel was bounce, up and 
down, up and down," Nickerson said. "His behavior scared everybody away." 
</P>
<P>
As conditions at the pound grew crowded, Nickerson realized Spaz would have to 
go. Then Beltz spotted him. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd been looking since last year for a dog we could train to sniff for drugs, 
and the animal control people had called me that day about two dogs they 
thought might be suitable," Beltz said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Passed With Flying Colors 
</P>
<P>
Neither passed muster, but as Beltz was leaving, he saw Spaz "jumping up and 
down, real high." Figuring this dog might have the energy demanded by the work, 
Beltz ran him through a series of tests that involve fetching wood, metal, 
plastic and rubber toys under varying circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"He passed with flying colors. I took him home," Beltz said. 
</P>
<P>
He also renamed him Popeye, after Popeye Doyle, the tough, drug-busting cop 
character played by Gene Hackman in the film, "The French Connection." 
</P>
<P>
Training began in earnest, and soon he had his debut, alerting officers to a 
steel box of drug-contaminated money found at a parole violator's home. 
</P>
<P>
At just 28 pounds, Popeye is much smaller than his brothers on the K-9 corps, 
some of whom are three times his bulk. He lacks the fine breeding of his 
imported peers -- German shepherds Basko and Kiwi and Belgian malinois Dago and 
Dingo -- and he came much cheaper: free, versus the roughly $3,000 apiece paid 
for the other dogs. 
</P>
<P>
But by all appearances, Popeye couldn't care less. At Beltz's home, Popeye did 
a dozen or so laps of the yard under a blazing desert sun, and then paused to 
perform a mock search of a truck with marijuana hidden in the front bumper. 
</P>
<P>
"Wo est gifte?" said Beltz, as the dog began his frantic hunt. The command -- 
"Where is the poison" -- was in German, the language used to address all city 
police dogs. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-eight seconds later, Popeye had found it. Visibly pleased with himself, 
the little mongrel gave a bark and went bounding off across the grass, twirling 
and jumping, happy to be alive.

The U.S. Embassy in Beijing has evidence that the shooting by Chinese soldiers 
last month at foreign diplomats' apartments was a planned, coordinated attack, 
U.S. officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The officials, who declined to be identified, said the U.S. Embassy will likely 
lodge a new complaint this week with the Chinese Foreign Ministry over findings 
in a report compiled last week on the June 7 shooting incident. 
</P>
<P>
An embassy investigation of the incident indicated that a Chinese soldier 
directed the gunfire and that some shooting may have come from a nearby 
building, along with that from troops on a street below the diplomats' 
apartments, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Several Americans and other foreigners, including children, narrowly escaped 
injury when the Chinese troops fired hundreds of bullets into the front of a 
high-rise apartment building in a compound where foreign diplomats and 
journalists reside. The Chinese government said the soldiers were firing at a 
sniper. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting came four days after the Chinese army brutally suppressed the 
democracy movement, cleared central Tian An Men Square of thousands of 
student-led protesters and enforced the martial-law decree announced May 20.

UNREST IN BLACK HOMELAND IN S. AFRICA LEAVES 11 DEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bitter dispute over South Africa's homelands policy erupted in weekend 
rioting, leaving nine black police officers and two civilians dead in 
Leeuwfontein, a village recently forced by Pretoria to become part of the 
nominally independent homeland of Bophuthatswana. 
</P>
<P>
Bophuthatswana police went door to door Sunday, arresting at least several 
hundred residents of the town, including two key tribal leaders. And police 
helicopters scoured the countryside for others who had fled onto white-owned 
farms in South Africa seeking refuge. By nightfall, only a few women and 
children remained in the shacks of the rural community of 18,000. 
</P>
<P>
The melee came six months after South Africa's white minority-led government 
decreed that Leeuwfontein and next-door Braklaagte were to become part of 
Bophuthatswana, a homeland comprising seven separate tracts of land inside 
South Africa. So far, court challenges to the South African proclamation have 
been unsuccessful, and the angry residents are seeking permission to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Desperate Point' 
</P>
<P>
"It had reached a very desperate point where people had lost faith in anything 
ever returning to normal," Aninka Claassens, a spokesman for the Transvaal 
Rural Action Committee, said in an interview Sunday night. "They had tried 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
The Action Committee provides legal support for Leeuwfontein and Braklaagte and 
has worked extensively in the towns, about 180 miles northwest of Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
The violence was the latest in a series of incidents that have hampered 
Pretoria's 13-year-old attempt to force blacks into ethnic homelands, thereby 
depriving them of their South African citizenship. More than 11 million of 
South Africa's 26 million blacks live in 10 homelands, four of which, like 
Bophuthatswana, have been declared independent states but remain almost totally 
dependent on South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Recognition 
</P>
<P>
Most of the world refuses to recognize the Pretoria-created homelands as 
sovereign states. In fact, international anti-apartheid groups have 
consistently called on entertainers to boycott the Sun City casino resort, 
which is located in Bophuthatswana and pays taxes to its 12-year-old black 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The latest trouble broke out Saturday afternoon during a meeting of several 
thousand Leeuwfontein residents that was called to discuss the efforts to 
extricate themselves from Bophuthatswana's control. The town's population had 
swelled because it was the end of the month and many migrant workers had 
returned home with their paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents said fighting erupted after police arrived to break up the 
meeting. Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd, and 
witnesses said they heard automatic weapons fire. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Four Officers Killed 
</P>
<P>
The Bophuthatswana authorities said four police officers were killed when their 
armored personnel carrier was destroyed by a gasoline bomb. South African 
authorities, who last year stepped in to put down an attempted military coup 
d'etat in Bophuthatswana's capital, Mmabatho, said they were not involved in 
the weekend incidents. 
</P>
<P>
But Paul van der Merwe, a farmer who lives near Leeuwfontein, said he saw South 
African security forces on Sunday conferring with Bophuthatswana police 
officials on a remote section of his farm, in South Africa just outside the 
Bophuthatswana border. 
</P>
<P>
Van der Merwe said dozens of residents of Leeuwfontein have used his farm to 
escape harassment by the Bophuthatswana police in recent months. And the farmer 
has refused requests by South African and Bophuthatswana authorities to press 
charges against the villagers for trespassing, saying he relies on them to help 
him plant and harvest his 4,000-acre farm and ranch. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to do that. We are neighbors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Before Jan. 1, the land that includes Leeuwfontein and Braklaagte had been part 
of South Africa, in between two distinct sections of Bophuthatswana. The 
government proclamation incorporating the two villages into the homeland 
surprised most residents, who said they had not been consulted, as required by 
South African law. 
</P>
<P>
The two communities didn't want to lose their South African citizenship, but 
they also feared retribution from Bophuthatswana authorities. The region's 
Tswana tribal chiefs have been violently opposed to Bophuthatswana's South 
Africa-supported president, Lucas Manyane Mangope, also a Tswana chief, since 
the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Patrolled by Police 
</P>
<P>
Since they became part of Bophuthatswana, Leeuwfontein and Braklaagte have been 
heavily patrolled by the homeland police, and sporadic violence has been 
reported. Eighty people were injured during a police raid in Leeuwfontein in 
March, and residents said that the authorities beat or arrested anyone who 
refused to say they loved Bophuthatswana. 
</P>
<P>
About one-third of South Africa's residents -- or about half of the nation's 
blacks -- live in the homelands, which cover only 13% of the country's land 
area. Pretoria's original intent was to counter the increasing demands for 
black voting rights in South Africa by creating independent states outside 
white-designated South Africa where the country's voteless black majority could 
exercise their political rights. 
</P>
<P>
But the policy has been a drain on Pretoria's coffers, and it has come under 
heavy criticism from outside and inside the government in recent years. South 
Africa spends more than $1 billion annually supporting the homeland 
governments, but, because the land is generally rugged and the homeland leaders 
often corrupt, poverty remains endemic.

NICARAGUAN POLICE BREAK UP SKIRMISH BETWEEN SANDINISTAS AND FOES AFTER MARCH

LEON, Nicaragua 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Riot police intervened Sunday to separate dozens of Sandinista and opposition 
activists who rushed at each other in downtown Leon after a march by 1,200 
people seeking the Sandinista government's electoral defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody was injured or arrested in the few brief skirmishes that occurred, but 
the incident was a sign that the campaign for national elections next February 
could be as physical as it is political. 
</P>
<P>
Leon, 53 miles northwest of Managua, was a guerrilla stronghold during the 
Sandinista-led uprising that toppled the dictatorship of President Anastasio 
Somoza. The leftist Sandinista Front, which is marking its 10th anniversary in 
power this month, and the 14-party National Opposition Union had police permits 
to march along different routes of the city's cobblestone streets to separate 
destinations. 
</P>
<P>
The confrontation started when dozens of young Sandinistas strayed from their 
route and fell in step behind the opposition parade, taunting the marchers. 
</P>
<P>
"We won power with arms in our hands, so we have a right to these streets," 
said a 25-year-old Sandinista combat veteran who identified himself only as 
Manuel. "We are here to repudiate these people, who are trying to deceive the 
people and bring back Somocismo (the Somoza dictatorship)." 
</P>
<P>
"What is the vanguard of the people?" chanted Manuel and his companions. "The 
Sandinista Front!" 
</P>
<P>
But the opposition marchers kept moving, livened by brass bands, firecrackers 
and insults against the Sandinistas at their heels. "What do the people want?" 
they shouted. "For the front to go away!" 
</P>
<P>
A brief scuffle erupted when a young woman in the opposition camp tried to grab 
a red-and-black Sandinista banner, but security people on both sides kept order 
until the marchers reached a Gothic-style Roman Catholic church at the end of 
the mile-long route. 
</P>
<P>
There, in the 91-degree midday heat, groups of 50 to 100 people on each side 
charged at each other until helmeted Sandinista police with shields and clubs 
intervened. Capt. Ernesto Cuadra, the police chief in Leon, intervened 
personally to stop at least two fistfights and finally ordered the Sandinista 
militants to withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
Then, at the urging of the police, an opposition organizer used a police car 
megaphone to instruct anti-government marchers to withdraw, and both crowds 
slowly dispersed. 
</P>
<P>
Violent harassment by Sandinista gangs known as turbas marred the 1984 election 
campaign, prompting the largest opposition coalition to withdraw. Duilio 
Baltodano, a leader of Sunday's march, said the return of the turbas shows that 
the Sandinistas "don't have the political will to respect the electoral 
process." 
</P>
<P>
But another opposition leader, Ulises Somarriba, declared that the marchers had 
won a victory because "the Sandinistas tried to run us off the streets or to 
provoke violence, but they failed."

Parishioners at a Roman Catholic church held a prayer service Sunday, a week 
after the church was ordered to close. About 50 members of Mother of 
Consolation Church were at the service, which was not a formal Mass, said Dario 
Guidarini, president of the parish council. 
</P>
<P>
The church was among 30 ordered closed or merged with other congregations 
because of declining memberships, a shortage of priests and the costs of 
maintaining the large churches.

<P>
It is the journalistic equivalent of the surgeon who has to operate on himself, 
or the lawyer with a fool for a client. 
</P>
<P>
It is a news organization trying to cover itself or the activities of its 
owners. And it is a problem as old as the first time a publisher ever made 
news. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in an era of global media concentration, it is reaching a critical mass. 
</P>
<P>
The latest victim is Time magazine, whose parent, Time Inc., is locked in a 
titanic struggle to merge with Warner Communications and fend off a hostile 
takeover bid by Paramount Communications. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Time did not even cover the story, and when it did many thought its 
coverage was tilted toward Time Inc.'s point of view. Inside Time, resentment 
over the story has gotten so close to the surface that last week Time Inc. 
Editor-in-Chief Jason McManus was asked in a staff meeting if he was even 
qualified to edit the magazine's stories on the subject while he was also a 
director of the corporation trying to battle Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
McManus dismissed any conflict. "The board (of directors) job is not a very 
meaningful part of my duties," he asserted in an interview later. And in any 
case, "anybody can fulfill two roles at the same time and maintain a wall 
between them in his mind." 
</P>
<P>
Said one disgruntled Time writer who asked for anonymity: "There are many who 
think he's proven himself a complete corporate lackey." 
</P>
<P>
The Time case and others raise a serious question: If, as some predict, the 
media industry is consolidating into perhaps a dozen multinational 
mega-companies dominating global communications, does that pose a threat to 
free speech? 
</P>
<P>
When giant General Electric owns NBC, is the network's news division really 
free to report aggressively on the weapons industry, on nuclear power or on 
Wall Street -- all businesses in which GE is involved? When TV Guide is owned 
by Rupert Murdoch, can it be trusted not to try to help Murdoch's Fox network? 
</P>
<P>
So far, even critics can point to few incidents of active corporate meddling in 
these larger companies. And many journalists say their corporate owners know 
that tampering with the credibility of their news organizations ultimately is 
the path to financial ruin. 
</P>
<P>
But that may not settle the issue. Even aggressive journalists concede that 
corporate consolidation only aggravates the age-old hassles of reporting on 
one's bosses, and increases the chances that journalists will censor 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
And, more importantly perhaps, many of these mergers are altering the corporate 
culture of media companies. In these new, larger diversified corporations, 
journalism often represents a smaller share of the interests and profits, and 
the ripple effects of such a change can make important differences in who gets 
rewarded and why. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of concern," said one Time reporter, "that the editorial 
independence we so bravely defend in our fight against Paramount has already 
been sacrificed in our coverage of the Time-Warner defense." 
</P>
<P>
One of the more obvious, if least life-threatening, problems caused by 
consolidation came in 1981 when the Chicago Tribune's corporate parent, Tribune 
Co., bought the Chicago Cubs to provide cheap but popular baseball programming 
for the Tribune's television station, WGN. 
</P>
<P>
How could the Chicago Tribune then credibly cover the Cubs? 
</P>
<P>
Editor Jim Squires went out and hired the respected baseball writer from the 
rival Sun Times, Jerome Holtzman. "From that point on the Cubs problem went 
away," Squires contended. 
</P>
<P>
But pressure from within his own company did not. Squires said that for a time, 
"a sense of unhappiness (was) not too subtly conveyed to me through the 
grapevine of the Tribune hierarchy about how the paper was bending over 
backwards to be ugly and unkind to the Cubs." 
</P>
<P>
And, said Squires, other complications arose. When the Cubs were trying to get 
permission for lights in Wrigley Field, he said, politicians from the governor 
to the Chicago City Council repeatedly tried to win editorial reprieve from the 
paper in exchange for legislative support to the ball club. 
</P>
<P>
"If a lobbyist from the Cubs goes to Springfield," said Squires, "the first 
thing anybody wants to talk about is my editorial page." 
</P>
<P>
Arguably more important issues were raised a few years later in 1986 when NBC 
and its news division suddenly found itself being bought by gigantic General 
Electric Corp. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Businesses 
</P>
<P>
If GE "makes good things for life," as it advertises, it also makes plenty of 
things that make news -- corporate mergers, weapons and nuclear power, to name 
three. 
</P>
<P>
Since the acquisition, however, even critics have had trouble finding evidence 
that GE has influenced or corrupted NBC News' coverage. 
</P>
<P>
In the newsletter this month of the liberal group Fairness and Accuracy in 
Reporting, Doug Henwood writes that: "It's hard to trace a change in NBC news 
coverage since GE took over." 
</P>
<P>
Nor have critics found evidence of overt influence at other news organizations 
bought by new corporate parents. 
</P>
<P>
Media watcher Michael Robinson of Georgetown University said some wondered 
whether CBS coverage of the Middle East might be affected when the network was 
acquired by Laurence Tisch, a staunch supporter of Israel. But "nobody has been 
tougher than CBS correspondent Bob Simon on the Israelis," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Many journalists argue that while active and blatant corporate influence of 
news was typical in the days of publishing barons, today it would be suicidal. 
</P>
<P>
"If Jesse Helms had taken over CBS and given a deliberately ideological slant 
to its news coverage he would have destroyed the network," said McManus of 
Time. "Pretty soon nobody would be watching." (He was referring to the North 
Carolina Republican senator's brief leadership of a movement to buy CBS News.) 
</P>
<P>
Too many critics are poised to criticize major press outlets that show active 
bias, Robinson agreed. 
</P>
<P>
But critics say hogwash. Sure, journalism is getting more self- analytical -- 
with more press critics and more recognition of the media as a political and 
social phenomenon, all helping to keep journalists more honest. But, they say, 
for evidence that ownership makes a difference, just see the bland, lifeless 
way in which most news organizations cover themselves -- even down to the dull 
and innocuous accounts of annual meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"I have yet to find any news organization that can honestly report on itself in 
the same way that it reports on others," said Dean Rotbart, editor of a 
newsletter on business journalism called The Journalist and Financial 
Reporting. "To that end it seems clear that as news organizations are 
conglomeratized they will indeed not be able to report in the same way." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Avoiding Problems 
</P>
<P>
It may not be that this bland self-reporting reflects any active corporate 
influence. Rather it could be that journalists are trying to avoid problems -- 
covering your bosses is a no-win assignment, so keep it safe, keep it bland. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Times, for instance, assigns business reporters to cover the 
activities of its parent company, Times Mirror, as it would with other 
companies. But these stories routinely receive more scrutiny from high-level 
editors than similar stories, which, reporters say, tends to make them more of 
a hassle than a pleasure to produce. 
</P>
<P>
"With all the subjective judgments that have to be made . . . covering news is 
complicated enough," said Squires of the Chicago Tribune. "Those judgments are 
very, very difficult when the guy who might be trying to mislead you is your 
boss," or the story can "affect . . . your pension plan." 
</P>
<P>
But if journalists censor themselves to blandness in covering their own 
companies, critics see the sins of omission intensifying with corporate 
consolidation. Asks Martin Lee of Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting: What are 
the stories that journalists at NBC or other news organizations might not be 
doing because of the presumption that it would anger their corporate bosses? 
</P>
<P>
Editors say they lead by example, trying to send signals to reporters below to 
be independent. But they concede that it is difficult to know if those messages 
are received. 
</P>
<P>
And if their own reporters doubt them, what is corporate concentration doing to 
public perception of press credibility? 
</P>
<P>
"There is a presumption that you are pulling your punches," acknowledged Bill 
Wheatley, who deals with questions of corporate influence as the executive 
producer of "NBC Nightly News." 
</P>
<P>
And for journalists, the appearance or presumption of a conflict of interest 
can be damaging in itself -- even if no real conflict is involved. 
</P>
<P>
That is apparently the problem TV Guide has faced since it was bought last 
November by Murdoch, who is engaged in building the Fox TV network. 
</P>
<P>
No one has yet proven a bias in TV Guide. But Murdoch's rivals are poised to 
presume it. 
</P>
<P>
"They are regularly apoplectic," said Merrill Brown, editor-in-chief of 
Channels magazine. 
</P>
<P>
When TV Guide did a story entitled, "Has Geraldo (Rivera) Gone Too Far?" said 
Brown, people at Paramount and Tribune Co., which produces the "Geraldo" show, 
wanted to know why TV Guide had not asked the same of Maury Povich, host of 
"Inside Edition," a Murdoch-owned tabloid TV news show that has been likened in 
taste to Geraldo Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Editor Replies 
</P>
<P>
"In fact," answers TV Guide Editor David Sendler, "we have a major cover story 
coming up raising questions about whether (Fox's) 'Married With Children' has 
gone too far." 
</P>
<P>
Still, there is another issue potentially more pervasive than corporate 
meddling or even the potential of lost credibility. 
</P>
<P>
One of the primary side effects of many of these media mergers is that 
journalism is becoming a smaller component of media company's profits, and 
perhaps in the personnel history of the people running the company. 
</P>
<P>
Such a change can influence journalistic decisions in a way more direct 
attempts to corporate meddling never would. 
</P>
<P>
As companies become larger and their top executives more distant from 
journalism, says former NBC newsman Marvin Kalb, the likelihood grows that 
"news becomes a commodity," depended upon like any other product to above all 
produce profits. 
</P>
<P>
According to Kalb, now head of Harvard's Barone Center on the Press, Politics 
and Public Policy, senior executives at General Electric have raised the 
possibility of NBC News producing tabloid programs such as Geraldo Rivera's 
because they make money, even though many in the press do not consider Rivera's 
program journalism. 
</P>
<P>
GE management also reportedly asked NBC's "Today Show" to consider charging 
authors a fee for being interviewed about their books, though for now the idea 
has been tabled. 
</P>
<P>
And Robert Wright, whom GE installed as network president, even went so far as 
to urge network employees, including those in the news department, to 
contribute to GE's political action committee, which is used to lobby Congress. 
An outcry by news employees helped scuttle the idea. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Change Institutions 
</P>
<P>
Many journalists worry that, over time, such differences will change the 
journalistic institutions, influencing who gets promoted and which news values 
are rewarded, forcing more pressure on profits and increasing the chances of 
self- censorship. 
</P>
<P>
And what happens when an issue arises -- such as a merger or a major expose -- 
that could threaten the future of the company? Will the corporation be willing 
to allow the news division to report freely? 
</P>
<P>
"Would General Electric let NBC News be GE's undoing?" said Rotbart. "I don't 
think any good businessman would say yes to that." 
</P>
<P>
Rotbart was part of the team at the Wall Street Journal that covered the 
insider trading case involving reporter R. Foster Winans, who tipped traders to 
items in a Journal column that could affect stock prices. Although the paper 
was given credit for reporting the matter aggressively, Rotbart said: "It was 
clear to me that during that crisis there was absolutely no separation between 
news and corporate. The company's lawyers and executives were sort of informed 
what the reporters were learning as we were learning it." 
</P>
<P>
Journal publisher Peter R. Kann declined to be interviewed for this article. 
</P>
<P>
Some Time employees worry that a similar mixing of business and journalism 
could be occurring at Time Inc. With its move into cable television through 
HBO, magazine journalism already contributes only a minority share of Time's 
profits. Now, the future of the corporation, and the careers of top management, 
are at stake. 
</P>
<P>
Among journalists, questions arose from the start. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Time announced its original merger plan on a Saturday, in time to 
make Time's weekly edition. But McManus told his editors not to cover the 
story. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the analysts and the usual Wall Street suspects were going to look 
very favorably (on the deal) at first blush," McManus explained, so any story 
Time did that quickly would leave it "open to the charge that we were in the 
service of a public relations campaign." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Staff Mystified 
</P>
<P>
Even some of McManus' own staff privately say they find the explanation 
mystifying. And now McManus admits the decision may have been a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
But the next week, according to insiders, McManus again pushed not to cover the 
story. In a meeting with corporate executives on the 34th floor, John Stacks, 
chief of correspondents, vehemently disagreed, arguing that missing the story a 
second time would be ruinous. 
</P>
<P>
Stacks prevailed and was lionized by the staff. But nonetheless anger began to 
build in the staff that Stacks had to fight at all to cover the news. 
</P>
<P>
And when Time finally did cover the story, it raised other questions. 
</P>
<P>
When Time wrote about its counteroffer to Paramount, its lead paragraph 
concluded by quoting Warner Chairman Steven Ross saying: "There could not be a 
better fit in the world" than Time and Warner. Wall Street analysts were hardly 
so certain. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Time stock dropped a whopping 17 1/2 points in reaction to the 
counteroffer. But Time described that by saying: "Wall Street investors took a 
cautious first look." 
</P>
<P>
Then there was what was not printed. An early draft of Time's story about the 
first Time-Warner deal, for instance, included information that Time's outside 
directors initially had argued against the plan. That seemed to contradict 
Time's public stance that Time's board was unanimous in its support. But 
editors deleted this from the story that was published. 
</P>
<P>
Chief of correspondents Stacks, who made the decision, said he thought the 
sources for that information might be misinformed. What's more, the board 
eventually did approve the plan unanimously, so if there was dissent it had 
vanished. "The whole thing," said Stacks, "was very shaky." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Imagined Conspiracy 
</P>
<P>
But he admitted some reporters imagined some kind of conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
At bottom, said Managing Editor Henry Muller: "The most important thing to 
understand about these stories is that they were produced as all stories at 
Time are," from the reporting staff, not dictated from the executive suite. 
</P>
<P>
By that standard, Time's coverage is far more square and balanced than it was 
in the day of Time Founder Henry Luce, who was known to use the magazine to 
further his personal world view. 
</P>
<P>
But Time's reputation may never be quite the same. Its own reporters may look 
on the magazine differently. And so, depending on the eventual winners, may its 
new owners.

<P>
In an effort to reduce the risk of error by dazed and exhausted 
doctors-in-training, New York over the weekend became the first state to limit 
the grueling work hours of interns and residents. 
</P>
<P>
New York, which trains 16% of the nation's doctors, is leading a national 
movement away from the century-old tradition of 36-hour shifts and 100-hour 
workweeks for postgraduate trainees in medicine. The Health Department now 
limits shifts to 24 hours and the workweek to 80 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Several hospitals in the city had already implemented the 24-hour rules, and a 
medical council is preparing guidelines that will be enforceable nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Astonishing Change' 
</P>
<P>
Long hours have been "a rite of passage for years and years," said Dr. Joseph 
Sachter, chief emergency room resident at Metropolitan Hospital in New York 
City. "But there's been an astonishing change in two years." 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the tradition say shunning sleep toughens young doctors to the 
rigors of medicine and lets them study the progression of a patient's illness. 
Critics say bleary-eyed residents endanger patients -- and can even kill them.

FRIENDSHIP FLIGHT: TONY CIRCLES THE GLOBE; 
</P>
<P>
BOY MAY BE AT THE CONTROLS, PILOTS SAY, BUT HE'S GOT HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BEENE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although the round-the-world flight of 11-year-old Tony Aliengena may appear to 
be the stuff of high adventure, aviation experts see it more as an affirmation 
of the advanced state of modern aviation than the marvel of a boy wonder. 
</P>
<P>
"Any 10-year-old could do this without any training whatsoever," said Philip 
Lesch, 30, a flight instructor at Martin Aviation at Orange County's John Wayne 
Airport. "This is a great experience for Tony, but he's really not flying that 
plane." 
</P>
<P>
Tony, a San Juan Capistrano fourth-grader, is now flying across Soviet Asia in 
his quest to become, according to the Guinness Book of World Records, the 
youngest person to circumnavigate the globe by air. 
</P>
<P>
The trip, dubbed Friendship Flight, began June 5 in Orange County and is to 
cover about 17,000 miles. A highlight came in Moscow last week when Tony 
presented Soviet officials with a friendship scroll signed by thousands of U.S. 
schoolchildren. On Sunday, Tony was passing over the Ural Mountains from 
Kuibyshev to Tumen, 700 miles into Siberia. 
</P>
<P>
The man who conceived of the trip, Tony's father, Gary Aliengena, is a licensed 
pilot. When they are airborne in their Cessna Centurion 210, Aliengena sits at 
Tony's side at all times, giving the boy the benefit of his years of flying 
experience, much as he did last year when Tony became the youngest person to 
fly across the United States. Aliengena also performs the bulk of the other 
duties required for such an inter-continental air trip. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Official Observer 
</P>
<P>
Also on board is Gunter Hagen, 58, a retired physicist from Malibu who is 
serving as an official observer for the National Aeronautic Assn., the U.S. 
body that sanctions all claims for world and national aviation records. It is 
up to Hagen to verify that Tony remains at the controls of the craft throughout 
the trip. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a chase plane carrying reporters and a film crew is tailing the 
Cessna. The pilot of the chase plane remains in constant radio contact with 
Gary Aliengena, swapping information on weather conditions and navigation to 
make sure Tony remains on course. 
</P>
<P>
While taking nothing away from the enthusiasm for what the boy is doing, Lesch 
and other pilots stressed that it is Tony's father who is bearing the real 
headaches and logistical details that come with piloting a small plane around 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
It is the father, they say, who is charged with charting the route, checking 
weather conditions and talking with air traffic controllers, and who gives the 
boy expert advice on handling the plane in difficult conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see Tony as the pilot," Lesch said, echoing the view of other pilots 
interviewed. "It's his father who talks to the controller, his father who makes 
all the flight plans. I see Tony there with his hands on the controls, that's 
all. It's like having a credit card and not being responsible for the charges." 
</P>
<P>
The key to flying a plane, Lesch said, "is not the ability to manipulate the 
controls but being able to accept responsibility and everything associated with 
the airplane. Who is watching the weather and reading the maps? Who is talking 
to the controllers and doing the weight and balance of the aircraft? Not Tony." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Lesch said, he too is "touched how this thing has affected 
some people, especially Tony's friends. They are living the excitement of this 
flight vicariously. It's really great for the kids." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Aliengena said in a recent interview that he saw nothing wrong with Tony's 
not being involved in every aspect of the flight. Aliengena compared his role 
to that of a commercial airline co-pilot whose jobs is to prepare the flight 
for the pilot. 
</P>
<P>
Aliengena emphasized that in the Cessna's cockpit, it is Tony who makes all the 
critical decisions, such as whether to descend or ascend in bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
Several times during the trip, Tony has described the flying itself as 
"boring," and upon landing he has usually rushed off to eat something or watch 
cartoons while his father sets about the business of preparing the plane for 
the next day's journey. 
</P>
<P>
According to local pilots, it is this expertise and backup that is making the 
trip possible. The boy is taking but a minor role in guiding the craft through 
the skies, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Parsons, owner of Avantair, a charter service operating out of John Wayne 
Airport, compared Tony's role in the flight to that of "a kid who does real 
well in a piano recital. But that doesn't mean he can go to a symphony and sit 
down and pick up a piece of music and sight-read it. He just can't do it 
without some help." 
</P>
<P>
"It would take one hell of a guy to do that sort of thing by himself," Parsons 
said. "But here he is with people chasing him, with support equipment and a 
person riding in there on the right side. He isn't really piloting that plane." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a nice trip for the boy and I think it is great for him, but what he is 
doing is not a difficult chore," said Gregory Wilcox, a charter pilot for 
Martin Aviation at John Wayne Airport who, like Tony, began flying with his 
father when he was just 4 years old. "My kid, or anybody's kid, could do that." 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing inherently dangerous about flying an airplane anywhere, 
anytime," he added. "In many ways, it is easier than driving a car. In this 
case, Tony is just holding the wheel while somebody else does all the work. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not Indiana Jones," he added. "It is not dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Tony's journey is not without peril, however. Pilots who have been following 
the flight note that the Cessna 210, although it is a high-performance small 
aircraft, has a limited altitude and distance range, and in colder weather is 
prone to ice buildup on the wings. In Tony's case, this was avoided on the 
North Atlantic crossing, for instance, with pre-flight planning to avoid storms 
and icy conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The pilots also note that while the general public may see a Cessna's crossing 
vast expanses of Siberia as hazardous, given the relative lack of 
sophistication of Soviet aviation, the journey will be made somewhat easier by 
the multitude of sophisticated and redundant navigational systems on the plane. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Tony will not be able to obtain his pilot's license until he is 17, 
and on this around-the-world flight, his father is listed as the pilot of 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike those for driving, aviation regulations do not list a minimum age for a 
person to be allowed to begin flying. The only requirement is that a licensed 
pilot be at the controls. Although it is not a common practice, aviation 
sources said many licensed pilots introduce their children to flying at an 
early age, tutoring them on the intricacies of flying and allowing them to hold 
the controls. Tony himself was introduced to flying at the age of 4, sitting on 
his father's lap as they traveled through the air. 
</P>
<P>
To set his record as the youngest person to fly around the globe, Tony must 
perform all takeoffs and landings (although his father will be at his side to 
intervene in an emergency). 
</P>
<P>
Flight instructors generally commend Tony's ability in that regard, but they 
note that most flying students master landings and takeoffs in the first five 
hours of lessons. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the flight has caught the imagination of many people, among them 
corporate pilot Joe McElroy, who flies for a small Orange County computer 
company. 
</P>
<P>
"I flew airport transports across the Atlantic in World War II, and I can tell 
you it can get hairy out there," said McElroy, 52, a Fountain Valley resident. 
But, he added, "Tony doesn't need to know everything you need to know because 
of his father. Tony is just doing the driving." 
</P>
<P>
To Vi Smith, author of "From Jennies to Jets, the Aviation History of Orange 
County," the journey has been something "that I have followed every day. It 
takes me back to the days of Lindbergh, it's just so exciting. Everyone is 
wishing the boy well."

LEADERS TAKE STEPS TOWARD MORE UNITY FOR COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
How can Orange County effectively build a major road running through several 
cities when at each border the project is completely re-evaluated by a 
different set of planners and politicians? 
</P>
<P>
And how can Orange County's mayors and supervisors prevent state and federal 
officials from deciding what developments should or should not be built, all in 
the name of air quality? 
</P>
<P>
And what about such issues as fireworks, which have been banned by most 
municipalities in Orange County even though the effect is significantly 
compromised because several cities still allow sales? 
</P>
<P>
These are some of the mega-issues shared by every local government in Orange 
County -- all 28 cities, their more than 200 elected officials and the five 
county supervisors. Orange County is a patchwork of municipal fiefdoms, but 
many of its problems saturate the area without regard to municipal borders. 
</P>
<P>
To address these issues, city and county leaders are talking, in a surprisingly 
quiet way, about an unprecedented move that could rewrite the political science 
books on local government and represent a historic step toward Orange County's 
future. 
</P>
<P>
The officials have tentatively agreed to create a new organization -- called 
the Orange County Assn. of Governments -- that would bridge jurisdictions 
inside the county and present a stronger, more united Orange County voice when 
dealing with Sacramento and Washington. The idea has a two-fold purpose, one 
internal and one external. 
</P>
<P>
The association -- which would be led by a board of 10 mayors and the five 
supervisors -- has already been approved by the county's League of Cities. The 
supervisors endorsed the idea last week. The bills that would create the 
association, now pending in the Legislature, were authored by state Sen. Marian 
Bergeson, R-Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"More and more we are recognizing that Orange County is a very influential and 
political power in the state, and we have a need to do good planning that . . . 
doesn't treat Orange County as a suburb of Los Angeles," said Ronald Bates, a 
vice president of the Orange County League of Cities and a councilman in Los 
Alamitos. "The real benefit . . . is the potential for coordinated countywide 
planning." 
</P>
<P>
Norm Grossman, a slow-growth leader and co-author of the county's growth 
management plan, said: "In my mind, it's a kind of new form of government, and 
it is an experiment. I think it's clear that the area is developing quickly and 
it is too large to worry about city by city." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Solve Biggest Problems 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the county, politicians and planners have seen how the Assn. of 
Governments could help solve some of their biggest problems. But the idea is 
clearly still in an embryonic stage, and some elected officials worry that they 
may be creating a political Frankenstein. 
</P>
<P>
The most sensitive question is whether individual cities or the county might 
lose some sovereignty to the new body. And at the county level, there are 
concerns that someday this organization could even replace the county 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley said at a recent meeting -- only 
half in jest -- "This is an emotional decision because we might be voting 
ourselves out of a job." Later, he said he had overstated his true opinion. 
</P>
<P>
But Grossman said, "I don't think there's any question it would" replace the 
county government. "The Board of Supervisors will be out of the land-use 
business in 10 years. With the (association) taking over transportation, that 
doesn't leave the board with much to do. I think the supervisors have good 
reason to be concerned." 
</P>
<P>
With the supervisors in a minority on the board of directors, for example, 
would the association be able to overrule a county government decision? Or 
could it even influence a supervisors vote by applying political pressure? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Giving Some Concern 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's what's giving some of us concern," said Supervisor Roger R. 
Stanton, who voted for the concept last week. "I'm not sure what the final form 
should be, but I'm pretty convinced we need something that represents our 
region." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was concerned about the association's powers, Supervisor Don R. 
Roth, who voted for the idea last week, said: "Sure I'm concerned about it. I 
think we are trying to improve the efficiency, but we don't want to throw the 
baby out with the bathwater." 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the idea have emphasized that the organization will not have any 
statutory powers that could usurp the authority of a city or county government. 
They describe it as a forum for countywide discussions on important issues and 
an organization that could provide research, statistical information and 
planning for the county. 
</P>
<P>
It could issue recommendations about how regional problems should be solved, 
they say, which local governments could then use as a reference in making their 
own decisions. The association could also play a key role in dealing with 
several districts, agencies and regional authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The whole idea began with a move by the county to combine the Orange County 
Transit District -- which operates county buses -- and the Orange County 
Transportation Commission -- which plans new roads and mass transit solutions 
to traffic problems. The combination, it seemed, would make a more streamlined 
and effective agency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
County Involved in Feud 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the county has been in a feud with the Southern California 
Assn. of Governments -- a regional agency that covers a six-county area -- over 
its inattention to Orange County and its allegedly inaccurate statistical 
information about the area. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson has also introduced a bill that would allow Orange County to gather 
its own demographic research that would then be turned over to SCAG for 
inclusion in a regional plan. The proposal for an Orange County Assn. of 
Governments was born when the transportation merger and the SCAG proposal were 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
Under Bergeson's legislation, the Orange County Transportation Commission would 
be abolished and a subcommittee of the Assn. of Governments would operate the 
OCTD bus system. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the legislation says the new Assn. of Governments "would assist 
the cities and the county of Orange in addressing urban problems of a 
multi-jurisdictional nature such as -- but not limited to -- transportation, 
air quality, water, housing, waste management and growth management." 
</P>
<P>
Another significant role for the new association could be in distributing 
special tax money. 
</P>
<P>
The county transportation commission is planning to ask voters for a half-cent 
sales tax to pay for more than $3 billion in road and highway improvements 
throughout the county over the next 20 years. If the measure is approved, the 
new association might be the organization to distribute the money to local 
governments throughout the county. Officials are discussing the possibility of 
using local agencies to distribute gas tax money, a duty that the association 
could perform. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents said the association is not intended to have the power to coerce 
through any powers to distribute taxes. But, realistically, Grossman said, "if 
a city wants to go it alone, it can pay for it alone. The reality is, though, 
that it won't be able to." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lever Against Interference 
</P>
<P>
Tony Carstens, associate county administrative officer for monitoring and 
forecasting services, said, however, that the most important use of the 
government association would not be a force against Orange County cities, but 
as a lever against interference from outside governments. 
</P>
<P>
Carstens said that under the proposed Air Quality Management Plan, for example, 
it is possible that state or federal officials could come into Orange County 
and prevent commercial or residential developments that they consider a threat 
to regional air quality. 
</P>
<P>
Carstens said an organization of Orange County governments could adopt a 
countywide development plan that would satisfy the air quality concerns, 
keeping the decision-making closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody wants to have minimal authority, but what authority there 
is, they want to keep it here, close to home," Carstens said. "If authority is 
at risk now of being lost to the state, the (association) could head that off."

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: IRVINE; 
</P>
<P>
FAULTY METER TRIGGERS RELEASE OF AMMONIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A faulty meter triggered a small leak of moderately toxic ammonia Sunday at 
Diceon Electronics Inc., but Orange County fire officials reported no 
evacuations or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Diceon, a major manufacturer of computer circuit boards, was cited June 26 by 
the Environmental Protection Agency for failing to report the nature and amount 
of its toxic emissions -- requirements of federal law. 
</P>
<P>
Joe McHugh, a director of the Irvine-based firm, said a meter that monitors 
part of a chemical waste system malfunctioned sometime after 2 a.m., when the 
last of the plant's 92 employees left. 
</P>
<P>
When the meter detects certain changes in the composition of the chemicals, it 
triggers the discharge of anhydrous ammonia to restore the system's balance, 
McHugh said. 
</P>
<P>
County fire officials said the broken meter was connected to a 500-gallon 
anhydrous ammonia tank, but they could not say how much of the gaseous chemical 
had leaked. 
</P>
<P>
McHugh estimated that "something less than half our tank" was discharged. 
</P>
<P>
A plant official noticed the odor of ammonia about 6 a.m. and notified the 
County Fire Department, which dispatched a hazardous materials team to the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve firefighters, one engine and one fire truck also were sent to Diceon's 
plant in the 16800 block of Hale Avenue -- an industrial park near Barranca 
Parkway and Jamboree Road.

PEOPLE: HOW DOES GROW GARDEN? WELL ENOUGH FOR A GARDENER OF THE YEAR AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Herbert J. Vida 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
That someone with a name like Beautrice Grow would be named Gardener of the 
Year by the Orange District of the California Garden Clubs might seem like too 
much of a coincidence, but her last name had little to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
"People say I must have deliberately changed my name because of my gardening 
interest," Grow said, but "actually, it was a matter of love." 
</P>
<P>
Her husband of 45 years is named Lowell Grow. 
</P>
<P>
And her love for gardening has been as much a constant in her life as her love 
for the former Marine Corps fighter pilot who retired as a colonel. 
</P>
<P>
"We moved around a lot, but I always seemed to have a garden wherever I lived," 
said Grow, who has been living in San Clemente for two years now and is an 
active member of the San Clemente Garden Club. "When I only had a balcony, I 
would put out pots of plants." 
</P>
<P>
Gardening, she said, is a labor of love that is "not really work for me. It 
keeps me healthy physically and mentally, and it's also good therapy." 
</P>
<P>
Her interest in gardening is such that even though she no longer lives in 
Tustin, she is still a member of Tustin Garden Club. 
</P>
<P>
After the couple moved to San Clemente, Grow went right to work planting 
vegetables, perennials, flowers, herbs and six fruit trees. 
</P>
<P>
"Trees have a dual purpose," she said. "You can get something from them and at 
the same time you can admire their great beauty. I just can't imagine not 
having space for trees." 
</P>
<P>
And like any good gardener, she gets plenty of friendly visitors. "I enjoy 
seeing the birds coming into the yard, and wild rabbits stop and listen when I 
chat with them," she said. "They're not afraid of me anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Grow came by her knowledge about flora and fauna growing up in a wooded area in 
Tennessee. "My white-bearded gentle old grandfather would take me for walks 
into wooded areas, and he would identify trees and bushes and plants," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It was her mother, however, who taught her how to garden and plant. "My mother 
had a terrific interest in gardening, and it became part of my life," Grow 
said, adding that one of her chores as a child was to bring in water for the 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I've always enjoyed working with the soil and seeing things grow, 
especially when I grow them from seed," she continued. "It's more exciting to 
see them emerge from seeds rather than using established plants." 
</P>
<P>
Of her award, Grow said, "I didn't expect to win anything, but it's nice to 
have your work recognized." More than anything, she said, she loves to share 
what she had grown, often giving cuttings from her plants to friends. "To show 
and share my plants is one of the pleasures of my life." 
</P>
<P>
In her wildest flights of fancy, Evelyn Hutchings, 60, a retired high school 
English teacher who lives at Leisure World, never saw herself competing in a 
synchronized swimming meet in Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
But she and Barbara Pedersen, 62, another Leisure World resident who is a 
former competitive ice skater, will perform together July 25 in the 
synchronized swimming competition of World Masters Games in Aarhus, Denmark. 
The games are competitions for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll do our very best," Hutchings vowed. "But if we come in dead last, the 
fact we'll be there is what's important." The women have competed four times so 
far in regional meets, taking three first-places and one second. 
</P>
<P>
"I never competed in anything before I started synchronized swimming," said 
Hutchings, who described her previous athletic pursuit as "competitive couch 
potato" before she joined a women's swimming club at Leisure World about four 
years ago. Members of the club, called the Aquadettes, range from 55 to 87 
years old. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the women in their 70s are our best swimmers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledgments -- Sonia Steiner of Fountain Valley, a senior at Mater Dei High 
School, will be visiting the Soviet Union, Finland, Sweden, Denmark and England 
this summer as a student ambassador in the People to People Ambassador program. 
Students chosen for the program are selected on the basis of academic 
achievement, community involvement and recommendations from teachers and 
counselors.

AWESOME FIRE HARDLY FAZED COOL CAMPERS

<P>
Half a dozen residents of Ortega Oaks campground drank beer and joked Wednesday 
afternoon while watching in the distance as a major brush fire swept through 
Cleveland National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
The group gathered in the parking lot of a next-door landmark called the Candy 
Store, a mom-and-pop food market, joking and laughing -- even as a mushroom 
cloud of brown smoke in the distance got bigger and winds began shifting and 
picking up speed. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters were staked out around the Candy Store and the nearby campground, 
ready to battle flames that might threaten the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the campers did not seem worried that the fire, which had been raging 
since the previous afternoon and at one point had come within a quarter-mile of 
their trailers, could destroy their possessions. 
</P>
<P>
"I want a new trailer anyway," joked Mike Davidson, 40. "I've paid enough in 
insurance." 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Diane, was equally at ease about the blaze. "At least there won't be 
any more snakes around here. They'll be charred to a crisp." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
12-Foot Flames Jumping Highway 
</P>
<P>
For myself, the Ortega fire was like nothing I had ever seen. Although I had 
seen grass fires and small brush fires in my hometown of Minneapolis, I had no 
idea how unpredictable flames can be in such steep, brush-covered terrain. 
</P>
<P>
I had never seen the towering flames, blackened skies and funnel-like winds of 
a major brush fire. Nor had I seen how winds can suddenly change direction and 
gather force that fuels a fire. 
</P>
<P>
Just minutes before, I had tried to get to El Cariso, a small village about 
four miles northeast of the Candy Store, which is just across the Orange County 
line in Riverside County. About half a mile up the road, I drove around a bend 
and spotted 12-foot flames jumping Ortega Highway and heading in my direction. 
I turned back. 
</P>
<P>
I sped to the Candy Store. There, the owners had lost telephone communication 
and had given the last of their water to firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, James Foster, 51, owner of the campground and the store, 
had been confident that his property would be spared. By afternoon, as the fire 
once again headed his way, he looked a little uneasy. 
</P>
<P>
He pointed southeast to a hill where flames licked at a TV antenna that marked 
his property line. He took another look, grabbed a six-pack of beer from his 
store and retreated to his home nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Campers Andy Mullin, 26, and Melissa Harris, 20, both of North Carolina, had 
stayed the night at the Ortega Oaks. For them, staying put at the campground 
and nearby Candy Store was the safest thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just been standing around, watching the fire burn," Mullin said. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, who is expecting a baby in late July, was also at ease. "The 
firefighters told us that we should stay," she said, as another cloud of smoke 
rose about four miles southwest on Ortega Highway, making travel anywhere 
questionable. 
</P>
<P>
"It's safer here than if we were to leave," she said. "We have the firefighters 
around." 
</P>
<P>
About 30 minutes later, as flames threatened to crest the nearby hill, an 
Orange County firefighter persuaded me to go with him to El Cariso. It was his 
day off, and he was missing all the action, he grumbled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'These Are the Best' 
</P>
<P>
"For firefighters, they mainly spend their time battling structural fires," he 
said. "Those only last a few hours. These last a few days. These are the best 
you can have." 
</P>
<P>
So I drove with him back up the winding, two-lane highway. "You really 
shouldn't worry," he reassured me. "We'll be protected in a car." 
</P>
<P>
Two miles up the road, in an area where earlier that morning air tankers had 
dropped water and fire retardant chemicals on a small island of bushes and 
grassland, even the boulders were charred. 
</P>
<P>
At El Cariso, the sky was dark from the black smoke. In the smoky clouds, I 
could see the yellow reflection of the fire. The main front of the blaze was 
moving northeast to a slope that dropped down to the Lake Elsinore area. We 
decided to head for that cloud of smoke. 
</P>
<P>
We made it to the Lookout Restaurant, the first building on the descent down 
Ortega Highway toward Lake Elsinore. The restaurant, which was closed, was 
surrounded by firefighters bracing themselves. The smoke cloud, which by now 
was swirling like a tornado, made the late afternoon skies over Lake Elsinore 
look as if night had fallen. 
</P>
<P>
While filing a report at a pay telephone outside the restaurant, I noticed that 
not only had parts of the smoke cloud turned yellow and red with flames, but a 
two-story wave of fire was creeping down the slope toward us. It was time to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
The highway to Lake Elsinore had become impassable, so we headed back to Ortega 
Oaks campground. After seeing just how quickly the eastern edge of the fire had 
moved, I wondered whether the Candy Store was still there. 
</P>
<P>
It was. So were the half-dozen people, sipping their beers and watching the 
action.

POSTSCRIPT: PLANNER LOOKS AHEAD AFTER WATCHING IRVINE GROW UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ray Catalano came to the new town of Irvine from Syracuse 17 years ago to see 
if Irvine and Orange County could meet the "social, political and physical 
expectations of the new residents." 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, Catalano says, Irvine and Orange County have done just that. 
</P>
<P>
For despite worsening traffic congestion and air pollution, pell-mell 
development, and housing costs beyond earth orbit, the 44-year-old urban 
planner and slow-growth activist says Orange County's "can do" attitude 
probably will not allow the gloomy scenario of post-industrial decay painted 
for the future of Los Angeles in science-fiction films to occur here. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County will remain one of the most desirable places to live in the 
world, relative to most other places," Catalano says of the next 20 to 30 
years. "But there will be nostalgia for the way it was here in the 1980s. It's 
been a great decade, economically and socially." 
</P>
<P>
Trained as an urban planner in the 1960s, Catalano was 26 when he came here in 
1972. UC Irvine had hired him to teach and research a new subject -- social 
ecology. He helped launch a project to study the effects of the region's 
economic and social performance on health care needs. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike sociologist Herbert Gans, who moved to a new Long Island suburb and 
in 1967 published "The Levittowners," a landmark book about the granddaddy of 
planned communities, Catalano helped shape Irvine and the surrounding area 
directly, first as a city planning commissioner and later as an appointed city 
councilman who wielded the swing vote on most issues from October, 1985, to 
June, 1988. In March, 1988, Catalano said he would not seek election to another 
term because he did not want to ask people for campaign money and "in the same 
breath tell them not to expect any favors in exchange." 
</P>
<P>
Now he is moving on to a new research post at UC Berkeley. But looking back 
over nearly two decades, Catalano says Irvine was the best place he could have 
chosen to pursue his career. 
</P>
<P>
"The opportunity to come to the major new town in America was too much to 
resist," he says. "When I got here, I was interested in the place as a 
laboratory, but it didn't take long to be seduced into being involved in the 
place as a citizen." 
</P>
<P>
Catalano adds: "My research had always been on the social and health effects of 
change in a dynamic, growing economy. Here, they were going to build this new 
town (and try) to help mitigate or make all of this change reasonable, in fact, 
to stimulate the change itself and give people a hand . . . by taking as much 
of the pain and confusion out of the kind of growth that other places had 
undergone." 
</P>
<P>
In the early years, says Catalano, architects ruled Irvine on the theory that 
"nice environments make nice people." 
</P>
<P>
"We discovered that wasn't true," Catalano recalls. "The remarkable thing was 
the speed with which that insight led to doing other things." Irvine is now the 
most progressive city in the United States, Catalano believes, thanks to 
policies that promote creation of day-care facilities, affordable housing, 
assistance to the homeless, and human rights. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Catalano's other observations: 
</P>
<P>
* "Let's face it. Orange County in 1972 was reputed to be a fairly rigid, 
conservative and ideologically bound place. . . . But I think that these were 
more pragmatic people than I thought. For example, they didn't create a 
metropolitan area in which you had an old, geographically bound central city 
that was decaying and isolated physically and socially from a lot of well-to-do 
suburbs that couldn't give a damn." 
</P>
<P>
"It's beyond me as to why the typical, influential Orange County voter -- who I 
think of as being a moderate, management-oriented Republican -- doesn't 
understand that they own the road system. . . . If any private corporation 
struck a deal with a developer for a road to carry 100,000 cars a day and then 
they put 200,000 cars a day on it, destroying the investment, pretty fast 
they'd be in court for breach of contract. Yet that's exactly what's happening 
to the public's infrastructure." 
</P>
<P>
* "Right now the decision is being made, implicitly if not explicitly, that the 
folks who are going to be here are those who can afford the 
three-quarters-of-a-million-dollar house . . . and the people whose work styles 
and life styles are such that they can afford to spend an infinite amount of 
time on the freeways." 
</P>
<P>
* Proposals for a new regional government with city and county representatives 
won't work because "anybody could get a bloc of votes and do a number on us. . 
. . They should form something smaller with adjacent cities that have similar 
problems and let them allocate the number of (traffic) trips each day that 
their road system can handle." 
</P>
<P>
Catalano says his toughest decision as a city councilman was to cast the 
deciding vote for building the Yale Avenue overpass on the San Diego Freeway, 
over the objections of 1,500 neighborhood residents. The next city council 
reversed that decision. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving UC Irvine also is a tough decision, he adds, because "everything you do 
here is ground breaking, risk taking. . . . UC Irvine has accelerated the 
maturation of Orange County considerably -- economically as well as 
culturally." 
</P>
<P>
But Catalano isn't out the door yet. He says he will commute between UC 
Berkeley and Orange County as long as necessary because he has not persuaded 
his wife, June, that it is also in her professional interests to move. June 
Catalano is Santa Ana's director of community development. The couple has a 
3-year-old daughter, Elizabeth. 
</P>
<P>
There's another reason to commute as well: Catalano has a major research 
project under way here about how Orange County's economic performance has 
affected the demand for physical and mental health services. 
</P>
<P>
The research project is similar to one that first brought him to UC Irvine 17 
years ago.

TONY'S PLANE FEATURES SOME OF LATEST GADGETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The navigational equipment packed into the cockpit of the Cessna Centurion 210 
that Tony Aliengena is flying around the world represents some of the latest in 
U.S. technology. With its help, 11-year-old Tony should be able to circle the 
globe with little trouble. 
</P>
<P>
There is the standard Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) system, 
which helps direct the plane to its course using ground radio transmitters. The 
VOR system, together with the plane's gryrodirectional compass and the backup 
magnetic compass mounted over the control panel, makes possible a determination 
of where the plane is and where it is heading even when visibility is poor. 
</P>
<P>
The plane is also equipped with what is known as a LORAN system, which can help 
in determining the latitude, longitude, distance and flight time to the next 
point. From virtually anywhere in the world, a pilot can tap into LORAN to find 
out latitude and longitude and to receive precise instructions about the 
direction to take by specifying the coordinates of the destination. 
</P>
<P>
Should the gyro-directional compass, backup compass, VOR and LORAN systems 
fail, air traffic controllers can be called on to help keep the plane on 
course. A Soviet navigator is accompanying Tony and his father during the long 
crossing over Siberia in case they encounter controllers who do not speak 
English. The Soviet is also providing them with a familiar eye for the terrain. 
</P>
<P>
All of these navigational systems will function outside the United States, 
albeit with varying degrees of efficiency, U.S. pilots say. 
</P>
<P>
"But you still start off, before you ever leave, with filing a flight plan and 
knowing exactly where you're going," notes Gregory Wilcox, a charter pilot who 
has logged more than 7,000 hours in the air. "As long as you follow 
international procedures and work with the local officials, you're going to get 
where you're going." 
</P>
<P>
Tony's father, Gary Aliengena, has been handling this time-consuming but 
important part of flying while his son takes over the more glamorous but less 
demanding task of actually holding onto the controls. RICHARD BEENE

JARREAU PULLS CROWD RIGHT INTO HIS COMFY MUSICAL LIVING ROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was a magical moment about two-thirds of the way through Al Jarreau's 
concert at the Pacific Amphitheatre on Saturday night when the audience finally 
surrendered to his unique brand of musical wizardry. The flash point came 
during "Does Anyone Want to Go Dancing?" An otherwise-enthusiastic but 
relatively staid audience jumped to its feet and began to boogie in time with 
the hip-notic rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
The mood of the evening had been established early on as the singer (who 
insisted that no "fun-busters" would be allowed to participate) seemed 
determined to sustain the proceedings at a virtual fever pitch. The occasional 
piece that began as a ballad was almost always quickly transformed into 
body-shaking funk. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the apparent lack of musical variety, Jarreau was never boring -- and 
never predictable. He worked with his eight-piece band as virtually equal 
partners. His between-songs raps worked the audience with the skill and humor 
of a professional stand-up comedian. 
</P>
<P>
Almost constantly in motion, he produced a startling array of vocalized drum 
sounds in combination with his two percussionists; he sang convincing bass 
lines and somehow mimed the sound of a feedback electric guitar. He danced and 
strutted like a peacock, then sat on the apron of the stage and transformed the 
vast arena into the intimacy of his living room. 
</P>
<P>
Jarreau's songs ranged from cuts off his current album ("Bottom Line" and "It 
Feels So Good") to such personal classics as "Take Five" and "We're in This 
Love Together." 
</P>
<P>
But the material was secondary to the performer: Jarreau has become such a 
masterful stage presence that it almost does not matter what he is singing. 
</P>
<P>
As mentioned, and to his credit, he allotted plenty of space in the spotlight 
to his musicians; virtually every song overflowed with horn breaks, guitar 
fills and drum solos. Saxophonist Michael Powell made the most of his many solo 
spots, and bassist Ricky Minor was a particularly strong presence, both in his 
ensemble work and in a lovely duet with Jarreau on "Take Five." 
</P>
<P>
By the time he was finished, Jarreau had made good on his threat: There had 
been no "fun-busting" in an evening of extraordinary entertainment from a 
performer at the very peak of his powers.

HICKOCK'S IRVINE CAMERATA GIVES INAUGURAL PERFORMANCE AT UC IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY McQUILKIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To an enthusiastic capacity audience in Fine Arts Concert Hall at UC Irvine on 
Friday night, the Irvine Camerata's inaugural concert brought both intelligent 
planning and brilliance of execution. 
</P>
<P>
Founded by Robert Hickock, dean of fine arts at UCI, the 25-voice ensemble 
reportedly began rehearsing less than two weeks ago. Yet this professional 
group admirably met the technical and artistic challenges of the meaty program. 
</P>
<P>
Opening with the plainchant "Salve Regina," the Camerata built the first part 
of the program around several 16th-Century settings of the "Salve Regina" text, 
which were interspersed between the five movements of Palestrina's "Missa Salve 
Regina." 
</P>
<P>
In motets by William Byrd, Tomas Luis de Victoria and others, Hickock 
demonstrated the degree of precision and polish he attained: superb intonation, 
great textual clarity and a stunning tone -- particularly in the spellbinding 
soft passages -- characterized the ensemble's singing. 
</P>
<P>
Though his conducting was perhaps excessively physical, he elicited telling 
nuances of phrasing and imparted a fine sense of overall shape to each work. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, though, balances were askew: The sopranos outgunned the altos, who 
were divided into two parts in the Palestrina and in the five-part motets. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard Heiden's "Divine Poems of John Donne" (1949) completed the a cappella 
part of the program. The Camerata made an extremely convincing case for the 
three evocative, potent and highly personal settings of the poems, effectively 
bringing out the striking dynamic contrasts of the works. 
</P>
<P>
During intermission, a large pipe organ had been moved onto the stage for the 
ensemble's performance of Heinrich Schutz's "Musikalische Exequien" (Musical 
Requiem). The 1636 work is a fine example of early Baroque sacred music; a 
fairly lengthy text is covered, without a great deal of repetition, and the 
texture is more chordal than contrapuntal. 
</P>
<P>
The short solo and soli sections, all of which were sung with precision, 
resonance and style, alternated with equally short sections of choral singing, 
delivered with vibrancy and exuberance. 
</P>
<P>
Both chorus and individual soloists sang the German text clearly and cogently, 
and organist Ronald Huntington and the other continuo players (two cellos, one 
bass) contributed handsomely.

A pregnant 30-year-old Santa Ana woman was critically injured and lost her 
fetus when she was hit by a speeding drunk driver fleeing an earlier traffic 
accident late Sunday night, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
The pedestrian, whose identity was not disclosed, is in "very critical 
condition with multiple broken bones," said Hong Nguyen, nursing supervisor at 
Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center. The fetus was stillborn 
after an emergency Cesarean section early this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Felipe Garcia, 20, of Santa Ana, who was allegedly fleeing an earlier noninjury 
accident at West 1st and Euclid streets, was chased and captured by Santa Ana 
police officers who said they saw the vehicle strike the woman in the 4000 
block of West 1st. 
</P>
<P>
Officers who arrested Garcia said he "was extremely drunk," Santa Ana police 
spokesman Cliff Seward said. Garcia was booked at the Orange County Jail for 
hit-and-run and driving while under the influence.

ABORTION FOES IN ORANGE COUNTY CELEBRATE SUPREME COURT RULING

<TEXT>
<P>
As did their colleagues across the nation, anti-abortion activists in Orange 
County exulted today over the U.S. Supreme Court's decision imposing tough new 
restrictions on a woman's right to the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pleased to see the court has taken a significant step toward the 
protection of women from exploitation and their children from murder," said 
Russell Neal, an Orange County spokesman for Southern California Operation 
Rescue. 
</P>
<P>
Although the court's decision on a Missouri case is not expected to have any 
immediate effect locally, pro-choice advocates in the county lambasted the 
verdict, calling it the first salvo in what promises to be a prolonged war over 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"It means we need to press our point a little harder, a little more vocally," 
said Margie Fites Seigle, executive director of Planned Parenthood of Orange 
and San Bernardino Counties. "We will do that by encouraging pro-choice persons 
to write to their legislators to let them know that reproductive rights should 
remain a choice for all women in California."

ATTACK BY STREET PREACHERS PROBED

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles police were investigating an attack on a Roman Catholic woman who 
said she was beaten by three Pacoima street preachers who told her she "needed 
to be a 'born-again' Christian," authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
The attack on Alna Rosa Bolanos, 19, of Pacoima occurred at 11:40 p.m. Sunday 
at the intersection of Laurel Canyon and San Fernando Mission boulevards in 
Mission Hills, police said. The intersection is a popular Sunday night spot for 
teen-agers who cruise the area in cars and on foot and for preachers who offer 
sermons from the street curbs, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers who went to the corner after Bolanos reported the attack at the 
Foothill police station found no preachers there, and no arrests have been 
made. 
</P>
<P>
According to the police report, Bolanos was walking on the sidewalk at the 
intersection when she passed a group of four or five street preachers. 
</P>
<P>
"They were standing on the corner preaching, and the suspects began yelling at 
her," Lt. Bernard D. Conine said. "She told them to leave her alone, that she 
was Catholic. They said she needed to be a 'born-again' Christian." 
</P>
<P>
Bolanos told police that three of the preachers, two women and a man, crowded 
around her and began insulting her. She said one woman grabbed her from behind 
and the other struck her repeatedly in the face before she was able to break 
away. 
</P>
<P>
The police report said Bolanos suffered a bruised cheek and two black eyes. She 
told police she would seek medical treatment on her own. She could not be 
reached for comment this morning.

The Supreme Court today rejected appeals by Latinos challenging Florida's 
designation of English as the state's official language. 
</P>
<P>
The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that an election giving 
official-language status to English did not violate the federal Voting Rights 
Act. 
</P>
<P>
Florida voters last Nov. 8 approved the proposal by an 84% to 16% margin. The 
initiative amended the state Constitution and left it up to the Florida 
Legislature to implement the change. 
</P>
<P>
Voters in Colorado and Arizona approved similar measures the same day, bringing 
to at least 17 the number of states that have passed laws or adopted 
constitutional amendments designating English as the official language. 
</P>
<P>
The other states are Arkansas, California, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, 
Kentucky, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Carolina, 
Tennessee and Virginia.

BRITON JEERED AGAIN AS HE DIMS REFUGEE HOPES

British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe was jeered again today as he 
slammed the door on hopes that Britain would offer refuge to all Hong Kong 
people if things go seriously wrong when the colony returns to Chinese rule in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
After delivering his message at a luncheon speech for community leaders, the 
foreign secretary continued to be taunted by political activists during what 
diplomats described as the roughest ride ever given here to a British Cabinet 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
Howe made it clear all Hong Kong's predominantly Chinese population would not 
be given the right to live in Britain although the government was considering a 
plan permitting some people from both private and public sectors to live there. 
</P>
<P>
He also lashed out at China, saying he and his Cabinet colleagues had been 
angered and appalled by the brutal suppression of the student-led democracy 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
Howe was greeted by jeering demonstrators when he arrived Sunday and at the end 
of his speech today one of the guests, political activist Lee Wing Tat shouted: 
</P>
<P>
"This . . . speech is an insult to the intelligence of Hong Kong Chinese. We 
are very angry about Hong Kong. You say you cannot give permission to 3.25 
million people to settle in Britain. . . . You will be handing them over to a 
bloody and suppressive government." 
</P>
<P>
Howe had earlier said, "I know the depths of your anxiety -- it is your lives 
and livelihoods that are at stake. . . . The plain fact is that there is simply 
no way that a British government could grant to several million people the 
right to come and live in Britain."

JUSTICES OK SOME YULETIDE RELIGIOUS DISPLAYS;

5-4 RULING SAYS VARIED SYMBOLS MUST REFLECT NATION'S PLURALIST TRADITION

The Supreme Court ruled today that some government-sponsored religious displays 
are permissible as long as they do not have "the effect of promoting or 
endorsing religious beliefs." 
</P>
<P>
By a 5-4 vote, the court said displaying a Christmas Nativity scene inside the 
Allegheny County Courthouse in Pittsburgh violates constitutionally required 
separation of church and state because it appears to endorse Christian 
principles. 
</P>
<P>
But the court by a 6-3 vote nanimously permitted a Hanukkah menorah on the 
front steps of the City-County Building in Pittsburgh because that display also 
included a Christmas tree and a sign saluting liberty, which the court said 
produced an overall secular purpose. 
</P>
<P>
While the justices were split sharply in declaring the Nativity scene 
unconstitutional, the court substantially upheld its long-used test for 
determining when the wall between church and state is breached. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote for the court and was joined in striking down 
the Nativity scene by Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, John Paul 
Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, participating in his first church-state case since 
joining the court in 1988, dissented in voting to permit the Nativity scene. 
</P>
<P>
The other dissenters were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron 
R. White and Antonin Scalia. 
</P>
<P>
Blackmun said the Nativity scene, or creche, violated the Constitution because 
"nothing in the context of the display detracts from the creche's religious 
message." 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, he said the display containing the menorah includes symbols that 
support the nation's pluralist tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"The city's overall display must be understood as conveying the city's secular 
recognition of different traditions for celebrating the winter holiday season," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said the court, in barring government sponsorship of the creche, showed 
"an unjustified hostility toward religion, a hostility inconsistent with our 
history and our precedents." 
</P>
<P>
Today's ruling relied heavily on a 1984 decision in which the court upheld the 
constitutionality of a creche in Pawtucket, R.I. The creche at issue there was 
surrounded by secular symbols such as Santa Claus, reindeer and snowmen. The 
Pittsburgh creche was displayed by itself.

Deposed Philippine leader Ferdinand E. Marcos will not be allowed back to his 
homeland dead or alive, President Corazon Aquino said today. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino said she was opposed to the return of Marcos, 71, because of the 
potential trouble his supporters could cause. The former president is near 
death in a Honolulu hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why she was opposed to the return of Marcos when he died, the president 
said: 
</P>
<P>
"We realize that Mr. Marcos is a Filipino citizen and should be allowed to come 
back. However, I also have to think about the lives of the millions of 
Filipinos whose lives could be affected by the return of Mr. Marcos, because 
his supporters, and especially his family and his associates, could be thinking 
of ways and means to destabilize this government."

Italian banks began new procedures today to stem the laundering of Mafia money 
through financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new regulations enacted by the Italian Banking Assn., deposits or 
withdrawals of 10 million lire ($7,000) or more will be separately registered 
and the customer will be subject to checks on the source of the money. 
</P>
<P>
Under previous regulations, checks were made on transactions of 20 million lire 
($14,000) or more. 
</P>
<P>
The steps were taken to thwart efforts by organized crime to launder money from 
drugs, racketeering and kidnapings by moving it around in smaller amounts.

PEPSICO TO BUY 2 TOP BRITISH SNACK FIRMS; 
</P>
<P>
HAD BEEN BOUGHT BY FRANCE'S BSN FROM RJR NABISCO

PepsiCo Inc. said today that it has agreed to pay $1.35 billion in cash for two 
large British snack food makers that the French food and beverage giant BSN 
bought from RJR Nabisco Inc. just a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
The companies, Walkers Crisps and Smith Crisps, were acquired by BSN as part of 
its purchase of RJR Nabisco's European food operations. RJR had sold those 
operations to reduce some of the debt from its record $24.5-billion buyout by 
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. completed earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Walkers and Smith are among Britain's largest sellers of potato chips and snack 
foods, with sales estimated at $460 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
"This acquisition makes PepsiCo the largest snack food producer in Europe," 
PepsiCo Chairman D. Wayne Calloway said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Strategic Opportunity' 
</P>
<P>
"It provides us with a great strategic opportunity to aggressively develop the 
entire European market, an opportunity that takes on added significance because 
of the elimination of trade barriers in 1992." 
</P>
<P>
When the 12 nations in the European Community drop their trade barriers in 
1992, they will succeed in creating a mammoth market of more than 300 million 
people. Many international companies, including American firms, are jockeying 
for position in order to be prepared for what will be a very different market. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street, though, wasn't enthusiastic about PepsiCo's move. In late-morning 
trading today on the New York Stock Exchange, PepsiCo fell 50 cents to $52.75 a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
PepsiCo said the acquisition is expected to dilute 1989 earnings by about 8 
cents per share. Company spokesman James Griffith said that the sale was for 
cash and that PepsiCo would finance the purchase with short-term debt, probably 
in the commercial paper market. 
</P>
<P>
For all of 1988, PepsiCo earned $762.2 million, or $2.90 a share. 
</P>
<P>

Stock prices rose today, reversing early losses that were pinned to an 
embarrassing defeat for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in Tokyo's 
municipal elections on Sunday. But trading was the lightest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The key 225-share Nikkei index gained 287.73 points or 0.87% to close at 
33,236.42, mirroring a 252-point drop early in the session. The index eased 
7.62 points on Friday. Advances led declines by more than 2 to 1, with 620 
issues higher, 289 lower and 162 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers said they were happy to get a clear answer on Sunday's Tokyo Assembly 
election, even though the results showed an embarrassing defeat for the LDP. 
</P>
<P>
"We say 'an election is a gamble,' " said Masaharu Sakudo, managing director of 
Tachibana Securities. "The outcome is hard to predict, and investors don't like 
that uncertainty." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the funds from investment trusts scheduled to enter the equity market 
last week did not appear as fund managers awaited the election results, brokers 
said.

Stock in LIN Broadcasting Corp. fell sharply for the second straight session 
today amid speculation that McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. might lower its 
$120-a-share bid for the company. 
</P>
<P>
McCaw said Friday that it will review its bid after the New York Court of 
Appeals rejected LIN's claim that it had the right to purchase additional 
cellular telephone interests in the lucrative New York and Philadelphia 
markets, where it already operates. 
</P>
<P>
Even without the rights in the two East Coast cities, many analysts said LIN 
was worth more than $120 a share, or about $5.8 billion. Nevertheless, LIN was 
down $2.375 a share to $113.50 in very active over-the-counter trading today, 
nearly $10 below its close Thursday.

After a nationwide search, Ohio State promoted from within today when Randy 
Ayers was named to succeed Gary Williams as the Buckeyes' head basketball 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of Ayers, Williams' top assistant, was announced at a news 
conference by Athletic Director Jim Jones. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe we've conducted a very thorough national search," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1st Black in Job 
</P>
<P>
Ayers, the Buckeyes' 11th basketball coach and the first black to hold the job, 
said he hopes to maintain "the honesty and integrity" of the school's program. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel a deep sense of gratification . . . for the high honor," Ayers said. 
</P>
<P>
The appointment must be approved by the university board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement ended a three-week search for a replacement after Williams 
resigned to take over at Maryland, his alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ayers, 33, has never been a head coach, he was Williams' top assistant 
after being elevated to full-time status in May, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas Coach Nolan Richardson had been a front-runner for the job after two 
other candidates -- Jim Crews of Evansville and Lon Kruger of Kansas State -- 
withdrew from contention Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But Richardson announced Sunday that he had withdrawn his name from 
consideration, saying he made his decision when he compared the comforts of 
Fayetteville, Ark., to the big-city living that would come with a job in 
Columbus.

MCENROE ARGUES BUT MAKES QUARTERFINALS;

<P>
John McEnroe argued with officials, then overpowered Australian John Fitzgerald 
today to reach the quarterfinals at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champions Stefan Edberg and Steffi Graf advanced in straight sets, 
while Tim Mayotte ended Placentia teen-ager Michael Chang's hopes of adding 
Wimbledon to his French Open title. 
</P>
<P>
Graf crushed Monica Seles, the 15-year-old Yugoslav, 6-0, 6-1 in 44 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
But the focus was on McEnroe, who displayed the best of his tennis and a 
glimpse of his famous temper. 
</P>
<P>
As police investigated a fourth death threat against him, McEnroe complained 
about line calls and a humming courtside refrigerator but beat Fitzgerald 6-3, 
0-6, 6-4, 6-4. The second set was the first time McEnroe ever lost at love at 
Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
His next opponent is fourth-seeded Mats Wilander of Sweden. It will be the 
first quarterfinal at Wimbledon since 1985 for McEnroe, who skipped the 
tournament in 1986 and 1987 and was eliminated in the second round last year. 
</P>
<P>
No details were released by police concerning the latest death threat, and it 
was not known whether McEnroe knew of the threat when he took the court. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe and umpire Rudi Berger of West Germany clashed over a double fault in 
the first set, as Fitzgerald came back from 4-0 to 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
"Nice call, Rudi!" McEnroe shouted on a changeover. The tempo picked up from 
there. 
</P>
<P>
On the next game, McEnroe thought that Fitzgerald, as server, failed to show 
the new set of tennis balls just put into play. He started prowling the base 
line, and Fitzgerald complained. McEnroe continued to walk, and Berger warned 
him for unsportsmanlike conduct. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe broke for 5-3 but continued to mutter, both at the umpire and at 
Fitzgerald. He served out the set, avoiding a Fitzgerald point-blank volley at 
the net, which landed long. 
</P>
<P>
On the changeover, McEnroe told Berger that he was bothered by a humming sound 
from the refrigerator that holds drinks and tennis balls. He also apologized to 
Berger and tournament supervisor Ken Ferrar after they told him that Fitzgerald 
had held up the new balls. 
</P>
<P>
That apology, and an apparent back problem, seemed to take the wind out of 
McEnroe. He dropped the second set at love, getting just 8 points, and the 
first game of the third set. Still bending and stretching his back, McEnroe 
then changed character again. 
</P>
<P>
He held for 1-1, then broke for a 4-3 lead. His old touch was back, his serve 
was in gear and Fitzgerald was staggering. 
</P>
<P>
Mayotte, the eighth seed, reached the quarterfinals for the fifth time by 
beating the 17-year-old Chang, the ninth seed, 6-3, 6-1, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg and Wilander reached the round of eight with easy victories, as did 
eight-time women's winner Martina Navratilova and three-time champion Chris 
Evert. 
</P>
<P>
Spanish teen-ager Arantxa Sanchez, the French Open women's winner and the 
seventh seed, struggled before beating error-plagued Lori McNeil in three sets, 
adding to her reputation as an all-court player. 
</P>
<P>
Three other women's seeds fell to unseeded opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Catarina Lundqvist of Sweden beat No. 6 Helena Sukova of Czechoslovakia 6-4, 
7-6; Laura Golarsa of Italy beat another Czechoslovak, 10th-seeded Jana 
Novotna, 7-6, 2-6, 6-4; and Rosalyn Fairbank beat 12th-seeded Mary Joe 
Fernandez of the United States 6-4, 2-6, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second victory over a seeded player in three rounds for the unseeded 
Fairbank, a California-based South African who ousted No. 3 Gabriela Sabatini 
in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
Others advancing in matches between unseeded players including Americans Dan 
Goldie and Gretchen Magers. 
</P>
<P>
Chang, the first American in 34 years to win the French Open, has been winning 
by adapting to grass courts from the base line and out-hustling opponents. But 
he couldn't shake Mayotte and broke his serve only once, to reach 2-2 in the 
first set. 
</P>
<P>
Mayotte dominated with his serve the rest of the way and he scored repeatedly 
with drop shots and drop volleys. Chang ran down a lot of them but could only 
shovel them into the net. 
</P>
<P>
Chang also made a series of uncharacteristic errors off his backhand and went 
down in 1 hour, 43 minutes, when Mayotte hit a forehand cross-court passing 
shot to complete a service break at love.

Outfielder John Kruk underwent arthroscopic surgery today on his right knee and 
will be out of the Philadelphia Phillies lineup for up to four weeks. He was 
placed on the 15-day disabled list and replaced on the roster by 
outfielder-first baseman Jim Adduci from the club's Triple-A affiliate in 
Scranton-Wilkes-Barre. 
</P>
<P>
Phillies team physician Dr. Phillip Marone said Kruk had an inflamed right knee 
cap, which was repaired at Methodist Hospital. He said Kruk would be out for 
two to four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Kruk, acquired from San Diego last month with infielder Randy Ready in a trade 
for Chris James, was batting .257 with three home runs and 21 RBIs.
