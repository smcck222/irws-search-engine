CHIROPRACTOR AGREES TO PAY AIDS PATIENT $5,000 IN BIAS CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Hillcrest chiropractor has agreed to pay an AIDS patient $5,000 and is 
prevented from discriminating against others with AIDS in the first lawsuit 
stemming from a city ordinance that prohibits discrimination against people 
afflicted with the deadly disease. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Joseph Cicmanec agreed to the out-of-court settlement on June 22, the same 
day that Superior Court Judge Kevin Midlam signed a permanent injunction that 
bars Cicmanec from refusing to treat a patient simply because he or she has 
AIDS. Cicmanec was sued by AIDS patient Robert E. Walsh Jr. in January, citing 
an anti-discrimination ordinance passed by the San Diego City Council in 
February, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
According to Walsh's lawsuit, he was "shamed, humiliated, degraded and 
emotionally upset" on Aug. 4, 1988, when Cicmanec and his staff refused to 
treat him upon learning that he had AIDS. Walsh had made an appointment with 
Cicmanec's office earlier in the day for a back realignment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Request of Referral Allowed 
</P>
<P>
Although there was no admission of wrongdoing on Cicmanec's part, the 
injunction prohibits him from "imposing or permitting any other hindrances 
which deter a person with (AIDS) from receiving" chiropractic care from 
Cicmanec. However, the court order does allow Cicmanec to request an oral or 
written referral from an AIDS patient's doctor before treating him. 
</P>
<P>
The injunction also permits Cicmanec to use his professional judgment, as with 
all patients, in deciding whether chiropractic treatment may be unnecessary or 
inappropriate for an AIDS patient's health. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for both sides said that terms of the agreement prevented them from 
discussing the settlement. Attorney Timothy R. Pestotnik represented Walsh free 
of charge. When Walsh's lawsuit was filed, Pestotnik said that his father had 
died of AIDS three years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Previous Cases Resolved 
</P>
<P>
Previous complaints of discrimination by people with AIDS had been taken to a 
free legal advice clinic sponsored in part by the San Diego AIDS Project. 
Before Walsh filed his lawsuit, all of the cases had been resolved without a 
lawsuit, Pestotnik said. 
</P>
<P>
James F. Stiven, who represented Cicmanec, said that both sides agreed "not to 
interpret" the injunction. But Stiven did acknowledge that the document 
specifically prohibits Cicmanec from refusing to treat patients solely because 
they have AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Measures barring discrimination against AIDS patients have been passed by 
several cities and counties throughout California in the past year. Several 
lawsuits have been filed in the past five years by AIDS patients and their 
families against medical professionals and businesses for alleged 
discrimination in other cities.

DIVERSIONARY TACTIC CHANGES LIFE OF FORMER CHAMPION OF THE STOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE WOLF, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Joyce Rue was fat. 
</P>
<P>
Very fat. The kind of fat that precludes activities that most people take for 
granted, such as sitting in an airplane seat, going to the movies or being able 
to see whether your shoes match your dress without using a mirror. 
</P>
<P>
But that was OK with her. Even though Rue had tried every imaginable method to 
lose weight, from hypnosis to stomach stapling, by 1981 she had come to terms 
with her body. That was the year that Rue founded Abundantly Yours, a San Diego 
support group for the chronically Rubenesque. 
</P>
<P>
Rue, vivacious and personable even at 300-plus pounds, encouraged others to 
embrace their fatness, to accept themselves and find joy in life. In its 
heyday, Abundantly Yours had 2,700 members, and there was talk of opening 
chapters worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Then the trouble set in. In 1987 Rue blossomed to 392 pounds and learned 
firsthand why obesity is considered a life-threatening condition. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't walk, I couldn't breathe, I couldn't sleep -- I'd wake up gasping 
for breath because of the weight on my lungs," she said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Life Wasn't Worth Living' 
</P>
<P>
Out of desperation, she went on a 700-calorie-a-day diet -- but still kept 
gaining weight. By that summer, Rue's mobility was so severely restricted that 
she was clinically disabled and collecting Social Security because she couldn't 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a mess and it just kept getting worse," she said. "My life at that point 
wasn't worth living." She figured she was about six months away from being 
confined to a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
Something had to be done. Something drastic. Something, as it turned out, that 
not only changed Rue's body but her mind as well. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that an earlier attempt at gastric stapling had proved a 
miserable failure, Rue decided to go under the surgeon's knife for a second 
time, in June, 1987. This time she chose a relatively new procedure called 
bilio pancreatic diversion, in which the intestines essentially are shortened, 
in effect preventing the patient from digesting fats and starches. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
212 Pounds Lighter 
</P>
<P>
Two years later and 212 pounds lighter, 46-year-old Rue now espouses bilio 
pancreatic diversion with the same missionary zeal she once applied to 
Abundantly Yours. 
</P>
<P>
"My whole life has just changed so wonderfully and dramatically," she said. 
"It's the best thing I ever did." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Rue now works in the office of the surgeon who performed the 
procedure, Dr. Wesley G. Clark. A former operating room nurse, she counsels 
obese patients who are considering having BPD surgery and helps them through 
the post-surgical and weight-loss process, coaching them on proper eating 
habits and offering emotional support. 
</P>
<P>
At 180 pounds, Rue is still overweight, but now fits easily into the 
normal-size world. Formerly a size 62, she now shops in regular department 
stores for size-16 clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Rue underwent a "tummy tuck" June 27 to remove the leftover flesh hanging 
around her midriff. The skin was then donated to a national burn center to be 
used for grafts. By the time she's fully recovered, Rue figures, she'll be 
another 30 pounds lighter. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never be a size 10, but that's OK," she said recently. "I'm doing things 
now I've never been able to do, like cross my legs at the knees. I can walk up 
and down the aisle of an airplane, and fit in a restaurant booth." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surprising Discovery 
</P>
<P>
She can play miniature golf now because, for the first time, she can bend over 
to retrieve the ball. She also thrills at the simple act of being able to wrap 
a bath towel all the way around her waist -- and being able to pick the towel 
up off the floor if she drops it. 
</P>
<P>
"I was lying in bed one night after I lost the weight and I felt a bump on my 
body -- I thought, 'Oh my God, I've got a tumor!' " Rue said. Then she realized 
there was a matching bump on the other side -- she was feeling her hip bones. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are things most people just take for granted, but everything is new to 
me. I would never have dreamed it possible!" 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who was listening in, nodded toward Rue and said with a smile, "This is 
a pretty typical reaction." Most of his patients, he said, had given up on 
having fun, until their weight loss provided them with a new zest for life. 
</P>
<P>
"Most seriously obese people live lonely, isolated lives," Rue said. "They 
don't care how they look." She paused, then rolled her eyes. "I swear, I'll 
never wear another muumuu as long as I live." 
</P>
<P>
Rue is clearly delighted with her new body image, and dresses the part. Having 
sworn off muumuus and tent-like skirts with expandable waistlines, she wears 
sleek clothes in bright colors and dangling, fashion-statement earrings. A 
delicate gold anklet calls attention to her legs, which she repeatedly crosses 
and uncrosses while she speaks. 
</P>
<P>
Rue looks back fondly on the days of Abundantly Yours and what it stood for -- 
acceptance of yourself, imperfect body and all. But she doesn't miss her fat 
days one bit. 
</P>
<P>
During the peak of popularity of Abundantly Yours, Rue did a tour of talk shows 
to promote the group, and was interviewed by Oprah Winfrey and Geraldo Rivera, 
among others. She found that her natural flair for dramatics and her bachelor's 
degree in marketing and advertising came in handy for promoting the group. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the hype, Rue still wanted desperately to lose weight. She tried "every 
kind of diet known to man," from the Atkins to the Zebra (only black and white 
foods allowed). Over the years, she figured, she had lost 2,200 pounds -- and 
gained it all back. 
</P>
<P>
She tried having her stomach stapled in 1981, but the surgery did not agree 
with her. The procedure, which essentially reshapes the stomach into a tiny 
pouch, allows the consumption of only a few tablespoons of food at a time. 
While it works for some, "it created a surgical bulimic out of me," Rue said, 
adding that she had a hard time keeping food down. She initially lost 48 
pounds, then regained it, then developed a host of medical complications and 
finally decided to have the surgery reversed. 
</P>
<P>
Abundantly Yours dissolved after Rue had her second, and ultimately successful, 
weight-loss operation. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel real grateful that I had the inspiration to start it, because it helped 
a lot of people feel better about themselves, regardless of their size," Rue 
said. "But sometimes I feel very sad that I couldn't make it survive on my 
own." 
</P>
<P>
She still occasionally gets together with some of the group's members, a few of 
whom followed her lead and had weight-loss surgery. Other former members, she 
said, have become distant and some friendships have disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
On the flip side, Rue has found that some people who ignored her when she was 
fat are friendly with her now. It sometimes angers her, she said, that 
friendships have been won or lost simply because of the size of her body. 
</P>
<P>
Rue has endured prejudice many times in her lifetime of obesity, and the bad 
memories started early. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very painful, especially to be a fat child. I started feeling it around 4 
or 5 years old, when I saw the other kids' dads could easily carry them," she 
said. "My parents kept taking me to doctors and they kept saying it was just 
baby fat and she'll lose it." 
</P>
<P>
By the time she was 11 years old, Rue weighed 230 pounds. At 16, she weighed 
345. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're a little kid and you're different, you're rejected," she said, 
tears welling up at the memory. 
</P>
<P>
To compensate, she became an overachiever, a class clown, and tried singing and 
dramatics -- anything to gain acceptance by her peers. She finally got her 
chance to sing a class solo, but ended up having to sing it from behind a 
curtain. 
</P>
<P>
"They said it was because I didn't have the proper clothes to wear. That was 
pretty humiliating." 
</P>
<P>
She believes, as her doctor does, that obesity is often genetically inherited, 
and that diet and exercise just don't work for the seriously obese. 
</P>
<P>
"Yet most people view obesity as a kind of moral issue," Rue said, "as if fat 
people somehow lack discipline." 
</P>
<P>
Because of that, the obese often work for less money than they are worth 
because of weight discrimination, Rue said. 
</P>
<P>
"Employers think that when you're sluggish in body, you're also sluggish in 
mind," she said. "But if they had the insight to hire and promote fat people, 
they would find people who work their butts off to overcompensate for the 
inadequacy they feel." 
</P>
<P>
Rue married at 29, but her husband died three years later. "It wasn't the best 
relationship," she said. "I married him because I felt it was my last chance." 
</P>
<P>
Rue said she gave up on romance. "The men I met who had a preference for fat 
women were too kinky or weird, so that's the way it's been for a lot of years." 
</P>
<P>
But since she has lost weight, she said, "my motor's running. . . . I'm real 
open to the idea of having a man in my life." 
</P>
<P>
Rue's plans include a return to acting as well as learning how to roller skate, 
ballroom dance, ride a bicycle and hang-glide. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day," she said with a grin, "is kind of like an adventure."

EMIGRES GIVE ANOTHER VIEW OF GLASNOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't talk to Alexander Besbrozvanny about culture shock. Don't try to convince 
him of the difficult transition from Soviet to American life. Just listen, and 
let him go on about the joy of the 50 states. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States is power, energy and movement," he said with a dazzling 
smile. "I am awed by its power, by the generosity and grandeur bursting forth. 
And this, this is a big town, so clean and beautiful, so homey and communal. . 
. . This, this is lovely." 
</P>
<P>
Besbrozvanny, 42, has been in the United States -- in San Diego -- for less 
than a month. Before that, he made temporary stops in Rome and Vienna, and 
before that he spent a lifetime in the Soviet Union. He is now a statistic, and 
happy to be one. 
</P>
<P>
Besbrozvanny is one of 350 Soviet emigres who have settled in San Diego in 
1989, according to the United Jewish Federation. (The number may double before 
the end of the year.) The figure compares with 153 who settled here in 1988 and 
20 who came in 1987. The last significant arrivals before that were in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Besbrozvanny, his wife and two children, ages 15 and 18, are reaping the 
benefits of perestroika, the willingness of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev 
to allow some citizens, particularly Jews, to immigrate to other countries. 
</P>
<P>
The exodus is having an impact on several fronts in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Brotman, chairman of the Passage to Freedom campaign being orchestrated 
through the United Jewish Federation of San Diego, said his organization needs 
to raise $570,000 by the end of the year to augment local resettlement. The 
nationwide fund-raising goal is $75 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The money is needed to fund the transmigration of Soviet Jews from Russia to 
Vienna to Rome to points in the U.S.A.," Brotman said. "It's an involved and 
time-consuming process, much more than the public would realize." 
</P>
<P>
Brotman said that San Diego is the nation's ninth-most-popular destination for 
Soviet emigres, who "don't look at a map and point to a city they'd like to go 
to." Generally, they have families they want to see again or, as with 
Besbrozvanny, housing and employment are available here. 
</P>
<P>
With a narrow, angular face, prominent cheekbones and hungry eyes that 
punctuate the severity of his message, Besbrozvanny could play the leading man 
in the movie "Emigre." The story would be a tragedy, he said, with its only 
happy moment coming near the end, the 
</P>
<P>
exodus to America. 
</P>
<P>
Besbrozvanny acknowledges the favorable view of most Americans toward Gorbachev 
and the radical policies of glasnost and perestroika. To be sure, they are 
welcome advances, he said, and provide the only way Besbrozvanny could have 
been sitting in a classroom in the Jewish Community Center on 54th Street in 
East San Diego on a recent morning. But the truth behind glasnost is far more 
complex than Americans realize, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For more than an hour, Besbrozvanny and six recently arrived emigres, with 
occasional help from an interpreter, described a ghoulish society in which Jews 
experience a chilling anti-Semitism not unlike Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, he said, glasnost fuels anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
It permits open displays of racism and hatred and protects the offenders from 
intervention by authorities. He said Skinheads are turning up even on the 
streets of Moscow and Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
"In Russia, anti-Semitism was, is and will be," said Besbrozvanny, who comes 
from Leningrad. "Under the growing democratic movement, it is worse. It's open 
season on ethnic groups. I have seen people beaten openly in the streets. 
Before, even with anti-Semitism, the government took a harsh view of such 
atrocities, only because they didn't want the citizens being unruly. Now you're 
freer to express yourself, in whatever way you choose." 
</P>
<P>
Besbrozvanny said glasnost has improved the Jews' lot only in making it easier 
to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"Gorbachev simplified the forms," he said as he and his colleagues roared with 
laughter. "He has done nothing to improve the life of the Jews in the workplace 
or in the universities, where the stiff quotas remain. Maybe he will do 
something in time. I didn't want to stick around to find out." 
</P>
<P>
Alla Belmes, 50, who comes to San Diego from the town of Baku, said that going 
to synagogue is a risk. The government keeps a record of who goes and how 
often, she said, and armed guards of the KGB line the aisles of the temple 
during services. 
</P>
<P>
Despite being natives of the Soviet Union, Besbrozvanny and friends paint a 
picture of life behind the Iron Curtain as one of alienation and confusion, 
intensified for Jews. In a hero-worshiping society in which murals of Lenin 
line the streets, Jews are more apt to feel alienated than other Russians; 
unlike Christians, their perception of God is that he can't be a man. To 
perceive the likes of Lenin as a god is to defy Judaism in a fundamental way, 
Besbrozvanny said. 
</P>
<P>
Lois Bloom of Jewish Family Service, the organization that smoothes the 
sometimes bumpy road of transition from Russia to San Diego, said that until 
recently most of the emigres living here had never experienced a Seder -- until 
Passover at the JCC. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the Soviet emigres living in the county are Jewish, but most of the 
1,000-plus are. (About 150,000 Soviet emigres have settled in the United States 
in the past 10 years, and the vast majority of those are Jewish.) Bloom said 
that until their arrival here, most were forbidden -- overtly or otherwise -- 
to practice their religion. 
</P>
<P>
The study of Hebrew was forbidden, until Gorbachev. And traditional Jewish 
observances were made in silence, if at all, Bloom said. 
</P>
<P>
"The great thing about perestroika," said Jill Borg Spitzer, executive director 
of Jewish Family Service, "is that they're actually letting them out, and 
that's a real change in policy. But I'm not so sure Soviet life is any better 
at all for a person who's Jewish." 
</P>
<P>
Besbrozvanny said that he, like many Jews -- like many Russians -- wanted to 
leave because work offered no mobility whatsoever, no sense of progress or 
hope. He feels that, because he is Jewish, he was periodically chastised in 
front of co-workers at the plant where he worked as an engineer. He said his 
children were forced to read the reprimand from their father's employer in 
front of classmates at school. 
</P>
<P>
He said that, when a would-be emigre tells the government he wants to leave, he 
is fired from his job immediately, as a matter of course. So the gamble, he 
said, is huge. You may not get to go, but you will lose your job. And while you 
remain, the treatment you receive won't be pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Little is a political science professor at San Diego State University 
and an observer of Soviet politics. During the interview with Besbrozvanny, he 
helped out with translation. Later, he said that men like Besbrozvanny have a 
great deal of courage. 
</P>
<P>
"Just being a Jew in Soviet society is one thing," Little said. "But to be a 
refusenik -- to apply to leave the country -- that's something else entirely, 
because there's no guarantee that you'll get to go, and what may happen in the 
aftermath may be worse than anything you experienced before." 
</P>
<P>
Besbrozvanny said he has no fear of America, no culture shock, no pangs of 
homesickness for comrades left behind, no nervous apprehensions. Except for 
one. 
</P>
<P>
Gennady Chertkov, 35, from the Ukrainian village of Zhitomir, answered for him. 
</P>
<P>
"English," he said. "We would all like to speak English better." 
</P>
<P>
"Americans have been extremely warm and helpful to us," Besbrozvanny said 
moments after asking a reporter if he was an "interrogator" working for the 
government. (Assured to the contrary, he continued.) 
</P>
<P>
He said that Jewish Family Service has been invaluable in arranging housing and 
get-togethers, day camps for children and, of course, all-important English 
lessons. 
</P>
<P>
Besbrozvanny said he also has many other things he wants to learn. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no Jewish religion, and want to know that," he said. "I have to know my 
Jewish history. And I want to know American democracy. I want . . . freedom. 
More than anything, I want true freedom."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COMPLAINTS PROMPT TESTS FOR ASBESTOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An inspector from the South Coast Air Quality Management District, following up 
on complaints about possible asbestos contamination from city-owned buildings 
being demolished in Lawndale, says the agency will test debris taken from the 
site for asbestos content. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Haynes, an AQMD air pollution specialist, inspected the site where 
three city-owned houses had stood, on 167th Street and Osage Avenue, after two 
people complained to the agency that material they believed contained asbestos 
was being removed. 
</P>
<P>
The buildings, in the old city yard, had been used to store surplus city 
material, from old tractor tires to city Christmas decorations to inoperable 
city vehicles, city officials and residents said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the complaints was filed by Anthony Reed, whose mother and sister live 
next door to the yard. He said he had collected several pieces of a siding 
material last week that city workers had separated from other debris and placed 
in 55-gallon drums near a wall separating his property from the city's. 
</P>
<P>
Reed, who provided pieces of the mint-green material to the AQMD, said he was 
told by a city employee working at the site that it contained asbestos.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: ESCONDIDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two fires kept Escondido firefighters busy Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
About 1:45 p.m., firefighters arrived at a home in the 1900 block of Harmony 
Grove Road to find it engulfed in flames. The blaze destroyed the house within 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was contained before it could spread to nearby residences, an 
Escondido Fire Department spokeswoman said. The cause of the fire is under 
investigation. Damage estimates were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
A second fire damaged an apartment in the 100 block of South Ivy Street, the 
Fire Department spokeswoman said. The blaze was reported about 3:40 p.m.

In Washington, House members stay up all night making speeches about how much 
they all love the flag. In Sacramento, a bill is introduced in the Legislature 
requiring the phone to be answered at public agencies within 10 rings. Don't 
these people have anything to do with their time? What we need is a law 
requiring elected officials to wear warning labels that tell you that they are 
dangerous when awake.

GREECE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "From Bad to Worse," editorial, June 21: 
</P>
<P>
As a Greek citizen and scholar I found your editorial very offending. Your 
sarcastic statement that Greece "claims" (my quotation mark) to have invented 
democracy is insulting to all Greeks. 
</P>
<P>
Especially disturbing is your passing judgment as to how voters of a free 
society such as Greece should vote. It reflects an elitist as well as an 
interventionist attitude on your behalf. You seem to be nostalgic for the days 
when the U.S. government manipulated political life in Greece by undermining 
popularly elected governments and assisting a military dictatorship. Well, 
those days are long gone. 
</P>
<P>
Greeks have now a true democracy again. It is a democracy free of U.S. 
government intervention, and offers, unlike that of the U.S., more than just 
two choices. Greeks, like most democratic European nations, have a truly 
pluralistic democracy with political parties of the right, middle and left, all 
represented in the Parliament. That is the ultimate sign of a true democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Your mocking of the way the Greeks voted on June 19 reflects your true feelings 
about Greece. You do not care about democracy in Greece; all you want is a 
"friendly government." Unfortunately for you, Greeks have other ideas.

UCLA REPORT ON POVERTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A UCLA study underscores a point that demands close scrutiny: While blacks are 
stuck at the same low-income level that they held in 1969, American-born 
Latinos and Latino immigrants are falling further and further behind non-Latino 
white workers in income, despite an economic boom in Los Angeles. They note 
that one way of addressing this growing disparity in income is via education. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidently, California was given an unusual opportunity to address the needs 
of Latino immigrants for the 1988-1989 academic year (ending June 30); $80 
million in Amnesty monies were made available for courses which teach English 
and citizenship to mostly Latino immigrants. About 30% of these monies ($23.6 
million) were allocated to the community colleges of California. 
</P>
<P>
The $80 million in Amnesty monies have been controlled by state School Supt. 
Bill Honig (the state Department of Education). 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Community College District alone had been allocated about $3.5 
million of the Amnesty monies and has thus far received only $800,000. It 
should not be surprising then to find that while the Los Angeles Unified School 
District has been serving 121,000 Amnesty students, the Los Angeles Community 
College District (LACCD) has been able to serve only 10,000 students (with 
5,000 on a waiting list) -- the LACCD should have been serving about 35,000 to 
40,000 Amnesty students. 
</P>
<P>
Presently, about 90% of the students completing the Amnesty program in the 
LACCD move right into the regular community college sequence of courses. It is 
conservatively estimated that there are about 500,000 Latino immigrants not 
being served by the Amnesty program. 
</P>
<P>
What can be done? We must all urge our representatives in the Assembly and the 
Senate to place all future Amnesty monies allocated to California's community 
colleges in the office of the chancellor of the California Community College 
system -- David Mertes. However negative any elected official might feel 
towards Mertes or Honig, the targeted Amnesty population should not be 
shortchanged. All of Los Angeles benefits from the Amnesty program.

UCLA REPORT ON POVERTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congratulations UCLA and The Times for making the public aware ("Poverty Gap 
Growing in L.A., Report Finds," Part I, June 20, "The Poor Get Poorer," 
editorial, June 21) of what local teachers, police, social and health 
professionals already know. Yes, the poor are getting poorer. There's trouble 
in River City. 
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, Prof. Paul Ong is sincere in saying "It's very difficult for 
people on the Westside like myself to understand that this is going on." 
However, it is naive not to realize that a large percentage of the more 
affluent are aware but avoid, ignore or deny the plight of the working poor, 
except when crime enters the picture. 
</P>
<P>
The statement that "less than 5% of the city's middle-class and well-to-do 
families pay more than half of their income for rent" seems to be the only 
mention of the middle class. Herein lies another tale. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas, in the past, the bulk of Los Angeles landlords were middle-income 
folks who tended their property and made a profit through reasonable rents, 
this is not so today. Now it is almost impossible for the middle class to 
purchase rental property. High prices and conglomerates that buy and tear down 
apartments to build condos and office buildings discourage small ownership. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the affluent do have a stake in the problems of the poor, but let's not 
forget the man in the middle. He, she or we are becoming extinct. Too bad, 
because some of our values will be sorely missed.

THE NOT-SO-GOOD-OLD FOURTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush says that growing up in the Constitution State of Connecticut, 
the Fourth of July was the perfect holiday, with flags, parades and political 
speeches -- introducing a small boy to the promise of America. But for millions 
of other small boys back then and in intervening years, the Fourth offered most 
an inalienable right to try to blow themselves up and set fire to random fields 
and houses, if not entire towns. 
</P>
<P>
In many states, it was legal not just to buy sparklers, Roman candles and 
fountains of fire, but massive firecrackers that resembled small sticks of 
dynamite. These red cylinders were about 2 inches long and 1 inch wide, packed 
with black powder and with a fuse -- always too short a fuse -- protruding from 
the side. One favorite tactic was to light one under an empty tin can to see 
how far in the air the can would go. There would be a "fuh-whump" sound and the 
can would rocket perhaps 40 or 50 feet straight up. When it came down, all the 
boys would run to see how much damage was done. A solid No. 2 tomato can would 
wind up bulging like a mushroom. Impressive power for boys. 
</P>
<P>
There were times, of course, when the fuse was lit, the can was placed on top 
of the 'cracker, and nothing happened. Did it go out? Was it a dud? Or was the 
fuse a particularly slow-burning one, still sputtering its way toward the black 
powder? One of the bigger, and braver, boys would inch up to the can, front 
foot ready to push off in fast retreat, and tentatively tip the can back to 
see. Sad to say, there are many grown men today with only one eye or perhaps 
missing a finger or two, who discovered that, alas, the fuse was still burning. 
</P>
<P>
Another favorite practice was to light an entire string of 20 or so smaller 
firecrackers and watch them go off in sporadic sequence, jumping about with the 
force of the reports. It was not unusual for one to soar unnoticed into a dry 
field nearby to smolder quietly and later erupt into fire. Silver-wrapped 
cherry bombs in the hands of bullies were used to terrorize little girls and 
dogs. These were the kind that were thrown on a sidewalk and exploded on 
impact, scattering tinfoil shrapnel about. Big boys had fun conducting duels 
with exploding Roman candles pointed at each other. 
</P>
<P>
Such explosives are almost universally banned now. But even the so-called safe 
and sane fireworks are dangerous in the wrong hands. How many small children 
have suffered terrible burns by picking up the wrong end of a sparkler that has 
just burned itself out? Perhaps it was one that an older child pitched into the 
air to see the sparkles arc through the Fourth of July evening sky. 
</P>
<P>
There is some irony in the fact that the regulation of commerce has abridged 
the rights of American youth to celebrate Independence Day with such 
pyrotechnic abandon. Ah, for the good old days. But millions of American 
parents, physicians and firemen are grateful that is so. The good new days may 
not be quite as exciting, but they are a good deal safer.

TRUST NOT IN THE CONSTITUTION, BUT IN VOTES

How bad? In Roe vs. Wade, the Supreme Court had said that the right to decide 
the matter of abortion belonged by and large to the woman. In the Missouri case 
decided Monday, the justices ruled that the right to decide belongs 
increasingly to the politicians. 
</P>
<P>
In Roe, the court struck down state limitations on abortion. In the Missouri 
case, the court invited state limitations. 
</P>
<P>
"Thus," as Justice Harry A. Blackmun opened his searing dissent, "not with a 
bang but a whimper, the plurality discards a landmark case of the last 
generation and casts into darkness the hopes and visions of every woman in this 
country who had come to believe that the Constitution guaranteed her the right 
to exercise some control over her unique ability to bear children." 
</P>
<P>
On the steps of the court, Faye Wattleton, the head of Planned Parenthood, 
asked rhetorically about these constitutional guarantees: "When did it become a 
political matter whether Americans have privacy? When did it become a political 
question whether women had reproductive rights? When did it become a political 
question whether poor people have the same access to their constitutional 
rights as the rest?" 
</P>
<P>
The answer to the question "when" was easy: On July 3, 1989, they all became 
political questions. 
</P>
<P>
Now every gubernatorial race, every statehouse seat, will become a referendum 
on sexual politics. The legislatures themselves may suffer from gridlock as 
abortion bills are rushed into committee in the next weeks and months. 
</P>
<P>
In practical terms, the Webster case affects only Missouri. But the national 
message is clear. Don't count on the Constitution to protect rights. Count 
votes.

<P>
Live by the sword, die by it. Pro-abortion forces who have lived by the Supreme 
Court are now dying a death of a thousand cuts at the hands of the court. 
</P>
<P>
Recent elections have been influenced by the provocation of pro-abortion groups 
that energized an anti-abortion constituency. 
</P>
<P>
It was provocative enough that pro-abortion forces used judicial fiat as a 
scythe in 1973 to mow down the abortion laws of 50 states. They should have 
practiced the patience of democracy, arguing their case in legislatures. There 
they had been succeeding. Fourteen states with 41% of the population had 
liberalized abortion laws before 1973. Since then, pro-abortion forces, 
including some on the Supreme Court, have been imprudently provocative and 
overreaching in rulings that have, for example, held that almost any parental 
involvement in, or delaying of, an abortion decision is an unconstitutional 
burden on the right. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Republican Party has prospered by harnessing the small 
but intense anti-abortion constituency. The GOP could get crushed if the 1973 
ruling is overturned and the party finds itself committed, as it is today, 
flatly against a right -- fairly free access to early abortions -- that a 
substantial majority of Americans endorse. 
</P>
<P>
By turning up the temperature in the abortion argument, Monday's decision makes 
trouble for George Bush, who deserves it. His smarmy pandering to the passions 
of the moment regarding flag-burning -- a constitutional amendment to stop what 
hardly ever happens -- will cause the right-to-life movement to clamor for 
similar exhibitionism on behalf of its amendment. It leaders will tell the 
First Opportunist that there are few flag-burnings a year but thousands of 
abortions every day. 
</P>
<P>
Let us hope the Supreme Court soon drives out of the intellectual cul-de-sac it 
took a wrong turn into in 1973. It should restore to the states the right to 
regulate abortions. Let's have a 50-state row over this, remembering (it seems 
to slip some judicial minds) that democracy is as American as French toast and 
English muffins.

<P>
Despite the joy most pro-lifers feel, the Supreme Court's decision on Webster 
vs. Reproductive Health Services appears to be based on nothing more solid than 
the personal whim of the justices. 
</P>
<P>
Just as Roe vs. Wade was based on the completely arbitrary "trimester" 
approach, devised by Justice Blackmun in an attempt to create a synthesis 
between medical opinion, law and theology, the court's latest ruling permitting 
states to restrict abortions smacks of arbitrariness by failing to include an 
unassailable base for the unborn's right to life that would have provided a 
standard for the future. 
</P>
<P>
The founders had such a base when they framed the Constitution: "All men are 
created equal and are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable 
rights," among which was the right to life. 
</P>
<P>
The court makes no reference to any such endowed right for the unborn by a 
creator, giving a future court the opportunity to decide what it wishes. One 
court giveth, one court taketh away. 
</P>
<P>
As former Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes said, "The Constitution is what 
the justices say it is," undercutting the foundation of a document that has 
served us well for more than 200 years. 
</P>
<P>
While some pro-lifers can today rejoice that the long national abortion 
nightmare seems to be ending, they should remember that without a return to law 
based on an unchanging principle, abortion could again come back to haunt us 
when a future court, or even this court, decides, for whatever reason, to 
resurrect Roe vs. Wade. 
</P>
<P>
For now the court has invited states to pass legislation restricting abortion. 
And well they might. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly the momentum has shifted as increasing numbers of Americans became 
disturbed over unrestricted abortions. As more women testified to post-abortion 
syndrome and as Operation Rescue made headlines by blocking entrances to 
abortion clinics, the staggering number of abortions performed daily -- 4,000 
-- has become, for many Americans, intolerable. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court has let stand a declaration in Missouri law that "the life of 
each human being begins at conception." For 16 years, though, the court 
concluded arbitrarily that life begins at birth. That decision led to the 
deaths of more than 24 million babies and the emotional scarring of millions of 
women. Having seized absolute power, the court did not feel the need to say it 
is sorry.

EVANGELISTS AND CRUISERS PROVE TO BE A VOLATILE MIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Fernando Mission Boulevard and Laurel Canyon Boulevard in Pacoima is a 
popular intersection for "cruisers" in sleek customized cars who hang out at 
fast-food joints on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
The cruisers draw born-again Christian missionaries, who have made a crusade of 
spreading the gospel among the congregated young people. 
</P>
<P>
The mix of cruise night and evangelism led to violence Sunday, when a 
spontaneous religious debate with Catholic youths escalated into a brawl that 
left each side nursing bruises and blaming the other. 
</P>
<P>
Alma Bolanos and her boyfriend, Albert Rabago, both 19, were out in Rabago's 
1966 Mustang with fellow members of the Styling Classics Mustang Club, 
celebrating the first big cruising weekend of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Preached for Years 
</P>
<P>
Also on hand were Henry and Patricia Chacon, 24 and 28, their 3-year-old 
daughter and about 25 other members of the Praise Chapel Christian Fellowship 
of Sun Valley. For the past several years, the born-again Christian group has 
preached its beliefs to cruisers without incident, Henry Chacon said. 
</P>
<P>
The Chacons said they preach to passers-by and "go one-on-one" with the young 
cruisers, many of whom they described as troubled by gangs, drugs and other 
spiritual ills. 
</P>
<P>
"We pray for people who are hurting," Henry Chacon said. "Every time we find a 
cruise scene, we're out there. We'll talk to anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Bolanos, a former contestant in the Miss San Fernando Contest, wore sunglasses 
Monday to cover a black eye and a scratched and swollen face. She said that 
during the confrontation in a parking lot outside the Pollo Gordo restaurant, 
the Chacons and other born-again Christians insulted her religion and made 
insinuations about her personal morality. 
</P>
<P>
Bolanos acknowledged that she struck first, using her sandal to swat Henry 
Chacon, but claimed she reacted to extreme provocation. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me I was Satan," Bolanos said. "They said I was lost and they had 
been found." At least three of the born-again Christians then attacked her, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rabago, Bolanos' boyfriend, said: "It doesn't make any sense. If they're really 
Christians, why are they hitting girls?" 
</P>
<P>
Chacon called their version a lie. He said he and his wife were the victims and 
that he also has a black eye, inflicted by Rabago, to prove it. He said he was 
trying to pull Bolanos off his wife when Rabago punched him. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy socked me in the eye with all he had," Chacon said. "I said, 'That was 
a cheap shot. But I still love you, man.' " 
</P>
<P>
Rabago said he punched Henry Chacon to defend his girlfriend. The Chacons said 
they were only trying to restrain Bolanos when she attacked Patricia Chacon 
after striking Henry Chacon. Patricia Chacon admits scratching Bolanos after 
pleading with her to let go of her hair. 
</P>
<P>
Police were investigating a complaint filed by Bolanos, but they had few 
details about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
The Chacons said Bolanos and the other teen-agers willingly took part in an 
extended and energetic street-corner theological debate. 
</P>
<P>
Bolanos, who wears a crucifix and said she attends Guardian Angel Catholic 
Church in Pacoima several times a month, said the conversation touched on a 
range of topics, including how God can allow starvation in Ethiopia and the 
relative merits of Catholicism versus Protestantism. 
</P>
<P>
But she said she talked with the street preachers only because they were 
irritatingly persistent and ignored efforts by the teen-agers to end the 
conversation. Her boyfriend is a Catholic but "told them he was an atheist so 
they would leave him alone, but they wouldn't," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Respected Them' 
</P>
<P>
"We respected them up to a certain point. We told them to go away, we were 
talking privately." 
</P>
<P>
Bolanos said she was offended when the Chacons criticized Catholic practices 
such as confession and made comments insinuating she was a "street kid." 
</P>
<P>
"If I go to church, why would they say I'm lost?" said Bolanos, who said her 
behavior on weekend nights is wholly respectable. "We just park the cars so 
they look nice and hang out," she said. "We don't even cruise." 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Chacon denied that her group said anything derogatory about Bolanos or 
Catholicism. "We're not out there to condemn people, we're there to comfort 
them," she said. "We're sharing personal testimonies." 
</P>
<P>
Words gave way to blows at the end of the discussion, both sides agreed, when 
one of the born-again Christians told Bolanos that he was going home to his 
father in heaven, referring to God, and added: "Who are you going home to?" 
</P>
<P>
Bolanos said she felt the question was insulting and she hit Chacon because he 
laughed at her when she said she was going home to her mother. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him, 'Don't you dare laugh at my mom,' " Bolanos said. "I hit him with 
my sandal." 
</P>
<P>
Along with different versions of the melee, the antagonists came away with 
different conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
Bolanos said: "It's false advertising. They're not peaceful people. I was born 
Catholic, raised Catholic and I'm gonna die Catholic." 
</P>
<P>
The Chacons said they will give tensions a chance to cool, then resume their 
spiritual mission among the cruisers of Laurel Canyon Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of persecution of us out there," Patricia Chacon said. "It's in 
the Bible that we're going to be persecuted. We're stepping into spiritual 
warfare, that's what I tell myself."

MAN LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN TO OUST BERNSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Northridge businessman who owns property in an area that Los Angeles City 
Councilman Hal Bernson wants to see redeveloped has launched a recall drive 
against Bernson, according to a document filed Monday with the city clerk's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Walter N. Prince, of Chatsworth, said he has formed a group called Citizens 
United to Recall Bernson. He said he is the only active member of the group. 
</P>
<P>
Prince owns an industrial building on Parthenia Street in Northridge, where 
Bernson initiated the redevelopment study. Bernson, who could not be reached 
for comment Monday, said in May that an obstacle to transforming the area into 
a business park has been the reluctance of some property owners to sell at fair 
market value to a redevelopment agency. 
</P>
<P>
Their reluctance prompted the city to undertake the study, expected to last a 
year, to determine whether the area is blighted enough to qualify under state 
law as a redevelopment zone. If it qualifies, a redevelopment agency could use 
condemnation powers to force owners to sell their land. 
</P>
<P>
Prince, in a letter circulated among the area's property owners last month, 
wrote: "We will NOT sit still and allow them to try to STEAL our property." 
</P>
<P>
Prince said Monday the redevelopment study was only one of several issues on 
which he differs with Bernson. Others include a Bernson-backed development plan 
for Porter Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of PRIDE, a group of Porter Ranch opponents, said Monday the 
group has not taken a position on a recall of Bernson.

REFLECTIONS: 'IT DIDN'T WORK BEFORE, AND I NEVER KNOW WHAT I DID, BUT IT'S 
FIXED.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Dale R. Duey dropped out of high school to take care of his father, who was 
dying from cancer. At 17 he got married and joined the Navy. Ten years later, 
Duey left the Navy to be closer to his five children. He became a skilled 
mechanic and recently struck out to start his own business. Duey, 48, and his 
wife, Jane, live in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
I started fiddling with cars when I was 15. I rebuilt a motor for my car when I 
was about 16. It was an old '50 Chevy, and back then you could have people come 
out and bore the engine right in your garage and turn the crank and things like 
that. So I rebuilt this engine in my garage. 
</P>
<P>
When I tightened up the rods on the crank, I really tightened them up. A 
neighbor was towing me to turn it over, and at about 20 m.p.h. I let out the 
clutch, and all it would do was just slide the wheels. It wouldn't budge that 
engine a bit. I finally figured out it was too tight, and I loosened it up. I 
thought I got it just about right. I got it started, and I was really proud of 
that. I pulled up behind the neighborhood parts store, and the guy come out, 
hollering, "Shut it off! shut it off!" About that time, the rod went right 
through the side of the block. It wasn't tight enough. 
</P>
<P>
I found another guy down the street who had a '48 Chevy that was a real piece 
of junk, but it had a good motor in it. I bought it for $20 and put the motor 
in my car and drove it. 
</P>
<P>
I've always been good at mechanical things. I used to be able to fix just about 
anything. I think it's just a knack. Sometimes I'll take something apart and 
put it back together, and it works. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't work before, and I never know what I did, but it's fixed. 
</P>
<P>
I started working my way up to being a mechanic in a filling station. Mostly I 
used to work nights in the gas stations. Then I started taking some classes 
from Pierce College over here. And one place I worked, the guy told me if I 
learned air conditioning he'd put me on days. So I learned air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
When I got a job at Firestone, that's the best thing that happened to me. I 
built up a nice trade over there. I made very good money. I was there for 10 
years. But then this last contract we had two years ago changed everything. I 
was going to lose probably around three to four hundred dollars a week. So when 
this shop became available, I was here in the afternoon and bought the shop by 
the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Basically I run the shop myself. I don't have any employees. I haven't been 
able to build it up big enough to really be able to afford to hire somebody. 
</P>
<P>
It's really hard to find anybody who you can trust. I try to make sure 
everything is right the first time, and when you put your trust in somebody 
else you have to know that they can do it, too. It's pretty hard to pay for 
somebody that's good until you get really busy. 
</P>
<P>
The general public doesn't realize that small businesses have so many licenses. 
Everybody's got their hand out. The city's got me with four licenses. The 
state's got me with two, and the county's got one. It costs you money. 
</P>
<P>
There's a lot of hidden costs that you don't really realize about till you get 
into it. The hazardous-waste laws now make it really tough. You used to be able 
to sell used oil. Now you have to pay to have somebody take it away. The laws 
are getting tougher every year. There's too much waste, especially in the big 
cities; they've got to control it. Otherwise it would be getting into our 
water. 
</P>
<P>
One of the things I didn't realize is how much time is spent on the telephone 
talking to customers, doing paper work. Sometimes you get so busy doing all 
these other things you don't have time to work on cars, and then you're behind, 
you got to work late. 
</P>
<P>
I'll always want to be in my own business, though. I like it. I really do. It's 
not because you have a lot of freedom or you're your own boss, because you have 
to work harder than you do when you work for somebody else. It's just that I 
like owning a business. It never gets boring; I guarantee you that. You never 
have time to be bored.

PALMDALE UNPERSUADED BY ACTON'S PLEA ON FIREWORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of an Acton civic group, citing the potential for forest fires near 
their rural community, canvassed fireworks stands in Palmdale during the 
weekend in an unsuccessful effort to persuade the businesses to sell fireworks 
only to Palmdale residents. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale is the only city in northern Los Angeles County to allow fireworks 
sales. Unfortunately, said Acton resident Charles Brink, some of these 
fireworks are purchased by people who take them outside the city. Brink is 
chairman of a fledgling civic group that is trying to establish an Acton town 
council to address local affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Brink said his group asked the vendors to check the identifications of people 
purchasing fireworks. "We're not trying to eliminate all fireworks sales, we're 
just trying to restrict them," Brink said Monday. The organizations declined 
his request, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The move to restrict fireworks was prompted by unusually dry weather and by an 
intermittent water shortage in Acton. Brink said Acton residents want to meet 
with fireworks vendors and Palmdale city officials in hopes of clamping down on 
fireworks sales by next year. 
</P>
<P>
But Palmdale Mayor William J. Knight said he doubts the public would support 
restrictions on fireworks sales. Knight said that many local charities, such as 
service clubs and high school athletic teams, maintain that fireworks sales 
account for as much as 90% of their annual budgets. Ten organizations obtained 
licenses to run fireworks stands in the city this year, according to city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Knight said Palmdale does not endorse the illegal use of fireworks outside the 
city limits. But he also said it is the responsibility of other cities and Los 
Angeles County -- not Palmdale -- to police the illegal use of fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Fire Department, under contract to Palmdale for fire 
service, opposes fireworks and annually urges the city to ban them, Capt. 
Ronald Hayton said. Through the years, some City Council members have tried and 
failed to win support for a fireworks ban, he said.

OPEN MIND WINS NINTH CONSECUTIVE RACE; BECOMES SEVENTH TO GAIN FILLY TRIPLE 
CROWN 
</P>

Open Mind became the seventh horse to sweep the filly triple crown, being 
placed first when Nite Of Fun was disqualified for bearing in during the 
stretch run of Monday's $283,500 Coaching Club American Oaks at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
It was the ninth consecutive victory for Open Mind, owned by Gene Klein. She 
has won 11 of 13 career starts and was second the other two times. She has won 
$1,569,764. 
</P>
<P>
Nite Of Fun beat Open Mind to the wire by a nose but was placed second in the 
field of six for bearing in on Open Mind after entering the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
The other winners of the filly triple -- the Acorn, Mother Goose and Coaching 
Club American Oaks -- were Dark Mirage (1968), Shuvee (1969), Chris Evert 
(1974), Ruffian (1975), Davona Dale (1979) and Mom's Command (1985). 
</P>
<P>
"She's done everything we've asked her," said Jeff Lukas, who handles East 
Coast training for his father, Wayne Lukas. 
</P>
<P>
Open Mind also became the second filly to sweep the Kentucky Oaks, Pimlico Oaks 
and the three New York races. Davona Dale was the other. 
</P>
<P>
Rose Diamond led through the first mile, with Open Mind her closest pursuer 
nearing the far turn. Midway on the turn, Open Mind took the lead but soon was 
challenged by Nite Of Fun, who drew even entering the stretch. Nite Of Fun 
thrust her head in front entering the stretch but then bore in on Open Mind, 
forcing Cordero to check her. Open Mind then recovered and altered course to 
the outside. 
</P>
<P>
Open Mind returned $2.60, $2.20 and $2.20. Nite Of Fun paid $4 and $2.10, and 
Rose Diamond returned $2.10. Open Mind ran the 1 1/2 miles in 2:32 2/5.

SILVER SCREEN HANDICAP; 
</P>
<P>
SADDLE SORE: COREY BLACK WINS ABOARD 37-1 SHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps Corey Black should get into jockeys' room scuffles more often. The 
20-year-old rider mixed it up with another jockey, Amir Cedeno, after the 
second race at Hollywood Park Sunday, and has been riding as though the 
stewards' fine would be thousands, not only $100. 
</P>
<P>
Black was sore in the neck from his second-race spill, and sore at Cedeno for 
shutting him off at the three-eighths pole. But Black came back and won both 
the third and fourth races Sunday, finished second with Fitzwilliam Place in 
the Beverly Hills Handicap and then on Monday rode Raise a Stanza, a 37-1 shot, 
to a half-length victory in the $169,700 Silver Screen Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Both Black and Raise a Stanza had been recently known more for their turf 
accomplishments than anything they had done on dirt, but the Silver Screen 
changed that. 
</P>
<P>
Going into the 1 1/8-mile main-track race, Raise a Stanza's only stakes win 
this year had been on grass -- and on a disqualification -- in his last start. 
And although Black had been winning with a good 13% of his mounts in grass 
races this season, his percentage on dirt was only half that. 
</P>
<P>
The Silver Screen was reduced to 12 3-year-olds after Notorious Pleasure, the 
colt who finished ahead of Raise a Stanza in the roughly run Cinema Handicap on 
June 11, was scratched because trainer Hector Palma didn't want to run from the 
outside post. 
</P>
<P>
Notorious Pleasure was the morning-line favorite, but his 7-2 price was 
indicative of what a handicappers' nightmare the Silver Screen was. The crowd 
of 20,546 made Prized, one of only three starters who had won last time, and 
Endow, the California Derby winner, the slight favorites. 
</P>
<P>
Endow loomed in contention, on the outside and in fourth place, coming out of 
the far turn, but he settled for seventh. Broke the Mold, who ran as an entry 
with Exemplary Leader and went off at 14-1, finished second, 1 3/4 lengths 
ahead of Prized, who stumbled out of the gate and had a wide trip while making 
his first start in four months. 
</P>
<P>
Raise a Stanza, running 1 1/8 miles in 1:48 2/5, paid $76.60, $27.80 and $11.20 
to become the highest-priced winner of the 11-year-old Silver Screen. The Raise 
a Man-Short Stanza colt earned $102,200 for his owner, Jack Kent Cooke. Broke 
the Mold paid $11 and $5, and Prized returned $3.80. 
</P>
<P>
Raise a Stanza carried 115 pounds, five pounds less than Endow, who was the 
high weight. Black was never on Raise a Stanza's back until he worked the horse 
for trainer Jay Robbins Monday morning. Gary Stevens, who had ridden Raise a 
Stanza in two of his last three races, told Robbins he might be making a 
mistake, but elected to ride Endow in the Silver Screen. 
</P>
<P>
Bruho might have been Black's Silver Screen mount, but trainer Julio Canani, 
unhappy with the weights, didn't run and Black felt an obligation to Robbins, 
who had used him to ride Flying Continental to a 12th-place finish in the 
Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
When they were younger horses, Robbins worked them in company and first thought 
that Raise a Stanza was better. Even with the Silver Screen going to Raise a 
Stanza, Robbins said Monday that he still thinks Flying Continental, second to 
Sunday Silence in the Santa Anita Derby, is better. 
</P>
<P>
"But this horse is improving," Robbins said of Raise a Stanza. "He doesn't like 
dirt hitting him in the face, and we were able to avoid that today." 
</P>
<P>
Advocate Training set the pace, running respectable early fractions through the 
first half-mile, with Raise a Stanza close behind at all times. On the turn for 
home, Advocate Training dropped out of contention, with Broke the Mold making 
his move. 
</P>
<P>
Broke the Mold, under Martin Pedroza, held a one-length lead in mid-stretch, 
but Raise a Stanza kept coming. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got my horse in gear, he finished the whole way down the lane," Black 
said. "He feels like a route horse, and he wasn't getting late today. He's kind 
of lazy, but he has a big stride and he's strong. I can't believe he's by Raise 
a Man (who sires mostly sprinters)." 
</P>
<P>
The next logical race would be the Swaps at 1 1/4 miles on July 23, except that 
trainer Charlie Whittingham has announced that his Kentucky Derby-Preakness 
winner, Sunday Silence, is going to run. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't see any reason why we shouldn't go for it," said Black, still flush 
with Monday's victory. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins took a less forceful perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe Charlie will give his horse a little longer rest," the trainer said. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
A stewards' hearing for Dean Bailey, the mutuel clerk who was involved in the 
alleged Pick Nine scam at Hollywood Park, will be held Saturday. The clerk has 
been suspended indefinitely and there is a chance that the stewards could issue 
a ruling against him. A Pick Nine ticket for about $4,600 was cancelled by 
Bailey, then sold by the bettor to several patrons. They thought they held the 
only ticket on a $1.3-million payoff until the track told them that the bet had 
been voided at the request of the original bettor. 
</P>
<P>
"Jockeys Across America" day at tracks around the country accounted for an 
estimated $80,000 for the Don MacBeth Memorial Jockey Fund. Many jockeys 
contributed the equivalent of one mount fee to the fund, which aids injured 
riders who have hospital bills. At Hollywood Park, fans spent $5,000 Saturday 
on T-shirts sold on behalf of the fund, which is named after the jockey who 
died of cancer. Marje Everett, Hollywood Park's chief operating officer, 
reportedly made a personal contribution of $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Shoemaker, who will be honored at Hollywood Park during a night program on 
July 21, won two races Monday in Stockholm on his retirement tour, raising his 
record total to 8,807. . . . Trainer Julio Canani said he would not run Putting 
in the Sunset Handicap on July 21, because the horse has a tendency to jump 
shadows. . . . Amir Cedeno wasn't fined for his role in the altercation with 
Corey Black on Sunday, but the stewards handed him a five-day suspension for 
not having better control of his horse. . . . Black will be at River Downs near 
Cincinnati today to ride Annoconnor.

MORNING BRIEFING: HERE'S A SITUATION IN WHICH HAVING LESS IS AN ADVANTAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pete Rose has eight letters in his two names. Harmon Killebrew has 15. All else 
being equal, doesn't Rose have almost twice the earning power of Killebrew when 
they sign autographs at the these baseball card shows? 
</P>
<P>
Doesn't seem fair, does it? 
</P>
<P>
Hall of Fame slugger Mel Ott once said, "Every time I sign a ball, and there 
must have been thousands, I thank my luck I wasn't born Coveleskie or 
Wambsganss or Peckinpaugh." 
</P>
<P>
The trick, of course, is to change your name. Think of poor Connie Mack if he 
had had to sign his real name. He came into the world as Cornelius 
McGillicuddy. 
</P>
<P>
Going to the extreme, what if you had to sign your full name? Former pitcher 
Cal McLish, who is part Indian, was Christened Calvin Coolidge Julius Caesar 
Tuskahoma McLish. 
</P>
<P>
His friends call him Buster. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Add autographs: The St. Petersburg Times did a poll in which readers were asked 
whose autograph they coveted most among sports legends. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Nicklaus was first, closely followed by Don Shula. Then came Red Grange, 
Muhammad Ali and Chris Evert. Tied for sixth were Rose and Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
Of the first five, all live in Florida except Ali. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More autographs: Said Casey Stengel: "About this autograph business. Once, 
someone in Washington sent a picture up to me and I wrote, 'Do good in school.' 
I look up, this guy is 78 years old." 
</P>

<P>
Trivia time: Who won the men's singles gold medal in tennis in the Seoul 
Olympics? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Now-it-can-be-told Dept.: After the Golden State Warriors signed 6-5 guard 
Sharunas Marchulenis, high scorer on the Soviet Union's championship team in 
the Olympics, Coach Don Nelson said: "When negotiations first started, I began 
to learn Russian. Then I learned he doesn't speak Russian, he speaks 
Lithuanian." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Add Marchulenis: Scout Scotty Stirling of the Sacramento Kings, who once worked 
for the Warriors, told the San Francisco Chronicle: "The people are going to go 
absolutely crazy for him. He's big, for one thing. And he's obviously looked at 
a lot of NBA basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"These Soviet players aren't like they used to be -- mechanical, do it by the

Pittsburgh pitching coach Ray Miller, who once worked for Baltimore, said: "I 
remember one time in Anaheim, we clocked a home run off Eddie Murray's bat at 
122 m.p.h. on a Nolan Ryan fastball. When you talk about speeds like that, you

T-Bill Rates Drop: Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities fell to 
their lowest level in eight months. The Treasury Department sold $6.6 billion 
in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.96%, down from 8.07% last 
week. Another $6.6 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average discount 
rate of 7.63%, down from 7.78% last week. The rates were the lowest since 
three-month bills sold for 7.82% last Nov. 14 and six-month bills averaged 
7.48% last Oct. 31. The discount rates understate the actual return to 
investors -- 8.24% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for 
$9,798.80, and 8.05% for a six-month bill selling for $9,614.30.

ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc.: The Costa Mesa-based drug maker said earnings fell 
46% to $3 million in the second quarter. Sales were up 9% to $44.5 million. ICN 
said the unfavorable quarter-to-quarter comparison in net income resulted from 
debt repurchases and gains in the company's investment portfolio in last year's 
second quarter, as well as substantially higher research and development 
spending by Viratek Inc. in this year's second quarter. It said both its 
pharmaceutical and biomedical operations registered solid gains in the quarter.

SMALL BUSINESS: NEW FACES; 
</P>
<P>
EXCEL IN SIMI VALLEY MAKES INROADS IN COMPETITIVE PROSTHETIC MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Plenty of businesses have been started in garages -- some great ones such as 
Apple Computer and some disasters such as Barry Minkow's ZZZZ Best. 
</P>
<P>
It's still too early to tell about Excel, the company Kurt Tennyson and Maurice 
Helland started six years ago in a Simi Valley garage. Excel makes 
realistic-looking silicon or plastic noses, teeth and eyes used for cosmetic 
purposes by cancer and accident victims. 
</P>
<P>
Last year Excel broke even on total sales of $50,000, but the future has 
promise. Excel has moved into a proper office and Tennyson and Helland have 
quit their full-time jobs at UCLA in hopes of building their company into a 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
Although Excel's products are exotic, one problem the company must overcome is 
common to many small businesses: how to compete against much larger companies 
when you're short of cash. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Price of Nose Varies 
</P>
<P>
Excel is the smallest of four or five firms that make prosthetic facial devices 
in Southern California. And while Tennyson and Helland sell a silicon nose for 
$500, their rivals typically charge $2,000 for essentially the same product. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the difference can be traced to a type of insurance similar to 
malpractice coverage that allows the prosthesis-maker to deal directly with 
clients and thus charge more. Excel does not have such insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way to really make it is to deal directly with the public," said O. 
Robert Levy, head of a Los Angeles firm that makes prosthetic eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Levy's company has insurance so that he and his technicians can deal directly 
with customers and charge retail prices. The optometrist said the company did 
$500,000 in sales last year and turned a $125,000 profit. Levy said he founded 
his company in 1946 and counts as one of his longtime customers Sammy Davis 
Jr., who lost his left eye in an automobile accident in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
Rivals said Excel's insurance bill might run $25,000 a year, and Tennyson said 
"right now we don't have the money it would take to redo the office and pay the 
insurance premiums." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Money Problems 
</P>
<P>
It's a classic small-business Catch-22. To grow, Excel must have more money. 
But it can't easily borrow more money until the company is bigger. 
</P>
<P>
So what do Tennyson and Helland do? Keep hustling for new business and hope 
sales keep growing until they save what they need to expand. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, it's not an easy life. Helland and Tennyson are Excel's only 
employees; each works 60 hours a week. Last year they didn't take any salary, 
instead using what spare cash the business generated to buy equipment. This 
year they expect Excel to hit about $100,000 in sales, and the two hope to take 
home about $15,000 to $20,000 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Helland, 56, has a Navy pension to augment his income, while Tennyson, 35, has 
$23,000 in savings in case things get tight. Tennyson's wife works, earning 
about $25,000 a year as a dental hygienist. 
</P>
<P>
"She's holding down the fort this year for us and our two children," Tennyson 
said. "We're not eating out or taking vacations this year." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Materials 
</P>
<P>
The prosthetics industry began to grow in the 1950s, when materials such as 
silicons and vinyl plastics began to be used widely. Every year in California 
about 3,000 people require facial prosthetics as a result of cancers or 
accidents, and nationwide the number is 60,000, said John Beumer, chairman of 
the removable prosthodontics department at UCLA's School of Dentistry. 
</P>
<P>
Dental technicians such as Helland and Tennyson, medical illustrators and 
specially trained dentists and oculists -- who make artificial eyes -- work at 
private companies and university laboratories, measuring patients and 
custom-making cosmetic devices. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons we do this is because it's so rewarding to help people get 
back into society again," Helland said. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have artistic ability to do this kind of work," said Carole 
Peretti, a medical illustrator who opened the Center for Prosthetics and Makeup 
in Hollywood in December and is an Excel rival. 
</P>
<P>
A dentist mails clay-like impressions of the client's face to Excel, and the 
two men use it and photographs to create a realistic facsimile of the missing 
facial part. The process involves creating a wax mold and filling it with 
silicon. The prosthetic is hardened in a special oven and hand-painted. The 
whole process can take two days. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spare Parts 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, it's a business with some unusual aspects. Tennyson said that 
the fees for a nose include a spare, which is usually painted a shade darker to 
mimic a summer tan. 
</P>
<P>
Facial prostheses are attached with glues like rubber cement and are removed 
daily, Tennyson said, by rinsing the plastic body part with soap and water or 
applying something like paint thinner. A non-water-soluble glue was developed 
for people in rainy climates or for those who sweat profusely and are afraid 
their nose or ear will fall off. 
</P>
<P>
Tennyson tells a story about a patient whose artificial ear became discolored a 
few months after he received it. No one could figure out why -- usually it 
takes about a year before yellowing. Then the man's wife came up with the 
answer. The patient would read the newspaper and habitually touch his ear with 
his ink-stained hand to make sure the ear was in place. 
</P>
<P>
Helland and Tennyson met 12 years ago at UCLA, where both fit clients for 
facial prostheses and also taught dentists how to make the devices. They earned 
about $30,000 annually, Tennyson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Broke Even 
</P>
<P>
The two men started their company with $4,000 in 1983 in Helland's garage. 
Working evenings and weekends, they broke even the first year. As the business 
grew -- entirely by word of mouth -- they were able to purchase about $75,000 
worth of used equipment, such as special lathes and ovens. 
</P>
<P>
Helland retired from UCLA in the spring of 1988, and Tennyson quit in February 
to work at Excel full time. "I could tell I was at a standstill at UCLA after I 
didn't get a raise for six years," Tennyson said. "There's more potential 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Excel, which gets orders from about 40 dentists, has a far smaller customer 
base than its rivals. Levy, for instance, said he makes about 800 eyes per year 
for patients from around the world. The Peyton Massey Prosthetic Center of West 
Los Angeles, which has been in business for 35 years, has about 175 clients and 
did about $500,000 in sales last year, said spokesman Allen Feuerstein. 
</P>
<P>
Making facial prosthetics is highly labor-intensive. Tennyson and Helland often 
return to the lab after dinner and stay until midnight. Someday they may hire 
additional technicians, although they said they are concerned the quality of 
the lab's work would suffer. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest risk in this business is job burnout from the long hours," 
Tennyson said. "But we're not burned out yet."

WINDS OF CHANGE BLOWING AT MIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1985, the timber giant Weyerhaeuser Co. set up a real estate investment 
trust named Mortgage Investments Plus, based in Woodland Hills, as part of its 
expansion into financial services. 
</P>
<P>
Such trusts, known as REITs, sell stock to the public and invest the proceeds 
in real estate, typically commercial properties. Some investors like REITs 
because REITs avoid paying federal income tax by distributing 95% of their 
income to stockholders in the form of dividends. 
</P>
<P>
MIP raised about $90 million from its stock sale and began investing in new 
office buildings and other commercial properties under development in 
California. Weyerhaeuser, meanwhile, continued supporting MIP by providing it 
with administrative and advisory services, and collected a fee for its trouble. 
</P>
<P>
But four years later, it is questionable whether MIP is worth the trouble any 
longer for Weyerhaeuser. The Tacoma, Wash.-based timber concern earned $564 
million last year on sales of $10 billion. But MIP's fees kicked in a mere $1 
million of Weyerhaeuser's sales. Although MIP is profitable -- it earned $4.3 
million on revenue of $10.1 million last year -- Lawrence W. Farmer, MIP's 
president, acknowledged that MIP barely covered Weyerhaeuser's costs of helping 
MIP to operate. Farmer added that MIP "has not been real profitable for" 
Weyerhaeuser. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sharpen Its Focus' 
</P>
<P>
And a big change might be coming for MIP. Weyerhaeuser recently announced that 
it wants to "sharpen its strategic focus" in the 1990s. Translation: It might 
stick with forest products and reduce its role in mortgage banking, real estate 
and other financial services. 
</P>
<P>
For now, Weyerhaeuser's commitment to MIP is intact, but longer term "it's hard 
to comment at this point," said Don Lange, president of Weyerhaeuser Mortgage, 
the Weyerhaeuser unit that deals with MIP. 
</P>
<P>
What happens if Weyerhaeuser tires of MIP's current setup? Weyerhaeuser could 
cut MIP adrift, perhaps forcing the firm to liquidate its properties. Or 
Weyerhaeuser might buy out MIP's stockholders and merge the firm into its own 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
Weyerhaeuser's role is important because it does most of MIP's legwork in real 
estate transactions, and all of MIP's officers are Weyerhaeuser employees. If 
MIP had its own staff today, its overhead costs would be too high and leave 
little room for profit, Farmer said. 
</P>
<P>
Farmer indicated another potential solution: MIP could survive on its own, with 
Farmer and other Weyerhaeuser employees becoming employees of MIP. Farmer said 
that if MIP could find a cost-efficient way of running its business itself, 
Weyerhaeuser "would not oppose that." 
</P>
<P>
So Farmer has begun planning on how MIP could generate more business to support 
its own payroll. Farmer, a 53-year-old ex-Marine, thinks MIP can do that with 
its new strategy, under which it will reduce its investments in buildings under 
construction and instead focus on the properties it already has or on buying 
existing properties. 
</P>
<P>
What's the difference between old and new buildings? Investing in new 
developments carries certain risks. Construction could be delayed or MIP and 
its partners -- many of MIP's projects are joint ventures -- could have trouble 
finding tenants to lease its new buildings. Either would delay MIP's ability to 
collect rental income. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Existing Buildings 
</P>
<P>
Existing buildings often are already leased. That lets the owner focus on 
improving the site -- be it changing a building's landscape, its tenant mix or 
the terms of the tenants' leases -- to boost rental income and increase the 
REIT's return on investment. 
</P>
<P>
If MIP is out on its own, Farmer must do something to boost his company's 
appeal to investors. Unless MIP can find a way to increase its stock price, 
it's unlikely the trust can return to the market and raise money by issuing 
more stock. Yet the cash from selling more stock might be the only way MIP can 
grow faster. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, MIP's stock has never climbed back above its initial price of $10 a 
share in 1985. The stock, which closed Monday at $7.625 a share on the American 
Stock Exchange, is virtually unchanged so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
"The market wants to see growth in cash flow," said Rita R. Dominguez, an 
analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. "That's what it will reward. We really don't 
see that at MIP." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cash Flow 
</P>
<P>
Cash flow is vital because investors pay close attention to a REIT's dividends, 
and the dividends are determined by how much cash flow -- that is, interest 
income on its loans, fee income and rental income -- a REIT generates each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1970s, REITs got a bad reputation when, during the recession, many 
of them collapsed from poor management, bad loans and other maladies that cost 
investors billions of dollars. When Weyerhaeuser set up MIP in 1985, REITs had 
begun to come back into favor, in part because tax reform was about to crimp 
the advantages of other real estate investments. 
</P>
<P>
But MIP's record hasn't been the best. In the four years that ended May 31, the 
average annual total return (stock appreciation plus dividends) for REIT 
industry stocks was 3.9%, said Christopher Lucas, research director for the 
National Assn. of Real Estate Investor Trusts, a Washington trade group. But 
MIP's average return was a meager 1.6%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Young Company 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, MIP is still a young company and many of the REITs against which it 
is compared are older, have bigger portfolios of properties and a history of 
steady dividend growth. Given more time, MIP also might bolster its results, 
particularly because it will be able to start selling some of its holdings next 
year. Under IRS rules, REITs must hold properties at least four years before 
they sell them, and MIP's original investments will reach that threshold next 
year, Farmer said. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Farmer also is moving MIP away from developing office 
buildings and more toward investments in industrial and regional shopping 
centers. The latter two are easier to rent and are less time-consuming and 
costly to build, he said. 
</P>
<P>
So, in addition to being a part-owner of such office complexes as the San Diego 
Corporate Center and the Ontario Business Center, MIP now has interests in such 
retail centers as the Sunwest Retail Plaza in San Bernardino and the Mart of 
Montebello. 
</P>
<P>
With this strategy, Farmer is trying to emulate a successful REIT such as 
Burnham Pacific Properties in San Diego. Since being converted from a 
partnership to a REIT in April, 1987, Burnham Pacific has raised $60 million in 
two stock offerings, raised its dividend eight out the last 10 quarters and has 
its stock trading 25% above its initial price. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Track Record 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Burnham Pacific has a much longer track record than MIP. Burnham 
Pacific is affiliated with John Burnham &amp; Co., a 98-year-old real estate 
and mortgage services concern in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
But Louis J. Garday, Burnham Pacific's president, said his firm has 
outperformed MIP because it invests in existing properties and then tries to 
improve those properties and increase the rental income they generate. By 
contrast, MIP generally earns a fixed return on its money while its new 
buildings are being developed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"MIP has some properties I would love to own," Garday said. "But the stock 
market doesn't seem to be as patient with that format."

JACK SMITH: FOURTH OF JULY AFTER THE WAR TO END WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I don't like to say that things aren't what they used to be, but I doubt that 
there will ever be another Fourth of July like the ones we had when I was a 
small boy. 
</P>
<P>
They were raucous, exhausting and super-patriotic. In the 1920s, World War I 
was fresh in everyone's mind. It had been, after all, the war to end war, and 
most of us believed it. 
</P>
<P>
In the eyes of a small boy, World War I was the noblest event in history; it 
was the Holy Grail. American doughboys had sailed the Atlantic to save the 
world ("Goodby Broadway, Hello France!" "Lafayette, we are here!"). 
</P>
<P>
Somehow that war stayed in our minds longer than World War II did later on. 
After World War II we were so horrified by the revelations of the Holocaust, 
and so frightened by the specter of the nuclear Armageddon, that any romantic 
feelings about the war itself were subdued. 
</P>
<P>
But we all felt good about World War I. The American Legion was an organization 
of veterans with enormous political power. We looked with forebearance on their 
juvenile high jinks in gratitude for their heroism. 
</P>
<P>
Boys my age collected souvenirs of that war. I had a genuine doughboy helmet 
and a wooden model of a Springfield rifle. For hours on end I played at war in 
our back yard, going "over the top" and invariably dying in the end. I was 
rather a theatrical lad, and very good at dying. My abiding fear was that there 
would be no war when I was old enough to fight. I needn't have worried. 
</P>
<P>
I remember an incident with my father. Riding beside him one day in his Wills 
Sainte Claire, I asked him if he thought there would be a war for me when I 
grew up. I have never forgotten the anger that crossed his face. It is one of 
my strongest impressions of him. He said, "Damn it! Nobody wants another war!" 
I was cowed, and from that point on I believe I looked less favorably on 
soldiering as a career. 
</P>
<P>
In 1925, we had no notion that the Treaty of Versailles had irreparably divided 
Europe, and that the seeds of the next war were already planted. Even when we 
declined to join the League of Nations we thought, "Good. Best keep out of it." 
</P>
<P>
We were in our era of wonderful nonsense. The nation was prosperous. The stock 
market was climbing. President Coolidge said, "The business of America is 
business." On Broadway the Marx Brothers were cavorting in "The Cocoanuts." 
Everybody was singing "Yes, Sir, That's My Baby!" Lou Gehrig joined the 
Yankees. In Germany, "Mein Kampf" was published. 
</P>
<P>
I have vivid memories of the Fourth of July in Bakersfield. As usual in July, 
it was unmercifully hot. Chester Avenue was like melted wax. Painted crosswalks 
wavered and the soldiers' boots left depressions in the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
But every small town in America could still turn out an impressive company of 
doughboys, and they still marched with vigor, like conquering heroes. They were 
still young and lithe, and their uniforms still fit. We stood on the hot 
sidewalks and cheered them as they marched past. 
</P>
<P>
The bands were typical small town bands, heavy on the oompahs and full of 
spirit as they pumped away at "The Star-Spangled Banner," "It's a Long Way to 
Tipperary," "The Stars and Stripes Forever" and "Over There." 
</P>
<P>
Ahead of the doughboys came first the thinning troop of Civil War veterans. If 
they had been 20 when that war ended they would have been 80 then. They 
teetered precariously along the soft street, bumping into one another, but 
still wearing their old uniforms, blue and gray, with pride. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the Spanish-American War veterans; middle-aged, but still vigorous, 
and their contingent was large. At last count, only one was left in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
When one remembers the Yankees parading down Broadway or down the Champs 
Elysees after the reconquest of Paris, it is hard to realize that one day we 
will all be gone. 
</P>
<P>
After the parade, we all retired to the city parks to picnic on tubs of fried 
chicken and barrels of ice cream. Despite Prohibition, our fathers drank home 
brew and became noisily patriotic. 
</P>
<P>
Things didn't turn out the way we thought they would; but we still have 
something to celebrate. We are still free.

ART BUCHWALD: COPING WHEN YOUR POPPER WON'T POP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Art Buchwald 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is what is going on today in the world of merchandising. Take a department 
store -- any department store. 
</P>
<P>
"Sir, I'm interested in this electric popcorn maker. Is it any good?" 
</P>
<P>
" 'Good' is not the word for it. This machine is the best that money can buy. 
It pops corn light and fluffy without ever missing a single kernel. We've been 
carrying this model for three years and nobody has ever brought one back." 
</P>
<P>
"In that case, let me have one." 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, sir. That will be $49.99. Did you want a service contract to go with it?" 
</P>
<P>
"I thought you said that it was a wonderful popcorn maker. Why do I need a 
service contract?" 
</P>
<P>
"You never know what will happen when you leave the store. A mail truck could 
run over it, or some child on a skateboard could knock you down in the parking 
lot. The cost is only $190 and it's good for 18 months." 
</P>
<P>
"That's outrageous. What about the warranty?" 
</P>
<P>
"The warranty only helps if something happens to the popcorn maker while it is 
being used on a nuclear submarine." 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be kidding." 
</P>
<P>
"It also guarantees the machine for parts and labor if it breaks down in the 
Amazon rain forest. Sir, it's none of my business, but you would be much better 
off with a service contract. With this contract, a company representative will 
fly from Asia on the same day to fix your machine." 
</P>
<P>
"But you told me yourself that no customer has ever brought back one of these 
popcorn makers." 
</P>
<P>
"That's because they all had service contracts. If they didn't, the machines 
wouldn't last 48 hours. We're already doing you a favor by letting you purchase 
a contract from us." 
</P>
<P>
"Can the store make money on these contracts?" 
</P>
<P>
"Not with the popcorn machine. May I see your driver's license?" 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that if the appliance sells for $49.99, the service agreement 
shouldn't cost $190." 
</P>
<P>
"I guess you've never seen the inside of a popcorn maker. It's a mess. It 
wouldn't be worth our while to sell a contract for less." 
</P>
<P>
"Does every item in this department come with a service contract?" 
</P>
<P>
"Everything but Mr. Massey, the manager, over there. Nobody will take one on 
him." 
</P>
<P>
"All right, give me a service agreement on the popper. Now it's my 
understanding that if anything goes wrong with it, I can have it fixed." 
</P>
<P>
"In a jiffy. Just air freight it to the factory in Taiwan and they will repair 
it for you at no charge whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
"I feel better knowing that there is someone out there if I need him." 
</P>
<P>
"If, for any reason, it is not repaired to your satisfaction, may I suggest you 
buy this vacuum cleaner to sweep up all the kernels from the floor." 
</P>
<P>
"How much is that?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"It costs $470, not including the insurance policy in case the popcorn stops up 
the nozzle of the cleaner."

DENTAL PATIENTS: DON'T BITE ON JUST ANY IMPLANT IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 65-year-old San Fernando Valley businessman had a choice -- full dentures 
that had to be taken out every night or individually implanted, artificial 
teeth that could chew anything, even apples. He happily opted for dental 
implants, considered by some the most revolutionary dental breakthrough in the 
last 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
But after a $10,000 investment, he had to have them all removed because he 
developed severe gum infections due to an allergic reaction. Another woman had 
every implanted tooth redone because a dentist with little or no experience had 
placed them at an improper angle. At least one patient a week complains of 
problems at the UCLA Dental Implant Center. Even the Food and Drug 
Administration, which doesn't often hear from consumers, has logged 15 to 20 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Dental implants, which have been on the market for 30 years, have exploded in 
the past two years because many more companies and dentists are offering 
improved technology. But it requires special training to insert the screw-like 
anchor into the jawbone and attach the non-removable tooth. 
</P>
<P>
"Some manufacturers will sell to any dentist," says Dr. John Beumer, professor 
of prosthodontics at the UCLA School of Dentistry who is an implant specialist, 
"regardless of whether they participate in training sessions." Even in the best 
of dental hands, a patient's underlying bones may not grow up to meet the 
anchor, a process known as osseointegration that's vital to the success of 
implants. Faulty materials can also cause implants to fail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stricter Restrictions Sought 
</P>
<P>
At least 26 manufacturers produce the implant systems, and critics say some are 
so shoddy that they are calling for stricter government regulation. Under the 
current FDA guidelines, new manufacturers can get clearance simply by proving 
their system is equivalent to products already on the market. In the future, 
the FDA will require manufacturers to submit clinical tests that prove their 
safety and effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
The American Dental Assn., which already requires five years of clinical data, 
has approved only one implant system -- the Branemark. Three more -- Core-Vent, 
Interpore and Oratronics, which are in the process of submitting the required 
clinical data -- have been granted provisional acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
But manufacturers insist their success rates are high. Dr. David Wacker of the 
Encino-based Core-Vent Corp. cites a 96% success rate in 623 implant patients 
after five years. More than 95% of 800 Interpore implants are still functional 
five years later, says George Smyth, president of the Interpore International 
in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Be Inquisitive, Meticulous 
</P>
<P>
For patients contemplating dental implants, experts offer these caveats: 
</P>
<P>
Ask the dentist about his track record with such questions as "How many 
implants have you done?," "What is your success rate?" or "Do you have special 
training?" 
</P>
<P>
"Go with a well-proven implant system," advises Dr. Steven Lewis, a UCLA 
assistant professor of prosthodontics. 
</P>
<P>
Don't go overboard. Limit to 10 implanted teeth, Beumer suggests. 
</P>
<P>
Be meticulous about oral hygiene. "Someone who can't maintain adequate oral 
hygiene isn't a good implant candidate," says Dr. Peter Woehrle, a dentist at 
the Harvard School of Dental Medicine. "They should floss daily, use special 
brushes to clean between implants and see their dentist every three months for 
an least a year." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dental Phobia 
</P>
<P>
Some dental patients, terrified of drills, needles and pain, put off visits for 
years. Now, sympathetic dentists are trying to make office visits less 
frightening for just these dental phobics. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of barking "hold still while I drill," dentists are taking 15 to 20 
minutes to discuss their patients' fears. Dr. Nathan Friedman, head of 
behavioral dentistry at the USC School of Dentistry, suggests dentists strike a 
bargain. "The dentist should agree to proceed with treatment only with the 
patient's permission," he told a recent meeting of the International Assn. of 
Dental Research. 
</P>
<P>
That feeling of powerlessness, in fact, is often the crux of dental phobia. 
"While patients will tell you they fear the needle or the drill, the major fear 
is a feeling of loss of control," says Dr. Gordon Rubin of the Dental Phobia 
Clinic at Mt. Sinai Medical Center in New York. 
</P>
<P>
To allay fears, Rubin teaches patients to relax with guided imagery: "We ask 
patients to take themselves to a relaxing place like a beach or a mountain 
lake." 
</P>
<P>
Dental phobics can find a dentist skilled in fear reduction techniques by 
calling their local dental society. Rubin also maintains a nationwide list. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Antibiotic Fiber 
</P>
<P>
When gums are disease-ridden, dentists sometimes have to resort to lengthy gum 
surgery or painful procedures like scraping bacteria away from infected teeth. 
But soon there will be another weapon for this common problem that affects 
three out of four people sometime in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Under study is a thin, polymer fiber, soaked with the antibiotic tetracycline, 
that dentist can wrap around the infected tooth and gently push below the gum 
line. After 10 days of antibiotic treatment, the dentist removes it. "It's a 
painless treatment," says Laura Mills, a spokeswoman for the Palo Alto-based 
Alza Corp., which has applied for FDA approval to market the treatment. 
</P>
<P>
And seemingly effective. In an in-house study involving 133 patients, the 
antibiotic fiber therapy improved all 626 affected teeth in some way. "The 
therapy is an effective way to control localized infections that cause gum 
disease," says Dr. J. Max Goodson, the research dentist who developed the 
treatment at Boston's Forsyth Dental Center. 
</P>
<P>
But Goodson cautions it's not a cure-all. Indeed, there are some potential 
drawbacks. Long-term exposure may cause allergic reactions in patients and 
create bacteria resistant to the antibiotics, cautions Dr. Roger Stambaugh, a 
respected West L.A. periodontist. "It may work best," he says, "for early-stage 
gum disease."

SILICONE INJECTIONS INCREASE BREAST DISEASE RATE IN RATS

Question: I had a silicone implant operation to increase the size of my 
breasts. Now I've heard that these implants have been found to cause cancer. Is 
this true? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Silicone gel injected into the breast tissue of rats did result in an 
increased rate of breast cancer, but what is true for animals does not 
necessarily apply to humans. There is no evidence that these implants are a 
cause of cancer in women. 
</P>
<P>
Q: It's bad enough to have diabetes, but a nephew of mine has diabetes and a 
heart condition. To top it off, although he'd like to keep physically active 
because he knows it would be good for the diabetes, he's afraid of doing 
anything too strenuous because of the heart condition. I assume that other 
people must have had this problem, and I'd like to know if anyone has come up 
with an answer to it. 
</P>
<P>
A: Most people with heart conditions can engage in some form of exercise, but I 
can't even begin to suggest what might be appropriate for your nephew. He 
should check with his physician, who may be able to make specific 
recommendations for an exercise program, or who may refer him to a specialized 
center. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why should someone who appears to be in good health become constipated? If 
constipation does become a problem, is there any away to treat it without 
drugs? 
</P>
<P>
A: Simple constipation -- that is, irregularity not due to some underlying 
disorder -- usually results from one of three conditions: a lack of bulk or 
liquid in the diet, insufficient exercise or failing to respond to body 
signals. 
</P>
<P>
The frequency with which constipation is being reported these days has been 
attributed to changes in the diet -- away from high-fiber foods, such as 
fruits, vegetables and whole-grain breads, and toward fats and refined sugars. 
Irregular and inappropriate eating habits are important causes of constipation. 
</P>
<P>
The hectic pace of modern life has also been implicated as a cause of 
irregularity. When a person tends to delay using the toilet, body signals may 
subside; if this pattern is repeated over a period of time, the result may be 
chronic constipation.

The movie box office may be having its best summer ever with record-breaking 
grosses, but a new poll indicates that many Americans don't think movies are 
what they used to be. Overwhelming majorities in a Media General-Associated 
Press poll of 1,084 adults gave unfavorable reviews to most new films and said 
the overall quality of movies has been declining. The reasons: sex, violence 
and profanity, which the participants said most of today's movies have in 
excess. Criticism of content was extraordinarily high, with eight in ten saying 
most new films have too much violence and too much profanity, and seven in ten 
saying most new movies have too much nudity. Overall, 56% said the quality of 
movies has been getting worse over the years. Ticket prices were another 
complaint. While three-quarters of respondents paid $5 or less for their last 
ticket, a sizable 45% said the price was unreasonable, and six in ten of the 
most avid moviegoers (those younger than 30) said ticket prices are too high. 
The poll also found that Americans watch movies on home videocassette recorders 
far more often than they go to a theater, and half of VCR owners said they go 
out to movies less since buying their machines. Ten percent of all respondents 
said they had gone out to see a movie in the previous week, while a third had 
rented a movie cassette in the previous week to watch at home. In all, 75% own 
a VCR. There was a glimmer of good news for the film industry: Six in 10 gave 
favorable marks to the last movie they had seen, but that was tarnished by the 
fact that about as many had an unfavorable impression of new movies in general.

"Bad Influence," a Rob Lowe movie currently being filmed in various locations 
in Los Angeles, won't be allowed to shoot in the Glen-Donald co-op building on 
West 9th Street near MacArthur Park if some of the residents have their way. 
John Medford, one of about 70 residents of the building, said Monday he is 
circulating a petition that seeks to reject the film crew's scheduled July 
24-27 visit because of allegations that Lowe videotaped sexual incidents 
involving a 16-year-old Atlanta girl. "Hollywood cannot use our building to 
promote and sanction gross sexual immorality by filming ('Bad Influence') in 
our building," says Medford's petition. Medford said Monday that he has 13 
signatures on the petition so far and added that the issue will be raised 
Friday at the monthly co-op meeting. Medford said that he would withdraw the 
objection to the film if the producers fired Lowe and cut one scene from the 
script that reportedly involves the videotaping of a sexual encounter. ALEENE

Negotiators for ABC and NABET are scheduled to hold a federally mediated 
meeting in New York next Tuesday to discuss ABC's plan to put into effect a 
contract that most of the union's members rejected. John Krieger, spokesman for 
the National Assn. of Broadcast Employees and Technicians, says he doesn't know 
what will occur after the meeting, though no walkout seems imminent. The 
union's 2,150 full-time and 300 part-time members at ABC have yet to take a 
strike vote. They have been working without a contract since March 31, when 
their old one expired. NABET, which struck NBC for 17 weeks in 1987, last 
struck ABC in 1977 in a walkout that lasted 20 weeks. ALEENE MacMINN

'COMING INTO PASSION' AT THEATRE 6111 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jude Narita's gallery of Asian and Asian-American women, "Coming Into Passion, 
Song for a Sansei," has returned to town at Theatre 6111, essentially unchanged 
from its earlier, award-winning incarnations at the Powerhouse and Fountain 
Theatres. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of brief monologues, Narita plays a cheerful Vietnamese prostitute, 
a desperate Filipina mail-order bride, a Nisei (second-generation 
Japanese-American) woman who is learning to assert herself, and a rowdy Sansei 
(third-generation Japanese-American) teen-ager. She also performs "Little Boy," 
a fairy tale about Hiroshima. 
</P>
<P>
There isn't a clinker in the bunch. Narita's writing begins to paint remarkably 
rounded portraits with a few simple strokes, and her performing completes the 
picture. She goes to the heart of the conflicts brewing within these women -- 
and in so doing she also works on a larger canvas, covering what happens when 
Asian and American cultures collide. 
</P>
<P>
The only obvious updating in the show is a radio news bulletin about the 
Stockton schoolyard shootings of Asian children, carefully timed to precede 
Narita's Hiroshima piece. We're also able now, as we weren't before, to compare 
Narita's Sansei sketch to "Sansei," the full-length musical extravaganza that 
played the Mark Taper Forum last spring. Narita's piece is much funnier and 
more pointed. 
</P>
<P>
Narita's prologue and epilogue aren't as successful as the rest of the piece. 
Her final speech about the value of the heart, offered during her curtain call, 
is particularly prosaic, in comparison with what has gone before, and utterly 
superfluous. She's much better at creating characters who express her feelings 
than she is at stating those feelings directly. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6111 W. Olympic Blvd., Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m. Tickets: $15; (213) 
466-1767.

JIM MURRAY: RAIDERS KEPT SHELLING IT OUT, THANKS TO LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the waning moments of Super Bowl XI, Jim Marshall, the great Minnesota 
Viking defensive end, disgustedly began to peel off his game gloves and started 
to walk slowly off the field. It was a gesture later to be made famous by 
Roberto Duran in a fistfight when he quit the lists with a murmured "No mas!" 
to the referee. 
</P>
<P>
Like Roberto, Marshall had had enough. He had been Shell-shocked. 
</P>
<P>
Every veteran lineman in the American Football Conference could appreciate what 
Jim was going through. He had just undergone four quarters of shot and Shell. 
Light -- 220 pounds -- but fast and tricky, he had been asked to crash through 
a man who looked like a Dolomite Alp with a helmet on. You didn't know whether 
to rush Art Shell or ski him. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Marshall got no sacks that day. In fact, he got no tackles of any kind. He 
spent that day in early 1977 tumbling around the Rose Bowl turf like a guy 
caught in an avalanche. 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland Raiders beat the Vikings in that Super Bowl, 32-14. It wasn't a 
contest, it was a collapse. The Raiders moved at will for 459 yards, 266 of 
them on the ground. They rushed 52 times and averaged 5.1 yards a carry. It was 
just batting practice for the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter, when Oakland had botched one play and had to settle for a 
field goal instead of a touchdown, the Raider quarterback, Ken Stabler, went to 
the bench, where Coach John Madden was purple with rage. 
</P>
<P>
"The score should be 14-0, not 3-0!" Madden screamed. 
</P>
<P>
Stabler looked at him coolly. "Don't worry, coach," he soothed. "There's more 
where those came from." 
</P>
<P>
And there was. That's because the Raiders ran most of their plays to their 
favorite route -- the left side of the line. Halfback Clarence Davis rolled up 
137 yards, or nearly nine yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't supposed to be that easy. The Vikings that season had the famous 
Purple People Eaters defense -- Carl Eller, Alan Page, Gary Sutherland and 
Marshall. They had swallowed the league that season. 
</P>
<P>
But this time, it was the Purple People Eaters who got et. When the game was 
over, it was the Raider offensive line that was burping. 
</P>
<P>
When they talk of Raider tradition and Raider glory around the press boxes of 
the pro game, the names of Daryle Lamonica, Ken Stabler and Jim Plunkett, Cliff 
Branch and Fred Biletnikoff loom large, to say nothing of Ted Hendricks, Willie 
Brown, Jack Tatum, John Matuszak, Lyle Alzado and Howie Long. Gene Upshaw gets 
a call. 
</P>
<P>
But it's just possible that the hard Shell of the Raider game through the glory 
years was the one whose first name was Art. 
</P>
<P>
When someone asked Madden before Super Bowl XI whether he planned to stick to 
his patented left-side attack, the coach shot back, "Why not? We still got Art 
Shell -- and Upshaw -- over there, don't we?" 
</P>
<P>
It was widely accepted that, with Shell and Upshaw anchoring the left side of 
the line, a limp zebra could go through a pack of hungry lions there. 
</P>
<P>
In the first place, they grossed more than a quarter of a ton between them. 
Shell went 290 and Upshaw 270. Each was 6-foot-5. They were both quick. 
</P>
<P>
"I could do a 40 in five seconds under pads; Uppie could do it in 4.7," Shell 
recalls. 
</P>
<P>
Most teams, like most people, are right-handed. The strong side in football -- 
the one with the most players on one side of center -- usually is the right. 
The Raiders, like Billy the Kid, fired left-handed. Their quarterback, Stabler, 
was left-handed, and when they went that way they took no prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders were also a long-striking team. This meant that pass-blocking, the 
most difficult form of protection, had to be of longer duration than normal. It 
is a rule of thumb in the pro game that you get 3.5 seconds to get rid of the 
ball. Raider quarterbacks expected four or five. Long passes take longer. Even 
Olympians need five seconds to run 50 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Other teams in the league had long since made concessions to the sophisticated 
zone defenses and gone to short or dump-off passes. 
</P>
<P>
"We never did dump off much," recalls Shell. "You just had to hold your block 
till Snake (Stabler) found somebody open." 
</P>
<P>
With Stabler, the problem was intensified. Ken could move only slightly faster 
than holiday traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Shell remembers taking it personally every time his quarterback went 
down. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt as if someone had insulted my family," he says. "I always went back and 
picked my quarterback up. I apologized to him. I felt like a pitcher giving up 
a home run." 
</P>
<P>
The Purple People Eaters were not the only celebrated defensive line to be tied 
into knots by the old Shell game. In the conference playoff game the day after 
Christmas in '76, it was the famous Pittsburgh Steel Curtain that the Raiders 
sent home in a barrel, 24-7. 
</P>
<P>
Offensive linemen usually get about as much publicity as chimney sweeps. They 
work in the engine room of sports. But Art Shell is going to make it with the 
glamour pusses. He will be inducted in the Pro Football Hall of Fame at Canton, 
Ohio, next month, the sixth Raider to be so honored. 
</P>
<P>
Since most of the other players in there are quarterbacks or receivers, it 
should be welcome news for them. Moreover, Stabler and Plunkett and Branch 
should feel safe in making it next, now that Shell -- Upshaw is already there 
-- will be there to protect them. If they make it, he laid the blocks to put 
them there. 
</P>
<P>
When he was general manager of the Colts, Don Klosterman used to like to say 
that his idea of a lineman was a guy who was "responsible for six headaches, 17 
nosebleeds, five limp-offs and three refused-to-return-to-the-games." 
</P>
<P>
It sounds like a perfect description of a Shell game.

KENYA'S KOECH SETS STEEPLECHASE RECORD: 8:05.35

Peter Koech of Kenya broke the world 3,000-meter steeplechase record at the DN 
Galan International Amateur Athletic Federation Mobil Grand Prix track and 
field meet. 
</P>
<P>
Koech, the runner-up in last year's Olympics, beat countryman Henry Rono's mark 
with a time of 8 minutes 5.35 seconds. Rono set the mark, one of the oldest in 
track and field, of 8:05.4 in Seattle 11 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Lewis also extended his long jump winning streak to 60. Lewis was trailing 
fellow American Larry Myricks going into his last attempt but soared 28 feet 0 
1/4 inch to win. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Conley was third at 26-4 1/4 and Mike Powell, the Olympic silver medalist, 
was fourth at 26-3. 
</P>
<P>
Koech, who had a 62.3-second last lap, took the lead with about 200 meters to 
go and outkicked fellow Kenyan Patrick Sang. 
</P>

Peter Koech of Kenya broke the world 3,000-meter steeplechase record at the DN 
Galan International Amateur Athletic Federation Mobil Grand Prix track and 
field meet. 
</P>
<P>
Koech, the runner-up in last year's Olympics, beat countryman Henry Rono's mark 
with a time of 8 minutes 5.35 seconds. Rono set the mark, one of the oldest in 
track and field, of 8:05.4 in Seattle 11 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Lewis also extended his long jump winning streak to 60. Lewis was trailing 
fellow American Larry Myricks going into his last attempt but soared 28 feet 0 
1/4 inch to win. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Conley was third at 26-4 1/4 and Mike Powell, the Olympic silver medalist, 
was fourth at 26-3. 
</P>
<P>
Koech, who had a 62.3-second last lap, took the lead with about 200 meters to 
go and outkicked fellow Kenyan Patrick Sang. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I could break the record if the conditions were right," said Koech, a 
31-year-old former National Collegiate Athletic Assn. champion from Washington 
State. 
</P>
<P>
Sang was clocked in 8:06.03, with Graeme Fell of Canada third in 8:15.95. Hagen 
Melzer of East Germany was fourth in 8:16.35 and Brian Diemer, the U.S. 
champion, was fifth in 8:16.92 in one of history's fastest 3,000-meter 
steeplechase. 
</P>
<P>
Arturo Barrios of Mexico won the 10,000 meters in 27:18.45, the fifth-fastest 
time in history. 
</P>
<P>
PattiSue Plumer was outkicked by East Germany's Kathrin Ullrich in the 5,000 
meters, but she cut nine seconds off Mary Slaney's U.S. record with a time of 
14:57.22, one second behind Ullrich. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first of Slaney's U.S. records to be broken. Slaney earlier held 
every U.S. mark from the 800 to the 10,000 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Rodion Gataullin upset fellow Soviet Sergei Bubka in the pole vault by clearing 
19-6 1/4.

SCHULER TO INTERVIEW FOR POST WITH CLIPPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Schuler, the National Basketball Assn. coach of the year in 1986-87 with 
the Portland Trail Blazers, is expected to come to Los Angeles later in the 
week to be interviewed for the vacant Clippers' position, team officials 
confirmed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
He would become the only person to meet with Clipper officials about the job 
besides Don Casey, the interim coach since Jan. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Schuler, who could not be reached for comment, spent 2 1/2 seasons with the 
Trail Blazers before being fired on Feb. 18. He joined Golden State as a scout 
for the final months of the season, and had a standing offer to join the 
Warriors as one of Don Nelson's assistant coaches for 1989-90 if he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
A former assistant under Nelson at Milwaukee and Larry Brown at New Jersey, 
Schuler became the ninth coach in NBA history to win 100 games in his first two 
seasons, guiding the Trail Blazers to a 102-62 record (a 62.2 winning 
percentage). But on-going reports of friction with players, especially star 
Clyde Drexler, led to his firing. SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER

Carlos Monzon, former middleweight champion, was convicted of homicide in the 
February 1988 death of his longtime companion, Alicia Muniz. 
</P>
<P>
Monzon, 47, was sentenced to 11 years in prison and ordered to pay court costs 
and $25,000 to Muniz's family. He won the middleweight title on May 7, 1970, 
from Italy's Nino Benvenuti, and defended it 14 times before retiring in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
An appeal is possible to the Supreme Court of Buenos Aires Province. Monzon,

The National Collegiate Athletic Assn. cleared Texas A&amp;M's football program 
of allegations that former player George Smith received "hush money," saying it 
could not distinguish fact from fiction. 
</P>
<P>
"The available information did not support that funds were provided to Mr. 
Smith in order to discourage the young man from reporting information to the 
NCAA," David Berst, the NCAA's assistant executive director of enforcement, 
said in a letter to school President William H. Mobley. 
</P>
<P>
Smith had told the Dallas Morning News in separate interviews that Jackie 
Sherrill, former football coach and athletic director, paid him $4,400 for his 
silence about NCAA rules violations and that a university official later 
offered $30,000 if Smith would recant his charges. Smith later said he had made 
up the story to help sell a book, then denied that statement.

NEWSWIRE: ASSISTANT AYERS PROMOTED TO HEAD POST AT OHIO STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ohio State University ended a three-week search Monday by making assistant 
Randy Ayers head basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
Ayers replaces Gary Williams, who left last month to become coach at Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas Coach Nolan Richardson had been the front-runner for the job after Jim 
Crews of Evansville and Lon Kruger of Kansas State withdrew from contention 
Friday. But Richardson withdrew Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Ayers, 33, who had been an assistant to Williams since May 1987, has no head 
coaching experience but said he will base his coaching philosophy on bits and 
pieces taken from other coaches. He signed a five-year contract with a base 
salary of $75,000 for the first year.

JAPANESE VOTERS OUTRAGED OVER TAX ON GOODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
TOKYO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Voters in Tokyo, particularly women, have confirmed what Takeo Tanaka has been 
hearing at his children's apparel shop for the past three months. 
</P>
<P>
"This makes your stomach stand up and growl, doesn't it?" is the usual remark 
Tanaka says he hears from angry homemakers when he adds a new 3% consumption 
tax to the retail price of goods in his store in the Kameari section of Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers buying food in supermarkets, women paying the tax on doctor's fees for 
childbirth or abortion services and parents bearing heavier expenses for their 
children's education since the new levy was implemented April 1 -- all are 
expressing the same dissatisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time that ordinary Japanese feel their daily expenses rising, they 
have seen revelations that their politicians are fattening their own 
pocketbooks, often with windfall tax-exempt stock profits, as in the Recruit 
Co. influence-buying scandal. What was seen by many as yet another example of 
high living by a politician -- Prime Minister Sosuke Uno's purchase of the 
services of a geisha four years ago -- generated even more anger against the 
ruling Liberal Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Explosive Resentment 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, resentment against the conservatives who have ruled Japan since 1955 
has reached a scale seldom seen. 
</P>
<P>
It exploded in Tokyo on Sunday as voters slashed the ruling party's holdings in 
the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly, the prefecture's legislative body, leaving it 
with barely one-third of the 128 seats. The voter turnout was 5% greater among 
women than men, and 17 of 33 women candidates were elected. 
</P>
<P>
Political experts, who said before the election that women were the most 
enraged by the consumption tax, expect a similar result in urban areas when a 
crucial election is held for the upper house of Parliament July 23. 
</P>
<P>
Even before allegations of Uno's extramarital affairs emerged two days after he 
took office, local governments, with the support of local Liberal Democrats, 
had rebelled against the consumption tax. Fearing the voters' wrath, 24 of 47 
prefectural (state) governments refused to add the 3% tax to public utilities 
and other fees related to daily necessities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wisdom Questioned 
</P>
<P>
Resentment of the tax continues to grow. As a reform package containing the 
consumption tax was being debated in Parliament last fall, opinion polls found 
65% of voters opposed to it. After the Liberal Democrats steamrollered it into 
law, 82% expressed unhappiness. And now that it has been implemented, 95% 
declare discontent, with 65% demanding repeal. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost no one supports it," conceded Takashi Kon of the Liberal Democrats' 
headquarters election measures committee. Even the ruling party is "unhappy 
with the Finance Ministry," he said before the Tokyo election, adding: "Finance 
Ministry bureaucrats just said, 'We'll use it (revenue from the tax) wisely.' 
Without knowing how it will be used, how can the people believe it will be used 
wisely?" 
</P>
<P>
Shigeru Aoki, a member of Parliament who heads the tiny New Salaryman's Party, 
said that taxpayers "see no clear purpose for the tax. If they did, they 
wouldn't resent it so much." 
</P>
<P>
"Voter sentiment right now is 'Let's cauterize them!' " Kon said of his own 
party's public standing before the Tokyo vote. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers have focused their wrath on a set of new inequities, irrationalities 
and idiosyncrasies created by the consumption tax, Japan's first. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Finance Ministry had argued that the reforms would restore 
fairness and balance to Japan's tax system, the ministry's own employees' 
restaurant wound up increasing the price of coffee but retaining the old price 
of tea. Coffee drinkers pay more than 3% extra to subsidize tea drinkers, who 
pay no tax at all. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, longer-distance subway riders are now paying up to 14% extra, while 
short-distance riders still pay the old fares, with no tax added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lightweight Coins 
</P>
<P>
Such anomalies occurred as part of desperate attempts to avoid dealing in 
change involving 1-yen coins. Hardly anyone carries the coins, and they don't 
work in vending machines. The coins, made of aluminum and so light they float 
on water, are worth only seven-tenths of a penny. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the uniform tax rate is hitting hardest those who can least afford 
it. More than 8.3 million pensioners, many of whom live on monthly allowances 
of only $930, for example, now have to pay more for food and rent. 
</P>
<P>
Government authorities have been trying to win acceptance of the consumption 
tax by pointing out that excise taxes were abolished as part of the reform 
package. 
</P>
<P>
"But housewives resent seeing diamonds and cars getting cheaper while daily 
necessities get more expensive," Tanaka said. 
</P>
<P>
Other shopkeepers also are upset. Although Tanaka said he must pay the 
consumption tax to his wholesalers as soon as he receives his goods, the 
wholesalers can earn interest on the tax collections for half a year before 
they have to pay them to the tax office. 
</P>
<P>
"The bigger you are, the more you benefit," Tanaka complained. "Both customers 
and we shopkeepers feel the tax reforms benefit only the rich." 
</P>
<P>
Reductions in corporate taxes, too, contrast with cuts in individual income 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Corporate Advantage? 
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party calculated that Japan's top 50 corporations would enjoy 
one-year tax cuts amounting to $2.4 billion. But in a mid-April opinion poll, 
71% of taxpayers said that, contrary to government claims, they did not feel 
their overall tax bill had been cut despite the reduction in income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The interest payments and capital gains of individual stockholders have lost 
tax-exempt status. But such unearned income is still taxed separately from 
earned income -- and at a low rate of 20%, Aoki pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
"No tax system in the world is as unfair to the salary earner as Japan's," he 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
About 180,000 religious organizations retain tax-exempt status, Aoki 
complained. But at the same time, he said, deductions permitted to salaried 
employees, whose taxes are taken out of wages, remain woefully inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the negative reaction appears to be occurring simply because the 
Japanese have never experienced a sales or consumption tax before. The old 
excise taxes were hidden in prices, and consumers never knew how much they were 
paying. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody ever protested the tax on beer (which is more than half the price) 
because it is included in the price on the bottle," Tanaka noted. "But when 
customers bring an item to the cash register and are asked to pay more than the 
price tag, they get mad." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confused Consumers 
</P>
<P>
Some shops have included the tax in their prices. Others have not. As a result, 
consumers often are confused as to how much tax they are paying, or even 
whether they are paying the tax. And when they do pay, Aoki added, they are not 
sure their money finds its way to the national treasury. 
</P>
<P>
Medium-size enterprises, with annual sales of $214,300 (30 million yen) to 
$357,100 (50 million yen), are only required to report their own sales invoices 
to tax authorities. With tax evasion known to be widespread among both 
wholesalers and retailers, how much of the tax that they collect from consumers 
actually goes into their own pockets is anyone's guess. 
</P>
<P>
Tanaka's children's apparel shop, like others with less than $214,300, or 30 
million yen, a year in sales, is exempt from the tax. But the exemption only 
means that his store is not required to take tax collections to tax 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"We still have to pay the tax -- on everything we buy from wholesalers," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet small shopkeepers also pocket a rake-off. The 3% tax Tanaka charges retail 
customers after his mark-up is the equivalent of only 2.4% of the extra amount 
he pays wholesalers. The difference, or 0.6% of the retail price, "I keep," 
Tanaka said. 
</P>
<P>
But he says the extra profit is not worth the extra trouble he has to go 
through because of the tax.

The silver-haired Morita, 68, however, continues as chairman of the company. 
Norio Ohga, 59, assumes the duties of chief executive and continues as 
president. 
</P>
<P>
Sony announced the executive changes after its annual meeting in Tokyo last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Morita has always been the guiding light of Sony, which he co-founded in 1946 
and built from a small transistor radio company into a worldwide company with 
annual revenue of $16 billion. He established Sony Corp. of America in New York 
in 1960 and became chief executive -- a position unfamiliar to Japanese 
companies -- of the parent company 13 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But recently, Morita, who also is vice chairman of Keidaren, the Japanese 
Federation of Economic Organizations, has been devoting much of his time and 
effort to issues relating to U.S.-Japan relations and trade friction. 
</P>
<P>
"It's rather a mistake for people to think that Mr. Morita is retiring from 
this world," said Chris Wada, senior vice president for governmental affairs at 
Sony Corp. of America. "Rather the opposite is true, he will spend more time on 
U.S.-Japan relations." 
</P>
<P>
In disclosing the executive changes, Sony also announced the election of the 
first foreign members to Sony's board of directors: Michael Schulhof, vice 
chairman of Sony Corp. of America in New York, and Jack Schmuckli, president of 
Sony Europe. In other appointments, Ken Iwaki, 52, and Nobuo Kanoi, 58, were 
both promoted to the posts of deputy president from senior managing directors 
at Sony Corp. in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Ohga is Morita's handpicked successor. The two met more than 35 years ago when 
Ohga, then a student of opera at the Tokyo Institute of Arts, wrote letters to 
Sony complaining about the sound of the company's tape recorders. Ohga signed 
on as a consultant to Sony before he went off to study voice in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Ohga sang opera baritone for the NHK network symphony orchestra before joining 
Sony in 1959. He worked his way through the ranks from the tape recorder 
division to head the CBS-Sony joint venture in 1968 to produce and market 
records in Japan. During his 14-year tenure as president of the joint venture, 
it became Japan's No. 1 recording business and he learned American-style 
cost-management. 
</P>
<P>
He was named president of the parent company in 1982 and has been credited with 
installing a system of profit centers to reign in Sony's freewheeling 
management style. Ohga played a major role in Sony's recent purchase of the 
CBS' U.S. record business and is now chairman of CBS Records Inc., another unit 
of Sony. 
</P>
<P>
Morita built Sony on a reputation of innovation and quality. He delivered a 
series of new consumer electronics, including transistor radios, Walkman radio 
and audio cassette player, the Trinitron TV system, Beta videocassette 
recorders, compact disc players and Watchman portable TVs. Sony's nonconsumer 
business includes broadcast equipment, floppy disks, disk drives and 
semiconductors. 
</P>
<P>
Morita was the first Japanese manufacturer to establish a plant in the United 
States when Sony opened a TV production facility in San Diego in 1972.

TILTROTOR AIRCRAFT MAY SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF CONGESTION AT CIVILIAN AIRPORTS.

<P>
A scene from the year 2000: 
</P>
<P>
 The strange-looking craft sits on a slab the size of a small parking lot as 
passengers file out of the adjacent Amtrak station in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 When all 75 are aboard, the 6,000-horsepower engines on each wing tip begin 
driving a pair of propellers, 38 feet in diameter and pointed straight up. 
</P>
<P>
 The giant blades spin faster and faster, and the craft slowly lifts like a 
helicopter until it hangs in the sky above the vertiport. Then the engine pods 
smoothly rotate 90 degrees, aiming the propellers forward like those on a 
fixed-wing plane, and the craft begins picking up horizontal speed. In less 
than a minute, it is flying north at 300 miles an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Ninety minutes later, the "Sacramento Shuttle" completes its flight as it 
settles to the ground at another downtown vertiport, this one only blocks from 
the state Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
That futuristic scene may seem farfetched. 
</P>
<P>
But it should not, because the prototype of an aircraft that blends the speed 
of an airplane with the agility of a helicopter exists today in the Marine 
Corps' V-22 Osprey. And although the so-called tiltrotor was designed to 
shuttle combat troops rather than commuters, transportation experts predict 
that it could one day revolutionize commercial air travel, particularly in 
packed population centers along the East and West coasts. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the solutions to air travel and crowded airports and skies in Southern 
California are to be found in new technology, like the tiltrotor," said Gary L. 
Proctor, a longtime member of the Orange County Airport Commission. "I think 
the bottom line has to be technology. There is just no land to build new 
airports. There is less and less open space." 
</P>
<P>
The V-22 flew for the first time last March at Bell Helicopter Textron's Flight 
Research Center in Arlington, Tex. It stayed aloft for 15 minutes as scheduled, 
and spectators marveled at its stability and quietness. Built jointly by Bell 
and Boeing Helicopters, it is designed to go as fast as 350 m.p.h., as high as 
30,000 feet and as far as 600 miles -- fully loaded -- without refueling. 
</P>
<P>
But while the flight in March was hailed as a significant step for aviation, 
the tiltrotor's development -- already eight months behind schedule -- was 
recently thrown into doubt. In a belt-tightening move, Defense Secretary Dick 
Cheney this spring cut it from the proposed 1990 defense budget. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the House Armed Services Committee argued for two days before 
restoring $157 million for the tiltrotor by taking money from the B-2 stealth 
bomber program. But the $295-billion defense appropriations package must now be 
approved by the full House, where debate is tentatively set to begin July 24. 
</P>
<P>
To get the first half-dozen training and testing craft from drawing board to 
runway, the government already has spent nearly $1.8 billion. But the program 
calls for spending about $26 billion more for 657 tiltrotors, of which 552 
would go to the Marines. Eventually, each craft is expected to carry a price 
tag of between $20 million and $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
Unless the new vehicle gains support in Congress, said John Zuk, chief of civil 
technology at NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif., the cut 
could prove fatal to the civilian -- as well as military -- tiltrotor program. 
</P>
<P>
"In the United States, nearly all revolutionary aircraft have been developed by 
the military," said Zuk, who has been involved in the non-military research and 
development of tiltrotor technology for 11 years. "Unlike most other countries, 
the United States does not subsidize development by commercial aircraft 
manufacturers. I'm certainly not advocating subsidies, but research and 
development of aircraft is very expensive." 
</P>
<P>
Zuk said the helicopter, the jet engine and jet transports were all developed 
by the military, and some experts question whether they would now be in use if 
the research and testing had not been publicly underwritten. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when America is struggling to improve its balance of trade, Zuk said, 
it would be "a shame" if the United States loses its edge in tiltrotor 
development or has to share the technology with another country. 
</P>
<P>
Bell President Leonard M. Horner told aerospace writers at the Paris Air Show 
recently that he would get the V-22 built even if he had to go to France for 
financing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Noise Level Lower 
</P>
<P>
"The Wright brothers came here after they couldn't sell their airplane in the 
United States and started the whole thing. People forget that," Horner said at 
the briefing at Paris' Le Bourget Airport. But Horner told reporters that he 
was moderately optimistic that Congress would put the tiltrotor program back in 
the budget. 
</P>
<P>
Aviation engineers contend that the V-22 has much less noise impact than 
conventional military helicopters because most of its sounds can be confined to 
its takeoff and landing zones. When flying in its airplane mode, the craft is 
said to be quieter than the quietest commercial airliner in service today. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd hardly be able to hear it when it is flying forward. It kind of 
whispers," said Marine Corps Maj. Gen. Donald E. P. Miller, commanding general 
of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, which includes units at El Toro, Tustin and 
Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
For the Marines, the Osprey was designed to carry 24 combat-equipped troops. 
Had it been available in 1980, said Brig. Gen. Harry Blot, the Marines' V-22 
project manager, the craft might have altered the course of history: It is 
ideal for missions such as the attempt to rescue American hostages from Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the eight conventional helicopters used in that unsuccessful operation 
broke down and another crashed into a fixed-wing plane at a secret refueling 
point outside Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
"This is almost like it was made for Iran," Blot said, "as if somebody went out 
and said, 'Gee, what would I build to do Iran again?' " 
</P>
<P>
Which is exactly why the Air Force wants to buy 55 of them, said Air Force Lt. 
Col. John Creveling of the U.S. Special Operations Command. He said the V-22 
was the top priority for the joint military command because it needed an 
aircraft that could take off vertically and fly at high speed for special 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Reduce Traffic 
</P>
<P>
"That is what we do for a living," Creveling said, adding that the Osprey can 
fly higher, faster and farther than any military helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
Some civilian agencies, including the California Division of Aeronautics -- 
part of the State Department of Transportation -- and the Port Authority of New 
York and New Jersey, are looking at the Osprey and tiltrotor technology as a 
way of dealing with future congestion in the air and on the ground. Rather than 
moving all commercial airline passengers from centrally located airports, a 
smaller network of four-acre vertiports could be built to shuttle passengers 
from city to city or within a city. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers could also be transported by tiltrotor craft to larger airports for 
long-distance flights, thus reducing some of the vehicle traffic at main 
airports such as Los Angeles International and John Wayne in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Airport Commissioner Proctor, a private pilot, said the tiltrotor 
could succeed where the helicopter failed as a popular mode of transportation 
because it will be able to carry more people at higher speeds. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers also may feel more at ease while flying because the craft does not 
have to tilt forward to gain speed as a helicopter does. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the flying public will perceive this more as an airplane than a 
helicopter," said Ron Reber, manager of Bell Helicopter's tiltrotor program. 
"They will feel a little bit safer. I hate to say that in a negative way, but 
people see a helicopter, and it doesn't look like it will fly." 
</P>
<P>
In a study partially financed by the Transportation Department and the Federal 
Aviation Administration, officials in New York and New Jersey were told that, 
for a tiltrotor to be put into service in the Northeast Corridor, it must be 
"cost-effective, reliable and attractive to passengers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Search for New Site 
</P>
<P>
"I think if the tiltrotor is cost-effective, it will have a place in commercial 
air travel in the United States," said USAir pilot Capt. Skip Budny of Clinton, 
Pa., a former military helicopter pilot who is interested in the tiltrotor 
concept. He said the seat-per-mile cost of a tiltrotor flying from a downtown 
location in one city to a downtown location in another will have to be low 
enough to be competitive with flights from one big regional airport to another. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors in Orange County has appointed a committee to search 
for a new airport site that could relieve the growing congestion at John Wayne 
Airport. The Airport Site Coalition has until October to come up with a 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
For residents, it is often an emotional subject, according to one county 
official who said: "Airports are much like prisons; everyone wants them but not 
in their neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
V-22 
</P>
<P>
The V-22 Osprey, developed by Bell Helicopter Textron and Boeing Helicopter, is 
a tilt-rotor craft that takes off and lands like a helicopter but flies 
horizontally like an airplane at up to 350 mph. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commercial and Civilian Use 
</P>
<P>
Although the craft was developed for the Marine Corps, its use in commercial 
aviation could drastically reduce the amount of land required for new airports, 
especially in urban areas where open space is scarce. Building tops could be a 
common landing spot for commuters. The craft takes off like a helicopter and 
virtually turns into an airplane within a matter of seconds.

PURCHASERS' INDEX DROPS AGAIN IN JUNE; 
</P>
<P>
2ND STRAIGHT DIP SEEN AS SIGN OF CONTINUED COOLING OF ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In another sign of an economic slowdown, the nation's purchasing managers 
reported Monday that the U.S. manufacturing economy declined in June for the 
second straight month. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the monthly report by the National Assn. of Purchasing Management 
provided more evidence of an across-the-board economic slackening but not a 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
"It's telling us what we've already been sensing: that the economy has been 
growing less rapidly," said Robert Chandross, chief economist with Lloyds Bank 
PLC in New York. "But I don't think it is an indication that would signal we're 
in a recession." 
</P>
<P>
The purchasing managers' index slumped to 48.8% from 49.7% in May. The decline 
put the index at its lowest level since July, 1986, when it was 48%. The May 
decline was the first in 33 months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Orders Declined 
</P>
<P>
A reading above 50 indicates that the economy is generally expanding; below 50, 
that the economy is generally declining. The difference from 50 indicates the 
intensity of the change. 
</P>
<P>
Production by the nation's factories was the only indicator to increase, while 
new orders declined for the first time since May, 1986, and inventories also 
fell. Vendor deliveries were faster for the second month -- a sign of declining 
demand -- after 31 months in which they were reported slower. 
</P>
<P>
"The total economy continued down the path toward slower growth as it ended the 
second quarter," said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the Tempe, Ariz.-based trade 
group. 
</P>
<P>
"The best news is that inflation appears to be slowing at a faster pace than 
the overall economy," said Bretz, director of materials management at Pitney 
Bowes Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The purchasing managers' price index fell for the second consecutive month, to 
48.5%, down sharply from 57.6% in May and the lowest since it was 42.8% in 
April, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in 34 months that more purchasers reported price 
decreases than increases, indicating that inflation may be ebbing. 
</P>
<P>
While the purchasing report surveys only the manufacturing sector and gives 
equal weight to small and large firms, it is the first economic gauge released 
each month and generally receives wide attention as an early signal. 
</P>
<P>
The group's figures are compiled through a monthly survey of purchasing 
executives at more than 250 industrial companies. The report was released 
Monday morning for immediate use in a policy change from previous months when 
it was released on Friday and ordered held for publication until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The report follows economic news last month indicating further softness. 
</P>
<P>
Orders to factories for manufactured goods slumped 2.7% in May; the key index 
of leading economic indicators dropped 1.2%, its steepest decline since the 
October, 1987, stock market crash; durable goods orders plunged at the steepest 
rate in 10 months, and consumer spending also declined sharply. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts believe that the declines are consistent with the Federal 
Reserve's attempt to engineer a so-called soft landing with slower growth and 
less inflation that won't drive the economy into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
"We do expect to see a very slow economy in the next three quarters, but we do 
not expect to see a recession," said David Wyss, chief financial economist for 
DRI-McGraw-Hill Inc. in Lexington, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2% Growth Seen 
</P>
<P>
The purchasing management group said its overall index has averaged 51.4% for 
the first half of 1989 but 50.5% for the second quarter. It said the 
second-quarter figure indicates annual growth of about 2% in the gross national 
product, the value of all goods and services produced. 
</P>
<P>
The group said the index would have to fall below 44% before signaling a 
decline in the inflation-adjusted GNP. 
</P>
<P>
New orders declined in June after 48 months of expansion, falling to 47.2% from 
53.4% in May. It was the indicator's lowest level since 47.2% in September, 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
Production, though, expanded in June for the 35th straight month, rising to 
52.4% from 51.1% in May. Inventories were 49.7%, the nearest level to growth 
since last December's 50.8%. The group's inventories index was 41.9% in May. 
</P>
<P>
The group said 65% of members that use steel plan to increase inventories to 
guard against possible production slowdowns when labor contracts expire at some 
mills July 31.

Minnetonka Stock Falls: The price of Minnetonka Corp.'s shares fell sharply 
amid disappointment that no third party would emerge to challenge 
Chesebrough-Pond's Inc.'s $376.2-million offer for the perfume manufacturer. 
Minnetonka, a Bloomington, Minn.-based company that makes Calvin Klein 
fragrances, agreed to be acquired by Chesebrough-Pond's, a unit of Anglo-Dutch 
consumer goods conglomerate Unilver PLC. Minnetonka slumped $2.625, or 10.5% of 
its value, to close at $22.375 in heavy over-the-counter trading of more than 1 
million shares.

IBM INCREASES PRODUCTION OF VITAL 4-MEGABIT MEMORY CHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
International Business Machines Corp. on Monday stepped up production here of a 
new four-megabit memory chip critical to the development of the computer 
giant's most sophisticated products. 
</P>
<P>
The Sindelfingen plant, about 15 miles west of Stuttgart, is only the second 
plant in the world that will mass produce the complex semiconductors for IBM. 
</P>
<P>
Production-line manufacturing began in Burlington, Vt., "a few months ago," and 
another IBM manufacturing plant is scheduled to open in Yasu, Japan, later this 
year, according to Peter W. Thonis, a spokesman at IBM's Armonk, N.Y., 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Leadership Position' 
</P>
<P>
It had been widely assumed that Japan was leading in the battle to gain early 
dominance in production of the four-megabit chip, but industry analysts and IBM 
note that the U.S. company has been producing the chip in volume for the past 
few months. 
</P>
<P>
"We have leadership position," Thonis said. 
</P>
<P>
The four-megabit chip, which can store 4 million bits of information, or about 
200 typewritten pages, is considered a vital element of virtually all of the 
advanced consumer-product and defense technology of tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
"Production of this four-megabit computer chip signals without a doubt a 
powerful new phase (in computer) development," said West German Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl, who attended the Sindelfingen plant opening. 
</P>
<P>
According to Helmut Roeder, a Stuttgart-based IBM spokesman, the company 
succeeded in producing the first four-megabit memory chip from a 200-millimeter 
silicon wafer. He said the new chip will allow increased computer memory while 
keeping down costs. 
</P>
<P>
"This can be used for all types of computers," he said. "With a larger wafer, 
it is cheaper and you have a much higher production output. The objective was 
to reduce the cost of memory." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sensitive Procedures 
</P>
<P>
Roeder did not say precisely what kind of savings could be expected from 
production of the new chip, but he noted that IBM would not be selling the new 
chip to other computer producers. 
</P>
<P>
"We are planning to use this new chip generation in our own products," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other companies have been unable to produce a four-megabit chip from larger 
silicon wafers because of the sensitive production procedures required, Roeder 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, he said, it will take about eight weeks before the first chip of this 
nature is completed at the Sindelfingen plant. 
</P>
<P>
"This process is very difficult. No one else has been in the position to handle 
it correctly and economically," he said. "There are so many processes, so many 
control mechanisms to make sure each step is correct. That's why it takes two 
months."

Japan Plans Big Loan to Mexico: Japan will pledge a $2-billion loan to Mexico 
in line with a multinational debt-relief program set forth by U.S. Treasury 
Secretary Nicolas F. Brady, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported. The loan will 
be issued to back up a $4-billion credit to be extended jointly by the 
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, the newspaper said. Mexico, 
with external debt estimated at $100 billion, will be the first indebted nation 
to receive aid under the Brady plan. Japan also will offer a substantial loan 
to the Philippines, whose external debt is estimated at about $28 billion, the 
newspaper said.

STOCK PRICES RISE IN 2ND QUARTER FOR MOST FIRMS IN VALLEY AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Stock prices for most San Fernando Valley-area companies rose during the second 
quarter, following the broader increase in the overall stock market. 
</P>
<P>
Out of 59 major publicly held companies in the area, 35, or 59%, saw their 
stock prices rise in the three months that ended last Friday. Twenty-one stocks 
appreciated 10% or more. 
</P>
<P>
There were 23 stock losers, and one was unchanged. Stocks in the group include 
those with headquarters from Glendale to Camarillo that traded for at least $2 
a share at the start of the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The quarter was marked by a strong surge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, 
the most widely followed stock indicator. The average, despite tumbling 91.81 
points last week, gained more than 146 points, or 6.4%, in the quarter to close 
at 2,440.06. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Biggest Winner 
</P>
<P>
The biggest winner in the quarter was Judy's. The Van Nuys clothing chain's 
stock more than doubled in the quarter, rising from $2.50 a share to $5.38, 
nearly all of it in June. Last week, the company disclosed that it is talking 
to an unidentified clothing concern that has offered to pay at least $6.71 a 
share, or $31 million, for the company. 
</P>
<P>
Sierracin's stock rose 81%, from $7.75 a share to $14. A group led by Chairman 
Christoph Tribull last month offered about $30 million, or $15 a share, for the 
50% of the Sylmar aerospace firm that the group does not already own. 
</P>
<P>
The price per share of Nu-Med, an Encino hospital chain, rose 51% to $7.75 from 
$5.13. In May, the company finished selling three of its health-care service 
subsidiaries to a Beverly Hills investment group. Nu-Med has indicated in 
Securities and Exchange Commission filings that it will receive about $45 
million. 
</P>
<P>
However, Nu-Med announced Friday that it had scrapped a separate plan to sell 
four hospitals to a newly formed company for $210 million in cash and 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Computer Software 
</P>
<P>
Software Toolworks, a Chatsworth developer of computer software, rose 42%, from 
$6.88 a share to $9.75. In May, the company reported that its earnings in the 
fourth quarter, which ended March 31, soared to $676,000 from $37,000 a year 
earlier as sales more than tripled to $4.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
In entertainment, Walt Disney's stock rose 21%, from $78.50 a share to $94.63. 
The Burbank entertainment giant continues to benefit from strong performances 
at its theme parks. In addition, Disney has two films that are emerging as 
summer hits, "Dead Poets Society" starring Robin Williams, and "Honey, I Shrunk 
the Kids." 
</P>
<P>
MCA, the Universal City entertainment conglomerate, saw its stock rise 9%, from 
$52.75 a share to $57.38. The company for several years has been the subject of 
takeover rumors. MCA's current films include the hit "Field of Dreams," 
released by its Universal unit. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest loser in the area was Tekelec, whose stock fell 39%, from $14 a 
share to $8.50. In May, the Calabasas company, which makes equipment that tests 
telecommunications products, said domestic orders for its equipment were lower 
than expected. 
</P>
<P>
Another once-hot company, Micropolis, saw its stock fall 23% to $5 a share from 
$6.50. The Chatsworth disk-drive maker has been hurt by a product glut in the 
industry. With its stock lagging the past few months, Micropolis earlier this 
year adopted an anti-takeover shield. 
</P>
<P>
House of Fabrics, a Sherman Oaks chain of fabric stores that has previously 
been the subject of buyout rumors, saw its stock drop 19% in the quarter to 
$19.13 a share from $23.75. 
</P>
<P>
Dataproducts, one of the area's biggest winners in the first quarter, gave back 
21% of its price in the second quarter, with the stock dropping from $16.75 a 
share to $13.25. 
</P>
<P>
The company's stock price climbed earlier this year after a New York investment 
group in December disclosed that it wants to acquire the Woodland Hills 
computer printer maker and is willing to pay $15 a share for it. Dataproducts 
has said it will consider offers from other potential suitors, but there have 
been few new developments in recent weeks.

We must count the three weeks of nonviolence in Tian An Men Square as a triumph 
in the evolution of human society. The students set a record -- organizing 
their large numbers into a community, claiming that square as "a holy land for 
democracy" and living in it as free men and women for three weeks. A new, 
hopeful generation tested whether peaceful means -- reasoning, singing, 
"parading," fasting, the posting of "big words" -- could accomplish a good, 
peaceful end: transforming China into a country to live in freely.

The students' ideas of freedom burgeoned from the conditions of their daily 
lives. They live six, eight, 10 to a room; they are outdoors studying at 
daybreak for light to read by; they do not have enough electricity and food. In 
another, "segregated" part of the dormitory, foreign students on larger 
stipends live two to a room, and will leave soon for the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese students have abided by the tradition that one must make sacrifices for 
the family and also for guests and for the greater good. They agree to major in 
fields of study which the elders deem indispensable to society. (I met graduate 
students in English who have to write their thesis on some seemingly irrelevant 
author such as Thackeray or one of the Sitwells.) They have to look forward to 
being assigned a job at graduation and sent to a part of the country that needs 
their skills. By law, they cannot marry until their mid-20s, and then spouses 
are separated by work assignments. 
</P>
<P>
There are many short stories about idealistic doctors, women who sacrifice 
everything -- family life, money, health, status -- to toil as the lowliest 
workers in the hospital's hierarchy. I hear the young people's longings for 
freedom in the rumors that they can't help repeating. There's one about a 
swimmer who was picked out of her cradle by Olympic scouts, taken from her 
family and trained like the opera stars of old. "She was lucky enough to get 
into an accident that ruined her swimming career," they say to one another. 
"She's free to do something else with her life." 
</P>
<P>
Families make large sacrifices, such as aborting female fetuses and forgoing 
sons for the sake of population control. And on top of the life or death 
hardships, many small deprivations cumulate. After the Cultural Revolution, no 
sooner were pet birds and kung fu allowed back in the parks and streets, but 
pet dogs and cats were banned from the cities. I saw a bicycle tip over and a 
puppy jump out of the basket; the crowd laughed, watching its owner try to 
catch his dog before he himself got caught by a policeman. That dog was like a 
farmer from the countryside trying to sneak into Beijing without a permit. I 
knew that a new friend trusted me when she told me that she had two pet cats 
hidden in her apartment. Most people follow rules that are good for them. On No 
Smoking Day, I saw only one man -- a rebellious type with a mustache -- light 
up. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Crisis of Belief' 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, I was among a group of American writers invited to Canton 
University. Our meetings with students were canceled because "no one will take 
responsibility for you." A British teacher invited us to her apartment, where 
half a dozen students came two nights in a row. They confessed to a "crisis of 
belief"; they spoke ashamedly, as though the loss of trust in the government 
were their own shortcoming. The specific freedom they spoke about most was the 
freedom to make friends. Because of "rumormongering," a boy and a girl cannot 
become friends; nobody can trust anybody else. 
</P>
<P>
They admitted to having read "Love Must Not Be Forgotten" by Zhang Jie. It is a 
controversial story about undeclared love. Though Canton University (or perhaps 
the Communist Party of Canton, according to rumor) had canceled Allen 
Ginsberg's public reading, his reputation and his poetry fascinated people. He 
was asked to stay another six weeks teaching at various schools. His students 
were daring to consider sexual freedom and whether the freedom to speak wildly 
and to love openly "spiritually polluted" this veteran of bohemianism -- and 
themselves for listening. 
</P>
<P>
I did not want to think that all the many regulations, for which I could very 
well see the justifications, added up to a society that let no part of 
anybody's life alone. The last straw was the schools and hotels putting on 
disco dances and authorities trying to control them. Why do they have to 
regulate this frivolous activity, too? On another trip in the spring of last 
year, our group of Americans tried to get into a dance, but was turned away at 
the door. The officials asked us to come back the next night to the foreigners' 
dance. My son said that without our group, he and I, looking as Chinese as the 
next person, could have gotten in. But we would have had to unknot and unwind 
red tape and know the right people. 
</P>
<P>
Even professionals from the West who are temporarily working in China are 
supposed to "socialize with one's own work unit." To take an outsider to a 
party, one has to make applications and get permits. At the foreigners' dance, 
we watched as Chinese students were turned away. Then, a few weeks after we got 
home, Beijing students rioted against African students, who brought to a dance 
townies, or, according to rumors, prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Question of Character 
</P>
<P>
During the past year, the students changed character. Perhaps some of the very 
students who went on the racist rampage changed their ways, defining higher 
principles and how to act on them. At a dozen colleges throughout the United 
States, Chinese students asked me, "What is the essential Chinese character? 
What is essentially Chinese? What is the essence of being Chinese?" One young 
man said that deep inside, he felt a Chinese to be somehow weak. As a motherly 
woman who has Confucian responsibilities, I told him that forbearance and 
endurance are strengths; the willingness to make sacrifices is a strength. To 
have the imagination and practicality to try the craziest social experiments is 
a strength. 
</P>
<P>
Twice I listened to young women wondering whether the Chinese language has a 
word like the English word privacy. To carry out the one-child policy, there 
are charts on walls listing every woman in the village and the dates of her 
periods and her use of birth control. In the cities, waiting lists for housing 
are years long, and young couples and their one child share a one-room 
apartment with parents and grandparents. These women were searching for a word 
to help legitimize their self-interest. The only term they came up with was a 
legalistic one, "right to privacy." 
</P>
<P>
A survey says that 76% of the 40,000 Chinese students in the United States, 
most of them graduate students, want to stay. I questioned some of them about 
brain-draining China. A smart freshman answered, "If I leave here, I'd be 
draining the American brain." Like many others, she asked me about the '60s in 
America. (That period in China was the start of the Cultural Revolution.) 
Wasn't it a time when people passively sat like Thoreau at Walden Pond? I told 
her that not so much "Walden" but "Civil Disobedience" had been our field 
guide. 
</P>
<P>
As if my counseling had political effect, days later -- ideas change, grow and 
spread in moments -- I saw on TV among the walkie-talkies, floppy disks and fax 
paper being packed for the protesters at Tian An Men Square a two-inch-thick 
Xeroxed volume with the title "Manual for Nonviolent Action." Orville Schell, 
who just returned from China, reports that students discussed with him Martin 
Luther King Jr. on civil rights and Satyagraha. I loved hearing "We Shall 
Overcome" again, sung by the students in Hong Kong. Later in San Francisco at 
memorial services for "the martyrs for democracy," we sang "We Shall Overcome" 
with a new verse, "China Will Be Free." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Culture Bound' 
</P>
<P>
I was in Boston when the students there heard that the ones in China declared 
that they would fast and sit-in and "parade" and give out flowers until June 
20, the date the People's Congress met. Some graduate students in anthropology 
on their way to hear Liu Binyan, dissident journalist and author of "Man or 
Monster," wondered about freedoms being "culture bound." 
</P>
<P>
Marx and Lenin were Europeans, yet China's communism is its own. Freedom is a 
universal human want that takes forms peculiar to nations. A free press in 
China would simply and practically allow the people to tell the bureaucratic 
leaders about their hardships and to give suggestions for improvement. The 
government ought to have set up hot lines earlier, and for a better purpose 
than citizens informing on one another. 
</P>
<P>
An important meaning of the Communist Revolution was women's liberation -- 
unbinding feet, ending slavery, the right to choose one's husband. Just so, 
free speech will be a Chinese freedom -- the freedom to make friends, the 
freedom to declare love, the freedom to dance with whomever you please. 
"Democracy" is shorthand for freedoms that are specific and heart-deep. 
</P>
<P>
Too bad "democracy" is a word too closely associated with "capitalism" and 
"anti-communism." After the first breathtaking view of "The Goddess of 
Freedom," I worried that it was the wrong symbol. Chinese call the Statue of 
Liberty "The Goddess of Freedom." Their Goddess of Freedom had a stance of her 
own and the students sang "The Internationale" when they unveiled her; they 
were trying to integrate two political systems that have divided the world this 
century. (A Statue of Liberty continues to stand in Canton; she had been built 
with contributions from cities and towns all over North America and the Pacific 
to honor 72 martyrs of the 1911 Revolution.) A world at peace is a vision so 
rare, its symbols have hardly been invented. 
</P>
<P>
The students did the right thing, dismantling guns and pouring the gasoline out 
of the Molotov cocktails. And holding up their fingers in the 1960s V-for-peace 
sign. And sitting beside a flower in front of the row of seated soldiers. And 
wearing a slogan painted in red on the back of one's jacket -- in the 
4,355-year-old tradition Gen. Yue Fei the Patriot, whose parents dedicated him 
to China by cutting vows on his back. (The two consulate members who defected 
in San Francisco did so during the week of the dragon boat races, a festival 
honoring Chu Ping, a courtier who was banished in about 300 BC for protesting 
the emperor's war plans.) And walking up to the tanks with nothing but one's 
life and ideas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nonviolence Amid Tumult 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the students performed nonviolence in the midst of tumult. 
Before their sit-in, riots broke out in Xian, where 130 policemen and uncounted 
others were hurt. During the sit-in and hunger strike, a teacher at Cornell 
showed me a letter from China; a student had been killed, and many students 
beaten. It would have been best for the practitioners of nonviolence to have 
waited for a lull in events when their purity of motive would be obvious. But 
that may be an impossible circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
The three weeks of nonviolence inside that square was itself to have been an 
example of how the government and the workers, unionists, unemployed could 
negotiate differences, how the elders could make changes without resorting to 
yet another revolutionary civil war. Chai Ling, the 22-year-old woman student 
who was "Supreme Commander of the Defense of Tian An Men," said after the 
massacre, "Ours was a struggle between love and hate. Our objective was to make 
a peaceful petition, and our chosen method would peacefully achieve this. It 
wouldn't be a battle of weapons because we were making a peaceful petition." 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese in the United States are devising inventive political actions in 
response to the massacre of June 3-4. They are interviewing witnesses to 
document what they saw happen. They are starting a newsletter and a video and 
preparing a presentation to the U.N. They are jamming the informers' hot lines 
while speaking and arguing with the operators and reporting Li Peng as a 
criminal. They are sending news and encouragement via fax and posting 
announcements and exchanging thoughts on computer bulletin boards. They are 
nominating Chai Ling for the Nobel Peace Prize. 
</P>
<P>
With its genius for community, San Francisco's Chinatown has organized the 
Foundation for Chinese Democracy, 1118 Grant Ave., 101, San Francisco 94133, to 
raise and distribute funds and to coordinate and support "activities and 
programs that promote Democracy and Democratic Rights for ALL Chinese." The 
immediate aims are to lobby for work permits, and for liberalization of the J-1 
visa so that students would not have to go home for their two-year residency. 
At a safer time, there will be more direct nonviolent help for the students in 
China. 
</P>
<P>
Describing the young man who danced in front of the tanks, and stopped them for 
minutes, novelist Betty Bao Lord, wife of former Ambassador to China Winston 
Lord, said, "His ancestors are with him." Yue Fei the Patriot and Chu Ping of 
the Dragon Boat Races are his ancestors. His ancestors are also Thoreau, Gandhi 
and Martin Luther King Jr. His relatives were with him, too, and they include 
all of us on whose behalf he was braving a way of peace. 
</P>
<P>
The students at Tian An Men (the Gate of Heavenly Peace) -- our children -- are 
the latest evolution of human kind toward being a peaceful species. In China 
and in every country we will have to repeat the nonviolence that those students 
accomplished until we establish peace, until we establish love.

For some, it's found in antiquarian bookstores or atop a nearby hill with a 
view. For others, it's at the beach, in their home, at mom's house, in a 
concert hall or even at the movies. 
</P>
<P>
Wherever it is, prominent and busy Los Angeles personalities say they've 
learned fast to find their own special corners of quiet in the world. 
</P>
<P>
There they can make their getaway fast, without having to endure the troubles 
of traveling to distant, exotic spots. 
</P>
<P>
Just where and what do Los Angeles' celebrities do to get far from the madding 
crowd, while still staying close by? Here are their secrets: 
</P>
<P>
Tom Bradley 
</P>
<P>
Mayor of Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
"When I do find time, I try to make it to a cultural activity of some kind. I'm 
a great lover of jazz. I go to a great variety of cultural activities, whether 
they are at the Hollywood Bowl or the Music Center, or at the Henry Fonda 
Theatre here in town. 
</P>
<P>
"The emotional juices begin to flow when you see great artists performing. 
There is always a great variety of emotional responses that flow: love, 
excitement, happiness. And I love this kind of experience. It is truly relaxing 
and a perfect getaway that eases stress." 
</P>

"Escape? I don't use that word. I tend to be realistic. But there is a hideaway 
. . . a place where I can close off the world. I have a favorite bookstore, 
Dutton's in North Hollywood. I wish I could live in one of their back rooms. 
It's not a current bookstore, mind you. Not a Crown or B. Dalton's. It's an 
antiquarian bookstore. You feel as though you have stepped back into 
13th-Century England. These places are very quiet and very musty . . . they are 
kind of anachronisms. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I go into the back in one of the cubbyholes . . . books are stacked from the 
floor to the ceiling and it smells like the scent of someone's closet. Some of 
the spines have been torn on some of the books; some of them are water-stained 
and some mildewed. But there are times you find such treasures. It's quiet and 
away from the crowds. 
</P>
<P>
"People are usually staring at you wondering whether or not they have seen you 
on TV. They can hardly recognize me when I'm in my book mode. And I just love 
to read. It's another means of vegetation for me. I could spend an entire day 
on the floor and walk out feeling totally refreshed. It's a wonderful restful 
thing for me to do in contrast to the fast-changing business of news." 
</P>
<P>
T.C. Boyle 
</P>
<P>
Novelist, winner of the PEN-Faulkner award 
</P>
<P>
"My previous favorite place was right off the coast of Malibu, where I would 
take my 40-pound ocean kayak and have a great time. But since those two UCLA 
students were eaten by the great white shark, I won't be in the ocean with my 
kayak any longer. I haven't been yet, but I'll probably begin kayaking on Lake 
Castaic. 
</P>
<P>
"What I do now to kind of get away from the rest of the world is take 
Mulholland Drive all the way up to where it turns into a dirt road, right in 
back of Serrenia Avenue Park. It's a horse trail. I walk in the valleys of the 
mountains and see everything fall before me right down to the ocean. If I'm 
really lazy, I can take Stunt Road, which goes off of Mulholland and drive up 
to a spot. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see all of the valley from the right side of your car and all the way 
out to Catalina on your left. You can pull out three cans of beer and two 
sandwiches and that's just great. It's really great to get away from the 
confusion of the city, if just for a little while." 
</P>
<P>
Dick Zanuck 
</P>
<P>
Producer: "Jaws I &amp; II," "Cocoon," "The Sting," now on location in Atlanta 
for "Driving Miss Daisy" 
</P>
<P>
"I do Catalina. I have a small boat that I keep down at Newport Beach. I take 
that over to Catalina. We just lay around on the boat and do a little fishing 
and just relax and get some sun. I have a speedboat and sometimes we go 
water-skiing. I actually mill around at some of the local places. We go to the 
Catalina Country Club and all along the strip. 
</P>
<P>
"But I spend most of my time on the boat, right on the water. The waves hit the 
boat, and you smell the salt breeze. And fishing is the best relaxer of all. 
That really takes the stress off work . . . always being on location for some 
picture. Being able to just be in one place is truly relaxing." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Pryor 
</P>
<P>
Actor-comedian 
</P>
<P>
"When I go through the gates of my home in Beverly Hills and the security 
guards are all there, I feel safe. . . . I think it's paranoia mostly, but with 
every thing happening out there, the shootings, what's been going on on the 
freeways. It's great to feel safe. I love it. My friend comes over, my cook is 
there. We all have a good time. 
</P>
<P>
"When I do go out, I like to go to the movies. In fact, I want to see 'Batman.' 
I don't know if it's an escape . . . you can see a movie just about anywhere. 
Movies are entertaining and fun. Like with 'Field of Dreams,' it was great that 
I could watch the movie and believe it. They went in and pulled it off and made 
it work. That's the kind of thing that I like to see . . . when they make the 
unbelievable, believable. 
</P>
<P>
Bree Walker 
</P>
<P>
KCBS anchor and reporter 
</P>
<P>
"I hang out at a ranch in Calabasas. It's called Fleetwood Farms. I take 
lessons every Saturday, hunter-jumper activity on English saddle. Most of the 
equestrian arts require total concentration. And that is always a respite from 
my work pressures. 
</P>
<P>
"I have great trainers, Thea and Maura Nielsen -- Leslie Nielsen's daughters. 
They have a horse named Ozzie, who is a dream, a thoroughbred dark bay gelding 
and a show jumper. He is such a gentleman. He gives a very classy ride. The 
three times I feel completely connected in body and soul are when I'm mothering 
my 10 1/2-month-old daughter, Andrea; anchoring the news; and riding Ozzie." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Cooper 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Lakers guard 
</P>
<P>
"The only resort is at my mom's house in Northridge. Out there, no one really 
knows who I am. I just love home. There's just such a homey feeling that I get 
when I'm there. 
</P>
<P>
"It's peaceful and quiet and my brother Mickey lives there, so I get to talk to 
him on many different things. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to talk about everything except basketball, because I try to get away 
from the rigors of the court. Sometimes we play backgammon and checkers, and 
mom will cook. It's home, what else can I say?" 
</P>
<P>
Fred Hayman 
</P>
<P>
Owner, Fred Hayman, Beverly Hills; creator of Giorgio and 2-7-3 fragrances 
</P>
<P>
"My great escape is my beach house on the top of the Malibu cliffs (at Point 
Dume). I love to spend time with my family and my dogs there. I really enjoy 
spending quiet evenings at home. We have a private walk to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
"My next door neighbor is Johnny Carson. What I really like to do is to have 
parties. We eat and drink and we are merry; we go for walks and we play tennis. 
</P>
<P>
"My favorite restaurant is La Scala in Malibu. It's an Italian restaurant that 
my good friend Jean Leon owns. The food is sooo good. A full stomach and a walk 
on the beach . . . who could beat that?" 
</P>
<P>
John Wooden 
</P>
<P>
Former UCLA basketball coach 
</P>
<P>
"Before I lost my wife 4 1/2 years ago, we used to like to go to Lawrence 
Welk's Welcome Inn down by Escondido. It's a retirement type of village with 
mobile homes, but there is a big lodge. It was quiet, but very dark and the 
stars were so clear and bright it was like you could almost touch them. You 
could hear the frogs and crickets and there was no television. That was really 
a treat. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, since I travel a great deal on speaking engagements, my escape, so to 
speak, is my 4-mile walk through Balboa Park. It's absolutely refreshing. I get 
ideas for writing. (I'm writing a book now you know.) With the flowers and the 
birds chirping and the trees and the sky. 
</P>
<P>
"I have always been interested in poetry and writing poems. So I'm placed in 
this tranquil setting with nature. Sometimes I'll walk through the park and 
there are youngsters playing soccer, and then other times, there are older 
people. Oftentimes the ducks will be flying south or flying north and I'll see 
hundreds of them at a time. The sunrise is probably the most breathtaking event 
of the morning. That is the perfect quiet time, being alone. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Evans 
</P>
<P>
Olympic gold medalist 
</P>
<P>
"I love to shop. And I love to shop at South Coast Plaza by the beach over in 
Costa Mesa. There are hundreds of stores and I can buy so many new things. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, shopping is very hectic. But the best part about it is when you find 
something you really like, and you take it home and wear it that very night. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually I take a friend or go with my mom; sometimes I help her pick out 
clothes to wear. The day is never done without a visit to Mrs. Field's for a 
chocolate chip cookie." 
</P>
<P>
Ole Henriksen 
</P>
<P>
Ole Henriksen Skin Care 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a beach lover. I just want to have my feet in the sand, literally right up 
to my ankles. The water is so relaxing on my feet as the waves come up on the 
sand. 
</P>
<P>
"I take a picnic down to Laguna Beach to be with just me and the ocean. What I 
do is drive to Newport Beach and stay at Le Meridien Hotel there because it's 
cheaper. My brother and his girl are in from Denmark. And we will be spending 
much time together at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't get drunk because in Laguna you get big tickets if you are on the 
beach with alcohol. I just sit there drinking mineral water and being a good 
kid under the umbrella, of course. 
</P>
<P>
"No glaring sun for me, I'm big on protection. I use my SPF 26 and then I relax 
in the ocean breeze. It is so much fun. It is the best getaway that I can think 
of, and it's one I do quite often." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Dees 
</P>
<P>
Morning disc jockey, KIIS-FM 
</P>
<P>
"I have the perfect place. I like to hang out where I can get a little sand 
between my toes and people don't have to wear clothes. Just kidding. 
</P>
<P>
"Seriously, I like to go to the La Quinta resort in La Quinta next to Palm 
Desert. It's about 115 degrees and there is no one there. The rooms are about 
$10 a night and I can act like I own the place because no one is there. . . . 
Especially in the summertime. That's the only time of year that no one thinks 
about going to the desert. It's so deserted. I don't have to talk. Which is 
something I usually have to do all of the time. 
</P>
<P>
"The resort was built in 1926 by some friends of Dwight Eisenhower, and at one 
time it was known as the Western White House. It's only about 75 miles out of 
L.A.-proper. 
</P>
<P>
"To beat the heat, I soak a T-shirt in water and after a while it evaporates. 
It feels cool and refreshing. But that feeling hits me the second I get there. 
I always feel like taking a real long, deep breath and that just spells 
relaxation." 
</P>
<P>
Ann Cole 
</P>
<P>
Cole of California swimwear 
</P>
<P>
"I get as far away from the phone as possible, because if you stayed near the 
phone, you'd never get any rest. For people in my business, where travel is a 
part of everyday life, you really appreciate the quiet time of just being in 
your own home. The biggest luxury is to stay home. It sounds really corny, but 
it's so relaxing." 
</P>
<P>
David Hinkley 
</P>
<P>
Western regional director, Amnesty International USA 
</P>
<P>
"Me and my family are fond of cultural experiences. We go to places like 
Hancock Park and the the Page Museum and the L.A. County Museum of Art. The 
kids love the dinosaurs . . . we all love the beautiful paintings. . . . The 
park is just a place where people from all over the world will congregate, 
maybe just to picnic. Olvera Street is another favorite. We think that it's a 
rich environment and we want the children to see that we live in a 
multicultural place. . . . We don't want them to lose their sense of being part 
of a larger world . . . one that isn't revolved around one race, one ethnicity 
or one culture." 
</P>
<P>
Stan Herman 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills real estate broker 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, the city has changed so much in the past 20 or 30 years with 
the traffic and the influx of people. My great escape has become Malibu. 
Through my gates there is the ocean . . . my Shangri-La. The noise just 
dissipates. It is called being reborn. Some people seek out religion and 
sanctuaries of some kind. I find the ocean and the sand to have a very 
tranquilizing effect."

CRITIC AT LARGE: A RETURN HOME FINDS AN EXTENDED FAMILY STILL IN EXISTENCE

HAMMONDSPORT, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What Thomas Wolfe meant, obviously, is that you can't go home again and stay. 
You can always go home again on a visit, squinting at passers-by in the hope of 
sighting a familiar face, searching amid the changes for any surviving traces 
of your past, feeling at last, it may be, only like a stranger in a strangely 
familiar yet foreign land. 
</P>
<P>
It was more than 40 years ago that I left Hammondsport for good, and despite 
many a summer visit over the years I ought by rights to feel myself something 
of a visitor, anxious all too soon to say goodby again to my ghosts and be on 
my way, leaving town and traveler to get on with their lives. 
</P>
<P>
But it's never been like that. I always leave reluctantly, as I did the first 
time, and with the suspicion that I am nuts not to stick around, at least until 
the first snow. 
</P>
<P>
After a dry winter it has been a wet spring here. Lake Keuka is high. The trees 
and the lawns and the hills are a soft and astonishing green. The grapes are 
already heavy with growth. There has been rain during the visit, the gentle, 
straight-falling rain that soaks in and does not turn the gullies into brown 
torrents. 
</P>
<P>
Two or three times a day, rain or shine, Stanley Clark's 400-passenger Keuka 
Maid, its nonfunctional but decorative red paddle wheels now in place, thrums 
down the lake, horn tooting, bell clanging. On its evening cruise, it is lit up 
like an arcade and the sounds of live music drift across the water. 
</P>
<P>
In its partial first season last year, Clark told me, the Keuka Maid carried 
27,000 passengers. It will do many more than that this year. There is a wedding 
on board almost every summer Saturday morning, and the weekend dance nights are 
jammed. The rock and country rock groups are very popular, the big band sounds 
are less so, which is a disappointment to Clark, he said. That is his era, and 
mine. 
</P>
<P>
I've thought a lot about Hammondsport over the years, wondering whether it was 
unique or whether only my own nostalgia made it seem so. 
</P>
<P>
In the '30s and '40s the town felt to me like a very extended family, in which 
almost everyone knew almost everybody else, and had for years. The past was a 
strongly felt presence; it was somehow just around the corner on the next 
street. 
</P>
<P>
You lived with a strong feeling of community and of continuity, and there was 
as well a sense of self-sufficiency; everything, even the telephone company, 
was locally owned. 
</P>
<P>
The telephone company is no longer a local institution; there is in fact no 
telephone person in town anymore, only a building in which clicking noises can 
be heard, and the local ghosts include Nan Wright and Laura Bailey and the 
other operators who used to say "Number" when you picked up the receiver. 
</P>
<P>
The local wineries, briefly owned by Coca-Cola and then by Seagrams, have been 
bought out by a management group, Vintners International, and their fiscal 
destiny is still shaped in New York. But they are operated by the local chief 
executive, a lawyer named Mike Doyle who has survived three ownerships, owns 
the house Fred Taylor of Taylor Wine built and clips his own hedges. 
</P>
<P>
Doyle has made the cellars, as they're called, feel like local enterprises 
again. Times are not easy; the brands suffered from unbenign promotional 
neglect, but sales are rising again and so is optimism. 
</P>
<P>
The smaller wineries -- Walter Taylor's Bully Hill, Peter Johnston's Heron Hill 
and the others -- appear to be prospering, and attendance at the Glenn H. 
Curtiss Museum of Local History is running ahead of last year. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest employer in town is Mercury Aircraft, started in 1920 to make spare 
parts for the Curtiss Jennies that were barnstorming all over the country. And 
Mercury is still privately, locally owned, a big help to that sense of 
self-sufficiency. 
</P>
<P>
Hammondsport has I think never looked prettier. The village square has a thick 
carpet of grass, which could never be made to grow in my day. The gingerbread 
bandstand (built in 1892 at a cost of less than $400) is in fine repair, 
waiting to be put to more than decorative use. There are trees and flower boxes 
everywhere in the village, and nearly all the storefronts are trimly painted. 
</P>
<P>
I'm still not used to the video rental store where Jim Smellie's pharmacy was, 
nor the handsome new building of the volunteer ambulance corps where Johnny 
Frisk's barbershop and Athan Carrasas' Keuka Restaurant used to be, but they do 
symbolize progress rather than decay. 
</P>
<P>
Progress, as always, fetches problems along with it. There is an acrimonious 
debate as to whether to build a lot of condominiums or a state boat launch down 
at the lake front, and I judge that the prevailing local sentiment is to do 
neither and leave the scenery just as it is. I wish I were more confident the 
sentiment would prevail. 
</P>
<P>
They say lakeshore property now goes for as much as $2,500 a foot; a year-round 
cottage just sold for nearly $500,000 and the quadrupling of assessments and 
therefore of taxes has drawn cries of pain and outrage. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing stays still, of course, but if you are lucky the changes are positive. 
(Decay is its own kind of change.) It is hard to be sure on short 
reacquaintance, but it seemed to me that Hammondsport continues to enjoy a 
strong sense of community, despite all the tendencies toward alienation and 
dispossession in the larger society. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer, whom I've never met but who lives in the house my great-grandfather 
built, heard I was in town and left word at the museum that if I wanted to come 
wander through the house again for old times' sake I was more than welcome. 
</P>
<P>
I wasn't able to -- or I guess, more accurately, I was afraid the visit would 
be fraught with more memories than I could handle. But I was very touched by 
his thoughtfulness, and it seemed to me to prove that the feeling of the town 
as an extended family had survived all the dispiriting changes of a 
half-century. 
</P>
<P>
I've been amazed how many familiar faces there've been to see and greet. The 
tradition of continuity appears to continue as well, although among my 
contemporaries there also appears to be a mass exodus to Florida along about 
Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Thomas Wolfe, I think a man can home again -- to Hammondsport, at 
least. There is only one problem, which did not enter into Wolfe's thinking. If 
the prices keep rising, I'm not sure I would be able to afford it.

Ahmed Khomeini, the son of Iran's late ruler, indicated he is not running for 
president, virtually ensuring that Speaker of Parliament Hashemi Rafsanjani 
will win the post. In a letter to Parliament, Khomeini said he needs time to 
recover from the death of his father a month ago before considering his 
political future, according to Tehran Radio. Khomeini, known to have had 
presidential ambitions, was the only person seen able to pose a serious 
challenge to Rafsanjani in the July 28 election. In his letter, Khomeini 
reaffirmed his backing for senior leaders, including President Ali Khamenei.

Novelist Mario Vargas Llosa said he is resuming his bid to become president of 
Peru, which is struggling with economic chaos and a growing leftist insurgency. 
Public opinion polls showed Vargas Llosa favored by 44% of the voters, more 
than double the figure for his principal rival, Alfonso Barrantes, a Marxist 
and former mayor of Lima, the capital. Earlier, Vargas Llosa had withdrawn from 
the race because of squabbling between the two parties of a center-right 
coalition that nominated him for president. The parties settled their dispute 
over the weekend.

Ireland's Parliament decided to give caretaker Prime Minister Charles Haughey 
until Thursday for another attempt to form a government, raising the likelihood 
that his failure to do so could result in another snap election. Haughey told 
Parliament: "I do not regard a general election as the solution to our present 
difficulties. . . . It would be a Doomsday solution." The biggest stumbling 
block in forming a new government is Haughey's refusal to consider sharing 
power in a coalition, even after last month's inconclusive general election 
left him worse off than before. Haughey was forced to resign last Thursday 
after failing to be reelected as prime minister for the fourth time.

About 400 residents of a Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood in San Francisco 
formed a human chain and sang and prayed along six blocks that have been the 
scene of drug-dealing and violence. Church women in white lace gloves joined 
hands and sang with children, parents and grandparents in what organizers 
called an affirmation of faith in the young people of the troubled 
neighborhood.

The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the circumstances of a 
near collision of a Continental Airlines jet and a small plane near Orange 
County's John Wayne Airport. The jetliner, with 132 passengers aboard, swerved 
to avoid the small aircraft, which apparently crossed into its flight path 
moments after takeoff, said Jack Doyle, an FAA regional duty officer. 
Continental Flight 176 came within 100 feet of the single-engine Bonanza, which 
had just taken off from an adjacent runway. Doyle said the pilot of the small 
plane was told by air traffic controllers to turn left after takeoff, but 
instead turned right, crossing the Boeing 737 jetliner's flight path. The pilot 
of the airliner had to turn to avoid hitting the smaller plane, Doyle said.

Prosecutors may seek felony charges against Rep. Donald E. (Buz) Lukens 
(R-Ohio) if he successfully appeals a misdemeanor conviction of having sex with 
a 16-year-old girl, the prosecutor's office said. The charges would stem from 
accusations that Lukens had sex with the same girl when she was 13, said a 
spokesman for Franklin County Prosecutor Michael Miller. Lukens, 58, was 
sentenced Friday to 30 days in jail and fined $500 on a charge of contributing 
to the unruliness of a minor. He is free on bond. A Franklin County jury 
convicted Lukens on May 26, after hearing Rosie Coffman testify that Lukens 
paid her $40 and gave her gifts after having sex with her at his Columbus, 
Ohio, apartment last November.

The space shuttle Columbia rolled closer to the launching pad and its secret 
mission for the Pentagon. Hours before dawn, workers at Kennedy Space Center in 
Florida towed America's oldest orbiter into the huge Vehicle Assembly Building 
from a hangar where it has spent most of the last 3 1/2 years. Workers were to 
attach the fuel tank and twin booster rockets that will propel Columbia into 
space on its first mission since Jan. 10, 1986 -- the last flight before the 
Challenger disaster grounded the fleet. The shuttle is scheduled to make its 
eight-hour, four-mile crawl to the Kennedy Space Center launching pad Sunday.

 -- The fact that she is only 3 feet, 4 inches tall is not Angela Muir van 
Etten's biggest problem. Rather "the No. 1 problem is the limiting attitudes 
that average-sized people have," says Van Etten, 35, a New Zealand-born lawyer 
who lives with her American husband, Robert, 39, in Rochester, N.Y. He is the 
same height. She tells of interviewers who do not take her job applications 
seriously, people who will look anywhere but at her, as well as those who 
cannot stop staring. Such incidents were part of the reason she wrote "Dwarfs 
Don't Live in Doll Houses." In the autobiographical book, self-published 14 
months ago (available by mail order from Adaptive Living; P.O. Box 60857; 
Rochester, N.Y. 14606), Van Etten uses examples from her own life -- including 
elevator buttons that cannot be reached and receptionists who do not realize 
there is a customer standing just below the level of the counter top -- to 
raise awareness about how to bring up disabled children and how to treat adults 
who are short of stature. She has sold about 1,200 copies. Van Etten and her 
husband are among about 1,000 participants at the national conference of the 
Little People of America Inc. in Baltimore. Robert Van Etten, an engineer, is 
past president of the group, while his wife is past president of Little People 
of New Zealand. -- Britain's Prince Charles has been selected by Italy's 
Spoleto cultural festival to receive a $715,000 prize -- not for his own 
amateur artworks but because he is "a high international personality who has 
for some time shown, in various ways, love and respect for the riches of art 
and nature of Spoleto" and central Italy, festival officials said. British 
Ambassador Sir Derek Thomas said Charles would use the money to start a fund to 
provide an annual prize for a promising young Italian musician.

SOME RELIGIOUS DISPLAYS OKD BY HIGH COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Supreme Court, continuing to fuzz the line at which religious displays 
cross the boundary between church and state, ruled Monday that local 
governments may not support displays that appear designed to promote certain 
faiths but that they may sponsor religious symbols as part of broad holiday 
celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
On a 5-4 vote, the court said that a prominent display of a Christian nativity 
scene inside a county courthouse in Pittsburgh was unconstitutional because it 
had the "effect of promoting or endorsing religious beliefs." 
</P>
<P>
But the court, with three liberal justices dissenting, also agreed to permit a 
Hanukkah menorah on the front steps of another Pittsburgh government building 
because the overall display, which included a Christmas tree and a sign 
saluting American liberty, simply recognized "different traditions for 
celebrating the winter-holiday season." 
</P>
<P>
Justice Harry A. Blackmun, writing for the narrow majority that struck down 
Allegheny County's Christian creche depicting the birth of Christ, said that 
the nativity scene violated the constitutional separation of church and state. 
"Nothing in the context of the display detracts from the creche's religious 
message," Blackmun held. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Blackmun argued that the display of a large menorah, a 
nine-branched candelabra used during the celebration of the Jewish holiday 
Hanukkah, may be acceptable because, "in this particular context, the menorah's 
display does not have an effect of endorsing religious faith." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Unjustified Hostility' 
</P>
<P>
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote the minority's opinion, which blasted the 
court's majority for an "Orwellian rewriting of history" that "reflects an 
unjustified hostility toward religion." He was joined by Chief Justice William 
H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White and Antonin Scalia. 
</P>
<P>
The full outcome appeared to satisfy only two of the justices, Blackmun and 
Sandra Day O'Connor. O'Connor wrote in a separate opinion that the display 
including the menorah along with a Christmas tree and a sign saluting liberty 
was acceptable because it "sends a message of pluralism and freedom to choose 
one's own beliefs." 
</P>
<P>
Three of the liberal justices who helped form the majority that struck down the 
creche contended that the menorah display also should have been ruled 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
Justice William J. Brennan Jr. argued that both displays contained a strong 
religious message. "I cannot agree," Brennan wrote, "that the city's display of 
a 45-foot Christmas tree and an 18-foot menorah . . . shows no favoritism 
towards Christianity, Judaism, or both." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Explains Various Views 
</P>
<P>
Blackmun, in announcing the decision, acknowledged that "the court is 
fractured." After explaining the views of the various factions, he said: "I 
hope that's correct. It reminds me of the vendors at the ballpark selling 
programs listing the names of all the players." 
</P>
<P>
Religious leaders were sharply divided over the court's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God for the Supreme Court," said Charles Saul, a Pittsburgh attorney 
representing the Jewish group that owned the menorah. "The court is saying that 
when you put a menorah and a Christmas tree and those kinds of things together, 
that all faiths are welcome." 
</P>
<P>
The court's ruling also satisfied John V. Stevens, a Seventh-day Adventist 
Church official in Westlake Village, Calif., who said that the decision makes 
it clear that a specifically religious holiday display by itself violates the 
church-state separation principles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prefers Secular Symbols 
</P>
<P>
"If the creche stands alone, the (religious) message is too strong," said 
Stevens, who is also president of the non-sectarian Council on Religious 
Freedom. He added, however, that he would prefer to see only secular Christmas 
symbols, such as trees and Santa Clauses, in government-sponsored displays. 
</P>
<P>
But the American Jewish Committee, which opposed both displays, expressed 
disappointment over the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm gratified the court struck down the creche and distressed it did not also 
strike down the menorah," said Samuel Rabinove, the Jewish Committee's legal 
director. "Neither belongs in public spaces. There are plenty of private places 
for them." 
</P>
<P>
The court's decision to permit a Jewish menorah to be part of a larger civic 
display was similar to recent court rulings in California that allowed the 
Hanukkah symbol to coexist with a Christmas tree in Los Angeles City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's high court "vindicated our position," said Rabbi Shlomo Cunin, 
West Coast director of the Chabad Lubavitch movement in Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Relies on 1984 Decision 
</P>
<P>
Monday's Supreme Court ruling, handed down along with the eagerly awaited 
abortion decision on the final day of the court's 1988-1989 session, relied 
heavily on a 1984 decision in which the court upheld the constitutionality of a 
creche in Pawtucket, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to that creche, which was surrounded by secular symbols such as 
Santa Claus, reindeer and snowmen, the Pittsburgh nativity scene was displayed 
by itself. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department lawyers had urged the court to allow both Pittsburgh 
displays, arguing that "use of the creche as a symbol of the holiday does not 
constitute a government endorsement of the religious content of that symbol" 
and contending that government "is not required to surround it with candy 
canes, reindeer or other purely secular symbols." 
</P>
<P>
Blackmun acknowledged in his decision that the 1984 ruling, written by former 
Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, was "none too clear." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Calls Context Important 
</P>
<P>
But Blackmun's new guidelines may not help much in sorting out the confusion. 
"The government's use of religious symbolism is unconstitutional if it has the 
effect of endorsing religious beliefs," he wrote, "and the effect of the 
government's use of religious symbolism depends upon its context." 
</P>
<P>
Blackmun's opinion in the case (Allegheny County vs. Greater Pittsburgh ACLU, 
87-2050) was joined by O'Connor, Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and John Paul 
Stevens.

BRUSH FIRE DESTROYS 10 HOMES IN PUENTE HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Fire, possibly started by an arsonist, raged out of control in the Puente Hills 
north of Whittier on Monday, destroying 10 homes, damaging at least three 
others and forcing the evacuation of hundreds of residents, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Hampered by high temperatures and unpredictable winds, more than 600 
firefighters battled to contain the blaze, which had charred 75 acres by early 
evening, Los Angeles County fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's burning like a maniac," was the way county Firefighter Bill Borthwick put 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a nightmare at the top of the hill," said horse trainer Jill Snyder, 18, 
of Hacienda Heights, as she led two horses and two goats to safety. "From the 
horse trail, you could see flames everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
County fire spokesman John Lenihan said arson investigators pinpointed where 
the fire started on the shoulder of Turnbull Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no reason for an area like that to be touched off," he said. "It's not 
an area where you would expect to have a fire ignite." 
</P>
<P>
A column of blue-black smoke, billowing hundreds of feet up from the blaze, was 
clearly visible from as far away as West Los Angeles and Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Officials closed a section of the Pomona Freeway between the San Gabriel River 
Freeway and 7th Street in Hacienda Heights because of the blaze, and traffic 
was virtually gridlocked on surface streets in the area, sheriff's deputies 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out shortly before 2 p.m. near Turnbull Canyon Road and Skyline 
Drive, a county fire spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 homes were evacuated as firefighting crews began cutting fire 
breaks near homes, preparing to make a stand against the flames that were 
hopscotching from ridge to ridge in the rugged, chaparral-covered canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Benton of Hacienda Heights said he spotted the fire shortly after it 
erupted. 
</P>
<P>
"It started as a small brush fire on the Whittier side of the ridge near 
Turnbull Canyon Road," he said. "All of a sudden, the wind caught it, and it 
was gone." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Water-Dropping Copters 
</P>
<P>
Two "strike teams" of five engine companies each responded to the original call 
at 1:43 p.m., officials said. Five more engine companies and five 
water-dropping helicopters were dispatched to the scene at 3 p.m. after winds 
picked up, firefighters said. 
</P>
<P>
By 5 p.m., more than 400 firefighters, including 14 hand crews cutting fire 
breaks in the brush, were battling the flames with the focus on saving homes. 
</P>
<P>
Two homes were destroyed on Skyline Drive near Turnbull Canyon Road. Residents 
on nearby Blue Sky Road refused to evacuate when deputies first told them to do 
so at 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"I am trying to save my house," said John Anderson, as he sprayed water on his 
wood shingle roof from a garden hose as the flames licked less than 50 yards 
away. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson tried to remain upbeat and joked about passing soft drinks to 
firefighters clearing a break behind his house. 
</P>
<P>
Chad Gonella said he was taking his girlfriend home when he spotted the smoke 
from the Pomona Freeway and knew it was in his neighborhood. He said sheriff's 
deputies "told me to leave, but I came back anyway. I ended up helping the Fire 
Department. They gave me a hose. The fire got pretty close for a while, but it 
looks as though I'm going to make it." 
</P>
<P>
By late afternoon, winds were blowing flames away from Blue Sky Road, where 
homes are valued at more than $700,000. But county Fire Capt. Mark Morgan said 
he was not sure the area was out of danger. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just trying to make sure the fire doesn't get to the houses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Firefighters Driven Back 
</P>
<P>
Just as two dozen firefighters reached the top of a ridge behind Blue Sky Road, 
a burst of flame ignited the brush, forcing them to scurry back to the canyon 
below, Morgan said. When the fire did not spread and it appeared safe, they 
returned to the ridge to cut breaks. 
</P>
<P>
The evacuees -- whose homes were in the vicinity of Turnbull Canyon Road and 
Blue Sky Road, Descending Drive, Edgeridge Drive, Skyline Drive and Las Tunas 
Drive -- were sent to nearby Los Altos High School, 15325 E. Los Robles Ave., 
county fire spokesman Joe Silva said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Red Cross is here and has 
</P>
<P>
set up an evacuation center," said Joyce Craig, assistant superintendent of the 
Los Altos School District. 
</P>
<P>
Residents, she said, "are kind of checking in and checking out. It's like a 
message center right now. I don't think there are too many people there. They 
are leaving messages for each other -- saying, 'I'm OK' or 'I have gone to 
wherever." 
</P>
<P>
Craig said the Red Cross was "really rallying their volunteers to come over and 
man the station. They have their file system all organized. They're taking 
messages, and people are coming in." 
</P>
<P>
She said the residents sent down by the deputies seem to "be very much in 
control." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Concern on Their Faces' 
</P>
<P>
"They are concerned, and you can see that concern on their faces. But right now 
they're handling it," Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first major fire this area has had in a long time," she added. 
</P>
<P>
As firefighters focused attention on the Puente Hills, about 10 acres were 
burned in a blaze near the Griffith Park Observatory, Los Angeles fire 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire started at about 3:30 p.m. and was extinguished within an hour. One 
firefighter suffered minor injuries battling the blaze, whose cause is under 
investigation, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
No structures were threatened. 
</P>
<P>
An upper-level high pressure system over the desert Southwest was helping to 
create a dry, southwesterly flow of air over the Southland, sending 
temperatures into the 90s in many areas, including the Puente Hills. The Los 
Angeles Civic Center high reached 88 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service said little change is expected through midweek. 
The forecast calls for late-night through mid-morning low clouds and fog near 
the coast. Otherwise fair skies and continued hot days are expected through 
Wednesday, with highs ranging from 92 at the Civic Center to 104 in the 
valleys.

BRUSH FIRE DESTROYS 15 HOMES IN PUENTE HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A swirling brush fire, fed by erratic winds, raged out of control in the Puente 
Hills north of Whittier on Monday, destroying at least 15 homes, damaging 
several others and forcing the evacuation of hundreds of residents. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County fire officials said they would not know exactly how many 
structures had been destroyed or damaged until the blaze is brought under 
control and they could provide no estimate of when that might be. No serious 
injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
More than 970 firefighters -- initially hampered by high temperatures and 
unpredictable winds -- battled to contain the spectacular blaze, which had 
charred more than 1,500 acres by late Monday, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Nightmare' on the Hill 
</P>
<P>
"It's burning like a maniac," was the way county Firefighter Bill Borthwick put 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a nightmare at the top of the hill," said horse trainer Jill Snyder, 18, 
of Hacienda Heights, as she led two horses and two goats to safety. "From the 
horse trail, you could see flames everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
County fire spokesman John Lenihan said arson investigators pinpointed the area 
where the fire started shortly before 2 p.m. on the shoulder of Turnbull Canyon 
Road near Skyline Drive and burned toward homes in the Hacienda Heights area. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no reason for an area like that to be touched off," he said. "It's not 
an area where you would expect to have a fire ignite." 
</P>
<P>
About 250 families -- approximately 600 people -- were evacuated and sent to 
three centers, Lenihan said, adding that they would not be allowed back into 
their homes before this morning. 
</P>
<P>
As night fell, firefighters were letting the blaze burn unchecked toward a 
landfill in the Puente Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"In this case, the dump will be our friend," Lenihan said late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what catastrophe is like now," Roy Vann, 40, said Monday afternoon as 
he sprinkled water on his roof while flames advanced to within 150 feet of his 
home on Beech Hill Drive. "I thought I was going to lose my home." 
</P>
<P>
His home was spared as backfires crews had set steered the flames toward a 
ridge away from the street. 
</P>
<P>
The burned homes were scattered along the length of Turnbull Canyon, where 
houses valued as high as $1 million are secluded in heavily wooded areas, 
Lenihan said. Two of the homes destroyed were on Skyline Drive off Turnbull 
Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refused to Evacuate 
</P>
<P>
Even though their street was sandwiched between two walls of flame, residents 
on nearby Blue Sky Road refused to evacuate when deputies first told them to do 
so at 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"I am trying to save my house," said John Anderson, as he, too, sprayed water 
on his wood shingle roof from a garden hose as the flames licked fewer than 50 
yards away. The homeowner tried to remain upbeat and joked about passing soft 
drinks to firefighters clearing a break behind his house. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters and residents were hampered by low water pressure after pumps were 
knocked out by a power failure as the flames hopscotched from ridge to ridge in 
the rugged, chaparral-covered canyon, which officials said had not burned in 
more than 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the last stand of McGann," said Tim McGann as water barely trickled 
out of his garden hose. "I'm going to save the house, man." 
</P>
<P>
Behind him, fire crews worked furiously with axes and chain saws to cut a break 
in the heavy brush as flames leaped 50 feet into the air no more than 10 feet 
from his home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Winds Shifted 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for McGann, winds shifted and blew the flames away. 
</P>
<P>
Chad Gonella said he was taking his girlfriend home when he spotted the smoke 
from the Pomona Freeway and knew it was in his neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies "told me to leave," he said. "But I came back anyway. I 
ended up helping the Fire Department. They gave me a hose. The fire got pretty 
close for a while, but it looks as though I'm going to make it." 
</P>
<P>
Like other residents of Turnbull Canyon, evacuee Joyce White packed family 
photos, small mementos and other memorabilia into the trunk of her car. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't have a stitch of clothing, but at least we'll have these, our 
memories," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Griffin, who lives next door to the local fire station on Turnbull Canyon 
Road, said she was not worried about her home "at the moment. I hope they won't 
let it burn down." 
</P>
<P>
Looking up a ridge to where a neighbor was making a feeble attempt to water his 
roof with a garden hose fewer than 100 feet from the flames, she said: "You 
have to keep busy. He's just like me. I swept the porch. You do anything to 
keep your hands busy." 
</P>
<P>
Area resident Steve Benton said he spotted the fire shortly after it erupted. 
</P>
<P>
"It started as a small brush fire on the Whittier side of the ridge, near 
Turnbull Canyon Road," he said. "All of a sudden, the wind caught it, and it 
was gone." 
</P>
<P>
A column of blue-black smoke, billowing hundreds of feet up from the blaze, was 
clearly visible from as far away as West Los Angeles and Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Freeway Closed 
</P>
<P>
Officials closed a section of the Pomona Freeway between the San Gabriel River 
Freeway and 7th Street in Hacienda Heights because of the blaze, and traffic 
was virtually gridlocked on surface streets in the area, sheriff's deputies 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Two "strike teams" of five engine companies each responded to the original 
alarm at 1:43 p.m., officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Five more engine companies and five water-dropping helicopters were dispatched 
to the scene at 3 p.m. after the winds picked up, firefighters said. 
</P>
<P>
By nightfall, firefighters from 10 departments -- some from as far away as 
Orange County -- the U.S. Forest Service, were battling the flames with the 
focus on saving homes. 
</P>
<P>
As winds blew flames away from Blue Sky Road, county Fire Capt. Mark Morgan 
said he was not sure the area was out of danger. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just trying to make sure the fire doesn't get to the houses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scurried to Safety 
</P>
<P>
Just as two dozen firefighters reached the top of a ridge behind Blue Sky Road, 
a burst of flame ignited the brush, forcing them to scurry back to the canyon 
below, Morgan said. When the fire did not spread and it appeared safe, they 
returned to the ridge to cut breaks. 
</P>
<P>
Just as they crested the ridge a second time, "the fire just came around us and 
made a run on us," said firefighter Steve King. "We had to get out of there 
fast." 
</P>
<P>
Raleigh Ornelas spent the afternoon helping firefighters, using a 3,500-gallon 
water truck he owns. 
</P>
<P>
He said he arrived home on Orange Grove Drive at 1:30 p.m. and went to the fire 
station and volunteered. Fire officials sent him to Turnbull Canyon Road where 
he sprayed brush that caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
"You couldn't see nothing from both sides of the road," said Ornelas, 42, 
adding that he helped neighbors spray their roofs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my neighborhood," he said. "I just want to help somebody." 
</P>
<P>
The evacuees -- whose homes were in the vicinity of Turnbull Canyon Road and 
Blue Sky Road, Descending Drive, Edgeridge Drive, Skyline Drive and Las Tunas 
Drive -- were sent to nearby Los Altos High School, 15325 E. Los Robles Ave., 
St. John Vianney School at 1345 S. Turnbull Canyon Road and Wilson High School 
at 16455 E. Wedgeworth Drive, county fire spokesman Joe Silva said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Red Cross is here and has set up evacuation centers," Joyce Craig, 
assistant superintendent of the Los Altos School District, said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents, she said, "are kind of checking in and checking out. It's like a 
message center right now. I don't think there are too many people there. They 
are leaving messages for each other -- saying, 'I'm OK' or 'I have gone to 
wherever.' " 
</P>
<P>
Craig said the Red Cross was "really rallying their volunteers. . . . They have 
their file system all organized. They're taking messages, and people are coming 
in." 
</P>
<P>
She said the residents sent down by the deputies seem to "be very much in 
control." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Concern on Their Faces' 
</P>
<P>
"They are concerned, and you can see that concern on their faces. But right now 
they're handling it," Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
As firefighters focused attention on the Puente Hills, about 10 acres were 
burned in a blaze near the Griffith Park Observatory, Los Angeles fire 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire started about 3:30 p.m. and was extinguished within an hour. One 
firefighter suffered minor injuries battling the blaze, whose cause is under 
investigation, officials said.

<P>
No structures were threatened.

A PECULIAR MIX OF WORK AND PLAY MARKS SEMI-HOLIDAY CELEBRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The workaday world was presented with a dilemma Monday, the third of July. It 
was what some people were calling a "semi-holiday," an inconvenient lull 
between a weekend and the Fourth of July holiday, and it created a peculiar 
sort of day, part vacation, part work. 
</P>
<P>
Most businesses and government offices were open, but few seemed to function as 
they do most Mondays. From the commute to the volume of work, even to the way 
people were dressed, there was a different feel to the day. The freeways ran 
more smoothly, the workload was lighter, the pace more pacific, relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are working, true, but a lot of people took off," said David 
Venable, a peace officer for the city of Los Angeles. "It's not as hot, not as 
busy. It makes it a lot nicer to work. I love it." 
</P>
<P>
Like Christmas and Thanksgiving, the Fourth is one of a few nationally 
recognized holidays that cannot be rescheduled to create a three-day weekend. 
The third of July would just not seem right. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Friday that follows Thanksgiving, Monday was one of those days that, 
for many, spoils a long weekend. Others simply ignore the fact that it isn't 
really a legitimate holiday and enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
One of the earliest signs that something was different came at rush hour Monday 
morning. Freeway traffic was holiday-light, said those who monitor the jams and 
congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Ruiz, a deputy to City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, said he was able to 
whiz into work, from his home in Santa Monica, up the Santa Monica Freeway to a 
downtown Los Angeles City Hall parking lot in just 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the way you always dreamed it would be and never is, except during the 
Olympics and on holidays," Ruiz said. "There was absolutely no traffic." 
</P>
<P>
By mid-afternoon, heavier congestion was reported at some spots, especially 
along beach-bound thoroughfares. The beach, along with the malls and libraries, 
is where many of those who were able to duck work ended up. 
</P>
<P>
"Today is pretty much like a Sunday," said Lt. Warren Rigby of the county 
Lifeguard Service. 
</P>
<P>
He estimated that the crowd Monday on the county's central section beaches, 
from north of Marina del Rey to Topanga Canyon, at 200,000 people but predicted 
that number could more than double today. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are making a four-day weekend of it," Rigby said. 
</P>
<P>
Many private companies and manufacturing firms chose to give their employees 
Monday off, perhaps more out of pragmatism than generosity. 
</P>
<P>
"We have floating holidays, and so they figured this would be a good time to 
give us one," said Kevin Brosnihan, 27, an engineer with the El Segundo office 
of Rockwell International. "Probably no one would show up anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Brosnihan and a co-worker, Madelyn Netkovick, used the extra holiday to cruise 
on their racing bikes from Hermosa Beach to Marina del Rey, a trip they made in 
about an hour. The bike path was more crowded than on a normal weekday, they 
said, but nothing compared to a Sunday or a full-fledged holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the day's semi-holiday status, some office workers who did have to 
report were ambivalent about what to wear. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Casual Clothes 
</P>
<P>
At the Auto Dealer Center of First Los Angeles Bank, people were working 
normally but had been given the option to report in casual clothes. Many were 
dressed in T-shirts or sun dresses, and the boss, Assistant Vice President 
Gerald Hammen, fed them with pizzas as reward for having to work on a day that 
many others had free. 
</P>
<P>
"The pressure on us is greater today because we don't have tomorrow," said 
Hammen, dressed in an open-collar, cotton shirt with short sleeves that showed 
off 30-year-old Navy tattoos from his days in the service. 
</P>
<P>
Post office branches were open. Workers reported in the morning that patronage 
at window service was lighter than usual, but it picked up as the day wore on. 
Many restaurants and bars that cater to the corporate crowd were closed or 
stayed open only long enough to serve lunch. 
</P>
<P>
The county courts were open and running normally, according to a spokeswoman, 
as was the Pacific Stock Exchange -- though the trading volume was reported to 
be one of the smallest this year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fewer Calls 
</P>
<P>
At city halls in Los Angeles and in the suburbs, receptionists, secretaries and 
others were grateful for the reduced walk-in traffic and fewer phone calls -- 
though many calls were queries about whether offices were open. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice and quiet, and we're getting a lot done," said one secretary at 
Santa Monica City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
In West Hollywood, City Hall receptionist Brad Confer said offices were staffed 
at about half-force.

"We've got a skeleton crew today," he said. "Everyone's home sleeping in or out 
sunning themselves." 
</P>
<P>
In downtown Los Angeles, crowds had thinned out in City Hall's construction 
services office, where on normal days lines of people submitting plans or 
seeking permits usually wind past counters, down a long hall and out a door. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, you have to spend the whole day just to submit plans," Art Yanez, 
designer for a Tarzana architectural firm, said as he rolled up blueprints for 
a residential project. "Today, I've been here just an hour, and I'm almost 
ready." 
</P>
<P>
For one visiting Briton, the unofficial holiday Monday was a source of 
confusion. Terry Croft, a flight attendant for British Airways on a layover in 
Los Angeles, said he found some stores open, others closed, and he wondered 
just how many days it takes Americans to celebrate this holiday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Matter Debated 
</P>
<P>
"We were just debating whether we'd be busy (on the flight home) tomorrow, it 
being the Fourth," Croft said as he strolled down Santa Monica Pier. "I dare 
say we will." 
</P>
<P>
Since the first Fourth of July anniversary in 1777, roughly 30 have fallen on a 
Tuesday. Observance of some holidays, such as Veterans Day and Washington's 
Birthday, were switched to a predetermined Monday in legislation signed by 
President Lyndon Johnson in 1968. The law, designed to give Americans three-day 
weekends, went into effect in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Veterans Day, the change met with considerable opposition from 
veterans groups, which noted that the original date, Nov. 11, coincided with 
the signing of the armistice that ended World War I. After protests, the 
holiday was restored to Nov. 11.

SIERRA FERRY TAKES HIKERS HITHER TO YON

<TEXT>
<P>
When the ferryboat Sierra Queen was launched on this 7,327-foot-high lake in 
time for this Fourth of July holiday, weekend hikers in the High Sierra knew 
summer had finally arrived. 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Queen is one of the most remote ferries in the nation and caters 
almost exclusively to backpackers hiking the Mexico-to-Canada Pacific Crest 
Trail and the John Muir Trail. 
</P>
<P>
From now to the end of September, 3,000 to 4,000 hearty hikers in California's 
spectacular high country will have cruised across this three-mile-long lake on 
the 32-foot Sierra Queen. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly 70 years there has been ferry service for hikers on Florence Lake. 
There is also a store on the north shore in which to stock up on food and 
supplies and a place to camp nearby in Jackass Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
The steel-hulled Sierra Queen, which can carry 25 passengers, is the latest in 
a series of ferryboats on the lake since the 1920s. Built in 1963, the boat 
first operated for two years as a State of California buoy tender in San 
Francisco Bay before being brought up here. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Brought Up on Trailer 
</P>
<P>
Karl Smith bought the Sierra Queen for $5,000 in 1965 and trailered it up to 
the lake. He ran the Florence Lake store and ferry service from 1947 until he 
died in 1981. His widow, Adeline, now owns it. A daughter and son-in-law, Tom 
and Karla Hurley, manage the store and ferry. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's original 18 1/2-foot, 10-passenger ferryboat is a planter now standing 
on end in the Florence Lake store. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Morrison previously owned the ferryboat and store. For years he spent 
winters alone at Florence Lake handcrafting boats while snowed in for up to 
eight months at a stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Florence Lake is 100 miles northeast of Fresno, the last 21 miles a one-lane 
tortuous drive with scores of blind corners that winds up and down steep 
mountain slopes. 
</P>
<P>
Rearing up majestically from the south shore of Florence Lake is 11,200-foot 
Mt. Shinn. The lake is embraced by glacier-carved peaks, many crowned with snow 
year round, and by the John Muir Wilderness. It's one of the few places in the 
High Sierra where backpackers on the Pacific Crest and John Muir trails have an 
opportunity to pick up food and supplies. 
</P>
<P>
There are, however, no phones to the outside. The nearest telephone is 10 miles 
from the lake. Many of the backpackers have been on the trail 10 days to two 
weeks without any contact with the outside world by the time they arrive at 
Florence Lake. 
</P>
<P>
The two-mile ride on the ferryboat takes 20 minutes and costs $4.75. 
"Backpackers are always a happy bunch, so excited to be in this marvelous 
pristine country away from the crowds and the cities and towns down below," 
said Pat Ferris, skipper of the Sierra Queen. She said she has yet to run 
across a grump on the boat. 
</P>
<P>
What do the backpackers say they crave most as they sail across the lake to the 
store on the other side, Ferris was asked. "Ice cream. They know or have heard 
the store has several different flavors of ice cream cones available. They 
really wolf up the ice cream."

SATURN SPECTACULAR LEAVES ASTRONOMERS IN A HEAVENLY STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DYE, Times Science Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saturn sailed across the heavens with a diamond in its rings Monday morning, 
dazzling mortals on a distant planet. 
</P>
<P>
Witnessing the event were thousands of amateur and professional astronomers who 
traveled to the high country throughout the Southwest so they could take part 
in a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
And Saturn, one of the most popular objects in the sky because of its 
spectacular rings, did not let them down. 
</P>
<P>
Standing out in brilliant contrast against a black, moonless sky, the 
second-largest planet in the solar system passed in front of a bright star late 
Sunday night and early Monday morning. That happens so rarely that it drew the 
undivided attention of many of the largest telescopes in the West, from Chile 
to Arizona to Hawaii to California. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Saturn Owned the Skies 
</P>
<P>
The event gave scientists a chance to study the size and nature of Saturn, and 
its rings and many moons, but it was far more than that. From the moment 
shortly before midnight that the star first flickered and dipped behind the 
outer ring to the time it emerged more than three hours later from the other 
side, Saturn owned the skies. 
</P>
<P>
"That's pretty bloody spectacular," sighed Leif Robinson, editor of Sky and 
Telescope Magazine, who talked to the fledgling Mt. Wilson Institute about 
using the 60-inch telescope at the Mt. Wilson Observatory to study the event. A 
handful of scientists and a few guests crouched on their hands and knees on the 
observatory's concrete floor to watch the entire drama on a small television 
monitor hooked up to the historic scope. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the time the crowd was quiet, almost reverent, but every time the star 
blazed through a hole in the rings it brought cheers and applause from 
astronomers who are more accustomed to fighting sleep than controlling their 
exuberance during long, nighttime stints at the telescope. 
</P>
<P>
"You could measure the size of the rings by the sound level in this room," 
observed astronomer Art Vaughan of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Vaughan is 
chairman of the board of the Mt. Wilson Institute and one of the prime movers 
in the drive to save the historic observatory from the scrap heap. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Major Role in Astronomy 
</P>
<P>
For nearly a century the Mt. Wilson Observatory played a major role in 
astronomy, but a few years ago the Carnegie Institution shocked the scientific 
world by announcing that the institute would concentrate its limited resources 
on its more modern observatory in Chile, and that would force it to close Mt. 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
But scientists and enthusiasts like Vaughan rose up en masse to challenge that 
move, giving birth to the Mt. Wilson Institute, a grass-roots organization that 
is dedicated to preserving the observatory. Last Jan. 5, the Carnegie 
Institution turned over the entire observatory to the Mt. Wilson Institute, and 
the old facility began a new life. 
</P>
<P>
The institute plans to turn the observatory into a major educational facility, 
and Vaughan noted that along the way it would be nice if it could fill in a few 
gaps left by the upstart observatories that have come along to take its place. 
</P>
<P>
That is exactly what it did Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Just a few days ago Robinson, whose magazine enjoys the respect of professional 
as well as amateur astronomers, was trying to find some way to capture the 
moment for his readers when he thought of Mt. Wilson. At first, Robinson said 
Monday night, he thought he would just ask permission to attach a small 
telescope to a 
</P>
<P>
drive mechanism at the observatory, giving him a chance to photograph the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
But when he approached the institute, he got a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
A team of scientists from the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics has 
been using the 60-inch telescope to study other stars to see if they have 
sunspots like the sun (they do, it turns out) and they were willing to turn the 
instrument toward Saturn for its rendezvous with a star known as 28 Sagittarii. 
</P>
<P>
"I was amazed by how quickly this all came together," Robinson said. "In a 
matter of a day or two we knew we had a telescope." 
</P>
<P>
Others quickly came aboard with instruments needed to study the eclipse, which 
astronomers call an "occultation," and by Sunday night the only thing lacking 
was a drum roll. 
</P>
<P>
"There it goes," astronomer Jim Frazer of the Harvard Smithsonian yelled as the 
star edged up to the outer ring. 
</P>
<P>
The rings of Saturn have long fascinated celestial observers because they 
create one of the most spectacular views in the sky. 
</P>
<P>
The Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft took much of the mystery out of the 
rings when they confirmed earlier evidence that the rings were not solid. Their 
contents range from gas and dust particles to the second largest moon in the 
solar system, but they also have gaps and even intermittent rings that are 
largely void of matter. 
</P>
<P>
Knowing that, the scientists at Mt. Wilson expected the star to disappear 
behind the rings almost immediately, but it turned out to be rather reluctant 
to leave the stage. 
</P>
<P>
"Bye, bye, starlight," Frazer said as the star first dipped behind the outer 
ring. 
</P>
<P>
But a second later it blazed brightly again, and the old dome housing the 
telescope reverberated with shouts and applause. 
</P>
<P>
"Holy mackerel, it's still there," Robinson said. "This is more fun than a 
pinball machine." 
</P>
<P>
"It's more fun than Christmas," added Lyndine McAfee, executive director of the 
Mt. Wilson Institute. 
</P>
<P>
And so it went, throughout the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other scientists at other observatories in Arizona, California, 
Hawaii and Chile were compiling data on the event. Videotapes from Mt. Wilson 
will be sent to the University of Arizona as part of that effort. 
</P>
<P>
Unchanged by it all was Saturn, second in mass among the planets only to 
Jupiter, an ethereal vision that does not look real as it moves across the sky, 
cloaked in rings of gold. 
</P>
<P>
But Sunday night and Monday morning, it blocked out the rays from a distant 
star, proving that it is, indeed, real.

U.S. PROTESTS CHINA'S 'PREMEDITATED' ATTACK ON ENVOYS' APARTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In an official move likely to further strain Washington's relations with 
China's new hard-line leadership, the U.S. Embassy here filed an angry protest 
with the Chinese government Monday, charging that People's Liberation Army 
troops deliberately targeted the apartments of American diplomats June 7 in a 
"premeditated" machine-gun attack on a diplomatic apartment complex in downtown 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
The formal protest came a day after the embassy released a two-page report with 
the findings of an investigation into the incident. No one was injured in the 
shooting, which occurred four days after the brutal army crackdown on 
pro-democracy demonstrators in central Beijing, but it touched off panic in the 
diplomatic community that led to mass evacuations of Americans and other 
nationals from China last month. 
</P>
<P>
The report, which indicated that the attack on the high-rise apartment building 
in one of the city's main diplomatic enclaves had been planned as early as the 
afternoon before, contained no speculation on the motives behind the shooting, 
which the Chinese leadership said was merely an operation to track down and 
arrest a sniper. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scare Tactic? 
</P>
<P>
But independent analysts and a diplomat who asked not to be identified said the 
assault appeared to be a scare tactic aimed at frightening the Americans into 
giving up prominent dissident Fang Lizhi, an astrophysicist and an ideological 
leader of the protest movement, who had been allowed to take refuge in the 
embassy compound the day before. 
</P>
<P>
Fang and his wife, Li Shuxian, also wanted as a protest leader, remain in the 
compound, which is surrounded by a contingent of Chinese security agents. And 
senior party officials have taken every opportunity to criticize Washington for 
harboring a man they consider a "counterrevolutionary" and criminal. 
</P>
<P>
Since the violent June 3-4 crackdown on political dissent, the Bush 
Administration has banned military sales to China, suspended military and 
high-level diplomatic meetings and promised to work against the granting of new 
loans to China by international lending institutions such as the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Those sanctions and the continuing harboring of Fang have drawn loud criticism 
from China's new, conservative leadership, which is desperately trying to 
convince the world that China's economy remains open to the outside world 
despite the political repression. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Self-Defense Claimed 
</P>
<P>
China's leadership offered no official comment on the U.S. protest Monday. But 
the official New China News Agency, reporting the protest, said the allegations 
of a deliberate plan to fire into the apartment complex were a lie and that the 
soldiers were firing in self-defense after snipers began firing at them from 
both sides of the street. 
</P>
<P>
"Under such circumstance, they certainly have the right to fire in self-defense 
at the direction from where the snipers' shots came," the agency said. It said 
one soldier died and two were wounded by snipers. 
</P>
<P>
There also was no official confirmation Monday of press reports that Chinese 
security police had arrested a Taiwanese journalist outside his hotel in 
Beijing after he had secretly interviewed student leader Wang Dan. 
</P>
<P>
Wang is one of the 21 most-wanted student leaders, ranking near the top of the 
list issued by the government after it began its crackdown and mass arrests of 
dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Monday night's national news on state-run television focused on the 
party's national security chief presenting to the ongoing session of China's 
rubber-stamp legislature a strict new law regulating public demonstrations, and 
on a meeting between hard-line Premier Li Peng and an unofficial Japanese 
delegation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appeal to Business 
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Li repeated the appeal for outside business interests to 
continue doing business with China, as well as the party leadership's line that 
last month's crackdown will have no effect on China's economic liberalization 
and openness. He specifically appealed to the Japanese to continue their 
investments in China. 
</P>
<P>
The new draft law on demonstrations would outlaw any demonstrations that "go 
against the basic principles of the constitution, or against the leadership of 
the Chinese Communist Party or the socialist system." 
</P>
<P>
Any demonstrations "advocating the split of the motherland or undermining 
national unity" would also be banned, and organizers of rallies would be 
required to obtain permits from police and to register the names of 
participants. 
</P>
<P>
The rules virtually guarantee that the only demonstrations permitted would be 
those whose aims are officially endorsed by the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's note of protest was delivered by U.S. Embassy Charge d'Affaires 
Raymond Burghardt to the Chinese Foreign Ministry. The embassy had protested in 
a general way within a few days of the shooting, but that protest lacked the 
detail and allegations of premeditation contained in Monday's report, the 
result of a three-week investigation by U.S. military analysts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Staged Incident? 
</P>
<P>
Monday's embassy report took pains to deny China's official version. 
Acknowledging that the security police did escort a suspect from the 
Jianguomenwai housing complex, the report stated, "observers said that the 
incident appeared to be staged, since the 'sniper' did not seem distressed nor 
did the (army) appear to be using expected force during the arrest." 
</P>
<P>
The report stated that the embassy's charge of premeditation was based on 
investigators' findings that on the afternoon of June 6, more than 12 hours 
before the shooting started, the army ordered the evacuation of all foreigners 
in an office building across the street from the diplomatic high-rise. 
</P>
<P>
As he was leaving the office building that afternoon, the report stated, one 
American said he noticed soldiers moving into positions in an adjacent, new 
office tower that is directly across from the diplomatic high-rise. 
</P>
<P>
When the shooting started after 10 a.m. the following morning, residents of the 
diplomatic complex saw machine-gun fire coming directly at them from the 
unoccupied building, as well as ground fire coming up at them from soldiers in 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'18 Incoming Rounds' 
</P>
<P>
The embassy report stated: "One American diplomat's apartment, upon 
examination, was found to have several rounds which came directly across from 
the building adjacent to (the occupied office building), not ground fire from 
the street. In addition, attache personnel from several other countries, 
including two defense attaches, also received . . . direct fire from the 
building. One defense attache's apartment took 18 incoming rounds. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt, in this embassy's opinion, that certain apartments were 
deliberately targeted by the People's Liberation Army," the U.S. report 
concluded. "There also is no question that some of the hits sustained by the 
apartments resulted from direct fire originating from the building" across the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the report said, the apartments of 11 Americans were hit by gunfire.

SOVIETS HAIL ANDREI GROMYKO, DEAD AT 79, AS 'DEVOTED SOLDIER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, Times Staff Writer

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Soviet President Andrei A. Gromyko, who became known as the world's most 
durable diplomat after 28 years as foreign minister for the Soviet Union, was 
hailed Monday -- a day after his death -- as a "devoted soldier" to the nation. 
</P>
<P>
But reaction in the capital to Gromyko's death at age 79 was low key. Soviet 
television announced that the man whose career ended when he was pushed out of 
the then-largely ceremonial post of president in September, 1988, will be 
buried Wednesday in Novodevichy Cemetery, primarily a resting place for 
prominent Soviet artists and military and politicians, instead of being 
interred beside the Kremlin walls, the traditional place of honor for top 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who announced Gromyko's death Monday to the 
Supreme Soviet and then asked its members to stand for a moment of silence, 
told Western journalists during a break in the legislature's session that he 
would not alter plans to begin a two-day visit to Paris today. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of Gromyko's death was not immediately announced. Soviet television 
said simply that he died after "a long, difficult illness." A Foreign Ministry 
spokesman announced three days ago that Gromyko had undergone surgery for an 
unspecified vascular problem, and he apparently was in the hospital at the time 
of his death. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lie in State 
</P>
<P>
The national television evening news program "Vremya" said that before the 
funeral, Gromyko's body would lie in state for five hours Wednesday in the Red 
Banner Hall of the Central House of the Soviet Army so that the public could 
pay last respects. 
</P>
<P>
"Good memories about him will stay forever in our hearts," the television 
announcer said after recounting his career. "The party and the Soviet people 
have lost a devoted soldier." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, in speaking to the Supreme Soviet, said of Gromyko: "His whole life 
was connected with history, with our achievements, our problems, with 
everything that falls on the lot of a person in the thick of events for whole 
decades." 
</P>
<P>
Radio Moscow did not program solemn music, however, as is common on the death 
of a state leader, and a profile by the official Tass news agency was skimpy. 
It remembered Gromyko as a leader who "came from a peasant family and, due to 
his abilities and personal qualities, succeeded in rising to the top posts of 
the party and state." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worked With Stalin 
</P>
<P>
One of the last survivors of the Kremlin leaders who worked closely with Josef 
Stalin in World War II, Gromyko was elevated to the presidency shortly before 
his 76th birthday in 1985. The promotion was engineered by Gorbachev, then 
newly installed as Soviet leader, to make way for his own official in the 
Foreign Ministry, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, in July, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Four months later, Gorbachev elbowed Gromyko aside from that post after having 
initiated reforms to give it far greater power. Those constitutional reforms 
were carried out earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Gromyko lost his last remaining key post in the Soviet leadership in April when 
he was dropped from the ruling Politburo. He simply did not fit with 
Gorbachev's "new thinking," which called for younger, more vigorous leaders 
capable of coping with the Soviet Union's massive social and economic problems 
and its desire to present a new face to the world. 
</P>
<P>
Gromyko became a pensioner, living quietly and, through rare interviews, 
offered only an occasional glimpse into his long life as a key player in the 
momentous decisions of World War II and the East-West confrontations that 
followed. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel sad over the fact that my position within the Communist Party has 
changed," he said in an October, 1988, Central Committee meeting. "But age is a 
stubborn thing and there is no getting away from it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Iron Teeth' 
</P>
<P>
Gromyko was widely believed to have been a major supporter of Gorbachev for the 
post of general secretary of the Communist Party -- the power position in the 
Kremlin. He reportedly nominated Gorbachev by saying: "This man has a nice 
smile -- but he has iron teeth." 
</P>
<P>
The new leader, however, clearly wanted to dominate the conduct of foreign 
policy, and Gromyko was effectively pushed into the ceremonial presidency. 
</P>
<P>
After he assumed that post, Gromyko remained out of the limelight. Although he 
helped arrange the Soviet-American summit in Geneva in November, 1985, he was 
not a member of the delegation that went with Gorbachev for the meeting with 
then-President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
And although Gromyko had been a member of the Soviet elite for decades, 
enjoying access to special shops and health facilities, he was assigned early 
in 1986 to tour food stores, medical clinics and hospitals and listen to 
ordinary citizens' complaints about poor services. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Gromyko dutifully carried out his chores, traveling to provincial cities 
and greeting foreign delegations, without ever indicating that he missed his 
former role at the center of power. 
</P>
<P>
Andrei Andreivich, as he was called, was a symbol of continuity in the 
fluctuating Soviet foreign policy in the postwar era. He was at Yalta with 
Stalin in 1945, earned the title of "Mr. Nyet" at the United Nations by casting 
25 vetoes in the Cold War era of the 1950s and then turned amiable during the 
flowering of detente in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Memoirs Published 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he published his memoirs in which he revealed, among other things, 
that Mao Tse-tung in 1958 planned to lure U.S. troops into the heart of China 
and then attack them with Soviet nuclear weapons. The plan, which the Soviets 
rejected, was based on Mao's belief that his country could survive a nuclear 
war even if it lost 300 million people. 
</P>
<P>
Other tidbits in the two-volume work, which covered nearly 50 years of 
diplomatic service, involved his memories of the tense days of October, 1962, 
when President John F. Kennedy and Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev almost 
pushed the world to war over Soviet missiles in Cuba; Soviet sadness at 
Kennedy's assassination just as the two nations seemed to be improving 
relations, and his youthful fascination with President Franklin D. Roosevelt -- 
a man "who knew how to conduct conversation freely, without any tension," and a 
leader who knew how to make and carry out policy. 
</P>
<P>
In one of his last public appearances -- a Moscow conference five months ago 
studying the Cuban Missile Crisis -- Gromyko recalled his interview with 
Kennedy as "probably the most difficult that I ever experienced in all my 48 
years of meeting Presidents of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
"The discussion with Kennedy was full of sharp turns, zigzags," he recalled. 
"He was clearly nervous, though outwardly he tried not to betray it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Real Threat' 
</P>
<P>
He said the crisis presented "a certain degree of risk" of nuclear war, but 
then added, "There was no real threat of the unleashing of nuclear war between 
the Soviet Union and the United States. I have solid grounds for this 
statement." 
</P>
<P>
He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Gromyko also expressed admiration for the pragmatism of President Richard M. 
Nixon but said Nixon did not have a good grasp of details. 
</P>
<P>
In later years, when Gromyko acquired the power to shape decisions as well as 
advocate the policies made by others, he seemed to adopt a tough line in 
Moscow's relations with the West. His attacks on the United States and its 
allies became more strident and matched the adjectives invariably applied to 
the man himself: grim, dour, tenacious. 
</P>
<P>
At the age of 75, long after most people retire, Gromyko seemed to be at the 
peak of his power inside the Kremlin hierarchy. As far as outsiders could 
judge, he had virtual control over foreign policy despite the nominal 
leadership of Soviet President Constantine U. Chernenko, who lacked experience 
in foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The result was a Soviet hard line, including a walkout from nuclear arms 
reduction talks with the United States and blunt accusations that West Germany 
and Japan were returning to the militarism that brought on World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the Soviet denunciations of President Reagan as a warmonger, however, 
Gromyko held a lengthy meeting with the chief executive late in September, 
1984, in the midst of the U.S. election campaign. It was Reagan's first meeting 
with any senior Soviet official and Gromyko's first visit to the White House in 
six years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Knew 9 Presidents 
</P>
<P>
During his career, Gromyko met with nine U.S. Presidents and 14 American 
secretaries of state. Although he lied about the presence of Soviet missiles in 
Cuba to Kennedy, Gromyko earned the admiration of several of his U.S. 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
"It was suicidal to negotiate with him without mastering the record," said 
former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger. 
</P>
<P>
The late W. Averill Harriman, who had served as U.S. ambassador to Moscow, once 
said that Gromyko deliberately schooled himself out of any human foibles. 
</P>
<P>
Like his Soviet colleagues, Gromyko always wore dark, somber clothing, but at 
times, with a gray fur hat, he appeared almost natty. He was tall, with slowly 
graying hair, and was fluent in English and French. 
</P>
<P>
He employed light repartee, cool reasoning, heavy sarcasm and table-pounding 
harangues in his diplomatic repertoire. But he also was expert at the slow, 
deliberate, detailed and unyielding Soviet style of negotiation, in which the 
aim is to draw out the adversary's position without revealing your own. 
</P>
<P>
With his remarkable memory and mastery of the historical record, he often tried 
to wear down the other side and win concessions by sheer persistence. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps his greatest diplomatic triumph was the Helsinki agreement of 1975, 
which had the effect of confirming the postwar frontiers in Europe without the 
necessity of signing a peace treaty with West Germany. In return, the Soviets 
agreed to a series of human rights guarantees that were only later, under 
Gorbachev, being partly fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moscow's Orbit 
</P>
<P>
From the Soviet point of view, this agreement ratified the existence of 
Communist states in East Germany, Poland, Czechoslavakia, Hungary and other 
nations in Moscow's orbit and reduced the potential threat from a reunified 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
But the Soviet Union also suffered setbacks during Gromyko's tenure at the 
Foreign Ministry. The split between Moscow and China, for example, erupted and 
was not healed until Gorbachev visited China this past May. 
</P>
<P>
In Western Europe, despite a massive Soviet propaganda campaign, U.S. missiles 
were installed at bases in West Germany, Italy and Britain. While the United 
States said the weapons were needed to offset Soviet missiles aimed at European 
capitals, the Soviets regarded it as an unacceptable escalation of the nuclear 
arms race. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Soviets walked out of arms talks in Geneva, blaming the 
Americans for undermining the discussions on intermediate-range and strategic 
weapons. Western analysts, however, said Gromyko's insistence on removal of the 
U.S. missiles before talks could be resumed was an overly rigid policy that 
could lead nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
But Gromyko won Politburo backing for his hard line, and diplomacy came to a 
standstill while Washington and Moscow blamed each other for the impasse. 
</P>
<P>
The deadlock over the missiles was finally broken under Shevardnadze, Gromyko's 
successor at the Foreign Ministry, when Gorbachev and Reagan signed the 
historic Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty in December, 1987, that 
called for the elimination of all ground-launched missiles with ranges of 300 
to 3,400 miles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Like Bermuda Triangle' 
</P>
<P>
At times, Gromyko showed flashes of humor. Once, in Moscow, he alluded to the 
casualties of Kremlin infighting when he said: "You know how it is here. A bit 
like the Bermuda Triangle. From time to time, one of us disappears." 
</P>
<P>
But for many years he was the ultimate survivor in the Soviet system, not only 
escaping the purges of the Stalin era but adding to his power and prestige with 
the passing years. 
</P>
<P>
Born into a poor peasant family in the White Russian village of Gromyki, he was 
educated at the Minsk Agricultural Institute and taught at the Institute of 
Economics in Moscow. At the age of 22, he joined the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
In 1939, he suddenly switched careers and entered the Foreign Ministry, where 
he was assigned to the American desk. Two years later, after the Nazi invasion 
of the Soviet Union, Gromyko was sent to the Soviet Embassy in Washington. Two 
years after that, at the age of 34, he was named ambassador to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Following the war, he took part in the founding conference of the United 
Nations and later became the best-known Soviet envoy to the world body. He made 
one big mistake there -- he walked out of a Security Council meeting at the 
wrong time and allowed the United States to get U.N. backing for the war 
against North Korea without the expected Soviet veto. 
</P>
<P>
Gromyko also served in London and Moscow before he was named in 1957 to replace 
the out-of-favor Vyacheslav M. Molotov as foreign minister. But it was not 
until 16 years later that he acquired real power by being named to the ruling 
Politburo, the small group of Communist Party leaders who really run the 
country. He received the added title of first deputy premier in March, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sheer Competence 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, Gromyko made his name through sheer competence. Although he 
lacked a power base, he did not offend others by showing signs of political 
ambitions himself. He was the model technocrat who let others take the 
limelight. 
</P>
<P>
At times, Gromyko's inherent dignity was offended. The boisterous Khrushchev 
once said in public that his foreign minister would take down his pants and sit 
on a block of ice if Khrushchev gave the order. On another occasion, Khrushchev 
brusquely directed Gromyko to join a Swedish folk dance troupe with the advice: 
"Shake a leg, Andrei." 
</P>
<P>
Fellow diplomats called him "Grim Grom," a play on the Russian word grom, 
meaning "thunder." Conversely, during the days of detente he was called 
"Amiable Andrei." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to other aging Kremlin leaders, Gromyko always seemed to be in good 
health. He was known as a workaholic, often putting in 12-hour days and meeting 
up to 10 of his counterparts during the sessions of the U.N. General Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
At home, he liked to play chess with his wife, Lidya, one of the few Kremlin 
spouses who was seen on the diplomatic banquet circuit. He is survived also by 
their two children: Anatoly, a specialist in African policy, and Emilya, who is 
married to a diplomat.

President Bush said Monday that the death of Andrei A. Gromyko "marks the 
passing" of an era, extending his sympathy to Gromyko's family and the Soviet 
people. 
</P>
<P>
"Andrei Gromyko's career paralleled the course of U.S.-Soviet relations for 
nearly 50 years," a vacationing Bush said in a statement released by the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
"As ambassador to the U.S., as one of the architects of the U.N., as foreign 
minister for nearly three decades and finally as chairman of the Presidium of 
the Supreme Soviet, Mr. Gromyko knew every U.S. President" since Franklin D. 
Roosevelt. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said: "Andrei Gromyko's death marks the passing of a generation that 
witnessed many of the most historic events of this century." 
</P>
<P>
He said that he and wife Barbara extend their sympathies to Gromyko's family 
and that the U.S. government "extends its condolences to the government and 
people of the Soviet Union."

ESTONIAN LITERARY JOURNAL PUBLISHES 1ST CHAPTER OF ONCE-BANNED 'GULAG'

<P>
An Estonian literary journal has published the first chapter of Alexander 
Solzhenitsyn's once-taboo epic, "The Gulag Archipelago," which describes labor 
camps and political oppression since the foundation of the Soviet state. 
</P>
<P>
The July 1 edition of the daily Sovietskaya Estonia, which reached Moscow on 
Monday, said the Estonian-language monthly Looming had begun publishing the 
work after getting permission from the author, who now lives in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
The journal said it planned to publish the next two chapters of Solzhenitsyn's 
epic documentary history of Soviet labor camps in upcoming editions. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a leading Soviet literary magazine said it also will begin printing 
excerpts of "Gulag" in August, and the Soviet Writers' Union petitioned for 
restoration of the exiled author's citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
"We have decided to begin with 'Gulag' because this is one of the most 
important, unique and one of the premier works of Solzhenitsyn," Novy Mir 
magazine's Grigory Reznechenko said. Novy Mir's publication is to begin in the 
August issue and run for four months, filling more than half of each 270-page 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
Next year, Novy Mir also will publish two major Solzhenitsyn novels that have 
never appeared in the Soviet Union, "Cancer Ward" and "The First Circle," 
Reznechenko said. 
</P>
<P>
The Writers' Union has restored the Nobel Prize-winning author's membership, 
which was stripped in 1969, and requested that his Soviet citizenship be 
returned, Reznechenko said. 
</P>
<P>
Solzhenitsyn, 70, was put aboard a plane for the West in 1974 and has lived in 
Vermont for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Literary authorities stopped publishing Solzhenitsyn's works in 1963, and only 
a small body of his writings has been seen in Soviet publications.

LAWYER REGRETS BACKING KENNEDY

<TEXT>
<P>
A prominent civil rights lawyer says he feels embarrassed and betrayed by his 
pre-confirmation endorsement of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, in 
light of Kennedy's recent rulings in civil rights cases. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I could take back that endorsement," Nathaniel Colley Sr., former 
longtime regional counsel for the NAACP, said in an interview published Monday 
in the Los Angeles Daily Journal, a legal newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Colley, a longtime acquaintance and teaching colleague of Kennedy's, testified 
for the Supreme Court nominee before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1987 and 
helped persuade the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People and 
other civil rights groups not to oppose Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Colley said he was dismayed that Kennedy has joined rulings that have made it 
harder for minorities to challenge employment practices and have allowed whites 
to upset minority hiring agreements, and was the author of a decision that 
restricted the ability to sue for on-the-job racial harassment.

COURT ACCEPTS ITS FIRST CASE ON 'RIGHT TO DIE'

<P>
The Supreme Court on Monday accepted its first-ever "right-to-die" case, 
agreeing to decide whether a Missouri couple may remove their brain-damaged 
daughter from a life-support system. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Cruzan, 31, has been in what doctors describe as a persistent vegetative 
condition since a January, 1983, car crash. 
</P>
<P>
Her parents, Joe and Joyce Cruzan, want to remove the feeding tube surgically 
implanted in her stomach. Without it, doctors say, she will die of starvation 
or dehydration; with it, she may live for 30 years or more. 
</P>
<P>
The court said it would review a 4-3 ruling of the Missouri Supreme Court that 
forbade doctors to remove the tube. A decision is expected next year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Periods of Wakefulness 
</P>
<P>
Cruzan is able to breathe on her own and has periods of wakefulness in which 
her eyes move randomly in all directions. Doctors say she is incapable of 
reacting or relating to her environment and can experience no thoughts or 
emotions. 
</P>
<P>
Her parents said their daughter at one time had said she would not want to be 
kept alive in such a condition. 
</P>
<P>
But the Missouri Supreme Court said: "We find no principled legal basis which 
permits the co-guardians in this case to choose the death of their ward. The 
state's interest is in the preservation of life, not only Nancy's life but also 
the lives of persons similarly situated yet without the support of a loving 
family. 
</P>
<P>
"We choose to err on the side of life, respecting the rights of incompetent 
persons who may wish to live despite a severely diminished quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
The state Supreme Court overturned a judge's ruling that would have allowed the 
Cruzans to order the feeding tube removed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State Has Living Will Law 
</P>
<P>
The Missouri Legislature has enacted a law -- a so-called living will statute 
-- that permits the withdrawal of artificial life-support systems from 
hopelessly ill and injured patients. But the law specifically forbids 
withholding food and water from them. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court on Monday agreed also to take another look, in its next term, 
at how far states may go to prohibit advertising by lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
The court said it will hear an appeal by an Illinois lawyer censured for saying 
on his professional letterhead that he is a civil trial specialist certified by 
the National Board of Trial Advocacy, a private organization. 
</P>
<P>
The Illinois Supreme Court, which disciplines that state's lawyers, last 
February upheld the state rule against advertising oneself as a certified civil 
trial specialist.

A CHRONOLOGY OF THE SUPREME COURT'S MAJOR ABORTION DECISIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jan. 22, 1973 -- In Roe vs. Wade, the court for the first time legalized 
abortion nationwide. The opinion, written by Justice Harry A. Blackmun, was 
based on a 7-2 ruling on a woman's constitutional right to privacy. 
</P>
<P>
A woman's decision to have an abortion during the first three months of 
pregnancy must be left to her and her doctor. 
</P>
<P>
States may interfere in the abortion decision during the second trimester only 
to protect the woman's health, and may take steps only to protect fetal life in 
the third trimester. 
</P>
<P>
State authority to regulate abortions after the first trimester was not made 
absolute, however. 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 22, 1973 -- In Roe vs. Bolton the court that same day struck down, by a 
7-2 vote, restrictions on facilities that could be used to perform abortions. 
</P>
<P>
The decision gave rise to a new kind of medical facility, the abortion clinic. 
</P>
<P>
July 1, 1976 -- In Planned Parenthood vs. Danforth, the court, by a 6-3 vote, 
limited rights of husbands and by a 5-4 vote limited rights of parents of 
pregnant minors 
</P>
<P>
States cannot give husbands veto power over their pregnant wives' decision to 
abort their pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
Neither can parents of minor, unwed girls be given an absolute veto. 
</P>
<P>
June 20, 1977 -- In Maher vs. Roe, the court voting 6-3, ruled that states have 
no legal obligation to pay for "non-therapeutic" abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 9, 1979 -- In Colautti vs. Franklin, reached by a 6-3 vote, the court 
reaffirmed its intention to give doctors broad discretion in determining the 
timing of "fetal viability" -- when a fetus can live outside the mother's womb. 
</P>
<P>
States may seek to protect a fetus that has reached viability but that 
determination is up to doctors, not courts or legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
July 2, 1979 -- In Bellotti vs. Baird, the court by an 8-1 vote elaborated on 
its parental consent decision of 1976. 
</P>
<P>
It implied that states may be able to require a pregnant, unmarried minor to 
obtain parental consent to an abortion so long as the state law provides an 
alternative procedure to parental approval, such as letting the minor seek a 
state judge's approval instead. 
</P>
<P>
June 30, 1980 -- In Harris vs. McRae, the so-called Hyde Amendment was upheld 
by a 5-4 vote. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling held that the federal government and individual states are under no 
legal obligation to pay for even medically necessary abortions sought by women 
on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
March 23, 1981 -- In H.L. vs. Matheson, the court ruled by a 6-3 vote that 
states may require doctors consulted by some young girls -- those still 
dependent on their parents and too "immature" to decide for themselves -- to 
try to inform parents before performing an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
June 15, 1983 -- In three decisions called City of Akron vs. Akron Center for 
Reproductive Health, Planned Parenthood of Kansas City vs. Ashcroft and 
Simopolous vs. Virginia, the court, 6-3, ruled states and local communities may 
not require all abortions for women more than three months pregnant to be 
performed in a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The court also struck down regulations that imposed a 24-hour waiting period 
between the signing of an abortion consent form and the medical procedure and 
required doctors to tell women seeking an abortion that a fetus is a "human 
life." 
</P>
<P>
June 11, 1986 -- In Thornburgh vs. American College of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists, the court, by 5-4, struck down Pennsylvania abortion rules 
similar to those rejected in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
It also struck down requirements that doctors performing third-trimester 
abortions, which are rare, use procedures least risky to a fetus capable of 
surviving outside the womb, and that two doctors attend abortions performed in 
the third trimester.

<P>
Ruled states may not require doctors to inform women seeking abortions about 
potential risks and about available medical assistance benefits for prenatal 
care and childbirth. 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 14, 1987 -- In Hartigan vs. Zbaraz, the court split 4-4. The effect was to 
invalidate an Illinois law that could have made abortions more difficult to 
obtain for some teen-agers.

June 11, 1986 -- In Thornburgh vs. American College of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists, the court voted 5-4 to strike down Pennsylvania abortion 
regulations somewhat similar to those it invalidated in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The court also struck down requirements that doctors performing third-trimester 
abortions, which are rare, use procedures least risky to a fetus capable of 
surviving outside the womb, and that two doctors always be present for 
abortions performed in the third trimester. 
</P>
<P>
Invalidated a regulation requiring doctors to make a record, which could become 
available to the public, of every abortion they perform. 
</P>
<P>
Ruled states may not require doctors to inform women seeking abortions about 
potential risks and about available medical assistance benefits for prenatal

Dec. 14, 1987 -- In Hartigan vs. Zbaraz, the court split 4-4. The effect was to 
invalidate an Illinois law that could have made abortions more difficult to 
obtain for some teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
July 3, 1989: The court upholds a Missouri law requiring doctors to determine, 
when possible, whether a fetus at least 20 weeks old is "viable," or capable of 
surviving outside the womb. Missouri law bans abortions of viable fetuses. 
</P>
<P>
The court also says Missouri may ban public health care providers from 
assisting abortions not necessary to save women's lives, and it may ban public 
hospitals and other taxpayer-supported facilities from providing abortions not 
necessary to save women's lives. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the court upholds Missouri's right to ban the use of tax money for 
"encouraging or counseling" women to have abortions not necessary to save their 
lives.

SCORECARD: HOW THE JUSTICES VOTED 
</P>
<P>
On the narrow issues posed by Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services, the 
court split 5 to 4 in upholding most controversial provisions of a Missouri law 
regulating abortion. More generally, most of the justices addressed whether 
they would overturn or modify Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 decision that legalized 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Here is how the court divided:

A deliberately set fire caused minor damage to an abortion clinic Monday hours 
before the U.S. Supreme Court announced its ruling limiting the right to an 
abortion, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they were notifying federal authorities because of the 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"Where it's at a feminist health center and there's been this nationwide thing 
involving them (abortion clinics), we felt that we should notify them," said 
Jim Moran, director of investigations for the Concord police. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials received an alarm at 2:20 a.m., said Capt. Jack Davis, fire 
prevention officer. The fire, confined to a bookcase in one room in the 
unoccupied building, was put out with a portable extinguisher.

ROE RULING HAS SURVIVED BUT IT MAY FACE A SLOW DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Monday's long-awaited Supreme Court abortion decision has changed nothing, 
legal experts said Monday. And it has changed everything. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing has changed because the court announced no new principles governing 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
But everything has changed because, for the first time since the 1973 Roe vs. 
Wade decision, five justices are clearly on record as supporting increasingly 
tough anti-abortion regulations. 
</P>
<P>
And so, analysts said, Monday's opinion upholding Missouri's abortion law 
indicates that the court's conservative majority may handle abortion in much 
the same way that similar majorities have handled liberal precedents on 
criminals' rights: not discarding them directly, but nibbling away at them 
until there is virtually nothing left. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Not Have to Decide 
</P>
<P>
The court, said Harvard University constitutional law expert Laurence Tribe, 
may never overrule Roe explicitly because it may never have to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of the court has handed every state a road map" for undoing Roe, 
piece by piece, Tribe said. "The majority," he said, "has begun an inexorable 
path of dismantling" the Roe decision. 
</P>
<P>
The next steps on that path will largely be up to one member of the court, 
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, said former Ronald Reagan Administration Solicitor 
General Rex E. Lee. O'Connor is the justice in the middle on a court 
increasingly unreceptive to abortion-rights arguments. 
</P>
<P>
On one side, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White and 
Antonin Scalia are now on record as saying that Roe should be overruled. The 
court's newest member, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, would not go that far 
Monday, but he was willing to join Rehnquist and White in an opinion saying 
that they would "modify and narrow" Roe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blackmun Dissent 
</P>
<P>
Opposed to those four are Justices William J. Brennan Jr., Thurgood Marshall, 
John Paul Stevens and Harry A. Blackmun. Blackmun, the author of the Roe 
decision, announced in a calmly read but emotion-laden dissent that the court's 
decision "discards a landmark case" and "casts into darkness the hopes and 
visions" of American women. Those four would maintain Roe and subsequent 
abortion-rights decisions intact. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor staked out a middle ground Monday, as she has in previous cases. 
Abortion rights, in her view, are protected by the Constitution, but not 
intensively. State restrictions on abortion are valid so long as they are not 
"unduly burdensome." 
</P>
<P>
Although none of the other eight justices agrees with that formula, each side 
needs O'Connor's vote to form a majority. 
</P>
<P>
"One person is really deciding what the law is," Lee said, even though "there 
is only one person who really takes that position." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor has never defined what she means by "undue burden" and that virtually 
guarantees more test cases to come. But in the past, she has made clear that 
very few state restrictions would go too far for her liking. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor has said, for example, that she would approve state laws requiring 
that all second-trimester abortions take place in hospitals, not outpatient 
clinics. Although about 90% of all abortions take place during the first three 
months of pregnancy, women who seek abortions from the 12th to the 18th weeks 
of pregnancy often go to clinics, where the cost of abortion is generally far 
less than the cost in a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor has also voted to uphold laws requiring that parents of teen-agers 
seeking abortions receive more notice than the court currently allows. The 
justices agreed Monday to consider two cases next fall involving that question. 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, among the few abortion restrictions that O'Connor has indicated 
she would not approve was one that the court struck down in a 1976 case, also 
from Missouri, giving husbands a veto over a woman's decision to have an 
abortion. Anti-abortion activists have vowed to pursue such "fathers' rights" 
laws as future tests of how far the high court is willing to allow abortion 
regulation to go. 
</P>
<P>
For all the portents of vast change to come, however, the court's actual 
decision Monday was remarkably narrow. 
</P>
<P>
The deeply divided justices upheld only one significant new restriction on 
abortion rights -- a Missouri rule against abortions in public hospitals. And 
that restriction, while of great significance to poor persons who use public 
hospitals, involved only the extension of an existing rule, not a dramatic 
break with the past. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the court has repeatedly said that the Constitution does not force 
states to spend taxpayer funds in programs such as Medicaid to support 
abortions. Lawyers who challenged Missouri's law tried to convince the justices 
that public hospitals are fundamentally different from the programs the court 
had looked at before. 
</P>
<P>
But the court majority was not receptive. The Constitution may stop the 
government from interfering with a person's rights, Rehnquist wrote, but it 
confers "no affirmative right to government aid." 
</P>
<P>
The court largely sidestepped other questions in the case. 
</P>
<P>
The justices upheld a regulation requiring doctors to test women seeking 
abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy to see if their fetuses are viable. 
But O'Connor provided the crucial fifth vote only on the grounds that the rule 
requires only limited tests, such as a sonogram, that a doctor deems 
appropriate. Abortion rights advocates had feared extensive, costly and 
potentially dangerous tests that would have made abortions after 20 weeks all 
but impossible to obtain. 
</P>
<P>
If the experts are correct and Roe is gradually whittled away, the process will 
fit a pattern of gradually cutting back on the liberal precedents established 
by the court under the late Chief Justice Earl Warren. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1970s, after President Richard M. Nixon's appointees had joined the 
court, many observers expected the court to openly overturn major cases handed 
down by the Warren court. 
</P>
<P>
But the swing justices of the 1970s and early 1980s, Potter Stewart and Lewis 
F. Powell Jr., refused to follow that script. Like O'Connor on abortion, they 
often ruled against the earlier decisions, but on a case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, all the major criminal-law precedents of the Warren court remain 
on the books. The court still uses them in some cases to rein in state and 
local officials. 
</P>
<P>
Liberal critics of the court, however, often assert that many of the decisions 
have been reduced to mere shells, robbed of most of their vitality. Roe vs. 
Wade may now face the same fate.

ABORTION ISSUE QUICKLY SEGUES INTO THE TV SPOTLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just after 10 a.m., two runners carrying documents broke from the front door of 
the Supreme Court, tore down the marble steps and raced over to the CNN and the 
NBC umbrellas. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd surged toward the lights. The competing abortion rights and 
anti-abortion demonstrators, which had been staging a fierce battle of pep 
squads on the sidewalk, went silent. Even the man dressed as the Pope to 
protest the Roman Catholic Church's authority as an expert on sex stopped and 
watched. 
</P>
<P>
The network correspondents, after nearly a month of rehearsals and false 
alarms, had three or four minutes to digest the 77-page court opinion before 
going on the air. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Machinery Starts Up 
</P>
<P>
The machinery of modern democracy, inevitably connected now to the end of a 
microphone and linked by cables to the double-parked satellite microwave 
trucks, began to churn. 
</P>
<P>
If James Madison imagined democracy as a kind of outdoor flea market of 
competing groups peddling their wares in a wearying, blurry cacophony, the 
steps of the U.S. Supreme Court Monday on the morning of the court's decision 
in Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services came close to realization of the 
metaphor. 
</P>
<P>
Part of what the sellers at this flea market were selling was "spin" -- the 
most advantageous interpretation on the decision from a particular point of 
view. For both sides, it seemed to be to make the decision as apocalyptic as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposing Views Aired 
</P>
<P>
Thus within moments of the decision, Planned Parenthood's Faye Wattleton was 
calling the court decision "an outrage" on NBC, while Dr. John Willke of the 
National Right to Life Committee was in front of 36 cameras on the other side 
of the court steps calling the decision the begining of a new era. 
</P>
<P>
But there was more going on than controlling the spin. 
</P>
<P>
'I don't think it serves any political agenda to utter a few platitudes," said 
Roger Evans, litigation director for Planned Parenthood, which brought the 
Webster case to the court three years ago. Getting in front of the camera on 
network television, he said, helps the interest groups to raise their 
visibility and fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
So those from the American Collegians for Life to the National Organization for 
Women had their public relations staff circulating, looking to alert anyone 
wearing press passes of news conferences later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Among the competing interests vying to be heard, capitalism was not lost. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spectator Spot Bought 
</P>
<P>
Former used car dealer Randall Terry, director of Operation Rescue, the 
anti-abortion group, wanted to be in the courtroom's public gallery so much 
that he had one of his staff offer to buy the spot of anyone of the first 50 
spectators waiting in line. No. 11, Patrick Baker was persuaded, went for $100. 
</P>
<P>
But Terry had visibility in mind, too. He made sure that he was one of the 
first down the steps to tell the cameras how the court had ruled, which 
guaranteed his group time at least on CNN's live broadcast from the scene. He 
was beaten to the press conference area, however, by Molly Yard, the president 
of the pro-abortion rights National Organization for Women. 
</P>
<P>
But even in this marketplace there are rules. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators carrying placards are not allowed on the court grounds, so they 
protested on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
It was here that a man calling himself Father John of the Face dressed in a 
Franciscan monk's robes led demonstrators in saying the Rosary. It was here 
that George Lucas, director of a small group calling itself the American Life 
League, attracted TV coverage by coming to the court to protest abortion with a 
swath of American flags and singing a version of "God Bless America" that 
ranged over several keys. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cheerleading Battles 
</P>
<P>
At times, demonstrators pro and con would take each other on in cheerleading 
battles that resembled a high school halftime show -- "Life yes, abortion no," 
drowned by "Right to life, your name's a lie; you don't care if women die." 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, small debates would erupt and quickly evolve into Morton Downey 
Jr. nose-to-nose shouting fests. 
</P>
<P>
Others came simply to be a part of history. Yale undergraduate Michael Carrier 
of New York had waited since 10:30 a.m. Sunday to be first in line for seats in 
the public gallery 23 hours later. Jim Paul of Beverly Hills, Calif., was 
second. "A decision of this importance, I had to be here," Carrier said. 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest draw for tourists was not the court but the media. More than an 
hour after the decision was announced, at least 200 onlookers remained, staring 
in rapt attention as CBS' Rita Braver stood alone looking bored for about 10 
minutes, part of the time with her eyes closed, waiting for her next live 
stand-up. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly a month, all three networks had been on what CBS producer Tom Seem 
called a full "special events standby" status, meaning that they were ready to 
break into regular programming on those days if the court had handed down this 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
10 NBC Crews on Standby 
</P>
<P>
NBC had five correspondents, six producers, 10 crews, three microwave trucks 
and senators, congressmen and special interest group guests on standby 10 
different mornings in anticipation of the decision, according to bureau chief 
Tim Russert. 
</P>
<P>
In the marketplace of ideas, interests can change quickly. Rep. Robert K. 
Dornan (R-Garden Grove) showed up late -- police at first shooed him away for 
illegally parking -- and promptly got into an argument with a group of college 
women calling themselves Catholics for Choice. 
</P>

But when the argument over theology and politics ended, one of the women asked 
him for tickets to the White House tour. Always quick to recognize a potential 
constituent, Dornan quickly consented:

"My office," he told her, "is fastest on the Hill with White House tickets."

RAPIDLY CHANGING TECHNOLOGY; 
</P>
<P>
PAPER BALLOTS' DAYS MAY BE NUMBERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In the rapidly changing world of computer technology, most of the nation's 
electronic vote-counting systems are obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
Punch-card balloting, like the Votomatic system used in Los Angeles County, is 
fast and inexpensive and the cards themselves provide an "audit trail" that can 
be followed in case an election result is challenged. 
</P>
<P>
But some of Votomatic's essential ingredients -- the punch-card ballots and the 
machines that can read up to 1,000 ballot cards a minute -- date back to what 
one expert called the "Stone Age of computers." 
</P>
<P>
Inasmuch as this technology is now used for little else than vote tabulation, 
election officials in Los Angeles and elsewhere worry about future availability 
of ballot pages, ballot cards and card-reading machines. 
</P>
<P>
What will replace punch-card technology? 
</P>
<P>
Some members of the election community wax enthusiastic about a future in which 
voters no longer troop to the polls but instead cast their ballots by 
telephone, computer terminal or cable television. 
</P>
<P>
"I see a day when voters will vote from home, by phone or computer, and all the 
counting will be done centrally," said Eeve T. Lewis, county clerk and 
registrar of voters in Sonoma County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Technically Possible Amid Drawbacks 
</P>
<P>
Some of these ideas are technically possible now but they have other drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
There are equity considerations -- not everyone has access to cable television 
or computer terminals, for example -- and there are security problems, because 
most of these systems could become tempting targets for computer "hackers" and 
would-be perpetrators of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, maintaining the secret ballot would be difficult inasmuch as 
voters might be identified through telephones, computer terminals or television 
sets. 
</P>
<P>
But one new approach is already at hand -- Direct Recording Electronic (DRE), 
an all-electronic voting system that does away with printed ballots entirely. 
</P>
<P>
The most widely used of these is the Shouptronic, manufactured by the R.F. 
Shoup Corp. of Pennsylvania, and used by about 80 election jurisdictions around 
the country (but not in California, where no DRE system has been certified). 
</P>
<P>
In a Shouptronic booth, a voter is confronted by flashing red lights over the 
names of candidates and issues. Selections are made by touching the lights, 
which then go out, one by one, as votes are cast. 
</P>
<P>
Results are recorded on both a tape and a cartridge, located in the back of the 
machine. When the polls close, the tapes and cartridges are taken to a central 
counting station, where the results from each polling place are read by a 
computer and totaled in a matter of minutes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New York Switchover to Set Pace 
</P>
<P>
Only about 3% of U.S. registered voters used DRE systems in the November, 1988, 
presidential election, but that figure will increase sharply if New York City 
follows through on plans to replace its 7,000, 26-year-old lever voting 
machines with the all-electronic devices, at a cost of $40 million to $60 
million. 
</P>
<P>
DRE eliminates most of the tons of paper that are produced by other 
vote-counting systems, sharply reducing the printing costs that are a major 
election expense. Because there are no ballots, there are no problems with 
"hanging chad" -- small pieces that cling to ballots in a punch-card system, 
invalidating many votes and making it all but impossible to get the same result 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to cumbersome, 750-pound lever machines, DRE devices are easy to 
handle and require less storage space. The Shouptronic weighs less than 200 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
But DRE machines are expensive ($3,000 to $6,000 per unit) and they require the 
use of many telephone lines, which can create security problems. They cannot be 
used by the ever-increasing numbers of absentee voters. 
</P>
<P>
Another major drawback is the lack of an "audit trail," an independent record 
that can be checked in case of an equipment breakdown or a challenged result. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Much More Risky' Than Current Systems 
</P>
<P>
DRE is "much more risky" than current computerized tabulation systems because 
"you are fundamentally required to accept the logical operation of the machine 
-- there is no way to do an independent check," said Roy G. Saltman, of the 
federal government's Institute for Computer Sciences and Technology. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Boram, the engineer who designed the Shouptronic system, said it 
contains "five redundant memories" to check on accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
But Saltman said "that is not an external, independent check" on the accuracy 
of the computer program. 
</P>
<P>
Shoup and other DRE manufacturers are thinking about adding a feature to the 
machines that would provide a printed copy of each voter's selections. 
</P>
<P>
But Saltman said "that doesn't solve the problem, because the computer could be 
lying." 
</P>
<P>
"DRE is at least a year and possibly two years away from what I would consider 
to be a marketable product," said Robert J. Naegele of Santa Cruz, who has 
evaluated the all-electronic systems as a consultant for New York State. "The 
hardware problems are relatively minor, but the software problems are 
conceptual and really major."

'GODDESS' IS WELCOMED IN CHINATOWN AFTER BEING HUSTLED OUT OF CIVIC CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hoisted ingloriously onto a flatbed truck, Los Angeles' replica of the "Goddess 
of Democracy" statue was evicted Monday on the orders of city officials from 
its perch on a Civic Center footbridge. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike its prototype in China, crushed by government troops during the 
Beijing massacre last month, this 23-foot-high makeshift monument survived to 
receive a hero's welcome in a new home -- Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
With the assistance of a dozen city workers, the monument was lifted onto its 
feet on the front steps of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Assn. 
headquarters on Broadway. The monument will remain in place in Chinatown for at 
least the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Said association President Jon G. Wong: "We welcome the statue. We may try to 
put it in the Chinatown Plaza but otherwise it will remain here. We're not 
going to let anyone destroy it." 
</P>
<P>
The monument, built of plastic foam and wood by a Santa Monica artist, startled 
and fascinated onlookers in Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
"The more the better," Bill Brophy, 39, a tourist from San Diego, said of the 
1,000-pound statue. Brophy added that he would like the Chinese government to 
"see a thousand statues like this." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles' hastily constructed Goddess was erected outside City Hall on June 
12, without city permission, as a tribute to supporters of the Chinese 
pro-democracy movement, whose dreams had ended in bloodshed the previous week. 
Despite her tender age, the Goddess seemingly has endured a lifetime of peril. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Safety Issue Resolved 
</P>
<P>
Before the torch could be hammered into place, police and fire officials, 
worried that the statue could topple, ordered the artwork removed. Councilman 
Michael Woo interceded, asking the Board of Public Works to cut through its 
usual red tape and grant permission for the statue to remain in place 
temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
The safety issue was answered by the forces of nature, even before the board 
voted. Specifically, the earth shook, in the form of a 4.5-magnitude 
earthquake. The statue remained unbowed. 
</P>
<P>
That morning, the board allowed the statue to remain on the footbridge for a 
week. And the next week, board members agreed to allow its move to the steps of 
City Hall for another 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
But then the city attorney's office stepped in, opining that city approval of 
political displays on government property could set a dangerous precedent. 
</P>
<P>
Artist Tom Van Sant was given a deadline of 5 p.m. Monday to remove the statue, 
which has weathered considerably during its three-week life span. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the city government provided a crew for the move, which 
required seven trucks, a dozen employees and 2 1/2 hours of hard work. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Van Sant arrived at the Civic Center, nearly an hour late, Bureau 
of Street Lighting employees had already gently rigged the monument for its 
removal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fissures Evident 
</P>
<P>
Van Sant said he was tardy because he had stopped off at two lumber yards to 
find plastic foam to repair parts of the monument that have deteriorated since 
its construction. Two large panels of foam have fallen off its back and several 
fissures were evident on its robe. 
</P>
<P>
First, crew member Elliott Kowitz, perched in a cherry-picker, unfastened the 
statue's torch. Then four workers tilted the Goddess onto its back. 
</P>
<P>
Ten hard-hatted men, looking like pallbearers carrying an oversized Egyptian 
mummy, proceeded to walk the 23-foot statue across the mall outside the Los 
Angeles Children's Museum to a waiting city truck. 
</P>
<P>
The statue was placed on its back in the vehicle, its head hanging out over the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
The only damage in the entire operation occurred when workers gave it a final 
shove into the truck. A third foam panel fell from its shoulder area. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a rotator cuff injury," Kowitz shouted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Neat Stuff' 
</P>
<P>
Among the small crowd watching the move was Mark Walsh, who was pushing his 
21-month-old son, Alex, in a stroller. 
</P>
<P>
'We think it's just neat stuff," the tourist from San Francisco said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a wonderful idea," echoed Carolyn Scofield, a visitor from San 
Diego. "I'm glad we're using our taxpayers' money for something like this. I 
think it's very worthwhile. We might as well use it to show we stand up for 
freedom." 
</P>
<P>
According to Board of Public Works President Edward J. Avila, the statue 
transfer will probably cost more than $1,000 in city funds. 
</P>
<P>
"We allowed the statue to stay up for this length of time," he said, "and so we 
feel an obligation to move it." 
</P>
<P>
Late last week, Avila ordered the statue removed after receiving an opinion 
from Deputy City Atty. Chris Westhoff that placing it at City Hall could set a 
poor precedent. Last week, the board received a letter asking for equal space 
for a display that would claim that the Holocaust during World War II did not 
take place. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Statue Praised 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you allow a group or cause to put up a display, you end up with other 
people trying to take advantage," Westhoff said. 
</P>
<P>
After the Chinatown installation, celebrated with several bursts of illegal 
firecrackers, onlookers enthusiastically praised the statue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good because it represents freedom," said college student Shirley Wong, 
23. "Every people wants it, the freedom." 
</P>
<P>
However, the statue's placement could still prove controversial. 
</P>
<P>
Within five feet of its torch waves a flag of Taiwan, adversary of mainland 
China. 
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't thought about that," said Van Sant as he peered at his creation. "It 
is a bit much isn't it? More controversy."

AWAITING MIRACLES;

<P>
FORMER BODYBUILDER BRINGS FAITH HEALING TO LATINO COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yiye Avila, a Puerto Rican bodybuilding champion turned evangelist, paced 
feverishly, microphone in hand, across the artificial turf nailed to the 
makeshift stage at the 50-yard line of the East Los Angeles College football 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
In a giant huddle at his feet -- under a scoreboard that announced "Christo 
Viene" (Christ Is Coming) -- nearly 1,000 ailing believers had gathered, some 
in wheelchairs, some on crutches, some with just hernias or hemorrhoids. Others 
were said to be dying from cancer, from heart disease, from AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Then, like a conductor who knows how to milk every last drop of emotion from 
his orchestra, the charismatic 63-year-old faith-healer closed his eyes, 
clenched his fists and pleaded for miracles to heal his followers. 
</P>
<P>
"Aleluyah. . . . Gracias, Jesus. . . . Gloria a Dios," he boomed in Spanish, 
crackling the public address speakers and unleashing a deafening cacophony of 
groans, moans, sobs and the indecipherable babble of tongues. 
</P>
<P>
"Glory to God. Out with the devil. In the name of Christ, be hea-ea-ealed." 
</P>
<P>
It is a scene that by Sunday will have been repeated 14 consecutive evenings at 
the Monterey Park stadium, where, along with the sick, an average of 10,000 
Latinos have gathered nightly to see Avila, whose sermons are broadcast on 61 
television channels and 258 radio stations throughout North, Central and South 
America. 
</P>
<P>
It is also a scene so extravagantly melodramatic that it is bound to fill the 
hearts of the devout with joy or the minds of skeptics with doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the solemnity of Catholicism that for centuries has been the spiritual 
staple of Latin America, the evangelistic crusades that Avila has led for three 
decades are raucous affairs where the idea is not quiet reflection, but 
witnessing tangible signs of the Lord's presence. 
</P>
<P>
As one of the faithful, 65-year-old Angela Baez, who suffers from a heart 
condition, put it last Friday: "I felt an incredible heat, something running 
through my body that left me trembling." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, every night from the sea of the infirm at least a few dozen souls burst 
forth to testify that they have been healed. 
</P>
<P>
Such was the case for Luis Magana, 83, an arthritic who in a moment of epiphany 
Friday threw down his walker and performed a jig to celebrate his newly found 
mobility. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone awaiting a miracle was so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
On the same night, none of the four people who came in wheelchairs was able to 
leave walking, including Cruz Carrasco, 19, a former football star at Roosevelt 
High School in East Los Angeles who was paralyzed 2 1/2 years ago in a drive-by 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Despite three people hoisting him, massaging his legs and chanting prayers, 
Carrasco took only a few painful steps before he slumped back teary-eyed into 
his chair. 
</P>
<P>
"I still have faith," said his mother, Ernelda Carrasco. "He could never even 
stand up like that before." 
</P>
<P>
All of which is taken in stride by Avila, known as Brother Yiye, who has 
carried his message of divine healing to 28 countries around the world, 
including four previous stops in Los Angeles since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Although he says he has helped cure thousands of people suffering from 
everything from ulcers to alcoholism to flat feet, Avila cautions that not 
everyone who attends his rallies will be healed. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends on the faith of the person," said Avila, a handsome man with 
chiseled features. 
</P>
<P>
Avila, who still lives in Camuy, the small Puerto Rican village where he was 
born, taught chemistry and biology for more than 20 years. He was also a 
champion weightlifter and bodybuilder who won the title of Mr. Puerto Rico in 
1952 and Mr. North America in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
A few years later, however, at the age of 34, Avila was overcome by rheumatoid 
arthritis that left him writhing in pain while training in his gymnasium. He 
began to read the Bible and pray. 
</P>
<P>
As he tells it, one night he was awakened by the vision of a man with 
shoulder-length hair dressed in a white robe entering his bedroom. The man 
lifted him from the bed and then gently set him back down again. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew that was the Lord in person calling me to serve him," Avila said. "I 
promised him that I would, and I woke up healed." 
</P>
<P>
His ardor was evident at East Los Angeles College as Avila's followers, who 
represent 50 Los Angeles-area churches, often swayed to his orations with their 
hands stretched open. 
</P>
<P>
Out of the crowd stepped one man, a 35-year-old lab assistant from Silverlake 
named Ramon, who said he tested positive for the AIDS virus last September. 
Avila placed his hand on the man's head and prayed. 
</P>
<P>
Several minutes later, Ramon picked up his Bible and left, vowing to visit his 
doctor to see if the virus had been expunged. 
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, it was embarrassing," he said. "But God comes first. I have faith."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOLIDAY CRASHES KILL AT LEAST 4 IN COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At least four people have been killed in Los Angeles County by motorists since 
the Fourth of July holiday weekend began, including a motorcyclist who died 
after colliding with a car on the San Diego Freeway on Monday, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The motorcycle-car collision occurred at 12:23 p.m. Monday in the southbound 
lanes of the San Diego Freeway at Venice Boulevard on the border of Los Angeles 
and Culver City, said California Highway Patrol Officer Monty Keifer. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police reported that three more people had died in accidents on 
city streets since the holiday weekend began Friday night. Seven people were 
killed on Los Angeles County roads over the Fourth of July weekend last year, 
said CHP Sgt. Mike Brey. The holiday weekend officially ends at midnight 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The victims included a 2 1/2-year-old child who was killed at 9:30 p.m. Sunday 
night at 41st Place and Main Street in Los Angeles by a hit-and-run driver, 
Officer Timothy Rolsen said. 
</P>
<P>
There have been nine holiday-related traffic fatalities on highways in Orange 
and San Diego counties, Brey said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FIREBOMBS DAMAGE THAI COUPLE'S HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three firebombs were hurled early Monday at a Northridge home where Buddhist 
services are held, igniting a fire that heavily damaged the house but injured 
no one, the Los Angeles Fire Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
The 3:23 a.m. fire in the 8300 block of Yolanda Avenue burned the wood-shingle 
roof and front windows of the house belonging to Pradit and Pachri 
Phongpharnich, authorities said. The couple and their two teen-age children 
escaped unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
Arson investigators and the Phongpharniches said they did not believe there was 
a link between the arson and the couple's religious activities. 
</P>
<P>
Pachri (Pat) Phongpharnich, who came with her husband to Southern California 
from Thailand 22 years ago, described herself as a Buddhist priest who uses the 
religious title "Rev. Man Hsi." She said she holds weekly meditation meetings 
at the house and at other homes in the San Fernando Valley.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ANIMAL CONTROL DEPT. GETS NEW DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The director of the Orlando Humane Society in Florida, who has a reputation for 
turning around troubled operations, has been tentatively hired to head Los 
Angeles County's beleaguered Department of Animal Care and Control. 
</P>
<P>
Frank R. Andrews, 57, will succeed Brian Berger, who resigned in May after the 
Board of Supervisors voted to remove him in the wake of allegations of 
mismanagement and reports of missing animals. 
</P>
<P>
Board chairman Ed Edelman said Andrews "has a history of taking departments 
that have had difficulties and turning them around. . . . He will be able to 
bring to Animal Control some needed management skills and relate to the outside 
groups that are concerned about care of animals." 
</P>
<P>
Andrews previously served as director of the Michigan Humane Society, where he 
oversaw animal control services in the Detroit area. He is a former city 
councilman from Galion, a small city outside Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews will take over the $75,000-a-year job Aug. 7, after expected 
supervisors' approval Wednesday. The department operates six animal shelters 
that handle about 95,000 animals a year.

Just three weeks ago, Los Angeles Police Sgt. Alexander Gomez was the picture 
of dejection. 
</P>
<P>
He was the one who came up with the idea of throwing a benefit concert for the 
Police Department's Hollenbeck Youth Center, a gym for the children of East Los 
Angeles that was created 12 years ago by the Hollenbeck Division station and 
local business owners. 
</P>
<P>
It was also Gomez who had the audacity to ask Linda Ronstadt to sing. When she 
accepted, the duty fell on Gomez to sell 30,000 tickets to the Fourth of July 
weekend spectacular at Cal State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
That's when the sergeant's outlook began to sour. With only three weeks to go, 
sales were stalled at about 3,000 tickets and Gomez was beginning to have 
nightmares about Ronstadt singing before nearly empty stands at the 
university's track field. 
</P>
<P>
Having hit bottom, Gomez, 43, sat glumly over a burrito in a Mexican cafe 
across from the Hollenbeck police station on East 1st Street, facing his 
imminent humiliation. 
</P>
<P>
"Why in the world am I doing this?" the 20-year police veteran asked. "It's so 
much easier for me to go out on patrol and put my suspect in jail and go home." 
</P>
<P>
But then, a Times story about Gomez's plight touched off a response that the 
streetwise officer is finding difficult to comprehend. The day after its 
publication, hundreds of people called the police station to offer help. 
</P>
<P>
"People took chunks of 50, 100, 200, 500 tickets," Gomez said. "They went to 
their organizations and started selling them." 
</P>
<P>
The management of a hospital and a department store took tickets that they sold 
through their employees. 
</P>
<P>
An anonymous donor bought several thousand and instructed Gomez to give them to 
those who could not afford the $10 admission. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the stands were packed for both Saturday and Sunday concerts. 
Gomez estimates that the event will net $150,000 for the youth center. 
</P>
<P>
The success had Gomez soaring Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just an incredible response," he said. "It kind of makes you feel good, 
that people really care out there. 
</P>
<P>
"If we could do this again next year, on a bigger scale . . . " he mused. 
"Every city across the country could put together something like this on the 
same night, and the money from each city would be donated to specific youth 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are just thoughts," he said. "Imagination." DOUG SMITH

THEOLOGICAL DEBATE TAKES EARTHLY TURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
San Fernando Mission and Laurel Canyon boulevards in Pacoima is a popular spot 
for "cruisers" in sleek, customized cars who hang out at fast-food outlets on 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
The cruisers draw "born-again" Christian missionaries, who have made a personal 
crusade of spreading the gospel among young people who congregate there. 
</P>
<P>
The mix of cruise night and evangelism led to violence Sunday, when a 
spontaneous religious debate between missionaries and Roman Catholic youths 
escalated into a brawl, which left each side nursing bruises and blaming the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
Alma Bolanos and her boyfriend, Albert Rabago, both 19, were out in Rabago's 
1966 Mustang with fellow members of the Styling Classics Mustang Club, 
celebrating the first big cruising weekend of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Also on hand were Henry and Patricia Chacon, 24 and 28, their 3-year-old 
daughter and about 25 other members of the Praise Chapel Christian Fellowship 
of Sun Valley. For the past several years, the "born-again" Christians have 
preached their beliefs to the cruisers without incident, Henry Chacon said. 
</P>
<P>
"We pray for people who are hurting," Henry Chacon said. "Every time we find a 
cruise scene, we're out there. We'll talk to anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Bolanos, a former contestant in the Miss San Fernando contest, wore sunglasses 
Monday to cover a black eye and scratched and swollen face. She said that in 
the confrontation in a parking lot outside the Pollo Gordo restaurant, the 
Chacons and other Christians insulted her religion and made insinuations about 
her personal morality. 
</P>
<P>
Bolanos acknowledged that she struck first, using her sandal to swat Henry 
Chacon, but claimed that she reacted to extreme provocation. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me I was Satan," Bolanos said. "They said I was lost and they had 
been found." 
</P>
<P>
At least three of the "born-again" Christians then attacked her, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Rabago said: "It doesn't make any sense. If they're really Christians, why are 
they hitting girls"? 
</P>
<P>
Chacon said he and his wife were the victims and that he also has a black eye, 
inflicted by Rabago, to prove it. He said he was trying to pull Bolanos off his 
wife when Rabago punched him. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy socked me in the eye with all he had," Chacon said. "I said, 'That was 
a cheap shot. But I still love you, man.' " 
</P>
<P>
Rabago said he punched Henry Chacon to defend his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
The Chacons said they were only trying to restrain Bolanos when she attacked 
Patricia Chacon after striking Henry Chacon. Patricia Chacon admitted 
scratching Bolanos after pleading with her to let go of her hair. 
</P>
<P>
Police are investigating a complaint filed by Bolanos, but they have few 
details about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
The Chacons said Bolanos and other teen-agers willingly took part in an 
extended and energetic street corner theological debate. 
</P>
<P>
Bolanos, who wears a crucifix and attends Guardian Angel Catholic Church in 
Pacoima, said the conversation touched on a range of topics, including how God 
can allow starvation in Ethiopia and the relative merits of Catholicism versus 
"born-again" Protestantism. 
</P>
<P>
But she said she talked with the street preachers only because they were 
irritatingly persistent. Her boyfriend is a Catholic but, she said, "told them 
he was an atheist so they would leave him alone, but they wouldn't." 
</P>
<P>
Bolanos said she was offended when the Chacons criticized Catholic practices, 
such as confession, and made comments insinuating she was a "street kid." 
</P>
<P>
"If I go to church, why would they say I'm lost?" Bolanos said. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Chacon denied that her group said anything derogatory about Bolanos or 
Catholicism. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not out there to condemn people, we're there to comfort them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bolanos said: "It's false advertising. They're not peaceful people. I was born 
Catholic, raised Catholic and I'm gonna die Catholic."

FIRST LADIES GET CORNER SPOT IN HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELE FUETSCH, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Presidents get their own libraries. John Kennedy's overlooks Boston Harbor. 
Franklin Roosevelt's overlooks the Hudson River. Ronald Reagan wanted his at 
Stanford University, but he had to settle for Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
And presidential wives? They get a corner in the Cerritos Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
It is believed to be the only municipal book depository in the country 
dedicated to the nation's First Ladies and containing a First Ladies 
Collection. The section was created at the behest of local women, who insisted 
that the library, built in 1973, memorialize the contributions of women to 
community life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
National Enquirer Clippings 
</P>
<P>
Forget that much of the archival material -- most notably that about Jacqueline 
Kennedy Onassis -- consists of clippings from the National Enquirer. 
</P>
<P>
Forget that under a picture of Mary Harrison someone put the date of her death 
as four years before she married Benjamin. 
</P>
<P>
In Cerritos one can quickly find out what kind of woman married Calvin Coolidge 
-- a man so aloof that humorist Dorothy Parker, upon learning he was dead, 
quipped, "How can they tell?" 
</P>
<P>
Grace Coolidge, according to her biographer, was a "lively extrovert" and a 
teacher of deaf children who as First Lady became their spokeswoman and helped 
secure them a right to education. 
</P>
<P>
In Cerritos you can find out almost as quickly which of the nation's First 
Ladies had a degree in geology and spoke Mandarin Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
It was one of five languages spoken by Lou Henry Hoover, who met her 
mining-engineer husband, Herbert, at Stanford University and after their 
marriage followed him to China where he worked. 
</P>
<P>
Want to know how Presidents romanced First Ladies? Look to the collection for 
two books of love letters by Woodrow Wilson -- to first wife, Ellen, and second 
wife, Edith. Wilson called both of them "my own darling." 
</P>
<P>
Soap opera writers in search of new material can check out "Cannibals of the 
Heart," a title that at least sounds more titillating than the "The Guiding 
Light." 
</P>
<P>
"Cannibals" chronicles the "Who's-Afraid-of-Virginia-Woolf"-like marriage of 
John Quincy Adams and wife, Louisa, whose sense of identity within the 
illustrious Adams family was so fragile that she titled her diary "The 
Adventures of a Nobody" and once suggested that "hanging and marriage" were a 
lot alike. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accommodations to History 
</P>
<P>
The First Ladies Committee of the Friends of the Cerritos Library realized, 
though, when it began hanging First Lady portraits on the library walls that it 
would have to make some accommodations to history. 
</P>
<P>
Presidents often had more than one wife so the committee decreed that its 
portrait gallery be open to all presidential wives, not just First Ladies. 
</P>
<P>
The gallery includes Rachael Jackson, the love of Andrew's life, who was buried 
in the gown she would have worn to the Inaugural Ball. She became ill and died 
before her husband could take the oath of office. 
</P>
<P>
The presidential wives' designation also explains why Alice Roosevelt and 
Caroline Fillmore made it to the wall of the library, if not to the White 
House. Alice died 17 years before husband, Teddy, and his second wife, Edith, 
moved to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Caroline did not marry Millard Fillmore until 
five years after he and first wife, Abigail, who later died, moved out. But 
there is no picture yet of actress Jane Wyman, the first presidential ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
Some friends of the library, said Annette Creasy, a founding member of the 
library auxiliary group, have privately pondered the Wyman issue. The group is 
sensitive, Creasy said, to rumors that there might be a "rift" between Reagan's 
first wife, Wyman, and Nancy Reagan. The issue, Creasy suggested, will probably 
be resolved after everyone involved is dead. 
</P>
<P>
The First Ladies collection -- 170 books, 41 gold-framed pictures, six 
scrapbooks of news clippings and memorabilia that includes a pale pink leather 
handbag that belonged to Mamie Eisenhower -- is a mother lode of First Family 
trivia. 
</P>
<P>
Among the books: "Dog Days at the White House: The Outrageous Memoirs of the 
Presidential Kennel Keeper." Among the news clippings: a story about Margaret 
Wilson, daughter of Woodrow. She moved to India and joined a religious cult. 
</P>
<P>
Julie Eisenhower's biography of mother Pat Nixon is in the book collection, 
along with a tell-all tome about her called the "Lonely Lady of San Clemente." 
For real First Lady pathos, though, read "The Insanity File." It is about Mary 
Todd Lincoln's commitment to an asylum in her later years. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Nixon's tenure in the White House helped spur the city to dedicate its 
library to First Ladies. Richard Nixon's wife spent part of her high school 
days in Cerritos when it was still called Dairy Valley. And, until the 
Watergate scandal when an unknown arsonist burned it down, the house in which 
she lived stood in the South Street park named for her. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council accepted the idea of establishing the collection, Creasy said, 
only after the women played up the Pat Nixon connection and did research to 
show that Cerritos would be the only city that dedicated its library to First 
Ladies and had a First Ladies collection inside.

<P>
Vowing to capitalize on the momentum created by Monday's U.S. Supreme Court 
ruling on abortion, about 125 anti-abortion activists in Orange County 
celebrated the news with a flag-waving and prayer-filled rally outside the 
Fullerton office of Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-La Habra). 
</P>
<P>
About two dozen angry and dejected pro-choice activists also descended on the 
office to vent their feelings, but the groups kept their distance, so the day 
remained peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
"The day of the unborn is here," the Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, chairman of the 
Orange County-based Traditional Values Coalition, declared to cheers and cries 
of "Amen!" from anti-abortion activists holding placards reading, "Thank You 
Lord for This Victory in Life" and "Feminazis Go Home." 
</P>
<P>
While Monday's decision did not reverse the high court's 1973 ruling legalizing 
abortion, Sheldon told the crowd that because the court freed states to impose 
sharp restrictions on abortion, "Roe has lost its feathers, its wings and its 
limbs." 
</P>
<P>
Pro-choice activists, however, suggested that they were not about to concede. 
Newport Beach resident Molly Lyon criticized the court for handing down the 
decision on the eve of Independence Day, calling the timing "absolutely 
obscene." 
</P>
<P>
"Sandra Day O'Connor is a man," Lyon said. "If she were a woman, she wouldn't 
have voted that way." 
</P>
<P>
Abortion foes would have been invigorated whatever Monday's ruling, said Patti 
Headland-Wauson, a pro-choice activist and organizer of clinic defenders, who 
had hoped for a larger turnout at Johnson's office. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not thrilled, believe me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The rallies were perhaps the most vivid display of emotions in the county over 
the Supreme Court's ruling, as residents -- like those across the country -- 
mulled the decision and looked ahead with concern or hope. 
</P>
<P>
Some called the decision a curse. Others called it a blessing. Still others 
said only time will tell. But few seemed to be without an opinion on an issue 
that has divided the county, much as it has the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Pro-choice advocates in the county took the Supreme Court decision hard but 
vowed that in the months to come, they will push their beliefs all the more 
forcefully in the political arena. 
</P>
<P>
"It means we need to press our point a little harder, a little more vocally," 
said Margie Fites Seigle, executive director of Planned Parenthood in Orange 
and San Bernardino counties. "We will do that by encouraging pro-choice persons 
to write to their legislators, to let them know that reproductive rights should 
remain a choice for all women in California." 
</P>
<P>
She said her frustration at the decision turns to anger when she considers the 
"two-tiered" health system that could develop across the country as a result. 
Women who can afford to travel to states that allow abortions will still be 
able to obtain them, she predicted, "but once again, it will be the poor women 
that are hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Locally, she foresaw little change. "Those who believe in the right of choice 
will continue to offer choices," she said, noting that Planned Parenthood plans 
to expand services in the county to include abortion as well as contraception 
and prenatal care. 
</P>
<P>
In the Costa Mesa office of Planned Parenthood, the reaction was equally 
heated. Workers said they had heard the news along with several women arriving 
for appointments, on a waiting-room TV. 
</P>
<P>
"The patients were very upset," said Dana McKinney, a registered nurse 
practitioner. "The common question from them all was, 'How is that going to 
affect me?' " 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Stewart, another nurse practitioner, said she fears that the court's 
decision will eventually usher in further restrictions on abortion, creating an 
atmosphere in which teen-agers would "go to a back-street clinic or try to do 
it themselves with a coat hanger." 
</P>
<P>
"There has to be a choice," Stewart said. "People talk about the United States 
and our freedoms. Is it really there with this sort of thing?" 
</P>
<P>
Anti-abortion activists, meanwhile, basked in what most termed an 
unquestionable victory. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Adler, pastor of Stone Mountain Church in Laguna Hills and an 
anti-abortion leader, said Monday's ruling inflicted "a mortal wound" to Roe 
vs. Wade, the historic 1973 finding that a woman's constitutional right of 
privacy includes the right to choose abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"Roe is on her last leg now," Adler said. "Probably by next year, she will be 
vanquished. We didn't get all we wanted, but it came out pretty good for us." 
</P>
<P>
"The lines are definitely drawn as to what you believe and how much you believe 
in it," said Jeri Muth of Tustin, an abortion foe who has participated in 
recent blockades of family-planning clinics organized by the New York-based 
Operation Rescue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a victory for America," said Dan Flores, 32, a fundamentalist Christian 
who handed out flags during the rally at Johnson's office, which was closed for 
the legislative holiday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're chipping away at the foundation of the abortion system," said Donald 
Smith of Anaheim, producer of the anti-abortion film "The Silent Scream." 
</P>
<P>
"We can see the light at the end of the tunnel." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County-based leaders of Operation Rescue in Southern California -- a 
group opposed to abortions that has pushed the issue into the headlines with 
blockades of many Southland family-planning clinics in recent months -- said 
Monday's decision will help draw new supporters and bolster their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pleased to see the court has taken a significant step toward the 
protection of women from exploitation and their children from murder," said 
Russell Neal, a group spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Neal predicted that Operation Rescue will escalate its blockades at various 
clinics in the months to come and that pastors will probably be put under 
increasing pressure to take a stand on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Participants will also aid other anti-abortion activists in pushing for state 
legislation and candidates who support their views, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The national organization, based in Binghamton, New York, will try Saturday to 
blockade an undisclosed Southern California clinic. A rally will precede the 
operation at 7 p.m. Friday night at the First Church of the Nazarene in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon, meanwhile, said he envisions his group and other anti-abortion 
activists pressing for a state ballot initiative in 1990, with an eye toward 
outlawing public funding for abortions in California. 
</P>
<P>
He also expressed hope that the decision would help revitalize legislation 
requiring juveniles to get parental consent for an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he predicted that conservative forces will continue to seek major 
restrictions on state money for abortions and related services, will seek 
stricter health standards for practicing clinics and will push for "fathers of 
the unborn" to argue their cases in court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Civil Rights of the Unborn' 
</P>
<P>
"We're calling for all groups across this country who stood for civil rights to 
stand up for the civil rights of the unborn," Sheldon said. "We believe a lot 
of good is going to come out of the Supreme Court's decision." 
</P>
<P>
Several state and federal lawmakers from the county were equally bullish on the 
court decision, saying it will ultimately bring a new era of reduced state 
funding for abortions in California. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) said he hopes that Monday's ruling 
will persuade the state Supreme Court to reverse itself and give a green light 
to the ongoing efforts of state legislators to restrict the use of public money 
for abortions. During the last decade, lawmakers have voted narrowly each year 
to cut off such money, but the court has disallowed it. 
</P>
<P>
"For the future, we Californians are probably going to see a significant change 
in the use of state tax dollars to finance abortions," said Dannemeyer, who 
opposes abortion. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) agreed, saying the ruling "changes 
the whole ballgame" on the issue of public money for abortions in California. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Good Deal of Debate' 
</P>
<P>
"I think we'll probably find a good deal of debate on the issue," said 
Bergeson, an ardent foe of abortion. "There undoubtably will be legislation for 
both sides of the issue and a good deal of confrontation. . . . Personally, I 
think the restrictions are necessary. It is in keeping with the wishes of the 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Several pro-choice advocates, however, maintained that the Supreme Court 
decision will have virtually no impact in California because of tough privacy 
provisions in the state Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
"Politically, I hate to see the opinion," said Ron Talmo, a law professor and 
civil rights lawyer, "because I think a woman should have an absolute right to 
her choice. 
</P>
<P>
"But legally, for California, it means absolutely zero. It has absolutely no 
meaning here in California as far as the current state of our law."

'IF YOU'RE PUTTING A COMBUSTIBLE IN THE HANDS OF A CHILD, IS THAT SAFE OR SANE? 
IT JUST DOESN'T FIT.' -- CAPT. HANK RAYMOND,ORANGE COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT; 
</P>
<P>
SENTIMENT BURNS IN SOME TO COMPLETE THE BANNING OF FIREWORKS

Independence Day may be filled with fireworks, but Nancy Corcoran of Costa Mesa 
no longer wants anything to do with sparklers, Piccolo Petes or Ground Bloom 
Flowers. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, she has stopped volunteering at a local soccer club's stand in Costa 
Mesa selling the "safe and sane" fireworks. She has seen what their contents 
can do. 
</P>
<P>
Her son, Christopher Doyen, 17, suffered second-degree facial burns Sunday 
after he and a younger brother emptied the contents of a dozen Piccolo Petes 
into a plastic box and ignited the powder with a match, police said. The box 
exploded in Christopher's face, making the youth Orange County's first 
fireworks victim this year. 
</P>
<P>
"We will throw all our fireworks out," Corcoran vowed Monday, moments after her 
son returned home from an overnight stay at UCI Medical Center in Orange. 
"After you see all the pain and all . . . we went through, I don't want to see 
another firework again." 
</P>
<P>
Corcoran said her son is fortunate to be home to celebrate the Fourth of July. 
Christopher's face was badly burned and his eyebrows singed, but his eyesight 
was unaffected, his mother said. He avoided further injury by not inhaling the 
lung-choking powder found in the cylindrical fireworks that emit a piercing 
whistle and a shower of sparks when lighted. Nor will scars remain on her son's 
face, doctors told her. 
</P>
<P>
But other Orange County residents, most of them children, haven't been so lucky 
in years past. Some have had their fingers or hands blown off by legally 
obtained fireworks. Others have suffered long-term eye damage or severe burns 
on their faces, arms, legs and feet. 
</P>
<P>
There were 29 fireworks-related injuries reported in Orange County hospitals 
from June 17 to July 16 last year, the peak fireworks season, and 278 in the 
state, according to the state fire marshal. But those numbers are thought to be 
"the tip of the iceberg," said state Fire Prevention Engineer Ed Seits, because 
many injuries are either treated at home or at facilities that do not have to 
report to Sacramento. Other estimates in the county range from 50 to 106. 
</P>
<P>
"We teach kids not to play with fire or fireworks," said Fountain Valley Fire 
Chief Richard Jorgensen, former president of the Orange County Fire Chiefs 
Assn. "Yet, in the frenzy of celebrating the Fourth of July, we put dangerous 
fireworks in their hands. We're saying it's OK to use them and risk injury." 
</P>
<P>
Jorgensen and others who oppose fireworks other than in controlled settings say 
they don't want to see injuries continue as another Fourth of July tradition. 
However, those who support the use of "safe and sane" fireworks say they are 
part of the holiday, and that more supervision and knowledge is needed to 
prevent injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"Safe and sane" fireworks, a term used by the state fire marshal to describe 
fireworks that cannot explode or fly into the air, are legal in only seven 
Orange County cities: Buena Park, Costa Mesa, Fullerton, Garden Grove, Orange, 
Santa Ana and Westminster. They are banned in unincorporated Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say such fireworks are neither safe nor sane. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Safe and sane' is a misnomer," said Jorgensen, who successfully lobbied for 
the ban of fireworks sales in his city. "I have personal problems with that. 
There are those called 'safe and sane' which can cause almost the same kind of 
damage as illegal ones." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
County Fire Captain's View 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Fire Department Capt. Hank Raymond made his point with the aide 
of a dictionary. 
</P>
<P>
Fireworks are "explosives or combustibles," he said, reading from a dictionary. 
Safe, he said, means "free from injury." And sane implies making a "sound 
judgment." 
</P>
<P>
"The words have the opposite effect," Raymond said. "If you're putting a 
combustible in the hands of a child, is that safe or sane? It just doesn't 
fit." 
</P>
<P>
In Christopher Doyen's case, his mother said he did not use the fireworks as 
directed. 
</P>
<P>
"He feels it was a wrong thing to do," Corcoran said. "He shouldn't have been 
fooling around with them. They used them like they shouldn't have." 
</P>
<P>
Licensed pyrotechnists and fireworks manufacturers say parents must educate 
their children about the dangers of fireworks and that they must supervise them 
and encourage safe practices. "If you use them as they're designed to be used, 
they're basically harmless," contended Jim Souza of Pyro Spectaculars, a Rialto 
company that staged fireworks for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and the 1986 
Statue of Liberty centennial. "It's when people throw them or place them where 
they don't belong that you have problems." 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, no one under 18 may buy fireworks where they are legal. But 
often fireworks wind up in the hands of those who don't know the dangers. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, in the third year of drought, dry roofs and shrubs are 
particularly vulnerable to fire, officials point out. But buildings and plants 
can be replaced, they said. Fireworks-related injuries can carry long-term 
scars that make it difficult for victims to lead normal lives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Such Thing as Safe' 
</P>
<P>
Several families declined to talk about injuries to loved ones, but those who 
work with fireworks victims say injuries have ranged from shattered fingers and 
hands, from fireworks being held at the moment of ignition, to eye injuries 
from flying sparks. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no such thing as a safe firework," said Caryl Modrinski, executive 
director of the Orange County Burn Assn., an education and support group that 
works with patients in UCI Medical Center's burn unit. She said many injuries 
occur when people tamper with fireworks, either by opening packages or mixing 
powder with other substances. 
</P>
<P>
Burn patients from such mishaps have a difficult time recovering 
psychologically, especially in a beauty-oriented society, Modrinksi said. 
</P>
<P>
"Initially, you've lost your identity," she said. "That's very hard for a child 
to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
Sue Martinez, nursing manager of UCI Medical Center's burn unit, has worked 
with patients injured by fireworks. "I have yet to see any argument for them 
that makes sense," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the so-called "safe and sane" fireworks, sparklers are the most 
dangerous, County Fire Department Capt. Raymond said. Seemingly harmless, they 
burn at more than 1,000 degrees and cause about 30% of all fireworks injuries, 
he said. They are also a fire hazard. A sparkler ignited the largest fire in 
Tustin's history, destroying a 90-unit apartment complex in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Illegal fireworks, many of them imported from China and Taiwan, include 
inch-long firecrackers, which can cause severe hand injuries, and M-200s, which 
have enough explosive force to blow off a finger, experts said. Those convicted 
of using such illegal fireworks face a fine of up to $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Out of Control' 
</P>
<P>
Although proponents of legal fireworks argue that lack of precaution by a few 
ruins festivities for others, county and state fire officials won't be 
satisfied until fireworks are banned everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
People sometimes lose their sense of judgment in the passion of celebrating the 
nation's birthday, Jorgensen said. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets to be out of control," he said. "With a little lack of control, people 
behave as they normally wouldn't. Some people wouldn't think of doing such 
things at other times." 
</P>
<P>
One problem, Jorgensen said, is that fireworks may be purchased by mail from 
states where all fireworks are legal. In Orange County, people who live in 
cities where "safe and sane" fireworks are outlawed can walk across the street 
to legal stands, he pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, fire officials urge people to attend the large municipal-sponsored 
firework displays run by licensed pyrotechnists scheduled throughout the county 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond advised those planning to use legal fireworks to read instructions 
carefully, keep a bucket of water nearby, refrain from taking fireworks apart, 
watch for duds and avoid holding fireworks while they are discharging. 
</P>
<P>
"Some say it's our right to celebrate our independence," Jorgensen said. "But 
while we do that, we burn other people's homes and we injure people. We should 
use more respect on our most important national holiday."

FRIENDSHIP FLIGHT: TONY CIRCLES THE GLOBE;

<P>
When a chase plane for 11-year-old Tony Aliengena landed ahead of him in this 
Siberian military capital on Monday, a crowd of waiting Soviet citizens did not 
even notice that the boy aviator was not aboard. 
</P>
<P>
They rushed to the twin-engine plane and began handing out pink roses, post 
cards and souvenir pins to the five Americans aboard, vigorously pumping their 
hands and practicing their English. 
</P>
<P>
"These people have not ever seen Americans," said Luba Popova, an English 
teacher in Omsk, which has been closed to foreigners since World War II because 
it is a weapons manufacturing center. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 Siberians withstood sultry, 85-degree heat to see and touch the 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The encounters were even more special because Tony, of San Juan Capistrano, is 
flying around the world on a friendship mission. 
</P>
<P>
At a youth camp outside Tumen, where the Americans spent their first day in 
Soviet Siberia on Sunday, a young man watching three Americans in a shallow 
stream walked over and handed them three yellow flowers he had picked. With a 
handshake and a shy smile, he said, "Mir," which means peace. 
</P>
<P>
In both Tumen and Omsk, the residents showered Tony and his entourage with 
bouquets of flowers, presented them with food and gifts and collected 
autographs from every member of flight crew. 
</P>
<P>
While Tony had received large receptions in other Soviet cities, the Siberian 
welcome far overshadowed the others. 
</P>
<P>
In Tumen and Omsk, buses shuttling the entourage to and from airports received 
police escorts, with officers using flashing lights and loudspeakers to clear 
traffic from the road. 
</P>
<P>
In Tumen, a crowd of more than 400 people, by far the largest of the trip, 
applauded when Tony's Cessna 210 Centurion, and a Beechcraft King Air piloted 
by San Joaquin Valley surgeon Lance Allyn, taxied to a stop. Dozens of Young 
Pioneers -- children enrolled in the Communist Party youth group -- waved 
Soviet flags. 
</P>
<P>
"I just think it is an event of an epoch," teacher Popova said. 
</P>
<P>
The 20,000-mile journey reached its midpoint Sunday when the entourage flew 700 
miles from Kuibyshev to Tumen. The occasion was not lost on Tony, who radioed 
this message to Allyn after they crossed the halfway point just east of the 
5,000-foot Ural Mountains: "We would like to congratulate everyone on the 
flight for making it halfway around the world." 
</P>
<P>
His father, Gary Aliengena, later added, "We're on our way home." 
</P>
<P>
Two other milestones were marked Sunday: It was the group's entry into the 
Asian continent, which is separated from Soviet Europe by the Urals. And it was 
the 11th birthday of Tony's pen pal, Roman Tchermenykh, who is accompanying him 
on the trip. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Happy Birthday, Roman 
</P>
<P>
Members of the entourage in the chase plane sang happy birthday to Roman, who 
also sang. 
</P>
<P>
In crossing the Urals, the planes had to deal with a line of threatening 
thunderstorms. Tony did so by reducing his altitude from 11,000 to 5,000 feet. 
Allyn descended to 17,000 from 19,000. After they crossed the Urals, the 
weather cleared enough to allow a first glimpse at Soviet Asia, where forests 
of light pine sprawled across flatlands interlaced by swamps and lakes. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, Soviet members of the entourage familiar with Tumen warned of 
the legendary mosquitoes there. 
</P>
<P>
"You know that Tumen is famous for its mosquitoes -- big ones, as big as your 
finger," said Jouri Vasiliev, a Soviet navigator aboard the chase plane. 
</P>
<P>
Aleksie Grinevich, a Soviet correspondent with the flight, agreed: "The 
mosquitoes are as big as eagles." 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, Tumen was crawling with mosquitoes. Even on the hot pavement of 
the Tumen airport, the Americans slapped at mosquitoes with one hand while 
shaking hands with the other. That night, while the Americans swam in a river, 
swarms attacked everything from the lips to the eyes. 
</P>
<P>
The trip was also marred by evidence of fraying nerves. After an hour of 
confusion at the Tumen airport, Gary Aliengena implored his hosts in a strained 
voice: "We have not eaten all day. We're tired and hungry." 
</P>
<P>
But Allyn had disappeared from the landing area, forcing a bus carrying 
everyone else to wait in the heat. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's go," Aliengena said. "Let's leave him." 
</P>
<P>
When Allyn, who had sought relief from the heat inside the airport, showed up, 
Tony's father barked, "We've been cooking here for 25 minutes!" 
</P>
<P>
"Well, in all fairness, Gary," Allyn said, "we've had to wait for you a helluva 
lot of times." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the bus took the entourage and Soviets, some of whom had traveled up 
to 200 miles to meet Tony, to a Young Pioneers camp, where about 300 children 
greeted them with banners and chants of "Hello, Tony! Hello, Tony!" 
</P>
<P>
He and his family listened from a second-story balcony of a camp building, with 
Tony waving like a small emperor. 
</P>
<P>
The group dined at the camp on telmeny, a Siberian dish made from boiled dough 
stuffed with meat, and drank kvass, a sweet drink made from yeast and water. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Camps Help Families 
</P>
<P>
During the meal, Galina Korotayeva, an English teacher who was host for Tony's 
group in Tumen, said such Young Pioneer camps are all over the Soviet Union and 
are designed to help working families during the summer. Children may enroll 
for three weeks for a small fee. 
</P>
<P>
Later, when Tony and the other children had all gone to bed, his father, mother 
and sister were treated to a session at a Siberian steam bath made from 
15th-Century cedar and scented with pepperment leaves. By adding extra logs, 
Victor Tchernovnikov, the camp director, made the bath so hot that some of the 
Americans ran out for relief. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, on the two-hour flight to Omsk, the "friendship flight" 
encountered cloudless skies and ideal flying conditions. The skies were so 
clear that, for the first time since leaving Orange County on June 5, Tony 
spotted Allyn's King Air flying 4,000 feet above him. 
</P>
<P>
The route took the two planes over East Central Siberia's dense forest and the 
Trans-Siberian Railway. In Omsk, an industrial river port city of 1.3 million, 
a young Soviet boy delivered a welcoming speech. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony, we are happy that you are here," the boy said. "If children of our two 
countries are friends, then peace will be stronger. We wish you soft landings 
and peace." 
</P>

FETUS KILLED IN CRASH AS SUSPECT FLEES

A drunk driver fleeing a traffic accident critically injured a woman who was 
crossing a street in Santa Ana, killing her 7-month-old unborn baby, and then 
sped from that accident too, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Felipe Garcia, 20, of Santa Ana, had collided with a car at 1st and Euclid 
streets in Santa Ana at 11:55 p.m. and was speeding away when he struck Gudelia 
Calvan, 29, as she stepped off the center divider in the 3900 block of 1st 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
Two Santa Ana police officers saw the accident. One rushed to help the woman, 
while the other chased Garcia a short distance and arrested him. No one was 
injured in the first accident. 
</P>
<P>
Calvan on Monday was in "very critical condition with multiple broken bones," 
said Hong Nguyen, nursing supervisor at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The baby was pronounced dead after an emergency Cesarean shortly after 
midnight, Nguyen said. 
</P>
<P>
The officer who arrested Garcia said he was extremely drunk, police spokesman 
Cliff Seward said. Garcia was arrested on suspicion of hit-and-run and felony 
drunk driving, and was taken to Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
As of 5 p.m. Monday, the California Highway Patrol had arrested 102 people on 
suspicion of drunk driving in Orange County since the holiday weekend began, 
contrasted with 93 during all of last year's three-day holiday weekend, CHP 
Officer Matt Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
"From trends so far, we will far exceed the number of (drunk driving) arrests 
of last year," Clark said. "The weekend holiday is not over, and we will 
continue to aggressively enforce the laws affecting drinking drivers."

TOWER WAS NOT AT FAULT IN NEAR MISS, TAPE SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A tape recording of conversation between the John Wayne Airport control tower 
and a private pilot shows that the controller gave proper instructions just 
before the pilot made a wrong turn Friday afternoon and nearly collided with a 
Continental Airlines jet over Newport Beach, an air traffic controller said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The incident was the first near-miss of 1989 for the Federal Aviation 
Administration's control tower at John Wayne, said Douglas Kingsbury, the 
National Air Traffic Controllers Assn. representative at the tower. 
</P>
<P>
"The tape has been played, and the Beechcraft pilot was definitely told to turn 
left, but he turned right," Kingsbury said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the tape recording also showed that the Beechcraft pilot never 
acknowledged the controller's left-turn instruction, Kingsbury added. 
</P>
<P>
Continental's Flight 176 -- a Boeing 737 carrying 132 passengers to Denver -- 
was forced to turn suddenly to avoid the smaller, single-engine Beechcraft 
Bonanza, FAA officials said. The two aircraft passed within 100 feet, the 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The jetliner had just left the runway, after the takeoff of the slower 
Beechcraft. 
</P>
<P>
FAA officials declined to release the name of the Beechcraft pilot pending 
results of the agency's investigation. FAA spokeswoman Elly Brekke said she did 
not know if the Beechcraft pilot had yet been interviewed as part of the 
inquiry, nor what disciplinary action, if any, usually follows such incidents. 
She said the agency is still investigating the possibility that the pilot 
misheard the "turn left" instruction as something like "turn west" or "head 
west." 
</P>
<P>
The FAA investigators conducting the investigation could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
The John Wayne tower handles aircraft in the immediate vicinity of the airport, 
unlike the FAA's troubled, understaffed Coast Terminal Radar Approach Control 
facility at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>

Poor working conditions and understaffing at Coast TRACON have led to an error

more than twice that of TRACON facilities in Seattle, Ontario and Sacramento.

On May 7, Coast TRACON alerted pilots in time to avoid three separate midair

OFFER BY D.A. PROMPTS GUILTY PLEA TO MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Swayed by a favorable offer from prosecutors, a Lido Isle man pleaded guilty 
Monday to first-demurder in the killing of his wife's ex-lover, who was gunned 
down outside a Yorba Linda convenience store on Christmas night last year. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick M. McBurney, 26, faces 27 years to life in prison when he returns to 
Orange County Superior Court on Aug. 2 for sentencing in the murder of Lance 
Michael Roney, 23. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement struck over the weekend, prosecutors agreed to drop an 
allegation that McBurney had lain in wait for his prospective victim -- an 
allegation that could have meant life in prison without the possibility of 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
"We got an offer from the D.A. on Friday morning and we decided it was a good 
one," explained defense attorney Ronald K. Perry of San Pedro. "We had a very 
genuine fear that (McBurney) could spend the rest of his natural life behind 
bars." Now, however, McBurney may be paroled in about 17 years, his lawyer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Deputy Dist. Atty. Jill Roberts, "We're satisfied that the case was 
resolved fairly for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers on both sides described the motive in the killing as revenge. 
</P>
<P>
A computer analyst in a small firm, McBurney became enraged when he learned 
that his wife had a brief affair with a co-worker and that she was planning to 
leave McBurney and take their 2-year-old daughter with her, Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
"That caused him to lose all reason, and he shot the lover," Perry said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was shot in the head and chest on Christmas night outside a 7-Eleven 
store in the 19000 block of Yorba Linda Boulevard. Roney was flown to a 
hospital, where he was later pronounced dead. McBurney was arrested without 
incident the next morning.

FIREWORKS MAY HAVE SPARKED 3 BLAZES ON ROOFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three small roof fires Monday at adjacent homes in Seal Beach were probably 
related to fireworks, but the cause remains under investigation, fire officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The first fire was reported at 5:37 p.m. at 4424 Elder Ave., a county fire 
spokesman said. Moderate damage was reported to the roof and attic, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two adjacent roofs suffered similar damage in the three-alarm incident, 
officials said, after they were apparently ignited by sparks from the first 
house. No injuries were reported.

REVENGE QUICK FOR ANGELS; 
</P>
<P>
JEFFCOAT EXITS EARLY THIS TIME ; ABBOTT GETS 5-2 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a night when Devon White, the man who never met an outside pitch he didn't 
like, set a personal best with three walks in three at-bats, the Angels learned 
again that good things come to those who wait. 
</P>
<P>
Shut out on five hits by the Texas Rangers' Mike Jeffcoat last month in 
Arlington, the Angels returned home Monday night for a rematch with the 
Rangers' left-hander -- and scored a knockout in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
Turning three walks and two hits into three quick runs, the Angels disposed of 
Jeffcoat after only eight outs, wading through four Texas relief pitchers en 
route to a 5-2 victory before 29,614 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Angel rookie Jim Abbott (7-5) got the victory, limiting the Rangers to one run 
through seven innings before balking home a second run in the top of the 
eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott struck out six, including second baseman Jeff Kunkel three times. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffcoat (4-2) extended his scoreless streak against the Angels to 11 innings 
before breaking down in a hurry in the third, turning a 1-0 Texas lead into a 
3-1 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Schofield opened the inning by drawing a walk and one out later, White did 
the same. Wally Joyner followed with an opposite-field double into the 
left-field corner, scoring both Schofield and White. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner then took third on a single by Brian Downing and scored on a passed ball 
by Ranger catcher Jim Sundberg. When Jeffcoat issued a two-out walk to Tony 
Armas, Texas Manager Bobby Valentine decided he'd seen enough. 
</P>
<P>
In came Cecilio Guante, beginning a parade of pitchers out of the Ranger 
bullpen. Before the evening was through, the Angels would also become 
acquainted with Drew Hall, Kenny Rogers and Gary Mielke, adding two 
ninth-inning runs against Rogers and Mielke. 
</P>
<P>
That broke the game open for Abbott, who limited Texas to five hits in his 
eight innings. Brian Harvey worked the ninth, allowing a hit and a walk before 
closing out his 11th save. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott fell behind in the top of the third when he gave up a two-out walk to 
Sundberg and successive singles to Sammy Sosa and Scott Fletcher. Fletcher's 
hit scored Sundberg and the Rangers led, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
But the Angels countered with their three-run outburst in bottom of the inning, 
giving Abbott an advantage he would protect until the eighth. Abbott yielded a 
fourth-inning double to Pete Incaviglia and a sixth-inning single to Ruben 
Sierra, but no Ranger reached third base thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott also had three consecutive strikeouts, fanning Steve Buechele to end the 
fourth inning before opening the fifth with strikeouts of Kunkel and Sundberg. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott completed a 1-2-3 seventh inning, striking out Kunkel and Sundberg 
again, before having a bit of trouble in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
With one out, Sosa doubled into the gap in right-center and took third on an 
infield out. From there, Sosa scored when Abbott unleashed a high fastball that 
nicked catcher Lance Parrish's glove and was ruled a passed ball. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Abbott ended the inning by retiring Rafael Palmeiro on a ground ball. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, held scoreless by Hall and Rogers through the eighth inning, 
finally got to Rogers in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Downing drew a leadoff walk and was singled to second by Chili Davis, prompting 
Valentine to change pitchers again and bring on Mielke. Mielke got Tony Armas 
to line into a double play -- catching Davis off first base -- but surrendered 
a double to deep center field by Parrish, the ball sailing well over the head 
of Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
Downing scored on the hit and Parrish soon followed suit, coming home on a 
single to left by Glenn Hoffman, who was starting in place of injured third 
baseman Jack Howell. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey replaced Abbott in the top of the ninth and, as is his custon of late, 
proceeded to make things more interesting than Angel Manager Doug Rader would 
have liked. With one out, Harvey gave up a single to Franco and a and a walk to 
Incaviglia to bring the tying run to home plate. 
</P>
<P>
Thad Bosley, the first of two pinch-hitters employed by Valentine, grounded to 
first to move the runners up 90 feet. Rick Leach, batting for Kunkel, then 
struck out, finally bringing an end to Harvey's 11th save of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tony Armas was back in right field Monday night because Claudell Washington 
remained in Inglewood's Centinela Hospital Medical Center for treatment of his 
inflamed left shin. Washington is receiving intravenous antibiotics for a 
condition that has been diagnosed as cellulitis and tendinitis. According to 
Angel trainer Rick Smith, the injury is similar to the shin infection that 
knocked Wally Joyner out of the final four games of the 1986 American League 
playoffs. One difference, though: Washington's condition was apparently brought 
on by a brush with poison oak. Said Smith: "His kids got into some poison oak 
and during the last home stand, Claudell was rolling around with them and 
playing with them. A couple of days later, his thighs started itching. He was 
scratching them so hard, there were almost claw marks. Then, there was swelling 
in the shin. That might have been how the cellulitis got started." Washington 
is expected to be released from the hospital today but Smith said the 
outfielder might not be ready to play again "until the weekend or the Thursday 
after the All-Star break."

WILSON, LIANO USE DIFFERENT METHODS TO WIN THEIR KICKBOXING MATCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don Wilson was very patient and Mariano Liano was not, but the results were the 
same Monday night as professional kickboxing came to Costa Mesa for the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, the World Kickboxing Assn. light-heavyweight champion, stopped Mike 
Winkeljohn with an overpowering left hook late in the 10th and final round of 
the non-title main event at the Red Lion Inn in front of about 800. 
</P>
<P>
In the semi-main event, Liano won the vacant WKA junior featherweight title 
with a fourth-round knockout of Sanea Koala. Liano had to act quickly because 
of a deep cut above his right eye that resulted from a head butt by Koala in 
the third round. 
</P>
<P>
Kickboxing combines the hand punching of boxing with leg kicks found in martial 
arts. Fighters wear boxing gloves as well as pads that cover the top and ankle 
area of their bare feet. 
</P>
<P>
Liano (14-1) charged out to start the fourth round and attacked Koala (8-1). 
Liano used two strong kicks to the body, and Koala crumbled. During a standing 
eight count, Koala regained his feet, but they were kicked out from under him 
and the fight was stopped 46 seconds into the round. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't like how deep or long the cut was," said Mel Chavez, Liano's trainer. 
"Our game plan was to start the fight in the sixth round after Liano got warmed 
up but after the head butt, we had to go right after him and get it over with." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson was much more content to just let the rounds roll by. He scored a 
knockdown with a left hook in the second, but Winkeljohn jumped right back to 
his feet. 
</P>
<P>
Winkeljohn came on in the middle rounds, although he was never close to a 
knockdown. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson rallied in the final three rounds, landing an impressive combination of 
feet and hands to slow Winkeljohn. 
</P>
<P>
In the eighth, Wilson came across the ring, landing a left kick, then a right 
foot to the face of Winkeljohn, driving him into a corner. Wilson, the better 
boxer of the two, then used a right-left hand combination to hurt Winkeljohn. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson dominated again in the ninth, but his true power showed in the 10th. 
</P>
<P>
With about a minute left, the fighters came to the center of the ring and 
Wilson flipped a left foot to the head, much like a left jab in conventional 
boxing. He followed with a right hand, then a long, thundering left that 
slammed Winkeljohn to the ground and ended the fight with 46 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Pierre Saint Tran, promoter of Monday's event, said he plans for a second show 
in August at the Red Lion.

ARONCHICK AND ELLER WEATHER RALLY, WIN LAGUNA OPEN TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pete Aronchick and Mark Eller beat the heat and played power volleyball to 
defeat Dane Selznick and Andy Fishburn, 15-9, to win the men's invitational 
division title in the 35th Laguna Open Monday at Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth professional beach volleyball victory for Eller, 30, and the 
first for Aronchick, who will share the $20,625 first-place prize. Selznick and 
Fishburn will share $8,625. 
</P>
<P>
The absence of top professionals such as Sinjin Smith and Randy Stoklos and 
defending champions Jon Stevenson and Pat Powers opened the door for Aronchick, 
a Culver City native who played professional basketball in Australia and the 
Continental Basketball Assn., and Eller of Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
The top 32 men's players were in an Assn. of Volleyball Professionals 
tournament at Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Fishburn and Selznick trailed, 6-0, but fought back with great defense and some 
well-placed shallow shots over the blocks of the 6-foot-7 Aronchick. 
</P>
<P>
Selznick, who has won 13 professional beach events, did not play like a man 
only recently recovered from hepatitis. The son of Laguna Open's first 
champion, Gene Selznick, Selznick brought his team to within 9-8 with a spike 
to the corner. 
</P>
<P>
But Aronchick and Eller took command by scoring the next five points. 
</P>
<P>
The fierce heat and fatigue took their toll on the losers, who had to play six 
games -- including two Monday morning -- to win the losers' bracket in the 
double-elimination tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Aronchick and Eller were undefeated in the winners' bracket and had Monday 
morning off. 
</P>
<P>
"Fatigue was definitely a factor for me," Selznick said. "I haven't played in a 
year and I got every serve in this tournament, every serve." 
</P>
<P>
Eller, 30, said the plan was to serve to Selznick. "Andy (Fishburn) is a 
stronger offensive player and we just felt with a strong block on Dane, because 
Pete is 6-7, I could run down some of Dane's shots. (Our) feeling was he 
wouldn't be able to hit against such a big block, and it worked out." 
</P>
<P>
The women's team of defending champion Janice Opalinski (Dana Hills and UC 
Irvine), who this year teamed with Linda Chisholm-Carrillo, defeated an erratic 
Judy Bellomo and Lisa Strand, 15-6, in the women's final to earn $8,250. 
Bellomo and Strand came up through the losers' bracket after losing to 
Opalinski and Chisholm-Carrillo, 15-7, Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the second this season for Opalinski and Chisholm-Carrillo. "We 
have worked long and hard to be here. It's a nice payoff," Opalinski said. 
</P>
<P>
"We came out ready to play. It was kind of anti-climactic because Judy and Lisa 
were not really on their game because they were so nervous because it was their 
first time in the finals (of any professional volleyball tournament)." 
</P>
<P>
The nervousness translated into numerous unforced errors by Bellomo, 23, of 
Glendale, the tour's rookie of the year in 1988, and Strand, 30, who helped 
lead the University of Hawaii to national championships in 1982 and '83. 
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday and today, it was the same thing," Bellomo said. "They served us and 
we hit out. They didn't hit us. They didn't dig us. Pathetic is a good word for 
(our performance)." 
</P>
<P>
Said Chisholm-Carrillo, who was an Olympic silver medalist in 1984: "We were 
just concentrating on serving tough so they couldn't pass or spike as well."

ICN Pharmaceuticals reported that its net income fell 46% to $3 million in the 
second quarter ended May 31, compared to $5.6 million in the same period a year 
earlier. Revenue was up 9% to $44.5 million from $40.7 million. The Costa 
Mesa-based pharmaceutical company blamed the reduced earnings partly on higher 
research costs associated with the development of ribavirin, a compound used to 
treat infants and young children with lower respiratory tract infections.

PAIR OF LAGUNA ART FESTIVALS OFFER DOUBLE THE DIVERSION; 
</P>
<P>
SAWDUST AND ART-A-FAIR EXHIBITS, BOTH IN 23RD YEAR, FEATURE VARIETY OF ITEMS IN 
PRACTICALLY ALL MEDIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Well, it's that time of year again for people who love to wander the booths of 
arts and crafts festivals, hands clutching fattening goodies, eyes peeled for 
handcrafted objects that simply can't be passed up. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Beach perennials, Art-a-Fair and the Sawdust Festival -- each in its 
23rd year -- are neighbors once again at 777 and 935 Laguna Canyon Road, 
respectively. Both fairs feature items in virtually all media from quilts and 
toys to paintings and sculpture, and will remain open through Aug. 27. 
</P>
<P>
Art-a-Fair offers work for sale by a jury-selected group of 160 artists and 
craftsmen, and by "celebrity artist" Red Skelton. Demonstration booths offer 
tastes of diverse media and techniques, including stone sculpture, paper 
collage, etching, watercolor, ceramics, oil painting and Chinese brush 
painting. 
</P>
<P>
A major attraction is a motor-driven, 30-foot-long kaleidoscope with 9-foot 
stained-glass wheels; it's billed as the world's largest. Entertainment 
includes bluegrass, oldies pop, folk, reggae, Celtic and dulcimer music ("all 
upbeat," according to a festival spokeswoman) as well as children's activities. 
Refreshments are available. 
</P>
<P>
Art-a-Fair hours are 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sundays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 
11 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays. Admission is $3.50 general, $2.50 for senior

Group rates are available. For information, call (714) 494-4514. 
</P>
<P>
The Sawdust Festival, Art-a-Fair's wealthier cousin, offers work for sale by 
220 artists and craftsmen on its landscaped grounds, which now contain several 
permanent California bungalow-style buildings. Sawdust is a non-juried show; 
artists are admitted on a lottery basis. More than 20 demonstration booths 
feature such activities as glass blowing, glass sculpture, leather working, 
jewelry making, portrait drawing and face painting. 
</P>
<P>
Daily entertainment includes mimes, jugglers, magicians and numerous musical 
groups. The Young Artists Booth offers free arts and crafts lessons to children 
ages 6 to 12. Refreshments are available. 
</P>
<P>
Sawdust Festival hours are 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sundays through Thursdays, 10 
a.m. to 11 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays. Today only, the hours will be 10 a.m. to
