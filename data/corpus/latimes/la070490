You may have heard that Irwindale, the once-and-never home of the Raiders, 
wants to fill in its famous gravel pits to rid itself of its moonscape image 
and attract commercial developers. 
</P>
<P>
But as one consultant said: "It took 80 years to make all those holes. It's 
going to take a while to fill them up." 
</P>
<P>
Readers, this is an emergency. Please send Only in L.A. your suggestions on how 
Irwindale can stuff those pits. 
</P>
<P>
Here's some filler that we would include: 
</P>
<P>
Raider press releases, blueprints for the Hubble telescope, blueprints for the 
Cal State Long Beach recital hall, plans for the "Steel Cloud" gateway over the 
Hollywood Freeway, the defunct Venice Pier, the secret redistricting plans of 
the county supervisors, all the screenwriters' drafts for the movie, "Coming to 
America," and, of course, Zsa Zsa's Rolls-Royce. 
</P>
<P>

A group of high school cheerleaders found themselves on the defensive the other 
day when a city inspector told them they were breaking the law by standing on a 
sidewalk and brandishing signs for a Granada Hills subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
The girls, hired by the developer, took the job to raise money to buy new 
cheerleading equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Street Maintenance inspector confiscated the signs because the 
cheerleaders were on public property. The girls said they were then told they'd 
be arrested if they didn't get off the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Street Maintenance said there was no mention of the arrest 
threat in the report of the inspector, who was on vacation and could not be 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
But Street Maintenance said that the developer had been warned in the past 
about "using the public right-of-way for his commercial ventures." 
</P>
<P>
"Come see our beautiful new water fountain in the patio," read the sign outside 
one trendy Main Street eatery in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, a different kind of fountain was visible the other night -- sewage 
escaping from a valve in the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
M edia types were invited to a rehearsal of the Rose Bowl's 4th of July 
celebration to watch stunt driver Karl Winn jump over "a mock Berlin Wall" on a

<P>
The Lost City of the Lizard People hasn't been forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
Several weeks ago, we discussed the legendary ancient civilization, which lies 
beneath the Civic Center, according to Hopi legend. The Lizardites were said to 
have built the underground metropolis in order to protect themselves and their 
vast gold holdings from floods. 
</P>
<P>
Since our mention, Larry Tomoyasu has published a poem, "History for L.A.," in 
the Downtown News, in which he muses whether the Lizard City has been "cracked 
into" during Metro Rail construction . . . 
</P>
<P>
 like thousand year old 
</P>
<P>
 eggshells. dusty and hollow. 
</P>
<P>
And Samuel Freeman of Santa Monica was so inspired that he wrote us to say that 
he'd founded the Lizard People Church, pointing out that it's in the tradition 
of California's "unusual sects, cults, religious movements, etc." Freeman says 
his slogan is: "Blessed Be the LPC!"

GIANTURCO ON PROPS. 111, 108 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "On the Road Again With Props. 111, 108," by Adriana Gianturco, 
Commentary, June 25: 
</P>
<P>
Gianturco's comments were interesting in that she and Gov. Jerry Brown combined 
to "strangle" our state transportation system with their moratorium on new 
highway construction during their years in office. 
</P>
<P>
The freeway ramps in progress you pictured are probably the ones being 
completed that Brown and Gianturco left hanging eight years ago. Gianturco was 
referred to as "Giant Turkey" during her tenure as director of Caltrans. The 
name still fits. Props. 111 and 108 will be good for all Californians.

L.A. COUNTY'S REDISTRICTING PLAN PUTS EDELMAN IN LATINO DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County supervisors' map, redistricting the county's five 
supervisorial districts, is an undisguised disgrace ("Edelman Put in Latino 
District by Board Plan," Part A, June 28). If the previous map constituted a 
devious and contrived violation of the federal Voting Rights Act, this one has 
to be worse! 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors seem to be under the impression that all they have to do is 
shuffle things around in such a way as to create a new, heavily Latino district 
without rocking anybody's boat. Other aspects of fair representation or 
geographical integrity can be disregarded. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Deane Dana unabashedly admits that his goal was to maintain 
conservative control of the board. So his district, the biggest gerrymander on 
the map, is unfazed. 
</P>
<P>
The long doglegs which would include Supervisor Ed Edelman's Westside home and 
the city of San Fernando in the new Latino district are outrageous on their 
face. 
</P>
<P>
Proposals intended to "guarantee" the outcome of future elections should not 
even be considered. 
</P>
<P>
It appears that our selfish incumbent supervisors have dumped on Judge David 
Kenyon the task of giving us an honest realignment of our country's district 
boundaries.

CAN'T ANYTHING BE DONE ABOUT THE GRAFFITI GRIME WAVE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few people claim graffiti is art. It's not. Da Vinci is art. Graffiti is 
garbage. 
</P>
<P>
But graffiti gangsters have been spraying public surfaces with such 
kaleidoscopic garbage since the days of the Pharaohs. Even the pyramids did not 
escape this aesthetic plague. 
</P>
<P>
Today there's hardly a blank wall in central Los Angeles that doesn't bear 
stylized lettering left there by some distinctly unfunny non-artist (often, but 
not always, a member of a gang) who had nothing better to do with his time than 
deface someone else's property. 
</P>
<P>
Last year county government spent $9 million trying to clean it up, the city of 
Los Angeles another $3.7 million, and the Southern California Rapid Transit 
District $4.3 million. Not to mention the tidy fortune various police agencies 
have spent chasing graffiti artists. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) thinks the police have more pressing 
things to do than round up graffiti gangsters. And he's right. He thus proposes 
to deprive the perpetrators of the chief tool of their trade by making it a lot 
harder to buy spray paint. And that's right, too. 
</P>
<P>
He'd ban the sale of spray paint cans statewide, except those used by 
commercial firms, starting in 1992. It's a tempting idea, but would the bill be 
effective? (Already one begins to hear counter-arguments from the spray-can and 
paint industries: "Spray cans don't deface walls; people deface walls!") 
</P>
<P>
Probably an outright ban is unfair to the manufacturers -- and most likely 
ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
But there's something else in the Torres bill we like: He'd require paint 
retailers to store spray-paint cans in locked display cabinets, starting next 
year. Many don't do that now, as they should. 
</P>
<P>
That makes sense. There's already a state law against selling spray-paint cans 
to minors, and Torres figures locked cabinets would keep those cans from being 
shoplifted. 
</P>
<P>
It's worth a shot.

DICK TRACY DOCTRINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Midway through the trial of Imelda Marcos and Adnan M. Khashoggi, U.S. District 
Judge John F. Keenan asked what turned out to be the decisive question: "What 
am I doing here (in a New York City courtroom) trying a case involving the 
theft of money from Philippine banks?" 
</P>
<P>
In the minds of the jurors who acquitted both defendants on all charges, the 
answer was clear. 
</P>
<P>
"It was on the wrong side of the ocean," juror Thomas O'Rourke said. "It was a 
totally silly case. We are not big brothers to the people overseas." 
</P>
<P>
There is no better common-sense rebuttal to the Bush Administration's claims 
for the new reach of American law, an act of self-assertion that the Justice 
Department calls "extra-territorial jurisdiction." This novel theory holds that 
U.S. authorities may seize and try citizens of other nations for acts committed 
outside the United States. This also is the presumption under which the 
government seized former Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega. Whatever the 
wisdom of the U.S. military operation, the application of the extra-territorial 
doctrine to his case is as legally dubious -- and, as it now appears, as risky 
for prosecutors -- as it was in the Marcos debacle. 
</P>
<P>
In both cases, our government is suggesting that it has a sort of custodial, 
almost parental right to punish the leaders of other countries for their 
corrupt misrule. 
</P>
<P>
At the very least, it's a notion that, if pressed, could well exacerbate our 
court congestion problem.

LAWYERS AND THIEVES, BY ROY GRUTMAN AND BOB THOMAS. SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER.

<P>
A BOAST OF BEATING THE LEGAL SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN KIRSCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lawyer-bashing is one of America's favorite sports. 
</P>
<P>
Only last week, in these pages, Times columnist Jack Smith passed along one 
reader's opinion that even those pesky kernels of plastic foam now used as 
packing material are somehow the result of the machinations of some evil 
attorney. So there is absolutely nothing surprising about the vilification of 
lawyers and the legal profession in "Lawyers and Thieves" -- except, perhaps, 
the fact that the book is written by an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"For lawyers, the law is not a search for truth, it's a search for clients," 
write Roy Grutman and his co-author, Bob Thomas, at the very outset of "Lawyers 
and Thieves." "(L)awyers have become cutthroat salesman and law firms have 
turned into high-volume retail outlets. . . . These days, lawyers are more like 
magicians who see law as a sleight-of-hand game for rearranging wealth." 
</P>
<P>
Grutman is an accomplished trial lawyer with a big reputation and a lot of 
famous clients: Bob Guccione, Jerry Falwell, Jackie Collins, etc. (He figures 
prominently, for instance, in "Shark Tank," the story of the rise and fall of a 
mega-firm that cherished its reputation for ruthlessness in the practice of 
law.) Bob Thomas, although credited as co-author, is apparently only Grutman's 
"ghost" -- the first-person war stories in "Lawyers and Thieves" belong 
exclusively to Grutman. 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, Grutman has some pretty good war stories, the kind that 
lawyers love to tell each other (and anyone else who will listen). Most of 
Grutman's yarns make for a fast, easy read, and even if "Lawyers and Thieves" 
is really not much more than a trial lawyer's memoirs, it is a superior example 
of the genre. At its best, "Lawyers and Thieves" has the quality of hard-boiled 
mystery fiction -- tough, knowing, street-wise, and full of dirty little 
secrets. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Grutman appears to remind himself from time to time that he is offering 
something loftier and more substantial than a collection of war stories. He 
dispenses little nibbles of advice: "Answer defensively," he suggests to 
witnesses. "Trust your instinct," he tells clients in search of lawyers. And 
Grutman insists that his parade of horribles amounts to an expose of the 
American system of jurisprudence -- he indicts all lawyers (and, in a real 
sense, the legal system itself) on the strength of evidence against the worst 
among them. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, after telling a particularly grisly and shocking tale about "the most 
complete hustler who ever passed the bar" -- a colorful Brooklyn 
personal-injury lawyer with a dangerous obsession for beautiful young women -- 
Grutman feels compelled to hold up the miscreant as somehow typical of the 
legal profession in general. "Like all lawyers who prey on clients," he 
observes, "(he) saw other people as victims, the value-added by-products of 
crimes and accidents." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Grutman takes every opportunity to engage in gratuitous rhetorical 
overkill, thereby hyping the flawed premise of his book. "All lawyers," he 
declares, "are essentially confidence men, some in the best sense, many in the 
worst" -- whatever that is supposed to mean. And he accuses the founder of 
Finley, Kumble, the law firm where Grutman worked as a senior partner for six 
years, of "turn(ing) the practice of law from a profession into a bicoastal 
bait-and-switch operation." 
</P>
<P>
Roy Grutman's favorite lawyer is, not surprisingly, Roy Grutman. For example, 
he reproduces a portion of the deposition testimony that he elicited from Henry 
Kissinger in a libel action against "Penthouse," and then reports that 
Kissinger decided to drop the case. "The deposition," he concludes, "served its 
purpose." 
</P>
<P>
After quoting another celebrated lawyer, Gerry Spence, who once described 
Grutman as "cunning, crafty and tough," the author fairly glows with pride: "In 
a line of work where threatening behavior is a virtue," Grutman writes, "I 
could not have asked for a better endorsement." 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, I reviewed a book by Gerry Spence in these pages -- Spence's book 
was a high-minded form of lawyer-bashing that called for urgent and fundamental 
reform of the American legal system in the interests of justice. Significantly, 
Grutman is not much interested in justice, and he makes no demands for reform 
in "Lawyers and Thieves." Rather, Roy Grutman seems to revel in his expertise 
and accomplishment as a practitioner in what he sees as a corrupt and debased 
profession. "Lawyers and Thieves" is not a lament -- it is a boast.

MORNING REPORT: 'QUANTUM LEAP' RERUNS LAND IN THE TOP 20

"Quantum Leap's" Scott Bakula time leaped across the past three decades five 
times last week, landing twice in the A.C. Nielsen Top 20 and scoring its three 
highest rankings ever on NBC, according to ratings released Tuesday. In an 
effort to gain greater exposure for this critically praised series, the network 
aired reruns of the show at 10 p.m. for five successive nights. 
</P>
<P>
The move paid off as the program was seen in a cumulative 50 million households 
over the course of the week, finishing 12th, 19th, 32nd, 38th and 44th. The bad 
news is that the show fared poorest on Friday, the night NBC has reserved for 
it this fall. 
</P>
<P>
* "Mr. Belvedere," the lowbrow family sitcom that seemingly has had more lives 
than Shirley MacLaine, was resurrected again last Sunday on ABC, but in its 
latest incarnation, "Belvedere" found "The Simpsons," TV's favorite 
ill-mannered family, to be an irrepressible foe. Following "America's Funniest 
Home Videos" at 8:30 p.m., "Mr. Belvedere" slipped all the way to 59th place 
while the acerbic "Simpsons" bickered their way to No. 11.

Luther Campbell's Greatest Hit: "Banned in the U.S.A.," the new Luther Campbell 
single with 2 Live Crew being released today by Luke Records, has garnered the 
largest advance orders for a single in the history of Atlantic Records. Mark 
Schulman, Atlantic senior vice president and general manager, said he expects 
the single, which contains a melody of Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the 
U.S.A.," to rapidly reach platinum record status. 2 Live Crew, whose last album 
has been banned by federal court order in several Florida counties, went back 
to court Monday to film parts of a video for the upcoming album, "Banned in the 
U.S.A," which is due for release later this month. Also, formal charges were 
filed Tuesday against three members of the Miami rap group who were arrested 
after their adults-only performance on June 9 in Hollywood, Fla., and also 
against a store owner who sold their "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" album to an 
undercover detective on June 8. GREG BRAXTON

OLIVER JONES A STANDOUT AT CANADIAN FEST

Jazz, it would seem, is more popular than nationalism in the province of 
Quebec. Whereas a dismal 2,500 showed up Sunday to watch the Canada Day Parade 
(compared to 35,000 last year), an estimated 5,000 formed a human bottleneck at 
a corner of the Rue Ste. Catherine, where a free concert was under way as part 
of the 11th annual Festival International de Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
This 10-day wonder has grown continuously, now involving 1,000 musicians, 250 
free outdoor events, scores of live indoor shows and 16 presentations of jazz 
films. To ensure a totally festive ambiance, everything is contained in an area 
of three blocks where vehicular traffic is barred; the streets are jammed with 
revelers, musicians, jugglers and countless tables for food, drink and 
people-watching. 
</P>
<P>
Visiting from Brazil, Peru, Iceland, Australia and a dozen other countries, the 
jazzmen can be heard from noon to midnight. The aluminum company Alcan, a major 
sponsor, offers a daily diet of competing bands from various regions of Canada; 
the winning group will land a record deal. 
</P>
<P>
Among the international units assembled this week, Monday's concert by Canadian 
pianist Oliver Jones stood out. Now a world figure but still Montreal-based and 
seldom heard in the United States, Jones had a rare chance to be flanked by a 
group of his American peers: Clark Terry on trumpet, Herb Ellis on guitar, Ed 
Thigpen on drums and Red Mitchell on bass. 
</P>
<P>
The 3,000-seat hall in the Place des Arts was packed as the evening began with 
the presentation to Jones of the prestigious Oscar Peterson Award, named for 
Canada's most distinguished jazz export. The pianist started his set with a 
steamroller version of "Just Friends." Though a relentless rhythmic sense is 
his guiding force, Jones can generate subtler emotions; his original work "A 
Beautiful Sight" achieved a music-box delicacy. 
</P>
<P>
Jones deferred too often to his sidemen; while he was offstage they seemed to 
be treading water. On his return, he was joined by Ranee Lee, a singer from 
Brooklyn who has lived here for 20 years. Lee's attractive timbral resemblance 
to Billie Holiday was accentuated by her use of songs from Lady Day's 
repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
Later Monday evening, at a smaller hall in the Place des Arts, pianist Randy 
Weston teamed up with Texas tenor saxophonist Billy Harper for a duo recital. 
Weston's mastery of dynamics and sonorous left-hand depth charges worked well 
against the fits-and-starts variations by Harper on "Caravan" and "Hi Fly," the 
latter Weston's best-known composition. Themes inspired by visits to Africa 
rounded out this exhilarating battle of conceptual wits.

SPECIALS: KRTH-FM (101.1) for the 13th year airs its "Firecracker 300," which 
counts down the top 300 pop hits ever, according to an audience survey. . . . 
Shadow Steele of Pirate Radio (100.3 FM) will celebrate the holiday by 
broadcasting from Gladstone's 4-Fish in Malibu, noon until 4 p.m. The coverage

addition to what is touted as the largest pyromusical event on the West Coast, 
the Rose Bowl celebration features performances by Wilson Phillips, Michael 
Bolton, Glenn Medeiros, The Cover Girls, Alisha and A'me Lorain. Rick Dees will

Moon" which was deleted from the 1929 movie of the same title. Berlin is heard 
singing "This Is the Army Mr. Jones" from his 1942 Broadway Review "This Is the 
Army." A patriotic Berlin wrote the review to help the war cause, according to 
program host Whitcomb, who said of the composer's rare recordings, "People 
forget that he was a performer before he became a song writer. He was probably 
very critical of himself." 
</P>
<P>
Also on KCRW, from 3 to 5 p.m. Louis Armstrong, who would have been 90 years 
old today, is revealed via recorded interviews with Armstrong himself as well 
as other musicians and music critics. Host Billy Taylor explores Armstrong's 
influence on the Swing Era and modern pop music.

THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY: CHRONICLES OF AN ABUNDANT LAND, BY WILLIAM F. KING.

<P>
When the Roman Catholic Church and the Spanish government established La Mision 
del Santo Arcangel San Gabriel de Los Temblores in 1769, the surrounding land 
was marked chiefly by broad grass plains and clusters of oak and alder trees. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the area known as the San Gabriel Valley is better identified as home to 
nine freeways, more than two dozen cities and communities and close to 2 
million residents. 
</P>
<P>
That transition from virgin land to major metropolis is the subject of 
historian William F. King's "The San Gabriel Valley: Chronicles of an Abundant 
Land." 
</P>
<P>
Commissioned by the Alhambra Chamber of Commerce, the book looks at the area's 
history and its impact on the rest of California. 
</P>
<P>
For example, as one of the state's most fertile regions, the valley was an 
original site of what was to become California's booming citrus industry, King 
writes. 
</P>
<P>
In 1940, the state's first freeway was built in the San Gabriel Valley. The 
opening of the Arroyo Seco Parkway, later called the Pasadena Freeway, ushered 
in an era of great highway construction for the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Today, King said, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena and the region's 
aerospace industry continue to affect the rest of the state, country and world. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Glendora and history professor at Mt. San Antonio College, King 
said much of the material for the book came from the college courses he 
teaches. 
</P>
<P>
"Chronicles of an Abundant Land" is one of a series of community and regional 
histories produced by Windsor Publications. Others in the series include the 
San Fernando Valley and St. Paul, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
According to Windsor editor Jeffrey Reeves, the books chronicle histories of 
areas that might otherwise go unrecorded. "They tell a story that doesn't 
normally get told."

THE SECRET OF THE AMERICAN IDEA; 
</P>
<P>
THE UNITED STATES: THE WORLD IS MOVING TOWARD OUR FORM OF DEMOCRACY. BUT THE 
LESSONS WON'T BE EASY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan praised Michael Barone's new book, "Our 
Country: The Shaping of America From Roosevelt to Reagan," he did so by 
referring to James Bryce, an Englishman who came to have a look at America in 
the 19th Century. "Bryce had asked why peoples the world over were so intrigued 
by American arrangements; he answered that soon or late they expected ours to 
be theirs." 
</P>
<P>
Well, "soon or late" arrived in the world in 1989, as democracy busted out all 
over and with it a renewed appreciation for America the country coupled with an 
even bigger appreciation for America the idea. Nowhere is this more evident 
than in a conference being hosted by the Czechoslovakian President Vaclav Havel 
in Prague. 
</P>
<P>
The conference is titled "The Peaceful Road to Democracy." Invitations were 
issued to the leaders of independent democracy movements inside the Soviet 
Union and Eastern Europe, and panels consist of Eastern and Western experts. 
</P>
<P>
The date the conference begins is no coincidence, today, July 4. 
</P>
<P>
How prophetic Bryce was! A century after his look at America, the rest of the 
world is moving toward making our arrangements theirs. But what are our 
arrangements? What is it that makes the idea of America the cause for 
international celebration? It is clearly nothing so simple as the 
constitutional framework that our Founding Fathers developed. In the 200 years 
since our Constitution was written, it has been copied, many times, without 
producing anything near the idea of America that will be cause for celebration 
in Prague. 
</P>
<P>
To go looking for the idea of America is no simple task, but Barone's book is 
not a bad place to start. And in the telling of the story we find the first 
secret of the American idea: It is constantly changing and constantly being 
remade. It encompasses conformity when conformity and institutional bigness are 
necessary to cope with the Great Depression and to win World War II. It 
encompasses radical diversity and challenge to the establishment when the 
civil-rights movement begins. And it encompasses the shift to a small-unit 
economy when the technology and the mentality of the post-industrial economy 
demand flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
It is this very dynamism, reminiscent of Thomas Jefferson's recommendation that 
we have a revolution every 20 years or so, that makes lessons difficult -- but 
they're there. 
</P>
<P>
The first is a lesson that seems to have been learned well by the fledgling 
democracies of Eastern Europe and even by the less radical movements inside the 
Soviet Union: criticize. The civil-rights movement began, in Barone's words, a 
period of "national self-criticism" and "belligerent skepticism" that was "a 
necessary part in the improvement of the system. Progress in desegregation and 
integration could not be secured until white Americans were convinced that one 
important underpinning of their system was rotten." The national critique that 
began in the '60s was, Barone says, a critique that could only come from a 
nation "successful enough to be concerned about means as well as ends." 
</P>
<P>
Thus the second lesson about the American idea is that it is not relative -- it 
is absolute. In other words, the context of success in which the torrents of 
criticism occurred -- the fact that we managed to make a nation that was 
wealthier, more egalitarian and more tolerant than probably any other nation in 
the world -- was no excuse for not living up to the ideal in race or in any 
other matter. 
</P>
<P>
The third lesson, a lesson that the emerging democracies of the world may fail 
to heed if their countries degenerate into regional and ethnic conflict, is 
about diversity. Immigration figures prominently in the story and the idea of 
America. The immigrants of the '70s, like the immigrants of the '20s, settled 
in those areas of the country with the highest economic growth. They did not, 
however, sap and strain those economies; they contributed to them, and to the 
ever-changing nature of the American idea. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth lesson is about accepting the will, if not the wisdom, of the 
people, a lesson that some of Barone's critics cannot accept -- especially when 
he gets to the Reagan years. "The 1980 result," says Barone, "was not an 
accident. It showed that most American voters wanted limits on the growth of 
government at home, a more assertive foreign policy abroad and some greater 
honoring of traditional moral values in their basic institutions." 
</P>
<P>
In the story of America, the will of the people swings in wide and often 
surprising ways; in the idea of America it is the final word. Who knows what 
form the idea of America will take at the Prague conference? But one thing is 
certain: The goal of mobilizing for democracy is the creation of a society that 
works without constant mobilization. A century ago Bryce marvelled at this 
phenomenon. "A citizen has little time to think about political problems. 
Engrossing all the working hours, his avocation leaves him only stray moments 
for this fundamental duty." 
</P>
<P>
This Fourth of July we should devote a stray moment to the idea that much of 
the world is trying to figure out.

The Kremlin is resisting a proposal by the three Baltic republics for joint 
negotiations on their independence demands, according to Vita Barshis, a 
spokesman for Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene. But Barshis said 
Lithuania is pushing ahead with the idea and has invited the Estonian and 
Latvian prime ministers to Vilnius this weekend for a strategy session. The 
presidents of the Baltic republics proposed "three-plus-one" talks with Moscow 
last weekend, but the Kremlin is insisting on one-to-one talks with Lithuania, 
he said.

Romania said that at least 83 people will stand trial for involvement in 
political violence in Bucharest. 
</P>
<P>
Officials asserted that the six people killed in the June 13-15 riots died 
before pro-government miners arrived on the scene. A Foreign Ministry statement 
also absolved security forces of responsibility for three people who died of 
gunshot wounds, saying the troops used only blanks. The statements appeared to 
be part of a campaign by Prime Minister Petre Roman's government, sworn in 
Tuesday by President Ion Iliescu, to repair the damage caused to Romania's 
international reputation by the riots.

The state Senate's Judiciary Committee approved a bill that would strip the 
confidentiality from California adoption records, revealing the identity of 
thousands of parents who relinquished their children before 1984. The bill, 
passed on a bipartisan 6-0 vote, would make original birth certificates and 
court records open to the inspection of adoptees and their adoptive parents and 
require the state Department of Social Services to release information on the 
marriages and married names of the birth parents. 
</P>
<P>
Birth parents would gain access to the amended birth certificate and other 
records showing the names and addresses of the adoptive parents. The records 
would only be available after the adoptees reached age 18. The bill includes a 
provision requiring the state to conduct a yearlong advertising campaign 
warning birth parents and adoptees to contact the state if they want to shield 
their identity.

More than 30 people were arrested for investigation of car theft in 
simultaneous raids in three Southern California counties, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The raids culminated a sting operation that began late last year and resulted 
in the recovery of 90 automobiles valued at more than $1.3 million, said 
Ontario Police Detective Jim Vandever. Authorities opened a shop called Classic 
Detailers in Ontario in September. Although the business performed some 
legitimate work, "they leaked the word out to the street that the real business 
was buying stolen cars," Vandever said.

A controversial measure to overturn a court decision that allowed mentally ill 
patients to refuse anti-psychotic drugs was stalled in the Assembly Health 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Lacking the votes to move his bill through committee, Sen. Robert Presley 
(D-Riverside) asked that action be delayed while he negotiates with the 
opposition. Last year's court decision requires psychiatrists to obtain the 
informed consent of even those patients hospitalized against their will before 
administering medication. Presley's bill would require that psychiatrists get a 
second opinion from a fellow doctor before forcing the drugs on their patients 
but would allow them to administer the drugs before any outside review.

PERCEPTIONS OF BARRY TRIAL STIR ANGER IN D.C. BLACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS JEHL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's capital sits transfixed as its embattled mayor listens to 
courtroom accusations that he tied contracts to sexual favors and as he watches 
a videotape showing him smoking crack cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
In a parallel drama taking shape on street corners and talk shows and in public 
rallies, discussion has assumed a new and angry dimension. As the charges have 
piled up in court against Mayor Marion Barry, his supporters have grown 
proportionately restless. 
</P>
<P>
Stirred by accusations that the drug and perjury charges against Barry were 
racially motivated and that the prosecution is overly zealous, a chorus of 
protest has inflamed local tensions and has provoked new fears of a summertime 
flash point. 
</P>
<P>
"This trial is causing problems for which there is no judicial relief," 
declared Sam Smith, publisher of the Progressive Review and longtime observer 
of District of Columbia politics. 
</P>
<P>
Added Ronald Walters, a professor of political science at Howard University: 
"You've got the conditions for the kind of thing that turns public anger into 
violence." Already, he warned, "the chasm between the races has been widened." 
</P>
<P>
Examples of the intensity of the anger can be heard on the streets and on radio 
talk shows, particularly on black-owned stations that hold their fingers to the 
pulse of the community. 
</P>
<P>
"If something happens to the mayor," an anonymous caller recently told WOL host 
Cathy Hughes, "this city's going to be burning!" 
</P>
<P>
Analysts stressed that it would be premature to predict that new tensions could 
lead to riots. Some noted that activists have sought to direct energies toward 
an alternative work boycott, or "sick-out," to be staged in the event of an 
adverse decision against Barry. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, many blacks stop far short of supporting the embattled mayor and 
express sadness, embarrassment and even bitterness about his apparent failings. 
Many in the city's large middle-class black community often seem to wish that 
the problem would go away and cringe at mayoral conduct that they fear will 
reflect on them. 
</P>
<P>
But the mayor has gone to great lengths to reach out to his core constituency 
-- the poorest and most disenfranchised blacks. And here he has found a 
particularly receptive audience for his complaint that he is facing a 
"lynching." 
</P>
<P>
And most analysts said that they believe there has been a fundamental change 
within much of Washington's black community since the trial began, with 
ambivalence about the mayor's plight replaced by the perception that he has 
been unfairly singled out. 
</P>
<P>
"It's reached a very, very explosive point," said H. R. Crawford, a black 
member of the District of Columbia City Council. "It's almost back to the way 
it was in 1968. All we need is just one tiny incident to ignite this -- and my 
heavens!" 
</P>
<P>
Observers said that the single most important event in laying bare the 
frictions that surround the Barry case occurred late last week when Judge 
Thomas Penfield Jackson abruptly refused permission for controversial black 
religious leaders Louis Farrakhan and George A. Stallings Jr. to enter the 
courtroom as the mayor's guests. 
</P>
<P>
Barry and other black leaders rejected the contention that the visitors' 
presence would be disruptive and have used the event to dramatize the racial 
aspects of what the mayor once termed his "political lynching" by 
white-dominated judicial systems. 
</P>
<P>
At a Sunday morning service, Barry stood by approvingly as Stallings warned of 
"hell on Earth" if he and Farrakhan continued to be barred from the trial. "The 
judge must know that he will only increase the racial tension," Stallings 
declared. 
</P>
<P>
Barry appeared with Farrakhan also at two weekend rallies in which the Nation 
of Islam leader warned that the mayor was "under attack" by the white 
Establishment. And Barry himself left the federal courthouse during a recess 
Monday to make that case before 300 supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"Let the people speak about what is happening in Washington, D.C.," Barry said. 
"Not just here but for the other black elected officials all over the land who 
have misfortunately been harassed and arraigned by U.S. prosecutors." 
</P>
<P>
Lurma Rackley, a spokesman for Barry, denied that the mayor was "doing anything 
to exacerbate tensions." But analysts, including Walters, the Howard University 
professor, said that the tactic appeared deliberate. 
</P>
<P>
"He is exploiting a vein in the black community which is very deep, and that is 
the sense of victimization," Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
The observers said that the charges of racial persecution have struck a potent 
chord because they came on the heels of testimony that dramatized the lengths 
to which the government had gone to build its case against the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney R. Kenneth Mundy declared in opening arguments that the 
seven-year investigation into the mayor's affairs demonstrated that the federal 
government "was going to any length and any expense . . . exorbitant expense, 
to make a case against Mr. Barry." 
</P>
<P>
And an FBI videotape that incontrovertibly showed Barry smoking crack cocaine 
in a Washington hotel room may have left as its most lasting impression the 
determination behind the sophisticated sting operation that finally caught him, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the videotape suggested that Barry had been reluctant to 
visit the Vista hotel room where FBI informant Rasheeda Moore was waiting, that 
he had been more interested in sex than drugs and that he had rejected her 
offer of cocaine seven times before finally accepting it. 
</P>
<P>
"All it did was infuriate the black community to the point where it's ready to 
lash out," said Crawford, the D.C. council member, who represents heavily black 
Southeast Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The jury hearing the case is composed of 13 blacks and five whites. The judge 
will designate six as alternates when the case is given to them. 
</P>
<P>
Most analysts warned that the danger of violence would be greatest if Barry 
were convicted of the charges against him, but some said that tensions had 
reached the point that even mass celebrations of a Barry acquittal could turn 
riotous. 
</P>
<P>
Any prospect of public disorder in the nation's capital evokes in many minds 
memories of 1968, when block after block in residential areas was left in 
flames and the National Guard was deployed throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Calvin G. Franklin, the local National Guard commander, said that the 
force had taken no new steps as a result of the Barry trial. "All of our 
contingency plans are in excellent shape and are evaluated continually," 
Franklin said through a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Although some observers said that they believe the new sympathy for Barry 
extends to sectors of the white community, a recent Washington Post story 
suggested that perceptions of the case remain starkly divided along racial 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, which was taken before the trial began, two-thirds of 
whites in the District believe that Barry had "only himself to blame" for his 
legal troubles, but only 1 in 4 blacks felt that way. One in three blacks 
surveyed by the Post agreed with the statement that prosecutors were "out to 
get Marion Barry any way they can." 
</P>
<P>
The city's black community, which ranges widely in income and political 
orientation, is by no means unanimous in its sympathy toward Barry. But experts 
and residents said that they believe the mood of even Barry's most fervent 
critics had softened since he abandoned his bid to seek reelection to a record 
fourth term as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
"Even those people who had withdrawn their political support from Barry now 
don't want to see him crucified," said Walters, the Howard University 
professor.

'ABORTION HYPE' PERVADED MEDIA AFTER WEBSTER CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SHAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last summer, when the U.S. Supreme Court issued its controversial Webster 
abortion decision, the media responded with a barrage of apocalyptic stories 
predicting political and legislative revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the court ruling -- which ultimately gave states greater latitude 
in regulating abortion -- the Boston Globe said in a Page 1 story that "a 
majority of states" would be expected to "ban abortion in all but extreme 
circumstances" if the court made such a ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"No more than five states would retain the liberal guidelines" existing before 
the Webster decision, the Globe said. 
</P>
<P>
The Globe was not alone in what Colleen O'Connor, director of public education 
for the American Civil Liberties Union, calls the media "hysteria" that 
accompanied the Webster decision. 
</P>
<P>
Newsweek listed 19 states that were "likely to restrict abortion." Columnist 
Charles Krauthammer said an "avalanche of state legislation will soon be 
coming" to the Supreme Court for review. Peter Jennings, on ABC's "World News 
Tonight," said, "There is no political campaign in the country this year in 
which abortion does not play a role." 
</P>
<P>
Media coverage of the political impact of abortion was so massive in the 
immediate aftermath of Webster that a suburban Washington firm created "The 
Abortion Report," a daily, 10-page compendium of excerpts from news media 
reports on abortion and politics nationwide. Journalists and activists on both 
sides subscribed to the report. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion has indeed been big news on the political front in the year since 
Webster. But the actual political impact of the decision has not been nearly as 
great as predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Only one state -- Pennsylvania -- has enacted a new abortion law. One other -- 
Louisiana -- has passed an even stricter law, but the governor has threatened 
to veto it because it contains no exceptions for victims of rape or incest. Two 
other states have made far less sweeping modifications. Dozens of political 
campaigns have been conducted with abortion playing no role whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
"The media blew it," O'Connor says. Abortion-rights activists cried "wolf," and 
the media blew the house down. 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
Why was there a nationwide epidemic of what U.S. News &amp; World Report has 
labeled "abortion hype" and "hyperbolic news coverage" after Webster? 
</P>
<P>
One explanation is that most journalists support abortion rights, according to 
Times interviews and two major studies, and they shared and parroted that 
movement's fears that a "cataclysmic" disaster was at hand, as O'Connor puts 
it. 
</P>
<P>
But most journalists deny this, and U.S. News had a different explanation: 
"Reporters and advocates . . . share a professional interest in spreading 
alarmist predictions. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the threat of sudden, drastic change on an emotionally volatile 
issue always makes a good story. It gets reportorial adrenaline flowing. It 
gets television ratings. It sells newspapers and magazines. 
</P>
<P>
That may help explain why abortion clinic blockades by Operation Rescue and 
shrill pronouncements by leaders on both sides are given heavier coverage than, 
say, new medical developments. 
</P>
<P>
"Operation Rescue is a live news story," says Martin Nolan, editor of the 
editorial page of the Boston Globe. "It beats hell out of what's going on in 
some laboratory." 
</P>
<P>
But critics say the basic nature and limitations of the media and their 
sometimes sensational, often alarmist' approach to abortion coverage has made 
certain shortcomings in abortion coverage inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
Despite recent improvements, abortion coverage has generally been "very shallow 
. . . superficial," says Frances Kissling, executive director of Catholics for 
a Free Choice. "There's been very little investigative reporting . . . very 
little looking behind some of the statements . . . of either side . . . no 
attempt to give people the kind of information they need to make intelligent 
decisions." 
</P>
<P>
Karen Tumulty, who covered abortion for the Los Angeles Times for most of 1989, 
says the "real value that we have to add as the media is to give people the 
information they need to make up their own minds." 
</P>
<P>
Have the media done that on abortion? 
</P>
<P>
"No." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most obvious flaw in the media's coverage of abortion has been the 
tendency to turn abortion into an almost exclusively political story, often to 
the virtual exclusion of its personal, moral, ethical, medical and even legal 
ramifications. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gotten bogged down in reporting the political ups and downs of the 
sides, like we're covering sports, and we've gotten away from reporting the 
issues," says Barbara Brotman, who has written extensively about abortion for 
the Chicago Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
"With rare exceptions," Brotman says, "we haven't gone beyond the surface." 
</P>
<P>
Before the Webster decision, news organizations used medical, science and 
lifestyle writers to cover the different aspects of abortion. The medical and 
science writers in particular generally provided "more factual, better, more 
substantive coverage" than the political writers who have written and broadcast 
most of the abortion stories since Webster, says Kathy Bonk, co-director of the 
Communications Consortium, a Washington company that helps abortion-rights 
advocates plan media strategies. 
</P>
<P>
"Political reporters . . . by and large don't know how or don't do a good job 
covering issues," Bonk says. "They cover horse races . . . campaigns." 
</P>
<P>
The horse race and sports analogies are valid. Covering politics is like 
covering sports in that there's always a final score, a winner and a loser, 
clear resolutions that are much easier to write about than such murky, 
unsettled questions as "When does life begin?" or "Whose rights shall prevail 
-- the woman's or the fetus's?" 
</P>
<P>
Besides, political coverage has traditionally been a top priority for most news 
organizations -- a subject that the men who still run most of these 
organizations are comfortable with and interested in. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, at many news organizations, abortion was long regarded as a "soft 
story -- a women's story," and male editors routinely assigned it to women 
reporters, especially before the Webster decision. 
</P>
<P>
Several high-ranking male news executives said in interviews for this story 
that abortion is still not an issue that greatly interests them. Paul Friedman, 
executive producer of ABC's "World News Tonight," said he was "stunned the way 
this intensely personal issue has taken over the public debate . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I'm profoundly tired of the story," Friedman said. "As a citizen, I just 
resent the fact that it is taking so much time and attention away from other 
issues that are so critical." 
</P>
<P>
Friedman insists that his "entirely personal" attitude "doesn't affect how much 
we cover" abortion, though, and he says politics has dominated media coverage 
of abortion since Webster not because journalists are biased or sensationalist 
but because that's "the basic new part of the argument." 
</P>
<P>
Many other media executives agree. 
</P>
<P>
"The ethical debate, while intense, seems to me kind of frozen; most people 
have heard it," says Joseph Lelyveld, managing editor of the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
That's the unique challenge of covering abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a more frustrating story than many others because it's one to which it is 
very difficult to bring new ideas," says Henry Muller, managing editor of Time 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Because the abortion debate consists largely of two polarized, constantly 
repeated points of views, "I don't find a whole lot in the media that's very 
enlightening on this issue," Muller says. 
</P>
<P>
Time has tried to "find things that add to the discussion," Muller says, 
especially in a story by Garry Wills last year on Operation Rescue. Newsweek 
has done two cover stories on abortion, and network television has also tried a 
few long-form treatments of the subject -- "48 Hours" on CBS, several 
"Nightline" programs on ABC and a panel discussion after a movie based on the 
Roe vs. Wade case on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
But space and time limitations intrinsic to those media have largely prevented 
them from doing thoughtful stories on abortion with any regularity. Television, 
in particular, "tends to be superficial because of time constraints," says 
Douglas Johnson, legislative director for the National Right to Life Committee. 
</P>
<P>
TV reporters are essentially "quote-shopping" when they do an interview, 
Johnson says. 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers have often been guilty of superficiality, sensationalism and bias, 
too, but a few major papers gave individual reporters primary responsibility 
for abortion coverage last year in an effort to explore the broader issues 
involved in the abortion controversy. 
</P>
<P>
David Shribman of the Wall Street Journal has spent about 40% of his time as a 
political reporter doing abortion stories since the Webster decision, and he 
has managed to expand the relatively narrow confines of abortion and politics. 
He has written about the diversity within the anti-abortion movement; about 
grass-roots organizing efforts on both sides, and about the impact of the 
abortion controversy on the Catholic Church and the Republican and Democratic 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
Shribman says it took him "at least a month and at least a hundred phone calls" 
to find the 17-year-old Massachusetts girl he used as the focal point for a 
story in November on parental consent. 
</P>
<P>
"From a reporter's point of view, this (abortion) is a great issue to cover," 
he says. "Both sides are willing to talk endlessly . . . to be quoted . . . to 
help a reporter . . . to be open." 
</P>
<P>
Covering abortion forces a political reporter to speak with "people who are not 
professional politicians . . . normal people, not like the kind of people that 
you sit beside on the Bush White House plane," Shribman says. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way, it's very refreshing," he says, because it's easier to avoid the 
"pack mentality" than on a campaign, when reporters, politicians and 
consultants all "stay in the same hotel, eat the same food, breathe the same 
air and pretty soon, you contaminate each other." 
</P>
<P>
In trying to provide such refreshing coverage, to broaden and deepen coverage 
beyond the political arena, several other newspapers have made abortion, 
temporarily, a full-time beat, much as some papers did with AIDS a few years 
ago: 
</P>
<P>
At the Chicago Tribune, Barbara Brotman covered abortion from August, 1989, 
until mid-April this year, determined to write about "the fundamental 
differences between the two sides that go beyond whether they believe life 
begins at conception. I felt there were fundamental differences in how they 
looked at the world that had to do with how they saw woman's role in the world, 
how they saw the role of God in their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Brotman wrote an overview of "abortion in America," and also wrote about a home 
for unwed mothers; about feminists opposed to abortion; about post-abortion 
trauma; about women who have multiple abortions, and about individual women who 
"wrestled privately with the philosophical questions that inform the public 
debate" before having an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
At the Los Angeles Times, Karen Tumulty spent about half her time covering 
abortion during the first six months of 1989, then spent full-time on the issue 
for the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Tumulty wrote about abortions in the later stages of pregnancy, about the 
ambivalence most Americans feel toward abortion and about the shortage of 
doctors willing to work in abortion clinics; she also profiled both Randall 
Terry, the head of Operation Rescue, and Kate Michelman, executive director of 
the National Abortion Rights Action League. 
</P>
<P>
Tumulty didn't write as many major abortion stories as did reporters on the 
abortion beat at other papers, but other Times staffers have also written a 
number of such stories, among them one on the impact that criminalizing 
abortion would have on the adoption system and another on women who later 
regretted their abortions. 
</P>
<P>
At the Boston Globe, two reporters took on "Abortion: An American Divide" as a 
special project for all of 1989, starting even before the Webster decision. 
Ethan Bronner, who covers the Supreme Court for the Globe, wrote about the 
developing legal story, and Eileen McNamara wrote about the personal and moral 
side. 
</P>
<P>
McNamara went to Michigan to write about a 15-year-old rape victim and to 
Vermont to write about a company that was barring fertile women from skilled 
jobs involving high lead exposure; she wrote about a longtime abortionist and 
an early abortion crusader, about a family active in the fight against abortion 
and about why opposition to abortion is so strong in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
McNamara says she tried to do "non-obvious" stories and stories away from the 
fringes, where too much of the abortion debate is being waged. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion opponents argue, for example, that the current law "permits 
baby-killing right up to the moment of birth." But only one one-hundredth of 1% 
of all abortions -- about 100 of the 1.6 million abortions done annually in the 
United States -- occur after 24 weeks of pregnancy, according to the Alan 
Guttmacher Institute, a special affiliate of Planned Parenthood that does 
research on abortion and family planning. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, much has been written and said about abortion advocates' charges 
that making abortion illegal again would mean a return to the time when when 
"thousands" of women died every year from back-alley abortions. But the Centers 
for Disease Control says 39 women, not thousands, died from illegal abortions 
in 1972, the year before the U.S. Supreme Court legalized abortion with its Roe 
vs. Wade decision. 
</P>
<P>
Because abortion was illegal, many deaths surely went unreported. No one knows 
how many. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Bernard Nathanson, now a leading abortion opponent, says he invented the 
figure 10,000 when he was a leading abortion advocate, hoping to create public 
and political support for his movement. 
</P>
<P>
The media pay a great deal of attention to such charges made by various 
advocacy groups on both sides, but "Neither NOW (the National Organization for 
Women) nor Operation Rescue reflect the feelings of the American public about 
abortion, in my opinion," McNamara says. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, when she wrote about Operation Rescue, she focused on an ordinary family 
in the organization, rather than on Randall Terry, its founder. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Globe, the Washington Post has largely divided its abortion coverage 
between two reporters, both of whom spent about half their time on abortion 
over the last year. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Balz, a longtime political writer at the Post, covered the political impact 
of abortion until shifting to the White House beat this month, and -- along 
with the Wall Street Journal's Shribman -- he was widely praised by activists 
on both sides for his work on the abortion/politics beat. Balz will continue to 
write on abortion occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Gorney, whose beat at the Post is called "family and society," has a 
special interest in the history of abortion in the United States, something 
most of the media ignore. Gorney, who is working on a book about abortion, has 
written about clergymen who formed an underground network to help women get 
abortions when they were illegal; about a woman who developed a "menstrual 
extraction" abortion kit in 1971; about the origins of the Webster case and the 
key figures in it, and about the controversy surrounding parental consent. 
</P>
<P>
Even abortion opponents, who generally complain that the media are biased 
against them and superficial in their abortion coverage, think most of the work 
done by the various abortion specialists on these papers has been both fair and 
comprehensive. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Carpenter-McMillan, media spokeswoman for the Right to Life League of 
Southern California, for example, calls Tumulty's Los Angeles Times Magazine 
story on abortions in the later stages of pregnancy "the most unbiased thing 
I've ever seen, the best thing the Los Angeles Times has ever done (on 
abortion)." 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Myers, communications director for the National Right to Life Committee, 
offered similar, if somewhat less hyperbolic, praise for Gorney's Washington 
Post Magazine profile in April on John Willke, president of the National Right 
to Life Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters who frequently cover abortion come to know more about the subtleties 
and complexities of the subject and the sincerity of the people involved, which 
means "fairer coverage," Myers says. 
</P>
<P>
Making abortion a special beat doesn't guarantee "fairer coverage," of course. 
Nor does everyone agree on what constitutes "fair" coverage. Ramona Ripston, 
executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern 
California, did not think Tumulty's story was fair, for example, because 
relatively few abortions are actually done in the later stages of pregnancy (a 
point the story makes clear). 
</P>
<P>
But abortion is so broad a topic that no one or two reporters can cover the 
whole field, and even the best papers, with the best of intentions, have been 
criticized for bias, superficiality and sensationalism -- charges that most 
editors and reporters deny. But a few papers also win wide praise for specific 
stories, even without special beat assignments. 
</P>
<P>
The Miami Herald published a Sunday magazine story last fall on substandard 
conditions at many of the state's abortion clinics; the story led to a 
statewide investigation and the closure, at least temporarily, of four clinics. 
</P>
<P>
The Milwaukee Journal published the entire, 21-page typewritten text of 
Archbishop Rembert Weakland's statement criticizing the tactics of many in the 
pro-life movement, then printed more than a half-page of letters on the 
statement; Editor Sig Gissler says some priests in Milwaukee publicly urged 
their parishioners to buy the Journal to read the archbishop's statement. 
</P>
<P>
The Philadelphia Inquirer has given its readers some of the most aggressive and 
provocative abortion coverage in the country since the issue became a major 
controversy in Pennsylvania in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion opponents in Pennsylvania have vigorously criticized the Inquirer, 
accusing it of bias, imbalance and "prejudicial" language. One anti-abortion 
activist -- Ted Meehan, a member of the media committee for the Pennsylvania 
Pro-Life Coalition -- sent the paper a 23-page critique of its coverage. 
</P>
<P>
James Naughton, deputy managing editor of the paper, responded last week with a 
15-page rebuttal. Half a dozen top editors previously met with anti-abortion 
representatives to discuss their charges. 
</P>
<P>
Naughton concedes there is some validity to the criticism, "here and there," 
but both he and Executive Editor Eugene Roberts insist that the paper's 
coverage has been fair and balanced overall and that most of the criticism 
stems from the anti-abortionists' own subjective views and from their failure 
to understand the news-gathering process. 
</P>
<P>
The Inquirer has yet to create an abortion beat, but when the situation 
warranted it, the paper assigned a reporter to write about abortion full-time 
for weeks, sometimes months at a time. 
</P>
<P>
As far back as 1981, the Inquirer published a powerful account of the "hundreds 
of times a year in the United States (when) an aborted fetus emerges from the 
womb kicking and alive." The Inquirer has also published major stories on 
late-term abortions; on a municipal judge who "helped operate a network of 
abortion clinics in three states;" on the beliefs and motivations of various 
abortion protesters; on teen-agers involved in both sides of the abortion 
campaign; on the economic pressures put on companies by activists in the 
abortion debate, and on a doctor who performs abortions and who invited angry 
protesters to come into his office to counsel women seeking abortions. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times has also provided interesting, insightful abortion coverage 
at times, especially in recent months, without assigning a reporter to cover 
abortion full-time. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times has written major stories about doctors refusing to do 
abortions; about abortion protesters jailed in Vermont; about abortion and the 
Catholic Church; about abortion and politics in Iowa, Pennsylvania, Louisiana 
and Connecticut; about Operation Rescue, and about several abortion 
controversies in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Twice in the past year, the New York Times has published Page 1 stories on 
centers established by abortion opponents to provide unwed mothers with baby 
clothes, career counseling, legal assistance and housing -- "the pretty side of 
the right-to-life movement," as the director of one such center said in the 
paper's May 13 story. 
</P>
<P>
Activists on both sides say media coverage has generally improved of late, but 
they still think critical issues go largely uncovered. Many reporters agree. 
The moral implications of the abortion debate, in particular, are generally 
ignored or treated superficially in newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that's why the most thoughtful stories on the moral dilemma of abortion 
have generally been done by magazines, most notably by Jason DeParle last year 
in the Washington Monthly and by Mary Gordon last spring in The Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion opponents cite the possible economic impact of abortion as another 
area that the media -- newspapers, magazines and television alike -- have 
generally ignored. What would the state of the U.S. economy be today, they ask, 
if many of the more than 20 million fetuses aborted since the Supreme Court's 
1973 Roe vs. Wade decision were now alive? 
</P>
<P>
Michael Novak of the American Enterprise Institute in Washington says the media 
should write about the effect all these potential consumers and workers might 
ultimately have on the "looming labor shortage," the closure of some schools 
and the future of the Social Security system. 
</P>
<P>
Because poor people have a disproportionately large number of abortions, one 
could also ask what the effect of legalization might be on the tax base, 
welfare rolls and various other social programs. 
</P>
<P>
And what, for that matter, is the psychological effect of legalized abortion on 
our society? Because liberals often argue that capital punishment contributes 
to a climate of violence and a cheapening of human life, conservatives would 
like to see the media examine whether abortion has had the same effect. After 
all, the United States -- which has one of the highest abortion rates in the 
Western world -- also has one of the highest murder rates in the Western world. 
Is there a connection? 
</P>
<P>
The analogy may not be valid, the connection non-existent, but few in the media 
have even raised the question. 
</P>
<P>
Nor have the media written much about the ramifications of new medical 
developments related to abortion and contraception, say Janny Scott and Robert 
Steinbrook, medical writers at the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
Although some abortion opponents argue that greater availability of 
contraception leads to more sexual activity, more unintended pregnancies and 
more abortions, studies strongly suggest just the opposite -- that more 
effective, more accessible means of contraception would mean fewer unintended 
pregnancies and fewer abortions. Either way, contraception is -- or should be 
-- part of the abortion story. 
</P>
<P>
But Scott says the problems of reproduction and contraception are "felt far 
more profoundly by women than men," and she wonders if this explains why such 
issues may be "given short shrift in papers where . . . the editors are 
primarily men." 
</P>
<P>
Scott and Steinbrook are especially critical of their own paper in this regard, 
and they cite several examples, among them coverage in February of a report 
issued by the National Research Council and the Institute of Medicine. That 
report said the United States now lags far behind many other countries in 
developing new methods of birth control, a lag resulting in many unwanted 
pregnancies and unnecessary abortions. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times and Washington Post put the story on Page 1. The Los Angeles 
Times put it on Page 24. 
</P>
<P>
Times editors deny that gender bias or insensitivity influenced the placement 
of this (or any) story. Norman C. Miller, national editor of The Times, says 
the story wound up on Page 24, in part because there were "other strong stories 
that day" and in part because international news generally precedes national 
news on the inside pages of the paper. (After Page 5, where a story appears in 
the main news section of The Times generally has less to do with the story's 
importance than with the configuration of available space on the pages.) 
</P>
<P>
But international news also precedes national news in the New York Times, and 
both the New York Times and the Washington Post had "other strong stories that 
day," and both still put the contraception story on Page 1. 
</P>
<P>
The basic problems of abortion coverage in the media go beyond one issue or one 
story or one newspaper, though. Despite recent improvements and a conscientious 
effort by most journalists, critics say coverage often remains biased and 
superficial, as previous stories in this series have documented. 
</P>
<P>
Television "rakes off the emotional energy" on abortion, providing "the 
passions . . . lots of demonstrations, people yelling, very colorful sound 
bites," and the print media provide the political and legal arguments on both 
sides, says Robert Lichter, co-director of the Center for Media and Public 
Affairs in Washington, but "no one gives you context." 
</P>
<P>
Critics often say much the same thing about media coverage of other important 
issues, just as they often accuse the media of bias on other issues. But 
abortion is an especially sensitive, complex and volatile issue, and just as 
some journalists do seem to have more trouble keeping their personal feelings 
from unfairly influencing their stories on abortion than on other issues, so 
coverage of abortion does seem more superficial and lacking in perspective than 
does coverage of other issues. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that's inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
"At base, abortion isn't about politics, and it isn't about the law," says 
reporter Eileen McNamara of the Boston Globe. "It's about philosophy and it's 
about morality and it's about your world view, and newspapers are ill-equipped 
to deal with those issues."

RESTAURANTS CALL FOR SMOKING BAN IN PUBLIC PLACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATT MORRISON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what it says is a significant change of heart and not a change in tactics, 
the California Restaurant Assn. declared Tuesday that it would support an 
outright, statewide smoking ban in restaurants -- but only if smoking is also 
banned in all other public places. 
</P>
<P>
The organization, representing owners of about 10,000 restaurants, said its 
decision is largely an acknowledgment of new data on the risks of secondhand 
smoke. Such a legislative ban could leapfrog local smoking regulations, like 
those in place in Los Angeles and many other California cities, as well as Los 
Angeles Councilman Marvin Braude's proposal to ban restaurant smoking 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in the smoking section of a downtown restaurant, 
association officials disclosed that they are drafting legislation that would 
enact the smoking ban. They said it would be "premature" to define a public 
place, although a representative in Sacramento said it would include such spots 
as bowling alleys, sports arenas and theaters. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than point a finger to the workplace or to other environments where 
secondhand smoke far exceeds that in restaurants," said incoming association 
President Ted Burke, "the restaurant industry . . . encourages a total ban on 
smoking in each and every public place in California, without exception or 
exclusion." 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant association is one of the most influential lobbies in 
Sacramento, its members representing everything from food contractors to haute 
cuisine. It has battled smoking regulations at all levels, urging voluntary 
changes on its members, many of whom have found nonsmoking sections to be 
profitable. 
</P>
<P>
The California-based Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights lauded the "breakthrough" 
turnabout in the position of the restaurant owners, but in the next breath said 
it was doomed by the cigarette industry's leverage in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased the restaurant association now recognizes that secondhand 
smoke is a public health problem," said Julia Carol, associate director of the 
anti-smoking group. She predicted that a total ban would not come about because 
the Legislature is "in the hip pocket" of tobacco interests. 
</P>
<P>
Braude said that while he was glad the group had recognized the dangers of 
smoke, the overreaching goals of such legislation makes it look like "a 
conspiracy to destroy local initiative." 
</P>
<P>
"That acknowledgment is very good indeed," said Braude, who got smoking banned 
in elevators a decade ago and has since carried forward his anti-smoking 
campaign. "But I've seen many times when industry groups use the state 
Legislature to preempt local government from regulating their industry and 
protecting the public health, and I'm very suspicious of their motives for 
wanting this to go to Sacramento, and I'm also suspicious of the claim that you 
should regulate it everywhere -- that restaurants aren't any different from any 
other public places." 
</P>
<P>
Braude added that "it's clear they're fearful (because) they've resorted to 
such a tactic, admitting something ought to be done . . . What they're saying 
is the city should not have the power to control the local health and safety of 
their own community . . . The net effect is to organize to prevent the city of 
Los Angeles from proceeding, but they will not do so. We shall prevail and the 
tobacco industry is not gonna win on this." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Jo Thompson, the restaurant association's senior director of government 
affairs and general counsel, said she has finished the first draft of the bill, 
which could not be introduced in the Legislature before January. Beyond 
prohibiting smoking in eating and drinking places, the proposal would ban 
smoking in "every public place, including bowling alleys, sports arenas, 
theaters," she said. It would not apply, for instance, to an employee cafeteria 
at a privately owned plant, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are fairly certain that our proposal is going to get a lot of pummeling. We 
have been pummeled before. We'll just have to take what comes," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the association is looking for a legislator who will carry the bill. 
It is certain to draw the attention of a large number of legislative combatants 
ranging from local governments to the tobacco lobby, health and medical 
interests, and restaurant and bar owners. 
</P>
<P>
Braude and the nonsmoking group are concerned that the legislation might pose a 
risk to smoking regulations already in place. One fear is that the legislation 
would be so sweeping in defining "public" that the Legislature would back away 
from it. Alternatively, they worry that any watered down compromise would 
impose less than rigorous standards statewide, possibly cutting off at the 
knees more stringent local measures. 
</P>
<P>
Legislation that would enact a smoking ban "is not going to hurt us at all," 
said Carol, of the anti-smoking group. "The only thing that would hurt us is a 
state law with preemption (of more rigorous local standards) in it, and we'd 
fight that tooth and nail, and it wouldn't pass." 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant association's executive vice president, Stan Kyker, dismissed 
local restrictions as "piecemeal" and confusing. "If secondhand smoke is a 
health hazard, then it is a health hazard for employees as well as customers, 
and it is a health hazard in all types of establishments in all parts of the 
states," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Association officials said the about-face, which came on a 90-0 vote at the 
June meeting of its board of directors, was not a direct response to Braude's 
May 29 proposal for a total restaurant smoking ban, the toughest in any major 
U.S. city. 
</P>
<P>
It is a reaction "only to the degree that Los Angeles becomes part of that 
patchwork quilt (of regulations) that is beginning to develop all over the 
state," said Kyker. "To say that it had absolutely nothing to do with it would 
be shortsighted, but to say that it is a response to it is also clearly too 
simplistic." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the country, local government agencies have sometimes been more 
vigorous in legislating matters from gun control to fireworks and smoking 
issues. In part, it is because lobbying money and special-interest leverage are 
often more effectively employed at the state level. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant association opposed piecemeal legislation as creating unfair 
competition between restaurants in neighboring cities. Kyker said it also would 
be against any state legislation banning smoking in restaurants alone, without 
including other public places. 
</P>
<P>
"Our board believes it is not a rights, moral or ethical issue," Thompson said. 
"It is simply a health issue. We feel beyond a reasonable doubt that secondhand 
smoke is a real health problem, especially for employees." 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, and up until this year, we have understood the smoking 
controversy to be a rights or moral issue that we felt we didn't have any 
business making any judgments about," she said. "Our board was not pro- or 
anti-smoking. They just wanted to accommodate those who wanted to eat at the 
restaurant or drink at the bar. They wanted people to be happy." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said the reversal also came in the wake of passage of the anti-toxics 
Proposition 65 in 1986, which, among other things, required the posting of 
signs where food is served warning of the hazards to health of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
"Our board looked at that and they felt this was the beginning of their 
acknowledgment that maybe there is something to the scientific studies that 
secondhand smoke is dangerous," she said.

DYNASTY: THE RICHARDSON FAMILY HAS OWNED AND OPERATED THE GENERAL STORE IN A 
SONOMA COUNTY HAMLET SINCE IT WAS BUILT IN 1868.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Point Arena High School bus driver Bill Benedict pulled up beside the 
122-year-old general store as he does every afternoon during the school year. 
</P>
<P>
The students, who are dropped off at their rural homes along the 70-mile, 1 
1/2-hour route, piled out to stretch, to buy a soft drink, something to nibble 
on. A few picked up groceries for Mom. 
</P>
<P>
Benedict's school bus is but one of the traditions at this turn-back-the-clock 
hamlet perched on a bluff overlooking the rugged Sonoma County coast 110 miles 
northwest of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The weather-beaten old store, Stewarts Point General Merchandise, is another. 
It has been owned and operated by the same family since it was built in 1868. 
</P>
<P>
"You might call it an emporium," laughed Archer R. (Bus) Richardson, 71, who 
worked in the store from the time he was 6 until he retired at 67 four years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
It is jammed floor-to-ceiling with thousands of items. "If we don't have it, we 
will get it for you," allowed Richardson's son, Archer J., who now runs the 
store as did his father, grandfather and great-grandfather before him. He, too, 
has been working here since he was 6 years old. 
</P>
<P>
The old redwood shelves are piled high with canned goods, clothing, sports 
equipment, lanterns, nuts and bolts, tools and other hardware, cast-iron 
cookware, fresh vegetables and fruit, you name it. The store's 1875 liquor 
license is nailed to one wall. 
</P>
<P>
Hanging from the ceiling are rubber boots and other modern items for sale and a 
sampling of Richardson family heirlooms, like the 1888 Studebaker baby buggy, a 
160-year-old wheelbarrow, and turn-of-the-century fish traps, horse collars and 
oxen yoke. 
</P>
<P>
Top shelves are cluttered with dust-covered high-button shoes, home remedies, 
old wagon lanterns, buggy whips, candle molds and numerous other items of the 
past still in the store's inventory, but no longer for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Hornet and yellow jacket nests, stuffed fish and colorful abalone shells hang 
from the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
The floors squeak with age. Shopping carts purchased in 1948 are still used by 
customers, many of whom have charge accounts and pay their bills monthly. 
Patrons of the old-fashioned general store are 500 ranchers and rural residents 
within a 30-mile radius, and people just passing through. 
</P>
<P>
The first Richardson to own and operate the store was Herbert Archer 
Richardson, who arrived here from 
</P>
<P>
Franconia, N.H., in 1876 with a new bride and 40 cents in his pocket. 
</P>
<P>
He quickly became a timber baron, and as the years passed he bought 25,000 
acres, including eight miles of shoreline. He ran cattle and sheep and employed 
more than 300 lumberjacks cutting and processing redwood shipped out of 
Stewarts Point on his nine sailing vessels. 
</P>
<P>
Lumber was hauled on the nine-mile Richardson Railroad to where the old store 
is located. Logs were carried the last half-mile to Richardson Harbor on rail 
cars mounted on wooden tracks. Brakemen gingerly guided the cars down a steep 
slope on a gravity run to the edge of the cliff. 
</P>
<P>
From the cliff, the logs were loaded onto a chute and carried to the decks of 
lumber ships tied up at the Richardson Wharf. Oxen pulled the empty cars back 
up the steep slope. 
</P>
<P>
In 1926, when Highway 1 was finally pushed through to Stewarts Point, the 
lumber ships were replaced by trucks. Lumbering activity slowed considerably 
during the Great Depression. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Richardson clan still run sheep, cattle and a small timber 
operation on the 25,000 acres now owned by the descendants of the original 
timber baron. 
</P>
<P>
Bus Richardson, his father and his grandfather were postmasters at Stewarts 
Point from 1876 to 1984, when Ray Berleyoung, 52, who worked in the store for 
30 years, became the postmaster. 
</P>
<P>
The room above the store was a dance hall until the late 1940s. Then the 
Richardsons called it quits, worried that the building might fall apart because 
it shook so much from the dancers. 
</P>
<P>
Across from the old store are two lichen-covered, bare-wood abandoned hotels 
built in the 1880s. Bus Richardson's 70-year-old brother, Harold, who still 
works from sunup to sundown logging in the woods, has lived in one of the 
hotels all his life. 
</P>
<P>
The Richardsons are a hard-working clan living simple lives in 19th-Century 
homes filled with 19th-Century furniture. 
</P>
<P>
And to this day, the heart and soul of this community is still the 1868 
Stewarts Point General Merchandise store.

ISRAEL'S AMBASSADOR TO EGYPT RESIGNS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Israel's ambassador to Egypt, Shimon Shamir, resigned Tuesday, saying he could 
not effectively represent the policies of his country's new right-wing 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt the platform of the new government was one with which I find it very 
difficult to identify, and therefore it would be much more effective if that 
government was represented by someone closer to their views," said Shamir, who 
had been a key intermediary in efforts to set up a dialogue between Israelis 
and Palestinians in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir, an academic who was appointed Israel's third ambassador to Egypt in 
August, 1988, denied that his resignation was a direct response to the new 
Israeli government's rejection of the dialogue proposal. He said there are 
still signs that Israel is moving toward peace with Palestinians in the 
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not a reaction to the situation with the peace process, which has not 
yet been exhausted," he said in an interview with The Times. "What I can tell 
you personally is that I hope very much the way will be found to achieve a 
breakthrough." 
</P>
<P>
However, Western diplomats here said that Shamir was recently summoned to 
Jerusalem to consult on a new communique from Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Shamir to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak outlining the new Israeli 
government's proposals for advancing the peace process. Though the contents of 
the letter have not been made public, his resignation followed those 
consultations, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli newspaper Haaretz, quoting unnamed confidants of the ambassador, 
said Shamir went to the "highest levels" of the Israeli Foreign Ministry in an 
apparently unsuccessful attempt to "soften the hard line" of the letter, 
reportedly drafted by the prime minister's chief of staff, Yossi Ben-Aharon. 
</P>
<P>
An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said she was not familiar in detail 
with the contents of the communique but added that "it spoke about a desire to 
advance the peace process and said the government is still sticking by its 
peace initiative of 1989." 
</P>
<P>
That initiative proposed the election of Palestinian leaders for limited 
self-rule in the occupied territories, but the proposal became bogged down over 
procedures to select a Palestinian delegation to hold talks with the Israelis 
about setting up the elections. 
</P>
<P>
The new government recently rejected many key points of U.S. Secretary of State 
James A. Baker III's proposal for convening the dialogue, particularly 
proposals to allow Palestinians deported from the territories or residents of 
East Jerusalem to act as delegates to the talks. 
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Shamir confirmed that he had consulted on a letter from the prime 
minister to Mubarak, but he declined to discuss the contents. 
</P>
<P>
"It expressed the views and perceptions of the prime minister about our 
Egyptian-Israeli relations, the peace process and the situation in the region," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The ambassador emphasized that he had made his decision to resign at the time 
the new government was formed by Prime Minister Shamir's right-wing Likud Party 
on June 11. He said he delayed submitting it until new Foreign Minister David 
Levy was discharged from the hospital after a mild heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
"In the U.S., I might point out, all ambassadors resign when there is a new 
president," he said. "It's a matter of harmony that does exist or does not." 
</P>
<P>
In a separate interview with Israeli government radio, the ambassador said that 
his resignation "is a matter of my broad outlook, my belief system, of my 
personal position on questions of domestic and foreign affairs, social, 
cultural and so on. The present government has a specific platform that I feel 
I'm not the right person to represent."

CHINA, INDONESIA TO RESUME RELATIONS 
</P>

<P>
China and Indonesia agreed Tuesday to resume diplomatic relations that were 
suspended 23 years ago over Beijing's alleged support for a coup attempt by 
Indonesian Communists. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng will travel to Jakarta on a goodwill visit to mark the 
official resumption of ties, which is set for Aug. 8, according to a communique 
issued by the two governments. 
</P>
<P>
"We have just signed a document of historic significance," Chinese Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen told reporters Tuesday at a joint press conference held 
with his Indonesian counterpart, Ali Alatas, after the communique-signing 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Qian and Alatas, who acted like old friends as they fielded questions, said 
resumption of diplomatic ties would lead to a major expansion of economic links 
between the two countries and contribute to peace in the Asia-Pacific region. 
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, which with 177 million people is the world's fifth most populous 
country, first recognized Beijing's Communist regime in 1950 but suspended 
relations in 1967, two years after an attempted Communist coup in Jakarta that 
Indonesia alleged was backed by China. 
</P>
<P>
Resumption of relations, which has been under negotiation since early last 
year, marks an important diplomatic breakthrough for Beijing as it attempts to 
repair international ties damaged by its violent crackdown on pro-democracy 
protests last year. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the normalization process, each country pledged non-interference in 
the other's internal affairs. Indonesia also agreed to repay $84 million owed 
China from loans made before 1965. 
</P>
<P>
Resumption of Sino-Indonesian ties also lays the groundwork for Singapore to 
extend diplomatic recognition to Beijing. Singapore, which is primarily 
populated by ethnic Chinese, has long said it would not establish ties with 
Beijing until Indonesia did so. The explanation for this has been that it did 
not want to be perceived as a beachhead for Chinese influence in Southeast 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Qian said Tuesday that preparations are now under way for talks with Singapore 
on establishment of diplomatic relations. 
</P>
<P>
China has long sought renewed ties with Indonesia, but Jakarta held back 
largely from fear that Beijing would seek influence among Indonesia's 4 million 
ethnic Chinese. Ethnic Chinese are a major force in Indonesian trade, banking 
and manufacturing, and are a frequent target of envy and distrust by ethnic 
Indonesians. 
</P>
<P>
Before 1965, ethnic Chinese also were a major force in the Indonesian Communist 
Party. The abortive 1965 coup was followed by a right-wing backlash and a wave 
of killings directed largely against suspected Communists and ethnic Chinese. 
The violence, in which hundreds of thousands of people are believed to have 
died, basically wiped out the Indonesian Communist Party, which at the time was 
the third largest in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Qian, in a statement Tuesday reiterating that Beijing would have no relations 
with Indonesian Communists, said that China does not even know whether the 
Indonesian Communist Party still exists. 
</P>
<P>
Direct trade between Indonesia and China was resumed in 1985, with two-way 
trade last year totaling $920 million. 
</P>
<P>
Alatas said Tuesday that "after the resumption of full diplomatic relations, 
one of the first things to follow will be to work for a new trade agreement 
between us."

LAWMAKERS GOT $1.4 MILLION FROM DEFENSE FIRMS AND $1.1 MILLION FROM FINANCIAL

<P>
The defense and financial services industries, both of which have big stakes in 
pending legislative battles, paid House and Senate members more than $2.5 
million in appearance fees last year -- accounting for more than a quarter of 
all congressional honorariums. 
</P>
<P>
A Times computer-assisted study of 1989 financial disclosure reports found that 
members of Congress received more than $1.4 million in speaking fees from the 
defense industry and $1.1 million from banking and financial interests. 
</P>
<P>
Defense contractors have been threatened with losing billions of dollars worth 
of business as a result of deep budget cuts proposed by the Pentagon; the 
financial services industry is at war over proposals that would allow banks to 
offer a broader array of services. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the tobacco industry, which has been besieged by anti-smoking initiatives 
in Congress, spent more than $418,000 on appearance fees for members of 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the largest sums from defense and financial services went to 
members of committees that oversee these sectors of the economy. Most of the 
tobacco money went to lawmakers from tobacco-growing states like North Carolina 
and Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the continued generosity of those firms last year was somewhat 
unexpected, because some members of Congress have publicly renounced 
honorariums in the last year and a few companies have adopted policies 
prohibiting payment of such fees to politicians. They include three major 
defense contractors: Lockheed Corp., General Dynamics Corp. and McDonnell 
Douglas Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Honorariums paid to members of Congress who speak at trade group functions and 
similar events have become the subject of increasing scrutiny in recent years. 
For many lawmakers, they have become an important source of income to 
supplement their congressional salaries. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning next year, House members will be forbidden by law to accept 
honorariums, but senators will be free to take as much as $23,568 each. In 
1989, by contrast, House members were permitted to pocket up to $26,850 in 
appearance fees, and senators could accept as much as $35,850. Any fees in 
excess of those ceilings had to be donated to charity. 
</P>
<P>
Among financial industry lobbying groups, the scandal-scarred Chicago Board of 
Trade and Chicago Mercantile Assn. commodity exchanges led the way by paying 
$141,000 in honorariums last year. As a result of alleged fraud in the Chicago 
commodities market, Congress is considering legislation that would provide for 
stricter regulation of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Congress also received $77,500 from the Securities Industry Assn., 
$53,000 from the American Bankers Assn., $28,000 from the Equitable Life 
Insurance Society and $26,000 from Massachusetts Mutual Life -- all of which 
are involved in lobbying on legislation that would restructure the financial 
services industry. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and 
Means Committee, was far and away the biggest beneficiary of financial services 
largess. In fact, fees from the industry have helped make him Congress' 
honorarium leader over the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
Of the $285,000 in honorariums Rostenkowski received in 1989, $122,500 came 
from industries with a big stake in the votes of the Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Like Rostenkowski, all of the top 10 House recipients of honorariums from the 
financial services industry were either members of the Ways and Means or 
Banking committees. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop Corp., whose B-2 bomber program could be sharply reduced this year, 
led defense contractors by distributing $74,000 in honorariums last year. Close 
behind were Textron Inc., $56,000; LTV Corp., $51,400; Rockwell International 
Corp., $44,000, and Boeing Co., $34,000. Textron and Boeing are fighting a 
Pentagon decision against production of the V-22 Osprey helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
All of the top recipients of defense industry honorariums are members of 
defense-related committees, except Rostenkowski, who received $25,000 in fees 
from those companies. He got as much as Reps. William Dickenson (R-Ala.), 
ranking GOP member of the House Armed Services Committee, and Rep. C.W. Bill 
Young (R-Fla.), a member of the Defense appropriations subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed paid $17,500 in honorariums last year before abolishing the practice. 
</P>
<P>
The Tobacco Institute distributed $106,275 in honorariums to members of 
Congress last year, much of it to those who attended the industry's annual golf 
outing near Palm Springs, Calif. Among the tobacco companies, RJR Nabisco Corp. 
was the honorarium leader, with $97,000, followed by $86,000 from Phillip 
Morris Cos. and $35,500 from U.S. Tobacco Co. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the top recipients of tobacco honorariums, such as Sens. Mitch 
McConnell (R-Ky.), Wendell H. Ford (D-Ky.) and Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and Rep. 
Charlie Rose (D-N.C.), are closely identified with the industry. Although Sen. 
Wyche Fowler Jr. (D-Ga.) is not an outspoken advocate for the industry, he 
serves on the committee that oversees tobacco interests.

PATAG, Philippines 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This impoverished mountain village was already asleep at 10 p.m. on June 13 
when three youths with assault rifles went to the only house with an orange 
Frisbee on the porch and softly knocked on the door. 
</P>
<P>
"We are the NPA," they said. "We want to talk to Tim." 
</P>
<P>
After 20 minutes of talk, the guerrillas from the Communist New People's Army 
ordered U.S. Peace Corps volunteer Timothy Swanson out the door and into the 
vast rugged mountains of northern Negros Island. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'I have no choice,' " said his new Filipina bride, Merle, meeting 
reporters Tuesday for the first time. "Of course he left with tears in his 
eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"They promised me they are going to return Tim in four days," she said, weeping 
openly. "But until now, nothing." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Philippine investigators are stymied in their search for Swanson, a 
shy, lanky 26-year-old forester from Cheyenne, Wyo. They've had no word yet 
from his abductors and have found few clues to a kidnaping that marks a new 
phase of anti-American terrorism in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
"They've had him three weeks," one investigator said in frustration. "The trail 
is very cold. . . . We may be in for a long haul." 
</P>
<P>
Merle Swanson, a 31-year-old local sixth-grade teacher, did not tell 
authorities her husband was missing until a message arrived from Manila on June 
27 saying all Peace Corps volunteers were being evacuated from the Philippines 
because of NPA threats. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the NPA) asked me not to tell anyone," she said, crying again and 
pounding her fist on the table. "Of course, I did not. I just care for his 
safety." 
</P>
<P>
Although Swanson sent a letter to his wife on June 19 asking for clothes and 
books, no one collected the bundle. It sits in their two-room, tin-roofed 
house, together with his dogeared copies of Newsweek, a battered Sony Walkman 
and a favorite John Denver tape. 
</P>
<P>
Philippine officials say they will not send military patrols to search for 
Swanson in the mist-shrouded mountains and dense jungle that they concede is 
largely controlled by the guerrillas. Army operations only made matters worse 
for Fumio Mizuno, a Japanese rural technician and longtime resident who was 
abducted by the NPA in a nearby village May 29 and has not been released. 
</P>
<P>
"The result was the NPA took (Mizuno) further and further away, and made our 
search more difficult," said Daniel Lacson, governor of Negros Occidental 
province. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we're shifting to a new tactic," he added. "We're waiting. We're hoping 
they get in touch with us soon." 
</P>
<P>
So far, six U.S. Embassy officials and three Peace Corps workers who know the 
area and the dialect, Ilongo, have joined the tense wait at the Garden Hotel in 
Bacolod, the provincial capital, about 300 miles south-southeast of Manila. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators have pored over Swanson's diary. They are checking reports of 
sightings by local loggers. They have shown his wife photos of known Negros NPA 
leaders, including two former priests. They even brought in a sketch artist to 
try to help her identify the abductors. 
</P>
<P>
"The claim he's very familiar with the NPA is not true," said one investigator, 
addressing reports that Swanson was close to the NPA and might have gone 
willingly. "He did not know these guys. Neither does she." 
</P>
<P>
Patag, a village of about 140 families, sits on a mountain saddle about 30 
miles northeast of Bacolod. It is sugar cane country, where landless laborers 
cut cane for $1.50 a day -- half the minimum wage -- on giant haciendas, and 
starvation is never far away. 
</P>
<P>
Neither is the NPA. Officials say that military offensives farther south on 
Negros last year forced hundreds of NPA guerrillas into the hills around Patag, 
still honeycombed with Japanese bunkers and tunnels from World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Army patrols destroyed NPA jungle camps three towns away in March, but the 
guerrillas quickly regrouped. 
</P>
<P>
On May 3, guerrillas abducted the Patag village captain, Pepito Valiente, from 
his home at gunpoint. He was marched blindfolded for a day and a night into the 
hills. 
</P>
<P>
"I fainted, and my husband was terrified," said his wife, Magelinde. 
</P>
<P>
When he was returned, Valiente said the rebels had interrogated him about the 
nursery and an irrigation project. They also asked about the quiet, 
curly-haired American. 
</P>
<P>
But by then, Swanson already knew. On May 4, NPA troops suddenly emerged from 
the jungle at his project site, a tree nursery outside the village where he 
cultivated neat rows of tiny seedlings in black plastic bags. 
</P>
<P>
"They were very polite," said his wife. "They just asked about his work. . . . 
But he told me he was quite afraid of these people." 
</P>
<P>
According to his wife, his friends in Patag, and his diary, it was his first 
encounter with the NPA. 
</P>
<P>
The NPA is the armed wing of the outlawed Philippine Communist Party, the rural 
insurgency that has left thousands dead since 1969. But as their numbers have 
fallen, they have targeted Americans to highlight their cause. 
</P>
<P>
Eight Americans have been killed in incidents blamed on the guerrillas since 
April, 1989. In May, they threatened to kill more Americans unless U.S. troops 
are withdrawn and six U.S. military facilities closed in the Philippines. 
Swanson is the first American they have kidnaped. 
</P>
<P>
As elsewhere on Negros, where the NPA controls up to one-third of the villages, 
the people in Patag are caught between the rebels and the military. 
</P>
<P>
"There's NPA all over now," one farmer said nervously. "At night, when the dogs 
are barking, I open my window a little and see them on the street. So we close 
our eyes and say nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Father Danilo Paderna, who married the Swansons at the San Diego Church in 
Silay City on May 29, says the villagers in his parish are "in-between." 
</P>
<P>
"When the NPA passes through, they may go to your house and ask for food and 
decide to sleep there," he said. "Then the people are afraid. If the military 
knows, they will go after them." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Swanson stood out in Patag. After two years, he still bumped 
his head on the low doorways, and he still drew crowds of giggling children. He 
was godfather to Elias Oyco Jr.'s three children and godson to town counselor 
Felix Alpas. 
</P>
<P>
"When we found Tim is gone, people are crying," said Alpas, 63. "He's a good 
man. He gives us seeds and fertilizer. He helps us." 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody loved Tim," said Narry Dumagat, 52, who proudly showed Swanson's 
parents, brother and sister around when they flew in for the wedding and spent 
a night in the Patag school. "He was good to the farmers." 
</P>
<P>
Swanson, who attended the University of Chicago, asked the Peace Corps to 
extend his tour to a third year in Patag earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a quiet, well-motivated, modest guy who believes he's doing good 
things," said one official who reviewed his Peace Corps file. "This is a guy 
who takes quiet satisfaction in getting five farmers to plant gardens. He takes 
modest pleasure in getting his village to try new seeds. . . . And he felt he 
really needed one more year to round off the job in the right way." 
</P>
<P>
For now, U.S. and Philippine officials can only speculate on why Swanson was 
snatched. They cite four theories: the NPA is trying to embarrass President 
Corazon Aquino's government, trying to discourage foreign investment in Negros, 
trying to divert military operations or trying to "punish" Americans. None of 
them offer much hope for an early release. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason for this was political," said Gov. Lacson. "And the more mileage 
they get, the longer they'll hold onto Tim." 
</P>
<P>
His wife said she is praying only that he is alive. 
</P>
<P>
"His last words were, 'Merle, don't worry, I'll be back,' " she said. Then she 
cried again. 
</P>

Timothy Swanson described the ordeal to reporters, left. Merle Swanson said 
that three gunmen came to the door of their Philippine village on June 13. 
Swanson told his bride of a few weeks: "I have no choice . . . I will be back." 
Investigators have not heard from the abductors and have few clues. The 
incident marks a new phase of anti-American terrorism in the Philippines.

CHANGING ROLE OF THE ONCE-FEARED KGB DRAWS CHUCKLES AT CONGRESS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It may be just the latest symptom of crisis in Soviet society, but it was the 
chairman of the KGB who drew the biggest laugh of the day from Communist Party 
leaders on Tuesday as he gave a dire survey of the forces menacing the country 
from within and without. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, chairman of the Soviet state security agency, noted that 
with crime, ethnic strife and political extremism on the rise, people are 
asking, "Where's the KGB looking?" He provoked guffaws from delegates to the 
28th Communist Party Congress when he supplied the answer: "In general, we're 
looking where we should." 
</P>
<P>
Once the Soviet state's mechanism for hounding or brutally muzzling dissidents 
like human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov, the KGB is now fighting 
organized crime and protecting the "constitutional order" in line with the 
liberalization of society under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the woeful consequences of the relaxed Kremlin controls, like the 
existence of tens of thousands of refugees fleeing ethnic violence, make 
reports from KGB operatives across the country sometimes read like dispatches 
from a war front, Kryuchkov, a member of the party's ruling Politburo, said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that Afghanistan's leadership has launched a campaign of "national 
reconciliation" to end civil war there. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to speak today about national reconciliation in our country," the 
nation's top secret police officer told the congress. 
</P>
<P>
Kryuchkov said it would be wrong to see "the hand of special services" of 
foreign countries in all the Soviet Union's domestic ills, and he stressed the 
need for heightened vigilance despite the dramatic improvement in ties with the 
United States and other Western countries. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, the positive changes in international relations gave rise to 
the view among some Soviet people reflecting the other extreme, namely, a full 
or partial loss of the sense of danger, the underestimating of the threat to 
the political power of the Soviet people." 
</P>
<P>
In the past three or four years alone, dozens of citizens working as spies for 
foreign powers have been unmasked, he said. 
</P>

Kryuchkov said a new law has been drafted that for the first time would clearly 
define the functions of the KGB, which has nicknamed itself "the sword and 
shield of the party." Some progressives want the KGB banned from domestic 
activity as a discredited tool for Communist control over individual citizens.

2 KOREAS OK HIGH-LEVEL TALKS IN MAJOR STEP TOWARD RECONCILIATION

North Korea and South Korea took a major step toward reconciliation Tuesday and 
agreed to a historic meeting between their top government leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The talks could be held as early as August, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates from the two countries met at the border truce village of Panmunjom 
and agreed to sign an accord July 26 that would outline a proposed agenda and 
procedures for the first meeting of prime ministers. 
</P>
<P>
It would be the first such meeting since the division of the peninsula in 1945 
into the Communist north and capitalist south. 
</P>
<P>
In earlier talks, both sides agreed that the summit would be held alternately 
in the countries' capitals. Each side would have seven representatives, 
including the prime minister and two military delegates. 
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough on a summit came after South Korea accepted North Korea's 
proposal to place political and military topics ahead of humanitarian and other 
exchanges on the agenda. Seoul had insisted on the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's meeting was the seventh of a series since February, 1989. The talks 
had been suspended for five months. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most dialogue between the countries, Tuesday's was largely free of 
acrimony and tension. 
</P>
<P>
South Korea's chief delegate, Song Han Ho, later said he expects no problems in 
signing a procedural agreement for the summit. His northern counterpart, Paik 
Nam Jun, expressed similar views at a separate news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Song said he hopes the prime ministers' talks will open "a new chapter for 
realizing peaceful unification of the peninsula." 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot stick to the logic of the Cold War and ignore changes in the world 
any longer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Paik said Tuesday's accord "marked a new milestone in the history of the 
North-South Korea dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's agreement was widely seen as a major breakthrough in that dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
South Korean officials said arms reduction and other measures easing tensions 
could be discussed at the prime ministers' meeting as a first step toward 
eventual unification.

PEORIA WELCOMES ITS RANSOMED SON; 
</P>
<P>
ABDUCTION: THE CITY THAT RAISED FUNDS TO PAY COLOMBIAN GUERRILLAS GREETS HIM IN 
THE MATTER-OF-FACT WAY IT HELPED OBTAIN HIS RELEASE.

Independence Day came a bit early to Peoria this year. 
</P>
<P>
The city, which raised the funds to win the release of kidnaped Scott Heimdal, 
is welcoming him home, in the same neighborly but matter-of-fact way it went 
about helping win his freedom from Colombian guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
No parade. No big hero's welcome. Not a lot of self-congratulation for the way 
they came to the aid of this native son they hardly knew. 
</P>
<P>
A hundred or so balloon-carrying, sign-waving well-wishers met Heimdal at the 
airport upon his return to Peoria Monday night, and another hundred or so 
greeted him outside his parent's home. But on Tuesday folks hung back and let 
the Heimdals get reacquainted. 
</P>
<P>
"Just the family is going to celebrate," said Angie Heimdal, Scott's sister. 
"We're celebrating all week. Thursday is Scott's birthday." 
</P>
<P>
Scott Heimdal, 27, an engineer who worked for the IMINCO Gold Mining Co. in 
Ecuador, was kidnaped April 28 while traveling by canoe on business on a river 
near the Equadoran-Colombian border. After his arrival in Peoria Monday night 
he told with an almost casual air how the man piloting the canoe was killed in 
the ambush. A second passenger was abducted along with Heimdal but later was 
released with a ransom demand for Heimdal. 
</P>
<P>
His captors wanted $1.2 million for Heimdal's release. They later lowered the 
demand to $60,000. Peoria Mayor Jim Maloof asked every household in the 
metropolitan area -- there are nearly 60,000 of them -- to contribute at least 
a dollar, and the community quickly responded. 
</P>
<P>
Nursery home residents held bake sales, children collected money in jars, bar 
owners staged benefit dances, radio stations gave away concert tickets in 
exchange for donations to free Scott Heimdal. 
</P>
<P>
The money was raised in a matter of days. In the end, $108,000 was raised for 
Heimdal's release, according to some reports. After further negotiations -- the 
kidnapers at one point raised the ransom demand to $600,000 -- Heimdal was 
released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"There aren't any words to describe the happiness I feel," said Marge Heimdal, 
Scott's mother, upon her return to Peoria Monday night. She and her husband, 
Roy, flew to Ecuador two weeks ago to personally take charge of the 
negotiations to get their son released. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very glad my son is with me, but as I said before I left I wasn't coming 
home without him." 
</P>
<P>
Roy Heimdal remained in Ecuador to clear up banking business and to help secure 
a visa for Scott's Ecuadoran girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a powerful story," said Maloof. "It's a mother and dad who, when the 
State Department and government officials could not get involved to help, they 
took it upon themselves. They would not give up. They had great faith, great 
determination and great love." 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the family will host a "small reception" in a city park to show 
their appreciation to Peoria. Everyone in the city will be invited. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of an old fashioned way, a simple way, of saying thank you," said 
Jim Maloof, Peoria's mayor and a longtime friend of the Heimdals. "That is far 
more valuable, to me, than having a big parade and what have you." 
</P>
<P>
Heimdal said he was kidnaped simply because he is North American. 
</P>
<P>
"I was abducted by the EPL, which is a Colombian guerrilla group," he said. 
"The motive for kidnaping me was money to finance the war against the Colombian 
government. . . . They were looking to kidnap a North American." 
</P>
<P>
He said he talked his kidnapers, whom he said treated him with "great respect," 
into lowering their ransom demands. 
</P>
<P>
"I just told them they (his parents) don't have that kind of money," he told 
reporters. "Very few people in the United States have that kind of money. In 
Latin America they feel that being an American and being rich are the same 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
Heimdal's family is far from rich. They live in a rented frame house in a 
middle-class neighborhood. They moved there two years ago after the family had 
been forced to sell everything they owned to pay bills after they went into 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
"They just had problem after problem, yet they had the strength and courage to 
go on," said Maloof, who has known the family for 20 years. In the early 1980s, 
during an economic downturn in Peoria in which Roy Heimdal, then a real estate 
agent, lost his job, the family moved to Wisconsin. While there, Marge Heimdal 
was twice critically injured in car accidents, one by a drunk driver. Rising 
medical bills caused the family to go into debt. They returned to Peoria in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
When the family received the ransom demands from her son's kidnapers, Marge 
Heimdal went on television to ask for help. "Her appeal on television and in 
all the media was very dramatic: 'I want to save my son,' " said Maloof. "That 
triggered a whole lot of action. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"In 1975 we lost a 27-year-old son due to an illness," Maloof said. "The 
Heimdal family was as close to me or closer than my own family members during 
that time of trouble." 
</P>
<P>
He said he was overjoyed to see that kindness returned. "What a beautiful time 
to be the mayor of such a giving community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After Heimdal's release from captivity on Friday and before his return to 
Peoria, Heimdal's two sisters removed the yellow ribbons they had tied to the 
trees surrounding the family's house and replaced them with red, white and blue 
bunting. More than a dozen small American flags poked from the front lawn to 
greet Heimdal's return. A sign stretched across the front door said: "Welcome 
home Scott."

TAMPERING SCARE MEAT TO BE DESTROYED 
</P>

Despite finding no contamination, a Milwaukee sausage maker said Tuesday that 
it would destroy thousands of pounds of packaged meat recalled from groceries 
recently in a racially motivated product tampering scare. 
</P>
<P>
Fritz Usinger, president of the family-owned Usinger's sausage empire, said 
laboratory tests showed no evidence of the rat poison that a controversial 
black politician claimed might have been injected into the meat by a terrorist 
group. 
</P>
<P>
The warning, aired by City Council member Michael McGee, has aggravated racial 
tensions in Wisconsin's largest city, which is more than 25% black, deeply 
segregated and afflicted with serious unemployment and educational problems 
among minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Several prominent white politicians said the tampering threat was a hoax 
concocted by McGee to get publicity and whip up racial hatred. But black 
leaders rushed to McGee's defense, accusing his critics of ignoring social 
ills. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the City Council voted 11 to 3 to censure McGee for his 
involvement in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Tuesday, Usinger said his firm had pulled 41,000 packages 
of bratwurst, wieners, summer sausage and other meat links from Milwaukee area 
stores following McGee's disclosure of the alleged terrorist threat on June 22. 
</P>
<P>
According to McGee, he was tipped to the poisoning on the previous day during a 
phone call from a group he identified as the Militant African Underground 
Squared, or Mau-Mau. Authorities said they'd never heard of the group. 
</P>
<P>
Samples of the meats were sent to two independent testing labs, both of which 
found "no evidence to support the threat," Usinger said. Nevertheless, he said, 
much of the sausage had to be disposed of because it had exceeded its shelf 
life by the time the testing was done. 
</P>
<P>
The rest will be destroyed just to be safe, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Usinger's feels that while the tests are nearly conclusive, they can never be 
100% accurate unless each brat, wiener and sausage is tested," he added. 
"That's impractical." 
</P>
<P>
Usinger said the recall would cost the company "in excess of $135,000." A 
company spokesman said the firm is not insured for such a loss. 
</P>
<P>
McGee, who has previously threatened urban violence against whites, has been 
embroiled in a longstanding dispute with Usinger's and several other companies 
located on a six-block tourist strip in downtown Milwaukee known as Old World 
Milwaukee Street. 
</P>
<P>
McGee and other activists want the strip renamed after Dr. Martin Luther King 
Jr., but merchants claim the name change would be inconvenient and confusing to 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Usinger said Tuesday that he had not altered his opposition to the name change 
despite the poison scare.

SINGER SNOOKY LANSON; STARRED ON 'HIT PARADE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Snooky Lanson, the modest, genial star of television's version of "Your Hit 
Parade," once an institution on the American musical scene, died Monday night 
at a hospital in Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
The Tennessee native, who never lost his drawl or easy-going Dixie mannerisms, 
was 76 when he died of unreported causes. 
</P>
<P>
With Eileen Wilson and Dorothy Collins, Lanson brought the longtime radio 
standby to TV in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
It had been on the air since 1935, and over the years Lanson's singing 
counterparts included Buddy Clark, Lanny Ross and an underweight Italian 
baritone named Frank Sinatra. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the medium, the format remained the same through the show's 
35-year existence: The seven most popular songs of the week were performed. 
Their selection depended on sheet-music sales, juke box selections and requests 
to orchestra leaders around the country. 
</P>
<P>
Although the show's sponsor, Lucky Strike cigarettes, portrayed it as "an 
accurate, authentic tabulation of America's taste in popular music," the 
surveying techniques were far from scientific and the results closely guarded. 
</P>
<P>
Songs were played and sung in no particular order except for each week's No. 1, 
which was the finale. Also on each show were two or three "Lucky Strike 
extras," generally new renditions of standards. 
</P>
<P>
When a song stayed at the top of the charts week after week, settings had to be 
revised for the weekly performances. Lanson said he was particularly grateful 
when "Hound Dog" and "Shrimpboats" fell into disfavor. 
</P>
<P>
After Lanson and other regulars on the Saturday night show were dropped from 
the cast in 1957 to make room for a crop of singers more suited to rock 'n' 
roll, he sang in nightclubs and was host of TV variety shows in Atlanta and 
Shreveport, La. "Your Hit Parade" continued until 1959 and was revived briefly 
in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
"The show didn't have any stars per se and we all got along well," Lanson 
recalled in a 1979 interview with the Associated Press. "It was very clean and 
there was no suggestive dancing. A 5- or 6-year-old could watch it. And of 
course a lot of people watched it to see what song was No. 1 that week." 
</P>
<P>
Among the songs Lanson sang were "Ebb Tide," "He" and "Mr. Sandman." 
</P>
<P>
"I sang 'Mona Lisa' 13 straight weeks because it was a man's song and I was the 
only man on the show then," Lanson said. 
</P>
<P>
Lanson also said he was lucky to have been on the hit program where the cast 
would sign off singing: 
</P>
<P>
 So long for awhile. . . That's all the songs for awhile. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I have no illusions of grandeur," he said in 1979. "I know that 99% of the 
singers roaming the country then were better than me. 
</P>
<P>
"I know my time has come and gone. I had my time." 
</P>
<P>
Lanson had lived in Nashville since 1967 where he sang at tea dances and 
similar functions. He also had a syndicated radio show that played Big Band 
music and sold cars and outdoor advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Lanson first came to the attention of pop music audiences in 1941 after he 
recorded "By the Light of the Silvery Moon" with the Ray Noble band. A later 
hit, "The Old Master Painter," helped him land the "Hit Parade" job. 
</P>
<P>
He was born Roy Landman in Memphis and began singing in a church choir there as 
a boy. He was nicknamed "Snooky" at age 2 for the Irving Berlin tune, "Snookey 
Ookums," which his mother liked. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife, Florence; a daughter, two sons and eight 
grandchildren.

RESTAURANTS CALL FOR SMOKING BAN IN PUBLIC PLACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATT MORRISON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what it says is a significant change of heart and not a change in tactics, 
the California Restaurant Assn. declared Tuesday that it would support an 
outright, statewide smoking ban in restaurants -- but only if smoking is also 
banned in all other public places. 
</P>
<P>
The organization, representing owners of about 10,000 restaurants, said its 
decision is largely an acknowledgment of new data on the risks of secondhand 
smoke. Such a legislative ban could leapfrog local smoking regulations, like 
those in place in San Diego and many other California cities, as well as Los 
Angeles Councilman Marvin Braude's proposal to ban restaurant smoking 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in the smoking section of a downtown restaurant, 
association officials disclosed that they are drafting legislation that would 
enact the smoking ban. They said it would be "premature" to define a public 
place, although a representative in Sacramento said it would include such spots 
as bowling alleys, sports arenas and theaters. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than point a finger to the workplace or to other environments where 
secondhand smoke far exceeds that in restaurants," said incoming association 
President Ted Burke, "the restaurant industry . . . encourages a total ban on 
smoking in each and every public place in California, without exception or 
exclusion." 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant association is one of the most influential lobbies in 
Sacramento, its members representing everything from food contractors to haute 
cuisine. It has battled smoking regulations at all levels, urging voluntary 
changes on its members, many of whom have found nonsmoking sections to be 
profitable. 
</P>
<P>
The California-based Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights lauded the "breakthrough" 
turnabout in the position of the restaurant owners, but in the next breath said 
it was doomed by the cigarette industry's leverage in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased the restaurant association now recognizes that secondhand 
smoke is a public health problem," said Julia Carol, associate director of the 
anti-smoking group. She predicted that a total ban would not come about because 
the Legislature is "in the hip pocket" of tobacco interests. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego County, officials said they want the cities to beef up their 
current anti-smoking laws. But so far they say no city has matched the county's 
ordinance for unincorporated areas that requires at least 50 percent of the 
seating to be reserved for nonsmokers in restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone else has vague language," said Jane Young, chief of public health 
education for San Diego County. Young said that she knows of no city ordinance 
in San Diego County that has designated a percentage of seats for nonsmokers in 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego requires restaurants that seat more than 20 people to set aside a 
sufficient number of nonsmoking seats to meet demand. Del Mar has a similar 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
The county ordinance also bans smoking in all county buildings in 
unincorporated areas and says that employers must ban smoking in all shared 
work areas. The less stringent San Diego city ordinance says that smoking and 
nonsmoking workers must be separated. But with wording like this it means that 
smokers could be on one side of a room and nonsmokers on the other side, Young 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Jo Thompson, the restaurant association's senior director of government 
affairs and general counsel, said she has finished the first draft of the bill, 
which could not be introduced in the Legislature before January. Beyond 
prohibiting smoking in eating and drinking places, the proposal would ban 
smoking in "every public place, including bowling alleys, sports arenas, 
theaters," she said. It would not apply, for instance, to an employee cafeteria 
at a privately owned plant, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are fairly certain that our proposal is going to get a lot of pummeling. We 
have been pummeled before. We'll just have to take what comes," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the association is looking for a legislator who will carry the bill. 
It is certain to draw the attention of a large number of legislative combatants 
ranging from local governments to the tobacco lobby, health and medical 
interests, and restaurant and bar owners. 
</P>
<P>
Braude and the nonsmoking group are concerned that the legislation might pose a 
risk to smoking regulations already in place. One fear is that the legislation 
would be so sweeping in defining "public" that the Legislature would back away 
from it. Alternatively, they worry that any watered down compromise would 
impose less than rigorous standards statewide, possibly cutting off at the 
knees more stringent local measures. 
</P>
<P>
Legislation that would enact a smoking ban "is not going to hurt us at all," 
said Carol, of the anti-smoking group. "The only thing that would hurt us is a 
state law with preemption (of more rigorous local standards) in it, and we'd 
fight that tooth and nail, and it wouldn't pass." 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant association's executive vice president, Stan Kyker, dismissed 
local restrictions as "piecemeal" and confusing. "If secondhand smoke is a 
health hazard, then it is a health hazard for employees as well as customers, 
and it is a health hazard in all types of establishments in all parts of the 
states," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Association officials said the about-face, which came on a 90-0 vote at the 
June meeting of its board of directors, was not a direct response to Braude's 
May 29 proposal for a total restaurant smoking ban, the toughest in any major 
U.S. city. 
</P>
<P>
It is a reaction "only to the degree that Los Angeles becomes part of that 
patchwork quilt (of regulations) that is beginning to develop all over the 
state," said Kyker. "To say that it had absolutely nothing to do with it would 
be shortsighted, but to say that it is a response to it is also clearly too 
simplistic." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the country, local government agencies have sometimes been more 
vigorous in legislating matters from gun control to fireworks and smoking 
issues. In part, it is because lobbying money and special-interest leverage are 
often more effectively employed at the state level. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant association opposed piecemeal legislation as creating unfair 
competition between restaurants in neighboring cities. Kyker said it also would 
be against any state legislation banning smoking in restaurants alone, without 
including other public places. 
</P>
<P>
"Our board believes it is not a rights, moral or ethical issue," Thompson said. 
"It is simply a health issue. We feel beyond a reasonable doubt that secondhand 
smoke is a real health problem, especially for employees." 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, and up until this year, we have understood the smoking 
controversy to be a rights or moral issue that we felt we didn't have any 
business making any judgments about," she said. "Our board was not pro- or 
anti-smoking. They just wanted to accommodate those who wanted to eat at the 
restaurant or drink at the bar. They wanted people to be happy." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said the reversal also came in the wake of passage of the anti-toxics 
Proposition 65 in 1986, which, among other things, required the posting of 
signs where food is served warning of the hazards to health of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
"Our board looked at that and they felt this was the beginning of their 
acknowledgment that maybe there is something to the scientific studies that 
secondhand smoke is dangerous," she said.

HOLDOUT JUROR DOUBTED INTENT OF SILBERMAN 
</P>

<P>
The sole juror who held out for acquittal on the central charges in Richard T. 
Silberman's money-laundering trial said Tuesday that he simply did not believe 
the San Diego financier had the intent to launder drug money. 
</P>
<P>
In his first published comments since the complex case concluded last week with 
Silberman's conviction on one count, juror Mark E. Powers, 38, a San Diego 
machinist, said he stuck to his decision even after it was apparent he had 
deadlocked the jury on several other charges. 
</P>
<P>
Other jurors "weren't dealing with the law" but wanted desperately to convict 
Silberman, a one-time governor's aide, and were ready to ignore jury 
instructions to do it, Powers said. "They were dealing with their moral 
indignation with what had happened," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But, Powers said, "the law is emotionless." And, he added, "I do not do things 
illogically." 
</P>
<P>
He said he was not convinced that Silberman had the necessary intent to launder 
cash at any time before he was approached in 1988 by an undercover FBI agent 
posing as a front man for Colombian drug lords. 
</P>
<P>
If only a tape recorder that agent Peter Ahearn wore to his first meeting with 
Silberman had worked, "that would have clinched it," Powers said. 
</P>
<P>
Powers also disclosed that he was convicted about 20 years ago for possession 
of a controlled substance and received four years' probation. He said the 
lawyers in the case knew about his record but left him in the jury pool. 
</P>
<P>
"There were like 30 or 40 people around, and I was the one that got nailed" for 
possessing an amphetamine, Powers said. He said he made a plea bargain but 
declined to provide other details. 
</P>
<P>
Powers said the 2-month-long trial, as well as having to discuss his own 
conviction, have already caused him grief. 
</P>
<P>
"You've read the papers: I'm the holdout," he said. "There's no way I was the 
holdout. I was just trying to do my job the way the judge told me to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, 61, who once served as a top aide to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown 
Jr., was convicted last Thursday of one count in the complex case. He was found 
guilty of violating a federal currency law and was sent immediately to jail 
without bail by U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the jury announced it was deadlocked on the remaining counts. Irving 
declared a mistrial, but sent Silberman back to jail to await formal sentencing 
Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, who is married to San Diego County Supervisor Susan Golding, could 
draw as much as 10 years in federal prison, but new sentencing guidelines 
suggest that a term of one to five years is likely. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder has already announced that he intends to 
retry Silberman on the unresolved charges. Lead defense lawyer James J. 
Brosnahan has said he will appeal the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman was arrested in April, 1989, in a San Diego hotel room. By then, 
prosecutors contend, he already had made two money-laundering deals, using cash 
supplied by undercover FBI agent Ahearn, and was negotiating with Ahearn for a 
third. 
</P>
<P>
The first deal was a November, 1988, exchange of $100,000 for stock in a 
Silberman gold-mining company. The second was a February, 1989, swap of 
$200,000 for untraceable U.S. Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The jury deadlocked, 11 to 1 for conviction, on the three central counts in the 
case: two counts of money laundering and a single count of conspiring to 
launder cash. Powers left the federal courthouse after jurors were dismissed 
last Friday without talking to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
But he said Tuesday that the law required the jury to find not only that 
Silberman believed that the cash Ahearn supplied was from unlawful funds but 
also, specifically, that it was drug money, Powers said. 
</P>
<P>
Powers said all the jurors agreed that Silberman believed the cash was tainted. 
But, he said, "It was very unclear in the very beginning of the investigation 
whether Silberman actually knew it was drug money." 
</P>
<P>
When Ahearn met Silberman on Nov. 9, 1988, the financier had committed no 
crimes, Powers said. Without clear proof that Silberman knew from the very 
start that Ahearn's money purportedly came from Colombian drug proceeds, the 
government had not proved, as it had to do, that Silberman had not been 
entrapped, Powers said. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman asserted as a defense that he was entrapped -- that is, that he was 
induced into crimes, if they occurred, by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
Ahearn testified that, at the Nov. 9 meeting, he made it clear that his money 
came from Colombian drug trafficking. Silberman testified that Ahearn led him 
to believe that the money was from Mexican investors who sought confidentiality 
in their financial dealings. 
</P>
<P>
"Your word against my word," Powers said. "You need more than that to me for 
proof beyond a reasonable doubt." 
</P>
<P>
Ahearn also testified that he hid a tape recorder in his left sock for the Nov. 
9 meeting but that the recorder malfunctioned. And Powers said he found 
Ahearn's credibility lacking because the agent was a "mysterious, evasive 
person." 
</P>
<P>
Powers also said that, only after Ahearn and Silberman met Feb. 7, 1989, and 
the agent explicitly said that the cash came from a "bunch of . . . Colombian 
drug lords," was it clear that Silberman had to have understood that the funds 
supposedly were drug money. 
</P>
<P>
"So they had him," Powers said. "What's he going to do? Go to the cops?" 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Powers said, what Silberman knew at that point was not relevant 
to proving he had the intent to launder cash even before he met Ahearn. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe he was, maybe he wasn't intending to do something," but even if he was, 
that was not proof beyond a reasonable doubt, Powers said. 
</P>
<P>
Powers said his views caused "some pretty strong sentiment" in the jury room. 
</P>
<P>
"People were telling me over and over again, 'Don't pay any attention to that, 
" he said, referring to the instruction that the cash had to be drug money. 
"But, I said, 'Why did they put it here if they didn't want us to read it?' " 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Powers said, jury foreman John T. Uliasz, 38, a Santee nurse, 
told him: " 'Mark, we are the law. We interpret the law.' I got real upset 
about that. That's the judge's responsibility. The law is the law. That's the 
only thing that's black and white in this case, and that's the law. 
</P>
<P>
"I blew up a couple times," Powers said. "How would you feel about it if you 
were told, 'Don't read that'? You're talking about trying to find out. The 
foreman says, 'I don't want to look stupid to people by asking questions.' I 
got no problem asking questions." 
</P>
<P>
Testimony from Jack Norman Myers, a longtime associate of Silberman's who said 
he knew throughout that the two deals were illegal, proved that Silberman had 
the necessary intent all along to evade the requirement of reporting all cash 
transactions of more than $10,000, Powers said. That led to the sole 
conviction, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Myers was the case," he said. "If they didn't have Myers, they wouldn't have 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
He said he had no particular feelings about Gorder's decision to retry 
Silberman. "That's a very difficult question for me to answer," he said, 
"because I have a much dimmer view of the ability of people to separate their 
emotions from the law."

HIGH DESERT ARSON SPREE RAISES FEARS; 
</P>
<P>
FIRES: INVESTIGATORS HAVE BEEN FRUSTRATED BY A SERIES OF BLAZES NEAR LANCASTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

An arsonist started a brush fire in the Antelope Valley hills on Tuesday, the 
latest in a weeklong spree of a dozen arson fires that has frustrated 
investigators and raised fears among residents in Los Angeles County's 
fast-growing high desert region. 
</P>
<P>
As in the previous fires, no homes were damaged or threatened Tuesday in the 
fast-moving blaze. But authorities said the toll could have been extensive if 
strong winds had not blown the fire east, away from the mountain communities of 
Lake Elizabeth and Leona Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"If it had gone west toward the Leona Valley area we could have had some 
serious problems," said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Dan Watters, a 
member of the sheriff's arson unit. 
</P>
<P>
The fires generally have been confined to 10 square miles near Leona Valley and 
neighboring semirural communities west of Lancaster. They have come in 
clusters: two Monday night, four last Friday afternoon and another five last 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
At least nine of the fires, the largest of which consumed 170 acres, appear to 
be the work of the same arsonist, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
In each of the fires, they said, the arsonist or arsonists have made stops on 
country roads, possibly while commuting between Lancaster and the Leona Valley, 
to ignite brush on the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze Tuesday began about 10:30 a.m. when a motorist pulled over on a 
barren stretch of road about 10 miles west of Lancaster, set a fire and sped 
away, officials said. Strong desert winds spread the flames through extremely 
dry brush, charring 70 acres before county firefighters could extinguish them. 
</P>
<P>
The fires have been set in what is one of the hottest, driest and windiest 
portions of the county. About 10,000 people live in the Leona Valley and 
neighboring communities, and even in normal times brush fires are a major 
source of concern. The arson fires have heightened those fears, especially 
since they followed arson fires that claimed more than 500 houses in other 
parts of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very, very scary situation," said community activist Gloria Gossard, 
who lives on a Leona Valley ranch. "There's not a resident of Leona Valley who 
is not casting an eye skyward." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies have stepped up patrols for suspicious activity, and county 
firefighters have added extra manpower, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A Castaic man, 28-year-old David Wayne Cunningham, was arrested last Thursday 
in connection with three small fires that were set within a two-hour period. He 
initially reported two of those fires and claimed to have stomped them out. 
</P>
<P>
He posted $10,000 bail that evening and will be arraigned later this month on 
arson charges. 
</P>
<P>
Although Cunningham was still in custody when two more blazes were set, Watters 
said he has not ruled out the man as a suspect in subsequent fires. 
</P>
<P>
Watters also asked for public assistance in finding a woman and two children 
who were seen near the latest arson fire Tuesday and might have witnessed it 
being set. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators and residents suspect that the arson wave might have been 
inspired by major fires last week in Santa Barbara and Glendale.

EXPERTS BAFFLED BY CAVE-IN;

<P>
SAFETY: ROOF COLLAPSE AT LONG BEACH SPARKS STATEWIDE CHECK OF CAMPUS BUILDINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
State officials on Tuesday shut down all eight buildings in the Cal State Long 
Beach music complex where a 120-ton roof collapsed on a concert hall Monday and 
launched a survey of 19 other state campuses to determine how many similarly 
built structures exist. 
</P>
<P>
A team of independent experts searched Tuesday in a mountain of debris inside 
the Gerald R. Daniel Recital Hall for an explanation to the collapse. They said 
it could be several weeks before the cause is known. 
</P>
<P>
The chancellor's office that oversees the state university system remained 
baffled by the cause and was investigating whether some of the system's 1,200 
other buildings might pose a danger. Officials said they had received calls 
from campuses around the state seeking reassurance that their buildings were 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
"You just have to be real careful with buildings that house so many students," 
said Colleen Bentley-Adler, spokeswoman for the Cal State system. "(But) we 
have no reports of any problems." 
</P>
<P>
Tons of concrete and steel thundered onto the empty 210-seat hall where a group 
of high school students were to have rehearsed just hours before. They were 
told to leave when faculty members and campus police noticed half-inch cracks 
and falling plaster. 
</P>
<P>
The music department complex at the north end of the campus was cordoned off 
and locked until the walls of the concert hall, buckled and bent, could be 
secured, allowing experts to get inside and analyze the rubble for a clue to 
what caused the accident, campus President Curtis McCray said. 
</P>
<P>
A team of independent structural engineers and contractors was hired by the 
state to join the original Long Beach architectural firm of Hugh Gibbs &amp; 
Donald Gibbs and the Pasadena contracting firm of Shirley Bros. Inc. in 
investigating the collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Contractor James V. Shirley was at a loss to explain what failed as he surveyed 
the auditorium now filled with heaps of metal and steel. "I honestly don't know 
until I look," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Campus officials were particularly worried about the structural integrity of 
two adjacent buildings constructed in the same "tilt-up" style as the hall, 
where the concrete walls are poured then hoisted into standing position. 
</P>
<P>
"They look reasonably solid, but we just have not had that many problems with 
buildings" McCray said after touring the complex for more than an hour. "The 
reason we're being so damn careful with this is we want to make sure we know 
what we're talking about." 
</P>
<P>
State university officials said they had "no idea" how many of the system's 
buildings statewide were constructed in the tilt-up style. Until they know 
whether the cave-in was the result of a freak accident or a more generic 
structural flaw, they could not say whether the problem was widespread. 
</P>
<P>
The chancellor's office was also compiling a list of buildings designed by 
Gibbs &amp; Gibbs and built by Shirley Bros. 
</P>
<P>
The hall was last inspected Jan. 13 by campus staff, who reported that the roof 
leaked when it rained but cited no structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
The last known structural inspection of the building was during construction in 
1982, and state guidelines require no further structural inspection, 
Bentley-Adler said. 
</P>
<P>
At least two seismic surveys were made after earthquakes in 1987 and 1989, but 
no problems were reported, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Some Long Beach faculty members said in interviews that they had been concerned 
that the complex -- constructed at a cost of $6.3 million in 1982 -- was built 
"on the cheap." 
</P>
<P>
"One of our professors predicted the roof would cave in one day," said Martin 
Herman, assistant professor of music who was in a nearby building just yards 
away from the recital hall when it collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Herman said he was on his way to his office at 10:20 a.m. when he heard three 
"violent" cracks. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I thought it was an earthquake," he said. "Everything around me shook 
violently for a split second. It honestly never occurred to me that the roof 
had caved in." 
</P>
<P>
Faculty members said they were annoyed by the leaks that dribbled through the 
roof even in the slightest rain, damaging musical equipment on several 
occasions.

POLLUTION CITED FOR SWIM BAN AT BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time on a Santa Monica Bay beach, swimming has been banned within 
100 yards of where a major storm drain enters the ocean because testing found 
the water polluted with sewage containing human viruses. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Santa Monica's decision to prohibit swimming on a popular stretch 
of beach near the Pico-Kenter storm drain followed disclosure last week of an 
unprecedented study that found the presence of human enteric viruses. 
</P>
<P>
The viruses, which can cause illness ranging from stomach flu to hepatitis, 
were detected in samples taken on 11 days over 15 days of testing last summer 
where the drain enters the bay at the foot of Pico Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Although Los Angeles County health officials played down the potential health 
risk and considered possible changes in the wording of warning signs, Santa 
Monica took action. The city posted its own large black-and-white signs in 
English and Spanish along the beach 100 yards north and south of the drain's 
entry point. 
</P>
<P>
"Swimming within 100 yards of the storm drain outlet is prohibited," the signs 
read. "Storm drain waters may be contaminated with human disease carrying 
bacteria or virus or hazardous chemicals washed down from urban areas." 
</P>
<P>
Buoys were placed offshore to designate the area where swimming is banned. 
</P>
<P>
Parts of the bay have been off-limits to swimming when storms have caused 
Pico-Kenter and other drains to flood. But this is first ban not connected to a 
storm or sewage spill, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was appropriate to be conservative with respect to public health," Santa 
Monica Mayor Dennis Zane said. "We are very concerned there are additional 
forms of contamination at the storm drain that heretofore had not been 
acknowledged." 
</P>
<P>
The stark warning signs have had an immediate impact since they were erected 
last week. On the eve of the busy July 4th holiday, the often-crowded stretch 
of beach was mostly empty. 
</P>
<P>
To underscore its belief that the public should not swim near the drain, the 
environmental group Heal the Bay plans to hold a rally at the site this morning 
at 11. 
</P>
<P>
Heal the Bay's staff scientist Mark Gold, who was the principal investigator on 
the study, praised Santa Monica officials for acting swiftly to ban swimming. 
"What they did was extremely responsible," Gold said. "There is no way you can 
go to the beach there and not know that there is a problem." 
</P>
<P>
The $125,000 study conducted by the Santa Monica Bay Restoration Project was 
the first of its kind in California and possibly the nation, director Catherine 
Tyrrell said. 
</P>
<P>
Samples taken last August and September from the drain, which carries street 
runoff from Brentwood and Santa Monica, were tested for human enteric viruses. 
</P>
<P>
Tyrrell said the results showed evidence of viruses from human fecal 
contamination in the storm drain. The report speculated that the most likely 
sources of the waste are illegal sewage connections to the storm drain, leaking 
sewer lines or the local homeless population. Members of the federal and 
state-funded project agreed that the information should be made available to 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
With holiday crowds expected, Santa Monica City Manager John Jalili decided 
that swimming should be banned in the immediate area near the drain. "We felt 
that it was a prudent thing to do until more information becomes available," 
Jalili said. 
</P>
<P>
The findings have sparked concern in Santa Monica's tourist industry. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Moore, executive director of the city's Convention and Visitors Bureau, 
concurred that the public should not swim within 100 yards of a storm drain or 
two days after a storm. 
</P>
<P>
But with the summer tourist season in full swing, Moore took pains to point out 
that "the bay is swimmable and our beaches are safe. . . . We want to make sure 
that the public knows the areas that are safe to swim in and the areas that are 
not safe to swim in," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The distinction is important because Santa Monica draws 2.5 million visitors a 
year and tourism contributes substantially to the city's economy. The affected 
area of the beach is immediately in front of the construction site of the Park 
Hyatt Hotel, which is scheduled to open late this year. 
</P>
<P>
County officials expressed surprise at Santa Monica's decision. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Petralia, director of the Health Services Department's Bureau of 
Environmental Protection, said he could not remember swimming ever being banned 
near a storm drain. 
</P>
<P>
Petralia and other county officials downplayed the health risk of swimming near 
the drain's discharge point. "There is no indication that there is any great 
risk being in that water," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that a full epidemiological study needs to be conducted.

SLUM SUIT SETTLED FOR $2.4 MILLION;

<P>
Attorneys representing 65 families announced Tuesday a $2.4-million settlement 
of a lawsuit filed by tenants over slum conditions in a downtown Los Angeles 
apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
The out-of-court settlement involving a building at 106 E. Washington Blvd. was 
described by attorneys as the second largest of its kind in Los Angeles 
history. 
</P>
<P>
"The building was maintained in poor condition for a number of years," said 
Mercedes Marquez, who represented the tenants. 
</P>
<P>
For this reason, she said, the suit was filed against three different sets of 
owners who held the property over the past decade: Edward Rubin, a Los Angeles 
doctor; Rand Financial Corp. together with Descartes Financial Corp., and 
Washington Management Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The building was demolished in 1988 and has been replaced by a mini-mall. 
</P>
<P>
During a news conference at the St. Francis Center, Marquez described a rat and 
roach-infested building where the plumbing did not work and ceilings had 
collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the former tenants are Latinos who do minimum-wage work for the 
garment, restaurant and jewelry industries downtown, she said. About half of 
the tenants were children. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve-year-old Laura Cruz recalled that her family moved to the old brick 
structure when she was 7. She lived on the third floor with two brothers, a 
sister and her parents, who were garment workers. 
</P>
<P>
When she got home from school, she said, she stayed in the cramped apartment 
and never ventured out because gang members controlled the hallways. "Gangs 
didn't live in the building," she said. "They hung out there and terrorized 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Margarita Chavez, who lived in the building 12 years and paid $260 a month for 
an apartment, said her two children suffered skin infections from cockroach 
bites. 
</P>
<P>
Sister Kathy Wood of the St. Francis Center said she got involved in the case 
after several tenants became so desperate that they tried to fix up their 
apartments themselves. 
</P>
<P>
For many years, Wood has organized tenants in several buildings in the 
garment-district area. 
</P>
<P>
Wood said it was raining the first night she went to a tenant meeting at 106 E. 
Washington. "I watched water pour down the light fixture in the ceiling and 
children playing in the puddle on the floor underneath," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Wood said she was unsuccessful in getting local health and building inspectors 
to respond to tenant complaints, so she contacted Litt &amp; Stormer, the 
public-interest firm for which Marquez works. The lawsuit, filed in 1987, 
alleged that the building was uninhabitable and that the landlords were 
negligent in making repairs and intentionally inflicted emotional distress on 
the tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Paul Cohen, who represents Rand Financial Corp. and Descartes 
Financial Corp., both Los Angeles real estate investment firms, said his 
clients settled because, "The costs of litigation of this kind are 
prohibitive." 
</P>
<P>
"The settlement will provide that no party admits any liability," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The other former owners could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Marquez said that the tenant families will receive an average of about $37,000 
each. Attorney Barry Litt said that Litt &amp; Stormer will receive between 10% 
and 40% of the payments. 
</P>
<P>
The record for such a suit, Litt said, is a $2.5-million out-of-court 
settlement in a 1988 suit by 70 families against landlord Milton Avol.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RAPE-SLAYING OF WOMAN DRAWS DEATH SENTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Alan Bradford was sentenced Tuesday to die in the gas chamber for raping, 
strangling and stabbing to death the manager of his Panorama City apartment 
building in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"The circumstances of this crime are appalling," Van Nuys Superior Court Judge 
Michael J. Farrell said before sentencing Bradford, who was convicted in May of 
murdering Lynea Kokes, 28, on April 18, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Bradford, 27, a convalescent home cook, confessed to Los Angeles police that he 
choked, raped and sodomized Kokes after helping her move into the apartment 
building. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he went home and then showered before deciding to come back and 
kill Kokes with a kitchen knife in order to prevent her from reporting the 
crime.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: IRWINDALE TO PAY FORMER CONSULTANT $1.28 
MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Irwindale City Council has agreed to pay former redevelopment consultant 
Fred Lyte $1.28 million to end a lengthy legal battle stemming from his firing 
in December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Lyte was let go when city officials decided that his contract, which gave Lyte 
3% of the building permit fees garnered from the city's redevelopment zone, was 
too generous. 
</P>
<P>
The city later sued Lyte for $2 million, claiming he had violated his contract 
by recommending projects in which he had a financial interest. 
</P>
<P>
Lyte denied that and countersued for $1.4 million in back pay. The decision to 
settle out of court was, according to city council members, an attempt to save 
legal fees, for which the city already had spent $500,000, not an admission of 
guilt. 
</P>
<P>
Lyte said that he was pleased and added: "They paid me what they owed me."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN CONVICTED OF MURDER AND GANG MEMBER 
COUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 23-year-old Pacoima man was found guilty Tuesday in San Fernando Superior 
Court of first-degree murder and also of membership in a gang, the first 
conviction by a Los Angeles County jury under a state law that went into effect 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Manuel Madrigal faces a maximum sentence of 26 years to life for his role in 
the death of 16-year-old Jimmie Torrez, who was beaten and shot to death by 
alleged gang members in San Fernando last August. 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing is set for July 23. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist Atty. Edward Nison hailed the conviction as a landmark in anti-gang 
prosecution, although he described the law's impact in the Madrigal case as 
minimal because by law, Madrigal will be required to serve a longer term than 
15 years, the longest term the gang membership provision could ensure. "In this 
case the practical affect isn't significant," Nison said, 
</P>
<P>
Madrigal's attorney, Mel Brown, said his client will appeal the conviction.

JURORS WILL DECIDE CASE AGAINST BUCKEY AFTER 3-MONTH TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS TIMNICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fate of McMartin Pre-School defendant Ray Buckey was turned over to the 
jury Tuesday after attorneys for both sides wound up emotional final arguments. 
</P>
<P>
The five-man, seven-woman panel paid close attention as the lawyers sought 
during the three-month trial's final hours to convince them of the nursery 
school teacher's guilt or innocence on eight counts of molestation involving 
three girls. 
</P>
<P>
"Stick it to the people (the district attorney's office) if they didn't do 
their job," urged defense lawyer Danny Davis, referring to what he called a 
botched investigation and a parade of unreliable witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
He asked jurors to separate "raw emotionality" from "real evidence." 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Dist. Atty. Joe Martinez implored them to look at all the evidence 
against the 32-year-old Buckey. 
</P>
<P>
"These children were molested," he said. "These children have felt injustice 
for so long that they've come to you for help. Ray Buckey did this thing to 
them. Don't reject them." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg excused the jury until 
Monday, when he will instruct them on the law and send them into the jury room 
to begin deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
"Avoid the temptation you might feel to start discussing or deciding it now," 
he told them. "It would be premature to do that." 
</P>
<P>
The final day of the trial was peppered with allusions to McCarthyism, Vietnam, 
Charles Dickens and Walt Disney. 
</P>
<P>
Quoting from Dickens' "Great Expectations," Martinez compared the plight of the 
alleged child victims at McMartin to the 19th-Century characters: "In the 
little world in which children have their existence, there is nothing so finely 
perceived or finely felt as injustice." He said the children should be 
believed, despite inconsistencies he said resulted from their attempts to 
forget the traumatic incidents. 
</P>
<P>
"If they fantasize, they fantasize within their experience," he said, asking 
how they could have made up the graphic details of their alleged sexual abuse 
without any frame of reference except Buckey. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez dismissed Buckey's supposed interest in early childhood education, 
saying he dropped out of school and exhibited behavior inappropriate for a 
teacher: 
</P>
<P>
"In no way was he serious about becoming a preschool teacher," the prosecutor 
said. Rather, he said, "the predator is always close to the prey." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors had the final word Tuesday because the burden of proving that 
Buckey is guilty lies with them. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, however, Davis said the children who testified against his 
client should not be believed, both because their accounts were contaminated by 
years of interviews and discussions and because those accounts changed over 
time. 
</P>
<P>
He pointed to what he called one girl's disregard for the truth, quoting her 
answer to questions about inconsistencies between her testimony at each trial: 
"That was then; this is now." 
</P>
<P>
It is possible, he said, that children today alleging that Buckey molested them 
will deny it in the future, just as some who earlier accused all seven original 
defendants later said they were molested by Buckey and his mother, and still 
later, said that only Buckey abused them. 
</P>
<P>
"Are we going to wait 20 years and look back and say, 'What we did to Ray 
Buckey was wrong?' " Davis asked.

NO NEW LEADS IN GLENDALE FIRE; REWARD FOR ARSONIST IS $75,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN O'SHAUGHNESSY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to offer 
a $25,000 reward for the arrest and conviction of the arsonist who set last 
week's Glendale blaze that destroyed 46 homes and damaged 20 others. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the arsonist a "maniac," Supervisor Mike Antonovich, a Glendale 
resident, urged citizens who might have leads in the case to call authorities. 
With the supervisors' action, the reward now totals $75,000. Gov. George 
Deukmejian pledged up to $50,000 last week. 
</P>
<P>
But fire officials said Tuesday they are no closer to solving the crime. The 
investigation still centers on a blue Honda with two occupants seen by 
witnesses in the area where the fire started, said Glendale Fire Capt. John 
Orr. 
</P>
<P>
Orr, who heads a six-member team investigating Wednesday's fire, which caused 
an estimated $50 million damage, said he had received 87 phone tips by Tuesday 
afternoon, but "nothing you could term hot." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Glendale fire victims began seeking help Tuesday morning at a relief 
center established at the Glendale Civic Auditorium. Residents applied for 
state and federal loans and grants to replace property not covered by 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
By midafternoon, 25 families had visited the center. Art and Thordis Rasmuson, 
who lost everything when their Ridge Drive home was destroyed, were among the 
first visitors. 
</P>
<P>
The couple already had met with an insurance adjuster, but were uncertain 
whether their insurance would cover all losses. 
</P>
<P>
"We are just here to be walked through this," Thordis Rasmuson said. "How do we 
start rebuilding? What is the first step? In all honesty, the first question 
was, 'What do we wear after today?' " 
</P>
<P>
Art Rasmuson said he did not know how relief workers could put a monetary 
figure on some of the couple's lost possessions, such as his grandfather's 
roll-top desk. 
</P>
<P>
"What is the value of heirlooms?" he asked. "What is the value of the pictures 
of our kids growing up?" 
</P>
<P>
The center, which is being staffed by federal, state and local officials, 
tentatively will remain open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m today and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to prevent another tragic fire, Glendale City Councilman Carl 
Raggio, whose son's home was destroyed in the hillside blaze, said he plans to 
ask the city manager to prepare a report on the feasibility of banning wood 
shingle roofs on existing homes. 
</P>
<P>
A divided Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday refused to support 
a ban on new wood roofs, despite claims that such a ban could have dramatically 
reduced losses in the recent Southern California fires. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Los Angeles and Glendale city councils adopted ordinances that 
prohibit shake roofs on new homes or as replacement roofs. But city and 
industry officials said they were unaware of any communities that have tried to 
force homeowners to replace existing roofs. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Larry Zarian said he is concerned about whether the city should impose 
such a large financial burden on homeowners. A new roof often costs at least 
$10,000, industry representatives said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for wood shake roof manufacturers and dealers also questioned 
whether Glendale could legally require the replacement of existing roofs.

SUPERVISORS REFUSE TO URGE BAN ON WOOD ROOFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A divided Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday refused to support 
a ban on new wood roofs, despite claims that such a ban could have dramatically 
reduced losses from recent Southern California fires. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-2 vote was strictly along ideological lines, with the board's 
conservative majority opposing liberal Supervisor Kenneth Hahn's call for state 
legislation banning new wood roofs throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn has proposed a ban after every major fire for more than a quarter of a 
century. Each time he has been rebuffed by his colleagues who side with the 
roof industry in contending that wood roofs treated with a fire retardant 
provide adequate protection. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Hahn cited recent fires in Glendale, Santa Barbara and Chino Hills 
that destroyed more than 500 homes -- most with wood roofs. 
</P>
<P>
"If you watch television, you could see the embers go from one wood shake roof 
to another," Hahn said. "How many fire tragedies must occur before we take 
steps to ban these dangerous roofs?" 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Barbara County, where 435 homes were destroyed, officials plan to 
recommend that their Board of Supervisors outlaw all new wood or replacement 
wood roofs, building official Frank Breckenridge said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In Glendale, where the City Council banned all new wood roofs a year ago, the 
majority of the 66 homes damaged or destroyed in last week's fire had wood 
roofs, Glendale Fire Marshal Chris Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn argued that a statewide ban would save the county money. "Look at all the 
fire trucks we had to send" to help fight the Glendale and Santa Barbara fires, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
But conservative Supervisor Mike Antonovich said that the type of roof 
installed on homes is an issue of "freedom of choice" best left to property 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich, who lives in Glendale but outside the fire zone, pointed out that 
during the recent fires, some homes with slate and tile roofs were destroyed, 
while others with wood roofs survived. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Deane Dana said he replaced the wood roof on his Palos Verdes home 
with a fire-resistant one because "I live in an area where there is a possible 
danger." But he said he opposes a statewide ban as unnecessary and too costly 
for homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Pete Schabarum also voted against Hahn's proposal, while Supervisor 
Ed Edelman supported it. 
</P>
<P>
A ban on new wood roofs in the city of Los Angeles, approved last year by the 
mayor and City Council, is being challenged in court by the wood roof industry. 
Wood roofs are also banned in fire-prone Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, supervisors extended to all unincorporated areas under their 
jurisdiction a requirement that new and replacement wood roofs be treated with 
a fire retardant. 
</P>
<P>
State legislation banning wood roofs has been introduced in recent years, but 
has always been defeated amid heavy lobbying from the wood roof industry. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles) is now sponsoring a bill that would reinforce 
the authority of local government to adopt tougher roofing restrictions than 
the state, an aide said. 
</P>
<P>
Industry officials estimate that about 30% of all homes in Los Angeles have 
wood roofs, and fire officials have long blamed them for boosting the damage 
toll of periodic brush fires. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Westfall, president of the Cedar Shake and Shingle Bureau in Bellevue, 
Wash., accused Hahn of a "knee-jerk reaction." Westfall said his trade 
organization has sent teams to Southern California to assess the damage from 
the fires and found that some homes with tile roofs were destroyed, while 
neighborhood homes with wood roofs suffered no damage. 
</P>
<P>
Breckenridge of Santa Barbara County said that homes without wood roofs had a 
"significantly" better survival rate in the recent fire than those with wood 
roofs.

CHARGES FILED IN GRAD NIGHT ACCIDENT; 
</P>
<P>
DRUNK DRIVING: A 20-YEAR-OLD MAN IS ACCUSED OF MANSLAUGHTER IN A CRASH THAT 
KILLED A PASSENGER WHO HAD JUST RECEIVED HIS DIPLOMA FROM FILLMORE HIGH SCHOOL.

<P>
The driver in a graduation-night accident in which a Bardsdale teen-ager died 
was charged Tuesday with vehicular manslaughter and gross negligence. 
</P>
<P>
Justin Neff, 20, also was charged with causing bodily injury while driving 
under the influence of alcohol and with being under the influence of cocaine at 
the time of the accident. He could be sentenced to a maximum of 10 years in 
prison, Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard E. Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
The charges stem from an accident on Guiberson Road south of Fillmore about 
1:30 a.m. on June 15. Neff, a 1988 graduate of Fillmore High School, traveled 
from his home in Garden Grove to attend the school's 1990 commencement, 
witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
At a party, Neff met James Anderson, 18, who had just received his diploma, and 
agreed to give him a ride home, witnesses said. Anderson died when Neff lost 
control of his car and it smashed into a utility pole. The vehicle was cut in 
half on impact. 
</P>
<P>
Neff, who suffered internal injuries, appeared in Ventura County Municipal 
Court in a wheelchair on Tuesday. His arraignment was continued until July 17 
and the case has been assigned to Superior Court Judge Lawrence Storch. 
</P>
<P>
One of Neff's two attorneys, Richard C. Loy, said he still is studying the 
evidence but expects to enter a not-guilty plea. Loy, who frequently handles 
drunk-driving cases, is assisting attorney Michael Norris of Redondo Beach on 
the Neff case. 
</P>
<P>
Neff is being held in the infirmary of the Ventura County Jail, with bail set 
at $250,000. The normal bail for gross vehicular manslaughter is $10,000, but 
Neff's was increased at the request of the California Highway Patrol, which 
investigated the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that Neff had been convicted of drunk driving for the second time only 
two days before the accident, CHP Investigator M.E. Polanco wrote: "In light of 
his past actions . . . Neff is clearly a danger to society." 
</P>
<P>
In his request for a higher bail, Polanco also said that Neff has been 
convicted five times of being under the influence of cocaine, has an extensive 
record of traffic violations and has been convicted of battery and resisting 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
For a conviction of vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence, the state 
must prove that Neff was negligent in causing the crash, Holmes said. He said 
he considered charging Neff with second-degree murder before deciding that the 
manslaughter charge was "appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Second-degree murder carries a term of 15 years to life, and prosecutors have 
to prove malice to get a conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes declined to reveal the results of blood-alcohol tests. He did confirm, 
however, that evidence includes a videotape seized from a Chevron station in 
Fillmore. Employees of the store said in an interview that Neff tried to 
purchase beer there the night of the accident but was refused because he 
appeared to be intoxicated.

The sales of fireworks in Fillmore were reportedly far below normal on Tuesday, 
the day before the Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the fireworks booths that line California 126 were abandoned at midday. 
Workers at others said their sales were just limping along. 
</P>
<P>
George Kutbach, president of the Fillmore Jaycees, said he began the day at 6 
a.m. trying to drum up business by waving a large American flag at motorists 
and truck drivers. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants to be stuck with all these fireworks," Kutbach said. Workers at 
several of the 19 booths lining California 126 said sales had fallen by 10% to 
25% contrasted with last year's. The service clubs that sell the fireworks have 
previously reported earning $10,000 to $40,000 during the week of legal sales. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Haase, fireworks chairwoman for the Fillmore Historical Society, said 
sales were among the slowest in a long time, down by as much as a third for her 
group. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Santa Barbara and the Glendale fires have had some impacts," Haase 
said. "Although they weren't caused by fireworks, I think people are more 
aware." 
</P>
<P>
Other workers said the midweek holiday means fewer travelers were passing 
through Fillmore just before the Fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore permits the sale by nonprofit groups and the use of so-called "safe 
and sane" fireworks. It is the only Ventura County city to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Safe and sane fireworks, by definition, sparkle and whistle but do not leave 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the name, firefighters say the fireworks are not entirely safe. Last 
year, the devices were blamed for 14 of 29 fires between June 17 and July 17 in 
Ventura County, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Although service clubs bemoaned the drop in business, one county fire official 
said it may lighten today's workload for firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the reason is, fireworks sales are down, and we're pleased," said 
Deputy Chief Bob Holaway of the Ventura County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good thing for the citizens if sales are down. It means that there are 
going to be that much fewer fireworks out there." 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore Fire Chief Pat Askren attributed the drop to a Fire Department 
campaign focusing on the hazard fireworks pose to the drought-parched hills of 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Askren said he has also made an attempt this year to crack down on people who 
purchase or parents who allow their children to possess illegal fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
Truck driver Richard Cox, 31, of Tracy stopped to buy $11 worth of fireworks in 
Fillmore while hauling aluminum to Valencia. Cox said hillsides in the San 
Joaquin Valley county where he lives are as dry and vulnerable to fire as those 
around Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"Down here, things are so dry it surprises me that they're still selling 
fireworks," Cox said. "I'm buying them because we don't have them up there." 
</P>
<P>
Alfonso Cardenas, 24, of Oxnard said he plans to have a large July Fourth 
gathering during which relatives will light the $70 worth of fireworks his 
family chipped in to buy. 
</P>
<P>
"The intention is not to harm anybody," Cardenas said. However, the ban on 
fireworks in his home city did not deter him from buying. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's illegal, it's illegal," Cardenas said. "I guess I'll go to jail." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ALERT 
</P>
<P>
Police and fire officials are conducting stepped-up patrols looking for people 
using illegal fireworks. B3

REPRIMANDED NAVY DOCTOR CITES EXAMPLE OF WASTE; 
</P>
<P>
SURGERY: MITCHELL J. GRAYSON SAYS A RECENT $25,000 OPERATION SHOWS JUST HOW 
PETTY IT WAS FOR THE NAVY TO CRITICIZE HIS USE OF ITS MEDICAL INSTRUMENTS TO DO 
CHARITY WORK IN TIJUANA. 
</P>

<P>
The admiral in charge of the San Diego Navy hospital sent a servicewoman to 
Atlanta this year for $25,000 in surgery that could have been done at the 
hospital here at no extra cost to the government, according to a former Navy 
physician who said he had offered to do the surgery in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Rear Adm. R.B. Halder authorized the surgery because the woman had become 
disgruntled over being turned down for surgery by a visiting Atlanta expert 
when he visited San Diego on a teaching trip last August, said the former Navy 
doctor, Mitchell J. Grayson. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew that someone was intervening on her behalf," Grayson said. "I'm not 
sure whether someone told me or whether I just kind of knew -- I mean, that's 
the way the system works." 
</P>
<P>
Grayson made the charges public this week after receiving final notice that his 
ties with the Navy are severed. Grayson was held in the Navy beyond his 
original February discharge date until an investigation of his use of Navy 
surgical instruments for charity care in Tijuana was completed. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that he is bitter over a subsequent reprimand from Halder for 
"inexcusable" conduct, Grayson said the case of the $25,000 spent for 
out-of-state surgery points out how petty the investigation of him was. 
</P>
<P>
"This really points out the hypocrisy of the Navy, and particularly of my 
commanding officer (Halder)," Grayson said. Pointing to a Navy regulation, he 
added, "The same gentleman who castigated me is I think guilty of the waste, 
fraud and abuse that is defined in that Navy handout." 
</P>
<P>
The incident Grayson detailed is supported by letters between him and the 
Atlanta doctor, whom he declined to identify. However, The Times learned 
elsewhere that the plastic surgeon was Dr. Carl Hartrampf Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Hartrampf could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
A letter from Hartrampf, dated June 15, said the Navy woman was sent to Atlanta 
three times for the surgery and follow-up procedures. 
</P>
<P>
The woman had her initial breast reconstruction operation "on Feb. 1, 1990, and 
her nipple/areola reconstruction on March 20," the letter says. "She is 
scheduled to return for her nipple tattoo this month, and I am happy to report 
that she is doing well. The Navy paid my usual fee for the breast 
reconstruction and nipple/areolar reconstruction." 
</P>
<P>
The operation the woman had is called a TRAM flap; the acronym stands for 
"transverse rectus abdominus myocutaneous." In this surgery, part of a 
lower-abdominal muscle and abdominal skin are partially detached, rotated and 
then reconnected to blood vessels in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
The muscle tissue is used to reconstruct a cancer patient's breast after 
mastectomy, said Dr. Jack Fisher, head of the division of plastic surgery at UC 
San Diego Medical Center. In some women, the method is preferable to artificial 
implants, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Plastic surgeons at the Naval Hospital are "very high quality" and are easily 
qualified to do the TRAM operation, Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
The surgery has been in use for several years, and Hartrampf is one of its 
developers, so he teaches classes in it for plastic surgeons, Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
During a teaching visit to San Diego last August, Hartrampf arranged to do a 
demonstration of a TRAM flap operation at Naval Hospital, Grayson said. 
</P>
<P>
Grayson found one 56-year-old woman who appeared to be the perfect candidate 
for the surgery, and asked a second woman -- an active-duty Navy servicewoman 
in San Diego -- to be ready for surgery that day in case the first patient 
couldn't be used, he said. 
</P>
<P>
On the day of surgery, Aug. 24, the Atlanta doctor concluded that the 
56-year-old woman was indeed an ideal candidate, so the second woman was sent 
home, Grayson said. 
</P>
<P>
Grayson, who was head of the plastic surgery division at Naval Hospital, wrote 
in a Sept. 6 letter to Hartrampf that this woman had lodged a formal complaint 
about not having the surgery done. 
</P>
<P>
Grayson said he had several conversations with Halder and a patient advocate at 
the hospital about the woman's case, and it was clear to him that this was 
being treated as a special case. He recounts them this way: 
</P>
<P>
"Our first interviews were, 'What happened?' Then the thrust came, 'Can we take 
care of her expeditiously?' And so we got her scheduled promptly (at Naval 
Hospital) for Sept. 21," Grayson said. "Then, the next conversations were that 
(the Atlanta doctor) had agreed to do the operation for half price, and it's 
just going to cost us $25,000, so we'll send her over there for three or four 
trips." 
</P>
<P>
He was surprised by the action, Grayson said, because the operation could have 
been done at the Naval Hospital or -- if a civilian doctor was deemed necessary 
-- by other plastic surgeons in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Stephen Krant, a La Jolla plastic surgeon who is head of the division at 
Scripps Memorial Hospital-La Jolla, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of very well-qualified plastic and reconstructive surgeons in 
San Diego who are well qualified to do a TRAM flap," Krant said. 
</P>
<P>
Contacted for comment on the case, Adm. Halder said patients at Naval Hospital 
can be referred out for civilian care under a variety of mechanisms and 
circumstances. He declined to comment on any specific case, he said, because of 
legal restrictions on invading patient privacy by talking about their cases. 
</P>
<P>
He also declined to comment on whether he had authorized $25,000, including 
travel costs, to be spent on a breast reconstruction, again citing privacy 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Navy branch for which the woman works could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Grayson was reprimanded by Halder on May 24 for using $4,472 worth of surgical 
equipment in Operation Smile, a charity effort to correct cleft lips and 
palates in Tijuana children. Halder's citation against him said this "wrongful 
appropriation is inexcusable and falls well below the moral standards expected 
of a Naval officer." 
</P>
<P>
Grayson accepted the reprimand, but still protests that he returned all the 
instruments and that hospital officials had been aware all the time that he was 
borrowing them. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, his performance review for the year that ended in August, 1989, cites 
him for "outstanding" surgical performance and for his Operation Smile work 
because it "has brought much favorable publicity to Navy medicine." 
</P>
<P>
Grayson, released by the Navy last month, plans to move later this month to 
take a job at Pennsylvania's Guthrie Clinic.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: THERE'S NO PRIVACY IN WORLD OF ADVERTISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The medium is the message. Or: Advertising at your convenience. 
</P>
<P>
Think of it. A captive audience. Attention focused straight ahead. Eager for 
reading material. 
</P>
<P>
A perfect way to hit your target (audience). A wonderful chance to expose your 
client. 
</P>
<P>
It's here: eye-level advertising at urinals, and on the inside of toilet-stall 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell Media Inc., a new ad agency in Mira Mesa, is trying to tap the 
heretofore untapped water closet market. 
</P>
<P>
It's called "Stall Tactics." You peddle while they piddle. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a natural place for advertising," explained co-owner Sandra Maxwell. "You 
can count on having people's attention anywhere from 10 seconds to a minute. 
You can do a lot of selling in that time." 
</P>
<P>
This being San Diego County, naturally, the desired market is the upscale, 
car-buying, real-estate-buying, gadget-buying crowd, male and female. 
</P>
<P>
The trick is to match the right product with the right lookie-loo. 
</P>
<P>
It's called selective demographics. Restaurants and nightspots are the 
locations of choice. 
</P>
<P>
Thusly, beach apparel/surf gear at Club Diego in Pacific Beach, a Lexus car 
dealership at Paparazzi in La Jolla, cellular phones at Epazote's in Del Mar, a 
foreign car repair shop at the Triton in Cardiff. 
</P>
<P>
Also, spread out in North County: Samsonite, Merrill Lynch, Dow Corning and 
Budweiser. 
</P>
<P>
(All you wise guys can forget it. There are no plans to put bail bond ads in 
biker bars or rolling paper ads in reggae hangouts.) 
</P>
<P>
The ads are a Midwestern idea (Maxwell and her husband, Tom, are from 
Minneapolis) that has only recently migrated to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The ads are letter size (8 1/2-by-11), full-color and sealed behind glass. Four 
to six ads per space; market surveys say the more ads, the more likely that 
people will retain the pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Word of the restroom ads was relayed by a tipster who saw them at Cilantro's in 
Rancho Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
A real stand-up guy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gone, Like the Old West 
</P>
<P>
Mobley Meadows Milam is looking for a few good guns: family six-shooters stolen 
from his Sunset Cliffs home in a recent burglary. 
</P>
<P>
The 66-year-old attorney and former federal prosecutor hopes a pawnbroker or 
swap meet devotee will notice the historic pieces: a Civil War-era Remington 
(serial No. 86543) and a turn-of-the-century Smith &amp; Wesson (serial No. 
B-178470). 
</P>
<P>
The Remington was owned by Milam's great-grandfather John Meadows (1828-1882), 
teacher, preacher, wagon-trail boss and sheriff of Tulare County. 
</P>
<P>
The Smith &amp; Wesson belonged to Milam's grandfather Mobley Meadows 
(1875-1915), the legendary sheriff of Imperial County whose statue still graces 
the county fairgrounds outside El Centro. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll probably get around $1,000 from the insurance company, but I'd much 
rather have the guns back," Milam said. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily, the thief missed some heirlooms. Like the (supposed) scalp of the 
Indian who killed John Meadows in the Arizona uprising known as Meadows' 
Massacre. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God the burglar didn't get that," Milam said. 
</P>
<P>
I went out to take a look. He wasn't kidding. 
</P>

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLAN TO CHARGE RESIDENTS FOR EXTRA TRASH 
ADVANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles City Council panel, in a bid to encourage recycling, approved a 
plan Tuesday to charge homeowners who generate large amounts of trash higher 
fees for extra trash containers. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal that was endorsed unanimously by the Budget and Finance 
Committee, residents who participate in a new mandatory curbside recycling 
program would be given two 60-gallon containers and a recycling bin free. 
</P>
<P>
However, residents would be charged $5.35 per month for a 90-gallon container. 
Those requiring a third container would be charged $8.60 a month for an extra 
60-gallon container, or $12.60 for another 90-gallon can. 
</P>
<P>
"The focus of this proposal is not to raise revenue, but to change our habits 
by charging those of us who don't, after recycling, reduce our volume of 
waste," said Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky.

SCHOOL BOND ISSUE OKD FOR BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Moorpark voters will decide in November whether to approve a $25.5-million bond 
measure that would be used to build three new schools and renovate several 
existing ones. 
</P>
<P>
The Moorpark Unified School District, which decided in a special meeting Monday 
to place the measure on the ballot, submitted the measure Tuesday to county 
election officials. 
</P>
<P>
The deadline for a measure to be placed on the ballot is July 6. 
</P>
<P>
The bond measure needs a two-thirds vote to pass, and would increase property 
taxes an average of about $280 a year for a house with an assessed value of 
$200,000. 
</P>
<P>
District officials had considered a $32-million bond measure, but decreased it 
by $6.5 million after meeting with architects, facilities managers and the 
district's financial adviser. The meeting produced a precise list of facilities 
needed and a streamlined schedule for carrying out the projects, said Carmela 
Vignocchi, assistant superintendent for business services. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to building three schools, district officials would use the bond 
money to renovate several existing schools, including Flory and Peach Hill 
elementary schools, Chaparral Middle School and Moorpark Memorial High School, 
Vignocchi said. 
</P>
<P>
But funds from the measure will cover only some of the needs of the 
fast-growing 5,400-student district, which has been expanding at a rate of 
about 400 students a year. 
</P>
<P>
District officials estimate that an additional $22 million will be needed for 
new construction, land and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Officials hope to get the additional money from state school building funds and 
from the lease and sale of surplus school property, Vignocchi said. ADRIANNE

WATER CONSUMPTION DOWN 25% IN JUNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Casitas Municipal Water District is reporting a 25% reduction in water 
usage in June compared with the same month last year. 
</P>
<P>
The water company, which sells 40% of its water to Ventura residents and the 
rest to those in the Ojai Valley, asked all its customers in April to 
voluntarily reduce their water consumption by 20%. 
</P>
<P>
Casitas customers, who used 2,485 acre-feet of water during June, 1989, 
consumed only 1,861 acre-feet this June, said Richard Barnett, Casitas' chief 
engineer. 
</P>
<P>
But Barnett said that it is too soon to tell if voluntary conservation efforts 
in the Ojai Valley will prevent the need for mandatory water rationing in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
"A large part of that savings is probably Ventura," Barnett said Tuesday after 
city officials reported that Ventura residents have cut water use by 25% since 
the city started mandatory rationing two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Casitas officials had warned for several months prior to April that mandatory 
rationing would go into effect next year if the voluntary program does not 
succeed in cutting water use by at least 20% this year. 
</P>
<P>
Barnett said the real test of voluntary conservation will occur during the next 
three months when water usage is usually highest for agricultural and 
residential irrigation. THIA BELL

SETTLEMENT OFFERED IN LIGHT POLE SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN McKEAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of Ventura homeowners have proposed a settlement in the suit against 
the Ventura Unified School District over four stadium light poles they say are 
too tall. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal presented to the Board of Education last week, the district 
would reduce the height of the four poles at Larabee Stadium to 70 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The two poles on the south side of the stadium are 80 feet tall, and the two 
poles on the north side -- nearest the residences -- are 130 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners say the new poles block their views and shine into their 
hillside houses. 
</P>
<P>
The stadium in the 2200 block of Poli Street is primarily used for Ventura High 
School athletic events. 
</P>
<P>
It also is used by Ventura College and other local schools, and is occasionally 
rented by other organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The district replaced its older light poles, which were 65 feet tall, late last 
summer after some lights fell off during a strong wind. 
</P>
<P>
The new poles cost the district about $150,000; about $25,000 came from 
residents' groups that held fund-raisers, and the remainder was borrowed from 
the city of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Just before the lights were installed, the homeowners sued the district to 
prevent installation of the lights. A judge, however, rejected their request.

The city manager of Thousand Oaks on Tuesday sharply criticized a 
recommendation by the Ventura County Grand Jury that money generated by sales 
taxes be allocated to each city based on its population instead of on the 
amount of money collected in its retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
The state Legislature would have to amend the state Constitution to implement 
the grand jury's suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be grossly unfair," said City Manager Grant Brimhall, whose city 
could end up losing several million dollars in taxes annually if the suggestion 
is implemented by the state. "We already contribute 60% to the county general 
fund on a per capita basis. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a view that the east county is rich and we ought to pay for everyone 
else's costs. . . . There are those who say, 'Let's take more from Thousand 
Oaks.' " 
</P>
<P>
Brimhall said Thousand Oaks spends money to cope with traffic generated by 
retail stores, and should therefore be allowed to keep a greater portion of the 
tax money. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks, with a population of 104,378, received $103.87 per person in 
sales tax, according to the State Board of Equalization Annual Report for 
1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Port Hueneme, with a population of 20,501, received $26.37 per 
person -- the least amount of sales tax of any city in the county. Moorpark, 
with 25,173 people, received $29.87 per person. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury said it has observed that cities scramble to attract retail and 
industrial development to increase their revenue. TINA DAUNT

SUPERVISORS OK STUDY OF WHETHER TO REPLACE OR UPGRADE COURTHOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
EXPANSION: BUT PROPOSALS TO ADD $306-MILLION HIGH RISE OR BUILD A NEW 
$420-MILLION FACILITY MAY BE SCUTTLED BY A COURT RULING THAT COULD ANNUL 
FINANCING.

In the first major step toward expansion of the crowded downtown courthouse, 
the San Diego County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved a study that will 
examine whether to add a $306-million high-rise to the existing building or 
replace it with a $420-million facility. 
</P>
<P>
By a unanimous vote, the board selected those two options from among seven 
alternatives included in a study of the county's long-term criminal justice 
system needs -- a review that revolves around how, or if, the cramped 
26-year-old central downtown courthouse should be used. 
</P>
<P>
However, Tuesday's board action, which authorized additional refinements of the 
cost estimates and construction options over the next three months, could be 
rendered moot by a court decision expected later this summer that could 
determine whether the county can spend hundreds of millions of projected tax 
dollars on the project. 
</P>
<P>
Unless the county overturns a controversial 1989 court ruling that invalidated 
Proposition A, a voter-approved 1988 half-cent sales tax estimated to generate 
$1.6 billion for new jails and courts over the next decade, the courthouse 
expansion review could become little more than a frustrating academic exercise. 
</P>
<P>
"Without Prop. A, it isn't going to happen," acknowledged Rich Robinson, head 
of the county's Special Projects Office. "There's just no way to proceed with a 
project of this magnitude without that revenue. It's going to take Prop. A or 
Son of Prop. A to finance something this big." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a Riverside County Superior Court judge -- who heard the case 
because of local judges' conflict of interest on a matter affecting future 
courtroom space -- struck down the ballot measure on the grounds that it 
violated Proposition 13, the landmark 1978 statewide property-tax cutting 
initiative. The 4th District Court of Appeal heard the county's appeal of that 
decision last month and is expected to issue its ruling by September. 
</P>
<P>
While county officials wait and hope for a favorable court ruling, their 
real-estate consultants, Williams-Kuebelbeck &amp; Associates, and other 
analysts will proceed with studies aimed at helping the supervisors choose 
between expansion or replacement of the existing downtown courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
Local judges strongly favor replacement of the existing building, a position 
underlined by Presiding Superior Court Judge Judith McConnell's argument that 
spending more money on the courthouse "would be tantamount to throwing it down 
a black hole." 
</P>
<P>
Arguably the most notable among the courthouse's numerous shortcomings is a 
lack of space, which has made it necessary for temporary courtrooms to be built 
in an adjacent downtown hotel and another vacant building. The building also 
lacks adequate office and support space for purposes such as lawyer-client 
conference rooms and holding cells, and is plagued by problems stemming from 
deterioration of its mechanical system and other parts of its infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors, however, wanting to preserve their options, decided to pursue 
both possible expansion or replacement of the courthouse pending additional 
review of the cost differences and other distinctions. 
</P>
<P>
Both plans to be further studied under Tuesday's action envision adding 77 
courts and extensive office space to the existing 66-court facility, creating a 
143-court building designed to meet the county's needs until the year 2010. 
</P>
<P>
Of the two options, renovation and expansion would be less expensive, costing 
an estimated $306 million -- about $116 million less than demolition and 
replacement, according to projections from the Omni Group, a justice system 
consulting firm retained by the county 20 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Under the renovation plan, a 27-story tower -- equal in height to a 35-story 
building because of the courts' higher ceilings -- would be built next to the 
courthouse on the block bounded by A, B, Front and Union streets. 
</P>
<P>
The same block would be used under the second proposal to raze and replace the 
courthouse, a project estimated at about $422 million. If that option is 
selected, more court office space will be built on the block to the west, and 
the valuable property housing the existing courthouse could be sold by the 
county to raise substantial revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The new courthouse would have 1.9 million square feet, 700,000 more than are 
available in the renovation-expansion plan and nearly four times the size of 
the existing structure. 
</P>
<P>
Several other critical factors also will influence the project's overall cost 
and feasibility. Consultants have said that a $25-million parking structure 
also would be needed, and the county's Central Jail and detention facility -- 
situated in the existing courthouse building -- also would have to be 
relocated. If the courthouse is demolished, the jail obviously will have to be 
moved, and, even if the building is retained and renovated, the county's 
consultants recommend that the jail area be used for storage and office space. 
</P>
<P>
County plans call for the existing 1,000-prisoner jail to be eventually 
replaced by a 2,750-bed facility in Kearny Mesa on a site once considered for a 
proposed trash-to-energy plant.

BERNSON REVEALS PLANS FOR PORTER RANCH SCHOOL; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: A TOP DISTRICT OFFICIAL SAYS THE CITY COUNCILMAN'S PROPOSAL IS 
UNWORKABLE BECAUSE OF STATE LAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In an apparent bid to settle a feud with school officials and mollify his 
colleagues, Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson Tuesday unveiled a plan to 
guarantee construction of an elementary school within the huge Porter Ranch 
development. 
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for the Los Angeles Unified School District to sign an agreement 
exclusively earmarking the estimated $17 million in fees paid by the Porter 
Ranch developer to build a new elementary school within the development, a 
1,300-acre area in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
Without such an agreement, school officials could use the fees for school 
construction anywhere in the vast district. 
</P>
<P>
But within hours, Bernson's proposal was called unworkable by a top official 
with the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't do that," said Douglas Brown, chief of the LAUSD's building services 
division. Brown said the district is constrained by state law on how it may use 
developer fees. 
</P>
<P>
The school district is supposed to use the fees to meet immediate school 
construction needs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I see no reason why after this project is built out, the school district 
wouldn't want to build a school in Porter Ranch . . . if it's needed," Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But he said: "I don't think we can make that guarantee at this time." 
</P>
<P>
During a city Board of Referred Powers hearing two weeks ago on the project, 
Julie Korenstein, a West Valley school district member, accused Bernson of 
being unwilling to demand sufficient concessions from the Porter Ranch 
developer to provide for new schools. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, the Board of Referred Powers' other members -- all of whom serve 
on the City Council -- urged Bernson publicly to reach a compromise with the 
school system. 
</P>
<P>
The school question has been one of the few impediments facing the Porter Ranch 
Development Co. in recent days as its huge project has steadily moved toward a 
final vote next week by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Although refusing to identify Korenstein by name, Bernson said he hoped his 
plan would end the attempts of some to gain cheap political publicity out of 
the Porter Ranch-schools issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I have had some doubts about whether the school system really intends to build 
a school for Porter Ranch," Bernson said in an interview. "Now we'll see how 
serious they are." 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Her staff said she was vacationing on the 
</P>
<P>
East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Although school officials said Bernson's request that the school system earmark 
the Porter Ranch developer fees was not possible, another part of his plan won 
their applause. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, Porter Ranch Development Co. had agreed to set aside a seven-acre 
site for an elementary school up to the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein testified recently that the district wanted a longer option. 
</P>
<P>
The site -- at the southeast corner of the proposed extensions of Sesnon 
Boulevard and Mason Avenue -- should be set aside until 50% of the residences 
in the development were built and occupied, Korenstein proposed. 
</P>
<P>
The Porter Ranch-Bernson compromise unveiled Tuesday adopts Korenstein's 
position about how long the developer should reserve an elementary school site. 
</P>
<P>
The Porter Ranch project calls for constructing 6 million square feet of retail 
space and 3,395 housing units.

GOVERNOR VETOES BILL REQUIRING RAIL LINE TO BE UNDERGROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN and MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saying it dealt with an issue that should be resolved locally, Gov. George 
Deukmejian on Tuesday vetoed a bill that would have required that any rail line 
built in residential neighborhoods of North Hollywood and Van Nuys be 
underground. 
</P>
<P>
However, the bill's author late Tuesday raised the possibility that he may be 
able to reintroduce the bill with the governor's support. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, approved overwhelmingly two weeks ago by the Legislature, was 
introduced in an effort to shore up homeowner support for the decision by Los 
Angeles County rail officials to extend the downtown-to-North Hollywood Metro 
Rail subway westward through the two East Valley communities. Homeowner 
representatives said Tuesday that even if the bill is not revived, support for 
the subway extension should remain strong. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana), who authored the bill, admitted that the 
governor's veto caught him by surprise. He said the veto resulted from 
"miscommunication with the governor's office" and that he had secured a promise 
that the governor would reconsider the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins, conceding that a veto override is unlikely, said he hoped Deukmejian 
would support reintroducing the same legislation later this year. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Gore, Deukmejian's press secretary, acknowledged that the governor's 
office had agreed to take a second look at the measure. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to restudy the legislation was made because there "may be a fiscal 
consequence that was not outlined in the bill or in any of the senator's 
communications," Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Robbins, a little-noticed provision of the bill could save $39 
million in construction costs. The provision would permit the Los Angeles 
County Transportation Commission to shift the location of the planned North 
Hollywood Metro Rail station half a mile west or south of the intersection of 
Chandler and Lankershim boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
A 1984 law, also sponsored by Robbins, fixed the location at the boulevards' 
crossing. If rail engineers cannot shift the station, it will cost extra 
because the line would have to veer north of Chandler before gradually turning 
west, Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
The station's location was frozen by the 1984 law "so that the commission would 
have to go back to the Legislature if they decided to extend the subway," 
Robbins said. "That way, Valley legislators would have a say in designing any 
extension." 
</P>
<P>
County Transportation Commission officials, who supported Robbins' bill, were 
not available late Tuesday to comment on the senator's cost estimate. 
</P>
<P>
In March, the commission concluded years of studying San Fernando Valley rail 
options by selecting a 5.6-mile subway extension from North Hollywood to the 
San Diego Freeway over two rival east-west Valley rail plans. 
</P>
<P>
The commission voted to begin construction in 1996, with completion scheduled 
for 2001, when the downtown Metro Rail line is scheduled to be opened to North 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The extension, expected to cost $1.1 billion in 1989 dollars, is to be built 
along the Southern Pacific railroad's Burbank Branch right of way, which 
traverses a large single-family neighborhood in North Hollywood and Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
In his veto message, Deukmejian said, "When Los Angeles County voters approved 
Proposition A and its attendant half-cent sales tax increase, they gave 
authority to the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission to make design 
and location decisions." 
</P>
<P>
The state should not usurp that authority, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the veto, few involved in the long-running debate over Valley rail 
route options thought it would weaken the coalition of homeowner and business 
groups supporting the Metro Rail extension. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen any weakening of the coalition thus far," said Roger L. 
Stanard, a Warner Center attorney and spokesman for business groups, "and I 
don't expect there will be any from this veto. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope this veto doesn't unduly worry or antagonize people along the 
Burbank Branch." 
</P>
<P>
Some homeowner group leaders have expressed the fear that the commission, 
unbound by its 1990 decision to build a subway, would decide just before the 
start of construction to build the system at ground level to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
Kurt Hunter, president of the North Hollywood Homeowners Assn. and a staunch 
supporter of the Metro Rail extension, predicted the veto "would not put a 
strain on this coalition. I think just about everyone realizes this route 
politically could never be built except in a subway." 
</P>
<P>
In voting for the Metro Rail extension, the County Transportation Commission 
rejected two rival plans -- an elevated monorail line along the Ventura Freeway 
from Universal City to Warner Center and a light-rail line in a shallow trench 
along the Southern Pacific right of way from North Hollywood to Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
However, the issue may have been reopened by the results of a June 5 advisory 
referendum in which 48% of Valley residents voted for the monorail option, with 
21% favoring the light-rail line and only 10% voting for the Metro Rail 
extension. 
</P>
<P>
Monorail advocates have hailed the results as a call to the commission to 
reconsider its March vote for the subway extension.

PROPOSED DUMP'S EFFECT ON WATER SOURCE PROMPTS PACKARD LETTER TO EPA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a letter co-signed by three state legislators, U.S. Rep. Ronald Packard 
(R-Carlsbad) is asking the federal Environmental Protection Agency to study 
what damage a proposed county landfill in Fallbrook might do to the area's 
ground water. 
</P>
<P>
Packard said he is concerned that contaminants from the landfill might seep 
into the adjacent Rainbow Creek and flow into the Santa Margarita River, which 
provides 70% of the drinking water for neighboring Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
The Marine Corps base relies exclusively on underground water for drinking and 
agricultural uses. 
</P>
<P>
Packard said that, based on discussion with Camp Pendleton's water hydrologists 
and a review of the county's draft environmental impact report, "we have 
concerns that the (EIR) report may not properly address ground-water protection 
measures." 
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that failure of any or all ground-water protection measures 
proposed (in the county's EIR) would result in grave consequences for Camp 
Pendleton and San Diego County," Packard wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The letter is expected to be sent to the EPA on Thursday, said John Weil, 
Packard's administrative assistant. 
</P>
<P>
The letter is co-signed by state Assemblyman Bob Frazee (R-Carlsbad) and Sen. 
Marion Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), whose districts include Camp Pendleton and 
Fallbrook, as well as state Sen. Bill Craven (R-Carlsbad), whose district 
neighbors Pendleton to the south. 
</P>
<P>
The Fallbrook landfill site is one of three being considered by county 
officials to take much of North County's trash into the next century. The other 
two candidate sites are Gregory Canyon, alongside the San Luis Rey River and 
California 76, just east of Interstate 15, and Blue Canyon, along California 79 
near Warner Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents also have criticized the selection of the other two sites for a 
variety of reasons, including possible ground-water contamination and increased 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Already, the San Diego County Water Authority and the Metropolitan Water 
District, which provide wholesale water to the county's water districts, have 
opposed the Fallbrook dump site, along Aspen Road just west of I-15, because it 
sits astride four water transmission lines that deliver 90% of the county's 
water from the north. 
</P>
<P>
The Marine Corps has gone on record opposing the Fallbrook site because of 
fears that its source of water might be tainted by garbage contaminants that 
could seep from the landfill and into the nearby river. 
</P>
<P>
County officials have maintained that the landfill could be constructed with a 
bottom liner of clay and composite material in such a way that toxins could not 
escape the landfill and enter the ground water. 
</P>
<P>
But Packard said he's not so sure, and wants the EPA to study the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"Camp Pendleton is self-contained in terms of water, and does a magnificent job 
of managing its water," Packard said. "To run the risk of contaminating that 
very source of water would be a tragic mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"I recognize the dilemma of finding landfill sites, but when it comes to 
ground-water resources, it would be very short-sighted to contaminate that 
life-saving resource." 
</P>
<P>
An EPA spokeswoman in San Francisco said the agency could not respond to 
Packard's request until it received the letter. 
</P>
<P>
"But we'll take a look at it to see what the congressman is asking us to do," 
said Ida Tolliver of the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
Packard said he isn't concerned that the EPA's study might further delay the 
county's efforts to select and develop a landfill in North County. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not trying to stick up impediments and stumbling blocks," he said. "And 
I'm not opposing landfills. But I want to make certain we don't destroy our 
water supplies. This shouldn't be railroaded through. It's far better to study 
this now than to plunge ahead and have to live with a major, major problem for 
decades. I'm not one for studying things to death, but when it comes to 
something as critical as water, we can't be too careful."

APARTMENT MANAGER'S KILLER GIVEN DEATH SENTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Mark Alan Bradford was sentenced Tuesday to die in the gas chamber for raping, 
strangling and stabbing to death the manager of his Panorama City apartment 
building in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"The circumstances of this crime are appalling," Van Nuys Superior Court Judge 
Michael J. Farrell said before sentencing Bradford, convicted in May of 
murdering Lynea Kokes, 28, on April 18, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In condemning Bradford, 27, Farrell rejected a last-minute plea for leniency 
from Deputy Public Defender Dennis G. Cohen, who argued that Bradford's attack 
on Kokes was a "one-time horrible, horrible abnormality." Cohen said the death 
penalty should be reserved for offenders with long criminal histories and "We 
don't have that here with Mark Bradford." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Carole Anne Chizever applauded the judge's decision. "It was 
appropriate," she said outside the courtroom. "This is the kind of case that 
cries out for the death penalty." 
</P>
<P>
Bradford's sentence will be appealed automatically to the California Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't lose heart," Farrell told Bradford before bailiffs led Bradford away. 
"Use the time you have left to prove to yourself and to the Lord the person you 
can be." 
</P>
<P>
Jurors who recommended the death penalty said they were influenced by 
Bradford's apparent lack of remorse in court and during a taped confession to 
police. On Tuesday, Bradford submitted a letter to Farrell apologizing for the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
"I sit up days and nights wondering why this had to happen," wrote Bradford, a 
convalescent home cook. "I would give anything for it to be me dead than Mrs. 
Kokes. Things would be better off. . . . I am deeply sorry for my actions for 
what has happened." 
</P>
<P>
Bradford confessed to Los Angeles police that he choked, raped and sodomized 
Kokes after helping her move into the apartment in the 9500 block of Van Nuys 
Boulevard. He said he went home and showered before deciding to come back and 
kill Kokes with a kitchen knife to prevent her from reporting the crime. 
</P>
<P>
Kokes was moving in with her husband and infant son to become the new on-site 
manager as part of an effort by the apartment building's new owners to evict 
drug dealers and prostitutes from the complex and encourage young families to 
move in, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Kokes' husband, Alex, came home and found his wife dead hours after the 
killing. Bradford was arrested at his apartment later that night after his 
roommate found a broken knife in Bradford's laundry and called the police.

PANEL SUPPORTS PLAN TO BUILD 277 HOUSES; 
</P>
<P>
SYLMAR: A LONE PLANNING COMMITTEE MEMBER APPROVES THE PROJECT, WHICH NEXT WILL

<P>
A plan to build 277 single-family houses in Sylmar won approval from the 
chairman of the Los Angeles City Council's Planning Committee Tuesday after the 
developer was directed to update a study of the project's effect on traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The Carey Ranch project, located in Councilman Ernani Bernardi's district, next 
goes to the City Council for approval of a series of zoning changes and 
amendments to the Sylmar Community Plan. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Hal Bernson, chairman of the committee, was the only member present 
for the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
A city Planning Department report, filed with the committee, said 75 acres of 
the 137-acre project were being set aside for open space, including 16.5 acres 
for a community park. 
</P>
<P>
The Carey Ranch property runs along the east side of the Golden State Freeway 
north of Hubbard Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Department reportedly observed that the project would have a 
negative effect because it would not create permanent jobs in Sylmar. The 
community is already too jobs-poor and housing-rich, and the addition of 277 
homes would only exacerbate this imbalance, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
Jobs-housing balance has become an increasingly important criterion in the eyes 
of city planners concerned about reducing traffic congestion by integrating 
housing and workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the project will not provide affordable housing, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the report says, the project "will further overburden fire and library 
services in the Sylmar community" which is now served by Fire Station No. 91, 
"a single engine company, and the Sylmar Library, a 5,511-square-foot 
facility." 
</P>
<P>
To ease these conditions, the city will require the developer to support the 
creation of a special tax district in Sylmar to finance construction of new 
public facilities, the report says.

LANCASTER SCHOOL BOND MEASURE WON'T BE ON BALLOT IN NOVEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Officials in the troubled Lancaster School District, where voters rejected a 
$47-million school bond measure only three months ago, decided Tuesday against 
a plan to place the same measure on the ballot again in November. 
</P>
<P>
Some school board members and officials in the 10,800-student district had been 
considering another attempt to press voters for a tax hike. 
</P>
<P>
But the district's new superintendent, who started work only this week, 
persuaded the school board to wait for better times. 
</P>
<P>
"The timing is not right for our district. We need an opportunity to develop 
some programs and do some things to have some positives," Supt. David Alvarez 
said. In recent months, he said, the district has suffered a series of setbacks 
that have not fostered public confidence. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, state officials recently said the district missed an application 
deadline that cost it eligibility for about $5 million in state school bond 
money. 
</P>
<P>
And in a separate dispute, state officials are pressing the district to return 
$1 million to $2 million in state aid for having too many portable classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
After a brief debate Tuesday night, the district's board of trustees voted 5 to 
0 to accept Alvarez's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
The district's aborted ballot measure would have cost the owner of a typical 
home, assessed at $150,000, an average of $60.53 a year for the 30-year life of 
the tax. 
</P>
<P>
District officials felt they came close in the April 10 election when Measure 
A, their original $47-million general obligation bond measure, fell 570 votes 
short of passage out of 8,339 ballots cast. 
</P>
<P>
The measure needed a two-thirds vote but got 59.8%. 
</P>
<P>
School officials argued that they might have won the election if thousands of 
their campaign mailers had not gone undelivered. School officials blamed the 
Lancaster Post Office, but postal officials said the literature was mailed too 
late. 
</P>
<P>
The mail dispute, combined with advice from the district's consultants that a 
second election could be won, encouraged some school officials to try again on 
the Nov. 6 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
But Alvarez said the recent setbacks would harm the measure's chances this 
year, and the school board should reconsider the issue next year.

DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FUTURE HOMEOWNERS WOULD PAY SCHOOL TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The governing board of the Palmdale School District, searching for a new source 
of funding for school construction, gave preliminary approval Tuesday to a 
special tax on future housing in the fast-growing district. 
</P>
<P>
The Palmdale School District Board of Trustees set an Aug. 7 public hearing on 
its proposed Mello-Roos tax district, named for the authors of the 1982 state 
law that created them. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, owners of homes built in the district in the future would pay 
$400 to $500 a year to start, and the tax would increase with inflation over 
its 30-year life. The starting annual rate for the tax would be 22 cents per 
square foot of development. Future condos and apartments also would be taxed. 
</P>
<P>
Although existing homes would be exempt, officials said Palmdale still would be 
the first school district in Los Angeles County to impose such a districtwide 
tax on future homes. 
</P>
<P>
The tax could raise up to $300 million, about $118 million for new and 
refurbished schools and most of the rest for financing costs. The tax is 
unusual because developers, who own most of the undeveloped land, can vote on 
whether to accept it. But it would be paid by those who buy homes from them.

DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL ALTERS ZONING TO SAVE TRAILER PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to thwart plans to shut 
down the 27-unit Woodley Trailer Lodge in Van Nuys and replace the mobile home 
park with a commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
The move was initiated by Councilman Joel Wachs to prevent developer Yechezkel 
Lehavi from scrapping the trailer park, evicting its tenants and building a 
commercial or industrial project on the site. 
</P>
<P>
By adopting the Wachs proposal, the council changed the zoning of Lehavi's 
property from manufacturing to residential-mobile home park. 
</P>
<P>
The one-acre parcel, the site of a mobile home park since 1948, is surrounded 
by industrial properties, including a machine shop and a plastics manufacturing 
company. 
</P>
<P>
A city Planning Department hearing examiner earlier had recommended disapproval 
of the Wachs plan. Not only is the mobile home park incompatible with the 
adjoining industrial sites, but it is also highly vulnerable to noise from the 
nearby Van Nuys Airport because mobile homes are "nearly impossible to 
soundproof," the hearing examiner warned.

MIKE DOWNEY: WORLD CUP '90; 
</P>
<P>
GOYCOCHEA BECOMES NAME TO REMEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NAPLES, Italy 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who, anywhere in Argentina, from the highest hill of the Andes to the flattest 
part of the Pampas, ever would have guessed that the greatest thing that could 
happen to soccer's reigning kings -- the lucky break that could give the 
Argentines a chance to keep their precious Cup -- was that their goalkeeper 
would break his leg? 
</P>
<P>
It sure did develop into a star-is-born, send-in-the-understudy story for 
Sergio Javier Goycochea, 27, who replaced Argentina's original goalkeeper a 
week into the World Cup tournament, with virtually nothing to recommend his 
being here at all, and suddenly has become his side's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, after a 1-1 draw led to a riveting penalty-kick shootout, which 
Argentina won, leaving more than just the landmarks of Italy in ruins, the man 
whose name was being discussed or cursed, not to mention mispronounced, by many 
of the 59,978 filing out of Stadio San Paolo was not Diego Maradona, the 
Argentine idol, but Goycochea, who batted away back-to-back, point-blank shots 
in the shootout to put his country, quite unexpectedly, into Sunday's final. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unbelievable for me to be playing here," Goycochea said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
More than three weeks ago, Argentina kicked off World Cup competition with an 
ego-deflating 1-0 loss to Cameroon, embarrassing partly because the winners 
were two players short at game's end because of expulsions, but also because 
the game's only goal slipped through the fingers of Nery Pumpido, the normally 
sure-handed goalkeeper. Cameroon's shot was a dribbler that Pumpido ordinarily 
could stop in his sleep. 
</P>
<P>
After that, his luck did not improve. Pumpido was carried off the field in 
Argentina's next game with a broken leg. And the coach, Carlos Bilardo, was 
forced to turn to the inexperienced Goycochea, who some back home considered to 
be no better than Argentina's fourth-best goalkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not surprised that Carlos picked me to come, because he knows me very, 
very well," Goycochea said. "But I did have a few doubts about my own play." 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, a bad shoulder kept Goycochea out of action last year for close 
to six months. Then, when he was pronounced fit for duty in a league in 
Colombia, the strangest thing happened: The season was canceled after a few 
weeks because one of the league's referees, in an incident that led to 
accusations of involvement by organized crime, was found murdered. 
</P>
<P>
So, the goalie remained pretty much inactive. And though Goycochea fantasized 
about the World Cup, imagining himself doing the very same things his boyhood 
hero Ubaldo Fillol did in goal when Argentina won the 1978 championship, the 
fact remained that Pumpido would get the first call. 
</P>
<P>
Then some breaks began to come his way. Argentina's No. 2 goalkeeper announced 
that he did not care to go to the Cup unless he was promoted to No. 1. The 
coach had his own ideas. A third goalie had far more international experience, 
but Bilardo thought him to be a bit too old. Besides, he doubted Argentina 
would even need a backup in Italy, as long as Pumpido would be around. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as the last half of June, even the great Maradona expressed public 
doubts that Argentina had the necessary talent to repeat as World Cup champion. 
"We should not hide the fact that we are not at the same level as Italy, Brazil 
and West Germany," Maradona said as he and his teammates limped into the later 
rounds. 
</P>
<P>
How this tune has changed. Where once he claimed it would take a miracle to get 
past Brazil, Maradona said Tuesday: "Today was not a miracle, because Argentina 
was really fit this time, really prepared to play. We could talk about a 
miracle before the match, but not now, not after." 
</P>
<P>
Nobody looked more fit than Goycochea, who sent his body hurtling through 
space, with only a split-second to decide in which direction, to save the day 
for Argentina. Not just in the shootout, either. In the first overtime period, 
Italian superstar Roberto Baggio kicked a wicked liner that was headed into the 
top of the net until Goycochea leaped and finger-tipped it over the crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the shootout, in which his timing was superb. 
</P>
<P>
After missing the first one, Goycochea got a hand on Baggio's line drive to his 
right, and just missed keeping it from crossing the line. He thanked Maradona 
for a tip on how Baggio would approach the shot, but admitted that about all a 
goalie can do is dive and pray, because: "You cannot think in those moments. 
There is no time." 
</P>
<P>
Up stepped Italy's Luigi De Agostini for Italy's third attempt, and he, too, 
was successful. But Roberto Donadoni was not, aiming to the left of the goalie, 
who guessed correctly and knocked it away. And then, after Maradona put 
Argentina ahead, Goycochea hunched down low for Aldo Serena's shot, blocked it 
and won it. 
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Italians sat frozen in their seats, unwilling or unable to 
move. 
</P>
<P>
The World Cup had been one big party up to now, with every one of the host 
team's previous games played in Rome and every one won by shutout. Night after 
night, songs were sung, horns were honked and wines were drunk. 
</P>
<P>
The last thing the soccer lovers of Italy expected was to lose to somebody 
named Sergio Goycochea. Few of them had ever heard of anybody named Goycochea, 
fewer could pronounce it, and even fewer, by night's end, cared to try.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a typical British summer day, the sun played touch and go with clouds, the 
temperature dipped and the wind blew, taking Monica Seles along with it. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Steffi Graf and second-seeded Martina Navratilova marched in step to 
a Wimbledon final that appears more likely each day. Seles, seeded third, was 
not as lucky. 
</P>
<P>
Fifth-seeded Zina Garrison fought off one match point and ended Seles' 36-match 
winning streak with an uphill, 3-6, 6-3, 9-7, victory Tuesday in the only upset 
of the women's quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Seles, who managed her trademark Woody Woodpecker laugh afterward, had won six 
consecutive tournaments in the year's biggest stretch of success before running 
into Garrison's grass-court game. 
</P>
<P>
Garrison, whose previous best Wimbledon result was in 1985 when she lost to 
Navratilova in the semifinals, credits an improved mental outlook. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I have a better chance this year because I'm a lot more relaxed," 
Garrison said. "I'm playing within my older self." 
</P>
<P>
Pardon? 
</P>
<P>
"My older self," she said. "I'm 26, yeah. (The) old person on the tour, now." 
</P>
<P>
Not as long as Navratilova is around. At 33, Navratilova is the oldest player 
on the women's tour. In her quarterfinal match against seventh-seeded Katarina 
Maleeva, Navratilova won, 6-1, 6-1, in a withering 48-minute display. 
</P>
<P>
It was Navratilova's third victory by the same score, a statistic she 
appreciated, even though she isn't getting much playing time. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't get paid by the minute," Navratilova said. "I'm not complaining." 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova's victory was a record 97th at Wimbledon, moving her past Chris 
Evert. If Navratilova is to get No. 98 in the semifinals Thursday, it must come 
at the expense of fourth-seeded Gabriela Sabatini. 
</P>
<P>
With Navratilova watching the match from the press seats, Sabatini needed 2 
hours 22 minutes to defeat 11th-seeded Natalia Zvereva, 6-2, 2-6, 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
Graf struggled early, then moved swiftly past 13th-seeded Jana Novotna, 7-5, 
6-2, and next runs into Garrison, an unexpected foe, in the semifinals. Graf 
thought she would be playing Seles. 
</P>
<P>
"To tell you the truth, I was hoping to play against her really badly, so I am 
a little disappointed about it, yes," Graf said. 
</P>
<P>
Ivan Lendl was disappointed he lost the first set against Alex Antonitsch, but 
quite happy to win the next three and come away with a 3-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 
victory in the fourth round. 
</P>
<P>
The long road continues for Lendl, who plays his third match in three days 
today when he meets unseeded Brad Pearce of Provo, Utah, in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Pearce, 24, a former UCLA All-American who has never won a tournament or been 
ranked higher than No. 90, won his fourth-round match against Mark Woodforde, 
6-4, 6-4, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
One of the shortest players on the tour at 5 feet 9, Pearce turned pro after 
his sophomore year at UCLA when he reached the semifinals of the NCAA 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Ranked No. 120, he is the lowest-ranked player left. Pearce said that Provo is 
not exactly a tennis hotbed, but admitted he might be the best player from the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
"It's safe to say that," Pearce said. 
</P>
<P>
Graf's victory extended her Wimbledon record to 32-4, and one more will put her 
into her 14th consecutive Grand Slam final. The only other person to do that is 
Navratilova. 
</P>
<P>
If Graf expected to be playing Seles, almost everyone who sat at Court 1 
Tuesday thought the same thing, especially after Seles closed out the first set 
against Garrison in 31 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
But Garrison won the second set, the difference a single service break in the 
fourth game. No one held serve until the fourth game of the third set when 
Garrison took a 3-1 lead that became 4-1 when she broke Seles at love. 
</P>
<P>
Serving for 5-1, Garrison lost at love and Seles eventually caught up at 4-4. 
Then Garrison's serve was broken a third time. 
</P>
<P>
Garrison thought she made a mental mistake when she served for 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably said the wrong thing to myself," Garrison said. "But I felt that 
she was going to come back to 4-4, and I just said to myself that I (should) 
just bear down, whatever the circumstances, just give it my best." 
</P>
<P>
The circumstances were soon dire. Seles held serve for 7-6 and was at match 
point on Garrison's serve after Garrison hit a forehand into the net for 30-40. 
But if Garrison had seemed tentative before, she no longer was. 
</P>
<P>
Garrison cracked a forehand cross-court for deuce, hit the same shot for her 
advantage and followed it with a forehand passing shot that dribbled off Seles' 
racket. 
</P>
<P>
One point away from winning, Seles was caught off guard. 
</P>
<P>
Seles lost her serve at 15-40 to put Garrison up, 8-7. Then Garrison quickly 
went ahead again, 40-0, and ended the match when Seles lofted a lob past the 
baseline. Garrison won 11 of the last 12 points of the match. 
</P>
<P>
Seles shook hands with Garrison at the net and walked off, leaving her 
36-match, six-tournament winning streak on the court. 
</P>
<P>
Her reaction: "Oh, gee." 
</P>
<P>
But Seles, the 16-year-old French Open champion, could still remember how it 
felt to lose a match, even if she hadn't done it since mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, it's OK," Seles said. "But for 10 minutes, maybe it's a little 
difficult. Tomorrow it's probably better."

FEW RUNS, MANY HITS FOR ANGELS; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: THEY GET 15 HITS AND PUT RUNNERS ON BASE IN EIGHT INNINGS, BUT NOT 
ENOUGH SCORE IN 5-2 LOSS TO TORONTO. 
</P>

TORONTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They had men on base in every inning but the seventh, they tied a season-high 
by getting 15 hits and it still wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to work hard to do that," said first baseman Wally Joyner, who 
contributed two hits toward the dubious achievement pulled off by the Angels in 
their 5-2 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
How can 15 hits not be enough? When they are hits that move runners along 
instead of driving runners in. When they come with no one out or one out -- but 
not with two out, when they could unsettle the opposing pitcher and break the 
game open. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays opened the roof on the SkyDome Tuesday night but repeatedly 
closed the door on the Angels' efforts to concoct a big inning. Starting 
pitcher Todd Stottlemyre (9-7) yielded runs in the third and fourth innings but 
quashed potential sprees in both, striking out a season-high eight to help 
Toronto close within 3 1/2 games of the AL East-leading Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though guys were getting on base and getting good pitches to hit, when 
they had to get an out, we were getting breaking balls and forkballs, which are 
not easy to hit," Lance Parrish said after the Angels' seventh loss in their 
last 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
"Once we got a couple of guys on, they changed their pitching pattern and got 
the big out when they needed to. They made some really good pitches when they 
had to." 
</P>
<P>
The last time the Angels amassed 15 hits, they rolled past Milwaukee, 10-3, on 
May 26. Bert Blyleven was the starter that night -- as he was Tuesday -- but 
the results were vastly different. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven (7-5) said he made only one bad pitch, that to Tony Fernandez in the 
fifth inning, but that turned out to be one too many. Toronto chipped away for 
two runs in the third on two singles, a sacrifice and Junior Felix's two-run 
single. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays hit Blyleven hard in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Consecutive triples by Felix and Fernandez with one out accounted for the first 
fifth-inning run, and Kelly Gruber drove in the second with a grounder. 
Blyleven walked George Bell and gave up a single to Fred McGriff before 
yielding to Scott Bailes, who gave up a run-scoring double to John Olerud. 
</P>
<P>
In his last four starts, covering 22 1/3 innings, Blyleven has allowed 32 hits 
and has an earned-run average of 7.66. But neither he nor Manager Doug Rader 
was inclined to interpret trends or look beyond the obvious Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The pitches to Lee and Felix were good pitches. On Felix's triple, it was a 
fastball I wanted in and I got it in," Blyleven said. "The only bad pitch I 
thought I made was to Fernandez when he hit that triple down the (right-field) 
line. Gruber hit a ground ball. . . . Nobody likes to lose." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly not Rader. "There's no sense in over-analyzing things," he said. "We 
didn't make the pitches when we had to, and we didn't get the base hits when we 
had to. It's as simple as that." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels could have complicated things for Stottlemyre in the early going. 
After Johnny Ray doubled in the third inning -- the second hit in his 
four-for-five night -- and Joyner and Dave Winfield singled, Stottlemyre 
retired Max Venable on a fly to left field and struck out Parrish. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth inning, after Luis Polonia's double scored Jack Howell, 
Stottlemyre induced Ray to pop up to third baseman Gruber in foul territory. He 
walked Joyner but struck out Winfield on a nasty breaking ball. 
</P>
<P>
"He threw me a bad one on the first pitch, and I was still mad at myself for 
swinging at it," Winfield said. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels left 13 runners on base and were hitless in five attempts with 
runners in scoring position and two out. With every missed scoring opportunity, 
their chances of challenging in the AL West recede. Their loss Tuesday left 
them 11 1/2 games out, two games short of the halfway point of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just a frustrating period for us. It's been frustrating all year," 
Parrish said. "We've never really been able to get on track and play the way we 
were expected to. One thing or another beats us or we beat ourselves. We're 
going to slowly slip out of this race unless we get things going. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like we were one hit away tonight. Every time we'd get an inning 
going, we were one hit away from busting things open. We just weren't able to 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
Or, as Joyner saw it, they weren't allowed to do it. They got five hits off 
Frank Wills, who relieved Stottlemyre for the sixth inning, but Toronto turned 
two double plays to minimize those threats. A single by Ray and an 
opposite-field double by Joyner put runners on second and third in the ninth 
inning, but Tom Henke came in to retire Winfield on a pop in foul territory 
behind first, Venable on a pop to short and Parrish on a grounder to third. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not so much we didn't get timely hits as they got the out when they 
needed it," Joyner said. "Johnny Ray had a great night, but the only time he 
needed a hit he didn't get it (in the fourth inning). I'm sure he would have 
traded a couple of those hits for a hit in that at-bat." 
</P>
<P>
That option wasn't available to him. "Getting 15 hits and losing is kind of 
hard to do," Parrish said, "but we've been doing a lot of things that don't 
seem easy." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Chili Davis was scratched from Tuesday's lineup during batting practice after 
he developed back spasms during his pregame jog. He was scheduled to start as 
the designated hitter. Luis Polonia became the DH and Max Venable was inserted 
as the left fielder. Davis' status is day to day. The lineup was the Angels' 
78th in 79 games. 
</P>
<P>
Infielder Donnie Hill's bruised left foot improved enough Tuesday for him to 
forgo X-rays, but it was too swollen for him to play. Hill injured the foot 
when he fouled a ball off it in the seventh inning Monday at Cleveland. It was 
initially placed in a cast, but that was removed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's feeling better but it's still sore and swollen all around," he said. He's 
expected to be idled for a few days, according to trainer Ned Bergert. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays set a major league record Tuesday by exceeding 2 million in 
attendance in their 42nd home date. The sellout crowd of 49,836 -- their 22nd 
consecutive sellout -- left them at 2,039,644. The 1982 Dodgers held the 
previous record by reaching 2 million in 44 dates.

NAPLES, Italy 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
See Naples and cry. 
</P>
<P>
That was the sad epitaph to Italy's World Cup dreams written on the field of 
San Paolo Stadium Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Argentina, the defending world champion, ousted Italy from the tournament, 
throwing an entire country into severe depression. 
</P>
<P>
For six years, Italians have dreamed of seeing their beloved Azzurri win the 
World Cup for a record fourth time. 
</P>
<P>
For almost four weeks, the nation has charted the fortunes of every player, 
delighting in the goals of Salvatore Schillaci, replaying the dazzling moves of 
Giuseppe Giannini, analyzing every word spoken by Coach Azeglio Vicini. 
</P>
<P>
In bars and restaurants and piazzas across the land, Italians have danced and 
sung and cheered the team's every success. Italy seemed invincible. It won five 
times. It had not allowed a goal. It was one step away from the championship 
game in Rome on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday night, before a stunned and disbelieving crowd of 59,978, it 
fell to Argentina, losing a classic semifinal match on penalty kicks after two 
hours of regulation play and extra time ended with the score deadlocked at 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
The hero for Argentina was not Diego Maradona. It was Sergio Goycochea, the 
team's backup goalkeeper who has been playing only because Nery Pumpido, the 
starting goalkeeper, broke his leg in a first-round game against the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
Each team had made three penalty kicks when Italy's Roberto Donadoni stepped up 
to take his. He struck the ball cleanly and hard, aiming for the top right-hand 
corner of the net. Goycochea guessed correctly, flung himself across the goal 
and blocked the shot. 
</P>
<P>
Donadoni sadly trudged back to his teammates sprawled on the ground at 
midfield. Roberto Baggio, the $13-million star whom Vicini inexplicably chose 
not to start, walked over and consoled him. 
</P>
<P>
Maradona was next. He easily beat Walter Zenga, the Italian goalkeeper who had 
not given up a goal for a World Cup-record 517 minutes before Claudio Caniggia 
beat him with a header in the second half to tie the score. Schillaci had put 
Italy in front in the 17th minute. 
</P>
<P>
With Argentina leading, 4-3, on penalty kicks, it meant that the next Italian 
player, Aldo Serena, would have to make his kick and Zenga would have to save 
the fifth Argentine shot for Italy to stay alive. 
</P>
<P>
But Goycochea, perhaps inspired by his previous save, denied Serena, too, and 
it was over. 
</P>
<P>
"Some goalkeepers have better intuition than others," Goycochea said. "I don't 
think saving penalties is just a matter of luck." 
</P>
<P>
Argentina's players and coaches could hardly believe their luck. The team 
barely survived the first round, finishing behind Cameroon and Romania and 
barely advancing to the round of 16. It was totally outplayed by Brazil and 
somehow managed to salvage that game, 1-0. It went to penalty kicks against 
Yugoslavia in the quarterfinals, saw Maradona miss his, and yet still won. 
</P>
<P>
"We deserved to win," Argentine Coach Carlos Bilardo said. "We dominated play 
in midfield." 
</P>
<P>
Said Maradona: "I'm dreaming of an Argentina-England final. I'll give 
everything to win the World Cup because it's the last one I'll play in." 
</P>
<P>
Implausible as it seems, all that stands between Argentina and its chance to 
become the first team since Brazil in 1958-1962 to win consecutive World Cups 
is Sunday's match against the winner of tonight's West Germany-England 
semifinal in Turin. 
</P>
<P>
The Italians began confidently, stringing together passes, moving the ball from 
wing to wing and giving every indication that the goals would be just a matter 
of time. When Schillaci scored in the 17th minute, completing an intricate move 
that also involved Fernando De Napoli, Giannini and Gianluca Vialli, it 
appeared that it might be the first of several Italian goals. 
</P>
<P>
Goycochea did well to block Vialli's initial shot, but he had no chance at the 
rebound. Schillaci, lurking nearby for just such an opportunity, slammed the 
ball home from close range. It was his fifth World Cup goal, tying him with 
Czechoslovakia's Tomas Skuhravy as the tournament's top goal scorers. 
</P>
<P>
There was some question before the game whether Naples fans would cheer for 
Italy, their national team, or for Maradona and, by extension, Argentina, 
because Maradona plays for Napoli in the Italian league. The "I-tal-ia! 
I-tal-ia!' roar that followed the goal provided the answer. 
</P>
<P>
But, although it played attractive soccer, Italy failed to increase its lead. 
As the match wore on, Argentina got more and more into it and Vicini's 
agitation on the Italian bench increased. He finally sent Baggio into the game, 
and later Serena, but neither could provide the goal Italy so clearly needed to 
quell Argentina's mounting confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Caniggia got his goal in the 67th minute, when he out-jumped Zenga and three 
defenders and headed the ball into the opposite corner of the net. 
</P>
<P>
Argentina, down to 10 men after the expulsion of Ricardo Giusti in overtime, 
held on. When it went to penalty kicks, it was anyone's game. 
</P>
<P>
"We leave this World Cup adventure knowing we did everything we possibly could 
to reach the final," Vicini said. "We needed a little luck." 
</P>
<P>
In Rome, Italy was invincible. Farther south? 
</P>
<P>
See Naples and cry.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
THIS TIME, 13 HITS NOT ENOUGH FOR CHICAGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Chicago White Sox won a game Sunday without a hit, but they had 13 hits 
Tuesday night and were never in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Cecil Fielder and Lou Whitaker provided the power and the Detroit Tigers 
pounded the White Sox, 13-7, at Chicago to knock them out of first place in the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder, the major league leader in home runs and runs batted in, hit his 27th 
home run and drove in three runs to reach 70. Whitaker hit his 11th home run 
and a triple and drove in five runs. 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox won, 4-0, over the New York Yankees when errors did in Andy 
Hawkins, who held the White Sox without a hit. 
</P>
<P>
But Eric King (8-2), who has pitched brilliantly for the White Sox and had won 
four in a row, was no mystery to the Tigers. Whitaker's three-run home run 
capped a five-run fourth inning that put the Tigers ahead to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Carlton Fisk hit a home run for the White Sox, his 343rd. Fisk has hit 322 as a 
catcher, leaving him just five behind Johnny Bench, who hit the most home runs 
by a catcher. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Jeff Torborg of the White Sox shrugged off the defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"We were due for a night like this," he said. "It was Eric's turn. He had been 
going pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers won even though they made four errors, three of them by shortstop 
Alan Trammell. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the first time that ever happened to me," Trammell said. "I hope it's 
the last time, too. But you can put it behind you when the team wins anyhow." 
</P>
<P>
Trammell eased his pain with three hits. 
</P>
<P>
"Trammell shouldn't feel so bad," Fisk said. "I once saw Brooks Robinson make 
three errors in one game, and he's still the best third baseman I ever saw. Now 
I can tell my grandchildren I saw Trammell do it, too." 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 5, Milwaukee 0 -- Curt Young, who always pitches well against the 
Brewers, needed help from three relievers at Milwaukee to put the Athletics 
back into first place. 
</P>
<P>
Young (4-2) gave up six hits in 5 1/3 innings. Before the shutout was 
completed, Todd Burns, Rick Honeycutt and Gene Nelson also pitched. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Randolph, who has been in a slump almost from the time he was obtained 
from the Dodgers, paced the Athletics' attack. Randolph was three for three, 
including a double and triple, and drove in two runs. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 900th managerial victory for Tony LaRussa and gave the Athletics a 
one-game lead in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 7, Boston 3 -- Tom Brunansky, who has been providing plenty of punch 
in Boston's drive to the top of the East, was the goat at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Brunansky dropped Kirby Puckett's fly ball near the warning track with two out 
in the sixth inning, and the Twins responded with three runs to hand Roger 
Clemens (12-4) his second loss in his last three games. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Gaetti's triple was the big blow in the inning as the Twins built a 4-0 
lead for Kevin Tapani (9-5). 
</P>
<P>
Tapani had a shutout until the eighth and Rick Aguilera, although he gave up 
two runs in the ninth, picked up his 19th save. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens gave up seven hits and only one earned run in seven innings but struck 
out only three. 
</P>
<P>
With Toronto winning, Boston's lead was trimmed to 3 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 6, New York 1 -- Bo Jackson had three hits, including his 14th home 
run, and the Royals continued to beat up on the hapless Yankees at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals beat the last place club in the East, 11-5, Monday night. In both 
games the Yankees have been without their best player, Don Mattingly, who has 
an ailing back. 
</P>
<P>
Frank White had a single and double. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Farr (6-3), making just his third start after spending most of his career 
in the bullpen, was the winner. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 9, Seattle 4 -- Mitch Webster tripled home a run in the Indians' 
five-run first inning and added two RBI singles. 
</P>
<P>
The 13-hit attack helped Al Nipper win his second in a row. He gave up seven 
hits but only two earned runs in five innings. 
</P>
<P>
The first four Cleveland batters hit safely off Matt Young (2-9) and each of 
them scored. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 7, Baltimore 2 -- In his first two starts against the Orioles this 
season, Bobby Witt was 0-2 and had an earned-run average of 11.33. 
</P>
<P>
But in this game at Arlington, Texas, Witt (5-8) was superb. He struck out 
seven, gave up only six hits and one earned run in his first complete game of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Daugherty was three for four, with two doubles to lead the Ranger attack. 
</P>
<P>
Ben McDonald, the No. 1 pick in the 1989 draft, pitched two hitless innings for 
the Orioles. McDonald was called up from Rochester of the International League 
just before the game. DAN HAFNER

COCHELL LEAVES FULLERTON TO TAKE OKLAHOMA JOB; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASEBALL: TITAN COACH CITES FAMILY CONSIDERATIONS IN MOVING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The lure of Oklahoma proved too strong for Larry Cochell, who resigned as Cal 
State Fullerton's baseball coach Tuesday and took the coaching job at the 
University of Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
Cochell, 49, who guided the Titans to two College World Series appearances in 
three seasons, was at Oral Roberts University in Tulsa from 1977-86. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone knows I left a good job, but it was as much a family decision as it 
was a career decision," Cochell said at a news conference in Norman, Okla. 
"When my boys (sons Craig, 18, and Chad, 14) talked about home, they always 
meant Oklahoma. I like the people here." 
</P>
<P>
Cochell replaces Stan Meek, who coached on an interim basis last season after 
the retirement of Enos Semore. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of Cochell's contract were not disclosed. At Fullerton, Cochell's base 
salary of $63,000 was supplemented by income from summer baseball camps and a 
shoe contract. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't match what they were offering," said Steve DiTolla, Fullerton 
associate athletic director who oversees baseball. "Larry indicated that it was 
too good an offer to turn down. 
</P>
<P>
"He had nothing but good things to say about our program, and I don't think 
there was anything that drove him out of here. But I would assume Oklahoma has 
more resources to work with than we have here." 
</P>
<P>
DiTolla said the Fullerton job "is wide open at this point." The school will 
form a selection committee and will conduct a national search for a successor, 
DiTolla said. Could that someone be Augie Garrido, who built the Titans into a 
national power and won two College World Series championships before taking the 
Illinois job in 1987? Garrido's three-year contract with Illinois expires in 
August, and he has not negotiated a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
DiTolla wouldn't speculate but Garrido, who is in Austin, Tex., as a coach with 
Team U.S.A., didn't rule out the possibility. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see myself as a candidate, but if Fullerton does, I'm sure they'll get 
in touch with me," Garrido said. "And if they get in touch, we'll talk." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Hoover, who coached at Golden West College for 22 years before becoming a 
Titan assistant in 1989, said he was interested, as did George Horton, the 
Cerritos College coach who was a finalist for the Fullerton job in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Horton, who has led Cerritos to three state community college championships in 
the last five years, withdrew from the running in 1987 because of the job's 
fund-raising requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Other likely local candidates are Loyola Marymount Coach Chris Smith, who was 
an assistant at Fullerton in 1983 and '84; Cal State Northridge Coach Bill 
Kernan, a former Titan and Illinois assistant who took Northridge to the 
Division II national championship game last season; and Rancho Santiago College 
Coach Don Sneddon. 
</P>
<P>
Cochell, who has a 791-450-2 record in 24 years of coaching, went 109-68 in his 
three seasons at Fullerton. The Titans finished third in the College World 
Series in 1988 and lost their first two games in the 1990 series.

Mario Vazquez Rana, president of Pan American Sports Organization, said that 
U.S. television coverage of the 1991 Pan American games in Cuba could be 
arranged through Mexico or Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Vazquez Rana was reacting to a decision by a U.S. federal judge last Friday to 
uphold a U.S. government ban on plans by ABC to televise the games. 
</P>
<P>
The United States said the planned ABC coverage, which would have involved 
payments to Cuba, contravened a U.S. trade embargo imposed in 1961.

FINISHING 50TH KEEPS BAUER IN YELLOW JERSEY

MONT ST. MICHEL, France 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a day of protest and rain, calm and sunshine returned to the Tour de 
France on Tuesday. No sheep farmers protesting meat prices. No diversion. Just 
a flock of cyclists in the first mass sprint of the 77th running of the event. 
</P>
<P>
One thing remained unchanged. Canadian Steve Bauer retained the yellow jersey 
of the tour's leader when he finished 50th, but had the same time as the 
leader, in the fourth stage, a relatively flat 126-mile course from Nantes 
through Brittany to historic Mont St. Michel. He leads Frans Maassen of the 
Netherlands by 12 seconds and Ronan Pensec of France by 30. 
</P>
<P>
Belgium's Johan Museeuw won Tuesday's stage in 5 hours 23 minutes 33 seconds, 
but his victory was overshadowed by a tactical battle between archrivals Greg 
LeMond of Reno, Nev., and Laurent Fignon that raged throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
Fignon, a Frenchman who lost by eight seconds to LeMond in last year's race, 
was stopped by a massive pile-up eight miles from the finish and lost more than 
30 seconds to his American rival, who rode safely at the front of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very dangerous today because of the strong wind," said LeMond. "The 
only solution was to ride in front to avoid falls. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm nervous out there. It's dangerous to stay in the pack when we're all 
together like that. That's why I like to stay near the front." 
</P>
<P>
The fall occurred on a tight bend as Bauer and LeMond led the bunch at top 
speed toward the 11th-Century fortified rock off the French northwestern coast. 
</P>
<P>
The pack split, and despite a strong effort by his teammates, Fignon could not 
make up the lost time as the sprinters geared up for the surge to the line. 
</P>
<P>
Two-time champion LeMond, who finished 41st in Tuesday's stage, is 10:37 behind 
the leader in 24th place. 
</P>
<P>
Bauer, a 31-year-old from Fenwick, Canada, gained the lead after the first 
stage and maintained it in the second stage's team time trial. He finished 
Tuesday in the same time as Museeuw -- as did 48 others in a race with few 
breakaway attempts -- to underline conditioning that can help him maintain his 
lead through today's 188-mile fifth stage from Avrances to Rouen, the longest 
stage since the 1969 tour. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's stage started with a leisurely route through Brittany, from which 
five-time champion Bernard Hinault hails, and ended at Mont St. Michel, a 
picturesque abbey built on a rocky island in the middle of a bay. It was the 
first time since 1903 that the Tour de France has visited Mont St. Michel.

Larry Cochell of Cal State Fullerton accepted the job as baseball coach at 
Oklahoma on Tuesday and promised to make the Sooners competitive nationally. 
</P>
<P>
"If we do our job, there's no reason we can't compete with anyone," Cochell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cochell, 49, becomes the seventh baseball coach at Oklahoma. He replaces Stan 
Meek, who coached on an interim basis last year following the retirement of 
Enos Semore. 
</P>
<P>
The hiring must be approved by the university's regents. 
</P>
<P>
"Donnie Duncan has convinced me that the administration is committed to having 
a nationally ranked program," Cochell said. He said the university had the 
resources to make that happen. 
</P>
<P>
Cochell said his priorities as the Sooners' coach are to win the Big Eight 
Conference title, then the NCAA regional title and the national championship. 
He said he had no timetable for reaching those goals. 
</P>
<P>
He declined to comment on terms of the proposed contract with Cochell, other 
than to say it would be competitive with those of other baseball coaches 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Cochell is one of only four coaches to take teams from two schools to the NCAA 
College World Series. His teams from Cal State Fullerton and Oral Roberts 
University have made the trip. 
</P>
<P>
Cochell developed Oral Roberts into a national power during his tenure as head 
coach from 1977-86. Oral Roberts finished fifth in the College World Series in 
1978 and won more than 50 games in 1983 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
He was athletic director at the Tulsa school from 1983 to 1986, but lost that 
job to basketball coach Ted Owens at a time when Oral Roberts announced 
cutbacks in all sports but basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Cochell spent one year as coach of Northwestern University before leaving for 
Cal State Fullerton. The Titans finished second in the 1988 CWS in Cochell's 
first year there, and returned to the CWS this year, losing their first two 
games. 
</P>
<P>
His record as a coach is 791-450. 
</P>
<P>
Cochell said the decision to move from Southern California was as much a family 
decision as a career move. 
</P>
<P>
"We just like Oklahoma," he said. In addition, he said, his 18-year-old son 
plans to enroll at Oklahoma in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"This, we want to make our last stop after 25 years," he said, as his wife, 
Fran, nodded in agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Cochell said he didn't expect the style of baseball in Oklahoma to be different 
than that in California. He said he likes the Big Eight Conference. 
</P>
<P>
"When you talk about the Big Eight, these teams can play with anybody," Cochell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about replacing Meek, Cochell said, "I can't do anything about that. I'm 
head coach at the University of Oklahoma and I have to move on." 
</P>
<P>
Duncan said he and Meek met for more than 30 minutes Tuesday in a session he 
described as professional and businesslike. 
</P>
<P>
"We both expressed ourselves regarding everything that was on our minds," 
Duncan said. He said Meek would continue to be employed by the athletic 
department for some time. Meek's future involvement with the baseball program 
would have to be decided by Meek and Cochell, Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
The Sooners had reached the NCAA tournament six straight years until the 
retirement of Semore, the winningest coach in the Big Eight Conference with a 
22-year record of 851-370. 
</P>
<P>
Last year under Meek, the Sooners finished last in the Big Eight with a 9-15 
record, failing to make the conference tournament for the first time since 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
Meek had been the pitching coach at Oklahoma since 1976, during which time the 
Sooners' produced major league pitchers Jack Armstrong and Danny Jackson of 
Cincinnati and Bobby Witt of Texas.

MIKE PENNER: WOULD GARRIDO MAKE A RETURN ENGAGEMENT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Augie Garrido was on the phone, returning one of the dozen messages that 
awaited him Tuesday evening in his Austin, Tex., hotel room. As usual, his 
vocal cords were cranked to buzz-saw speed. 
</P>
<P>
"Just got back from Japan. TO-KEE-YO!" Garrido exclaimed. "We got our butts 
kicked. Lost four out of five to the Japanese collegiate champion. They're way 
ahead of us, lemme tell you. They're all 22, 23 years old and they play like 
their lives depend on it. Uncle Sam, glad to see ya. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we're playing the Mexican national team. We just drove from San Antonio to 
Austin in a bus, in 100-degree weather, with no air conditioning. We're ready 
for the Mexican national team." 
</P>
<P>
This is the man who preceded Larry Cochell as baseball coach at Cal State 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Ready for a return engagement? 
</P>
<P>
The timing surrounding Cochell's move to the University of Oklahoma is, to 
scratch the surface, very interesting. Garrido, winner of two national 
championships during his tenure at Fullerton, has been at Illinois three years 
-- or long enough to find that he gets no kick from Champaign. His contract 
with Illinois just expired. And ground-breaking for Fullerton's $8 million 
on-campus sports complex -- long just a twinkle in Garrido's eye -- is finally 
on the docket, officially scheduled for July 19. 
</P>
<P>
Garrido knew people weren't calling to wish him a safe and sane Fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a timely thing," Garrido had to admit. "And, things have changed. 
Fullerton has a new president coming in. Neale Stoner (the former Illinois 
athletic director who hired Garrido) went out. And I've been taking my share of 
abuse from being from California." 
</P>
<P>
Abuse? 
</P>
<P>
"It's mostly kidding," Garrido says, "but they tell me, 'You're from la-la 
land, where they have no value system.' They say, 'You're not a real man -- you 
don't know how to freeze and take it.' 
</P>
<P>
"I admit it. I bitch about the weather. I don't like the cold." 
</P>
<P>
Last time Garrido noticed, it was warm in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not looking to get out," he adds. "(But) an opportunity is an opportunity. 
I don't know if Fullerton sees me as something they want." 
</P>
<P>
False modesty doesn't become Garrido. Garrido is in Austin because he's 
coaching Team USA, the amateur baseball team that will represent the United 
States in the Goodwill Games. There's a reason Garrido was hired to coach Team 
USA. 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, Fullerton would hate to have Garrido return. Those trips to the College 
World Series are a real pain in the travel budget. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see myself as a candidate," Garrido says, stepping gingerly. "If 
Fullerton does, I'm sure they'll get in touch with me. And if they get in 
touch, we'll talk. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's leave it there for now." 
</P>
<P>
No doubt, a Garrido comeback would be lined with obstacles. First and foremost 
would be money; Garrido's salary package at Illinois, including income from 
summer camps and a shoe contract, is in the $100,000 neighborhood. The Titans 
live on the other side of the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's culture shock. Fullerton went from fire to ice when by-the-book 
Cochell replaced throw-away-the-book Garrido. It was like Tony Bennett filling 
in for Guns N' Roses. Bill Cosby following Eddie Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
Could Titan Athletic Director Ed Carroll properly brace himself for the 
reverse? 
</P>
<P>
Cochell always looked out of uniform at Fullerton. What, no khaki, no spit 
shine? Garrido always looked as if he had a half-dozen hot Rolexes up his 
sleeve. Cochell had his players dress like the Cincinnati Reds, stirrups pushed 
down to the ankle. Garrido's Titans swaggered in the garb of the New York Mets, 
orange and blue pinstripes blaring. 
</P>
<P>
Talk to both men. Ask Cochell about a losing pitcher and he'll say, "He didn't 
do too well -- but that's off the record." Ask Garrido about the go-ahead for 
the Fullerton sports complex, as a writer did Tuesday, and he'll say, "What, 
did they hire Moses to do the fund-raising?" Or tell Garrido that the school 
plans to add locker rooms and a drainage system after the complex is built. 
"Yeah, I know about this adding stuff," he says. " 'We'll start by adding bases 
. . . ' " 
</P>
<P>
It's a matter of style, but if Fullerton baseball has demonstrated anything, 
it's that style doesn't matter. The Titans won under Garrido and they won under 
Cochell. Cochell inherited the impossible act to follow -- he was Gene Bartow 
in spikes -- and he made it to Omaha twice in three years. 
</P>
<P>
Now Fullerton has to find someone capable of following Cochell. 
</P>
<P>
Garrido would fit the bill. He already has. Presently, he's negotiating a new 
contract with Illinois, but nothing has been signed. He claims, "I'm certainly 
happy at Illinois," but concedes that "any time a big-time job opens, it's 
going to draw your attention -- and Fullerton is a big-time program." 
</P>
<P>
Once upon a time, Garrido was the one who made it big-time. If Fullerton has 
any interest in having Garrido finish his work, it knows where to reach him.

AMERICAN LEGION NOTEBOOK / STEVE ELLING;

<P>
WEST RESERVE CASTILLO PLAYS A LEADING ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Woodland Hills West reserve Chris Castillo was having a quiet summer watching 
baseball and chewing sunflower seeds when he was thrust into the starting 
lineup for West's critical American Legion District 20 Western Division 
doubleheader with rival Woodland Hills East on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
But a dearth of at-bats for the outfielder is hardly breaking news. Last 
summer, Castillo was used primarily as a designated runner as West rolled 
through postseason play en route to a World Series title. 
</P>
<P>
An injury to a teammate opened the door for Castillo on Sunday, however, and he 
showed he is good for more than an occasional 90-foot dash and a headlong 
belly-flop into second. 
</P>
<P>
Castillo was three for four in the first game as West rallied from a four-run 
deficit to win, 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
Anybody for a repeat? Castillo was three for four in the second game as West 
(12-4 in district play) won behind right-hander Sean Boldt, 7-3, and moved to 
within striking range of Woodland Hills East (14-3) in the divisional 
standings. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I had a career day," said Castillo, an outfielder and recent graduate 
of El Camino Real High. 
</P>
<P>
Entering the game, Castillo had three hits in 17 at-bats for a .176 average, 
which he boosted to .360 in one afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Marine's corps: Woodland Hills West might need similar production from reserves 
this week. Starters Bobby Kim, Pat Treend, Jeff Marks and Jason Cohen are 
vacationing in Hawaii and West has five district games scheduled through 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, the old guard has been holding its own. West third baseman Del 
Marine was four for five in the two games against East and raised his batting 
average to .396. Marine appears to be in the same groove he found last summer, 
when his hot bat earned him the trophy as the 1989 national Legion player of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, a coach who saw Marine last year thinks he's playing at the same level 
this season. The Billings, Mont., team that West faced in the Northwest 
Regional playoffs last summer traveled to the Valley two weeks ago to play West 
in a series of interdistrict games. 
</P>
<P>
"Their coach said that in all his travels, Del might be the finest Legion 
player he's ever seen," West Coach Don Hornback said. 
</P>
<P>
Second add West: West, the defending Legion World Series champion, started 
district play with a 1-3 record -- surprising, considering that the team's 
cumulative district record in 1988 and '89 was a superlative 41-5. 
</P>
<P>
West (16-5 overall) had won 11 of its last 12 and nine in a row in district 
play. Coupled with the 21-3 record of El Camino Real High -- for which most of 
the Legion team played in the spring -- West has a combined mark of 37-8, a 
winning percentage of .822. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year at this time we were 12-3," said Hornback, West's third-base coach 
last summer. "When we lost three of our first four (this year), all I kept 
hearing was, 'What's wrong?' 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't getting bombed or embarrassed. We were in every game -- we just 
didn't win. I think we've played pretty well all year." 
</P>
<P>
Rising Sun: If the West/El Camino Real connection sounds daunting, the Sun 
Valley/Poly High record might really spin some heads. 
</P>
<P>
Sun Valley's team is composed primarily of players from Poly, which concluded 
its season at 22-4. Sun Valley holds the district's best record of 14-2 for a 
combined record of 36-6 (.857) this year. 
</P>
<P>
It seems as though a different player contributes each game. In Sun Valley's 
doubleheader sweep of Burbank on Sunday, infielder Marlon McKinney (3-0) tossed 
a one-hitter in a 6-0 victory in the opener and hit a grand slam to key an 8-7 
comeback in the second game. 
</P>
<P>
Rising son: If the name sounds familiar to Valley baseball aficionados, it 
should. Dave Snow coached at Valley College before moving on to Loyola 
Marymount and then to Cal State Long Beach, where he has built one of the most 
respected programs in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
His son Casey lives in Woodland Hills and played last season for the Crespi 
High junior varsity. Snow, who will be a sophomore in the fall, is a starter on 
the Encino-Crespi American Legion team. 
</P>
<P>
"He has great fundamentals, as you can well imagine," said Encino-Crespi Coach 
Scott Muckey, who also coaches the high school team. "He has an excellent arm 
for a kid his size -- he might even have the best arm on the team." 
</P>
<P>
Snow, 5-foot-7, is the likely successor to 1990 Crespi High graduate Mark 
Maurizi, a slick-fielding shortstop who signed a letter of intent with Notre 
Dame. 
</P>
<P>
"The way Casey's been playing, we may not even miss a beat there," Muckey said. 
</P>
<P>
Snow isn't Muckey's only youthful standout. Right-hander Jeff Suppan, who also 
will be a sophomore in the fall and pitched a no-hitter last season at Crespi 
High, allowed four hits, struck out 10 and walked two over seven innings in 
Encino-Crespi's 5-3 loss to first-place Woodland Hills East in a Western 
Division game Saturday. Suppan allowed two runs and was not involved in the 
decision.

AMERICAN LEGION ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
PICKOFF HELPS VAN NUYS EARN NOD OVER SUN VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a shake of the head, Van Nuys-Notre Dame pitcher Eric Vellozzi sent quite 
a tremor through the Sun Valley dugout in an American Legion District 20 
Eastern Division game Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
With runners on first and third, one out, and the score tied in the fourth 
inning, Vellozzi shook off a pitchout sign from Coach Jody Breeden. Instead, 
Vellozzi and catcher David Supple opted for a pickoff play at third. 
</P>
<P>
The play worked to perfection, Vellozzi escaped the jam and his teammates added 
a run in the bottom of the inning as Van Nuys-Notre Dame handed Sun Valley a 
2-1 defeat in a game at Poly High. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat was the second in 16 decisions for Eastern Division leader Sun 
Valley and kept alive the playoff hopes of Van Nuys-Notre Dame (10-6). 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys-Notre Dame took a 2-1 lead in the fourth when Vinnie Orlando singled 
and stole second. One out later, Eric Martorano beat out an infield single off 
the glove of Sun Valley pitcher Robert Flores. Glen Carson drove in Orlando 
with a sacrifice fly to center. 
</P>
<P>
In other District 20 games: 
</P>
<P>
West Hills 8, Newhall-Saugus 7 -- West Hills ended a 10-game losing streak by 
scoring three runs with the help of three Newhall-Saugus errors in a wild 
seventh inning at Chaminade High. 
</P>
<P>
After West Hills scored once in the seventh to come within 7-6, Aaron Weiss 
walked with one out and a runner at second. One out later, Mike Andry nubbed 
one in front of the plate. Newhall-Saugus catcher Steve Mann and reliever Oscar 
Silva bumped and Silva dropped the ball for an error. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Meyer -- who was at second -- stormed around third to score. Silva tried 
to gun down Weiss -- who was at first -- as he sped for third, but threw the 
ball into left field for another error and Weiss continued home with the 
game-winner for West Hills (6-13). 
</P>
<P>
Panorama City 4, Burbank 0 -- Roland De La Maza (3-2) threw a three-hitter, 
struck out seven and walked one at Monroe High. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Henson went two for two with a run-scoring single for Panorama City 
(12-5). 
</P>
<P>
Woodland Hills East 11, Chatsworth 1 -- Brett Reisner was four for four in a 
game at Taft High that was called after five innings because of the 10-run 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
Right-hander Chris Brown allowed four hits, struck out six and walked one for 
East (15-3) while teammate Jamie Zeichick had a home run and four RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills 9, Las Virgenes 6 -- David Cipolla had three hits and teammates 
Heath McElwee, Darryl Stroh and Robert Rundquist added two each.

CHARGERS HOPE PACE OF SIGNINGS WILL START TO PICK UP 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
With the start of Charger training camp 2 1/2 weeks away, the busiest people 
around pro football these days are expected to be the contract negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
Before the hitting can begin on the field, the number-crunching must be 
completed off it. The Chargers are no exception. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 27 of the team's 93 players are unsigned. That includes 12 veterans 
and 15 of 17 draft choices. Among the unsigned are inside linebacker Junior 
Seau, the Chargers' first-round draft choice from USC, and six starters from 
last season, including defensive leaders such as outside linebacker Leslie 
O'Neal, cornerback Gill Byrd and free safety Vencie Glenn. 
</P>
<P>
All of this means a busy time for General Manager Bobby Beathard and his staff 
leading up to the start of training camp at UC San Diego. Beathard is not 
necessarily expecting to sign all the players by the reporting dates -- July 20 
for rookies, July 27 for veterans -- but he said he does intend to get to as 
many as possible. No player is allowed to practice without a contract. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of cases will go down to the wire," Beathard said. "I hope it doesn't 
happen with ours. We would like each guy to get in on time, because it helps 
his chances of making the squad." 
</P>
<P>
But even with training camp this near, there appears little urgency on either 
side. Beathard is taking the week off, although he did say he would stay in 
touch by phone. And most of the agents representing unsigned Charger clients 
said it should be another week or so before talks become serious. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the word is that is the next word down from slow," Beathard said. 
"It's slower than slow. We have had a lot of conversations with the agents that 
represent these players; however, no one seems to want to make a move." 
</P>
<P>
Beathard said the problem is that agents are afraid to make a deal early for 
fear that another agent will come along later and make a better deal for a 
player drafted at about the same spot. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a difficult time finding player representatives that are willing to 
go out and make a deal," Beathard said. "They want the security of knowing 
other people have signed." 
</P>
<P>
Beathard said the deal process is more like "slotting" than negotiating. This 
is because the value of the contracts tends to fall directly in order of the 
position in which the player was drafted. Most players get a contract similar 
to what the player in that same drafted position received last year, plus a 
generally consistent percentage raise. 
</P>
<P>
For this reason, Beathard said he hopes the signing last week of outside 
linebacker Jeff Mills, their first of three picks in the third round, will help 
the Chargers in their dealings with their other third-round choices -- 
offensive tackle Leo Goeas of Hawaii and wide receiver Walter Wilson of East 
Carolina. Mills and wide receiver Elliott Searcy, the team's 12th-round choice, 
are the only two selections announced as signed. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard said the signing of Mills to a three-year contract plus an option year 
places a ceiling on how much the Chargers will spend on their other 
third-rounders. Asked if it was possible Goeas or Wilson would receive more 
than Mills, Beathard replied, "No way." 
</P>
<P>
Although the agents for Goeas and Wilson might receive some immediate 
attention, no agent figures to require more of Beathard's time over the next 
few weeks than Steve Feldman of Costa Mesa. Feldman represents four unsigned 
Chargers, all with high profiles: Seau, Byrd, Glenn and quarterback David 
Archer. 
</P>
<P>
The two have talked several times over the past few weeks, but both sides said 
they are not close to closing a deal. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing you can do except keep talking," Beathard said. 
</P>
<P>
But while Beathard bemoans the pace of the rookie signings, such agreements 
league-wide are running at about the same pace they were last season, according 
to the NFL Management Council. Twenty-seven draft choices have signed, compared 
to 23 by last July 1. But only seven of those players are in the top four 
rounds and two -- first-rounders Jeff George of Indianpolis and Mark Carrier of 
Chicago -- had agreed to terms by draft day. 
</P>
<P>
About the best news for the Chargers is that their large number of unsigned 
players has them well below the league roster limit of 80 signed players. Once 
the Chargers reached 80 signed players, they will have to make cuts. But with 
only 66 players announced as having signed, that likely will not happen before 
camp opens for rookies. 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers will take two trips away from their UC San Diego base before the 
start of their four-game exhibition schedule Aug. 11 against Dallas at San 
Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. The Chargers will travel to the Rams' camp for a 
scrimmage July 26 and spend Aug. 2-4 training with the Phoenix Cardinals at 
their camp in Flagstaff, Ariz.

JAMES FLANIGAN: TO HIKE INCOME, U.S. MUST INVEST IN YOUNG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Are you better off this Fourth of July than on past Independence Days? 
</P>
<P>
That question or something like it is at the heart of today's most important 
political debate: Whether American living standards are declining and what to 
do about it. 
</P>
<P>
By one measure, average personal income, the answer is easy -- at $4.6 
trillion, or $19,308 for each American, personal income is higher than ever. 
But such national averages only say the pie got bigger -- not how the pieces 
were distributed. 
</P>
<P>
And the Labor Department's figures on average weekly earnings for American 
workers paint a different picture -- showing that U.S. workers' average weekly 
earnings are 2% less today than they were 10 years ago and 11% less than 20 
years ago, after adjusting for inflation. Work weeks are shorter these days, 
but hourly wages tell the same tale. 
</P>
<P>
What's going on? Some say the pie is too small. "Real incomes are declining 
because the country has not had the economic growth it needs," says Sen. Daniel 
P. Moynihan (D-N.Y.). He advocates cutting Social Security payroll taxes to put 
money in working people's pockets and spur the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Others say some people are grabbing an unequal share. The rich are getting 
richer and the poor poorer, writes author Kevin Phillips in "The Politics of 
Rich and Poor," a new book that is captivating Washington. Phillips, who says 
Reagan Administration policies in the 1980s favored the rich, advocates 
redistributing the gains of the '80s by taxing the wealthy and regulating 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
It's a hot issue, and the debate's outcome could influence tax policy and 
change the direction of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
So it's important to understand that what's really happening in the economy is 
more complex than simple divisions between rich and poor. The wage figures, for 
example, say America has changed -- but not necessarily declined. Average wages 
are lower because more women came into the work force the last 20 years, as 
well as more young people, doing more part-time work. That's why wages look 
better in the distant past. "The further back you go, the more you are dealing 
with a work force of adult male full-time (and often unionized) workers," says 
Paul Flaim, analyst at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, income gaps reflect changes in family patterns -- more single-person 
families and families headed by single women. More than half the poverty-level 
families in America are headed by single women -- double the number of such 
households in 1959, says a report by the Congressional Budget Office. 
</P>
<P>
Rich and poor? The difference is often between old and young. The elderly 
benefitted in the last dozen years, as deregulated banks paid higher interest 
to savings depositors -- but charged the young more for mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
The inflation-adjusted median income of all families has risen 20% from 1970, 
but the incomes of elderly families -- near the poverty level 20 years ago -- 
have risen more than twice as much. 
</P>
<P>
But, of course, achieving a more secure retirement for America's elderly is a 
victory for the economy, not a problem. In fact, retirement income was the 
focus of the really big winners of the 1980s -- the pension funds. 
</P>
<P>
In a decade known for Wall Street deal makers, and inside traders, the big 
pension funds earned average returns of 14% a year -- which means they doubled 
their assets every five years. It was a needed change from the 1970s, when 
investment returns were inadequate. So, who was behind the merger mania, 
leveraged buyouts and short-term corporate focus of the 1980s? Clearly the 
pension funds, demanding a higher return on retirement-savings investments. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, wage gains of ordinary workers failed to keep up with inflation as 
America learned that its work force is subject to the world market. 
</P>
<P>
The time is past when high school graduates, or even dropouts, could get plenty 
of high-paying jobs in Detroit auto plants. Americans long ago accepted cars 
imported from Japan, or Japanese cars made in Ohio, Tennessee and Kentucky, 
where wages are lower than Detroit. Americans also bought clothing from Taiwan 
and Hong Kong in Sears and K Mart. 
</P>
<P>
So where do we go from here? Clearly, to prepare U.S. workers for fields where 
the highest wages are available. And that is in high technology, industries 
spending heavily on research and development, according to a new Monthly Labor 
Review study by W. Norton Grubb of UC Berkeley and Robert H. Wilson of the 
University of Texas in Austin. Such industries pay the best wages not simply to 
scientists and engineers but to all workers. 
</P>
<P>
But advanced industries demand investment of capital and skilled employees, 
which means that the United States needs educated workers and capital at low 
interest rates, rather than workers at low wages. Indeed, even in the overall 
wage decline of the 1980s there was a divergence between rising pay for skilled 
workers and sharply falling income for the unskilled. Education earned a larger 
slice of pie. 
</P>
<P>
So the direction of U.S. policy is obvious: It needs to make some new 
investments in the young. And that argues for policies to spur economic growth 
and make the pie larger, rather than redistribute gains of the past.

CHRYSLER GIVES STOCK OPTIONS TO MANAGERS; 
</P>
<P>
COMPENSATION: THE NO. 3 AUTO MAKER IS TRYING TO PREVENT A REPEAT OF RECENT 
DEFECTIONS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Chrysler Corp., which has lost a number of key executives in recent months, has 
given some top managers stock options to keep their compensation packages 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 3 auto maker said it granted the options last week to about 1,800 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
"People were moving on because their package was noncompetitive," spokesman Lee 
Sechler said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Since May 1, Gerald Greenwald has quit as Chrysler's vice chairman and Michael 
Hammes as its vice president for international operations. Vice President and 
Treasurer Frederick Zuckerman is expected to leave this summer and Chrysler 
Motors Chairman Bennett Bidwell expected to take early retirement at the end of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Chrysler is in the middle of a $1.5-billion cost-cutting program 
that has resulted in 2,500 salaried employees leaving or retiring early. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials declined to reveal the number of options granted or their 
price. Chrysler stock closed Monday at $15.50, down 25 cents in New York Stock 
Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
The United Auto Workers union criticized the options. 
</P>
<P>
"This violates the spirit of camaraderie and the sharing effort that they've 
been talking about," said Aaron Taylor, president of UAW Local 7, which 
represents laid-off workers at the company's closed Jefferson Avenue assembly 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
"When the company is in a downward-spiraling mode, they're still rewarding 
executives," he said. "It leaves a bad taste in the workers' mouths."

A roundup of business developments spotted by other publications. 
</P>
<P>
Mini-Venture: Texas Instruments and Sharp Electronics of Japan are designing a 
4 1/2-pound laptop computer that they will market, with slight variations, 
under different names. Sharp's version, the PC-6220, was introduced at trade 
shows last month. TI will manufacture not only the PC-6220 but its own version, 
the TI TravelMate 2000 Notebook PC, and versions that customers will sell under 
their own names. Industry watchers say the joint venture is an opportunity for 
TI to break into the computer business and will give the company a new market 
for its core business of integrated circuits. Dallas Morning News, Denver Post 
</P>
<P>
Brewer's Bonus: Miller Brewing Co. is reaching for more of the beer market by 
offering wholesalers 50 cents for every case of premium beer sold over company 
goals -- in addition to the $2 per case they usually make. The target is a 3% 
increase over last year's sales. Milwaukee Journal 
</P>
<P>
Florida Bound: The world is opening up, more people than ever are traveling and 
Florida expects a big piece of the action. Rockwell Schnabel, head of the 
Commerce Department's tourist and travel operations, said foreign travel to the 
United States should double by 2000. Florida has had 82% more foreign visitors 
since 1985, mostly from Europe and Japan. The next wave, expected to last 
through the decade, will come from Eastern Europe. St. Petersburg Times 
</P>
<P>
Spotting Theft: After a record loss to shoplifters of $25 billion last year, 
retailers are looking for new ways to deter thieves. One concept is a tag that 
squirts indelible ink onto a garment when improperly removed. Security Tag 
Systems of St. Petersburg, Fla., says it has sold 500,000 since production 
began last fall, and ColorTag of New York has sold more than 1 million since 
1988. Although ink tags are more expensive than electronic-alarm tags, they 
seem to be effective, reducing losses about 60% at the 40 Casual Corner stores 
testing them. Tampa Tribune 
</P>
<P>
Added Warning: In a move that caught the attention of several U.S. drug 
manufacturers, a Milwaukee law firm recently placed ads in the local paper 
about theophyllines, a family of drugs used to treat asthma and other lung 
diseases. In some cases these drugs have severe side effects, such as fever and 
seizures, if taken when a patient has influenza. A spokesman for 
Schering-Plough Corp., one of the makers of the drug, says its product "has 
been approved by the Food and Drug Administration and provides effective 
warnings about circumstances that can produce side effects." Milwaukee Journal

Toyota Model Passes a Milestone: Toyota Motor Corp. said its Corolla has passed 
Ford's Model-T to become the second best-selling car in history. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 15,040,200 Corollas were made in the 23 years and six months ended 
June 30. That tops the 15,007,033 Model-T cars made by Ford Motor Co. between 
1908 and 1927. But Toyota acknowledges the Volkswagen Beetle as the 
best-selling vehicle of all time, with 20,751,070 Beetles produced since it was 
introduced in 1938.

Price Stern Sloan Decides Against Sale: Price Stern Sloan Inc. announced that 
after an extensive evaluation of financing and strategic alternatives, it has 
determined that a sale of the company at this time would not be in the best 
interest of shareholders and that it will no longer pursue that alternative. 
Price Stern Sloan said it will consider the sale of certain assets to reduce 
its debt load and other opportunities that have been presented. Although 
results are expected to be improved over those of 1989, the company will not 
report a profit for the first six months, which traditionally is a loss period.

Pickens Vows to Hike Koito Stake: Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens Jr. said he 
will move quickly to boost his stake in Koito Manufacturing Co. to 33% from 
26%, despite another defeat of his attempt to gain seats on the board of the 
Japanese auto parts maker. Pickens, who lost his bid to secure four board seats 
at Koito's annual stockholders meeting in Tokyo last week, said he plans to buy 
more Koito stock that could cost him an additional $160 million at about $20 a 
share. By increasing his stake to 33%, Pickens said he would, under Japanese 
law, be allowed participate in decisions made by management.

US Sprint, MCI Seek Continued Regulation of AT&amp;T: The two rivals asked the 
Federal Communications Commission to continue regulating American Telephone 
&amp; Telegraph Co., which they charged with dominating the telecommunications 
market. For its part, AT&amp;T told the FCC that because the long-distance 
market is "vigorously competitive," it is time for the same rules to apply to 
all long-distance companies. The FCC proposed in March to deregulate some 
segments of AT&amp;T's business and asked for comments from the other 
telecommunications companies, which were presented Tuesday.

Ruling on Drug: The Illinois Supreme Court ruled that companies that 
manufactured the suspected cancer-causing drug DES cannot be forced to pay 
damages to "DES daughters" who do not know what company manufactured the DES 
their mothers took. Justices ruled in the case of a Chicago woman who 
contracted cervical cancer and sued Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly &amp; Co. and 
several other makers of the controversial drug diethlystilbestrol, a synthetic 
female hormone. Studies show daughters of pregnant women who often took the 
drug to prevent miscarriage from the 1940s to the 1960s had a higher incidence 
of cervical cancer.

SELECTED BUYING IN BLUE CHIPS ADDS 12 TO DOW

<P>
Stock prices rose Tuesday as buying in certain blue chip issues outweighed, at 
least for now, concerns that corporate earnings for the second quarter will be 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, which rose 18.57 points on Monday, added 
another 12.37 to close at 2,911.63. 
</P>
<P>
Trading was slow on the eve of the Fourth of July holiday, with Big Board 
volume totaling 130 million shares traded, down slightly from Monday's 130.20 
million. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. financial markets will be closed today. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow has risen in each of the past five sessions, and Tuesday's close marked 
the first time that the index has finished above 2,900 since June 21. The 
record Dow close was set June 15 at 2,935.89. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about eight to seven in nationwide 
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 834 up, 650 down and 503 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
The market appeared to shrug aside the Commerce Department's report that orders 
to factories for manufactured goods rose 2.1% in May, offsetting a revised 2.1% 
decline the previous month. The rise was widely expected. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Morris was the most active NYSE issue, rising 7/8 to 48, a new 52-week 
high. Other Dow component stocks that helped power the rise: Woolworth, up 1 to 
34 1/8 and Primerica, up 3/4 to 35 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
High-tech stocks were mixed. Among Southland-based issues, electronics 
distributor Bell Industries jumped 1 1/8 to 17 3/4, and personal computer maker 
Tandon Corp. rocketed 7/16 to 3 3/4 in heavy trading. 
</P>
<P>
But Mentor Graphic plunged 4 3/8 to 17 5/8 after projecting lower-than-expected 
second-quarter earnings. And Santa Barbara-based Digital Sound lost 1/2 to 4 
1/2 after tumbling 4 1/4 Monday, on news that the voicemail equipment firm 
expects a second-quarter loss. 
</P>
<P>
Despite general earnings worries, many growth stocks continued to advance as 
investors hunted for companies whose businesses remain on track. K Swiss jumped 
2 to 25, Dreyer's Ice Cream rose 1 1/8 to 41 7/8, Diagnostic Products gained 2 
to 38 1/4 and Waste Management added 1 to 42 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, a stronger yen boosted shares to a higher close but there was 
scattered buying of the cash indexes and some high-technology blue chip stocks. 
The 225-share Nikkei average was up 254.37 points to 32,414.60. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks recovered ground late in the session to finish little changed on the 
London Stock Exchange. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-index finished 
0.3 point lower at 2,371.7. 
</P>
<P>
Domestic investors scrambled to take profits after foreign buying on boosted 
share prices nearly 2% in West Germany. The 30-share DAX index closed 9.07 
points lower at 1,906.23.

Gold futures prices advanced for the fifth straight day on New York's Commodity 
Exchange in light trading stimulated by South African labor tensions and talk 
of buying interest from the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, coffee futures advanced while energy futures, 
livestock and meat futures and grain and soybean futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Trading in most markets featured late position-squaring ahead of the holiday, 
which tended to flatten out price changes. 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures settled $3.30 to $3.50 higher, with the contract for delivery in 
July at $362.10 an ounce and the most-active August contract at $364.10.

Silver futures finished 1.6 cents to 2 cents higher in New York, with July at

In London, the price of rhodium, a little-known but environmentally important 
precious metal, soared by $1,000 to an all-time high of $7,000 an ounce

<P>
Similar in color to aluminum, it is a key ingredient in catalytic converters 
that change toxic car exhaust fumes into harmless gases. 
</P>
<P>
The price explosion has been fired up this year by a severe supply shortage. 
Growing global pressure for legislation to reduce the level of nitric oxide 
from car exhausts is expected to keep demand for rhodium high, metal analysts 
said. And in a tight market, this will keep the price up.

The dollar ended mostly lower in quiet pre-holiday trading as the British pound 
continued to gain strength on worldwide markets. 
</P>
<P>
They attributed the dollar's decline partly to technical factors as well as 
sterling's strength. 
</P>
<P>
Demand for the British pound has increased in recent days amid widespread 
speculation that the currency would enter the European Monetary System's 
exchange rate mechanism. 
</P>
<P>
During a speech at London's Institute of Economic Affairs on Monday, Karl Otto 
Poehl, president of the German Bundesbank, said he expected Britain's entry 
into the mechanism soon.

<P>
Sterling rose to $1.7800 from $1.7635 in London, and to $1.7765 from $1.7715 in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
The German mark also gained against the dollar. The dollar fell to 1.6509 marks 
in Europe from 1.6580, and to 1.6505 from 1.6515 in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The mark has remained firm in foreign exchange following the monetary union in 
East and West Germany over the weekend.

Bond prices rose slightly in light pre-holiday trading. The Treasury's 
benchmark 30-year bond rose 5/32 point, or about $1.60 per $1,000 face amount. 
</P>
<P>
Its yield fell to 8.38% from 8.40% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Market participants shrugged off government announcements that a large supply 
of bonds would be sold into the market. Concerns that abundant supplies will 
depress prices have been on traders' minds for weeks.

Resolution Trust Corp., the government agency in charge of bailing out the 
savings and loan industry, said it would sell $5 billion of 30-year bonds on 
July 10.

Kathleen Camilli, chief economist for Ramirez Capital Consultants Inc., said 
fears of oversupply in the market have been "overridden by expectations that

IT'S THE HOTTEST STRIP ON SUNSET

<P>
Some people consider Sunset Plaza -- a pocket of classy shops and intriguing 
outdoor cafes along Sunset Boulevard -- one of the best kept secrets in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Madeleine Gallay, who opened an upscale boutique there two years ago (opposite 
an equally upscale boutique owned by her ex-husband, Charles Gallay), is 
convinced "many tourists know Rodeo Drive, they know Melrose Avenue, they even 
know La Brea Avenue. But they don't know Sunset Plaza. This is not a 
high-profile place." Pausing, she then added: "Maybe we should keep it that 
way." 
</P>
<P>
But it's too late to keep Sunset Plaza under wraps. Over the past few years, 
the tiny section of West Hollywood, loosely defined by Le Dome restaurant at 
the west end and the Sunset Travel agency at the east, has dropped its 
conservative tone and become a hip, happening place with a strong European 
flavor. Gallay and many of her neighbors, all dealing in high-ticket 
merchandise and services, say the catalyst for change was Chin Chin -- a 
streamlined cafe specializing in inexpensive Asian dishes (average check: $6 
per person) and a generous cluster of outdoor tables. 
</P>
<P>
When Chin Chin opened in 1983, "it anchored this area and made everything else 
happen," says Gallay, who remembers Sunset Plaza from her childhood and recalls 
that "before Chin Chin, this was a stodgy place. It wasn't all that much fun to 
come up here." 
</P>
<P>
Now the good times roll, and a first-time visitor is instantly struck by the 
unique charm of the plaza, with its Georgian architecture, well-tended flowers 
and shrubs, and the masses of free parking behind the shops on each side of the 
street. Windows -- artfully decorated with anything from a glistening tuba in 
Butler &amp; Wilson (London-based purveyors of unusual costume jewelry) to 
lavish trousseau items at Lisa Norman -- beckon. But everything pales in 
comparison to the incessant parade of beautiful people who come to "park, eat, 
shop and enjoy the personal service," as one tenant describes it. 
</P>
<P>
Retailers describe a sophisticated, affluent clientele with ties to the 
entertainment industry and strong fashion convictions. They arrive in person, 
send a staff member or telephone to purchase entire wardrobes in a single 
swoop. 
</P>
<P>
Ole Henriksen, whose Danish skin-care salon is adjacent to Mark Piscitelli's 
traditional men's wear store, relates a scene that could happen anywhere along 
Sunset Plaza: "People park and load their cars with (Piscitelli's) merchandise. 
He has a very strong following." 
</P>
<P>
Henriksen's own following changed after he moved to the area from Beverly Hills 
nine years ago. "It's more of an international clientele, and I have a feeling 
a lot of that is based on the location," he says. Included in the roster are 
foreign models who stay in nearby hotels, such as the Sunset Marquis. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the ritzy aura, Sunset Plaza "is not snobby," Henriksen says. He 
recommends Sunday brunch at Le Petit Four, the outdoor cafe populated by an 
international crowd: "It's a fashion parade. You see the latest and hear every 
language under the sun." 
</P>
<P>
But the true language of the street is money: making it (as in power lunches at 
Le Dome), having it and spending it freely. Indicative of prices in the area, a 
hair cut by Joe Torrenueva, celebrity barber and owner of Torrenueva, is $115. 
Down the street at Jack Kellog, where the customer is described as "a self-made 
man -- agents, producers, directors," a butter-soft Italian suede jacket runs 
$1,150. And farther down at Gallay, the prices for avant-garde fantasies for 
women climb from $100 for an Isaia belt to $4,000 for an evening dress by Romeo 
Gigli. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street in English-style Rosenthal Truitt, there are men's 
furnishings and gift items, such as exclusive wood frames with sterling-silver 
trims for $315, or a rare wood-and-brass shoeshine box for $385. Nearby, in 
Bloomers for Kids, the predominantly European merchandise (Kenzo, Gianni 
Versace, Franco Moschino) includes a tiny tot's high-fashion jumpsuit for $115. 
</P>
<P>
Each establishment has its own personality, its own slant on fashion or beauty. 
For years, women have climbed the marble stairs to Jessica's Nail Clinic to be 
pampered in the pink and blue salon, where a pedicure or manicure now costs 
$22. For many, the next "salon" stop is Eleanor Keeshan, a plaza staple since 
1970 that specializes in such well-known international designers as Escada, 
Emanuel Ungaro, Donna Karan and Louis Feraud 
</P>
<P>
Within the gallery-like confines of Oliver Peoples Opticians, the specialty is 
classic frames designed on the premises. At M Gallery, it is modern jewelry 
created by owner Michael Dawkins. And at Joan Vass, it is the New York 
designer's interpretation of cotton separates, hand-knit sweaters and 
understated evening wear. 
</P>
<P>
Sunset Plaza's 40 or so tenants exist in a happy-hamlet atmosphere. They speak 
well of each other; they have kind words for their landlord, the Montgomery 
Management Company. But there is a bone of contention: Those with shops on the 
south side of the street (and scenic back-window views of West Hollywood) 
believe they have the best of all worlds. Nicky Butler, for example, claims his 
establishment, Butler &amp; Wilson, is "on the right side of the street." And 
neighbor Madeleine Gallay says she crosses to the north side only to get a 
facial at Ole Henriksen. 
</P>
<P>
Francis J. Montgomery, whose family has owned Sunset Plaza since 1891, chuckles 
over the dissension and thinks it is based on an old real estate notion that 
"stores on the south side do better than ones on the north side." 
</P>
<P>
And while virtually every tenant, north and south, says Sunset Plaza is better 
today than ever, Montgomery remembers it was always a special place. "I was a 
little boy when we moved here from Santa Monica in 1920. This whole area was 
our front yard," he recalls. "Our family home was up on the hill and all this 
was poinsettia fields."

EXTENDED SERVICE REQUIRES STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SIMROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beware, consumers: If you're considering buying an extended service contract 
for your vehicle, be sure the company offering that policy to cover its parts 
and repairs, over and above normal factory warranties, has a long, solid track 
record. 
</P>
<P>
A little homework on service contracts -- which cost $400 to $1,200 depending 
on the kind of vehicle, its age, mileage and the length of the policy -- can 
save motorists headaches, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, dealers offer two kinds of extended service contracts, those 
administered through independent companies and those from the auto 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
With the independents' contracts, motorists often get added benefits, besides 
coverage for mechanical breakdowns and parts. For example, such packages might 
cover fees for towing and rentals or even hotel costs if you're on vacation and 
your vehicle needs extensive repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers, on the other hand, are more conservative about what they cover 
in service contracts. But the chief benefit they offer is that motorists need 
not worry about a major business like General Motors, Ford or Chrysler going 
under. 
</P>
<P>
That is not to say that there are problems, necessarily, with all independents, 
who do more than $3.5 billion in annual sales nationwide. But since 1988, 15 
such firms have gone out of business, leaving their insurers, vehicle dealers 
and consumers to sort out who will pay for parts and repairs that the 
companies' extended service contracts were supposed to cover. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers can protect themselves, in advance, by investigating how long a firm 
has been in business and what insurer underwrites its claims, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
In most states, service contracts, although underwritten by insurers, legally 
are considered deals between consumers and auto dealers. That means that if 
consumers run afoul of an independent, their state's insurance department 
usually can't help much; the contracts are not considered an insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
In California, for example, "The Department of Insurance will qualify that the 
insurance company backing the policy has reserves to handle them and is 
licensed in California, but they don't (vouch for) the product," said Joe 
Remoaldo, a consultant who evaluates service contracts for dealers and 
consumers. "So, the dealer is hoodwinked into believing he's protected by 
insurance and he's not in some cases. And the consumer has nowhere to go, 
except to have it decided in court. There should be better regulation." 
</P>
<P>
(Although the problem is not legally within its jurisdiction, the California 
insurance department, because of the volume of complaints it has received, is 
trying to assist consumers by mediating consumer-insurer disputes, a spokesman 
said.) 
</P>
<P>
David Wilson, owner of Toyota of Orange, called his experience with 
independents "a nightmare." When he bought his Orange County dealership in 
1983, it did business, he said, with an independent that folded in 1985. He had 
further complaints about three other independents, which he claimed harassed 
customers who had policies with them or failed to reimburse him for repair 
work. The firms, he said, later went out of business, too. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said his dealership lost $1 million on repairs for which it was never 
reimbursed. "That's really terrible," he said, "but no customer ever lost any 
money." 
</P>
<P>
He now offers customers only factory-sponsored extended service contracts. 
(Toyota began offering the agreements in 1987.) 
</P>
<P>
"If consumers do business with a reputable dealer and a reputable manufacturer, 
I don't think they'll have any problem," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Wilson, the owner of Casa de Cadillac in Sherman Oaks who deals only with 
General Motors-sponsored service contracts, agreed, saying: "If you buy (an 
agreement) backed up by the manufacturer, you're going to be OK. Some 
independents may be OK, but the manufacturers are more solid. 
</P>
<P>
"The service contract business is really complex," Wilson added. "But they're 
not as important as they used to be when manufacturers offered warranties of 12 
months or 12,000 miles. Now they're offering tremendous warranties, five years 
or 50,000. I don't think, with those kinds of factory warranties, you need a 
extended service contract unless you drive a tremendous amount of miles or keep 
a car a long time." 
</P>
<P>
That some dealers prefer manufacturer contracts over independents is no small 
matter. Consider that they actually lose money on such agreements because 
manufacturers pay them flat factory rates on repairs, not the consumer price 
they receive from independents and consumers. If, for example, a mechanic 
spends two hours replacing a car's master cylinder, a manufacturer pays a 
dealer for only 1.2 hours; independents and consumers, in contrast, pay the 
regular rate, about $30 to $32 an hour, for the full two hours. 
</P>
<P>
Independents do have their defenders. Said Remoaldo: "I believe the independent 
. . . provides a valuable and needed product. Unfortunately, they are going 
through a down cycle now due to the pressure from the manufacturers' programs 
and the influx of unethical individuals. The latter could be controlled if only 
the government regulatory agencies take greater interest." 
</P>
<P>
Bud Barish, of Barish Chrysler on La Brea Avenue, observed: "There are still a 
number of very, very good independent companies that are solid and still doing 
business. But there were plenty with a bad reputation. Either they were 
self-insured and went broke or the insurance company backing them sustained too 
many losses and decided to get out of the business." 
</P>
<P>
Barish, a dealer for 41 years, switched service contracts to Chrysler 
exclusively. "We still have some of those (independent) contracts, and they're 
hard to deal with," he said. "Some of the companies are being very technical on 
what it is they'll pay for." 
</P>
<P>
The manufacturers' entry into the service contract business in the mid-'80s, 
posed "a challenge to the independents, no question about that," said Julie 
Fosgate Heggli, senior vice president of marketing for General Warranty Corp. 
The Harbor City firm is one of the nation's largest administrators of vehicle 
service contracts. "But it's like any other product; it's probably healthier 
all around to have tough competition. We just have to be creative and come up 
with something better than (manufacturers) do." 
</P>
<P>
Heggli said General Warranty, in business since 1981, was the first in the 
industry to offer towing and rental benefits. Besides normal service coverages 
on mechanicals and parts, she said, it also is "offering things that are 
secondary concerns to drivers." Coverages that include trip interruption, added 
coverage for meals and lodging, a one-year membership to the AMOCO auto club. 
</P>
<P>
"A year ago," she added, "we started a Smart Buyer Club that gives special 
discounts on an oil change at the dealer where you purchased your car, hotel 
discounts, that kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
VEHICLE SERVICE CONTRACT TIPS 
</P>
<P>
It's vital to read the policies to see what is and what is not covered. For 
example, a water pump may be covered but "overheating" may not be; you can pay 
a lot if a failed pump damages your engine but your contract covers only the 
part and not the rest. 
</P>
<P>
* If you're unsure about a contract, get a copy of the actual agreement and 
take it home to study. This can be tougher when buying used car contracts; such 
agreements must be purchased at time of sale. 
</P>
<P>
* Make sure the contract can be canceled if you change your mind; California 
law requires a cancellation clause. If done within 30 days, you'll probably get 
a full refund. Some companies charge a cancellation fee. 
</P>
<P>
* Be certain the name of the insurance firm that underwrites the program is 
included (state law mandates this), and ask about its industry rating; dealers 
should know. If there is no carrier named, chances are the contract is 
unprotected by insurance or is self-insured. 
</P>
<P>
* Inquire about deductibles. No-deductible options usually cost more. A fixed 
deductible is better than one calling for you to pay a percentage of repairs. 
</P>
<P>
* Find out how to make claims and where repairs can be made. Some firms require 
you to pay, then wait for reimbursement. Some contracts cover repairs only at 
the dealer where you bought your car; others, manufacturer-backed agreements 
mostly, allow repairs at dealers nationwide. Some contracts limit the number of 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
* Check whether your service contract can be transferred upon sale of the 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
* Investigate if the contract will not cover "pre-existing conditions." Be wary 
of this clause, especially with used vehicles. Most failures on used vehicles 
occur in the first 90 days after sale; most occur in the first 30 days. Why buy 
a contract to cover problems that normally would be a dealership's after-sale 
obligation? 
</P>
<P>
* If you buy a service contract, don't hesitate to call the listed 
administrator to ask questions. Do this in the first 30 days.

CRITIC AT LARGE: FREE EXPRESSION: A PROGRESS REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A midweek Fourth of July is a bit of a cheat, less a holiday than an awkward 
interruption, unless you can steal some extra days to stretch it out. But, like 
all the great punctuations of the year, the day -- even if tightly bracketed by 
work -- is colored by both memory and anticipations. 
</P>
<P>
The indigestions of Thanksgivings past, for example, are gratefully forgotten, 
but the family gatherings of those years return to mind, warming but 
melancholy. New Year's Eve is more portent than memory, touched with hope but 
also with a certain amount of anxiety, depending on whatever the state of the 
body, the job and the world is on Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
Independence Day 1990 arrives with a sharp and particular irony as I measure it 
against recollections of the fervent patriotic oratory that was part of the 
small-town observances as I knew them. It was all straight out of Norman 
Rockwell, including the orator who was often a county official. 
</P>
<P>
The thing was, the orator was telling us what we already believed and took for 
granted: about independence, freedom, the inalienable rights accruing to the 
citizens of a new nation conceived in liberty. Nobody had much occasion to 
think about the Bill of Rights. We knew it was there, but nobody had then heard 
of pleading the Fifth Amendment, and while freedom of expression might lead to 
the occasional fist fight, that was about it. We lived tolerantly under a 
canopy of agreed values. 
</P>
<P>
We were doubtless too complacent in our village, and nothing was as simple as 
distance makes it seem. The news of the larger society as it seeped into us on 
radio and from newspapers and magazines, left no doubt in the late '30s and 
early '40s that there were sharp ruptures over matters of taste and 
permissibility. 
</P>
<P>
Strippers were arrested, Life was banned in Boston for showing the birth of a 
baby, James Joyce's "Ulysses" was prosecuted for obscenity but, in one of 
history's most triumphant moments, acquitted. Even into the 1950s, language 
brusquer than hell and damn was rare in novels, and works by John O'Hara and 
Lillian Smith were prosecuted for language you could now use in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, after all the court decisions and all the large but gradual changes in 
the society's tolerances and understandings, reflected in everything from comic 
strips to minimalist music, you would have said the old urgings to censor, ban, 
proscribe and indict might have waned. 
</P>
<P>
But of course the wish to suppress springs as eternal as hope, and the irony of 
Independence Day is that it finds us amid renewed allegations of obscenity in 
art and a noisome battle over the workings and indeed the future of the 
National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
The endowments for both the arts and the humanities are legacies of the Lyndon 
Johnson presidency, born, not unlike the civil rights legislation, in the 
sorrowing aftermath of the Kennedy assassination. 
</P>
<P>
Federal subvention of the arts had never really been part of American 
philosophy until the Depression years. But the endowments have been by any 
reasonable accounting phenomenally successful, bringing into being 
organizations like the American Film Institute with its myriad activities not 
only in teaching but in film archiving and preservation. The never more than 
modest appropriations for the endowments have been bread upon the waters, 
evoking millions of dollars in matched private fundings. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of the art produced out of the thousands of grants has been found 
offensive by some. It may be; it may not be. Beethoven, Picasso and Joyce have 
been found offensive. 
</P>
<P>
What is usually found to be true is that the offending art is simply a step 
ahead of prevailing modes in the expression of emotions, truth and beauty or 
all three together. 
</P>
<P>
As in almost all the attempts at censorship from the beginnings of time, the 
present assaults on the NEA seem an attempt to wrench the world back to some 
pre-existing orthodoxy, some fairy-tale vision of life as it should be lived, 
especially as played by the censor's rules. The attempts to impose an 
anti-obscenity oath on artists -- and perhaps even more the timorous 
acquiescence of officials who ought to know better -- is the real obscenity and 
the graver danger to the cause of art. 
</P>
<P>
The largest worry is whether the repressive moves originating in the right-wing 
of society have wide support, and thus represent a wrenching back of the 
pendulum of allowability. In the last half of the 20th Century the pendulum of 
free expression has swung wide. The novel and the stage, radio, television and 
indeed all the arts enjoy latitudes of theme and form they have never known 
before. Despite the excesses and the exploitations that inevitably resulted, 
history will show that the arts, unshackled, reveal powers and passions and an 
ability to look deeply into our lives that is unprecedented and positive -- 
even if the results may be unnerving and, so be it, offensive. 
</P>
<P>
Art which can't be freely expressed and artists who must (but surely won't) 
submit to the paint-by-numbers dictates set by politicians are in clear 
contradiction of everything that is being celebrated on the Fourth of July. In 
recent times when censorship measures have been submitted to the voters they 
have been resoundingly defeated. What you have to hope on this day above all is 
that the ladies and gentlemen of Congress have read their constituencies as 
well as the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: AN ODE TO THE FIFTH FREEDOM: THE RIGHT TO ZAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
We celebrate our nation's birth, but also toast the Berlin Wall coming down and 
revolutionary moves toward freedom throughout Eastern Europe. We rejoice in 
free speech surging through the Soviet Union under glasnost, feel the optimism 
of post-Pinochet Chile, share the hopefulness of a South Africa finally 
starting to emerge from the abyss of apartheid. We wave the flag, sing the 
anthem and give lip service to liberty everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
We do this, all the while clasping the ultimate tool of despotism in American 
households, that lightweight 3x7-inch black plastic symbol of the technovideo 
tyranny we live under. 
</P>
<P>
The Remote Control Device. 
</P>
<P>
Tiny rows of tiny rubber buttons: You've got your VCR/TV buttons, your 
quick-view button, your cancel button, your off timer/QTR button, your mode 
button, your audio-video control buttons, your audio volume buttons, your enter 
button, your mute button, your input selector button, your display recall 
button and your VCR function buttons. Very impressive. 
</P>
<P>
On the far right, in the shape of arrows, are the ones that matter most, 
however. Minute, yet significant, your channel-selector buttons beckon. 
</P>
<P>
My itchy trigger thumb is poised as I behold that enormous bag of wind Willard 
Scott on NBC's "Today." From outdoors somewhere, the colossus exhales: "Look at 
me! Look at that baby face, 56 years old! Zoom in on me! This is. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Zap. 
</P>
<P>
Don't wanna hear him. Don't have to. I hold the power. Like Billy the Kid with 
a smoking six-shooter, I have in my hand the means of destruction. If I don't 
like what I see, if it ticks me off at all or even bores me just a little, I 
squeeze a channel selector button and blow it away. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly it's "The Flintstones," where Fred is on his way to the vet with 
Barney, who is barking because he's been hypnotized to think he's a dog. 
</P>
<P>
Make me laugh. I haven't got all day, not even a few minutes. My thumb is 
getting that itch again, so make me laugh -- fast. 
</P>
<P>
Fred to the vet: "This is my friend. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Too late. 
</P>
<P>
Zap. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, what exquisite irony, for instant zapping was created, in effect, by 
the very TV industry it now terrorizes. Our attention spans are fractured into 
a thousand pieces, the result of continual exposure to a medium that in the 
1980s increasingly abbreviated everything out of fear that viewers would get 
squirmy and tune elsewhere when bored. Yet it's this very fragmented condition, 
as if an automatic timer buzzed the brain every few seconds, that drives us to 
zap. 
</P>
<P>
Clint Eastwood is on the screen as a jet pilot: "Contact time, nine seconds." 
Can't wait. 
</P>
<P>
Zap. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Bixby, alias The Hulk, is questioned by a man in a black suit: "You say a 
change comes over you? And who is that beast who broke you out of jail?" Can't 
wait for the answer. 
</P>
<P>
Zap. 
</P>
<P>
It's "Newhart," and as Bob's wife comes down the stairs, he greets her with a 
chainsaw: "I was just coming up to wake you." Not funny enough. 
</P>
<P>
Zap. 
</P>
<P>
There's a newscast: "If convicted, Raymond Buckey. . . ." Heard it. 
</P>
<P>
Zap. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't tyranny, you say, it's freedom. On the one hand, you're right. 
</P>
<P>
After several decades of slavery, of being imprisoned behind the Berlin Wall 
and barbed wire of our own apathy and laziness, of lacking the vitality to rise 
when displeased, drag ourselves a few feet, extend an arm and change channels 
on the set, we were finally liberated about 10 years ago. That's when the 
Remote Control Device started becoming standard equipment on most TV sets. 
</P>
<P>
Television programmers had counted on our inertia, and profited from it by 
correctly figuring that a good lead-in program was all that was needed to hold 
an audience through an evening. Hook them with the lead-in, and once that first 
domino fell the others would follow, because viewers were so solidly cemented 
to their sofas and easy chairs that leaving them to change channels was 
unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Remote Control Device that made the difference, giving us thumb 
power, the big Zaperoo, the hand-held ability to speed through a 40-channel 
universe on impulse. From mind to thumb to set in an instant. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, whose mind? Whose thumb? Who makes the choice? 
</P>
<P>
The person holding the Remote Control Device, that's who. Oh, there may be 
another set in the house, but usually a lesser one in a less comfortable room. 
Fastest person to the No. 1 set gets to control it. This viewer is the 
omnipotent one, the tyrant sitting on the imperial throne instantaneously 
turning thumbs up or down based on whim, and doing so while deaf to the wishes 
of others in the room. 
</P>
<P>
The picture flickers. Straight ahead on the screen it's stony Miss Marple with 
another murder on her hands. Seen it. 
</P>
<P>
Zap. 
</P>
<P>
From elsewhere in the room another sound reaches my ears. It's a faint protest 
that comes far too late, for my thumb has swiftly squeezed off not one zap, not 
two zaps, but the big triple, three zaps faster than you can say, "But I wanted 
to watch that." 
</P>
<P>
So get your own Remote Control Device, I mutter. 
</P>
<P>
Aha. A thought. In fact, there is only one way to guarantee equality in front 
of the set, none other than dual Remote Control Devices: thumb against thumb, 
zap against zap, your very own Shootout at the OK Corral. 
</P>
<P>
An extra Remote Control Device is an expensive solution to impose on someone in 
your house who is video oppressed. What the heck, maybe I'll spring for it 
myself. This is the Fourth of July, after all, and liberty is never cheap.

THEN THERE WERE 6: Today is the last day fireworks are legal in Westminster. . 
. . Thursday it joins the majority in Orange County, leaving just six cities 
where personal fireworks can be sold and set off: Buena Park, Costa Mesa, 
Fullerton, Garden Grove, Orange and Santa Ana. . . . Five of them have extra 
patrols looking for illegal fireworks, but Costa Mesa has given up. . . . "I've 
tried it -- I even tried the police helicopter -- but it's a waste of time," 
says city Fire Marshal Tom Macduff. "Trying to find just the illegal ones is a 
nightmare. The only way you can enforce anything is to enforce it against all 
fireworks." Steve Emmons and Jeffrey A. Perlman

NURSE, DOCTOR ROLES PROBED IN CANCER DEATH 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An elderly Garden Grove woman whose death last November was attributed to 
breast cancer may have died after a hospital nurse allegedly injected her with 
a lethal dose of potassium, police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The woman's family was told that she died of complications from breast cancer, 
from which she had been suffering for several years, and a death certificate 
listed the cause of death as "metastatic breast cancer." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Williams, a Fountain Valley police investigator, said officers began 
looking into the woman's death at FHP Fountain Valley Hospital after state 
officials were contacted by an FHP employee. 
</P>
<P>
Police are also reviewing the role of physicians involved in the woman's care 
and the subsequent preparation of the death certificate, Williams said, but he 
added that no physicians had been targeted in the probe. 
</P>
<P>
An FHP spokeswoman said the hospital is cooperating with the investigation but 
declined to comment on the allegations. She said the nurse in question no 
longer works at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said Francis J. Johnson, 74, was admitted to the hospital for 
respiratory problems on Nov. 13, 1989, and died the following day. 
</P>
<P>
But Williams said that investigators now believe that Johnson may have died "as 
a result of an FHP nurse administering the wrong medication," which he 
described as potassium. Williams said it had not been ruled out that the death 
was caused by the nurse accidentally administering the wrong dosage of 
medication. 
</P>
<P>
The death certificate, obtained by The Times and dated Nov. 15, 1989, was 
signed by Dr. Sabry Ghaly, identified by FHP as a staff physician. Attempts to 
reach Ghaly for his comments were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said the investigation began in June, nearly seven months after 
Johnson's death, when an unidentified employee at FHP alerted the state 
Department of Consumer Affairs that she may have died of something other than 
breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators with the Orange County district attorney's office, the Orange 
County coroner's office and state Consumer Affairs Department, which regulates 
nursing, are involved in the inquiry, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Ria Carlson, an FHP spokeswoman, identified the nurse involved as Maureen 
Daubert, who she said stopped working at the 99-bed hospital on Nov. 21 -- 
seven days after Johnson's death. Carlson declined to say why Daubert had left 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"Because the investigation is ongoing, it would be inappropriate for us to say 
anything more," Carlson said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said Daubert had left the state but already had been interviewed once 
by investigators from Consumer Affairs. He said police also want to question 
her. Daubert could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said that Johnson was "having problems breathing" when she was 
admitted to the hospital the day before she died. Williams said she apparently 
went into cardiac arrest almost immediately after being injected with 40 
milliequivalents of potassium. He said attempts to resuscitate her failed. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, it's still pretty early to tell what exactly happened," 
Williams said. "There are several people that still need to be interviewed," 
including the attending physicians. 
</P>
<P>
After her death, Johnson's body was donated to the USC School of Dentistry. No 
autopsy was performed at the time. Last month, with the investigation under 
way, coroner's investigators retrieved the body from USC and performed an 
autopsy, the results of which have not been released. 
</P>
<P>
A coroner's official said a new death certificate will be issued. 
</P>
<P>
At Johnson's Garden Grove home Tuesday, her son, Garry Garcia, said he had been 
told of the police investigation only recently. Garcia said police have updated 
him on the status of the investigation, but he declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his mother's death, Garcia said, the family had no clue that 
anything was amiss when doctors told them she had died of breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no reason for us to believe anything other than what they told us," 
said Garcia, an Army logistics specialist. 
</P>
<P>
His mother, who Garcia said was a secretary and had retained her maiden name 
for professional reasons, had been diagnosed with cancer several years ago. He 
described her as "a real strong, real religious woman." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia said news of the investigation was disturbing because the family 
believes that Johnson's death directly contributed to the death of his 
73-year-old father, George Garcia, less than two months later. 
</P>
<P>
"After she died, my dad said, 'I don't want to live anymore,' " Garcia said. 
"He completely stopped eating for a week. He told everybody (that he wanted to 
die). He sat out in his wheelchair quite a bit in the front yard and said 
that." 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 7, George Garcia, who had been wheelchair-bound because of an old 
injury sustained on his job as a painter, died of a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
"They were very, very close," Garcia said of his parents. "They were married 
for 37 years." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Eric Alcouloumre, associate director of the emergency care unit at Hoag 
Hospital in Newport Beach, said that death could be caused by administering too 
much potassium in one dose or a recommended amount of potassium too quickly. 
Too much potassium "causes the heart to stop. If a patient received a rapid or 
large infusion of potassium, it could cause death," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sandy Gordon, assistant professor of emergency medicine at UCI Medical 
Center, said that patients receiving nutrients intravenously have an acute need 
for intravenous potassium. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're not taking potassium by mouth, you are losing it in urine and you 
need to replace it at a maintenance level," Gordon said. "Many patients on 
diuretics lose even more" so there is an acute need to replace it.

FAVORED SITE FOR AIRPORT IS FULL OF TOXIC WASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The San Bernardino County land where Orange County leaders want to place an 
international airport is so polluted by discarded jet fuel and chemical 
solvents that it ranks among the nation's worst hazardous-waste sites. 
</P>
<P>
Cleaning up the area around George Air Force Base will cost the federal 
government millions of dollars and could take as long as three decades. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been identified as one of the most potentially hazardous toxic waste 
sites in the country," Terry Wilson, a spokesman for the Environmental 
Protection Agency's regional office in San Francisco, said Tuesday. "The fact 
that it's on the (EPA's Superfund) list indicates that this particular site has 
very significant environmental problems." 
</P>
<P>
Officials say that the pollution would not likely block development of an 
airport. However, the issue, coupled with a boiling political squabble that 
divides the surrounding high-desert communities, stands as an obstacle that 
Orange County airport backers must overcome as they proceed with plans to 
convert what is now George Air Force Base into a Southland "super port" served 
by a high-speed train. 
</P>
<P>
According to EPA and Air Force officials, a storm drain running parallel to the 
main runway at George long served as a dumping area for solvents, paints and 
industrial chemicals, and some of them leached into soil along the 18,000-foot 
drain. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, an underground lake on the edge of the base has been contaminated 
by solvents once used to de-grease aircraft. Trichloroethylene, a suspected 
carcinogen, has seeped into the water, poisoning the lake. That and other 
hazardous chemicals have turned up in on-base monitoring wells within three 
miles of where base residents draw their drinking water, according to the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
Despite those problems, local and federal officials say they do not believe 
plans for building a commercial airport at the base -- scheduled to close in 
December, 1992 -- will be affected by the presence of toxic chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department has already launched a $5-million cleanup program, and 
though it is expected to take 15 to 30 years in the case of the underground 
lake, local officials say the proposed airport could be built around the 
contaminated area. 
</P>
<P>
"As I understand it, our environmental situation as it is would not prevent the 
base's reuse as a commercial airport," said Capt. James Tynan, a spokesman for 
the base. 
</P>
<P>
Adelanto Mayor Ed Dondelinger, whose city abuts the base, agreed, saying that 
the environmental problems are significant but that the Defense Department is 
handling the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
While the environmental issues, though serious, appear to be under control, a 
pesky political standoff has arisen: Some local officials in the high desert 
welcome the international airport with open arms, but others fear potential 
environmental and traffic problems that could come with such a large facility 
and favor a much smaller one. 
</P>
<P>
Infighting between two groups has grown to the point that the Air Force, which 
has urged area governments to reach a consensus, has offered to supply a 
federal mediator. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of like a family squabble," said Bruce Kitchen, a Hesperia City 
Council member. "We're all going to sit down at the table. It's just a matter 
of who gets the most potatoes." 
</P>
<P>
Dondelinger and other Adelanto officials have argued that their city has been 
the most affected by the Air Force base and that they have the most at stake in 
its conversion. As a result, Adelanto has sought to pursue development of an 
international airport essentially on its own, seeking input from its neighbors 
but hoping to retain the final say in whatever plan is adopted. 
</P>
<P>
That has irritated the other high-desert communities, however, where officials 
say traffic and other fallout from any commercial airport in the region would 
affect them as well. Joined together as the Victor Valley Economic Development 
Authority, representatives of three cities and the county are arguing for a 
more modest proposal than the one backed by Adelanto. 
</P>
<P>
"Our initial analysis is that the base would be more appropriately used as a 
regional airport about the size of Ontario," said Wayne Lamoreaux, town manager 
of Apple Valley. "We're not ready to embrace the idea of a 'superport.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Victor Valley group has agreed to have a mediator intercede, but so far 
Adelanto has not. "I'm a little reluctant to agree to a mediator because I have 
everything to give and they have nothing," Dondelinger said. 
</P>
<P>
All the while, Orange County officials are waiting in the wings in hopes that 
construction of the airport and rail will relieve congestion at crowded John 
Wayne Airport. County supervisors voted last month to endorse George Air Force 
Base as their preferred airport site. 
</P>
<P>
Board Chairman Don R. Roth, one of the airport and super-speed train's most 
fervent supporters, said Tuesday that he will meet with the Victor Valley group 
on July 25 but plans to steer clear of the high-desert battle.

DANGER: Contrary to popular belief, the younger child is not the one most often 
injured by fireworks. . . . The National Fire Protection Assn. says 
10-to-14-year-olds suffer the most, nearly 50% more than either older 
teen-agers or the 5-to-9-year-olds. . . . "They get cherry bombs and want to 
hold things and be macho," says an emergency room nurse. . . . An exception: 
Almost half of all sparkler injuries are to children younger than 5 because 
some parents think that sparklers are harmless. They burn at 1,200 degrees, 
sear flesh and ignite hair and clothes.

HOW FIREWORKS GET THEIR COLORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fireworks' color palette is created by using precise amounts of chemicals 
mixed with the explosives. Blues, for example, are obtained by using copper, 
Strontium salts make the red colors, calcium makes orange and sodium makes 
yellow. Since World War II, organic compounds of chlorine have been mixed with 
the explosive to make the color burn brighter. The sparkling effects are 
created by using metals, such as iron or magnesium, which burn brightly when 
placed in an explosive mixture.

FIREWORKS SHOW IS 2ND LARGEST IN STATE

<P>
With an arsenal of 1,800 aerial fireworks, lasers and 19 cannons, the Brea 
Fireworks Spectacular is billed by the city as the second largest in the state, 
second only to the show at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Set to music, the one-hour, $57,000 show features seven sets, including one 
with the theme "Phantom of the Opera." Other fireworks-and-music productions 
include the 1812 Overture and "2001: A Space Odyssey." The Society for the 
Preservation of Big Bands will perform most of the music. 
</P>
<P>
The show will start at 9:30 p.m. at Brea-Olinda High School stadium. 
</P>
<P>
After a three-year hiatus, this year's show resumes a tradition started in 
1974. The event was not held during the last three years because the old high 
school had been torn down and the new school stadium was not completed. 
</P>
<P>
According to Mike Maxfield, Brea's public information officer, the City Council 
was eager to hold the fireworks show again. In January, the Fire Department 
surveyed the new stadium and gave its approval for the event. 
</P>
<P>
As in the past, the fireworks display will cap a day of festivities. From 10 
a.m. to 4:30 p.m. a country fair will be held at City Hall Park. Entertainment, 
food, games, contests and crafts will be featured. 
</P>
<P>
Before the show, several bands will perform and vintage airplanes will fly over 
the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for the fireworks show are $10 and will be sold at the fair. Shuttle 
buses will run between the high school and two parking areas -- the east 
parking lot at Brea Mall near May Co. and the Olen Point Ride Share Parking 
lot, north of Lambert Road and west of Wildcat Way. The buses will run from 
6:30 to 8:30 p.m. and immediately after the show. Parking will not be available 
at the high school. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HOLIDAY HAIR-RAISING EXPERIENCE FOR PETS

<TEXT>
<P>
The loud bangs and bright lights of the Fourth of July might be fun for people, 
but they can be petrifying for cats and dogs. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the busiest time of year for us because of fireworks," said Kevin 
Whelan, acting chief of field services for the Orange County Animal Control 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
"The noise causes a lot of emotional distress for the animals." 
</P>
<P>
On the Fourth, the department is traditionally overwhelmed with calls about 
missing pets and others being hit by cars, Whelan said. "The following day 
we're still swamped because the animals are still at large," he said. 
</P>
<P>
To make the Fourth a safe and sane holiday for pets, animal experts advise 
owners to keep cats and dogs inside and make sure their identification tags are 
current. 
</P>
<P>
"If you put them in the back yard, they're liable to go over the fence or under 
the fence and run away," said Debi Hall, assistant director at the Humane 
Society of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
If owners know that their pets are frightened by fireworks, they can get mild 
tranquilizers from their veterinarian, Hall said. Placing the animals in 
transfer cages, crates or dog runs will also help calm them, Whelan said. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Pagano, Irvine Animal Services superintendent, suggests that owners leave 
their pets with friends or relatives if they will be gone during the evening. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough if the animals are home alone after dark, when the fireworks 
typically start," Pagano said. SHANNON SANDS

PARADE PLANNERS BAR YOUNGEST MARCHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The thousands of spectators at today's annual Fourth of July parade can expect 
a flashier and snappier event than in previous years, organizers say, but it 
will also have a share of controversy. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in the parade's 68 years, for example, the parade will not 
include young children marching up Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
That change is part of organizers' efforts to sharpen and speed the parade. The 
15-member parade executive board agreed this year to limit groups to 50 
members, bar undecorated flatbed trucks and enforce for the first time a 
longstanding rule that children younger than 8 not be allowed to march, Bill 
Reed, city public information director, said. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with a large number of applicants, the board -- accepting the advice of 
its Lynwood-based event coordinator -- agreed to stiffen its entry standards, 
Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
Enough entry applications were received to put together a six-hour event, he 
said, but the board pared the parade down to two hours. 
</P>
<P>
Children of all ages will be allowed to ride on floats or other vehicles, but 
the younger ones may not march, board chairwoman Donna Cross said. 
</P>
<P>
Several groups of young children, including baton twirlers who have been a 
parade mainstay in recent years, were turned away, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Young marchers are mainly barred because "we don't want to have 3-, 4- and 
5-year-old children walking two miles uphill in the hot sun," she said. "Last 
year, we had irate mothers calling (after the event), saying why did we make 
their child walk two miles in that hot sun. . . . My biggest concern is I want 
to see the children protected." 
</P>
<P>
Also, until last week it appeared that an Afghan rebel leader whom Rep. Dana 
Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) invited to participate would be barred. Originally, city 
officials had announced that Gen. Ramatullah Safi would not be allowed to ride 
with Rohrabacher on a float because he might pose a security risk. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials and some City Council members feared that Safi, a leading 
member of one of seven groups fighting the communist government of Kabul, might 
attract protesters opposed to him. 
</P>
<P>
However, after police checked into Safi's background through the State 
Department, the general, whom Rohrabacher met during a visit to Afghanistan 
last year, was cleared to appear in the parade, Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two YMCA youth groups had accused parade organizers of blocking 
their bid to participate in the parade, as they have done for the last several 
years. But the leader of the YMCA Indian Guides and Indian Princesses backed 
off after acknowledging that they had not provided proof of insurance for the 
vehicle they had planned to use, as parade officials require, Reed said.

HUNGARY: FOUR IN THE SOCIETY DEVOTED TO THE SACRED HEART WILL TEACH RELIGION IN 
BUDAPEST FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE FLEEING COMMUNISM 40 YEARS AGO.

<P>
When Sister Ida Peterfy left Hungary in 1950, the newly installed Communist 
government was seizing church property and the nation's cardinal had been 
arrested and sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than risk arrest and the dissolution of the Roman Catholic religious 
order she had founded in 1940 at age 18, Peterfy fled the country under cover 
of darkness and brought the order first to Canada and later Los Angeles and 
Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday morning, Peterfy, 68, and three other members of the Society Devoted to 
the Sacred Heart left John Wayne Airport, bound for Budapest. For the first 
time in 40 years, the nuns will teach religion in their native Hungary, where 
political reforms have brought increased personal and religious freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Although members have been back to Hungary for family visits, "we never had the 
opportunity to go back and do something for God, to teach, to share," said 
Sister Eva Batta, head of Sacred Heart Convent in Santa Ana and one of the nuns 
returning to Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the sisters were returning simply for another short visit with 
relatives, Peterfy said. But after learning of their trip, several Hungarian 
bishops asked the sisters to speak before church groups and give advice on how 
to revive Catholicism after 41 years of suppression under Communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
The sisters specialize in religious education and have developed videotapes 
geared to children. They also hold youth retreats and conduct evening and 
weekend religion classes for elementary and high school-age students. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, the order is affiliated with St. Barbara's Church and Our 
Lady del Pilar Church in Santa Ana and St. John the Baptist Church in Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Luggage for the nuns' six-week lecture tour includes not only clothing and 
personal effects, but also more than 50 pounds of teaching material, including 
the 30-part children's series called "Sacred Hearts Kid Club." 
</P>
<P>
"What we know, we would like to share," said Batta, 64, one of the nuns 
boarding the flight Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Batta remembers the night in 1950 when she fled Hungary. At age 23, Batta and 
another nun crossed through barbed wire that separated East and West and 
entered Austria. 
</P>
<P>
"We left with smugglers who took us through the border at night, on foot," 
Batta said before boarding her flight. "I held onto a man's coat as he led us 
through the forest. It was so dark." 
</P>
<P>
Leaving her homeland was not easy, but it was necessary if she was to pursue 
her vocation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"When the communists took over at the end of the war, the whole regime 
changed," Batta said. "The communist elements became the leading parties, and 
religious people were suppressed." 
</P>
<P>
After reaching Austria, Canada agreed to accept them as displaced persons, and 
the order moved to Toronto, with the nuns agreeing to work for one year in that 
country, mostly as housekeepers, Batta said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1956, the Los Angeles Archdiocese invited the order to open a convent. 
Today, the order has 47 members in 10 small convents, including three houses in 
Santa Ana. The order recently bought a home in Northridge to be its 
motherhouse.

SUSPECT TURNS KEY WITNESS IN GIRL'S DEATH

<P>
A man who was identified as a suspect in the slaying of 9-year-old Autumn 
Wallace has contacted police and is now a witness in the murder case, sheriff's 
officials announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Lt. Richard J. Olson identified the man only as a 35-year-old 
resident of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Autumn, a popular pupil at Dr. Jonas E. Salk Elementary School, was found face 
down in a pool of blood in a bathroom of her Hedlund Drive home in an 
unincorporated area between Stanton and Anaheim. Sheriff's investigators said 
she had been stabbed numerous times. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, authorities charged Maria del Rosio Alfaro, 18, of Anaheim with the 
June 15 slaying. At the same time, they released a composite of a man who was 
seen with a male companion in front of the Wallace house on the afternoon of 
the girl's death. According to investigators, neighbors saw the man playing 
with a Latino child in the Wallace front yard. 
</P>
<P>
Olson said the man depicted in the composite drawing contacted Anaheim police 
Monday night to report that he was one of the men seen at the Wallace 
residence. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting with police, the man agreed to be questioned by sheriff's 
investigators who now consider him an important witness in the murder case, 
Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a suspect until such time as we found out what he was doing (in front 
of the house)," Olson said. "(Now) he is strictly a witness to us." 
</P>
<P>
He declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Olson said investigators are still looking for the second man and for a gold 
1970s-model Chevrolet Monte Carlo seen parked in front of the Wallace house on 
the day of the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Zwonitzer, a private investigator with Clarke International 
Investigations, said an arrest of a "primary suspect" is imminent. The Long 
Beach firm has been hired by the Wallace family to investigate the crime. 
</P>
<P>
"When everything is known, the brutality of this crime will be shocking," 
Zwonitzer said.

TENANTS' VICTORY: 'LESSON TO LANDLORDS'; 
</P>
<P>
DISPUTE: IT TOOK TIME AND PATIENCE, SAY MOBILE HOME DWELLERS WHO WON A 
SETTLEMENT FROM THE PARK OWNER, BUT THEY WOULD DO IT ALL AGAIN.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the eight years her family has lived at the Aloha Palms Trailer Park in 
Costa Mesa, Julia Jimenez said, they have endured sewage running down the 
streets because of broken pipes, water leaking through their roofs and 
cockroaches crawling about their home. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, she and 10 other tenants who recently won a $230,000 settlement 
from mobile park owner Rubidoux Partnership, held a news conference in Santa 
Ana to say that their fight to improve squalid conditions took time and 
patience, but that they would do it all over again. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this is a lesson to other landlords that we are humans and we have 
rights too," said Jimenez, one of the organizers of a rent strike three years 
ago that eventually led to the lawsuit against the park owners. "If they had 
made the improvements when we first complained, we would not have gone to 
court. 
</P>
<P>
"It took a lot of time, but I would do it all again for my kids," said Jimenez, 
a mother of three. "This is really about them." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Spix, a lawyer with the nonprofit Hermandad Mexicana Nacional Legal 
Center, which represented the tenants, said this settlement is part of a 
growing trend in Orange County to hold landlords accountable for squalid 
conditions on their properties. The legal center is also involved in lawsuits 
against Santa Ana landlord Carmine Esposito, who is being sued by 70 tenants. 
On Monday, after a five-year legal struggle, Esposito agreed to pay one tenant 
$19,000. The other cases are still pending. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for Rubidoux said this settlement clears the way for much-needed 
improvements to the Aloha park. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very, very happy with the settlement," attorney Stephen Duringer said. 
"We feel it's fair to both sides." 
</P>
<P>
He said many of the problems at the park, at 133 E. 16th Street in Costa Mesa, 
were created when it was under its previous ownership, and Rubidoux inherited 
the tenants' ire. 
</P>
<P>
"The park is a bad park," he said. "The current owners purchased it in 1988 
with the specific purpose of rehabilitating it. A month later, the rent strike 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the Hermandad legal center represented 28 tenants but several of 
them moved away or abandoned the action. The 11 who are left will share the 
$230,000 in compensation for what they have had to endure, Spix said. 
</P>
<P>
At Aloha Palms, tenants live in park-owned mobile homes that are about 30 years 
old, Duringer said. As part of the settlement, the owners have agreed to 
rehabilitate the park and replace each mobile home with a new double-wide one. 
After the rehabilitation, rents will increase from $400 to $750 a month, still 
below market value, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Duringer, who specializes in landlord-tenant disputes, agreed that property 
owners are becoming more aware of their obligations to tenants and that tenants 
appear to be savvier about their rights. 
</P>
<P>
"Landlords are becoming more educated, much more responsible," he said. "But it 
works both ways. Tenants are finally realizing that there are certain things 
under their control. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"When cases like this go to litigation, no one really wins," he said. "The 
tenants live in conditions they really shouldn't live in. The owners are 
prevented from doing what they need to do as a business enterprise. Both sides 
probably could have handled it better in this case."

MAN IS SHOT TO DEATH OUTSIDE SANTA ANA STORE

<P>
A man was fatally shot in the back early Tuesday as he walked toward a 
convenience store, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators are trying to determine a motive for the killing of Manuel Ayala 
Cortez, 21. 
</P>
<P>
He was pronounced dead at McFadden Avenue and Bristol Street minutes after the 
shooting, which occurred shortly after midnight, Santa Ana police spokeswoman 
Maureen Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Cortez and his uncle had been sitting on a bus bench in front of the 7-Eleven 
when a car pulled up a short distance away and stopped. When Cortez started to 
walk toward the convenience store, two men got out of the car -- one of them 
armed with a handgun -- and followed him, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman shot Cortez "several times" in the back. The uncle, Manuel Ayala 
Valdez, 23, who was sitting on the bench, ran toward his wounded nephew. The 
gunman then spun around and pointed the weapon at Valdez, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
"The gunman pulled the trigger again," Thomas said, "but he had expended all 
his ammunition. The uncle ran and took cover behind some nearby bushes." 
</P>
<P>
The suspects' car was last seen speeding off west on McFadden Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe that the assailants had waited in their vehicle before 
approaching the suspect, Thomas said. Police are trying to determine whether 
Cortez knew his assailants.

FIREMAN'S FUND SUES IRVINE'S WESPERCORP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. on Tuesday filed a $485,000 breach-of-contract 
lawsuit against Wespercorp, an Irvine computer parts company, Wespercorp 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In a suit filed in Orange County Superior Court in Santa Ana, Fireman's Fund is 
seeking to recover funds that it paid to Citizens Utilities Co. in Stamford, 
Conn., in November, 1986. The payments were made in settlement of a dispute 
related to a contract in which Wespercorp was to provide billing systems to 
Citizens Utilities. 
</P>
<P>
Wespercorp indemnified the payments by Fireman's Fund. But when Fireman's Fund

U.S. SEIZES FILES OF HUNTINGTON BEACH BUSINESSMAN; 
</P>
<P>
INSURANCE: AN INVESTIGATION CENTERS ON UP TO $9 MILLION IN SUSPECTED MAIL AND 
BANKRUPTCY FRAUD INVOLVING SIX COMPANIES. 
</P>

<P>
Federal agents have seized records of six companies run by a Huntington Beach 
businessman suspected of defrauding small businesses of up to $9 million and 
other insurance companies of additional amounts, a court affidavit obtained 
Tuesday shows. 
</P>
<P>
The records of the companies owned by Henry W. Hay were taken in a June 26 
search of his Beach Boulevard offices by state fraud investigators and federal 
postal and labor officials as part of a wide-ranging investigation into his 
business activities. 
</P>
<P>
The 37-page affidavit, filed in federal court in Los Angeles by Postal 
Inspector James S. Hamilton, says the investigation is centering on possible 
mail and bankruptcy fraud by Hay. Hamilton would not comment on the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
Hay has not been charged with wrongdoing. He and his attorney, George L. 
Rogers, could not be reached Tuesday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"Hay sold to various employers, for the benefit of their employees, medical 
insurance programs that falsely purported to be partially and (later) fully 
underwritten by legitimate insurance companies," Hamilton said in the 
affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
Hay is also suspected of defrauding insurance companies by mailing false 
reimbursement claims, the affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
It further states that Hay is suspected of "fraudulently concealing assets and 
filing false proof of claims in order to eliminate any liability concerning the 
payment of any outstanding claims" in regard to the bankruptcy of one of his 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
According to the affidavit, Hay's California Development Maintenance Assn. 
solicited small businesses to buy fully insured group health coverage from him. 
</P>
<P>
However, the affidavit says that he did not disclose that the health benefit 
programs that he sold were not fully insured -- which assures coverage by other 
insurers in the event of a shortfall -- but rather were self-funded by two 
other Hay controlled companies, Building Employers Trust (BET) and Professional 
Employers Trust (PET), and that this had the effect of leaving small employers 
with inadequate insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
BET was established in 1982 to pay for life, health and dental benefits through 
contracts with providers; PET was started in 1983 to provide similar insurance 
coverages. 
</P>
<P>
Other companies that Hay operated were Health Data Processing Insurance 
Administrators Inc.; HDH Insurance Marketing &amp; Sales, and Hay &amp; 
Gillespie Insurance Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit alleges that Hays misrepresented the coverage provided by BET 
since it was established. Hay has provided coverage for about 1,900 
small-business employers, which has about 1,700 participants, since 1985, the 
document said. 
</P>
<P>
"Both the insurance agents and the employers would not have done business with 
Henry Hay and his entities had they known the programs were self funded," the 
affidavit says. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, $6 million to $9 million in participant health claims remain 
unpaid since November of last year, Hamilton stated in his affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
It also says that Hay defrauded several insurers by mailing to insurance 
companies photocopies of purportedly issued but unpaid checks. 
</P>
<P>
The insurers insured the benefit programs for losses exceeding $50,000, the 
affidavit says, then the companies mailed Hay the money based on the 
purportedly issued checks. 
</P>
<P>
Hay and the insurance companies agreed that Hay and his companies were to pay 
all claims before the insurers would reimburse him, but Hay fraudulently 
received insurance reimbursement on some claimants whose expenses exceeded 
$50,000, the affidavit says. After receiving these reimbursements, the 
affidavit says, Hay and his companies did not pay all the claimants' service 
providers: that is, doctors and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
When the Department of Labor started investigating complaints about Hay and his 
companies last summer, officials requested financial records from BET. But Hay, 
through Rogers, said he could not provide the records because BET had filed for 
bankruptcy and had named the claimants and service providers as creditors. 
</P>
<P>
During the bankruptcy proceeding, Hay failed to provide the court with all of 
the company's books and records and to disclose all of BET's assets and 
liabilities, the affidavit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
Such failures constitute bankruptcy fraud, the document says.

Chairman Named: Looking for faster growth and multistate branches, Assured 
Thrift &amp; Loan recently named Los Angeles lawyer Fred Rucker as chairman of 
the Mission Viejo thrift. 
</P>
<P>
Rucker, a founding director of the 8-year-old thrift, replaces Fred Pieracci, 
founding chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Pieracci remains on the board. 
</P>
<P>
Rucker is expected to generate more capital for the thrift and expand its reach 
throughout California and into neighboring states in the next few years, said 
Edward Latscha, Assured's president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
The thrift -- a state-chartered industrial bank, not a savings and loan -- has 
two branches in Orange County and one each in Los Angeles and San Diego 
counties. It plans to open branches in Palm Desert and Victorville later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Assured Thrift, which recently moved to its new headquarters from San Juan 
Capistrano, has $63 million in assets. It earned $493,000 last year.

Top Fund-Raiser: Sunwest Bank in Tustin was recently named the top fund-raiser 
in Orange County's 1990 March of Dimes "WalkAmerica" event. The bank's 
employees collected $55,000, nearly $25,000 more than the second-place team, 
the bank said. WalkAmerica is an annual event designed to raise money for the 
prevention of birth defects.

<P>
POETRY: WELL-VERSED BARDS BRING THE BIG-CITY ART FORM OF COMPETITIVE READINGS 
TO ORANGE COUNTY. 'EXPOSURE IS THE NAME OF THE GAME,' A JUDGE SAYS.

'Twas the battle of the bards -- Orange County style. 
</P>
<P>
Poets came down from Santa Monica and up from San Clemente. There were 
academics, published poets and closet versifiers. Slips of paper filled with 
soulful words quivered in the hands of the most experienced readers for what 
was billed as Southern California's first "Poetry Performance Competition." 
</P>
<P>
Poetry readings have cropped up in the Southland's most chic venues, breathing 
public life into a usually private literary art. But among more than 175 who 
overflowed a room of the Fullerton Museum Center on Saturday night to hear 
poets compete, there was just one beret in sight. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd of grandmothers to grade-schoolers, at first daunted at the prospect 
of listening to 30 contestants, was captured from the very first reader, a 
young mother with waist-length, strawberry-blond hair: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
. . . Eight girls in emerald green 
</P>
<P>
tea dresses waft down the street like 
</P>
<P>
 victory 
</P>
<P>
their calves like pistons, and while 
</P>
<P>
I am not particularly aroused 
</P>
<P>
it makes me sad that I cannot have 
</P>
<P>
 them 
</P>
<P>
for just one night. Excess isn't 
</P>
<P>
 sinful 
</P>
<P>
it's just hard to concentrate 
</P>
<P>
 afterward . . . 
</P>
<P>
That was from one of two offerings by Tira Anne Palmquist of Tustin, who won 
the evening's grand prize of $100 for her poems "Lust After Angels" and 
"Humanity." 
</P>
<P>
Yet it wasn't the prizes that drew poets from throughout Southern California to 
Fullerton on a Saturday night but, as one writer said, "the need to shatter a 
poet's anonymity." 
</P>
<P>
For Palmquist, 27, it worked. Previously unknown to Poets Reading Inc., she is 
now guaranteed a spot as a featured reader at one of the organization's 
upcoming events. 
</P>
<P>
"Exposure is the name of the game here," said Charles Webb, committee member 
for the Los Angeles Poetry Festival and one of the evening's three judges. 
"There were a lot of people whose names I will remember that were impressive -- 
and that can't hurt at all." 
</P>
<P>
"I think we started a tradition," said Michael Logue, one of the founders of 
Poets Reading Inc. The nonprofit group, founded two years ago, hosts 
semimonthly poetry readings at the Fullerton Museum Center and sponsors 
scholarships for writing students at Cal State Fullerton and Fullerton College. 
</P>
<P>
Logue predicted that poetry competitions will quickly spread. Already the Los 
Angeles-based poetry group, Soul Visions Productions, has adapted the idea for 
an upcoming event. 
</P>
<P>
Performance-poetry competitions may be new to Southern California, but they 
reportedly thrive in New York, New Orleans and other cities. In Chicago, the 
contests are called "Poetry Slams." Poets face off and hurl stanzas at each 
other, trying to best one another like old-time tap dancers outstepping each 
other in a "challenge." 
</P>
<P>
"There is no definition of performance poetry, and it varies from region to 
region," Logue said. "We hope to create a definition for this region." 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the Poets Reading competition was actually imported by a Minnesota 
poet. But the organization created its own rules, and Logue admitted that he 
didn't know what to expect Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Would a performance poetry competition attract performance artists reading 
poetry by other writers or poets performing their own work? 
</P>
<P>
The contestants ran the gamut. Most poets read from their own work, dramatizing 
slightly rather than performing. Themes ranged from the mundane -- Saturday 
morning on line at the post office -- to the sublime. Love, sexuality, death 
and alienation made regular appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some presentations were definitely influenced by performance art. Vicki 
Manis of Fullerton stepped up in a lavender hoop skirt to present her piece on 
failed love. 
</P>
<P>
As she closed, she reached beneath her shawl for something hidden. After an 
uncomfortable struggle, Manis yanked out a bloody beef heart, and slammed it to 
the floor with a thudding splat: 
</P>
<P>
. . . The only ones I've had are bad 
</P>
<P>
Are there any good men to be had? 
</P>
<P>
Though the performances were uneven, the judges said they were impressed and 
surprised at the writing talent the event attracted. Webb and his fellow jurors 
-- poet and UC Irvine professor Robert Peters and Antonia Smolen, instructor of 
oral interpretation at Cal State Fullerton -- judged harshly. 
</P>
<P>
Performance, content and overall presentation were weighted equally, with a 
total of 90 points possible. Most contestants hovered in the 40s. One aspiring 
Charles Bukowski received an 8. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, (evaluating) poetry is like judging apples and oranges," Webb 
admitted. "It is really difficult to set poems up against each other because 
poems have such different objectives." 
</P>
<P>
The contest made some audience members into new fans of Orange County culture. 
John deFelice of Costa Mesa said that he usually does not attend poetry events 
but that Saturday's competition could make him a convert. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect to see the Super Bowl of poetry," deFelice said. 
</P>
<P>
He also said he didn't expect an intellectually stimulating event to be on a 
local entertainment calendar because in Orange County you "tone your pocketbook 
during the week and tone your body during the weekend." 
</P>
<P>
"A huge segment of the population is sick and tired of brainless 
entertainment," said Logue, explaining the growing support for poetry events. 
"The time is ripe. . . . Poet's Reading Inc. is simply filling a void that is 
ready to be filled." 
</P>
<P>
But Lee Mallory, poet and English instructor at Rancho Santiago College, 
explained poetry's new-found popularity in loftier terms. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the poet these days is filling a spiritual gap," Mallory said. "Poetry 
is providing a way for people to get back in touch with their basic truths." 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the attention to their art doesn't matter, said Robert Odom, who 
won second place for his poems "Careful Men" and "This Body Is Sacred." 
</P>
<P>
Poetry "can pass out of popular fashion," he said, "but it can't be a fad. And 
even if it is, I don't care because we'll pick up some recruits here." 
</P>
<P>
After terming Saturday's event a "resounding success," Logue said there is 
enough demand to make the event semiannual. 
</P>
<P>
"What we really want to have happen," he said, "is to have people say, 'Poetry 
is fun? A festive atmosphere? Beer and wine on the patio? Maybe we should go 
check out a poetry reading.' "

COSTA MESA MAYOR JOINS THE CRITICS OF NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR ARTS

Mayor Peter F. Buffa sided with critics of the embattled National Endowment for 
the Arts during a heated discussion Monday night over First Amendment issues 
and freedom of expression that emerged as part of a lengthy City Council debate 
over city arts grants. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel strongly there is a place for government support of the arts," said 
Buffa, who put forth an unsuccessful motion Monday to increase the city's 
$175,000 arts budget to $300,000 over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
But the 25-year-old NEA, which has recently come under siege for funding a few 
artworks deemed by some to be obscene or sacrilegious, could stand to change, 
Buffa said. He said he does not support the position of several arts groups, 
including South Coast Repertory, that the federal agency should be reauthorized 
for another five years without restrictions on the content of artworks it 
subsidizes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the NEA is an organization that has been poorly managed . . . and has 
made some outrageous funding decisions," said Buffa, noting his ideological 
allegiance with Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita), who wants to impose 
far-reaching restrictions on NEA-supported works and who has advocated 
eliminating the agency's entire budget. 
</P>
<P>
"Rohrabacher is someone I work together with closely and meet with often," 
Buffa said. "I disagree with the position that the NEA should go along with no 
changes." ZAN DUBIN

PLAY ANALYZES THE CONFLICTS THAT SPLIT UP JUNG AND FREUD 
</P>

<P>
Imagine a day in the lives of Freud and Jung in which the gods of 
psychoanalysis fall down from their pedestals to squabble like ordinary men. 
</P>
<P>
What a revenge fantasy, especially for a female patient who, admittedly, has 
felt at the mercy of both. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, the patient is also a playwright. And the experts stalking her 
consciousness are none other than Sigmund Freud, the father of psychoanalysis, 
and his star pupil, Carl Jung, the guru of analytic psychology. 
</P>
<P>
Playwright Lynne Kaufman, who reveals in the program biography her own 
experience with couch time, depicts a watershed day in which Jung wars with his 
wife -- and with Freud -- in her play "The Couch," now playing at the North 
Coast Repertory Theatre through July 21. 
</P>
<P>
It's a minor, odd, but intriguing little play, nicely produced by the North 
Coast, which has an affinity for the sort of offbeat, provoking piece that 
sends you home thinking -- even if you don't agree with its precepts. 
</P>
<P>
What makes "The Couch" minor, ultimately, are the simplifications that abound 
in Kaufman's attempts to assert that Jung's inability to commit to Freud's 
theories was equivalent to his inability to be monogamous with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Jung wants "roads, not fences," as he says in the play. He wants to affirm 
life's urges in all their shapes and forms, not repress them for the greater 
good, as Freud advises. 
</P>
<P>
In this scenario, Freud comes across as an inflexible old man, terribly 
threatened at the idea that Jung, his star protege and heir apparent, was 
planning to challenge his theories. 
</P>
<P>
What's missing is the tragic dimension of Freud fighting for his life, rather 
than just his ego. Is it paranoid for Moby Dick to fret about Ahab being out to 
get him? 
</P>
<P>
Was it unreasonable or prescient of Freud, skeptical of religion and 
civilization, to feel threatened by the pro-religious, pro-German Jung falling 
out with him in 1913, when, 25 years later, Freud found himself labeled guilty 
of being Jewish in a rising tide of Nazism? 
</P>
<P>
Before he died in exile in England, his books were among the first to be burned 
by the Nazis as the fruits of a "Jewish science." 
</P>
<P>
But Kaufman blocks out the world outside Jung's house to concentrate on the 
dynamics of two real events fictionalized as happening on the same day: the 
time Jung broke from Freud and broke from even the appearance of conventional 
monogamy, living openly with his wife and mistress with his wife's consent. 
</P>
<P>
A talented cast aids director Olive Blakistone in this tricky mix. Susana Moore 
is consistently funny as the acerbic, deadpanning Mrs. Jung. Stina Sundberg is 
lovely, sometimes breathtakingly so, as the mistress (although she comes across 
more as histrionic vamp than as the intellectually gifted helpmate she is 
described as being in the play). 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla Country Day School eighth-grader Rachael Lawrence is invigorating as 
Jung's precocious teen-ager who seeks to charm her father by making up 
imaginative phallic dreams. Gary Seger brings out the frailty under the 
imperiousness of Freud, and Ocie Robinson brings heft, though not complete 
elucidation, to Jung -- by far the most emotionally complex characterization in 
the play. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard Harland's set design is warm, inviting and inventive, as are Ocie 
Robinson's additional scenic choices and lighting design. Sound designer Marvin 
Read's choice of classical piano pieces softens the mood, though more could be 
done to suggest the sounds of the countryside where the Jungs live. 
</P>
<P>
The play is not deep or cutting enough to change the way anyone may think, but 
it does make you think -- not only about the life of the mind and the spirit 
and civilization itself -- but about the North Coast Rep as a quality podium on 
which playwrights can air an alternative viewpoint such as this. 
</P>

JANITORS PROTEST AIRPORT FIRINGS; 
</P>
<P>
NEW CLEANING CONTRACTOR CUTS MANY WORKERS; UNION PICKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
About 50 janitors picketed at San Diego International Airport Saturday, Monday 
and Tuesday, protesting what they say are "anti-worker, anti-union" hiring 
practices that have cost them their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
World Service Inc., a Houston-based business, took over a contract to provide 
cleaning service for the airport Sunday, and most of the former contractor's 
employees say that the new company fired them without cause. 
</P>
<P>
"We have members who have been working there for more than 10 years -- and now 
they're out of a job," said Sabino Lopez, a field representative for Local 102 
of the Service Employees International Union. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez and Eliseo Medina, the union's chapter president, allege that World 
Service released those employees with plans to break up the union. 
</P>
<P>
"This company's method of operations is to come in, fire the current employees, 
and lower wage rates," Medina said. "Basically, this is an employer who is 
anti-worker, anti-union." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Mrozewski, the company's vice president, disagreed. He said the conflict 
with the union arose because World Service refused to unconditionally accept 
all of the former employees to fill its payroll. 
</P>
<P>
"We generally have had discussions with the union over the last four or five 
weeks," Mrozewski said. "I sat with their employees for two days, taking 
applications. The union wanted us to take every employee as it stood." 
</P>
<P>
World Service hired 17 janitors who had worked for the former contractor, 
Menzies International California, Mrozewski said, adding that the other 
employees had technically not been fired. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot fire somebody if I haven't hired them," Mrozewski said. 
</P>
<P>
The director of the San Diego Unified Port District defended World Service and 
downplayed the seriousness of the janitors' complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no requirement that the new contractor keep the personnel hired by the 
old contractor," said Donald Nay, the port's director. "Those employees don't 
have any right to be hired. The contractor is entitled to hire whoever he wants 
to hire." 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Port Commissioners, the body that oversees operations at Lindbergh 
Field, decided last month to award the cleaning contract to World Service after 
receiving a number of complaints about the cleanliness of the airport, Nay 
said. 
</P>
<P>
World Service submitted a bid for the contract that was slightly higher than 
the amount Menzies charged last year, said David Rippberger, a purchasing agent 
for the district. 
</P>
<P>
The contract World Service accepted stipulates that the company must pay all 
janitorial workers a flat rate of $5.93 per hour, Rippberger said. 
</P>
<P>
But Medina said he thought the company might try to circumvent that provision 
by farming out the work to subcontractors or having fewer people do more work. 
</P>
<P>
As evidence of his charges, Medina cited newspaper clippings about a clash 
between World Service and a service workers union in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Those clippings detail a 1983 case in which union leaders accused the company 
of firing unionized janitors at San Francisco International Airport and 
replacing them. 
</P>
<P>
Mrozewski said the company settled that dispute, after a protracted court 
battle, by paying compensation to some of the displaced union employees. 
</P>
<P>
"The ownership and management is completely different now," Mrozewski said. "We 
have not had any problems in the past four or five years." 
</P>
<P>
Nay said that controversy happened too long ago to factor into the decision to 
hire World Service at the San Diego airport. 
</P>
<P>
"The ownership of the business may have changed," Nay said. And "lots of 
businesses have union problems." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lopez said another round of picketing is planned for Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Union representatives also plan to appeal to the Board of Port Commissioners at 
its July 10 meeting, Medina said. 
</P>
<P>
At that meeting, the union representatives will try to convince commissioners 
that hiring World Service has interfered with the smooth operation of the 
airport -- a breach of the company's contract, Medina said. 
</P>
<P>
But Nay said the operation of the airport had not been disrupted during the 
first days that World Service's workers have been on the job, in spite of the 
picketing. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is going quite smoothly," Nay said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, World Service's hiring plans came as a shock to some former employees. 
</P>
<P>
Elvia Jimenez, a single mother of two, said she had no reason to think she 
would be fired when she and fellow janitorial workers met with a company 
representative a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
The janitors knew World Service was taking over the contract beginning Sunday, 
but before that meeting, none of them knew that they would be unemployed this 
week, Jimenez said. 
</P>
<P>
"The World Service man told us that we were all going to keep our jobs," said 
Jimenez, who worked at the airport the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
The representative also told the janitors he would return the next day and make 
the necessary arrangements to keep them on the payroll, Jimenez said. 
</P>
<P>
"He never did," Jimenez said. "He brought in his own people -- he got rid of 
us."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; 
</P>
<P>
COUNTY'S FLAG IS IN GOOD HANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Civic Center Plaza in Santa Ana, normally a hubbub of activity, has not yet 
come to life when Morris Elmore begins his day. 
</P>
<P>
It's often still dark outside and there are usually hundreds of the city's 
homeless sleeping on the ground as Elmore, 49, raises the American flag outside 
the county's Hall of Administration building. It's a job he's had for more than 
19 years and one, he says, he takes great pride in. 
</P>
<P>
The current national debate over flag burning strikes a nerve with Elmore, a 
Santa Ana resident who lives with his wife and two daughters and served in 
Vietnam in 1967-68. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they should allow flag burning, period," Elmore said. "I think 
it's just crazy and can't see any reason why anybody would want to burn a flag. 
Some people want to break the rules no matter what they are." 
</P>
<P>
Elmore, a lead custodian for the county, said he wishes people would show more 
respect for Old Glory. To him, an offense that's almost as bad as burning a 
flag is stealing one -- something that happened quite often when the flag was 
still raised at the Old Courthouse, a historical building on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
"Once they moved the flag to the Hall of Administration, we didn't have that 
problem anymore because there are so many people around the area," Elmore said. 
"It would be really tough to steal a flag now." 
</P>
<P>
Elmore currently shares flag-raising duties with two other custodians. The crew 
tries to have the flag up by 7 a.m. each day. Usually, Elmore personally raises 
the banner first thing when he reports in at 6 a.m. But, at times, there are 
unavoidable delays. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, we had a flood in the courthouse one morning and had to get rid of all 
the water before we could hang the flag," he said. "The flag is very important 
but we have our priorities sometimes. We couldn't leave water on the ground and 
be responsible for somebody slipping and falling." 
</P>
<P>
Although postal workers carry on through rain, sleet or snow, the American flag 
does not. 
</P>
<P>
"The minute it starts to rain, we go out and take the flag down right away," 
Elmore said. Elmore said flags last an average of six months before they need 
to be replaced. There are also days when Elmore must make a second trip out to 
the flagpole to adjust the flag to half-staff. 
</P>
<P>
Evening crews normally take town the county flag around 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm patriotic, I think, more than most people," Elmore said. "After being in 
the war, it's a special feeling to raise that flag." GREG HERNANDEZ

TENANTS' VICTORY: 'LESSON TO LANDLORDS'; 
</P>
<P>
DISPUTE: IT TOOK TIME AND PATIENCE, SAY MOBILE HOME DWELLERS WHO WON A 
SETTLEMENT FROM THE PARK OWNER, BUT THEY WOULD DO IT ALL AGAIN.

SANTA ANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the eight years her family has lived at the Aloha Palms Trailer Park in 
Costa Mesa, Julia Jimenez said, they have endured sewage running down the 
streets because of broken pipes, water leaking through their roofs and 
cockroaches crawling about their home. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, she and 10 other tenants who recently won a $230,000 settlement 
from mobile park owner Rubidoux Partnership, held a news conference in Santa 
Ana to say that their fight to improve squalid conditions took time and 
patience, but that they would do it all over again. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this is a lesson to other landlords that we are humans and we have 
rights too," said Jimenez, one of the organizers of a rent strike three years 
ago that eventually led to the lawsuit against the park owners. "If they had 
made the improvements when we first complained, we would not have gone to 
court. 
</P>
<P>
"It took a lot of time, but I would do it all again for my kids," said Jimenez, 
a mother of three. "This is really about them." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Spix, a lawyer with the nonprofit Hermandad Mexicana Nacional Legal 
Center, which represented the tenants, said this settlement is part of a 
growing trend in Orange County to hold landlords accountable for squalid 
conditions on their properties. The legal center is also involved in lawsuits 
against Santa Ana landlord Carmine Esposito, who is being sued by 70 tenants. 
On Monday, after a five-year legal struggle, Esposito agreed to pay one tenant 
$19,000. The other cases are still pending. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for Rubidoux said this settlement clears the way for much-needed 
improvements to the Aloha park. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very, very happy with the settlement," attorney Stephen Duringer said. 
"We feel it's fair to both sides." 
</P>
<P>
He said many of the problems at the park, at 133 E. 16th Street in Costa Mesa, 
were created when it was under its previous ownership, and Rubidoux inherited 
the tenants' ire. 
</P>
<P>
"The park is a bad park," he said. "The current owners purchased it in 1988 
with the specific purpose of rehabilitating it. A month later, the rent strike 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the Hermandad legal center represented 28 tenants but several of 
them moved away or abandoned the action. The 11 who are left will share the 
$230,000 in compensation for what they have had to endure, Spix said. 
</P>
<P>
At Aloha Palms, tenants live in park-owned mobile homes that are about 30 years 
old, Duringer said. As part of the settlement, the owners have agreed to 
rehabilitate the park and replace each mobile home with a new double-wide one. 
After the rehabilitation, rents will increase from $400 to $750 a month, still 
below market value, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Duringer, who specializes in landlord-tenant disputes, agreed that property 
owners are becoming more aware of their obligations to tenants and that tenants 
appear to be savvier about their rights. 
</P>
<P>
"Landlords are becoming more educated, much more responsible," he said. "But it 
works both ways. Tenants are finally realizing that there are certain things 
under their control. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"When cases like this go to litigation, no one really wins," he said. "The 
tenants live in conditions they really shouldn't live in. The owners are 
prevented from doing what they need to do as a business enterprise. Both sides 
probably could have handled it better in this case."

ASSESSING THE ASTONISHING IMPACT OF ROD SERLING'S 'TWILIGHT ZONE'; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: KTLA CHANNEL 5 PRESENTS ITS EIGHTH ANNUAL MARATHON OF THE VENERABLE 
HIT TODAY. SERLING'S WIDOW CALLS THE SHOW A 'COTTAGE INDUSTRY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW, TIMES TELEVISION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An almost legendary aura now surrounds "The Twilight Zone" and its creator, Rod 
Serling, and his widow says it's "a total surprise" to her, "as I'm sure it 
would have been to him." 
</P>
<P>
When KTLA Channel 5 presents its eighth annual Fourth of July "Twilight Zone 
Marathon" today -- 13 consecutive hours of the classic series starting at 9 
a.m. -- it will be yet another example of the show's astonishing impact from 
one generation to another. It was first broadcast three decades ago and ran 
from 1959 to 1964 on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
For Carol Serling, a straight-talking woman who married the writer in 1948 when 
both were students at Antioch College in Ohio, the reason for the special 
appeal of "The Twilight Zone" seems clear: 
</P>
<P>
"It has a lasting quality. If you watch it on July Fourth, even an hour of it, 
you'll see that those stories stand up very well. Most of it is quite timely. 
If they colorize it, I don't know what that's going to mean. They always talk 
about it, but I don't know whether they will or not. I'm not going to make a 
big fuss. But I think it would be a big mistake. The black-and-white look is 
part of the beautiful photography." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, she says, "There's an art book (of the series) coming out this fall" 
-- it is titled "Visions From the Twilight Zone" -- and, she notes, "It is 
still photographs taken right off the air." The compilation, by graphics 
designer Arlen Schumer, will be published in October by Chronicle Books of San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the single most lasting image of "The Twilight Zone" is that of Serling 
himself as narrator of the science-fiction anthology. Three decades later, he 
is still one of the great individual on-air stylists in the history of 
television, and his success in this role was also a surprise, says his widow. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it was an accident," she says. "He was the cheapest person to get. The 
story goes, and I have no reason to doubt it, that they wanted Orson Welles and 
Westbrook Van Voorhis (who had narrated 'The March of Time'). They did want 
someone of great stature. Welles was not available. He wanted too much money." 
</P>
<P>
In the definitive book about the series, "The Twilight Zone Companion," author 
Marc Scott Zicree quotes Bill Self, the CBS executive who oversaw the show, as 
saying Van Voorhis' big voice eventually was regarded as "too 
pompous-sounding." Self adds, "Finally, Rod himself made the suggestion that 
maybe he should do it. It was received with skepticism." 
</P>
<P>
Carol Serling, who lives in Pacific Palisades, said in a phone interview last 
week from a family home near Ithaca, N.Y.: "They didn't have the money to hire 
these other people who cost a lot. So Rod just sort of was there, and I think 
he was quite nervous in the beginning. He wasn't an actor, he was a writer. 
</P>
<P>
"To get up in front of the camera, I think, was very difficult for him. But as 
the years went by, he got more and more comfortable with it. But it really was 
an accident that it happened." 
</P>
<P>
Did he enjoy the role once he got into it? 
</P>
<P>
"I think he probably did. It changed his life somewhat in that people began to 
recognize him. Nobody ever recognizes a writer." 
</P>
<P>
Did he like being recognized? 
</P>
<P>
"Yes and no. I mean, it's wonderful not to be recognized and to be able to go 
and do exactly what you want, when you want, and not be bothered by people. But 
on the other hand, it's very flattering. And he knew that if that stopped, that 
meant that there was trouble there, too." 
</P>
<P>
But even with his fame as an on-air TV personality, she says, "I don't think he 
ever considered that that was his bailiwick at all. No. He never considered 
himself anything but a writer." 
</P>
<P>
And as for his tight-lipped, clenched-mouth TV persona, it was not, to his 
widow, an accurate image of the way he really was: 
</P>
<P>
"No. I don't think he ever looked like that in person. It may have been that 
when somebody suddenly comes to you and says, hey, you're going to do something 
-- well, think if it was you: You might do something that wouldn't be the way 
you really are. I can't answer any more than that." 
</P>
<P>
So what was he really like? 
</P>
<P>
"A very funny guy." 
</P>
<P>
Serling died 15 years ago last week. He was only 50, and considering what he 
accomplished on "The Twilight Zone" and as the playwright of such other 
important dramas as "Patterns" and "Requiem for a Heavyweight," there is no 
telling what further grand legacy he might have left in addition to his giant 
achievements for the young TV medium. 
</P>
<P>
"He was trying all the time," says Carol Serling. She recalls discussing his 
work with him over the years, "partially because of physical proximity -- he 
always worked at home. So if he felt there was something he was particularly 
proud of, or that he wanted to talk about, it was easy for him to pick up the 
sheet of paper and walk 50 yards and say, 'Hey, I've just done this.' " 
</P>
<P>
What was he proudest of? 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever he was working on. Looking back, 'The Twilight Zone' was only five 
years, and when it was over, I think he breathed a sigh of relief and was very 
happy to put it behind him. Oh, yeah. I think what he said was that he really 
felt he was beginning to meet himself coming around the corner. There are only 
so many ideas. And they did come easily to him and he wrote the scripts very 
quickly. But I think at the time, he was really written out." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the series has proven timeless. "It won't go away. It keeps bobbing up," 
says his widow, acknowledging that it's turned into a cottage industry, and not 
only in such television excursions as KTLA's annual "Twilight Zone" marathons 
on the Fourth of July and Thanksgiving Day. 
</P>
<P>
There was "Twilight Zone -- The Movie" in 1983 and a new CBS version of the 
series in 1985. And for nine years there was Twilight Zone Magazine, for which 
Carol Serling was consulting editor and associate publisher. 
</P>
<P>
"We went belly-up in June of 1989," she says. "Promotion was lacking, though we 
had a circulation of between 80,000 and 120,000. It was mostly a magazine of 
short stories, fiction in the genre of 'The Twilight Zone,' and we had some 
pretty heavy writers who contributed -- Joyce Carol Oates, Harlan Ellison, you 
name them. And in the beginning, there was some old TV memorabilia." 
</P>
<P>
In another act of homage, old friends of the "Twilight Zone" creator in his 
hometown of Binghamton, N.Y., formed the Rod Serling Foundation to keep his 
memory alive. But despite the ongoing fascination with the series and the 
writer, Carol Serling, a native of Columbus, Ohio, says, "Each year, I think, 
well, that's it -- and then something else turns up." 
</P>
<P>
"The latest thing we've done is that an educational publishing house called 
Sundance has come out with a ('Twilight Zone') video package for junior highs 
and high schools, with scripts and a teachers' guide. I think it would be used 
mostly in English and drama. I oversee it. The whole rationale is that young 
people should learn to watch television with critical thinking." 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the art book, "Visions From the Twilight Zone." It will include 
essays by both Rod and Carol Serling and producer Buck Houghton, as well as the 
entire script of one of the great episodes, "Eye of the Beholder," about a 
beautiful young woman who lives in a world where beauty is regarded as a 
horrible deformity. It is the first episode mentioned by Carol Serling when 
asked to name her favorites. 
</P>
<P>
Did it seem, back in college, that her husband -- who had enrolled just after 
serving as a paratrooper in World War II -- was already thinking of the things 
we remember him by? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, at Antioch," she says, "you spend a lot of your matriculating time off 
on a job in the field that you're studying. So his jobs were all, at that time, 
in radio stations, where he'd do just about anything that was needed -- on-air 
work, continuity, writing advertising, writing some scripts, acting in some. He 
worked in Binghamton, New York City, Springfield, Ohio, and other places in 
Ohio. We graduated in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Rod would have been one of the first to say he hit the new industry, 
television, at exactly the right time. During the years at college, he started 
writing radio scripts. He won a prize for the 'Dr. Christian' show, which was 
really very exciting. And he had a couple of sales to another radio program, 
'Grand Central Station.' But it didn't seem clear that would be the way he'd 
go. The first job he got out of school was as continuity writer at (radio 
station) WLW in Cincinnati.

"He worked there for over a year before he could free-lance. At that point, he 
was really working on television scripts. As I say, in 1951 and 1952, the new 
industry was grabbing up a lot of material and needed it. It was a very 
propitious time to be graduating from school and getting ready to find a 
profession."

Many conductors are worried that the niceties of playing Baroque music are 
properly vanishing into the mists of time. Evans Haile has similar fears about 
the American musical. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of wonderful material -- shows by Gershwin, Victor Herbert and 
others -- that is not being done," Haile said from his home in New York. "I do 
not think these are museum pieces or can only be done one way. But I believe 
very strongly there are valid reasons for hearing them." 
</P>
<P>
An example is Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart's 1937 musical, "Babes in Arms," 
which Haile resurrected in its original form last year in New York and has 
recently recorded. Haile will conduct selections from the show on a program of 
American music played by the Pacific Symphony today at 8 p.m. at Irvine Meadows 
Amphitheatre. The program will also include music by Sousa, Gershwin, Victor 
Herbert and others, and will end with a fireworks display. 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of the Juilliard School of Music in New York, Haile said that, in 
his case, "necessity was the mother of invention." 
</P>
<P>
Haile and a friend formed a company to produce a series of concerts at Town 
Hall in New York in 1981-86. 
</P>
<P>
"When you first get out of school, you want to work," he said. "It was a 
practical decision from that end. Our idea was to re-create these shows the way 
the creators had envisioned them. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of shows where the original orchestrations and original 
material had been lost and had to be reconstructed. It's not an unwise thing to 
take a look at these. The orchestrations give evidence of the period. They were 
so clearly done and so wittily done. They can clue you into why a lot of these 
shows did work." 
</P>
<P>
Other discoveries included changes in the "original routing of the numbers, or 
what key someone is singing in, or even what characters do the numbers." 
</P>
<P>
"Don't forget that a lot of these shows in (later) productions, after the 
composers died, were given in cut-down productions," Haile said. "The point of 
our series in Town Hall was to do them with the full resources as they 
originally had thought them out. If the chorus was 45, we had them." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, shows changed in the tryouts given in other cities before moving on 
to the Big Apple and Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
"If a song was cut from a show, that doesn't mean you should put it back in," 
Haile said. "Theater pieces are living, breathing animals that you mold and you 
shape. But I think opera is the same way. Like Verdi's 'Masked Ball' or 
Wagner's 'Tannhauser,' there are different editions. You have to make decisions 
(which to use). It's the same with these pieces. I do think there is a validity 
to see what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
At the Pacific concert, Haile will be both the conductor and the piano soloist 
for Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue." In keeping with the patriotic theme -- and 
also as a touring artist for Baldwin pianos -- Haile will be playing on a red, 
white and blue piano. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more tasteful than it sounds," he said. "The piano is red-and-white 
striped, with a blue interior. . . . Actually it is quite handsome, for a red, 
white and blue piano. It's very befitting for an outdoor concert." 
</P>
<P>
Still, despite his fame in American musicals, Haile also has a "serious music" 
side to his career. He, for instance, conducted a Wagner "Ring" cycle for the 
Seattle Opera in 1984, 1986 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate (being called) a 'specialist in music of the American musical,' " Haile 
said. "I don't read just one author's books or eat one type of food. Nor do 
most people. And I think that anyone who is aware of the world is going to be 
open to the world and aware of the whole variety, open to what's going on in 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
"Good music is good music, whether it's by Rodgers and Hart or Wagner. It's 
music that has withstood the test of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Evans Haile will conduct the Pacific Symphony in a program of music by 
American composers today at 8 p.m. at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre, 8800 Irvine 
Center Drive, Irvine. Judy Balzer will be soprano soloist. The concert will end 
with fireworks. Tickets: $10.50 to $37.50. Lawn seating: $8.50. Information: 
(714) 474-4233.

RENNY HARLIN FINDS PLENTY OF ACTION IN HOLLYWOOD; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: WITH 'DIE HARD 2' AND 'FORD FAIRLANE' OPENING ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY, 
THE FINNISH DIRECTOR OF ADVENTURE FILMS IS TAKING THE INDUSTRY BY STORM. 
</P>

<P>
Director Renny Harlin wants to make one thing perfectly clear. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what you've read," he said with the trace of an accent, "but I 
never told anybody that I'm the Finnish Steven Spielberg." He faintly glowered 
at the thought of this presumption on his lips. "That's following me, that 
curse. I don't know where it started. I've never said anything that silly." 
</P>
<P>
Others may have suggested it if he hasn't, or they soon will. Harlin is hardly 
an American household name yet, but with two major-studio films coincidentally 
opening a scant week apart -- the sure blockbuster "Die Hard 2" today, followed 
by a gamble, "The Adventures of Ford Fairlane," next Wednesday -- he will soon 
benefit from name repetition. 
</P>
<P>
Not that either picture is likely to inspire a Renny Harlin retrospective at 
Cannes or the Museum of Modern Art. "Ford Fairlane," featuring the film debut 
of shock-comic Andrew Dice Clay as a private eye who looks and talks like 
shock-comic Andrew Dice Clay, is particularly lowbrow fare. "Die Hard 2" is 
just what it is, a slick, expensive action film that is high on thrills and low 
on logic. 
</P>
<P>
But both show the sure-handedness of a director seemingly far more experienced 
than Harlin. Some are predicting that "Die Hard 2" may even turn out to be the 
biggest box-office hit of the summer -- making this 31-year-old immigrant the 
hottest Hollywood property that no one has heard of yet. 
</P>
<P>
Hottest and most expensive. Harlin is earning $3 million to direct his next 
film, "Gale Force," a suspense thriller to be produced later this year from a 
Joe Eszter has screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more impressive than the movies themselves is the fact that they were 
made back-to-back, with no breathing room between them, by Harlin and much of 
the same crew under the aegis of producer Joel Silver. The young director tends 
to come off as cool and collected as Silver is notoriously loud and agitated. 
It's easy to envision them complementing each other in comic tag-team fashion. 
And when Silver approached him with the unthinkable last fall, Harlin didn't 
flinch. 
</P>
<P>
"Near the end of shooting 'Fairlane,' Joel gave me a script," said Harlin in 
his office on the 20th Century Fox lot. "It was called '58 Minutes.' I read it 
and liked it a lot, so I asked, 'What is this?' And he said it was 'Die Hard 
2.' I said, 'Oh, who's directing it?' And he said 'You.' And I said, 'Really? 
Like, next year?' He said, 'Well, next week, basically.' He was very strong in 
his will about it." 
</P>
<P>
The story behind the story is that Joe Roth, the new production boss at Fox, 
had decided to order a sequel for this summer, and production needed to begin 
immediately to meet that deadline. Luckily, the studio had optioned Walter 
Wager's short novel, "58 Minutes," and a script that was already on hand was 
rapidly rehauled into a sequel that fit the Bruce Willis character. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a week after wrapping up production on one film, Harlin was filming his 
next. Not only did he work on editing "Fairlane" at night and on weekends while 
filming "Die Hard," but he also started editing the latter, he says, from the 
first day of shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"It was funny sometimes, going back and forth from one editing room to the 
other. I would sit down and look at the material and say, 'oh god, this is 
really too silly. I don't know if this is going to work.' And then I would 
realize it was 'Ford Fairlane' that I was looking at, not 'Die Hard,' and 
(comedy) was appropriate. . . . It was a tough year." 
</P>
<P>
It got tougher. "Die Hard 2," which takes place at Christmas, was supposed to 
be filmed at an airport in Denver, but the weather looked more like spring when 
the crew arrived, setting off a frantic and often fruitless search for snowier 
climes. 
</P>
<P>
"The end sequence is set in one place in the movie, but it was shot in eight 
locations," noted Harlin. "We started in Denver, lost the snow; went to Moses 
Lake, Washington, lost the snow in one day; went to Michigan, lost the snow in 
a few days; went to the border of Canada, lost the snow in two days. 
</P>
<P>
"So we came to L.A. and refrigerated three stages, brought the airplanes and 
helicopters inside, rebuilt the entire church -- which was originally a 
location in Denver -- on the set. But we didn't get everything; I needed wider 
shots. Went to Lake Tahoe, the only place left with snow at that point, and 
shot there for two nights." 
</P>
<P>
Harlin oversaw a crew of 350, about 70 of whom were employed to create a white 
Christmas -- using plastic snow indoors, and biodegradable soap flakes and 
potato flakes outside. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the delays and cost overruns from moving that crew from state to 
state -- with final budget estimates as high as $60 million, though Harlin 
claims it was lower -- he says he never thought too much about the prospect of 
fumbling the project and being remembered as the man who killed the "Die Hard" 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
"It was intimidating in the beginning. But I never thought, 'This is too big, I 
can't do this.' I'm fairly experienced with effects and opticals and stunts, 
because every one of my pictures has had those elements. I realized that now, 
with a budget, I can really show what I can do -- and if I screw up, I'll be 
killed. I'll be thrown into movie jail and never let out." 
</P>
<P>
Harlin remembers being a movie buff at age 5 back in Finland, creating 
cinematic realms in his imagination and pretending his parents and friends were 
supporting characters to his leading role. At the age of 15, he told pals he 
wanted to be a director -- not just any kind of director, but an American movie 
director. 
</P>
<P>
After a stint in a Finnish film school, all 12 of his feature-length scripts 
were turned down by the all-important Finnish Film Foundation. The rejections 
gave him just the impetus he needed to come to the States, where he managed to 
put together financing for an ill-inspired 1986 action picture called "Born 
American." 
</P>
<P>
Producer Irwin Yablans subsequently hired him to direct "Prison," and in what 
he considers his biggest break, New Line President Robert Shea brought him on 
board for "A Nightmare on Elm Street IV," which proved to be the most 
profitable sequel in the series. 
</P>
<P>
Producer Walter Hill was impressed enough by that to sign Harlin for Fox's 
"Alien III," on which he labored for a year. Having abandoned that project, 
which is still in search of a workable script, he was quickly landed by Fox for 
"Ford Fairlane." 
</P>
<P>
If Harlin seems to have suddenly become the golden boy of studio directing, his 
conscience continues to nudge him toward more significant work, he says. Does 
the Finnish Spielberg -- so far typecast as an action-oriented director -- have 
a "Color Purple" or "Empire of the Sun" in his future? 
</P>
<P>
"I've gotten to the point now where I can choose what I'm going to do. I want 
to use my talent for something that has a purpose, that somehow justifies my 
existence and my right to use money and be part of the biggest mass media in 
the world. . . . One of the projects that I'm developing to direct is about the 
environment and the ozone layer and about nuclear weapons and whales and 
dolphins and everything. I want to do movies that say something."
