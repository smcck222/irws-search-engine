A Capitol Assist in Label Wars: Capitol Records has promised to provide legal 
help to retailers threatened with arrest for selling recordings that bear 
labels warning consumers of sexually explicit lyrics. "The music industry has 
proven its willingness to address the issue of explicit material through our 
use of voluntary, uniform stickers," Capitol President Hale Milgrim said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
"However, it is becoming evident that other forces see stickering as an excuse 
to censor artists. This is intolerable and a violation of the First Amendment." 
Milgrim said that some retailers are afraid to order recordings with the 
stickers. Capitol will start issuing a label of a different kind: "Retailers: 
Capitol Records vehemently opposes censorship of artistic expression and will 
assist in the defense of any attempt to stop the legitimate sale of this 
LP-CD-cassette." GREG BRAXTON

Boycott Against Lang Beefs Up: More radio stations in the farm states of 
Minnesota, Nebraska and Iowa are joining the boycott of Grammy-winning singer 
k.d. lang because of her appearance in a "Meat Stinks" advertising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Radio station KRVN in Lexington, Neb., had previously banned the singer because 
of the commercials. Patrick John, program director of KSUM-AM in Fairmont, 
Minn., said that his station won't play lang's music until she disavows People 
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which put together the campaign. KSRB-AM 
in Sioux Falls, S.D., tried a different approach -- it gave away filet mignon 
to callers each time it played one of lang's songs Tuesday. GREG BRAXTON

Saul Zaentz Says No to Czech Festival: Producer Saul Zaentz has declined an 
invitation by Czechoslovakia's Karlovy Vary International Film Festival to show 
his "The Unbearable Lightness of Being," the 1988 Philip Kaufman-directed film, 
based on the novel by Czech expatriate Milan Kundera. The movie dramatizes the 
erotic encounters of a surgeon, set against the backdrop of the Soviet invasion 
of the Czech capital of Prague in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Berkeley-based Zaentz, according to a report in the San Francisco Chronicle, 
said that the chief of the Czech film office, Jiri Janousek, was of no help at 
all when Zaentz and crew wanted to shoot exteriors for "Unbearable" in Prague. 
At the time, Kundera and his novel were banned in Czechoslovakia. Now that the 
Czech government has changed, Zaentz accused Janousek of wanting to show the 
film as a way "to impress" the new, liberal government of Vaclav Havel, and to 
secure his position with it. GREG BRAXTON

YOU ASKED ABOUT: PUTTING PANS TO THE HOT-SPOT TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Is there a way to test a pan for hot spots? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: "The quickest and surest method we know is to pour a uniform layer of 
four or five tablespoons of sugar mixed with a couple of tablespoons of water 
into the pan, then turn the heat to a low-to-medium setting and wait for the 
sugar to start to caramelize," says Howard Hillman, author of "Kitchen Science" 
(Houghton Mifflin Co., 1981). "If the pan has no hot spots, the sugar will 
caramelize evenly. If the pan has hot spots, the sugar directly over them will 
caramelize first, forming a pattern that maps your pan's hot spots. 
</P>
<P>
"If you discover that your pots have hot spots and you do not wish to replace 
the equipment, you can minimize the defect by using as low a heat setting as 
possible or by using a heat diffuser," says Hillman. 
</P>
<P>

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: ANALYZING DIETARY LINKS TO ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You're introduced to someone new, but before you complete the handshake you've 
forgotten her name. Or you spend a good part of your day searching for "lost" 
items -- car keys, eyeglasses, a pen. All of us experience occasional lapses of 
memory and may joke that we're "getting Alzheimer's." In most cases we simply 
haven't been paying attention and focusing on the task at hand. 
</P>
<P>
But for the million or more victims of Alzheimer's disease in the United States 
and their families, this condition is no laughing matter, and it involves a 
great deal more than just inattention. 
</P>
<P>
Alzheimer's is a progressive neurological disorder in which nerve pathways that 
carry messages within the brain become tangled and blocked by plaques. The 
production of certain chemicals, known as neurotransmitters, used by nerve 
cells to communicate with each other, is reduced. When normal nerve signals 
can't be relayed, depression, delusions, agitation, weight loss and changes in 
memory, may result. 
</P>
<P>
Although more prevalent in older people, Alzheimer's is sometimes seen in 
persons younger than 50. Since it frequently occurs in families and in those 
with Down's syndrome who live past 40, a genetic component is suspected. 
</P>
<P>
Fear of the enormous physical and psychological toll that this disease exacts 
has spawned numerous nutrition practices that claim to help prevent onset or 
minimize symptoms. One compound that has received attention is choline. 
Contrary to some claims, choline is not a vitamin for humans under normal 
circumstances. Our livers are able to make enough to meet our needs. Additional 
choline is also found in foods such as milk, egg yolks, dried beans and peas, 
and foods containing lecithin. 
</P>
<P>
As its name suggests, choline is a component of the neurotransmitter 
acetcylcholine, as well as of certain cell structures, so it's not absurd to 
speculate that supplements might help reduce symptoms of Alzheimer's. 
Unfortunately, most research shows that supplementing the diets of Alzheimer's 
patients with either choline or lecithin produces scant improvement in memory 
and may aggravate depression. 
</P>
<P>
While many persons fearful of Alzheimer's have been popping choline and 
lecithin supplements, others have been attempting to purge their diets of the 
mineral aluminum. Humans have no known nutritional requirement for aluminum. 
But as the third most common element in the earth's crust, it is widely 
available in most grains and vegetables and in drinking water, with small 
quantities occurring in animal products. 
</P>
<P>
Aluminum-containing compounds are often used as food additives and may be found 
in food colorings and certain brands of salt and baking powder. Aluminum foil 
and cookware may also serve as sources of aluminum in food, although in most 
cases the aluminum contamination is minimal. Larger quantities may leach into 
food when tomato dishes such as spaghetti sauce or chili are simmered for hours 
in aluminum pots -- although the total amount the food might contain still 
remains low. 
</P>
<P>
For some, the greatest source of aluminum may be aluminum-containing antacids 
and buffered pain relievers, which may provide 50 times the amount obtained 
from foods. Still, most evidence suggests that healthy people generally can 
eliminate most dietary aluminum long before toxic effects set in. 
</P>
<P>
The real concern shouldn't be how much aluminum we consume but rather if it is 
contributing to Alzheimer's disease. Here the evidence is incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers have shown that high levels of aluminum in the blood can accumulate 
in the brain, producing a type of encephalopathy, or brain disorder. Recently, 
this type of condition has been seen in kidney patients receiving 
aluminum-containing antacids to help prevent bone disease. In the past, kidney 
patients undergoing dialysis, a procedure that mimics the role of kidneys by 
cleansing the blood of wastes, were at risk since the dialysis process also 
contaminated the blood with aluminum. In this case, when the kidneys are 
impaired, aluminum clearly produces toxic effects. 
</P>
<P>
But analysis of brains of Alzheimer's victims for aluminum accumulation has 
produced conflicting results. While some researchers have found high amounts of 
aluminum in the characteristic nerve tangles, this finding has been disputed. 
And even if scientists were confident that brain aluminum levels are elevated 
in Alzheimer's, no one knows which comes first, high aluminum or the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Some suspect that the degenerative changes taking place within the nerve cells 
of Alzheimer's patients actually promote aluminum buildup in the cells. Others 
speculate that aluminum may be involved in plaque development, since 
aluminum-containing compounds have been found at the core of these plaques, or 
that aluminum somehow contributes to the nerve-cell snarls. Obviously, more 
research is needed before the precise role of aluminum in Alzheimer's can be 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, you might wonder what you should do about aluminum cookware. The 
answer is, cook with it. And as always, cook nutritious wholesome foods. If 
you're really convinced your memory is slipping, see a doctor. But for most of 
us, forgetting at least part of what we should remember is a normal feature of 
everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
Question: I suffer terribly from stomach gas shortly after I eat. Are there any 
dietary steps I can take to help control it? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The biggest culprits include large, calorie-laden meals, and fatty 
foods in particular, since they slow the rate at which foods leave the stomach. 
Carbonated beverages and chewing gum are also better set aside. In addition to 
all the other problems it causes, smoking is linked to increased air swallowing 
and gas production. If you've experienced symptoms commonly referred to as 
"heartburn," avoid fatty foods, alcohol, chocolate and pepper. 
</P>
<P>
You might also find some relief by modifying your eating behavior. If you tend 
to be a rapid eater, slow down. And while it's important to drink plenty of 
fluids, limit the amount with which you wash down food. 
</P>
<P>
Medications are sometimes used to reduce carbon dioxide production, but this is 
something you should discuss with a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is there any evidence that development of diabetes is influenced by either 
the composition of the diet or levels of physical activity, or by some 
combination of the two? 
</P>
<P>
A: Studies have failed to find a consistent link between the composition of the 
diet and diabetes development. In part, this may be explained by the difficulty 
in obtaining accurate dietary information. Beyond that, unfortunately, many of 
the studies that have explored the question have failed to take into account 
the numerous other factors that could explain differences in incidence of 
diabetes between two populations or within subgroups of the same population. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to physical activity, the picture is really no less certain, 
although such a relationship is biologically plausible. It's clear that 
exercise can modify the body's short-term ability to handle glucose and blood 
sugar. But there is only sparse and inconsistent evidence that long-term lack 
of exercise increases the risk of adult-onset diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
There are many reasons to argue for both a prudent diet -- rich in complex 
carbohydrates, low in fat, salt and sugar -- and for regular physical activity. 
But the question as to whether these measures can reduce the risk of 
adult-onset diabetes requires further research. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My daughter joined her high school swim team last semester. When I took her 
to the doctor, he discovered that she was anemic. Can the strenuous exercise 
also cause her problem? 
</P>
<P>
A: A recently reported small study of swimmers suggests a more direct 
explanation for your daughter's anemia: low iron intake. Investigators could 
find no evidence of changes in blood profiles at the end of a season of 
competition, suggesting that the muscular exercise of swimming does no damage 
to red blood cells. 
</P>
<P>
However, in that study, not one of the six women involved consumed even as much 
as 60% of the Recommended Dietary Allowances. Some consumed considerably less. 
Assessment of the relationship between iron intake and menstrual losses in 
these women indicated that about half of them simply were not taking adequate 
amounts to offset their losses.

ICEBERG LETTUCE: CRISPY FRIEND TO MANY FOODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARION CUNNINGHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If it could, iceberg lettuce would smile. Round and crisp, it is a perfect 
creation. Although its flavor is delicate, it is a sturdy creature, unlike some 
of the frail field lettuce that wilt, swoon and get the vapors. My dog Rover 
loves it, especially dunked in meat drippings; he wouldn't touch arugula with a 
10-foot pole. 
</P>
<P>
Iceberg lettuce is a close friend of every sandwich of note -- hamburger, 
peanut butter, cheese, club, tuna, deviled egg -- and there are no substitutes 
for the crunchy, pale-green leaves. Like Mark Twain, iceberg has some important 
continental connections, to Mandarin China (Minced Squab in Lettuce Leaves) and 
to France (the classic Petits Pois a la Francaise). Iceberg is equally at home 
on the table of an aristocrat or a peasant. Adaptable, always available, no 
better food friend exists. 
</P>
<P>
The following recipes are diverse and easily made at home. If squab isn't one 
of your basic kitchen ingredients, Minced Squab in Lettuce Leaves is equally 
good when made with chopped chicken. Petits Pois a la Francaise (freshly 
shelled peas cooked with iceberg lettuce and butter) lifts the garden pea to 
new heights. And the Iceberg Wedge, with thick creamy dressing, is still as 
great as a Caesar salad, when made properly. 
</P>
<P>
It is important to follow one step in preparing iceberg lettuce prior to use. 
Remove the core. Fill a large bowl or soup pot with cold water. Forcefully 
plunge the lettuce, cored end down, into the water. Now shake it free of excess 
water and wrap the head in several layers of toweling. (I use two layers of 
paper towels and cover them with a dish towel.) Refrigerate for at least six 
hours or overnight. 
</P>
<P>
The California Iceberg Lettuce Commission informs me that Crisp-head is the 
proper name for our iceberg lettuce. Last year, they say, 100 million cartons 
of lettuce were sold in this country (there are approximately 24 heads to a 
carton). They add that 15 billion salads were eaten, which is not surprising 
considering that most people now get their vegetables through salads, and salad 
consumption has increased in California. And I would personally like to 
announce that my Head-Lettuce Club now has 17 members.

REAL FOOD IN BROOKLYN;

<P>
CUISINE: LANDMARK RESTAURANT HAS A LANDMARK CHEF WHO BELIEVES IN REAL FOOD WITH 
REAL TASTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

appeared in Savvy Woman magazine.

<P>
There's nothing like "real" American food -- the satisfying, down-home stuff 
that people used to eat before radicchio replaced lettuce and Cheddar gave way 
to chevre. But the new incarnations of luncheonettes, diners and backwoods food 
stands seem to satisfy every sense except taste. The visual ironies are on 
target, the oldies soundtracks playing in the background feel right, yet you 
usually leave such a place wondering if it's just false nostalgia, a cover-up 
for what is, in the end, bad cooking. 
</P>
<P>
But at Gage &amp; Tollner, a refurbished landmark restaurant in Brooklyn that 
features working gas lamps and waiters so attentive they seem transported from 
another century, the food is the real thing: Charleston she-crab soup, crab 
cakes "Freetown," Smithfield ham with corn pudding and long-cooked beans, 
pan-fried quail with julienne ham and spoon bread, and barbecued spareribs with 
red rice. 
</P>
<P>
The soup boasts a velvety essence of crab. The ribs have not only a 
Sunday-dinner elegance but a spicy and succulent taste as well. It is a 
challenge to select one dessert from a sumptuous list that includes 
bitter-chocolate souffle, double chocolate cake, lemon meringue tart and pies 
galore: Tyler, sweet potato, pecan and apple. 
</P>
<P>
The woman behind the food at Gage &amp; Tollner is a national treasure named 
Edna Lewis, a 74-year-old chef who is also the author of three cookbooks. As 
any reader of the cookbooks or visitor to Gage &amp; Tollner will discover, 
Lewis' work is about fullness and directness of flavor. This isn't chic "retro" 
cooking. "I never tire of finding new ways to do things," she said about the 
cuisine she has spent a lifetime exploring. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Aschkenasy, one of the new owners of Gage &amp; Tollner, thought he'd 
just renovate the spacious interior of the 110-year-old restaurant when he took 
over last year. But he soon realized that the Southern-style food that had been 
served for years also needed some updating. He sought out Lewis after having 
admired her work at Middleton Place in Charleston, S.C., and Fearrington House 
in Pittsboro, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis is the quintessential "natural" in the kitchen, primarily because she was 
raised eating and cooking this food. Unlike most of today's celebrity chefs, 
who learned their techniques at culinary schools, Lewis was taught her trade by 
relatives who'd been improving on the recipes for generations. 
</P>
<P>
In an autobiographical passage from her first book, "The Taste of Country 
Cooking," she shares a slice of American history. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up in Freetown, Va., a community of farming people. It wasn't really a 
town. The name was adopted because the first residents had all been freed from 
chattel slavery and they wanted to be known as a town of Free People." Lewis' 
grandparents were some of the first settlers, and before she was freed, Lewis' 
grandmother had been the slave of a landowner who put her to work laying 
bricks. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis' descriptions of the aromas of her childhood -- of cakes and coffee and 
spices -- are homey without being folksy: "Rich milk was used in the making of 
gravies, blanc mange, custards, creamed minced ham, buttermilk biscuits and 
batter breads as well as sour-milk pancakes. And we would gather wild honey 
from the hollow of oak trees to go with the hot biscuits, and pick wild 
strawberries to go with the heavy cream." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, a slender and strikingly lovely woman, expresses herself best through 
her work. Ambition doesn't seem to be what motivates her -- she's simply 
devoted to the food. "Once when I was cooking a dinner party for a client, she 
said she didn't want to pay for butter," she said, laughing. "So I bought my 
own." 
</P>
<P>
Her commitment to cooking and preparing aesthetically pleasing dishes is 
impressive. She works six days a week and on an average night serves 150 
dinners. Her involvement in all phases of the food's preparation is, Aschkenasy 
said, "complete." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis' day begins at 7:30 a.m., shopping for ingredients at a farmers' market 
on Union Square in Manhattan, a short drive from the restaurant. One rainy 
morning as she picked through green beans, tasted strawberries and ordered 
apples, her gentle, unhurried air made her seem as though she were shopping for 
a dinner with friends. 
</P>
<P>
"How many would you like?" one seller of tomatoes asked. "A bushel," she 
replied matter-of-factly. Stopping to buy fresh currant rolls from one of her 
favorite bread stalls, she pointed to a line of herbs in pots. "Look at them," 
she said. "They're so pretty you almost hate to buy them and disturb the 
arrangement." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis knows most of the farmers and makes a point of keeping track of whose 
produce most suits her needs. While the outdoor markets are open only from 
spring until late fall, she prefers to buy produce from these local organic 
growers. Even so, she bemoans the chemical damage that has threatened the 
fruits and vegetables she has cooked with since she was a child. 
</P>
<P>
This is also a recurrent theme in her books. "The fur has been bred out of 
peaches today, as well as most of their flavor," she writes in one typical 
passage. 
</P>
<P>
Upstairs in the narrow baking kitchen at Gage &amp; Tollner, Lewis turned to 
rolling out the pastry dough for other desserts. Whether shaping a mound of 
meringue topping, slicing apples or fitting pastry dough into fluted pans, 
Lewis seems to be learning something new from each task. 
</P>
<P>
She makes it clear she'll do whatever's necessary to make a dish special, like 
searching from market to market for the best citron to put in her fruitcakes or 
devising innovative ways to prepare an age-old dish. Many lemon meringue pies, 
for instance, are cloyingly sweet, but Lewis' are near-perfect, the result of 
her discovery that condensed milk, when used as a thickener, interferes with 
the lemon flavor. Without a thickener, however, the filling runs when a pie is 
sliced. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis' clever solution: She prepares individual tarts without condensed milk. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis can also be a woman of strong opinions. She dislikes microwave ovens and 
refuses to use them at Gage &amp; Tollner, so dishes are always made to order 
and dinner is a long, luxurious experience. 
</P>
<P>
People who can't make it to Brooklyn can still experience Lewis' cuisine. Many 
of the recipes for the dishes she serves at the restaurant are in her 
cookbooks: "The Taste of Country Cooking," "In Pursuit of Flavor" and "The Edna 
Lewis Cookbook." The books offer pleasure even for those who don't cook; 
they're so evocative they reawaken your senses. "The Taste of Country Cooking" 
is remarkably personal, as much a set of autobiographical short stories as a 
collection of recipes. 
</P>
<P>
The personal touch -- as well as the sense of connection with history -- that 
Lewis brings to her cooking results in food that makes you feel rooted. Lewis 
makes it clear that she doesn't cook for show or to impress or to appeal to 
false nostalgia. "You can study at many places," she explains, "but real 
cooking has to come from within."

</P>
<P>
Finely chopped parsley 
</P>
<P>

Cook over low heat 15 minutes, stirring occasionally to keep milk from burning 
on bottom (do not allow milk to boil). 
</P>
<P>
Pour cream into wide skillet. Cook briskly about 10 minutes, until cream is 
thick. Pour cream into butter and milk mixture, stirring well. Add crab meat, 
then pour soup into top of double boiler set over simmering water. Cook about 
30 minutes for flavor to develop. 
</P>
<P>
Season soup with Sherry, salt and generous dash cayenne. Add crab roe and check 
seasonings. Garnish with parsley. Makes 8 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: If crab roe is unavailable, hard-cook 4 eggs and crumble 1/2 egg yolk in 
each bowl before ladling in soup.

</P>
<P>
Combine salt, pepper and thyme, crushing thyme with fingertips. Sprinkle both 
sides of quail with seasonings. 
</P>
<P>
Melt butter in large skillet over medium heat. When butter foams and just 
begins to brown, add quail, skin-side down. Sprinkle with ham, cover and cook 3 
to 4 minutes, until skin is golden brown. 
</P>
<P>
Turn birds and continue cooking, covered, until juices run clear, about 4 
minutes longer. Remove pan from heat and let quail stand, covered, about 10 
minutes. Arrange quail on platter and sprinkle ham from pan over top. 
</P>
<P>
Pour fat from pan. Add grape juice and bring to boil. Cook 1 minute, scraping 
browned bits from bottom to deglaze pan. Pour over quail. Makes 4 servings.

THE VEGETARIAN: CLAFOUTI MAKES WISE USE OF CHERRIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANA SHAW, Shaw is a free-lance writer in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Spring rains that helped revive many other Southland crops washed out most of 
the cherries, just a week or so shy of harvest time. Consequently, a fruit that 
is always too short in season will be notably scarce, and we'll have to make 
judicious use of what we can get. 
</P>
<P>
Clafouti is a wise investment -- a spongy cross between a pudding and a cake, 
infused with vanilla and rich ripe cherries. 
</P>
<P>
FRESH CHERRY CLAFOUTI 
</P>
<P>
1 1/4 cups milk 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup turbinado sugar 
</P>
<P>
3 eggs, lightly beaten 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon vanilla 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup unbleached flour 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup whole-wheat pastry flour 
</P>
<P>
3 cups deep-red bing cherries, pitted 
</P>
<P>
Powdered sugar 
</P>
<P>
Combine milk, sugar, eggs, vanilla, unbleached flour and whole-wheat pastry 
flour in blender or food processor. Process until smooth. 
</P>
<P>
Lightly butter 9-inch pie plate. Spread cherries evenly over bottom of plate. 
Pour batter on top, smoothing to cover fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Bake at 350 degrees about 1 hour or until puffed and lightly browned and knife 
inserted in center comes out clean. Serve warm, sprinkled with powdered sugar. 
Makes 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Nonfat or low-fat milk may be used if desired. For individual servings, 
lightly butter 6 custard cups or ramekins. Distribute cherries and batter 
evenly among dishes and bake as above.

THE BUTCHER: SAM'S CAFE ANCHORS THOSE ADRIFT ON FISH SEARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MERLE ELLIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Man does not live by meat alone." Not even a butcher. Certainly not one who 
spends much -- if not most -- of his time in Tiburon, Calif., not 50 yards from 
the San Francisco Bay and a lot of great fish. 
</P>
<P>
Sam's Anchor Cafe is a marvelous place in my little town of Tiburon. It's been 
there as long as any living being I know, and it hasn't changed much. From the 
looks of it as you come in off Main Street, it's an old bar, but out back on 
the bay side there are a couple of dining rooms and a huge outdoor deck with a 
magnificent view of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of young guys, Brian Wilson and Steve Spears, bought Sam's a few years 
back. They didn't remodel the place, and they didn't paint everything mauve, 
gray and green or anything like that. They did clean the place up some; having 
been there as long as it had, there were a few cobwebs in the corners. But 
basically, Sam's today is as Sam's has always been, with one notable exception 
-- the food. 
</P>
<P>
Hamburgers have long been the specialty of the house at Sam's, and they still 
make one of the best in the country, but in the past few years the menu has 
gone far beyond burgers. 
</P>
<P>
When they took over, Wilson and Spears hired a 22-year-old cook named Matthew 
Raftery. Raftery had paid his dues. He'd been cooking professionally since he 
was 16, and he had learned to love the creativity the kitchen offers. He has 
made a marvelous difference at Sam's. He's even made a fish-eater out of me. 
</P>
<P>
When Raftery first started at Sam's, I used to give him a hard time because he 
seldom had a serious meat dish on the specials board. A man can get a little 
tired of hamburgers, even great ones. One day, Raftery said, in response to my 
complaint about the lack of meat: "Merle, man does not live by meat alone. Try 
one of my fish specials. They're good. You'll like them." 
</P>
<P>
I did. Raftery was right. I've been eating lots of fish at Sam's lately. Try 
it, you'll like it. 
</P>
<P>
 Some simple preparation gives this dish an elegant taste and presentation. The 
rich taste of the melted Brie along with the subtle sweetness of the roasted 
peppers make the salmon melt in your mouth. Serve with pecan-flavored wild rice 
and fresh steamed asparagus. 
</P>
<P>
BAKED SALMON WITH BRIE AND ROASTED RED PEPPERS 
</P>
<P>
2 or 3 medium sweet red peppers 
</P>
<P>
1 cup bread crumbs 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon flour 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil 
</P>
<P>
Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
4 (6-ounce) salmon fillets 
</P>
<P>
Olive oil 
</P>
<P>
2 to 3 cloves garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup dry white wine 
</P>
<P>
10 to 12 ounces Brie cheese 
</P>
<P>
Place peppers on baking sheet. Broil 10 to 15 minutes, rotating until skin 
blisters and turns black on all sides. Remove peppers and place in plastic bag, 
close and let steam until cool enough to handle. Discard skin and seeds. Cut 
flesh into strips and reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Combine bread crumbs, flour, oregano, basil and dash of salt and pepper. Dredge 
fish in bread crumb mixture until completely coated. 
</P>
<P>
Heat about 1 ounce oil per fillet in saute pan to smoking point. Carefully 
place fish in pan and add garlic. Cook until golden brown (about 1 minute per 
side). 
</P>
<P>
Remove fish from pan and place on lightly greased baking sheet. Deglaze pan 
with lemon juice and wine. Keep sauce warm. 
</P>
<P>
Arrange alternate strips of roasted peppers and cheese across top of each 
fillet. Bake at 450 degrees 5 to 7 minutes (depending on thickness). Serve with 
sauce. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 This is an easy back-yard barbecue recipe that reflects the philosophy at 
Sam's: Make it taste great, make it fast and simple, make it again. The dense 
flesh of the tuna makes it perfect for the barbecue, but it will work just as 
well under the broiler. Remember, it will cook fast. 
</P>
<P>
BROILED AHI 'MARGARITA' 
</P>
<P>
(Tequila Lime Marinade and Avocado Salsa) 
</P>
<P>
2 avocados, chopped 
</P>
<P>
1 tomato, chopped 
</P>
<P>
1 onion, minced 
</P>
<P>
1 sweet yellow pepper, chopped 
</P>
<P>
1/2 jalapeno chile, minced 
</P>
<P>
1 1/4 cups chopped cilantro 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup lemon-lime carbonated beverage 
</P>
<P>
2 cups lime juice 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup triple sec 
</P>
<P>
1 cup flat beer 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup tequila 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon ground coriander 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin 
</P>
<P>
4 to 6 (8-ounce) tuna (Ahi) fillets 
</P>
<P>
Combine avocados, tomato, onion, yellow pepper, chile, 1/2 cup cilantro and 
lemon-lime carbonated beverage. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Combine lime juice, lemon juice, triple sec, beer, tequila, coriander, cumin 
and remaining 3/4 cup cilantro. Add fish and marinate 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Grill or broil fish. Acid from citrus begins to cook fish, so be careful not to 
overcook. 
</P>
<P>
Serve with reserved salsa, either on top of fish or on side. Makes 4 to 6 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
POACHED SWORDFISH SALAD WITH HONEY-MUSTARD VINAIGRETTE 
</P>
<P>
2 to 3 bay leaves 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon peppercorns 
</P>
<P>
3 cups lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
1 gallon water 
</P>
<P>
2 pounds swordfish 
</P>
<P>
1 egg 
</P>
<P>
1 cup olive oil 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup honey 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons Dijon mustard 
</P>
<P>
Mixed salad greens 
</P>
<P>
Combine bay leaves, peppercorns, lemon juice and water in large saucepot. Bring 
to boil. 
</P>
<P>
Cut fish into 3- to 4-inch pieces. Carefully place fish in boiling water and 
poach to delicate flake (about 5 to 7 minutes). Remove from water with slotted 
spoon or pour into colander and chill. 
</P>
<P>
Beat egg in mixing bowl until frothy. While beating, gradually drip in olive 
oil to create thick emulsion. Add honey, vinegar and mustard. Arrange fish on 
greens and pour dressing over. Makes 6 to 8 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Although many recipes call for uncooked eggs, the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture has found them to be a potential carrier of food-borne illness and 
recommends that diners avoid eating raw eggs. Commercial egg substitutes may be 
used in place of raw eggs in certain circumstances. Check egg substitute 
package for applications.

BACK TO BASICS: SLICING A CHIFFONADE OF GREENS OR HERBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chiffonade is an elaborate name for a simple food-preparation technique. The 
term refers to leafy greens and herbs cut into thin ribbons. 
</P>
<P>
To prepare a chiffonade of spinach, wash the leaves well, trimming away the 
stems and any discolored areas. Dry, then stack five or six leaves (Step 1), 
placing the larger leaves on the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning at one side, roll the leaves into a tight cylinder (Step 2). Hold the 
cylinder with one hand and slice it into fine strips (Step 3). When unrolled, 
the leaves are thin ribbons (Step 4). 
</P>
<P>
Basil, sorrel, endive, lettuce and cabbage leaves are also excellent choices 
for preparing a chiffonade. The ribbons may serve as garnishes or beds for 
other foods. They may also be sauteed with butter, moistened with stock, milk 
or cream and used as a garnish for soup.

CULINARY SOS: IT'S ONE 'KILLER' OF A CARROT CAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ROSE DOSTI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR SOS: I would kill for the recipe for the carrot cake served at the 
Crocodile Cafe in Pasadena. I thought I had the best recipe, but this one 
surpasses it. It's light, chunky and moist -- pure ambrosia. 
</P>
<P>
 -- RAYMONDE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR RAYMONDE: Here's the recipe. And watch out. It's a killer, all right: 
gorgeous, with three layers and plenty of rich frosting. 
</P>
<P>
CROCODILE KILLER CARROT CAKE 
</P>
<P>
4 cups all-purpose flour 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons baking powder 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons baking soda 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
5 eggs 
</P>
<P>
3 cups sugar 
</P>
<P>
2 cups oil 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons vanilla 
</P>
<P>
6 cups peeled and finely shredded carrots 
</P>
<P>
2 cups crushed pineapple, drained 
</P>
<P>
3 1/2 to 4 1/2 cups chopped walnuts 
</P>
<P>
Cream Cheese Frosting 
</P>
<P>
Sift together flour, baking powder, soda, salt and cinnamon. Beat eggs, then 
beat in sugar, oil and vanilla until fluffy. Stir in flour mixture, scraping 
bowl, then stir in carrots, pineapple and 1 1/2 cups nuts. 
</P>
<P>
Pour into 3 sprayed and floured 9-inch cake pans lined with parchment circles. 
Bake at 325 degrees 45 minutes or until wood pick inserted in center comes out 
clean. Cool on wire racks. 
</P>
<P>
To frost, set 1 cake layer on serving plate, top-side up. Spread with about 1/4 
of Cream Cheese Frosting. Top with second layer, bottom-side up. Spread with 
1/2 to 3/4 cup frosting. Top with third layer, bottom-side up. Frost sides and

TRUSTEES THREATEN ELY WITH LAWSUIT; 
</P>
<P>
COMMUNITY COLLEGES: HE SAYS HE WON'T SUBMIT RECEIPTS FOR HIS TRIPS UNTIL THE 
DISTRICT REIMBURSES HIM $1,500 FOR BUSINESS EXPENSES HE HAS INCURRED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Ventura County Community College District trustees said they will sue fellow 
Trustee Tom Ely if he does not submit expense reports for business trips he 
took this year or repay the district $1,575 in travel advances. 
</P>
<P>
The board voted 4 to 0 Tuesday night to give Ely until July 15 to respond to 
its demand, or it will file suit in Small Claims Court against him. Ely did not 
vote on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
The board's demands center on three trips Ely took between February and April 
to community college conventions in Sacramento, Burlingame and Washington. The 
board also ordered Ely to repay any expenses his wife, Ingrid, may have charged 
on a district credit card when she accompanied him to Sacramento and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he doesn't want to cooperate, and he's refusing to pay," Trustee 
Timothy Hirschberg said of Ely. Hirschberg said the district decided to take 
Ely to court if he does not comply with the board's order. 
</P>
<P>
But Ely said Wednesday that he will not submit receipts for his trips until the 
district reimburses him for $1,500 in business expenses he has incurred over 
the past three years. Since April, the 54-year-old Simi Valley resident said, 
he has submitted receipts for mileage and for calls made on his home and car 
telephones but has yet to receive reimbursement from the district. 
</P>
<P>
"If that's the way they treat my submissions, why the hell should I go to the 
trouble of submitting anymore," Ely said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ely, Vice Chancellor Tom Kimberling told the board that the 
district attorney's office has advised the college district not to pay Ely 
until he complies with its demands. Deputy Dist. Atty. Carol J. Nelson has said 
she is investigating Ely for possible misappropriation of several thousand 
dollars in district funds related to his travel expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"Kimberling has lied," Ely said. "The district attorney never said that." 
Neither Kimberling nor Nelson could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got all of the data," Ely said of his travel expenses. "It's no problem 
to submit it. But they owe me a duty." 
</P>
<P>
As for his wife's expenses, Ely said he already has reimbursed the district. 
</P>
<P>
Ely's troubles began in March when the Board of Trustees commissioned an audit 
of his travel expenses after learning that he had run up large gambling debts 
and that he had used his office telephone to call casinos in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office began its inquiry shortly afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Ely has said that the audit is flawed and that he has not violated district 
travel policy. 
</P>
<P>
Ely, who has said his gambling debts amounted to less than $20,000, said 
Wednesday he recently was awarded a judgment against his insurance company, 
which had previously refused to reimburse him for an automobile accident last 
year involving him and his wife. Ely refused to say how much money he had been 
awarded but said he would be able to pay all of his debts. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his gambling debts, Ely was ordered by a Municipal Court judge 
in May to pay Simi Valley Bank $17,500 in outstanding credit card bills.

FOURTH OF JULY CELEBRATION; 
</P>
<P>
LIFEGUARDS KEEP THE HOLIDAY CROWD SAFE AND SANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Lifeguard Mary Hawblitzel burst out of her tower Wednesday on Ventura State 
Beach, sprinted to the water's edge and lunged into the waves to rescue an 
18-year-old caught in a rip current. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, Hawblitzel -- a powerful swimmer -- was dragging the scared 
teen-ager to safety. 
</P>
<P>
"He was pretty nervous," she said of the young man, who had been swept about 
300 feet from shore. "He kept saying, 'I'm going to die. I'm going to die.' " 
</P>
<P>
It was one of several emergencies on Ventura County beaches on the Fourth of 
July. But thanks to the 45 lifeguards on duty in the county, no one had been 
seriously injured by early evening. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of expected this on the Fourth," said Hawblitzel, 22. "People come out, 
have a good time and get themselves in situations they can't handle." 
</P>
<P>
Down the beach at lifeguard headquarters, supervisors Kirk Sturm, 35, and Jerry 
Weil, 37, fielded call after call -- dispatching lifeguards to help dispose of 
some unexploded fireworks from an early morning celebration, to warn away 
jet-skiers coming dangerously close to sunbathers and to help several mothers 
locate their missing children. 
</P>
<P>
"There's really a lot more to lifeguarding than meets the eye," said Weil, one 
of 118 state, county and city lifeguards who patrol Ventura County beaches. 
</P>
<P>
State lifeguards patrol nine beaches in the county, from the Ventura River 
Group Camp to Leo Carrillo State Beach. County lifeguards are responsible for 
the Silver Strand Beach, about a mile north of Channel Islands Harbor; the 
Hollywood Beach, about a mile south of the harbor, and the beach inside the 
harbor. The city of Port Hueneme is the only municipality with its own 
lifeguard program, patrolling a mile of shoreline in the small city. 
</P>
<P>
Lifeguarding has its obvious benefits, but the job has become more difficult 
over the years, said Steve White, lifeguard supervisor for the state's Channel 
Coast District, which covers six beaches from McGrath State Beach to 
Carpinteria State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
While Ventura County's population has burgeoned in the past decade, its 
lifeguard corps has grown only slightly. Only the state's Santa Monica 
Mountains District, which governs the area between Point Mugu and El Matador 
State Beach, has significantly increased its number of lifeguards. It has added 
28 people since 1980, said Boe Stevens, a lifeguard supervisor in the district. 
</P>
<P>
More people mean more opportunities for injury. Plus, sports such as jet-skiing 
and wind surfing have made the ocean more treacherous, White said. 
</P>
<P>
The county's lifeguards, White said, have tried to cut down on accidents by 
warning people before they put themselves in danger. And the preventive 
measures seem to be paying off. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, there were 154 rescues in the state's Channel Coast District, he said. 
In 1989, there were 170 rescues and, as of June 1, there were 30. 
</P>
<P>
To achieve this safety record, lifeguards in the district had to warn people 
away from dangerous activities 32,096 times last year. This year, as of June 1 
-- before the busy beach season -- they have interceded 2,818 times, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We learn how to interpret rules to people, how to tell them no and leave them 
with a smile," said Stevens, a lifeguard supervisor in the Santa Monica 
Mountains District. 
</P>
<P>
If people refuse to follow rules, six state lifeguards in the county are 
licensed peace officers who carry guns and have the authority to make arrests. 
Lifeguards in the Channel Coast District make between five and 10 arrests each 
year for such crimes as auto theft, drunk driving and battery. 
</P>
<P>
The constant need to be on guard for any type of emergency makes lifeguarding 
an interesting but very stressful way to make a living, White said. 
</P>
<P>
"You never know what's going to happen," White said. "You stay late when you 
need to and you go home when you can." 
</P>
<P>
But the perquisites of the job -- gazing out at blue sky, rolling waves and 
dolphins that frequently frolic off the coastline -- more than make up for the 
drawbacks, lifeguards attest, making competition fierce for the few available 
spots each year. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 people applied for seven positions last year in the Santa Monica 
Mountains District, Stevens said. And about 100 people applied for six 
positions with the Channel Coast District in 1989, White said. 
</P>
<P>
The field was cut during a series of rigorous tests: a 1,000-yard ocean swim 
that must be completed within 20 minutes, an 800-yard run-swim-run over water 
and sand that must be finished in 10 minutes and an oral interview. The 
candidates who passed those hurdles were sent to a camp in Huntington Beach for 
60 hours of training. The top-scoring applicants there were chosen for the 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Competition for jobs with the county and Port Hueneme is not as stiff. One 
reason, officials from those jurisdictions said, is that the state pays more. 
</P>
<P>
State lifeguards start out making $9.53 an hour and can work up to $11.02 per 
hour in temporary jobs. If they become permanent lifeguards, they start at 
$27,792 and top out around $36,700. 
</P>
<P>
County lifeguards, all of whom are seasonal, make between $8.38 and $10.11 an 
hour, and Port Hueneme pays its guards between $7.25 and $15.25, depending on 
their experience level. 
</P>
<P>
Once they become lifeguards, few people want to give it up. 
</P>
<P>
Casey Culp, 17, is enjoying his second season of lifeguarding so much that he 
is considering making it a career. "I've just fallen in love with it," said 
Culp, a state lifeguard. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Harmon, 33, could not bear the thought of resigning his job as a state 
lifeguard even after he passed the State Bar exam and began practicing law in 
March, 1989. Harmon began lifeguarding on Ventura State Beach in 1974 and 
worked full time through law school at Ventura College of Law. 
</P>
<P>
During weekdays Harmon practices family law. And on weekends he dons red trunks 
and heads to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't do it for money as much as to keep my toes in the sand," Harmon said. 
"I would work even if I didn't get paid."

CORNERING THE ILLEGAL DRUG MARKET; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: ONE OF THE CITY'S HOTTEST SPOTS FOR DRUG DEALING AND ASSAULTS DAY OR 
NIGHT IS 11TH AVENUE AND C STREET. POLICE PATROLS AND ARRESTS DO LITTLE TO STOP 
IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was 7 p.m. on a Thursday evening, and the "vendors" were doing a brisk 
business at 11th Avenue and C Street in downtown San Diego. Drugs and money 
were exchanging hands in half a dozen transactions, without any attempt by 
dealers or buyers to hide from the police. 
</P>
<P>
"You the police?" asked one young dealer, who casually glanced at a reporter 
who stood less than 10 feet away and watched as he sold $5 bags of marijuana to 
a couple of men. 
</P>
<P>
The young man, undeterred by the presence of a stranger, asked the question 
with indifference. 
</P>
<P>
And why not? Even if arrested, he probably would be issued a misdemeanor 
citation and released. Crowding at county jails has made it almost impossible 
to jail someone charged with misdemeanor drug counts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very frustrating," said San Diego Police Officer Jim Filley. "We do make 
some arrests, but most of the time we can only issue misdemeanor citations. If 
they are arrested, they only spend a few hours in custody. It's especially 
frustrating when you keep citing and arresting the same people every day." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many areas in the city where drug dealing is most 
</P>
<P>
prevalent at night, drug sales take place at all hours of the day at 11th and 
C. In fact, police describe the area on C between 11th and 12th as one of the 
hottest spots for narcotics activity in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
One of the major reasons, they say, is the convenient location to customers. 
Some are suburbanites heading down 11th, which leads to on-ramps to both 
Interstate 5 and California 163. Others are students from nearby San Diego City 
College, or junkies who hang out at the Qwik Korner convenience store on the 
corner. In addition, one of the trolley's most popular stops, that at 12th 
Avenue, is nearby. 
</P>
<P>
According to Filley, marijuana, heroin, crystal methamphetamine and crack 
cocaine are the most popular drugs sold on the block. 
</P>
<P>
On this recent Thursday, an unkempt man approached another in a business suit, 
who quickly made a beeline for the convenience store. 
</P>
<P>
"You looking for a little weed or a toot?" the dealer of marijuana and rock 
cocaine yelled at the man, who did not respond. 
</P>
<P>
The dealer, who called himself Maurice, was not reluctant to admit that he 
spends his days selling drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"Man, we're part of the economy," he said. "You know, providing a service, 
meeting demand. Look around. How many people do you see here 
</P>
<P>
who are saying no to drugs? They're keeping me 
</P>
<P>
and my partners off welfare," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The prevalence of money and drugs at the intersection prompts other crimes. 
Young men, many of them recent illegal aliens, according to police, pick 
pockets and snatch purses. Prostitutes, male and female, search out customers 
to earn a few dollars for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Tereschuck, vice president for transportation with the Metropolitan 
Transit Development Board, said the 12th Avenue stop presents the biggest 
security problem for the agency. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very concerned about the criminal activity that occurs in that area, as 
it may adversely affect our ridership," he said. "We maintain a high profile 
with extra security at that station, and have worked closely with the police 
narcotics teams. . . . This is the area that causes us more concern." 
</P>
<P>
As is often the case in areas where drug dealing occurs, fights, muggings, 
stabbings and strong-arm robberies are common. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent afternoon, a man peddled a bag of groceries for $2 to obtain drug 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Panhandling is also a problem, said Filley, a member of a police team organized 
to clean up the area. Some panhandlers have been known to assault people who 
refuse them money. 
</P>
<P>
"Confrontations are numerous and, unfortunately, ongoing. It's a very difficult 
area to police," Filley said. "We recently had a rash of assaults in that 
area." 
</P>
<P>
Although police "can't be at that corner all day," he said, officers make swift 
and unpredictable sweeps of the area. On a recent afternoon, two squad cars 
descended on a pickup with Colorado license plates that had pulled into the 
Qwik Korner lot. They arrested two startled sailors who had just purchased 
marijuana from a dealer. 
</P>
<P>
The dealer attempted to walk away nonchalantly, but was arrested by two 
officers waiting around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys used to be sailors. After we forward our report to the Navy, they 
might not be allowed to stay in the service," one officer said. "They're both 
career men, and they probably just threw their careers away." 
</P>
<P>
Mel Gavin, manager of the Qwik Korner, said he tries his best to stop drug 
dealers and their customers from loitering in front of the market. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like it. They come into the store and shoplift. Several times a week 
I've got to sweep up the hypodermic needles they leave around the store and 
dump them," he said. "About a month ago, we had a knife and club fight in front 
of the store. People are afraid to come into the area." 
</P>
<P>
Filley said police have talked with Gavin and employees of the various 
fast-food restaurants in the area to make them aware of the rights and 
responsibilities they have as business owners in a high-crime area. 
</P>
<P>
"They become, to a degree, a party to crimes that occur by allowing people to 
hang out on their property. . . . We've told them about their right to refuse 
service. . . . It's their responsibility to make sure that people who loiter on 
their lots don't," Filley said. 
</P>
<P>
Gavin is one of several business people who have urged police to patrol the 
area aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
At the nearby Imperial Bank office building, security personnel complain 
frequently to police about drug dealing near the building and about junkies who 
wander into an ungated drive-through area at night to shoot up. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, inside the Qwik Korner, a young man was thumbing through the 
Employment Weekly, which lists available jobs. It was already Friday, and a 
stack of copies still occupied the rack, apparently untouched. 
</P>
<P>
"No, man, I'm not looking for a job. Already got one," he said. "Set my own 
hours and work when I want. I'm waiting for my man. He's heard I got some good 
(heroin), and he needs the stuff three times a day. . . . It's a job, man. It's 
a job. If I don't do it, someone else will."

ANNEXATION URGED FOR 90-ACRE SITE

<P>
The Camarillo Planning Commission has recommended that the city annex about 90 
acres of an unincorporated area of Ventura County near Las Posas Road. 
</P>
<P>
The development company, Presley of Southern California, plans to build 259 
single-family houses on 88 acres west of Lantana Street. 
</P>
<P>
The commission voted Tuesday against the annexation of another 37 acres east of 
Lantana after a public outcry. A petition with the signatures of 74 residents 
living in the 119 houses in the Casa de Cavalier tract was submitted to the 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
The residents want to remain under county control rather than become 
incorporated into the city. Even though property taxes would have remained the 
same after the annexation, some residents say they feel their quality of life 
would be jeopardized under city jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate action, the commission tentatively approved a subdivision to be 
built by Pardee Construction east of Mission Oaks Boulevard and south of Colony 
Drive. The subdivision is to consist of 159 single-family houses on 36.7 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in the Laurelwood tract, south of the proposed Pardee development, 
said at the meeting that they oppose the project because, among other things, 
it would increase traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council has final authority over both annexation and the developments.

CHEMICAL COMPANY PLEADS NO CONTEST IN MOBIL EXPLOSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Defendants in a three-week criminal trial stemming from a 1988 explosion at 
Mobil Oil's Torrance refinery abruptly pleaded no contest Tuesday, just as the 
judge in the case prepared to instruct jurors on how to conduct their 
deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Cal Cat Chemical Co., a Benecia-based contract company, and its 
president, Paul Taylor, entered the no contest pleas to misdemeanor charges 
after both sides had rested in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Judge Josh Fredricks ordered the company to pay $26,500 in fines and 
penalty assessments and ordered Taylor to pay $14,750. 
</P>
<P>
He also placed the company and Taylor on three years' summary probation, which 
would allow the judge to sentence Taylor to jail time in this case if he is 
convicted of any violations of the state Labor Code or Health and Safety Code 
during that time. 
</P>
<P>
The pleas brought a sudden end to what prosecutors had said was a rare jury 
trial on industrial safety violations. 
</P>
<P>
The case revolved around the July 15, 1988, explosion of a tank at the refinery 
as three Cal Cat employees attempted to treat sludge on the tank's bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Cat employee Winston Jones, 30, was standing on top of the tank when it 
exploded. He died instantly. One of his co-workers, David Moustafi, suffered 
burns over three-quarters of his body. Another co-worker, Jerry Lekberg, lost 
hearing in one ear, and, his doctors testified, has experienced frequent 
flashbacks to that day. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, the company and two other Cal Cat employees had been charged with 
failing to follow state labor codes that required they inform their workers 
about the dangers of the chemicals they were using. Charges against on-site 
supervisor James Hernandez and company Vice President Frank Straw were 
dismissed after their attorneys argued that the state labor codes under which 
the charges had been filed apply only to employers, not supervising employees. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said the failure to educate the workers properly caused them to 
inadvertently create an explosive mix inside the tank. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Warren Ettinger, who represented the company, said he decided 
to offer the no contest plea to avoid a guilty verdict, which could be used 
against Cal Cat in any civil litigation stemming from the explosion. But he 
said company officials have not changed their opinion that they did not cause 
the accident, which he said was "tragic, unavoidable and unpredictable." 
</P>
<P>
"We started out with the premise that we did not commit any criminal wrongdoing 
. . . and we stand by that premise," Ettinger said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Anthony Patchett expressed disappointment about the abrupt 
end to the trial, saying he believed jurors were leaning toward conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Patchett said he talked to all of the jurors after the case was finished. 
"There wasn't any doubt in any of their minds, and I think that the defense 
attorneys saw the writing on the wall," Patchett said. "They were a very 
intent, very dedicated jury . . . and I wish they could have made a statement 
to the community regarding what they felt in this case."

BUSINESS IS BOOMING FOR THOSE SELLING FIREWORKS; 
</P>
<P>
FOURTH OF JULY: DESPITE OUTSIDE PRESSURE, PALMDALE REMAINS THE ONLY CITY IN 
NORTHERN L.A. COUNTY TO PERMIT THE SALE OF THE PYROTECHNICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
With only hours remaining before dusk on the Fourth of July, business was brisk 
at roadside fireworks stands in Palmdale, the only remaining place to legally 
buy the pyrotechnics in the Antelope and San Fernando valleys. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, it's been crazy," Mary Croxen said as she took a break from the 
line of customers at the Palmdale Emblem Club's stand at Palmdale Boulevard and 
East 6th Street. "People have been buying this year wildly." 
</P>
<P>
Several other Palmdale fireworks merchants, all members of various nonprofit 
organizations that have operated the stands for the past week to earn money for 
their groups, reported similarly encouraging sales. But while earnings appeared 
to be rising this year, so too, apparently, has political opposition to the 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something that's been going on in the United States for 215 years," 
Croxen said. "It's been a tradition for generations. There's too many more 
important things to spend people's time on" than banning fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
The city of San Fernando banned the sale of so-called "safe and sane" fireworks 
in 1988, leaving Palmdale as the lone exception in the area. A number of cities 
in Los Angeles County, including the city of Los Angeles, prohibit the sale and 
use of fireworks. They are also prohibited in unincorporated county areas. 
</P>
<P>
Now, nearby communities are pressuring Palmdale to ban the sales as well. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Brink, a member of the Town Council in Acton, an unincorporated area 20 
miles south of Palmdale, is one of the leaders of an effort to persuade 
Palmdale city officials to halt the sale of fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
The area's four-year drought has made the use of fireworks by untrained 
handlers particularly dangerous, he said. Continued sales in Palmdale allow 
residents of nearby communities that have outlawed fireworks to obtain them, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We just want them to do whatever they want to do on their side of the hill, 
but just don't cause us problems on this side of the hill," Brink said. 
</P>
<P>
Acton officials first asked the Palmdale City Council to ban the sales last 
year, Brink said. A week ago, they again raised the issue at a Palmdale council 
meeting, threatening the city's officials with a lawsuit unless they banned 
fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
"All the people who are selling them are very nice charitable organizations," 
Brink said. "But there's got to be another way they can make $10,000 or $20,000 
that doesn't put us at risk of a fire." 
</P>
<P>
Several Palmdale residents selling fireworks Wednesday disagreed. They said the 
stands, which by city law may be open only during the week before the Fourth of 
July, are far more profitable than other fund-raising activities. 
</P>
<P>
"It'd kill us," Jim Hull, Palmdale Knights of Columbus recorder, said of a 
possible ban on fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
His group has sold fireworks for more than 30 years on Sierra Highway. "We get 
90% of our annual sales from this." 
</P>
<P>
Those staffing the roadside stands also rejected Brink's contention that they 
should ask their customers where they live and sell only to Palmdale residents. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not ask," Croxen said. "That is not our job. We will not police." 
</P>
<P>
Fireworks merchants say there is no reason to ban sales because, if used as 
intended, the devices are not dangerous. They noted that their products are 
non-flying devices such as sparklers and smoke bombs. 
</P>
<P>
They also argue that banning fireworks in Palmdale would simply encourage those 
intent on using fireworks to make their own, buy more powerful ones from Mexico 
or travel to areas that still permit them. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando Police Officer Tom Favazzo said fireworks have abounded in his 
city despite the 1988 sales ban. He said a Palmdale prohibition "is not going 
to have any effect whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
"They're either going to get them here, or they're going to get them somewhere 
else," said Bill Leveck, who drove to Palmdale from Lancaster to buy sparklers, 
which he said he would use in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
Dan, a weekend resident of Palmdale who declined to give his last name, was at 
the Emblem Club stand buying a $42.70 package of assorted fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
He said the warnings on the packages are meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to take these apart and make real fireworks," Dan said as he told 
how to combine the explosives from several fireworks into a more powerful 
device. "It'll make you half a stick of dynamite. That's safe and sane for 
you."

HERMOSA BEACH CAFE GETS A NEW LEASE ON LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Gem Cafe, a decades-old Hermosa Beach diner that was to have been shut down 
by its landlord this week, has been given a reprieve, thanks to an outpouring 
of community support and a last-minute legal compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a miracle!" cheered Richard McCurdy, a local businessman and Gem patron 
who launched a "Save the Gem Cafe Committee" last month when he heard that the 
landlord was planning to lease the gingham-curtained space to a new tenant. 
</P>
<P>
Until last week, the restaurant's owners, Henry and Grace Poirier, were facing 
the demise of the Gem, a burger-and-pie-type diner they had bought 28 years ago 
from two sisters who had founded it in 1949. Now they have a six-month lease, 
giving them until Dec. 31 to find a new spot. 
</P>
<P>
The landlords, Warren and Laurie Miller, had sent the Poiriers an eviction 
notice effective July 1, saying they were planning to lease the space at a 
higher rent to a new tenant. 
</P>
<P>
The Millers said they were doing this for business reasons, adding that the 
Poiriers had refused for years to sign a lease -- thus they were within their 
rights to evict them. 
</P>
<P>
But the Poiriers, both in their 60s, said that they had been trying to get a 
lease for the past year so that they could sell their business and retire on 
the proceeds. The Millers, they said, had refused to meet with them, and in so 
doing, had deprived them of a retirement nest egg they were counting on. 
</P>
<P>
For weeks, the Gem's impending shutdown was the talk of the tiny restaurant, 
where grandparents and surfers, TV stars and beach bums have gathered for 
Henry's roast beef sandwiches and Grace's homemade fruit and cream pies. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, McCurdy's committee -- which includes, among others, actor Max 
Wright of the NBC sitcom "Alf" -- offered to buy the Gem from the Millers. The 
landlords refused, saying that they had already signed a contract with the new 
tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, however, after articles about the Gem's plight were published in a 
local weekly newspaper and The Times, the Millers' lawyer agreed to meet with a 
lawyer on the Save the Gem Cafe Committee to work out a compromise. Poirier 
explained that, in the aftermath of the publicity, he and his wife were flooded 
with calls from patrons who wanted to help them remain in business. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the Millers had understood before how much the cafe meant to the 
community," said Beverly Hills attorney Jim Holbrook, a former Hermosa Beach 
resident and Gem patron. 
</P>
<P>
Holbrook said he met Friday with Harry L. Hathaway, a Los Angeles lawyer who 
represents the Millers, and worked out the six-month lease. Hathaway said the 
lease includes a modest rent increase -- the Poiriers had been paying $475 a 
month for the space, and will now pay $675. 
</P>
<P>
Hathaway said the new tenant also agreed to the postponement because she, too, 
needed more time. 
</P>
<P>
Poirier said he and his wife hope to stay in Hermosa Beach, and "this gives us 
a chance to look around and find another place."

HARBOR DIVISION POLICE GET A SENSE OF COMMUNITY; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: THE DAYLONG SESSION FOR NEW OFFICERS MAY BECOME A MODEL FOR 
THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT'S 17 OTHER AREAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For years, Wilmington community activist Eleanor Montano has seen them come and 
go -- the baby faces fresh out of the Police Academy, the vets who have worked 
the harbor area for years, the transfers from other stations. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, they have been a fine group of officers, she said. Sure, some were 
malcontents or troublemakers sent by the Los Angeles Police Department to the 
remote Harbor Division for what used to be call "freeway therapy." But by and 
large, Harbor Division has had good cops, she said. 
</P>
<P>
One thing has been missing, though, Montano said. It was the proper attitude, 
gleaned from knowledge about the harbor area, its people and its problems. 
That, however, is changing, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't get me wrong, we've had plenty of good officers over the years," said 
Montano, a Wilmington resident since 1941. "But now, the officers smile at 
people. They're our friends now. There's a more relaxed atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
One reason, according to Montano, is Capt. Joe DeLadurantey, the harbor 
division's commanding officer. And just as important, Montano said, is 
DeLadurantey's orientation program that all of the division's new officers must 
attend, regardless of their experience. 
</P>
<P>
The daylong orientation has been in place at the Harbor Division since 
DeLadurantey's arrival a year ago. And its success has caught the eye of the 
Los Angeles Police Commission, which may suggest that Chief Daryl F. Gates 
recommend the program as a model for the department's 17 other divisions, only 
a few of which conduct similar sessions. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at it now to find out more about it, how well it's doing and 
whether something similar could be implemented in other places," said Richard 
Dameron, the commission's executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
Offered about once every two months, the orientation in some ways is no 
different than those already given at many other LAPD divisions. There is a 
briefing by the brass on the "do's and don'ts" in the division. New officers 
are told a bit about the local communities. And one of the locals -- often a 
businessman or bureaucrat -- is brought in to welcome the officers. 
</P>
<P>
But DeLadurantey's program goes well beyond the others. The officers are not 
just told about the community, they tour it for hours. They do not just get a 
map, they get a 94-page briefing book that details each community's history, 
community services, schools and gang hot spots. 
</P>
<P>
And perhaps most important, the new officers do not just hear from the official 
greeters, they meet with community activists who are often plain-spoken about 
what they expect from local police. 
</P>
<P>
"If you go to Wilmington and Harbor City, you might find out they need a lot of 
help . . . and you can help with a positive attitude," the officers were told 
recently by Abelardo de la Pena, director of the Mahar House, a longtime 
community organization in Wilmington that provides an array of social services. 
</P>
<P>
That sort of advice, not just sugar-coated welcomes, is common during the 
orientations. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask Eleanor Montano. 
</P>
<P>
"When I talk to the new officers, my main message to them is to stay above the 
law. I tell them that if they treat people with respect, they will be 
respected," said Montano, whose activities include chairing the Los Angeles 
County Commission on Human Relations. 
</P>
<P>
"I want them to know I'm not the enemy," she said. "I want them to know there 
are plenty of good addresses in this community, more good addresses than there 
are bad ones." 
</P>
<P>
It is a message that is important and repeated throughout the orientations. And 
it is one that officers need to hear, Montano said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes accidents or problems happen from misunderstandings. If an officer 
has never been in a community or with certain cultures, they might not be as 
sensitive," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She added, "A lot of people forget that law-enforcement officers are people 
too. 
</P>
<P>
The orientation program "can make things safer for the community and the 
police," she said. "To me, it's like washing your car without waxing it. This 
program gives the officers that final polish, that special thing that helps 
them and the local community." 
</P>
<P>
That, DeLadurantey said, is what the orientation is all about. 
</P>
<P>
"This program is a quick way to immerse the officers in their community so they 
can learn in one day what it might take six months to learn under normal 
circumstances," said DeLadurantey, who patterned the orientation after one he 
received during his earliest days as an LAPD officer 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"My first captain, Tom King, used to do this at the 77th Division, and I vowed 
if I ever had an opportunity, I would do the same thing," said DeLadurantey, 
who instituted the orientation 10 years ago at LAPD's Wilshire Division, and 
then at the Hollenbeck Division. 
</P>
<P>
"What I liked about it from the start was that it got my head oriented right, 
it helped me to understand what the job is all about," he said. "You can talk 
all about service, but you really need to see it in action. And when you see 
the lead officers talking about the division, and talk with the people in the 
community, you know what it's all about." 
</P>
<P>
Many officers at an orientation last month agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's helpful," said Sgt. Rick Dedmon, a 16-year LAPD veteran who worked at 
four other divisions before recently coming to the harbor. "I've been to other 
orientations, but this is one of the better ones. Granted, there are some cops 
who might think they don't need this, but you can't go in with that kind of 
attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been a policeman for 16 years, and I learn something new every day." 
</P>
<P>
Added Officer Olivia Joya, 22, who joined the department two weeks ago: "I was 
pretty much raised in the area and I still learned things (from the 
orientation)." 
</P>
<P>
As an example, Joya said that, until the orientation, she did not know how many 
community organizations were available for referrals by police. "I had no idea 
there were so many groups, with so many people, helping out the community," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Joya also said her conversations with community leaders and residents provided 
her with a better understanding of the area. "It helps talking, just to find 
out what their likes and dislikes are," she said. 
</P>
<P>
One of those who talked recently with the new officers was Elizabeth Taylor of 
the Community Reclamation Project, a Lomita-based anti-gang and drug prevention 
program funded by the U.S. Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a marvelous program, a good way of indoctrinating those who come to the 
area on what's out there. . . . It's very helpful because it gives them a 
foundation on which to build upon in understanding the area," Taylor said after 
the orientation. 
</P>
<P>
One measure of the program's success, DeLadurantey said, is the interest 
expressed by community leaders about participating. "They're on a waiting list 
right now," he said. "We're trying to rotate the appearances so we don't slight 
anyone." 
</P>
<P>
But even if there were no waiting list, DeLadurantey said, he would consider 
the program a success because it forces the officers to quickly focus on the 
job ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"This community is different, and I'd like you to treat it that way," 
DeLadurantey told the officers at the start of the last orientation. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro, he told them, is a community in transition, a seaside melting pot 
finally discovered by developers and growing more crowded every day. So are 
Wilmington and Harbor City, he said. But Wilmington and Harbor City have 
different problems than San Pedro, among them ongoing and deadly battles 
between gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like you to patrol the communities the way you would if your mother lived 
there," DeLadurantey told the officers. 
</P>
<P>
"I realize we're going to put a lot on you," he added. "But we're not asking 
you to solve the problems that may be longstanding in these communities. I just 
want you to be aware of them."

BILINGUAL TEACHER SHORTAGE FELT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Simi Valley school officials said Tuesday that a statewide shortage of 
bilingual teachers will force them to hire instructors lacking proficient 
Spanish and language development skills. 
</P>
<P>
The district needs to hire two new teachers before September to cope with an 
increasing number of students with limited English skills and to meet the 
requirements of a state-mandated plan on bilingual education, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"I know we will be able to fill the positions, but they will have to be 
teachers who are in training," said Robert Isenberg, director of special 
programs and testing. 
</P>
<P>
"All are credentialed teachers, and all of them have an aide in the classroom 
who speaks Spanish. The program will be able to continue, but there is no doubt 
that a teacher who is not trained in language development cannot be as 
effective as a teacher who is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Simi Valley Board of Education voted unanimously to submit a 
plan to the state that calls for 14 bilingual teachers, two more than are now 
on the payroll. Teachers hired over the summer who do not have a bilingual 
credential will receive training from the district, Isenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 627 students with limited English skills are expected in the 
district this fall, an increase of 127 over last year, officials said. Of 
those, 212 will enter elementary bilingual classes and 173 will enter secondary 
bilingual classes. The rest will enroll in traditional classes, at their 
parents' request. STEPHANIE STASSEL

GIRL'S 12TH BIRTHDAY SURPRISE ENDS IN A TRAGIC PLANE CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
An experienced private pilot was attempting to surprise his 12-year-old 
daughter by dropping a birthday present for her from the sky when he crashed 
into a hill on Santa Catalina Island, police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot, Robert Harder Sr., 38, of Rossmoor, suffered head injuries in the 
Tuesday afternoon crash and was in critical but stable condition at Harbor-UCLA 
Medical Center. His 15-year-old son, Robert Harder Jr., was pronounced dead at 
the scene, said Sheriff's Deputy Hal Grant. 
</P>
<P>
The plane's third occupant, Jonathan Benzinger, 33, of Long Beach, was in 
serious condition at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, a hospital employee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators from the National Transportation and Safety Board and the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Aero Bureau were studying the wreckage Wednesday but 
had not determined what caused the single-engine Cessna Skyhawk to crash, said 
Sheriff's Sgt. Ray Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Just after 5 p.m. Tuesday, Harder flew over Catalina's Toyon Bay where his 
daughter, Lisa, was attending a summer camp run by the Catalina Island Marine 
Institute, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A friend of Harder said the pilot had been planning to drop a package 
containing a stuffed animal for his daughter, who turned 12 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa was on the camp field near the beach but did not witness the accident, 
said Ross Turner, executive director of the marine institute. She was waiting 
on the field for something to happen but did not know what her father had 
planned, Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said they saw something drop from the plane before it disappeared 
into a canyon where the crash occurred, Avalon police said. 
</P>
<P>
A woman at the family's home, who said she is the girl's grandmother but 
declined to give her name, said Lisa returned to the mainland Tuesday and was 
in a state of shock after learning about the accident. 
</P>
<P>
The woman called the crash a tragedy and said: "We have a large family and lots 
of support." 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Morrow, a friend of Harder and also a pilot, said Harder is a regular at 
the Avalon airport and knows the island from the air and the ground. Morrow 
said Harder owns a gas station at Long Beach Airport and also repairs and 
maintains vehicles at a number of Catalina businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors of the Harders said the family moved from Long Beach to Rossmoor in 
Orange County about three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Morrow described Harder as "a pretty dedicated father, a real stable family 
man." 
</P>
<P>
A plane crashes about once a year on the island, said Los Angeles Fire Capt. 
Rick Harp, who was at the scene Tuesday. "Frequently the plane flies too low 
and too slow" while viewing the scenery, Harp said. In hot weather, the air 
becomes thinner and makes it more difficult for a plane to lift out of a 
canyon, Harp said. 
</P>
<P>
Harder's plane slammed into the hillside, but it stayed in one piece and did 
not explode, said J. J. Poindexter, a volunteer paramedic with the Sheriff's 
Catalina Rescue Team who responded to the emergency. The plane was resting 
about 200 feet above the floor of the canyon, Poindexter said.

PRESERVING PIERCE COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Things are happening at Pierce College that have many of us more than just 
"concerned." In the past two months we have observed: 
</P>
<P>
1. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce's campus/farm being proposed as an alternate site for the Arts Park 
project originally proposed for the Sepulveda Basin. 
</P>
<P>
2. The Discovery Pavilion children's science museum continuously being referred 
to in press clippings as having a future home on 6 1/2 acres on Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
3. The announcement from Pierce College administration that the Farm Store has 
been closed, the Dairy Program has been discontinued and the milking cows will 
be sold off almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
4. The highly successful forensics program has been dropped from the fall 
schedule, along with a humanities program. 
</P>
<P>
The campus and farm land at Pierce College is a public asset that must be 
preserved for the educational opportunities of current and future generations. 
</P>
<P>
The San Fernando Valley has CSUN. It is busting at the seams. 
</P>
<P>
Another four-year college or university in the San Fernando Valley will 
eventually become mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
Where will the land come from? The public land at Pierce must be preserved for 
inevitable future higher educational needs. 
</P>
<P>
We call upon all of our public officials, from the Community College Board of 
Trustees to the City Council, Mayor Bradley, and our state elected officials, 
to recognize now, while there is still time, that we must look ahead. 
</P>
<P>
It's time to stop all of the speculation and posturing regarding the proposals 
for the piecemeal of the Pierce land. 
</P>
<P>
The most prudent approach should be and must be to retain all of it for the 
future.

FIREWORKS IGNITE BLAZE IN OAK VIEW RIVERBED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two juveniles and an adult started a brush fire Wednesday while setting off 
fireworks in the dry bed of the Ventura River in Oak View, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County firefighters doused the flames before the fire had burned more 
than half an acre, said Ventura County Sheriff's Lt. Michael Gullon. 
</P>
<P>
But officials had been concerned about the fire's potential to spread. 
</P>
<P>
"It was scary because a brush fire could start another big fire," Gullon said, 
referring to the blaze that burned nearly 5,000 acres in Santa Barbara County 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
The two juveniles were cited for unlawfully starting a fire and released to the 
custody of their parents, Gullon said. The adult was not cited. He was released 
pending further investigation, Gullon said. 
</P>
<P>
The Oak View fire was the second minor brush fire in the county Wednesday. A 
two-acre fire erupted just after midnight in the dry hills south of Simi 
Valley. Authorities were investigating the cause of that fire, a County Fire 
Department spokeswoman said.

THE GRAFFITI MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How ridiculous can politicians get? The City Council -- at the instigation of 
Joel Wachs -- proposes to collect an initial fee (euphemism for tax) of 50 
cents per month to clean up graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
Of course this will be added to DWP bills along with a number of other non-DWP 
charges, hopefully to escape the attention of taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
This is clearly sending the wrong message to the vandals. 
</P>
<P>
We are saying: "It's all right to create graffiti and we are willing to pay 
additional tax to clean up after you." The City Council is confident the tax 
will go unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
Is that the message we should be sending? 
</P>
<P>
Why not attack the problem at its source? Have a special police group organized 
to deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
Have the vandals, as they are caught, clean not only their own mess but also 
some of the residual mess. 
</P>
<P>
Their residence until the job is completed: Jail. 
</P>
<P>
A tax -- hopefully not disguised as a DWP fee -- would be appropriate for such 
an effort.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unpaved portion of Mulholland Drive that in the past has drawn hundreds of

FLAWED MIRROR HAMPERS HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Get off NASA's case ("Hubble: Like a Shot in the Dark," editorial, June 30). 
Where was The Times when the space telescope mirrors were being tested? You 
should have alerted us before the launch about the inadequacy of NASA's 
oversight. 
</P>
<P>
Now, any idiot can yelp indignantly through a haze of self-righteous hindsight. 
</P>
<P>
America has an intolerance for failure which can actually be self-defeating. To 
scream, as The Times has done, for cuts in its budget and increasing scrutiny 
may damage NASA more than serving any constructive purpose. The space telescope 
is a new system of incredible complexity. 
</P>
<P>
Mankind has achieved progress in fits and starts as new concepts are refined, 
or proven unworkable and abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
There will probably be more colossal failures ahead for NASA, resulting from 
pushing the leading edge of technology. We must be more tolerant of such 
failure, unless clear incompetence is proven. Perhaps all countries could form 
a cooperative effort on the more expensive missions, but to "punish" NASA for 
failure, rather than working constructively to improve its operation is 
dangerously shortsighted.

CARSON SUED OVER MOBILE HOME RENT LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carson's largest mobile home park filed a federal lawsuit against the city this 
week, asking $25 million in damages and seeking to overturn portions of the 
city's strict mobile home rent control ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Citing a federal appeals court decision, the suit seeks to eliminate a 
provision, known as vacancy control, that prevents park owners from increasing 
the rent for a space when a resident sells a mobile home to a new tenant. The 
suit, filed Monday by the 409-space Carson Harbor Village, says this provision 
is unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
In a second line of attack, the suit also seeks to relax Carson's formula for 
rent increases, which in general permits them only to pay for higher operating 
costs and capital improvements. Referring to a recent state Supreme Court 
decision, the attorney for the park said rent control should not prevent park 
owners from earning a reasonable profit on their investment. 
</P>
<P>
The filing of the federal lawsuit follows a series of similar lawsuits filed in 
state Superior Court by the Colony Cove, Carson Gardens, Avalon Carson and 
Shangri Lodge, all Carson mobile home parks. The cases, which date from last 
October, are still pending. 
</P>
<P>
In challenging Carson's vacancy control, the Carson Harbor Village lawsuit 
cites a 1986 federal appellate decision in a case involving a Santa Barbara 
mobile home park. The ruling said preventing rent increases when a tenant moves 
out can result in an unconstitutional seizure of private property by the 
government because rent control may enable mobile home residents to sell their 
units at artificially inflated prices. Park owners, whose rents remain low, may 
lose out, the court held. 
</P>
<P>
The appellate decision was cited May 30 by Senior U.S. District Judge Laughlin 
E. Waters when he struck down vacancy control for about 7,000 mobile homes in 
the city of Los Angeles. Waters awarded $1 million in damages to the owners of 
the Tahitian Terrace mobile home park in Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
In arriving at the amount of damages, Waters analyzed comparable sales of 
mobile homes and ruled that 48 mobile home owners who had sold their units 
during the preceding year had reaped profits averaging $20,000 because the new 
tenants' rents remained controlled. 
</P>
<P>
In the suit filed against Carson, attorney Richard Close said a study of sales 
in Carson Harbor Village estimates that the value of a mobile home there is 
about $50,000 higher than the value of a comparable mobile home in areas 
without vacancy control. The suit seeks damages for each unit, whether or not 
it has been sold. 
</P>
<P>
But Coni Hathaway, chairwoman of Homeowners Against Rent Decontrol, the city's 
most active mobile home owners organization, said mobile homes in Carson do not 
sell for more than those in comparable parks outside the city where there is no 
rent control. 
</P>
<P>
Hathaway said her organization is collecting data on mobile home sales prices. 
"Our preliminary analysis shows that, comparable-to-comparable, they are the 
same," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Hathaway said the city should fight to keep its mobile home ordinance to 
maintain the stock of affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
"Because real estate values have gone up so high, mobile homes now provide an 
ideal way for a family or an older couple to be able to afford a home," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Close countered that the city is ignoring the federal appellate decision at 
considerable legal risk and urged that Carson eliminate vacancy control, as 
several other cities have done, before a judge forces the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"Carson will lose like the city of Los Angeles lost," he said. "Can the 
taxpayers of Carson afford the bill? What services is the City Council going to 
cut to pay various mobile home park owners?" 
</P>
<P>
In attacking the often-upheld concept of rent control, Close said he hopes that 
the reasoning of a more conservative state Supreme Court will be persuasive in 
the federal lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that in a case involving Proposition 103, the auto insurance 
initiative, the state Supreme Court recently held that insurance companies are 
entitled to fair rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
"Likewise, we say that landlords are entitled to a fair rate of return," Close 
said.

FLAWED MIRROR HAMPERS HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article "Space Telescope Dealt Setback by Mirror Flaw" (Part A, June 28) 
once again proves to me how the federal government is willing to spend billions 
and billions of dollars on projects that usually don't work and only serve the 
interests of the wealthy and not the poor. 
</P>
<P>
It's unfortunate that the Hubble Space Telescope is blind as a bat, but I think 
the proposed solutions for correcting its flaws are stupid. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of wasting another trip by the space shuttle to try and repair this 
expensive device, I feel it should be brought back to Earth for repairs. Then 
if it can't be fixed here on Earth -- sell it for junk! 
</P>
<P>
I am getting sick and tired of seeing my tax dollars being spent on expensive 
projects that serve no useful purpose. Billions were spent on the Stealth 
bomber and it can be seen. Billions were spent on the Sgt. York gun and all it 
did was shoot itself in the foot. Now, billions are going to be spent for a 
super-collider that will no doubt prove nothing. Pray tell, what horrors does 
Washington have planned for our next billion-dollar project? I hate to venture 
a guess, but how about trying to reinvent the wheel? Maybe the Hubble could 
photograph it?

MARION BARRY'S TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a counselor for recovering addicts I must say that the government's 
treatment of Washington Mayor Marion Barry was very sleazy. Worse, it was 
immoral. 
</P>
<P>
Here we have the mayor stating on FBI tape that he has been clean for a while. 
The quote is "I've been so goddamn good . . . I've even surprised myself . . . 
no women and none of that kind of (cocaine) stuff." Yet, what do our police 
servants do? They entice Barry to fall off the wagon. They actually bring him 
cocaine, drug paraphernalia, and a friend to talk him into using it. 
</P>
<P>
Recidivism is very common among users trying to quit. Yet to have our very own 
government officials take advantage of that fact, just so that they can score a 
few political points and thereby quiet a critic of the Bush Administration is 
very shameful. 
</P>
<P>
Further though, is the greater irony that while Barry's fall from grace was 
being orchestrated, the same FBI and Bush Administration were not taking any 
meaningful action on the reports that officers and friends in the U.S. attorney 
general's office were also doing cocaine.

FLAWED MIRROR HAMPERS HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Discovery of an apparent flaw in the Hubble Telescope has been accompanied by a 
flurry of statements and speculations relating to the management and technical 
execution of the program. Since the Hughes name has been associated with the 
technical difficulties, I feel it is important to clarify the Hughes 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
The Hubble mirrors were manufactured almost 10 years ago by a division of the 
Perkin-Elmer Corp. This organization was acquired late last year by the Hughes 
Aircraft Co. and renamed Hughes Danbury Optical Systems. Hughes is fully 
supporting the technical teams both at NASA and at Danbury in analyzing and 
correcting the problem as soon as possible. The full range of Hughes 
technologies are being made available for this effort. 
</P>
<P>
I am obviously concerned about the Hughes name and our technology -- neither of 
which are in question here.

MAYOR'S RELIGIOUS BELIEFS DISCLOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding "Mayor Gets Council to Take a Dry View," (Times, June 15): 
</P>
<P>
Shawn Hubler, the reporter, informs us that Mayor Brad Parton "is a 30-year-old 
'born again' Christian." 
</P>
<P>
She does not tell us the religious beliefs of any other speaker or council 
members quoted. 
</P>
<P>
Come on, let's be fair. If personal beliefs are important to the story, why not 
tell us if Ernie O'Dell, Mark Conte or Councilwoman (Barbara) Doerr are 
atheists, Catholics, Baptists or Jews? 
</P>
<P>
Better yet, should we know if they are "born-again" Catholics, etc.? I fail to 
see what anyone's personal beliefs along those lines have to do with attempting 
to provide a healthy, safe environment for the public. Mayor Parton serves on 
the Beach Cities Coalition for a Drug Free Youth and is trying to take 
constructive action toward that goal, unlike the alcohol and other drug 
pushers.

TORRANCE SEEKS WAYS TO RETAIN HEALTH CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Torrance City Council members said Tuesday that they hope to persuade Los 
Angeles County officials to retain the county-operated health center in 
Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
A recent county report questioned the seismic safety of the Torrance Health 
Center at 2300 W. Carson St. County officials are considering renovating the 
structure, constructing a new center or moving the facility to another city. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Katy Geissert said she would prefer that the county look into 
rehabilitating the 58-year-old structure. "That is a beautiful old building. I 
would like to see that building restored," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Bill Applegate said the city's primary focus has to be keeping 
the center in the city -- not renovating the building. "The paramount thing is, 
we want the center to remain in Torrance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Geissert said the council may be able to draw support from 
neighboring cities that use the Torrance Health Center. 
</P>
<P>
Hugo Almeida, chief executive officer for the Coastal County Health Centers, 
part of the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services, said in an 
interview that the recent study showed the health center may not withstand an 
earthquake of 6.5 or greater intensity. He said a follow-up study is due out 
shortly. 
</P>
<P>
Costs have been estimated at $1.2 million for renovation, Almeida said. The 
county also may look at leasing space in Torrance, or the center could be 
consolidated with another facility in San Pedro or elsewhere, he said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SPRING VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man whose nude body was found floating face down in Sweetwater Reservoir in 
Spring Valley was identified Wednesday as a 29-year-old San Diegan, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The body, identified as that of Johnny Smith by the San Diego County medical 
examiner's office, was spotted shortly after 7:30 p.m. Tuesday by a man who was 
fishing near a house that backs up to the waterline in the 9500 block of San 
Carlos Street, according to a Sheriff's Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy determined that Smith drowned, but police said Wednesday that it was 
not known how Smith came to be in the water or why he was nude. The 
investigation into the incident is continuing, police said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Police are investigating the homicide of a man who was shot dead in a city 
apartment complex early Wednesday, apparently during an attempted robbery. 
</P>
<P>
The identity of the victim, who was described as a Latino male in his early 
20s, remained unknown. 
</P>
<P>
His body was found on the second-floor balcony of an apartment in the 1700 
block of McKinley Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the slaying occurred at about 8 a.m., when two men attempted to rob 
another man in the apartment complex. Someone fired a shotgun blast, police 
said, hitting the victim. Several suspects immediately fled the area, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear whether the shotgun was wielded by the suspected thieves, an 
intended victim or a third party, according to investigators.

<P>
Thieves stabbed and killed one undocumented man and injured at least two others 
during an early-morning robbery spree Wednesday along the U.S.-Mexico border, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
The attacks took place near the southern levee of the Tijuana River, a popular 
illicit international crossing zone, police said. Among those injured was one 
migrant who was stabbed but survived and was hospitalized in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
The assaults occurred at a time when San Diego police have bolstered patrols in 
the hazardous border strip in response to what authorities say is rising crime, 
particularly in the rugged area west of the port of entry at San Ysidro. 
</P>
<P>
Robbers have long preyed on the hundreds of migrants who each day attempt to 
enter the United States without inspection by traveling across the rugged 
border terrain. 
</P>
<P>
The man killed Wednesday was at least the seventh person murdered by suspected 
thieves in the border zone in San Diego during 1990, according to police 
figures. There were five such killings during all of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The dead man was identified as Alejandro Soto Moreno, 25. His nationality and 
other details about him were not available. 
</P>
<P>
Police said he was among a group of up to 20 undocumented immigrants who were 
attacked by three male robbers at about 12:30 a.m. The migrants had gathered 
along a hilltop near the southern levee of the Tijuana River, at a spot about 
two miles to the west of the San Ysidro border crossing and about 20 feet north 
of the international boundary, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
The assailants brandished knives and clubs, said Bill Robinson, a police 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The other stabbing victim was identified only as Miguel Munoz. He was listed in 
serious condition at UC San Diego Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
A third victim, whose name was not available, was treated at the scene for 
minor injuries, police said. 
</P>
<P>
No suspects were in custody, police said.

MICROWAVE: YOU CAN LEND AN EAR OR TWO TO THIS METHOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN ANDERSON and ELAINE HANNA, Anderson and Hanna are nutritionists and 
cookbook authors specializing in microwave cookery. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They begin arriving every year about this time and they're as predictable as 
mosquitoes -- but a lot more pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
We're talking about the avalanche of telephone calls and letters from friends, 
neighbors, relatives and strangers asking if they can microwave corn on the 
cob. And if so, how? 
</P>
<P>
It's a subject we covered a couple of years ago, but because there's no let-up 
in the number of inquiries we get at the peak of sweet corn season, we will 
repeat the directions here for microwaving fresh corn on the cob. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing, we think, demonstrates the microwave's prowess better because you can 
place the ears of fresh corn inside, husks and all, then retrieve them minutes 
later, bursting with sugary goodness. The silk magically comes away with the 
husks and the corn's just-picked taste seems all the richer for its having been 
steamed in its natural wrapper. 
</P>
<P>
You can cook as many as six ears of corn at a time and keep the hot ears coming 
throughout your corn feast, but you should start with top-quality corn, the 
fresher the better. 
</P>
<P>
Fresh ears will cook quicker than older ones, and not surprisingly, small ears 
faster than big ones. 
</P>
<P>
If the husks seem dry, rinse the ears in cool water, then place no more than 
four ears at a time 1-inch apart on the microwave oven floor. An extra two ears 
can go on the shelf above, but no more because the corn won't cook evenly. 
</P>
<P>
Microwave the ears of corn, uncovered, on HIGH (100% power) using the following 
times as a guide: 
</P>
<P>
 1 ear -- 2 to 3 minutes 
</P>
<P>
 2 ears -- 3 to 4 minutes 
</P>
<P>
 4 ears -- 5 to 6 minutes 
</P>
<P>
 6 ears -- 7 to 8 minutes 
</P>
<P>
 Turn ears over and rearrange them at half time, moving those on the outside 
toward center and vice versa. Check for doneness after minimum cooking time by 
peeling husks back slightly and pressing a few kernels. They should feel 
springy-firm, not soft, because corn will finish cooking as it stands. 
</P>
<P>
If corn seems too firm, smooth husks back into place and continue microwaving 
ears in 30-second increments until kernels are springy-firm. 
</P>
<P>
Remove ears from the microwave and let stand, in the husk, three minutes. Let 
everyone shuck his or her own corn at the table (don't forget to put out a huge 
bowl to catch the husks). 
</P>
<P>
Serve with plenty of butter or margarine, salt and pepper, or for a change of 
pace, try one of these savory butter sauces. 
</P>
<P>
HERB BUTTER SAUCE 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup chilled unsalted butter or margarine 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon minced fresh marjoram or 1/4 teaspoon crumbled dried 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon minced fresh thyme or rosemary or 1/4 teaspoon crumbled dried 
</P>
<P>
Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
Place butter in microwave-safe 1-pint measure. Cover with wax paper and melt by 
microwaving on HIGH (100% power) 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 minutes. Stir in lemon juice, 
marjoram, thyme and season to taste with pepper. Cover with wax paper and 
microwave on LOW (10% power) 2 to 3 minutes. Makes 1/2 cup. 
</P>
<P>
GARLIC BUTTER SAUCE 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup melted butter or margarine 
</P>
<P>
2 cloves garlic, crushed 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
</P>
<P>
Combine butter, garlic, salt and pepper in microwave-safe 1-pint measure. Cover 
with wax paper and microwave on LOW (10% power) 2 to 3 minutes. Strain. Makes 
1/2 cup. 
</P>
<P>
CHILI BUTTER SAUCE 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup melted butter or margarine 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon chili powder 
</P>
<P>
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
</P>
<P>
Combine butter, lemon juice, chili powder and pepper in microwave-safe 1-pint 
measure. Cover with wax paper and microwave on LOW (10% power) 2 to 3 minutes. 
Makes 1/2 cup. 
</P>
<P>
Note: In ovens of less than 600 watts, increase cooking times about 15%.

HINTS FROM HELOISE: SUN TEA -- SOLAR POWER MAKES IT EASY AND TASTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: What is sun tea? I've seen special jars for it in the 
supermarkets and even have seen special teas, but I haven't been able to find 
out exactly what it is. 
</P>
<P>
 -- JANIE, Dallas 
</P>
<P>
DEAR JANIE: Sun tea is just that -- tea made by warmth from the sun rather than 
with boiling water. It's popular because it makes very smooth tea and is really 
easy to do. 
</P>
<P>
Fill a large jar with water, put in the number of tea bags for the servings 
you're making and place the container in the sun. That's all there is to it, 
thanks to solar power. In a couple of hours you'll have great-tasting tea 
without heating up the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Special sun-tea jars are handy because they usually have spigots and handles, 
but any large glass jar or pitcher will do. Plastic may take a little longer. 
</P>
<P>
No sunshine? Make the tea indoors by just letting the jar sit on a counter or 
even in the fridge. It takes longer but it works. 
</P>
<P>
We drink ice tea all year long here in Texas, and sun tea is an easy way to 
always have a ready supply. Experiment a little and I'm sure you'll discover 
why it's so popular. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I enjoy baking cookies, but the cooling racks I find in stores 
are never large enough to suit me so I made my own. 
</P>
<P>
When our old refrigerator broke down and had to be replaced, I kept the wire 
shelves. I scrubbed them well and now they make great cooling racks large 
enough to accommodate all my cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 -- JANET, Carmel, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I'm trying to use my microwave more, but I'm not sure about some 
recipes. Do I need to change the amount of seasonings used, or is it just the 
same as regular cooking? 
</P>
<P>
 -- TIM, Newark, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR TIM: Most seasonings can be added as usual to recipes for cooking in 
microwave ovens, but there are a couple of things to be aware of. 
</P>
<P>
Salt shouldn't be sprinkled on food; the crystals can reflect the microwaves 
and cause uneven cooking. Dissolve it in liquid or mix it into the food. Better 
yet, don't add the salt until just before serving. 
</P>
<P>
Pepper becomes more intense when microwaved, so use it sparingly in recipes, 
then add more to taste after cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Try different amounts of seasonings in recipes and see what pleases you. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I use a clean old toothbrush to scrub hand-held food graters. It 
gets into all the holes and really gets the grater shiny-clean in a hurry, with 
no scraped knuckles or torn dish rags. 
</P>
<P>
 -- SHANNON, La Grange, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I enjoy watching television cooking shows and it was almost 
inevitable that every time I was writing instructions down for a recipe the 
telephone would ring or someone would come to the door and I would miss a vital 
part of the recipe. 
</P>
<P>
Then I got a brainstorm. Tape the show with my VCR. Now if I have interruptions 
it's no big deal. An added bonus: When I get ready to cook I can run the tape 
and follow right along. Aren't VCRs wonderful?

VIOLENT DEATH FOR QUIET, GENTLE MAN; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: LASZLO SZEGEDI NEVER THREATENED THE TEEN-AGERS WHO SPRAYED GRAFFITI ON 
HIS FENCE -- UNTIL SUNDAY. HE CAME AT THEM WITH A RIFLE, BUT HE ENDED UP THE 
VICTIM INSTEAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By URSULA WILJANEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Friends describe Laszlo Szegedi as a gentle man who used his hands to create 
and repair, never to harm. When gang members sprayed graffiti on the fence of 
his Atwater sheet-metal business, the Hungarian immigrant would quietly ask 
them to stop. Then he would paint over it. 
</P>
<P>
"He never scream," said Frank Lebbeszki, a fellow Hungarian who operated a 
construction business on the same lot as Szegedi. "Of course he don't like it. 
But he never scream." 
</P>
<P>
The last time gang members painted his fence, however, Szegedi told Lebbeszki 
that he had had enough. "He said the next time, he does not ask. He just get 
action," Lebbeszki said. 
</P>
<P>
Szegedi, 39, was fatally shot late Sunday night with his own gun after three or 
four young men wrested it away from him in the driveway behind his apartment 
and adjoining shop, A-Z Sheet Metal at 3056 Glendale Blvd., Los Angeles police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The youths, who police estimate were 16 to 18 years old, shot Szegedi and a 
customer with a rifle that Szegedi brought out from the apartment to chase them 
away, Police Detective John Munguia said. 
</P>
<P>
The customer, Lorent Kis, 25, of Lancaster was in serious condition at 
County-USC Medical Center Tuesday with two gunshot wounds in his right upper 
torso, hospital spokeswoman Adelaida De La Cerda said. 
</P>
<P>
There are no suspects in the shooting and Munguia said police do not know 
whether it was gang-related. Police did not recover the weapon, and could find 
not any record of weapons registered in Szegedi's name, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Szegedi was taken to Glendale Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced dead 
of a gunshot wound to his chest at 12:25 a.m. Monday, Munguia said. He died 
just days before his mother was scheduled to arrive from Hungary to visit. 
</P>
<P>
Szegedi, who came to the United States at least eight years ago, had sent his 
mother a ticket to visit him and his sister, Georgina Jenei of Burbank, because 
Jenei is expecting a baby, Lebbeszki said. 
</P>
<P>
Szegedi "was so happy yesterday morning that his mother is coming this week," 
Lebbeszki said Monday. "One life come, one life gone." 
</P>
<P>
Police said Szegedi was working on Kis' trailer in the shop driveway and then 
left about 11:30 p.m., Munguia said. When he returned in his pickup, three or 
four youths accosted him in the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
Szegedi ran inside his apartment, grabbed his rifle and ran back out, Munguia 
said. The youths wrested the gun away from him and shot him and Kis, Munguia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Hernandez, who lives in an apartment in the same building, heard someone 
calling his name and ran outside to see Kis and Szegedi shot with the rifle and 
the youths running down the street. Hernandez, Szegedi's assistant, also saw 
the letter "T" sprayed on Szegedi's white truck, he told police. Terrified, he 
ran back inside and called police. 
</P>
<P>
Munguia, who impounded the truck, said police were trying to determine when the 
"T" was painted on the truck. "It doesn't mean anything right now," he said. 
The truck's windshield also was smashed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Janos Fejes, another Hungarian friend of Szegedi's, said that although most 
area residents would try to chase away youths vandalizing buildings, Szegedi 
usually used a more gentle approach. 
</P>
<P>
"He was always asking them, 'Why are you doing that? Please stop doing that,' " 
Fejes said. "He was a very quiet person." 
</P>
<P>
Friends of Szegedi's and Jenei's were packing Szegedi's belongings Tuesday, 
including a guitar and a keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very good with his hands. He was a genius," said family friend Michael 
Chapa. "And he would go out of his way to help people." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez said he could vouch for that. Szegedi took him under his wing soon 
after he emigrated from Guatemala about a year ago and taught him how to work 
with materials, he said. Szegedi also recently bought a truck from Lebbeszki to 
teach Hernandez how to drive, Lebbeszki said. 
</P>
<P>
Jenei, Szegedi's only relative in this country, will close down the business, 
Chapa said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what I will do," Hernandez said.

RAGGIO URGES CITY TO FORCE REPLACEMENT OF WOOD SHINGLES; 
</P>
<P>
FIRE: IN THE WAKE OF LAST WEEK'S DISASTROUS GLENDALE BLAZE, THE COUNCILMAN 
ASKED THE CITY MANAGER TO CONDUCT A FEASIBILITY STUDY ON SUCH A LAW.

<P>
A city councilman whose son's house was destroyed in Glendale's worst fire 
wants the city to force hillside homeowners to replace their flammable wood 
shingle roofs. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale, Los Angeles and other Southern California cities already prohibit 
wood shingles atop new houses and as replacement roofs because fire officials 
say the flammable material can quickly spread a blaze in a rugged brush area or 
even a crowded flatland neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Carl Raggio's plan would go a step further by forcing homeowners 
to spend thousands of dollars to replace their present roofs. The council has 
not acted on the proposed ban, but Raggio has asked City Manager David Ramsay 
to report within a few weeks on the feasibility of such a law. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that in Southern California there's a place anymore for these 
shake roofs," he said. "Somewhere here, every year, we have an inferno." 
</P>
<P>
Replacing a roof could cost $10,000 or more, but Raggio said the city should 
try to persuade lenders and insurance companies to assist with financing to 
minimize their future losses. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the Glendale blaze, the council also decided to reconsider its 
decision to cut 15 firefighters as a way to reduce city spending. 
</P>
<P>
On June 26, one day before the brush fire destroyed 46 hillside houses and 
damaged 20 others, the City Council approved a 1990-91 budget that 
</P>
<P>
eliminated a ladder truck company at Station 29 in Montrose. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted Tuesday to re-examine its Fire Department cutback and review 
other spending cuts and city tax proposals at a public session beginning at 8 
a.m. July 13. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's blaze caused some city officials to think twice about reducing the 
city's firefighting force, but Raggio's proposal represented a more 
controversial prevention tactic -- at significant cost to homeowners. Because 
the rules for such a ban were still under discussion, it was not immediately 
clear how many houses or which areas would be affected. 
</P>
<P>
But Glendale Fire Chief John M. Montenero said he supports Raggio's plan 
because the safety of a neighborhood should supersede one owner's decision to 
risk a house with a flammable roof. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't just their loss," he said. "Their house can be responsible for the 
start of a conflagration like the one we had. We have to look past individual 
rights and look at the impact on the whole community." 
</P>
<P>
But an industry spokesman said that if Glendale mandates the removal of 
existing wood-shingle roofs, it could face a tough court challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"That would be a first," said Michael Westfall, president of the Cedar Shake 
and Shingle Bureau. "There would be some very serious constitutional questions 
if they try to force something like that retroactively on a homeowner." 
</P>
<P>
He said his organization is already suing in federal court to overturn the Los 
Angeles ban on new shake roofs. He said that law is unfair because it excludes 
even wood-shingle roofs that are impregnated with a fire-retardant chemical. 
</P>
<P>
Westfall claimed that politicians and fire officials unjustly blame wood roofs 
in the wake of devastating fires. He said his organization sent to the Glendale 
fire scene a consultant who found wood-shingled houses that suffered little 
damage. In other Glendale cases, fully destroyed houses had roofs made of 
materials other than wood, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Raggio said his son had a fire-resistant asbestos roof. But he said the house 
was destroyed because a neighbor's shake roof caught fire and that blaze spread 
up the hillside to ignite his son's house. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the roof law, the councilman said he wants to require hillside 
homeowners to plant fire-resistant vegetation near roadways in place of brush 
that can be easily ignited by an arsonist from a passing vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Raggio wants to require hillside homeowners to install rooftop 
sprinkling devices that can be activated by the resident, a neighbor or 
firefighters. "The embers land but are doused" if the roof is kept wet, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Raggio must win the support of at least two other council members to enact the 
hillside fire protection measures, but the early reactions from his colleagues 
have been cautious. "I don't think they have the same zeal as I do," he 
conceded. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Larry Zarian said he wants hillside residents to replace their shake 
roofs but is concerned about the city forcing that cost on homeowners, some of 
whom are senior citizens with limited incomes. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to know how people are going to pay for it," Zarian said. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor said he has asked Gov. George Deukmejian and Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead 
(R-Glendale) to support legislation that would provide financial incentives to 
homeowners who replace their flammable roofs. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's council meeting, Zarian also publicly aired his second thoughts 
about cutting the Montrose fire crew from the budget last week. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Ramsay told the council that the truck company, staffed by three 
shifts of five firefighters, was rarely active because there are few high-rise 
buildings in that area. He said cutting that crew would reduce the budget by 
$974,000. 
</P>
<P>
But at Tuesday's council meeting, Ramsay said the immediate cost savings would 
not be as high as the council had originally believed. 
</P>
<P>
The council had ordered that the 15 firefighters not be laid off but that their 
jobs be eliminated gradually through attrition. Because only a few firefighters 
are expected to resign in the coming months, the city would only save $194,000 
this year, Ramsay said. The full $974,000 will not be saved for two to three 
years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale Firefighters Assn. issued a written protest, saying the cutback 
"could reduce the Fire Department's ability to protect life and property." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Montenero said that beyond high-rise fires, the Montrose crew 
staffs a reserve fire engine and responds to brush fires, traffic accidents and 
hazardous material spills. 
</P>
<P>
Zarian urged the council to hold a special meeting to discuss the fire crew, 
saying, "Maybe we did not have enough information on that truck company and its 
tactics." 
</P>
<P>
But Zarian and other council members warned that they will seek other 
reductions in city spending to lower the budget. Because the spending issues 
are tied to how much money the city takes in, the council delayed approval of 
new taxes and increases in water and electric rates until after its study 
session. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

PLAN TO COUNT L.A.'S STREET TREES COMES UNDER CITY HALL ATTACK; 
</P>
<P>
SURVEY: CRITICS SAY THE EFFORT WILL COST TOO MUCH AND WILL EXCLUDE TOO MANY 
AREAS. ABOUT 60% OF THE CITY'S ESTIMATED 680,000 TREES ARE TO BE COUNTED. 
</P>

<P>
A street-by-street inventory of the city of Los Angeles' sprawling urban forest 
is set to begin later this month, but the tally has come under fire by some at 
City Hall for being too expensive and not inclusive enough. 
</P>
<P>
Horticulturists using hand-held computers are to canvass sidewalks and parkways 
in an ambitious effort to count and characterize the city's enormous street 
tree population, believed to be the largest in the country. Environmentalists 
and city maintenance officials say the inventory will help the city preserve 
and better manage the tree population. 
</P>
<P>
But due to budget cuts, city officials predict the 15-month survey will exclude 
San Pedro, Wilmington, Harbor City, Harbor Gateway and portions of the Westside 
and northeast Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Kennedy, the city's street tree superintendent, said the count should cover 
about 60% of the city's estimated 680,000 street trees, starting in the San 
Fernando Valley and moving south until money runs out. "We just don't have the 
funding to do the whole thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who represents the Harbor area, said the tally 
should be postponed until the city is in better financial shape to canvass all 
communities. She complained that areas left out of the survey might never be 
counted, meaning trees there could get less attention than those in other parts 
of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"If they can't do the whole city, then they shouldn't do any of the city," 
Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
"The inventory is a good idea, but it is like dessert. We have a budget crunch. 
I question whether we have the luxury to count trees during a year when we are 
cutting the basics in the city," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Gloria Molina, who represents northeast Los Angeles, said she 
plans to challenge funding for the inventory during the council's annual budget 
review this month. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a good idea and a good goal, but it doesn't make sense when you don't 
have the money to carry it out completely," Molina said. "I would rather that 
we strengthen the city's tree-trimming capability before we start enumerating 
trees." 
</P>
<P>
The City Council allocated $500,000 for the tally in 1989 as part of a 
three-year, $1.5-million financing plan. But this year's $500,000 allocation 
was eliminated during budget deliberations. Confronted with what officials 
called the tightest financial squeeze in years, the council imposed 
across-the-board spending cuts for most departments, imposed a package of tax 
increases and abandoned plans for 403 new police officers in the 1990-91 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
"Next year, we are going to have an even worse year," said Flores, referring to 
warnings by economic consultants that the city's financial woes are not over. 
"I think it is more important to count police officers than it is to count 
trees at this point." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, however, said it is too late for the council to tinker with the 
$500,000 allocated last year for the tree inventory. The city's Board of Public 
Works awarded a contract in June to Irvine-based Golden Coast Environmental 
Services, which is charging the city $1 for each tree counted. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy defended the inventory as sound environmental planning. 
</P>
<P>
"We have major agreement in Los Angeles that our environment is a No. 1 issue, 
be it air quality or quality of life in general," he said. "I need to know how 
many trees are out there and how I can manage them so that we can keep them 
alive and healthy. They help clean the air, have a cooling effect and provide 
other direct benefits to everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Andy Lipkis, president of Tree People, an environmental group that has pushed 
for the inventory, said delaying the survey could lead to further "destruction 
of the city's infrastructure" by putting off better care for the trees. Lipkis 
said a partial count is better than no count at all. 
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, we will pay, and we will pay more if we don't make the initial 
investment now," Lipkis said. "It is vital that it get started. Ultimately, we 
need the whole thing. But having 60% is better than having nothing, and maybe 
we can figure out a way to get the job finished." 
</P>
<P>
Golden Coast's roaming horticulturists are to punch into computers information 
about each tree's location, size, species, height, diameter, health and 
maintenance needs. They will also document vacant sites where trees have died 
or been removed, and make special note of trees with potential historic or 
cultural significance. 
</P>
<P>
The data then is to be used by the city's street tree division to set pruning 
schedules, make suggestions to communities interested in planting trees, 
replace troublesome and dangerous trees, and recommend trees as city landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
The city now spends about $12 million a year on street tree maintenance. Trees 
are trimmed on a seven-year cycle based on geography, not on the particular 
needs of species. With the data base, city officials said they will be able to 
better dispatch their trimming crews and move away from "grid trimming," as the 
current system is called. Fruitless mulberry trees, for example, could be 
trimmed every three years, while magnolias, which require less care, could be 
trimmed on a 10-year cycle, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, you end up with some severe over-pruning of trees in order to have 
it last longer," Lipkis said. "What we have here is a mess, rather than a bunch 
of resources serving us." 
</P>
<P>
Cities across the country that have conducted inventories report that their 
street trees are healthier and are living longer, according to a spokesman for 
the American Forestry Assn., a nonprofit group based in Washington. In some 
cities, such as Milwaukee, street trees are living nearly twice as long as the 
national average of 32 years, said Gary Moll, the group's vice president of 
urban forestry. 
</P>
<P>
"It is real important," Moll said. "Trees produce all of their environmental 
benefits back to the city as they get bigger. The inventory helps you find out 
what the trees need and how to care for them so they do get bigger." 
</P>
<P>
West Hollywood, Redondo Beach and Santa Monica are among local cities that have 
conducted inventories in recent years. Officials from all three cities 
described the surveys as important management tools. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not just the inventory, but the supporting software that is helpful," 
said Cyndy Holtz, landscape superintendent for the city of West Hollywood, 
which conducted its survey last August. "For each tree in the city, the 
computer keeps a history. Any time we get a service request for a tree, we can 
use the computer to look at everything that has been done to it over the 
years." 
</P>
<P>
In Redondo Beach, the inventory identified 2,800 vacant street sites on which 
the city plans to plant trees over the next year, said Ken Dyer, superintendent 
of parks. Dyer said the computerized system has saved city officials hundreds 
of hours of time searching through tree-trimming files and records. 
</P>
<P>
But in Los Angeles, Councilwoman Molina predicted the computer technology will 
be of little use because the city does not have the money to provide more 
frequent or improved street tree services. She said the grid system, while 
imperfect, is the cheapest way to go. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, every tree on a certain street gets trimmed at the same time, and 
we barely can keep up with our tree-trimming schedule," Molina said. "To start 
identifying different trees and set up different schedules, I know, is 
physically impossible for this bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said the tally will begin in the west San Fernando Valley because the 
Valley contains "the bulk" of the city's trees and has a wide variety of 
species. 
</P>
<P>
Even that decision, however, has been challenged. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the reason we are doing this census is to see where is the imbalance," 
Flores said. "It seems they should start in the area where there are less 
trees."

GROUP GAINS IN FIGHT ON BILLBOARDS

In its first attempt to flex its political muscle, the Crescenta Valley Town 
Council has won a step in its battle to ban all new billboards in the 
semi-rural community. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Regional Planning Commission voted unanimously last week 
to recommend establishment of a billboard exclusion zone in La Crescenta and 
Montrose, an isolated, unincorporated island of county territory sandwiched 
between Glendale and La Canada Flintridge. 
</P>
<P>
The action recommends that the County Board of Supervisors permanently prohibit 
construction of any new billboards in the La Crescenta area. Action by 
supervisors is expected in about a month. 
</P>
<P>
The billboard issue was the first undertaken by the nine-member advisory 
council, formed 16 months ago by residents in a grass-roots effort to gain 
greater say over their community. The council has no direct legislative power 
but acts as an adviser to County Supervisor Mike Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
Residents had complained that giant billboards along Foothill and Oceanview 
boulevards, the main commercial strips, create a visual blight in the hillside 
community. Most of the billboards have cropped up in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed exclusion zone would prohibit all new signs. Existing signs could 
stay indefinitely, but could not be replaced or moved.

MAN-SON-HING FINDS FAULT WITH THE PRO TENNIS CIRCUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tennis fans around the world are eagerly awaiting the weekend, when the 
championship matches at Wimbledon will be contested. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Man-Son-Hing, who is among the eager, does not know what it's like to 
volley with Boris Becker or Ivan Lendl. But he is familiar with the grass 
courts at the All England Tennis Club. 
</P>
<P>
Man-Son-Hing, who lives in Glendale, spent the last three years traversing the 
globe to play in professional tennis tournaments, including all four Grand Slam 
events. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking from experience, then, Man-Son-Hing predicts a Becker-Lendl final on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Becker will win," Man-Son-Hing says. "But I'd like to see Lendl do 
it." Man-Son-Hing, 26, saw the world -- and a lot of the anonymous side of 
tennis -- during his three years as a pro. 
</P>
<P>
Professional tennis is contested at three levels -- the small qualifying 
circuits, the more advanced challenger division and, finally, the Grand Prix 
circuit that features Wimbledon and the French, U.S. and Australian opens. 
</P>
<P>
And while Becker, Lendl and the other top men and women bask in the glamour 
that comes with millions of dollars in prize money and endorsements, the vast 
majority of professional tennis players scrape by week to week. 
</P>
<P>
Man-Son-Hing, who grew weary of the vagabond existence, said he won $25,000 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets tiring after awhile, living out of a suitcase on the road for eight or 
nine months a year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's especially tough if you're not playing well. You're far away from home, 
in a foreign country, speaking a foreign language. 
</P>
<P>
"It can get real stale if you lose in the first round, then have to wait 
another week until the next tournament. If you lose in the first round again, 
you've played two matches in two weeks. It can get rough." 
</P>
<P>
Man-Son-Hing prepared for his stab at professional tennis by climbing 
consistently through the junior ranks. 
</P>
<P>
Born on the island of Grenada, Man-Son-Hing moved with his family to the Los 
Feliz area of Los Angeles when he was 9. 
</P>
<P>
He began playing tennis seriously when the family moved again, to Glendale, a 
year later. 
</P>
<P>
Man-Son-Hing was ranked as high as No. 6 in Southern California in the 
12-year-old division and went on to play No. 1 singles at Glendale High for 
three years. When he was 18, he was ranked among the top 10 in the nation in 
his age group. 
</P>
<P>
Man-Son-Hing attended UC Irvine, where he played No. 2 singles his first two 
years and No. 1 his final two. He also earned a degree in social science and 
then set out to try his luck on the pro tour. 
</P>
<P>
But he enjoyed his greatest successes last year playing doubles with John 
Letts. The pair had competed against each other in tournaments while they were 
growing up but decided to become partners after practicing together when Letts, 
who played at Stanford, moved from the South Bay to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
In their third tournament as a team, Man-Son-Hing and Letts won a $50,000 
challenger event at Brest, France. 
</P>
<P>
The pair won another $50,000 challenger event at Nagoya, Japan, and made it to 
the finals in Grand Prix events at Auckland, New Zealand and Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
Man-Son-Hing has clear memories of his appearances in the Grand Slam events. 
</P>
<P>
Of the French Open, where he lost in the first round of qualifying, he says: "I 
remember watching Michael Chang and Lendl play when Chang upset him in the 
final. I saw the first set, which Lendl won, and I left. Then I heard later 
that Chang had won." 
</P>
<P>
Of Wimbledon, where he made it to the second round: "You go there and you're 
kind of in awe. The grass courts and all the history are very impressive." 
</P>
<P>
Of the U.S. Open, where he lost in the first round: "It's noisy and the 
conditions are tough because the facilities are pretty bad." 
</P>
<P>
Of the Australian Open, where he advanced to the second round: "It was very hot 
there but we played well." 
</P>
<P>
Man-Son-Hing said he is happy to again have a home base and is enjoying 
teaching tennis to would-be pros of the future. 
</P>
<P>
"It (tennis) is a lot more enjoyable now that I'm not playing on the tour," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of pressure even when you played in local tournaments. You're 
playing on the tour so everybody thinks you should be winning the local 
tournaments." 
</P>
<P>
And now that Man-Son-Hing is no longer a pro, he is winning the local 
tournaments. Three weeks ago, he won the Los Angeles County Public Parks 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything about my experiences in tennis has been fun," Man-Son-Hing said. 
"I've seen a lot of different places and met lots of nice people. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been great."

ERICKSON EARNS HONORS WITH CATCHES

<P>
Quality, Aaron Erickson well tell you, is more important than quantity. It's 
not how often you do something, but how well you do it that counts. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, the folks who award most valuable player honors in the 
Glendale-Burbank All-Star Football Game agree because they honored the 
Crescenta Valley receiver after he made just two catches in last Saturday's 
game at La Canada High. 
</P>
<P>
Both catches, however, were instrumental in Glendale's 14-7 win. Erickson 
reeled in a seven-yard touchdown pass from Flintridge Prep quarterback Chris 
Bisgaard late in the third quarter for the deciding touchdown two plays after 
his 40-yard reception moved the ball to the Burbank 9-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Expanding horizons: Playing in their last high school football game, Bisgaard 
and Flintridge Prep teammate David Swayne, bound for Duke, got their first 
taste of 11-man football. 
</P>
<P>
Bisgaard and Swayne helped lead Flintridge Prep to the Southern Section 
Eight-Man Large Schools Division title last fall, sharing player of the year 
honors. 
</P>
<P>
"(The adjustment) wasn't that hard," said Bisgaard who connected with Swayne on 
a 27-yard pass on the game-winning drive. "I've been throwing in practice at 
Glendale College and I'm getting used to it. The field is wider and it's a lot 
easier to hit receivers. It's actually a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
Knockout: Erickson had chided Bisgaard about coming from an eight-man school, 
but that behavior stopped before the first practice was completed. 
</P>
<P>
"Chris has an arm on him," Erickson said of Bisgaard. "The first day of 
practice . . . one of the balls slipped right through my hands and gave me a 
black eye. He really rocketed it in there." 
</P>
<P>
Double elimination: The La Canada and Crescenta Valley boys' basketball teams 
lost in the fourth round of the L.A. Games last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
La Canada fell to Morningside on a desperation three-point shot at the buzzer. 
Manual Arts downed Crescenta Valley, 87-23. 
</P>
<P>
Goal-oriented: Chris Bruyere of Glendale is among 68 players from across the 
nation who will compete for 24 berths on the U.S. junior national hockey team 
next week at Colorado Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Bruyere, 16, played for the Culver City-based California Junior Kings. Last 
season, the 5-foot-10, 155-pound center had 30 goals and 47 assists in 40 games 
. 
</P>
<P>
Bruyere attended Hoover High, but will transfer in the fall to Berkshire Prep 
in Massachusetts to improve his chances for a Division I hockey scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
Clinic: Dennis Green of Stanford and Bruce Snyder of Cal are among the football 
coaches who will speak at a clinic sponsored by the Shrine Football Classic. 
The clinic is July 28 from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Shrine Auditorium in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Green will speak about rebuilding a program and Snyder will focus on the 
running game. 
</P>
<P>
Other coaches and their topics include USC defensive coordinator Tom Roggeman, 
inside linebackers and defense; Thousand Oaks Coach Bob Richards, staff 
structure and off-season workouts; Franklin Coach Armando Gonzalez, 
short-yardage passing; Fontana Coach Dick Bruich (defense). 
</P>
<P>
Information: (213) 749-0166. 
</P>
<P>
Bound for CSUN: Dave Swanson, an All-Western State Conference forward last 
season for the Glendale College basketball team, has accepted a scholarship 
from Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Swanson, who finished second in the state in the high jump and has a personal 
best of 7 feet, 1/2 inch, will also compete in track for CSUN.

2-YEAR DEADLINE SET BY GORBACHEV; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET REFORMS: HE SAYS HIS LEADERSHIP SHOULD STEP DOWN IF THE DRIVE HAS NOT 
SUCCEEDED BY THEN. CONSERVATIVES CONTINUE TO RIDICULE HIS EFFORTS.

<P>
As conservatives ridiculed President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's efforts at 
Western-style economic reform Wednesday, the Kremlin chief conceded that his 
leadership should resign in two years if it hasn't succeeded in bringing about 
change by then. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that in two years, if there are no changes, this leadership has to go 
of its own accord -- the same way it is showing courage now," he told reporters 
between sessions of the 28th Communist Party Congress, where his policies have 
been the target of repeated attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's suggestion that the leadership should step down in two years if the 
nation continues to suffer through the transition was the first time he has 
imposed a deadline on the drive for reform. 
</P>
<P>
Reformers were on trial Wednesday as rival factions within the party sharpened 
swords for a closed-door confrontation over the party's survival and the 
nation's future. 
</P>
<P>
But the Kremlin leader appeared confident that he can execute a turnaround of 
the declining living conditions afflicting his nation. 
</P>
<P>
In the brief exchange with journalists outside the Palace of Congresses, which 
was shown on Soviet nightly television news, Gorbachev denied that he seeks to 
protect his political power through reform. 
</P>
<P>
"I said this to our delegates and I want to say it to you, when people want to 
cast a shadow on us and call into question our plans and intentions," Gorbachev 
said. "Some people say 'They grabbed power and are holding onto it.' No, we're 
not. 
</P>
<P>
"I will tell you, before perestroika we had more power. I don't know who in the 
world had more power than the general secretary of the Communist Party." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said that if he sought only power, he would never have embarked on 
such an ambitious program to change Soviet society. 
</P>
<P>
During the first day of debate on Gorbachev's proposed party platform, Marxist 
hard-liners from the country's troubled provinces lashed out at 
"ill-considered" tampering under the banner of perestroika, blaming the reforms 
for dismantling the framework of Soviet society and crushing public confidence 
in the party's ability to rebuild it. 
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by conservative Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev's critical speech a 
day earlier lambasting "reckless radicalism," farmers, laborers and party 
bureaucrats from regions mired in economic woes turned their fire on leaders of 
the party that has ruled unchallenged for 73 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Political courage makes it necessary to admit that during perestroika, more 
has been broken than built," said Ayaz Mutalibov, the Communist Party leader in 
the southern Soviet republic of Azerbaijan, "and there is no one to blame apart 
from the party and its leaders." 
</P>
<P>
Those who sought to defend perestroika and the efforts to transform the 
stagnant state-run economy to a market-oriented system were heckled by the 
emboldened delegates fed up with change that has imposed steadily mounting 
hardships. 
</P>
<P>
The conservatives went on the attack early Wednesday when state farm director 
Anatoly Volochkov criticized the central government's highhandedness in dealing 
with the country's farmers. 
</P>
<P>
"Each peasant feeds 17 of those who walk around with slogans and blame the 
party for everything," Volochkov said, setting off thunderous applause. 
</P>
<P>
Lashing out at efforts to break up giant agro-industrial complexes and redirect 
resources to smaller, family-run farms -- a key element of Gorbachev's economic 
reforms -- Volochkov charged that this has brought chaos to the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
"They should bear in mind that a market is not a bazaar," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Turning on the intellectuals and technocrats who lead the reform drive, 
Volochkov accused Moscow radicals like Mayor Gavriil Popov of wanting to break 
up the Communist Party in order to seize its considerable wealth and power. 
</P>
<P>
Even a government minister, defense industry chief Boris M. Belousov, charged 
the party leadership with being unfaithful to the basic tenets of communism. 
</P>
<P>
"During perestroika, the Central Committee's ideological department turned away 
from the political struggle and the defense of Marxism-Leninism," Belousov 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The nearly 4,700 delegates to the pivotal conference are passing judgment on 
Gorbachev's five-year reform drive, which has shaken the foundations of 
socialism in its effort to stimulate the productive masses with personal 
freedoms and autonomy never imagined under authoritarian rule by the 
Communists. 
</P>
<P>
But party activists and working-class delegates have balked at what they see as 
a threat to the status and influence of the party installed in power by Soviet 
founder V. I. Lenin. 
</P>
<P>
They lashed out repeatedly at party failings since Gorbachev's introduction of 
perestroika in April, 1985. Their complaints, catalogued in six hours of debate 
on party policy, ranged from inter-ethnic strife to labor unrest to the 
haunting legacy of the Chernobyl nuclear accident four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates called on the party to determine who was responsible for the 
Chernobyl accident, which has been repeatedly raised at the congress as a 
shameful example of the government's ineffectual response to a disaster 
affecting millions. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's inability to contain nationalist and ethnic conflicts also came 
under attack as speakers recalled that hundreds of lives have been lost since 
perestroika cracked the facade of multinational harmony. 
</P>
<P>
Mutalibov, the Azerbaijani party leader, accused the Kremlin hierarchy of 
duplicity in suggesting that both Azerbaijan and Armenia have right on their 
sides in the battle for control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region, an Armenian 
enclave within Azerbaijan. He said that democracy, though a noble pursuit, has 
led to "a spilling of blood" in the Soviet Union's most backward regions. 
</P>
<P>
Other delegates revived the recurring theme of party privilege and the 
leadership's distance from the suffering of ordinary Soviet people. 
</P>
<P>
Albina Shutilova of the Kirov regional party said the Kremlin leaders have only 
"television contact" with the public. A Murmansk laborer told other delegates 
he was aghast to learn that each of the 12 Politburo members has a personal 
airplane at his disposal, while Soviet travelers routinely wait in airports for 
days for tickets on the hopelessly overtaxed Aeroflot network. 
</P>
<P>
The laborer, Nikolai Sidorkunin, went on to suggest -- one of the few to do so 
openly -- that Gorbachev step down. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the unification of posts has given no results, it should not be 
continued," Sidorkunin said, referring to Gorbachev's election to the state 
presidency in March while he remained the party's general secretary. 
</P>
<P>
While the Kremlin leader was often the indirect target of conservative 
criticism, most of the delegates who trooped to the podium to denounce his 
efforts at reform said there was no logical successor as party chief. 
</P>
<P>
"Mikhail Gorbachev began perestroika, and he should continue it to see its 
results," said Sokolov, the Byelorussia leader. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev told foreign reporters at the congress that, despite the harsh words 
for economic and social consequences of his reforms, no one was questioning the 
political course of perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
While the party leadership is "responsible for omissions, one should not forget 
that they displayed courage by starting this movement toward a new life," 
Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
Perestroika's tinkering with theories that have guided the government since the 
1917 Bolshevik Revolution appears to have confronted some Communists with an 
identity crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The new head of the Ukrainian Communist Party, Stanislav Gurenko, struck out at 
those "who have assumed an openly hostile stand with regard to the Soviet 
Communist Party and the people's socialist choice." 
</P>
<P>
Gurenko blamed the party leadership, especially Politburo members Vadim A. 
Medvedev and Alexander N. Yakovlev, for the erosion of ideology's role in 
government and society. 
</P>
<P>
Medvedev, a close Gorbachev adviser, was singled out repeatedly for criticism 
by delegates to the congress as a figure clinging to tired rhetoric when 
decisive actions and new plans are needed. 
</P>
<P>
A rumble of aggression swept the cavernous Palace of Congresses when Moscow 
party leader Yuri A. Prokofiev, a reform advocate, called for a "turn away from 
the events of the recent founding congress of the Russian Republic Communist 
Party." Conservative critics of perestroika had dominated that forum, 
denouncing the reforms as the undoing of what was already a troubled system. 
</P>
<P>
Derisive rhythmic clapping twice drowned out Prokofiev's defense of market 
economics, and Russian Republic party leader Ivan K. Polozkov, a rising star of 
the party right, had to intercede to persuade delegates to give all speakers a 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates break into separate groups today to hash over proposals on how the 
party should be managed.

<P>
THE PARTY CONGRESS: DAY THREE 
</P>
<P>
 Highlights of Wednesday's session of the 28th Communist Party Congress: 
</P>
<P>
 Gorbachev's deadline: President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, speaking outside the 
session, gave himself and the Soviet leadership two years to improve citizens' 
lives or resign. And at the congress, conservatives ridiculed the embattled 
president's efforts at Western-style economic reform, chiding him that "a 
market is not a bazaar." 
</P>
<P>
Strange alliance: Western-style reformers and ultra-Marxists, both alarmed by 
the mounting and venomous attacks of mid-level Communists on Gorbachev's 
leadership, moved to forge an odd-couple alliance at the party congress to 
prevent a takeover by bureaucrats -- the apparatchiks who are fighting to 
retain their dachas, new cars and other perks of party office. 
</P>
<P>
Sign of the times: One delegate, fed up with trying to get his name on the list 
of speakers, strode to the front of the hall and unfurled a sign reading, "I 
ask for the floor. I have something to say." It was signed "Master Koltsov." 
Despite his efforts, however, Koltsov was not given the floor and the sign was 
quickly removed. 
</P>
<P>
Key quote: "I think that in two years, if there are no changes, this leadership 
should go. . . ." -- Gorbachev, speaking to reporters outside the session.

24 RICH NATIONS SET TERMS FOR AID TO EASTERN EUROPE 
</P>

<P>
The industrialized world's 24 richest nations approved a U.S.-backed plan 
Wednesday to give economic aid only to countries committed to human rights, 
multi-party democracy and free-market economics. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called Group of 24, which is already coordinating a $14-billion aid 
package for Poland and Hungary, agreed to add Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, 
Yugoslavia and East Germany to the program but rejected both Romania and the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The group's decision to add the four Eastern European regimes was dimmed by its 
failure to put up any new money. 
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique, the foreign ministers of the 24 countries, all 
democracies, said the aid package "requires further financial efforts from the 
whole Western community." The statement said the ministers agreed to seek 
specific commitments from their own governments. 
</P>
<P>
In the communique, the foreign ministers said Romania could not be included 
because the new government of President Ion Iliescu has not adopted sufficient 
political and economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"They called on the Romanian government to resume the course of reform based on 
democracy, dialogue and peaceful change," the communique added. 
</P>
<P>
The declaration said the ministers only "exchanged views" about aid to the 
Soviet Union. It said the group was waiting for "positive developments of 
reform towards a democratic system and a market-oriented economy." 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the group adopted five criteria for 
assistance: adherence to the rule of law; respect for human rights; 
introduction of multi-party systems; holding free and fair elections, and 
development of market-oriented economies. 
</P>
<P>
"Western assistance is not meant to maintain the status quo but to reform it 
radically," Baker told a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
A senior State Department official said later that it is the first time that 
international aid-givers had ever imposed such strict political conditions. 
</P>
<P>
He said the group's action amounted to approval of Baker's doctrine of 
"democratic differentiation," which calls for democracies to assist other 
democracies while shunning authoritarian states. 
</P>
<P>
"It is enough of a trend that it is affecting attitudes globally," the official 
said. "Some African nations are talking about multi-party systems because they 
are concerned about this." 
</P>
<P>
The group shuffled off for additional study a proposal by the European 
Community for a separate, special fund of more than $12 billion to provide 
short-term emergency loans to Poland, Hungary and the four newly approved 
recipients. 
</P>
<P>
Frans Andriessen, the community's vice president for foreign affairs, said the 
six nations need enormous amounts of short-term aid to stabilize their 
economies. He said he is not discouraged by the failure of the plan to win the 
group's approval and he predicted that such a "safety net" would be adopted 
eventually. 
</P>
<P>
The group took no action on a suggestion by Baker to establish a separate 
coordinated aid program for democratic governments in Central America. Baker 
said he would raise the matter again at a later meeting. A U.S. official said 
Baker envisioned a group smaller than the 24 aiding Eastern Europe to provide 
money for Central America. 
</P>
<P>
Andriessen, the informal chairman of the group, said the "door is open" for 
Romania if the Bucharest regime changes its policies. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Soviet Union, he said the group wants to await the results of a 
study ordered last week by a summit of the 12-nation European Community in 
Dublin. 
</P>
<P>
But he added that the Soviet Union is "fundamentally different from all of the 
countries discussed today" because its massive economy needs far more money 
than the rest of Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said the United States wants to keep the Soviet Union out of the Group of 
24 process although Washington will not try to prevent its allies from aiding 
Moscow if they wish. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we should divert attention at this stage from the vital task of 
aiding those countries in Central and Eastern Europe that suffered for so long 
under a totalitarian regime by addressing now a provision of economic 
assistance to the Soviet Union," he said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said East Germany was included in the aid list to dramatize the 
democratic reforms adopted by the regime since the fall of the Berlin Wall. But 
the official said it is unlikely that East Germany would get any aid from the 
group because of its economic merger this week with affluent West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Baker stopped in Brussels on his way to a NATO summit meeting that begins today 
in London. 
</P>
<P>
On the trip from Brussels to London, however, he ran into the jaws of a French 
air traffic controllers' strike that disrupted flight patterns all over Western 
Europe. Baker's Air Force jet transport took on enough fuel for the scheduled 
hourlong hop. However, after the plane was forced to circle Heathrow Airport 
for more than 45 minutes waiting for a landing clearance, it had to land at 
Mildenhall, an air base about 70 miles from London shared by the United States 
and Britain, to refuel. Baker arrived in London three hours behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said aid for the Soviet Union may be discussed in London although it is 
not on the formal NATO agenda. He added that the subject is on the agenda for 
the seven-nation economic summit next week in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said President Bush probably will urge the economic summit to 
require Moscow to adopt political and economic reforms and to make sharp cuts 
in its massive military budget before Western nations consider any sort of 
assistance.

BUSH TO PROPOSE GLOBAL AID FOR LATIN AMERICA; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: THE EFFORT INVOLVING BILLIONS WOULD BE DESIGNED TO PROMOTE 
FREE-MARKET ECONOMIES. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration, in another major effort to help Latin America, is 
preparing a proposal to establish a multibillion-dollar international aid 
program for the region similar to the one the Western powers set up last year 
for Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Although President Bush has not given final approval to the plan, U.S. 
officials say he is likely to unveil it at next week's seven-nation economic 
summit in Houston. The aid program for Eastern Europe was launched at last 
year's economic summit in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal would mark the second major economic aid package for Latin America 
that Bush has proposed in two weeks. On June 27, he announced a sweeping offer 
to negotiate free-trade agreements with the Latins and forgive much of their 
debt to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The new aid fund, to which leaders of the six other countries would be asked to 
contribute, would be used to provide both emergency food and cash and to 
finance needed economic reforms designed to move Latin countries to free-market 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
As in the case of the aid program for East European countries, the money would 
go only to those countries that take the necessary steps to embrace democracy 
and convert their state-owned industries to private corporations. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear how much Bush might be able to persuade leaders of 
the other summit nations to contribute. The so-called Group of 24 aid plan for 
Eastern Europe has been pledged about $14 billion in aid, loans and technical 
advice, initially for Poland and Hungary but extended on Wednesday to 
Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the plan for Eastern Europe, which is being coordinated by the European 
Community, the new Latin proposal would be administered by the United States. 
Officials said the package would include money already voted for Panama and 
Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the Administration said Bush may also announce that he will 
step up his efforts to help Bolivia, Peru and Jamaica qualify for reduction of 
their debts to commercial banks under the Brady Plan, the United States' Third 
World debt plan. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico, Costa Rica and the Philippines already have qualified under the plan, 
but the proposal has bogged down. The plan is designed to help Latin 
governments buy back their debt from banks in exchange for guaranteed bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Bolivia, Peru and Jamaica are natural beneficiaries. Bolivia and Jamaica both 
have moved toward free-market economies, and Peru, which has been a pariah on 
the debt issue for the past four years, has a new pro-Western president-elect, 
Alberto Fujimori. 
</P>
<P>
Fujimori just completed preliminary negotiations for re-establishing relations 
with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, from which his 
predecessor, Alan Garcia, was estranged. Fujimori also has said he intends to 
resume payments to commercial banks. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said Wednesday that the proposal to establish a new Group of 24 
to help Latin America is the brainchild of Secretary of State James A. Baker 
III, who also was instrumental in winning U.S. backing for the Eastern Europe 
aid program. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Administration officials say Bush has become personally involved in 
trying to improve U.S. relations with Latin America on grounds that it is in 
U.S. interests to help the region economically to bolster its fledgling 
democracies. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past several months, Bush has gone out of his way to build 
relationships with key Latin American leaders, telephoning several of them 
frequently to discuss issues of interest to the region. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, he and Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari agreed to 
begin preliminary work on negotiating a U.S.-Mexico free-trade agreement that 
would be similar to the one that Washington has signed with Canada. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said that work on the new aid initiative, and the trade proposal 
that Bush unveiled June 27, has been rushed in preparation for the economic 
summit, which this year will be held in Houston, where interest in Latin 
America is high. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is scheduled to visit Brazil, Argentina and a third Latin American country 
still undecided in September, and U.S. strategists say he has tentatively 
planned to take three more trips to the region over the succeeding 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
The trade initiative that Bush announced June 27 was designed to reinforce 
moves by these and other Latin governments toward more market-oriented economic 
systems and encourage them to shed the centralized, state-controlled policies 
that have retarded their economies for decades. 
</P>
<P>
It also is aimed at countering fears by some leaders in the region that the 
growing focus of the Western powers on the emerging East European democracies 
will leave little or nothing in the international aid pot to help Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. analysts contend that if the Latin governments follow through, 
the trade plan could prove the most sweeping U.S. economic aid proposal for the 
region since President John F. Kennedy's "Alliance for Progress," designed to 
offset Cuba's growing influence in the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Bush told the region's leaders June 27 that he wants to forge a "new economic 
partnership" with Latin America that would help its fledgling democratic 
governments bolster the middle class and bring new prosperity to the region. 
</P>
<P>
The plan for Bush to propose a new international aid package for the region has 
not won unanimous endorsement inside the Administration. Officials say the 
Treasury Department opposes the scheme on grounds that it could undermine 
efforts to focus on trade ties. 
</P>
<P>
Besides President Bush, the participants at the Houston summit will include the 
leaders of West Germany, Japan, Britain, France, Italy and Canada and the 
president of the European Commission, the policy-setting body of the European 
Community.

MALE FERTILITY DROPS DURING SUMMERTIME, RESEARCHERS REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Sperm counts decrease during the summer, perhaps explaining the reduction in 
the birth rate during the spring in parts of the world with warm climates, 
according to a new study. 
</P>
<P>
The findings, which are being published in today's New England Journal of 
Medicine, may also help physicians treat male fertility problems. 
</P>
<P>
"It is more difficult for a man to impregnate a woman during the summertime 
than some other season, particularly the winter," said Dr. Richard J. Levine of 
the Chemical Industry Institute of Toxicology in Research Triangle Park, N. C. 
</P>
<P>
Levine, leader of the research team, said that male infertility patients might 
get better results if specialized treatments, such as injections of sperm 
directly into the uterus, were offered in the winter months when "the man would 
have more sperm to work with." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Peter J. Snyder of the University of Pennsylvania said that seasonal 
differences in sperm counts are probably not significant for men with normal 
fertility but might make a difference for men with borderline fertility. Snyder 
wrote an editorial for the medical journal about the study. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews, Levine and Snyder acknowledged that researchers do not fully 
understand the seasonal variations in sperm count. 
</P>
<P>
Levine and his colleagues compared semen specimens obtained in summer and 
winter from 131 normal men who worked outdoors near San Antonio, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
When compared to winter, they found "significant reductions" -- typically 
between one-quarter and one-third -- during the summer in sperm concentration, 
total sperm count in each ejaculation and the concentration of motile sperm, 
those most likely to fertilize an egg. 
</P>
<P>
The average sperm count decreased from 140.5 million sperm per milliliter of 
semen in the winter to 100.1 million sperm per milliliter in the summer. Both 
of these values are far higher than the lower limit of a "normal" sperm count, 
which is 20 million sperm per milliliter. 
</P>
<P>
But the proportion of men at greatest risk of infertility -- those with sperm 
concentrations of under 20 million sperm per milliliter -- increased from 1 of 
131, or less than 1%, in winter to 13 of 131, or about 10%, in summer. 
</P>
<P>
The study "raises the question of whether people with borderline fertility may 
be affected in this manner," said Dr. Jacob Rajfer, a urologist at the UCLA 
Medical Center who specializes in male infertility. But Rajfer cautioned that 
this question could not be answered until studies focusing on men with 
borderline sperm counts were performed. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers also tracked the month of birth for 73 children of the men, 
whose wives had lived within 250 miles of San Antonio during the year before 
childbirth. 
</P>
<P>
They found that about 29% of births occurred in the summer, 29% in the fall, 
25% in the winter and only 17% occured in the spring. There was a 6% 
possibility that these differences were due to chance. Most babies born in the 
spring were conceived during the preceding summer. 
</P>
<P>
In their analysis, the researchers accounted for other factors that can affect 
semen, such as sexual abstinence, which can increase the sperm count over the 
course of several days. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder praised the study, saying that "while other people have thought of this 
before," the new research "is just generally better done" and the results "are 
more believable."

MANDELA CALLS SANCTIONS DRIVE A SUCCESS; 
</P>
<P>
APARTHEID: WESTERN NATIONS BACK HIS EFFORT TO MAINTAIN CURBS AGAINST SOUTH 
AFRICA, HE SAYS AS HE WINDS UP MONTHLONG TOUR. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela ended his historic monthlong 
tour of the United States and Europe on Wednesday night, declaring that his 
mission to persuade the West to maintain economic sanctions against the South 
African government has "succeeded beyond our wildest dreams." 
</P>
<P>
"We go back to our country feeling that we have the full support of the 
international community," the South African black leader told a press 
conference here after meeting for three hours with Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher, who is Mandela's staunchest opponent on the issue of economic 
sanctions and the use of violent struggle by the ANC. 
</P>
<P>
Both Mandela and a spokesman for Thatcher agreed that the first-ever meeting 
between the two former adversaries produced no breakthroughs, with the British 
leader standing firm on her position that the European Community should relax 
its strict sanctions as a reward for South African President Frederik W. de 
Klerk's reform policies. 
</P>
<P>
"She stated her position, and we stated our position," Mandela said in 
describing the meeting in which the two leaders agreed to disagree. "But both 
of us did not feel it necessary to debate the issue." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, both sides took pains to put the best possible face on the lengthy 
luncheon meeting at the prime minister's residence, 10 Downing Street, which 
most analysts predicted would be the biggest hurdle of Mandela's tour. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a very good exchange," Thatcher's spokesman said. "They agreed to 
keep in touch." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Mandela used the words "warm and gentle" to describe Thatcher, 
who three years ago called the African National Congress, of which Mandela is 
deputy president, "a typical terrorist organization." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela described the meeting as "cordial" and "productive," adding, "I am very 
encouraged." 
</P>
<P>
"We have points of agreement on which we will concentrate," Mandela said, 
stressing, "There is no doubt that she is an enemy of apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
"The point is, we have started the process of consultations, and that is very 
important," he added. 
</P>
<P>
When the two leaders greeted each other in a light drizzle, they both smiled 
broadly and shook hands vigorously for the dozens of cameras outside on Downing 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the intensity and length of his tour, the 71-year-old Mandela showed no 
signs of strain or fatigue during the half-hour news conference. Instead, he 
brought several rounds of laughter when reporters tried to pin him down on 
issues as far-reaching as the Palestine Liberation Organization and the 
ideological debate raging in the Soviet Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
When one Soviet journalist asked him whether he supports President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev or Yegor K. Ligachev, Gorbachev's principal critic among Soviet 
conservatives, Mandela smiled and politely replied, "Don't recruit me." 
</P>
<P>
Several analysts saw such glib answers as an effort to avert controversies 
similar to the one Mandela touched off during his two-day visit to Dublin, 
where he called on Thatcher's government to negotiate with the Irish Republican 
Army, an organization that the prime minister views as a terrorist group trying 
to undermine democracy in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
Although Mandela's comment triggered a storm of debate in London, it was 
largely forgotten by the time he departed late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela also resisted journalists' efforts to pin him down to a timetable for 
sanctions. He had urged 250 top British industrialists to continue to support 
the sanctions for up to two years more during a speech Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We are aware of the damage which has been done to our economy by sanctions," 
he told the business audience. "And we do not want our economy to be reduced to 
ashes by the maintenance of sanctions. All we are saying to the international 
communities is, 'Give us a few months, if not a year or two, to resolve this 
question amongst ourselves.' "

MECCA VICTIMS MOURNED; IRANIANS CHARGE INCOMPETENCE BY SAUDIS

Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims wound up their rituals at Islam's holiest 
sites Wednesday while the Muslim world mourned the deaths of 1,426 people in 
the worst pilgrimage tragedy in modern history. 
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani said the tragedy proves that the Saudi 
royal family is incompetent to administer Islam's holiest shrines. 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani's harsh remarks ended hopes that relations might improve after Saudi 
Arabia sent generous relief supplies to victims of last month's earthquake in 
Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Most pilgrims left the plains of Mina by sunset Wednesday and headed for Mecca 
to make a farewell circle of the Kaaba, Islam's holiest shrine to which Muslims 
turn five times in daily prayer. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi authorities were setting up a large area at the holy sites for graves for 
those victims whose families want them to be buried at Mecca. To Muslims, to 
die and be buried in Mecca is a blessing. 
</P>
<P>
The accident was described by King Fahd as "the will of God." He referred to 
the June 21 quake in Iran that killed thousands: "The earthquake in the Muslim 
state of Iran: Could anyone stop that? Can anyone stop death? It is God's will 
above all." 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, in an interview with the official Islamic Republic News Agency and 
Tehran Radio, said it was "unacceptable" to liken the events in Mecca to the 
Iranian earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"Those officials responsible for administering the holy sanctuaries and the 
Saudi rulers should be answerable to the Islamic world," he said. "From such 
incidents it is clear that the level of the security of the pilgrims in Saudi 
Arabia should be increased."

GOVERNMENT, OPPOSITION AGREE ON TAIWAN REFORMS; 
</P>
<P>
DEMOCRACY: THE 'PEACEFUL REVOLUTION' CALLS FOR A POPULAR VOTE FOR PRESIDENT AND 
AN END TO ONE-PARTY RULE.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Taiwan government and opposition defused a constitutional crisis Wednesday 
and agreed on democratic reforms, including a popular vote for president to end 
four decades of one-party rule. 
</P>
<P>
An opposition leader called the decision a "peaceful revolution." 
</P>
<P>
A historic weeklong National Affairs Conference that concluded Wednesday agreed 
to give more power to native Taiwanese, dominated by the ruling Nationalist 
Party that retreated to this island from mainland China in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
President Lee Teng-hui called the meeting after student protests in March 
demanded the scrapping of the system that has preserved the Nationalists' lock 
on power. 
</P>
<P>
Lee told the delegates in a closing speech that he would support the 
recommendations by the 140 delegates, including 80 members of the ruling party 
and 16 representatives from the Democratic Progressive Party. Independent 
academics and politicians accounted for the remaining seats. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the time to act," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
Many delegates proposed popular presidential elections when Lee's term ends in 
1996, but some supported an earlier vote. 
</P>
<P>
"We have just had a peaceful revolution to gain democracy," said Chang 
Chung-hung, secretary-general of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party. 
"We can now organize a new government governed by law rather than by a few 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Convention delegates also supported direct election of the mayors of Taiwan's 
two largest cities, Taipei and Kaohsiung, who now are appointed by the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
And delegates ratified a Nationalist proposal to retire by 1991 all 800 elderly 
members of the lawmaking Legislative Yuan and electoral college from the 
mainland. 
</P>
<P>
A task force of representatives from the major parties will settle remaining 
differences on the democratic reforms, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
One unresolved issue is whether the electoral college should be abolished, as 
the opposition proposes, or transformed into a symbolic institution that would 
reflect the popular vote but still reserve seats for deputies purportedly 
representing mainland China. 
</P>
<P>
The debate focused on what to do with the 1947 constitution, enacted in China 
by the Nationalist government two years before it lost a civil war to the 
Communists and retreated to Taiwan, now home to 20 million people. 
</P>
<P>
The Nationalists have since used the constitution as the legal basis for their 
political power. 
</P>
<P>
Claiming to still be the legitimate government of all China, the Nationalists 
have not allowed native Taiwanese, who make up 85% of the population, to vote 
for a majority of seats in the legislature and electoral college. Instead, the 
party froze in lawmakers elected on the Chinese mainland more than four decades 
ago.

Western-style reformers and ultra-Marxists, both alarmed by the mounting and 
venomous attacks of mid-level Communists on President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
leadership, moved Wednesday to forge an odd-couple alliance at the party 
congress to prevent a takeover by bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparatchiks spit on ideology; all they care about is power," Leningrad 
progressive and congress delegate Yuri Boldyrev said when asked how the 
extremes on the Communist left and right could suddenly contemplate coming 
together. "But we can find a common language with the Marxists, because they 
believe in something." 
</P>
<P>
After a rhetoric-filled day in the Kremlin that saw the fruits of Gorbachev's 
reforms come under withering and occasionally mocking criticism from provincial 
party functionaries, members of the ultra-orthodox Marxist Platform and the 
radical Democratic Platform scheduled a meeting to discuss the possibility of 
joint strategy. 
</P>
<P>
The evening caucus in a Kremlin hall had the apparent blessing of Gorbachev, 
since his ally, Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev, accepted an invitation 
to attend, said Democratic Platform member Klara L. Golitsina, director of a 
cotton mill in Ivanovo. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev and his supporters have frequently expressed their worry over the 
danger of "conservative" delegates dominating the 28th Communist Party Congress 
and forcing a halt or a backtracking in the perestroika reforms. 
</P>
<P>
They have clearly not meant the Marxist Platform delegates but the city- and 
republic-level party and government bureaucrats who make up a majority of the 
congress delegates -- and who often have a vested interest in resisting or 
braking the changes advocated by the leadership. 
</P>
<P>
David N. Kugiltinov, a writer from the Kalmyk region, told the congress on 
Wednesday that the commission created the previous day to review proposed new 
statutes for the party has so many full-time party functionaries on it, as 
opposed to ordinary Communists, that it is a "seminar of secretaries." 
</P>
<P>
Viewed from the balcony, the party congress seems a veritable sea of men in 
their late 40s or 50s wearing blue-gray suits, the uniform of the Soviet 
apparatchik. 
</P>
<P>
Golitsina said the goal of participants at Wednesday's meeting was the creation 
of a "Democratic Unity" group, merging members of the two platforms as well as 
delegates from Komsomol, the Young Communist League, along with grass-roots 
party officials from urban neighborhoods who are often hostile to the 
domineering control exercised by superiors. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic Platform members said the anti-bureaucracy bid had especially strong 
support among lower echelon party workers in Moscow, Leningrad and the 
industrial cities of Sverdlovsk and Kuybyshev. They said that Russian 
Federation President Boris N. Yeltsin, an enemy of the party apparat, had 
promised his support. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of good in the Marxist Platform," said Nikolai Shcherbina, a 
member of the radical faction from Kiev. "The only difference between us is 
that the Marxist Platform wants to return to Marx, and we want to draw our 
ideas from everyone, including the bourgeois philosophers." 
</P>
<P>
Golitsina acknowledged, however, that the unity bid "is a big question mark" 
since little unites the two platforms except their members' common hostility to 
the party powers that be. The Democratic Platform has 100-odd of the nearly 
4,700 congress delegates, and some have already refused to make common cause 
with the Marxists. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the frustration of those on the two wings of the party at the 
course taken by the congress was clear. 
</P>
<P>
"We need real collective leadership that can express all platforms," Muscovite 
Alexander V. Vuzgalin said after he tried to present the details of the 
platform to the congress but was not given the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Polokhalo, who wears the red plastic lapel button of a Democratic 
Platform delegate, said the fusion of members from the two movements "would 
naturally be against the bureaucracy." But it was immediately obvious that 
Polokhalo's colleagues, who renounce even the formal goal of building 
communism, and their Marxist comrades, seeking an ideological rollback to the 
pre-Gorbachev ideas of the 1970s, would make strange political bedfellows. 
</P>
<P>
As members of both groups chatted with a journalist in the lobby of the Kremlin 
Palace of Congresses, their dramatically different points of view were 
glaringly obvious. For Vladimir P. Gvozdyrev, a Marxist Platform delegate and 
neighborhood party chief in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk, Yakovlev is a 
virtual "Judas" who has betrayed Communist Party beliefs and interests. 
</P>
<P>
Some Democratic Platform members, however, express hope that Yakovlev, 
considered the architect of many of Gorbachev's reforms, will become the next 
leader of the Soviet Communist Party.

Former President Jimmy Carter received the city's Liberty Medal in a patriotic 
celebration Wednesday, reminding Americans that human rights are key elements 
in the fabric of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Carter was warmly welcomed by a crowd of 10,000 as he was awarded the bronze 
medal in front of Independence Hall, where the Declaration of Independence was 
signed exactly 214 years ago. The award also comes with a $100,000 prize. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Carter said he opposed a constitutional amendment against 
flag burning. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that anybody should burn the flag," said Carter, an ex-Navy man. 
"But we should not amend the Constitution to guarantee its protection." 
</P>
<P>
Carter was honored for his work to promote liberty and human rights since 
leaving office in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Polish Solidarity leader Lech Walesa was the first person given the 
honor. 
</P>
<P>
Also in Philadelphia, "America's Birthday Cake," big enough to serve 25,000 
people, was cut. Elsewhere, Americans turned out by the millions Wednesday to 
celebrate the birth of their nation. 
</P>
<P>
American flags, always in abundance on Independence Day, were an especially hot 
item this year. Flag merchants in New York and a small-town Louisiana mayor 
said the flag-burning issue had made showing the flag more popular. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a banner year, and that's not just a flag company joke," said Steve 
Sevits, vice president of sales for the Uneeda Flag company near Albany, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Spectators braved the baking sidewalks of Chicago's Michigan Avenue to watch a 
four-hour Shriners parade. 
</P>
<P>
It was hot, hot, hot almost everywhere. Baltimore sizzled at 100 degrees, and 
New York burned, where at 92 degrees it was the hottest day of the year as 
800,000 people headed for the beach at Coney Island. It was 105 degrees in 
Enid, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
High-temperature records for the date were snapped in Erie, Pa., where it was 
97 degrees, Syracuse, N.Y. (95) and Alpena, Mich. (93), and tied in five other 
cities in the East and Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't all fun, fireworks and parades. The Veterans of Foreign Wars, the 
Paralyzed Veterans of America and AMVETS organized a midday rally in a park in 
St. Petersburg, Fla., to push for better health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
At least 2,000 veterans, many in uniforms bedecked with campaign ribbons and 
carrying flags or wearing flag-lapel pins, attended. 
</P>
<P>
At the Spirit of America Festival in Decatur, Ala., former hostage Frank H. 
Reed, who was released in April after 44 months of captivity in Lebanon, 
received the annual Audie Murphy Patriotism Award. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, D.C., spectators on the Mall between the White House and the 
Capitol were entertained by musical performances. A free concert at the Capitol 
was planned for the evening by the National Symphony Orchestra, followed by a 
fireworks display at the Washington Monument. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, Luther Place Church, a few blocks from the White House, staged a Fourth 
of July cookout for the homeless who live in a complex of group homes and 
shelters in the area.

NEWPORT BEACH AREA CLOSED OFF BY HEAVY TRAFFIC

NEWPORT BEACH

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police were forced to close 30 square blocks of the beach area here Wednesday 
when Fourth of July traffic backed up for miles and celebrants spilled into the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
The crowds and traffic became too much to handle and officers gave up on trying 
to keep an official count. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a zillion," Newport Beach police spokesman Tim Newman said. They were 
part of the hundreds of thousands who flocked to Orange County beaches under 
sparkling skies, snarling traffic along the coastline but producing no serious 
disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous arrests were made in Newport Beach for minor offenses ranging from 
fireworks violations to fighting. The 30 blocks were closed at midafternoon and 
were not scheduled to be reopened until 3 a.m today. 
</P>
<P>
"It's jampacked," said Don Chandler, watch commander for the Newport Beach 
Police Department. "It's wall to wall people." 
</P>
<P>
By early afternoon, traffic into Newport Beach was snarled all the way back 
into Costa Mesa. And hours earlier, by 8 a.m., every parking place in town was 
full, and jostling for the ones that opened during the day got rough on 
occasion. 
</P>
<P>
One woman, officers said, was brushed by a car driven by an irate driver as she 
stood in a parking place and tried to save it for someone else. Police 
responded to the call but no one was arrested.

RAY BERWICK; TRAINER OF FILM ANIMALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ray Berwick, Hollywood animal trainer who put 25,000 animals through their 
paces for films like "The Birds" and "Birdman of Alcatraz," has died. He was 
75. 
</P>
<P>
Berwick died Monday night at the Westlake Medical Center of a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
First an animal trainer for circuses and vaudeville, Berwick broke into movies 
in 1962 training birds for "Birdman of Alcatraz," starring Burt Lancaster as a 
convict who became a world authority on birds. 
</P>
<P>
In 1963, he trained 300 birds for Alfred Hitchcock's thriller "The Birds" about 
a California coastal town repeatedly attacked by birds. 
</P>
<P>
Berwick was a pioneer in using positive reinforcement -- food and petting -- to 
get animals to perform. He produced Universal Studios' first live animal show 
and created shows for the San Diego Wild Animal Park. 
</P>
<P>
"In my work I've trained more than 25,000 animals and I've only lost one in an 
accident," Berwick once told The Times. "One of the birds for 'The Birds' was 
crushed by a wagon." 
</P>
<P>
Berwick said some of his trained birds or animals were set free after their 
performance, others were sold, and a few were kept as his special pets. 
</P>
<P>
Berwick is survived by his wife, Suzanne, a son, Brad David, and a daughter, 
Tammy.

Police and army troops fanned out across Mexico's northern Chihuahua state in 
search of a dozen inmates who broke out of the state prison after a riot in 
which four people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Torres, a spokesman for the state government, described the escapees as 
"drug traffickers and murderers, including one who killed 11 people." In all, 
34 prisoners fled but 22 were recaptured. Torres said a convicted drug 
trafficker organized the escape but was killed along with another inmate.

A pamphlet distributed among Jewish settlers urges them to shoot Palestinians 
and gives detailed instructions on how to obtain guns and avoid capture, 
according to Israeli media reports. The anonymous pamphlet advises settlers to 
gather explosives from the army, masquerade as soldiers during attacks and 
leave behind misleading evidence. It says the settlers in the occupied West 
Bank and Gaza Strip should respond to stoning attacks on their cars with 
gunfire and should try to "hit and cause much damage."

A Japanese court awarded damages in a sexual discrimination case for the first 
time, giving $640,000 to 10 female workers. 
</P>
<P>
The women had sued the social insurance remuneration payment fund 10 years ago 
over its policy of promoting only males on the basis of length of service. The 
judge ruled that the government-affiliated agency had violated the constitution 
and the labor standards act. The agency said it may appeal.

President Hashemi Rafsanjani toured quake-ravaged northwest Iran and said that 
the death toll from the June 21 temblor was less than 34,000, lower than first 
feared. "The figures were somewhat exaggerated in the villages," Iran's leader 
told Tehran Radio. His estimate contradicted one earlier in the day by Foreign 
Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, who told the U.N. Economic and Social Council in 
Geneva that 50,000 people were thought to have died.

REFUGEES' ART REFLECTS OLD AND NEW VIETNAM

BURBANK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Black ink slashes white silk, and a lost world emerges. 
</P>
<P>
A water buffalo dips one curved horn into a rice paddy. An ancient woman 
clutches a bowl. A mother comforts her child, touching her cheek to his smaller 
one in a gesture of infinite tenderness. 
</P>
<P>
These spare brush strokes made Be Ky a celebrity in the Saigon art world at the 
age of 18. A year ago, at the age of 51, she and her husband, Ho Thanh Duc, a 
renowned collagist, left Vietnam, settling recently in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
The couple has joined a tiny but productive community of Vietnamese artists in 
exile. Many live or paint in Orange County, but their unlikely focal point is a 
gallery in Burbank. It is owned by a young etcher, Nguyen Viet, who has been 
trying to introduce paintings and sculpture by Vietnamese refugees to the 
American market. 
</P>
<P>
Their works range from traditional brush-and-ink drawings to primitivist 
sketches, modern acrylics and post-modern etching. Some are fierce, like Ho 
Thanh Duc's marbled collages of an anguished Christ. Others are sentimental. 
Yet the artists express common themes: melancholy, nostalgia and transcendence. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want (Westerners) to think of Vietnam as just a war-torn country," 
said Nguyen Thi Hop, 46, who layers watercolor onto silk to produce ethereal 
scenes of rural life a century ago. "I want to show them that the other side of 
Vietnam is beautiful and poetic." 
</P>
<P>
If the art is serene, the artists' lives have not been. 
</P>
<P>
Be Ky and her husband were both war orphans. At the age of 12, she went to live 
with an abusive artist who recognized her talent and exploited it. 
</P>
<P>
"I came to his family because I wanted to learn," Be Ky said through an 
interpreter at the Burbank gallery, where her recent paintings are hung. "He 
taught me very little, and I learned a lot from other people. . . . I had to 
hide my paintings from him." 
</P>
<P>
By 16, her adoptive father had her hawking her ink caricatures on the streets 
of Saigon. "If I earned a lot of money, I brought it home and they were very 
happy. But if the money was little, they would beat me up," she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
A French art critic came across her sketches and arranged for the 18-year-old 
girl to have a one-woman show at the Alliance Francaise in Saigon in 1957. It 
sold out. But as her fame brought exhibitions in Paris and Tokyo, relations 
with her adoptive father deteriorated. One day, she said, she discovered that 
he had been forging her name on his paintings to bring a higher price for them 
on the street. 
</P>
<P>
When she confronted him, he struck her across the head, leaving her deaf in one 
ear. Nearly 30 years later, it was that disability that finally convinced 
Vietnamese authorities to allow the couple to leave their homeland for Manila 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Ho Thanh Duc's father died fighting the Japanese, and his mother abandoned the 
infant to remarry. Duc became a domestic servant. 
</P>
<P>
An aunt rescued him from the street when he was 11, and by his early 20s he was 
an art student who had decided to concentrate on collage. 
</P>
<P>
He sold his first collage to an American Army captain for 7,000 dong -- a 
princely sum then equal to a month's pay for a high government official. Better 
yet, "when (the captain) went back to Philadelphia, he sent me oils," Duc said. 
</P>
<P>
The faces of Christ and Buddha and the drab colors of war figure prominently in 
Duc's art. One series of collages that brought him early fame was made of torn 
fragments of robes given him by Buddhist monks. One robe was said to have 
belonged to a monk who immolated himself. 
</P>
<P>
The celebrated couple declined offers to leave South Vietnam before the 1975 
communist takeover. By 1977, however, they had changed their minds. "We had no 
freedom to chose our subjects, and we could not produce art under the 
censorship of the government," Duc said. 
</P>
<P>
A botched attempt to flee by boat brought him a two-year prison sentence. By 
1981, he had obtained a visa for the United States, but he waited eight more 
years for permission to leave. In 1989, the couple revived their careers with 
two joint exhibitions in the Philippines, where Be Ky presented President 
Corazon Aquino with a Madonna sketch. 
</P>
<P>
Now they have converted their suburban patio to a joint studio. At 50, Duc is 
learning to drive. Be Ky is adjusting to a hearing aid. Her husband jokes that 
he has sewn half his mouth shut to lower his usual volume. He can even whisper 
in her ear. For the first time in their married life, he noted with glee, they 
can keep secrets from their four children. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen Khai tried to paint peace. Born in Hue, Vietnam, he studied at the 
National School of Fine Arts in Saigon in the early '60s. On Vietnamese 
lacquer, he painted abstract tableaux of doves, mandolins and women with fluid 
limbs and hair. He helped found an association of young artists, grew famous 
and managed to dodge the draft. 
</P>
<P>
In 1975, a North Vietnamese official came to visit his studio and explained 
that abstract painting would not be appreciated under the new regime. Khai 
attended re-education lectures, where it was suggested that he abandon 
bourgeois romanticism and tackle subjects from everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted me to draw realistic life in Vietnam, but once I did it, they 
didn't like it, because it was too realistic," said Khai, 50, who fled for 
Indonesia by boat in 1981 and eventually settled in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
Since coming to the West, he said, his colors have gotten brighter. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel more happy, and I feel relieved," he said. "So most of my paintings 
have more movement. And movement expresses freedom. 
</P>
<P>
"In all my paintings, I don't want to express my sorrow for my country and the 
war," Khai added. "I want to express the beauty of my country. . . . I have 
suffered a lot, but I don't want other people to see what I suffered. I just 
want to bring happiness." 
</P>
<P>
Khai is virtually unknown outside Vietnam, and commercial success has eluded 
him. Refugee status has compounded the panoply of problems all artists face. 
His work, though, has been shown at UC Irvine, UCLA and several small Orange 
County galleries, and a new show will open Aug. 3 at the Studio Gallery and 
Framing Inc. in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
"It is so hard for these people, a lot of them say they want to give up," said 
gallery owner Nguyen Viet, who had a show last December for four Vietnamese 
artists, all boat people. "I keep telling them not to give up." 
</P>
<P>
In Nguyen Thi Hop's family, "art was something with too much freedom for 
women." When she was accepted into the National Academy of Art in Saigon, she 
had to promise her father she would become an art teacher before he would allow 
her to go. 
</P>
<P>
Hop married an artist and philosophy teacher, Nguyen Dong. They were interested 
in art, not politics, but after 1975, Dong was not permitted to teach, and they 
were set to drawing labor posters. Their daughter was told to report back on 
her parents' activities. In 1979, they left by boat, and though they were 
robbed by Thai pirates, they survived the trip to Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
In the Pulau Bidong refugee camp, a friend finally gave them a roll of 
blueprint paper and a box of wax crayons. They had both been influenced by 
Henri Rousseau; now they used a naif style as a match for their crude materials 
and their primitive surroundings. With their daughter, they drew 30 sketches of 
life in the refugee camp. 
</P>
<P>
The colorful simplicity of these drawings does not disguise the hardships. 
There is a vista of a denuded hillside where Dong cut and carried logs to build 
his family a crude cabin covered with rice bags. Hop drew the scene near the 
central well, where crowds of women came for water to carry back to their 
shacks. 
</P>
<P>
A Canadian saw their work. "He asked us if we would sell these drawings in 
Canada, to raise money to help people in the camps," said Dong, now 49. "But 
even though we had no money, nothing, we didn't want to sell. They are 
souvenirs." 
</P>
<P>
They did lend the drawings for a charity exhibition, though, and hope to 
exhibit them in the United States. After a stint in West Germany, they rejoined 
family members in Gardena and are working as graphic artists for Nguoi Viet 
Daily News, a Vietnamese-language newspaper based in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
In a corner of the newspaper's paste-up room, Hop and Dong use their spare 
moments to produce illustrations for cookbooks, novels and children's books, 
the gay colors and rounded figures giving their work an unfettered charm. Their 
fine art is done at home at night. 
</P>
<P>
Hop, 46, draws placid scenes of robust country women washing or eating fruit, 
of children playing in a dreamland of temples and screened verandas. Light 
radiates from their skin as from Venetian saints. Dong paints idyllic scenes of 
water buffalo, banana trees and fish ponds. 
</P>
<P>
They paint a Vietnam that existed maybe a century ago, or perhaps never existed 
at all -- a world too gentle for war, a land unscathed by napalm or defoliant. 
</P>
<P>
"We get the beautiful image of what our country was like before the war from 
our parents or our grandparents," Dong said. "Not from our own experience."

<P>
Police arrested five people Wednesday after a violent crime spree that caused 
$1,000 in damage, frightened residents and left a gravely wounded dog in its 
wake. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the suspects did not appear to target anyone in particular but 
simply marauded aimlessly up and down the 7500 block of 9th Street in Buena 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys were just out on what we call gang-bang activities," said Sgt. 
Terry Branum of the Buena Park Police Department. "This was a late-night crime 
spree, and they were doing it right in their own neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
In the four or five hours between 2 a.m. and daylight Wednesday, police said, 
the group committed two robberies, stole two cars, smashed windows at an auto 
parts store, spray-painted a block of buildings and residences and shot a 
yellow Labrador retriever three times. 
</P>
<P>
No people were hurt, but the dog does not appear likely to live, Branum said. 
</P>
<P>
"They hit him three times, so it doesn't look too good. . . . The dog got the 
worst of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police responded to the dog shooting about 3:30 a.m., but not until after 
daylight did they realize that it was related to a slew of other offenses. 
</P>
<P>
Gang graffiti dotted neighborhood residences and businesses along 9th Street 
Wednesday morning. Although neighbors had heard the commotion caused by the 
group's activities, few realized the extent of the spree until they awoke and 
saw the graffiti, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Branum said the graffiti led police to the suspects because they used their 
gang nicknames in the spray-painting, which made it possible for police to 
identify them quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"They had used their street names, and using those and our contacts, we were 
able to track them down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
By 3:30 p.m. Wednesday, five individuals were in custody and being interviewed 
by police. 
</P>
<P>
Branum said the suspects will likely face bail of $90,000 each. He added that 
police believe they know the identity of a sixth suspect, who was being sought 
Wednesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the five suspects in custody are minors, and their names are being 
withheld. The other two were identified as Donald West, 20, and David Morgan, 
19, both residents of Buena Park. West is employed as a meat cutter in Cypress, 
and Morgan is a self-employed painter, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Branum said all five are being held on suspicion of two counts of robbery, one 
count of burglary, two counts of auto theft and one count of felony malicious 
mischief. 
</P>
<P>
Although West and Morgan were the oldest suspects under arrest, Branum said, 
there is no evidence to suggest that they led the rampage. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as we can tell, there were no leaders in this," Branum said. "This was 
a group activity. They were all in it together."

AMBURGEY A CONVERT ON CONFLICT POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Facing increased criticism and hoping to smooth his campaign for reelection in 
November, City Councilman Orville Amburgey surprised his colleagues and voted 
in favor of a stricter conflict-of-interest policy this week. 
</P>
<P>
Amburgey repeatedly opposed the measure as it was being drafted, saying it 
would deprive residents of full representation on the council. He came under 
fire in March by refusing to abstain from a vote granting his son, Ron, a 
rezoning of property which Ron Amburgey hoped to develop. 
</P>
<P>
Amburgey claimed that because his son was no longer a dependent, the senior 
Amburgey didn't stand to gain financially and therefore had not violated city 
code with his vote. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the council Monday, Amburgey said his family discussed the 
policy and decided that the "election-year political football" was not worth 
the fight despite his belief that the policy is too broad and not enforceable. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Ron Amburgey has chosen to no longer develop in Costa Mesa, his 
father said. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel it's important to avoid any further potential for smearing our family 
name," Amburgey told the council members. 
</P>
<P>
The new policy, which will be formally adopted at the council's next meeting 
July 16, redefines the "financial interest" of a public official to include 
indirect investments or interests owned by an official's immediate family, 
including independent children, or a business interest in which any of them 
owns at least a 10% interest. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Thomas Kathe researched court challenges to conflict-of-interest 
rules and determined that the council members could pass an ordinance simply to 
ensure the public's confidence in them. 
</P>
<P>
The courts seem to hold the public's right to a fair and honest government 
above the rights of an individual to receive equal treatment from his elected 
officials, Kathe told the council. 
</P>
<P>
"The key finding is that such family relationships create an appearance of bias 
of a conflict of interest," Kathe told the council. 
</P>
<P>
The council decision cuts short an effort by Costa Mesa resident Roger 
Blanchard to have a similar policy placed on the November ballot. Blanchard's 
house is on Sea Bluff Drive, near the younger Amburgey's project. 
</P>
<P>
However, Blanchard said his initiative wasn't directed only at Orville 
Amburgey, and would have cleared up a lot of questions that have come before 
the council and will inevitably continue. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Mary Hornbuckle tried to take attention away from Amburgey's claim 
that the move was a "political gimmick for ambitious politicians." Although the 
policy was drafted because of Amburgey's vote, she said, the stricter policy is 
better for the city at large. MARY ANNE PEREZ

LAW FIRM SUES OVER BABIES IN WORKPLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A women's law firm filed suit in Orange County Superior Court this week against 
its landlord in a dispute over whether women may bring their infants to work. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed by the Women's Law Center of Orange, asks the court to 
determine whether employees who bring their infants to the rented legal offices 
each day violate a lease agreement with the landlord, Tishman West Management 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
In May, attorney Diane J. Marlowe set up a portable crib in her office and 
began bringing her newborn daughter to work with her. Last month, Marlowe's 
paralegal also gave birth and soon was bringing her son to the office each day. 
</P>
<P>
In May, Tishman West warned Marlowe that using her office as a "nursery" 
violated her lease, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Mull, building manager for Tishman West, told Marlowe that other tenants 
have complained that a baby's presence in the office compromises the 
professional atmosphere of the "executive suites," the top two floors of a 
10-story glass office building near The City shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
Marlowe, founder of the firm, contends that her office is still used for the 
practice of law and has not become a nursery. 
</P>
<P>
Though Marlowe said she has received no complaints from fellow tenants about 
noise, the Women's Law Center recently shuffled its offices to place the two 
infants in a corner room. The reorganization ensures that the babies' cries 
will be buffered by the suite of offices Marlowe shares with her husband, 
attorney Richard Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
Tishman West would not comment further on the case while it is being considered 
by the legal department, Mull said. 
</P>
<P>
Marlowe has said that child care is an "unacceptable" option and that she has 
no choice but to care for her child at work. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's very important that there is a change in the views people have 
about raising children and what goes on in the workplace," Marlowe said. "Just 
as men have changed their attitudes toward women, people will have to change 
attitudes about the way we care for our children. Just because a woman works 
doesn't mean she should have to give up her child." 
</P>
<P>
Tishman West is required to respond to the court summons within 30 days. MARY

COUNCIL SAYS CENTER CAN'T HOUSE CHURCH

<P>
It seemed a perfect match: a commercial center with few tenants paired with a 
church with no home. 
</P>
<P>
But when the Tustin Redevelopment Agency committed $250,000 to improvements for 
the Pacific CommerCenter on Red Hill Avenue in 1986, the money came with an 
agreement that specified acceptable uses. Housing churches was not one of them. 
</P>
<P>
By a 3-2 vote, the City Council rejected the owner's request to modify the 
agreement to allow the church to make the center its temporary home. 
</P>
<P>
"I am sympathetic to the church and the concept of the church being in the 
city, but when we have a legal opinion given to us and when we have spent 
hundreds of thousands on the development, I cannot support this modification," 
Mayor Richard B. Edgar said. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. James G. Rourke said in a written opinion that giving the developer 
money and then not requiring him to conform to the agreement's obligations 
would "smack of a gift of public funds." 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, the redevelopment plan does not provide for churches in the project 
area, and the basic purpose and intent of a redevelopment project is to 
generate tax increment revenue, which a church does not produce," Rourke wrote, 
stating that substantial legal findings would be required under state law to 
modify the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Jim Potts and Earl J. Prescott disagreed with the majority opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"Under the (redevelopment agreement), an atomic-bomb manufacturer could be 
there, but not a church," Prescott said. "It's a matter of this council's 
desire." 
</P>
<P>
James Biram of the center's property manager, Newport Beach-based Resco, said 
he was frustrated by the council's decision. Since the agreement was 
negotiated, the business climate has changed, he said. While lease rates were 
projected at $1.05 per square foot, the 62,000-square-foot center is now 
leasing for 79 cents a square foot, he said. Even at that price, the vacancy 
rate is about 45%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Wolf, pastor of Harvest Fellowship International, was also disappointed. 
Unable to find a home in the city, his church now meets at Saddleback Inn in 
Santa Ana. SHANNON SANDS

IT'S SURPRISE, SURPRISE FOR PARENTS OF TWIN BOYS; 
</P>
<P>
BIRTHS: RITA AND BILL WILLIAMSON EXPECTED BIG BABIES, BUT ONE WEIGHED MORE THAN 
11 POUNDS, THE OTHER MORE THAN 9 POUNDS.

<P>
Big babies run in the Williamson family. But nobody was prepared for twin boys 
-- one 11 pounds, 8 ounces, the other, 9 pounds, 10 ounces -- least of all mom 
Rita Williamson. 
</P>
<P>
"I was all baby," said Rita Williamson, 27, who was resting Wednesday at the 
Los Alamitos Hospital birthing center. "I'm kind of tired now, so I'm glad it's 
over." 
</P>
<P>
Craig Allen and Thomas Arthur were born Monday by Cesarean section. Craig, the 
biggest, was first at 8:21 a.m. A minute later, little brother Thomas followed. 
Both measured more than 21 inches. 
</P>
<P>
"They're the largest twins the hospital has ever had," nursing supervisor 
Josephine Vantrees said. "They were pretty enormous." 
</P>
<P>
Twins usually average about six pounds. But the Williamson twins are bigger 
than most single-birth babies, which average around seven pounds. A single 
birth baby weighing more than nine pounds is considered large, Vantrees said. 
</P>
<P>
The twins and mom will join their sister, Tanya, 2, and dad, Bill, at home in 
Cerritos once Williamson recovers, which is expected to be within a few days. 
</P>
<P>
Rita Williamson said she tried to stay cool during the past two months, despite 
having to carry around 56 extra pounds. "I'm a pretty big woman to start with," 
she said, "but the babies added more around the tummy." 
</P>
<P>
She said the hardest part of her pregnancy came during the wave of triple-digit 
temperatures last month. She coped by wearing loose clothing, staying in 
air-conditioned rooms and doing as little as possible. Even just walking seemed 
like strenuous exercise. 
</P>
<P>
The couple discovered that two very big boys were on the way Friday, when Rita 
had an ultrasound test. 
</P>
<P>
"We expected them to be little guys 'cause, you know, they're twins," said Bill 
Williamson, a computer programmer. "But I guess we were more than lucky." 
</P>
<P>
By delivery time, the Williamsons were "geared for big babies." Rita had had 
some experience with an unusual birth -- Tanya had been 9 pounds, 12 ounces and 
in the breech position. 
</P>
<P>
"The two of them have already beaten me in a way," says Bill, who was 8 pounds, 
7 ounces at birth. "They got me by a couple of ounces. 
</P>
<P>
Bill already foresees a great future in football for his sons. Craig, the 
bigger one, is going to be a linebacker, and Thomas, no small potato himself, 
is going to be a lineman, he predicts. 
</P>
<P>
"We're waiting for USC to call," Williamson quipped. "I bet they can take 
crawlers for the next season."

HOSPITAL OPERATOR INVESTIGATING PATIENT'S DEATH

<P>
FHP Inc., the health care organization that operates FHP Fountain Valley 
Hospital, has launched an internal investigation of the events leading up to 
the mysterious death of a patient last November, company officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley police revealed Tuesday they are investigating FHP and a nurse 
who formerly worked for the company about about their role in the death of 
Francis J. Johnson, 74, who was admitted to the hospital for respiratory 
problems on Nov. 13, 1989, and died the following day. 
</P>
<P>
The death certificate, written by an FHP staff doctor, listed the cause of 
death as "mestastic breast cancer," but police now believe that the woman 
actually died because an FHP nurse administered the wrong medication to her. 
</P>
<P>
A Fountain Valley police spokeswoman confirmed Wednesday that the nurse, 
Maureen Daubert, lost her license shortly after the incident but he did not 
know if it was related to the death of Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Police are also investigating the preparation of the death certificate, but no 
physicians have been targeted in the inquiry, according to Steve Williams, a 
Fountain Valley police investigator. 
</P>
<P>
"This has all caught us somewhat off guard," Anna Marie Dunlap, a company vice 
president, said Wednesday. "We've assigned a couple of people to investigate 
it, and we plan to have a statement tomorrow or Friday." 
</P>
<P>
Daubert no longer works for FHP, but company officials will not say whether 
Daubert was fired or whether she left on her own.

CANDIDATES GO FOURTH AT GOP PICNIC;

POLITICS: FLAG AND FUNDS ARE RAISED IN COSTA MESA. PETE WILSON LEADS SALUTE TO 
REPUBLICAN PATRIOTISM.

<TEXT>
<P>
Although it lacked traditional staples such as watermelon and red-checkered 
tablecloths, there was no shortage of flag-waving patriotism at a 
Republican-sponsored picnic that drew candidates hoping to win office in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed the "Grand Old Picnic," the five-hour fund-raiser held at the Orange 
County Fairgrounds showcased a short visit by Republican gubernatorial 
candidate Sen. Pete Wilson and his wife, Gayle. 
</P>
<P>
Also appearing were state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), party nominee 
for lieutenant governor; attorney general candidate Dan Lungren; Huntington 
Beach councilman and state insurance commissioner candidate Wes Bannister, and 
Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), who is seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
The fund-raiser, benefiting the Orange County Republican Party, was designed to 
combine family fun with such serious political motives as getting out the vote 
and rallying campaign volunteers, said picnic chairman Dan McNerney, assistant 
treasurer of the Orange County Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
Because the picnic's debut last October was poorly attended, McNerney suggested 
shifting it to Independence Day this year to capitalize on the patriotic mood. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to capture that patriotic spirit everybody seems to feel on the 
Fourth of July . . . where it is a national, emotional thing and everyone gets 
a little introspective about our country," McNerney said. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers called the move a success, noting that the event drew more than 
1,000 people throughout the day -- twice as many as last year -- at 
$2-per-person or $5-per-family admission prices. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to brief speeches by Wilson and other politicians, the picnic 
featured children's choirs performing patriotic songs, hot dog and lemonade 
booths manned by local Republican clubs, carnival games, a classic car display 
and face-painters dressed as Miss Liberty and George Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Even Wilson embraced the patriotic glow as he presented an American flag to 
County Republican Party Chairman Tom Fuentes. 
</P>
<P>
As he unfolded the flag, Wilson beckoned the dozen local politicians on the 
November ballot to gather in a semicircle around him on the outdoor stage. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a symbol of freedom around the world," Wilson said. "I dare anybody to 
take this flag away from my (Republican) team or from Tom Fuentes and burn it. 
They will be sorry." 
</P>
<P>
Using a theme of Let Freedom Ring, event organizers also said they wanted to 
share the holiday with those who have struggled for freedom around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Speakers included Andres Zuniga, head of a Nicaraguan political party involved 
in the anti-Sandinista campaign, and Rahmatullah Safi, a leader of the 
anti-communist National Islamic Front of Afghanistan. Also present were 
families from Poland and the Soviet republics of Lithuania and Latvia. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a day of thanksgiving . . . that we have the leadership and freedom so 
many of us are striving to keep for ourselves and our children," Bergeson said. 
"Republican values are not for more taxes . . . but for the values we hold true 
in our families." 
</P>
<P>
McNerney said the picnic reflected family-oriented ideals stressed by the 
party. 
</P>
<P>
"Black-tie dinners are great for (people like) the Brens, the Karchers and the 
Segerstroms, who drop $1,000 here and $1,000 there," he said, referring to a 
few prominent, wealthy families who support the local GOP. "But today, there 
are even more people having fun eating hot dogs and riding ponies."

LUCK FREES FIREFIGHTERS FROM JULY 4TH FEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite fears that the combination of fireworks and extraordinarily dry 
hillsides could lead to a volatile July 4th, Orange County firefighters 
encountered only a few small fires Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, so good," County Fire Department Capt. Hank Raymond said Wednesday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"We put on some extra units to patrol and keep an eye on things, but so far we 
haven't had any real problems." 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters across the county had been bracing for what many feared would be a 
dangerous Independence Day. The region's hills have been parched by the 
drought, and the holiday had officials on alert for firecrackers and careless 
revelers that might start fires. 
</P>
<P>
To prepare for that possibility, extra county fire units, with the aid of 
police departments, patrolled areas where fireworks are illegal, citing 
offenders and confiscating any contraband. By late Wednesday afternoon, police 
and fire department spokesmen were reporting few such citations. Newport Beach 
police said they issued several tickets and confiscated some fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
One of the fires occurred Wednesday morning in Stanton, when a man working on 
his truck accidentally ignited a fire with his welding torch. County 
firefighters responded to the call. Raymond said that it looked for a while as 
if the fire would turn into something serious because the truck's gas tank 
ruptured and leaked fuel. It was contained, however, before any major damage 
could be done. 
</P>
<P>
The dry brush in a creek bed near the intersection of State College and Yorba 
Linda boulevards in Fullerton also burned Wednesday morning, igniting a 
eucalyptus tree and burning a small area but causing no damage to homes or

GUIDELINES FOR REGISTERING HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Cicero was right in his observation that history illumines reality, county 
residents have a way to shed their own ideas of light, and the boundaries are 
far from constricting. 
</P>
<P>
Among the more unusual landmarks included in the Orange County Historical 
Commission's registry of 38 historical locations, for example, are a grove of 
macadamia trees, planted by a spiritual community in Yorba Linda in 1890, and a 
rusted iron cage in San Juan Capistrano, used earlier in the century to confine 
outlaws captured in South County. 
</P>
<P>
More traditional are the Peralta Adobe in Anaheim and Huntington Beach High 
School, included as representations of significant building and architectural 
styles. Each site is marked with a bronze plaque. 
</P>
<P>
If you know of something you think worthy of note, the commission is willing to 
hear your case. It accepts recommendations from citizens or organizations 
willing to sponsor a potential addition to its registry. If the site is 
accepted, the sponsor must provide renovation funding and arrange a dedication 
ceremony. Obtain an application by calling (714) 834-5560. Or write to the 
commission at P.O. Box 4048, Santa Ana, 92702. 
</P>
<P>
There are, however, a few basic selection guidelines: 
</P>
<P>
* Subject may be a structure, natural formation or significant plant, such as a 
landmark tree or grove. 
</P>
<P>
* It should relate to significant events in the county's political, cultural, 
economic or social development -- for example, the railroad era, bygone 
business or military activities or early agricultural trends. 
</P>
<P>
* It can be a site once lived in or utilized by a historical personality. 
</P>
<P>
* Structures that represent indigenous or significant architectural styles are 
acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
* Buildings representative of notable architects or builders are also 
considered.

YMCA PROGRAM GIVES YOUNG PEOPLE ACHANCE TO SAY NO TO TROUBLE

Young people from troubled communities in Anaheim will have more to do this 
summer than hang out and be bored, thanks to an array of free activities 
available through the city and the YMCA. 
</P>
<P>
Teen-agers can swim in the organization's pool and use the gymnasium for 
basketball and dodge-ball games. 
</P>
<P>
They can use weight training equipment and racquetball courts and join a boxing 
program. These are a few of the activities offered at the YMCA through 
Anaheim's Save-A-Youth (SAY) Program. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, about 75 group members will spend a week this month at the YMCA's 
summer camp in the mountains, where they can hike, swim, learn about nature and 
create arts and crafts. 
</P>
<P>
Young people from four troubled neighborhoods are targeted as recruits for SAY 
in an effort to offer them an alternative to joining gangs or using drugs . 
</P>
<P>
YMCA workers said that the youths get the same treatment as the facility's 
regulars. 
</P>
<P>
" We're trying not to label the kids 'youth at risk,' " said Chris Ofelt, 
physical activities director at the YMCA. When SAY teen-agers come to the YMCA, 
he changes the youth group's title to the City of Anaheim Youth Program. 
</P>
<P>
Another program is designed for youngsters who want to be out later in the 
evenings but don't want to be on the streets. The "Back Door at the Y" program 
allows youths to drop in between 6 and 9:30 p.m. to socialize, play games or 
just relax, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Moore, who coordinates SAY for the city, estimates that about 40 
teen-agers participate. Another 200 elementary school pupils are involved in 
SAY programs at school sites.

PIANIST OLIVIA HERMAN, 15, WINS AWARDS FOR PLAYING, COMPOSING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Music -- almost every teen-ager listens to it, those with talent can play it, 
and a rare few can write it. But 15-year-old pianist Olivia Herman can do it 
all -- and more. 
</P>
<P>
Olivia plays and writes music that calls to mind great Russian composers -- 
music so good that within the past few months it has won her a concert debut 
and an impressive number of awards. 
</P>
<P>
In her first venture as a professional musician, Olivia, a junior at University 
High School in Irvine, received a standing ovation for the rendition of 
Schumann's Piano Concerto she performed with the Brea Orchestra in the Brea 
Civic Center. "It was the first time I had ever played with an orchestra," she 
said, "and I was really thrilled." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly such musical success is unusual for a girl not yet old enough to 
drive. "She is only 15, yet she has such very nice sound," said her piano 
instructor, Lina Baranov. "She is very mature and very, very talented. She 
learns music very fast and has such nice technique. But if I say technique, it 
is not right. She has her own interpretation. She understands the music. " 
</P>
<P>
This understanding helps to make Olivia a top-rate composer too. She swept 
first place last month in the senior original music composition of the 
Disneyland Creativity Challenge for her six-minute "Suite for Piano and Cello." 
</P>
<P>
She worked on the three-movement suite from November, 1989, to April, 1990, 
scheduling her composing around time for schoolwork and friends. The suite, she 
said, was inspired by the Russian composers Shostakovich, Prokofiev and Bartok. 
"It took a while," she said, "especially because I wrote a lot of stuff that I 
didn't end up using." 
</P>
<P>
During that time, Olivia also devoted energy to another piece, her piano grand 
waltz solo titled "At the Ballet." This waltz won her first place in original 
composition earlier this month in an annual statewide contest held by the Music 
Teachers Assn. of California. 
</P>
<P>
The Library of Congress also recognized "At the Ballet" by naming Olivia one of 
nine national finalists in the Young Creators Contest, a one-time competition 
held this year in honor of the Library's 200th birthday. She competed against 
hundreds of musicians who were composing for all instruments. 
</P>
<P>
Olivia's playing also draws acclaim. She was declared a 1990 California Arts 
Scholar and is one of 16 pianists in the nation accepted for a special program 
at Boston University's Tanglewood Institute. Her first day was Sunday, and 
she'll complete the program July 28. She competed against other high school 
musicians from around the nation by sending in a tape of four pieces, including 
"At the Ballet." Winning a $600 scholarship will help with the $2,100 cost. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really happy and excited," Olivia said. "I'm working up a new repertoire, 
but it's been difficult because of all my finals and tests and everything." 
</P>
<P>
Olivia has had to make a special effort to remain committed to her musical 
studies at an age when most pianists let sports, clubs and homework take up a 
lot of their time. She admits, though, that she is not always able to give 
priority to the concert grand piano that fills her family's living room. 
</P>
<P>
Practice time "depends on how much homework I have, unfortunately. I practice 
an average of two to three hours (a weekday). On the weekends, I try to 
practice three to four hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to practice in the morning. If I can get up early and practice, I'm in 
a good spirit and I'm awake and energetic. But once I come home from school and 
I've had a long day and I have a million tests to study for, then I'm not too 
enthusiastic about it." 
</P>
<P>
Olivia said her parents have never pressured her to continue playing. "Maybe I 
don't want them to tell me to (practice), but I don't feel pressured. They're 
just really supportive." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the time, practice must take precedence over being with friends or just 
relaxing. "I feel bad that I can't always spend more time with my friends," 
Olivia said. "If I can't do something after school, it's because I have to 
practice. I guess that's the toughest thing about being serious about 
something. . . . You don't have all the time in the world to play." 
</P>
<P>
Olivia's musical interest was sparked about eight years ago, when she persuaded 
her parents to let her start lessons on an old electric piano they had. "My dad 
used to play when I was little," she said. "The fact that he could just sit 
down and pick out a piece and read it, I thought that was pretty neat, so I 
wanted to do the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
Her talent blossomed in New York, where she lived until two years ago. Her 
family moved to Irvine right before her freshman year of high school, and 
Olivia had to leave her studies at perhaps the nation's most prestigious music 
program for young people, the Juilliard School's pre-college division. She 
spent every Saturday in music classes, studying theory, solfege (harmonic 
dictation), performing techniques and chorus. 
</P>
<P>
"The theory prepared me for composing, " she explained, "because that's where 
you learn all the techniques and structures and forms of the music." 
</P>
<P>
She did not try her hand at composing until she moved to California and 
enrolled in Yamaha's Junior Original Concert program in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't really intended to become serious about (composing)," Olivia said, 
"but once I got started, I really liked it." 
</P>
<P>
Now, once a week she meets with a composition teacher and attends various 
workshops. She also has a weekly lesson with Baranov, who is not connected with 
the Yamaha program. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't just play your instrument," Olivia said. "You have to, I think, take 
theory lessons and other kinds of music classes, not just performing. I was 
trying to find something extra to add to my music." 
</P>
<P>
Though her move to California and the Yamaha program introduced her to 
composing, she sometimes still longs for the Juilliard School. In Irvine, she 
said, her school schedule does not permit her to take any orchestra classes, 
and sometimes she misses the camaraderie of other musicians. 
</P>
<P>
"When I lived in New York, I had a lot of friends at Juilliard and we shared 
this common interest," Olivia said. "It was like we had a special link. But 
here, no. I really miss it. It was just such a great atmosphere because 
everyone was good and it was encouraging. It was uplifting." 
</P>
<P>
Now, when she wants to be inspired, she often turns to the music of Russian 
composers or the impressionists. "I think it's good to see if you can compose 
in a certain genre," she said. "I do think that, as you become a more mature 
composer, you'll want to establish your own style." For her, she said, that 
point is many years away. 
</P>
<P>
Olivia composes not only to win major contests, but also whenever she feels 
especially inspired. "I just composed a little piece last week. I've been 
listening to Satie a lot, and I just sat down and I was in the mood of this 
liquidy, watery, French style and I just composed something short and simple 
just for fun. It's not a major composition that I would enter in a 
competition." 
</P>
<P>
She has a few general composing rules that she follows. "You have to be relaxed 
and you have to feel excited about composing at that moment. If you sit down 
and you're just kind of bored or tired, that's not a good way to do it. I have 
to be in the mood for it." 
</P>
<P>
Since not every score that flows from her mind to her fingertips is inspired 
genius, she plays and records what she composes, then listens to it later. "A 
lot of times it's hard because you're already so close to the music and so 
involved in it. You can't judge it impartially," she said. "But, maybe, if you 
set yourself apart from it, maybe not listen to it for a few days, then you can 
listen to it." 
</P>
<P>
Olivia's talent may have taken her to new heights, but she feels she still has 
a lot to accomplish as a pianist and composer. A self-described big-band jazz 
fan, she hopes to follow the lead of a few of her favorite musicians -- Duke 
Ellington and Theolonius Monk -- and perfect her improvisation. 
</P>
<P>
She also hopes to work on her chamber music, because in this style the piano is 
not as isolated as it is in an orchestra. "You can get a job in an orchestra 
and you're always playing with other people, but the pianist is alone. I think 
that's why chamber music is really special. That's also why I composed the 
'Suite for Piano and Cello,' because I wanted desperately to play with someone 
else." 
</P>
<P>
Olivia's musical plans after high school include attending a university or a 
major conservatory. She said she would also love to study music in Germany. "So 
many of the great composers were German. . . . If you want to be a musician, 
you really have to visit Germany, Austria and Salzburg." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Olivia hopes to become a concert pianist, but she has a few 
reservations. "It's so competitive, and maybe then you want to have a family. 
It's hard to do that when you're out performing. But I guess that's (being a 
professional musician) every aspiring musician's fantasy." 
</P>
<P>
Said Baranov: "She is only just beginning. Now she has to practice a lot and 
dedicate herself completely to her music. That is how it is for a musician." 
</P>
<P>
Does her piano teacher think she has what it takes to become a professional 
musician? "Absolutely. She is already."

JUNK MAIL DEPOSIT REJECTED BY CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Monica resident Edwin Ek thought he was doing the right thing when he 
tossed some junk mail recently into a corner refuse barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the city has branded him a civil sinner and is threatening to fine him 
if he ever again uses a public trash container for his private use. 
</P>
<P>
In a June 26 letter, Thomas Q. Dever, the city's superintendent of solid waste 
management, informed Ek that trash barrels placed on city streets "are only for 
litter produced by the general public." 
</P>
<P>
"You are to use only the trash containers provided at your address," the letter 
stated, warning that future violations will result in Ek being billed $25 per 
violation. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Dever said he sends two or three such letters a week 
as part of an effort to keep the trash receptacles open for spur-of-the moment 
debris. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're targeting here are abusers," he said, "not the person who is 
cleaning a gum wrapper out of her purse. Depending on whose definition of 
quantity you accept, some cases are marginal." 
</P>
<P>
Ek was caught, not in the act of using a trash can, but after an investigation 
by a city cleanup crew. They spotted his name on envelopes while sifting 
through the trash in a bin at San Vicente Boulevard and 4th Street, according 
to Dever's letter. 
</P>
<P>
They confiscated the evidence and sent a photocopy along to Ek -- thereby 
creating an additional piece of trash, he noted. "This specimen represents just 
one of the numerous (pieces of) discarded mail that you put in the receptacle," 
the letter admonished him. 
</P>
<P>
For the record, the offending specimen was a sweepstakes offer from a stereo 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Ek, 30, a financial consultant, said at first he found the letter from the city 
"just too amusing to be real" and wondered what would happen "if I threw their 
letter in the same bin to see what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Ek readily confesses that he tossed the sweepstakes letter and other junk mail 
in the can on the corner where he catches the bus for work every day. 
</P>
<P>
As he tells it, he had taken along unopened mail from the day before to look at 
while waiting for the bus, and, finding some not worthy of perusal, he threw 
them away. 
</P>
<P>
City officials contend that Ek actually deposited a bag full of trash, not 
merely a few letters. 
</P>
<P>
But it probably doesn't matter; Assistant City Atty. Joseph Lawrence said he 
was unaware of any ordinance that deals with the public's use of city trash 
bins. 
</P>
<P>
In response to inquiries from The Times, Santa Monica Director of General 
Services Stan Scholl said the city was taking "corrective action" on its policy 
concerning public trash cans. 
</P>
<P>
Individual citizens such as Ek will no longer get letters from the city, Scholl 
said. Instead, the city will concentrate enforcement efforts on building owners 
who do not have enough dumpsters, which is what creates the problem, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what we should have done in the first place."

Alarmed at the discovery of human viruses in the Santa Monica Bay, an 
environmental group Wednesday kicked off a campaign to urge the public and 
elected officials to be more aggressive in reducing storm drain pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Heal the Bay drew a crowd of about 100 supporters near the Pico-Kenter storm 
drain where a portion of the Santa Monica Beach was closed after viruses were 
detected in runoff flowing into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the group announced a campaign that will include public 
service announcements warning of the hazards of illegally dumping in storm 
drains, English and Spanish-language signs placed at more than 100,000 catch 
basins telling of a $1,000 penalty for dumping and a "neighborhood watch 
program" in which volunteers would keep an eye on storm drains and alert 
authorities to overflowing or malfunctioning catch basins. 
</P>
<P>
"The ocean is strong and we are strong in our beliefs," Assemblyman Tom Hayden 
(D-Santa Monica) told the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Heal the Bay also called for every city in the county to regulate development 
to reduce the amount of pollutants and the toxicity of urban runoff entering 
Santa Monica Bay. Fifteen of the 86 cities in the county have adopted such 
ordinances, the group claimed. 
</P>
<P>
The organization also wants county health officials to better enforce pollution 
standards at local beaches, being quicker to close them when necessary. In 
addition, the group urged the county to post warning signs at all storm drain 
outlets advising people not to swim within 100 yards of the runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Such signs were placed around the Pico-Kenter storm drain last week after a 
$125,000 study conducted by the Santa Monica Bay Restoration Project showed 
evidence of viruses from human fecal contamination in the drain's runoff. The 
report speculated that the most likely sources of the waste are illegal sewage 
connections, leaking or overflowing sewer lines or the homeless population. 
</P>
<P>
The study involved taking samples on 11 days during a 15-day period last summer 
from the Pico-Kenter drain, which carries street runoff from Brentwood and 
Santa Monica. The viruses can cause illnesses ranging from stomach flu to 
hepatitis. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Gold, a Heal the Bay staff scientist who conducted the study for the Santa 
Monica Bay Restoration Project, said he hopes to do similar surveys at other 
storm drains, including those at Ballona Creek, Malibu Creek and Santa Monica 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to know how prevalent the problem is," Gold said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles county health officials have downplayed the situation, but Santa 
Monica city officials were quick to post large warning signs banning swimming 
within 100 yards of the storm drain. Buoys were also placed offshore to 
designate the area where swimming is banned. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, about 130,000 people had flocked to Santa Monica Beach south of 
the pier, where the temperature was in the mid-70s with a slight ocean breeze, 
according to county Lifeguard Lt. Ira Gruber. 
</P>
<P>
Gruber said beachgoers were cooperative and stayed out of the water cordoned 
off by the buoys. Most also chose not to lie on the sand around the storm 
drain. 
</P>
<P>
Alondra Bryant, visiting from Washington, did lie on the sand near the 
cordoned-off area. When she went into the water, however, she made sure she was 
on the other side of the buoys. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's good that they put out the signs warning us that the water could 
be dangerous," she said. "I probably would have gone into the water right in 
front if it wasn't for the signs."

GLENDALE ON THE ALERT TO DETECT VIOLATORS OF FIREWORKS BAN; 
</P>
<P>
FOURTH OF JULY: OFFICIALS IN THE ARSON-RAVAGED COMMUNITY SPEND THE HOLIDAY 
ROAMING THE STREETS. THEY DON'T WANT A REPEAT OF LAST WEEK'S DEVASTATING 
BLAZES. 
</P>

<P>
For the eleventh year in a row Glendale Fire Capt. John Orr passed up a lazy 
Fourth of July backyard barbecue to drive his blue Chevrolet around the fringes 
of a city park, taking time to snuff out the potential beginnings of a 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"You just drive around the park," he said, rolling to a stop as he peered out 
an open window, "and listen." 
</P>
<P>
One week after arson blazes ripped through Southern California, scorching 
thousands of acres and destroying hundreds of homes, firefighters such as Orr 
spent Wednesday trying to prevent fires before they began -- by tracking down 
those who ignore fireworks bans. 
</P>
<P>
"All the communities in Southern California are a virtual time bomb," said 
Glendale Battalion Chief Joel Markss, adding that three patrols would cruise 
the city Wednesday evening to catch fireworks scofflaws. "We're a little more 
concerned than usual this year. Because of the drought, the brush is much more 
volatile than at any time since they've been keeping records." 
</P>
<P>
Reports of backyard grass fires and people suffering from heat exhaustion 
flowed Wednesday into the Verdugo Communications Center, which fields calls for 
fire departments in Glendale, Pasadena and Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
But only two calls in the last four days reported individuals violating 
fireworks laws. It was a sign, said some local officials, that the devastating 
Glendale blaze of last week may have heightened awareness of fire-season 
dangers. 
</P>
<P>
"Right after the fires, we had people bringing us fireworks," said battalion 
aide Greg Godfrey. "They said 'I was going to use them but now I feel guilty.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Orr, who is investigating the Glendale arson fire, agreed that a first-hand 
look at the kind of damage that fireworks could cause was one of the best 
deterrents for those thinking of illegally setting them off. 
</P>
<P>
"I imagine people are going to police themselves," said Orr, driving through 
the city's streets, all the while keeping alert to the tell-tale pop of 
fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
In Burbank, Fire Prevention Inspector Terry M. Mencuri used a different method 
to get the attention of would-be lawbreakers. 
</P>
<P>
"People aren't aware of fireworks," said Mencuri, who had set up a mock 
fireworks booth bedecked in American flags to attract people to what was a 
sometimes graphic lesson on the danger of fireworks. "They've been around for 
years and people think they're safe. There is no safe form of fireworks." 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate his point, Mencuri had decorated the inside of the booth with 
photographs of fire victims -- from a firefighter who fell into a blaze he was 
battling, to the scarred body of a child who had played with firecrackers. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been on the fire department for 11 years," he said, standing outside the 
booth that by early afternoon had been visited by nearly 100 people, "and I am 
still amazed at the destruction that fire can cause." 
</P>
<P>
Fireworks were blamed for a blaze that damaged the roof of a two-story Hawaiian 
Gardens apartment building before 20 firefighters put it out, county officials 
said. No one was injured or displaced. 
</P>
<P>
"A bottle rocket sent off by neighborhood kids set it off," said Los Angeles 
County Fire Department Capt. Michael Wolf. People in the neighborhood told fire 
officials the youths had launched rockets all day. 
</P>
<P>
In Glendale, residents said they would not hesitate to call authorities if they 
detected fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
"If I heard anything, I'd report it," said Walter Theriot, who moved into his 
hillside home only three months ago. His house barely escaped the blaze last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
But it wouldn't really matter, he added ruefully, standing amid the rubble of 
his neighbors' homes. After all, he said, "what's going to burn now?"

JULY FOURTH OBSERVED WITH FROLIC, THOUGHT; 
</P>
<P>
HOLIDAY: BARBECUES AND THE BEACH DRAW CROWDS. BUT SOME FIND TIME TO PONDER THE 
MEANING OF INDEPENDENCE. 
</P>

<P>
The words of civic responsibility rang out clearly from the loudspeakers at the 
35th annual Independence Day celebration at Palos Verdes Estates. 
</P>
<P>
"There can be no doubt that freedom requires responsibility," a high school 
junior wrote in an award-winning essay that was read at the event. "Freedom 
without responsibility is the definition of the word anarchy." 
</P>
<P>
But only moments before, anarchy seemed to rule the day as eager children tried 
to eat their way to a messy victory in a pie-eating contest as parents watched 
and laughed. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of patriotism and pleasure prevailed throughout Los Angeles 
County on Wednesday as residents poured out of their homes into bright 
sunshine, lining streets for parades and gathering around barbecue grills with 
family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
It was a day for reunions, memories, egg tosses and three-legged races. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, for fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
About 250,000 people decided to get a jump on both their neighbors and the sun 
at the fourth annual pre-dawn fireworks display north of Santa Monica Pier. 
They arrived in droves -- some even spent the night -- congesting streets and 
packing the pier, the beach and cliffs overlooking the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Fireworks exploded and sent waves of color shimmering in the sky to the 
accompaniment of the Los Angeles Pops Orchestra. The crowd oohed and aahed and 
occasionally burst into applause. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great audio-visual experience," said Eric Hammerlund, a 19-year-old 
architecture student at Woodbury University. "It was really good to hear 
everybody applaud with you." 
</P>
<P>
Others went beyond the purely audio-visual and turned the experience into a 
gastronomic one. Moo Lim, 40, with his wife and young son, came armed with a 
camping stove and a cache of coffee, noodles, chicken, beef and shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica event offered a respite from the sweltering heat in Rosemead, 
Lim said. "It's fun. Last year we came with six families in our neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
The turnout for the fireworks display, aptly named "Dawn's Early Light," was 
the largest since the event was moved to early morning from evening three years 
ago in an attempt to reduce both traffic and crime. 
</P>
<P>
But violence marred the festivities when two men were shot in unrelated 
incidents, according to police, who said the wounds were not life threatening. 
Fights also broke out along the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those attending were unaware of the violence and simply enjoyed 
themselves, including a woman from Virginia who braved the possibility of 
giving birth to her sixth child at any moment. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctor told me, 'You can go but stay close to a hospital,' " the woman 
said, patting her stomach. "I like excitement." 
</P>
<P>
For those who thought the rockets' red glare came too early at Santa Monica, 
Venice Beach offered another kind of glistening display at a more civilized 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
Scores of muscular, tanned, oiled bodies, for which the beach is famous, struck 
poses before an admiring crowd. The owners of the bodies were competing in the 
annual Muscle Beach Open sponsored by the Los Angeles Recreation and Parks 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Hoots, whistles and screams filled the sea-salted air as the audience expressed 
its approval for the young men in Speedos who flexed their biceps and the 
bikini-clad women who also flexed and blew kisses to the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
However, one man who dared only to identify himself as "Jim" sounded a note of 
mild dissent. "I like females in good shape, but not muscular," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Heck," he added, gazing at one particularly well-toned female physique, "she's 
bigger than I am. If push came to shove, she'd beat me up." 
</P>
<P>
The holiday was not without its serious side, especially for those with ties to 
homelands not so free. It was also a day for some to express their displeasure 
with the way things are in this country. 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen people in southeast Los Angeles protested police barricades and 
INS detention centers. 
</P>
<P>
The rally at Ross Snyder Park was dubbed "Committee for an Appropriate 
Celebration of July Fourth" and culminated in the burning of an American flag. 
Two people were arrested for battery on an officer and interfering with an 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, members of Lithuanian, Estonian, Polish and Vietnamese groups, among 
others, joined with Chinese residents in a "Let Freedom Ring Rally" outside the 
Chinese Consulate in Los Angeles. A Styrofoam and plastic replica of the 
"Goddess of Democracy," the American-inspired symbol of freedom for the Chinese 
students who protested in Beijing a year ago, stood among the rally's 40 
participants. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing the crowd from a makeshift podium, Texas native Glory 
Rocha-Provencia said, "In Texas we have a saying: 'Remember the Alamo.' Now we 
have another saying: 'Remember Tian An Mien Square.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ting-po Huang, a Chinese immigrant, agreed with Rocha-Provencia, adding, "many 
of us immigrants are more appreciative of what this country is all about: 
liberty and a democratic form of government." 
</P>
<P>
His patriotism found an echo across town from Joseph Shabera, 54, a Marin 
County man who met in Los Angeles with nearly 20 friends from his childhood in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
As he geared up for a game of old-fashioned stickball, which he and the others 
played as children, Shabera said, "Most of us are first-generation (Americans), 
and we don't take the country for granted." For him the stickball game 
represented "tradition, remembrance and an appreciation of the things that this 
country affords us."

PERSPECTIVE ON EUROPE; 
</P>
<P>
AN SOS FOR CONFLICT RESOLUTION; 
</P>
<P>
LONG-SUPPRESSED INTERNAL ANTAGONISMS THREATEN PEACE AND SECURITY IN THE EAST. 
BUT THERE IS A SOLUTION AT HAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT E. HUNTER, Robert E. Hunter is vice president for regional programs 
and director of European studies at the Center for Strategic and International 
Studies in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Debate about the future of Germany and the Soviet Union has obscured the 
principal threat to peace on the Continent: the reemergence of nationalism and 
unresolved ethnic and religious struggles in Eastern Europe. For every other 
security problem in Europe, there is an apparent solution. Lacking so far is 
some means to head off trouble and resolve strife in the volatile center of 
Europe that was the seedbed of two world wars. 
</P>
<P>
In the West, wise leadership after the World War II helped ameliorate 
long-standing conflict between the western part of a divided Germany and its 
neighbors, especially France. Democratic institutions, the European Community, 
U.S. leadership and a generation of prosperity did their work, so much so that 
German unity has provoked far less concern than would have greeted this step 
even a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
Not so in the East, where Soviet power and communist regimes merely suppressed 
nationalism and age-old antagonisms. With the events of 1989, frozen 
relationships in Eastern Europe simply thawed out. Not surprisingly, national 
self-awareness allied itself with anti-communism, fostering political attitudes 
more akin to 19th-Century practice than to Western Europe's 21st-Century 
merging of sovereignties. 
</P>
<P>
A congeries of rivalries and suppressed hatreds has reemerged, from 
antisemitism to border disputes to the status of ethnic and religious 
minorities. Struggles long forgotten by the outside world have reappeared, with 
names out of pre-war days -- Transylvania, Ruthenia, Carpathia, Kosovo, 
Slovenia. Turks in Bulgaria are repressed; Yugoslavia totters on the edge of 
dissolution; the country that is home to Czechs and Slovaks has twice changed 
its name in search of a mutually acceptable formula. 
</P>
<P>
Balkanization has return to the Balkans. But there is a critical difference 
from 1914, when the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand ignited a world war. 
Then, the great powers either wished to exploit regional, ethnic, and religious 
strife or were unable to disentangle themselves from its consequences. Today, 
instability is the major powers' common enemy, and all would welcome a means of 
containing if not resolving local problems until democracy and economic 
prosperity can help change underlying attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, none of the major powers is prepared to cede to others a unilateral 
right of action. Last December, Secretary of State James A. Baker III suggested 
that failure of the Romanian revolution might justify the introduction of 
Soviet troops. He quickly qualified his statement, in the process illustrating 
both the nature of shared U.S.-Soviet interests and the unacceptability of 
unilateral action. The same no doubt would hold true for U.S. intervention, 
say, to prevent civil war among Yugoslav republics. 
</P>
<P>
Two developments point to a desirable course of action. During the past three 
years, the Soviet Union has significantly modified its attitude toward the 
United Nations, moving it in the direction envisioned when its charter was 
signed in 1945. The U.N. role in peacemaking and peacekeeping thus has a 
promising future. At the same time, the search for a new European security 
framework has highlighted the role of the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe. This 35-nation group, including the Vatican and San 
Marino as well as the United States and the Soviet Union, is clearly not able 
to provide a sure basis for security, but it has already gained stature as a 
rallying point for political arrangements spanning the Continent. Its 
significance is certain to grow. 
</P>
<P>
CSCE would therefore be an ideal locus for efforts to resolve conflicts in 
Eastern Europe, to promote peacemaking, and -- should engaged parties agree -- 
even to undertake peacekeeping with troops from several European states, 
patterned on U.N. peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
To undertake these duties, CSCE would need to become a permanent institution, 
with a headquarters and a bureaucracy. To avoid the requirement of unanimous 
action, which currently keeps it from being a serious framework for European 
security, CSCE would need to have a flexible membership for tasks like conflict 
resolution, as is already being done at the 23-nation Vienna talks on reducing 
conventional forces. Conflict resolution also requires a set of principles for 
acting: Among other things, there must be a basis for compromise between 
rigidly forestalling change in Eastern Europe and permitting each minority to 
constitute itself as an independent country. 
</P>
<P>
Assigning these tasks to CSCE has one further benefit. At issue today is 
whether there can be a framework for security embracing the entire Continent. 
</P>
<P>
One school argues that only NATO or a viable substitute can keep the peace; 
another argues that common goals of peace and prosperity can be the basis for 
building a new collective security. The proposal advanced here can be a test of 
the latter proposition. If peacemaking and peacekeeping work in Eastern Europe, 
there will be reason to take seriously radical departures from approaches to 
European security that have dominated the past four decades.

3 KILLED, 2 INJURED AS CAR HITS POWER POLE IN CARSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three young men were killed and two were injured, one seriously, when their 
speeding car slammed into a power pole in Carson Wednesday night and split in 
half from the impact. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies identified the victims as four male teen-agers and one man 
in his early 20s, but did not release their names. 
</P>
<P>
A witness who was jogging in the area told investigators a blue Hyundai was 
traveling south at 8:33 p.m. in the 19000 block of Wilmington Avenue at up to 
70 m.p.h. when it went out of control and hit the pole, said Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Sgt. Lamar Bleavins. 
</P>
<P>
The driver and four passengers were thrown from the car on impact, he said. 
Three of the men were pronounced dead at the scene. The two others were taken 
to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Bleavins said, one with serious injuries and the 
other with cuts and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
Jogger Louis Evans, 21, saw the car speeding south on Wilmington Avenue. "I 
thought they were horsing around," he said. The driver then braked sharply, and 
the car hit the utility pole and "twisted up like it was cheap paper," Evans 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Poole of Compton said she was picking up cans and bottles along the 
edge of James Anderson Jr. Memorial Park, when she saw one passenger thrown 
free of the wreckage. He scrambled to his feet and walked back to the car 
dazed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities found the man wandering in the park looking for his shoe, which had 
been thrown clear during the crash. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate high-speed traffic fatality hours earlier, a 23-year-old 
suspected drunk driver who led sheriff's deputies on an 80-m.p.h. chase through 
Norwalk was fatally injured when he lost control of his car and it smashed into 
a tree, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Ruben Veliz Carrera of Norwalk was pronounced dead at Norwalk Community 
Hospital at 2:12 a.m., said Sgt. Robert Stoneman, a spokesman for the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Carrera was "weaving erratically" on Alondra Boulevard when deputies tried to 
stop him about 12:40 a.m., Stoneman said. About two miles later, he car lost 
control of the car, which sheared off a light pole and struck a tree, Stoneman 
said.

MIKE DOWNEY: IS THIS THE WAY TO END A GAME?

For 60 years there has been a World Cup, and for centuries there has been 
soccer in some form played by millions of adults and children from Africa to 
Antarctica to Asia. By now, wouldn't you think somebody would have figured out 
how these damned matches should end? 
</P>
<P>
As Argentina and West Germany on successive evenings catapulted themselves into 
Sunday's championship game of the world's most hotly contested sporting event 
by virtue of surviving dramatic, yet somewhat gimmicky, bang-bang penalty-kick 
shootouts, a controversial question resurfaced: 
</P>
<P>
Is this fair? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps a more pertinent question, particularly with the next World Cup coming 
to the United States and its yawning public, would be: 
</P>
<P>
How long should soccer players keep playing soccer? 
</P>
<P>
If a match is tied after two 45-minute halves and remains tied after two 
15-minute overtimes, what then? Should they "play on," as England's coach 
favors, until somebody scores or dies trying? Or should everybody just go home, 
get some sleep and start fresh a few days later, which is what they do in some 
of the English leagues? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the players should just keep on doing exactly what they have been doing 
at the last couple of World Cups -- settle some of the most important matches 
of their lives with a let's-get-this-thing-over-with series of penalty kicks, 
during which five men per side take alternating point-blank potshots at the 
other side's goalie. 
</P>
<P>
After England became the second team in two nights to play 120 minutes of 
even-steven soccer without a verdict, only to be expelled from the Cup in one 
of these Russian Roulette-like shootouts, the losing coach, Bobby Robson, while 
graciously accepting the fact that rules are rules, gently suggested a return 
to the way he preferred soccer to be played. 
</P>
<P>
"You play on," Robson said. "Another quarter of an hour, however long it takes. 
Because, eventually, somebody will crack. 
</P>
<P>
"Stamina and fighting spirit and fitness, these are virtues that will all come 
out in the end." 
</P>
<P>
Robson is a reasonable man, so it sounds reasonable. Rest assured, however, 
that no World Cup official with any fund-raising ambitions will be willing to 
push too hard for such a change for the 1994 tournament, particularly with 
American television executives already balking at the prospect of bidding for 
the Cup rights. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, these shootouts make for great theater, perfect for TV. And 
furthermore, soccer people are trying to accommodate the networks by making the 
game easier to watch -- and easier to insert advertisements -- by splitting the 
halves into four quarters. Who in his right mind wants to promote longer soccer 
matches? 
</P>
<P>
From strictly a spectator's standpoint, we adore these shoot-outs. It was real 
edge-of-the-seat stuff, seeing goalkeepers guessing which way to lean and 
diving headlong for shots. When the heroic Diego Maradona messed up a chip shot 
against Yugoslavia in an earlier match, nearly costing his country its chance 
at another championship, he all but wept. When Maradona's aim was true against 
Italy, he hugged everybody in sight and called it one of the highlights of his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
England's players cried in their dressing room at Stadio Delle Alpi here 
Wednesday night after being eliminated by West Germany -- or, more accurately, 
after eliminating themselves. Stuart Pearce's kick struck the diving German 
goalie in the legs, a frightful bit of bad luck. Chris Waddle's subsequent 
kick, toward a net a few steps in front of him, sailed over the goal and all 
the way into the grandstand, perhaps 50 yards into the distance. That might not 
have ever happened to him in his life. 
</P>
<P>
"The shootout, it puts a lot of pressure on the individual player," Robson 
said. "I'm not sure that's right." 
</P>
<P>
Soccer is a sport in which scarcely anyone gets off a free, clear, swift kick. 
Suddenly, two hours into the drama, both teams take seats in the grass and send 
forth designated booters, who must make a lonely walk from midfield to the 
place where the ball is spotted, knowing full well what one mistake might mean. 
</P>
<P>
When two Italians failed in Tuesday's shootout, in essence they cost Italy what 
might very well be its only chance to win the World Cup at home over the next 
20 to 40 years. When the two Englishmen failed the next night, so ended the bid 
of a soccer-mad nation that has won the World Cup only once, in 1966. There 
will always be an England, but there won't always be chances such as this. 
</P>
<P>
The coach, Robson, trying to size up the situation pragmatically, said: 
"Football teaches you to be resilient, and if you can't be that, you should get 
out of the game. Our players have tears in their eyes in the dressing room, and 
I'm trying to keep mine from falling. Back home, there must be 60 million 
people, crying just like us. 
</P>
<P>
"But, all I know is, that's the third match in succession we've had to play the 
extra half-hour, and I couldn't have gotten any more out of these players. We 
can go back home with honor." 
</P>
<P>
Would they have given England another half-hour if necessary, then another, 
then another? Yes, gladly. Since 1982, however, World Cup contests have been 
decided this way -- this strange, suspenseful, thrilling, exasperating, 
terribly abrupt way -- by shootout. 
</P>
<P>
Is it a way to put some more sock in soccer, or is it a cheap way of treating a 
valuable prize? 
</P>
<P>
Robson knows what it is. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good way to win if you knock 'em in," he said. "It's a hard way to lose 
if you don't."

ANGELS WASTE HITS, FALL TO THE BLUE JAYS AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
TORONTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Angels' performances are becoming as stale as summer reruns. 
</P>
<P>
This is the plot: Reaching double figures in hits, the offense short-circuits 
and reaches double figures in runners left on base. The Angels suffer for the 
lack of one timely hit, one spark. 
</P>
<P>
Except for a few minor details, their 4-2 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays 
Wednesday night at the SkyDome was a replay of the Angels' 5-2 loss Tuesday 
night. They collected 12 hits (compared with 15 on Tuesday) and stranded 10 
runners, compared with 13 Tuesday. In both games they had runners on base in 
every inning except the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting that one hit, that's what separates the first division from the second 
division," Brian Downing said. "They give you a run, you get it." 
</P>
<P>
The Angel lost for the eighth time in their last 11 games and are 11 1/2 games 
out of first place in the AL West. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually all these hits might turn into a bunch of runs," said catcher Lance 
Parrish, who led off the sixth inning with a home run against John Cerutti 
(5-6). 
</P>
<P>
"Jack (Howell) is hitting, Wally (Joyner) has started to come around. We might 
be on the verge of some tremendous streak. . . . (But) we can't keep getting 11 
hits or whatever and getting two runs every day." 
</P>
<P>
According to Angel Manager Doug Rader, two runs should have been enough to make 
a winner of Jim Abbott (5-7). Toronto's two first-inning runs were unearned, 
the result of a throwing error by Abbott on a short grounder by Tony Fernandez 
that Rader said should have been played by Howell, the third baseman. 
</P>
<P>
Abbott's throw bounced into the dirt in front of first base, where Joyner 
juggled it but couldn't hold on. Fernandez went to third on Glenallen Hill's 
double and scored on George Bell's sacrifice fly. Hill scored when center 
fielder Devon White's throw home went into the stands on the third base side. 
</P>
<P>
Rader also deemed the Blue Jays' second-inning run preventable. Ken Williams 
doubled with one out and was breaking for third with Tom Lawless at bat. Howell 
broke to cover the bag in case of a throw, and Lawless singled into short left 
field to score Williams. 
</P>
<P>
"The game came down to the appropriate thing not being done by one of our 
infielders and not being able to drive in runs that are pretty much given to 
you," Rader said. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, Howell agreed. "You take any balls in that direction," he said. 
"I was going forward, plus it's a tougher play with Abbott." 
</P>
<P>
Despite not having a right hand, Abbott is an excellent fielder. His error was 
his first this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was my ball either way," he said. "The ball wasn't far off the 
mound. I had a couple of choices. One was to field it with my glove and try to 
do the switch (so he could throw with his left hand). I chose to field it 
without the glove and be in position to throw. I fielded it cleanly. I just 
hurried the ball and bounced it." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Borders' run-scoring single in the third inning scored the Blue Jays' final 
run. Abbott retired the next 14 batters. 
</P>
<P>
"(Abbott) was very poised. He should be very proud of the job he did," Rader 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of tough," Abbott said. "I just try to work hard and be consistent 
in my approach. I've had some bad games, but I haven't been as consistent as 
I'd like, and I hope to be a little more consistent in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Second baseman Johnny Ray went home to Chouteau, Okla., Wednesday after his 
wife went into labor with the couple's second child. It's not yet known when he 
will rejoin the club. 
</P>
<P>
In his absence, Rick Schu started at second, Schu's fourth position this 
season. Schu -- who has also played third, first and left field and is the 
emergency catcher -- played capably until he bobbled two grounders in the 
eighth inning. Neither cost the Angels a run. . . . Chili Davis missed his 
second consecutive game because of back spasms but might return today. . . . 
X-rays on Donnie Hill's bruised left ankle were negative, but it was too 
swollen for him to play.

DODGERS' LOSS TO THE CUBS REALLY ONE FOR THE BOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was Fireworks Night at Dodger Stadium, but it should have been Rulebook 
Night. 
</P>
<P>
Give everyone in the sellout crowd of 46,811 at Dodger Stadium a rulebook and 
they might have been able to figure out what was going on in the Cubs' 5-3 
victory as a series of odd plays sent Wednesday's official scorer, Wayne 
Monroe, on several forays through the rules. 
</P>
<P>
The weirdness peaked in the top of the sixth, with the Cubs protecting a 4-2 
lead against losing pitcher Fernando Valenzuela (6-7). With two outs, Marvell 
Wynne singled and went to second on a wild pitch. Joe Girardi singled to left, 
where Kal Daniels came up throwing and appeared to get Wynne at the plate with 
a strike. 
</P>
<P>
But third base umpire Charlie Reliford ruled Lenny Harris had obstructed Wynne, 
and the run was allowed. Under rule 10.13, Section F, Harris received an error, 
Girardi got an RBI, Reliford got an argument from Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda 
and the run was unearned. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in the big leagues 20 years and I've never seen that play called," 
Lasorda said. "(Harris) never touched him. (Reliford) said he broke his 
stride." 
</P>
<P>
Wynne admitted he "wouldn't have protested that call," but said, "He made me 
take a wider turn. Looking back, yes, he did interfere with me." 
</P>
<P>
Harris likened it to decoying a runner on a fly ball. "That's baseball," he 
said. "You can't give the game away on a call like that. That doesn't make 
sense." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers got their run for the rulebook in the same inning. Eddie Murray led 
off with a single, and Mike Scioscia hit a one-out double down the right-field 
line. As Murray came around third, Ryne Sandberg's relay throw home appeared to 
have him beaten but bounced past catcher Girardi. 
</P>
<P>
Sandberg was given a rare error, Scioscia no RBI. Under Rule 10.13, Section B, 
the official scorer can assume an out if the throw clearly beat the runner. The 
ruling drew a protesting phone call to the press box from Cub Manager Don 
Zimmer. 
</P>
<P>
Before things settled down, the Dodgers loaded the bases against three 
relievers in the ninth, but they failed to score and lost, remaining 10 1/2 
games behind the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
Coming off his no-hitter against St. Louis, Valenzuela was off his form early 
Wednesday -- bobbing and weaving, working in and out of trouble. "Fernando 
didn't have total command early," Scioscia said. "He settled down as the game 
went on. You know Fernando -- the first couple innings are the innings you have 
to get to him." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers gave him a 2-0 pad in the first inning when Kirk Gibson, who had 
three hits, singled and Murray homered two batters later off Mike Harkey, who 
improved to 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela extended his string of no-hit innings to 10 with a perfect first, 
but his bid for a second no-hitter ended in the second inning when Hector 
Villanueva singled. One out later, Wynne launched a home run over the 
center-field fence to tie the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs took a 4-2 lead in the fourth inning when Villanueva led off with a 
single and Wynne walked. Both scored on Girardi's double. Girardi, who had 
three hits and three runs batted in, advanced to third on Harkey's bloop single 
but Valenzuela avoided further trouble thanks to Girardi's base-running gaffe. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Dascenzo flied out to left, and when Girardi bluffed a start for home he 
strayed too far from third and was caught by the cutoff man for your basic 
7-5-6 double play. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers had runners on second in both the seventh and eighth innings and 
Harkey was lifted after 6 2/3 innings, but they couldn't score against Steve 
Wilson, Bill Long or Paul Assenmacher. 
</P>
<P>
When they mounted a final threat in the ninth, Les Lancaster came out of the 
bullpen with two out and two on and a 2-0 count on Murray, who walked. But 
Lancaster retired Hubie Brooks on a grounder to short for his fifth save. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Reviews of Terry Wells' debut against the Cubs Tuesday were generally 
favorable. "He showed a good fastball. He threw it by a couple pretty good 
fastball hitters -- (Ryne) Sandberg and (Andre) Dawson," Dodger Manager Tom 
Lasorda said. "He'll have a better curve. He'll definitely get a few more 
shots." . . . Mike Hartley, who threw two innings in relief of Wells, ended up 
with his first major league victory, ending a long wait for the 28-year-old 
rookie. "I was close to one earlier in the year but we went into extra 
innings," he said. "I was hoping it wouldn't take too long." Hartley said he 
didn't do anything special to celebrate. "I got a couple phone calls from my 
cousins in Chicago. They were pretty pumped up because it was against the 
Cubs." . . . Hartley and Jim Gott threw three scoreless innings in relief 
Tuesday, the first time in eight outings the bullpen was not scored on. . . . 
Ramon Martinez was named National League pitcher of the month for June. He was 
4-0 with a 1.76 earned-run average and 56 strikeouts in 46 innings.

JIM MURRAY: FENWAY, BOGGS A CHORUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You would think the configuration of Fenway Park in Boston would send a class 
left-handed batter screaming into the night. It would look to him like the 
structural equivalent of Frankenstein's monster, a nightmare in steel and 
concrete. 
</P>
<P>
There isn't even a geometric figure to describe its eccentricity. The way the 
expanses of right and center field are cut into by the left field fence make it 
look like a balloon with a corset in it. 
</P>
<P>
When Ted Williams first came up to the Boston Red Sox, they had only one 
left-handed hitter, Roger (Doc) Cramer. Cramer came to the rookie Williams with 
a word of advice. "Kid," he said, "don't try to pull the ball to hit home runs 
here. It can't be done." Cramer knew whereof he spoke. He had come to the Red 
Sox from friendlier Philadelphia's ballpark with modest power. But he had hit 
only one home run in five years at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Williams didn't listen to him, of course, and proceeded to hit 31 home runs 
that season. 
</P>
<P>
But that was Williams, the greatest striker of the baseball for his time. For 
the merely mortal left-handed hitter, the right field seats were 380 feet away. 
Most major league home runs are in the 330-350-foot range, some less. 
</P>
<P>
You would think a great left-handed hitter would need smelling salts the first 
look he got at Fenway's outposts. 
</P>
<P>
For Wade Boggs, it was like his first sighting of the Taj Mahal or the Grand 
Canyon. It caught his breath. He got weak in the knees, a dreamy look in his 
eyes and he looked like a guy about to sing under a balcony. 
</P>
<P>
You know how some guys at the school dance actually opt for the girl with the 
buck teeth and the thick glasses? She looks just gorgeous to them. They step 
right over the Marilyn Monroe lookalikes to get at them. 
</P>
<P>
That's the way Wade Boggs was. He got tongue-tied just looking at that old 
bawd, the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen. Every place he looked he saw 
money. He wouldn't change a thing. 
</P>
<P>
You would think only a right-handed hitter could love Fenway. After all, that 
left field wall is only 315 feet away, and it cuts directly across into center 
field without veering out. It's so close they have to put a 30-foot net atop it 
to keep balls from breaking windows across the street. It was built in the days 
when ballparks were constructed to accommodate the streets around them, not 
vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
The wall not only doesn't scare Boggs, he embraces it. He loves every wart and 
wrinkle on her. They could make beautiful music together, he was sure. 
</P>
<P>
Boggs plays the wall the way Heifetz played Mozart or Chopin an etude. He can 
play Stars And Stripes Forever on it if you give him enough hanging curveballs. 
</P>
<P>
Other lefties may curse and fume at the lopsided dimensions of the ballpark, 
but Wade just incorporates them in his game plan. Wade plays the hand he's 
dealt. 
</P>
<P>
Some years ago, Wade Boggs went to arbitration in a sometime bitter dispute 
with the ball club. Boggs didn't really want more money. He just wanted to stay 
around his soulmate, the ballpark. He wanted a five-year, no-trade deal. He 
just didn't want a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
It would be like asking Toscanini to leave his orchestra. "I love this 
ballpark. I love Boston," Boggs explained. 
</P>
<P>
Why wouldn't he? In 1985, Wade Boggs tapped out 240 hits, the most in the 
American League since 1928 (Heinie Manush, 241) and the most in the big leagues 
since 1930 (Bill Terry, 254). His lifetime batting average going into this 
season was an astounding .352. That's Ty Cobb territory. In fact, the only 
batters ahead of Boggs in the game are Cobb, Rogers Hornsby and Shoeless Joe 
Jackson, pretty heady company. He is supposed to be a ping hitter, but he has 
rapped out 335 doubles, many of them off the left field wall, and he once hit 
24 homers in a season, just to show he could. 
</P>
<P>
But, mostly, he just wears out left field. Around the league it used to be said 
Wade Boggs was the only hitter in the league who only needed one strike. Some 
seasons, he got over 50% of his hits with two strikes on him. "His only real 
weakness is called strike three," his former manager, John MacNamara, once 
observed. Boggs "umpires" himself out of an at-bat at times. He also walks 100 
times a year. So, he also umpires his way on base. 
</P>
<P>
Most kids are still learning to walk at 18 months. Wade Boggs was learning to 
hit. He has a picture of himself at bat at 18 months. "Ted Williams once saw a 
picture of me as a baby, and he said I had perfect form," Boggs says proudly. 
</P>
<P>
Gifted with 20/12 vision (he sees at 20 feet what others need to be 12 feet to 
make out) and sound mechanics at the plate (his stance hasn't changed since 18 
months), Boggs is the nearest thing to a hitting machine in the game. It is a 
measure of his prowess that a broadcaster on the Fourth of July telecast as he 
came to bat noted Boggs was batting "a mere .300." Batting .300 would be cause 
enough for most players in the league to throw a party and bronze the ball. 
With Boggs, they want to send him to the hospital for testing. 
</P>
<P>
He gets on base a phenomenal 300 times a year. The Red Sox cannot win the 
pennant without him. If other people see Fenway as an ugly old battle-ax who 
hates left-handers, Boggs sees her as Michelle Pfeiffer. "I always hit the ball 
to left field anyway," he said contentedly the other day as he sat in the Red 
Sox locker room munching a chicken sandwich. "This place was built for me."

Rather quietly, Dwight Evans has been one of baseball's best clutch hitters. At 
38, despite a serious back problem, he is still the man the Boston Red Sox 
count on when the going gets tough. 
</P>
<P>
Evans hit a three-run home run with two out in the ninth inning at Minneapolis 
Wednesday to give the leaders of the American League East a 4-3 victory over 
the Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
Evans said he was just trying to get a hit to tie the score, at 3-3, but he 
drove an inside fastball from bullpen ace Rick Aguilera over the fence in left 
for his 10th home run. 
</P>
<P>
"Aguilera has been tough on me all year," Evans said. "When I hit it, I was 
sure it was a hit, but I wasn't sure it was going out." 
</P>
<P>
It was only the third time in 22 chances that Aguilera failed to get a save. He 
said Evans hit a good pitch, not a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, who has been with the Red Sox since 1972, thought his career was over 
this spring. His problem was diagnosed as a bone spur and a stress fracture in 
the lower back. With treatment, he has been able to perform as the designated 
hitter. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of weeks ago, he beat the Baltimore Orioles with home runs in 
successive games. In one, his two-run homer in the 10th was the first home run 
off bullpen star Gregg Olson in more than a year. The next day he hit a homer 
and drove in the other run in a 2-0 win. 
</P>
<P>
He is halfway to his goal of hitting 20 or more home runs for 10 consecutive 
seasons. The only time he has failed to hit 20 or more since 1977 was in 1980 
when he missed 14 games and had only 18. 
</P>
<P>
"The back doesn't really bother me, but it does prevent me from playing the 
outfield," Evans said. "I would rather be playing." 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 7, Oakland 1 -- In his first start after pitching a no-hitter, Dave 
Stewart was no mystery to the Brewers at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart (10-7) gave up six runs in 2 1/3 innings, his shortest outing ever for 
the Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Robinson (2-1) gave up eight hits and pitched his first complete game in 
six years. 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers ended a five-game losing streak against the pitcher who was 12-1 
lifetime against them. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 10, Chicago 7 -- Mike Heath hit a three-run home run with one out in 
the 12th inning at Chicago and the Tigers kept the White Sox from regaining 
first place in the West. 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox battled back after the Tigers scored five times in the fourth 
inning. They finally tied it, 7-7, in the bottom of the eighth. The tying run 
scored on a wild pitch by Mike Henneman, whose error contributed to the first 
run of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Lusader, who hit his first home run for the Tigers, a three-run smash in 
the fourth, singled with one out to start the winning rally. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Kittle hit two home runs for the White Sox, who remained a game behind 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 3, Cleveland 2 -- At 6-foot-10, left-hander Randy Johnson of the 
Mariners towers over batters. He also seems to be intimidating them. 
</P>
<P>
In sweltering weather at Cleveland, Johnson (9-3) gave up seven hits and two 
runs in six innings and won his sixth in a row. Johnson, the league's pitcher 
of the month in June, began his streak with a no-hitter June 2 against Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy Jones homered for the Mariners and Ken Griffey, Jr., the first Mariner 
elected to the All-Star game, extended his hitting streak to 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 13, New York 6 -- Hot-hitting Bo Jackson hit a long three-run home 
run to center to trigger a seven-run seventh inning rally at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth loss in a row for the Yankees, who had taken the lead on a 
three-run home run in the top of the seventh by catcher Bob Geren. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson has hit six of his 15 home runs in the last nine games. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 9, Texas 4 -- Sam Horn, recalled from the minors earlier in the week, 
hit a two-run home run in the fourth inning at Arlington, Tex., to break a tie 
and give Dave Johnson (8-4) a 5-0 record after Orioles' defeats. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson left with nobody out in the sixth, giving up four runs and five hits.

STRAWBERRY HOME RUN STIRS METS AGAIN

<P>
A month ago, when Darryl Strawberry said he wanted a contract comparable to 
Jose Canseco's, the New York Mets' executives could have laughed. 
</P>
<P>
They aren't laughing now. They realize that to keep their slugging outfielder, 
there might have to come up with something close to the $23.5 million Canseco 
will get over five years from Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry is on a spree, and he is pulling the Mets along with him. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry hit another three-run home run Wednesday night at New York and Mike 
Marshall broke an eighth-inning tie with a sacrifice fly as the streaking Mets 
beat Houston, 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Johnson, who went four for five, hit a two-run home run after Marshall 
put the Mets ahead. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets have won 21 of their last 24 games, and the Astros, who fought back 
from a 4-0 deficit to tie the game, have lost 16 of their last 17 road games. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Mets want to keep me, they can prove it with a major offer," Strawberry 
said soon after he began his streak, which includes 12 home runs in the last 22 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Although Dwight Gooden (8-5) was bothered by a blister on his pitching hand, he 
went eight innings, giving up four runs. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 5, Cincinnati 3 -- Dennis Martinez limited the Reds to five hits in 
eight innings at Montreal and his teammates got to Scott Scudder, recently 
recalled from the minors, quickly. 
</P>
<P>
The Expos, who had lost six of their previous seven games, knocked Scudder out 
in a five-run first that featured a two-run single by Mike Aldrete and a 
two-run double by Andres Galarraga. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds were without second baseman Mariano Duncan, who had a minor neck 
sprain after being involved in an auto accident on the way to the park. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 9, St. Louis 2 -- Forced to find replacements for his injured 
starters, Manager Roger Craig has found two gems. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, Trevor Wilson, improved to 5-0 with a shutout Tuesday night, and 
John Burkett (8-2) was the winner in this game at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Burkett held the Cardinals to four hits in seven innings and became a winner 
when the Giants scored four runs in the seventh and four more in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 5, Pittsburgh 4 -- Despite anxious moments in the ninth inning at San 
Diego, the Padres ended their seven-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates, whose lead in the East was cut to half a game over the surging 
Mets, scored once in the ninth, had the tying run on second with one out and 
hot-hitting Barry Bonds at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds hit a line drive, but shortstop Garry Templeton caught the smash and 
turned it into a game-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 4, Philadelphia 1 -- Dale Murphy hit a home run and drove in two runs 
at Philadelphia as the Braves again beat the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Glavine (5-5) was the winner, going 6 2/3 innings. DAN HAFNER

WORLD CUP '90;

ARGENTINA WILL BE MISSING FOUR STARTERS;

TITLE GAME: PENALTIES WILL KEEP CANIGGIA, THREE OTHERS OUT OF THE REMATCH 
AGAINST WEST GERMANY.

<P>
Argentina will meet West Germany for the World Cup title Sunday without four 
starters, including striker Claudio Caniggia, whose goals helped get the team 
to the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Caniggia, who scored Argentina's winning goal in the second round against 
Brazil and the tying goal in Tuesday's semifinal victory over Italy, will not 
be allowed to play in the championship match because of the yellow card he 
received for a deliberate hand ball in the game in Naples. 
</P>
<P>
Also suspended are Argentine midfielders Ricardo Giusti and Julio Olarticoechea 
and defender Sergio Batista. 
</P>
<P>
Giusti was tossed out of Tuesday's match for elbowing Italian midfielder 
Roberto Baggio in the face. French referee Michel Vautrot's back was turned, 
but the foul was spotted by Danish linesman Peter Mikkelsen, who became the 
target of extensive verbal abuse from the Argentine players and bench for 
pointing it out. 
</P>
<P>
Olarticoechea and Batista each had been cautioned in Argentina's quarterfinal 
match against Yugoslavia, and each received another yellow card (and automatic 
suspension) on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Just how Argentine Coach Carlos Bilardo will replace the four players is not 
yet known. "It's a problem," is all Bilardo would say when asked that question 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Without Caniggia, Bilardo has no one with true speed to penetrate the German 
defense and to run to the passes sent in by Diego Maradona. Batista is a 
veteran of the 1986 championship team, and his experience was needed against 
the West Germans, losers to Argentina in the final four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Franz Beckenbauer, West Germany's coach, said the loss of the four Argentine 
players will not necessarily make his team's task any easier. 
</P>
<P>
"Argentina is a very, very good team," he said in Turin Wednesday night after 
West Germany's victory over England. "No game is easy. We don't underestimate 
Argentina. They have a lot of other players. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope it will be as good a game on Sunday as it was tonight." 
</P>
<P>
In Rome Wednesday, long faces were a common sight because, in the words of one 
cab driver, "the World Cup is finished." 
</P>
<P>
Italy's loss to Argentina had not been expected, and Italian Coach Azeglio 
Vicini tried to explain it by saying: "In the long run, we suffered from 
fatigue, but also because we always tried to satisfy the crowd." 
</P>
<P>
What Vicini meant was that Italy, instead of playing its usual defensive style 
in the World Cup, had tried to be more entertaining and to attack more often. 
</P>
<P>
"Playing at home didn't help the team," he said. "It forced us to use an 
attacking tactic." 
</P>
<P>
In Argentina, the defending champion's return to the World Cup title match was 
greeted with delight. One newspaper called Italy "just one more morsel on the 
way to the great celebration under preparation to take home the World Cup." 
</P>
<P>
Brazil's Jornal da Tarde was more succinct. One headline in the Sao Paolo paper 
stated bluntly: "God is an Argentine."

NOTES: AFTERMATH OF SEMIFINALS RESULTS IN TWO DEATHS

<P>
Two people died and nearly 200 were arrested after street celebrations turned 
violent Wednesday following Argentina's Tuesday victory over Italy in a World 
Cup semifinal match. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands in the country celebrated Argentina's advance to the World Cup final, 
but revelry turned chaotic when several hundred youths began breaking into 
shops in Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Alba, 54, was beaten to death after he refused to hand over the Argentine 
flag he was waving to a group of about 10 young men in Florencio, 18 miles 
south of Buenos Aires, police said. The other victim, Walter Soria, 22, was hit 
by a stray bullet as he celebrated in a western suburb of Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
English soccer fans marked their team's defeat with an outburst of violence. 
</P>
<P>
Police said more than 200 people were arrested as soccer hooligans went on the 
rampage in London and at least 28 other English cities Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Hooligans attacked German-made cars in London and at the seaside town of 
Brighton, 50 miles south of the capital, police locked 300 German students in a 
nightclub for their own safety as hundreds of English fans swarmed outside. 
</P>
<P>
An Argentine man was attacked and beaten by Italians in Macerata in eastern 
Italy after he noisily celebrated Argentina's World Cup semifinal victory, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Cesar Tartuferi, 27, who has lived in Macerata for 16 years, was attacked by 
about 70 people after he drove down the street sounding his horn loudly to 
celebrate the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Police rescued Tartuferi, who was kicked and punched. He was not seriously 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
A 23-year-old German was stabbed in the back and critically wounded when a 
fight broke out among fans in Turin, Italy, before the West Germany-England 
match. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Manfred Girr, of the Frankfurt area, was taken to Mauriziano 
Hospital for emergency surgery, which was successful. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses' reports of the nationality of the assailants were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Police used tear gas to disperse hundreds of Italians who broke down a gate and 
attacked English fans sleeping in a park in Turin. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-three Italians were arrested, police chief Antonio Beradino said. Three 
Italians and a policeman were reported hospitalized. Witnesses said some 
Italians wore scarves in the colors of the Turin soccer team Juventus to recall 
the rioting in Brussels' Heysel stadium in 1985. In that incident, 39 people, 
most of them Italians, died during a European Cup championship game against the 
English team from Liverpool.

A LITTLE CORNER OF THE WHIRLED; 
</P>
<P>
HIS GIG MAKES LIFE A LITTLE BREEZIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
When Daniel Fleming swore off cigarettes and stopped watching television three 
years ago, he wanted a hobby to replace his vices. He wanted a little something 
that would occupy his hands and keep him from gnawing the linoleum off the 
kitchen floor. 
</P>
<P>
A union carpenter for more than 25 years, it seemed only natural that Fleming 
would follow the way of the wood. He got the idea for his hobby after visiting 
a friend, a retired carpenter, who had a whirligig in his back yard. 
</P>
<P>
Fleming took one look at his friend's handmade whirligig and a sort of envy set 
in. When he got home, Fleming headed straight for his workshop. 
</P>
<P>
Then Fleming sent away for a catalogue of patterns. He's been making whirligigs 
ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Whirly whats? Whirligigs are gaily painted wood ornaments, usually in the shape 
of birds, with movable parts that whirl or spin in the wind like a pinwheel. 
Some say they frighten off gophers and birds, but Fleming says they simply add 
some color and activity to liven up a yard. 
</P>
<P>
What Fleming hadn't counted on was a hobby that turned into more of a part-time 
job. His evenings are spent in his workshop, crafting pieces of ash and sugar 
pine into wings and bodies. His Sundays are spent selling his finished product 
on the shoulder of California 76 near Interstate 15 in Fallbrook. He calls his 
weekend business "Wood 'N Wind." 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing is silly," the 57-year-old Vista resident said. "I had no 
intentions at all of selling them, but I had so many of them around the house." 
</P>
<P>
With the help of a pattern, a scroll saw and a small belt sander, Fleming can 
make as many as 12 whirligigs at a time. Each whirligig is hand-sanded and gets 
three coats of paint, the most time-consuming aspect of the whole operation, 
Fleming said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the more standard whirligigs of ducks, flamingos and woodpeckers, 
Fleming makes models of a woodchopper chopping wood, an Indian paddling a canoe 
and a woman washing clothes. Depending on the type, the ornaments range in 
price from $35 to $75. 
</P>
<P>
Fleming is open for business on Sundays, usually from about 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
To find Fleming, look for a huge American flag staked alongside California 76 
in Fallbrook. He'll be surrounded by dozens of hummingbirds, ducks and eagles, 
their wooden wings just blowing in the wind. 
</P>

<P>
When we think of cactus, we usually visualize ungainly, prickly plants that 
somehow survive in stark surroundings such as the Mojave Desert. Actually, 
cacti and other succulents grow just about everywhere -- from desert to 
tropics, sea level to mountain peaks. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the micro climate peculiar to Vista and surrounding areas, more 
growers of cacti and other succulents can be found here in just a few square 
miles than anywhere else in the world. The region provides the perfect 
climactic compromise: warm but not too warm, cool but not too cold. 
</P>
<P>
Although each grower has carved out his or her own niche, all share a love for 
the plants they raise. They also say that interest in their product has 
increased lately, probably for two reasons: the need to conserve water and the 
trend toward the Southwestern look in architecture and design. 
</P>
<P>
Cacti are just one of many plant families categorized as succulents because of 
their ability to store water. In other words, all cacti are succulents, but not 
all succulents are cacti. 
</P>
<P>
Cactus plants store water in their stems and tend to have a spiny or hairy 
covering rather than leaves, while other succulents retain moisture in either 
roots, leaves or stems. 
</P>

"Succulents were designed to survive in dry climates, and they came up with all 
manner of techniques to protect themselves from the harsh environment -- from 
dryness, sunlight and animals," said Sandy Williams, who owns and operates 
Homegrown Cacti and Succulents in Vista with her husband, Bruce. "For instance, 
spines and fur provide protection from sun, ribs a surface to gather water and 
to shade the plant." 
</P>
<P>
Many cacti also manufacture protective substances in their spines. You know 
when you've run into one of them because it hurts for days. 
</P>
<P>
The Williamses grow a wide variety of cacti and other succulents and sell their 
plants in 4- and 6-inch pots to wholesalers, who in turn sell to retail 
outlets, including nurseries, smaller non-chain stores and tourist attractions. 
</P>
<P>
Like most local growers, Sandy Williams sees an increased interest in 
succulents, and in using the plants in unique ways -- in wreaths, for example, 
as a substitute for holly. 
</P>
<P>
The owners of Silhouettes of the Desert in Vista also market succulents, 
ranging from the tiny to the huge. They sell to garden centers, nurseries, 
chain markets and landscapers all over the United States, as well as in Canada 
and overseas. 
</P>
<P>
"We've seen a steady increase in business the last two or three years," said 
manager Thais Aguirre. "People have discovered that cactus gardens don't have 
to consist of rocks and cow skulls. As fast as we get the plants in from the 
field, we're loading them up." 
</P>
<P>
Business has been so good at Hilltop Cacti in Vista that owner Theresa Roberts 
has added four greenhouses and increased her growing space by 10,000 square 
feet. Hilltop sells about 50% of its product to brokers, who resell to their 
own clients in the Midwest, New Jersey, New York and other areas. 
</P>
<P>
"The cacti and succulent business is very healthy right now," said John Cooper 
who, with wife Mary, owns Cooper's Cactus &amp; Succulents in Vista. "We've 
received numerous calls recently from local landscapers looking for 
drought-resistant plants." 
</P>
<P>
By mixing cacti and other succulents, Cooper said, Southern Californians can 
create a pleasing landscape at a reasonable price. 
</P>
<P>
Another mass wholesaler in North County is Western Cactus Growers, with acreage 
in both Vista and Escondido. Hans and Margaret Britsch have been in the 
business since 1966 and grow their product in greenhouses and fields. 
</P>
<P>
"The soil is better in Escondido for field growing," said Hans. "In Vista we 
have adobe soil and must add a lot of sand and other amendments." 
</P>
<P>
In general, cacti get their start from seeds while other succulents grow from 
cuttings. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most local growers, Carl Volkers and Jim Kampwirth of C and J Cactus 
Nursery in Vista eschew what they call the "chop-chop school." They planted 
their first seeds on New Year's Day, 1977, and they still grow by seed 
exclusively, hand pollinating with the help of small paintbrushes. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the best of both worlds," said Volkers. "We sell to collectors, 
especially European collectors. Cactus is big in Germany and England, and 
they've discovered it in Australia." 
</P>
<P>
David Grigsby bought the first plant grown at C &amp; J, and Grigsby Cactus 
Gardens sells plants retail as well as wholesale. Grigsby's clients range from 
local gardeners who drop by to pick up a plant or two, vacationers wanting a 
gift for their African tour guide, as well as botanical gardens around the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Other growers who have a retail market include Ferguson's Cacti and Succulents 
in Solana Beach, Cactus King Nursery in Encinitas and Rainbow Gardens in Vista. 
</P>
<P>
The slow-growing nature of the plants produced by most North County growers 
sets them apart from growers specializing in foliage plants. On the plus side, 
cacti tend to take up less space per plant, said Steve Harbour, sales 
coordinator for Altman Specialty Plants and Indian Rock Greenhouses, which 
grows approximately 1,500 varieties of cacti and other succulents. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes an impatiens plug approximately 10 to 12 weeks to reach one-gallon 
size," Harbour said. "On the other hand, a cactus seedling takes about two 
years to get to the smallest saleable size. Some species only grow one inch a 
year, so a five-foot plant may be as old as 60 years." 
</P>
<P>
Steven Anthony and Richard Romero of Excelsior Cactus and Succulent Gardens in 
Vista have started producing a different type of cacti and succulent, one that 
grows more quickly but, like its slower-growing cousins, accommodates the need 
to conserve water. 
</P>
<P>
For example, they have discovered a fast-maturing plant that looks similar to 
the rosette-shaped Echeveria, a slow grower. 
</P>
<P>
"It's finally the turn of the humble cactus," Anthony said. "Cacti and 
succulent gardens do not have to be desolate; there's such a wide range of 
color and texture. Besides, these are the hardiest plants in the world, because 
they evolved through hard times." 
</P>
<P>
Jay Jackson of Desert Theatre 2 in Vista also extols the virtue of the humble 
cactus and its companion succulents. He recommends succulents such as Euphorbia 
trigona as houseplants since they can thrive despite central heating, low light 
and infrequent watering. 
</P>
<P>
He ships his greenhouse- and field-grown plants all over the country and to 
Canada. Lately, landscapers in areas of California experiencing strict water 
rationing, have shown a new-found interest in the plants. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the increasing interest in succulents is that far more 
varieties are available now, said Louis Servatka, who, along with Norine 
Morehouse, owns Rancho Vista Cacti. 
</P>
<P>
"Growers, except those who sell to collectors, typically grew 10 varieties of 
Euphorbia," Servatka said. "There are over 3,000 varieties of Euphorbia out 
there, and now growers are more likely to carry 50 different types." 
</P>
<P>
Other local growers continue to concentrate on the traditional. Silverthorne 
Ranch in Fallbrook -- run by brothers Paul and Jerry Loomis, who took over the 
business started by their parents in 1948 -- sells all its products in pots and 
turns out 200,000 dish gardens a year. 
</P>
<P>
And the increased demand does not change the basic nature of the business, 
which Barbara Zink calls labor- and capital-intensive. She and husband Duane 
specialize in hanging plants at their Zink's Greenhouses in Vista, which she 
calls the cactus capital of the world. 
</P>
<P>
"People buy one cactus plant and get hooked," said Excelsior's Steven Anthony. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Natives of China and Japan will agree that their respective cuisines intersect 
at certain points. 
</P>
<P>
Both, for example, like the range of excitement that fresh ginger can bring to 
a dish. Both also agree that soy sauce cuts the mustard. And there is 
absolutely no question that the Chinese and Japanese not only insist upon the 
freshest ingredients, but make them taste as if they were picked or caught just 
moments before cooking. 
</P>
<P>
So much for similarities. The cuisines are enormously divergent, partly because 
the Japanese willingly adopt Western influences (their tempura batter-fried 
foods are of Portuguese origin, and their mayonnaise-based dressings borrowed 
from modern America), while the Chinese have such an enormous repertoire of 
recipes that the French, by comparison, seem remarkably narrow in their tastes. 
</P>
<P>
A Vista restaurant called Mandarin Shogun offers a menu of both Japanese and 
Chinese dishes, but the alliance seems one of convenience since the sushi bar 
is what dominates the dining room. The page of kung pao, Szechwan and 
sweet-and-sour items at the end of the menu seems to be a mannered alternative 
to the teriyakis, tempuras and sukiyakis. 
</P>
<P>
The sole hybrid dish is an appetizer, called pork dumplings, that finishes the 
Japanese gyoza pastries with the hearty, appetizing fried crust associated with 
Chinese pot-stickers. Served with a decidedly Japanese sauce of soy garnished 
with snippets of scallion, these make a much better starter than the indelicate 
tempura (vegetables and bananas cut in oversized pieces) and the age dashi 
tofu. These hunks of fried tofu that trail streamers of batter coating, were 
immersed in a soy-scallion sauce of some merit but tasted unpleasantly of 
over-used cooking oil. 
</P>
<P>
The lengthy Japanese entree list hits many high spots, and some offerings are 
quite good. One exception was the beef sukiyaki, perforce a signature dish at 
most Japanese houses, but here a lackluster bowl of dry, crumbly beef and tired 
vegetables in a sauce that lacked the sweetness and robust appeal of the usual 
sukiyaki. The guest who ordered it turned her attention to the rice and salad 
after taking a third tentative taste of the pallid preparation. 
</P>
<P>
The chicken teriyaki, served in great abundance, was a far happier expression 
of the kitchen's talents and featured truly tender chicken brushed with the 
classically sticky-sweet, deeply flavorful sauce. The meat was diced rather 
than served whole, which is the more usual method. But this departure made the 
teriyaki even more agreeable. 
</P>
<P>
The one outstanding entree sampled, the ginger pork, was immersed in a fiercely 
sweet, richly soy-flavored sauce that by rights should have been the basis of 
the sukiyaki dish. Basically a stew, the entree differed markedly from those 
commonly encountered on Japanese menus and was a delight to the bottom of the 
bowl. The shreds of pork were joined by tender onion and zucchini rounds in a 
broth finely flavored with fresh ginger. 
</P>
<P>
All entrees, including those from the Chinese list, are accompanied by soup 
(the Japanese miso is typical, tofu-enriched and tasty); sticky rice and 
lettuce in a heavy dressing of seasoned mayonnaise. Other Japanese entree 
choices include tonkatsu (deep-fried pork cutlet); sesame chicken; shrimp, 
scallop and chicken tempuras; swordfish teriyaki; the soup-stew of many 
ingredients called yosenabe and a long list of fish choices ranging from 
Canadian salmon to Utah trout to Mississippi catfish (these three, perhaps as a 
sign of the times, all are farm-raised).

After a two-year hiatus, international surfing competition will return to 
Oceanside with the opening of the Life's A Beach Surf "Klassik" on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Life's A Beach will feature double-A-rated men's, women's and long-board 
events. The combined purse will be $112,500, making it the largest tournament 
in the Assn. of Surfing Professionals' nine-event summer leg. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the world's leading surfers will be on hand for the tournament, 
including all of last year's top 30 men's competitors. A number of surfers from 
San Diego and the North County area are also expected to participate in the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
Carlsbad-based Life's A Beach Surfgear is the tournament's primary backer and 
will sponsor the men's competition. Jose Cuervo will sponsor the long-board 
event -- the first ASP long-board competition ever held in the United States -- 
and Take Cover will sponsor the women's event. 
</P>
<P>
Life's A Beach replaces the popular Stubbies International Pro Surfing 
Tournament, which was held in Oceanside from 1984 to 1988. Life's A Beach began 
to consider sponsoring an international surfing event in Oceanside last summer, 
after Stubbies announced that it could not afford to sponsor a 1989 tournament 
alone. Attempts to sign on additional sponsors were unsuccessful and the event 
was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
The Oceanside Chamber of Commerce estimates that as many as 5,000 people 
attended Stubbies' weekday events, and between 10,000 and 15,000 people 
attended the tournament's weekend events, tourism director Ken Kefauver said. 
</P>
<P>
The Klassik will begin with four days of trial heats starting Monday. Sixteen 
men and eight women will advance from these heats to the competition's main 
events, beginning Friday, where they will meet the world's top 30 men and top 
eight women surfers in one-on-one challenges. 
</P>
<P>
The quarterfinals, semifinals and finals will on Sunday. Each day's events 
begin at 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Event sponsors were disappointed last week when Tom Curren, considered by many 
to be unbeatable in his quest for this year's world men's title, confirmed that 
he would not attend Life's A Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The reclusive surfing master from Santa Barbara, who won three of ASP's first 
four World Tour events this year, sat out most of last year's tour to spend 
time with his family and has said that he would limit his participation in this 
year's tour for the same reason. 
</P>
<P>
What: Life's a Beach Surf Klassik 
</P>
<P>
Where: Oceanside Municipal Pier 
</P>
<P>
When: July 9-15. Each day's events begin at 7:00 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Cost: Free 
</P>
<P>
Calls: 931-9550 
</P>
<P>
Notes: Metered and lot parking in the area of the pier will be available.

STONEROCK, ARREOLA WHIP WEAK FIELDS IN NEWHALL ROAD RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having taken major strides toward becoming a top-notch race by offering prize 
money in 1989, the Independence Day Classic 5K road race backpedaled this year 
when race organizers decided not to offer any money to the top finishers. 
</P>
<P>
Minus the lure of $2,500 in prize money to draw in big names from other areas, 
Wednesday's race through the streets of Newhall was composed primarily of local 
runners and it showed in the results. 
</P>
<P>
Gone was the depth of a year ago when Samson Obwocha of Kenya ran 14 minutes 25 
seconds to defeat Alan Dehlinger (14:27) and Carmelo Rios (14:38), and seven 
runners broke 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Daren Stonerock, a 1986 graduate of Saugus High, easily won Wednesday's men's 
race in 15:02, but that time would have placed him 10th in last year's meet, 
which was run in much hotter conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Darcy Arreola of Nike Coast won the women's division in 16:39 and finished 10th 
overall. There were 643 official finishers. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a real good base yet," said Stonerock, who moved back to Saugus 
in January after an up-and-down 3 1/2-year stay at Northern Arizona University. 
"I'm still a long ways away from being in real good shape. Today, I just wanted 
to get out the first mile and see what would happen." 
</P>
<P>
After an initial mile in 4:41, Stonerock was all by himself a quarter-mile 
later, and he widened the gap to 200 yards at the finish. 
</P>
<P>
Peter De La Cerda, a 1989 graduate of Granada Hills High, placed second in 
15:36, followed by James Barbarudlo (15:38). 
</P>
<P>
The Canyon High trio of Dan Rattary (class of '87), Dan Berkeland (class of 
'90) and Dave Hartman (class of '91) were fourth through sixth in 15:39, 15:44 
and 15:47. 
</P>
<P>
Stonerock, who outkicked De La Cerda to win the Henry Mayo 5K in April, had an 
easier time Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really expecting De La Cerda to be close to me," Stonerock said. "I 
figured it might come down to a kick again." 
</P>
<P>
When it didn't, Stonerock simply concentrated on maintaining his pace. 
</P>
<P>
After leading Saugus High to Southern Section 3-A Division cross-country titles 
in 1984 and '85 (he won the individual title as a senior), the 22-year-old 
Stonerock finds himself at a crossroads in his career after leaving Northern 
Arizona because of what he termed a falling out with the coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm through with school," he said. "I just want to get back in really good 
shape again and get a sponsor. Right now, I'm running 50 miles a week. 
Hopefully, by September, I'll be up to 70." 
</P>
<P>
Arreola, who finished seventh in the 1,500 meters in The Athletics Congress 
Championships at Cerritos College last month, was never challenged in the 
women's division. She won by nearly three minutes while running her fastest 
5,000 road race. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to run under 16:40 so I'm pretty happy with the time," said Arreola, 
who redshirted this past collegiate track and field season at Cal State 
Northridge. "I wanted to run hard for the first mile and get a good workout in. 
I wasn't that serious. I came here just to run for fun." 
</P>
<P>
Arreola, the women's division winner last year in 16:50, timed 5:24 at the mile 
mark and 10:51 for two miles Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Her next race is the 1,500 in the U. S. Olympic Festival in Minneapolis (the 
track portion is from July 12-15), and then she will start focusing on her 
senior cross-country season, when Northridge will make its debut at the 
Division I level.

SAUGUS CROWD OF 6,134 WATCHES WINAKUR SCORE A SURPRISING VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Saugus Speedway staged a Fourth of July racing program Wednesday night, a 
special midweek departure from the normal Saturday night routine. And Rick 
Winakur of San Gabriel was in a holiday mood before an overflow crowd of 6,134. 
</P>
<P>
A regular in the Street Stock division at Saugus, Winakur decided on Sunday 
that he would dust off his 1969 Chevelle, a car that had gone unused for more 
than a year, and give the Hobby Stocks a try . 
</P>
<P>
"I just brought it out to play with it," Winakur said. 
</P>
<P>
He plays to win. Starting in the second position, Winakur took the lead from 
Oliver Aguilar of Sun Valley on Lap 3 and cruised unchallenged to victory in 
the 25-lap oval main event. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just fun, that's all it is," Winakur, 35, said. "If you'd have seen (the 
car) on Sunday . . . . I had to put it all back together." 
</P>
<P>
Winakur said that the car was last raced in June of 1989, providing quite a 
challenge in rebuilding. But rebuild Winakur did, begging a question: Will he 
race Hobby Stocks in the future? 
</P>
<P>
"No," Winakur said with a smile. "I'll still run Street Stock." 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar executed a strong pass of Bob Vigil of Lancaster on Turn 4 of the final 
lap to finish second. 
</P>
<P>
But Winakur wasn't through after that race. He doubled his fun by winning the 
15-lap Hobby Stock Figure-Eight main event, a race he won by attrition more 
than anything else. 
</P>
<P>
Kerry Mulligan of Granada Hills led early but pulled into the pits on Lap 3, 
giving up the lead to Richard Smith of Reseda. But after one lap Smith was 
forced to the back of the pack for failing to recognize a red flag. 
</P>
<P>
From there, Auggie Iannolo of Canoga Park took the lead and appeared to be 
headed for victory until Lap 15, when he slammed into Gerald Gledhill of 
Reseda, who had stalled. 
</P>
<P>
Winakur, who was racing in second, moved by for the win. James Kusch of 
Sepulveda took second, and Neil Conrad of Arcadia took third. 
</P>
<P>
"They gave it to me," Winakur said. "That was fun. That was a kick." 
</P>
<P>
In the most crowded Jalopy race of the year at Saugus -- 20 cars -- Smith 
blazed past Mulligan on the back straightaway of Lap 14 and ran away from the 
field to win the 15-lap oval main event. 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan had taken the lead with an aggressive pass of Jim Leighton of Woodland 
Hills on Lap 11, forcing Leighton off the track. But Mulligan's lead would last 
only three laps. Mulligan finished second while Jerry Carfley of Mission Hills 
took third. 
</P>
<P>
In the eight-lap Mini Stock main event, points standings leader Garrett Yamada 
of North Hollywood took advantage of a spin-out by leader Rock Ake Jr. of 
Moorpark on Lap 2 to take a lead he would never surrender. 
</P>
<P>
Rudy Sandoval of Van Nuys finished second and Jeff Walker of Newbury Park was 
third. 
</P>
<P>
The Hobby Stock oval fast-heat race was won by Ed Whitton of Lancaster, who 
started on the pole and led all the way. Conrad finished second. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Mike McAtee of North Hollywood started on the pole and was never 
passed to win the Hobby Stock Figure-Eight trophy dash. 
</P>
<P>
In the trophy dashes, Conrad won the Hobby Stock Figure Eight while Smith won 
the Jalopy dash. 
</P>
<P>
Shannon Flavin of West Hills won the Hobby Stock oval trophy dash and Ed Fuller 
of Carson won the Jalopy trophy dash.

It's official. John Walsh is a Carson Colt. 
</P>
<P>
The former West Torrance High quarterback checked into Carson High late last 
week and began practicing with his new team Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Carson Coach Gene Vollnogle said he met with Walsh over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"I just told him what we expected of him, as far as being a leader," Vollnogle 
said. "I would like him to take charge and not sit back. He was very receptive 
and very attentive. I think he's going to be fine." 
</P>
<P>
Like any transfer, Vollnogle said Walsh will have to earn the respect of 
Carson's players. 
</P>
<P>
"If a kid comes in and proves that he's an athlete, our kids accept him," 
Vollnogle said. "If he's not an athlete, then our kids ignore him. They were 
that way with Perry Klein." 
</P>
<P>
Klein, an All-L.A. City quarterback who transferred from Palisades to Carson in 
1988, proved himself by leading the Colts in passing and, in the process, 
helping them capture the City 4-A Division title. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Klein, though, it doesn't appear that Walsh will have to split time. In 
1988, Klein and Fred Gatlin alternated at quarterback after every series. 
</P>
<P>
Vollnogle said Tarriel Hopper, who was being groomed for the quarterback job, 
is more than willing to step aside and let Walsh run the show. Hopper, a 6-3, 
220-pound senior, is more accomplished as a strong safety, the position he 
played for Carson last season. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopper is not disappointed," Vollnogle said. "He would rather play another 
position. He will play quarterback if we need him, but he's not that 
enthusiastic about being a full-time quarterback. He prefers hitting people 
than being hit." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Hopper has been bothered by a nagging elbow injury to his right 
throwing arm. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he has some tendinitis in his elbow," Vollnogle said. "He's been off 
and on since spring football." 
</P>
<P>
It all adds up to a clear shot at the starting job for Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
Not only must West replace a quarterback, the school needs to come up with a 
new slogan for the back cover of its football program. 
</P>
<P>
"Once a Warrior, Always a Warrior" just doesn't cut it anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Obvious comparisons have been made between Walsh's transfer and that of Klein 
two years ago. There is one difference, however. 
</P>
<P>
Klein and his family talked openly to the media. So far, the Walshes have been 
tight-lipped about the quarterback's transfer. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it has something to do with reports that Walsh's parents are getting a 
divorce. Walsh apparently will live with his father in Carson. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Franklin's name has been mentioned as a possible replacement for 
Morningside girls' basketball Coach Frank Scott, who is expected to take an 
assistant coaching job with the USC women's team. 
</P>
<P>
But Franklin, the school's athletic director and co-coach of the boys' 
basketball team, said the reports are premature. 
</P>
<P>
"I would prefer to work with the boys," he said. "At this point, there are no 
changes in my plans." 
</P>
<P>
Although he announced to his team after last season that he probably would step 
down, Franklin said he might return as coach. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside should be encouraged after winning the L.A. Games football 
championship last weekend, but it's probably not wise to get too excited. 
</P>
<P>
North Torrance won the seven-on-seven passing tournament last year, then went 
2-8 in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
For the second year in a row, a South Bay wide receiver was named most valuable 
player of the tournament. Morningside's Arthur Washington, a 5-4 flanker, won 
the award after the Monarchs defeated Canyon of Santa Clarita, 27-20, in the 
final Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
North's Eric Hansen, the South Bay's all-time reception leader, was MVP last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
How good is Stais Boseman, Morningside's highly regarded sophomore guard? 
</P>
<P>
Co-Coach Ron Randle said he wouldn't be surprised if Boseman becomes the third 
Monarch to play in the NBA, following in the footsteps of Byron Scott and Elden 
Campbell, the rookie out of Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
"He's probably the most exciting sophomore in the state of California," Randle 
said. "If early indications are accurate, he's going to be awesome." 
</P>
<P>
The 6-3 Boseman is averaging 21 points a game for Morningside during the 
summer, and last week led the Monarchs to the semifinals of the L.A. Games. 
They lost to Long Beach Jordan, 41-39, Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Boseman, who can play either guard position, averaged 8.5 points a game last 
season as Morningside's sixth man. Randle said he expects Boseman to become the 
team's catalyst next season, filling the role vacated by Clemson recruit Tyrone 
Paul, the 1990 Times South Bay Player of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
"He's doing everything Tyrone was doing, and probably a little more," Randle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Boseman's talents are not limited to basketball. In addition, he plays wide 
receiver and defensive back on the football team. 
</P>
<P>
"We know he's a two-sport man," Randle said. "We hope we can utilize his 
talents and not burn him out. All things aside, he's probably going to be the 
best athlete Morningside has ever had." 
</P>
<P>
They're still saying the same things about Campbell, the Lakers' No. 1 draft 
choice, as they did when he starred at Morningside. Namely, that he lacks 
desire and the ability to consistently play hard. 
</P>
<P>
Randle argues that it's a misconception about the 6-11 center, who was 
nicknamed "Eze" in high school. 
</P>
<P>
"The stigma has stuck with him based on the perception of his style," Randle 
said. "He's not a high-fiver or someone who is going to get excited. He keeps 
everything in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite amazing for a lazy person to be the all-time leading scorer (at 
Clemson) and the blocked-shot leader in the ACC for three years in row." 
</P>
<P>
Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills is looking for a varsity water polo coach. Prior coaching 
experience is preferred. The season begins Aug. 20 and ends in November. 
Applicants should contact Chris Bowles at (213) 377-4888. . . . Torrance 
captured the girls' soccer championship at the L.A. Games with a 4-1 victory 
over Chaminade of West Hills Sunday. The Tartars' Kim Blankenship was named 
most valuable player. . . . Morningside won the girls' basketball title at the 
L.A. Games with a 61-47 victory over Buena. Janet Davis, the Lady Monarchs' 6-4 
junior center, was named to the all-tournament team. . . . Rolling Hills was 
the third South Bay team to capture an L.A. Games title, winning the softball 
championship with a 13-7 victory over Rubidoux of Riverside. Michelle Pfeiffer 
of the Titans was MVP.

WELCOME TO THE ENDLESS SUMMER OF BASKETBALL; 
</P>
<P>
PRESSURE IS ON PLAYERS TO SHOW BEST STUFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Looking as though he were sorting a pile of junk mail, Ryan Hickman sifted 
through the large stack of invitations to summer basketball camps he received 
in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"All of them said I had been selected as one of the top players in the country 
and they would be honored to have me," said Hickman, a 6-foot-6 forward who 
will be a senior at Fairfax High this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Hickman chose to play in two of those camps, Superstar in Santa Barbara and 
West Coast All-Star in Pomona, but that will represent only a small portion of 
his endless summer of basketball. He will also participate for Fairfax in 
various leagues and all-star tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
From late June until July 30th, Hickman -- and hundreds of players like him -- 
will compete in approximately 60 games -- twice as many as they will play 
during the regular three-month high school season. 
</P>
<P>
They know the growing importance of summertime basketball. A good showing will 
likely mean a scholarship to a prestigious basketball power. A poor showing 
could cost them one. 
</P>
<P>
Considered to be a touch slow by some college scouts, Hickman, a returning 
All-City player who averaged 15 points and 14 rebounds last season, wants to 
use this summer to remove any doubt about his speed. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe me, I know the stakes are high," he said. "It makes me a little 
nervous to think about it." 
</P>
<P>
Prior to the 1980s, there was little nerve-wracking about summer basketball. It 
was generally a low-key affair -- a time reserved for prep coaches to condition 
their teams and set rosters for the upcoming season. There were summer league 
games, scrimmages and an occasional tournament. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1983, when the NCAA adopted the early-signing period, things changed 
dramatically. High school seniors were permitted to sign letters of intent with 
colleges during a one-week period in November instead of the traditional April 
signing period. 
</P>
<P>
Since an estimated 80% of Division I prospects sign early, there is a frenzy 
for scouts to try and be everywhere and see everyone. College coaches are 
allowed to observe and evaluate high school players starting today through July 
31, a period crammed with camps and tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
"During that time, my two assistant coaches and I won't be home one night," 
Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury said. "We'll spend every second of the day watching 
kids play all over the country. We basically size up our whole recruiting class 
during this short amount of time, so we've got to try and be as thorough as 
possible. It's not easy, especially because we want to see our favorites two or 
three times. 
</P>
<P>
"The big problem with the whole system is that you have to evaluate how a 
player will fit into your system almost a whole year after you see him. You 
have to base a lot of what you see on potential. If a good player has a bad 
summer, he may not get looked at again. I'm not saying it's a fair system, but 
for right now that's the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine signed all of its players early this year, including Dana Jones of 
North Hollywood. Jones turned in a solid performance at the Las Vegas 
Invitational last summer and impressed Asbury. When he was offered a 
scholarship, he quickly signed. He went on to have a banner season with the 
Huskies, guiding them to the City Section 3-A Division championship. If he had 
held out, he probably could have signed with a bigger school. 
</P>
<P>
Such stories give Hickman and other borderline Division I prospects hope that 
if they don't knock 'em dead in the summer, they can come back and play well in 
the spring and still land a scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
The April signing period has turned out to be mostly a time for the top 
prospects to decide where to go to school. This year, All-American forwards 
Shon Tarver of Santa Clara and Ed O'Bannon of Artesia signed late, opting for 
Nevada Las Vegas. College coaches normally will hold a scholarship until the 
spring if a big-name player is interested. 
</P>
<P>
The trend of signing early bothers many high school coaches who have watched 
their players pick up bad habits over the summer while showing off for the 
scouts. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't encourage our kids to attend a lot of camps," St. Monica Coach Leo 
Klemm said. "I think our program is visible enough that the college coaches 
will come watch us play in high school tournaments. When you let a good player 
go to an all-star camp, the people who run them often take credit if the kid 
does well. But the high school coach is the one who has been spending years 
developing him." 
</P>
<P>
Klemm maintains tight control over his players during the summer. The Mariners 
practice once a week and play twice a week in high school summer leagues. They 
also will participate in five different local tournaments. If a player wants to 
attend a camp, he must clear it with Klemm. 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood Coach Steve Miller is less demanding of his players, having 
them play together only once a week. He encourages them to take needed time off 
to pursue other interests. 
</P>
<P>
"Summer is supposed to be a time to relax and enjoy yourself," Miller said. 
"When the kids are playing together everyday, they get tired and bored. They no 
longer are having fun or playing well, and I don't enjoy it either. No one 
comes out a winner." 
</P>
<P>
Miller has his team play together once a week so he doesn't lose complete 
control of it. He is well aware of the increased competition among local 
schools fighting for top players. If Miller gives his team the summer off, he 
takes a chance that a star recruit will get snatched up by a rival school that 
is playing. If he works his team too hard, he runs the risk of early burnout 
and apathy. 
</P>
<P>
On the other extreme is Crenshaw Coach Willie West, who has guided the Cougars 
to four state titles. Twelve years ago, West stopped having his team play 
together in summer leagues because he said opponents were going after them for 
blood every game. Since Crenshaw seldom loses during the season, rivals looked 
at the summer as a time of revenge. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I didn't practice my kids real hard in the summer, I didn't want other 
teams using that time as a barometer to see how they matched up with us," West 
said. "I decided there were enough other things going on in the summer that our 
players could stay busy. I know whether I keep them together or not that 
they'll be playing basketball somewhere. I want them to have some freedom and 
try other things if they so desire. Some have to work to make money." 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw's top returning player, guard Kevin Ollie, has found plenty of ways to 
keep busy. The 6-2 Ollie, generally regarded as one of the top five prospects 
in the state, is a member of the American Roundball Corp.'s Mid Valley team. 
Mid Valley, ARC's premier traveling all-star team, will play in tournaments 
across the country this summer, including the prestigious Las Vegas 
Invitational July 22-29. 
</P>
<P>
ARC is the largest youth basketball program in the country, with more than 
7,000 players nationwide. Founded 16 years ago by Rich Goldberg of Van Nuys, 
ARC operates year-round and has leagues in 32 cities. Most are in Southern 
California and feature some of the top local talent. 
</P>
<P>
To showcase its best teams, ARC will hold its own tournament July 14-18 at 
Artesia High. 
</P>
<P>
ARC's main rival for luring top local players is the Slam-'N-Jam league, 
started 11 years ago by Issy Washington. Slam-'N-Jam sponsors high school 
leagues in the spring, with 560 players on 52 teams this past year. In the 
summer, the league maintains several traveling all-star teams, with most of its 
players coming from South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave up on the summer leagues because the high school coaches were asking 
for more control of their kids," Washington said. "Things were getting so out 
of hand, that the high school coaches didn't want to lose total control. I want 
to maintain good relations with them, so I opted for other things." 
</P>
<P>
Slam-'N-Jam once again will hold a national tournament, with 44 teams competing 
July 14-19 at Cal State Long Beach. Last year, nearly every major college coach 
stopped by to watch. Teams come from as far away as Washington D.C. and Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
It costs players less to play for ARC or Slam-'N-Jam than to attend most camps. 
ARC's entry fee is $65, while Slam-'N-Jam charges $125, which includes a 
T-shirt and a pair of basketball shoes. ARC is sponsored by Nike and 
Slam-'N-Jam by Reebok, which help defray costs for gym rentals, coaches' 
salaries, insurance and traveling expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The premier event of the summer is the Nike Camp at Princeton, N.J., which 
starts Friday and ends July 11. This super bowl of summer camps is all-expenses 
paid and by invitation only for the top 120 prospects in 
</P>
<P>
the country. Last year, more than 600 college coaches attended. 
</P>
<P>
What's unique about the Nike Camp is that it emphasizes academics over 
basketball. Players spend seven hours a day in class and counseling sessions 
and only four hours a day practicing and playing basketball. If a player skips 
class, he is sent home. Players are tested for reading and arithmetic skills 
and spend much of their time reviewing for the Scholastic Aptitude Test. 
</P>
<P>
Local players who have been invited to the Nike Camp include Ollie, Cherokee 
Parks of Marina, Ray Owes of San Bernardino, Tes Whitlock of Loara and Chris 
Ford of Fremont. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Nike Camp started 12 years ago, those local players not fortunate 
enough to receive an invitation have usually attended the popular Superstar 
Camp in Santa Barbara. About 300 players and 200 college coaches are expected 
to attend this year's event, which starts Sunday and ends July 13. 
</P>
<P>
But the Superstar Camp faces new competition as the area's biggest and best 
camp. The first West Coast All-Star Camp will run today through Monday at Cal 
Poly Pomona. Sponsored by local basketball guru Dana Pump of Tarzana, the camp 
was sold out weeks ago with a limit of 260 players. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had people calling me around the clock asking if I could squeeze in one 
more person," said Pump, an assistant coach at Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
Pump said he sent out 350 invitations and the response was better than 
expected. He has plans for a bigger camp next year. 
</P>
<P>
But Pump said that things are getting out of control. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ridiculous," he said. "These guys are playing too many games. And if they 
do bad, it's over. But this is what the system has created, and everyone is 
trying to take advantage of it the best way they know how. More camps mean more 
exposure. And that's the name of the game right now." 
</P>
<P>
Basketball recruiting is such big business that Pump's twin brother, David, 
started his own scouting service four years ago. Called the "California Cage 
Report," the service rates the top players in the West, with California 
receiving emphasis. More than 150 colleges subscribe to the service. 
</P>
<P>
The report lists Parks as the No. 1 prospect. The 6-10 center also is 
considered one of the top five recruits in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the criticism, the current system does have its backers. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm one of the few who don't think its bad for guys to play as much as 
possible," said Harvey Kitani of Fairfax, who coached All-Americans Chris Mills 
(now playing at Arizona) and Sean Higgins (Michigan). "If a 14-year-old girl 
wants to be a concert pianist you don't discourage her from playing every day 
because you're worried she might burn out. The same thing is true with a 
basketball player. If they want to get better, why not let them play all the 
time? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's anything wrong with playing as much as you can, as long 
as you receive good guidance from your (high school) coach and your family. 
It's easy to get guided in the wrong direction during the summer, but not if 
you know what's right and what's wrong."

SAILING: U.S. CUTS THE FIELD AND COSTS FOR AMERICA'S CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The five syndicates eliminated last Friday from consideration for the America's 
Cup trials probably don't realize what a favor was done them by San Diego's 
America's Cup Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, the act smacked of the arrogance of the old days, when the New 
York Yacht Club was running the Cup. After watching the potential defenders 
sail a few races among themselves, the race committee, wearing traditional blue 
blazers, straw hats and red pants, would cruise over and politely inform a 
luckless skipper that he was excused from further competition. 
</P>
<P>
The late Tom Blackaller, who was inevitably excused, railed at the system, 
which was scrapped when the Royal Perth Yacht Club, as host of the 1986-87 
defense for Australia, switched to the innovative method of picking the 
survivors on victories and defeats. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Yacht Club never thought of that. 
</P>
<P>
The ACOC, which is managing the 1992 defense for the San Diego Yacht Club, 
simply refined the New York system by excusing apparent non-contenders before 
they could waste money they didn't have building boats they wouldn't sail as 
well as some others in the fight. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the old straw hats, red pants routine," said Tom Ehman, the ACOC 
chief. "This is a much sounder process. We've borrowed a page from both New 
York and Royal Perth." 
</P>
<P>
Ehman said he talked to Stan Reid, who was commodore of the Royal Perth during 
the '86-87 defense. 
</P>
<P>
"Stan said, 'You have significantly strengthened your defense. We should have 
done the same. And you've done the (five) a favor.' " 
</P>
<P>
Reid always felt that Australia's cause was hurt by allowing too many weak 
syndicates to clutter up the defense program for too long, diluting the 
competition and available sponsorship funds. 
</P>
<P>
Of the five excused syndicates -- Advance America, Betsy Ross, Christina, U.S. 
Women's and Yankee -- only two were able to meet the deadline for posting a 
$150,000 performance bond for programs that will cost about $15 million each. 
They also were asked to show evidence that they could raise $6 million to build 
boats by the end of the year. Some still lacked design plans or sailing 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
"But in the financial area, none of them had developed the $6-million 
capability," Ehman said. 
</P>
<P>
Ehman added: "I hope you'll print that each of the five was serious and spent a 
lot of time trying to make it happen. There weren't any T-shirt salesmen or 
shoe clerks." 
</P>
<P>
The four syndicates remaining -- Team Dennis Conner, (Peter) Isler Sailing 
International, Larry Klein's Triumph America and Beach Boys America -- will 
continue to share in the Partnership for America's Cup Technology (PACT) to cut 
costs for all by pooling research and design -- up to a point. 
</P>
<P>
The others seem to welcome the Beach Boys' involvement because it boosts 
attention for the event, and the pruning should reduce confusion among 
potential sponsors. Now they'll know that their money will at least be in the 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Ives, long a respected international racing judge, now merits respect as a 
sailor, as well. 
</P>
<P>
Ives, of Long Beach, swept the field in the recent Audi/North Sails Race Week. 
</P>
<P>
Sailing Ravage, his modified Newport 30 turned 33, he won Class G, along with 
the Quattro Trophy for winning the most competitive class, the Lydia Kent 
Trophy for the best family-sailed boat (minimum of three members) and led the 
Long Beach Yacht Club to the three-boat team trophy. 
</P>
<P>
Participants in the America's Cup who can legally represent more than one 
country will have to declare which nation they will represent in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Yacht Club board, acting as trustee of the America's Cup, has 
adopted a resolution requiring designers for 1992 to declare "as soon as 
possible after July 31" and skippers and crewmen to declare before the start of 
the challenger and defender elimination series. The resolution becomes part of 
America's Cup deed of gift and thus will be enforced in future regattas. 
</P>
<P>
Several potential participants in the '92 regatta, to be sailed off Point Loma, 
are citizens of one country but residents of another, and thus satisfy 
"conditions of nationality" required to represent both countries. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution allows participants to choose either country while assuring that 
each participant will be involved on behalf of only one national effort. 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Ulander, 20, of Costa Mesa, has been added to the U.S. sailing team in 
the Olympic Yachting Committee's program designed to fund and train the top 
five sailors in each class for the '92 Games at Barcelona. Ulander, a graduate 
of Newport Harbor High School who attends Connecticut College, won the spot 
recently by placing third in the new Europe dinghy class of the U.S. women's 
single-handed championships at Marblehead, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Although the America's Cup Organizing Committee has eliminated both women's 
syndicates from the defense competition, J.J. Isler says there are some 
individuals who would qualify as crew members. 
</P>
<P>
She is one, of course, but is going to concentrate on another Olympic campaign 
for '92. Two women who should be considered are Martha McKechnie, a regular in 
major events, and Dory Vogel, who was Isler's backup navigator with Dennis 
Conner in '87. 
</P>
<P>
There will be a crew weight limit of about 195 pounds per person in the new 
America's Cup class. "The teams are going to have to go with smaller people (to 
bring the average down)," Isler said. "The grinders will be bigger than that."

S&amp;L CRISIS AND HOTEL GLUT MEAN BUSINESS FOR FIRM; 
</P>
<P>
MANAGEMENT: A FIRM THAT SPECIALIZES IN HELPING TROUBLED HOTELS ON BEHALF OF 
BANKS AND THRIFTS HAS HAD A BIG INCREASE IN BUSINESS.

Just a couple of years ago, Bill Hoffman says he made a living running 
successful hotels for investors who cared more about making money than fluffing 
pillows. 
</P>
<P>
But these days, Hoffman, president of Trigild Corp., a San Diego-based hotel 
management and consulting firm, says he feels more like an "emergency room 
doctor" trying to keep afloat troubled hotels suffering from empty rooms -- 
casualties of over building and over financing that have occurred in the 
industry in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Lending institutions that made too many loans to marginally qualified investors 
have helped create a surplus of hotel rooms nationwide, industry experts say. 
The repercussions of such poor lending decisions and overbuilding are now being 
felt: an increasing number of hotels, plagued by high vacancy rates, are facing 
foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
The misfortune of such hotels, however, has led to a boom in business for 
Trigild and other hotel management and consulting firms. In a typical case, a 
lending institution will contract Trigild to keep a struggling hotel operating 
until new investors can be found for the property. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the bulk of Trigild and other consulting firms' work consisted of 
running hotels for their owners. But these days, lending institutions are often 
hotel management firms' most prominent clients. 
</P>
<P>
"Prior to 1988, financial institutions or troubled properties accounted for 
less than 10% of our business," Hoffman said. "Now 80% to 90% of the properties 
that we deal with have financial troubles, have been foreclosed, or are in the 
midst of a foreclosure action." 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Peerbolte, a CPA and principal with Laventhol &amp; Horwath, says he 
expects the pace of hotel downfalls to hasten in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been an awful lot of problem properties lately," Peerbolte said. 
"Business for (hotel management firms) started heating up three years ago and 
this last year it's really picked up for them, but they still haven't hit a 
peak." 
</P>
<P>
Although overbuilding has aggravated the industry's woes, Peerbolte said, the 
current savings and loan crisis has caused as much or even greater problems. 
</P>
<P>
"There are too many hotel rooms nationwide, but it's not a drastic situation at 
this point," Peerbolte said. "There are pockets of overbuilding in certain 
metropolitan areas, but I wouldn't be able to say that a certain city is 
completely overbuilt. 
</P>
<P>
"Overbuilding alone isn't what's causing the problem," Peerbolte said. "During 
the last five years there have been poor underwriting and poor lending 
decisions made by the S&amp;Ls. There was a lot of competition among the 
S&amp;Ls. They were all trying to grow quickly and took lots of risks without 
understanding the market." 
</P>
<P>
Peerbolte said marginally qualified investors lacked the capital to get a hotel 
up and running. 
</P>
<P>
"Most hotels shoot for 70% to 75% occupancy and that often takes three years," 
Peerbolte said. "You don't open the doors and instantly get a full house. You 
need cash to pay the debt while the property is trying to reach stabilization. 
These guys didn't have it." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago Hoffman said he recognized this emerging group of ailing hotels 
as a potentially lucrative niche market in the hotel management field. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw five times the number of companies seeking to run hotels for 
investors," Hoffman said. "There was a lot of price cutting. We were successful 
in that field, but we could clearly see the profit margin shrinking for 
everybody." 
</P>
<P>
So Trigild began marketing its services to lending institutions. That decision 
appears to be paying off: Trigild, a closely-held company, posted nearly $1 
million in revenues in 1989, up 15% over 1988. But this year, Hoffman said he 
expects revenues to double. Hoffman declined to release earnings but said the 
company is profitable. 
</P>
<P>
Trigild, which leases a 2,000-square-foot office in San Diego, has a staff of 
six hotel administrators who are dispatched to ailing hotels to take over 
marketing, accounting and operational duties. 
</P>
<P>
These trouble-shooters, however, stay at a particular site only long enough to 
assess the hotel's problems and then they move on. Often, they'll hire new 
personnel to carry out their plans. Trigild typically has 50 to 100 hotel 
employees on its payroll. 
</P>
<P>
Trigild is currently managing nine properties, ranging in size from 25 units to 
200 units, in California (8) and Arizona (1). The company receives a percentage 
of the hotel's sales for its managing services. 
</P>
<P>
Trigild begins its work at a troubled facility by establishing a priority list, 
said Hoffman, who is also president of the California Lodging Industry Assn., a 
1,000-member trade group consisting of the state's hotel owners and operators. 
</P>
<P>
"Why do we have two desk clerks when there is only a need for one? Can we move 
one of them to help out in marketing? Evaluating personnel and making sure the 
most critical needs are being addressed first are our priorities," Hoffman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Often, a hotel's long-term advertising campaign may be abandoned in favor of 
marketing strategies that produce immediate results. 
</P>
<P>
"What we want to know is, how can we sell rooms this weekend," Hoffman said. 
"There's a certain amount of gonzo marketing involved. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're dealing with a 100-room hotel and we're only filling 40 rooms, we 
might close down an entire wing," Hoffman said. "This way, we can save money by 
not running air conditioning in the closed wing. 
</P>
<P>
But sometimes, Hoffman said, one must spend money to make money. 
</P>
<P>
"At one hotel the previous manager got rid of the entertainment at the hotel 
bar when he started running out of money," he said. "We started it up again, 
cautiously, just on weekends, and that boosted the bar sales. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman concedes that such short term planning may not be the best way to 
improve a hotel in the long run, but says that's not important. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to keep in mind who our client is -- the lending institution," 
Hoffman said. "Sometimes they might direct us to spend some money and turn 
around a facility. But more often than not the bank's hoping to sell it 
tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
Last August, a San Diego savings and loan foreclosed on an 80-unit hotel in 
Palm Springs and hired Trigild to run the facility. 
</P>
<P>
"I ate dinner at the hotel restaurant and afterward had a chocolate cake," 
Hoffman said. "It tasted fishy." Upon inspection, Hoffman discovered that the 
hotel had been storing its chocolate cakes and its fish in the same 
refrigerator at an inappropriate temperature. The kitchen meat was also stored 
improperly. Trigild changed how the hotel receives, stores and handles its food 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want them to rehab the hotel, but we did want them to do the things 
necessary to run it as a safe and secure hotel," said a spokeswoman for the San 
Diego bank. "Trigild kept the property attractive and they definitely proved to 
be an asset in the sale." The bank just sold the property last week. 
</P>
<P>
Jo Ann Kruse, vice president loan administration at Mission Viejo National 
Bank, turned to Trigild when the bank foreclosed on a 22-unit motel in Borrego 
Springs. Trigild has handled the motel's day-to-day operations and personnel 
issues, including hiring a new general manger for the facility. 
</P>
<P>
"A bank is not in the business of running hotels," Kruse said. "Trigild has 
taken care of all the big and little things a manager would do. They've also 
helped us market the product. When there's somebody who's interested in 
purchasing the hotel we refer them to Trigild. They can talk about the hotel's 
occupancy rate and provide potential purchasers with pertinent financial 
information." 
</P>
<P>
Although fluent in hotel jargon these days, Hoffman says success in the hotel 
industry was pure accident. 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, Hoffman left Chicago and his "marginally profitable" wholesale graphic 
arts supply business and moved to San Diego. "I wanted to get away from the 
cold weather," Hoffman says. 
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival in San Diego, Hoffman decided to pursue a career in law and 
enrolled in Western State University. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when I met some people who were developing hotels," Hoffman said. "They 
had opened a Best Western in Del Mar and they asked me to fill in for the 
general manager who was ill. I knew absolutely nothing about the hotel 
business, but I doubled the net profit of the hotel in the first year that I 
managed it." 
</P>
<P>
Although Hoffman continued with his law studies, earned his law degree in 1974 
and is now an active member of the bar, success in the hotel industry spurred 
him to launch Trigild. 
</P>
<P>
When today's surplus hotel rooms are eventually absorbed in the marketplace, 
Hoffman says he expects his client base to shift back from lending institutions 
to investors. 
</P>
<P>
Working for both clients suits Hoffman just fine. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it's frustrating that you can't make everything a big success, but 
patching up a troubled hotel is satisfying in its own right," said Hoffman, 
referring to the short time he manages a property before a lending institution 
finds new owners. "I've got a couple of friends who are doctors, plastic 
surgeons. They help people look prettier and I'm sure that's satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'll bet those doctors who are in the emergency rooms, stopping the 
bleeding, find their jobs satisfying, too," Hoffman said. "We're emergency room 
doctors for hotels."

KENTUCKY FRIED CHANGES; 
</P>
<P>
ARCHITECTURE: IS THERE ANY REASON WHY ALL THE COLONEL'S CHICKEN EMPORIUMS 
SHOULD LOOK ALIKE? ONE OWNER THOUGHT NOT, SO HE HIRED A TEAM TO DESIGN 
SOMETHING RADICALLY DIFFERENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON, Whiteson is a Los Angeles architect and author whose latest 
book is The Watts Towers of Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Kentucky Fried Chicken franchisee Jack Wilke was looking for ways to 
update his 25-year-old Western Avenue restaurant, he decided on a radical move. 
</P>
<P>
"I challenged the notion that all KFC franchises should have the same standard 
design of fake mansard roofs (and) outsize Colonel Sanders bucket," Wilke said. 
"Why not do something radically different for a change?" 
</P>
<P>
Wilke, a noted local art collector, turned to architect Elyse Grinstein for 
help. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew Elyse from the art world, and liked the strong (Frank) Gehry influence 
in her work," Wilke said. "I turned the design over to her, and let her have 
her head." 
</P>
<P>
The result of Wilke's bold departure is the first architecturally avant-garde 
Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet in the United States, and the famous franchiser's 
first break with its own rigid formal tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by Jeffrey Daniels, Grinstein's partner in the Culver City-based firm 
of Grinstein/Daniels Inc., the Western Avenue KFC is an artful pileup of 
architectural play blocks in the Gehry manner. 
</P>
<P>
Situated on the corner of Western and Oakwood avenues, amid a typical L.A. 
strip of mini-malls and small stores backed by single-family houses, the new 
KFC is as radical in layout as style. 
</P>
<P>
To make room for a large parking lot and a drive-through window, the business 
is crammed into a two-story structure on the edge of Western Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Walk-in customers place their orders at the ground-floor counter and then march 
upstairs past a big picture window to an airy, high-ceilinged dining room lit 
by a large skylight. Here they wait for their food to be delivered by a 
dumbwaiter. 
</P>
<P>
The 50-seat dining room, lit by a big curving glass wall shaded by tapering 
solar fins, is the largest block in the KFC's architectural pileup. From there 
patrons may munch their dinners while watching the busy Western Avenue scene 
below. 
</P>
<P>
The bearded image of Col. Sanders with his black string tie beams down from a 
skewed perch on the topmost building block, signaling to the neighborhood that 
this strange structure is, indeed, the home of his popular finger-lickin' food. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to make the whole operation look as theatrical as possible," Daniels 
said. "From outside, passers-by can see customers climbing the stairs to the 
dining room or seated at their tables eating. From inside, patrons can watch 
the theater of the street." 
</P>
<P>
To emphasize the theatricality of the design, Daniels clad the building in a 
vivid mixture of materials. Light gray and green stucco and ribbed metal siding 
are capped by sloping zinc roofs painted in primary reds and blues. Exposed 
ventilation ducts and bright yellow balcony railings emphasize the makeshift 
muscular mannerism made famous -- or notorious -- by Gehry in such local 
landmarks as Santa Monica's Edgemar complex. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels says that the KFC's style is also inspired by the famed 1950s L.A. 
coffee shops that once dotted the urban landscape from the Sunset Strip to Long 
Beach. Known as the "Googie" style from the cafeteria chain of the same name, 
the coffee shops, with their dramatic, sweeping roofs, tilted glass walls and 
glittering neon design made Modernist architecture popular. 
</P>
<P>
"Jack (Wilke) wanted to do an updated Googie KFC," Daniels said, "but we 
convinced him to take it one step further and reinterpret the 1950s diner style 
in a more sophisticated 1990s idiom." 
</P>
<P>
Grinstein and Daniels have created several well-known upscale L.A. eateries, 
including the Chaya chain and the new Chaya Venice restaurant in the Venice 
Renaissance complex on Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
"All restaurants, whether posh or popular, are essentially a form of theater," 
Grinstein said. "People go out to dine to see and be seen, whether on Western 
Avenue or Main Street. We try to set the stage with appropriate scenarios that 
are dramatic without being intrusive, to achieve a balance between the private 
act of dining and the public act of people-watching." 
</P>
<P>
Known as L.A's architectural odd couple, Grinstein and Daniels have made a 
quiet reputation for their small practice since they formed a partnership in 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
Short and plump, Grinstein is a coiled spring of energy. She came to 
architecture late, receiving her degree from UCLA in 1978, 30 years after 
completing a degree in education at USC. 
</P>
<P>
A founding member of the Contemporary Arts Council and the Museum of 
Contemporary Art, she helped husband Stanley Grinstein establish the 
influential Gemini G.E.L. Fine Art Lithograph and Multiples Publisher, which 
mounted many shows that helped establish the reputation of several local 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
While working in Gehry's office, Grinstein met Daniels. A recent graduate of 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the sleepy-eyed, intense Daniels had 
also been a teaching assistant to noted Princeton Postmodernist Michael Graves 
and to architect Charles Moore at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"This tour of the masters of Postmodernism, from Gehry to Graves, gave me a 
lively sense of the possibilities of the style, with its ironic use of 
historical reference and Populist influences," Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
Grinstein sees architecture as "an art form with a function." She said she 
"reveres Frank (Gehry) but we have no wish be copycats. Our approach is less 
intrusive and more lighthearted, more like David Hockney's 'Splash!' paintings 
in sentiment and style." 
</P>
<P>
Grinstein and Daniels remodeled the British artist's Mulholland Drive hideaway, 
transforming a standard California Bungalow into what Grinstein describes as "a 
three-dimensional Hockney" with vivid primary colors, generous skylights and 
eccentrically angled walls and ceilings. 
</P>
<P>
The firm's distinctively urbane playfulness shines through more sober projects, 
such as the Mosauer apartment building in Van Nuys and the proposed Beach House 
Inn on Santa Monica's Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
The Beach House Inn design is enlivened by wraparound balconies and undulating 
glass-block walls. Together, they conjure up images of Caribbean seaside 
architecture and L.A.'s 1930s Streamline Moderne while fitting gracefully into 
the fashionable avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"The context in which one of our designs is set is always a major factor in the 
style of the building," Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
"In the Western Avenue KFC we honored the commonplace commercial vernacular of 
the surrounding strip and gave it both a literal and a figurative twist. 
</P>
<P>
"A formally graceful design, such as Chaya Venice, would have been too polite 
for the district, and wrong for a fast-food outlet. By accepting the jumbled 
architecture of the area and heightening its theatricality, we hope we've 
enhanced its attraction."

ART BUCHWALD: PUTTING MONEY ON INCUMBENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART BUCHWALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the most part, the main congressional political battles in November will be 
between the incumbents and the challengers. The smart money is on the 
incumbents, who are leading the challengers by odds of 8-to-1. 
</P>
<P>
I visited the training camp of Sen. Sang Froid, who is up for re-election and 
has victory written all over him. 
</P>
<P>
I talked to Artie Maytag, the senator's manager. 
</P>
<P>
"Your boy looks good," I told him. 
</P>
<P>
"We're taking this match seriously. We are asking every political action 
committee to double their contribution because we're tired of being known as 
the 'Filene's Basement' of the Senate." 
</P>
<P>
While we were talking, a man came up and gave Artie a satchel of bills. 
</P>
<P>
"The senator blesses you," Artie told him. Then he explained to me who the man 
was: 
</P>
<P>
"He represents the solid waste hubcap industry, and they consider Sang the best 
friend they have on the Hill." 
</P>
<P>
"Doesn't the lobbyist even get to go to a fund-raising dinner for that?" I 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Dinners went out with narrow lapels. Now it's cash on the barrel, and the 
donor goes to the cafeteria of his choice. Frankly, even at $1,000-a-plate, the 
food was never that good." 
</P>
<P>
A woman in a jogging suit ran by and stuck a check in Artie's pocket. 
</P>
<P>
"She's from the canned halibut industry. The senator chairs all the legislation 
on canned fish. I'm glad she gave because that saves me having to buy her 
breakfast." 
</P>
<P>
"Do the PACs ever distribute money to the challenger?" 
</P>
<P>
"Why should they? The senator is their man -- the special interests aren't 
going to waste their resources on an unknown rookie. This guy coming by now 
distributes all the funds for the fruitcake makers of America. 
</P>
<P>
He knows where Sang stands on fruitcake -- so when he dumps his cash in that 
waste-paper basket over there, he's betting on Sang making fruitcake the 
national dessert of the country." 
</P>
<P>
"The way things are going with the PACs it appears a challenger may never win 
an election." 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't know about that. My job is to make sure that those people who 
expect the senator to do favors for them when he gets elected do right by him 
now. You remember Harry Tudoroff, the lobbyist for the bubble-gum workers of 
America?" 
</P>
<P>
"I remember him, but I haven't seen him around," I replied. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason you haven't seen him around is because he split his PAC 
contributions during the last election between the senator and the challenger, 
and we kicked him out of our Boosters' Club. From then on, it was all downhill 
for him. When he couldn't even get his picture taken for National Bubble-Gum 
Day with Sang Froid, he wound up sleeping on a bench in Lafayette Park." 
</P>
<P>
A Brink's truck drove up and two guards started to unload the money. 
</P>
<P>
Artie said: "That's the savings and loans' contribution. They bring one over 
every day hoping the senator will bail them out." 
</P>
<P>
"Will he?" 
</P>
<P>
"The senator has always believed that, while making a few mistakes, the 
S&amp;Ls always had their hearts in the right place. They never said 'no' to us 
during their good times. So he's not going to turn his back on them now." 
</P>
<P>
"I wish there was some way I could help, but I really don't have any 
legislation I want passed." 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter. We take money from honest citizens, too."

TIGHT ON SPACE, MANY TURN GARAGES INTO EXTRA ROOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Santa Barbara to San Diego, garages are being turned inside out to make 
room for offices, wood shops, fitness centers, wine cellars, train stations, 
art studios and rehearsal halls -- everything, it seems, except automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
For example: 
</P>
<P>
* In Inglewood, former Compton College basketball coach Larry Square 
transformed his garage into a workroom/showroom for his custom-made trophies 
and awards. 
</P>
<P>
"If I get an idea for a new (trophy) design in the middle of the night, I can 
go right to work on it," says Square, whose garage features a full line of 
computer, typesetting and engraving equipment. 
</P>
<P>
* In Alhambra, longtime collector Robert Trepanier built a two-story garage to 
house his collection of junk, a passion for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
* In Anaheim, Jim Paschall, lead guitarist for Thunder Enlightening, a 
heavy-metal band, uses his garage to rehearse. Paschall, who drives a 
weather-worn Toyota pickup (parked outside), said, "If we rented a rehearsal 
studio for the weekend like a lot of bands, we couldn't produce the same sound 
quality that we get right here in the garage." 
</P>
<P>
* In Hacienda Heights, carpentry whiz Al Griffin makes rocking horses, 
playhouses and wooden toys for his seven grandchildren in his garage hobby 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
* In Fountain Valley, Rolf Franzke, a Santa Ana bikini manufacturer, says he 
has never parked his car in the garage, which is taken up with grinders, 
mashers, boilers and bottles for brewing beer. 
</P>
<P>
"If you just go to your house and sleep and pay taxes on it, then that cuts out 
living, doesn't it?" he said. "You need your garage for hobbies and other 
interests." 
</P>
<P>
Because it's rent-free, a garage may be the bright spot on the balance sheet of 
any start-up business venture. 
</P>
<P>
Dress designer Orsolina Massimino moonlighted by sewing, stitching and 
steam-ironing for private clients in her Pasadena garage. She gained the money 
and confidence to open her own bridal shop, True Romance, in the heart of the 
city's Old Town. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I could have gotten my business off the ground any other way," 
Massimino said. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Kellogg, a 32-year-old Pomona engineer, wants to make photography his 
new, full-time career, without going into debt. Last year, he converted his 
garage into a portrait studio and darkroom for $500, the price some studios 
charge for a single day's rental. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a photographer getting started, so I'm not making enough money to really 
afford a studio facility of my own," Kellogg said. "And renting one is rather 
expensive for the client. So for now, working out of my garage makes the most 
sense economically." 
</P>
<P>
A garage office can be a cozy and convenient arrangement. A Pasadena commercial 
and theatrical agent who requested anonymity said, "I got tired of driving to 
my office in West L.A. just to read the breakdowns (upcoming roles for actors 
and actresses) and talk on the phone all day. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't beat this operation for convenience," she added. 
</P>
<P>
But convenience has its trade-offs. 
</P>
<P>
To reach photographer Kellogg's studio garage, visitors must squeeze by two 
cars and a row of dented trash cans. Consequently, Kellogg worries about his 
professional image. 
</P>
<P>
"I do want to make it more presentable, and get some landscaping and stuff 
done," Kellogg said, "but the clients have absolutely no problem working in 
here, once they come in and see how well it's set up and everything. The proof 
is in my work." 
</P>
<P>
Adopted from the French word garer (meaning to shelter or dock a vessel), 
"garage" entered the English language about 1902, roughly two decades after the 
invention of the automobile. 
</P>
<P>
For the next 30 years, garages remained separate from the stables that 
sheltered the horses, chickens and goats, and detached from the main living 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1930s, Frank Lloyd Wright was among the first architects to convert the 
porte-cochere -- or carriage way -- into a carport. Others soon began 
integrating the carport and, later, the garage into the main structure of the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
"Attaching the garage to the house clearly had to do with the modernist's idea 
of functionalism," said Thomas Hines, an architectural historian at UCLA. "This 
included the idea of getting from the car to the house conveniently and 
quitely, especially in bad weather." 
</P>
<P>
The appetite of car-crazy Californians for larger garages threw a monkey wrench 
into the modernist concept of discipline, however. 
</P>
<P>
As the home's newly appointed "front entrance," the garage allows passers-by to 
examine the family laundry, garden tools and old refrigerators. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a side effect that was not really thought out," Hines said. 
</P>
<P>
But housing developers don't expect a return any time soon to smaller garages. 
</P>
<P>
"Homes with three-car garages outsell homes with two-car garages, and homes 
with the two-car garages outsell homes with one-car garages," said Chris Lyman, 
marketing director of Hughes Homes, a large residential builder in the San 
Gabriel Valley. "In fact, the one-car garage is just about extinct." 
</P>
<P>
But not even this corner of the world is without government regulation. Most 
local ordinances and building codes specify that a garage is meant to shelter 
the automobile. If a hobby or business supplants a car, cities often require 
covered parking to be provided elsewhere on the property. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, local laws typically state that a home-based hobby or business 
cannot significantly alter the structure of the garage, or change the 
residential character or air quality of the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
David Rutherford, a spokesman for the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District in El Monte, issued both praise and a caveat for businesses operating 
out of the garage. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly applaud the idea of a home-based business, especially if it 
contributes to eliminating the owner's 20- or 30-mile job commute each day," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"But then again, it depends on what the occupant is doing. If he's running a 
spray-paint operation and polluting the air in an unregulated atmosphere, we 
would certainly look down on that." 
</P>
<P>
City inspectors give chase to the most flagrant violators, acting on tips from 
neighbors, said Bill Russ, a code enforcement supervisor for the city of 
Pasadena for 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
"If a realtor tells you your house will be worth $10,000 more if all illegal 
activities cease next door, you might pick up the phone," said Russ, whose 
investigations have found pornographic film distributors and massage parlors 
operating out of garages. Other investigations have uncovered auto detailers, 
plumbing contractors, carpenters, hair cutters, white-water rafting agencies 
and lab researchers. 
</P>
<P>
Bootleg garage apartments are another target of enforcement in many cities. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have eight people living in a 900-square-foot home and two sleep in the 
garage, then we have a tendency to look the other way," Russ said. "But if we 
get enough complaints, then we have to enforce the law." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Domingo Sauceda, a chief investigator for the Los Angeles Building 
and Safety Department, cites the city's sensitivity toward those living in 
makeshift garage dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
"Most garage conversions involve family members -- a divorced grandmother 
moving in with a son or daughter, a student going to college, or even a 
retarded child who needs an extra room," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"All of these cases are tough on us, but we will enforce them -- especially 
where health and safety hazards pose a risk." 
</P>

Doug Eastwood of Pasadena, a retired flight engineer for the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory, reveals that "his baby" lives in his garage, a detached unit built 
around 1929. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't think about parking a 1963 Chevy in here," Eastwood said. "That's 
just another car to me. But this 1915 Sport Roadster Oldsmobile can have the 
run of the joint."

YOUR WHEELS: REASONS WHY YOUR ENGINE MIGHT BLOW ITS COOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Along with lazy days at the beach and smoky ribs on the grill, summer means 
overheated cars. If your car has a problem with its cooling system, chances are 
you are going to discover it as temperatures rise into the high 90s and while 
you are idling in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't seem fair that a car should overheat in the most uncomfortable 
situations, but that is the typical scenario. 
</P>
<P>
When temperatures recently soared to 112 in Los Angeles, emergency road calls 
logged by the Auto Club jumped 25% over normal. 
</P>
<P>
Cars are designed to operate in temperatures as high as 120, but such high heat 
stretches a car's cooling system to the limit, especially in stop-and-go 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
General Motors, for example, tests its cars in Death Valley, subjecting them to 
long hill climbs at temperatures well above 100 degrees, one of the most severe 
tests of a cooling system. 
</P>
<P>
While new cars may pass with ease, it is not unusual for things to go wrong 
with older cars under much less trying conditions. 
</P>
<P>
All cars are equipped with a temperature gauge or a temperature light. When the 
light comes on, or when the gauge needle enters a red warning zone, it means 
the engine is close to overheating and reaching the boiling point of the engine 
coolant. 
</P>
<P>
Most owners' manuals are not very clear on this point, but in hot weather the 
engine normally runs somewhat hotter than in cooler weather. Thus, if the 
temperature goes over 100, the temperature gauge is likely to move past its 
normal position. As long as the gauge does not pass the red line, the engine 
will not be damaged. 
</P>
<P>
This means that you have some time to react while the car overheats but before 
it boils over. If the gauge reaches the red line or the warning light comes on, 
turn off the air conditioning. If necessary, turn on the heater full blast to 
help cool the engine. You might melt, but that's better than being stranded 
roadside on a hot day. 
</P>
<P>
Most cars are water cooled, but they depend on a steady flow of air to cool the 
water in the radiator. As the outside temperature rises, it becomes more 
difficult for the radiator to shed heat. Idling in traffic makes things worse, 
because there is less air passing through the radiator. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, coolant runs at 220 to 240 degrees, well above the boiling point of 
water. Most cooling systems will not boil over until the coolant passes 260 
degrees, thanks to the antifreeze and the 15 pounds of pressure at which the 
systems normally operate. So you have a substantial margin before you encounter 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Why do cars overheat? If your car overheats, it is either low on coolant, the 
radiator is plugged with dirt, the engine fan is not operating properly, the 
thermostat is stuck, the radiator cap is not holding the correct pressure or 
the water pump is broken. 
</P>
<P>
If the problem crops up only on very hot days or while driving at freeway 
speeds, chances are the radiator is unable to handle the heat. It could be 
plugged. 
</P>
<P>
You can purchase a chemical radiator flush at most auto parts stores, but they 
seldom solve the problem. A radiator shop can disassemble the radiator and 
mechanically clean it for about half the replacement cost. 
</P>
<P>
A low coolant level means you have a leak that must be located and fixed. Water 
pumps usually operate properly or fail totally, so there is little question of 
whether they are at fault in overheating. 
</P>
<P>
If the car overheats only while idling in city traffic, the electric fan is 
probably not operating correctly, either because the motor is shot or the 
thermostatic switch is broken. 
</P>
<P>
By changing the antifreeze in your cooling system every year, you can help keep 
the system clean and avoid many of these problems.

LEGAL VIEW: A 'STANDARD CONTRACT' DOESN'T EXIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY S. KLEIN, Klein, an attorney and assistant to the publisher of The 
Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is no such thing as a standard contract. 
</P>
<P>
That may not be entirely true -- it is a bit exaggerated -- but it's worth 
saying, just to get a basic point across: All contracts are open to 
negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
So, when someone asks you to sign a written agreement, whether it is used for 
the purchase and financing of a new car or to rent an apartment, don't blithely 
sign it without reading it simply because someone tells you it is a "standard" 
or "boilerplate" contract. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, there are form agreements. You can walk into almost any stationary 
store and find any number of them, from promissory notes to commercial leases. 
And many industry associations have developed form contracts for particular 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the American Institute of Architects has a form agreement between 
a property owner and the contractor who is going to build a structure on the 
property. And many apartment owner associations have standardized agreements 
for their members to use with tenants. Even health club associations have form 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the provisions in form contracts are required by specific laws. There 
are a whole batch of provisions required in contracts for the sale of 
residential property. Health club agreements are regulated by state statute and 
must contain specific terms and warnings. In certain consumer contracts, state 
law even provides how large the type should be. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't mean that standard or form contracts are inviolable. Just 
because they appear on a printed form doesn't mean they can't be amended, 
revised or even thrown away and rewritten from scratch. After all, they are 
drafted by lawyers, and lawyers are in the business of negotiating and revising 
contracts to suit client objectives. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, form agreements are usually drafted by lawyers with a particular 
purpose in mind. A form rental lease agreement drafted by a lawyer for an 
apartment owners' group would look mighty different from one prepared by a 
lawyer for a tenants' rights group. They both would probably be perfectly 
legal, but they would be biased in favor of one side over the other. So, if you 
are signing a form agreement, you should try to find out who commissioned it in 
the first place, and which side they were on. 
</P>
<P>
And if you don't like the form agreement, you should try to change it. If the 
other party agrees, just scratch out the objectionable language and write it 
your way. Then each of you should initial the change. If there isn't space on 
the document, write the language you want on an attached piece of paper and say 
so on the printed form. 
</P>
<P>
But, whatever you do, even if you don't make changes, be sure to read the 
entire document, even if a salesperson keeps whispering in your ear: "Don't 
worry. It's all standard. Go ahead and sign."

A DAY IN THE PARK

Serrania Park 
</P>
<P>
20865 Wells Drive, Woodland Hills 
</P>
<P>
Size: 37 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Facilities: Child's play area, picnic area, circular half-mile walkway 
(unstaffed). 
</P>
<P>
Hours: Open until 10 p.m. daily. 
</P>
<P>
Information: District phone number, (818) 989-8190. 
</P>
<P>
Maintenance workers who keep the grounds at Serrania Park in Woodland Hills 
looking green and beautiful have a nickname for the area. They call it Parent 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is obvious to anyone who visits the park, which is secluded and has 
only five landscaped acres. (The other 32 consist of hills and mountains.) 
</P>
<P>
The park is shaped like an oblong rectangle, and steep hills and mountains make 
up three of its sides. The single opening to the park is a narrow area near the 
parking lot. Because of this design, Serrania is the perfect place for families 
with young children and even expectant parents. 
</P>
<P>
A paved walkway extends around the perimeter of the park and is used daily by 
stroller-pushing parents or pregnant women seeking exercise. A children's play 
area is in the center of the park about 50 yards from the parking area. 
</P>
<P>
Serrania Park is the only Los Angeles city park that is surrounded by steep 
hills and mountains instead of paved streets. For that reason, it is easy to 
keep track of children. KAREN KINGSBURY

ECONOMICAL HOME 'WORKOUTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN KINGSBURY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A series of 12 weekly gym classes for babies can run parents $100 or more, but 
there are less expensive ways to "work out" with your child at home. 
</P>
<P>
"There are literally hundreds of things you can do with your child at home to 
teach them that physical activity is a fun thing," said Jed Heller, owner and 
instructor at Jr. Gym in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Heller suggests that parents set aside a specific period each week, or several 
periods a week, to devote uninterrupted time to their child. If parents are 
interested in the social aspects of the activity, they should try to hook up 
with other parents who can meet at one house for class, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Simple stretches can involve moving the child's legs in a bicycling rotation 
and lifting the feet toward the face while the child is on his or her back. 
This encourages flexibility in the spine. Similar exercises can be done with 
the arms. 
</P>
<P>
"Children love this kind of thing, especially when their parents make a game 
out of it," Heller said. 
</P>
<P>
Other activities can be done with simple household items such as a broom handle 
or jump rope. A parent can encourage the child to grab the broom handle from 
either a sitting or standing position. The parent lifts the broom, letting the 
child hang a few inches off the ground. This is an activity that is better for 
babies 10 months and older than for younger infants, according to Adrian 
Becker, who operates several Gymboree outlets in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
A jump rope can be tied to two items and stretched several inches off the 
ground for toddlers to climb over and under. Babies can be lifted from one side 
to the other or held in their parents' arms while the parent hops over the 
rope. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important for parents to use their imagination and realize that their 
children need stimulation all the time," Heller said. "Even if their child is 
participating in an organized class at a gymnasium, it's still important for 
them to play with their babies at home." KAREN KINGSBURY

DISNEY'S KCAL COMES UNDER FIRE; 
</P>
<P>
MARKETING: STATION'S ADVERTISING PLOY TO GET ITSELF ON SANTA BARBARA CABLE 
SYSTEM HAS ANGERED MANY IN THE FIRE-RAVAGED AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some TV officials in fire-ravaged Santa Barbara are burning mad at Los Angeles 
station KCAL Channel 9 for using the tragedy there last week as a marketing 
ploy to boost its own fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
The Disney-owned station took out a full-page ad in the Santa Barbara 
News-Press on Monday that championed KCAL's coverage of the city's devastating 
fire and asked Santa Barbara residents to call their cable company to ask that 
KCAL be added to the programming lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Cox Cable, which carries the other six Los Angeles VHF stations on its Santa 
Barbara system, called the ad "unconscionable" and "offensive." And sources at 
KEYT Channel 3, Santa Barbara's only local television station, said that many 
in their community are outraged that KCAL would try to capitalize on the 
tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
After seeing the ad in her hometown paper, Sandra Benton, the general manager 
of KEYT, an ABC affiliate that supplied KCAL with coverage of the fire before 
KCAL was able to rush its own personnel and equipment some 90 miles up the 
coast, sent a letter to KCAL general manager Blake Byrne chastising his station 
for the marketing move. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, KCAL said that it would air one hour of the six-hour fire relief 
telethon that KEYT plans to broadcast Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Benton refused to speculate on whether KCAL's decision was an attempt to make 
up for a public relations blunder. But Bobbi Didier, director of public affairs 
at Cox Cable, saw it that way. "It's a nice effort, but it doesn't undo the 
damage they have already done," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the Independence Day holiday, executives at KCAL were unavailable 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The telethon, which is designed to raise money for the victims of the Santa 
Barbara fire, will air live on KEYT and on Cox cable's Telemundo Spanish 
channel from 6 p.m. to midnight. KCAL will air the final hour of the telethon. 
</P>
<P>
The story behind the KCAL ad actually begins several years ago, prior to 
Disney's purchase of the station in 1988. Cox officials, citing the fact that 
the station, then KHJ, was garnering very low ratings in the Santa Barbara 
area, dropped it from the cable system to make way for other channels. That 
effectively shut off any opportunity of Channel 9 reaching viewers in the city, 
where the mountainous terrain makes cable a necessity for most homes. 
</P>
<P>
Just two weeks ago, however, Cox sent a survey to its 61,000 subscribers, 
asking them to rate their current programming choices and to comment on a list 
of new options, including KCAL, that they might like to receive. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than waiting for the results of the survey or appealing to Cox directly, 
KCAL took matters into its own hands by buying the ad in Monday's Santa Barbara 
News-Press. The ad featured a group photo of nine anchors and other members of 
the Channel 9 news team alongside copy that read: "Last week Santa Barbara and 
much of Southern California experienced horribly tragic fires. KCAL-TV, 
California 9, covered all of these fires in depth with: live reports, 
helicopter coverage, frequent live cut-ins, and most importantly, three full 
hours of coverage in prime time, 8-11 p.m., where we have local news every week 
day. Unfortunately, you can't get California 9 on your cable system." 
</P>
<P>
It then asked readers to call the Cox general manager at a phone number listed 
in the ad to request "that KCAL-TV be added to your cable system. Because what 
you don't know . . . can hurt you." 
</P>
<P>
KCAL did not run ads about its fire coverage in Los Angeles area newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people see it as an inappropriate lobbying effort to get themselves back 
on the cable system," said a KEYT employee who did not want to be identified. 
"It looked like they were trying to capitalize on our tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Benton refused to say anything negative about KCAL 
for fear of jeopardizing its commitment to air one hour of Saturday's telethon. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thankful that they're going to run the telethon for whatever reason they 
are choosing to do it," she said. "I don't want to say anything that would hurt 
the good that might come out of that. We are so devastated and we are such a 
small community, everyone knows a friend or a co-worker here at the station who 
has lost their home." 
</P>
<P>
But Cox was pulling no punches. 
</P>
<P>
Since Disney bought the station, no one from KCAL or Disney has ever contacted 
Cox directly about their desire to be added to the system, Didier said. 
</P>
<P>
And to make matters worse, she said, the phone number that KCAL printed in the 
ad was not an administrative number, but Cox's customer service line, which was 
already swamped with calls from customers trying to get their cable service 
restored. Didier said that 16 1/2 miles of the cable system was destroyed by 
the fire, and that crews had been working around the clock to repair the 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
Giving out the customer service number to serve "their lust for profits," 
Didier said, resulted in unnecessary calls on a line already overburdened with 
requests for assistance from victims of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
"Forget about tasteless," she said. "The ad just continued to hurt Santa 
Barbara." 
</P>
<P>
As for the news coverage that KCAL claimed Santa Barbara viewers missed, KEYT 
news employees said that none of the Los Angeles stations were on the scene in 
time to get anything of their own on the air before about 10 p.m. the first 
evening, June 27. By that time, KEYT had already been supplying local residents 
with continuous coverage of the fire for 3 1/2 hours. The station stayed on the 
air with news from 6 p.m. to 3 a.m. KCAL finished its news reports at 11 p.m. 
Moreover, some of what KCAL aired from Santa Barbara was supplied by KEYT, 
which also shared videotape with KABC Channel 7 and KTTV Channel 11. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Santa Barbara News-Press on behalf of Cox, Didier wrote: "If 
KCAL is so interested in Santa Barbara, they should put their resources into 
helping our fire victims, not buying expensive and offensive ads." 
</P>
<P>
Will such feelings keep KCAL from getting back on the Cox cable lineup? 
</P>
<P>
"If our customers tell us they want it, we would provide it for them," Didier 
said. "But I think now it would be more difficult to grin and bear them."

STAGE WATCH: FUNDING DRAMA INTENSIFIES AT THEATRE CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Theatre Center's struggle for survival keeps getting longer -- 
while the patience of City Council members overseeing the struggle may be 
getting shorter. 
</P>
<P>
So it seemed at a meeting of the council's Community Redevelopment and Housing 
committee this week. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-member study group appointed by Mayor Tom Bradley to examine the future 
of LATC has extended its deadline by 30 days, now aiming for consensus by the 
end of September, Community Redevelopment Agency Administrator John Tuite said. 
</P>
<P>
In May, Tuite reported that the CRA, which has channeled more than $19 million 
into LATC, as part of the redevelopment of Spring Street, can't afford the $32 
million that LATC estimates will be needed over the next five years to maintain 
the LATC building, pay off its debts for moving into it and begin an endowment 
for continued support of the building. Bradley appointed the study group to 
figure out how to ensure the permanent survival of the building at 514 S. 
Spring St. as a theater facility, with or without the LATC. 
</P>
<P>
While the group conducts its study, LATC costs continue, and the CRA asked the 
council committee to approve another $750,000 in immediate support for the LATC 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
The committee voted 2-1 to recommend council approval of the $750,000. But this 
latest appropriation will keep the center open only through part of October, 
said Tuite, adding that it will take another $990,000 to keep the center 
running through the fall-winter season, which ends in late January. That amount 
includes $455,000 for a debt payment that he said was due in January. 
</P>
<P>
"When does the city decide to go into a detox center and stop this nonsense?" 
asked Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who cast the lone vote against LATC and who 
has long maintained that LATC takes too much of the total city arts budget, at 
the expense of other arts groups. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said LATC's recent estimate of $32 million needed over the next 
five years "finally shook the bejesus out of every arts group in this town. 
Now, I don't have to do much convincing any more." He didn't specify which arts 
groups were upset by the request and could not be reached for later comment. 
</P>
<P>
LATC Managing Director Robert Lear, separating the theater operation from the 
building in which it's housed, said the theater had a $486,000 surplus of 
revenue over expenses during the last fiscal year. LATC isn't "a theater that 
can't get its act together," said Lear, disputing one of Yaroslavsky's charges. 
Lear said that for Yaroslavsky to compare programming subsidies for other 
groups with support of LATC's building costs and debt service was like 
comparing "apples and pears." 
</P>
<P>
"We're not a bunch of dense North Carolinians here," responded Yaroslavsky, 
pointing out that LATC also receives programming subsidies from the L.A. 
Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
LATC has been recommended for a $68,000 grant in the next round of endowment 
awards, scheduled to be reviewed by the City Council Wednesday. Cultural 
Affairs Department General Manager Al Nodal, who oversees the city endowment, 
told the committee that LATC "got the highest rating" among theaters applying 
for the current round of grants. 
</P>
<P>
Committee chairwoman Gloria Molina voted to approve the $750,000 request but 
told the theater's spokesmen that "the council needs to understand what its 
commitment is going to be . . . your presentation is always weak." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Alatorre, the third committee member, who also voted to approve the 
request, observed that "the CRA made a commitment to (the redevelopment of) 
Spring Street, and it's not fair to single out the Theatre Center" by 
withdrawing support. 
</P>
<P>
STILL KICKING?: "A Chorus Line," which was scheduled to close at the Las Palmas 
Theater Sunday, has extended one more week in response to ticket sales 
generated by a twofer coupon offer in recent ads. That offer ends Saturday, but 
beginning Sunday the producers promise half-price tickets to anyone who 
displays a program or ticket stub from any production of "A Chorus Line." In 
other news from "A Chorus Line," Bebe Neuwirth -- a Tony winner for "Sweet 
Charity," but best known as Lilith on "Cheers" -- replaces Janet Eilber as 
Cassie beginning tonight. 
</P>
<P>
TALKING 'WILD': A symposium on Ibsen's "The Wild Duck" will be held at Los 
Angeles Theatre Center Saturday at 5 p.m. Participating will be the 
translators, Gerry Bamman and Irene B. Berman, and the director, Stein Winge, 
of LATC's production of the play, which opens next week, as well as City 
University of New York professor Marvin A. Carlson. USC theater dean Richard 
Toscan will moderate. Tickets are free, but reservations are required; call 
(213) 627-6500 Ext. 238. 
</P>
<P>
BENEFITS: A preview of "Bus Stop" tonight at the Pasadena Playhouse will 
benefit the playhouse and the California Lawyers for the Arts library fund. 
Information: (818) 356-PLAY . . . On July 14, at 8 p.m., is a benefit 
performance of "The Big Knife" for the new resident company at the Gene 
Dynarski Theatre in Hollywood. Information: (213) 466-1767.

THEATRICUM BOTANICUM PERFECT SETTING FOR A VERY GOOD 'DREAM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. H. McCULLOH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Theatricum Botanicum's wooded setting in a shaded vale is a perfect frame for 
most of Shakespeare's plays, but none more so than "A Midsummer Night's Dream," 
his comedy of young love at odds with itself. 
</P>
<P>
Titania and her fairies, and the thundering Oberon and his waggish Puck, can 
disappear behind a hillock and reappear moments later in a tree across the 
basin where the theater's basic stage sits. It's a magical spot for a magical 
play. This staging of what is probably Shakespeare's most produced play has its 
flaws, but also thrives on its joys. 
</P>
<P>
The flaws are dismissible. Some cross-gender casting is a little off-putting 
but at least doesn't get in the way. The company's director, Ellen Geer, 
alternates in the role of Oberon, Titania's male counterpart, and in spite of 
her well-spoken performance does not give the King of the Fairies the power and 
vibrancy he has to have. This Oberon is too softly effeminate to believably and 
effectively wage battle with Laura Wernette's striking, forceful Titania. 
</P>
<P>
The role of Puck, often essayed with varying levels of success by women, is 
played by the estimable Melora Marshall, but instead of exploding with joyous 
abandon she makes her Puck merely cute. He is not a forest trickster at all, 
and frequently fades unnoticed into the crowd of Titania's fairies. 
</P>
<P>
The casting and performances of the four young lovers are absolutely right. 
They are all attractive, even Helena, who's not supposed to be, and have an 
absolute ball cavorting through Shakespeare's romantic hoops, calling each 
other over vast distances, colliding among the trees. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Angelo is a comic angel of a Helena, and Victoria Hoffman's Hermia is as 
sweet and lovestruck as any Hermia ever was. But the bulk of the fun is in the 
hands of their stalwartly silly suitors, Cameron Bancroft's heroic but goofy 
Lysander, and Chambers Stevens' kinetic explosion of a Demetrius. The 
production belongs to them and Geer's conception of their flights of love. 
</P>
<P>
There are also some good comic moments from Alan Blumfield's Bottom (although 
he does slip into W. C. Fields when turned to an ass by Puck) and David 
Johnstone's Peter Quince, and the mechanicals' play within the play is not 
without its own few chuckles. 
</P>
<P>
This "Midsummer Night's Dream" has body and charm, but all is overshadowed by 
its foolish young lovers. And they, after all, are what the play is all about. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1419 N. Topanga Canyon Blvd., Topanga; Sundays, 4:30 p.m.; ends Sept. $11; 
(213) 455-3723.

TOP DIRECTORS JOIN NEW DRIVE TO OVERHAUL X 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK MATHEWS, TIMES FILM EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Barry Levinson, Spike Lee and John Sayles are among the prominent American 
directors whose names appear on a petition urging the Motion Picture Assn. of 
America to create a rating category that would allow adult-themed films to 
avoid the commercially poisoning X. 
</P>
<P>
The petition, urging MPAA President Jack Valenti to overhaul his 22-year-old 
ratings system "in order to more fairly reflect the original intent of the X," 
is being circulated by Silverlight Entertainment, a small New York distributor. 
Silverlight is currently handling Wayne Wang's "Life is Cheap . . .But Toilet 
Paper Is Expensive," set in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
The movie received an X this week from the MPAA's Sherman Oaks-based ratings 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
Silverlight President Mark Lipsky said he will appeal the decision at a hearing 
in New York on July 23. In the meantime Lipsky is asking movie directors to add 
their voices to a growing concern for the "erosion of artistic freedom" that he 
and others attribute to Valenti's refusal to recognize the pornographic 
connotation of the MPAA's X. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of pressure on the MPAA to change, and we want to contribute to 
the pressure," Lipsky said. "We want them to know there are mainstream 
important players in the industry who disagree with their practices." 
</P>
<P>
Lipsky said the ratings board would not specify on paper which scenes in Wang's 
film prompted its decision, but he said word "got to them" that to get an R 
rating Wang would have to remove scenes showing a magazine photo of a nude, 
pregnant woman, a scatological-humor scene and a recurring nightmare image of a 
man's arms being torn off. 
</P>
<P>
"They said the arms coming off are no good in a nightmare scene, but in ('Total 
Recall') Arnold Schwarzenegger is standing there holding two arms with blood 
gushing out of them, and that's OK," Lipsky said. "It's inconceivable that we 
got an X and that didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Also on the ratings front, Omega Entertainment announced late Tuesday that it 
will file a $15-million lawsuit against the MPAA because of the X rating given 
to its "In the Cold of the Night." Nico Mastorakis, Omega's chief executive 
officer, said he is planning to fund an independent ratings board paneled by 
major U.S. film critics. 
</P>
<P>
"If the moviegoing public is prepared to listen to film critics before going to 
the theaters, and if reviews mean so much for producers and distributors, then 
the critics' rating system will quickly supersede any other," Mastorakis said 
in a prepared statement released late Tuesday. "It is our duty to remove the ax 
from the hands of the executioner." 
</P>
<P>
Reached at his home in Los Angeles Wednesday, Mastorakis described "In the Cold 
of the Night" as a psychological thriller, and said he has refused to trim a 
"three-minute non-explicit love scene" in order to get an R rating. Mastorakis, 
who produced and directed "In the Cold of the Night," said he has sent 
videocassette copies of the movie to all 42 members of the National Society of 
Film Critics asking them to judge whether it is pornography or not. Next week, 
he said, he will begin talking to critics and other independent producers about 
creating a seven-member critics' rating panel. 
</P>
<P>
The MPAA could not be reached for comment on Wednesday.

'DEAL' RETURNS -- AT 3:30 A.M.

<TEXT>
<P>
"Let's Make a Deal," one of the most popular game shows in television history, 
is returning to the airwaves Monday with new episodes. 
</P>
<P>
But aside from insomniacs and people who remember to set their VCRs, few 
Southern Californians will be able to see the show. 
</P>
<P>
That's because KNBC Channel 4 has scheduled "Let's Make a Deal" for weekdays at 
3:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Most NBC affiliates will air the program at 10 a.m., but KNBC carries "House 
Party" at that time. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a financial commitment to 'House Party' through September. When that 
commitment expires, KNBC will move 'Let's Make a Deal' to the daytime lineup," 
KNBC spokeswoman Regina Miyamoto said. STEVEN HERBERT

BUDGET WOES TRIM BACK PLAN TO COUNT TREES; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: OFFICIALS SAY INVENTORY OF L.A.'S URBAN FOREST WILL HELP 
PRESERVATION EFFORTS, ALTHOUGH IT WILL COVER ONLY 60% OF THE TREES. THE PLAN IS 
NOT WITHOUT ITS CRITICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A street-by-street inventory of the city of Los Angeles' sprawling urban forest 
is set to begin later this month, but the tally has come under fire by some at 
City Hall for being too expensive and not inclusive enough. 
</P>
<P>
Horticulturists using hand-held computers are to canvass sidewalks and parkways 
in an ambitious effort to count and characterize the city's enormous street 
tree population, believed to be the largest in the country. Environmentalists 
and city maintenance officials say the inventory will help the city preserve 
and better manage the tree population. 
</P>
<P>
But because of budget cuts, city officials predict the 15-month survey will 
exclude San Pedro, Wilmington, Harbor City, Harbor Gateway and portions of the 
Westside and northeast Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Kennedy, the city's street tree superintendent, said the count should cover 
about 60% of the city's estimated 680,000 street trees, starting in the San 
Fernando Valley and moving south until money runs out. "We just don't have the 
funding to do the whole thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who represents the Harbor area, said the tally 
should be postponed until the city is in better financial shape to canvass all 
communities. She complained that areas left out of the survey may never be 
counted, meaning trees there may get less attention than those in other parts 
of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"If they can't do the whole city, then they shouldn't do any of the city," 
Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
She added: "The inventory is a good idea, but it is like dessert. We have a 
budget crunch. I question whether we have the luxury to count trees during a 
year when we are cutting the basics in the city." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Gloria Molina, who represents northeast Los Angeles, said she 
plans to challenge funding for the inventory during the council's annual budget 
review this month. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a good idea and a good goal, but it doesn't make sense when you don't 
have the money to carry it out completely," Molina said. "I would rather that 
we strengthen the city's tree-trimming capability before we start enumerating 
trees." 
</P>
<P>
The City Council allocated $500,000 for the tally in 1989 as part of a 
three-year $1.5-million funding plan. But this year's $500,000 allocation was 
eliminated during budget deliberations. Confronted with what officials called 
the tightest financial squeeze in years, the council imposed across-the-board 
spending cuts for most departments, imposed a package of tax increases and 
abandoned plans for 403 new police officers in the 1990-91 budget. 
</P>
<P>
"Next year, we are going to have an even worse year," said Flores, referring to 
warnings by economic consultants that the city's financial woes are not over. 
"I think it is more important to count police officers than it is to count 
trees at this point." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, however, said it is too late for the council to tinker with the 
$500,000 allocated last year for the tree inventory. The city's Board of Public 
Works awarded a contract in June to Irvine-based Golden Coast Environmental 
Services, which is charging the city $1 for each tree counted. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy defended the inventory as sound environmental planning. 
</P>
<P>
"We have major agreement in Los Angeles that our environment is a No. 1 issue, 
be it air quality or quality of life in general," he said. "I need to know how 
many trees are out there and how I can manage them so that we can keep them 
alive and healthy. They help clean the air, have a cooling effect and provide 
other direct benefits to everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Andy Lipkis, president of TreePeople, an environmental group that has pushed 
for the inventory, said delaying the survey could lead to further "destruction 
of the city's infrastructure" by putting off better care for the trees. Lipkis 
said a partial count is better than no count at all. 
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, we will pay, and we will pay more if we don't make the initial 
investment now," Lipkis said. "It is vital that it get started. Ultimately, we 
need the whole thing. But having 60% is better than having nothing, and maybe 
we can figure out a way to get the job finished." 
</P>
<P>
Golden Coast's roaming horticulturists are to punch into computers information 
about each tree's location, size, species, height, diameter, health and 
maintenance needs. They will also document vacant sites where trees have died 
or been removed, and make special note of trees with potential historic or 
cultural significance. 
</P>
<P>
The data then is to be used by the city's street tree division to set pruning 
schedules, make suggestions to communities interested in planting trees, 
replace troublesome and dangerous trees, and recommend trees as city landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the city spends about $12 million a year on street tree maintenance. 
Trees are trimmed on a seven-year cycle based on geography, not on the 
particular needs of species. With the database, city officials said they will 
be able to better dispatch their trimming crews and move away from "grid 
trimming," as the current system is called. Fruitless mulberry trees, for 
example, could be trimmed every three years, while magnolias, which require 
less care, could be trimmed on a 10-year cycle, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, you end up with some severe over-pruning of trees in order to have 
it last longer," Lipkis said. "What we have here is a mess, rather than a bunch 
of resources serving us." 
</P>
<P>
Cities across the country that have conducted inventories report that their 
street trees are healthier and are living longer, according to a spokesman for 
the American Forestry Assn., a nonprofit group based in Washington. In some 
cities, such as Milwaukee, street trees are living nearly twice as long as the 
national average of 32 years, said Gary Moll, the group's vice president of 
urban forestry. 
</P>
<P>
"It is real important," Moll said. "Trees produce all of their environmental 
benefits back to the city as they get bigger. The inventory helps you find out 
what the trees need and how to care for them so they do get bigger." 
</P>
<P>
West Hollywood, Redondo Beach and Santa Monica are among local cities that have 
conducted inventories over the past several years. Officials from all three 
cities described the surveys as important management tools. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not just the inventory, but the supporting software that is helpful," 
said Cyndy Holtz, landscape superintendent for West Hollywood, which conducted 
its survey last August. "For each tree in the city, the computer keeps a 
history. Any time we get a service request for a tree, we can use the computer 
to look at everything that has been done to it over the years." 
</P>
<P>
In Redondo Beach, the inventory identified 2,800 vacant street sites on which 
the city plans to plant trees over the next year, said Ken Dyer, superintendent 
of parks. Dyer said the computerized system has saved city officials hundreds 
of hours of time searching through tree-trimming files and records. 
</P>
<P>
But in Los Angeles, Molina predicted the computer technology will be of little 
use because the city does not have the money to provide more frequent or 
improved street tree services. She said the grid system, while imperfect, is 
the cheapest way to go. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, every tree on a certain street gets trimmed at the same time, and 
we barely can keep up with our tree-trimming schedule," Molina said. "To start 
identifying different trees and set up different schedules, I know is 
physically impossible for this bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said the tally will begin in the west San Fernando Valley because the 
valley contains "the bulk" of the city's trees and has a wide variety of 
species. 
</P>
<P>
Even that decision, however, has been challenged. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the reason we are doing this census is to see where is the imbalance," 
Flores said. "It seems they should start in the area where there are less 
trees."

SLAPP IN FACE FOR PROTESTING HOMEOWNERS; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: THE FORM OF LITIGATION, NOW BEING USED AGAINST A GROUP OBJECTING 
TO A HILLSIDE PROJECT, IS VIEWED AS INTIMIDATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH J. GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles homeowners group that has voiced objections over potential 
environmental hazards posed by the development of nearly two dozen hillside 
home sites above Beverly Hills is paying a price for its protests. 
</P>
<P>
The developer of the sites has filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against the 
North Beverly Drive-Franklin Canyon Homeowners Assn., claiming that the group 
broke an agreement not to delay the project. 
</P>
<P>
Association officers say the action, by R&amp;R Hillcrest Development Co., is 
the latest example in Los Angeles of a form of litigation referred to as a 
SLAPP, or Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation. They say the suits 
are being used increasingly across the country by builders to intimidate 
homeowners groups and discourage them from opposing development projects. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, a growing number of developers and public agencies have sued 
community activists when their building projects have been delayed. The suits 
usually allege nuisance, interference with economic advantage and abuse of the 
legal process. According to two University of Denver researchers, the average 
SLAPP asks for $9 million in damages and takes about three years before getting 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
In the Franklin Canyon case, the association fought a decision by the city of 
Los Angeles this year to waive a tract map requirement that would have allowed 
the builder to develop the Hillcrest Drive home sites without an environmental 
impact report. However, after the homeowners protested, the city attorney's 
office intervened and ruled that the planners' decision violated the California 
Environmental Quality Act and that a new tract map was needed. 
</P>
<P>
After city planners reversed their decision, the developer last month filed a 
lawsuit against the association and several former officers, alleging that the 
requests for additional environmental studies "were taken to stall . . . to 
block or defeat the proposed development." The developer is seeking unspecified 
damages, likely to be in the millions of dollars, alleging that the association 
breached a contract, committed fraud, misrepresented its intentions and cost 
Hillcrest nearly $2 million because of the delays. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a classic SLAPP suit in that it was done to silence them so the developer 
would have an easier time getting the project through the city," said Benjamin 
M. Reznik, an attorney for the association. "What the developer is saying is 
that asking for studies on traffic, geology and noise constitutes opposition. 
It's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
However, Jonathan R. Bloch, vice president of the development company, said the 
homeowners failed to abide by a written agreement not to oppose the project as 
long as they were provided with all planning documents and building permits. 
</P>
<P>
"It's regrettable that we've had to take this action," Bloch said. "Lawsuits 
and litigation are a last resort to us, but after working with them for over 
two years, we came to the conclusion that at least the board of the association 
is not proceeding with the agreement." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed development would include up to 22 lots, with most of the homes 
ranging between 5,000 and 10,000 square feet. Bloch declined to give any other 
specifics on the development, including the price. He described it as a 
"high-end, custom subdivision." 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners group has been negotiating with the owners of the property for 
nearly three years. The association entered into the agreement with Leland 
Hewitt, the original owner of the tract, in 1987. Under that plan, Hewitt would 
have graded about 100,000 cubic yards of dirt to accommodate 22 homes. The 
following year, however, R&amp;R Hillcrest bought the property from Hewitt, and 
the building company's top officers, Michael and Gene Rosenfeld, agreed to 
honor the contract if the homeowners association helped to expedite the 
development of the home sites. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Rosenfeld is a principal with the Anden Group, which recently received 
county approval for a highly controversial project to build 69 luxury homes in 
western Malibu. His father, Gene, is a former senior executive with Kaufman 
&amp; Broad. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Carter, president of the homeowners group, said Hillcrest's plan called 
for nearly five times as much grading as Hewitt's project and would have 
lowered some of the steep ridges by as much as 75 feet. Carter said that since 
the canyon area is prone to mudslides, the association wanted further geologic 
studies and a new subdivision tract map filed, because the old one was more 
than 65 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal all along was just to make sure that the development was 
environmentally safe," Carter said. "We've never tried to delay the project. We 
just believe that more studies are needed because safety is not negotiable." 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Mike Woo, who represents the area, agrees. Woo wrote a letter 
to the city's Department of Building and Safety requesting that the developer 
be required to conduct a full environmental review of the Franklin Canyon 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard some serious concerns raised by the neighbors about the unstable 
land conditions in that area," Woo said. "If a full environmental impact report 
found that there were no serious environmental consequences, then I believe I 
could support the project. But that is a major hurdle yet to be crossed." 
</P>
<P>
Bloch said Hillcrest intends to follow whatever requirements the city places on 
the proposed development, including further environmental studies. But, he 
said, the company has no intention of dropping its lawsuit against the 
homeowners association. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Reznik said the lawsuit is misguided. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the city that is not giving them what they want, not the homeowners," he 
said. "But the idea of a SLAPP suit is to intimidate the homeowners, even if 
the homeowners were right and justified in asking questions about the 
environmental impact of the project. And in this case, they were."

AFTERMATH OF THE COLLAPSE; 
</P>
<P>
NEW SITES FOR CLASSES, CONCERTS MUST BE FOUND AFTER LOSS OF MUSIC HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The collapse of a recital hall roof at Cal State Long Beach could touch off a 
scramble for rehearsal and lecture rooms for music students, and for off-campus 
locations to host scores of performances held annually at the facility, a 
college official said. 
</P>
<P>
The popular 8-year-old hall, known for its superb acoustics and intimate 
setting, was the centerpiece of the university's complex of music buildings on 
the north end of campus. 
</P>
<P>
"The big place it will hurt us is our orchestra recitals, and rehearsals," said 
Donald Para, chairman of the 325-student music department. "We have about 200 
events a year, between September and May, and now we will have to find ways to 
relocate. I'm sure we will have to move some to off-campus locations." 
</P>
<P>
Some music classes also may have to be dropped if officials can't find enough 
spare room for music students on campus, Para said. 
</P>
<P>
It is still not clear whether the Gerald R. Daniel Recital Hall must be 
demolished and rebuilt, or whether it can be rebuilt from the four walls that 
still stand, he said. But "whatever happens, it will be at least a year" before 
the hall can be used again, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The roof of the recital hall suddenly gave way Monday morning, sending 120 tons 
of concrete and steel crashing down on the seats and two grand pianos inside. 
The previous evening, a group of high school students had gathered for a 
rehearsal, but were ushered out when a sound engineer observed cracks in the 
plaster and heard strange creaks coming from the walls. 
</P>
<P>
No one was hurt when the roof collapsed, and officials closed other major 
buildings in the three-acre music complex. Campus officials said they were 
particularly worried about the structural integrity of two adjacent buildings 
constructed in the same "tilt-up" style as the recital hall, where the concrete 
walls are poured then hoisted into standing position. 
</P>
<P>
Para said that until the recital hall is reopened some classes will have to be 
moved to other parts of the campus or off-campus. A couple of classes may be 
canceled "because we will have no place to put the students," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some Long Beach faculty members said in interviews that they had been concerned 
about the quality of construction at the recital hall and other buildings in 
the complex. Faculty members said the roof leaked, even during the slightest 
rain, damaging musical equipment on several occasions. 
</P>
<P>
But the music practiced, perfected and performed at the recital hall made it a 
jewel among music lovers, and the showpiece of the university's eight-building 
music complex. The hall played host to hundreds of performances, ranging from 
jazz ensembles to string quartets. 
</P>
<P>
University President Curtis McCray said the stage was wider than it was long, 
so that everyone in the audience had a perfect view. The seating area, which 
could hold as many as 210 people, offered a more intimate setting because there 
were no aisles dividing the auditorium into sections. 
</P>
<P>
Music aficionados, on and off campus, lamented the loss. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very saddened. The entire community will suffer from the loss," said Mary 
Newkirk, the general manager of the Long Beach Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
"We will miss it," said Sandra Gibson, executive director of Public Corporation 
for the Arts, Long Beach's regional arts council. "The sound was quite 
exceptional and it was a beautiful building. It really was a wonderful place to 
hold an event. 
</P>
<P>
The Public Corporation for the Arts was the last organization to use the 
building, holding a recital and fund-raiser on June 23. The regular school year 
ended in mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Vail, a Cal State Long Beach graduate who has been teaching music at the 
school for 16 years, said the collapsed roof brings back memories of days 
before the recital hall was built, when music students were fighting with dance 
and theater students for time and space in which to practice. 
</P>
<P>
Students at the time were forced to give their dissertation recitals in Room 
127, a lecture room with nowhere near the acoustical quality of the hall, Vail 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the hall opened, it solved all of our problems for us," Vail said. "It 
gave us a home on campus. That's the tragedy of this. We have no place to go." 
</P>
<P>
The hall has been a major fixture in the University Music Center, which has 
offered just about everything a music major could desire on a campus: eight 
major buildings that include three rehearsal halls, a recording studio, an 
electronic music studio, practice rooms, a lecture hall and an instrument 
technician shop. 
</P>
<P>
The complex of red brick, wood, glass and exposed concrete buildings was 
dedicated in 1982, culminating more than a decade of lobbying. Then-Gov. Jerry 
Brown finally agreed in 1978 to free up $7 million to build the complex. 
</P>
<P>
Then-music department chairman Gerald Daniel, for whom the recital hall is 
named, and campus planning director Jon Regnier hurried to get the plans 
approved and the money for construction in hand. 
</P>
<P>
"Gerald and Jon worked hard to bring the plans into fruition," Vail said. "They 
were afraid some senator would say 'no' and the center would never be built." 
</P>
<P>
But there were no further delays, and construction soon began, according to 
university records. The center opened on April 25, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"It will have a quality about it that is conducive to the study of music," 
Daniel once said. "It is aesthetically so wonderful, I do not see how it can 
miss." 
</P>
<P>
When it was completed, the complex was trumpeted as a "milestone in the history 
of the arts, not only in Long Beach, but throughout the state of California." 
</P>
<P>
Campus officials at the time said they hoped that the University Music Center 
also would provide an important link between the community and the campus. In 
that it also succeeded, McCray said. "There was always a mix of campus and 
community people at the recitals," he said. 
</P>
<P>
University officials are now planning a $29-million performing arts center near 
the University Music Center, but Para said the performing arts building will 
not have a recital hall. There will be a 1,200 seat auditorium, but he said 
that will be used for many purposes, including dance, opera, and community 
events. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not at all a replacement to the recital hall," he said. "The recital 
hall was a venue for chamber and solo performances. It was intimate." 
</P>

WILDLIFE: THE YOUNG SEA LION INJURED BY A FISHING NET BECAME A CAUSE CELEBRE, 
THEN DISAPPEARED. NOW IT HAS RESURFACED OFF THE MALIBU PIER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A young California sea lion with a gill net slicing into its neck has returned 
to a small platform a quarter mile off the Malibu Pier, just when some 
observers were thinking it might be dead. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good to see him out there again," said Phil Campanella, owner of Malibu 
Pier Sportfishing. The injured sea lion was spotted last week after an almost 
two-month absence. 
</P>
<P>
Nicknamed Gilly, for the monofilament fisherman's net caught around its neck, 
the mammal, thought to be male and to weigh about 150 pounds, attracted 
widespread attention in February when a sportfisherman saw it on the platform, 
where anchovies used as fishing bait are stored. Gilly's plight became a cause 
celebre after a private rescue group launched a campaign to save it. Television 
and newspaper reporters dutifully swarmed to Malibu each time an attempt was 
made. But the young sea lion eluded its captors. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say that unless it can be rescued and the gill net removed, Gilly, 
estimated to be about 3 years old, eventually will choke to death. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really just a matter of time," said Judi Jones, director of Friends of 
the Sea Lion, a Laguna Beach group whose volunteers tried half a dozen times to 
rescue Gilly. "As the animal grows, the gill net will eventually cut off its 
circulation." A full-grown male sea lion weighs about 600 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Gilly's return to the platform, where it rests for much of the day, 
Jones said the group does not plan to try again. 
</P>
<P>
"We're out of the picture," she said. "We've done just about everything we know 
how to do, and I don't see us continuing to be involved." 
</P>
<P>
Observers speculate that a fisherman found the sea lion caught in his net and 
cut the monofilament plastic to free the animal. Remnants of the net are 
visible around Gilly's neck, giving the appearance of a collar. 
</P>
<P>
Gill-net fishing near shore is illegal in Santa Monica Bay from Malibu Point to 
Palos Verdes Point, but fish and game officials say the nets are used farther 
north by fishermen seeking halibut in the waters off Point Dume. An initiative 
to appear on the November ballot would ban the use of gill nets within three 
miles of shore throughout Southern California. Use of the nets is already 
largely restricted in the waters off the state's central and northern coasts. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say gill nets take a heavy toll among sea lions and other creatures 
off California's coast each year. 
</P>
<P>
"Just in the Malibu area alone, we have about 20 (dead) sea lions wash ashore 
each year, and many have been caught in gill nets," said Lt. Jack Campbell of 
Malibu Baywatch, the county agency that patrols the beaches. "What's unusual 
about this one is that he's alive, and he popped up at a particularly 
conspicuous location. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys (using gill nets) snag sea lions and dolphins and throw them back 
in the water. We retrieved an eight-foot dolphin last summer. And in January, 
we came across a 600-pound sea lion that was cut badly, but we couldn't catch 
it, and we never saw it again." 
</P>
<P>
Jones, whose group rescues four to six injured sea lions a year on Southern 
California beaches, acknowledged that its volunteers have never managed to 
capture one of the mammals at sea. 
</P>
<P>
"We've tried, just like we tried with this one. But if you're talking about a 
small platform surrounded by water, and they're mobile like this one, it's 
extremely tricky," she said. 
</P>
<P>
During the first rescue attempt in February, two volunteers went onto the 
platform, and twice waited for more than an hour before trying to throw a net 
around the animal. But each time, the sea lion slipped back into the choppy 
waters. 
</P>
<P>
Another time, two members of the group and two county animal control officers 
briefly got within a few feet of the sea lion, but just as they were about to 
try to drop a net over him, a small airplane flew low overhead, and Gilly again 
disappeared into the water. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Laguna Beach group, volunteers from the Marine Mammal Center in 
Santa Barbara have also tried to rescue the sea lion. 
</P>
<P>
"The second time the Santa Barbara people drove down here, Gilly didn't show 
up, and they haven't tried again," said Campanella, who has tried several 
rescue attempts on his own. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Dobyns, a county animal control volunteer and another of Gilly's advocates, 
said that though their hearts are in the right place, would-be rescuers lacked 
the expertise to capture the sea lion. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I'm afraid the attitude is, 'Out of sight, out of mind,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Gilly's supporters say they don't intend to give up. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll keep making phone calls, and try to interest someone in putting together 
a rescue until he's caught," Campanella said. "This may be only one sea lion, 
but when he's dying in front of you every day, it's hard to just look the other 
way."

$31.7-MILLION BUDGET OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council gave final approval to a $31.7-million operating budget for 
the fiscal year that began July 1. 
</P>
<P>
The budget includes about $650,000 in cuts that were made to make room for an 
expected $1.5-million drop in state funding next year. Hardest hit by the 
city's budget ax was the Public Works Department, which was eliminated to save 
more than $100,000. The City Council plans to trim an additional $750,000 from 
the 1991-92 budget.

COMMUNITY DIGEST: CERRITOS; 
</P>
<P>
$74.6-MILLION BUDGET IS UP $8.6 MILLION OVER LAST YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new fiscal budget in Cerritos is $8.6 million higher than last year's. 
Nevertheless, the city's approximately $20-million surplus is still intact and, 
overall, spending is still on a downward trend. 
</P>
<P>
This year's budget totals $74.6 million, in contrast to last year's $66 
million. The Redevelopment Agency's share this year is $42.2 million, compared 
to $35.8 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988-89, however, the city budget was about $90 million because the 
Redevelopment Agency was knee-deep in capital projects. Most of those are now 
complete. The biggest exception is the Community Arts Center, which is expected 
to cost $46.4 million by the time it is completed next year in the Cerritos 
Towne Center. 
</P>
<P>
When the council first authorized construction of the arts center three years 
ago, cost estimates were around $18 million. Since then, however, extensive 
architectural revisions have been made in order to allow the center to be used 
by community groups for meetings and other events.

SCOPE: CHILDREN'S SUMMER ENRICHMENT PROGRAM AT CERRITOS COLLEGE GROWS TO SERVE 
7,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
There was a chorus of crying from some of the small children taking their first 
plunge into one of the two outdoor pools at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Hernandez, 3, wanted no part of the water, despite reassurances from his 
swimming instructor and the presence of his father, Cesar Hernandez, of 
Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
In a nearby classroom, Tony Borriboonratana, 9, prepared to start his Basic 
Math II course. A fifth grade student at Wittmann Elementary School in the ABC 
Unified School District, Tony said the summer classes help him improve his 
grades during the regular school year. This is his second year. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, my mom made me come. Now, I have fun because I get good grades 
(during regular school)," the fifth-grade student said. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos and Tony are among an estimated 7,000 children attending the CARES 
(Cultural, Academic, Recreational, Enrichment, Science) program, which started 
June 25 and runs for six weeks on the 135-acre college campus in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
The college has sponsored the program, the largest of its kind in the area, for 
about 10 years, said coordinator Ilean Rabens. Participants range in age from 2 
to their teens. 
</P>
<P>
The self-supporting program is run by the college's Community Services 
Division, which provides a variety of non-credit courses for fees. Participants 
pay fees ranging from $22 for tennis lessons to $120 for a five-day field trip 
to the Santa Ana Zoo. Several hundred courses and activities are offered, 
including math and science classes, and violin, swimming, ballet and modeling 
lessons. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't make any money, but we fulfill the mission of the college, which is 
to serve the community, the entire family," Rabens said. 
</P>
<P>
College President Ernest A. Martinez said the program "is successful because it 
brings the community to the campus. Children are introduced to the college and 
we hope they will see it as part of their future." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said the program does not present any conflict with the regular 
college schedule since less than half of the college's 22,000 regular students 
attend summer classes. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 teachers, many of them from area high schools, are hired to teach 
more than 300 classes. Class sizes range from 10 to 15 students. 
</P>
<P>
The program is also popular with parents. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very pleased with the program's results. The classes are small. The 
teachers are enthusiastic and highly motivated," said Joyce Hunt, whose 
daughter Joi-Lin, 13, and son Randall, 11, attend math classes. And her 
children's grades have improved during the regular school year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
A substitute teacher, Hunt said she and her husband, an accountant, are willing 
to pay for the classes because the children's grades improve during the regular 
school session. The Paramount Unified School District in which the family 
lives, like most districts, does not offer these courses. 
</P>
<P>
"These are enrichment classes. We could only send them to our own district 
summer session if they were failing or needed credit," Hunt said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have enrichment programs. The state won't pay for them," Paramount 
Unified School District Supt. Richard B. Caldwell said. 
</P>
<P>
The program raised $368,000 last year. Officials expect nearly $400,000 in 
revenue this year. There is no profit because all of the money is used for 
expenses, officials said. The money is used to pay the salaries of the 
instructors, several registrars and purchase supplies.

RULES FOR WASTE FACILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council adopted an ordinance last week requiring all zoning, 
subdivision and land-use permits for hazardous-waste facilities to meet Los 
Angeles County specifications. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, the state Department of Health Services approved the county's 
new plan on hazardous-waste management. There are no hazardous-waste facilities 
operating in South El Monte, nor are any applying. City officials said the 
ordinance is a precaution.

COUNCIL CONSIDERS BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council this week began reviewing a proposed budget for the next 
fiscal year that includes $74 million to operate city departments, $15 million 
for redevelopment and $34 million in capital improvements. 
</P>
<P>
The capital budget is unusually large because the city plans to sell $17 
million in bonds to finance improvements to streets, the water system and other 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Elray H. Konkel, city finance director, said general fund revenue is expected 
to increase 3% to 3.5% this year. The increase would have been higher than 
that, Konkel said, but the City Council is committed to reducing the utility 
tax by $800,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed budget is for the fiscal year that began Sunday. The council 
received the budget from City Administrator Julio Fuentes at the end of May but 
did not begin reviewing it in study sessions until this week because some 
members have been absent. 
</P>
<P>
The city will operate at last year's spending levels until the new budget is 
adopted. The council is tentatively scheduled to consider the budget July 23.

SAN LUIS BARRIERS TO REMAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Temporary barricades installed on San Luis Street in April to discourage 
drive-by shootings will remain in place for another 90 days while residents 
consider other ways to deal with a gang problem. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council this week heard from residents on San Luis Street who wanted 
the barriers made permanent, and from residents on two neighboring streets who 
objected because of added traffic on their streets. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Bustos, who urged the temporary closure in April after a series of five 
drive-by shootings, said there have been no shootings since. "I'm for keeping 
the street closed because I feel safe," she said. But residents on adjacent San 
Rafael and San Felipe streets said it is impractical to close every street 
where shootings occur and that closures create traffic problems elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Robert DeLoach, city public works director, recommended against closing the 
street permanently because of the cost, estimated at $60,000, and the impact on 
other streets.

ACTION ON MEADOWPASS ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the city's last incomplete main thoroughfares moved a step closer to 
completion last week. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council tentatively approved a housing subdivision plan that includes 
right-of-way for an unfinished link of Meadowpass Road just south of Amar Road. 
</P>
<P>
But the council effectively put the plan on hold by delaying a vote on the 
developer's request to put two of the proposed eight houses on lots that do not 
meet minimum size requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendation from the Planning Commission was to deny the appeal, citing 
no extraordinary circumstances. The council voted to rehear the zoning issue at 
its Aug. 8 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
City planning officials say the completion of Meadowpass Road would alleviate 
traffic congestion along Pierre Road and Walnut Canyon Drive. But some 
residents say the reverse would be true, with more motorists gaining access to 
already-congested thoroughfares.

BEST BETS: OZ MEETS OJAI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tornadoes, wicked witches and a yellow brick road are not part of the everyday 
scenery in Ojai, but come Saturday they will be. The Illusions Theatre will 
bring "The Wizard of Oz" to the Libbey Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
A cast of 45 will adapt L. Frank Baum's fantasy as Dorothy and friends attempt 
to walk the yellow brick road and dodge the wrath of the Wicked Witch of the 
West. Director Elizabeth Ridenour said the play will hold true to the original 
story line. 
</P>
<P>
"We tell the story as it was written, pretty much. There are a couple 
variations. We have two lions, but the Scarecrow and Tin Man will be there, of 
course." Ridenour said the audiences will enjoy the production's special 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
Performances begin at 5 and 7 p.m. Saturdays and 5 p.m. Sundays, continuing 
through July 22. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets are $6; $3.50 for senior citizens and children 12 and under. 
</P>
<P>
The park is at Ojai Avenue between South Signal and South Montgomery streets.

LARGEST AUTOMATED LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The West Covina Library joined the Los Angeles County Public Library's 
automated system last week, making the county system the largest circulating 
library in the world. 
</P>
<P>
West Covina became the 90th library in the county to go on-line in the system. 
</P>
<P>
Library officials said the most unusual aspects of the project are its size and 
scope and the fact that it was completed in little over a year, after a decade 
of planning. 
</P>
<P>
County Librarian Sandra F. Reuben said a system of its size has never been 
automated without hardware or breakdown problems. 
</P>
<P>
The Automated Circulation System will allow the libraries to tailor their 
collections to the communities they serve, and patrons will be able to locate 
books and other information faster, Reuben said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, new library cards in use with the system will give patrons access 
to the 5-million-plus volume book collection at all 90 county libraries. 
</P>
<P>
"This whole project was designed to improve and enhance customer service," 
Reuben said. "We are in the business of satisfying the customer's need to know, 
and now we will be able to serve them more productively."

NEW CITY HALL FACADE OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Culver City Redevelopment Agency unanimously approved a plan to replicate 
the facade of the old City Hall for the city's new municipal building at an 
estimated cost of $300,000, substantially less than what it would cost to 
preserve the existing facade, as had been originally considered. 
</P>
<P>
After a slide presentation by Roger Cocke, principal of CHCG Architects Inc., 
in which the existing facade was superimposed onto the new architectural 
design, skeptical agency members were persuaded to approve the replicated 
facade, which will consist of a central arch flanked by two full open wings. 
</P>
<P>
The new facade will be made of concrete and stucco, and will be considerably 
lighter in weight than the original masonry version. By constructing a copy, 
the city also will be able to move the facade five to 10 feet back from the 
street at Duquesne Avenue and Culver Boulevard, making it possible to 
straighten the existing curve in Duquesne. 
</P>
<P>
The replicated facade will cost $300,000, Cocke said, compared with $800,000 to 
$1.25 million for saving the old one. 
</P>
<P>
The agency also voted Monday night to award a $95,900 contract for asbestos 
removal from the existing City Hall building to In-Tek Demolition and 
Environmental Services.

COUNCIL PASSES RESOLUTION BACKING ARTS ENDOWMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Long Beach City Council this week backed the National Endowment for the 
Arts and, in a resolution, urged Congress to resume the group's funding without 
any restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
The federally funded group has come under attack by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher 
(R-Lomita) and other critics who complain that the government is subsidizing 
pornographic works. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the arts have argued that Rohrabacher is in essence calling for 
censorship. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the council unanimously agreed that "the restrictive language 
approved by Congress in 1989 would have the effect of promoting censorship and 
inhibiting creativity at the expense of quality within the arts community, and 
gives Congress the power to micro-manage the endowment and define obscenity 
rather than the courts . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Tom Clark, who asked for the resolution, said that "Long Beach is 
supportive of the arts. I don't think that Long Beach is that conservative, 
although it has an aura of being conservative."

Workers have begun to repair stretches of asphalt and concrete at the

<P>
The work, which was authorized to maintain the building pending a decision on 
its eventual use, is not expected to cost more than $400,000.

Other work to be done on the mansion will include repairing the roof, doors and

As the work proceeds, efforts will continue to find a use for the building,

CINEMA PROJECT DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge John Zebrowski has ordered the city to make 
further environmental studies before allowing construction of a 12-screen 
cinema complex on Foothill Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The judge's decision is a victory for pharmacist Bob Mastro, head of the Small 
Town Preservation Committee, and three residents who sued to block a plan by 
Edwards Theatre Circuit Inc. to build a complex with nearly 3,000 seats. 
</P>
<P>
Theater opponents contend the project is too large and would bring crowds and 
traffic to La Verne. Their attorney, John Murdock, said the ruling will force 
the city to rescind its approval of the project. "It's a very significant 
victory for the people," Murdock said. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials say the theater would have no more seats than existing 
multiscreen complexes in Azusa and Montclair. City Manager Martin Lomeli said 
the judge apparently didn't understand the city's environmental analysis. 
Lomeli said the ruling doesn't mean the project is dead. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the lawsuit, the Small Town Preservation Committee is 
circulating petitions to put an initiative on the Nov. 6 ballot that would 
prohibit construction of theaters with more than 1,000 seats.

CITY MANAGER RESIGNS

</HEADLINE>

<P>
City Manager Charles R. Martin, 66, resigned last Thursday night after nearly 
17 years on the job. 
</P>
<P>
Alfred F. Herrera, Martin's longtime assistant, was named his permanent 
replacement. Herrera, 55, has served as acting city manager, including most of 
the last year while Martin recuperated from an illness. 
</P>
<P>
Martin will remain Irwindale city attorney and city clerk. On submitting his 
resignation to Irwindale Mayor Richard Chico, Martin said of his 
accomplishments as city manager: "Irwindale is on the map and has plenty of 
money."

REPERTORY CASTING CALL; 
</P>
<P>
WHAT PAY?; 
</P>
<P>
A THOUSAND OAKS-BASED TROUPE GETS AN ASSORTMENT OF ASPIRING ACTORS AND 
ACTRESSES FOR ITS TWO SHOWS.

They might have suspected there would be trouble when the Thousand Oaks-based 
Xanadu Theatre Company put out a notice of a casting call for two shows 
simultaneously -- Anthony Shaffer's "Sleuth" and John Bishop's "Musical Comedy 
Murders of 1940," now appearing in repertory at Cal Lutheran University. 
</P>
<P>
They were trying to save paper, the troupe's artistic director, Naomi Monroe, 
later explained, when they distributed a press release that read the "call is 
for males and females ages 25-60 . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Anybody even marginally familiar with either show would have realized that 
there is no music in "Musical Comedy Murders of 1940," and that there are no 
women in the cast of "Sleuth." 
</P>
<P>
But that didn't stop singers from expressing interest in auditioning for the 
Bishop farce, or -- even more amazingly -- more than one woman from asking to 
read for the Shaffer play. 
</P>
<P>
"It never ceases to amaze me," Michael Arndt, the director, said recently when 
reminded that several actors auditioning for "Musical Comedy Murders" had 
evidently never even heard of the play. "But the serious actors, the people I 
respect, have a sense of what's going on when they come to an audition. It just 
shows a level of professionalism." A 20-year veteran director and teacher, 
Arndt heads the Cal Lutheran drama department, and recently directed the 
university's excellent production of "Twelfth Night." He also works with the 
Xanadu group, and evidently sees putting up with a lack of preparation as part 
of his job. 
</P>
<P>
One night in May, Arndt and Monroe were looking over the prospects for the 
"Musical Comedy Murders of 1940" cast, and a disparate crowd it was. Some -- a 
few -- actually seemed aware of the play, a fairly recent off-Broadway 
production set in 1940. Most, though, didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been out of town," one honest -- or simply unimaginative -- prospective 
cast member said, "and only had about 2 1/2 minutes to read" the script. 
Compared with him, the fellow who had taken the time to track down a script at 
the public library a day earlier seemed as prepared as Sir Edmund Hillary was 
for his assault on Mt. Everest. 
</P>
<P>
Arndt seemed convinced he'd be able to cast the show's five female and five 
male roles that evening. As it turned out, he didn't. In fact, very few of 
those who showed up that night appear in the current production. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Bernath, who was slotted for a spot, was switched to a leading role in 
"Sleuth" during rehearsals and himself had to be replaced in "Musical Comedy 
Murders." Kevin P. Kern, a student of Arndt's at Cal Lutheran, had been called 
in to help read parts as would-be cast members played scenes; he wound up in a 
leading role. That in turn caused a leading female part to be recast: the 
highly capable actress who had won the part was judged too old to appear 
credibly opposite Kern. 
</P>
<P>
Some dropped out on their own. They, of course, never would have made the final 
cut under any circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
The play, a rapid-fire farce seemingly inspired by vintage comedies such as 
"The Man Who Came to Dinner," calls for a cast of 10 and a wide number of 
accents -- German, Italian, Irish and Swedish among them. This was news to most 
of the aspiring cast members, whose experience ranged from virtually nothing to 
that of a fellow who for 2 1/2 years played in the Broadway cast of 
"Beatlemania" and subsequently toured Canada and Japan with the show. 
</P>
<P>
One actor, new to Xanadu, impressed Arndt with his reading. It turns out that 
he'd already appeared in a production of "Musical Comedy Murders," in a 
respected Southern California company. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you have any reservations about playing a role you've played before?" asked 
Arndt. Too distinguished a gentleman to drool with anticipation, he 
nevertheless seemed delighted to have found an actor actually familiar with the 
role. 
</P>
<P>
There was a catch. The actor lives in North Hollywood, and the trip is a bit 
daunting. Especially when he discovered that the Xanadu players and backstage 
crew are in it for reasons other than money. In fact, there is no money. 
</P>
<P>
"Is there some sort of a stipend?" the actor inquired, "or even gas mileage?" 
</P>
<P>
"No," Arndt replied, with a sigh, "Not at this point." Still somewhat game for 
the part, the actor thought he might settle for exposure. "Do you get reviewed 
here?" he asked. "Newspapers? Drama-Logue?" he asked, referring to the 
Hollywood trade paper. 
</P>
<P>
Arndt made no promises. The actor decided that the investment of several weeks 
and several hundred round-trip miles wasn't worth the trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Others disagreed. Though most of the Xanadu players are from the Thousand Oaks 
area, one of the "Musical Comedy Murders of 1940" cast, Terry Miles, lives in 
Malibu; another, Henderson O'Neill, in faraway Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Arndt said that this is typical. "I've had actors commute from Redondo Beach, 
from Santa Barbara . . . driving an hour, an hour and a half each way. There 
are so many actors in Southern California vying for so few roles that it's 
worth driving the distance to be able to act. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether or not they have previous experience, actors really like the process 
of doing theater. Every time they perform, they're gathering skills. Also, 
there's that real, intangible aspect of what theater's all about -- there's 
nothing that can duplicate the feeling of being onstage, in front of an 
audience. In many cases, that is the pay."

L.A. PLANS TO EXPAND HOUSING FOR AIDS PATIENTS; 
</P>
<P>
SHELTER: OFFICIALS PROPOSE SPENDING AN ADDITIONAL $800,000 FOR HOSPICES AND A 
LOW-INCOME INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hoping to alleviate a crisis caused by lack of affordable housing for AIDS 
patients, city officials have proposed spending almost $800,000 on hospices and 
a low-income independent living center for those with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the three sites that have been designated to receive the proposed city 
funds are in Hollywood, and the third is in the Mid-City area. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Los Angeles city officials hope to provide up to $2 million this year 
for three much-needed types of residential programs for AIDS patients: hospice 
care for those near death, low-income apartments for those capable of caring 
for themselves, and shelter care for homeless people who have acquired immune 
deficiency, said Dave Johnson, the city's AIDS coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really the first time local government has taken a comprehensive 
approach to developing total residential care for people with AIDS, not just a 
piece of it," said Johnson. "If you don't have all the pieces in place, it is 
easy for people to fall through the cracks." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a gay man who has been infected with the AIDS virus, was appointed in 
May, 1989, by Mayor Tom Bradley to coordinate the city's response to the 
disease. Through his official position and contacts within the gay community, 
Johnson said, he has seen many AIDS patients impoverished by medical bills 
until they could not afford a place to stay. 
</P>
<P>
"We already have a crisis, and no matter what we do and how fast we do it, it 
is likely to get worse as AIDS cases increase considerably in the next few 
years," Johnson said. "AIDS certainly creates poverty and homelessness and 
makes existing poverty and homelessness worse." 
</P>
<P>
The problem is particularly catastrophic for AIDS patients with no health 
insurance, who must spend all their assets before becoming eligible for medical 
assistance, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The housing program now being proposed was developed after five hearings on the 
AIDS crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he knows of no other city -- not even New York, which has the most 
AIDS cases in the nation, or San Francisco, which has the highest rate of 
infection -- where such a comprehensive residential program is being proposed. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the program has widespread political and community support and 
that approval by the City Council "should be routine" when the first $1 million 
in funding comes up for a vote in the next two weeks. He said the additional $1 
million will be proposed within several months. 
</P>
<P>
The two Hollywood projects included in the proposal would be paid for by the 
city's Community Redvelopment Agency through its low- and moderate-income 
replacement housing trust fund, according to CRA Administrator John J. Tuite. 
</P>
<P>
One project, the City of Angels Hospice at 1302 N. Las Palmas Ave., would be 
expanded from six beds to 16, using $248,500 in CRA funds. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Rayl, activities director at the hospice, said there is a waiting list to 
get in. "There is certainly a continuing need for more beds," he said. "Our 
wish is that we could have (expanded) yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
Rayl said it would be at least six months before the expansion begins, 
regardless of when the funding is approved. 
</P>
<P>
Also, an eight-unit apartment complex at 4563 Fountain Ave. would be converted 
into housing for low-income AIDS patients who are able to care for themselves, 
using $330,800 in CRA funds. That project, a joint venture between AIDS Project 
L.A. and Christopher Street West, would provide apartments for seven people and 
a resident manager. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS patients "are living longer now, and are being sustained for longer 
periods of time," said David Smith, a spokesman for Christopher Street West, a 
nonprofit agency. "There is a dramatic need for this low-income housing for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Some zoning and parking issues need to be resolved, but CRA commissioners are 
expected to approve the funding for the two Hollywood projects without 
problems, said John Maguire, deputy CRA administrator for housing services. 
</P>
<P>
The third program being proposed is the 25-bed South Central Los Angeles 
Hospice at 2146 W. Adams Blvd., which would be operated by the AIDS Hospice 
Foundation, using $215,300 in Community Development Department funds. 
</P>
<P>
Still, officials say, the new city initiatives will fall far short of meeting 
the housing needs of AIDS patients. A strategic plan drawn up by the county 
estimates that at least 150 hospice beds are needed, as well as 300 shelter 
beds for homeless AIDS patients and 500 to 700 units of long-term housing for 
low-income AIDS patients, Johnson said.

HOSPITAL IN LONG BEACH TO AID ORANGE COUNTY; 
</P>
<P>
EMERGENCY CARE: MEMORIAL MEDICAL CENTER AGREES TO SHARE IN TREATMENT OF 
CRITICALLY INJURED FROM THE AREA.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County's beleaguered trauma hospital system received a major boost last 
week with the announcement that Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, already one 
of Los Angeles County's busiest trauma facilities, will assume a major role in 
caring for Orange County's critically injured patients. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Orange County's health care system had been working for more 
than six months to enlist a fourth hospital to replace Fountain Valley Regional 
Hospital and Medical Center, which dropped out of the trauma network in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a red-letter day for Orange County," Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder 
said at a press conference at the Long Beach hospital. "It's a perfect 
demonstration of the importance of regionalism in an area like emergency 
services. I won't talk about Orange County versus Los Angeles County; this is 
something that will serve the needs of both counties." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County health officials said they believe the addition of Memorial will 
improve the level and quality of services provided to trauma patients. 
</P>
<P>
The Fountain Valley hospital, for example, was not equipped to provide 
extensive neurological services that are needed by some critical-care patients. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach center, founded in 1907, is recognized as a premier provider of 
critical-care needs, with 998 beds, a helicopter ambulance service and an 
emergency room that treated 1,036 trauma patients in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Gayle Bullock, Memorial's senior vice president in charge of trauma services, 
said the agreement will strengthen the hospital's "informal" presence in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Bullock also said that many staff members at Memorial already have strong ties 
to Orange County, noting that she and the director of trauma services and chief 
of staff are all Orange County residents. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital now serves about 60 trauma patients per year from Orange County, 
but officials expect an increase of 200 to 250 patients per year once the 
formal arrangement becomes effective. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very interested in continuing to provide quality medical care to both 
counties, as well as fill a dire need for this important service in Orange 
County," Bullock said. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County health officials said the addition of the Long Beach facility 
will relieve much of the pressure on the county's three other trauma centers 
but does not totally alleviate the problem of providing emergency care for 
growing numbers of indigent patients in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"This eases the situation somewhat, but hospitals are still greatly 
under-compensated" for caring for poor patients, said Herbert Rosenzweig, 
director of Orange County's medical services. 
</P>
<P>
S. Russell Inglish, Orange County regional director of the Hospital Council of 
Southern California, said it remains to be seen what impact the addition of 
Memorial will have on the "patient mix" -- in other words whether more indigent 
patients, considered more costly to treat, will be routed there. 
</P>
<P>
"It begins to address the capacity problem, and somewhat addresses the 
financial problem," Inglish said. "I think it will have the effect of spreading 
poor and reduced-benefit patients around." 
</P>
<P>
The trauma network throughout Southern California has been battered in recent 
years as first one and then another hospital has dropped out of the system, 
citing the skyrocketing costs of treating indigent patients and maintaining 
medical malpractice insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County could once boast the largest trauma network in the country, 
but now only 13 of the original 23 hospitals remain in the system. 
</P>
<P>
The crisis has focused attention on Orange County because it adopted the first 
formal trauma care network in California in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Many health care advocates feared that Fountain Valley's closure -- two other 
trauma centers had also closed earlier -- would signal a virtual disintegration 
of the county's nationally known system. 
</P>
<P>
The closure did in fact have a profound impact on the three remaining trauma 
centers in Orange County: UCI Medical Center in Orange, Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana and Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
The volume of trauma patients treated at UCI Medical Center had increased from 
130 per month to 160 and at Western Medical Center from 90 patients to 120 per 
month, according to health officials. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Long Beach Memorial officials said they, too, had considered 
dropping out of the Los Angeles County trauma network because of the rising 
costs of treating indigent patients. 
</P>
<P>
That hospital, as well as others in the state, received some relief from the 
passage of Proposition 99, which provides millions of dollars for 
health-related issues. 
</P>
<P>
Bullock said the hospital also received more than $1 million in reimbursement 
funds for treating low-income patients and improved its fiscal management 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
By joining the Orange County network, he explained, his hospital is likely to 
receive a much higher percentage of patients who have private or prepaid 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
At the Long Beach hospital, indigent patients make up about 38% of trauma-care 
admissions, while in Los Angeles as a whole, roughly 50% of trauma-care 
patients are indigent. 
</P>
<P>
However, in Orange County, indigent care patients average only about 15% of 
admissions.

HOSPITAL TRIES OUT TINY DATA CARD

Beginning this month, cardiac patients participating in a pilot project at 
Methodist Hospital will be able to carry detailed medical records in their 
pockets, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Using optical recording technology -- the process of melting bits of 
information into a card with a laser that is similar to making compact audio 
discs -- each patient's wallet-sized card is able to store more than 800 pages 
of data. 
</P>
<P>
The information includes electrocardiograms, medications and risk factors such 
as cholesterol or hypertension levels. 
</P>
<P>
In emergencies, doctors will be able to save time by instantly calling up a 
patient's medical history on a computer. 
</P>
<P>
This will be the card's second hospital trial in the country, said spokeswoman 
Johanna Protsik of Drexler Technology Corp., the Mountain View, Calif., 
manufacturer of the LaserCard. The first trial is continuing at a clinic in 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the LaserCard unusual is its large capacity for information, said 
Stephan Seidman, publisher of trade magazine Smart Card Monthly. "It's the only 
card that'll carry that much information." 
</P>
<P>
Patients will pay $45 annually for the CardioCard, and a reader-writer and 
cardiology software package will cost hospitals $45,000. 
</P>
<P>
Heart patients who have undergone angioplasty, a procedure where a wire-like 
catheter is inserted into an artery to remove blockage, will be the first at 
Methodist eligible for the CardioCards, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just excited about what could be done for the patient," said Richard 
Carter, Methodist senior vice president of operations. If the trial proves 
successful, the program might become available to all patients at Methodist's 
62 hospitals nationwide, he said.

RESTAURANT REVIEW: MOONANGEL; 
</P>
<P>
TURKISH DELIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
TO GET INTO THE MIDDLE EASTERN MOOD, BEGIN WITH A PLATE OF ABRAHAM AYMELEK'S 
HOUSE SALADS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
This might be Casablanca. 
</P>
<P>
The guy who ushers you into the place is dressed in an ill-fitting, 
double-breasted gray suit over a black shirt. A lock of hair falls across his 
forehead. You are looking at the coffee and wine bar. And the language that you 
are listening to is French. 
</P>
<P>
No surprise, for Mustafa, who is usually behind that bar, is Moroccan. Combine 
the French conversation, the Moroccan barkeeper and the Brazilian having a 
drink, and what you end up with is a promisingly exotic flavor. 
</P>
<P>
But the mood doesn't last. The innocent white-tableclothed rooms that make up 
Moonangel -- Santa Barbara's new Turkish and Mediterranean restaurant -- 
quickly put an end to any thoughts of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. 
</P>
<P>
So does the food. For Abraham Aymelek, the owner-chef, is Turkish. And what he 
cooks comes mostly from the eastern end of the Mediterranean. So let's switch 
the fantasy to the Orient Express and Old Istanbul. 
</P>
<P>
One way of initiating the palate into the Middle Eastern mood is to order a 
plate of the house salads. This sampler has five selections; the standouts are 
the patlican salatasi -- an eggplant dish that is a mousselike combination of 
firmness and softness -- and the sweet and tart grape leaves stuffed with rice. 
</P>
<P>
Another standout is borek, the spinach pie that is found throughout the Middle 
East. These are usually individual pies, but Moonangel's is a wedge cut from a 
single large pie. The restaurant's version is made with feta cheese and served 
with hot hummus, the chickpea-based Middle Eastern staple. It has just the 
right kind of hang-together, cheesy consistency. 
</P>
<P>
The first time I tried Moonangel's borek, I was sitting at the wine/coffee bar 
-- a fortunate move, since I've since discovered that the service is better 
there than it is at the tables. Table service at Moonangel is . . . shall we 
say, lackluster? 
</P>
<P>
But Chef Aymelek is an ambitious, enthusiastic person who likes to come out on 
the floor to encourage his customers' appreciation of his cuisine. This 
includes, of course, the usual meat on skewers (marinated lamb or chicken), 
served with piles of pita bread. 
</P>
<P>
At dinner the dishes can be traditionally Turkish, such as mantarli kuzu, a 
lamb and mushroom stew that has came out of this kitchen more than once in an 
overcooked, dried-out state. Or they can be Mediterranean, such as the poached 
seafood blanketed in paper, which is steamed in a wine-based, seasoned broth 
and arrives very gently cooked. In this one, the chef is extremely generous 
with the shrimp, scallops and fish. 
</P>
<P>
Lunch is another matter. In my experience those bargain buffet lunches -- the 
kind that are generally advertised outside of restaurants on big cloth banners 
-- are best avoided. Moonangel is an exception. The buffet features about a 
dozen Middle Eastern salads and as many as five hot dishes, most of which 
change daily. On one afternoon there was a salad of cooked leeks and carrots in 
which the sweetness of the carrots merged with the tanginess of the leeks to 
create a distinctive effect. 
</P>
<P>
Middle Eastern desserts can be cloyingly sweet. Moonangel's are no exception. 
They are best eaten with the tiny, emphatic cups of coffee, which cut the 
sweetness. 
</P>
<P>
If you close your eyes as you sip this intense coffee, you almost imagine that 
you hear "As Time Goes By" playing in the background.

Following are some capsule re views of the better restaurants recently visited 
by our critics: 
</P>
<P>
* Neon beer signs and colored lights make Golden China restaurant look like a 
pizza parlor. But that's where the similarity ends. The two large dining rooms 
with carved wood panels, Oriental chairs and lantern light fixtures are a dead 
giveaway. 
</P>
<P>
So are the 113 Mandarin and Sichuan items on the menu, most of which are rich 
with garlic and ginger, and some very sweet. 
</P>
<P>
The mixed appetizers are served on a wooden platter with a fire pot burning in 
the middle. The resulting glow over the table is nice, as is the teriyaki beef 
on a stick and the paper-wrapped chicken pieces. Pot stickers are particularly 
delicious, with their flavorful sauce filled with chunks of garlic and ginger. 
</P>
<P>
Entrees are highlighted by the fresh red snapper covered with extremely spicy 
sauce and the shrimp in a basket of woven noodles, served with vegetables. 
Moo-shu pork passed with flying colors too -- paper-thin crepes overflowing 
with finely shredded pork and cabbage in a slightly smoky sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Golden China is located at 1105 South Seaward Ave., Ventura, 652-0688. Lunch 
and dinner are served 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily. Dinner for two, food only, 
$20-44. 
</P>
<P>
From the way the suns shines through the dining room, to the classical Mexican 
and Yucatan cuisine, Cafe Vallarta is a treat for the senses. The new menu 
includes such en trees as a calamari-stuffed chile relleno, a mild pollo 
almendrado and an award-winning caldo de mariscos (or bouillabaisse). The beer 
snacks, especially the cochinita pibil (pork cooked in banana leaves), are 
worth trying. Cafe Vallarta is located at 620 E. Haley St., Santa Barbara, 
564-8494. Dinner is served from 5 to 9:30 p.m. Tuesdays through Thursdays, and 
5 to 10 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays. The restaurant is closed Sundays and 
Mondays. Dinner for two, food only, $28-40. 
</P>
<P>
What's in a name? Everything, in the case of the Sea Fresh Restaurant. The 
owners have their own commercial fishing boat in Ventura Harbor and have the 
pick of fresh fish. Sushi is a house specialty and is offered as an entree or 
an appetizer. Particularly good is the yellowtail roll. Main dishes include a 
large selection of fish and chips, calamari and fish tacos. Sea Fresh 
Restaurant is located at 533 E. Ojai Ave., Ojai, 646-7747. Lunch and dinner are 
served 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Friday 
and Saturday. The sushi bar is open 5 to 9 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday, and 
5:30 to 9 p.m. Friday and Saturday. Dinner for two, food only, $11-$28. Nothing 
at the sushi bar is more than $3. 
</P>
<P>
Don't let the six-foot-wide storefront entrance to Chez Kim mislead you. Once 
inside, the place is like a French bistro. There is the intimacy, the simple 
menu and the hearty servings. But again, don't be fooled. The menu leans toward 
Italian. There are several types of fresh pasta in a coarse-textured pesto 
sauce. Among the other entrees are salmon fillet poached in white wine and 
served in a sauce of butter and dill, and filet mignon in cream sauce. Chez Kim 
is located at 420 E. Main St., Ventura, 648-7028. Dinner is served 5 to 9 p.m. 
Sunday through Thursday, 5 to 10 p.m. Friday and Saturday. Dinner for two, food 
only, $35-55. 
</P>
<P>
It may be hard to believe, but there is a place that serves pizza for both the 
trendy and the traditional. Avanti's menu offers plain old pepperoni pizza 
mixed in with the smoked salmon and cream cheese, basil and mozzarella and 
barbecued chicken versions. Entrees include broiled lamb with garlic and sherry 
sauce and pasta with a cream sauce of bay scallops, oyster mushrooms and bits 
of tomato and oregano. But leave room for the hot, fresh Italian bread called 
focaccia and the delicious desserts. Avanti is at 710 Ventura Ave., Oak View, 
649-9001. Lunch and dinner are served Wednesday through Monday, noon to 9 p.m. 
Dinner for two $15-40.

RIVALRIES ARE ALL IN FUN FOR KCRW FUND-RAISER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS ROMERO, COMMUNITY CORRESPONDENT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Usually, the only common ground for Los Angeles Dodger Tim Belcher and 
California Angel Kirk McCaskill is the pitcher's mound. 
</P>
<P>
But the two baseball players can be found making a pitch for the same station 
in a 60-second spot for Santa Monica's KCRW-FM (89.9) that began airing 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Other traditional rivals will also be speaking in unison for the Santa Monica 
College-based station as KCRW culminates a decade-long climb to become the 
second most-listened-to public station in the area. The station hopes to raise 
$300,000 from its audience with its two-month-long fund-raiser, "Summer Sign 
Up." 
</P>
<P>
KCRW's annual budget is about $2.5 million, making it one of the 10 largest 
budgets in public radio in the country, according to spokeswoman Sarah A. 
Spitz. Audience dollars are key, so fund-raising is an important part of the 
station's work, she said. "We're relentless in our fund-raising efforts," Spitz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The station has broken its own fund-raising records for three straight years, 
and during its primary annual fund-raiser in February, the station raised a 
record $860,000. 
</P>
<P>
The radio station that prides itself on its innovative programming also strives 
to be innovative in its fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
KCRW will offer a trip to Puerto Rico this summer, with the winner drawn from 
those who pledge and from station members. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the station offered to all supporters who pledged $85 a limousine 
tour of grave sites of the area's famous dead. They were given a 2 1/2-hour 
tour of "the stars' last stops," Spitz said. The gimmick, provided by a local 
company, helped the station garner $785,000 for the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, KCRW has also offered classes in beer brewing and tasting, 
courtesy of Father's Office pub in Santa Monica, and flight lessons, courtesy 
of Gunnell Aviation in Santa Monica. Also, during its winter fund-raisers, the 
station receives more than 600 gift certificates from local businesses to pass 
on as enticements for donations. 
</P>
<P>
Station officials said this summer's foes-in-agreement pitches were adopted 
from KQED public radio in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Palm Springs Mayor Sonny Bono and Santa Monica Mayor Dennis Zane also make a 
pitch for the station, despite clashing on the virtues of their respective 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're looking for a vacation spot, there's no place as perfect as Palm 
Springs. . . . " Bono says. 
</P>
<P>
Zane begs to differ. "I'll take our ocean breezes over your desert sun any 
day," he says. 
</P>
<P>
And then the dialogue gets personal. "Sonny, are you getting paid for this 
radio spot?" Zane asks. 
</P>
<P>
"Nope, I'm doing it pro bono." 
</P>
<P>
But the two agree on the virtues of the station's lauded mix of radio news, 
drama and alternative music. 
</P>
<P>
Others planning to promote the fund-raiser include Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Ira 
Reiner and Los Angeles County Public Defender Wilbur F. Littlefield, sports 
editors from UCLA's Daily Bruin and USC's Daily Trojan newspapers, 
representatives of Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream and Ben &amp; Jerry's Ice Cream 
("They melt our hearts," one station official said), representatives of Toyota 
and Nissan car distributors and the presidents of Unocal Corp. and Atlantic 
Richfield Co. 
</P>
<P>
Station officials say the fund-raising efforts have helped KCRW, whose 
listening audience ranks among the top four nationwide in size, become one of 
the top audience-supported public radio stations in the country. Listener 
dollars contribute to almost 75% of the station's budget. The rest of KCRW's 
funding comes from government grants and corporate donations. 
</P>
<P>
At cross-town rival KUSC-FM (91.5), the station with the largest public radio 
audience in the country, listener donations make up 55% of its budget, station 
officials said. At KQED in San Francisco, whose listening audience ranks in the 
top five nationwide, listener donations contribute to one-third of its budget, 
a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
One local station that beats KCRW for audience support -- although for fewer 
dollars -- is the No. 3 public-radio station in the area, KPFK-FM (90.7). Of 
its $850,000 in annual revenue, more than 80% is from listeners. The station 
does not accept corporate donations, said KPFK business manager Mary Fowler. 
</P>
<P>
Spitz attributes much of KCRW's fund-raising success to local businesses, 
which, in return for giving goods and services, get a short on-air thank you. 
"We couldn't do a subscription drive without the businesses that give us stuff 
-- no jive," Spitz said. 
</P>
<P>
The station also prides itself on having one of the lowest basic membership 
fees in the nation. Membership fees are minimum donations that public radio 
outlets ask in return for program guides and other mailings. The basic fee at 
KCRW is $25. At KUSC, KQED in San Francisco and WGBH in Boston, the basic fee 
is $35. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, KCRW has the most educated, upscale audience of any station in 
Southern California, according to the Florida-based Birch/Scharborough Research 
Corp. The research firm's winter demographics report shows that more than half 
of KCRW's audience has a family income of more than $50,000 a year. Almost 73% 
of the station's audience hold four-year or advanced college degrees. 
</P>
<P>
And, the audience is decidedly baby boomer, with an average age range of 25 to 
39, Spitz said. "They are an engaged, intelligent, upscale and involved 
audience," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The station's lauded programming doesn't hurt either. Its airing of National 
Public Radio's extensive news program, "All Things Considered," gives KCRW one 
of the eight-largest audiences of all stations in the area, AM or FM, during 
the highly competitive 5 p.m. drive-time hour, according to a 
Birch/Scharborough Research Corp. study. And kudos for programming include 
1989's best non-commercial radio station award, given by the College Media 
Journal, a nationally distributed media trade publication, and 1986's best 
radio station award by Los Angeles magazine. 
</P>
<P>
KCRW started in 1946 as a radio-skills training program at Santa Monica High 
School for local servicemen returning from World War II. It evolved to serve 
the community and moved to the campus of Santa Monica College, where, under the 
guidance of general manager Ruth Hirschman in 1978, it expanded to serve much 
of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Hirschman, who is credited for much of KCRW's success, has no grand design for 
the station's future, but says she sees radio as an experiment. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what we'll be like in the 1990s except that we'll change," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Stay tuned.

<P>
There was no time to spare. Roger Campbell, who had been awakened in the middle 
of the night, scrambled up the stairs of a Fillmore apartment building. 
Summoned by a woman in labor, he raced past his fellow firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
His intuition, not to mention his agility, paid off. 
</P>
<P>
"I went into a slide and caught the baby just as it was about to hit the 
floor," Campbell, 39, said. "The father was there, but he was freaked. He was 
useless." 
</P>
<P>
That was seven years ago and it was the first birth Campbell witnessed during 
his 17 years on the Fillmore Volunteer Fire Department. The second came this 
last May when another woman failed to make it to the hospital in time. The baby 
arrived just before the firefighters and, luckily, without any complications. 
</P>
<P>
So it goes for Campbell, who divides his time between answering emergency 
calls, helping decide the city's fate as a councilman and fixing cars. As one 
of 20 men on the volunteer force, he is known to drop everything when a voice 
on the radio squawks "Patrol 6." 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm on the phone with someone who doesn't know what I do, I just tell them 
I've got to go," he said "I don't do a lot of explaining." 
</P>
<P>
And calls seem to come at the most peculiar times. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, during a heated debate among City Council candidates, fire bells rang 
out while Campbell, vying for his first term in public office, was stating his 
case. He didn't want to miss out on the forum, but he also couldn't sit still 
knowing that a fire was threatening a nearby hill. 
</P>
<P>
Sensing his anguish, the audience fell silent then broke into laughter. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't end up going, because we soon learned it wasn't that big of a fire, 
but it was difficult for a few seconds," Campbell said. "It was a tough 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
As a newcomer to the City Council that year, Campbell skipped out on council 
meetings to fight fires and respond to traffic accidents. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm probably the only one who has gone to a fire in a suit and tie," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1911, Fillmore has received its fire protection from volunteers, 
residents who have agreed to be on call 24 hours a day. For the first few 
years, a couple of county firefighters lived at the station, which was then 
located across from Fillmore Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
When a fire broke out, the telephone operator would call the station and 
announce the location of the fire, and one of the firefighters would run 
outside and ring a big bell. In a town with only a few hundred citizens and a 
dozen or so fires a year, using a bell to beckon the volunteers worked fine. 
</P>
<P>
But as the town grew, the operation needed to expand. Three sirens were 
installed in town to notify volunteers of an emergency, Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
And when they blared, Campbell said, it seemed that the whole town poured out 
into the streets to see what direction the fire engine was headed. 
</P>
<P>
All this public attention backfired on Campbell, who decided once to run from 
his garage to the fire station a block away. Speeding past the opened doors and 
curious faces, Campbell saw a small dog in front of him and realized that he 
was going to have to step on the dog or tumble onto the sidewalk. He chose the 
latter. 
</P>
<P>
"I twisted my ankle, but with everybody watching, I was not about to start 
limping. I kept running, with tears in my eyes," he said. "I walked with a limp 
for a month afterwards." 
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1987, when the city began contracting for police service with 
the Ventura County Sheriff's Department, the town sirens were replaced with 
radios, which are carried by each volunteer. The city's "911" emergency calls 
are dispatched out of Ventura and relayed via radio. 
</P>
<P>
Like his father, George, who served on the volunteer force for 30 years, 
firefighting is a basic part of Campbell's life. In the showroom of his garage, 
he has set up the Fillmore Fire Museum, complete with the department's 1926 
fire engine, antique oxygen tanks, sirens and helmets. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Chief Pat Askren said the department relies heavily on Campbell's 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
"He's so busy that he's spread thin," said Askren, who is Campbell's 
brother-in-law. "But he's willing to drop everything when I need him. He's the 
one we really depend on." 
</P>
<P>
For his firefighting efforts, Campbell is paid $75 a month to cover the cost of 
cleaning his uniform, another $75 a month because he is an emergency medical 
technician and an additional $200 for his role as assistant fire chief. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds like a lot of money, but it isn't when you consider the time that 
goes into it," Campbell said. "Nobody does this for the money." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Fillmore couldn't afford to pay for full-time fire protection. It 
would run four to six times the amount of the department's $111,250 annual 
budget, said Mayor John Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even see where the monies would come from. We barely squeaked through 
with a balanced budget this year," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell is proud of the Fire Department, which received a 4 rating (on a scale 
of 1 to 10, with 1 being the best) from a private company that inspects fire 
departments for insurance rate-setting reasons. With an average response time 
of 2 1/2 minutes, they improved their 1975 score by two marks. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Haase, who has worked since 1974 in the building that houses the 
Fillmore Historical Museum, can't believe how quickly the firefighters assemble 
at the station on Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
"They used to blow the siren from City Hall and they would all come running. It 
amazed me how quickly the fellow would get on the truck and get started," Haase 
said. "Now that they do it by radio, I just hear a bunch of cars rushing up and 
see people jumping out. If it's a car fire, a house fire or a burnt pot of 
beans, they're ready. The department is probably one of the most, if not the 
most, important things in town." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell's wife said she's had to adjust to her husband's second career, which 
sometimes takes him away in the middle of dinner, a movie or a family 
gathering. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank goodness for microwave ovens. Now he doesn't have to have a cold 
dinner," Kathy Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
"I admire him and all the other guys," she said, turning serious. "They 
constantly put their lives on the line. Once in a awhile they need to be 
reminded that they're appreciated."

<P>
The other day our friend Randee came over to show off her new baby. After the 
requisite oohing and aahing, we asked her how she was doing. She burst into 
tears. We assumed it was a postpartum mood swing, but we were astounded to 
discover that the cause of her outburst was not sleep deprivation or feeding 
woes. It was fleas. 
</P>
<P>
Seems she'd bought her older child a puppy, an irresistible ball of fluff who, 
it turned out, had an equally irresistible flea population. 
</P>
<P>
My initial reaction was, why the tears? Just call an exterminator, or buy some 
of those flea bombs and zap everything in sight. But before I even opened my 
mouth I realized what a bad idea that was. We're all too environmentally aware 
these days to calmly accept the idea of bombarding the air with DDT and the 
like. As Randee was quick to point out, even the tiniest amounts of toxic bug 
killers are a threat to a newborn baby. 
</P>
<P>
What to do? My 12-year-old son provided the answer. He's a junior entomologist, 
with a room full of forbidding-looking specimens in jars and display cases. He 
had read in a bug club bulletin about a natural way to get rid of fleas and 
proceeded to demonstrate. 
</P>
<P>
First, he set out a shallow pan, like a baking pan, and filled it with water to 
which he added some liquid soap. Next to it he placed a goose-necked lamp, 
arranged so the light shone into the water. He explained that fleas are 
attracted by heat and light, and they can't swim when the surface tension of 
the water is broken by soap. 
</P>
<P>
By leaving his contraption in the middle of a flea-infested room at night, the 
bugs are attracted by the lamp, causing them to jump into the water and drown. 
</P>
<P>
Well, we were skeptical, but Randee was desperate, so she tried it. The next 
day, she called up to report that her first attempt resulted in a container 
full of dead fleas. By repeating the experiment for a week, she got the flea 
problem under control -- without having to bail out of the house. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another bug crisis broke out, this time in our kitchen, where 
someone (accusing fingers were pointed, but no guilty party was found) let a 
half-eaten peach rot behind the stove. By the time the offending peach had been 
found, the kitchen was full off fruit flies. 
</P>
<P>
Again my son came to the rescue, this time with a two-quart plastic soda bottle 
(the kind that looks as if a green or black bowl has been glued to the bottom) 
and a bread knife. He energetically sawed the bottle through the middle. When 
he was done, he poured some honey-water into the bottom half (he said any sweet 
liquid would do) and stuck the inverted top half, spout pointing downward, into 
the bottom half. 
</P>
<P>
This, he announced, was a fly trap. Sure enough, the next morning the thing was 
full of fruit flies. They had gone down the spout to get at the honey-water, 
and then couldn't figure out how to get out again. 
</P>
<P>
This set me to thinking. Without resorting to the disgusting rolls of flypaper 
that used to hang from people's ceilings when I was a kid, I figured there must 
be other ways to kill bugs without causing indoor pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Well, there are. Locally, feed stores, pet stores and some health food stores 
carry safer flea- and pest-control products for pets. 
</P>
<P>
Traditional flea collars are problematic, it turns out. They emit a gas that, 
when overused, can damage your pet's nervous system. And we throw away 50 
million annually, posing a long-term pollution risk to soil and water. Some 
hardware stores offer electric gizmos that zap bugs or repel them 
electronically. But the proud parent in me somehow prefers my son's Rube 
Goldberg bug machines. His bug club bulletin cited successful lab tests, but 
had no data on home use. 
</P>
<P>
All we know is it worked for us. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's bad news about the ozone layer (more damaged than we thought) 
indicted cleaning solutions along with the usual CFCs. And we already know 
about pesticides in the food supply. Our obsession with "powerful" products for 
banishing dirt and bugs now ironically threatens to louse up the air and land. 
</P>
<P>
My son's "brain intensive" bug killers -- using knowledge rather than nukes -- 
are, I hope, an example of a good new trend. Randee thinks so. She's an author, 
and she's now at work on a children's book: "Eco-Commando."

With a last dab of sunscreen and a swallow of water, they headed out. The path 
was wide enough to allow walking in twos or threes, and conversation blended 
with the sounds of the great outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Sierra Singles Sunday afternoon hike. This particular one wound 
nearly eight miles through Hobo Jungle and Emma Wood State Beach at the west 
end of Ventura County -- an excellent choice for a warm June day. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my favorite hike, especially when the tide is low and we can come back 
on the beach," said Jan Lewison of Ventura, the hike leader. She's been hiking 
every week for about 15 years and now leads outings once a month. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the outdoors and that was the main thing when I joined the Sierra 
Club," she said. "Now I'm interested in the environment too. I understand how 
precious it is and how we need to protect it." 
</P>
<P>
Maria Papalexis, also of Ventura, demonstrated her environmental concern by 
picking up cans and litter as she walked along. She also enjoys these hikes for 
the people she's met during her 12 years with the group. 
</P>
<P>
For Carole Virden of Oxnard, this was her first Sierra Singles outing, although 
she'd hiked locally once before with the Conejo group in the eastern part of 
the county. "I like roughing it," she said. "I get tired of the city and like 
to get into the country away from the traffic and congestion." 
</P>
<P>
Virden was pleased to spot a squirrel close by the path. The group also 
glimpsed a family of coots swimming on the Ventura River and stopped, too, to 
observe native flora -- ice plant, wild roses, poison oak and hemlock. 
</P>
<P>
Pausing under the shade of spreading Monterey cypress trees, Lewison explained 
to the 13 hikers how Hobo Jungle got its name. "During the '30s and '40s, the 
train used to stop in Ventura. So it was easy for the hobos to jump off there 
and come back in here. 
</P>
<P>
"There were plenty more trees then; you can see all the remnants of them. It 
was a wonderful place to stay. Then they'd just go back a few blocks and catch 
the train again," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Later, on the beach, the group listened to Steve Noll of Ventura share a bit 
more county history. "These are gun turrets from World War II. The Japanese did 
attack the mainland U.S. in World War II, just north of here in an oil field. 
</P>
<P>
"A submarine made it here and shelled the coast. It didn't do any damage but 
you can bet it really scared some people and they put these two gun turrets 
here and two more elsewhere," he said, noting how the cannon could rotate 360 
degrees on a track and fire a 95-pound projectile 14 miles, either toward the 
sea or inland. Now only the turrets remain. 
</P>
<P>
Not only the history of the area, but the geography, too, attracts some hikers. 
Les Kopel of Simi Valley was a geography major in college and enjoys tramping 
through various terrains. He also comes to meet people. 
</P>
<P>
"I've dated quite a few women I met through the Sierra Club," he said. "I spent 
a couple of years with one lady." He likes the singles club because everyone 
starts out with a common interest in the outdoors and that makes it easy to 
"kibitz and jabber." 
</P>
<P>
That's exactly what John Olson of Camarillo had in mind when he initiated 
Sierra Singles 15 years ago. He'd been hiking in Santa Barbara with a similar 
group but hated driving there. So he started a local club affiliated with the 
Sespe group of the Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
Activities are "our reason for being," Olson said of Sierra Singles. He noted 
that an outing usually attracts between 15 and 20 hikers from their mid-20s up 
to their 70s; most are single, but not all. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Condra and Carolyn Briggs of Ventura met on a Sierra Singles hike in 1986, 
when Condra was a hike leader and Briggs had just moved to the county from 
Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know a soul," she said. She chose to get involved with the Sierra 
Club because it "would get me outdoors and I'd get a little exercise; I'd get a 
chance to get acquainted with the geography of the area because I knew nothing 
of Ventura County and meet some people because I didn't know anyone. It seemed 
to fit the bill on several strokes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
On her first hike, she met "a tall, blond, beautiful man," whom she dated a 
short while. On her second, she met Dale, whom she married in 1988. They are 
expecting a baby this month. 
</P>
<P>
Thinking back on that first hike, she said: "I was impressed with Sierra 
Singles. It wasn't a meat-market scene. No guys coming on to you. People were 
friendly." She also enjoys seeing people she's met on hikes at concerts and 
other social events. "We have this connection," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Lately Briggs and Condra been doing less hiking. "I just don't move around as 
much," Briggs said, referring to her pregnancy. But they plan to get back into 
it soon. "The baby will go hiking. We have a sling and a backpack," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Will they continue Sierra Singles hikes? "Well," said Condra, "the baby is 
single." 
</P>
<P>
* WHERE AND WHEN: The Los Padres chapter of the Sierra Club has two groups 
within Ventura County: the Conejo (for information, 498-0958) and the Sespe 
(484-7721). Sierra Singles (482-0958) is an offshoot of the Sespe group. For an 
annual subscription to the monthly bulletin announcing hikes sponsored by all 
three of these groups plus information on Ventura County outings of the Angeles 
chapter from the Los Angeles area, send $10 to the Sespe, 2207 Derby St., 
Camarillo 93010-3307. Membership in the Sierra Club is not a prerequisite for 
participating in activities.

FOR THE KIDS: FAMILY NATURE NIGHTS; 
</P>

</P>
<P>
EVENING OUTINGS ARE DESIGNED TO PRY YOUNGSTERS AND PARENTS AWAY FROM THE 
TELEVISION.

<P>
On those long summer evenings the best show in Ventura isn't on television. 
It's outside -- under the stars, or maybe under the trees, where owls or other 
animals of the night might make an appearance. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura Department of Parks and Recreation is sponsoring a series of family 
nature nights designed to pry youngsters and their parents away from the 
television. 
</P>
<P>
The four Thursday outings, all from 7:30 to 9 p.m., are geared for the entire 
family and cost $5 per person or $12 for a family of three. Children must be 
accompanied by an adult. 
</P>
<P>
The first one, called "plant appeal," is scheduled today at Seaside Wilderness 
Park, adjacent to Emma Wood State Beach. The group will meet at Surfer's Point, 
and hike and explore along the Ventura River estuary, focusing on native 
plants, according to Sharol Nelson-Embry, a city recreation leader. 
</P>
<P>
Participants will learn what's edible -- and what's poisonous, such as poison 
oak and hemlock. 
</P>
<P>
They may sample New Zealand spinach that grows wild along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
Another edible plant is sea rocket, which has seed pods that resemble a rocket. 
</P>
<P>
Those in the group will learn how plants adapt to harsh coastal climates and 
hear Chumash legends. 
</P>
<P>
On July 12, nature buffs will meet in Arroyo Verde Park off Foothill Road for a 
program about raptors, such as owls and hawks. A specialist from the Raptor 
Rehabilitation and Release Program in Simi Valley will bring some birds for the 
group to see. 
</P>
<P>
He will talk about how the birds hunt and live in the wild, how their feet and 
eyes are specially adapted for their way of life. The group also will look for 
owls and hawks. 
</P>
<P>
On July 19, the group will meet at Dennison Park in Ojai for an evening of star 
gazing. Santa Barbara author Ernest Underhay will talk about astronomy -- 
stars, meteors and constellations -- and Chumash Indian legends. 
</P>
<P>
The last outing, July 26, will be at Seaside Wilderness Park. Participants will 
explore the park, looking for raccoons, skunks and rodents. They will look for 
traces of the animals -- tracks, droppings or nibbled plants. They'll also keep 
an eye out for dolphins, seals and whales. 
</P>
<P>
* WHERE AND WHEN: Participants may register on the day of the outings or before 
at the Ventura Park and Recreation Department, Room 226, City Hall, 501 Poli 
St. Or they can register by phone using a credit card. Call 658-4726.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: DOES IT MATTER IF WOMEN AREN'T INTO PHYSICS? 
WELL, YES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it comes to the vexing topic of women, most scientists and engineers rely 
heavily on Sigmund Freud and Henry Higgins for inspiration. Dr. Freud's 
question, "What do women want?!" and Prof. Higgins' lament, "Why can't a woman 
be more like a man?" pretty much capture the mainstream attitude. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, culturally and economically, science and technology are 
overwhelmingly male enterprises. Pick a society, any society, and you'll find 
that women play only the most peripheral roles in shaping the flow of pure 
science and applied technology. Sure, there's the occasional Madame Curie and 
Ada, Countess of Lovelace, but they're atypical to the point of anomaly. 
</P>
<P>
Current statistics reinforce the historical patterns: Only 6% of all working 
engineers in America today are women. Women probably have greater influence 
over the future of baseball than they do over emerging technologies. 
</P>
<P>
But wait; it gets worse. Although women represent more than 40% of law school 
enrollment and more than 35% of medical school enrollment, barely 14% of 
baccalaureate engineering graduates last year were female -- an astonishingly 
low figure but positively grandiose compared to the 2.3% level of 1975. 
European and Japanese figures are scarcely better. For all intents and 
purposes, women have been practically irrelevant to the revolutions that have 
swept through the physical sciences and sparked the dominant technologies of 
this era. 
</P>
<P>
There's no question that there are a lot of male chauvinist pigs snuffling 
among the Pyrex test tubes. The hard sciences -- notably physics and chemistry 
-- are notorious for their "old boy" cultures; it's as much "who you know" as 
"what you know" to get that lucrative post-doctorate fellowship. Deans of 
engineering colleges piously shrug their shoulders and bleat how difficult it 
is to graduate top-flight female talent even as they call them "girls." Much of 
this sexism is open; far more is subtle and subconscious, the result of 
self-perpetuating traditions that treat women as exceptions to the rule rather 
than participants who happen to be the other gender. 
</P>
<P>
"For a profession that fancies itself as intellectually neutral, science, like 
any other part of our life, is heir to all the social realities," says feminist 
scholar Vivian Gornick, author of "Women in Science." "The life for women in 
physics and chemistry, for example, has been crippling." 
</P>
<P>
And yet, can tacit sexism and overt misogyny really explain this overwhelming 
gender gap? After all, weren't lawyers and doctors once paragons of sexist 
professional elites? A generation ago, law schools and medical schools -- not 
to mention business schools -- treated women as less than second-class 
citizens. That's no longer true. Similarly, women now exert significant 
influence in political, economic and social circles that were once barred to 
them. Does anyone out there really believe that a cabal of scientists and 
engineers could successfully thwart the active participation of women in their 
domains when lawyers and doctors could not? 
</P>
<P>
Reality indicates that there may be other reasons for this gender gap. The 
principal of an elite Southern California private girls school that recently 
went co-ed acknowledges that, despite the school's best efforts, females are 
consistently significantly under-represented in the advanced science classes. 
"I can't deny that there's a gap," she said, "but I can't really explain why 
it's there." 
</P>
<P>
This isn't unusual. Girls are rarely equitably represented in elective high 
school physics, chemistry or calculus classes. Indeed, barely a third of the 
finalists of the nationwide Westinghouse Science Talent Search are girls -- 
that's already below their classroom percentage. 
</P>
<P>
Is this because girls have their interest in science squeezed out of them by 
the time they enter high school? Or is it because, on average, girls are simply 
less interested in science than in other subjects? There are even respected 
studies from Johns Hopkins University purporting to show that, discounting 
social biases, young girls' math skills are, on average, inferior to boys'. 
Basically, is this dearth of women in science and technology simply "society's 
fault?" Or something inherent? 
</P>
<P>
The correct answer is "none of the above." In fact, there are active and 
exciting domains of science where women are increasingly active on all levels: 
molecular biology, medical research and biotechnology. According to Dr. Brigid 
D. Leventhal, director of clinical research administration at Johns Hopkins and 
a Westinghouse judge for more than 20 years, "girls are more heavily into the 
biomedical sciences than in the physical sciences." 
</P>
<P>
There's no inherent reason for this except, perhaps, says Leventhal, that "to 
be in the biological sciences may be less distorting to the female nurturing 
self-image than the physical sciences or engineering." 
</P>
<P>
I am neither bold enough nor foolish enough to assert that this self-image 
comes about because of acculturation or deeply biological urges that sway 
individual choice. Is it more socially acceptable for women to be involved in 
engineering life than engineering silicon chips? I don't know. What I do know 
is that, even though organic chemistry is more difficult to master in college 
than physical chemistry, more women in college take the former. This issue, I 
believe, isn't intellect; it's interest. For whatever reasons, women simply 
aren't as interested in being chemists, physicists and electronics engineers as 
they are in being doctors, molecular biologists and genetic engineers. 
</P>
<P>
This raises a fascinating question: Does gender matter in scientific research? 
Do women, because of their interests, temperaments and backgrounds, bring a 
different sensibility to scientific research than their male counterparts? 
</P>
<P>
Talk with people at Johns Hopkins, Stanford and Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology's Whitehead Institute, and it's immediately clear that the influx of 
women in molecular biology has influenced the nature of research. Women make a 
difference. According to one lab director, they are more interested in finding 
patterns than solving problems. 
</P>
<P>
On one level, this shouldn't be surprising; men and women are, of course, 
different. On another level, it's disturbing, because if men and women really 
are different, one runs into the thorny questions of the strengths and 
weaknesses associated with those differences. 
</P>
<P>
Given current trends, women will continue to rise in importance and influence 
in life science research. However, unless there are fundamental changes in 
society and the engineering infrastructure -- such as requiring all high school 
students to take four years of science and math -- we may never know just what 
sort of a sensibility women can bring to the various disciplines of 
engineering. At the very least, more women would make a quantitative difference 
-- but the more intriguing question is would they make a qualitative 
difference? 
</P>
<P>
Given that companies and industries are struggling to become more competitive 
in an increasingly technological marketplace, that becomes a very provocative 
question. My guess is that it will be another generation -- if at all -- that 
women have the same impact on, say, electronics engineering as they will have 
on genetic engineering.

SAMSUNG ISN'T CONTENT TO BE A MERE GIANT; 
</P>
<P>
TECHNOLOGY: THE COMPANY IS POURING MORE MONEY INTO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, 
WITH AN EYE TO OBTAINING TOP-TIER STATUS WORLDWIDE IN MANY DIVERSIFIED AREAS.

<TEXT>
<P>
By the 1950s, Lee Byung Chul had become the John D. Rockefeller of South Korea; 
his name synonymous with wealth, his business often the object of political 
wrath. 
</P>
<P>
What started in 1938 as a fruit and sundries trading firm became Samsung Group, 
South Korea's first and biggest conglomerate. Until his death three years ago 
at 77, the founder ruled with authoritarian fervor and lived in splendor. At 
his estate at Yongin is his former mansion, a larger-than-life statue of Lee, 
and the Ho-Am Art Museum, the only private art museum in South Korea. Peacocks 
roam the gardens. 
</P>
<P>
The founder's spirit still pervades Samsung. But his designated successor, 
third son Lee Kun Hee, is marshaling Samsung's 27 companies and 18 major 
affiliates to build what he describes as the company's "second foundation." 
</P>
<P>
The new foundation, says the 48-year-old Samsung chairman, will be an emphasis 
on technology, fortified with an aggressive investment program. Samsung has 
more than doubled its investment in new facilities in the past three years, and 
this year it will spend $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Samsung also hopes to emerge from the umbrella of Korean protectionism, which 
has sheltered its electronics operations from Japanese competition at home, to 
become fully competitive worldwide. Here too, spending and technology are the 
keys. 
</P>
<P>
The technological drive comes in many areas: new materials for electronics, 
auto parts and aerospace; aircraft production; automotive manufacturing; 
consumer electronics, and telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
Samsung still operates textile plants, department stores and hotels. But its 
new strategy is "to enter all aspects of high technology," says Lee Hyung Do, 
senior managing director of Samsung General Chemicals Co., the group's newest 
entry in the high-tech field, 
</P>
<P>
If Samsung is successful, the impact will be seen not only on the 
conglomerate's bottom line but throughout South Korea, where Samsung's sales 
amount to 16.5% of the gross national product, and in boardrooms in the United 
States and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The grand ambitions belie the shy nature of the Japanese- and American-educated 
chairman, who was designated by his father 16 years before he died to take over 
the business. Samsung, the chairman declares, intends to move up from 24th 
place on Fortune magazine's list of the world's largest enterprises to the top 
10 by the year 2000. In electronics, it intends to move into the top five. 
</P>
<P>
Getting there won't be easy, and it's not hard to find skeptics. "It's nice to 
have goals," a representative of one of Japan's largest conglomerates commented 
wryly. 
</P>
<P>
But with a corps of executives rated as the best in South Korea, an ability to 
digest foreign technology and move on to independent development of new 
products and a firm commitment to growth despite meager profits (1.3% of sales 
in 1989), Samsung has been known to accomplish what others considered 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Challenges 
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, the Samsung Group was struggling to find a way to produce 
microwave ovens. In aviation, it was overhauling engines. Its semiconductor 
work consisted of producing the raw material, wafers, and letting others etch 
in the technology. Two South Korean rivals had surpassed it in sales, and 
another was breathing down its neck. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Samsung, with help from General Electric and J. C. Penney, has become 
the world's No. 1 producer of microwave ovens. The company's aerospace unit has 
been selected to coordinate the $4.4-billion production of South Korea's next 
mainline jet fighter, the McDonnell Douglas FA-18. Its semiconductor operation 
ranks seventh in the world in production of memory chips. 
</P>
<P>
And Samsung Group is back atop South Korea's list of the family-run chaebol, or 
conglomerates, that dominate the nation's economy -- topping even Hyundai when 
Samsung's insurance companies are included. Last year, Samsung's network of 
companies and major affiliates racked up $34 billion in sales -- 10 times sales 
a decade earlier -- and employed 180,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Samsung Group is made up of private and publicly held entities, but the 
founding family exercises absolute control. Shares in 12 Samsung companies 
trade in Korea, but as with all Korean firms, foreigners are barred from direct 
ownership. If Samsung's ambitious goals are met, by the year 2000 its trading 
company alone -- the flagship of the group -- will have 120 subsidiaries and 
annual sales of $48 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Samsung's challenges are many -- and they mirror those of its country. 
The days when personnel cost less than machine power are gone. With Korean 
workers refusing to work more than two hours a day of overtime, 70-hour 
workweeks have disappeared. And Samsung executives blame neglect of research 
and development for a loss of international competitive standing. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign markets are vital to Samsung, as they are for so many South Korean 
companies. Samsung's exports last year totaled $6.4 billion, 32 times what they 
were in 1975, when the conglomerate's trading company was established. But this 
year the company expects an increase of only 6%, according to Sung Hong Jae, 
executive managing director. 
</P>
<P>
So Samsung has set its sights on new markets: Japan, Southeast Asia and -- 
"like everybody else," as Sung put it -- Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the conglomerate set up seven branch offices in Eastern Europe, the 
Soviet Union, Vietnam and China, and this year it will add four more. Russian 
and Chinese language courses have been added to the curriculum at the group's 
training institute. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past," Sung said, "we could export in quantity. But now overseas 
markets are demanding specialized items in small quantities. For that, we lack 
an accumulation of technological expertise. Too little attention was paid to 
research and development." 
</P>
<P>
As it seeks to become more efficient and technologically advanced, Samsung has 
some advantages. Lim Dong Sung, president of the Samsung Economic Research 
Institute, predicts that the conglomerate's fabled success in labor-management 
relations will enable it to automate faster than South Korea's other corporate 
giants. 
</P>
<P>
Since President Roh Tae Woo promised in 1987 to democratize the country, 
Samsung has been the only one of the Big Four Korean conglomerates to avoid 
major labor strife, even though Samsung has opposed the formation of labor 
unions. 
</P>
<P>
Pay is a factor. The average Samsung laborer -- 30 years old and five years on 
the job -- is paid 11.5 million won a year, the equivalent of $16,428. This is 
10% more than other conglomerates pay, according to Samsung executives. Samsung 
workers also get fringe benefits worth 2.5 million won ($3,577) per worker per 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Samsung raised wages 23.3%, and Lim said this was so generous that 
"we were criticized" by other conglomerates. This year, he said, the government 
asked Samsung to go first in setting wage levels to ensure that it would not 
give bigger raises than its competitors. It approved an 8.9% increase. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Complexes 
</P>
<P>
Having invested in its people, the company is investing to build a 
technological future. 
</P>
<P>
Samsung General Chemicals Co. is spending $1.8 billion over three years, 
building a complex of 10 plants. Under foreign technological licenses, they 
will produce new materials for use in electronics, auto parts and aerospace. A 
second group of plants, to cost $2 billion, is planned. 
</P>
<P>
In such fields as construction equipment, "we expect to triple capacity by 
1997," said Kim Moo, senior executive managing director of Samsung Shipbuilding 
&amp; Heavy Industry. 
</P>
<P>
Production of wristwatches will increase from 2.4 million last year to 20 
million in five years, half of which will be exported, according to Kim Young 
Woong, executive managing director of Samsung Watches. 
</P>
<P>
A sharp spurt is expected in aerospace, too, as a result of Samsung's 
designation as coordinator for the jet fighter project. South Korea will import 
12 completed FA-18 Hornets from McDonnell Douglas, assemble 36 others and then 
produce 72 units here. 
</P>
<P>
Samsung aerospace brochures declare that the company intends to use the fighter 
project to acquire the ability to "design and manufacture our own aircraft." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Samsung announced plans to enter yet a new field: the automotive 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
It said it planned to sign a technological assistance agreement with Nissan 
Diesel of Japan to build concrete mixers, dump trucks and other heavy-duty 
trucks and would invest nearly $100 million to build a factory capable of 
manufacturing 5,000 units a year beginning in 1991. Although the firm said it 
has no immediate plans to build passenger cars, the announcement was widely 
regarded as heralding Samsung's first step toward that business. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Firms Protected 
</P>
<P>
Like other conglomerates, Samsung nurtured many of its industries in a 
greenhouse of government protection. For example, the import of nearly all 
Japanese electronics products is banned, along with watches and cameras. 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1970s, foreign telecommunications equipment makers were told, in 
effect, to hand over technology if they wanted to participate in the growth of 
Korean industry. They did; now Samsung and other Korean firms export optical 
fibers and sophisticated telecommunications equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Still, many of Samsung's products are not competitive internationally. Choe 
Dong Soo, senior analyst of the credit rating firm Korea Investors Service, 
cites only two exceptions: electronics and semiconductors. 
</P>
<P>
Samsung's new commitment to research and development is designed to rectify 
that. Subsidiaries that a few years ago spent only 2% of sales on research are 
now devoting as much as 10% to product development. 
</P>
<P>
The chemicals unit has not begun operations yet has set up a research and 
development center and hired 400 researchers -- 40 with doctoral degrees -- to 
staff it. 
</P>
<P>
Soh Jin Wha, president of the Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, said 
his unit isn't "doing anything fantastically new," but its people are working 
on projects ranging from television to superconductive materials to trajectory 
systems for missiles. 
</P>
<P>
As Japanese and American semiconductor makers have discovered from Samsung's 
surge, things move quickly in South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
"When Americans talk of the long term," Soh said, "they usually mean 10 years 
or more. When they talk of the midterm, they usually mean five or six years. 
But to us, the long term is five years. The midterm is three years." 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, as Samsung began acquiring prominence in the memory chip 
field, Texas Instruments sued for infringement of patents. Samsung settled out 
of court with a payment of about $8 million, Soh said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, competition from Samsung forced NEC, the giant Japanese firm, to 
lower its prices on 1-megabit dynamic random access memory chips (DRAMS). It 
was the first time a Japanese chip maker had reacted to competition from Korea. 
</P>
<P>
The Samsung Group's ability to obtain and effectively use foreign technology 
proved particularly crucial in semiconductors. With technology obtained in 1983 
from Micron of the United States and Sharp of Japan, Samsung started producing 
64-kilobit DRAMs in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Then, according to Lee Kwan, a former minister of science and technology, 
Samsung collaborated with its Korean competitors in a project coordinated by 
the government Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute to develop 
the 1-megabit DRAM and the 4-megabit DRAM. 
</P>
<P>
Samsung Electronics, which five years ago spent only 2% of its sales on 
research and development, now spends 7%, which is higher than Japanese giants 
Matsushita, with 5.8%, and Sony, with 5.7%. In absolute terms, however, 
Samsung's $500 million for R&amp;D remains dwarfed by Matsushita's $2.3 billion 
and Sony's $1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The effort to go high tech also suffers, Soh said, from the Confucian, 
authority-centered nature of Korean society and its emphasis on seniority. At 
Samsung, he said, "scientists and engineers are still not treated any better 
than accountants." 
</P>
<P>
At the twice-a-week meeting of company presidents in Seoul, he said, "there are 
no free discussions. Everyone is frozen." He went on: "If no one says anything, 
the chairman has to direct a person to speak. Younger people don't freely 
express their views." 
</P>
<P>
But Samsung's management is so well organized, he said, that when the group 
decides to focus on something it usually catches up quickly with the foreign 
competition. Administration, "by dedicated, highly disciplined people . . . is 
very strong -- perhaps stronger than in American companies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost like Sparta. When a person is given a mission, he will finish it," 
Soh said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bold Strokes 
</P>
<P>
Despite a reputation for caution, bold, expansionist gestures are well within 
Samsung's tradition. When Samsung entered the credit card business in 1988, it 
became No. 1 in Korea virtually overnight -- by having each of its 180,000 
employees persuade at least one friend to apply for a card. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the conglomerate established itself as Korea's leading business group 
with two audacious, pioneering moves. 
</P>
<P>
In 1953, founder Lee Byung Chul decided to build a sugar refinery, the first 
South Korean manufacturing facility to go up after the Korean War. This is 
cited at the Samsung Training Center as a key example of "Samsung spirit." 
</P>
<P>
Choi In Il, general manager of Samsung's human resources development center, 
said: "Businessmen of the early 1950s were shortsighted people who made easy 
money by selling U.S. aid materials. Lee was ridiculed for bothering to 
manufacture an item that could easily be obtained through American aid. But by 
creating a sugar refinery, the late chairman saved dollars needed for imports 
and contributed to the national economy."

MEDICAL LASER STOCKS OFFER BIG PROMISE -- AND RISK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CRUDELE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
R. J. Barrios has worn eyeglasses since he was a teen-ager. And the 35-year-old 
Louisiana man never liked it. "I hate glasses. I've always hated them. And I 
couldn't wear contact lenses comfortably." 
</P>
<P>
With luck, he won't have to wear glasses again. A month ago Barrios had 
experimental laser surgery that, in essence, reshaped his left eyeball during a 
10-minute procedure. And, so far, it has almost completely corrected his 
nearsightedness. "At this stage of the game, I think laser surgery is 
wonderful," says Barrios. 
</P>
<P>
Patients who have entered the new frontier of bloodless medical procedures that 
are performed with lasers may marvel at the technology. But among the nation's 
medical and financial experts there is still doubt as to which procedures will 
prove viable over the long haul and which companies will ultimately benefit 
from their discoveries. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that laser surgery is an exciting industry. There is 
tremendous growth," says Irving J. Arons, senior consultant and medical laser 
specialist for Arthur D. Little, the Cambridge, Mass., research firm. "But 
there is no telling when the growth spurt will come about because of the long 
regulatory process. And, of course, there is no telling which procedures will 
eventually be successful." 
</P>
<P>
Without much fanfare, Wall Street has recently started bidding up the stock 
prices of some of the companies directly and indirectly involved in making the 
equipment used in laser medical procedures. Cabot Medical Corp., a Langhorne, 
Pa., manufacturer of laparoscopes used in laser surgery on gallbladders, in the 
past month has seen its stock rise from just $6 a share to more than $10. 
</P>
<P>
And Summit Technologies Inc., a tiny Watertown, Mass., company that developed 
the excimer laser that was used to clear up Barrios' nearsightedness, has seen 
its stock soar to about $18 a share from just $2 a few years ago. Summit has 
yet to have significant profits from its discoveries. 
</P>
<P>
The big question these days is: Are investors being too farsighted on the laser 
surgery market? 
</P>
<P>
"The problem with this industry in the past is that there has been a lot of 
hype," says Nushin Namazi, a market analyst with Biomedical Business 
International, a health-care consulting firm in Santa Ana. "A lot of people 
have been disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
"There are some potentially high-growth markets, but you won't see these for 
two to three years," Namazi says. And, she adds, some segments of the laser 
surgery market are already mature and treacherous. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the evaluation of the laser surgery business these days is being 
conducted by small, local "boutique" investment firms, as well as by medical 
industry consultants. Large Wall Street brokerages, for the most part, haven't 
begun sizing up the dozens of small laser-surgery companies that make up the 
industry. One reason for this is that many of the companies are privately owned 
mom-and-pop labs that think they've latched on to a good discovery but haven't 
sold any stock to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Even without this mainstream Wall Street research, investors have been getting 
the word on laser stocks. Reports in the general press during the past few 
weeks about laparoscopic cholecystectomies, a new procedure in which diseased 
gallbladders can be detached from the body by lasers and removed through a 
small incision, is mainly responsible for the boom in Cabot Medical's stock. 
Cabot's laparoscopes are the thin tubes that are inserted in the body and 
through which the laser is "delivered," or in layman's terms, "shot." 
</P>
<P>
Experts say advances such as the one on gallbladders will continue to excite 
investors. But they warn that few companies in the laser business will prosper. 
Some experts warn that the years ahead could produce shakeouts for many of the 
small, under-funded companies that are trying to hang on in the medical laser 
field. 
</P>
<P>
Namazi, for one, warns that the market for ophthalmic lasers is maturing, with 
the possible exception of the eyeball reshaping technology being tested by 
Summit and three other companies. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, lasers and associated products for surgery on the eyes -- detached 
retinas, removal of cataracts and other procedures -- accounted for revenues of 
$82 million, she estimates. In 1989, revenues were just $52 million. 
</P>
<P>
The hottest ophthalmic use for lasers could turn out to be the one being tested 
by Summit. The other companies involved in similar tests are Taunton 
Technologies of Monroe, Conn.; Visx Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif., and Phoenix 
Laser Systems of San Francisco. This eyeball-reshaping procedure is exciting 
the public so much, in fact, that Summit refuses to give out the exact 
locations of its tests. The clinics, Summit says, get inundated with hundreds 
of phone calls from volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Summit's experiment is capturing the public's interest, Namazi 
warns that even if everything goes right the Food and Drug Administration 
probably won't officially approve Summit's procedure -- called photo refractive 
keretectomy -- until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Summit is testing its procedure in four locations -- in Boston, in New Orleans 
and at two clinics in Southern California. How's it going? "A lot of people are 
seeing 20/20 and not wearing their glasses," says David Muller, president of 
Summit. 
</P>
<P>
Adds Stephen Brint, assistant professor of ophthalmology at Tulane University 
and the one who performed the surgery on Barios: "We have completed the 
four-month follow-up (exam) on seven patients and the results have been very 
good." 
</P>
<P>
Arthur D. Little's Arons says corneal sculpting -- or eyeball reshaping -- 
could turn into a $150-million- to $200-million-a-year market for the equipment 
makers. And if you include doctor and hospital bills of approximately $1,500 an 
eye, it could be a $4-billion annual market, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Other promising medical uses for the laser, says Arons, could be in treating 
cancer. He estimates that $20 million to $40 million a year could be spent just 
on equipment for this procedure. Laser equipment for treating kidney stones 
could add $40 million a year in hardware sales; laser equipment for back, 
spinal and elbow surgery could amount to $20 million a year; lasers for the 
treatment of arthritis, $10 million, and $15 million in equipment could 
eventually be sold to dentists if lasers are ultimately approved for removal 
for tooth decay. 
</P>
<P>
When you include drugs that will also be necessary for many of these 
procedures, Arons believes, the market for medical lasers and all related 
equipment could eventually total $900 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Who are the biggest companies in the medical laser field? American Dental Laser 
of Birmingham, Mich., has lasers that are used by dentists, says Arons, while a 
Pfizer Inc. subsidiary has laser equipment for the orthopedic market. And two 
small firms -- Candela Laser and Technomed International -- have lasers that 
are being marketed for breaking up gallstones and kidney stones. 
</P>
<P>
Quadralogic Technologies Inc. of Vancouver is working on a photo-sensitizer 
cancer-fighting drug that, after put in the body, would be activated by a 
laser, Namazi says. 
</P>
<P>
Intelligent Surgical Laser of La Jolla is working on a technology that would 
compete with Summit's eyeball-reshaping procedure. Surgical Laser Technologies 
of Malvern, Pa., and Laserscope of San Jose market lasers for use in 
gallbladder removal. 
</P>
<P>
Sharplan Lasers, Heraeus LaserSonics and Surgilase also have other lasers that 
can be used for gallbladder removal, the experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Coherent Medical Corp., meanwhile, is the leader in the ophthalmic laser field. 
</P>
<P>
But if you are thinking of investing in any of the publicly traded companies in 
the laser business, keep in mind that a number of things could go wrong. It 
wouldn't be surprising if a company's breakthrough technology were quickly made 
obsolete by a new discovery. Or the procedures they are exploring may just, 
flat-out, not work very well. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't very long ago, Namazi points out, that big things were expected of 
lasers designed to clear clogged arteries to the heart. But conventional bypass 
surgery has proven more effective, and no laser has been approved for this 
task.

EX-CHIEF OF BIG BROKERAGE CONVICTED IN MEXICO; 
</P>
<P>
SECURITIES: HE'S THE FIRST FOUND GUILTY OF A CRIME AGAINST THE COUNTRY'S 
SECURITIES LAWS. PROSECUTORS SAY A THREE-YEAR SENTENCE ISN'T STIFF ENOUGH.

<TEXT>
<P>
The former chairman of Mexico's second-largest stock brokerage this week became 
the first person convicted of criminally violating the country's securities 
laws, but prosecutors condemned his sentence as too light. 
</P>
<P>
Eduardo Legorreta, once the chairman of the brokerage Operadora de Bolsa, was 
convicted Tuesday of unregistered trading in Mexican Treasury bills but was 
acquitted of fraud and falsification of documents. He received three years in 
prison, a term that can be commuted in exchange for community service. He was 
also assessed a $4,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Legorreta was one of four prominent stockbrokers arrested 17 months ago on 
charges of illegal trading. He has been in prison since his arrest. The Mexican 
State Department will decide whether the rest of his sentence can be exchanged 
for community service and, if so, which type. 
</P>
<P>
Before Legorreta and the other three brokers, no individuals had been been 
prosecuted in Mexico for securities law violations. Until Mexico's disastrous 
stock market crash in 1987, irregularities and investor complaints were handled 
as regulatory matters. The crash exposed a number of abuses, and since then 
Mexican securities laws and regulations have been tightened. 
</P>
<P>
Legoreta faced a maximum sentence of 10 years, and federal prosecutor Amador 
Castro Vega, complaining that the defendant got off easy, said he may appeal. 
But Mexican Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Oscar Espinoza 
Villarreal called the trial "an example of great importance" that demonstrates 
that the nation's stock market regulations will be enforced. 
</P>
<P>
Jaime Ceballos Martinez, assistant director of Operadora, who was arrested with 
Legorreta, was sentenced Tuesday to 16 months in prison and a $2,000 fine. He 
received credit for time served and was freed this week. 
</P>
<P>
The fate of the other two suspects hasn't been determined, as far as is 
publicly known. Both are from another brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
Legorreta's arrest received the most attention because he is a member of a 
prominent family that owned one of Mexico's largest banks before 
nationalization in 1982. His brother, Agustin, is believed to be forming an 
investor group to buy a bank that the government has decided to offer them for 
private ownership. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests were also interpreted as a political move to balance the jailing 
five weeks earlier of oil workers union leader Joaquin Hernandez Galicia, 
making the government appear evenhanded in its treatment of labor and business. 
</P>
<P>
The accusations against the brokers stemmed from their actions during and after 
the international crash of October, 1987. The Mexican SEC received more than 
1,200 complaints from investors who claimed that they were cheated during and 
after the crash, when the Mexican market dropped 74% in less than 40 days. 
</P>
<P>
An arbitrator appointed by the agency had previously awarded $6 million in 
compensation to investors who claimed that they had been defrauded by 
Operadora. The settlements nearly bankrupted the firm, according to sources 
inside the company, but Operadora is now believed to be on sound financial 
footing, with $81 million in equity and $6.5 billion in investments under 
management.

Key OPEC leaders Wednesday stressed a willingness to be flexible as they began 
crisis talks on rescuing oil prices from the sharp fall that has been caused by 
a world glut. 
</P>
<P>
The president of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Algeria's 
Sadek Boussena, met in Algiers with the oil ministers of Kuwait and Indonesia 
in preparation for a crucial conference in Geneva on July 25. 
</P>
<P>
A glut blamed on quota violations by several members, including Kuwait, has 
resulted in prices falling about one-third this year. 
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's Ginanjar Kartasasmita said at Algiers airport that he thought the 
slide had "reached the bottom, more or less" but agreed that much may depend on 
whether OPEC reaches an accord on production quotas in Geneva that all members 
would observe. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and another Gulf Arab state, the United Arab Emirates, have been 
over-producing and demanding that they get higher quotas in any new accord. 
</P>
<P>
Others, including Iraq, Iran and Algeria, first want existing accords obeyed to 
revive average spot market prices at least to OPEC's declared target of $18 a 
barrel, compared to less than $14 now. 
</P>
<P>
They cannot see how demands for sharply higher quotas can be met without 
raising the ceiling on total OPEC output to levels that would expand, rather 
than mop up, the glut.

BRAZIL'S PRESIDENT DENIES PLANS FOR MORE REFORMS 
</P>

<P>
President Fernando Collor de Mello categorically denied that he is preparing a 
second package of economic reforms for Brazil to follow the monetary shock 
therapy he administered in March, newspapers reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Reports had speculated that rising inflation might force Collor to slam the 
brakes on the economy for the second time this year. 
</P>
<P>
"People are talking about a Collor Plan II," Collor said in an interview with 
Brazilian newspaper editors published Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be no Plan II whatsoever," Collor said. "The plan is the one we've 
got." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after taking office in March, Collor took more than one-third of 
Brazil's wealth out of circulation by freezing most bank deposits and 
simultaneously introducing a new currency. 
</P>
<P>
The drastic measures caused inflation, the government's declared No. 1 enemy, 
to fall from nearly 100% a month to about 5%. But last month it jumped back to 
9%, and economists say price rises are accelerating. 
</P>
<P>
"This 9% inflation has . . . three components," Collor said. "Rents, . . . 
clothes and fruit and vegetables. That's basically it. Everything else is 
absolutely under control. For August . . . we are expecting inflation of 3%." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Brasilia on Wednesday, Economy Minister Zelia Cardoso 
de Mello echoed Collor's assertions that the rising prices were caused by 
seasonal factors and were not a sign of a long-term trend. 
</P>
<P>
"Our policies are on course," Cardoso said. "You cannot compare what happened 
in the past with this government." 
</P>
<P>
The pace of internal reform, Collor said, has to a certain extent distracted 
attention from the question of foreign debt, but he said the matter has not 
been forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Brazil suspended most interest payments on its medium- and 
long-term private bank debt of $63.2 billion. The government has said 
negotiations with creditor banks will have to wait until the country is ready. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone understands this is the initial implementation phase of an economic 
program," Collor said. "We will have to see how things turn out before we know 
what sort of basis we will have for proposing a renegotiation of the debt." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "We have never at any moment lost contact" with creditors. 
</P>
<P>
Collor reiterated his opposition to any form of indexing wages to prices, a 
formula used by previous presidents and one opposition parties are pressing him 
to continue using. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot accept any kind of indexation because if I did, I would be 
responsible for leading the country into hyper-inflation or into a brutal 
recession," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"What we want is free negotiation" between workers and employers.

IT'S A GREAT YEAR TO ZAP BUGS, FIRM SAYS 
</P>

To most people, the zzzzt from their back-yard bug zapper spells the demise of 
another flying pest. To David Blotnick, it's the sweet sound of success. 
</P>
<P>
Spring in many parts of the country was damp and the summer has been hot, very 
hot: perfect conditions for a multitude of flying insects. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been a good season," said Blotnick, executive vice president of DeJay 
Corp., which supplies the United States, Australia and Japan with more than 
750,000 bug zappers a year. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't ask for anything better," he said last week. 
</P>
<P>
In the corner of DeJay's East Tennessee plant hang several dozen finished 
products. Some have been there since the plant opened two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our best way to see how they do in the field," Blotnick said. 
</P>
<P>
Bug zappers attract bugs with a fluorescent light. Circling the light is a grid 
that zaps the bugs with an electric charge as they try to reach the light. 
</P>
<P>
The plant has about 150 workers on three assembly lines, making six bug killers 
a minute. The zappers, sold under the brand name Stinger, range from $20 to 
$60, depending on size. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't build enough merchandise this year," Blotnick said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the zappers last indefinitely, though the bulb probably needs replacing 
every two or three years. 
</P>
<P>
In the off-season, the workers make transformers, which power the grids, for 
the bug killers. 
</P>
<P>
In another section of the plant, where the transformers are tested, one can 
hear the familiar zap of the bug killers. 
</P>
<P>
Blotnick says the seasonal appeal of the product is well understood by DeJay, a 
family-owned business based in Holbrook, Mass., and founded in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
William Blotnick, David Blotnick's father and president of the company, said 
DeJay started out making consumer electronic products, particularly children's 
phonographs that were popular as Christmas presents. 
</P>
<P>
"We were looking for a product to fill the season," the elder Blotnick said.

INSURANCE MISTAKES COST CUSTOMERS MILLIONS; 
</P>
<P>
REGULATION: STATE GOVERNMENTS ARE STEPPING UP THEIR SCRUTINY OF COMPANIES' 
CONDUCT. THE ERRORS COST INSURERS, TOO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE LEVICK, THE HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Insurers are making mistakes. Lots. And they are costing customers time, grief 
and millions of dollars in extra premiums, regulators say. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance departments across the United States have quietly been increasing 
their investigations of companies' conduct, and the findings are sometimes 
alarming. 
</P>
<P>
An industry that boasts state-of-the-art technology and high-quality customer 
service often charges customers too much or too little, cancels policies 
improperly and violates many other state laws, regulators say. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators believe that most of the errors are unintentional. Some companies 
undercharge more than they overcharge. 
</P>
<P>
The national total of overcharges is unknown, but regulators believe that it is 
well into the millions of dollars because they only see problems in random 
samples. Overcharges to individual consumers range from a few dollars to 
hundreds and can be larger for businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The problems have surfaced in "market conduct" examinations by insurance 
departments, which review individual companies to see how they are treating 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the best-known companies have been found to overcharge or undercharge 
one of three or one of four auto insurance customers in some random samplings. 
</P>
<P>
"You wouldn't believe how common it is," said Hawley D. Walter, administrator 
for property-casualty market conduct reviews at the Florida Department of 
Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
But Henry Katz, the ITT Hartford Insurance Group's vice president of government 
relations, said: "Our own experience has shown we're as much victims of 
mispricing as consumers are." 
</P>
<P>
The studies also found that insurers pay too much or too little on certain 
claims and fail to give customers enough notice of new premiums before policies 
are renewed. 
</P>
<P>
Insurers admit that they have made errors but say they correct them when 
notified and still believe that they do a good job of serving customers. An 
insurer may err frequently in one line of coverage while handling another line 
with few mistakes, regulators have found. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a large company, and I think we do a very good job of servicing our 
business," said Richard D. Broome, counsel for Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. 
"Examinations are meant to look at the flaws," he said, adding, "You shouldn't 
take the problems they've uncovered to mean we don't do a very good job." 
</P>
<P>
Companies blame human error, faulty computer programming, the complexity of 
premium calculations and difficulty in complying with new laws. 
</P>
<P>
"It's safe to say we find problems with most -- not all, but most -- companies 
we review," said Dennis C. Shoop, chief of market conduct reviews for 
Pennsylvania's insurance department. 
</P>
<P>
Pennsylvania just started its market conduct reviews a year ago, one of a 
growing number of states doing them. Other states are increasing the number of 
reviews or getting tougher with fines. 
</P>
<P>
"Companies are very sloppy," said J. Robert Hunter, president of the National 
Insurance Consumer Organization. 
</P>
<P>
"No wonder they're getting out of the business," he said, citing some companies 
that are dropping auto insurance. "They can't handle it." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter said he is not surprised by the frequency of insurers' errors, 
attributing them to multiple-level bureaucracies. 
</P>
<P>
"You can be incompetent and have integrity," Hunter said. "You know what the 
road to hell is paved with." 
</P>
<P>
States such as Connecticut and Missouri tolerate errors on about 10% of the 
policies they examine before they levy fines for mispricing. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators do not know how many consumers are overcharged. In each exam, a 
state usually looks only at a random sample of policies bought by its own 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
A company can be ordered to review all policies of a particular line in the 
state if a widespread problem is believed to exist. Regulators do not always do 
that because it can be a mammoth, costly task. 
</P>
<P>
Also, regulators have no system to track each company's errors nationally. All 
they know is that more states are watching. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 states do formal market conduct reviews; 10 more do some market 
conduct checks at the same time they are reviewing companies' financial health, 
said Dick Rogers, deputy director of the consumer division of the Illinois 
Department of Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
States still are not doing nearly enough reviews of insurers, consumer advocate 
Hunter said. A 1988 study of insurance departments found that states had 1,327 
insurance companies licensed on average, but each state reviewed an average of 
14 companies annually. The study was done by the Consumer Insurance Interest 
Group and National Assn. of Professional Insurance Agents. 
</P>
<P>
Market conduct reviews, although limited in number, have grown in scope and 
sophistication. Florida, for instance, which launched market conduct studies in 
1972, checks to make sure that a company is using only the rates and policy 
forms it has filed with the insurance department. Examiners make sure the 
insurer is following its own underwriting rules in selecting and classifying 
customers and not red-lining or discriminating in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
In life and health insurance, states such as Missouri target misleading 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
"They present the policy in the best light, usually with attendant statistics 
to scare you into buying it," said Brad Connor, chief market conduct examiner 
in Missouri. The department insists that ads must fairly portray a policy 
without glossing over what it excludes, Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
Some states, including New York, focus on commercial insurance, where 
mispricing occurs for different reasons. Regulators in New York and Florida 
believe that insurers often intentionally misuse the leeway they have in 
pricing coverage for businesses so they can gain a competitive advantage. In 
business insurance, basic rates are raised or lowered depending on the 
characteristics of the customer. Good safety measures, for example, mean lower 
premiums. 
</P>
<P>
But insurers misapply the rates, granting credits where they are not deserved, 
said Janet E. Glover, assistant bureau chief, property and casualty bureau, at 
New York's insurance department. 
</P>
<P>
When they find mispricing or other errors, regulators fine insurers. The fines 
are seldom more than $100,000 in most states, and usually much less. From 
September, 1987, through Feb. 9 of this year, Connecticut levied $214,200 in 
fines on 27 insurers, some owned by the same parent. The fines ranged from 
$1,000 to $45,500. 
</P>
<P>
Even a $50,000 fine, Hunter joked, is a "corporate lunch" to a major insurer. 
Such small fines would be more effective if insurance departments were out 
"blowing the trumpet" about them, Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way to effect change is to hit them in the wallet or in the public 
relations area," Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators believe that's exactly what they're doing, and companies admit that 
they are embarrassed by fines of any size. 
</P>
<P>
A fine "is a measure of our displeasure with them. It gets reported, and it has 
the effect of embarrassing them," said Missouri's Connor. "Our primary goal has 
been to fix (the problem) and not to make a dramatic fine and ultimately hurt 
the policyholders." 
</P>
<P>
Connor said it probably would be impossible to prevent an insurer from counting 
fines as expenses that are used to figure future rates. Other states say they 
do prohibit the practice and some companies say they do not recover fines 
through rates. 
</P>
<P>
Connor said he believes that some companies have decided it costs less to pay a 
market conduct fine than to correct a problem before regulators detect it. Some 
companies "went to business school one day too long and concluded a 
cost-benefit analysis for all your ills is the way to go," Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
"I see a fine as a deterrent," said John Farley, chief of Connecticut's market 
conduct division. "There have been some huge fines in New York, but I don't 
think the impact on a company is any different whether a fine is $50,000 or 
$300,000. . . . It's the publicity they don't like." 
</P>
<P>
Travelers Corp. agrees. The company, which has annual premiums of $7.8 billion, 
undergoes reviews in six to eight states each year and pays roughly $100,000 in 
market conduct fines in a typical year. 
</P>
<P>
"Just the publicity of an examination -- we'd prefer not to be tainted as a 
sloppy operation," said Richard C. Reeves, secretary, property-casualty 
regulatory division for Travelers. "We think of ourselves as a quality 
operation." 
</P>
<P>
Insurers expect regulators' scrutiny to continue increasing, and some say they 
do not mind. "We like to think we're doing things right, and if we're not, it 
calls attention to the things we're not (correcting) on our own," Katz said.

CORNING'S SOUTH KOREA VENTURE IS A BIG SUCCESS; 
</P>
<P>
MANUFACTURING: THE OPERATION WITH SAMSUNG OUTPERFORMS ITS U.S. PARENT IN MAKING 
GLASS FOR TELEVISION TUBES.

KUMI, South Korea 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Samsung, a South Korean conglomerate, is known to favor technology licensing 
over joint ventures, but 17 years ago it made an exception for the American 
firm Corning. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a Korean-American offspring that has outgrown the American parent 
in the manufacture of glass for television tubes. Samsung Corning now ranks 
third in the world in this specialty while Corning, the U.S. leader, is sixth. 
</P>
<P>
The joint venture has spawned a joint venture of its own, with Kaili-Chemie of 
West Germany, and Samsung Corning has opened a second factory at Kumi, an 
industrial complex 120 miles southeast of Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
Growth in three new product lines -- specialty glass, ceramics for integrated 
circuit packaging and fine chemicals -- promises to increase Samsung Corning's 
sales to more than $4 billion by 2000, according to Kim Ik Myung, executive 
managing director of the company and manager of the Kumi factory. That would be 
13 times greater than last year's $315.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Corning itself, which had sales of $2.4 billion in 1989, is not as optimistic 
about the future of its South Korean joint venture. Duane Welch, business 
development and planning manager of the Corning, N.Y.-based firm, said in a 
telephone interview that he expects Samsung Corning's sales to fall short of $1 
billion in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Kim acknowledged that plans to double the size of the Kumi plant by 1993 may 
not be realized. 
</P>
<P>
"Korean political and social conditions have grown worse," he said, "so it may 
take more time. But it could be finished by 1995. After all, sales for the 
whole Samsung Group 10 years ago were only a tenth of what they are today." 
</P>
<P>
Samsung Corning's sales quadrupled in 1985-89. Unlike many Korean firms, which 
lost their price advantage in the world market because of massive wage 
increases and currency appreciation, "we are price-competitive," Kim said, "and 
our productivity is higher than Japan's." 
</P>
<P>
The new plant, opened two years ago, is manufacturing soft ferrite used in 
making videocassette drums, coated glass for flat panel displays and ceramic 
integrated-circuit packages. It plans to start production of silicon and 
gallium-arsenide wafers for semiconductors. 
</P>
<P>
"All the new product lines are frontier fields in Korea," Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
Samsung Corning, with a research institute and staff of 200, is not relying on 
Corning for all its technology, he said, adding that the institute has 
developed a number of products on its own. 
</P>
<P>
Corning turned over factory operations to Korean managers in 1976, three years 
after the joint venture was established. Welch said he and other American-based 
Corning executives often visit the firm, but no Corning executive has lived in 
South Korea since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Samsung has had trouble with other foreign partners over the years, but Kim and 
Welch said neither partner has asked for a change in management arrangements or 
in the 50-50 ownership ratio for Samsung Corning. 
</P>
<P>
"We consider the relationship permanent," Welch said. "Samsung has seen the 
value of our technology and wants to assure that they have access to it as time 
goes on. If any discussion about reducing our equity came up, we would probably 
take a different stance and withdraw our technology." 
</P>
<P>
With a profit-to-sales ratio of 15%, "we are happy, and Corning is equally 
happy," Kim said. "We don't have any management problems."

<P>
If laughter can fend off disease, it should be able to help revive an ailing 
business. 
</P>
<P>
That's the premise pushed by Malcolm Kushner, author and "humor consultant." He 
claims that people who elicit laughs at work get more done and go further than 
their sourpuss colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"I teach people to communicate the fact that they have a sense of humor," said 
Kushner, 37, whose "The Light Touch: How to Use Humor for Business Success" 
(Simon &amp; Schuster) recently hit stores. 
</P>
<P>
He can't teach the delivery of Jay Leno or the wit of Robin Williams. But 
Kushner tries to point out where humor fits in the workplace, as well as what's 
appropriate and what's not. 
</P>
<P>
Racial and sexual slurs are always inappropriate, but Kushner says a competitor 
can be used effectively as the butt of a joke. His example: "How can you tell 
when a (competitor's) executive has been using a word processor?" 
</P>
<P>
Answer: "There's white-out on the screen." 
</P>
<P>
Humor acts as a magnet that draws people in, and it can help make a point, 
Kushner asserts. It also softens stress, motivates people, helps resolve 
conflicts and shields hostile remarks, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"Managing, selling, negotiating, planning, decision-making -- all the 
fundamental tasks associated with business life become a little bit simpler 
when people are prejudiced in your favor," he writes. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Iacocca, Ronald Reagan and Mario Cuomo have shown that successful people 
don't have to be afraid to joke, Kushner says. Indeed, having fun at your own 
expense can be a powerful tool, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"For eight years, Ronald Reagan poked fun at how old he was, and we loved it," 
Kushner says. "When the Iran-Contra (scandal) hit, everyone wanted to give the 
guy the benefit of the doubt. Imagine the same scandal hitting Nixon or Carter. 
We would have said, 'Nail the guy.' The first day." 
</P>
<P>
Kushner quit his job as a lawyer with a San Francisco firm eight years ago and 
took up humor consulting. He's had some tough clients, including the Internal 
Revenue Service and the San Francisco Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
He's also worked with many Fortune 500 companies, focusing on Silicon Valley, 
which is near his Santa Cruz home. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Brownson, a senior marketing executive for Digital Equipment Corp. in 
Maynard, Mass, said he has hired Kushner twice, at a rate of about $1,500 for a 
one-day seminar and $3,000 for a dinner presentation. 
</P>
<P>
"He did an excellent job of improving the quality of our meetings so that we 
could get on with the more important business. He got us to lighten up and look 
at ourselves in a little more realistic way," he said. "You work so hard in our 
business, you begin to believe that selling a computer is the most important 
thing in the world. And it's not." 
</P>
<P>
Kushner cites a 1983 Stanford University study that found laughter can have the 
same health-improving effects as regular exercise. Although he has no 
statistics to prove it, Kushner says the same medicine might improve the 
financial health of a company. 
</P>
<P>
His book outlines dozens of techniques for introducing humor into conversation 
and presentations. Humorous personal anecdotes are great icebreakers, and old 
jokes are useful as analogies, he says.

Self-effacing humor can make a person more likable, he says. His book cites 
Fred Hoar, an executive with Miller Communications in Mountain View, Calif., as 
an example in a chapter called "Building Yourself Up by Putting Yourself Down."

"A veteran Silicon Valley advertising and public relations executive, Hoar 
knows that his name has an unfortunate connotation, particularly when linked 
with his profession," Kushner writes.

The executive starts his presentations by saying, "My name is Fred Hoar.

Cutup Columbo 
</P>
<P>
It was 13 years ago and Michael Pasternak needed a costume for a Halloween 
party. The television-detective "Columbo" happened to be on the cover of TV 
Guide that week. 
</P>
<P>
"I discovered I could do the character's voice and look," said Pasternak, a 
Woodland Hills actor and writer. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since, he has been earning a living by performing his rumpled detective 
shtick -- complete with trench coat, cigar and notebook -- at business 
conventions and private parties. For a fee, he wanders unannounced into the 
middle of such affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"I say, 'Does anyone here have any jumper cables? I don't mean to bother,' " 
Pasternak said in an authentic-sounding Columbo voice. After this opening, the 
actor bumbles around for a moment, starts to leave and then utters the famous 
line: "Excuse me . . . one more thing." 
</P>
<P>
What follows is a "This is Your Life" routine, as Pasternak tells funny and 
embarrassing anecdotes about party guests (such tidbits are provided by the 
person who hires him). Pasternak won't reveal how much money he gets paid for 
appearances, but he did say that the work suits him well. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have to shave and I don't have to dry clean."

<P>
Practical Romance 
</P>
<P>
A soon-to-be married couple recently walked into Franklin's True Value Hardware 
in Woodland Hills and asked if they could register there for wedding gifts. 
Instead of china and crystal, the couple wanted such items as a rake, shovel 
and garage-door opener. 
</P>
<P>
The request was not extraordinary. The Chicago Tribune reports of a hardware 
store in Woodstock, Ill., where 13 couples registered in May. "You might as 
well have people buy you what you want, instead of getting five toasters," said 
Janette Hess in the Tribune article. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, the Valley couple who thought likewise did not get their wish. 
</P>
<P>
"We told them, 'No,' " said a clerk at the Woodland Hills hardware store. "We 
just aren't set up to do that sort of thing." 
</P>
<P>
Is there no place left for romance? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Nintendo 
</P>
<P>
They don't call this city "Television Land" for nothing . . . 
</P>
<P>
About six months ago, a Chicago-based company came out with a gadget that 
allows parents to put a lock on their children's Nintendo video-game console. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Lowe says he invented Homework First after listening to his neighbors 
complain about how much time their children spent in front of the television 
set battling electronic dragons and driving on video race tracks. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these kids are up at midnight playing video games," Lowe says. 
</P>
<P>
The $16 combination lock -- a simple, U-shaped design that blocks the 
game-cartridge door -- has been endorsed by the Council for Children's 
Television and Media. And, Lowe says he has sold 30,000 of the devices 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
But, according to an official at Toys R Us, the only local outlet for Homework 
First, only 66 have sold in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flag Waving 
</P>
<P>
It's been a very good year for people who sell American flags. 
</P>
<P>
According to various flag and banner shops around the Valley, business started 
picking up dramatically last year about this time. 
</P>
<P>
"People started buying a lot because the flag-burning issue was big in the 
news," said Marte Jones, the manager of AAA Flag and Banner in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
The recent congressional vote on a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning 
spurred business again. In addition, sales always pick up around the Fourth of 
July. 
</P>
<P>
"We usually sell one or two flags a day," Jones said. "When it gets close to 
the Fourth, we sell five to 10 a day or more."

MUSICIAN BATTLES HEARING DISORDER WHILE STRIVING FOR A PLACE ON CHARTS

The choir director at Cal State Northridge thinks Ed Corkhill has a brilliant 
future as a songwriter. 
</P>
<P>
That is, if Corkhill doesn't run out of time first. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since the musician was a teen-ager, the volume on his hearing has been 
fading because of a genetic disorder. And now, at 42, Corkhill's ability to 
hear has reached a temporary plateau, even though it is less than half what it 
was when he was born. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason Ed can write songs so well is because he hears the music in his 
mind," said Elmer Heerema, CSUN choir director. "Even without the use of his 
ears, he has a tremendous gift." 
</P>
<P>
Heerema and the CSUN choir agreed in March to record one of Corkhill's songs, 
"Home for the Holidays," so it could be sent to entertainer Perry Como. 
Sometime in the next few weeks, Corkhill and the choir should find out if Como 
is interested in using the song for his Christmas variety show. If Como buys 
the song, it will be Corkhill's third to be published. The first two were 
published in the early '70s, although neither made the charts. 
</P>
<P>
But the Christmas song is just one of dozens that Corkhill has been working on 
since his graduation from CSUN in May. His goal is to have a song on the pop 
and R &amp; B charts before his hearing worsens. 
</P>
<P>
Corkhill believes in being realistic. He graduated with a degree in leisure 
science so he can work as an administrator in a national park or forest one day 
if his hearing goes before he has time to make it big with music. 
</P>
<P>
"It is literally a race against time," said Corkhill, who wears hearing aids in 
both ears. "I have so many songs in my head that I want to put on paper. And I 
don't know if I can keep writing if I lose much more hearing." 
</P>
<P>
Like others who are afflicted with the genetic sensorineural hearing loss, a 
day will eventually come when Corkhill will be nearly deaf. 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of hearing loss can plateau for a few months or as long as a decade 
sometimes," said Bruce Chatterton, a clinical audiologist for the Hearing Care 
Associates in Sherman Oaks. "But eventually, if the genetic loss tends to be 
severe, the person will lose whatever hearing they have." 
</P>
<P>
Five of the seven siblings in the Corkhill family have the same hearing 
disorder as their father, who today is nearly deaf. 
</P>
<P>
"Dad has maybe 5% or 10% of his hearing left," Corkhill said. "And I know the 
facts. The odds are I'll wind up the same way." 
</P>
<P>
Among people with early hearing loss, Chatterton said about 25% involve a 
genetic disorder such as Corkhill's. 
</P>
<P>
Chatterton said that it is remarkable for someone with a genetic hearing 
disorder to write music because the sounds a person can pick up through hearing 
aids are usually muffled and distorted. 
</P>
<P>
But Corkhill's hearing wasn't always muffled and distorted. 
</P>
<P>
When he graduated from his San Benito, Tex., high school in 1963, Corkhill 
played the drums and keyboard for a band called the Gauchos. In its prime, the 
band toured with the Righteous Brothers and in 1965 performed on the ABC-TV 
variety show, "Shindig!" 
</P>
<P>
But hours of practicing and playing musical instruments on a stage covered with 
towering amplifiers took their toll on Corkhill's hearing. Because of his 
family history, he knew there was a chance he would have the genetic hearing 
disorder. But when the sounds Corkhill was picking up didn't seem quite as 
crisp as they once had been, he ignored it and continued playing with the 
Gauchos. 
</P>
<P>
By 1968, when Corkhill was 23, a doctor confirmed his suspicions -- he had the 
disorder and was going deaf at an alarming rate. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctor told me to stop performing, stop being around loud music or I could 
wind up deaf in a year," Corkhill said. 
</P>
<P>
But music was all Corkhill knew and his performing career as an instrumentalist 
was just getting off the ground. He ignored the doctor's warning and in the 
weeks that followed he left the Gauchos and began practicing with the Beach 
Boys. Although he never performed with the famous group, the practice gained 
him recognition and led to his playing with several of the Gauchos who had 
started a new band in Sacramento called Gauchos-6. In 1972, he began performing 
with a group called Brother Frog, which sang Corkhill's two published songs, 
"Stop That Train" and "It's Up to You." 
</P>
<P>
"It's unusual being part of a family where most of the members are deaf or 
</P>
<P>
going deaf," said Maryann, Corkhill's sister and one of two Corkhill siblings 
unaffected by the genetic disorder. "It's to the point where we just accept it. 
Some families have dark hair, some are short, we just happen to have deafness 
that runs in the family. The thing is, nearly everyone in the family also has a 
love of music." 
</P>
<P>
Their father, Joe Gonzales (Corkhill uses his mother's maiden name), began 
writing songs when the family was in Texas. When Gonzales realized he was going 
deaf, he gathered 20 of his best pieces and pitched them to a Hollywood 
producer, Ed Corkhill said. When the producer showed interest, Gonzales packed 
the family into a station wagon, strapped all their belongings on top and 
headed for California. 
</P>
<P>
"But while we were driving here, a ferocious windstorm came up and when we got 
through it we realized everything on top of the car had been blown away," 
Corkhill said. "Dad's songs were on top of the car. After that he was never 
really the same again." 
</P>
<P>
The family continued to California anyway and Gonzales took odd jobs to support 
the family. 
</P>
<P>
"He thought his dreams died in that windstorm," Corkhill said. "But really they 
were just passed down to us kids." 
</P>
<P>
Corkhill became more obsessed with seeing his dream of making it as a 
songwriter when in 1976, at age 31, his hearing suddenly became worse, forcing 
him to wear hearing aids to understand what people around him were saying. By 
then, several high notes on his keyboard were no longer audible and none was as 
clear as they had been. In a matter of weeks, he stopped performing and moved 
to Hollywood to work as a technician at Universal Studios. 
</P>
<P>
"I fell into a deep depression at that time in my life," Corkhill said. "It was 
like for the first time I was realizing the truth -- my career as a musician 
was over." 
</P>
<P>
In 1984 Corkhill enrolled at Kings River College near Fresno and began taking 
courses in forestry -- to fall back on in case he went completely deaf -- and 
music composition. 
</P>
<P>
"I discovered then that I could still express my love for music by being in a 
quiet room all by myself," Corkhill said. 
</P>
<P>
After earning an associate of arts degrees in forest technology and music, he 
enrolled at CSUN in 1987. By then, even though he was no longer around loud 
music, Corkhill had lost more hearing and had decided to focus on a career in 
forestry. 
</P>
<P>
"I was still writing music, but it looked like I would have to make a living 
doing something else," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1989, Corkhill's hearing reached the plateau that doctors say can last 
as long as a decade. Early this year, he decided to delay his forestry career 
and spend his time writing songs until his hearing loss forces him to stop. 
Heerema and the CSUN choir performed his song "Home for the Holidays" two 
months later. 
</P>
<P>
"He is extremely talented," Heerema said. "He has what it takes to write for 
someone like Perry Como because his ballads are centered around family values 
and homemade memories. He's facing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
The CSUN choir plans to perform Corkhill's song next fall in its holiday 
musical, Heerema said. 
</P>
<P>
"When a person has that type of genetic hearing disorder, they could wake up 
one day and suddenly find the plateau period is over and their hearing is much 
worse," Chatterton said. "A person with that disorder really never knows from 
one day to the next how much worse his hearing will be." 
</P>
<P>
And so Corkhill is writing songs as if his life depended on it. 
</P>
<P>
In his race against time, Corkhill is also working on perfecting his musical 
pitch. Perfect pitch, which is very rare even among successful musicians and 
songwriters, means the artist can identify any note simply by hearing it. 
Beethoven, who spent the latter part of his career deaf, had perfect pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"The closer I come to perfect pitch, the longer I'll be able to write songs," 
Corkhill said. "I will always be able to hear the songs in my mind," Corkhill 
said. "But without perfect pitch, I won't be able to write them down when I 
lose more of my hearing." 
</P>
<P>
Corkhill shares a townhouse in West Los Angeles with his sister, Maryann 
Corkhill, 34, and brother, Dan Corkhill, 39. Each is a musician, but only Dan 
and Ed have been diagnosed with the genetic hearing disorder. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see ourselves as poor, pitiful deaf guys who like writing music," Dan 
Corkhill said. "We see ourselves as artists first. Artists who face the 
challenge of deafness." 
</P>
<P>
Ed Corkhill, who is starting to use sign language in preparation for the time 
when his hearing fades even further, agrees with his brother. 
</P>
<P>
"I see music as having more to do with the imagination than with my ears," Ed 
Corkhill said. "After all, Beethoven was deaf when he wrote his last three 
symphonies." 
</P>
<P>
And that puts Corkhill in fairly good company.

<P>
President Bush won approval from other Western leaders today for a surprise 
proposal to invite Mikhail S. Gorbachev to NATO in a goodwill gesture toward 
the Soviet Union. Bush also secured an endorsement by NATO foreign ministers of 
a policy declaration that nuclear weapons would be used in Europe only as a 
last resort. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that not only Gorbachev, but leaders of the other Warsaw Pact nations 
of Eastern Europe also should be invited to NATO. All of the invitations are 
for some future date, not the two-day NATO summit that began today. 
</P>
<P>
The President made his unexpected proposal to invite Gorbachev as NATO began 
debating steps to reshape the Western alliance as a result of the rapidly 
diminishing military threat from the East. French presidential spokesman Hubert 
Vedrine reported later that the allies had endorsed Bush's idea. 
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said NATO will invite Gorbachev "to come and speak in the name of the 
Soviet Union" before the North Atlantic Council in Brussels. The council is the 
principal body of NATO and meets at various levels: ambassadors, foreign 
ministers, or on occasion, heads of state or government. It was not clear who 
would constitute Gorbachev's audience. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, it would have been unthinkable for a Soviet leader to be invited 
to address the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which was forged in 1949 to 
counter potential military aggression from the East. Now, however, Western 
leaders speak of the Soviet Union and East European nations more as friends 
than foes. 
</P>
<P>
A British spokesman said Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was cool toward the 
idea of declaring nuclear weapons as arms of last resort. 
</P>
<P>
But British officials said NATO foreign ministers had agreed at a separate 
four-hour meeting to insert the phrase into the summit's closing statement on 
Friday. Approval by NATO leaders seemed virtually certain. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said the proposal was intended to demonstrate that NATO is 
changing to keep pace with rapid developments in East Europe and the Soviet 
Union. The Warsaw Pact has virtually collapsed since the Soviets' former 
military allies began ousting their long-dominant Communist governments last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that she was in danger of being called "Cold War warrior," 
Thatcher cited detailed statistics about Soviet arms production and urged NATO 
to keep up its guard while reaching out to Moscow and East Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Along with a series of Bush proposals to revamp NATO for a less militaristic 
future, the summit participants are expected to debate whether Western nations 
should rush cash assistance to Moscow to help bail out the Soviet Union's 
crumbling economy. On Wednesday, Bush seemed to ease his conditions for Western 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl told NATO leaders they should make a joint 
declaration with Warsaw Pact countries "that we no longer regard one another as 
adversaries." 
</P>
<P>
Said Kohl: "Confrontation and the Cold War belong to the past." 
</P>
<P>
But French President Francois Mitterrand said he opposes Kohl's call for a 
joint nonaggression declaration, as does the United States. One Canadian 
official said the idea is "losing speed."

HACKMAN AVOIDS HEART ATTACK

<P>
Actor Gene Hackman narrowly avoided a heart attack when he checked into a 
Portland, Ore., hospital complaining of chest pain, his doctor said today. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we got him just in the nick of time," Dr. Herbert Semler said at a 
news conference after he treated the actor for partial blockage of a coronary 
blood vessel. 
</P>
<P>
Hackman, 60, was vacationing on the Oregon coast when he began suffering the 
pain. He was admitted Tuesday to St. Vincent Hospital &amp; Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Semler said Hackman suffered from a narrowing of an artery leading to the 
heart. The doctor said he inserted a balloon catheter into the artery. 
</P>
<P>
Semler said he is recommending an exercise and diet plan for Hackman, who lives 
in Beverly Hills.

Mitch Snyder, a nationally-recognized homeless advocate was found dead today, 
an apparent suicide in a local homeless shelter he helped found, a city 
councilman's office reported. 
</P>
<P>
A local television station reported that Snyder apparently had hanged himself 
and had been depressed recently. 
</P>
<P>
Police confirmed it was investigating a death at the shelter but refused to 
release the name or cause of death. But an aide to City Councilman Harry Thomas 
said police told Thomas that it was Snyder and they were investigating a 
possible suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder, 46, who enlisted movie stars and other celebrities in his campaign, 
nearly died several times during long periods of fasting to protest what he 
said was lack of government funding to help the homeless.

ALBANIA REIMPOSES TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS;

EASTERN EUROPE: THE MOVE COMES AS HUNDREDS SEEK TO FLEE THE LAST HARD-LINE 
COMMUNIST COUNTRY ON THE CONTINENT.

<P>
Albania today reimposed travel restrictions, the Austria Press Agency reported, 
after hundreds of its citizens stormed foreign embassies or gathered outside 
them in an effort to flee their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
The reported government move, only two days after the restrictions were lifted, 
came as diplomats were deadlocked over the fate of more than 200 Albanians who 
have taken refuge in the embassies. 
</P>
<P>
The Austrian report, apparently based on official sources in Tirana, the 
Albanian capital, said the measure was necessary because of the "alarming 
situation" in front of the foreign missions. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a new Albanian law went into effect allowing any adult to apply for 
a passport. The law also said that Albanians holding passports could apply 
directly to foreign embassies for visas. 
</P>
<P>
The Austria Press Agency said the government announced today that Austrians 
could no longer apply to the embassies for visas. The report mentioned nothing 
about any change in the new passport law. 
</P>
<P>
The Austrian news agency, which has had a reporter in Tirana for the last few 
weeks, said another 15 people had asked for asylum at the West German Embassy, 
and at least 20 refugees were said to have climbed the fence of the 
Czechoslovak Embassy, already sheltering 25 people. 
</P>
<P>
If the figures are correct, the total of refugees now holed up inside foreign 
missions would be between 270 and 290. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses in front of the West German Embassy claimed that a man was brutally 
beaten and dragged away by security forces, but a German government spokesman 
in Bonn said there were no reports of new disturbances outside the mission. 
</P>
<P>
The asylum-seekers, many of whom crashed through gates or scaled walls to enter 
embassies earlier this week, present one of the biggest challenges in 45 years 
to the rulers of Europe's poorest, most isolated country. 
</P>
<P>
Albania, the last hard-line communist country left in Eastern Europe, in recent 
months has expressed interest shedding its isolationist ways and broadening 
ties with other nations. 
</P>
<P>
But the Communist Party monopoly on power continues. Communist Party chief 
Ramiz Alia, who succeeded Stalinist strongman Enver Hoxha, has firmly rejected 
the type of multiparty system that has taken hold in the rest of Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The lifting of the travel restrictions on Tuesday was part of a reform package 
adopted in May. Under it, Albanians who previously were not allowed to travel 
freely were entitled to passports. A ban on religion was lifted and the death 
penalty for defectors was abolished. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, a diplomat said by telephone that as many as 500 Albanians 
assembled in front of the Yugoslav Embassy, waiting for travel visas. Another 
crowd of several hundred people was waiting outside the West German mission and 
a smaller group in front of the French Embassy, the diplomat said.

The sister of executed Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was paid for 12 
years as a supervisor at an electrical goods factory but never turned up for 
work, a Bucharest court was told today. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Agache has been charged with defrauding the state and using improper 
influence to obtain refrigerators, televisions and freezers that she sold for a 
total of $30,000, Romania's news agency Rompres reported. 
</P>
<P>
Agache, one of several Ceausescu family members facing trial, had her case 
adjourned until July 19. 
</P>
<P>
The court was told that Agache, who had not completed elementary schooling, was 
employed at the factory from 1962 until January this year, gaining promotion to 
the post of supervisor.

The government, in a sharp departure from past directives, said today that 
Japan must lessen emphasis on its quest for material wealth and focus on the 
search for human fulfillment in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the government 
agency most often credited with guiding the country to economic superpower 
status, appears to have changed directions in its blueprint for the next 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
"Although Japan has achieved a high level of material wealth . . . this 
material wealth was accomplished by emphasizing growth and production over 
human issues," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is now important that Japan creates an environment that will enable 
individuals to lead a leisurely life," said the report, the "International 
Trade and Industrial Policy in the 1990s." 
</P>
<P>
The ministry's plan for the 1990s does not abandon the goal of economic growth 
but places greater emphasis on quality of life issues. 
</P>
<P>
In the past three decades the ministry has pushed the Japanese to work hard and 
save money, while targeting specific industries for growth. 
</P>
<P>
The formula has worked and the Japanese now have the highest average income 
among major countries. 
</P>
<P>
But something is missing, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the practices that contributed to Japan's economic miracle are called 
into question in the report. 
</P>
<P>
Long working hours and men who devote their lives to the company at the expense 
of their families were on the ministry's hit list. 
</P>
<P>
The report called for "building a social framework that enables men and women 
to cooperate and share domestic tasks, such as housekeeping, child-rearing and 
care for the elderly that until now have fallen mostly on women." 
</P>
<P>
The ministry also said it is "absolutely necessary" to obtain the goal of 1,800 
working hours per year, compared to the 2,100 hours per year Japanese workers 
average now. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the changes called for -- such as opening markets to foreign goods, 
cutting prices and streamlining the distribution system -- are reforms the 
United States has been pushing for in its trade negotiations with Japan.

A gunman opened fire today in a Mormon Church parking lot where about 120 
children were boarding buses for camp and wounded an off-duty police officer 
and a woman. He later surrendered without incident. 
</P>
<P>
No children were believed injured in the incident at the Phoenix 36 Ward of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Checketts, 43, an off-duty officer who was at the church with his family, 
was hit in the left arm and chest and was taken to a hospital in serious 
condition. Rachel Beech, 47, was wounded in the left ankle and taken to another 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman holed up in a nearby house for about 90 minutes, then surrendered. 
He was not immediately identified. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any motive at all," a police spokesman said.

CENSUS REPORTS LITTLE CHANGE IN POVERTY FIGURES

Nearly a quarter of poor people rise above poverty in a given year, but they 
are replaced by an almost equal number of people who fall below the poverty 
level, the Census Bureau said today. 
</P>
<P>
"Although the majority of persons who were poor in 1985 were still poor the 
following year, 23.8% of poor persons in 1985 were not poor by 1986," the 
bureau said in a new report, "Transitions in Income and Poverty Status: 
1985-86." 
</P>
<P>
It said the figures for those moving out of poverty in 1986 were about the same 
as the exit rate for 1984-85. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though a significant fraction of the 1985 poverty population was able to 
exit poverty in the following year, the total number of poor persons in 1986 
was not significantly different from the 1985 figure," the study said. 
</P>
<P>
The length of poverty "spells" and their causes -- changes in income, family 
composition and other factors -- have been critical issues in the debate over 
anti-poverty strategies. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the poverty threshold for a family of four was $11,203. 
</P>
<P>
The bureau said its study seems to indicate that "a substantial economic or 
household composition change rather than a minor fluctuation in income was the 
cause of the poverty status change for the majority . . . who entered and 
exited poverty between 1985 and 1986." 
</P>
<P>
The report also said that poor people who were white were significantly more 
likely than blacks or Latinos to exit poverty between 1985 and 1986. About 
28.3% of whites who were poor in 1985 rose above the poverty level in 1986, 
compared with 16.5% of blacks and 14.8% of Latinos.

CONGRESSMEN TELL SHAMIR OF STRAINS IN ISRAEL'S IMAGE IN U.S.

Visiting U.S. congressmen told Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir today that 
Israel's image among Americans had been damaged by lack of progress toward 
peace in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir's office said Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Reps. 
</P>
<P>
Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), Larry Smith (D-Fla.)(D- and Eliot L. Engel 
(D-N.Y.) reported that congressional support for Israel remained firm but that 
public backing had waned. 
</P>
<P>
U.S.-Israeli relations have been badly strained by Israel's failure to open 
talks with Palestinians, as proposed by Secretary of State James A. Baker III. 
Shamir's new right-wing government has set tough conditions for negotiations 
with Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir said violence was down in the 30-month-old uprising in the occupied 
territories because the United States suspended talks with the Palestine 
Liberation Organization after an abortive raid on Israeli beaches in May.

Contractors will be laying cobblestone streets again as part of a 
reconstruction project in Manhattan's SoHo Cast Iron Historic District, the 
city announced today. 
</P>
<P>
The city will spend $11 million during the next two years to rebuild Greene and 
Mercer streets. 
</P>
<P>
The work will include new sewers, water mains, catch basins, street signs and 
traffic lights, the Transportation Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Because the district was designated a landmark area in 1973, the project will 
include distinctive street lights and fire hydrants and the existing 
cobblestone roadways will be restored by hand. 
</P>
<P>
"It's worth a few extra dollars to maintain the quality of the neighborhood," 
department spokesman Joseph DePlasco said. 
</P>
<P>
About 85% of the funding is coming from the federal government, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The landmark area contains the largest collection of full and partial cast-iron 
facades in the world and retains much of the character of a 19th-Century 
commercial district.

ARCHITECTS INSTITUTE HIT BY U.S. ANTITRUST SUIT

The American Institute of Architects violated antitrust laws by illegally 
restraining trade, the Justice Department said today in a civil antitrust suit. 
</P>
<P>
The group "unreasonably restrained price competition in the sale of 
architectural services," the Justice Department said. 
</P>
<P>
The industry trade group that represents many architects in America signed a 
settlement agreement with the Justice Department that was filed simultaneously 
in U.S. District Court. 
</P>
<P>
A federal judge will have to review the government's suit and the consent 
decree, and decide whether to accept the proposed settlement. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department said that about 54,000 architects belong to the trade 
group and that the AIA "entered into an unlawful agreement" to prohibit members 
from providing free services, engaging in competitive bidding and discounting 
their fees. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the proposed settlement with the government, the architectural trade 
group must "institute a comprehensive antitrust compliance program" during the 
next decade, the Justice Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Further antitrust violations "may result in disciplinary measures and charges 
of criminal contempt," the Justice Department said. 
</P>
<P>
It is not the first time the American Institute of Architects has been cited 
for violation of America's antitrust laws. In 1972, a "final judgment" was 
entered against the group for antitrust violations, the Justice Department 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed consent decree "supersedes" the 1972 order, the Justice Department 
said.

Restaurant chain operators Kyotaru Co. said today that it has purchased Best 
Western Food Inc., a meat-processing company based in Los Angeles, for $41.26 
million to supply beef for the Japanese market. 
</P>
<P>
Japan, under pressure from the United States, agreed in 1988 to drop quotas on 
imported beef products by April 1, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
In response, Japanese food companies have been actively buying ranches overseas 
to continue to supply beef to their customers through Japanese sources. 
</P>
<P>
Best Western will supply beef to the Kyotaru restaurant chain, according to 
reports in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun and the Kyodo News Service. 
</P>
<P>
Kyotaru spokesman Masakazu Yoda said the company has not decided if it will 
import beef for other distribution purposes through Best Western. 
</P>
<P>
Yoda said that Robert Wiviodt, Best Western's president, has been replaced but 
that other management-level employees will remain with the company. 
</P>
<P>
Best Western had sales of $66.13 million in 1989, according to Kyotaru.

About 400 children were treated for heat exhaustion and hyperventilation after 
waiting for hours in the sun to see the group the New Kids on the Block. 
</P>
<P>
About 35,000 youngsters streamed onto Harriet Island for a concert Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Many waited more than eight hours with little food and drink in hopes of 
getting a good view of the popular performers. 
</P>
<P>
Police estimate that about 4,000 teen-agers entered the gates at 11 a.m., and 
about 20,000 had arrived by 3 p.m. Opening groups began playing for the crowd 
at 7 p.m., and the New Kids took the stage at 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Although the temperature was only in the upper 70s, the crowded conditions 
apparently contributed to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so hot out there, and the only time you could breathe fresh air was 
when a breeze blew over. It was so crowded," said Angela Frank, 15, of Cloquet. 
</P>
<P>
Terri Nelson, who worked as coordinator of the Red Cross tent, said there was a 
steady flow of visitors. Five people required hospitalization, authorities 
said.

5 PARIS ART MUSEUMS SHUT DOORS AMID THEFTS

Five Paris art museums closed their doors today to individual visitors after 
paintings were stolen from three museums, including a Renoir cut out of its 
frame at the Louvre, over a span of several hours. 
</P>
<P>
Jacques Sallois, director of national museums, said security will be tightened 
at the city's major museums, which remained open. He refused to say what 
measures will be taken. 
</P>
<P>
The museums closed to individuals are relatively small and focus on the works 
or the collections of a particular individual -- the Eugene Delacroix, Gustave 
Moreau, Jean-Jacques Henner, Hebert and Ennery museums. 
</P>
<P>
Sallois' unprecedented announcement came shortly after police revealed that a 
third museum had suffered a theft during the short time span Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Police said it was possible all three thefts were committed by the same person 
or group, moving across the city center from one museum to another. 
</P>
<P>
According to investigators, the theft revealed today apparently was the first 
to occur in the series. 
</P>
<P>
An 1816 work by French landscape painter Paul Huet was lifted off its hook 
Wednesday morning at the Carnavalet Museum, a historical museum in one of the 
oldest sections of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
The painting, "Les Moulins de la Glaciere," was estimated to be worth about 
$14,500. 
</P>
<P>
The other two stolen paintings were cut from their frames -- Renoir's "Portrait 
of a Seated Woman" from the Louvre and Ernest Hebert's "Portrait of Monaluccia" 
from the museum named after the artist. 
</P>
<P>
Both were small format paintings, a type often chosen by thieves because they 
can be easily concealed. 
</P>
<P>
"Portrait of a Seated Woman" (1890-1895), measures 13.5 by 10.5 inches. 
Hebert's work, painted about 1870, measures 14 by 12 inches. 
</P>
<P>
The theft of the Renoir was discovered about 2:15 p.m., officials said. The 
Hebert was discovered missing from the Hebert Museum, across the Seine River on 
the Left Bank, about an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
All three victimized museums are run by the government. 
</P>
<P>
Officials gave no estimates of the value of the Renoir and Hebert. Independent 
experts suggested a possible value of $300,000 to $600,000 for the Renoir, but 
said it was impossible to give a precise valuation and noted that Renoir had 
done scores of portraits of women in his later years. 
</P>
<P>
The Louvre's director, Michel Laclotte, said the theft of "Portrait of a Seated 
Woman" appeared to be the work of an "especially clever" professional. 
</P>
<P>
"The canvas was very thin, the cutting instrument was probably extremely sharp 
and caused so few vibrations that the electronic sensor did not pick them up," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Laclotte led reporters to the spot where the portrait had been hanging -- an 
isolated stairwell leading to the Denon Gallery, on the top floor of the 
Pavillon de Flore overlooking the Seine. 
</P>
<P>
Head painting curator Pierre Rosenberg said the Renoir had been on display in 
the stairwell for several years, due to renovations in other sections of the 
museum, once a royal palace. It was donated to the Louvre in 1961 by French 
collector Victor Lion. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg said Renoir is a "magic name" among art lovers, which could explain 
the theft -- the first at the Louvre in more than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Sallois said there is no evidence of negligence on the part of museum guards.

Frank Sinatra celebrated American Independence Day by performing in the country 
that still sometimes thinks of the United States as "the colonies." 
</P>
<P>
"I asked my agent if it was smart to book an act in London on July 4," the 
74-year-old Sinatra said during his show Wednesday night at London Arena. 
</P>
<P>
The audience laughed and applauded warmly as Sinatra broke into the opening 
bars of "Strangers in the Night." 
</P>
<P>
For more than an hour, Sinatra sang his favorite tunes, including "My Way," 
"New York, New York" and "A Foggy Day in London Town." He sipped a glass of 
bourbon between songs, stopping at one point to toast the bandleader -- his 
son, Frank Sinatra Jr.

FIGNON COULD NOT HAVE WON TOUR -- LEMOND

<P>
Tour de France defending champion Greg LeMond said today that the withdrawal of 
archrival Laurent Fignon will make no difference in the result. 
</P>
<P>
"It does not change anything. I knew from the very first day that he was not in 
a shape to win the Tour," the American two-time Tour de France champion said. 
</P>
<P>
Fignon, who won in 1983 and '84 and who lost to LeMond by eight seconds last 
year, quit the race during Wednesday's fifth stage from Avranches to Rouen, 
suffering from an ankle strain. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if he really suffered that much. But it is difficult to stand a 
race like the Tour mentally if you know you're not at your best. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry for him, even if he has not been very kind to me lately," LeMond 
said before boarding the plane taking the 195 riders from Deauville to 
Sarrebourg for Friday's 126-mile sixth stage. 
</P>
<P>
The ever-relaxed Californian felt that he was still the favorite to win 
cycling's most prestigious title, despite the fine performance by his Canadian 
friend Steve Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
Bauer has a 10-minute lead over all the field except four riders after a 
surprise breakaway in the first stage. LeMond is among those 10 minutes behind. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy for Steve. He is a great friend of mine and the fact that he wears 
the yellow jersey and runs for an American team will do a lot of good to 
cycling in America," LeMond said. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond said he was confident he could make up for lost time in Saturday's 
38-mile time trial from Vittel to Epinal, which is expected to be the first 
real test of the race. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope to recover two or three minutes over Steve, who is not supposed to be a 
great time trialist," he said. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond, who used a controversial triathlete handlebar to beat Fignon in last 
year's final time trial, said he will be using the revolutionary design again 
in Saturday's stage. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel so comfortable that I could ride a five or six-hour time trial with 
it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The new mono-grip handlebar designed by a skiing manufacturer helped LeMond 
take second place in last Saturday's prologue. 
</P>
<P>
"The handlebar is not just a gadget meant to impress my opponents 
psychologically. Cycling, like skiing, is about gaining seconds and equipment 
is very important," he said. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond's teammate Ronan Pensec stands second overall, 34 second behind Bauer, 
and LeMond said he is ready to help Pensec if the Frenchman has a chance to win 
the Tour. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm still here to win it myself," he said.

ABC TO BID FOR SELECTED GAMES BUT NOT ENTIRE '94 WORLD CUP

<P>
ABC has decided that it will bid for selected games in the 1994 World Cup but 
is not interested in televising the entire tournament. 
</P>
<P>
ABC Sports President Dennis Swanson, attending the Wimbledon tennis 
championships, said the American viewer interest does not justify purchasing 
rights to the entire tournament, which consists of 52 games over four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
NBC said Monday that it will not make a bid for U.S. rights to the 1994 World 
Cup, the first to be held in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Although there isn't that much interest in the U.S., the World Cup is still 
the World Cup," Swanson said Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Turner Broadcasting's TNT Network is showing the 1990 tournament, but fewer 
than 2% of its viewers are watching. Swanson said the 1994 tournament might be 
split between a network and a cable company in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"There are 52 games, and I don't think any network will be interested in that," 
he said. "But if the financial deal is right, we would be interested in a few 
games." 
</P>
<P>
Turner paid about $7.5 million for rights to this year's tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"Cable had the entire deal this World Cup, and that very well might happen 
again," Swanson said. 
</P>

ABC broadcast the final of the 1982 tournament in Spain.

SHOOT-OUT VICTORY BY GERMANS CREATES A WORLD CUP REPEAT

<P>
After 30 days and 50 games, the World Cup tournament is back where it was in 
1986, with West Germany and Argentina playing for the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
Until the semifinals, the teams had progressed in vastly different fashion. The 
Germans were awesome, overpowering nearly everyone with a precise attack, speed 
and strength. The Argentines were lucky, getting by on experience and guile. 
</P>
<P>
Both took the same route through the semis, however. After 1-1 ties, they won 
shoot-outs, 4-3, putting in all four of their penalty kicks while their 
opponents missed the final two. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany made its third straight final, fifth overall, by beating England 
on Wednesday night in Turin. The previous evening, in Naples, the defending 
champion Argentines edged host Italy. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, in Rome, as they did four years ago in Mexico City, Carlos Bilardo's 
Argentina plays Franz Beckenbauer's West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"It should be an open game, just like tonight," Beckenbauer said. "It's great 
to have the opportunity to beat Argentina." 
</P>
<P>
"It will be like a chess game, with a lot of marking in the midfield. Whoever 
makes a mistake will lose," Bilardo said. "The bottom line is that if we want 
to be world champions, we have to beat everybody." 
</P>
<P>
It will be the third final in the last four World Cups for Argentina, seeking 
to equal Brazil's record of winning three of four. The Germans are the first to 
make three straight finals. 
</P>
<P>
But they aren't getting cocky about it. 
</P>
<P>
"The match was more difficult than expected. We can't remember such a good and 
dramatic match as this one," Beckenbauer said. "Both teams had reached their 
peak. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It was advertising for soccer. All 120 minutes were played to full tempo, and 
England played a great game." 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time England did so in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"We get told we play medieval, old-fashioned football," Manager Bobby Robson 
said. "We have shown, with all our players, that our game hasn't gone back at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't be more proud. We can go back home in honor. We always played 
sensibly, we've done our best and that's all we can ask." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps they could have asked for more success in the shoot-out. The English 
came up with a late goal for the third straight game, with Gary Lineker scoring 
his third in two games on a defensive mistake with 10 minutes remaining. That 
offset Andreas Brehme's shot that nicked the leg of defender Paul Parker and 
soared over goalie Peter Shilton in the 59th minute. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams hit the goal post in the overtime, and then came the shoot-out. 
</P>
<P>
"I prefer you play until a team scores the first goal," Robson said. "Someone 
is going to crack and a goal will be scored. . . . I feel at this level, with 
this importance, I say we play on." 
</P>
<P>
Sounds like a loser in the shoot-out, doesn't it? 
</P>
<P>
"There has been no better way, no better solution reached yet, for breaking 
draws," Beckenbauer said. "Certainly, it beats the flip of a coin." 
</P>
<P>
Sounds like a winner, of course. 
</P>
<P>
The shoot-out featured 23-year-old German goalie Bodo Illgner, in his first 
World Cup, against 40-year-old Shilton, the record holder for international 
appearances. It was Illgner who had the magic, however. 
</P>
<P>
Shilton just missed on several of West Germany's shots, but could not stop 
Brehme, Lothar Matthaeus, Karlheinz Riedle and Olaf Thon. 
</P>
<P>
England's Lineker, Peter Beardsley and David Platt made their kicks before 
Stuart Pearce shot right at Illgner. He stopped it with his feet. 
</P>
<P>
When Chris Waddle missed high and wide, the Germans were in their fifth final. 
They won in 1954 and 1974, lost in 1982 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"The game could have been decided in the first 90 minutes, but the match was 
such a battle that it seemed it had to go to penalties," Matthaeus said. "We 
were lucky." 
</P>
<P>
They also are lucky to be facing a depleted Argentina in the final. Four 
Argentines -- midfielder Ricardo Giusti with a red card, midfielder Sergio 
Batista, defender Julio Olarticoechea and forward Claudio Caniggia with two 
yellow cards -- are suspended. 
</P>
<P>
"The panorama is black," Bilardo said. 
</P>
<P>
The panorama wasn't very bright outside the stadium in Turin. Before the game, 
two incidents involving English, Italian and German fans resulted in the arrest 
of 43 Italians and the stabbing of a German in the back. The victim underwent 
surgery, and doctors estimated that he will need a month to recover. 
</P>
<P>
There were some minor skirmishes early this morning, but no arrests or injuries 
were reported.

started slowly, since to eat a flower seemed odd to me, maybe even taboo. I 
remember eating rice garnished with calendula petals in Vermont and thinking 
they made the dish colorful but didn't add much to the flavor. Later I tried a 
few pansy petals in a restaurant salad and still wasn't won over. 
</P>
<P>
Not until I tasted lavender ice cream at an herb seminar did I become really 
enthusiastic. It was fantastic. Obviously my indifference had overlooked a 
whole aspect of cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Since becoming involved with edible flowers I've read everything I could find 
about them. I've asked all the chefs I've interviewed about their experiences 
with them. And I've tasted, tasted and retasted every edible flower I could get 
my hands on, even stoping on occasion to taking a bite out of my hostess' 
centerpiece. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, a few words of caution are needed here before we delve into the many 
apsects of flower cookery. Unless you have spent much time working with toxic 
plants or are familiar with texts on edible and poisonous plants, be very 
conservative as to which new edible flowers you try. I've seen much shoddy 
scholarship and numerous "iffy" recipes, even cookbooks that recommend you cook 
with poisonous flowers like lily-of-the-valley and rhododendrons. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the only list I trust is the one I've researched and given below. It 
represents countless hours in herbariums, poison labs and botanical libraries. 
In addition, not only must you limit floewr cookery to proven edible species, 
but it is most important that you only use flowers when you know how they have 
been grown. Numerous toxic pesticides, not for human consumption, can be used 
on flowers. 
</P>
<P>
These two cautions aisde, cooking with edible floers is filled with delights. 
So let's look at the many wyas they can be enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
The primary contribution flowers make in the kitchen is indisputably decorative 
-- their colors and shapes are spectacular additions to many dishes. 
Americancooks are thinking more and more about how food is presented and are 
subscribing to the belief that beautiful meals are more satisfying than plain 
fare. Consider how festive salads are with a sprinkling of nasturtiums instead 
of hum-drum red cabbage, and how about a runner bean blossom on the cream soup 
instead of tired old parsley. Or for an alternative to the usual frosting 
flowers on a birthday cake, how about using fresh or candied rose petals? 
</P>
<P>
But eye appeal is not the only virtue of edible flowers. Many actually give us 
new flavors to cook with. Consider the rich, aromatic flavors of roses, 
lavender or anise hyssop. These under-utilized flavors are a suseful as the 
more familiar ones with which we enrich our cooking. 
</P>
<P>
But before you start using edible flowers to any degree, it's helpful for both 
cook and diner to learn a few basics. How are the flowers prepard for cooking? 
What parts are edible? Which flowers go with which dishes? 
</P>
<P>
Let's begin with the question of preparation. Start by choosing flowers from 
the list provided below and tasting them to see if you like them. Flowers have 
not been bred for eating and not all varieties of the same flower taste equally 
good. This step seems obvious but I've been served some pretty unpalatable 
flowers throughout the years -- I'm sure the cooks hadn't tasted them before 
serving. 
</P>
<P>
Once selected, flowers are easy to prepare. Pick them in the cool of the day, 
preferably morning. Put those with long stems in water and refrigerate; pick 
short-stemmed blossoms, such as borage, within a few hours of using and place 
them between layers of damp paper towels and refrigerate. Flowers, of course, 
are perishable and will wilt in a warm place. And they'll bruise almost 
instantly if they're roughly handled. 
</P>
<P>
Most cooks gently wash flowers before using them. While washing flowers look 
for "critters," such as baby slugs and aphids that might be hiding down in 
petals; there are more places for them to hide in flowers than in vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
With some flowers -- such as roses, claendulas, chrysanthemums and lavender -- 
?only the petals are edible. With others -- Johnny-jump-ups, violets, 
nastrutiums and runner bean blossoms -- the whole flower can be eaten. If you 
are using only the petals of a flower, separate them just befores erving as 
they will wilt within minutes. In addition, if you're using the flowers on a 
salad, add the flowers after the dressing as its weight will compress them into 
a lump. 
</P>
<P>
Some flowers, such as roses and dianthus, have a white portion at the bsae of 
the petal that can be quite bitter and metallic. If the flowers you are using 
have such an area, remove it. Also remove the stamens of squash blossoms. 
</P>
<P>
It is ipmortant that the edible floers you use actually fit a dish. While it's 
not an absolute rule, sweet- and floral-tasting flowers are best suited to 
desserts and fruit dishes, while savory types are wonderful with dips, soups, 
salads and entrees. Examples of the latter are chive blossoms in sandwiches and 
on onion dishes and nasturtiums in salads. The sweet floral taste of roses and 
violets goes well with cakes, sorbets and pies. 
</P>
<P>
A spectacular and easy edible flower technique is to make petal confetti. Just 
before serving, remove the petals of calendulas, pinks, rosemary, 
Johnny-jump-ups, violas,miniature roses and/or lavender, and srinkle them over 
salads, soups, cakes, crepes or any dish where you want a "show-off" 
presentation. 
</P>
<P>
The world of flower cookery is boundless. Soon you'll be flower-fluent and 
using thin slices of squash blossom in omelettes or sprinkled over clear soups. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LIST OF EDIBLE FLOWERS 
</P>
<P>
In my opinion, the following edible flowers are the tastiest and most versatie. 
Of more importance, there is much documentation that these flowers have been 
eaten for centuries -- it's unlikely further research will reveal problems. 
Caution: As the chemicals used on flowers are often very toxic, eat only 
unsprayed flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Chives (Allium Schoenoprasum and A. tuberosum) -- Onion flavor, use when buds 
first open or they will be papery and tough; try in potato and egg salads, in 
butters and salads. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum X morifolium) -- The petals of chrysanthemums 
range from slightly to very bitter; use sparingly over salads, in floral 
confetti or as a garnish.Elderberry (Sambucus caerulea) -- Fritters have been a 
traditional way to prepare the blossoms. Make sure you identify species; some 
are poisonous. 
</P>
<P>
Geranium (Pelargonium spp.) -- Rose-scented varities superior to common 
geraniums in flavor; use in sorbets, butters and as garnishes. 
</P>
<P>
Herbs -- Research indicates that herb floewrs are edible. Of particular 
culinary interest are the flowers of thyme, basil, rosemary, arugula, fennel 
and sage; use in salads, butter, marinade and as garnishes. 
</P>
<P>
Lavender (Lavandula aungfustifolia) -- English lavender has a sweet, strong 
lemon-floral taste superior for cooking; great in marinades, salad dressings, 
sorbets and ice creams. 
</P>
<P>
Nasturtium (Tropaeolum maius) -- Watercress-type flavor, one of the most 
versatile and widely accepted edible floers; try in salads, butters, stuffed 
and as garnishes. 
</P>
<P>
Pink (Dianthus spp.) -- Generally the classic cottage pinks have the best clove 
flavor; good in sorbets, butters and salads. 
</P>
<P>
Rose (Rosa spp.) -- Diverse flavors from floral and lush to metallic, taste to 
test; Rugosa Alba, Egalantine and damask types are choice in salads, butters, 
vinegar, floral confetti and candied. 
</P>
<P>
Viola, Pansy and Johnny-Jump-Ups (Viola cornuta, V. wittrokiana and V. 
tricolor) -- Light floral flavor; little difference in taste, nice in salads 
and floral confetti. 
</P>
<P>
Violet (Viola odorata) -- Strong floral taste, great candied or in salads.

<P>
So you saw "Great Balls of Fire" when it came out last year. Frisky fellow, 
that Jerry Lee Lewis. Apple-cheeked and yellow haired, full of those boyish 
high spirits. Practically a puppy dog. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Hollywood took a good, long look at Jerry Lee, and it blinked. Flipper 
bears a closer resemblance to Moby Dick than Dennis Quaid's screen 
interpretation bore to the real Jerry Lee. 
</P>
<P>
My own face-to-face brush with the Killer came three years ago in a stadium 
dressing room. I was a complete stranger being introduced to him for the first 
time. And I happened to have a set of binoculars dangling from a strap around 
my neck. The first thing Lewis said when we were introduced wasn't "How do you 
do?" It was: "How would you like it if I took those binoculars and rammed them 
right back through your eyeballs?" 
</P>
<P>
I allowed, as calmly and pleasantly as I could, that I probably wouldn't care 
for it very much. This, after all, was the man who once shot his own bass 
player in the stomach, who turned up outside Graceland waving a gun and 
hollering for Elvis Presley to come out, who -- well, the stories are endless. 
Jerry Lee Lewis is a character more worthy of a Faulkner novel than Hollywood 
entertainment, a force of warped nature and ever-surging ego who is liable to 
do or say anything. He is also a rock 'n' roll wonder, an American original 
whose combination of orneriness and dementia have kept him burning through the 
most haphazard career imaginable. 
</P>
<P>
The Ferriday, La., native took off like a meteor in 1957 and '58 with his 
piano-pounding Sun Records hits, "Whole Lot of Shakin' Going On," "Great Balls 
of Fire" and "Breathless." Then a scornful world found out about his marriage 
to his 13-year-old cousin, and the meteor crashed. Ever dogged, Lewis rocked on 
out of the limelight until 1968, when he was embraced by country music fans, 
racking up a series of hits that brought him into the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Not even a couple of near-fatal illnesses that led to the extraction of a fair 
section of his innards has stopped Lewis' drive. Last year he re-recorded his 
oldies for the "Great Balls of Fire" soundtrack. Now, at 55, he's back with two 
cuts on an album of music from the "Dick Tracy" film. 
</P>
<P>
My encounter with Jerry Lee ended with a handshake, rather than a pair of black 
eyes. He saved his aggression that day for the place where he hones it into 
spontaneous outbursts of primal rock -- at the keyboard of his blazing 88. 
</P>

THE CROSS-FIRE OF IDEAS; 
</P>
<P>
GEORGE STONE'S COMPLEX INSTALLATION IS SHOT THROUGH WITH HARMONIOUS AND WARRING 
NOTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES ORANGE COUNTY ART CRITIC 
</P>

<P>
Who's double-crossed by "DOUBLE CROSS," George Stone's installation at the 
Laguna Art Museum's South Coast Plaza satellite? It's hard to say, exactly. But 
the piece -- much more complex than it may appear at first sight -- is riddled 
with the cross-fire of harmonious and warring ideas. 
</P>
<P>
In the first room of the installation -- the full name of which is "DOUBLE 
CROSS: 1 (picture) 1,000 (words)" -- a cruciform plexiglass case holds rows of 
blank books, their pages blown by a phalanx of small, whirring fans. There also 
is a large color photograph of a flame. 
</P>
<P>
The second room, partitioned into a cross shape, is dark except for a set of 
moving spotlights that pause on one or more of the words inscribed on the walls 
in neat floor-to-ceiling rows. 
</P>
<P>
Stone, a Los Angeles artist, has supplied himself with some heavyweight 
symbolic devices -- the cross shape, the flame, the light in the darkness and 
the books. Clearly he expects a lot of them. 
</P>
<P>
One thought that comes to mind: The Middle Ages once were known as the Dark 
Ages, when the church kept the "flame" of knowledge alight in monasteries. 
</P>
<P>
But the image of the flame also suggests the mass torching of books by zealous 
censors during periods of conservative backlash. In the United States today, 
the impetus for censorship comes largely from the religious right. 
</P>
<P>
The actions of preserving and destroying the written word -- God's or not -- 
can both be related to Christianity; thus, the relevance of the double symbol 
of the cross in the installation. 
</P>
<P>
But, unless the cliched title phrase is simply a ruse to throw us off, Stone 
also seems to be saying that we've come to value the word too much and the 
image too little. This argument seems to be relevant primarily to contemporary 
art, in which texts have assumed a starring role formerly claimed only by 
images, and critical commentary has become a necessary guide to understanding 
the work. Possibly Stone views this state of affairs as "double-crossing" the 
viewer. 
</P>
<P>
If that's so, it's ironic that his own art relies so heavily on the role of 
interpretation -- and on the display of words almost as objects in their own 
right. An overload of heavily charged symbolism gives the piece a certain 
intellectual fuzziness. Still, Stone's piece is nothing if not teasingly 
provocative. And it certainly is refreshing to accuse an artist of packing his 
work with too many ideas. Too often, the problem is the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
What: "DOUBLE CROSS: 1 (picture) 1,000 (words)," an installation by George 
Stone. 
</P>
<P>
When: Sundays through Wednesdays from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays 
till 9 p.m.; Saturdays from 10 to 5, through Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Where: The Laguna Art Museum's South Coast Plaza satellite, 3333 Bristol St.,

KID STUFF: STARTING WEDNESDAY, COSTA MESA'S A FAIR PLACE TO PIG OUT

In the dark days before Nintendo and mega-malls, the opening of the county fair 
found Pa hitching up the wagon and Ma spiffing up the kids in their Sunday best 
for a day of family fun. It was a day to forget the chores, eat too many candy 
apples and generally kick up your heels. 
</P>
<P>
Times have changed, but not much. Families visiting the 98th annual Orange 
County Fair, which opens next Wednesday, are more likely to sport Bart Simpson 
T-shirts than calico, but what lies beyond the fair gates is pure country fun, 
Orange County style. The fair continues daily through July 22. 
</P>
<P>
Under the theme "Very Berry Extraordinary," this year's event salutes the 
county's strawberry industry with a strawberry pie-eating contest and, for 
those 2 to 12, the Strawberry Jello Squeeze, a genteel little game in which the 
players squirt gobs of the jiggly stuff at a target, and possibly each other. 
</P>
<P>
Do your youngsters have a passion for pigs? The fair also honors our porcine 
pals: Children can take part in the Pig Root Race, the Eat-Like-the Piggies-Do 
contest and the Pin-the-Tail-on-the-Piggy game. Presiding over all the fun will 
be the fair's 350-pound mascot, Shortcake, a congenial Yorkshire crossbreed pig 
who will greet visitors from her pen on the livestock grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Shortcake will have plenty of company. Nearly 1,000 animals will be on display 
-- steer, sheep, rabbits, chickens and, of course, more pigs -- many of them 
raised by area 4-Hand Future Farmers of America youth groups. (Watching the 
young competitors bathe, powder and otherwise primp their animals for exhibit 
can be a show in itself.) Children also can mingle with with deer, ducks, 
goats, antelope, llama and more at the Great American Petting Zoo, every day 
from noon to 9. 
</P>
<P>
What's a fair without a Midway? B&amp;B Amusements handles the thrills and 
chills here with more than 50 rides ranging from the warp-speed Global Wheel to 
the Orbiter, an "alien ship" in which weightlessness is simulated. Tamer 
attractions include elephant rides, a carousel and a "kiddie carnival" for 
preschoolers. 
</P>
<P>
Children's entertainers will roam the grounds, or play the fair's many 
permanent stages. There'll be unicycle-riding mime Mark Wenzel, Veekay the 
Clown, the Ken Ashley Puppets and the Mitchell Marionettes. Older kids may 
enjoy bike and skateboard stunts emceed by "America's Skateboard Mom," and the 
Earl Marcellus International Lumberjack Show, a hair-raising display of logging 
skills. The two-man Swan Brothers Circus combines comedy, music, magic and 
juggling in three shows daily, and a parade will wind its way through the main 
grounds each evening at six. 
</P>
<P>
During Kids' Days, July 13 and 20, children 12 and under will be admitted free 
and can ride all attractions for just 75 cents a pop. A special schedule of 
games and activities is planned for those days as well. 
</P>
<P>
What: The Orange County Fair. 
</P>
<P>
When: July 11-22. Noon to midnight Mondays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 
midnight Fridays through Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
Where: The Orange County Fairground, Newport Boulevard and Fair Drive, Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Whereabouts: The southern end of the Costa Mesa Freeway, where it turns into 
Newport Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Wherewithal: $5 for adults, $3 for seniors, $2 for children 6-12, free for 
children under 6. All children under 12 will be admitted free on Kids' Days, 
July 13 and 20.

THEATER; 
</P>
<P>
IN IRVINE, A 'BREL' TO BE JEALOUS OF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
On the strength of just one show -- the musical revue "Jacques Brel Is Alive 
and Well and Living in Paris" -- the Backstage Theatre has vaulted to the front 
rank of the Orange County theatrical scene. 
</P>
<P>
This heartfelt production possesses such charm, talent and style that it could 
be the envy of any small professional company in Los Angeles, Chicago or New 
York. Theatergoers in this county are lucky to have it. The show closes 
Saturday, so hurry. 
</P>
<P>
As directed by Al Valletta, the superb ensemble -- Tom Hafner, Rowanne Mark, 
Bil Barratt and Christie Cooke -- displays a streety, continental flair that is 
neither too polished nor too sentimental. They bring an inviting natural 
quality to their performances; they don't try to overwhelm their songs with 
glib show-biz glitz. And their energy never flags. 
</P>
<P>
"Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well . . . " debuted in Greenwich Village a 
quarter-century ago and has been revived frequently ever since. Brel, who died 
in 1977 at age 49, was a popular Belgian troubadour of the '60s whose clever 
songs evoke a variety of moods, from sentimental to satiric, bawdy to bucolic. 
</P>
<P>
The Backstage version of the revue -- a nonstop songfest of 23 Brel tunes -- is 
a wonderfully intimate affair, performed on a low stage against a painted 
backdrop of pastel pinks and blues depicting the dockside Cafe de la Fontaine 
and an adjacent seascape. The only props are a bench, a platform and a handful 
of low-tech glitter, abetted by the atmospheric orange glow of the stage 
lighting. 
</P>
<P>
The performers sing to taped accompaniment that sounds surprisingly vibrant. 
They also wear lapel mikes, which seem unnecessary at such close quarters. But 
even in the one instance when vocal amplification is evident, it is 
unobtrusive. 
</P>
<P>
What: "Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris." 
</P>
<P>
When: Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Where: The Backstage Theatre, 2691 Richter Ave., Suite 105, Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Whereabouts: San Diego Freeway to Jamboree Road exit, head north to Richter. 
</P>
<P>
Wherewithal: $12.50.

You're tired of those brass-rail-and-fern joints owned by some huge 
conglomerate and filled with guys in gray business suits talking about 
lease-back deals. You need something down-home. 
</P>
<P>
You need something funky. 
</P>
<P>
You need Villa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
Located off Newport Boulevard, just behind the fabulous Dick's Horseshoe 
Saloon, the Villa is the sort of place you want to take three or four friends, 
scarf up some excellent nachos and drink some very reasonably priced and 
generous-on-the-good-stuff margaritas. The reason for these moderate prices? 
Simple. This place is a dump. But it's a nice dump, a homey dump, the sort of 
place where the neighborhood folk throw birthday parties. 
</P>
<P>
There's a tiny bar that's usually full, country and Western music, and a dining 
room with saggy seats. The albondigas soup is really good, and everything's 
cheap. You want fancy stuff, go to Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
On a scale of 10, give it a seven for the cheap eats and for Reynan, your 
friendly proprietor. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Margarita, 103 Santa Isabel Ave., Costa Mesa. Open daily, 4 p.m. to 
midnight, weekends till 2 a.m. (714) 631-6602.

MAX JACOBSON: CHANTECLAIR LOOKS BETTER THAN IT TASTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Chanteclair is a French country inn that landed, as if by magic, across the 
street from the John Wayne Airport a few years back -- a beautifully designed 
theme restaurant of almost otherworldly beauty. The operative word, however, is 
"almost." 
</P>
<P>
You enter through a welcoming sitting room where you can relax in very 
civilized fashion on one of the elegantly upholstered sofas until your table is 
ready. From there, a dapper-looking captain guides you to one of the many 
charming dining areas, each done in a different motif. 
</P>
<P>
For lunch you might want to book a table in the atrium, a plant-filled room 
flooded with a soft radiance from the overhead skylight. With its pink 
tablecloths, green-cushioned chairs and all those plants, this room is so lush 
and exotic that Henri Rousseau could have painted a jungle scene there. 
</P>
<P>
At dinner time you may want to sit in the Grand Salon, positioned smartly at 
tables decked in proper white linen, surrounded by Louis Quinze blue-and-white 
wallpaper. Prop yourself up on the noble, high-backed chairs, and feel 
resplendent. For a moment, you'll think you're in the royal catbird seat. 
</P>
<P>
But the moment passes quickly. No matter how dapper the waiters or how idyllic 
the setting, you've come here to eat, and that is something which, at present, 
you're not likely to do well at Chanteclair. 
</P>
<P>
There's really no good excuse, either. The restaurant recently passed into the 
hands of the W. R. Grace Corp., which also owns the El Torito restaurants. 
Grace has made at least one smart move in retaining the services of Byron 
Gemmell, the talented chef who until recently was turning out some of the 
county's best foie gras and sauces at the now-defunct Gemmell's in Costa Mesa. 
Gemmell is a classically trained fellow (his teacher was none other than the 
late master chef Jean Bertranou of West Hollywood's L'Ermitage) and his 
capability is beyond reproach. That's why it's annoying to report that this 
restaurant has such a long way to go. 
</P>
<P>
Gemmell isn't really doing the cooking, you see. Grace has been using him in a 
supervisory capacity, as a trainer and consultant. And so far, it looks as if 
his talents are being wasted. The menu hasn't changed much since Gemmell came 
aboard (although I'm told changes are planned). Meanwhile, the cooking doesn't 
nearly measure up to anything with which this chef has been associated in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
One has to wonder how the corporate yoke weighs on Gemmell's neck here. It felt 
pretty heavy around mine when I was eating the food, especially during my last 
lunch. A friend and I began with a terrible Caesar salad, inexplicably priced 
at nearly $10 (at dinner, a better Caesar is mixed tableside for $6.50). The 
salad was warm, the greens were limp and there was no discernible taste of 
cheese or anchovy. I sent it back to the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
What my friend ordered wasn't much better: a mealy lobster bisque with a watery 
little dollop of creme fraiche on top. If the atrium hadn't been so comfortable 
and relaxing, we might just have packed it in right there. Instead, we nibbled 
on a shrimp salad doused with a vinaigrette that tasted slightly stale. 
</P>
<P>
Next came sauteed shrimp and scallops in sweet red pepper sauce and grilled 
lamb T-bone chops with ratatouille and rosemary polenta. What the dapper 
captain didn't tell us was that the lamb chops also came in a sweet red pepper 
sauce -- the same sweet red pepper sauce as the shrimp! And an unpleasantly 
bitter sauce at that. 
</P>
<P>
Dinner was somewhat better, although far from memorable. One appetizer, a 
simple enough conceit of ahi charred rare, was ill-treated by an insipid 
orange-ginger sauce. Another, a game bird and pistachio pate, had the stamp of 
high-speed food processor all over it: A uniformly mixed loaf, it had the 
texture of Spam. The only appetizer that worked well was quail with wild 
mushroom mousse. Basically a delicate duxelles of the sort Gemmell used to do 
at his namesake restaurant, the mousse was beautifully offset by a good, fresh 
piece of grilled quail. 
</P>
<P>
The main dishes we tried, though, mostly lacked style. The class of the field 
was sea bass, a perfectly cooked piece of fish in a tomato-Chardonnay 
reduction, redolent of herbs and saffron. The firm and buttery fish had a 
mysterious flavor distantly reminiscent of North Africa. One would have sworn 
it had been prepared in a different kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Crispy duck and sweetbreads, however, were more symptomatic of the restaurant's 
flaws. The first-rate Muscovy duck breast had been crisped to a frazzle, then 
smothered in a sticky-sweet cherry sauce. The sweetbreads, blessed with an 
excellent sauce of balsamic vinegar, tomato and basil, were themselves sinewy 
rather than meltingly tender, as if they had either been stored too long or 
hadn't been quite choice sweetbreads to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
The desserts also seemed exhumed from long storage. They were elaborately 
dished-up affairs sitting glumly in painted pools of sauce, and most had begun 
to melt and run by the time the tray reached our table, like wax effigies in a 
monster movie. The oozing three-layer mocha terrine, in particular, looked as 
if it had been stuck under a broiler for a couple of seconds. 
</P>
<P>
What's painfully obvious through the gloom is that this is a restaurant with 
great potential. It seats 220, is breathtakingly beautiful and has a killer 
location. It seems a shame to waste. 
</P>
<P>
But all we can do for now is wait to see what El Torito decides to do with 
Chanteclair. I'm almost tempted to come back sometime soon and check on the 
progress. Almost. 
</P>
<P>
Chanteclair is moderately expensive. Prices from the dinner menu are as 
follows; appetizers, $6.95 to $15.95, salads and soups, $3.50 to $9.50, 
entrees, $17.50 to $24.95, desserts $5.

There are three more new kids on the block. 
</P>
<P>
* At Mandarin Dock (yes, dock), 24921 Dana Point Harbor Drive in Dana Point, 
owner Karen Lee offers more than a hundred Mandarin and Szechwan dishes, all 
priced between $3.95 and $10.50. Choose the ocean-view patio or the white, teal 
and pink dining room for lunches Mondays through Saturdays, Sunday brunch, or 
dinner nightly. (714) 248-8299. 
</P>
<P>
* Adolfo's Cantina at 858 S. Coast Highway makes Laguna restaurant No. 3 for 
Adolfo and Connie Vides, who also own the Laguna Feast and Adolfo's takeout 
restaurant just up the PCH. The Cantina offers more formal dining with steak, 
chicken and shrimp fajitas, fresh fish plates, homemade tamales and chilis 
rellenos. Top dinner price: $9.95. Lunch and dinner daily. (714) 497-7883. 
</P>
<P>
* At Pescado Poco, 10205 Valley View Blvd. in Cypress, the emphasis is on 
charbroiled fresh halibut, beef, pork, chicken and shrimp. Combos run $3.49 to 
$5.49. It's owned by Jerry Copeland, who was part owner of the Hop, and it's 
open daily for lunch and dinner. (714) 828-3390. 
</P>
<P>
On the move: Mark Zigner's Zeppa has moved from Ocean Front in Newport Beach to 
Fashion Island. Chef Louis Mangianelli and much of the original staff are still 
on board; the menu is similar but with a number of innovations. Call it 
California/northern Italian/Mediterranean with its grilled radicchio salad and 
such pastas as lobster tortellini with tarragon and lemon sauce. Entrees vary 
from grilled salmon with cinnamon basil vinaigrette to rainbow ravioli with sea 
scallops. Lunches are $5 to $10; a la carte dinner entrees are $17 to $21. 
(714) 640-0600. 
</P>
<P>
Nieuport 17 has moved from 17th Street in Santa Ana to 13051 Newport Ave. in 
Tustin, where the just-completed Normandy-style structure has European hunting 
lodge ambience: it's light and bright with clerestories and windows. To the old 
dining favorites (swordfish, tournedos, prime rib), owner Bill Bettis has added 
German and Central European specialties. Open for lunch Monday through Friday 
and nightly for dinners, which are $18 to $20 complete. (714) 731-5130. BEVERLY

AMERICAN 
</P>
<P>
* Crocodile Cafe, Brea Marketplace, 975 E. Birch St., Brea. (714) 529-2233. 
Open Mondays through Thursdays from 11 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.; weekends to 11 p.m. 
$$ 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Smith is doing more than just promoting the new American cuisine; he's 
making it into a populist movement at this small, laughably inexpensive cafe. 
Enjoy wonderful hamburgers grilled over smoking embers of oak, wood-fired 
pizzas with designer toppings, and trendy homemade pastas like fettuccine with 
roasted Pasilla chili. Sip wines while sitting under the 30-foot vinyl 
crocodile. You can bet your Beamer that this restaurant is a good value. 
</P>
<P>
* Knott's Chicken Dinner Restaurant, Knott's Berry Farm, 8039 Beach Blvd., 
Buena Park. (714) 220-5080. Open daily, except Christmas, 7 a.m to 10 p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
 * Disneyland, 1313 N. Harbor Blvd., Anaheim. (714) 999-4565. Hours vary. $$ 
</P>
<P>
 Between them, Knott's Berry Farm and Disneyland feed more mouths than any 
local restaurant ever could hope to, yet their food concessions get 
surprisingly little notice. With regard to Disneyland, it's not surprising: You 
are a captive audience there and the food is mediocre at best. Mrs. Knott's 
Chicken Dinner Restaurant fares much better. You don't even have to enter the 
park to eat there. For $7.95, hungry families can get individual dinners 
consisting of a rhubarb appetizer, a mixed green salad, fried chicken, mashed 
potatoes and country gravy, fresh cabbage seasoned with ham, buttermilk 
biscuits and a choice of pie. Take that, Mickey! 
</P>
<P>
* The Original Pancake House, 1418 E. Lincoln Ave., Anaheim. (714) 693-1390. 
Open Tuesdays through Sundays from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. $ 
</P>
<P>
The Original Pancake House is one of the very best restaurants in Orange 
County. Just ask anyone who has eaten there. All the batters are made with 
sourdough yeast and come straight from the grill -- light, finely textured, and 
complex. The Belgian waffles are eggy and crispy, and the apple pancake, a 
giant golden puff with a cinnamon glaze topping, is one step away from nirvana. 
</P>
<P>
* Revere House, 900 W. 1st St., Tustin. (714) 543-9319. Open Mondays through 
Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m., Sundays from 10:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
Revere House is one of those dark, woody dinner houses that were popular during 
the '50s, and guess what: That's when the place opened. It specializes in 
credible versions of plain old American food -- prime rib, pan-fried chicken, 
turkey with all the trimmings -- all churned out with dependable regularity. 
The menu is enormous and portions are Protean. All entrees come with a choice 
of Caesar or spinach salad. Desserts are the one weak spot, except for the 
tapioca pudding you get for free. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CHINESE 
</P>
<P>
* Dynasty, 9200 Bolsa Ave., No. 215, Westminster. (714) 898-3189. Open Mondays 
through Fridays from 10 a.m. to 9:30 p.m., weekends from 9 a.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
A vast Hong Kong-style restaurant in a Little Saigon shopping mall, Dynasty is 
beginning to strut its stuff. The dining room is now in the hands of the 
capable Tony Lai, a Chinese foodie with Beverly Hills in his resume, and both 
food and service have taken a sharp upturn. Black pepper beef brisket from the 
Page 1 specials menu is extraordinary, and don't miss the first rate kung pao 
dishes, sand dabs with spicy salt, or soy sauce squab. On a menu with 150 
entrees, there is much to choose from. 
</P>
<P>
* Shan-Li Palace, 5634 E. La Palma Ave., Anaheim. (714) 779-1410. Open Mondays 
through Thursdays and Sundays from 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays 
to 10:30 p.m. $ 
</P>
<P>
This Mandarin-style Chinese restaurant is further proof that gentrification is 
spreading like a brush fire. It is nestled snugly in the Anaheim Hills not far 
from the Riverside County line. A few years back, you couldn't have found a 
hamburger stand in these parts. Order the steamed dumplings, despite the fact 
that the waiter may try to discourage you. They are wonderful. Spinach bean 
curd soup tastes as fresh as if the spinach came from out back. Twice-cooked 
pork is fiery and colorful. Moo-shu dishes (minced meats and veggies rolled up 
burrito-style) are terrific. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CONTINENTAL 
</P>
<P>
* The Golden Truffle, 1767 Newport Blvd., Costa Mesa. (714) 645-9858. Open 
Tuesdays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.; Tuesdays through 
Thursdays from 6 to 9:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays to 10 p.m. $$$ 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Truffle is an eccentric restaurant with an eclectic menu that defies 
rhythm or logic. Chef Alan Greeley is whimsical; he cooks for the sheer 
pleasure of it, and it mostly tastes terrific. Bay shrimp cocktail Yucatan is 
like a combination gazpacho-ceviche, with tiny shrimp and chunky pieces of 
avocado, immobilized in a thick, tangy puree of tomato and chili. Broiled 
marinated skirt steak with pinto beans and cactus is a triumph. Nothing else on 
the menu will prepare you for it. There is a wide selection of premium wines 
and bistro-like desserts. The ambiance is relaxed and casual. 
</P>
<P>
* Hastings, in the Anaheim Hilton and Towers, 777 Convention Way, Anaheim. 
(714) 750-4321. Open Mondays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.; Mondays 
through Saturdays from 6 to 10:30 p.m. $$$ 
</P>
<P>
Hastings has good food for a hotel restaurant but other aspects of dining there 
can be annoying; service is particularly spotty and indifferent. The room is 
predictably clubby with the predictable hotel creature comforts. The menu 
features a sumptuous lobster ravioli appetizer, a fine seafood Caesar salad, 
and some highly credible entrees, among them filet mignon that melts in the 
mouth and a great veal. Seafoods are done handsomely. The wine list is 
extensive and intelligent. 
</P>
<P>
* Morell's, in the Irvine Hilton, 17900 Jamboree Road, Irvine. (714) 863-3111. 
Open Mondays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., daily except Sundays 
from 6 to 10 p.m. $$$ 
</P>
<P>
Morell's is one hotel restaurant making an obvious effort to keep up with the 
times, but one still comes away with the impression that institutional 
practices die hard. It's a quietly elegant room done up in various shades of 
pink, and there is a formal quality to the service. Appetizers such as 
sweetbreads and smoked salmon are among the strong suits. Desserts are visual 
stunners. The basically sound main dishes suffer occasionally from a desire to 
impress. 
</P>
<P>
* Sorrento Grill, 370 Glenneyre St., Laguna Beach. (714) 494-8686. Open 
Tuesdays through Saturdays from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 and from 5:30 p.m. to 9.30 
p.m.; Sundays from 5:30 to 9:30 p.m. $$$ 
</P>
<P>
Sorrento Grill is one of the best new restaurants around, a virtual lock for 
local stardom. The restaurant is a high-concept operation and it pushes all the 
right buttons: a stunningly designed open kitchen, postmodern vastness and a 
decibel level even Phillip Glass would object to. The food is wonderful. Young, 
innovative chef Roseanne Ruiz uses the finest ingredients, Chino ranch 
vegetables, carefully selected poultry and fish, and she prepares them with the 
finest olive oil and utmost care. Desserts like an amazing creme brulee are 
brutally rich. Expect lines and unbridled enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FRENCH 
</P>
<P>
* The Pleasant Peasant, 4251 Martingale Way, Newport Beach. (714) 955-2755. 
Open Mondays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.; Mondays through 
Thursdays from 5:30 to 9 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays to 10. $$ 
</P>
<P>
* La Brasserie, 202 S. Main St., Orange. (714) 978-6161. Open Mondays through 
Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.; Mondays through Saturdays from 5 to 10 p.m. 
$$$ 
</P>
<P>
Country French cuisine has a huge audience, but many of the restaurants 
advertising it end up serving much fancier dishes instead. (They can charge 
more that way.) The Pleasant Peasant is reasonably priced, with both soup and 
salad included in the prices of main courses. Stick to lamb and anything 
without sauce here. La Brasserie is a lot pricier but also considerably more 
accomplished. The coq au vin rouge is terrific, as is a wonderful homemade 
chicken liver mousse in aspic. Good desserts and plenty of romance here, too. 
</P>
<P>
* La Vie en Rose, 240 S. State College Blvd., Brea. (714) 529-8333. Open 
Mondays through Saturdays from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and from 6 to 10 p.m. 
$$$ 
</P>
<P>
La Vie en Rose is supposed to be fashioned after a Normandy farmhouse, but the 
building is a masterpiece in kitsch; it looks like a swap meet replica of the 
Mont-St-Michel abbey. Luckily, the food is good. Spinach salad sizzles with 
natural flavor. Salad perigourdine (a simple dish of mixed greens with slices 
of preserved duck and a heady garlic dressing), makes a terrific lunch. Fish is 
prepared with delicacy. The veal chop is wonderful. Service is flawless and 
attentive. The only major drawback is the noise level, which befits, well, a 
swap meet. Moderately expensive. 
</P>
<P>
* Voila Bistro and Grill, 16871 Beach Blvd., Huntington Beach. (714) 841-1166. 
Open Tuesdays through Saturdays from 5 to 10 p.m., Sundays from 4:30 to 9 p.m. 
$$$ 
</P>
<P>
A new local dining spot, Voila Bistro and Grill is a surprising find indeed, a 
combination of Paris casual and Huntington Beach chic. Chef Rochelle Robinson 
turns a brilliant onion soup -- a bistro classic -- and does fine braised duck 
and lamb dishes. Dessert souffles such as chocolate and lemon are on the varied 
menu, and given proper notice the chef will even make a cheese souffle. Salads, 
pizzas and a respectable little wine list fill things out nicely. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INDIAN 
</P>
<P>
* The Clay Oven, 15435 Jeffrey Road, Irvine. (714) 552-2851. Open Tuesdays 
through Sundays from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and from 5:30 to 10:30 p.m. $$$ 
</P>
<P>
The Clay Oven is an Indian restaurant inauspiciously located in a country 
shopping mall and specializing in dishes from the tandoor, the authentic oven 
advertised by the restaurant's name. Fish tikka, here made with chunks of 
broiled swordfish, is downright heavenly, and tandoori chicken, rubbed red with 
a spice mixture and broiled until sizzling, is another winner. There is an 
interesting selection of vegetable dishes, as well. Wash everything down with 
giant bottles of imported Indian beer and lament the fact that most of the 
really exotic specialties you see displayed on the menu won't be available. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INDONESIAN 
</P>
<P>
 * Dewi, 1762 N. Tustin Ave., Orange. (714) 637-1101. Open Tuesdays through 
Saturdays from 11 a.m to 8 p.m. $ 
</P>
<P>
Hurry over -- while there is still time -- to Dewi, a small Indonesian 
restaurant/grocery store hidden among commercial properties along a busy avenue 
in Orange. Nasi rames is a mixed rice plate with a whole cookbook full of 
Indonesian goodies, and the restaurant has fabulous barbecued chicken and hot 
stewed beef dishes. Owner Edith Vredevoogd is constantly preparing little 
snacks like lemper (a sticky rice roll filled with minced chicken) or cendol 
(mysterious green bits taken with crushed ice, syrup and jackfruit). Don't 
despair if you miss the restaurant, though. There is a second Dewi run by Mrs. 
V's brother in Huntington Beach. Exotica at its best. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ITALIAN 
</P>
<P>
* Capriccio Italiano Ristorante, Village Mall, 25380 Marguerite Parkway, 
Mission Viejo. (714) 855-6866. Open Mondays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 
2:30 p.m. and from 4 to 9:30 p.m.; weekends from 4 to 10 p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
Capriccio may mean "whim" in Italian, but there is nothing whimsical about the 
food in this restaurant; it is polished and sophisticated. For my money, it is 
a real find. The kitchen is run by two brothers from Palermo, Sal and Franco 
Maniaci, but there is barely a trace of Sicilian influence in the dishes they 
serve. Appetizers like vitello tonnato and lumache del bosco are marvelous, and 
pastas are fresh and homemade. Many main dishes have French overtones, like a 
stylish lamb rack with truffles and foie gras, or a civet of hare called lepre 
salmi. Cappriccio's location is modest, and so are prices, but its class is 
obvious. 
</P>
<P>
* Ciao, 1730 E. 17th St., Santa Ana. (714) 972-3101. Open Mondays through 
Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. and from 5:30 to 9:30 p.m.; Saturdays from 
4:30 to 9:30 p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
Ciao is one of those indistinct little neighborhood restaurants you can drive 
by 100 times without noticing, but it happens to be an exceptional one. Bina 
Crivello, a Sicilian mater familias who runs the restaurant with the help of 
her five sons, makes most of the food herself: crusty pizzas, earthy pastas, 
and a good rich tomato sauce to go with them. Bring a hefty appetite and leave 
room for the excellent tiramisu -- intense, mocha rich, and drooling mascarpone 
cheese. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
JAPANESE 
</P>
<P>
* Kitayama, 101 Bayview Place, Newport Beach. (714) 725-0777. Open Mondays 
through Fridays from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and from 6 to 10:30; Saturdays from 5 to 
11 p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
Kitayama, the first really serious Japanese restaurant in Orange County, is an 
exquisite addition to the local dining scene. You'll think you've wandered into 
a Buddhist temple -- until you taste the delicate, sophisticated cooking of 
Yoshio Shirai and his team of chefs. The sho-ka-do lunch is the most beautiful 
$14 meal anywhere, and the omakase kaiseki, a multicourse feast at $50 per 
person, is unforgettable. 
</P>
<P>
* Umi, 2075 Newport Blvd., Costa Mesa. (714) 631-2208. Open Tuesdays through 
Sundays from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. and from 5:30 to 10 p.m.; Fridays and 
Saturdays to 11 p.m. $$ 
</P>

Umi is a modern and imaginative but often unprofessional sushi bar with 
high-tech pretensions, and knowing what to order is important. You are safe if 
you stick with the sushi, which is fresh and crafted with an excellently 
prepared rice, but it is easy to run aground on the many hot dishes. Among the 
best are a wonderful scallop casserole, a toothsome Japanese steak, and 
yaki-onigiri (grilled triangles of sushi rice with various fillings). Service 
can be painfully slow.

Tuesdays through Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and from 5:30 to 11; Sundays 
from 5:30 to 10 p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
Hassan's Cafe specializes in the cuisine of Lebanon -- a hybrid of Turkish, 
French and local influences -- and the restaurant is relaxing and exotic. 
Mazza, one of the world's great noshes, is the absolute must here, a splendid 
array of Middle Eastern appetizers such as mutebel, a smoky eggplant dip, and 
warrab ennaq, vine leaves stuffed with aromatic rice. There are interesting 
main dishes such as kibbe nayya, raw ground lamb mixed with bulgur wheat, sort 
of an Arabic version of steak tartare. Kebabs are first-rate.

* Caliente, 1910 Main St., Irvine. (714) 975-1220. Open seven days, 11 a.m. to 
midnight. $$ 
</P>
<P>
Caliente is Spanish for hot, and that is exactly what this stylish new 
restaurant is. It's the latest jewel in the El Torito crown, and its modest 
adobe exterior conceals a stunning design -- a faint red '80s-chic motif 
complete with dramatic lighting, an open kitchen and a comal (a high-tech 
version of a stone tortilla cooker). The restaurant smokes its own meats, and 
you can wash them down with premium margaritas made from vintage tequila. 
Desserts, such as burnt cream and apple crisp, are wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
* Kachina, 222 Forest Ave., Laguna Beach. (714) 497-5546. Open nightly from 
5:30 to 10 p.m. $$$ 
</P>
<P>
Kachina is new, but it already may be the county's best restaurant. Named for 
Hopi Indian dolls that represent spirits, the restaurant serves food that is 
rare and exotic -- edible art. David Wilhelm, late of Pave and the El Torito 
Grill, has composed a menu featuring some of the most imaginative, intelligent 
cooking this side of the Twilight Zone, full of sumptuous tastes and 
color-splashed textures. Run, don't walk, to taste the green corn tamale, 
honey-glazed pork and celestial chocolate bread pudding. And go early.

Saturdays to 11 p.m. $$$ 
</P>
<P>
Order mesquite broiled fish from the restaurant's giant circular grill, or 
enjoy a brace of other dishes such as steamed Dungeness crab, smoked albacore 
tuna or simply flavored steamers, all of which go beautifully with the 
restaurant's standout sourdough bread. Desserts are all homemade. The best of 
them are a superior blackout cake and a soft, tart lemon mousse pie.

a.m. to 3 p.m.; nightly 5 to 10 p.m. $ 
</P>
<P>
Besides being one of the current nicknames for Thailand, "Land of Smiles" could 
also describe the type of service you can expect at the often exotic, 
occasionally bland Mongkut Thai restaurants. Here, smiles often substitute for 
intelligible English. Dishes get flowery names such as Glittering Coastal Onyx 
(sauced calamari) or Garnet Ocean Field (crab fried rice) on one of the most 
unusually written menus anywhere. And they can be blisteringly hot. The 
mussuman (beef) curry and the oily, flavorless chicken curry tend to 
disappoint, but most of the fare is exuberant and flavorful.

</P>
<P>
The food at 1520 AD may not be authentic Tudor, but who cares. When you eat 
with your fingers, everything tastes better. The opening course at this 
re-creation of a Merrie Olde England roadhouse is a hearty lentil barley soup, 
drunk from large draughts and eaten with hunks of brown bread. There is a 
choice of four entrees: slow-cooked chicken, lamb shank in a white sauce, steak 
kabob and a most modern filet of halibut with a heathen Spanish sauce on top. 
The abundant platters of rice and vegetables, the fine, lemony pound cake and 
the bottomless mugs of ice cold beer make for a dinner that King Henry himself 
would have enjoyed.

Sundays from 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. and from 5 to 10 p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
Places Afar is your basic Cuban-French-Vietnamese restaurant; the English is 
circumspect, the cooking is spectacular. Start with Cuban ham croquettes 
alongside greaseless plantain chips, or a bowlful of smoky black bean soup. 
Then try Imperial salad from Vietnam. Evenings, there are such French classics 
as couscous and choucroute. Calesa has a sign boasting "Round-the-World-Dining" 
-- it's a luxurious restaurant with Filipino, Asian and Continental 
specialties. There is a wide selection of main dishes from paella to sate, and 
cooking is often on the sweet side. Service is formal, and waiters in tuxedos 
flame desserts with enthusiasm that borders on lust.

<P>
POP MUSIC: CLINT BLACK FOLLOWS THE TRADITION OF THE GENRE'S GREATEST 
PERFORMERS, WRITING AND SINGING HIS OWN MATERIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A few years ago, G. A. Black of Houston, Tex. told his youngest son, Clint, 
that he ought to forget about writing country songs and just concentrate on 
singing other people's stuff. 
</P>
<P>
In a backhanded way, this fatherly advice helped spur Clint Black to become 
what he is today: by far the hottest rookie in country music, with 
platinum-selling stardom founded on an ability to leap over the Nashville 
version of the Berlin Wall, the one that segregates the singers from the 
songwriters. 
</P>
<P>
"I was 24 at the time," Black, now 28, recalled in a recent phone interview 
from a tour stop in Rochester, N.Y. (Black opens for Alabama in a sold-out 
concert tonight at the Greek Theatre and at Irvine Meadows on July 15). 
</P>
<P>
G. A. Black was a country music fanatic who figured that real songwriters need 
a substantial fund of life experience to draw upon. Serve prison time like 
Merle Haggard. Battle the bottle like George Jones. Walk that hard line, like 
Johnny Cash. Then you can tell the world about it in a song. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'You really haven't done enough living -- shooting pool, drinking 
beer and getting in fights,' " Black said, slipping into the tale in his 
easygoing, deep and mellow Texas twang. "That's what he believed, and he 
discouraged me. 'Go look for (other writers') songs, or go get drunk and get in 
fights.' " 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the younger Black got ornery. "I went home and in 20 minutes I wrote 
'Nothing's News' to show my dad that proverb was true -- you don't have to 
stick your hand in the fire to know how it feels." 
</P>
<P>
The song, about an ennui-stricken protagonist who pines for beer-drinking, 
barroom-brawling days gone by, eventually wound up on Black's 1989 debut album, 
"Killin' Time." Today, "Killin' Time" has sold more than a million copies, 
spent an aggregate of 20 weeks at the top of the Billboard country albums chart 
(where it remained last week), entered the Top 40 on the pop albums chart, and 
produced four No. 1 country singles. Now, in a bid for a fifth, "Nothing's 
News" has also been released as a single. 
</P>
<P>
Coupled with his sweep last April of four Academy of Country Music awards, 
Black's debut success establishes him as a peer of George Strait and Randy 
Travis in the running for most popular figure in country's young traditionalist 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
The big difference is that Strait and Travis don't write much of their 
material. Black does -- either by himself, or in collaboration with his band's 
guitar player, Hayden Nicholas. 
</P>
<P>
Black began playing the harmonica at 13. Then he moved on to playing the guitar 
and singing. By the time he was 16, he was running around his neighborhood, 
playing songs for anyone who would listen. 
</P>
<P>
Black's break came in May 1987, when a Houston record promoter who had taken an 
interest in him gave one of his tapes to Bill Ham, manager of the rock band ZZ 
Top. 
</P>
<P>
"Two days later I was sitting in (Ham's) office. I played him everything I'd 
written. He said, 'Well, I think you ought to take off in country music running 
as swiftly as you can go" -- with Ham paving the way as his manager. 
</P>
<P>
Ham's words about moving swiftly proved prophetic. But with instant success 
comes heightened pressure to sustain it. Black said he is 70% finished with his 
second album, which is scheduled for an October release. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as the songs can stand up and compare in quality in my mind -- I trust 
my judgment there," Black said. "If the popularity wanes a bit, I'll have to 
deal with it. The whole aim is just to try and settle in to where I can do this 
comfortably for the rest of my life."

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
She was a millionaire by birth, a horsewoman by choice, a gadfly by 
inclination. But what she was not, says Joan Irvine Smith, was a woman who was 
taken very seriously, not by the men who ran the Irvine Co., the vast barony 
her great-grandfather founded. 
</P>
<P>
"I had years and years of people saying, 'Now dear, don't worry about your 
assets, we'll take care of them for you. You just have a good time,' " she 
remembered. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years she married four times, gave birth to three sons, raised horses 
for fun and profit. And she battled the Irvine Co., at board meetings and 
public hearings. When it came to her family birthright, Smith wouldn't be 
brushed off, or married off, or bought off. 
</P>
<P>
Through the years her business opponents tried to match her up romantically, 
she said, figuring that would get this pesky woman out of their hair. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a joke," she said. "Every time you turn around, you find somebody running 
some man in on you. . . . They figure if you are a woman, they can get you 
sidetracked. It is the male ego. They think a woman can't possibly function 
except on an emotional basis and 'if we can find her the right man, we will 
just have her right where we want her.' " 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, they never did get her right where they wanted her. Last week 
a Michigan court referee decreed that the giant development company pay Smith 
and her mother, Athalie Clarke, $149 million for their share of the company 
they agreed to sell in 1983 to Donald L. Bren, the company chairman. 
</P>
<P>
The award ended a lengthy and complex lawsuit and left both sides claiming 
victory. The Irvine Co. reasoned that the amount was far less than the $330 
million Smith was asking; Smith noted that it was 31% more than the $114 
million Bren offered her in 1983. Once the court totes up the interest and 
decides who pays the lawyers, the award is expected to hit at least $250 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Within days of the award, a fit and relaxed Smith granted a rare interview at 
her oak tree-studded ranch to reminisce about the past and consider what her 
money might bring. 
</P>
<P>
One of her favorite stories has been how years ago she "embarrassed" the Irvine 
Co. into adopting a master plan for development of its extensive agricultural 
landholdings, which once spanned a fifth of Orange County, and donating the 
land for the campus that became UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with her millions, she offers: "There are a lot of things that can be done 
in medical research. . . . I am still very interested in doing something for 
the University of California, Irvine." 
</P>
<P>
For years she has pushed for an on-campus teaching hospital at UCI, despite the 
presence of such a hospital off campus now and despite the opposition of the 
local medical community. Will she push the project again? "We'll see," she 
laughed. 
</P>
<P>
Another project will be to expand her business of breeding, training, showing 
and selling top thoroughbred horses, not only at the 22-acre Orange County 
ranch but also at her spread in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, she wore pants and boots for a riding tour of her Orange County 
operation, the Oaks, after the interview. The stable's tack rooms and offices 
blaze with colorful prize ribbons, and the ranch landscape was bedecked with 
plants and flowers that she buys by the truckload. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 57, her hair now a mixture of gray and blond, is a woman of great energy 
who rises at 5 a.m., retires at midnight and talks with incessant urgency in 
her voice. 
</P>
<P>
Always a minority shareholder and the only female member on the company's board 
of directors, Smith has used whatever method was available -- including the 
courts, Congress and the press -- in a fight to protect her inheritance and 
make known her opinions. And she says she will not "let up one inch until I 
have my money in the bank." 
</P>
<P>
So she continues to attend meetings of city councils, county supervisors and 
water boards, and to bombard Irvine Co. executives and government officials 
with synopses of the meetings and cover letters that she types herself -- a 
regimen she has followed for 13 years, accompanied in recent months by Skippy, 
a small brown-spotted dog that she nursed back to health after it was hit by a 
van. 
</P>
<P>
Smith recalled that last January when she fell from an unruly horse and 
dislocated the knuckles of her left hand, she took care of the injury herself 
by using some veterinary painkillers and other remedies at her stable. "I 
wasn't going to go to the doctor and have him tell me I had to have it wrapped 
up," she said. "I had to keep typing with the damn thing." 
</P>
<P>
Smith traces her battles with the company that has been her nemesis for decades 
right back to the time she took a seat on the firm's board of directors. The 
year was 1957. She was 24. 
</P>
<P>
Her grandfather had died in 1947, and the foundation he set up to run the 
company after his death had a board with a few directors she believed were 
trying to use the company to enrich themselves. So she fought. In the 1960s, 
fed up with low dividends the Irvine Co. was paying on her stock, Smith lobbied 
Congress for seven years before winning passage of tax legislation in 1969 that 
forced the foundation to sell its controlling interest in the company. 
</P>
<P>
In 1975, she sued to block the foundation from selling the Irvine Co. to the 
Mobil Oil Corp. for $200 million. As it turned out, that suit was a 
scene-setter for a bidding war in 1977, which ended with Smith and others 
buying the company themselves for $337.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
The sale was hailed across the nation as a victory for Smith, proof her claims 
that the Mobil bid was far too low were correct. But there was a downside, too. 
Smith said the new owners forced her to reduce her ownership of the company 
from 21.1% to 11%, though she did receive $76 million for the stock she sold. 
</P>
<P>
This forced Smith to give up her dream of gaining control of the company by 
taking it public, while still being its single largest shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been the best thing that ever could have happened because if you 
could have given the people of Orange County an opportunity to invest in the 
Irvine Co., it could have made a lot of the development easier," she said. "But 
the foundation didn't want that." 
</P>
<P>
And after the 1977 sale, Smith had to contend with Bren, the powerful, debonair 
local builder who had his own plans for gaining control of the company. In 
1983, Bren bought out his other partners for $560 million, valuing the entire 
company at $1 billion. Smith's share came to $114 million. After failing in 
court to block Bren's bid for controlling ownership of the company, Smith 
decided to sell all her shares and get out. 
</P>
<P>
The only matter left to be settled was how much money she would get. She took 
Bren to court in Michigan, where the Irvine Co. is incorporated, when his 
original offer was, in her opinion, too low. 
</P>
<P>
The company argued that Smith had no basis for questioning the business 
judgment of the other shareholders, which included the likes of automobile 
baron Henry Ford II, shopping center magnate A. Alfred Taubman and Herbert 
Allen, a prominent New York investment banker. 
</P>
<P>
But Smith says the judge's decision proves that her challenge "was not a 
frivolous lawsuit." Because she is a woman, Smith said, she never has been 
taken seriously by her business associates. 
</P>
<P>
She lugged out a large scrapbook, plunked it on a patio table and opened it to 
reveal newspaper clippings that chronicled her battles with the Irvine Co. for 
more than three decades. The photographs accompanying many of the stories, some 
of which appeared in foreign publications, showed that it was Smith's 
glamour-girl looks and audacity, as much as what she had to say, that drew 
attention. "Dazzling Blonde to Sue for Million," said one headline. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Smith has sacrificed much of her personal life to do what she felt was 
necessary to protect her legacy. 
</P>
<P>
She said that her last marriage to Morton (Cappy) Smith, a horseman, ended 
because of the tremendous amount of time she spent away from their home in 
Middleburg, Va., to attend to her lawsuits against the company. 
</P>
<P>
"I did what I had to do," recalled Smith, who is still a business partner and 
close friend of her ex-husband, who operates her farm in Middleburg. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, Smith's self-appointed role as Irvine Co. watchdog has made her 
something of a prisoner, unable even to visit her horse farm in Virginia. It 
was her need to have some diversion from 12-to-18-hour workdays over the past 
13 years, Smith said, that led her to develop her South Orange County horse 
ranch, where she spends most of her spare time. 
</P>
<P>
But now Joan Irvine Smith is on the verge of finally breaking free and gaining 
personal control of her business affairs and her fortune. "You can't imagine 
how much I am looking forward to it," she said. "I want to be in control of my 
own destiny." 
</P>
<P>
Smith's feisty personality is often compared to that of her late grandfather, 
James Irvine Jr., known as J.I., who defended his ranch against trespassers and 
the railroad, at gunpoint if necessary. But she says she is certain her 
grandfather would approve of her decision to sever her ties with the land 
rather than remain a minority player. "My grandfather was in a control position 
with the company. He wasn't there in a minority position. He wouldn't have 
tolerated it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, at her ranch Smith is in command. She has hired two trainers and 
is striving to create a stable of champions, maybe even a future Olympics entry 
or two. She also is trying to give the sport of show jumping a higher profile 
on the West Coast. For five springs Smith and her mother have hosted the Oaks 
Classic, a jumping extravaganza and fancy bash that attracts top-notch 
thoroughbreds from around the country as well as the cream of Orange County 
society. 
</P>
<P>
Smith stables 40 of her horses at the ranch, about 14 of which she said she has 
added since last fall in anticipation of a resolution of her lawsuit. Also, she 
has plans to build a house on the ranch and to begin some much-delayed 
improvements on her farm in Virginia. When loose ends on the litigation are 
tied up, she will be freer to travel and to enter horses at shows on both 
coasts. She plans to ride some of them herself. 
</P>
<P>
Further down the trail, Smith intends to write a book about her life, which she 
expects to be highly controversial. "When I get around to it, it is going to be 
about the litigation and the intrigue and a lot of things that a lot of people 
aren't going to want to have exposed," she said. She also muses that "making a 
movie of it would be fun. But it would have to be toned down for prime-time 
showing." 
</P>
<P>
As to possible additional plans for the money, she is reticent, except to speak 
of the possibility of business opportunities with social import. She said she 
has gotten very interested in the field of toxic waste cleanup. But she doesn't 
want to say too much until she actually gets the cash. 
</P>
<P>
When the day comes, she said, she intends to ride to the bank with the check on 
a horse who has grown old and swaybacked waiting for the chance. The horse's 
name? "Last Laugh."

</P>
<P>
The award ended a lengthy and complex lawsuit and left both sides claiming 
victory. The Irvine Co. reasoned that the amount was far less than the $330 
million Smith was asking; Smith noted it was 31% more than the $114 million 
Bren offered her in 1983. Once the court totes up the interest and decides who 
pays the lawyers, the award is expected to hit at least $250 million. 
</P>
<P>
Within days of the award, a fit and relaxed Smith granted a rare interview at 
her oak tree-studded ranch to reminisce about the past and consider what her 
money might bring. 
</P>
<P>
One of her favorite stories has been how years ago she "embarrassed" the Irvine 
Co. into adopting a master plan for development of its extensive agricultural 
land holdings, which once spanned a fifth of Orange County, and donating the 
land for the campus that became UCI. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with her millions, she offers, "There are a lot of things that can be done 
in medical research. . . . I am still very interested in doing something for 
the University of California Irvine." 
</P>
<P>
For years she has pushed for an on-campus teaching hospital at UCI, despite the 
presence of such a hospital off campus now and despite the opposition of the 
local medical community. Will she push the project again? "We'll see," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Another project will be to expand her business of breeding, training, showing 
and selling top thoroughbred horses, not only at the 22-acre Orange County 
ranch but also at her spread in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, she wore pants and boots for a riding tour of her Orange County 
operation, The Oaks, after the interview. The stable's tack rooms and offices 
blaze with colorful prize ribbons and the ranch landscape was bedecked with 
plants and flowers that she buys by the truckload. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 57, her hair now a mixture of gray and blond, is a woman of great energy 
who rises at 5 a.m., retires at midnight and talks with incessant urgency in 
her voice. 
</P>
<P>
Always a minority shareholder and the only female member on the company's board 
of directors, Smith has used whatever method was available -- including the 
courts, Congress and the press -- in a fight to protect her inheritance and 
make known her opinions. And she says she will not "let up one inch until I 
have my money in the bank." 
</P>
<P>
So she continues to attend meetings of city councils, county supervisors, and 
water boards, and to bombard Irvine Co. executives and government officials 
with synopses of the meetings and cover letters that she types herself -- a 
regimen she has followed for 13 years, accompanied in recent months by Skippy, 
a small brown-spotted dog that she nursed back to health after it was hit by a 
van. 
</P>
<P>
Smith recalled that last January when she fell from an unruly horse and 
dislocated the knuckles of her left hand, she took care of it herself by using 
some veterinary pain killers and other remedies at her stable. "I wasn't going 
to go to the doctor and have him tell me I had to have it wrapped up," she 
said. "I had to keep typing with the damn thing." 
</P>
<P>
Smith traces her battles with the company that has been her nemesis for decades 
right back to the time she took a seat on the firm's board of directors. The 
year was 1957. She was 24. 
</P>
<P>
Her grandfather had died in 1947, and the foundation he set up to run the 
company after his death had a board with a few directors she believed were 
trying to use the company to enrich themselves. So she fought. In the 1960s, 
fed up with low dividends the Irvine Co. was paying on her stock, Smith lobbied 
Congress for seven years before winning passage of tax legislation in 1969 that 
forced the foundation to sell its controlling interest in the company. 
</P>
<P>
In 1975, she sued to block the foundation from selling the Irvine Co. to the 
Mobil Oil Corp. for $200 million. As it turned out, that suit was a 
scene-setter for a bidding war in 1977, which ended with Smith and others 
buying the company themselves for $337.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
The sale was hailed across the nation as a victory for Smith, proof that her 
claims that the Mobil bid was far too low were correct. But there was a down 
side, too. Smith said the new owners forced her to reduce her ownership of the 
company from 21.1% to 11%, though she did receive $76 million for the stock she 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
This forced Smith to give up her dream of gaining control of the company by 
taking it public, while still being its single largest shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been the best thing that ever could have happened, because if 
you could have given the people of Orange County an opportunity to invest in 
the Irvine Co., it could have made a lot of the development easier," she said. 
"But the foundation didn't want it." 
</P>
<P>
And after the 1977 sale, Smith had to contend with Bren, the powerful, debonair 
local builder who had his own plans for gaining control of the company. In 
1983, Bren bought out his other partners for $560 million, valuing the entire 
company at $1 billion. Smith's share came to $114 million. After failing in 
court to block Bren's bid for controlling ownership of the company, Smith 
decided to sell all her shares and get out. 
</P>
<P>
The only matter left to be settled was how much money she would get. She took 
Bren to court in Michigan, where the Irvine Co. is incorporated, when his 
original offer was, in her opinion, too low. 
</P>
<P>
The company argued that Smith had no basis for questioning the business 
judgment of the other shareholders, which included the likes of automobile 
baron Henry Ford II, shopping center magnate A. Alfred Taubman and Herbert 
Allen, a prominent New York investment banker. 
</P>
<P>
But Smith says the judge's decision proves that her challenge "was not a 
frivolous lawsuit." Because she is a woman, Smith said, she never has been 
taken seriously by her business associates. 
</P>
<P>
She lugged out a large scrapbook, plunked it on a patio table, and opened it to 
reveal newspaper clippings that chronicled her battles with the Irvine Co. for 
more than three decades. The photographs accompanying many of the stories, some 
of which appeared in foreign publications, showed that it was Smith's 
glamour-girl looks and audacity, as much as what she had to say, that drew 
attention. "Dazzling Blonde to Sue for Million," said one headline. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Smith has sacrificed much of her personal life to do what she felt was 
necessary to protect her legacy. 
</P>
<P>
But now Joan Irvine Smith is on the verge of finally breaking free and gaining 
personal control of her business affairs and her fortune. "You can't imagine 
how much I am looking forward to it," she said. "I want to be in control of my 
own destiny." 
</P>
<P>
Smith's feisty personality is often compared to that of her late grandfather, 
James Irvine Jr., known as J.I., who defended his ranch against trespassers and 
the railroad, at gunpoint if necessary. But she says she is certain her 
grandfather would approve of her decision to sever her ties with the land 
rather than remain a minority player. "My grandfather was in a control position 
with the company. He wasn't there in a minority position. He wouldn't have 
tolerated it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, at her ranch Smith is in command. She has hired two trainers and 
is striving to create a stable of champions, maybe even a future Olympics entry 
or two. She also is trying to give the sport of show jumping a higher profile 
on the West Coast. For five springs Smith and her mother have hosted The Oaks 
Classic, a jumping extravaganza and fancy bash that attracts top thoroughbreds 
from around the country as well as the cream of Orange County society. 
</P>
<P>
Smith stables 40 of her horses at the ranch, about 14 of which she said she has 
added since last fall in anticipation of a resolution of her lawsuit. Also, she 
has plans to build a house on the ranch and to begin some much-delayed 
improvements on her farm in Virginia. When loose ends on the litigation are 
tied up, she will be freer to travel and to enter horses at shows on both 
coasts. She plans to ride some of them herself. 
</P>
<P>
Further down the trail, Smith intends to write a book about her life, which she 
expects to be highly controversial. "When I get around to it, it is going to be 
about the litigation and the intrigue and a lot of things that a lot of people 
aren't going to want to have exposed," she said. She also muses that "making a 
movie of it would be fun. But it would have to be toned down for prime-time 
showing." 
</P>
<P>
As to possible additional plans for the money, she is reticent, except to speak 
of the possibility of business opportunities with social import. She said she 
has gotten very interested in the field of toxic waste cleanup. But she doesn't 
want to say too much until she actually gets the cash. 
</P>
<P>
When the day comes, she said, she intends to ride to the bank with the check on 
a horse that has grown old and sway-backed waiting for the chance. The horse's 
name? "Last Laugh."

KEMPER ALLAYS FEARS, SAYS HE IS AT GREAT AMERICAN HELM TO STAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Insisting that his plans are not merely to stay "a month or two" at his new job 
and then move on, Great American Bank's new chairman and chief executive Robert 
L. Kemper said that his goal is to "help (the S&amp;L) survive" and to "run the 
institution long enough to retire." 
</P>
<P>
Kemper's comments were made during a brief interview Tuesday, his second day on 
the job after replacing Gordon Luce at Great American's helm. Kemper's 
statements may have allayed fears of some observers who may have suspected that 
he was brought in to manage Great American at the invitation of the Office of 
Thrift Supervision as a prelude to shutting down the still solvent-but-ailing 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
Great American needs to raise $350 million in capital or drastically shrink 
itself in asset size by the end of this year or risk being seized by 
regulators, according to a capital plan submitted to the OTS in April. The OTS 
has taken a strong supervisory role at the S&amp;L in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
Kemper's background certainly could qualify him for a caretaker role. A 
61-year-old former vice chairman of Wells Fargo Bank who quit after losing the 
chairman's job to Carl Reichardt, Kemper has for the last two years worked for 
a San Francisco-based financial services consulting firm, Conover &amp; 
McNamar, that works closely with the OTS and which recently studied the 
possibility of organizing an investment group to acquire several failed 
thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
During two years as director of National Center on Financial Services at 
UC-Berkeley, Kemper led seminars and courses that focused strongly on 
regulatory issues and, in the process, became well known to regulatory staff 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Kemper said he is making a long-term commitment to make Great 
American a "viable institution." That's a daunting task, one that caused at 
least three other candidates for the Luce job to beg off after being approached 
by Great American's board of directors, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Kemper now lives in Santa Barbara but plans to move to San Diego soon, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kemper declined to discuss specific financial issues confronting Great 
American, a reticence that may be connected to Great American's efforts to sell 
all or most of its California branches, a move designed to raise the S&amp;L's 
deficient capital to levels acceptable to regulators. 
</P>
<P>
A deal to sell many of its branches could be imminent with Wells Fargo or Bank 
of America mentioned by sources as the most likely buyers. A joint venture of 
Security Pacific Bank and the Robert Bass Group made a bid for some Great 
American branches last month but was turned down, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of the branches could leave Great American considerably shrunken from 
its current $15.4-billion assets size, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Luce, whom Kemper replaced as chairman and chief executive, will remain 
as a member of Great American's board of directors. But the status of Roger 
Lindland, whom Kemper replaced as president, was less clear Tuesday. The 
S&amp;L said Lindland is no longer an employee but declined to say whether 
Lindland resigned or was fired. 
</P>
<P>
Great American also declined to say whether Lindland will collect a "golden 
parachute" severance payment from the the S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
Kemper also declined to discuss his compensation package at Great American and 
whether it includes Great American stock or options to buy shares. Such a 
compensation feature typically gives executives incentives to stay with a 
troubled company and would be proof of Kemper's long-term resolve. 
</P>
<P>
Great American also confirmed Tuesday that it has accelerated its payroll 
reduction program and that it eliminated 183 jobs -- a 6% reduction -- in April 
and May through a combination of layoffs, retirements and resignations, leaving 
Great American's employee count at 3,206 at the end of May.

THE OUTLANDISH BUT AMUSING PAULA POUNDSTONE

<P>
As one of the most in-demand comics around -- the American Comedy Awards dubbed 
her 1989's female club comedian of the year -- Paula Poundstone does her share 
of traveling. She pulls into Orange County next week for a series of shows at 
the Improv in Irvine -- a gig she'll have to interrupt about halfway through to 
fly to Cincinnati for a one-night stand. 
</P>
<P>
Poundstone has built a following with her knack for refreshingly direct 
self-observation that never wanders into self-deprecation, and a distinctive 
sense of whimsy that often takes her off on outlandish but amusing tangents. 
</P>
<P>
During her first HBO "One Night Stand" special, for instance, her attention 
repeatedly fell on a vent in the ceiling. Its purpose, she calmly informed the 
audience, was to drain the water in case the building turned over and flooded. 
Right. . . . 
</P>
<P>
And in that event, she added later, the audience would have to decide whether 
to "put their faith in God" and stay put, or follow Shelley Winters and swim 
through the vent in a desperate stab at escape a la "The Poseidon Adventure." 
</P>
<P>
Poundstone is putting the finishing touches on a new one-hour HBO special, 
taped June 15 at a San Francisco club called Bimbo's -- "which is not a female 
slur," she quickly assures. "It's a family name. It says Mr. Bimbo right there 
on the speed dialing." 
</P>
<P>
Who: Paula Poundstone, with Matt Weinhold and Mark Cortez. 
</P>
<P>
When: 8:30 p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday; 8:30 and 10:30 next Friday (July 13); 8 
and 10:30 next Saturday; 8:30 next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Where: Irvine Improv, 4255 Campus Drive, Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Whereabouts: In the Irvine Marketplace shopping center, across Campus Drive 
from UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Wherewithal: $8 Tuesday, Wednesday and Sunday; $10 Friday; $12 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Where to call: (714) 854-5455.
