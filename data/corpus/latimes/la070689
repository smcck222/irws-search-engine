NEWSMAKERS: INDEX ON WARHOL NAMES NAMES

Want to find out if your name was dropped in Andy Warhol's diaries but don't 
want to thumb through all 807 pages? Fame magazine announced it will publish 
the first complete index to the diaries in its September issues. In compiling 
the index, the magazine came up with some figures that should send shivers down 
the spines of the rich and famous. A whopping total of 2,338 names were dropped 
in the diaries, which chronicle the peripatetic artist's social encounters from 
1976 to 1987. And many of the names were dropped dozens of times, Fame found. 
Bianca Jagger received 84 mentions, the designer Halston 98, and artist 
Jean-Michel Basquiat topped that with 111. On the other end of the scale, Yogi 
Berra and Idi Amin rated one mention apiece.

 -- Albert Gore III, the 6-year-old son of one-time Democratic presidential 
hopeful Albert Gore Jr., was back in the hospital for three hours of surgery 
for nerve damage he suffered in an accident earlier this year. The boy was hit 
by a car April 3 in Baltimore outside the stadium where he and his father, a 
senator from Tennessee, had gone to a baseball game. David Kline of the 
Louisiana State University Medical Center performed the surgery at Ochsner 
Foundation Hospital in New Orleans. The operation was to repair what doctors 
called a stretch injury to a network of nerves in the child's shoulder, which 
had limited the boy's ability to move his right forearm.

 -- The Chicago neighborhood where he lived is now battered and bent, and 
Wrigley Field, once the haven of sunlit games, has artificial lights, but still 
Abe Stolar couldn't get over how beautiful everything looked. "I didn't expect 
anything . . . . Everything I get is a gift," said the 77-year-old Stolar, 
returning for the first time in 58 years to the country he left at age 19 for 
the Soviet Union. Accompanied by his Soviet-born wife, Gita Rozovskaya, and 
Democratic Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, who helped draw attention to the 
family's struggle to leave the Soviet Union, Stolar explored the once-familiar 
streets. Many of the buildings in his old West Side neighborhood are now 
covered with graffiti, the doors and windows barred. But to the man who used to 
lie awake nights homesick, it was like a rose garden. "I feel like a baby. It's 
like . . . seeing what the world is like for the first time," Stolar said. 
Stolar's Russian parents immigrated to America in 1910, but the family returned 
during the Depression, believing that the Bolshevik Revolution had created a 
workers' paradise. After a 14-year fight, Stolar and his wife were finally 
allowed to emigrate from the Soviet Union to Israel. ANN CONNORS

COUNTY ADDS SITE NEAR PALA TO CANDIDATES FOR LANDFILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite strong opposition from Fallbrook residents and supervisors' own doubts, 
the San Diego County Board of Supervisors on Wednesday agreed to add a 
1,600-acre site to the list of finalists under consideration as a North County 
landfill. 
</P>
<P>
By a unanimous vote, with Supervisor Susan Golding absent, the board decided to 
permit the site, situated west of Pala, to compete with three other parcels 
identified earlier as potential landfills to meet the county's expanding 
trash-disposal needs. 
</P>
<P>
However, although saying they see no harm in at least considering the site, 
owned by Fallbrook developer David Lowry, the supervisors also made it clear 
that they are skeptical of the property's feasibility as a dump site, primarily 
because of environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Lowry's property, 4 miles east of Interstate 15 and south of California 76, is 
in the San Luis Rey River Valley, where, opponents emphasized, contamination 
could pollute wells and water supplies downstream. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Finalists 
</P>
<P>
However, with Lowry having agreed to finance a required environmental impact 
report, the supervisors argued that it would be premature to eliminate Lowry's 
Couser Canyon site from consideration before that study and its subsequent 
side-by-side comparison with the three other contenders. The other finalists 
are Blue Canyon, situated northwest of Warner Springs; Trujillo Canyon, north 
of Pala, and a site on Aspen Road between Fallbrook and Rainbow. 
</P>
<P>
But the supervisors also couched Wednesday's decision with a cautionary note to 
Lowry. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess the message to Mr. Lowry is: Proceed at your own risk," Supervisor 
John MacDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors' action came after a county counsel's report concluded that 
Lowry, a former chairman of the Fallbrook Planning Group, had not -- as 
opponents alleged -- violated conflict-of-interest policies by voting against 
the proposed Aspen Road site while having an interest in a competing parcel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Conceived in Dishonesty' 
</P>
<P>
At an emotional board meeting two weeks ago, opponents charged that Lowry's 
proposal was, as one Fallbrook resident put it, "conceived in dishonesty and a 
betrayal of the public trust" because he had lobbied and voted against the 
Aspen Road site while accumulating the Couser Canyon property. That allegation 
prompted the board to delay its decision on whether to include Lowry's property 
in the landfill search, to give county officials time to examine the charges. 
</P>
<P>
However, Deputy County Counsel Arne Hansen said Wednesday that his 
investigation determined that Lowry had only "done some very preliminary work" 
on the Couser Canyon land at the time of the Fallbrook Planning Group's April, 
1988, recommendation that the other potential dump site be rejected. 
</P>
<P>
"He had acquired no property or begun the acquisition process, had not entered 
into the county selection process in any concrete way and had not . . . even 
hired a consultant," Hansen said. As a result, he said, it was "not reasonably 
foreseeable" that Lowry's vote against the Aspen Road site, which county 
officials decided to include in their review despite the Fallbrook board's 
recommendation to the contrary, could have a financial effect on the Couser 
Canyon property. 
</P>
<P>
After Wednesday's meeting, Lowry said he regards the county counsel's report 
and the supervisors' vote as a vindication of his actions. Although opponents 
continued to grumble about alleged improprieties, Lowry noted: "If they had any 
evidence, they'd have brought it out, wouldn't they?" 
</P>
<P>
Despite allowing Lowry's site to undergo intensive environmental review along 
with the three other parcels, the supervisors emphasized that they remain 
troubled by the environmental and other objections raised by opponents, which 
include Valley Center planners and members of Indian groups in the area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bilbray Skeptical 
</P>
<P>
"Any pollution of the river would make this site totally unacceptable to me," 
MacDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Brian Bilbray added: "My position on this site is, I want to look at 
it. But I'm very, very skeptical." 
</P>
<P>
But Supervisor Leon Williams pointed out, and his colleagues agreed, that 
Lowry's willingness to pay for the environmental review will increase the 
county's options at no expense to taxpayers.

AL MARTINEZ: WHEN THE RUNNING STOPPED

<TEXT>
<P>
One sees his face through hazy sunshine as the photograph is tilted to ease the 
glare. Troy Anthony Blocker. The face smiles back at the world with a sweetness 
that matches the serenity of a summer day. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a boy, one thinks, who will run through life with the speed of a 
gazelle, racing the wind across open fields and down winding pathways, a 
heartbeat ahead of his past, a half-step behind his future. 
</P>
<P>
And run he did, with an ebullience that only youth can evoke, for Troy was only 
7 and 7 was a dazzling place to be. 
</P>
<P>
Then one day the running stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone knew it would. Troy had AIDS. Eventually, all that energy, all that 
sweetness, all that perfect embodiment of life would fade. A rustle in the 
treetops, then silence. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's another picture," Diane Fink says. 
</P>
<P>
We are sitting at a table in Pan Pacific Park. A basketball is bounced nearby 
in a steady, drumming rhythm. The laughter of children floats past like petals 
in a breeze. 
</P>
<P>
"He's with his brother Aaron," she says, shading the picture with her hand. 
"Aaron was two years younger. When I'd go to their house Aaron would holler, 
'Here comes the white lady!' " 
</P>
<P>
Diane smiles. 
</P>
<P>
"They were more than brothers," she says. "They were friends." 
</P>
<P>
Troy Anthony Blocker. April 2, 1981 -- June 16, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
We meet him vicariously through Diane Fink, a tiny, red-haired woman in her 
50s. 
</P>
<P>
Divorced and living comfortably in Beverly Hills, Diane entered Troy's life 
through the Family Outreach unit of L.A. Youth Programs, an organization that 
serves children. 
</P>
<P>
Troy had been a premature baby and had contracted AIDS through a blood 
transfusion. Diane had survived a brain tumor and vowed she would celebrate 
that survival by helping others. 
</P>
<P>
Their paths crossed last October when Diane was assigned to assist Troy and his 
family. Soon, she and the brothers were a familiar trio at the Westside's Pan 
Pacific Park. 
</P>
<P>
"They loved this place," Diane says, looking around. "We came here every 
Saturday. Regulars would wonder about the white lady and two little black kids. 
One child came up to me one day and said, 'Do you live together?' " 
</P>
<P>
Troy and Aaron brought their scooters and rode them down the lawn-bordered 
pathways from an upper play yard to a lower picnic area. 
</P>
<P>
"They would banter back and forth all the way down," Diane says. "You could see 
the progress of the disease over the weeks. Aaron continued to bloom, but Troy 
was wilting. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
When he was old enough to understand, Troy was told he had AIDS and would die. 
He said simply, "Don't tell my friends." 
</P>
<P>
"He was such a bright child," Diane says. "He knew how the fear of the disease 
creates such a prejudice. Kids with AIDS don't have friends." 
</P>
<P>
She remembers the 5th birthday party of another boy with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"Children came to the party but their parents insisted on two cakes. They were 
afraid the disease would spread when the candles were blown out." 
</P>
<P>
She watches other children play for a moment, then says absently, "In the last 
weeks, Troy wouldn't look at kids his own age. He'd turn his back as though he 
couldn't bear to see healthy children. Aaron would ask, 'What's the matter?' 
but he wouldn't answer." 
</P>
<P>
One of Troy's last great pleasures was a bicycle. He rode it only a few times, 
until the relentless progress of dying sapped his strength, and he was forced 
to lean it against the foot of his bed for the last time. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard for him to ride it," Diane says, "but he kept trying. It was such 
a brief pleasure. But sometimes a moment's joy is all we get in life, isn't 
it?" 
</P>
<P>
I came to know Troy that sunny day in the park. 
</P>
<P>
He was everyone's little boy and his death leaves unanswered all the questions 
of his future, all the glory of his potential. And it also leaves unanswered 
the last question asked by his brother. 
</P>
<P>
On the morning Troy died, Aaron touched his face and in an anguish that claws 
at the heart said softly, "I thought we were going to grow up together." 
</P>
<P>
I returned to the park alone the next day and studied Troy's picture. A soft 
breeze caught it and tilted it toward the sun. His face vanished in the 
blinding glare.

SIX MEN ARRESTED IN FATAL STABBING IN BALBOA PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY MILLICAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police arrested six men Wednesday night in connection with the stabbing death 
of a man in Balboa Park earlier in the day, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Franklyn James Black, 34, no current address available, was found by a 
passer-by near Balboa Drive and Maple Street about 5 a.m., said police 
spokesman Bill Robinson. Black had been stabbed several times, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The passer-by notified police, who discovered signs of a struggle 60 to 70 
yards from where Black was found. 
</P>
<P>
He was wearing white athletic shoes and shorts, leading police to believe he 
had been walking or jogging, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
One park visitor told police that he had encountered a group of men on 
Wednesday who he believed were going to rob him, Robinson said. The man told 
police he picked up a stick and scared off the group. 
</P>
<P>
The stabbing death is believed to have occurred during a robbery, Robinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As police combed the canyons of Balboa Park for men matching the descriptions 
provided by witnesses, the body of another man was found by a police dog in the 
underbrush near 6th Avenue and Elm Street, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The death of that man is not believed to be related to the stabbing death, 
Robinson said. A preliminary investigation led police to believe the second 
man, unidentified, died of a drug overdose, said Sgt. Jerry Callaway. There 
were no signs of trauma on the man, Callaway said. 
</P>
<P>
Autopsies on both men are scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
The search prompted police to pick up two groups of people -- some of whom were 
reported to have blood on their clothes -- for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
A wallet belonging to Black was found near where some of the people were taken 
in, said Sgt. Frank Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested six men ranging in age from 18 to 20 years old, who identified 
themselves to police as Mexican nationals who had entered the country 
illegally. They were being booked and held in County Jail downtown on suspicion 
of homicide, Martinez said.

VISA APPROVED FOR SANDINISTA AIDE TO ATTEND UCSD DESPITE U.S. BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite a policy barring Nicaragua's ruling Sandinista Party officials from the 
United States, the State Department recently approved a visa for a Sandinista 
foreign-policy expert enrolled in a UCSD summer course. 
</P>
<P>
Ramon Meneses Martinez, director of the North American desk of the 
International Relations Directorate of the Sandinista National Liberation 
Front, arrived Sunday for a six-week seminar sponsored by the Center for 
U.S.-Mexican Studies at UC San Diego. The course is funded by a $575,000 grant 
from the Ford Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
25 From Latin America 
</P>
<P>
Meneses is among 25 scholars and professionals from throughout Latin America 
who are enrolled in the intensive course, which includes various U.S. topics, 
including the Constitution, Congress, the presidency, mass media and political 
parties. He missed the first week of the seminar while U.S. officials debated 
his visa request. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Adam Shub denied Wednesday that U.S. officials are 
softening their stance in a 9-month-old policy that bars most Cuban and 
Nicaraguan government officials -- including members of Managua's ruling 
Sandinista Party -- from this country. The ban has been in effect since 
then-President Reagan issued a proclamation in October to limit the number of 
Nicaraguan and Cuban officials allowed into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The secretary of state is permitted to review cases on an individual basis and 
allowed to grant waivers if he determines that granting a visa is in the best 
interest of the United States," Shub said. "Apparently, he felt that issuing a 
visa in this case was considered to be in the U.S. interest." 
</P>
<P>
He declined to comment further and refused to say whether Meneses was issued a 
visa in exchange for a similar visa for a U.S. official. 
</P>
<P>
The visa war between the United States and Nicaragua heated up in May after the 
expulsion of two diplomats from each country. Manuel Cordero, a Foreign 
Ministry official in Managua, said Meneses is the first Sandinista official 
allowed to travel to the United States since May. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Regular Contact With Embassy 
</P>
<P>
Meneses did not return messages left for him with center officials. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Embassy official in Managua said Meneses and Cordero are among the few 
Sandinista officials who speak regularly with the embassy. This may explain why 
the State Department relented and agreed to give Meneses a visa. 
</P>
<P>
"We still occasionally give visas," the official said. "They asked us, and they 
bugged us to let him have one, and we said OK. He's someone we talk to. We know 
him. There's no earth-shaking significance to this, but maybe it will help 
loosen things up a bit. Right now, their visa policy (toward the United States) 
is in the deep freeze." 
</P>
<P>
As a foreign-policy expert for the Sandinistas, Meneses has a voice in making 
foreign policy and exerts influence over the Foreign Ministry, which is 
officially responsible for formulating Nicaragua's foreign policy. His job also 
includes monitoring U.S. newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Educated in the States 
</P>
<P>
Meneses has a BA from Cornell University and did graduate work in Hispanic 
literature at Yale. 
</P>
<P>
According to a written statement issued by the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies, 
the seminar's objectives include the development of more Latin American 
scholars and professionals to become specialists on the United States. UCSD 
officials also hope that participants will return to their countries and help 
establish U.S. studies and international studies programs at Latin American 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
Center officials said 88 people from 12 countries applied for the course's 25 
positions.

BANK BAILOUTS

<TEXT>
<P>
All savings and loan bailout plans to date want to put the burden on the 
taxpayer. How about a users fee on all borrowers who take a tax deduction for 
interest payments on their federal tax return? 
</P>
<P>
This would include individuals and businesses. A 5% reduction in the amount of 
interest allowed as a tax deduction should provide ample funds to replenish 
both the FSLIC and the FDIC within a few years. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to being a ready source of funds, it would be easy to collect the 
money. The IRS would do it. All borrowers should pay into the funds because all 
borrowers benefit when the U.S. has a strong financial base. This might also 
help deter some borrowing which should help increase our rate of savings.

LIGHT TRUCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
America is being overrun by an army of nannies preaching safety, health, 
sobriety and fitness at any cost. Now Sens. Ernest Hollings and John Danforth, 
in "Light Trucks Ought to Be Made as Safe as They Are Popular" (Op-Ed Page, 
June 22), want to apply passenger car safety standards to light trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Many people buy those vehicles precisely because they don't have the reinforced 
bodies and protective devices that add hundreds of dollars to car prices. These 
standards will force a youngster saving for a new car to brave traffic with an 
old jalopy or a motorcycle for six more months. 
</P>
<P>
Hollings and Danforth want us to believe life's only purpose is to prolong 
itself. This sterile ethic has created an epidemic of stifled human spirits, 
destroying our people's creativity and productivity and leaving drugs as their 
last challenge. 
</P>
<P>
The dynamics of risk are essential to a satisfying life and a vibrant culture. 
</P>
<P>
Some people risk death in revolution to build their nation's future. Others 
risk death in light trucks to build their own future with a reliable, 
economical way to get to work. They must be left free to choose that risk.

'FAIR PLAY FOR OLDER WORKERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with interest your editorial "Fair Play for Older Workers" (June 25), 
dealing with the unfairness of the Social Security retirement earnings test. As 
I travel around the country as commissioner of Social Security, I am acutely 
aware of how strongly the public feels about the inequity of the earnings test 
provisions. 
</P>
<P>
And, I could not agree more. The earnings test is really a misnomer. It is not 
a test at all. Rather, it is a penalty -- a penalty that retirees pay for 
working. The only thing it really tests is the patience of those who must 
suffer its provisions. The reality of the earnings test is that it can result 
in a marginal tax rate that can reach as high as 100 percent for affected 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
It seems only fair that people should have the freedom and opportunity to work 
and earn as much as they choose without the worry of reduced Social Security. 
This is particularly true since there is no penalty for Social Security 
beneficiaries who receive large amounts of income from dividends and interest. 
</P>
<P>
It is time I believe to confront this issue squarely so that America can 
utilize a sizeable, talented work force that is ready, willing, and able to 
contribute to our national economy. 
</P>
<P>
I applaud you for raising this important issue for public debate.

<TEXT>
<P>
I appreciate Roberta Weintraub's statement that Los Angeles School District 
supports "fair share" funding for all school districts (letter, June 22). 
</P>
<P>
I have made many appeals to my colleagues on the boards of large urban 
districts to join in supporting the small districts' fight for equalization of 
funding. Officials of large districts seem to think that for small districts to 
win, large districts have to lose. That is simply not the case. Everyone will 
gain under the current proposal. 
</P>
<P>
According to the chart published by The Times, Los Angeles Unified is receiving 
$1,045 per pupil in additional funding known as categorical funding. By 
contrast San Marino is receiving $111 per pupil. Under the proposal, both 
districts would receive increases but the gap would begin to close. San Marino 
would be raised an additional $184, bringing it to about 26% of the proposed 
Los Angeles funding. That is certainly not equal and certainly not fair. 
</P>
<P>
The primary category which is unfairly disbursed is Urban Impact Aid. These 
funds are not earmarked for specificed needs. Suburban children also have great 
needs which are denied because they receive no aid to fix the problems best 
identified at the local level. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that San Marino has a 40% foreign-born student population, it 
has been able to maintain excellence. However, in order to stay afloat, the 
district has had to eliminate all librarians, elementary fine arts, field 
trips, much of the public support for athletics and the facilities are 
downright depressing. 
</P>
<P>
Suburban teachers are also victims of unequal funding. No legislation should 
ever be passed which sends unrestricted aid, potentially for salaries, to urban 
districts at the cost of further impoverishing the suburban teacher where the 
district does not have such discretionary funds. That is not equal, not fair 
and not moral.

IN CONCEDING ONE ELECTION, SALINAS TEMPTS FATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JORGE G. CASTANEDA, Jorge G. Castaneda is a professor of political science 
at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
MEXICO CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time in modern Mexican history, the Institutional Revolutionary 
Party (PRI) has conceded loss in a state governorship election. The new 
governor of Baja California is Ernesto Ruffo Appel of the PAN (National Action 
Party). 
</P>
<P>
The decision to accept the government party's defeat was President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari's. It was the right decision, and he deserves credit for it. 
But this historic change in Mexican politics -- the first truly important 
transformation wrought by the Salinas administration -- cannot mask the context 
in which it took place, the reasons that brought it about and the problems that 
are left pending. Each of these nuances is important; together, they raise 
serious questions about the situation in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, if the decision to recognize defeat was Salinas', the previous 
decision to try and win by hook or by crook also was his. 
</P>
<P>
The entire electoral process, right up to election night on Sunday, was marred 
by the traditional Mexican election vices. Massive funds were transferred from 
a government bank into the coffers of PRI candidate Margarita Ortega Villa; 
electoral rolls were padded to include thousands of ghost voters, while the 
names of thousands of PAN sympathizers were "shaved" from the rolls; ballot 
boxes were tampered with on election day. Salinas had committed himself 
personally to Ortega's campaign, appearing on nationwide television with her 
four days before the election. 
</P>
<P>
Polls published before the election showed either a dead heat or the PRI ahead 
by a small margin. The PRI, having tried to avoid defeat literally at any cost, 
was caught by surprise by the margin of Ruffo's victory -- 15% to 20% over 
Ortega -- and by the scope of his party's operations to defend its vote at 
every precinct. This does not not detract from the merit of Salinas' 
concession, but does qualify it. 
</P>
<P>
As of Wednesday, while the PRI had accepted defeat in the gubernatorial race, 
it was claiming victory for its candidates in Mexicali, Tijuana and Tecate, as 
well as in the state legislature. The PAN, charging that PRI was still trying 
to steal the election, claimed victory in the legislature as well as in 
Tijuana, Tecate and Ensenada, where Ruffo was mayor. 
</P>
<P>
In Michoacan, the PRI was still following its policy of trying to steal the 
state legislature election, where the opposition is the Cardenista, 
left-of-center Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). As in Baja California, 
the authorities had prepared for a narrow opposition victory, which they 
believed they could overturn by careful, relatively limited (10%-15%) "modern" 
tampering -- ghost voters, "shaving" the electoral rolls, etc. This system 
worked in Chihuahua, where a low voter turnout and a close race allowed the PRI 
to win virtually every municipality. But it proved insufficient in Michoacan; 
thus, "old-fashioned" tactics were resorted to: expulsion of opposition poll 
watchers, ballot-box stuffing, forgeries or "lost" tally sheets and so on. 
Again, the authorities were caught by surprise by the breadth of the opposition 
victory -- between 18% and 20%, according to PRD figures backed by official 
vote tally sheets. 
</P>
<P>
PRI national chairman Luis Donaldo Colosio, in the same speech in which he 
conceded Baja California, claimed 10 of 18 seats for the PRI in the Michoacan 
legislature, despite PRD figures showing it had won 15 of 18 seats, with more 
than 52% of the vote. The PRD leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas is not the only one in 
Mexico suspicious that the government will use the PAN's victory in the north 
to cover up fraud and an illegitimate PRI victory in the center of the country. 
</P>
<P>
It is important to note that beyond the spectacular nature of the PAN victory 
in Baja California, and the less important but not inconsequential triumph by 
the PRD in Michoacan, the election results tell a new story about public 
opinion nationwide: that where voters have a choice in contested elections, 
they are against the ruling party, in proportions similar to those of last 
year's presidential elections. In a modern, urban, literate, right-of-center, 
booming northern state, the PRI lost overwhelmingly; in a rural, backward 
central state plunged in economic crisis, it did so, too. 
</P>
<P>
While Salinas' personal popularity may continue to be enhanced by the changes 
he is bringing to Mexican politics, his party and his government continue to be 
trapped in the age-old dilemma: The PRI and the government can win a 
tampered-with election or lose a clean one; they cannot emerge victorious in a 
clean contest. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas has decided to try the second option -- losing -- in contrast to his 
predecessors who all followed the first road -- fraud. It is a better choice 
for Mexico, but if it is followed through to the end, it probably means that 
the PRI will lose nearly every election in sight. A sobering thought, in a 
moment of celebration for the country.

WOULD PUBLIC BE SERVED BY A PARDON FOR NORTH?; 
</P>
<P>
GOOD REASONS NEEDED; GRACE ALONE WON'T DO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DEAN MOORE, Kathleen Dean Moore, an assistant professor of 
philosophy at Oregon State University, is the author of Pardons: Justice, Mercy 
and the Public Interest (Oxford University Press, 1989. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As demonstrators outside the courtroom chanted "pardon North now," U.S. 
District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell announced the sentence of convicted 
Iran-Contra felon Oliver L. North. The former National Security Council 
assistant was ordered to pay a $150,000 fine, serve two years probation and 
perform 1,200 hours of community service. Now it is up to President Bush to 
decide if there is good reason to pardon him. 
</P>
<P>
In 17th and 18th Century Europe, monarchs did not worry about giving reasons. 
Answerable to no one but God, they granted pardons that -- like divine 
forgiveness -- were arbitrary, unearned gifts of grace, bestowed for any reason 
or for no reason at all. 
</P>
<P>
Most often, their reasons for pardoning were practical and personal. By giving 
away full pardons, they rewarded friends and undermined enemies. By granting 
conditional pardons, they populated their colonies and manned their navies. By 
selling pardons (for prices ranging from two shillings to 16,000 pounds 
sterling), they supported their mistresses and paid the court musicians. In 
those days, the very concept of pardon deflected criticism. Since a pardon was 
a personal act of mercy, not justice, no pardon could be criticized as unjust. 
</P>
<P>
The framers of our Constitution expected Presidents, unlike kings, to pardon 
with "scrupulousness and caution." Presidents could grant pardons, Alexander 
Hamilton wrote in The Federalist, to "restore the tranquility of the 
commonwealth" during "critical moments." Or the pardon power could be used to 
keep the law from being "too sanguinary and cruel" by making "exceptions in 
favor of unfortunate guilt." Impeachment is the remedy the framers provided to 
call to account a President who abused the pardoning power. 
</P>
<P>
Reaffirming this view, the Supreme Court sharply distinguished the presidential 
pardon from that of the European monarchs. "A pardon in our days is not an act 
of grace," wrote Oliver Wendell Holmes in Biddle vs. Perovich. Since a pardon 
is not an arbitrary exercise of absolute power, it should only be granted for 
good reason. A pardon is the President's judgment, Holmes continued, "that the 
public welfare will be better served by inflicting less than what the judgment 
fixed." 
</P>
<P>
The court thus provided a standard against which all presidential pardons can 
be measured: Is the public welfare better served by pardoning than by punishing 
this felon? 
</P>
<P>
By this standard, a pardon is not justified if it serves only the President's 
private interests or narrow partisan interests. The most blatant abuse in this 
category is, of course, selling pardons. Gov. James Ferguson of Texas was 
impeached after 1,774 pardons made him a rich man. 
</P>
<P>
But there are subtle examples as well. President Gerald Ford may have lost his 
campaign for the presidency because of widespread suspicion that he abused the 
pardoning power -- that he may have promised to pardon Richard M. Nixon in 
exchange for appointment as vice president. Ford was compelled to defend the 
pardon as being in the national interest. Echoing Hamilton, he argued that a 
pardon would preserve "the tranquility to which this nation has been restored." 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court standard also rules out the possibility that a pardon is 
justified if it serves the felon's interests. Merciful treatment of an offender 
who has suffered through an expensive and painful trial must be weighed against 
the effects of the kindness on the public welfare. After the Civil War, 
President Andrew Johnson worried about pardoning leaders of the Confederacy: 
"By a too extended, thoughtless, or unwise kindness the man may warm into life 
an adder . . . Offenders must be made to feel the extreme rigor of the law . . 
. to put the seal of infamy on their conduct." 
</P>
<P>
This leaves two other kinds of pardons that do serve the public welfare. 
</P>
<P>
Pardons used to carry out sound public policy are clearly justified. President 
Ronald Reagan, for example, properly granted pardons in order to facilitate a 
prisoner exchange with East Germany. President Jimmy Carter pardoned Vietnam 
War draft evaders who had come home under an amnesty proclaimed by Ford. 
</P>
<P>
But pardons best serve the public interest when they serve justice. The pardon 
was always intended primarily to be a last-ditch measure to prevent 
miscarriages of justice. For example, a pardon was the only way out of jail for 
Dr. Samuel ("My name is mud") Mudd, who was unfairly convicted as an accomplice 
in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. Today, the majority of 
pardons are granted to help correct a legal quirk that continues to deprive 
convicted felons of their civil rights, even after they have served their 
sentences and become model citizens. The very best reason to pardon is, 
finally, that a person does not deserve to be punished. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the noisy public clamor for a pardon for North, President Bush should 
listen for the muted voice of Alexander Hamilton, reminding him to be 
"scrupulous and cautious." He should remember that his pardoning power is that 
of a President, not a king, and that a pardon must serve the public welfare, 
not private or partisan ends.

WITH AN OPPOSITION VICTORY, MEXICO GOES MODERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WAYNE A. CORNELIUS, Wayne A. Cornelius is director of the Center for 
U.S.-Mexican Studies at UC San Diego. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
With his government's recognition of a decisive victory by the conservative 
National Action Party (PAN) in Sunday's gubernatorial election in Baja 
California, there is no longer any doubt about President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari's resolve to pursue the political modernization of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The historical and contemporary significance of this action can hardly be 
overstated. Surrendering presidential control of a state government shatters a 
60-year-old taboo. Acknowledging the loss of a politically sensitive, 
economically critical border state sends a powerful signal to every state and 
local leader of the Institutional Revolutionary Party: Your candidates will 
continue to have all of the formidable organizational and financial resources 
of the national PRI machine and the federal government, but if they fail to win 
clearly and cleanly, their "victories" will no longer be guaranteed by Mexico 
City. 
</P>
<P>
There is no question that the decision to cede power to the PAN in Baja 
California was made at the highest levels and in the face of strong resistance 
by state and local PRI leaders. Until the moment that their national chairman 
announced the party's defeat in Baja, the state's PRI leaders and their 
candidate for governor steadfastly claimed victory, and local newspapers were 
filled with paid advertisements placed by affiliated organizations affirming 
their party's triumph. 
</P>
<P>
The PRI candidate, Margarita Ortega Villa, is a new-generation politician with 
a reputation untainted by corruption, and she was an effective, high-energy 
campaigner. The national PRI and the federal government invested massively in 
her campaign. The fact that she was defeated in spite of all this testifies 
eloquently to the erosion of public confidence in the PRI and lends credence to 
Salinas' own 1988 admonition to party militants: "We have to change, or someone 
is going to change us." The poorly concealed efforts of some PRI operatives in 
Baja to pad registration rolls and manipulate the electoral process in other 
ways were counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
The achievement of the PAN, for 50 years Mexico's principal opposition party, 
should not be underestimated, either. It has succeeded in building a strong 
statewide organization in Baja California over the last three decades. Despite 
numerous electoral defeats, several of which were probably the result of PRI 
chicanery, the PAN maintained its credibility with voters as a worthy 
alternative to the government party. In addition to having a highly popular 
gubernatorial candidate -- the former mayor of Ensenada, Ernesto Ruffo Appel -- 
the PAN was smart enough this time to mute its criticism of the electoral 
irregularities and thus avoid giving the government a pretext for annulling the 
results. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican political system now moves into uncharted territory. For the first 
time, a PRI-dominated federal government will have to share power and resources 
at the state level with a government controlled by an opposition party. It will 
be another major test of Salinas' skill to fashion a constructive relationship 
with the PANista government in Baja while rebuilding support for the PRI in 
that state. The leftist PRD (Party of the Democratic Revolution) also made a 
strong showing Sunday in the legislative elections in the state of Michoacan. 
If those Cardenista victories are not recognized by the government, there will 
be cries that Salinas' commitment to political liberalization is highly 
selective. Indeed, it will be more politically disruptive for the government to 
concede defeat to the PRD, which is led by renegade former PRI chieftains, than 
to recognize the PAN's triumphs. 
</P>
<P>
To consolidate the gains accruing from his politically risky decision on Baja 
California, Salinas must now make rapid progress on the economic front. 
Otherwise, his political reformism will continue to be dismissed as a 
"let-them-eat-symbols" attempt to divert attention from his inability thus far 
to secure a major debt-relief deal and engineer a strong economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
The urgency of the debt problem has been greatly increased by this week's 
political developments. If the U.S. government is truly interested in 
strengthening Salinas' ability to manage the plethora of problems confronting 
Mexico, this is the time for strong leadership to break the current impasse 
between Mexico and its U.S. commercial bank creditors. 
</P>
<P>
With his recognition of a state-level opposition victory, Salinas has brought 
Mexico into a new era in politics. But to realize the exciting possibilities 
and opportunities inherent in this opening, Mexico must shake off its economic 
stagnation and start a new era of growth.

WEBSTER'S CHAOTIC AFTERMATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT POST, Robert Post is a professor of law at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As legal doctrine, the Supreme Court's blockbuster decision in Webster vs. 
Reproductive Health Services is a disappointment. It tells us little that we 
did not already know and provides only the dimmest guidance for future 
litigation. As abortion policy, the decision is a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of Webster, seven of the nine justices have taken unequivocal 
stands on Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 decision that first recognized the 
constitutional right to an abortion. Four (William J. Brennan Jr., Thurgood 
Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens) stand solidly behind Roe. 
Three (William H. Rehnquist, Byron R. White and Antonin Scalia) are explicitly 
prepared to overrule. 
</P>
<P>
The future therefore lies with Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Sandra Day 
O'Connor. In Webster, Kennedy joined with Rehnquist and White in an opinion 
that refused to decide whether Roe should be explicitly overruled, but whose 
hostility to any constitutionally protected right to an abortion was 
undisguised. It is not clear whether this means that Kennedy is unprepared to 
overrule Roe, or that he is only biding his time before showing his hand. The 
smart money is on the latter interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor is therefore once again uncomfortably at center stage. As in past 
decisions, she refused to say whether she regards Roe as sound precedent. She 
needn't decide that question, she said, because her previous position -- that 
regulation of "abortion is not unconstitutional unless it unduly burdens the 
right to seek an abortion" -- would permit the Missouri law at issue in Webster 
to stand. 
</P>
<P>
The court's refusal to reach the question of Roe's continued validity irritated 
Scalia. He charged that the "indecisive" decision "preserves a chaos that is 
evident to anyone who can read and count." Scalia is clearly right in this: The 
outcome in Webster is an open invitation to state and local governments to test 
the limits of the court's resolve. If O'Connor and Kennedy in fact believe that 
Roe should be overturned, there is little to justify the agonizing uncertainty, 
the untold hours of unnecessary effort and litigation, the mountains of wasted 
legal fees and judicial time that Webster is almost certain to produce. 
</P>
<P>
If O'Connor and Kennedy are postponing the destruction of Roe in the hope that 
the coup de grace will seem less political if sufficiently delayed, they are 
almost certainly incorrect. As frustration and anxiety grow, as legislative 
options for the regulation of abortion increase but remain trapped in the 
courts, the whole question will become more, rather than less, politicized. 
Whenever and however Roe is destroyed, the court will have hell to pay. 
</P>
<P>
If there are in fact five justices who believe that the whole question of 
abortion should be handed back to the states for legislative resolution, then 
it would be best for the court and the country to have done with it cleanly and 
decisively. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, however, the definitive vote in evaluating the 
constitutionality of abortion regulation is likely to be O'Connor's, which 
means that everything depends on which regulations she will find to be "unduly" 
burdensome. Unfortunately, her opinion casts little if any illumination on this 
question. 
</P>
<P>
There were two salient issues. The first concerned a Missouri statute banning 
the utilization of any public facility for abortions not necessary to save the 
life of the mother. Ten years ago the court ruled that state governments could 
withhold public support for abortions. The Missouri law was different because 
its broad definition of "public facility" suggested that the state was 
attempting to reach out and use public property as leverage to control private 
conduct. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, however, refused to decide the question of the reach of Missouri law, 
stating that the constitutionality of the application of the law to private 
hospitals leasing state-owned land "need not be decided here." 
</P>
<P>
She pursued a similar strategy of deflection with regard to the second major 
issue -- a poorly drafted Missouri statute that appeared to require that 
physicians conduct expensive and possibly dangerous tests whenever performing 
abortions at 20 weeks or later. O'Connor ducked the issue by reinterpreting the 
statute to require only safe and easily administered medical tests that "would 
only marginally, if at all, increase the cost of an abortion." 
</P>
<P>
At every level, then, Webster raises more questions than it answers. This 
result could be disabling for the pro-choice movement. In the past decade the 
movement has been lulled into political lethargy by the siren promise of 
judicial protection. Had the court swept Roe cleanly off the books, the 
movement might have been galvanized into action. But the legal ambiguities of 
Webster appear to offer yet another siren call, one the movement would be 
well-advised to ignore. In the future, the real game will be played in state 
legislatures, not federal courts. What remains to be seen is whether the 
pro-choice movement can effectively mobilize in the absence of a clear and 
decisively negative court ruling that would enable states seriously to 
constrict the access to abortion of middle-class women.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: DEL MAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mother of twins allegedly abused and abandoned by her boyfriend at a Del 
Mar hotel was sentenced Wednesday to a year in jail for child endangerment. 
</P>
<P>
As her parents looked on, Dorothy DeSimone, 25, of Oceanside, was taken into 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Municipal Judge John Thompson said he was rejecting the county 
Probation Department's recommendation that she be committed to state prison. 
</P>
<P>
Her boyfriend, Charles McCoy, 27, of Oceanside, is awaiting a preliminary 
hearing July 14 on multiple charges involving the battering of the twins, now 
3, at the Del Mar Inn on March 25. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson remarked that DeSimone knew or should have known the risk of allowing 
McCoy to have contact with the children. "She put these children at risk and 
knew (McCoy) had a propensity for violence," said the judge. 
</P>
<P>
Her attorney, Kirk Migdal, urged the judge to impose credit for the 87 days 
already spent in jail, and no further jail time, but that was denied. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson also placed DeSimone on five years' probation and ordered that she 
have no contact with the twins -- who are in a foster home -- without an order 
from him and Juvenile Court. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson also forbade DeSimone from contacting McCoy while on probation. 
</P>
<P>
DeSimone pleaded guilty to child endangerment, a felony, May 9. She could have 
received six years in prison and a $10,000 fine, but the prosecution did not 
ask for prison time. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Harry Elias said DeSimone had been warned about McCoy 
because one twin's leg was broken in January, 1988, and it was suspected that 
he caused the injury. Migdal said DeSimone was in love with McCoy at that time 
and did not suspect he would do such a thing.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: EL CAJON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
El Cajon jail inmates, in the holding area where a race riot took place 
Tuesday, were restricted to their cells in a "lock-down status" Wednesday 
night, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
About 90 inmates were being confined in module 7A Wednesday, which was designed 
for 24 inmates, said Sgt. Bob Ramirez. On Tuesday, the holding area housed 112 
prisoners when the fight broke out. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's detectives were still investigating the cause of the riot, though the 
fight apparently started when about 15 black inmates "went after" a group of 
Latino and white prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen prisoners suffered minor injuries, Ramirez said.

ATTENDANCE FIGURES LEAVE FAIR OFFICIALS FEELING LIKE A MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One day -- Sunday -- brought in 88,587 people, which is almost twice the 
capacity of San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. Del Mar Fair officials were 
marveling Wednesday over that record while celebrating what a spokeswoman 
called "the big one" -- record attendance of 1,076,982 for all 19 days. 
</P>
<P>
"We had 992,238 last year," said Shawn Riley, "and that's the most we'd had 
prior to that time. We're thrilled with the turnout -- now we can say we 
finally made it to the magic million." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weather, Growth Thanked 
</P>
<P>
Riley credited the million-plus to a combination of sublime weather and "the 
phenomenal growth of San Diego County." The magic million saw record numbers of 
people taking part in the fair's off-track betting and left local entrepreneurs 
thrilled with thousands of dollars in sales in everything from hot tubs to 
salt-water taffy. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics cast a wary eye at the magic million, however, saying it is reason 
for caution. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Karol Takeshta said 26 arrests were made during the 2 1/2 weeks, with 
several coming on the night of a performance by the rap group Stevie B. 
Takeshta said the fist fights after the show were "gang-related," but most 
arrests were for drinking by minors. 
</P>
<P>
"On the whole, I think it went pretty well," Takeshta said. "Considering the 
numbers, which astonished us, I'd say it went real well. No major injuries were 
reported, and the fair did a pretty good job to make sure that most of the 
entertainment was oriented to families. I hope it goes as well next year." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Clanton, a professor of sociology at San Diego State University and 
columnist for the Del Mar Blade-Citizen, has lived in the seaside town for 
years. He said many Del Mar residents continue to view the fair and "its 
expanding crush of visitors" warily. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm like a lot of people around here," Clanton said. "We don't come out a lot 
during the fair. A lot of people in Del Mar feel ambivalent about the numbers, 
the growth. . . . Del Mar gets a substantial amount of money from the fair, 
but, on the other hand, it costs Del Mar a lot, and, while it costs everyone 
something, it profits only a few. So it's really a mixed bag." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traffic Bottleneck 
</P>
<P>
Clanton said residents resent the noise and traffic on Interstate 5 near the 
Via de la Valle exit. He knows of one woman whose home is accessible only by 
Jimmy Durante Boulevard, the main road leading into the fairgrounds off Via de 
la Valle. 
</P>
<P>
"So you can imagine how she feels about it," he said. "It's quite something 
when you think of the equivalent of a sold-out stadium (Sunday's attendance of 
88,000-plus) having to enter and leave off of one freeway exit." 
</P>
<P>
Riley said fair officials considered the event that ended Tuesday "an 
overwhelming success, in every way" and cited high points, including concerts 
by Crystal Gayle, Sheena Easton and Hank Williams Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Riley said "a definite low point" was the incident after the Stevie B. concert. 
"But, unlike the Sheriff's Department, we don't necessarily see what happened 
as being gang-related. We just hope it doesn't happen again."

DODGERS FEEL THE PINCH IN 3-2 LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ST. LOUIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With any other team, in any other year, the move is easy. It raises no 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
It's the seventh inning, your team has just tied the game and placed the 
go-ahead run on first base with one out. Your starting pitcher is the batter. 
Your move is to replace him with a pinch-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Easy. 
</P>
<P>
That's what Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda did Wednesday night in a 2-2 tie with 
the St. Louis Cardinals. He took out Orel Hershiser and brought in a 
pinch-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
That's fine except this is the worst-hitting team in baseball. Hershiser seems 
as much an offensive threat as anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, on this occasion the Dodgers didn't get any more from a 
pinch-hitter. First, Lasorda called on left-handed Franklin Stubbs to bat for 
Hershiser. But when the Cardinals countered by bringing in left-handed relief 
pitcher Frank DiPino, Stubbs left without facing a pitch, in favor of 
right-handed Jeff Hamilton, who flied out to deep center field, and the rally 
died. 
</P>
<P>
In the bottom of the seventh, Dodger reliever John Wetteland gave up a triple 
to Jose Oquendo. Wetteland left in favor of Ricky Horton, who allowed a double 
to John Morris, and the Dodgers lost, 3-2, before 34,495 fans at Busch Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, last year's National League manager of the year was asked the 
question that reflects the Dodgers' season: Why bat for Hershiser? 
</P>
<P>
All Tom Lasorda could do was shake his head. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a hunch . . . I was just trying to get a run," he said. "How about 
if that ball goes out of the ballpark? I'm a genius, right? Because the guy 
doesn't do the job, it doesn't make it the wrong move." 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda stared at the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"This game, it will drive you crazy," he said. "It was the same story tonight 
as it is every night. It wasn't hitting for Hershiser. It was that to win the 
game, we can only give up one run. To win the game (Tuesday), we can't give up 
any runs. Everybody knows the reason for our troubles, everybody knows we 
aren't hitting. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, face it. If I leave Bulldog (Hershiser) in to pitch, it's still a 2-2 
tie. We could play forever." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers' third consecutive loss, and their fifth defeat in five tries in 
St. Louis this season, took about three hours, long enough for Los Angeles to 
drop 10 games behind the National League West-leading San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
As Lasorda said, it was the same story. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers fell behind in the third when the Cardinals scored in their typical 
fashion -- two runs on three singles, with a two-strike, two-out single to left 
field by Ozzie Smith scoring both runs. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers had only three hits against shaky Cardinal starter Scott Terry 
until the seventh but still managed to blow a couple of rallies, Eddie Murray 
helping to end both. In the fourth, he lined into a double play. In the sixth, 
he hit a two-out, check-swing tapper to third base to leave the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
In the seventh, Mike Marshall reached first base when Terry hit him in the side 
with a pitch. Mike Scioscia doubled to left field to score Marshall, and Mickey 
Hatcher's ground-out moved Scioscia to third. 
</P>
<P>
In came pinch-hitter Alfredo Griffin, who didn't start for a second consecutive 
day because of lower back pain. He batted for Dave Anderson and made Lasorda 
look like a genius this time by singling to right field to score Scioscia and 
tie the game. 
</P>
<P>
It was time for Hershiser, who was in the on-deck circle and ready. After all, 
one inning earlier, he had singled to improve his average to .205, which is 
within 30 points of the team average. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I want to bat in that situation, I'm a competitor, I always want a 
chance," Hershiser said. "But I turned my head to the dugout and saw him wave 
me back, and that was it. I thought I might bat if Alfredo drove in the run . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm not going to question my manager. Tommy is an emotional manager, he's 
an emotional man, and in his mind and a lot of minds, he made the right move. I 
mean, look at the story, it's the same story. No runs." 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton, the eventual pinch-hitter in Hershiser's spot, drove the ball to the 
fattest part of the park, but it was caught in left-center field by Milt 
Thompson. Then, with Jose Gonzalez batting, Griffin attempted to steal second, 
another measure of the team's desperation. He was easily thrown out to end the 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the reason for all this," Lasorda said. "I just need to find the 
cause." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Mike Davis was scheduled to return to Los Angeles, where his sore left knee 
will be examined today by Dr. Frank Jobe. The knee, which has been bothering 
him most of the season, was aggravated two weeks ago on a slide in Cincinnati 
and has not improved. As a pinch-hitter Wednesday, Davis struck out to end the 
game. He had earlier said that the knee would probably require some sort of 
arthroscopic surgery after the season. But it may require surgery immediately. 
If not, Davis will rejoin the team this weekend in Chicago. "I can swing the 
bat good, but after that, I'm a piece of junk," said Davis, hitting .250 with 
five homers and 18 RBIs in 157 at-bats.

ART BUCHWALD: THE NUTS AND BOLTS OF A DEFENSE ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Art Buchwald 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every evening there seems to be another story on the television about 
distinguished businessmen in white collars cheating the government out of 
millions of dollars. Just the other night I saw a piece where a spare parts 
manufacturer and his sons were indicted for supplying faulty parts, which could 
cause hundreds of planes and helicopters to crash. 
</P>
<P>
Archibald, who always thinks that big business is getting a bad rap, told me, 
"They didn't do it. No American would make spare parts and risk injuring our 
fighting men." 
</P>
<P>
"Even for money?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Suppose they did do it," he said. "I'm sure that their lawyers have a very 
reasonable explanation." 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't there enough money in defense contracts so that they don't have to 
cheat?" 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes there is and sometimes people like to make a little extra for a 
rainy day. I'd be amazed if the gentlemen in question would do something to 
damage their reputation with the Pentagon. I think that some wise-guy 
whistleblower went to the press with a cockamamie story that the company was 
using junk metal instead of the new stuff, and the reporter bought it. None of 
us can control what gets into the newspapers." 
</P>
<P>
"Fine and dandy -- but suppose the metal for the spare parts cracked and caused 
a helicopter to nose-dive into the ground?" 
</P>
<P>
"That's a hypothetical question. The company wouldn't sell spare parts like 
that because its officers don't want to go to jail." 
</P>
<P>
I said, "Nobody is going to go to jail and you know it. I'll bet the people in 
charge only get a $10,000 fine and 15 hours of community service." 
</P>
<P>
Archibald replied, "That's a stiff sentence for someone who only manufactured a 
few nuts and bolts that don't fit together. There is a prejudice against 
white-collar criminals in this country and it has to stop. These men overcame 
many obstacles before they reached the top, and it's wrong to take their gains 
away from them because they can't tell the difference between old metal and 
new." 
</P>
<P>
"Should the judge make them promise not to cheat on their spare parts again?" 
</P>
<P>
"That's a tough call. If I made spare parts I wouldn't want anyone telling me 
what to do. The Defense Department has many ways to ensure that it gets what it 
pays for." 
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't seem to be the case in this situation." 
</P>
<P>
Archibald said, "You're on their side." 
</P>
<P>
"Whose side?" 
</P>
<P>
"The prosecutors who are trying to send the guys with the white collars up the 
river." 
</P>
<P>
"If you want me to be honest with you, I wouldn't mind if they got 40 years." 
</P>
<P>
"For what?" 
</P>
<P>
"Just to teach them a lesson. I figure if they did 40 years they wouldn't cheat 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Archibald asked, "Have you ever heard the expression, 'Let the buyer beware'? 
Well, that's the way we should all feel about spare parts. If the people who 
fly the planes can't tell the good nuts from the bad ones, they ought to go 
into some other business. What makes our defense so appealing is that some of 
our finest weapons are as imperfect as we are."

CONSUMER VIEWS: WHILE PHONE RINGS, CHARGES MAY BEGIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON G. CAMPBELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: This is in reference to my MCI phone bill. I have noticed several 
calls for one minute. These were to residences with answering machines that 
answer on the fifth ring. I am always careful to hang up on the third or fourth 
ring. I have also often noticed that when calling and hanging up before the 
answering machine has answered -- and then calling back to verify the party 
won't answer -- that the phone is often busy, leading me to believe that the 
answering machine has indeed answered after I'd hung up. 
</P>
<P>
Upon calling MCI about this problem, I was first told that "obviously" I'm not 
hanging up before the machine answers or I wouldn't have been charged for the 
call. Upon request, I spoke to a manager, however, who told me that when I call 
a number with an answering machine -- no matter how soon I hang up -- I will be 
charged because the two machines have made a connection. 
</P>
<P>
She therefore refused to reimburse me for these calls and told me all 
long-distance companies have the same problem because of this "connection" over 
which they have no control. 
</P>
<P>
I called AT&amp;T and was told that they charge only when a person, or a 
machine, actually answered. But my mother has AT&amp;T and has the same problem 
I do. With so many answering machines these days, I feel ripped off being 
charged for calls that are not complete. What is really going on here? 
</P>
<P>
 -- J.T. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: We all tend to conduct our lives on the basis of old, time-honored 
belief: "Barking dogs never bite," or "every cloud has a silver lining." 
</P>
<P>
Or, in modern America: "If you hang up on a telephone answering machine before 
it connects, you're not charged for the call." 
</P>
<P>
The irony of this situation is that you got two apparently contradictory 
responses from the two biggies in the long-distance phone business. AT&amp;T 
told you that you're charged only "when a person or a machine actually 
answered," and MCI told you that you are charged when "the two machines make a 
connection." Would you believe that both answers are perfectly valid? 
(Although, admittedly, it's an oversimplification to suggest that you are going 
to be charged "no matter how soon" you hang up. If you are nimble enough, it 
can be done.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Odd Situation 
</P>
<P>
This is an odd situation in that the spokespersons for both communications 
companies were themselves not sure of how toll charges relate to answering 
machines until they had checked with their technical people. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how it works: You call a number serviced by an answering machine (and 
they can be set to respond on anywhere from the first ring to the fifth). About 
"2 to 3 seconds" before the ringing stops and the pause indicating that the 
machine is about to respond, there is a distinct click on the line. This is 
described by Victor Bhoot, a technical coordinator for Panasonic's technical 
training department, as "a plunger in the relay making contact with the 
cassette player." And this is when the telephone company's meter starts 
running. 
</P>
<P>
(In the interest of such lofty research, we armed our own answering machine -- 
which is set to answer on the third ring -- left the house and, equipped with a 
stopwatch, called our own number from a pay phone. The phone rang twice 
completely and then, 12 seconds after the first ring had begun, there was a 
very noticeable click which, frankly, I had never noticed before. About 2 more 
seconds elapsed -- while the phone was still ringing -- before the ringing 
stopped and a silence of about 2 more seconds indicated that the recording tape 
was running, but our message hadn't yet come through. I repeated the 
experiment, hanging up instantly when I heard the click -- my coin was not 
returned.) 
</P>
<P>
"I think that a lot of people have this misunderstanding," said Liz Morris, a 
public affairs spokesperson for AT&amp;T, "that if they hang up while the phone 
is still ringing, the call hasn't gone through. Actually, the recording machine 
has been triggered at the instant that click takes place, but in many cases the 
caller is in the process of hanging up and doesn't have the phone at his ear, 
and so he doesn't hear the click." 
</P>
<P>
And Fran Zone, the senior manager of public affairs for MCI in San Francisco, 
confirms that MCI operates the same way. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trouble at First 
</P>
<P>
"The technology that makes it possible has been in place for only a little more 
than a year. When MCI first got started, the technology was such that we had a 
lot of initial trouble with what we called 'ring-no-answer' -- where a phone 
would ring for a long time and we didn't have the technology to draw the 
distinction between ringing and talking. 
</P>
<P>
"And so we had customers being charged for long-distance calls when, in 
actuality, no one had ever answered. We got that straightened out, all right, 
in time. This is a more sophisticated approach to the same sort of situation." 
</P>
<P>
Just when the telephone answering machine kicks on isn't standardized (as far 
as anyone knows) among the manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
"With Panasonic," a major supplier of the machines, "it's about 2 to 3 
seconds," the company's Bhoot said, "and I would imagine it's about the same 
for Phone-Mate or Sanyo or AT&amp;T and the other makers. But it's simply not 
spelled out in any of our technical manuals." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously there are elements of Russian roulette in all of this business of 
trying to hang up before that tell-tale click happens. You have no way of 
knowing whether the machine is set to answer on the first, second, third, 
fourth or fifth ring. 
</P>
<P>
A consensus among those queried is that answering on the third ring is the most 
popular option. But there are plenty of variances. 
</P>
<P>
"I set mine to answer on the second ring," AT&amp;T's Morris adds, "because if 
I'm not at home, I think it's discourteous to make them sit there through five 
long rings before that becomes obvious." 
</P>
<P>
If you hang up too soon, you've nullified the point in calling. If you try to 
time it too exactly, then you run the risk of having the click take place while 
you're in the process of hanging up. 
</P>
<P>
There's one possible moral in all this: If your timing is off and you hear the 
click, you might just as well stay on the line long enough to announce 
yourself. 
</P>
<P>
Because you've paid for it anyway.

YOUR COINS: CLEANING OR POLISHING REDUCES VALUE 
</P>

Question: I have a $3 gold U.S. coin. I cannot detect any scratches or marks on 
either side. It has a bright, shiny finish. To me it looks like an MS-63 when 
compared with other coins I have looked at. I took it to a dealer and asked 
about grading and slabbing. He said it has been polished a bit and the grading 
service would not accept it. Could you tell me what amount would be deducted 
from the value if a coin has been lightly polished, and why a grading service 
would not accept it? -- W.D.L. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: You've raised many interesting points that are critical in today's coin 
market. But the old admonition against cleaning coins remains constant: Don't. 
</P>
<P>
You don't mention the date of your $3 gold piece. The $3 gold (known to 
collectors as the Princess) was issued from 1854 to 1889 but never achieved 
much public acceptance (something like the Anthony dollar). 
</P>
<P>
It's true that the major grading services will not grade a coin that has been 
recently cleaned. Some coins that were gently cleaned many years ago and have 
re-toned will be graded, but the cleaning will cause them to be downgraded. 
</P>
<P>
After coins have been graded by a service, they are sealed in air-proof, 
tamper-proof plastic containers called slabs. This helps preserve the integrity 
of the coin and the grade. The MS-63 is a relatively high grade on a Mint Scale 
of 1 to 70. 
</P>
<P>
Now, here's what cleaning can do to the value of a coin. If an MS-63 is worth 
about $7,250, that same coin, polished, is worth between $1,200 and $4,200, 
depending upon the degree of damage. And, like the grading services, there are 
many dealers who won't handle such coins, just as there are many collectors who 
don't want to own them. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I recently came across some coins and paper currency and would like to know 
their value: a 1922 Peace dollar, a 50 centavo from the Philippines dated 1944; 
a 1923 Italian 1 lire; a Series 1953 $2 bill and a Series 1957 $1 Silver 
Certificate. Also, I noticed that on the Peace dollar, the word Trust is 
misspelled. Is there any explanation for that? -- N.N. 
</P>
<P>
A: Your Peace dollar is worth about $10. The word Trust is not misspelled. The 
U looks like a V; just a stylized rendition. The Italian lire has no collector 
value; the 50 centavo is worth about $2, and your bills are worth face value. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I would appreciate your help on the value of my silver dollars that have 
been in my possession for more than 30 years. What are silver dollars worth on 
the market today? I have some dated from 1900 to 1976. I have V nickels from 
1900 to 1914. Is a 1915 quarter worth anything? -- J.E.M. 
</P>
<P>
A: Silver dollars issued from 1878 to 1935 are worth about $7 to $10 each in 
circulated condition, except for rare dates. The 1976 $1 is an Eisenhower and 
it is only worth face value. Your nickels are worth 10 cents to 20 cents each 
if circulated; and the 1915 quarter is $2 if circulated. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I read your column some months ago on the Quintuple Stella. Were any of 
these coins, which you state are five times heavier than a proposed $4 gold 
Stella, minted in later years? I have what I think is a coin dated 1882. The 
obverse has a Liberty head but no legend, just the 13 stars. The reverse has 
the heraldic eagle and the In God We Trust motto and an S mint mark. -- M.M. 
</P>
<P>
A: The Stella was minted only as a pattern coin in very limited quantity. Gold 
types were issued in 1879 and 1880. The Quintuple Stella discussed on Nov. 10 
is one of only four known and a special example. The 1882 coin you describe 
can't be evaluated without more information, such as the denomination and metal 
content. It might be best to take it to a dealer for identification. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Could you let me know how much a silver dollar dated 1888 is worth today? -- 
R.N. 
</P>
<P>
A: Your dollar is worth about $7 and up, depending upon condition. If your 1888 
$1 has an S mint mark (located on the reverse, below the wreath), it will be 
worth more. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have a misprinted $1 bill. There is a fold in the paper, leaving a blank 
space. Please advise if it is worth anything or should I just keep it? -- R.D. 
</P>
<P>
A: Your bill is an error, but not a major one. It's called a paper fold or 
crease. It may carry a slight premium. The trick will be finding a dealer or 
collector who's interested.

YOUR WHEELS: SEVERAL ROADS LEAD TO SAFE AUTO STORAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Question: We plan to leave for a vacation for several months and will leave our 
new Chrysler in the garage. What should we do to store the car properly? We 
have heard all kinds of conflicting advice on this. -- D.L.H. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The reason for the conflicting advice is that experts can't quite agree 
on how much preparation is necessary for storing a car. If you plan to leave 
the car for less than a month, you don't need to do very much, but after a 
month, the car may need some more elaborate protection. Few owners' manuals 
take up the subject, though it is certainly an important issue. 
</P>
<P>
The most critical problem that you face involves the gasoline, because after a 
certain point the gasoline will begin to form gum or varnish that will do 
serious damage to your fuel system. The gas tank, gas line and carburetor or 
fuel injection system can be plugged up by these gum or varnish deposits. 
</P>
<P>
Experts give widely different advice on how long one can safely keep the same 
gasoline in a tank while the car is in storage. It ranges from as little as two 
months to a full year. 
</P>
<P>
Most major brands of gasoline contain additives to help stabilize the fuel and 
prevent the formation of gum or varnish. But some of the cheaper gasolines on 
the market do not contain these additives and will go bad in as few as two 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers of the higher-quality gasolines that contain a good additive 
package make the claim that their fuels can be stored up to a year without 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
The varnish or gum forms through oxidation, in which the gasoline chemically 
reacts with oxygen. That is why it is important to keep your tank as full as 
possible if you are going to be storing the car with gasoline in it. 
</P>
<P>
The Auto Club of Southern California, however, advises motorists that if they 
plan to store a car for more than 30 days they should drain their fuel systems 
dry. The only safe and practical way to do that for an average motorist is to 
allow the car to run out of gas in the driveway. But be careful not to let it 
idle for too long, because that's not good for the engine either. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other advice provided by the club for storing a car for more than one 
month is to change the oil, wax the car, pour SAE 10W motor oil into the 
carburetor, drain the coolant, remove the battery, inflate the tires to maximum 
pressure, set the car on blocks and remove the windshield wipers. 
</P>
<P>
You'll need a vacation after all that. I would guess that involves about six to 
eight hours of work. And when you get back, you are supposed to change the oil 
again and refill the coolant. If you want some extra work, the club suggests 
you can remove the spark plugs and squirt oil into the cylinders before 
attempting to start the car.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO; 
</P>
<P>
MASTER GUITARIST TAL FARLOW IS STILL AT PEAK OF HIS FORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those who were aspiring guitarists in the '60s will remember those amazing 
catalogues for Gibson guitars. Printed on fine, heavy stock, with great color 
photos of the instruments, they were true Fantasyland for young pickers. 
</P>
<P>
Back then, one of the most expensive models was the "Tal Farlow," a big 
hollow-body electric designed strictly for jazz purists. But even with a guitar 
bearing his name, and as an unquestioned master of jazz guitar, Farlow never 
seemed to get the attention lavished on peers such as Barney Kessel, Herb Ellis 
and Joe Pass. 
</P>
<P>
More than 20 years later, Farlow, 68, is still at the peak of his form. He 
opened a two-week gig at Elario's on Wednesday, his first date in San Diego 
since he stopped here in the '50s with vibraphonist Red Norvo's trio. Farlow 
still plays the prototype for Gibson's "Tal Farlow." Not many jazz players get 
guitars named after them, but Farlow never let it go to his head. 
</P>
<P>
"They made these between 1962 and 1967," he said by phone from his home in Sea 
Bright, N.J. The humble guitarist's last album was "The Legendary Tal Farlow," 
a 1985 collection of wonderful jazz standards. The idea of a new recording just 
doesn't seem that important. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't have definite plans as to just when I'm going to record," 
Farlow said. "I just don't care for that kind of thing." He'd rather play live, 
which he does often, especially in New York City, an easy drive from his home. 
</P>
<P>
Farlow may not seem like a revolutionary, but he was in the early days of jazz. 
When electric guitars first became widely available in the '40s, their 
potential to be heard elevated them from background rhythm-keeping to a solo 
instrument that could swing side by side with a horn section. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking about Lester Young and Charlie Parker," Farlow remembers of his 
early days. "I'm pretty confident Charlie Christian was doing that too, 
thinking in terms of a horn, putting together single string solos, like a horn 
player. He and Lester Young were playing similar licks. When Charlie died, I 
started stealing licks from Lester, which were surprisingly at home on the 
guitar." 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, Farlow will be backed by Elario's house rhythm section of Bob 
Magnusson on bass and Jim Plank on drums. Without a piano, you can expect 
Farlow to function not only as the featured soloist, but as a chord-playing 
time keeper. This subtle mix, in Farlow's able hands, should produce some 
extremely bright musical moments. 
</P>
<P>
With the local club scene at an all-time low for jazz vocalists, San Diegans 
have to treasure their performances. 
</P>
<P>
Cath Eckert, one of the city's best jazz singers, plays one show only, this 
Sunday, July 9, 3 p.m., at Words &amp; Music Book Gallery in Hillcrest, in a 
duo with her husband, local jazz bassist Chris Conner. 
</P>
<P>
Most often, Eckert applies her smooth, throaty voice to standards, often drawn 
as much from popular music as from jazz. 
</P>
<P>
"One funny thing with my singing," Eckert said. "People always say I sound like 
the big-band singers, Anita O'Day, June Christie, but I never listened to them. 
I think maybe I sang with a big band in a past life. 
</P>
<P>
"Lyrics are important to me," she added. And she doesn't mind a little humor, 
like the songs of composer Dave Frishberg, once a member of the Baja Marimba 
Band. A sample: 
</P>
<P>
"You gripe and you groan/You grouse and you moan/You call Honolulu on my 
telephone." 
</P>
<P>
"If ever I'm in a new club," Eckert explained, "and the people are new to my 
music, I sing one of those and I have them right with me." 
</P>
<P>
With clubs booking so little vocal music, many of her performances are "casual" 
dates, like private parties and weddings. She supplements her jazz gigs by 
working weekends as a clown for hire for children's parties. 
</P>
<P>
She's performed with big names such as Freddie Hubbard and Joe Pass, and 
recently sang in a large Brazilian night club. 
</P>
<P>
"That sure was weird, a Canadian girl singing Brazilian tunes in Brazil. But 
they liked the way I sang." Eckert also plays Diego's Loft in Pacific Beach 
July 14 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
This is a week of activism for San Diego jazz musicians, who are putting their 
music behind their ideologies. Friday at 7:30 at the First Unitarian Church, 
4190 Front St., guitarist Peter Sprague plays a benefit for victims of the 
Alaskan oil spill. Saturday night at 8, same location, local pianist Randy 
Porter joins folk singer Peggy Watson and others at a benefit for the Central 
American Information Center, which wants to raise public consciousness about 
the violent war and destruction going on in El Salvador and other parts of 
Central America. The concert comes at the end of a 24-hour fast for peace in 
Central America. The organization hopes to raise $15,000 from sponsors of the 
fasters. 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: "Let's Get Lost," film maker Bruce Weber's powerful black-and-white 
documentary on trumpeter Chet Baker, continues through Saturday at the Ken 
Cinema. . . . The city of Carlsbad's summer jazz concert series continues 
Friday with Joy of Sax at 5:30 at Stagecoach Park off Mision Estancia, and July 
14 with flutist Holly Hofmann's quartet, same time, but at Magee Park on 
Carlsbad Boulevard, 3 blocks north of Elm. . . . A San Diego contingent 
including Mel Goot, Benny Holman, Ronnie Stewart, Oliver Luck and Ruby Bashore 
backed up blues greats King Solomon Burke and Sam Mayfield at the Monterey 
Blues Festival on June 24. San Diego trumpeter Ken Meredith is Burke's musical 
coordinator and plans to send the San Diegans to Europe with Burke later this 
summer. . . . On July 17 at 10 p.m. and July 21 at 11 p.m., KPBS-TV will air a 
program featuring a studio performance and interviews with five local jazz 
musicians who attended Crawford High School together in the '60s: Hollis 
Gentry, Carl Evans Jr., Nathan East, Marchelle Minafee and Doug Robinson.

Actor Woody Harrelson, who tends bar on the NBC series "Cheers," will be 
re-opening tonight in two one-act plays at the Court Theatre in Hollywood, 
where he also toiled last fall. One play is "2 on 2," which he also wrote, and 
the other is Edward Albee's "The Zoo Story." Others returning from the earlier 
production are Clint Allen, Brad Blaisdell, Rob Moran and director Larry 
Gilman. Even though he will be going back to work on "Cheers" early in August, 
Harrelson says he will complete the scheduled run of the one-acts through Aug. 
13, having successfully managed to do both last fall. "Doing 'Cheers' and the 
plays simultaneously is exhausting, but what it means for me is being able to 
hear people laugh day and night, and that is sweet, sweet music," says the 
actor. ALEENE MacMINN

"Twins" (No. 3) still hasn't knocked off "Coming to America" -- No. 1 on the 
Billboard rental chart -- but that's because the returns aren't yet in from the 
big holiday weekend. "Twins" could be No. 1 next time. "My Stepmother Is an 
Alien" is doing terrific rental business, partly because of the spillover 
effects of the stars' current smash movies -- Dan Akyroyd's "Ghostbusters II" 
and Kim Basinger's "Batman." "Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects" wasn't big 
box-office (just $2.9 million) but, with Charles Bronson playing a vice cop on 
the trail of a child-prostitution ring, it has huge appeal for the 
action/adventure faction of the rental market, quickly climbing to No. 19. 
"Alien Nation" jumped to No. 7 in its second week on the charts. 
</P>
<P>
* There was nothing rotten about "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels' " performance at the 
box office -- gross: $40.9 million. Featuring Steve Martin and Michael Caine as 
two con men working the French Rivera, it's the kind of hit comedy that does 
boffo biz in the summer rental market. It debuted at No. 8 and, if "Twins" 
weren't around, might have a good shot at unseating top-ranked "Coming to 
America."

College students and working women -- nearly 6 million of them -- who watch 
daytime programs on the three major networks are not showing up in the A.C. 
Nielsen ratings which only meaure in-home viewing, CBS reported Wednesday in 
releasing results of a new study. CBS and ABC commissioned research on 
out-of-home daytime program viewing, and CBS executive David Poltrack said the 
new data "confirms our belief that the current out-of-home television viewing 
audience is both substantial and growing." These unmeasured viewers, considered 
two of the most desirable demographic targets for advertisers, include 2.6 
million women watching at work and 3.1 million college students who watch on 
campus facilities or in temporary residences. Poltrack also noted that "working 
women, long believed to be excluded from the daytime network televison 
audience, are finding ways to fit daytime viewing into their work schedules." 
The impact of the unmeasured female working women and college students on the 
audience for an average minute of daytime network programs amounts to a 5% 
addition to the measured audience. The study, conducted the week of April 10 by 
Bruskin &amp; Associates, involved daily television interviews among 5,076 
adult working women and 2,216 personal interviews with students at 19 colleges 
nationwide. ALEENE MacMINN

The network news anchors are packing their bags for another trip overseas. CBS 
and NBC earlier announced that their main men, Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw, would 
be in Europe next week where there's lots taking place: President Bush's trip 
to Eastern Europe, the Paris economic summit and the French Revolution's 
bicentennial celebration. On Wednesday, ABC said Peter Jennings also will be 
reporting first-hand on President Bush's European visit.ALEENE MacMINN

Actor Griffin O'Neal and Rima Belinda Uranga became husband and wife in a Las 
Vegas wedding chapel ceremony before about 60 guests over the weekend. The 
bridegroom's father, Ryan O'Neal, was among those attending the Sunday night 
ceremony at the Candelight Wedding Chapel and later threw the newlywed couple a 
reception at the Dunes Hotel. O'Neal, 24, served a 15-day prison sentence 
earlier this year for violating terms of probation for his involvement in the 
1986 boating death of the son of director Francis Coppola.ALEENE MacMINN

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: MANY BENEFITS FROM EXERCISING WHILE ON A WEIGHT-LOSS 
PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Weight control depends on a basic equation: Create a caloric deficit between 
what you consume and what you expend and you will lose weight. Create a caloric 
overload by eating more calories than you burn and you will add weight. 
</P>
<P>
That simple fact holds true despite hundreds of articles promising weight loss 
without having to eat one bite less or walk one step more. Critics in the 
anti-exercise camp are fond of pointing out that for a 130-pound woman to burn 
off the calories in a slice of apple pie, she must bicycle for 68 minutes at 
nine miles an hour, swim the crawl 53 minutes or do 83 minutes of brisk 
walking, covering four miles an hour. Add a scoop of vanilla ice cream and it 
would take 113 minutes of cycling, 88 minutes of swimming and 131 minutes 
walking briskly. 
</P>
<P>
That, they argue, is an unreasonable amount of exertion for one modest dessert; 
and, by extension of faulty logic, exercise is of no help in weight control. We 
come down firmly on the other side in the debate. (People on weight-reducing 
diets -- or, for that matter, anyone concerned about cholesterol -- should not 
be eating pie a la mode in the first place, except on special occasions.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exercise Essential 
</P>
<P>
The heart of the matter is this: No weight-loss program should be without an 
exercise component. Exercise burns calories; and the more you do, the more 
calories you burn. Increased physical activity does not always require jumping 
onto a bike or wriggling into a swimsuit, although those are wonderful ways of 
using up calories and boosting cardiovascular fitness. It can take a much 
simpler form, such as using the stairs instead of the elevator at work or 
getting off the bus a stop farther from home and walking the rest of the way 
back. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the combination of activities, an increased daily output of 500 
calories will lead to the loss of a pound in about a week, without having to 
reduce caloric intake by a single bite. If 500 calories a day seems like too 
much, especially at the outset, be content with less -- keeping in mind that it 
will just take a little longer to reach your goal. 
</P>
<P>
If you're out of shape when you begin to exercise, you'll probably notice that 
the more you do the easier it gets. That's all to the good. Oxygen is required 
to burn off fat during exercise, and aerobic exercise enlarges the body's 
capacity to use oxygen. In practical terms, this allows you to move around at a 
higher intensity, thereby burning more calories than if you did the same 
activity slowly. You will also notice that you are able to go longer without 
tiring. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Energy Use at Rest 
</P>
<P>
Exercise fosters the creation of a caloric imbalance in other ways too. In 
recent years, much research has focused on the effects of exercise on "resting 
energy expenditure" -- the number of calories used in carrying out basic body 
functions. Lean body mass is more active metabolically than fat and therefore 
burns more calories. Dieting, especially when calories are severely restricted, 
results in the loss of both body fat and muscle. The loss of lean tissue, in 
turn, leads to a decline in resting energy expenditure; that's obviously 
counterproductive to efforts at weight loss. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, exercise that helps build muscle can be expected to prevent 
a decline, or even bring an increase, in resting energy expenditure. Beyond 
these benefits, exercise has also been found to decrease appetite and promote a 
psychological sense of well-being. 
</P>
<P>
Getting started on an exercise regimen is really a three-step process. It is a 
good idea to start with a medical evaluation, especially if you are over 40 and 
underexercised. Step two is to select activities appropriate to your fitness 
level and life style. Third, do an audit of your weekday and weekend routines, 
planning ahead for the type and amount of exercise you might find reasonable. 
As you proceed through the first week, keep a diary of what worked and what 
failed. That will help you to plan a more realistic program for the next week. 
Above all, stick with it. 
</P>
<P>
They say that nothing succeeds like success. One of the most effective morale 
boosters and dietary aids we know is the feeling you get from looking in the 
mirror and seeing an improved figure in the glass -- not only thinner but 
well-toned besides. 
</P>
<P>
While dieting can help you reach a weight goal, only springing into action can 
give you the look and feel of fitness that comes with having a well-exercised 
body. 
</P>
<P>

'Stress Formula Capsules' Provide Way to Sell Unnecessary Vitamins 
</P>
<P>
Question: I was browsing in a health-food store when a salesperson, noticing my 
briefcase, engaged in a conversation in which she assumed that I must have a 
"high-stress" job. Accordingly, she tried to sell me a stress-formula vitamin 
preparation. I resisted, but later found myself wondering whether stress 
increases nutrient requirements. Does it? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: No. The operative word here is not nutrition but marketing. 
Stress-formula vitamin capsules are just one more way of marketing large doses 
of vitamins, usually B vitamins and Vitamin C, that nobody needs. 
</P>
<P>
Often the promotions for these preparations suggest that smokers need more 
Vitamin C, or that oral contraceptives increase requirements for folacin and 
Vitamin B-6. While it may be that for these groups biochemical measurements for 
some nutrients may be lower than among the general population, levels are still 
well within normal range. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, there is no objective evidence to indicate that smoking, use of oral 
contraceptives or increased emotional stress raise the need for vitamins higher 
than the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs). 
</P>
<P>
These allowances are best met by a varied diet of fresh and lightly processed 
foods, accompanied, if you wish, by a single multivitamin pill containing no 
more than 100% of the RDAs for any nutrient. So, even if your briefcase does 
signal a position fraught with emotional stress, there is no reason to believe 
that your coping skills will be enhanced by taking a high-potency vitamin pill. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What is the nutritional value of a nectarine? 
</P>
<P>
A: A nectarine weighing five ounces provides about 65 calories. As for 
vitamins, its most notable contribution (if it is a deep-yellow nectarine) is 
Vitamin A, providing about 20% of the U.S. Recommended Daily Allowance. It also 
contains small amounts of B vitamins and some Vitamin C. And for those 
individuals who are taking antidiuretic medications, it provides generous 
amounts of potassium. 
</P>
<P>
While nectarines are commonly thought of as a relatively modern cross between a 
peach and a plum, their origins go back into the mists of history. The fruit is 
related to both the almond and the rose families and apparently was a delicacy 
in ancient China and the Near East more than 2,000 years ago. It's possible 
that nectarines may even predate the modern peach. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How prevalent is breast-feeding nowadays, and how common is the practice 
among working women? 
</P>
<P>
A: Since 1955, Ross Laboratories has used mail questionnaires to monitor breast 
feeding. Results of the 1987 survey, reported recently in Pediatrics, the 
Journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, indicate that approximately 55% 
of all women breast fed their infants while they were in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
But among some groups, rates were considerably different. For example, rates 
tended to be higher among women not employed outside the home, at least 30 
years old, in high family-income groups, college educated, white and living in 
the Rocky Mountain or Pacific regions. 
</P>
<P>
Comparison of breast-feeding rates in relation to work was limited to those who 
reported working full-time and those who said that they were not employed 
outside the home. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the infants were 6 months old, only 10% of the women who were 
working full-time were still breast-feeding, compared to 24.3% of those who 
were not working. (We reiterate that not working means not employed outside the 
home; we recognize that being a mother is a job unto itself.) 
</P>
<P>
But a comparison between working and nonworking women tells only part of the 
story. Among white, nonworking mothers in the Pacific region, for example, 
almost 80% were breast feeding in the hospital, and 38% of them were still 
doing so six months later. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the incidence of continued breast feeding among those who 
returned to full-time employment was higher among black women (especially those 
who were at least 25 years old) in higher-income groups who had college 
educations. 
</P>
<P>
The upshot is that while full-time employment does not deter women from breast 
feeding in the hospital, it seems to have a considerable impact on their 
continuing to do so. There are a number of reasons for this. For one thing, 
some women find nursing to be an extra burden in an already hectic existence. 
For another, day-care arrangements usually do not provide conditions favorable 
to breast feeding. 
</P>
<P>
Q: In a recent column about beef hormones, you alluded to problems with the 
federal inspection system. Can you tell me more? 
</P>
<P>
A: Both the Food and Drug Administration and the Food Safety Inspection 
Service, agencies charged with monitoring our food supply, are undermanned and 
overworked. The FSIS has been mandated by the law to focus its resources on 
problem areas and is cutting back on its work force -- down to 7,000 inspectors 
last year from about 10,000 in 1980. FDA has about 700 inspectors and 
scientists to deal with its many responsibilities, not just for foods but for 
drugs and cosmetics. 
</P>
<P>
During the recent furor over poisoned Chilean grapes, some inspectors had to be 
pulled from other tasks to check fruit from Chile. This left other foods 
unmonitored for that period. 
</P>
<P>
Our food supply remains the safest in the world, but we want to keep it that 
way. Ironically, at a time when consumers are more concerned than ever with 
health and safety issues surrounding food, we are chipping away at a line of 
defense by undermining the strength of the FDA and the FSIS.

THE KITCHEN CABINET: A TEMPEST IN TEAKETTLES: TREND IS TO FANCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Every time I go back to browse through a cookware shop, lo and behold, another 
brand-new teakettle has managed to squeeze itself into what appears to be a 
parade of mismatched pots. And if I'm lucky I may even get the wonderful 
opportunity to listen to the sounds of a whistling kettle, or enjoy a brief 
whiff of facial sauna from it as it happily boils away on a demo stove. 
</P>
<P>
On one visit, the leader of the band was a musical teakettle "singing" the 
entire tune of, would you believe, "Tea for Two" (Metrokane stainless 
teakettle: $130). The teakettle display is often a wildly eclectic collection, 
ranging in design from Old English to country to ultra-modern. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Teakettles 
</P>
<P>
There's probably a teakettle to suit every taste and personality. In fact, even 
when it sits on top of the stove, this hot item is a reflection of its owner. 
Not just from the chosen style but whether the kettle has been kept shiny and 
bright, or greasy and dull. So watch out, you may soon be judged according to 
your teakettle. 
</P>
<P>
Why are we suddenly being besieged by teakettles, or to be more exact, boiling 
water kettles? Noted L.A. designer Gary McNatton of Motto company explained, 
"Basically there were ugly teakettles, starting with the dull reds and 
avocados. . . . They did not justify the new kitchens that were being built or 
remodeled, not the thousands and thousands of dollars spent on these. Like 
cookware, teakettles have become a status symbol. Alessi must have started it 
all with its Michael Graves kettle, which I have and still like. The category 
became something the world jumped on." 
</P>
<P>
McNatton, who has a definite eye and likes to see things simplified and given 
classic longevity, was asked to put his creative efforts into a new teakettle 
for Calphalon. And so was born the Arrondi Teakettle ($110). The architectural 
influence and very defined profile of this charcoal gray kettle puts it in 
place with the sleek granite countertops and modern cooktops in sophisticated 
kitchens, McNatton said. 
</P>
<P>
Oval in shape and featuring a dramatic upward slant along with its 
heat-resistant handle, the two-quart Arrondi kettle is made of heavy-gauge hard 
anodized aluminum. "It's virtually impossible for a man to scrape off this 
treated aluminum," McNatton said after being asked about aluminum 
contamination, "but the big advantage is that it conducts heat evenly and water 
boils rapidly in it." 
</P>
<P>
One of the most important features in teakettles is cleanability, McNatton 
said. He designed the Arrondi with a wide lid and opening so that the hand can 
dig through the interior when cleaning. Another design factor is lid retention, 
that is, the lid should stay in place when pouring. The Calphalon cover stays 
in place at a pour angle of 180 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stainless Steel Kettles 
</P>
<P>
Next to glass, stainless steel is preferred by many for teakettles because it 
hardly absorbs any flavor, so long as it's kept clean, of course. One of the 
most difficult manufacturing processes involved is to give stainless steel a 
highly polished finish. In order to achieve this, Bodum, a Swiss-based company 
hand-makes its sparkling new Inox 18/10 stainless steel teakettle called Ottoni 
($150). Now going full steam ahead since its introduction, the handsomely 
designed, Italian-made 2-quart kettle is favored for its long-lasting and 
fast-heating copper bottom and its mahogany wood handle. The lid has a ball of 
crystalline blue acrylic sitting atop a pyramid handle that doesn't come off 
when pouring. 
</P>
<P>
The Ottoni was designed by Carsten Jorgensen of Bodum, who also designed the 
Bodum Teabowl Teapot ($150) in 1984. Chosen for the International Yearbook of 
1987/1988, the conversational stainless Teabowl pot is handmade near Milan. 
This pot has a spherical bowl and cone-shaped lid and accommodates a large tea 
strainer for whole leaf or whole bunch of tea leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Form following function is reflected in Rosti's Bubble Pot (from $45). Designed 
by the late Ben Seibel in Switzerland, the Bubble Pot has a spherical or 
"bubble" shape for maximum energy conservation on either gas or electric 
heating elements. The 2 1/2-quart Rosti vessel is available in mirror polished 
stainless steel ($50) and in colored finish of either enamel on steel or 
brushed stainless steel ($45). The colors are slate blue, red, white and black. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Black Phenolic Handle 
</P>
<P>
Conveniently lightweight, particularly for the elderly, the Bubble Pot features 
an easy-to-grasp black phenolic handle that assures balance and safety and 
stays cool to the touch. The lid attaches to the handle and can be easily held 
in place when pouring or pulled back when filling. Also, the opening is wide 
enough for cleaning accessibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon to join the teakettle parade is the half-size counterpart of traditional 
copper teakettles. Coppersource Halves Inc. is bringing out a trio of two-cup 
solid copper teakettle for individual servings ($40). Available in Austrian, 
Scandinavian and German styles, the charming teapots have stay-cool brass 
handles. What's unique about these products is that they double as potpourri 
kettles, each consisting of a solid copper warming stand with candle. Perfect 
for warming aromatics to get rid of unpleasant scents in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arrondi Kettle from Calphalon is available at Crown Hardware (Orange 
County), Bullock's and Montana Mercantile. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bodum Ottoni kettle is available at Crate and Barrel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rosti Bubble Pots are available at Robinson's and Bed, Bath and Beyond. 
The Coppersource Potpourri Kettles will be available in the coming months at 
Bullock's, Robinson's and Cookin Stuff (La Habra and Palos Verdes).

WINE NOTES: DIFFICULTY IN IDENTIFYING GRAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, Times Wine Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The controversy over what is a Zinfandel grape and what is not has become a 
side issue in the grape-switching cases filed by the state against a number of 
grape sellers. 
</P>
<P>
Should the buyer of grapes be able to identify the grape type by looking at 
them? State and federal government agencies are looking into the question of 
culpability by some wine makers who the agencies think should have known the 
difference. But it's not that easy to tell one variety from another, say the 
experts. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Steinhauer, viticulturist and vineyard manager for all of Beringer 
Vineyards' vast holdings around the state, says it's far easier to identify 
Zinfandel grapes while they are on the vine than after they have been harvested 
and sitting in a gondola. 
</P>
<P>
Steinhauer notes that once they are picked, the grapes no longer have their 
leaves, and it's from the configuration of the leaf that the buyer of the 
grapes should be able to identity the grape. 
</P>
<P>
"Zinfandel has a five-lobed leaf with tomentum (tiny, fuzzy hair) on the 
underside of the leaf," said Steinhauer. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you could be confused by a load of Petite Sirah, but on the vine, you 
can tell the Petite Sirah because it's glabrous (has no hair on the underside 
of the leaf)." 
</P>
<P>
There were more unanimous gold medal-winning wines -- 10 -- at this year's 
Orange County Fair Wine Competition than ever. 
</P>
<P>
The unanimous awards, called Four-Star Golds, went to the following wines: 1985 
Bargetto Komes Ranch Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon ($12), in the medium-priced 
category; 1986 Concannon Selected Vineyards California Chardonnay ($10.85), 
medium; 1987 J. Kerr Santa Barbara County Chardonnay ($16), high-priced; 1987 
Edna Valley Vineyard Estate Chardonnay ($15), high; 1987 Kistler Estate 
Chardonnay ($35), premium-priced; 1988 Windsor California Grenache Rose ($5), 
medium; 1987 Gary Farrell Howard Allen Vineyard Pinot Noir ($20), high; 1986 
Sanford Santa Barbara Pinot Noir ($14), high; 1987 Lytton Springs Zinfandel 
($12), high, and NV Cook's Imperial Blush sparkling wine ($3.99), low. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,500 wines were judged at this year's competition. 
</P>
<P>
St. Supery Vineyards and Winery, located between Rutherford and Oakville in the 
Napa Valley, will open its doors with tours on July 27. 
</P>
<P>
The winery project, estimated to cost in excess of $10 million, is owned by 
Robert Skalli and is a subsidiary of Skalli S.A. of France, a giant food 
company. 
</P>
<P>
An hourlong tour will include a glimpse of life in the 1880s, when the property 
was first farmed as a wine-making venture, and all wine tasting will be barrel 
samples from as-yet unreleased wine. 
</P>
<P>
I was impressed with two wines that recently won gold medals at the Alameda 
County Fair wine competition. Both are in short supply and may be hard to find, 
but the prices are so fair they are mentioned here. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1987 Retzlaff Livermore Grey Riesling ($5.95): Fresh and broad tasting, 
this attractively dry wine with a soft finish is a nice picnic wine. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1988 Chouinard Monterey County Gewurztraminer ($6.50): The spice character 
of this fine wine is akin to carnations and litchi nuts, and the rather 
full-bodied taste comes in part from 1.5% residual sugar masked by high 
acidity. Excellent with spicy foods. 
</P>
<P>
A third gold medal-winning wine at the competition, 1986 Concannon Sauvignon 
Blanc ($9.50) is a striking example of great wine making and perfect barrel and 
bottle aging. The crisp acidity and rich finish from its aging regimen make 
this a classic that reminds me of Graves in Bordeaux. 
</P>
<P>
One more gold medal wine from this event that impressed the judges was a 
nonvintage sparkling Malvasia Bianca, a very sweet and luscious dessert wine 
that, at $6, is a steal. Serve it with fruit salad and watch people ask for 
more. 
</P>
<P>
It has taken some time, but the first all-Freixenet Gloria Ferrer wine is on 
the market and it's an excellent example of why on-site control is better than 
remote control. 
</P>
<P>
More than three years ago, when the first sparkling wine of the Gloria Ferrer 
winery came on the market, it impressed a lot of people with its complex, 
French-like nature and the fact that it was so well conceived. 
</P>
<P>
The fact was that the first California wine from this Spanish-owned house was a 
joint project of then-wine maker Eileen Crane and Pete Downs, who was and 
remains wine maker for Chateau St. Jean's sparkling wine project at Graton. The 
reason for this was simple: at the time, there was no Gloria Ferrer winery. It 
had not yet been built. 
</P>
<P>
So in order to release a wine soon after the announcement of the project, 
Gloria Ferrer contracted with St. Jean to have it make the first Gloria Ferrer 
sparkling wine. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is, Downs has never received much public credit for the sparkling 
wines he has made for a number of producers who contracted with Chateau St. 
Jean to make their wines at Graton. (Among them were the wines of Shadow Creek, 
now a brand owned by Domaine Chandon.) And only savvy consumers knew that the 
first Gloria Ferrer wine was from Downs. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, many sparkling wines made by Downs carried small print on the bottle of 
the label that said the wine was produced and bottled at Graton. There is only 
one sparkling wine operation in Graton. It is St. Jean's. 
</P>
<P>
The second and third wines released by Gloria Ferrer had labels saying they 
were produced and bottled at Windsor. The only sparkling wine facility at 
Windsor is at Piper-Sonoma, where these wines were made under the eye of Chris 
Markell. 
</P>
<P>
As good as these wines all were, none is as good as the latest Gloria Ferrer 
wine, made completely in Gloria Ferrer's gorgeous, newly completed winery 
building. And even though it is a nonvintage wine, Gloria Ferrer Brut, you can 
still determine who made it. 
</P>
<P>
In the address line at the bottom of the label, it says this wine was produced 
and bottled in Sonoma. This is the first wine of now-wine maker Bob Iantosca. 
(Crane is now general manager for Domaine Carneros, the Taittinger project down 
the road from Gloria Ferrar that has yet to release a product.) 
</P>
<P>
Iantosca's first solo effort, and the first release with a "Sonoma" address, is 
a sprightly, delicate, finely made wine that has a crisp, slightly lime zest 
note in the taste. 
</P>
<P>
At $13, it's well-priced and proof that hands-on control leads to better wine.

LET'S EAT OUT: EMPRESS PAVILION: A NEW DIRECTION IN CHINATOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opening of the Empress Pavilion shows that big things are happening in 
Chinatown. And this restaurant is really big. It can seat 600 for dim sum, has 
14 kitchen chefs, two barbecue chefs and a dim sum crew of 15. 
</P>
<P>
Carts laden with tempting snacks roll through the huge room from 9 a.m. (8 a.m. 
on weekends) until mid-afternoon. Then it's time to prepare for dinner, which 
is no small project considering the 175-item menu. 
</P>
<P>
For years, a market called Yee Sing Chong and a parking lot occupied this site. 
They've been replaced by the bulky, brand new Bamboo Plaza, which includes a 
parking structure, a market that opened last week, spaces promised to several 
eating places and, on the second level, the Empress Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant departs from the old Chinatown tradition of ornate carvings, 
gilt dragons and red plush. It's a serene room with clean, simple lines, pale, 
pink-tinged walls, a burgundy print carpet and touches of aqua in the recessed 
ceiling and chairs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A New Direction 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen goes in new directions too. Witness such dim sum as shrimp mousse 
wrapped in fine strands of potato and then deep-fried so that it looks like a 
tiny curly porcupine. Or shrimp in a translucent wrapper with a thick band of 
mashed taro around its waist, like a life preserver. Or a morsel of beef 
wrapped in a thin sheet of pineapple. Or shrimp rolled in mango and accompanied 
by thick, sweet, yellow mayonnaise. 
</P>
<P>
Most of these ideas work well. But the chunk of beef in pineapple was too heavy 
for the delicate, salad-like presentation. And thin slices of veal wrapped 
around enoki mushrooms were dry and chewy rather than "tender," as the menu 
promised. The veal appears in a list of "gourmet selections" on the dinner 
menu. A companion dish, sauteed prawns with honey-glazed walnuts, succeeds or 
fails depending upon whether one likes the surprising sauce -- mayonnaise 
blended with Thousand Island dressing. 
</P>
<P>
An appetizer in a similar vein, served at the restaurant's grand opening party 
last week, featured mayonnaise-coated shrimp belted with a longan and impaled 
on a pick with a strawberry slice. This combination of meat and fruit is summer 
food. There will be sturdier fare in winter. 
</P>
<P>
The Empress Pavilion is a serious, Hong Kong-style restaurant, aiming at top 
level food and service. Executive chef Yiu Leung worked in Hong Kong for 20 
years. Manager Jimmy P. Y. Chiu was once assistant manager at the Jade Garden 
in Star House, Hong Kong, a restaurant that also yielded the chief prep chef, 
Wing Kai So. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rich-Tasting Catfish 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen can turn out superlative food. At dinner one night, we had a clay 
pot of rich-tasting catfish with toasty whole garlic cloves, stir-fried 
asparagus as perfect as it was simple, and wonderful braised E-Fu noodles that 
were embellished only with straw mushrooms and thin yellow Chinese chives. 
</P>
<P>
My Chinese companions liked the poached chicken with Chinese ham, although the 
meat was a bit sturdy, as one might expect from an American-bred bird. And the 
shark's fin soup with crab would have been excellent if the crab hadn't added 
an unwelcome strong flavor. We followed that with large scallops stuffed with 
shrimp mousse that were presented one to a customer. 
</P>
<P>
But my heart belongs to the dim sum. There are at least 60 varieties, and 
they're as good, sometimes better, than those in Hong Kong. Here, fried 
water-chestnut cakes are sweet and fresh. When I had them in Hong Kong 
recently, they tasted of everything else that had been cooked in the oil. 
</P>
<P>
The familiar barbecued pork buns, shrimp dumplings, beef balls and egg tarts 
are available. If you're willing to advance beyond these, try a thick rice 
noodle that is embedded with dried shrimp and green onions, fried until 
slightly crusty and topped with hoisin sauce and sesame seeds. Bird's nest 
dumplings come in a bowl of velvety broth. Chiu Chow-style fun gor, a steamed 
dumpling, contains preserved vegetable, meat and tiny shrimp. And stuffed 
squash is glorious when it is bright green mo gwa cut into circles, filled with 
shrimp, pork and mushrooms and topped with dried scallops, cilantro and a bit 
of salted egg yolk. 
</P>
<P>
The dim sum menu includes several rice and noodle dishes. The top-of-the-line 
Empress Pavilion pan-fried noodles are covered with shrimp, fish, squid and 
scallops, each beautifully succulent. The popular Singapore-style, 
curry-flavored, fried rice noodles become Fukien-style rice noodles when the 
curry powder is eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bowlful of Tofu 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the sweets, among them hot tapioca pudding flavored with 
coconut; cool, fruit-topped mango pudding; a steamed cake with glaringly yellow 
egg filling, and an absolutely marvelous bowlful of hot fresh tofu in brown 
sugar syrup. 
</P>
<P>
At night, double-boiled milk pudding turns into Chinese-style creme brulee, 
even though this airy concoction of egg whites, milk, syrup and ginger juice 
has no browned sugar crust. Perhaps the name change is aimed at customers new 
to Chinese food, who will also appreciate the two set dinners that end with 
fortune cookies and the explanation of moo shu pork as "burrito a la Chinois." 
</P>
<P>
Prices range from modest ($1.60, $2.20 and $3.00 per order of dim sum and $4.95 
for many of the noodle dishes at lunch) to expensive for luxury foods such as 
braised superior sharks fin ($40 a bowl). Other dinner prices are reasonable 
considering the upscale thrust of this restaurant. A number of seafood dishes, 
including deep-fried oysters, rock cod fillet with crab meat sauce and fried 
squid with garlic pepper, are $6.50 and sweet and sour pork is only $5.50. The 
set dinners, served for two or more, are $9.80 and $12.80 and include soup, 
appetizers, one entree per person, dessert, rice, the fortune cookies and tea. 
</P>

MICROWAVE . . .: FOR DRIED BEANS IN HALF THE TIME OF CONVENTIONAL COOKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN ANDERSON and ELAINE HANNA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although the microwave can't cook dried beans instantly, it does beat 
conventional cooking time by about 50%. It also reduces the risk of boil over 
and scorched pots and means a cool kitchen no matter how torrid the weather. 
For best results, follow these guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To avoid boil over, always use a casserole at least twice the volume of the 
ingredients put into it. Adding a tablespoon of drippings or margarine, a chunk 
of bacon or salt pork or a ham bone also helps keep beans from bubbling over. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Always cover beans with a tight lid to keep them from cooking dry -- not 
plastic food wrap, which will split during long cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Never salt beans until after they're cooked; it can toughen them. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Never try to hurry the beans along by keeping the power on HIGH (100%); 
you'll merely toughen and dry them. Once the bean liquid has come to a boil, 
reduce the power to MEDIUM (50%) for the duration of cooking so the beans will 
absorb the liquid slowly and soften. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Make sure the beans are tender before you take them from the microwave. 
Although they'll continue to absorb liquid as they stand, they won't become any 
more tender. If beans aren't tender at the end of the recommended microwaving 
time (old, super-hydrated beans often take longer to cook), continue to 
microwave in 5-minute increments, stirring after each. 
</P>
<P>
The following recipe works equally well for the whole family of dried beans 
with the exception of chick peas, which are too hard to microwave well, and 
dried whole peas, which tend to burst. 
</P>
<P>
BASIC BOILED DRIED BEANS 
</P>
<P>
1 pound dried beans, sorted 
</P>
<P>
Soaking water plus enough hot water to total 3 cups 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon bacon drippings, margarine or oil 
</P>
<P>
Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
Rinse beans. Soak overnight in 1 quart cold water. 
</P>
<P>
Combine beans, soaking water and drippings in 4- to 5-quart casserole. Cover 
with tight-fitting lid and microwave on HIGH (100% power) 7 to 10 minutes until 
boiling. 
</P>
<P>
Stir, cover and microwave on MEDIUM (50% power) 35 to 55 minutes, stirring 
gently every 15 minutes, until beans are tender. (Cannellini and kidney beans 
cook fastest. Navy, pea, Great Northern, marrowfat, pinto and black beans, 
slowest.) Let stand, covered, 5 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Drain, reserving liquid for soup or stew. Season beans to taste with salt and 
pepper and use in any recipe calling for cooked beans. Makes 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Black beans may simply be topped with sour cream, chopped red or yellow 
onion and minced cilantro. 
</P>
<P>
Variation: For Savory Dried Beans, add small ham, roast beef or lamb bone (or 
1/4 pound diced bacon or salt pork) to beans along with 1/2 cup minced yellow 
onion and 1 minced clove garlic. Microwave as directed, allowing additional 5 
minutes on MEDIUM. 
</P>
<P>
OLD-TIME BAKED BEANS 
</P>
<P>
1 medium yellow onion, minced 
</P>
<P>
1/4 pound lean salt pork, cut in 1/4-inch dice 
</P>
<P>
5 to 5 1/2 cups cooked navy or pea beans, drained (reserve liquid) 
</P>
<P>
Bean liquid plus enough water to total 3/4 to 1 cup 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup dark brown sugar, packed 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup dark molasses 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon dry mustard 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon black pepper 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
Combine onion and salt pork in 4- to 5-quart casserole. Cover with paper towels 
and microwave on HIGH (100% power) 4 minutes, stirring at half time. 
</P>
<P>
Stir in beans, 3/4 cup bean liquid, brown sugar, molasses, Worcestershire, 
mustard and pepper. Cover with wax paper and microwave on HIGH 9 to 10 minutes, 
stirring at half time, until gently bubbling. 
</P>
<P>
Reduce power level to MEDIUM (50% power) and microwave, covered, 30 to 35 
minutes, stirring carefully at half time, until flavors mellow. Check liquid at 
half time and add 1/4 cup more if beans seem dry. Stir again, then let stand, 
covered, 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt. Makes 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: In ovens of less than 600 watts, increase cooking times about 15%.

CULINARY SOS: SPICY GUMBO OF CAFE MAMBO IS FIT FOR SUMMER FIESTA 
</P>

<P>
DEAR SOS: Recently a group of friends and I had lunch at Cafe Mambo in Los 
Angeles. I have never been a gumbo lover, but their Mambo Gumbo was fabulous. 
We all agreed it was the best we'd ever tasted. Can you come to my rescue with 
a recipe? 
</P>
<P>
 -- KAREN 
</P>
<P>
DEAR KAREN: Mambo Gumbo hit the spot among the tasters in The Times' Test 
Kitchen too. 
</P>
<P>
The gumbo is a thick stew full of extraordinary flavor from chicken that is 
marinated in Caribbean spices. Incidentally, it's a great stew to serve a party 
crowd on a summer's night. 
</P>
<P>
MAMBO GUMBO 
</P>
<P>
4 chicken breast halves 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
6 stalks celery, chopped 
</P>
<P>
3 Serrano chiles, chopped 
</P>
<P>
Hot cooked rice 
</P>
<P>
Place chicken breasts in baking dish. Mix together melted butter, 1/2 cup olive 
oil, chile de arbol, cumin, salt, garlic, pepper, chile pasilla and paprika and 
pour over chicken breasts. 
</P>
<P>

debone. Dice meat and mix with remaining juices left in pan. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Heat 1/2 cup olive oil in large saucepan and stir in flour until roux is 
coffee-colored. Gradually add chicken stock, stirring constantly. 
</P>
<P>
Heat remaining 1/2 cup olive oil in another skillet. Add onions, peppers, 
celery and Serrano chiles and saute until onions are tender. Mix in chicken and 
broth mixtures. Bring to boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer 2 1/2 to 3 hours. 
Cool, then refrigerate 8 hours. 
</P>
<P>
When ready to serve, remove fat from surface and discard. Heat gumbo over 
medium heat, stirring occasionally. Serve over hot cooked rice. Makes 8 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR SOS: I am inundated with a bumper crop of peaches and wonder if you have 
an easy recipe for making jam without sugar? 
</P>
<P>
 -- BARBARA 
</P>
<P>
DEAR BARBARA: Here's one using gelatin to thicken the jam. You may sweeten the 
jam as necessary when eaten. Or add less sweetener than you think you will need 
to the water in which the fruit is to be processed. More can be added later. 
</P>
<P>
SUGAR-FREE PEACH JAM 
</P>
<P>
1 envelope unflavored gelatin 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup cold water 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups peeled, sliced peaches 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon granulated or few drops liquid non-caloric sweetener 
</P>
<P>
Soften gelatin in cold water. Place peaches in saucepan, sprinkle with lemon 
juice and bring to boil. Add softened gelatin and blend well. Add sweetener to 
taste and remove from heat. 
</P>
<P>
Pour into 2 sterilized half-pint jars and seal immediately. Do not use 
paraffin. Let cool. Store in refrigerator until used. Makes about 1 1/2 cups. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR SOS: My children and I would be very grateful if you could provide a 
recipe for those delicious, but very expensive, frozen fruit bars, especially 
the pineapple ones, on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MRS. E.M.S. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MRS. E.M.S.: You can use most any fruit in these frozen fruit bars. 
</P>
<P>

THE BUTCHER: A NEW GENERATION OF BEEF CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MERLE ELLIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty or thirty years ago, 85% or 90% of the cattle that came to market came 
in carcass form. When a butcher ordered beef, he ordered quarters, two fore 
quarters and two hind quarters per carcass. All of the further processing of 
the carcass was done in the cutting room of the retail market. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, you seldom saw skirt steaks or flank steaks in the meat case of 
any but the largest supermarket. There is only one skirt on every fore quarter 
and one flank on every hind, hardly enough to make a display in the meat case. 
</P>
<P>
Cuts that are today called tri-tips, ball tips and flaps also weren't seen in 
the meat cases of a generation ago. They are individual boneless muscles of the 
sirloin section of the carcass, and back then the muscles of the sirloin were 
not sold separately but rather all together in one huge slab of sirloin steak. 
Each steak contained a bit of tri-tip, a bit of ball tip and a bit of flap in 
addition to larger sections of the top loin and tenderloin muscles. 
</P>
<P>
Today, most beef is sold boneless, each carcass divided into its individual 
component parts at the packing plant and shipped to the market in boxes, each 
box containing so many vacuum-sealed plastic bags of like parts. Most of these 
subprimal cuts (as they are called) require some further cutting at the market 
to turn them into the retail steaks, stew, stir-fry and stuff that you find in 
the meat case. Some cuts, however, are small enough to be tossed on the grill 
just as they come from the bag. 
</P>
<P>
The following is a list and description of some of the cuts that you may be 
able to save some money on if you buy them by the bag. 
</P>
<P>
TRI-TIP: The tri-tip is not only the tastiest muscle of the sirloin but one of 
the tastiest of the entire beef carcass. Only a prime New York strip has the 
flavor and the tenderness of a tri-tip. 
</P>
<P>
Each tri-tip will weigh between 1 1/2 and two pounds and will average between 1 
1/4 to 1 1/2 inchesin thickness, a perfect size for the barbecue grill. A 
tri-tip seasoned simply with salt and pepper and garlic salt is the cut used 
for the Santa Maria Barbecue, a regional specialty along the south central 
coast of California. 
</P>
<P>
You may be able to save some money on steak for your barbecue grill if you buy 
a bag of tri-tips. They usually come two to the bag. 
</P>
<P>
SKIRT: Another cut of beef in a bag, the skirt steak, has become very popular 
in the past few years because it is the cut called for in another regional 
barbecue specialty -- fajitas (marinated skirt steaks that are grilled and 
placed in a tortilla with various condiments). 
</P>
<P>
The skirt is the diaphragm muscle of the beef animal. There are only two 1 1/2- 
to two-pound skirts per carcass and because of the popularity of fajitas, plus 
the popularity of the cut in Japan where it is used for teriyaki steak, the 
skirt is a hard cut to come by. If you should find a market that has some, buy 
a bag. They come three or four skirts per bag. 
</P>
<P>
FLAP: The flap, like the tri-tip, is a muscle from the sirloin section of the 
carcass, but its texture is more like that of the skirt steak. I have, in fact, 
seen it in many markets lately labeled fajitas. 
</P>
<P>
The flap is a small portion of the flank of the animal somewhat akin in texture 
to the tail of a T-bone or Porterhouse steak. They come four or five to a bag, 
each weighing just over one pound. They work well as fajitas or teriyaki steak. 
They are also wonderful sliced thin for stir-fry dishes. Since, unlike skirt 
steak, flaps have not yet been "discovered," they still are comparatively 
inexpensive. Buy a bag. 
</P>
<P>
BALL TIP: The ball tip is a small round muscle from the sirloin section. It is 
actually a portion of the sirloin tip muscle left in the sirloin when the hind 
quarter is divided into its primal cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Each ball-tip steak will weigh just over one pound and usually come three or 
four steaks per bag. They can be grilled or broiled just as they come from the 
bag, then sliced thin across the grain as you would a London Broil.

CHURCH OFFERS 80 TENANTS NEW INCENTIVES TO MOVE OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mormon Church officials in Glendale on Tuesday offered two months free rent to 
about 80 low-income tenants as an inducement to accept eviction from an 
apartment complex that the church bought and plans to demolish to expand its 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
But the renters, most of whom are senior citizens on fixed incomes, said they 
would fight to stay in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
The residents of 55 of the 93 Village Court Apartments in the 1100 block of 
North Central Avenue next to the Mormon Church, received eviction notices last 
week, one week after the city approved the church's expansion plans. The Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints plans to demolish the 55 apartments to 
enlarge its building and add a parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the church offered the tenants 120 days to move, one month's free 
rent and free use of a rental relocation service. The tenants responded by 
hiring an attorney to oppose the evictions. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, both sides met on church property over cookies and fruit punch. 
Glendale's Mormon Church leader told about 20 tenants that the church was 
adding a second month of free rent for all tenants who agree to leave by Nov. 1 
and are "cooperative and deal with us in good spirit." 
</P>
<P>
Tad Callister, the top-ranking Mormon Church official in Glendale, told the 
tenants: "I think the church is going the extra mile to be fair, don't you?" 
</P>
<P>
He said the tenants had rights, but church members had rights too. Many elderly 
churchgoers and young mothers with children had to park several blocks away 
because of inadequate parking facilities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"For them, it's inconvenient and unsafe. These people have a right to spiritual 
shelter and spiritual food. They are entitled." 
</P>
<P>
The tenants, however, were not impressed. They asked Callister where they could 
find comparable apartments in the $400 to $500 range, which is what they had 
been paying at Village Court. 
</P>
<P>
"I receive $600 a month from Social Security," said an elderly woman sitting in 
the front row. "Where can I find a nice place I can afford?" 
</P>
<P>
Callister replied that the relocation agency would be able to answer that. 
</P>
<P>
He contended that it was the church's own kindness that led to the very 
problems it faces today. 
</P>
<P>
Before the church purchased the apartment complex in 1986, the rents had been 
raised every year, Callister said. But since the church purchased the complex, 
he said, "we never raised the rent, for one reason and one reason only: to help 
accommodate the residents whom we knew would have to move." 
</P>
<P>
Had the church continued raising rents in the same fashion, he added, tenants 
would have no problem finding comparable housing because they would already be 
paying higher rents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Double Rents Every Year' 
</P>
<P>
"From an apartment manager's perspective, the best way to evict tenants is to 
double rents every year and serve 30-day eviction notices," said Village Court 
manager John Hansen. "The church is getting hit for its own kindness." 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, two tenants said they were encouraged by the church's new 
offer, but were not ready to give in. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the majority of us want to stay. That's a foregone conclusion," said 
Wayne Westand. "We're happy to see the church make another concession, but we 
are still going to appeal the evictions." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Burns, 40, who was also served with an eviction notice, added: "There is a 
great deal of fear and anxiety among the tenants. The discussion needs to 
continue. There might be another alternative for the tenants that want to 
stay." 
</P>
<P>
Tony Rodriguez, the tenants' attorney, said he will appeal the negative 
environmental impact report filed before the city's zoning commission. 
</P>
<P>
"The environment is more than air and water," he said. "It has to do with other 
aspects like traffic and housing. I'm concerned about the depletion of the 
city's already small affordable housing stock." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez also said he would look into the possibility that the evictions 
violate the housing provisions of the city's General Plan, which calls for more 
affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'More Than What's Fair' 
</P>
<P>
Callister countered: "The church is not in a spirit of negotiation. We will 
consider individual requests, but at this point I think we've offered more than 
what's fair." 
</P>
<P>
Two members of the Greater Glendale Council on Aging, a citywide organization 
of senior citizen groups, attended the meeting, but were noncommittal. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds to me like a fair proposition, but I'm not in a position to make a 
statement one way or another," said council official Frederik Pelletier. 
</P>
<P>
"The church has gone to great lengths -- more than any developer would -- to 
accommodate the tenants," said Claude Brown, another council official. "But 
eviction is a tough thing to accept. . . . I'm confident that both sides can 
work something out." 
</P>
<P>
Jess Durand, assistant director of the city's Department of Community 
Development, said the church had satisfied all city requirements and has the 
right to evict the tenants. 
</P>
<P>
"The tenants are trying to make a linkage between the city's need to build more 
affordable housing" identified in the General Plan "and a developer's plan to 
tear down a building that provides affordable housing. That connection, in my 
mind, just isn't there," Durand said.

'LAST WESTERN MYSTIC' THRIVES IN LOS FELIZ; 
</P>
<P>
HE WAS NEW AGE BEFORE THERE WAS A NEW AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Outside the mostly secretive world of esoteric sciences and the occult, few 
people are familiar with Manly P. Hall, the man his followers call "the last 
remaining Western mystic." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the hundreds of books he has written and the thriving institution he 
founded in Los Feliz 55 years ago, Hall's life story remains largely a mystery. 
He has written extensively about his afterlife but not a word about his past -- 
a subject that seems forbidden even to his closest aides. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any information about his youth," said Mike Mitchell, Hall's 
official spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
At age 88, the guru is still going strong. His biweekly Sunday lectures 
regularly attract 200 to 300 people to a pale pink Art Deco building complex 
that is home of Hall's Philosophical Research Society, or PRS. His books, which 
cover everything from reincarnation to Pythagorean philosophy to alchemy and 
black magic, sell by the thousands. 
</P>
<P>
While the PRS gift shop is stocked with volumes on witchcraft and the 
institution's library displays pictures of nightmarishly evil deities, Hall's 
lectures are anything but frightening. 
</P>
<P>
Hall recently closed his spring lecture cycle with "The Migrations of the Human 
Soul." It was a fitting season finale for a man in the last stage of his life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Soft Monotone 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in a throne-like gray velvet chair at center stage of the spacious PRS 
auditorium, impeccably dressed in a blue suit, his full head of slick, white 
hair combed back, eyeglasses adding to his dignified appearance, Hall preached 
in a soft, soothing monotone: 
</P>
<P>
"The individual as a being never dies, the body becomes exhausted of poten- 
tial. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Most listeners closed their eyes and meditated. Others avidly took notes. A few 
stared intensely at Hall. Still others nodded in agreement and whispered "Yes, 
yes!" every time he made a point. 
</P>
<P>
"When we damage our bodies, we are wearing out unnecessarily the light bulb 
that represents our spirit," Hall said. "It is essential for the mystic, as for 
the individual seeking spiritual growth, to strengthen his heart with acts of 
charity, kindness and love of nature." 
</P>
<P>
Remarkably, Hall spoke throughout the entire lecture without hesitating once, 
never retracting a word or pausing to structure thoughts. He went from Christ 
to Buddha to Vishnu to lesser gods without missing a step, always emphasizing 
that the only way to change the world is through individual spiritual growth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Feel-Good Message 
</P>
<P>
His positive, feel-good message, a cocktail of ancient philosophy, world 
religions, mysticism and, most of all, old-fashioned common sense, attracted a 
clean-cut crowd of yuppies in jogging sweats, dignified-looking schoolteachers 
and good-humored senior citizens in their Sunday suits and dresses. 
</P>
<P>
A firm believer in reincarnation, Hall uses poetic images to make death seem 
like a pleasant trip from a worn-out machine to a new body waiting to be used. 
</P>
<P>
When a person dies, Hall calmly told his audience, the spirit travels up the 
spinal chord and "enters the thousand-petal lotus, then leaves the body 
forever." Once the spirit leaves the body, Hall added, a "white horse carries 
the soul" until it finds a new body, and the process continues. 
</P>
<P>
Hall's two-hour dissertation drew rave reviews from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a lot of insights, he knows different religions," said housekeeper 
Olivia Kline, 34. 
</P>
<P>
"He has the answer to peace and the good life," said Josephine Bridges, 88, a 
retired schoolteacher. 
</P>
<P>
"He has such a depth in the understanding of knowledge," said Judith Mitchell, 
a 62-year-old receptionist from Camarillo who had come to the PRS with her 
husband and daughter. 
</P>
<P>
An extremely private man, Hall is rarely seen outside the auditorium by any but 
a few of his closest followers. During a recent interview, Hall's assistants 
screened questions and answers, and determined the length of Hall's ability to 
carry a conversation, while recording on videotape his every word. 
</P>
<P>
Hall would not discuss his private life other than to say: "I've been married 
for more than 40 years, and my wife and I are still on speaking terms." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Only a Vacation' 
</P>
<P>
He said that he is looking forward to his next life, and that he's not 
particularly worried about what form he will take. "I want to have fun, and it 
doesn't look like it's going to happen in this life," he grinned, while his 
aides laughingly celebrated his answer. Then, suddenly turning serious, Hall 
added: "I'm not worried about death because it's only a vacation." Hall's 
assistants seemed confused, apparently wondering whether to laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Next, Hall addressed black magic, witchcraft and the occult. "They are 
unpleasant forms of self-dilution," he hissed, shaking his head in disgust. "I 
don't endorse that." 
</P>
<P>
When asked why his bookstore and library are stocked with volumes dealing with 
the very subjects that Hall had just condemned, he sharply replied: "Because 
people want to research these subjects." 
</P>
<P>
A self-taught man with no university experience, Hall refused to discuss the 
work of contemporary scholars and does not speak kindly of institutions of 
higher learning, which he accuses of being too concerned with turning out 
"financially and academically successful students, but not good persons. They 
don't teach honor and integrity." 
</P>
<P>
Nor does the academic establishment seem particularly interested in Hall's 
brand of science. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Never Heard of Him' 
</P>
<P>
"I've never heard of him," said Prof. Warren Quinn, acting chairman of UCLA's 
Department of Philosophy. "A lot of what goes by the title of 'philosophy' 
doesn't have much to do with academic philosophy, but with a kind of 
inspirational folk philosophy. There's a big difference." 
</P>
<P>
Another UCLA philosopher, Rogers Albritton, said he had read books by Hall and 
visited the PRS "many, many years ago." Albritton said Hall is "not much read 
in academic philosophical circles. His studies are on the borderline between 
philosophy, religion and occult studies . . . Our interests and his overlap, 
but not much." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "Hall does have a following, obviously, and a rather beautiful 
building." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of what academics may think of him, Hall is a highly regarded, 
best-selling author in his field, the manager of a trendy Santa Monica 
bookstore specializing in New Age mysticism and esoteric sciences admiringly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of the bastions of the Western esoteric tradition," said Donald 
Heidinger, who manages the Phoenix bookstore on Santa Monica Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"Among the older authors, he's right up there with Paramahansa Yogahanda and 
Krishnamurti," Heidinger said. 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen of Hall's publications are prominently displayed in the 
bookstore's shelves, and a recent color portrait of Hall is among a dozen or so 
pictures of gurus and images of angels and saints that adorn a wall behind the 
cash register. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'New Age Movement' 
</P>
<P>
"Hall provided a lot of fuel for the New Age movement that emerged in the 
'60s," Heidinger said. "He believes that knowledge in every culture comes out 
of a perennial tradition, the West no less than the East." 
</P>
<P>
Heidinger said that while Hall cannot compete in book sales with new writers 
now in vogue, his books throughout the years have been among the store's 
steadiest movers, at a rate of from two to five a week. 
</P>
<P>
Like many of the New Age mystics, Heidinger said, Hall embraces only the 
positive aspects of the esoteric sciences. "While the esoteric tradition looks 
at both the good and the evil, the New Age acknowledges both aspects but 
emphasizes the positive, you know, white light, lots of colors, rainbows and 
that lighthearted kind of stuff." 
</P>
<P>
While the PRS gift shop carries hundreds of titles written by Hall, there are 
no biographies of the author available. 
</P>
<P>
The PRS founder was born in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada. Hall, Mitchell said, 
was raised by his grandmother and throughout his youth traveled in Canada and 
the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't appear that Mr. Hall had parents," said Mitchell, who runs his own 
public relations firm and donates his time to Hall and the PRS. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said Hall arrived in Los Angeles at age 18 when his grandmother died 
and began lecturing a year later. "His first lecture was in a bank building at 
the corner of Santa Monica Boulevard and Third Street," Mitchell said. "He 
received 65 cents in donations."

From then on, Mitchell said, Hall never looked back. By 1934, Hall had raised 
enough money to buy the Los Feliz property. A year later, the print shop were 
completed -- paid for, Mitchell said, by Hall's lecture fees and book 
royalties. 
</P>
<P>
Hall also paid for the library building, built in 1950, and the auditorium, 
which was added nine years later, so he would no longer have to lecture in 
clubhouses or theaters, Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty years ago, Hall married German-born Marie Brauer Hall, the head of an 
institution called the Veritat Foundation, which Mitchell said is dedicated to 
studying "the origin of the Founding Fathers of the U.S., and things like the 
symbolism in American money and the flag." The Halls have no children. 
</P>
<P>
For 55 years, the PRS has functioned as a nonprofit educational institution. 
The PRS operates on a $500,000 annual budget, Mitchell said, with "less than 
10%" coming from donations. The rest derives from gift shop sales and lecture 
admission fees, he said. The PRS sponsors about 400 lectures each year, 
attracting nearly 40,000 people. The library holds about 50,000 volumes, 
including about 300 written by Hall, and 5,000 works of art. All proceeds are 
spent on new editions of Hall's books, Mitchell said. "We break out even." 
</P>
<P>
The PRS buildings sit on a slope, clustered between a row of apartments on Los 
Feliz Boulevard and partly hidden behind trees and bushes. A sign in the main 
building invites: "Philosophical Research Society, Visitors Welcome." The PRS 
entrance is through a narrow corridor between the library and auditorium, which 
leads to a sunny, landscaped patio with stone benches and statues. A bust of 
young Hall stands in one corner, a sculpture of what looks like a Chinese demon 
on another. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Three Buildings 
</P>
<P>
Three buildings encircle the patio. One houses the gift shop, where Hall's 
books and cassettes are sold along with incense, crystals, Oriental bells and 
other good-luck charms, as well as an eclectic collection of books on 
witchcraft, mythology, alchemy and Eastern religions. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the store is the PRS storage room and offices, where 20 computer-aided 
PRS employees market, ship and sell thousands of Manly P. Hall books, booklets 
and cassettes to about 1,500 subscribers and bookstores nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
The second structure houses the PRS print shop and the library, which has an 
impressive collection of largely unknown medieval writers, centuries-old 
Chinese manuscripts, ancient paintings of angry Hindu gods and goddesses and 
hand-carved wooden furniture with monster-shaped armrests. 
</P>
<P>
The third building's entrance leads to a flower-covered, 300-seat auditorium, 
where Hall and assorted guest speakers deliver lectures on everything from 
"Tarot in the '80s" to "Mani, the Prophet of Light." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said that after Hall's death, the PRS will remain unchanged and 
continue to function as a "mom-and-pop" institution primarily dedicated to 
publicizing its founder's work. There is no heir-apparent to Hall's kingdom, 
Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Hall is working very hard with the PRS board of directors to insure the 
continuity of the PRS after he leaves us," he said. Having thus ensured that 
his body of work will live on for at least another generation, Manly P. Hall is 
ready for his next incarnation.

RESIDENTS OPPOSE PAROLE OFFICES TOO CLOSE TO HOME

<P>
While state prison officials at a widely publicized hearing last month delayed 
the release of Arthur Jackson, who has served more than six years in prison for 
attempting to murder actress Theresa Saldana, another 240 or so inmates quietly 
joined the fast-growing ranks of parolees living in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
For every well-known prospective parolee such as Jackson, hundreds of anonymous 
inmates serve their sentences and are paroled from prison with $200 in their 
pockets and an uneasy hope that they can jump-start their lives on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Under Wary Eyes of Agents 
</P>
<P>
Without fanfare, they report to parole offices tucked into office buildings and 
suburban shopping centers throughout the county. Under the wary eyes of parole 
agents, they seek jobs and homes in neighborhoods from Gardena to Glendale and 
from Azusa to the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Corrections estimates that during the next five years 
the parolee population in Los Angeles County will climb by about 65%, from 
22,000 to almost 37,000, which will cost taxpayers roughly $45 million more a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"These people live next door to you. . . . . They can live anywhere," said 
Edward Freeman, an assistant parole unit supervisor in North Hollywood. "When 
you put these guys in (prison), they've got to come out sooner or later," he 
said. Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside), chairman of a joint legislative 
committee on prison construction, acknowledged that the public is probably 
unaware "that there are just hundreds and hundreds" of parolees who, like 
deranged drifter Jackson, "committed serious offenses." 
</P>
<P>
Now, the explosion in the prison population -- last week it was disclosed that 
corrections officials estimate they need to build about 15 more prisons in 
addition to those already planned -- is expected to fuel a tremendous new surge 
in the number of parolees. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the recent projections, the county's escalating parole population 
had helped kindle community opposition to new parole offices in the San Gabriel 
Valley and Long Beach. Meantime, it also has highlighted a long-simmering 
debate about the role of agents, who are assigned to help inmates re-enter 
society while protecting public safety. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agents' Ranks Doubled 
</P>
<P>
In the current fiscal year the Department of Corrections, which has an overall 
budget of about $2 billion, has earmarked about $200 million for about 1,100 
agents -- whose ranks have more than doubled in the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
The budget to supervise parolees is expected to continue to climb because 
corrections officials predict that the number of parolees in California will 
soar from the current 54,000 to 82,250 in three years and 98,000 in five years. 
By comparison, just two years ago only about 37,000 people were on parole. One 
reason cited for the increase has been a jump in the number of parole violators 
-- 38% of parolees are returned to prison because they violate terms of their 
parole, according to the Corrections Department. 
</P>
<P>
(Parole officials anticipate that Los Angeles County will be especially hard 
hit by the growth in parolees because at least one-third of the inmates are 
released to the county. (Inmates are usually paroled to their home counties and 
about one-third of the state's inmates come from Los Angeles County.) 
</P>
<P>
The mounting numbers have prompted parole officials to search for more offices. 
One such search sparked protests in the San Gabriel Valley. The search also led 
to legislation by Sen. Joseph Montoya (D-Whittier), who represents the area, 
aimed at blocking new parole facilities near schools, parks and other places 
where children congregate. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the county, the Department of Corrections has plans for new or 
expanded parole offices in the Huntington Park area, Inglewood, Carson and the 
San Fernando and Antelope Valleys. So far, none of these proposals has aroused 
the public outcry that surfaced in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bill Followed Office Opening 
</P>
<P>
Montoya introduced his bill after a parole office opened in Alhambra, near the 
Monterey Park border. The office was a block from the Monterey Heights School 
and community park and next to an Alhambra High School bus stop. Residents of 
the area said they feared for their safety because of the influx of felons and 
maintained that crime increased after the office opened in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The state has promised to close its parole office later this year and Monterey 
Park and Alhambra have agreed to help pay the costs of relocating to the 
Pasadena area. But state authorities have encountered similar objections from 
residents of the Hastings Ranch section of Pasadena, prompting parole officials 
to renew their search, which is still under way. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome DiMaggio, regional parole supervisor in Los Angeles, termed the reaction 
in the San Gabriel Valley as "kind of hysterical" because, if anything, parole 
offices serve as a deterrent to crime. 
</P>
<P>
"Parole agents are peace officers. They're armed, empowered to enforce the 
law," DiMaggio said. "Parolees don't stick around parole offices." His 
department opposes as too restrictive the Montoya bill, which the Senate 
approved last month on a 24-3 vote and sent to the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale), whose district includes Pasadena, is 
carrying a more sweeping proposal in the Assembly to prohibit parole officials 
from leasing an office within three miles of a school or public park or within 
10 blocks of a residential area. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the county, parole offices also are regarded as magnets for 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Long Beach City Councilman Ray Grabinski maintains that a recent 
54.7% increase in residential burglaries in the California Heights section of 
Long Beach was triggered by relocation last year of a parole office from 
Lakewood. The office oversees 2,200 parolees. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you can put a parole office of this magnitude in a residential 
neighborhood and not expect problems," Grabinski said, especially because the 
office is near schools. Grabinski has contacted local lawmakers in an attempt 
to have the office moved. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No 'Hard Data' 
</P>
<P>
But Robert Bowman, regional parole administrator for the Long Beach area, vowed 
to keep the office in Long Beach because about 1,200 of the office's parolees 
live in Long Beach. Bowman said that in general his agency has "never had any 
hard data" to indicate that the presence of a parole office increases crime 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Police Sgt. Richard Wood said police have been unable to determine a 
link between the office and the higher crime rate. 
</P>
<P>
In nearby South Gate, city officials made it clear the welcome mat was not out 
earlier this year when parole officials sought to relocate an office from 
Huntington Park to South Gate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very negative situation. It's not something our community would 
welcome," according to Bruce Spragg, South Gate city administrative officer. 
Communities with heavy concentrations of the poor, he said, "feel they've been 
dumped on enough" and already suffer from high crime rates. 
</P>
<P>
Parole officials minimize the community protests as isolated incidents. 
Moreover, they maintain that many parolees are hard-working individuals who are 
attempting to put their lives back together. 
</P>
<P>
"For every special case or dramatic case, there are thousands of people who 
complete parole successfully and you don't hear from them," said Suzie Cohen, 
executive director of the California Probation, Parole and Correctional Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, across the county, in the Antelope Valley, parole officials sought 
to head off criticism, which they say failed to materialize, by publicizing the 
opening of an office in Palmdale next month. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to be out front, so we wouldn't have any problems," said Bob Meeks, 
supervising agent for the Antelope Valley. Among other things, Meeks said he 
appeared on a local cable television show to let people know that an office was 
opening in an industrial area and to explain the role of parole agents. 
</P>
<P>
However, disputes over siting parole offices -- prompted by the burgeoning 
caseload -- have brought renewed attention to the parole division. 
</P>
<P>
Emma L. Childers, lobbyist for the Friends Committee on Legislation, a group 
that seeks alternatives to incarceration, said that the Corrections Department 
has placed such a high priority on building prisons that the parole system has 
been under-funded. 
</P>
<P>
"The only people who aren't begging are the people in Corrections who get the 
money to build" prisons, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the key issues facing parole agents is whether they should serve as an 
adjunct to police agencies, whose main function is to arrest any parolee who 
breaks the law, or act as big brothers providing advice and counseling to 
parolees, who typically spend about three years under their supervision. 
</P>
<P>
Parole agents say that their role is a mix of police and social work. "We don't 
send everyone back . . . for something minute like jaywalking," declared 
assistant parole supervisor Freeman. 
</P>
<P>
But agents are dealing with an increasingly dangerous caseload -- which is 
about 95% male. Corrections officials estimate that about 70% of parolees have 
used drugs, and in such urban areas as Los Angeles a high percentage are 
considered gang members. 
</P>
<P>
Besides requiring many parolees to provide regular urine samples to test for 
drug use, agents say they attempt to channel parolees with drug problems into 
programs to overcome their addictions. However, they say federal and state 
funds for these programs have dried up, prompting parolees to wait sometimes 
for weeks to enter programs. 
</P>
<P>
In part because of the lack of anti-drug programs, the state has experienced a 
huge increase in the percentage of parolees returned to prison, according to a 
draft of a report prepared by Gov. George Deukmejian's blue ribbon panel on 
prisons. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, parole is revoked for one out of three parolees, compared to one out 
of 10 during the 1950s, 1960s and most of the 1970s, according to the draft 
report. As a result, a new category of incarceration has been created: the 
short-stay inmate who goes in and out of prison. 
</P>
<P>
For example, agent Russell H. Hunt, who supervises parolees out of the Gardena 
office, said that in his two years in the office, which covers parts of Compton 
and the South Bay, he's arrested some parolees four times. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Hunt, who keeps close tabs on high-risk parolees, said: "I'd just as 
soon get a guy a job than arrest him." 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "We have to try to make sure they won't commit new crimes . . . 
and (that they) become ordinary citizens and taxpayers."

OXNARD HIGH PLAN WINS FUNDS BUT NOT FRIENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MEG SULLIVAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oxnard Union High School District officials have won an eight-year battle for 
money to relocate a high school bordering Oxnard Airport, but they have not won 
the war, local officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Even as the State Allocations Board was agreeing last week to pay about $16 
million to close Oxnard High School and build its replacement elsewhere, 
several Oxnard City Council members were criticizing a key condition of the 
allocation -- that the new school's land be donated. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Somis developer Ag Land Services would donate 80 acres at 
Victoria Avenue and Gonzales Road near northwest Oxnard for the new high 
school, an elementary school, a park and possibly a junior high school. In 
exchange, the city would allow the developer to build 1,000 homes on 250 nearby 
acres and annex the sites. 
</P>
<P>
The Oxnard Planning Commission is considering the proposal as part of an 
updated General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Dorothy Maron said last week that the proposal was tantamount to 
legal bribery because it would force the city to extend its western boundaries 
about three-quarters of a mile into rich agricultural lands. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increase Pressure 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Manuel Lopez predicted that the trade-off would increase pressure to 
develop other agricultural properties along Victoria while pouring more traffic 
onto the already clogged thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
"The traffic will be horrendous," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Local Agency Formation Commission, which would have to approve the 
annexation, has reacted warily to the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
In a May 17 letter to Ag Land President Dave O. White, LAFCO Executive Officer 
Robert L. Braitman said LAFCO probably would allow schools on the property but 
not "trade-offs which undermine established policies for the preservation and 
conservation of prime agricultural resources." 
</P>
<P>
But Bob Carter, district superintendent, said the proposal is a creative 
solution to mounting enrollment problems at a time of uncertain funding for new 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the school needs to be relocated, and others have felt that we need 
to relocate it," he said. "We hope to convince everyone that this is 
appropriate for our students." 
</P>
<P>
White is hopeful too. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many units that are going to be built in Oxnard in the next 20 or 
30 years on comparable land as far as agricultural productivity goes," he said. 
"It just seems that our development has a lot more to offer." 
</P>
<P>
The city supported a similar exchange when White offered to donate land for the 
proposed California State University campus. That deal fell through when Cal 
State trustees selected the Taylor Ranch site in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council could decide the trade-off issue as soon as the fall, when it 
reviews the updated General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, even those who most strongly oppose the trade-off support 
replacing Oxnard High School. 
</P>
<P>
The school, which is 1,800 feet from the foot of the airport's main runway on K 
and 5th streets, lies under the flight path of planes arriving or departing 
from the east. 
</P>
<P>
School officials say that frequent airplane traffic disrupts classes and 
threatens their students. Three plane accidents have occurred near the school 
in recent years, they said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Safety Reasons 
</P>
<P>
The State Division of Aeronautics says it will not allow the district to build 
a new school on the site of Oxnard High, which was built before the airport. 
For safety reasons, the agency has rejected proposed school sites that are 
farther away from the airport than the Oxnard High site. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard's updated General Plan, which will be the city's blueprint through 2020, 
recognizes the site's risk. It reserves half of the high school site as a 
buffer usable only for purposes that attract few people, such as agriculture or 
parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
School officials cite the dilapidated condition of the school, parts of which 
date to 1922, as another reason for replacing it. 
</P>
<P>
In the girl's locker room, grime covers walls, ceilings and floors. In typing 
classes, electrical cords snake across the floors because antiquated wiring 
does not provide safer alternatives. And in the shop class, a water fountain 
has been turned off to boost water pressure in aging pipes. 
</P>
<P>
"That northwest site is very important for our youngsters," Carter said.

BELMONT GROUP WANTS BAN ON BOAT, RV STREET PARKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with continued parking problems, a Belmont Shore property owners 
association is asking their city councilwoman to ban on-street parking of boat 
trailers and large recreational vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Councilwoman Jan Hall, the Belmont Shore Improvement Assn. asks 
that city law be amended to exclude "on-street parking at any time of 
unattached trailers, such as boat trailers, throughout all of Belmont Shore." 
</P>
<P>
The group also wants to prohibit parking of any vehicle longer than 20 feet or 
more than 84 inches wide, except vans being used for deliveries, tow trucks or 
vehicles being used to make repair calls.

2 RESTAURANTS PRAISED FOR HIRING DISABLED WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Whittier Union High School District has recognized two local fast-food 
restaurants for hiring and training disabled students and adults, school 
officials announced. 
</P>
<P>
At a luncheon and awards ceremony recently, officials of the district's Career 
Assessment and Placement Center cited Carl's Jr., on East Rosecrans Avenue in 
La Mirada, and Wienerschnitzel, on Leffingwell Road in Whittier, for teaching 
work skills to local disabled people, district spokeswoman Ann M. Garten said.

'TAKE NO PRISONERS' WAR WITH DEVELOPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Score one great big victory for the bad guys! It's amazing how fixing that 
innocent 25,000-truckload mistake (Oakmont View development, Glendale Section, 
June 22) just happens to provide access to 91 acres of land owned by the people 
who made the mistake. I understand that the alternative solution is not 
attractive, but I am very disappointed with the decision of the council to 
allow the cut as opposed to trucking in the fill. 
</P>
<P>
Developers will use every means available to control new land and to build as 
many buildings as possible on the land that they acquire. They will flatten 
Glendale's hills like a pool table without a second thought whenever they have 
an opportunity. It is their business and it means millions of dollars to them. 
As land becomes more difficult to obtain, we can expect their methods to become 
even more drastic and less ethical. 
</P>
<P>
If we in Glendale hope to keep any of our hills and mountains, we need to 
understand that we are in an unending and "take no prisoners" war with the 
developers. If our elected officials can't or won't stop them, it is just a 
matter of time before the hills are gone forever.

PLANS FOR ECHO PARK BRANCH LIBRARY ON AGENDA FOR COMMUNITY MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles library officials will hold a community meeting Monday to discuss 
plans for a new Echo Park Branch Library and ways to improve services. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Los Angeles Board of Library Commissioners, library 
administrators and Los Angeles Councilwoman Gloria Molina will take part in the 
meeting at 6:30 p.m. at Angelus Temple, 1100 Glendale Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
April passage of the library funding proposition has provided money to replace 
the overcrowded branch, which has been in leased quarters at 515 N. Laveta 
Terrace since the old branch was damaged in the 1971 Sylmar earthquake and 
later demolished. 
</P>
<P>
The library's Branch Facilities Plan recommends a building of 12,500 square 
feet on a street with heavy retail activity. The meeting will cover the process 
of acquiring a site and preparing or constructing a building. 
</P>
<P>
A second part of the meeting will focus on a state library program called 
Partnership for Change. Echo Park has been selected as one of three libraries 
in Los Angeles to be part of the $3-million study of program changes oriented 
toward specific ethnic and racial populations within their areas. 
</P>
<P>
Library officials will outline the steps in the study, which begins with a 
community needs assessment.

PRE-DAWN FIREWORKS SHOW CALLED A SMASHING SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM OVEREND, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Proclaiming this year's 5 a.m. fireworks show in Ventura a smashing success, 
Mayor Jim Monahan on Wednesday suggested that the city consider an even earlier 
start to its July 4th celebrations in future years. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor, stressing that "at the moment it's only a thought in my head," said 
he thinks that it might be a good idea to stage the traditional July 4th 
fireworks show the night of July 3. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this was probably the best Fourth of July ever in Ventura," Monaghan 
said. "I think because of the success of the day that the morning fireworks 
will be continued next year. 
</P>
<P>
"But in the future, we might need to have both a morning and an evening 
fireworks show," he said. "I've talked to a lot of people who like both. 
Another option would be to have the fireworks on July 3 as a prelude to the 
4th. That way the 4th could be for quieter events like family picnics." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura's fireworks were held early this year because of traffic congestion and 
some crowd problems at the beach during nighttime displays in past years. 
</P>
<P>
Monahan, estimating the morning crowd at between 10,000 and 20,000, said he 
watched the fireworks from his boat off the Ventura Pier. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sees No Early Action 
</P>
<P>
The mayor made it clear that he expects no immediate action on his idea of 
starting the nation's annual birthday party a day ahead of most of the rest of 
the country, but he said he will present it anyway to the special events 
committee of the Ventura City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Many who had not planned to attend the pre-dawn show Tuesday were jolted awake 
by it, particularly residents in the city's downtown and beach areas. In 
hillside neighborhoods, some residents took to their decks and rooftops to gaze 
at the display. 
</P>
<P>
Along the beach, families with young children, either half asleep or 
exceedingly awake, sat on picnic blankets for the pyrotechnics. 
</P>
<P>
Some even enjoyed the thought of arising for the early-morning ritual. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like the Rose Bowl, only warmer," said Dan Snider, a San Fernando Valley 
resident who was visiting his grandchildren.

SMUG, AGGRESSIVE IGNORANCE LIVES ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reading Ginger Bremberg's description of the homeless in Glendale as people 
"who urinate on news racks and yell obscenities in the streets" (Glendale 
Section, June 22) is an infuriating reminder that the Reagan legacy of smug and 
aggressive ignorance in the face of society's problems lives on. It is shameful 
and personally embarrassing to see that Glendale's once and future mayor is 
shallow enough to believe anyone with any intelligence will buy the offensive 
argument that the homeless are that way by choice. If she did more than drive 
by them with her windows closed, she'd see how pathetically unenlightened her 
statement is. 
</P>
<P>
Or would she? She and the majority of the Glendale City Council seem pretty 
content to absolve themselves of any responsibility, moral or otherwise, to the 
homeless of their city. Their attitude that "someone ought to do something 
about this, as long as it's not me" is self-defeating and insulting. 
Personally, I wish we didn't have any homeless in Glendale too, but I'm aware 
and logical enough to realize that since we do, simply shutting my door and 
hoping someone else does something about them isn't the answer. It's time for 
the City Council to roll down their windows and open their eyes.

VALUE OF TAXABLE PROPERTY IN VENTURA COUNTY RISES 13% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County Assessor R. J. Sanford said this week that the value of taxable 
property in the county had increased by about 13% in the last fiscal year, but 
he predicted that next year's growth might decrease about 10%. 
</P>
<P>
Sanford said rising interest rates and a decreased rate of home sales could 
account for the fall. 
</P>
<P>
At a Wednesday press conference announcing closure of the local assessment roll 
July 1, Sanford said the county's total valuation was more than $33.4 billion. 
Commercial and industrial development made up 22% of the $3.8 billion increase 
since last year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the housing industry had not matched the growth of other businesses, 
resulting in a housing shortage among people drawn for newly created jobs. 
</P>
<P>
According to the assessor's figures, the taxable value of property in Ventura 
County cities rose by these amounts: Fillmore, 14.24%; Ojai, 12.39%; Oxnard, 
13.76%; Santa Paula, 10.44%; Ventura, 9.4%; Port Hueneme, 10.72%; Camarillo, 
13.47%; Thousand Oaks, 14.59%; Simi Valley, 13.32%, and Moorpark, 18%.

WEST TOPS EAST IN 605 ALL-STAR GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The West team, led by Poly High School quarterback Michael Carter and Dominguez 
High running back Kenny Barnes, defeated the East, 26-20, in the annual 605 
All-Star Game Friday night at La Mirada High School stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Carter completed six of 10 passes for 144 yards. Barnes, who gained 55 yards, 
scored two of the West's touchdowns; the others came on a pass from Bellflower 
halfback Shawn Jones to Montebello's Mike Valenzuela, and a pass from Carter to 
Poly's Stanley Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
Millikan's Monte Boulware ran 45 yards for a TD for the East, which also got 
scoring passes from St. Paul's Greg Willig to Wilson's Wendell Valentine and 
Millikan's Rod Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
Poly's Mike Loyola and La Mirada's Mark Koenig were named the game's 
outstanding linemen, and Carter and linebacker Steve Hayes of Cerritos were the 
top backs. Barnes was selected player of the game.

HOMELESS TRAILERS CONVERTED INTO OFFICES; 
</P>
<P>
DEAL AMONG 3 AGENCIES ALLOWS TEMPORARY USE BY PARKS DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five of the 102 mobile homes purchased two years ago by the city of Los Angeles 
as shelters for the homeless are being used as temporary offices for city 
employees, including some who work at a parks maintenance yard on Chevy Chase 
Drive in Atwater. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Recreation and Parks Commissioners voted last week to formalize a 
little-known deal among the city's Housing Authority, the Community 
Redevelopment Agency and the Department of Recreation and Parks. Under the 
arrangement, the parks department has been unofficially using the five trailers 
as offices since early this year. 
</P>
<P>
"It is upsetting to me," said Toni Reinis, southern region director of the 
California Homeless Coalition, which was one of several homeless groups that 
supported purchasing the trailers from a Utah power company. "I would like to 
see homeless families being sited because that was the purpose of the 
trailers." 
</P>
<P>
The Housing Authority had originally been instructed by Mayor Tom Bradley to 
put the 102 trailers on land at public housing projects. When opposition from 
some project tenants made that task difficult, then-Housing Authority Executive 
Director Leila Gonzalez-Correa last fall offered to lend the five trailers to 
the parks department. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They Were Available' 
</P>
<P>
"We really needed the additional office space," said James E. Hadaway, general 
manager of the Department of Recreation and Parks. "I was talking to the head 
of the Housing Authority one day, and she said they were available." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley spokesman Bill Chandler said the mayor supports the arrangement because 
the five trailers were unused and in storage. To date, the city has made 61 of 
the trailers available to homeless families. The remaining trailers are being 
stored in a maintenance yard near Torrance, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't like there has been a great demand from people asking for the 
trailers" to house the homeless, said Michele Roth, a spokeswoman for the 
Housing Authority. "We have had requests, but we have had difficulties placing 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Georgiann Rudder, who oversees city parks in the Harbor area and Westside, said 
the trailers provide badly needed office space, storage facilities and rest 
rooms for maintenance employees in different parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Rudder said the trailers give her work crews greater flexibility in caring for 
parks in the department's Pacific region, which extends from Mulholland Drive 
to Point Fermin. With trailers in both the Westside and South Bay, she said, 
crews are able to save time. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement with the parks department, the Housing Authority can 
reclaim the trailers on 30 days notice. Chandler said that provision guarantees 
that the trailers will be available for transitional housing as soon as the 
city finds sites. In the meantime, he said, the city is also saving storage 
costs for the trailers, although he did not know how much. 
</P>
<P>
"The trailers program is working, and it will continue to expand," Chandler 
said. "We will place 15 more in the near future. We are getting very close." 
</P>
<P>
As of last month, according to city statistics, 178 families have been housed 
in the trailers since the first ones were placed at the Ramona Gardens housing 
project in northeast Los Angeles early last year. With the assistance of local 
agencies, 75% of the families have found permanent housing during their stay in 
the trailers, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Activists Object 
</P>
<P>
But the city's success in helping homeless families by providing the temporary 
housing only makes the arrangement with the parks department more difficult to 
swallow for some activists for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"If they can use them on recreation and parks property for offices, why can't 
they use them for homeless families on recreation and park properties?" Reinis 
asked. "If they were able to site them for offices, they definitely should have 
been able to site them for families." 
</P>
<P>
Others said they would rather see the trailers housing homeless families but 
had no objection to the city's using them in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to see any resources being wasted when they can be used for something," 
said Lynn Davis, director of housing services for Volunteers of America, which 
provides social services for homeless families in five trailers in Hollywood. 
"There is a tremendous need for the trailers, but I think there needs to be 
care taken to find the most appropriate sites." 
</P>
<P>
Chandler said the city has conducted an extensive search for available sites, 
but that the parks property being used for the five offices is not appropriate 
for homeless families. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not simply a factor of finding a piece of property where you can fit a 
trailer," he said. "The whole point of this program is offering job training 
possibilities and helping to get the head of the homeless families to enter the 
work force. There certainly is a lot that goes into providing the services for 
the people who would live in the trailers." 
</P>
<P>
Reinis agreed that social services are important, but said it is also important 
to get families off the streets and into the trailers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'First Priority' 
</P>
<P>
"The first priority is getting them all placed; then we can start looking at 
the most appropriate placements and the programs," Reinis said. "We have got to 
get these things out of storage." 
</P>
<P>
The deal that made five trailers available for the parks department was 
approved by Housing Authority commissioners in October, and a short time later 
the CRA's housing director also endorsed it. CRA consent was necessary because 
the agency paid for the trailers with $1.4 million from a replacement fund for 
low-income housing torn down during Bunker Hill redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
"They just wanted to make sure we had no problem with it," said John Maguire, 
the agency's deputy administrator for housing services. "Technically the 
agreement" to purchase the trailers "says they are supposed to be used for 
housing. I didn't have a problem with an interim use." 
</P>
<P>
The five trailers are being used in a variety of ways. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Used by Crews 
</P>
<P>
The trailer near Rancho Park, sandwiched between a red-brick office building 
and a cluttered storage yard, serves as home base for landscape, tree trimming 
and park maintenance crews that take care of parks and other city property 
throughout the Westside, Rudder said. The brown and beige two-bedroom trailer 
houses several filing cabinets and desks and serves as a crew room, where 
workers get their morning assignments, she said. 
</P>
<P>
A second trailer has been placed on blocks in a parking lot behind Rudder's 
office at the Pacific region headquarters on Palos Verdes Drive North in San 
Pedro. Although the administrative building is just 7 years old, Rudder said 
the department has already outgrown it. 
</P>
<P>
That trailer serves as home base for craftsmen -- plumbers, carpenters and 
electricians -- who work at parks, libraries and other city facilities in the 
Harbor area, she said. 
</P>
<P>
A third trailer has been placed at the end of a dusty road near remote parking 
lots at Harbor College in Wilmington. Rudder said the trailer is used by 
paving, earthmoving and tree-trimming crews that take care of the grounds at 
parks and other city properties. 
</P>
<P>
Two other trailers have been placed closer to downtown Los Angeles. One, near 
Atwater Park, serves as an office for the director of swimming and his staff 
because of a shortage of space in a nearby parks building. The other is used by 
maintenance employees for offices and storage near E. G. Roberts swimming pool 
on Pico Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"This new trailer we have made just a world of difference," said George 
Stigile, maintenance supervisor for parks in the department's metropolitan 
region. "It was really kind of a godsend. It gave us an ability to do a better 
job and service the community. We were really cramped for space before."

WELKER ACCEPTS OXNARD COLLEGE BASEBALL POSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sean Waters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reg Welker hopes his blend of competitiveness and practical jokes plays well on 
the junior college circuit. 
</P>
<P>
Welker, who coached Hueneme high baseball team for nine years, has been 
selected as the new coach at Oxnard College and awaits final approval from 
Ventura County Community College District. He will replace George Peraza, who 
resigned in May after one season as coach of the Condors. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is an important step up for my coaching career," said Welker, who 
will remain as Hueneme's athletic director. "I've reached a point where I 
needed a new challenge. It was time to either get a new coaching job or time to 
move on to another career." 
</P>
<P>
Welker had a 124-105-5 record after taking over the Hueneme program in 1981. He 
won his only Channel League title in his first season. 
</P>
<P>
And although he didn't win a bunch of championships, Welker did earn the 
respect of his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"Reggie was my best friend in baseball," Ventura Coach Dan Smith said. "I will 
miss his competitiveness. He played to win and at the same time, he played with 
class. When the game was over, it was over. There were never any grudges." 
</P>
<P>
Welker and Smith have both been known to employ practical jokes to gain the 
upper hand in their friendly rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
They both have pulled worm-eating stunts to motivate their players. This season 
against Ventura, Welker handed in a lineup card with the names Robinson, Reese, 
Snyder and Gilliam printed on it. 
</P>
<P>
Smith thought they were players called up from Hueneme's junior varsity, but 
they were really the names of the 1959 Brooklyn Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't see anyone I recognized," Smith admitted. "He got me with that one." 
</P>
<P>
Endless summer: Santa Clara Coach Lou Cvijanovich has developed a reputation 
for running grueling, militaristic-type basketball practices that are not meant 
for the fainthearted. But his players won't have to worry about those practices 
until November. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they will compete in four summer tournaments, attend three basketball 
camps and play in two summer leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't hold practices during the summer," Cvijanovich said. "I think kids 
should go out and have some fun. I give everyone a chance to play and let the 
younger kids develop. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think winning a summer league is a prerequisite to winning a CIF 
championship." 
</P>
<P>
The Saints, who won the State Division IV championship last season, began their 
vacation by attending a weekend camp held by Coach Jerry Tarkanian at 
Nevada-Las Vegas. Cvijanovich and Santa Clara boosters drove the players in 
vans to Las Vegas and they spent three days participating in drills and playing 
in games. 
</P>
<P>
"They play nothing but man-to-man defense," Cvijanovich said. "They work the 
living daylights out of the kids. It's great for the kids because they have fun 
and it reinforces what we teach them in practice." 
</P>
<P>
It also gives college coaches an opportunity to scout prospective Division I 
players. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is talking about Shon Tarver," Cvijanovich said about last year's 
State Division IV Player of the Year. "I think he'll have his pick of what 
college he wants to attend." 
</P>
<P>
Cvijanovich will split up his squad to compete in two tournaments beginning 
today at Fairfax and Carson highs. 
</P>
<P>
The Saints will conclude their vacation by attending a mini-camp at Cal State 
Long Beach run by 49er Coach Joe Harrington. 
</P>
<P>
Starting over: Playing without any returning starters, the Santa Clara girls' 
basketball team faces its first test of the summer when it competes next week 
in the Santana tournament in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-team tournament begins July 13th and features perennial powers Point 
Loma and Brea-Olinda. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no height, no quickness and no real experience," Santa Clara Coach Tom 
McConville said. "If we win a game, it will be interesting." 
</P>

CITY WORKERS OCCUPYING 5 TRAILERS PURCHASED AS HOUSING FOR HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Five of the 102 mobile homes purchased two years ago by the city of Los Angeles 
as shelters for the homeless are being used as temporary offices for city 
employees, including some who work in San Pedro and Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Recreation and Parks Commissioners voted last week to formalize a 
little-known deal among the city's Housing Authority, the Community 
Redevelopment Agency and the Department of Recreation and Parks. Under the 
arrangement, the parks department has been unofficially using the five trailers 
as offices since early this year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It Is Upsetting to Me' 
</P>
<P>
"It is upsetting to me," said Toni Reinis, southern region director of the 
California Homeless Coalition, which was one of several homeless groups that 
supported purchasing the trailers from a Utah power company. "I would like to 
see homeless families being sited because that was the purpose of the 
trailers." 
</P>
<P>
The Housing Authority originally had been instructed by Mayor Tom Bradley to 
put the 102 trailers on land at public housing projects. When opposition of 
some project tenants made that task difficult, then-Housing Authority Executive 
Director Leila Gonzalez-Correa last fall offered to lend the five trailers to 
the parks department. 
</P>
<P>
"We really needed the additional office space," said James E. Hadaway, general 
manager of the Department of Recreation and Parks. "I was talking to the head 
of the Housing Authority one day, and she said they were available." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley spokesman Bill Chandler said the mayor supports the arrangement because 
the five trailers were unused and in storage. To date, the city has made 61 of 
the trailers available to homeless families. The remaining trailers are being 
stored in a maintenance yard near Torrance, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't like there has been a great demand from people asking for the 
trailers (to house the homeless)," said Michele Roth, a spokeswoman for the 
Housing Authority. "We have had requests, but we have had difficulties placing 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Georgiann Rudder, who oversees city parks in the harbor area and Westside, said 
the trailers provide badly needed office space, storage facilities and rest 
rooms for maintenance employees in different parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Rudder said the trailers give her work crews greater flexibility in caring for 
parks in the department's Pacific region, which extends from Mulholland Drive 
to Point Fermin. With trailers in both the Westside and South Bay, she said, 
crews are able to save time. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement with the parks department, the Housing Authority can 
reclaim the five trailers on 30 days' notice. Chandler said that provision 
guarantees that the trailers will be available for transitional housing as soon 
as the city finds sites. In the meantime, he said, the city is also saving 
storage costs for the trailers, although he did not know how much. 
</P>
<P>
"The trailers program is working, and it will continue to expand," Chandler 
said. "We will place 15 more in the near future. We are getting very close." 
</P>
<P>
As of last month, according to city statistics, 178 families have been housed 
in the trailers since the first ones were placed at Ramona Gardens housing 
project in northeast Los Angeles early last year. With the assistance of local 
agencies, 75% of the families have found permanent housing during their stay in 
the trailers, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Activists Object 
</P>
<P>
But the city's success in helping homeless families by providing the temporary 
housing only makes the arrangement with the parks department more difficult to 
swallow for some activists for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"If they can use them on recreation and parks property for offices, why can't 
they use them for homeless families on recreation and park properties?" asked 
Reinis, of the homeless coalition. "If they were able to site them for offices, 
they definitely should have been able to site them for families." 
</P>
<P>
Others said they would rather see the trailers housing homeless families but 
had no objection to the city's using them in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to see any resources being wasted when they can be used for something," 
said Lynn Davis, director of housing services for Volunteers of America, which 
provides social services for homeless families in five trailers in Hollywood. 
"There is a tremendous need for the trailers, but I think there needs to be 
care taken to find the most appropriate sites." 
</P>
<P>
Chandler said the city has conducted an extensive search for available sites, 
but, he said, the parks property now being used for the five offices is not 
appropriate for homeless families. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not simply a factor of finding a piece of property where you can fit a 
trailer," he said. "The whole point of this program is offering job training 
possibilities and helping to get the head of the homeless families to enter the 
work force. There certainly is a lot that goes into providing the services for 
the people who would live in the trailers." 
</P>
<P>
Reinis agreed that social services are important, but said it is also important 
to get families off the streets and into the trailers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'First Priority' 
</P>
<P>
"The first priority is getting them all placed, then we can start looking at 
the most appropriate placements and the programs," Reinis said. "We have got to 
get these things out of storage." 
</P>
<P>
The deal that made five trailers available for the parks department was 
approved by Housing Authority commissioners in October, and a short time later 
the CRA's housing director also endorsed it. CRA consent was necessary because 
the agency paid for the trailers with $1.4 million from a replacement fund for 
low-income housing torn down during Bunker Hill redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
"They just wanted to make sure we had no problem with it," said John Maguire, 
the agency's deputy administrator for housing services. "Technically the 
agreement (to purchase the trailers) says they are supposed to be used for 
housing. I didn't have a problem with an interim use." 
</P>
<P>
The five trailers are being used in a variety of ways. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Used by Crews 
</P>
<P>
The trailer near Rancho Park, sandwiched between a red-brick office building 
and a cluttered storage yard, serves as home base for landscape, tree trimming 
and park maintenance crews that take care of parks and other city property 
throughout the Westside, Rudder said. The brown and beige two-bedroom trailer 
houses several filing cabinets and desks and serves as a crew room, where 
workers get their morning assignments, she said. 
</P>
<P>
A second trailer has been placed on blocks in a parking lot behind Rudder's 
office at the Pacific region headquarters on north Palos Verdes Drive North in 
San Pedro. Although the administrative building is just 7 years old, Rudder 
said the department has already outgrown it. 
</P>
<P>
The Palos Verdes Drive trailer serves as home base for craftsmen -- plumbers, 
carpenters and electricians -- who work at parks, libraries and other city 
facilities in the harbor area, she said. 
</P>
<P>
A third trailer has been placed at the end of a dusty road near remote parking 
lots at Harbor College in Wilmington. Rudder said the trailer is used by 
paving, earth moving and tree trimming crews that take care of the grounds at 
parks and other city properties. 
</P>
<P>
Two other trailers have been placed closer to downtown Los Angeles. One, near 
Atwater Park, serves as an office for the director of swimming and his staff 
because of a shortage of space in a nearby parks building. The other is used by 
maintenance employees for offices and storage near E. G. Roberts swimming pool 
on Pico Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"This new trailer we have made just a world of difference," said George 
Stigile, maintenance supervisor for parks in the department's metropolitan 
region. "It was really kind of a godsend. It gave us an ability to do a better 
job and service the community. We were really cramped for space before."

COUNTY BRACES FOR BOOM IN PAROLEE POPULATION 
</P>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While state prison officials at a widely publicized hearing last month delayed 
the release of Arthur Jackson, who has served more than six years in prison for 
attempting to murder actress Theresa Saldana, another 240 or so inmates quietly 
joined the fast-growing ranks of parolees living in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
For every well-known prospective parolee such as Jackson, hundreds of anonymous 
inmates serve their sentences and are paroled from prison with $200 in their 
pockets and an uneasy hope that they can jump-start their lives on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
Without fanfare, they report to parole offices tucked into office buildings and 
suburban shopping centers throughout the county. Under the wary eyes of parole 
agents, they seek jobs and homes in neighborhoods from Gardena to Glendale and 
from Azusa to the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Corrections estimates that during the next five years 
the parolee population in Los Angeles County will climb by about 65%, from 
22,000 to almost 37,000, which will cost taxpayers roughly $45 million more a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"These people live next door to you. . . . They can live anywhere," said Edward 
Freeman, an assistant parole unit supervisor in North Hollywood. "When you put 
these guys in (prison), they've got to come out sooner or later," he said. Sen. 
Robert Presley (D-Riverside), chairman of a joint legislative committee on 
prison construction, acknowledged that the public is probably unaware "that 
there are just hundreds and hundreds" of parolees who, like deranged drifter 
Jackson, "committed serious offenses." 
</P>
<P>
Now, the explosion in the prison population -- last week it was disclosed that 
corrections officials estimate they need to build about 15 more prisons in 
addition to those already planned -- is expected to fuel a tremendous new surge 
in the number of parolees. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the recent projections, the county's escalating parole population 
had helped kindle community opposition to new parole offices in the San Gabriel 
Valley and Long Beach. Meantime, it also has highlighted a long-simmering 
debate about the role of agents, who are assigned to help inmates re-enter 
society while protecting public safety. 
</P>
<P>
In the current fiscal year the Department of Corrections, which has an overall 
budget of about $2 billion, has earmarked about $200 million for about 1,100 
agents -- whose ranks have more than doubled in the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
The budget to supervise parolees is expected to continue to climb because 
corrections officials predict that the number of parolees in California will 
soar from the current 54,000 to 82,250 in three years and 98,000 in five years. 
By comparison, just two years ago only about 37,000 people were on parole. One 
reason cited for the increase has been a jump in the number of parole violators 
-- 38% of parolees are returned to prison because they violate terms of their 
parole, according to the Corrections Department. 
</P>
<P>
Parole officials anticipate that Los Angeles County will be especially hard hit 
by the growth in parolees because at least one-third of the inmates are 
released to the county. (Inmates are usually paroled to their home counties and 
about one-third of the state's inmates come from Los Angeles County.) 
</P>
<P>
The mounting numbers have prompted parole officials to search for more offices. 
One such search sparked protests in the San Gabriel Valley. The search also led 
to legislation by Sen. Joseph Montoya (D-Whittier), who represents the area, 
aimed at blocking new parole facilities near schools, parks and other places 
where children congregate. 
</P>
<P>
In the South Bay, the parole caseload also is growing. Parole offices in 
Gardena and Inglewood now supervise about 2,500 cases. In part because of the 
increase in parolees, state officials expect within the next six months to open 
an office in Carson to supervise 1,000 or so parolees -- roughly half of whom 
now are being supervised out of an office in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Bowman, regional administrator, said parole officials are negotiating a 
lease for an office on Del Amo Boulevard west of the Long Beach Freeway in an 
industrial section of Carson. Bowman said he is not aware of any community 
opposition to the office. 
</P>
<P>
But on Wednesday Carson Mayor Michael Mitoma said he was unaware of the office 
being sought in his city and plans to seek more information about the state's 
plans. "I don't think anybody wants to have people who have been convicted of a 
felony running in and out of our city," Mitoma said. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the county, the Department of Corrections has plans for new or 
expanded parole offices in the Huntington Park area, Inglewood, Carson and the 
San Fernando and Antelope Valleys. So far, none of these proposals has aroused 
the public outcry that surfaced in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya introduced his bill after a parole office opened in Alhambra, near the 
Monterey Park border. The office was a block from the Monterey Heights School 
and community park and next to an Alhambra High School bus stop. Residents of 
the area said they feared for their safety because of the influx of felons and 
maintained that crime increased after the office opened in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The state has promised to close its parole office later this year and Monterey 
Park and Alhambra have agreed to help pay the costs of relocating to the 
Pasadena area. But state authorities have encountered similar objections from 
residents of the Hastings Ranch section of Pasadena, prompting parole officials 
to renew their search, which is still under way. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deterrent to Crime 
</P>
<P>
Jerome DiMaggio, regional parole supervisor in Los Angeles, termed the reaction 
in the San Gabriel Valley as "kind of hysterical" because, if anything, parole 
offices serve as a deterrent to crime. 
</P>
<P>
"Parole agents are peace officers. They're armed, empowered to enforce the 
law," DiMaggio said. "Parolees don't stick around parole offices." His 
department opposes as too restrictive the Montoya bill, which the Senate 
approved last month on a 24-3 vote and sent to the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale), whose district includes Pasadena, is 
carrying a more sweeping proposal in the Assembly to prohibit parole officials 
from leasing an office within three miles of a school or public park or within 
10 blocks of a residential area. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the county, parole offices also are regarded as magnets for 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Long Beach City Councilman Ray Grabinski maintains that a recent 
54.7% increase in residential burglaries in the California Heights section of 
Long Beach was triggered by relocation last year of a parole office from 
Lakewood. The office oversees 2,200 parolees. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you can put a parole office of this magnitude in a residential 
neighborhood and not expect problems," Grabinski said last week, especially 
because the office is near schools. Grabinski has contacted local lawmakers in 
an attempt to have the office moved. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No 'Hard Data' 
</P>
<P>
But Robert Bowman, regional parole administrator for the Long Beach area, vowed 
to keep the office in Long Beach because about 1,200 of the office's parolees 
live in Long Beach. Bowman said that in general his agency has "never had any 
hard data" to indicate that the presence of a parole office increases crime 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Police Sgt. Richard Wood said police have been unable to determine a 
link between the office and the higher crime rate. 
</P>
<P>
In nearby South Gate, city officials made it clear the welcome mat was not out 
earlier this year when parole officials sought to relocate an office from 
Huntington Park to South Gate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very negative situation. It's not something our community would 
welcome," according to Bruce Spragg, South Gate city administrative officer. 
Communities with heavy concentrations of the poor, he said, "feel they've been 
dumped on enough" and already suffer from high crime rates. 
</P>
<P>
Parole officials minimize the community protests as isolated incidents. 
Moreover, they maintain that many parolees are hard-working individuals who are 
attempting to put their lives back together. 
</P>
<P>
"For every special case or dramatic case, there are thousands of people who 
complete parole successfully and you don't hear from them," said Suzie Cohen, 
executive director of the California Probation, Parole and Correctional Assn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opening Publicized 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, across the county, in the Antelope Valley, parole officials sought 
to head off criticism, which they say failed to materialize, by publicizing the 
opening of an office in Palmdale next month. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to be out front, so we wouldn't have any problems," said Bob Meeks, 
supervising agent for the Antelope Valley. Among other things, Meeks said he 
appeared on a local cable television show to let people know that an office was 
opening in an industrial area and to explain the role of parole agents. 
</P>
<P>
However, disputes over siting parole offices -- prompted by the burgeoning 
caseload -- have brought renewed attention to the parole division. 
</P>
<P>
Emma L. Childers, lobbyist for the Friends Committee on Legislation, a group 
that seeks alternatives to incarceration, said that the Corrections Department 
has placed such a high priority on building prisons that the parole system has 
been under-funded. 
</P>
<P>
"The only people who aren't begging are the people in Corrections who get the 
money to build" prisons, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the key issues facing parole agents is whether they should serve as an 
adjunct to police agencies, whose main function is to arrest any parolee who 
breaks the law, or act as big brothers providing advice and counseling to 
parolees, who typically spend about three years under their supervision. 
</P>
<P>
Parole agents say that their role is a mix of police and social work. "We don't 
send everyone back . . . for something minute like jaywalking," declared 
assistant parole supervisor Freeman. 
</P>
<P>
But agents are dealing with an increasingly dangerous caseload -- which is 
about 92% male. Corrections officials estimate that about 70% of parolees have 
used drugs, and in such urban areas as Los Angeles a high percentage are 
considered gang members. 
</P>
<P>
Besides requiring many parolees to provide regular urine samples to test for 
drug use, agents say they attempt to channel parolees with drug problems into 
programs to overcome their addictions. However, they say federal and state 
funds for these programs have dried up, prompting parolees to wait sometimes 
for weeks to enter programs. 
</P>
<P>
In part because of the lack of anti-drug programs, the state has experienced a 
huge increase in the percentage of parolees returned to prison, according to a 
draft of a report prepared by Gov. George Deukmejian's blue ribbon panel on 
prisons. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, parole is revoked for one out of three parolees, compared to one out 
of 10 during the 1950s, 1960s and most of the 1970s, according to the draft 
report. As a result, a new category of incarceration has been created: the 
short-stay inmate who goes in and out of prison. 
</P>
<P>
For example, agent Russell H. Hunt, who supervises parolees out of the Gardena 
office, said that in his two years in the office, which covers parts of Compton 
and the South Bay, he's arrested some parolees four times. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Hunt, who keeps close tabs on high-risk parolees, said: "I'd just as 
soon get a guy a job than arrest him." 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "We have to try to make sure they won't commit new crimes . . . 
and (that they) become ordinary citizens and taxpayers."

MAN TOLD TO REPAY SCHOOL FOR SON'S EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an action that state and Los Angeles education officials called highly 
unusual, a one-time Burbank school board candidate who has been battling school 
authorities over whether his son can legally attend a Burbank school has been 
ordered by a judge to reimburse the school district for educating the boy. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Thomas C. Murphy has ruled that S. Michael Stavropoulos, a 
neurosurgeon who ran unsuccessfully for the five-member school board earlier 
this year, lied when he said he lived in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy lifted a court order that allowed the boy, Michael Stavropoulos, 14, to 
attend John Muir Junior High School during the 1988-1889 school year while the 
matter was being heard in court. The district can refuse to enroll the boy when 
school resumes in September, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy also said Stavropoulos must reimburse the district for the cost of 
educating the youth during the last two school years. "There are expenses," he 
said. "It cost the district money to put this kid through school." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Present Statistics 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said that before the reimbursement amount is determined, the district 
must present statistics demonstrating the average cost of educating a student 
during the 1987-1988 and 1988-1989 school years. Officials also must show 
Murphy how many days the younger Stavropoulos actually attended school, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Those costs, authorities estimated, could be more than $5,500. 
</P>
<P>
The district, which receives money from the state for every child enrolled, may 
have to return the state funds it received for Michael Stavropoulos, school 
officials said. The average state payment for the 1987-1988 school year was 
about $14.44 a day. The payment for the 1988-1989 school year was about $15.54 
a day. 
</P>
<P>
Pat McGinnis, a state Department of Education spokeswoman, said the case was 
highly unusual "because these matters don't usually get to court." Either 
school administrators or school boards determine a student's residency, she 
said, and their decisions are rarely challenged. 
</P>
<P>
She said state legal authorities could not recall a similar case in California. 
</P>
<P>
Tammy Sims, a Los Angeles Unified School District spokeswoman, said such an 
issue has never come up in Los Angeles schools. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Youth Faces Expulsion 
</P>
<P>
The younger Stavropoulos also faces expulsion by school authorities after he 
fought with another student earlier this year, officials said. The school board 
is slated to decide whether to expel him on Aug. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Stavropoulos reacted angrily to the judge's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a resident of Burbank, I am a resident of Burbank, and I will continue 
to be a resident of Burbank," Stavropoulos said Wednesday. He called the school 
board members "corrupt, vengeful individuals." 
</P>
<P>
Stavropoulos has been locked in a bitter struggle with the Burbank school board 
since last October. The board ruled then that Stavropoulos was maintaining a 
phony residence so that his son could attend John Muir Junior High School. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Family's Pictures 
</P>
<P>
District officials visited the house in the 600 block of East Walnut Avenue 
where Stavropoulos said he lived. But they were not convinced he lived there 
because another family's pictures were in the home, said John J. Wagner, a 
school district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Filed Lawsuit 
</P>
<P>
Stavropoulos filed a lawsuit against the district and won a preliminary 
injunction to allow the boy to continue attending Muir while the case was heard 
in court. Murphy ordered the board to hear Stavropoulos' appeal of the board's 
October ruling. The board rejected Stavropoulos' appeal in February. 
</P>
<P>
Although his residency was in question, Stavropoulos ran for one of two open 
seats on the board this year. Burbank City Clerk Merle Woodburn said an 
investigation would have been conducted into Stavropoulos' residency had he 
won. 
</P>
<P>
Stavropoulos filed a second lawsuit accusing the board of capricious and 
arbitrary behavior. That suit is pending. 
</P>
<P>
Stavropoulos' son attended Muir during the 1987-1988 school year. In May, 1988, 
when he was involved in an altercation with another student, the boy told 
authorities he lived in Los Angeles, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
He was allowed to finish the school year but was told in the fall that he could 
not return because he did not live in Burbank.

NO CHARGES WILL BE FILED IN INGLEWOOD HIGH SCUFFLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rather than press criminal charges against the principal of Inglewood High 
School for a scuffle with the school's basketball coach last month, City Atty. 
Howard Rosten has called on the school district to discipline Principal 
Lawrence Freeman. 
</P>
<P>
Rosten said in a three-page report released Monday that he reserves the right 
to prosecute Freeman for his "unprofessional, undignified and reprehensible" 
conduct if "justice is not achieved" through the school system within the 
one-year statute of limitations. 
</P>
<P>
While he suggested that the school district could best resolve the situation, 
Rosten in an interview declined to recommend any specific disciplinary action. 
"Justice is one of those floating terms, but you know it when you see it," he 
said. "If they don't do anything at all -- pretend it's not an important event 
-- then I would say that's no justice." 
</P>
<P>
The conflict occurred June 6 when Freeman, known for his brash leadership 
style, reprimanded Coach Vincent Coombs in the principal's office for not 
following an order to purchase trophies for members of the basketball team. 
After Freeman ordered Coombs out of his office, the coach stood in the doorway 
as Freeman repeatedly pushed the door against him, according to witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. George McKenna ordered Freeman off campus a few hours after the incident 
and reinstated him several days later when the two men met and Freeman agreed 
to return to work. The incident marked the second clash between Freeman and 
McKenna in the school year that ended in June. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman's supporters, who credit him with keeping the high school free from 
gang activity and for establishing high expectations for students, argue that 
McKenna is attempting to purge the 67-year-old principal from the district. 
McKenna, who became superintendent in September, 1988, has denied that he is 
out to get Freeman. 
</P>
<P>
While Rosten's report criticized Coombs for lacking judgment when he did not 
leave Freeman's office after repeated demands by the principal, it focused 
blame on Freeman. 
</P>
<P>
"The conduct of the coach was not criminal," Rosten wrote. "Technically the 
conduct of the principal probably was." 
</P>
<P>
Rosten said a trial of Freeman for criminal battery could go either way. But he 
pointed out that such a case would include "the undesirable spectacle of high 
school students testifying in the trial of their principal." Several high 
school students were among those who witnessed the confrontation, Rosten said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Criminal Intent 
</P>
<P>
Rosten also said the school disciplinary process could "more fully and 
completely" address the incident, by assessing both men's work records and 
Coomb's refusal to reward his players or leave the principal's office. 
</P>
<P>
Rosten said he found that Freeman did not have a criminal intent during the 
incident, but was acting in a way he thought to be within the limits of his 
job. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no allegations of fact which indicate that the alleged crime was 
committed for personal gain, or for any of the classically 'criminal' reasons 
ordinarily condemned by society through the criminal law," Rosten wrote. "It 
appears that the events alleged occurred exclusively within the context of 
'school activities' and, whether in good judgment or not, were intended to be 
part of the discharge of the perceived duties of the principal." 
</P>
<P>
McKenna said his investigation into the incident is winding down and his 
recommendation to the school board will be made in about a week. The maximum 
sanctions could be suspension or demotion, McKenna said, declining to indicate 
whether Freeman actually faces such sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
If the board approves McKenna's recommendation, Freeman could ask the board to 
reconsider and if it does not, would have the opportunity to appeal the 
decision to the state Commission on Teacher Credentialing. A decision by the 
state panel could take six months, McKenna said. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman said in an interview this week that he wants to put the incident behind 
him and get on with running the high school. He said he plans to meet with 
McKenna and Coombs. They could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to dwell on it," Freeman said. "I'm just going to wait and see."

R.H. ESTATES WEIGHING TAX FOR OPEN SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rolling Hills Estates City Council will hold two public hearings to ask 
residents and business people if they would support a 5% utility users' tax. 
The money would go into a fund for purchase of undeveloped land that would be 
kept as open space. The idea, which came out of a council retreat and a study 
by a blue-ribbon committee, will be on council agendas Tuesday and July 25. 
City Manager Ray Taylor said such a tax would raise $125,000 for each 1% 
collected. 
</P>
<P>
The concept stems from controversy two years ago over the closed Dapplegray 
Intermediate School. Some residents criticized the council for not moving to 
acquire the site, which has a market value of $5 million, but the council said 
the city could not afford it. The Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School 
District, which had planned to sell the land for development, later took it off 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said the council at an April retreat discussed ways to handle the 
Dapplegray purchase if it comes up again. A committee of homeowner and civic 
leaders and city commissioners last week concluded that although the city has 
enough parks, it should acquire open land and leave it in its natural state. 
The committee said a 5% utility tax, lasting 5 or 10 years, should be put on 
the November ballot to provide money for land, if there is public support for 
it.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FREEWAY LANE TO BE CLOSED FOR BRIDGE WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At least one northbound lane of the Antelope Valley Freeway in Lancaster will 
be closed for the next month while state Department of Transportation workers 
repair a bridge hit by a truck that was too tall to pass under it. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, crews planned to close the northbound side of the freeway 
overnight between the Avenue F on-ramp and a point half a mile south of Avenue 
H to begin the project and put in new striping and traffic markers. 
</P>
<P>
Resident engineer Andrew Ponzi said Caltrans would try to keep at least one 
lane open at all times during work on the Avenue G overcrossing, which has been 
shut down since it was hit last year by a truck. 
</P>
<P>
But the repairs may require complete shutdowns of the northbound lanes and 
detours of traffic to Sierra Highway before the project is completed in early 
August, Ponzi said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SHERIFF'S TEAMS CALL OFF SEARCH FOR FISHERMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County Sheriff's rescue teams have abandoned their search for a 
fisherman presumed drowned when he reportedly fell into the California Aqueduct 
near Gorman early Tuesday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
California State Police who regularly patrol the aqueduct will continue to look 
for the man, described as being in his 60s, Sheriff's Sgt. Ron Boudreaux said. 
</P>
<P>
A fishing companion told deputies he heard a splash and saw the man floating 
downstream in the swift water, Boudreaux said. Sheriff's divers were unable to 
find the victim, and deputies called off their search at 4:30 p.m. Tuesday. 
Authorities are withholding the man's identify.

PAINFUL BACK CONDITION FAILS TO STOP 11-YEAR-OLD FORMER STATE CHAMPION GYMNAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Georgina Lillich was known as the "Lucky Dog" when she first showed up at 
Monarchs National Gymnastics Training Center in Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The nickname was somewhat of a misnomer. Because her flexibility was so poor 
she needed help from dance coach Laurie Williams in the stretching exercises -- 
assistance that had its price. 
</P>
<P>
"She stretches you, you get no mercy," Lillich said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, four years later, Lillich, 11, has put those dog days behind and is one of 
the top gymnasts on the club. But she can still be considered lucky: She 
competes despite a painful back condition; two siblings, whose physical 
activity is limited by health problems, are not as fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people can't do stuff, like people who are paralyzed," Lillich said. "I'm 
just glad I can do sports. I like to do flips off bars, and I like twisting on 
tumbling." 
</P>
<P>
In December, Lillich's gymnastics career took a tumble from which it looked 
like she might not recover. Lillich felt twinges and aches in her back. The 
pain eventually became unbearable. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was diagnosed as spondylolisthesis, a condition that involves a 
slipping disk. 
</P>
<P>
Two months of rest alleviated the problem, which may have existed for three to 
five years before the disk finally slipped. But Lillich still experiences 
periodic flare-ups. Occasionally she is forced to curtail her workouts or limit 
the maneuvers she performs. Frequently, she just fights through the pain. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always in the back of my mind," she said of the condition. "Sometimes it 
can get so painful you can't take it anymore. Sometimes it starts hurting 
really, really bad. Then after 10 minutes it goes away." 
</P>
<P>
A pain in the back can become a pain in the neck during the four- to five-hour 
workouts Lillich performs during the summer. Five days a week she travels from 
her Camarillo home to the Monarch facility to train with Coach Mike Bisk. 
</P>
<P>
All that summer work is geared toward the youth gymnastics season, which 
doesn't begin until March. Most seventh-graders would chafe at the deferred 
gratification derived from of working all summer for competitions months in the 
future. Not Lillich. 
</P>
<P>
"Meets make you a lot more nervous," she said. "You could have a bad day in the 
summer, and it wouldn't bother you. But before a meet, you'd be like, 'Oh, no.' 
I try not to, but I always get nervous. Sometimes I get so stringed up I can't 
sleep. I try to breathe. That's a good start." 
</P>
<P>
Lillich said that her favorite, and best, event is the uneven parallel bars 
because "usually in meets you have no time to shake on bars. On beam, your legs 
are on the (beam), your hands are free, it's shake time." 
</P>
<P>
She recorded an 8.9, a personal best, to win the uneven bars in the 1988 state 
meet in the Class III intermediate optional division. She also won the 
all-around in the 10-year-old age group in that meet and finished second among 
11-year-olds this year. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Lillich competed in the Judges Cup, a multistate competition held in 
Fountain Valley. She placed third in the all-around and helped her Southern 
California all-star team to the championship. 
</P>
<P>
"Georgina is a very good gymnast with a relatively good body type," Bisk said. 
"She's strong, she's quick, she doesn't have a great fear factor, and she's 
relatively flexible." 
</P>
<P>
Lillich's strength is, literally, her strength. She packs a lot of power into 
her 4-foot-8, 78-pound frame and spring-loaded arms -- arms she hopes 
eventually will vault her onto a college team or into the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
But that's projecting quite a way into the future. Lillich, a straight-A 
student at Las Colinas grade school, will worry about being a seventh-grader 
for now. 
</P>
<P>
"If I can't make it to college or can't make it to the Olympics, I won't be 
disappointed because I've tried my hardest," she said. "I know I can't set 
myself up to be put down." 
</P>

PENDING MARRIAGE OF COACH TO PITCHER WILL FURTHER BOND LONG-STANDING SOFTBALL 
TEAM FROM BURBANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MEYERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A summer sunset lights the San Gabriel Mountains, providing a romantic backdrop 
as J. R. Schwer spends an evening in Izay Park with his fiancee, Robin Smola, a 
former Miss Burbank. He watches her jog across a field, then admires her from 
afar. Somebody asks him to describe her at this moment. He thinks, rocks back 
in his snakeskin cowboy boots and says, "She's got a great arm." 
</P>
<P>
There's more than just love in the air at this park. Softballs are pinging off 
aluminum bats and one-line zingers are also being launched by the Delta Van 
Cruisers, a women's fast-pitch softball team in Burbank's top league. Schwer, 
coach of the team along with Mike Mirabel, is standing near the backstop, 
watching his bride-to-be whip 70 m. p. h. fastballs across the plate. 
</P>
<P>
"She throws harder than most men," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Schwer, 33, a former minor league outfielder, will marry Robin, 30, on Aug. 12 
in Burbank. The wedding will be attended by the other members of the Cruisers, 
but their presence is no mere gesture of team unity. The Cruisers have played 
in Burbank Park and Recreation Department leagues since 1978, but the nucleus 
of the team goes back to Ponytail League and even before. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a family," says Mirabel, who has coached Robin for nearly 20 years. 
"We've managed to stay together." 
</P>
<P>
The closeness of the team will be cemented even further at the wedding when 
Schwer officially becomes a member of the family. His sister-in-law will be 
Rene Smola, 28, who has always been Robin's catcher. His mother-in-law will be 
Pat Smola, who recently retired after playing with the Cruisers for nine years. 
Pat now serves as scorekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
Second baseman Lisa DiOrio also has been involved with the team since her early 
teens. Back then, the team was known as the Stephen's Electrons and played in 
the Ponytail League. After the girls turned 18, the Electrons became the 
Cruisers and were joined by Betty Harrison, a 5-foot-10 first baseman who was 
more than twice their age. Harrison, now 53 and a grandmother, still plays one 
night a week with the Cruisers and three or four nights a week with other 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
"They tell me they're going to bury me on the mound," Harrison says with a 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Stories about coaches who join forces with pee-wee league teams and then stick 
together aren't rare -- Bob Hawking and his Simi Valley High basketball team is 
another example -- but seldom has there been a relationship like the one 
between Mirabel and his players, particularly Robin and Rene. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike has been like a father to us," Rene says. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Mike almost became their stepfather, too. When Pat moved to Burbank 
from Minnesota 23 years ago, she was married, and the family used to go to 
Burbank parks on Sundays to watch fast-pitch softball. "One thing I wanted to 
do when we moved to California was get the kids involved in softball," Pat 
says. 
</P>
<P>
They'd see two games and go out to dinner in between. Even as youngsters the 
girls, Pat says, had no trouble sitting still at games. They were mesmerized. 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, Pat, by then divorced, started dating Mirabel. He decided to teach the 
youngsters to play softball. Knowing little about the sport, he attended the 
best games in the area and studied the best players. When it was apparent that 
the girls had talent, he sometimes worked with them until 3 a.m. in the back 
yard of their house. 
</P>
<P>
"Robin was 12 or 13 when I tried to get her on this good Ponytail team called 
the Dutch Girls," Mirabel recalls. She was a couple of years younger than the 
other girls and the team accepted her reluctantly. 
</P>
<P>
"But in her first game, she struck out 21 batters," Mirabel says. "Nobody could 
touch her. She had a natural drop ball." 
</P>
<P>
Robin and Rene -- "who can throw people out from her knees," Robin says -- were 
always two of the stars of the team, a battery with psychic connections. "She 
knows what I'm thinking on the mound and I know what she's thinking," Robin 
says. Their teams were always among the best in the league -- from Ponytail to 
high school (Robin played at Burroughs) to park and rec. 
</P>
<P>
"We had so many trophies we had to start throwing some of them away," Pat says. 
</P>
<P>
Mike's association with the team lasted longer than his relationship with Pat 
(They went together for seven years and are "still best of friends," Mike 
says.). Through the years, "I must have taught 500 or 600 girls to play 
softball," says Mirabel, who also paid most of the girls' fees. 
</P>
<P>
What kept him coaching? 
</P>
<P>
"It's something I just loved to do," he answers. 
</P>
<P>
The glory days for the Cruisers came during a five-year unbeaten streak in the 
Double-A League in the late '70s and early '80s. Robin, a league all-star and 
MVP, once pitched a doubleheader against a touring national championship team, 
Mirabel says, and won both games by 1-0 scores. 
</P>
<P>
Mirabel, a bus broker who lives in Downey with his wife and 2-year-old son, 
also became a fair pitcher himself. He was an apprentice of Rosie Black, the 
star of a barnstorming team known as "The Queen and Her Court." Black also 
worked with Robin and Rene. 
</P>
<P>
"I was one of the top pitchers in the B league," Mirabel says, "but I couldn't 
get any faster than that." 
</P>
<P>
Once Robin began dating Schwer, an assistant baseball coach at Newport Harbor 
High and a teacher at a juvenile hall in Garden Grove, it was inevitable that 
Schwer would begin helping Mirabel coach the Cruisers. Schwer was playing in a 
modified fast-pitch league at Balboa Park when a mutual friend figured that J. 
R. and Robin, both attractive and athletic, would hit it off, so he introduced 
them and told Schwer, "You should go out with her," J. R. recalls. 
</P>
<P>
Schwer, who has been assisting Mirabel for the past two years, runs practice 
with the precision of a drill sergeant. "Keep the bat at a 45-degree angle," he 
instructs shortstop Gwen Indermill as she works on her bunting technique. "Now 
pull the trigger." She taps the ball slowly down the third-base line. "That's 
the girl," Schwer says. "Head down and body down." 
</P>
<P>
During practice and games, the Cruisers, like most women's teams, have a 
cheerful rapport with their teammates as well as with opposing players. Even 
though games are competitive, there's no sense of the cutthroat play that marks 
men's games, Schwer observed. 
</P>
<P>
"Guys are always at each other's throats when they play," he says. "They're 
always ragging on someone. The women just have a good time. After the game, 
they go out and have fun. They don't rehash anything." 
</P>
<P>
But the once-dominant Cruisers appear to be slipping. They're playing only .500 
ball this season and haven't won a league title since 1982. "We peaked around 
1982 and '83," Pat Smola says. "We were the team to beat back then." Age is 
creeping up on them. And Robin and Rene have been playing a long time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been our 'last year' for the last five years," Rene says. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's always been 'one more season,' " Robin says, adding: "We hope we go 
on as long as Betty." 
</P>
<P>
If they do, there's a good chance they'll have to play without Mirabel, who's 
thinking of handing the reins to Schwer at the end of the season. The 45-minute 
drive from Downey to Burbank is getting to him, he says, and besides, he just 
bought a 25-foot cabin cruiser. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to go fishing," he says.

SMITH, STOKLOS SPIKE LOCAL HEROES' HOPES

<P>
The best story lines never happened at Tuesday's finals of the $75,000 
Manhattan Beach Open volleyball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Story No. 1: The King of the World beats the King of the Beach. Two-time 
Olympic gold medalist Karch Kiraly, after retiring from the U.S. national 
volleyball team with a weekend USA Cup victory over the Soviet Union, begins 
his full-time pro beach career by beating Sinjin Smith, the winningest beach 
player in history -- on the Fourth of July no less. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry. Smith and Randy Stoklos devastated Kiraly and Brent Frohoff, 15-5, to 
take the winners bracket title and earn a place in the tournament finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Story No. 2: Local heroes break Manhattan Beach Open victory record. Mike Dodd 
and Tim Hovland, who grew up in Manhattan Beach and Playa del Rey, 
respectively, capture "the Wimbledon of beach volleyball" for an unprecedented 
sixth time, making them the top team and top individual players in the 30-year 
history of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Nope. Not this time. Despite jumping off to a 12-7 lead in the finals, Dodd 
and Hovland were worn down by the tenacious defense of Smith and the vicious 
jump-serves of Stoklos -- as well as the sweltering heat and two exhausting 
matches against Kiraly-Frohoff -- and couldn't hold on. Smith and Stoklos won, 
15-13, beating Dodd-Hovland for the first time in the Manhattan Beach Open 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
OK, so let's talk about Smith and Stoklos, whose six tournament victories are 
the most on this year's tour; whose 10 wins and $134,185 each in prize money 
were the most on last year's tour, and whose 97 and 77 open championships are 
the most of all-time. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got the monkey off our back. We finally won this one," Stoklos said 
after his second Manhattan victory with Smith and third overall. It was the 
team's first victory over Dodd-Hovland in the finals. (Smith-Stoklos won 
Manhattan in 1986 when Dodd and Hovland were committed to another pro event in 
New Jersey.) 
</P>
<P>
Smith, however, denies a "monkey" ever existed, pointing out that the last time 
Dodd and Hovland won the event in 1987, Smith and Stoklos were playing in 
another pro tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know who created the hype, the belief that Dodd and Hovland own the 
Manhattan Open," said Smith, who has won the event four times, including once 
with Kiraly in 1980. "We've done very well there. Most of the games have been 
decided by two points, so you can't say they've dominated us." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Dodd and Hovland found a way to win in the past -- a fact of which 
Stoklos was well aware. 
</P>
<P>
"It was still going through my mind at 14-13," Stoklos said. "But when I got 
that ace, I said, 'There is a God.' " 
</P>
<P>
The ace -- a speeding jump-serve that got past Hovland and landed just inside 
the tape -- actually came at 13-12 and brought Smith-Stoklos to game-point, 
14-12. Hovland narrowed it to 14-13, ending a seven-point Smith-Stoklos run 
with a soft spike into the back court. But after nine consecutive sideouts, a 
Stoklos block was touched by both Hovland and Dodd before falling to the hot 
sand for the final point, giving Smith-Stoklos a 15-13 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The winners attributed their success to Smith's idea of continually 
jump-serving the tiring Dodd and Hovland. The jump-serve is an offensive 
weapon, Stoklos said, which puts the opponents immediately on the defensive by 
making them handle a serve that has the speed and trajectory of a spike. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Smith and Stoklos used the element of surprise by occasionally spiking on 
the pass rather than using the second hit to set the ball for a spike. The 
quick attack -- a Smith pass to the net that is spiked or softly tapped by 
Stoklos before the other team is in position -- is a Smith-Stoklos trademark 
that accounted for three straight points, carrying the winners from a 12-10 
deficit to a 13-12 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We always try to give them something different to think about," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite what he terms the "hype" of Dodd-Hovland's dominance of the Manhattan 
Beach Open and Kiraly's return to the beach game, Smith sees Tuesday's result 
as just another tournament victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Randy and I, I'm sure, feel the same way, that every tournament is important," 
he said. "How can we think this is more important than a $100,000 tournament 
somewhere else? But because we're playing in California and we're so close to 
our homes and it's (Dodd and Hovland's) home, it's nice to win." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, however, says there is no longer the feeling that Manhattan Beach 
belongs to Dodd, Hovland and the other players who train at the foot of Marine 
Avenue (known as "Marine Street") and Santa Monica is the home turf of Smith, 
Stoklos and the players who frequent nearby State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"There wasn't a real feeling that (the crowd) was more for them than for us," 
said Smith, who attributes the end of volleyball provincialism to the formation 
of a professional players association made up of players from all areas. "There 
were some outspoken people who I felt were for Hovland and Dodd, but I think I 
would have noticed if they were overwhelmingly for them." 
</P>
<P>
Hovland agreed that the Manhattan crowd wasn't all in the "Hovie-Dodd" corner, 
but he boldly proclaimed: "We still run the South Bay." 
</P>
<P>
"There's definitely a feeling (of protecting your home turf)," Hovland said. 
"There's a big feeling of camaraderie between the locals at Marine Street, the 
players at State Beach and the small contingent in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Losing to Kiraly-Frohoff in a hard-fought 15-10 match Tuesday morning was 
Dodd-Hovland's undoing, Hovland said. They then went to the losers bracket and 
had to beat Steve Obradovich and Craig Moothart (15-5) and Kiraly-Frohoff again 
(a 17-15 marathon in the consolation finals) to earn their championship shot 
against Smith-Stoklos. 
</P>
<P>
Kiraly -- believed by some to be the world's best beach volleyball player -- is 
already a force on the pro tour, having won three tournaments with Frohoff this 
season. But Smith downplayed the significance of his 15-5 rout of Kiraly in the 
winners bracket final. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, having Karch on the tour means one more great player out there for me 
to compete against," Smith said. "For the tour, it really helps out. It creates 
much more interest. Media-wise, it means we'll be taken more seriously."

IDENTICAL TWINS KEPT FROM A MATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike and Bob Bryan of Camarillo, identical twins ranked Nos. 2 and 3 in 
Southern California Tennis Assn. singles and No. 1 in doubles, teamed for the 
12-and-under title last week in the Junior Sectional Championships at Los 
Caballeros Racquet and Sports Club in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne and Kathy Bryan, the twins' parents, have taken steps to ensure that the 
relationship between the 10-year-olds is amicable. Challenge matches between 
the two are forbidden, for example. 
</P>
<P>
"Every kid who wants to play tennis wants to be the best at his club, his 
region, the world," said Wayne Bryan, tennis pro at Cabrillo Racquet Club. "You 
can't be No. 1 in the world if you're No. 2 at home. It's an immediate block by 
your own brother. We find plenty of people to play without them playing each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
So many competitors, in fact, that the boys have amassed more than 200 
trophies. 
</P>
<P>
Still, if it means facing each other, the Bryans will forgo a trophy. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, if the two were to meet in a tournament singles final, they would 
default on an alternating basis. Now, the two alternate between the 12 and 14 
divisions. 
</P>
<P>
It's strictly a case of brotherly love-love. 
</P>
<P>
Add juniors: Other local participants in the Los Caballeros tournament included 
Molly White of Camarillo, who advanced to the girls' 16-and-under singles 
quarterfinals before losing to top-seeded Courtney Rose of Beverly Hills. Gary 
Potter of Thousand Oaks made it to the fifth round of the boys' 16 singles. 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Pedroza of Ventura, who will attend Stanford in the fall, also advanced 
to the fifth round of boys' 16 singles. 
</P>
<P>
Kirstin Smith of Thousand Oaks, who will play at Pepperdine next season, and 
Laura Richards of Orange County reached the semifinals of the girls' 18 
doubles. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Giffin and Peter Morawiecki of Camarillo, both of whom advanced to the 
fourth round of the boys' 18 singles, reached the doubles quarterfinals. 
Camarillo's Steve Stukovsky made it to the quarterfinals of the boys' 18 
singles. 
</P>
<P>
Youth is served: After winning the boys' 10-and-under singles division of the 
Glendale Junior Public Parks tournament, Jonathan Wirjo of La Canada lost in 
the 12-and-under final. 
</P>
<P>
Wirjo has plenty of time to avenge the loss, however -- he's only 8. He began 
playing tennis at age 4. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen a child develop so rapidly," said Bob McKay, Wirjo's coach. 
"He doesn't quit. His forehand and serve have improved rapidly over the last 
six months. He has wonderful faculties." 
</P>
<P>
McKay adds that a practice session with Wirjo will occasionally attract an 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
"People just stand and watch him hit," McKay said of his 4-foot, 50-pound 
protege. "He's so tiny, it's like the ball is coming out of a cannon. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't even see him on the other side of the net." 
</P>
<P>
USTA doubles: A single-elimination men's 35-and-over doubles tournament 
sponsored by the U. S. Tennis Assn. will be held the week of July 17 at Warner 
Center Club in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Prize money will be offered and the tournament will help determine Southern 
California Tennis Assn. rankings. Cost is $26 a team. 
</P>
<P>
Information: 818-884-1100. 
</P>
<P>
Clinic: A USTA nonprofit tennis program for about 4,500 players aged 8 to 18 
begins July 10 at 98 locations around Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The six-week program provides participants with a T-shirt, 18-hours of 
instruction, a tennis racket, if needed, and a USTA membership. 
</P>
<P>
Registration is $10, but scholarships are available based on need.

BOYHOOD EXPERIENCES HOOKED MCLEAN FOR LIFE

<P>
It all started six decades ago for Don McLean. 
</P>
<P>
As a youngster McLean, who was raised in Long Beach, fished on the old Long 
Beach Pier at the foot of Pine Avenue. From that time on he knew he wanted to 
be a professional fisherman. 
</P>
<P>
As a teen-ager, the opportunities in the ocean-fishing industry were promising. 
His first job was as a deckhand on a commercial tuna boat. Traveling as far as 
Puerto Rico in the Caribbean, his seagoing voyages kept him away from home as 
many as 300 days a year. 
</P>
<P>
In 1950, after several years on commercial tuna boats, McLean decided that he 
would try party-boat fishing. He worked on charter boats to gain the experience 
needed to obtain an operator's license. 
</P>
<P>
In 1952, he was granted his first license and hired at Pierpoint Landing in 
Long Beach running half-day and all-day boats. 
</P>
<P>
The following year, first-time angler Harry Merick caught a 550-pound black sea 
bass -- still the largest fish caught on a boat skippered by McLean -- aboard 
the Islander out of Pierpoint. (It is currently illegal to keep black sea bass 
caught in California waters because they are an endangered species.) 
</P>
<P>
McLean also was at the helm of the 65-foot Freedom that made frequent runs to 
Catalina Island and albacore trips to San Clemente and San Nicolas islands. 
</P>
<P>
When Pierpoint closed he ran the Catalina boat out of the old Catalina Terminal 
at the foot of Avalon Boulevard in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, he purchased the Victory, a 75-foot sportfisher that was in the 
Pierpoint fleet and operated out of Queen's Wharf in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, he sold the Victory to George Xenio of Long Beach, who currently 
operates the vessel out of Long Beach Sportfishing. McLean says that many of 
the young captains operating sportfishing boats today are former deckhands that 
he and fellow veterans Cookie Cook, 72, and Russ Izor, 66, have trained to find 
fish. 
</P>
<P>
McLean, 68, said that he will run Long Beach sportfishing boats as a relief 
skipper rather than retire. 
</P>
<P>
"I would miss the excitement of fishing stories from my friends." 
</P>
<P>
Still biting: A shortage of anchovies over the Fourth of July weekend failed to 
slow the sand bass and barracuda action. Jigs and scampis were productive 
substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Perley of Torrance, fishing at Catalina Island aboard the Indian, caught 
the whopper of the week, a 32-pound halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Valley-area notes: Bass fishing is starting to heat up as Port Hueneme 
Sportfishing reported limits over the Fourth of July weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The San Fernando Saltwater Fishing Club chartered the Encore last week and all 
31 members caught calico bass limits. Bert Simons won the jackpot with an 
eight-pound specimen. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Hafner of Chatsworth, fishing at San Clemente Island aboard the Oceanside 
95, won the jackpot with a 34-pound white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Valencia of Burbank, fishing at Catalina aboard the Pacifica, caught a 
19-pound white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Tiefer of Studio City, fishing aboard the Redondo Special at Rocky Point, 
won the jackpot with a 19-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Palmquest of Van Nuys, fishing aboard the Chieftain near oil rigs, caught 
a limit of barracuda and won the jackpot with an 11-pounder. 
</P>
<P>
Fish reports: 
</P>
<P>
At Port Hueneme Sportfishing: The Ellie M anglers landed 200 calico bass. 
</P>
<P>
The Erna B caught a variety of bass -- 249 calicos and 21 sand bass. 
</P>
<P>
At Ciscos Sportfishing in Oxnard: Tropicana anglers caught eight sea bass that 
weighed 18 to 25 pounds.

PADRES TO MOVE BENES UP TO TRIPLE-A LAS VEGAS

<P>
Pitcher Andy Benes, the Padres' No. 1 pick in the 1988 June free-agent draft, 
took a big step toward the major leagues Wednesday when the club decided to 
promote him from double-A Wichita to their triple-A club in Las Vegas after he 
makes his next start Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Benes (8-4, 1.93 ERA) is fully recovered from the right shoulder tendinitis 
that plagued him recently, the Padres say, and is scheduled to make his first 
start for Las Vegas next Wednesday against the Edmonton Trappers in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Manager Jack McKeon, who has scheduled a workout for his team Wednesday 
morning, said he likely will fly to Las Vegas that afternoon to assess Benes' 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see the kid," McKeon said. "Who knows, he could be up here sooner 
than people think." 
</P>
<P>
Benes opened the season with a 7-1 record and 1.00 ERA for Wichita before 
developing stiffness in his shoulder. He lost two consecutive games and was 
placed on the 15-day disabled list on June 7. 
</P>
<P>
Benes won his first game back, yielding five hits and two runs in five innings. 
And after his most recent start, in which he gave up five hits in eight innings 
in a 2-1 loss, the Padres decided he was ready for triple A. 
</P>
<P>
Benes, 6-feet-6, 235 pounds, has allowed 68 hits and 28 runs (22 earned) in 102 
1/3 innings, striking out 109 with 37 walks. He opened the season by winning 
his first four games and seven of his first eight decisions. BOB NIGHTENGALE

<P>
It's a Sunday afternoon, and the pits are packed at the Amago Raceway on the La 
Jolla Indian Reservation north of Ramona. Mechanics are working feverishly to 
fine-tune their vehicles, and a couple of drivers argue over whether one got an 
unfair advantage when he didn't use a piece of required equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Lea Gale, 15, gets her final instructions and shoots out onto the track. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, Keith Johnson -- all 57 years of him -- pulls off the course 
after his qualifying run. 
</P>
<P>
Although the age, occupation and competitive desire vary, the wheels these 
drivers sit behind are the same -- they steer go-karts. Not the bumper cars 
that cost a couple of tickets at an amusement park; they can hit 50-60 miles 
per hour in the straightaways. 
</P>
<P>
"The sensation you get with your butt an inch off the ground is just awesome," 
said Johnson, a retired fireman from Denver. "I'm the old man in the group, but 
they don't cut me any slack." 
</P>
<P>
When the 120-member San Diego Kart Club gets together, machinery becomes the 
great equalizer. 
</P>
<P>
Spending time at the track was nothing new for Gale, a freshman at Granite 
Hills High School, and it seemed only natural she would end up driving. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since I can remember, I've gone to sprint car races," Gale said. "I 
always wanted to be a race car driver. I want to race everything." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was never into racing, either as a spectator or participant. He just 
happened to be winding his way up Highway 94 to Jamul when he ran into the 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to see these little kids racing out there, and they looked like they 
were having a ball," Johnson said. "One day, I pulled over and got out and 
watched. When they were finished they took off their helmets, and they had gray 
beards." 
</P>
<P>
Although go karts look like they'd be fun to take for a spin, some people take 
driving these 60-inch long, 145-pound vehicles seriously. Sometimes just a 
little too seriously for Doug Fleming, president of the San Diego Kart Club. 
</P>
<P>
"Three years ago there were no kids (in the club)," said Fleming, who operates 
a business that builds go-kart engines. "Everybody was getting so serious, they 
were forgetting what we were here for. Now we're getting more and more kids. 
It's really a cheap sport if you do it right." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Gale is one of those who does. Gale spent around $1,000 each on karts for 
his two daughters. Johnson, who bought his kart off the shelf, spent about 
$2,000. 
</P>
<P>
"For under a grand, you can get started," Gale said. "It doesn't really cost 
anything after the initial investment." 
</P>
<P>
Gale is like a lot of fathers in the San Diego Kart Club. He started out racing 
and then found himself spending less time on the track and more working on his 
kids' karts. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave up driving because of the kids," Gale said. "It's too much time." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Robinson agreed as he stood and flagged the youngest racers onto to the 
course. "You have to keep them running right," said Robinson, who has two sons 
that race. 
</P>
<P>
The minimum age to race is 8. The karts use a five-horsepower engine that is 
similar to that used for a lawn mower, and although kids can get into the 30-40 
m.p.h. range, this is considered the safest wheel racing sport in the world. 
</P>
<P>
At the recent Grandnationals at Laguna Seca, 684 drivers competed for five 
days, eight hours a day, and there were just three injuries -- two cracked ribs 
and a broken collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
Although Fleming knows that the future of the sport is in the young, there are 
serious drivers who have found that the sport can be a way to something else. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Meyers has spent most of his life around go-karts. He operates a business 
that builds karts and engines in Poway and on a recent day at his shop, he was 
on the phone answering questions from a buyer in Puerto Rico. He has also 
shipped his karts to Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Meyers won the go-kart grand nationals in 1967, which is how he got started 
building engines. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just a nobody, and then instantly everybody wanted me to build them 
engines," Meyers said. "You can't buy enough horsepower to make up for poor 
driving, so I'd teach them to drive, they'd win and then buy another engine." 
</P>
<P>
Meyers has been in Poway 12 years. Past and present Meyers clients include Al 
Unser Jr., Lance Mears (nephew of Rick and Roger Mears), Scott Pruett, who 
finished 10th in the 1989 Indianapolis 500 as a rookie and Indy driver Kevin 
Cogan. 
</P>
<P>
"I was talking to (professional racing driver) Frank Arciero recently, and he 
said he's been racing for 30 years, and now all the Indy guys are coming out of 
karting," Meyers said. "I had a customer come by and tell me that he called up 
one of these driving schools that teach people how to drive competitively, and 
the first thing they asked is if he had any karting experience. 
</P>
<P>
"You can wreck a lot of automobiles learning how to drive. It's a piece of cake 
for a go-kart driver to drive cars." 
</P>
<P>
Although Meyers has clients who are serious about becoming professional 
drivers, the majority of his customers are those who just want to race karts 
for the fun of it. 
</P>
<P>
And this is the clientele that Meyers is banking on. Literally. 
</P>
<P>
There are only three tracks where go-karts are being raced in San Diego County: 
Carlsbad Raceway, Kartsville in Jamul and the Amago Raceway. Carlsbad is a dirt 
track, which is not popular with a lot of drivers, and the raceway has been 
sold and may be developed. Kartsville is surrounded by a growing residential 
area of Jamul and runs right along Highway 94, which may be eventually expanded 
from two to four lanes. 
</P>
<P>
That, Meyers hopes, will leave Amago as the primary track for go-kart 
enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
The half-mile asphalt track with 12 turns is a year old. Meyers and John Amago, 
who owns the land on the La Jolla Reservation off of Highway 76, teamed up to 
build what amounts to a go-kart park. 
</P>
<P>
But the men's dreams have been slowed by fiscal reality. 
</P>
<P>
"So far we've used small loans I would guarantee myself," Meyers said. "We 
thought we could do it for $25,000. We've spent $100,000, and we don't even 
have a building." 
</P>
<P>
Although Meyers and Amago have the most important part -- the track -- they are 
hoping to break ground on kart storage units and a rental facility. Meyers 
figures more people would get into the sport if they could store their vehicles 
at the track instead of having to tow them. And there are no rental facilities 
in the county, so people must either use a friend's cart or buy one. 
</P>
<P>
Meyers also plans to eventually move his shop to the track and open a kart 
driving school. 
</P>
<P>
"I really believe this is what people need," Meyers said. "My intention is to 
help the tribe as we grow. It's a small mom-and-pop organization now. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always been my dream to have to have a place where people can go to race 
karts." 
</P>
<P>
Meyers may find that his dreams are not much different from those who zip 
around his kart track. 
</P>
<P>
"It's truly a Walter Mitty sport," Johnson said. "This is as close to those 
$250,000 cars most of us will ever get."

CREDIBILITY FOR MEXICO'S PRESIDENT; 
</P>
<P>
OPPOSITION'S WIN IN BAJA GIVES BOOST TO BOTH SIDES

<P>
There were two winners in the Baja California governor's election last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The first was Ernesto Ruffo Appel, the rightist National Action Party candidate 
whose victory at the polls means that he will serve as the first opposition 
state governor in the history of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The other was President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Salinas, whose own election 
was seriously questioned last year, earned immeasurable credibility by 
accepting the ruling party's unprecedented defeat. 
</P>
<P>
The Institutional Revolutionary Party, or the PRI, has been accused of stealing 
so many elections in its 60-year domination of Mexican politics -- the Mexicali 
mayoralty in 1983 and the Chihuahua governorship in 1986 are among the more 
recent examples -- that this time it may have gained more by losing a race than 
by winning. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't exactly something I am celebrating, but it is a step that we had to 
take," the PRI's national president, Luis Donaldo Colosio, said in an interview 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"This demonstrates the congruence between what President Salinas says and what 
he does through a democratic presidency. And it was a tough test that will 
serve us to reorganize the party to participate in real political 
competitions," Colosio said. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, Colosio made the bombshell announcement that the PRI expected 
to lose the Baja governor's race. Shortly afterwards, the party's candidate, 
Margarita Ortega Villa, conceded defeat on television. Official results are not 
due until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The PRI still has a fight on its hands to prove Colosio's assertion that it won 
the mayoral races in Tijuana, Mexicali and Tecate, along with 12 of 15 seats in 
the state's legislature. Officials from the National Action Party, known as 
PAN, claim to have proof that their candidates won Tijuana and 10 legislative 
seats. They charge that the PRI is illegally attempting to maintain veto power 
over the new governor. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd have our hands and legs tied," Tijuana PAN activist Arturo Moralesa said. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, leftist leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas is challenging the PRI's claim to 
have won 10 of 18 legislative seats in his home state of Michoacan. Cardenas 
insists that his Democratic Revolutionary Party won most, if not all, of the 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
Some Cardenas supporters believe the PRI recognized PAN's victory in order to 
defeat the Cardenas movement -- which broke away from the PRI and emerged with 
force in the 1988 presidential election -- and to win support from PAN for a 
moderate new electoral law that is to be debated in the National Congress next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Better Fraud Control 
</P>
<P>
Opposition members of all stripes insist that PAN's victory in Baja is due not 
so much to the PRI's new disposition toward democracy but to the opposition's 
growing ability to prevent fraud. In Baja California, PAN closely scrutinized 
voter registration lists before the election. The party had observers at 
virtually all of the polling places on election day to watch for cheating and 
to collect signed copies of the official results at each ballot box. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time the opposition has had the strength to defend an 
unquestionable victory," political analyst Federico Reyes Heroles said. "Fraud 
in Baja California would have been extremely difficult." 
</P>
<P>
However the victory was secured, few would question that it breaks important 
new ground in Mexican politics. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican political system has been highly centralized, with all lines of 
party, state and judicial power leading to the president. In the PRI system, 
the governors have been an extension of the president, much like the colonial 
viceroys of the Spanish king. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican presidents have offered a variety of excuses for holding onto that 
control. In the 1930s and 1940s, it was thought that the federation was weak 
and that regional movements could divide the country. In the 1960s, as the 
country developed its industrial base, it was feared that opposition states 
could become obstacles to the country's economic integration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Feared as 'Trojan Horse' 
</P>
<P>
By the 1980s, when the right-of-center PAN became strong, PAN's pro-Yankee 
rhetoric was seen as threatening to Mexico, particularly as the ruling party 
was losing its appeal with the country's eroding economy. PAN was feared as a 
"Trojan horse" from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But the political system was shaken last year when the leftist Cardenas won an 
unprecedented 31% of the presidential vote, and Salinas earned just over 50% -- 
the lowest ever for a PRI president. Opposition parties won nearly half of the 
Chamber of Deputies seats and their first seats in the Senate. Moreover, they 
insisted that the PRI had stolen the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Upon taking office, Salinas promised political reforms and democracy. His vow 
to respect the outcome of elections led this week to the election of Ruffo. 
</P>
<P>
Stunned PRI officials Wednesday were asking why Ruffo won. They had considered 
Ortega, 38, a good candidate with a clean record. She fought an aggressive and 
well-funded campaign backed by the president. 
</P>
<P>
When she was named as the PRI candidate, there was some speculation that a 
woman would have a hard time winning in a nation that has had only two woman 
governors. But the PRI, rather than Ortega's gender, seemed to be the deciding 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, PRI sources said, Ortega was not able to overcome the tremendous 
unpopularity of former Gov. Xicotencatl Leyva Mortera, who was widely viewed as 
corrupt. Salinas replaced Leyva Mortera soon after taking office, but the 
damage apparently had been done. 
</P>
<P>
Officials also blamed a badly divided party in Baja. Ortega suffered her 
greatest loss in Tijuana, where the party's backing for her was weakest. And, 
some admitted, the vote underscores a national distrust of the PRI and anger 
over the country's ailing economy. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the boost to Salinas' image, one official noted, "a defeat is still a 
defeat." 
</P>
<P>
Political scientist Lorenzo Meyer, however, argued that a defeat for the PRI is 
good for the country. 
</P>
<P>
"Those of us who have insisted that it is impossible to continue with a 
one-party monopoly are very happy. We cannot assume that the Mexican 
authoritarian system has ended, but this is the beginning of the end." 
</P>
<P>
And political analyst Reyes Heroles said Ruffo's six-year governorship 
represents "a new era of political cohabitation." 
</P>
<P>
In that respect, both sides have a lot to learn. Ruffo, 37, the former mayor of 
Ensenada, now must prove that PAN is not only an effective opposition party but 
a capable executive power. If Ruffo is faced with a PRI-dominated legislature 
and PRI city governments, he will have to show skill in negotiating to push 
forward his program. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not the same fighting from below as fighting from on top," Reyes Heroles 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The PRI, on the other hand, has never been in the opposition like this, and 
old-time party members are not expected to like it. Salinas may expect a 
backlash from his own party conservatives who believe he is giving up too much. 
</P>
<P>
When PAN won city halls in the past, the PRI's response was to try to strangle 
the local governments. Former Gov. Leyva Mortera reacted to Ruffo's mayoralty 
in Ensenada by cutting his budget. The move backfired when the populist 
politician mobilized the town to help him clean up city streets and became a 
hero as a result. It may have been what won Ruffo the governorship. 
</P>
<P>
Ruffo jokes that if the PRI federal government tries the same tactic, it is 
likely to catapult him into the presidency in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials say they plan to do no such thing. They acknowledge that to 
cut off aid to Baja California would be self-defeating. Baja has important 
tourism, import and export industries that earn badly needed dollars for 
Mexico. A deterioration of the state's infrastructure is likely to hurt those 
industries and, therefore, hurt the country. 
</P>
<P>
A border state, Baja is closely observed in the United States. A political 
crisis there reverberates far beyond Mexico's borders. 
</P>
<P>
"The federal government will act with political intelligence, and they (Ruffo's 
government) will be smart to have a good relationship with the federal 
government," said a government source. "They are going to have to learn to 
govern, and we are going to have to learn to live with them."

GOP SEEN AS HAVING MOST TO LOSE IN ABORTION 'WAR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The coming legislative war over abortion poses deep risks for both political 
parties but could be particularly costly to Republicans, according to 
politicians and political analysts. 
</P>
<P>
For Democrats, who generally have staked out an abortion rights stance, an 
increased focus on abortion could accelerate the flight of ethnic Catholics and 
conservative rural voters to the Republicans. That could further weaken the 
party in strongly anti-abortion states such as Pennsylvania, Missouri and many 
in the South. 
</P>
<P>
However, the GOP, which has benefited from the abortion issue in the past, now 
may have more to lose. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans "were always better off promising the sizzle and not delivering the 
steak" on the abortion issue, said Republican analyst Kevin Phillips. By 
promising to change the law on abortion, the GOP attracted anti-abortion 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
But delivering on that promise could drive a wedge into the coalition forged in 
1980 by Ronald Reagan, according to Phillips and William Schneider, a political 
analyst for The Times. The abortion issue could divide upscale, well-educated 
suburban voters who generally favor abortion rights from less well-off, 
less-educated, religiously motivated anti-abortion voters, they said. 
</P>
<P>
At the extreme, these analysts suggested, a national fight over abortion could 
split Republicans in much the same way that struggles over civil rights split 
the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
The outlines of the debate may soon begin to become apparent. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the first working day after the Supreme Court gave states new 
power to restrict abortions, Florida Gov. Bob Martinez called a special session 
of the Legislature. He wants to convene the session by the end of September and 
is meeting with legislative leaders to choose a date. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First of Many Struggles 
</P>
<P>
And Florida's battle, pitting a determinedly anti-abortion Republican governor 
against Democratic state legislative leaders who favor abortion rights, almost 
certainly will be only the first of many such confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
For both parties, the difficulty is that abortion cuts across traditional 
coalitions but leaves very little room for compromise. 
</P>
<P>
To date, both parties have staked out strong positions on the issue on the 
national level -- the Democrats pro- and the Republicans anti-abortion -- even 
though both parties have large groups of dissenters. For the dissenters, the 
issue has long been uncomfortable; but so long as the courts kept control of 
the issue, that discomfort was manageable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unendurable Discomfort 
</P>
<P>
Now, the chief political questions are likely to be how quickly that discomfort 
becomes unendurable and which side's dissenters fall away first. 
</P>
<P>
The worry for Republicans is that most of the Democrats likely to switch 
allegiances because of abortion may already have done so but the bulk of GOP 
desertions may be yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
Many Republicans accepted the party position on abortion even though they 
didn't agree with it "for the simple reason that they felt the Supreme Court 
would never let" that position be implemented, said GOP strategist Peter 
Teeley, a leading campaign adviser to President Bush during the 1988 election. 
"So they could focus on other issues. I'm not sure that applies any more." 
</P>
<P>
That could pose problems for GOP moderates such as Illinois Gov. James R. 
Thompson, who repeatedly has vetoed anti-abortion legislation. Thompson argued 
that the bills clashed with the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision, 
which made abortion legal, but he has refused to take a public stand on 
abortion itself. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as the governor weighs whether to seek an unprecedented fifth term, the 
Supreme Court has taken that political cover away from him. Wednesday, with 
riot police standing by, both sides rallied hundreds of demonstrators outside 
the state office complex in Chicago, calling on Thompson to take a stand. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hopes for Compromise 
</P>
<P>
The only stand he has taken so far is a statement Monday cautioning lawmakers 
not to move hastily and saying that he hopes for a compromise that would 
"balance liberties." 
</P>
<P>
But "balance" may be a hard position to sell to voters. "There's very little 
middle ground" on the abortion issue, GOP strategist John Buckley said. 
</P>
<P>
Similar difficulties could befall abortion rights Republicans in California, 
Democratic strategists hope. Sen. Pete Wilson, a candidate for governor, has 
succeeded so far in bridging the gap over abortion by persuading anti-abortion 
conservatives to support him on other issues. The more important abortion 
becomes as a voting issue, however, the more difficult that maneuver will 
become, said Democratic consultant Kam Kuwata. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-abortionists in California are in the odd situation of providing great 
sums of money to finance activist crusades across the nation while they lack a 
strong, identifiable political leader of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Once Republican Gov. George Deukmejian retires, anti-abortion activists looking 
for champions will be left with a grab bag of legislators who are unlikely 
allies -- such as Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti of Los Angeles, a 
liberal Democrat, and Sen. John Doolittle of Rocklin, a conservative 
Republican. In this case, Roberti is likely to be kept on a tight leash by 
other Democrats who strongly disagree with his Catholic religious view of 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anti-Abortion Democrats 
</P>
<P>
As for anti-abortion Democrats across the country, the party's national 
position "is something we always have to make apologies for," said Rep. Gerard 
A. Kosinski, an anti-abortion legislator in Pennsylvania, one of the most 
strongly anti-abortion states. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic legislators such as Kosinski have had many years to practice those 
apologies, but anti-abortion leaders now hope to raise the pressure. "If the 
Democrats are going to succeed, they are going to have to make room for the 
pro-lifers," said Brian Young of the American Life League. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, Democratic Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, saying the U.S. Supreme Court 
follows a "lower standard," Wednesday promised his continued support for 
Medicaid funding in New York to pay for poor women's abortions. Cuomo, a Roman 
Catholic, said that nothing in the court's Monday decision "changes my opinion 
about the right to abortion or the right of poor people to receive funding." 
</P>
<P>
The unknown variable in the abortion dispute is how rapidly each side will 
organize. So far, all agree, the anti-abortion side is far ahead. But the 
court's decision has provided the other side something to rally around, and 
abortion rights forces "are rabid, they are not going to be taken to the 
cleaners again," said Iowa Democratic leader Bonnie Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
The fight over abortion will hit American politics at a critical point. Both 
Democrats and Republicans have been planning to pour thousands of hours and 
millions of dollars into state-level elections this year and in 1990 as each 
party seeks to control the state legislatures, which will draw legislative and 
congressional district lines after the 1990 census. 
</P>
<P>
With the high court's decision, many of those state elections are likely to 
turn into referendums on abortion. With the combination of an intensely 
partisan election and a heated debate over the premier emotional issue of the 
day, Campbell said, "it's going to be a long, hot election cycle."

COUNCIL VOTES TO BAN WOOD SHINGLE ROOFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Wednesday tentatively banned new wood shingle roofs 
citywide, putting Los Angeles on target to become the first major city in the 
nation to outlaw the popular roofing material. 
</P>
<P>
The action came on a 12-1 vote, virtually ensuring passage when the measure 
comes up for final approval next week. 
</P>
<P>
The vote, bolstered by fire officials' warnings that even treated wood roofs 
can greatly increase fire losses, was a stunning blow to the wood shingle 
industry, which claims that the Los Angeles area provides at least 75% of its 
$50 million in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jobs Could Be Lost 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Cedar Shake and Shingle Bureau, a trade organization 
representing 250 manufacturers of the roofing products, said hundreds of 
workers -- primarily in the states of Washington and Oregon and the Western 
provinces of Canada -- could lose their jobs and multimillion dollar plants 
constructed to satisfy the demand of Los Angeles home builders for specially 
treated wood shingles could be closed. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Westfall, president of the trade organization, said his group will urge 
Mayor Tom Bradley to veto the measure, which he called "unwarranted and 
discriminatory." If that fails, he said, the group will sue. 
</P>
<P>
Westfall said he feared a "spirit of one-upmanships" would spread through 
California, causing other city and county governments to follow suit. San 
Clemente is currently the only city in California with a ban on wood roofs. 
</P>
<P>
The vote, the most dramatic in the 30 years of debate over the safety of wood 
roofs, was a showdown between the Fire Department and the industry. It came 
three days after a blaze in the unincorporated Puente Hills area. Of the 35 
buildings destroyed or damaged in the fire, Los Angeles County Fire Department 
officials said, 13 had wood shingles, 9 had composition roofing material, 9 had 
metal roofs, 4 had tile or slate. 
</P>
<P>
If the Los Angeles ordinance becomes law, wood shingle roofs would be banned in 
all new home construction. Wood materials would also be banned in roof 
replacements and repairs affecting more than 10% of the roof's area. Existing 
wood roofs would not otherwise be affected. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Department officials have long maintained that wood shake and shingle 
roofs -- even if treated with fire retardant material -- are extremely 
dangerous since they are prone to catch fire from falling sparks and to throw 
off embers. Los Angeles Fire Department Assistant Chief Davis Parsons said 931 
Los Angeles homes have been damaged or destroyed in fires that involved wood 
shingle roofs of all kinds since 1961 when the damaging Bel-Air fire awakened 
fire officials to the danger of wood roofs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Require Treatment 
</P>
<P>
The city has for several years required that wood roofs be treated with 
fire-retardant chemicals, but Councilman Hal Bernson had proposed that they be 
banned altogether in the city's so-called mountain fire zones. Two weeks ago, 
Councilman Marvin Braude, long a proponent of banning wood roofs, surprised the 
industry by amending Bernson's motion to include the entire city. 
</P>
<P>
The industry called on the Canadian Consulate to help in its lobbying effort, 
and the trade group hosted a special test in an effort to demonstrate for city 
officials how safe their materials are. 
</P>
<P>
Council members expressed sympathy for the plight of the industry and bemoaned 
the economic hardship the ordinance might cause, but the Fire Department was 
ultimately able to persuade the council that it knows what is best for Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Although wood shingle roofs have been popular in Los Angeles since their 
introduction in the 1950s (roughly 30% of all homes in Los Angeles have such 
roofs, industry officials estimate), the Fire Department has long blamed them 
for boosting the damage toll of periodic brush fires. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bel-Air Fire 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles first banned untreated wood shingle materials in high fire-risk 
areas in 1961 after the Bel-Air fire. In 1982, after the Mandeville Canyon 
fire, the city required use citywide of fire-retardant-treated cedar shingles. 
</P>
<P>
Those materials have a fairly good track record, with only one fire nationwide 
believed to have been spread by such materials. But city fire officials 
maintain that they still have not been properly tested. For the unincorporated 
areas, county supervisors are considering extending the requirement that wood 
roofs in hillside areas be treated with fire retardants. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ernani Bernardi, a former builder, cast the only "no" vote, calling 
the ban "unnecessary." But, he said, it "scares the life out of you" to see how 
many homes have wooden roofs.

FOR THE RECORD

<P>
Because of an editing error, a story in Thursday's editions about the City 
Council's tentative ban on new wood roofs incorrectly attributed a comment to 
the ban's only opponent, Councilman Ernani Bernardi. The remark, that it 
"scares the life out of you" to see how many homes have wood roofs, actually 
was made by Councilman Marvin Braude, who proposed the ban.

In contrast to millions of Americans who moved to California in search of new 
lives, Martin Delaney came here from Chicago in 1980 contemplating death. 
</P>
<P>
Chronic hepatitis was eating away at his liver, and doctors advised him the 
prognosis was grim. 
</P>
<P>
Then hope appeared in the form of an experimental drug program at Stanford 
University. Delaney signed up and underwent six months of arduous treatments. 
The medication halted the destruction of his liver but at the cost of a severe 
side effect: a permanent condition called neuropathy that causes sharp, burning 
pain in his feet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drugs Not Marketed 
</P>
<P>
The trial was shut down in 1982 and the two drugs Delaney took were never 
marketed. Five members of Delaney's support group for chronic hepatitis 
sufferers who came down with the disease after the trials had ended have since 
died. 
</P>
<P>
"None of them was allowed to choose, as I was, between an early death and 
living a useful life with sore feet," said Delaney, who must take methadone 
daily to control the pain. "The decision should have been theirs, not some 
pinhead bureaucrat's in Washington." 
</P>
<P>
The experience propelled Delaney, a 43-year-old advocate of AIDS patients, to 
take action. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, he put his successful consulting business on hold and co-founded 
Project Inform. The group's chief goals are to gather information about -- and 
speed access to -- promising treatments for AIDS "without being victimized by 
profiteers or the endless delays of bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, Delaney put his philosophy to work by recruiting patients and 
doctors for the underground trial of a touted Chinese drug called Compound Q. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Works in Two Worlds 
</P>
<P>
Delaney represents a new breed of AIDS activist who battles the epidemic by 
straddling two often-incompatible worlds. In one of them, he acts as "the field 
general" of a growing AIDS underground treatment movement, said nurse Jim Corti 
of Los Angeles, who brought thousands of doses of Compound Q out of China at 
Delaney's direction. In the other, Delaney travels comfortably through official 
Washington, maintaining good relationships with -- and constantly prodding -- 
key officials of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and National Institutes 
of Health. 
</P>
<P>
Some fret that those relationships may be sorely tested as a result of the 
unsanctioned Compound Q trial, which was designed to test the drug's safety and 
efficacy more quickly than an FDA-approved trial of a similar drug at San 
Francisco General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the FDA, which insists that it already is expediting AIDS drugs, 
announced a probe of the Compound Q study after one patient died, possibly from 
side effects of the drug, a second committed suicide and a handful suffered 
serious complications. Many of the other patients have shown improvements, 
although Delaney said it still is too early to draw conclusions about the drug. 
</P>
<P>
The heart of Delaney's argument is that patients with AIDS and other 
life-threatening illnesses should be permitted to assume greater risks in 
trying unproven therapies. "Society must rethink the risk-benefit ratio when 
the patient has so much to lose by doing nothing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A former Jesuit seminarian who is gay, Delaney defends his activities against 
AIDS in fiercely moral terms. "This is our holocaust," he said. "We only have 
one chance to live through it with dignity and a clear conscience that we did 
all we could." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Into the Establishment 
</P>
<P>
While other AIDS activists take to the streets, Delaney has used guile, 
persistence and sheer intellect to insinuate himself into the highest levels of 
the federal research and drug regulatory establishment. 
</P>
<P>
He confers frequently with FDA Commissioner Dr. Frank Young and National 
Institutes of Health AIDS research chief Dr. Anthony Fauci, lobbies for greater 
access to experimental medicines in such prestigious forums as the Journal of 
Infectious Diseases and sits on the National Academy of Sciences Institute of 
Medicine's Roundtable for the Development of Drugs and Vaccines Against AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"He makes the case for patients in an intelligent, articulate and 
non-hysterical way," said Fauci, who serves with Delaney on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
In doing so, Delaney has become part of an informal brain trust of AIDS 
activists that is changing the face of research into AIDS and other 
life-threatening illnesses. Other members include ACT UP's Mark Harrington and 
Jim Eigo, attorney Jay C. Lipner and a small number of congressional staff 
members and federal agency officials. Together, they are slowly pushing the 
federal drug approval process and presenting an unprecedented challenge to the 
traditional medical establishment. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, for example, the FDA announced the early release of a pair of 
drugs to prevent AIDS-related blindness and anemia and Fauci unveiled a new way 
of testing drugs that could increase access to experimental compounds. Beyond 
AIDS, the National Cancer Institute said it would make the drug levamisole 
available for colon cancer before results of clinical trials are published. 
</P>
<P>
By speeding the release of AIDS treatments, the activists have raised hopes 
that the disease will some day become a chronic but manageable illness, like 
diabetes, rather than a death sentence. Still, some advocates of regulatory 
reform worry that Delaney's audacious compound Q experiment went too far and 
could spark a backlash. 
</P>
<P>
Delaney responds that the only difference between the Compound Q experiment and 
the many instances of patients gulping other unapproved drugs in the past "is 
the professionalism and scientific integrity" of the Compound Q experiment. 
"This event and the threat of future ones like it will be a powerful lever for 
reform-minded bureaucrats." 
</P>
<P>
The Compound Q trial has also reignited the long-simmering debate over 
desperately ill patients' access to experimental therapies and has led to deep 
soul-searching by medical ethicists and others. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists performing FDA-sanctioned experiments on the official version of the 
drug, known as GLQ-223, criticized Delaney's renegade research, and medical 
ethicists and some doctors scored Delaney for moving ahead without studying the 
drug's toxicity in humans. 
</P>
<P>
"I have grave concerns when he starts playing doctor and superseding the 
responsibilities of the FDA," said Dr. Shelley M. Gordon of San Francisco. One 
of Gordon's patients was injected with Compound Q in the underground trial by 
another doctor and had to be hospitalized with neurological problems. Gordon 
suspects the drug. 
</P>
<P>
Others applauded Delaney's action. "He is a hero," declared Larry Kramer, a New 
York playwright and AIDS activist. "Talk does not save lives, but action 
might," added Hank Wilson, a San Francisco hotel manager who has AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Delaney said the debate is long overdue. "These were terminally ill patients 
who had exhausted all other options," he said. "The problem with the ethicists 
in their ivory towers is that none of them is personally threatened by this 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
"The voices I hear in my heart, the people I answer to, are the people with 
AIDS and the people with this virus." 
</P>
<P>
One such voice belongs to Robert Pitman, a 48-year-old San Francisco playwright 
with AIDS. Pitman just completed a three-week course of infusions with Compound 
Q in the Project Inform trial. 
</P>
<P>
"I could care less about the FDA investigation, or what the ethicists say," 
said Pitman. "I went into this fully aware that death was a possible side 
effect. I faced my fear of death a long time ago, and I decided that I wasn't 
just going to fold up my tent." 
</P>
<P>
Pitman said his energy level has increased considerably since the treatments 
and his lab tests are encouraging. "If Q doesn't work and something else that 
is promising comes along, I'll try it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Project Inform study, which is being conducted by a team of nine doctors, 
has now enlisted 60 volunteer AIDS patients in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New 
York and Miami. Physicians conducting the study strongly warn AIDS patients 
against trying to self-administer the drug. 
</P>
<P>
Even with those warnings, National Institutes of Health AIDS research chief 
Fauci argued Project Inform's underground trial of Compound Q is "a serious 
mistake" because of the precedent it sets. "What if the next time somebody less 
knowledgeable and altruistic than Marty -- or even a fraud artist -- comes 
along and tries something like this? You could have a real disaster on your 
hands." 
</P>
<P>
But Delaney claims the AIDS underground treatment movement has grown so 
sophisticated that it can distinguish between valid hope and wishful thinking. 
Besides, he added, it was only a matter of time before Compound Q, a form of 
trichosanthin refined from the root tuber of a Chinese cucumber, found its way 
into this country. 
</P>
<P>
"The same thing happened with ribavirin from Mexico and dextran sulfate from 
Japan," he noted. (Both drugs have proven ineffectual in the oral versions 
available through the underground, although research is continuing on 
intravenous dextran sulfate.) 
</P>
<P>
"If the community is going to go out and use it, we felt it was far better to 
take some risks with a small group of willing people, and to get answers as 
quickly as possible," Delaney said. 
</P>
<P>
"The system never counts the tens of thousands of patients who are hurt by 
delays in drug development. There must be accountability on both sides of the 
ledger." 
</P>
<P>
Critics argue that even if Project Inform's Compound Q experiment is being 
conducted in strict adherence to scientific principles, Delaney has too much 
personal involvement for the research to be objective. 
</P>
<P>
"A scientist is trained to construct a study so that his personal biases do not 
get in the way," said Gordon, the San Francisco doctor whose patient suffered 
neurological complications. 
</P>
<P>
When Gordon wrote in the patient's chart that he had been administered a 
"relatively impure" version of GLQ-223, Delaney wrote a letter to the head of 
her medical center demanding a correction. 
</P>
<P>
Delaney noted in his letter that the drug had been "tested to be better than 
99% pure by the most knowledgeable protein chemistry laboratory in the United 
States." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon replied by letter that "even trivial contaminants" can cause 
"irreparable damage . . . as a physician I am obligated to consider all 
possible causes of my patients' illnesses." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, she added: "I was appalled that Martin Delaney was reading my 
patient's chart and asking me to forgo my objectivity." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Donald Abrams, deputy director of AIDS activities at San Francisco General 
Hospital, said he fears that "self-educated medical scientists like Martin 
Delaney may shatter the confidence many people have in their physicians." 
</P>
<P>
"It is all well and good for people who are not trained to try to pick up the 
science," Abrams continued. "But it is important to realize that there is an 
art to medicine which is much more difficult to acquire." 
</P>
<P>
Delaney acknowledges that he has no formal scientific training. "I learned AIDS 
and the science of AIDS about the same time as everybody else did, including 
the doctors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"As a child and into high school days, I was pursuing a scientific career, but 
as the son of a good Catholic family I was shuffled off to the Jesuits to 
become a priest instead." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Higher Truths' 
</P>
<P>
Delaney left the seminary shortly before his ordination, but friends and 
business associates say the training left its mark. "He is willing to give of 
himself to the point of martyrdom," said Lois Pryor, who worries about 
Delaney's health. As a result of the hepatitis, his liver retains only 10% of 
its function. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, this is a man who believes in higher truths," she added. 
</P>
<P>
"If he feels something is wrong, he will pursue it tenaciously," added Ronna 
Jacobsen, a former girlfriend who taught elementary school with Delaney in a 
Chicago suburb after he left the seminary. 
</P>
<P>
Delaney faults the old system of medicine in which "the physician is a god-like 
figure with healing powers," he said. "Healing occurs out of a collaborative 
process between patient and physician. That is especially critical in a 
life-threatening illness." 
</P>
<P>
To help AIDS and HIV patients to make informed decisions about their health, 
Project Inform operates six toll-free hot lines and publishes a newsletter that 
it sends, free, to anyone requesting it. The nonprofit organization has two 
full-time employees, two part-time employees and 60 volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
Project Inform's basic message -- that people who are at risk for HIV should 
find out whether they are infected and seek treatment before the virus causes 
AIDS -- stirred controversy when it was first issued in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors frequently were reluctant to initiate treatment before patients became 
sick, preferring "the old wait and see," as Delaney puts it. And some AIDS 
organizations vacillated on HIV testing because they worried about possible 
discrimination and the psychological impact of a positive test result. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Project Inform's message was vindicated when the U.S. Public Health 
Service issued guidelines urging HIV testing and early treatment with such 
drugs as AZT and aerosolized pentamidine to prevent the often-fatal 
pneumocystis carinii pneumonia that kills most people with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, anyone who suggests that testing is a neutral question is 
inviting people to walk blindly into an AIDS diagnosis when the medical reality 
is that we can prevent or delay it," Delaney said. 
</P>
<P>
Now that his once radical message on the early treatment of HIV infection has 
been accepted by the mainstream, Delaney said he feels an obligation "to push 
the system further." 
</P>
<P>
"The challenge of AIDS was, is and for the near future will remain to act in 
the face of uncertainty, and not to be immobilized by denial or imperfect 
solutions," he added.

ARSON INVESTIGATORS PAINSTAKINGLY COMB FIRE AREA

<P>
Walt Scheuerell was down on his hands and knees in the ditch beside Turnbull 
Canyon Road, pawing through the loose dirt. It was hot and it was dusty, and 
the sweat was trickling down his face. 
</P>
<P>
"We still haven't found anything," the burly, 49-year-old arson investigator 
said. "We'll keep looking." 
</P>
<P>
Scheuerell, a sergeant with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department; his 
partner, Detective Barney Villa, 39, and Bill Franklin, 50, an investigator 
with the county Fire Department, spent most of Wednesday afternoon combing 
about half an acre of charred brush on a sunbaked, roadside slope half a mile 
east of the Whittier city limit. 
</P>
<P>
Their challenge is to determine -- if they can -- what started the brush fire 
that blackened 1,500 acres, destroyed 13 homes and burned portions of eight 
more in the Puente Hills on Monday, causing damage estimated at more than $4.3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"From what the witnesses say, from what we see and from what we know about the 
way the wind blew, this area right here is the point of origin," Scheuerell 
said, pointing to the blackened hillside that marks the southwest quadrant of 
the burned area. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're looking for now is the exact point where it started," he said. "If 
we find that, I think we can find the cause." 
</P>
<P>
Scheuerell explained that what he was looking for was "what's left over" after 
a fire starts -- things like fireworks fragments, match stubs, cigarette ashes 
or the sort of residue left by burning gasoline and other flammable liquids. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't found any of those things," he said. "We haven't eliminated any of 
those things either." 
</P>
<P>
Scheuerell said he could probably rule out lightning -- "check the weather that 
day." He said he could also rule out downed power lines -- "we haven't found 
evidence of any." 
</P>
<P>
But he was not yet willing to confirm fire officials' earlier assessment that 
the fire was man-caused. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Don't Know' 
</P>
<P>
"What I can say is that it was a suspicious fire," he said. "That means we 
don't know yet what caused it." 
</P>
<P>
The Puente Hills fire was just an ugly memory Wednesday, but three other 
wildfires burned throughout the afternoon and into the night in Riverside 
County, county fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The largest of the three -- near Interstate 15 in the Temescal Canyon area 
south of Corona -- was moving south toward the town of Alberhill after charring 
more than 1,300 acres of brush. No evacuations were ordered, but residents in 
the path of the blaze were told to be prepared to move if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Another fire broke out in the early afternoon near the 1984 Olympic Games 
shooting venue in the Prado Dam area. Fanned by onshore winds, the flames 
spread rapidly southeastward into the Prado Recreation Area northwest of 
Corona, blackening about 750 acres of grasslands, brush and timber but posing 
no immediate threat to homes. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was contained by 5 p.m., with full control expected early today, 
county fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The third blaze, in the Box Springs area above Moreno Valley, about 10 miles 
east of Riverside, had charred about 1,200 acres of brush by nightfall, 
authorities said. No structures were threatened. 
</P>
<P>
While more than 800 firefighters battled the three blazes in Riverside County 
on Wednesday afternoon, the only official vehicle still parked in the Puente 
Hills burn area was the pickup truck that had carried the three arson 
investigators to the area where they think Monday's fire started. 
</P>
<P>
Scheuerell, Villa and Franklin were working their way slowly up the slope, 
about 10 yards above the roadway, when a motorist stopped to offer some 
information. 
</P>
<P>
The informant -- a local resident -- said he had seen a "suspicious" van in the 
area several times before the fire. The officers took down the information, 
which would be added later to a growing file of evidence and witness accounts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lead," Scheuerell said. "How workable, we don't know yet." 
</P>
<P>
The man drove off, and Scheuerell, Villa and Franklin resumed their painstaking 
chore. 
</P>
<P>
"The cause of this fire may never be determined positively," Scheuerell said. 
". . . But right now, we'll keep looking."

CUOMO SIGNS TOUGH BAN ON PUBLIC SMOKING

New York residents and visitors will be barred from smoking in grocery stores, 
on buses and in many other public places under legislation signed Wednesday by 
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who called the new law one of the toughest of its kind in 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The statute, which takes effect in six months and makes New York the 37th state 
with a public smoking ban, also requires no-smoking areas in workplaces, 
restaurants, bingo halls and bowling areas. It passed the Legislature after a 
13-year struggle over protecting nonsmokers from second-hand tobacco fumes. 
</P>
<P>
Cuomo, a former smoker who said he once smoked three packs a day, said the law 
is aimed at preventing deaths, not hurting smokers. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to ostracize smokers. We want to embrace them," the governor 
said. "We want to help them to quit." 
</P>
<P>
Cuomo cited studies showing that a third of all male deaths in New York were 
smoking-related, and that up to 91% of all nonsmokers had nicotine derivatives 
in their systems. About 27% of New Yorkers smoke, according to the state 
Coalition on Smoking or Health. 
</P>
<P>
The new law bans smoking in auditoriums, theaters, elevators, classrooms, food 
stores and buses and subways, although bar patrons still could light up. It 
also prohibits smoking in public areas of schools, hospitals, public buildings, 
banks and other indoor public spaces. 
</P>
<P>
Cuomo said the restrictions amounted to "one of the toughest smoking laws in 
the nation."

33 SOVIET SAILORS INJURED IN PERU BUS BOMBING

<TEXT>
<P>
Suspected leftist guerrillas Wednesday bombed a bus carrying sailors from a 
Soviet fishing fleet on shore leave, injuring 33 of them, the Interior Ministry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The bomb exploded as 49 sailors were boarding the bus after leaving a 
handicrafts store in the port of Callao, five miles west of Lima, according to 
police and witnesses. Four were still hospitalized 12 hours after the blast, 
the Interior Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
No group claimed responsibility for the bombing, but the Interior Ministry 
statement said that the attack had the characteristics of an operation by the 
Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path), a Maoist guerrilla group that has targeted 
Soviet diplomats and citizens in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Oswaldo Diaz Salvador, the police chief of Lima, said two young men were 
seen placing an object under the bus and then racing off as the bomb exploded. 
He said police are seeking four people; there were reports that two accomplices 
sped off in a car after the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
Two smaller buses, each carrying about 35 Soviet sailors, were damaged by the 
mid-morning explosion, police said. 
</P>
<P>
However, all of the injured were on the larger bus. 
</P>
<P>
The blast also damaged the three-story building where the fishermen had been 
shopping at a store that caters exclusively to Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
Sendero Luminoso, which follows the ideology of Mao Tse-tung, views the Soviet 
government as a traitor to Marxist theory. It also regards the Soviets as 
enemies because they have long been a major supplier of arms to Peru. 
</P>
<P>
Peru recently acquired Soviet-made helicopters, and officials said some of them 
will be used to battle the guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
An agreement between Peru and the Soviet Union allows 20 Soviet trawlers to 
fish in Peruvian waters in exchange for a percentage of the catch. The fleet 
uses the port of Callao as a resupply point. 
</P>
<P>
When their vessels are in port, the fishermen often take shopping trips, and a 
number of stores have opened that cater exclusively to Russian-speaking 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
On June 3, Sendero Luminoso guerrillas blew up a bus carrying palace guards to 
a ceremony in downtown Lima, killing six people. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, a Sendero Luminoso guerrilla was killed after breaking into the 
grounds of the Soviet Embassy when the bomb he was carrying exploded. Also in 
1986, several Soviet fishermen were injured when a bomb went off in a store in 
Callao. 
</P>
<P>
The group has been fighting to topple Peru's elected government since 1980.

<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, determined to demonstrate American 
interest in Asia, arrived Wednesday in this tiny but oil-rich nation where his 
predecessor, George P. Shultz, obtained an ill-fated $10-million contribution 
for the Nicaraguan Contras three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Baker came to this steamy capital for meetings that start today with the 
foreign ministers of the Assn. of Southeast Asian Nations, a 22-year-old 
organization that includes Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, 
Singapore and Thailand. He wants to discuss such issues as China, Cambodia and 
a proposal for a new organization to foster economic cooperation among the 
nations of the Pacific Rim. 
</P>
<P>
But the serious diplomatic objectives seem to be lost in this vest-pocket 
sultanate where the 215,000 citizens enjoy the world's highest per capita 
income -- about $15,000 a year -- and where the ruler lives in a 1,700-room 
palace that looks a little bit like a luxury hotel might if the decorator was 
given an unlimited budget. 
</P>
<P>
It was in that palace that Shultz, the last secretary of state to stop here, 
obtained Sultan Muda Hassanal Bolkiah's commitment for the $10-million donation 
to the Contras. However, the sultan was given the wrong Swiss bank account 
number, and the money never reached the insurgents fighting Nicaragua's 
Sandinista government. It was discovered later to have been deposited to the 
account of a Swiss businessman who eventually returned it to the sultan. 
</P>
<P>
Baker assured reporters he would perform no similar errand this time. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Administration official who accompanied Baker on the flight from Tokyo 
to Brunei said the secretary of state reached agreement with Japanese Prime 
Minister Sosuke Uno that no new sanctions on China are warranted but that the 
existing ones should be kept in place until the Beijing government ends its 
crackdown on dissent. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said Baker and Uno stressed "the importance of not taking action 
that would isolate the Chinese people but at the same time taking action that 
would show our outrage" over the brutal suppression of the pro-democracy 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
Baker will seek a similar agreement with the ASEAN foreign ministers. 
</P>
<P>
The senior official said Baker was unwilling to speculate about conditions that 
would prompt Washington to lift the sanctions that President Bush imposed after 
the Beijing massacre of June 3-4. But he made it clear that no change in policy 
is likely any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
The President first suspended arms sales to China and military contacts. Then 
he also suspended high-level diplomatic contacts and said he would work to 
persuade international lending bodies such as the World Bank not to grant new 
loans to China. 
</P>
<P>
Uno told Baker that Japan also has no plans to resume the economic programs 
that it interrupted after the crackdown, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are taking a wait-and-see attitude," the official added. "That might not 
be too bad a formulation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Avoiding Interference 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, it appears significant that diplomats are now talking about when 
the pressure on China might be eased. So far, they have concluded: not yet. In 
contrast, Congress is debating measures that would impose additional sanctions 
despite opposition from the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Although the ASEAN nations have generally expressed shock over recent events in 
China, they have avoided taking any sort of action that China might interpret 
as interference in Chinese internal affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally the custom of ASEAN is not to comment on the internal affairs of 
other countries because we don't want others to interfere in our affairs," 
Tommy T. B. Koh, Singapore's ambassador to the United States, said recently. To 
which Malaysia's ambassador, Albert S. Talalla, added, "Especially not China." 
</P>
<P>
China is expected to intrude into Baker's discussion with the ASEAN ministers 
about proposals for a Pacific Rim organization to coordinate economic matters, 
much as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has done for 
years in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said in a speech last month that such an organization is "an idea whose 
time has come." But he carefully avoided spelling out details of how the plan 
should work, saying instead that the nations of the Pacific region should try 
to reach a consensus. 
</P>
<P>
The official traveling with Baker said that a key unanswered question is, "What 
do we do now with China?" 
</P>
<P>
He said it would be extremely difficult to include China in the organization 
after the events of last month in Beijing. He said that including China would 
have been troublesome even without the suppression of the pro-democracy 
movement because China's economy is not a good match for the prosperous, 
capitalistic economies in the rest of the region. But some nations believe that 
the proposed organization should include every state in the area. 
</P>
<P>
ASEAN nations are known to be cool to the plan because they fear that it might 
dilute the influence of their existing organization. One ASEAN official said 
the annual meeting between the ASEAN foreign ministers and the foreign 
ministers of the United States and five other industrialized nations already 
provides enough economic coordination for the Pacific area.

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Wednesday that he had been baptized 
as a boy and considers that "quite normal." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, 58, who has said before that his mother is a devout Christian, a 
member of the Russian Orthodox Church, was asked at a press conference here 
whether he, as a result, had been christened. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I was baptized," he replied. "I was christened, and I think this is quite 
normal." He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Raisa, said later that she, too, had been christened. 
</P>
<P>
"We were born in the 1930s," she said, "and baptism was normal in our families 
at that time." 
</P>
<P>
But their own children, a son and a daughter who are now in their mid-30s, were 
not christened, the Soviet First Lady added. 
</P>
<P>
"They belong to a different era . . . ," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Raisa Gorbachev, a former instructor of Marxist-Leninist theory, has said 
before that she is a firm atheist but that she respects religious beliefs.

THE SENTENCING OF OLIVER L. NORTH;

<P>
Here is the text of the statement Wednesday by U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. 
Gesell when he sentenced Oliver L. North: 
</P>
<P>
As I explain my sentence to you now I think you will see that -- I hope you'll 
see that I am taking into account many of the matters that your lawyer and you 
have brought to my attention today. I hope you will also see that perhaps I 
place a greater value because of the nature of my job upon some aspects of the 
situation that brings you here than you yet have had an opportunity in the 
midst of all this turmoil to fully appreciate. 
</P>
<P>
I can assure you, Col. North, that I'm going to take into full consideration 
the important fact that before you came to the White House you had served your 
country with distinction in the highest traditions of the Marine Corps. And the 
court is not going to overlook that there were major matters of military and 
quasi-military nature which you performed, again with the highest distinction 
at great personal risk to yourself after you came to the White House. But I'm 
sure you realize that this case has little to do with your military behavior, 
commitment or expertise. 
</P>
<P>
Point Man in Power Play 
</P>
<P>
The indictment involves your participation in particular covert events. I do 
not think that in this area you were a leader at all, but really a low-ranking 
subordinate working to carry out initiatives of a few cynical superiors. You 
came to be the point man in a very complex power play developed by higher-ups. 
Whether it was because of the excitement and the challenge or because of 
conviction, you responded certainly willingly and sometimes even excessively to 
their requirements. 
</P>
<P>
And along the way you came to accept, it seems to me, the mistaken view that 
Congress couldn't be trusted and that the fate of the country was better left 
to a small inside group, not elected by the people, who were free to act as 
they chose while publicly professing to act differently. Thus you became and by 
a series of circumstances in fact and I believe in your mind part of a scheme 
that reflected a total distrust in some constitutional values. 
</P>
<P>
Now, a trial is a very extraordinary thing. As you stand there now you're not 
the fall guy for this tragic breach of the public trust. The jury composed of 
everyday citizens your supporters mocked and mocked throughout the trial 
understood what was taking place. Observing that many others involved in the 
events were escaping without censor or with prosecutorial promises of leniency 
or immunities they used their common sense. And they gave you the benefit of a 
reasonable doubt. 
</P>
<P>
You're here now because of your own conduct when the truth was coming out. 
Apparently you could not face disclosure and decided to protect yourself and 
others. You destroyed evidence, altered and removed official documents, created 
false papers after the events to keep Congress and others from finding out what 
was happening. 
</P>
<P>
Not a Patriotic Act 
</P>
<P>
Now, I believe that you know this was morally wrong. It was against your 
bringing up. It was against your faith. It was against all of your training. 
Under the stress of the moment it was easier to choose the role of a martyr but 
that wasn't a heroic, patriotic act nor was it in the public interest. 
</P>
<P>
You have had great remorse for your family and understandably so. It is often 
the tragic part of what happens when mistakes are made. I believe you still 
lack full understanding, however, of how the public service has been tarnished. 
Nonetheless, what you believe is your own business and jail would only harden 
your misconceptions. Given the many highly commendable aspects of your life 
your punishment will not include jail. Indeed, community service may in the end 
make you more conscious of certain values which at times you and your 
associates appear to have overlooked in the elite isolation of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Your notoriety has caused many difficulties but it has also made you a rich 
man. And where you go from here is up to you, as I see it. You can continue to 
flame the myth by which you have supported yourself during these recent 
difficult years or you can turn around now and do something useful. 
</P>
<P>
Duty of Sentence 
</P>
<P>
I fashioned a sentence that punishes you. It is my duty to do that. But it 
leaves the future up to you. 
</P>
<P>
This is the sentence of the court. On count six where you are found guilty of 
aiding and abetting, obstruction of Congress, I'm going to impose a sentence of 
three years and suspend the execution of the sentence, place you on probation 
for two years, fine you $100,000 and I have to impose a special assessment of 
$50. 
</P>
<P>
Under count nine, altering, removing and destroying the permanent historical 
records of the National Security Council I impose a sentence of two years, 
suspend the execution of sentence, place you on probation for two years, fine 
you $35,000 and impose a special assessment of $50 and I am required by the 
statute to impose another mandatory penalty. You are hereby disqualified from 
holding any office under the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Under count 10, receiving an illegal gratuity, I'll impose a sentence of one 
year, suspend the execution of that sentence, place you on probation for two 
years, fine you $15,000 and impose a special assessment again of $50. These 
sentences and the probation are to run concurrently. The fines are to run 
consecutively. 
</P>
<P>
Your probation shall consist in addition to the normal requirements of 
community service in a total amount of 1,200 (hours), 800 the first year and 
400 the second year and you will remain under the supervision of the District 
of Columbia probation officer who is familiar with your situation and who has 
prepared the pre-sentence report. 
</P>
<P>
I want to talk to you about the community service. I've spent a lot of time 
thinking about it. I want the community to get the benefit of your 
organizational and administrative skills which are very very high. 
</P>
<P>
I believe, as your counsel has indicated, that you are a caring person. And 
this community service I'm putting before you like many aspects of this case is 
unique. There is a model program to be tested in the District of Columbia, 
fully financed and in the final formative stages at the present time. It 
involves a program of counseling, training and educating and, where necessary, 
providing after-care for District of Columbia inner city youths, most of whom 
are living in public housing surrounded by the drug culture. 
</P>
<P>
Opportunity for Future 
</P>
<P>
The work will involve no fund-raising, no public speaking but a very complex 
administrative task of coordinating various private and D.C. resources in a 
program targeted to see if we can't stop the scourge of drugs that hits the 
young people of this city. And I'm asking you and directing that you 
participate in that program and give it your administrative skills, your 
organizational skills and if it succeeds, as I believe and hope it will, people 
are already selecting the candidates for that service in the inner city itself, 
it gives you an opportunity, I think, a sense of fulfillment and a chance to 
start something good and wholesome for the future. 
</P>
<P>
That sentence in simple terms, I've had to give it to you in complex form 
because of the nature of the way the law has developed, but what it comes down 
to is that you have a three-year suspended sentence, you're on probation for a 
period of two years. You will have to devote 1,200 hours to the community 
service I've indicated. You have to pay $150 in special assessments. You're 
fined a total of $150,000 and you are disqualified from holding office under 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
That is the sentence of the court.

CONSERVATIVES REAFFIRM SUPPORT OF 'HERO' NORTH; 
</P>
<P>
CONTRIBUTIONS, FEES AS SPEAKER EXPECTED TO MEET $150,000 FINE

When Donald Anderson, community relations manager of the Manchester Union 
Leader, a conservative newspaper in New Hampshire, heard about Oliver L. 
North's sentence Wednesday, he remarked: "I'll bet he won't be able to open all 
the mail from people who'd be willing to send him $150,000" to pay his fine. 
</P>
<P>
But just in case, Carlos Perez, national chairman of the Miami-based Concerned 
Citizens for Democracy, said: "We are organizing already to pay for his fine. 
We won't rest until the moment he is fully vindicated." 
</P>
<P>
North -- former Marine lieutenant colonel, former White House staff member, 
sought-after public speaker and now a convicted felon -- may not have much 
trouble paying his fine on his own. That is if, after he has exhausted his 
appeals, the fine sticks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commands $25,000 
</P>
<P>
North reportedly commands about $25,000 for each of his appearances on the 
lecture circuit. At that rate, it would take him only six speeches (not 
counting the taxes he would have to pay) to earn the $150,000 fine imposed by 
federal Judge Gerhard A. Gesell for three convictions for his Iran-Contra 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
"Your notoriety has caused many difficulties, but it has also made you a rich 
man," said Gesell. "And where you go from here is up to you, as I see it. You 
can continue to flame the myth by which you have supported yourself during 
these recent difficult years, or you can turn around now and do something 
useful." 
</P>
<P>
While North was not ordered to serve time in prison, another feature of his 
sentence -- 1,200 hours of community service in a Washington anti-drug program 
-- may prove disruptive, although it will not be imposed until North has 
exhausted his appeals. That is 30 weeks of 40-hour weeks, and it could 
interfere with what acquaintances say is North's plan to write a book. 
</P>
<P>
Some of North's associates speculate that his popularity is such that he could 
win election to public office. To hold federal office, however, North first 
would have to win the appeal of his three felony convictions or receive a 
presidential pardon. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever North chooses, he must face the possibility that his celebrity will 
have a short shelf life. 
</P>
<P>
"None of us have a place in the sun forever," said Gary L. Bauer, once an 
official in the Ronald Reagan Administration and now president of the Family 
Research Council. "One can envision a time when he will be less in demand." 
</P>
<P>
For now, however, said Bauer, reflecting the views of many other conservatives, 
"he remains a hero to many of us in the conservative movement." 
</P>
<P>
He is a high-priced hero. Nackey Loeb, publisher of the Manchester Union 
Leader, personally paid North $25,000 to attract him to a Memorial Day 
celebration, according to Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen King, a Republican businessman in Wisconsin who campaigned 
unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate last year, said that he was quoted $50,000 
as North's fee when he negotiated to have him appear at a fund-raiser this 
month to help pay campaign debts. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a hell of a deal for them," King said, "not a hell of a deal for us." 
North's appearance was called off, said King, because of both North's fee and a 
potential conflict between the fund-raiser and the court sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Washington Speakers Bureau, which handles North's engagements, 
would not comment on North's fees or appearances. 
</P>
<P>
North's ventures onto the lecture circuit have endeared him to hard-core 
conservatives who love to hear his stern advocacy of aid to Nicaragua's 
Contras, his indignant criticism of the "imperial Congress" and his warnings 
against trusting Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, opponents typically carry signs and shout slogans criticizing 
North's role in the Iran-Contra scheme to sell arms to Iran and divert profits 
to the Contras. North's sentence came after his conviction May 4. 
</P>
<P>
While his case was winding its way through the courts, North spoke at political 
rallies for conservative candidates during last year's political campaign and 
he is expected to continue to do so. 
</P>
<P>
North was an asset to conservative political candidates, according to Edward 
Ceol, president of the Free Congress Research and Education Foundation, a 
conservative political action committee that acted as a clearinghouse for such 
North appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Ceol said that North will "have some time to do speeches" but added that his 
community service "will handcuff him in some respects." 
</P>
<P>
In sentencing North to work in a new program helping youngsters avoid drugs, 
Gesell called North "a caring person" and told him that he wanted the community 
"to get the benefit of your organizational and administrative skills, which are 
very high." 
</P>
<P>
Gesell said that the program will serve youngsters who live in public housing 
"surrounded by the drug culture. The work will involve no fund raising, no 
public speaking but a very complex administrative task of coordinating" a 
program that combines public and private resources. 
</P>
<P>
The work, said Gesell, will give North "an opportunity, I think, a sense of 
fulfillment and a chance to start something good and wholesome for the future." 
</P>
<P>
Many of North's supporters said that his nearly 20 years as a Marine 
constituted public service enough and vowed to redouble their efforts to secure 
a presidential pardon for him. 
</P>
<P>
Emile Beaulieu, mayor of Manchester, N.H., wishes North had been sentenced to 
community service in Manchester instead of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"If he could serve in my community," Beaulieu said, "I'd welcome him. Ethics 
and values are so important today." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE SENTENCE 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell sentenced Oliver L. North to: 
</P>
<P>
A three-year suspended prison term 
</P>
<P>
Fines totalling $150,000 
</P>
<P>
Two years of probation 
</P>
<P>
1,200 hours of community service administering a new program to help inner-city 
youth avoid involvement in drugs. 
</P>
<P>
A ban on North holding federal office 
</P>
<P>
Maximum possible sentence was 10 years in prison and fines totaling $750,000

RAIN DELAYS, CANCELS 20 AMTRAK TRAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty Amtrak trains were either delayed or canceled Wednesday, with passengers 
put on buses as heavy rain covered tracks along sections of the railroad's 
heavily traveled Northeast corridor, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Amtrak spokesman Cliff Black said about 10,000 passengers were affected by the 
flooding that covered tracks north of Wilmington, Del., with six inches of 
water and debris. One of three lines was reopened Wednesday, but repair crews 
were working to build up the damaged roadbed on the other two. 
</P>
<P>
Trains were creeping through the area at 5 m.p.h., delaying by about 30 minutes 
service on regular trains and the Metroliner express between New York City and 
Washington, Black said. 
</P>
<P>
Metroliner trains from both directions between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. were 
canceled, he said. The train normally runs every hour from New York and 
Washington, with regular trains on the half hour. 
</P>
<P>
"Travel in that whole area is badly snarled and Amtrak train operations severly 
disrupted," Black said. 
</P>
<P>
The rain came as part of the remains of Tropical Storm Allison.

WATSON SEEKS TO REAFFIRM ABORTION RIGHTS; LEGISLATIVE BATTLE FORECAST 
</P>

<P>
Seizing the offensive before anti-abortion lawmakers could act, Sen. Diane 
Watson called on lawmakers Wednesday to reaffirm California abortion rights in 
the face of a U.S. Supreme Court decision giving states greater freedom to 
restrict the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution by Watson, a Los Angeles Democrat, was the first of what is 
expected to be a torrent of bills on the issue, despite a longstanding state 
court ruling that California abortion rights are protected by the state 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Intense public pressure on the divided Legislature and Gov. George Deukmejian 
began to mount as soon as the Supreme Court handed down its decision Monday, 
and the issue is likely to move to the forefront as 100 of the Legislature's 
120 members face the voters in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Watson's resolution, if passed by the Senate, would not change California law 
on abortion. It would state the Senate's belief in abortion rights based on a 
right to privacy and express support for publicly provided care for pregnant 
women and babies. Such care could include drug abuse treatment, child abuse 
prevention programs, parenting classes and child care. 
</P>
<P>
Watson said she hopes debate on the resolution will force anti-abortion 
lawmakers to take a stand on the issue before the next round of elections. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have a bloody battle," Watson, chairwoman of the Senate Health and 
Human Services Committee, said of the years ahead. "It will be very divisive. 
People will have to stand up and be counted." 
</P>
<P>
Deadlines for introducing bills this year have already passed, and a rule 
waiver to do so would require a two-thirds vote. But Watson said she intends to 
introduce legislation later, probably next year, to update the state's 
22-year-old abortion law. Much of that law was either invalidated by the state 
courts or not enforced after the Supreme Court's historic 1973 decision 
blocking the states from banning abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion foes, meanwhile, said they might seek enforcement of two provisions in 
the 1967 law that remain on the books. One provision bans abortions after 20 
weeks of pregnancy and the other requires that all abortions be performed in 
accredited hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite intriguing," said Assemblyman Phillip Wyman (R-Tehachapi), the 
Assembly Republicans' lead member on the abortion issue. "I think Sen. Watson 
and some others are fearful that what was seen as a pro-abortion piece of 
legislation 20 years ago might be reinvigorated and interfere with the abortion 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John Doolittle (R-Rocklin) said he expects most of the action to be in the 
courts, but he suggested that he, too, may introduce legislation before the end 
of the 1989-1990 session. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's some legislation needed," he said. "I will be looking at all 
of this, and if there is something that we think is worth discussing, we will 
put that in a bill and let people vote on it." 
</P>
<P>
The most recent gauge of the Legislature's position on abortion was the 1987 
passage of a law, now being reviewed by the courts, to require parental consent 
or a court order before an unwed minor could obtain an abortion in California. 
That bill passed with 25 affirmative votes in the 40-member Senate and 46 votes 
in the 80-seat Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
But Assemblyman Terry Friedman (D-Los Angeles), one of the staunchest 
pro-choice advocates in the Legislature, said he is sure his side has the votes 
to block any further restrictions on abortion. Friedman said he polled Assembly 
members last week and found a majority of 42 "rock-solid" votes, including 
three Republicans, to leave the abortion laws as they are today.

HORACE SILVER SHINING ANEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pianist-composer Horace Silver has been a stellar participant in the modern 
jazz arena since the early '50s, when he emerged as one of the more potent 
improvisers and writers of bluesy and funky hard bop. 
</P>
<P>
But in recent years, the edge and originality that marked his early playing and 
that one found in compositions like "Nica's Dream," "Quicksilver" and "St. 
Vitus Dance" has gradually diminished. Today's Silver is more melodic, less 
hard-hitting. It's a change some will like, some won't. 
</P>
<P>
Opening a two-week stand Tuesday at Catalina Bar and Grill in Hollywood, Silver 
led a sextet of New York-based musicians through a set of mostly new tunes, 
with a couple of older vehicles, one the classic "Senor Blues," tossed in for 
good measure. 
</P>
<P>
And while "The Righteous Rhumba," "Hallelujah to Ya!" and "Mr. Blakey" had nice 
enough melodies, were orchestrated for the horns in deft Silver fashion and 
usually had varying sections, ultimately they sounded like so many other Silver 
tunes that it was hard to tell them apart. The late-'50s "Senor Blues" or the 
jackrabbit-paced "Nutville" (from the mid-'60s "The Cape Verdean Blues" Blue 
Note LP) had more character, perhaps simply because they have stood the test of 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Silver and crew -- Mike Mossman, trumpet; Ralph Bowen, tenor sax; 
James Genus, bass; Billy Drummond, drums -- were sharp as tacks, playing the 
often involved melody lines from memory and soloing with elan, particularly 
Bowen, a fluent, inventive improviser. The leader worked with his usual firm 
energy, his lines marked by a keen sense of rhythm and blues phrasing. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the empathy and dynamics Silver, Genus and Drummond, a fire stoker if 
there ever was one, exhibited behind the hornmen and as a trio were 
exhilarating. 
</P>
<P>
Singer Andy Bey joined the band for four tunes, and his voice -- resonant and 
vibrant on the bottom but a bit pinched up top -- served Silver's 
metaphysically bent lyrics well. But a stronger selection of songs, perhaps 
drawing on the still-wearing-well Silver library of comely originals, is needed 
to make the band come alive. 
</P>
<P>
Silver is at Catalina's through July 16, with Monday off. ZAN STEWART

STAGE WATCH: LONG BEACH REP TO OPEN WITH MAYO SIMON; NO NEW DIRECTIONS FOR EAST 
WEST PLAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The West Coast premiere of Mayo Simon's "Elaine's Daughter" will open the first 
and somewhat-delayed season of the new Long Beach Repertory Theatre at the Long 
Beach Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier plans to open the play in the fall in the 864-seat Center Theatre have 
been moved back to Feb. 24, according to the theater's artistic director, 
Shashin Desai. The theater's board wants to raise $300,000 before the opening 
of the first show, he added, and the board members hope to accomplish this by 
the end of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The postponement will cut back the number of shows in the initial season, from 
four to three, said Desai: "We want to start the second season in October, 
1990," and scheduling will permit the staging of only three shows between 
February and October. Desai was not ready to announce the remaining two titles, 
though he had previously said that a revival of Kevin Heelan's "Distant Fires," 
which Desai staged last year at his smaller Long Beach theater, International 
City Theatre, would be part of the first season. 
</P>
<P>
"Elaine's Daughter," by the Pacific Palisades-based Simon, is described by its 
author as a play about "an old-fashioned mother and a modern daughter and the 
reconciliation between the generations." Jules Aaron will direct, Simon said. 
Aaron staged two earlier productions of the play, at the Actors Theatre of 
Louisville's Humana Festival in 1987 and the Philadelphia Theatre Company in 
1988. The play is set in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Simon's other produced plays include "These Men," seen at Los Angeles Actors' 
Theatre in 1982 and scheduled for a London production next year, and "A Rich, 
Full Life," produced at Los Angeles Theatre Center in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
EAST WEST WATCH: Nobu McCarthy, the new artistic director of East West Players, 
has announced a season that reveals no startling changes in the policies of the 
Asian-American theater group. Last month, McCarthy replaced the group's only 
previous artistic director, Mako. 
</P>
<P>
The season will open Oct. 25 with a musical to be staged by Paul Hough, 
director of Los Angeles Theatre Center's Music Theatre Lab. Under consideration 
are Stephen Sondheim's "Company" or an original. 
</P>
<P>
Wakako Yamauchi's "Chairman's Wife," a story about Mao Tse-tung's wife Jiang 
Qing, will appear Jan. 17. Yamauchi, a resident of Gardena, wrote one of East 
West's most acclaimed productions, "And the Soul Shall Dance." 
</P>
<P>
Next up is Vernon Takeshita's "Performance Anxiety," a farce in "a very 
avant-garde style," said McCarthy (and not to be confused with a piece of the 
same title created in 1982 by the Dell'Arte Players of Blue Lake, Calif.). 
</P>
<P>
It will be directed by Alberto Isaac and open March 21. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth production will be Tennessee Williams' "The Glass Menagerie," staged 
by Rick Edelstein, opening May 3. McCarthy said she hopes to include "an 
American classic in every season," to show that Asian-American actors can 
handle non-Asian roles and "because they will never have a chance to do it 
somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
East West has been criticized for failing to reflect the influence of newer 
Asian immigrants from such countries as Vietnam, Korea and the Philippines. 
McCarthy said she would like to delve into these cultures, but "I have seen far 
more Japanese-American material than that of any other Asian group. This is the 
problem with any new immigrant group. They're so busy building and surviving 
that they don't have time to write. They can't eat their writing." 
</P>
<P>
Canadian-born McCarthy was raised in Japan but immigrated to the United States 
in 1956. Her predecessor, Mako, who co-founded East West, resigned last January 
after a dispute with the board. He had served 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy said she hopes Mako will return to the theater in some capacity -- 
"That would be wonderful. It would be like the father coming home." 
</P>
<P>
BACK TO THE SOURCE: The Spolin Players will resume their improvisational 
theater games for paying audiences at the Heliotrope Theater, every Wednesday 
at 8 p.m., beginning next week. 
</P>
<P>
Known in earlier incarnations at the Heliotrope as Sills and Company and then 
as the Spolin Games Players, the group is overseen by Viola Spolin, the grande 
dame of theatrical improvisation. Her early work in the field led to the 
creation of Second City -- which, in turn, led to the spate of improvisational 
groups that dot Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Second City has now established its own beachhead in the area. But "they do a 
very different type of work," said Gary Schwartz, one of the Spolin Players. 
"We try to stay pure to Viola's goal -- to encourage a spontaneous moment on 
stage." Unlike Second City, the Groundlings and most other improvisational 
groups, the Spolin Players present no rehearsed sketches. Everything is 
improvised. 
</P>
<P>
"The games produce laughter, but they're not specifically geared to get 
laughs," Schwartz said. "Rather than being funny, it's fun." 
</P>
<P>
A cast of 20 will be available to play the games, though the group on any given 
night will be smaller. Among participants: Edie McClurg, Dan Castellaneta, Pat 
Musick, Anne Ryerson and Randy Brenner. 
</P>
<P>
SAN BERNARDINO Civic Light Opera has announced a new non-musical series of 
comedy revivals to be staged at the California Theatre of Performing Arts from 
July through March. The schedule: "Social Security" with Bernie Kopell and 
Deborah Raffin (July 13-23), "Same Time, Next Year" with Mariette Hartley and 
Earl Holliman (Aug. 17-27), something starring Barbara Rush and Carole Cook in 
January (title to be announced in September), and the distaff "Odd Couple" with 
Lee Meriwether in March. This will be in addition to the usual musical 
offerings.

TWO DAVID KRANES ONE-ACTS AT FRIENDS THEATRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If one can draw any conclusions about a playwright's take on life from viewing 
only two of his one-acts, then it's safe to say that David Kranes thinks that 
the people most deserving of our attention are those who don't stand still. 
</P>
<P>
Young, willful Gayle in "Montana" and the taciturn but secretly ambitious 
Douglas in "Audience" are willing to make unlikely, gigantic leaps into the 
unknown from lives of staid predictability. 
</P>
<P>
That shared spirit is why pairing the plays under the title "States of Mind," 
at Friends and Artists Theatre, makes sense. They echo and strengthen each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
That isn't to say, though, that this is strong theater. It is precisely Gayle's 
and Douglas' risk-taking that is often so missing from Kranes' writing. He 
confuses poetry with good dramatic writing. In the seeming effort to write a 
familiar scene in a new way -- Gayle's attempt to persuade New York designer 
Amelia Silk to take her to Gotham, for instance -- it ends up being familiar 
and long-winded. Kranes doesn't need passion, but he does need an editor. 
</P>
<P>
What makes you keep listening to Kranes are the surprises he tosses in. Gayle's 
mother, we're told, passed on a Berkeley schooling and has ended up as an 
all-purpose mechanic in remotest Montana. She exists outside our preconceptions 
and is just the kind of mother who would have reared a free spirit like Gayle. 
</P>
<P>
We want much more from her, though, than Kranes gives us; in turn, Michael 
David Simms' direction and Sharonlee McLean's performance are surface work, as 
are Kerry Remsen's Gayle and Holly Butler's Amelia. This is not a production 
ahead of its audience's expectations, and it should be. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Bumiller's staging of "Audience" comes closer to the kind of dynamic 
Kranes desires. The trick is not getting bogged down in details -- such as how 
Greg Thirloway's Douglas, an upper-class brat, can possibly be a credible 
candidate for country-Western stardom. Somehow, Douglas' glib, disingenuous 
manager (a funny Paul Eisenhauer) sold superstar Hank on him (a deft Simms, 
switching to actor). And we buy it when Douglas loosens up with Hank enough to 
admit that he thinks he is a no-talent. 
</P>
<P>
Again, what saves the play and production from mediocrity are the surprises: 
Douglas really has a fine voice, and Hank, seemingly an over-the-hill Nashville 
idol fixated on football, is an effective mentor. But even more than "Montana," 
"Audience" arrives at its conclusion in a sloppily protracted way. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1761 N. Vermont Ave., on Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 2 and 7 
p.m., through July 23. Tickets: $12.50; (213) 653-1008.

4 DODGERS NAMED TO ALL-STAR TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ST. LOUIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It will be announced today that four Dodgers have been named to the National 
League team for Tuesday night's 60th All-Star game at Anaheim Stadium. 
According to team sources, they are pitchers Orel Hershiser and Jay Howell, 
second baseman Willie Randolph and catcher Mike Scioscia. 
</P>
<P>
With Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda managing the National League team because the 
Dodgers won the pennant in 1988, this year's game will have the most Dodger 
representatives -- five -- since 1982. Just to keep things blue, Dodger coaches 
Joe Amalfitano, Mark Cresse and Bill Russell will serve as batting practice 
pitchers for the National League. 
</P>
<P>
"(National League President) Bill White has a lot to do with the selections, 
but I make sure and let him know my picks, too," said Lasorda, who would not 
confirm the individual Dodger selections because they weren't due to be 
announced until today. 
</P>
<P>
Said Randolph: "This is a credit to some of the great individual performances 
we are getting this year. No matter what else, we still have some of the best 
players in the game." 
</P>
<P>
For Randolph, the selection was special, this being his first year in the 
National League after he made the American League team for five seasons as a 
member of the New York Yankees. Before this season, 40 players had the made the 
team in both leagues. 
</P>
<P>
It is also special for Scioscia, who is on the team for the first time in his 
10-year career. 
</P>
<P>
This will be the third appearance for both Hershiser and Howell. 
</P>
<P>
"The team is always first, but everybody also has little personal goals, and 
this was one of mine at the beginning of the year," said Randolph, batting .289 
after Wednesday's 3-2 loss here. With just three errors in 80 games, his fine 
fielding has also helped the Dodgers lead the National League with 86 double 
plays. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that there are a lot of good second baseman in the league, a lot of 
established players, and I came in new," Randolph said. "That's what makes this 
so nice. I'm glad to be recognized." 
</P>
<P>
Although Scioscia would not comment on his selection before today's 
announcement, earlier this week he said he doubted if he would be recognized. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel I'm having a good offensive year, and historically, defense and 
other things have not been a factor in the selections, so I'm not expecting to 
get picked," said Scioscia, who is hitting .246 in 70 games with 20 runs batted 
in. 
</P>
<P>
Defense and intangibles must have been a factor this year, as Scioscia has 
thrown out 37% of would-be base-stealers (19 of 52) -- not to mention his 
handling of the league's best pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was going good last year at the halfway point, but I wasn't 
picked, so I just don't want to think about it," Sciosciaa said earlier. "If 
what I do gets overlooked, it gets overlooked. The All-Star game would be an 
honor, but I've got two World Series rings and they mean more to me than 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Howell, with a 0.78 earned-run average and 15 saves, has bad memories from his 
last All-Star appearance, in Oakland in 1987, when he was a member of the host 
A's. 
</P>
<P>
During the pregame introductions he became one of the few home team players in 
All-Star history to be booed by his own crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, that was me, I was the one," Howell said a couple of weeks ago. "I don't 
think many people have forgotten that. It wasn't as bad as it seemed, because 
there were a lot of Giant fans there, and they always hate us. And I was just 
coming off a tough game on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"But it was still weird." 
</P>
<P>
Howell wound up giving up two runs in the game's final two innings and was the 
losing pitcher, the start of problems caused by bone chips in his elbow. A 
month after the game, he underwent elbow surgery and was done for the season. 
</P>
<P>
"But heck, if they want to pick me again, I'll show up," Howell had said with a 
smile. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser, meanwhile, is going into the game well rested, as he made his final 
start before the All-Star break in Wednesday night's no-decision game against 
St. Louis. He is 9-7 with a 2.42 ERA and leads the league with four shutouts. 
However, he hasn't won in his last two starts, lasting six innings in each, 
giving up a total of six runs and 14 hits. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be starting for us on Thursday after the break . . . so I don't know 
if I could pitch more than an inning in the All-Star game, if at all," 
Hershiser said.

JUDGE GIVES ROSE LAWYERS UNTIL JULY 17 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manager Pete Rose, facing the threat of a lifetime suspension for allegedly 
betting on his Cincinnati Reds, received assurance Wednesday that he will not 
be suspended or fired for at least two more weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Judge John D. Holschuh of the U.S. District Court in Columbus, Ohio, gave 
Rose's lawyers until July 17 to file arguments for keeping their lawsuit 
against Commissioner Bart Giamatti in a Cincinnati state court. Lawyers for 
Giamatti, seeking to move the case to a federal court, must file by July 12. 
</P>
<P>
The respective attorneys met with Holschuh Wednesday and agreed that Rose will 
continue to be protected against suspension or firing while Holschuh considers 
whether a federal or state court has jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
Rose was initially protected against suspension or firing by a 14-day temporary 
restraining order issued June 25 by Judge Norbert A. Nadel of the Common Pleas 
Court of Hamilton County, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Nadel ruled at the time in support of Rose's contention that Giamatti had 
prejudged his investigation into Rose's alleged gambling activities and issued 
the temporary restraining order that prevented Giamatti from conducting a 
hearing June 26 that might have resulted in Rose's suspension. 
</P>
<P>
Nadel, at the time, had scheduled a hearing for today on Rose's request for a 
preliminary injunction against Giamatti, but that was set aside by Holschuh's 
delay in deciding where the case belongs. 
</P>
<P>
The new timetable means that it could be late July or early August before an 
injunction hearing is held and long after that -- if Rose is granted the 
injunction -- before determination on his status is reached. 
</P>
<P>
Because of that, there was increased speculation Wednesday that a settlement, 
which would allow Rose to finish the season before agreeing to bow out as the 
Reds' manager on his own terms, is in the works. 
</P>
<P>
However, Deputy Commissioner Francis Vincent said there were no new or 
continuing discussions regarding a resolution, although he added, "We will 
entertain any proposal that does not diminish the authority of the 
commissioner." 
</P>
<P>
Or, put another way, any proposal that does not require Giamatti to step aside 
in this matter. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, attorneys for Giamatti had filed Monday to have the case moved 
to a federal court, where the commissioner's authority has been repeatedly 
upheld and where presiding judges are appointed and not elected, as they are 
for state courts. Nadel, a state judge in Rose's hometown, faces reelection 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. District Court in Cincinnati responded to Giamatti's motion by 
expressing doubt that the case belonged in a federal court but acknowledged 
that technical requirements had been met. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, it was assigned to the Columbus-based Holschuh because, according to the 
Cincinnati court, Rose "is not just another litigant. He is instead a baseball 
figure of national reputation closely identified with the Cincinnati Reds and 
the city of Cincinnati. Under such circumstances, it would appear advisable 
that it be transferred to a city of the southern district of Ohio other than 
Cincinnati." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Stachler, Rose's lead attorney, responded Wednesday with a motion to 
return the case to state court and lashed out at the commissioner in his 
filing. 
</P>
<P>
Stachler wrote that by turning to the federal courts, Giamatti was trying to 
hand Rose "a predetermined death sentence." 
</P>
<P>
He also alluded to Nadel's initial decision and the state appeal court's 
rejection of Giamatti's attempt to have the restraining order suspended as he 
wrote: "By taking two strikes in the state courts, baseball now tries to avert 
Strike 3 by removing this proceeding to what it hopes will be a more favorable 
venue." 
</P>
<P>
It was in response to Stachler's motion Wednesday that Holschuh met with both 
sides and established his new timetable. Stachler said he was pleased.

JIM MURRAY: HE CAN TRADE PLAYERS BUT NOT IMAGE

<TEXT>
<P>
On Page 168 of his book, "Jack of All Trades," Jack McKeon says: "I promise 
you, I will never manage the San Diego Padres." 
</P>
<P>
There are those who think he has kept his word, that what he has done since 
stepping down -- or sideways -- from the general manager's job can hardly be 
construed as managing. 
</P>
<P>
Or, it's possible that the San Diego Padres cannot be managed. They are, like 
San Diego itself, kind of bland, mild, not terribly interesting, a team with an 
annual average temperature of 70, light winds out of the southwest and tomorrow 
more of the same. Pure vanilla. White bread. Naturally decaffeinated. Unleaded 
regular. Sea World East. 
</P>
<P>
They keep getting cranky managers to see if they can light a fire under this 
bunch, but it always fizzles out. This is a team that traded away Ozzie Smith, 
who is only the greatest shortstop who ever turned a double play; Kevin 
McReynolds, Dave Winfield, Kevin Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
They once had a 20-game winner whose fastball looked like a changeup. You got 
two swings at it. They're not a team, they're a drag. 
</P>
<P>
They drove tough-guy managers Dick Williams and Larry Bowa up the wall. 
</P>
<P>
It is a team that needed a couple of characters. So they got Jack McKeon to 
come out from behind a desk and onto the field to see if he could get these 
guys to, at least, frost a mirror. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball lately has been getting like the rest of American business -- 
computerized, depersonalized, a kind of commodity market in spikes. They get 
managers up through the ranks -- organization men. B-o-r-r-r-i-n-g. 
</P>
<P>
Many years ago, when the New York Yankees hired Casey Stengel, a man who had 
never won anything but laughs, who was widely regarded as a buffoon, not a 
baseball man, the reaction was, "Well, there goes the dynasty!" 
</P>
<P>
Well, Casey won 10 pennants in 12 years, rewrote English syntax and, above all, 
made it fun. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of us thought Jack McKeon might do somewhat the same for the San Diego 
Padres. The Padres, to be sure, are not to be confused with the Stengel Yankees 
-- or any other kind of Yankees, for that matter -- but they figured McKeon 
might liven them up. The Padres had tried the Obersturmbannfuhrer approach and 
it didn't work, maybe the light approach could do it. 
</P>
<P>
Jack is not one of those guys who goes around letting birds out of his cap. But 
he does have a sense of humor and that right there would be a switch for San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Jack is a guy who once pulled a gun out of his pocket and fired blanks at one 
of his players who ran through his stop sign in the third base coaching box. 
The fellow was out anyway when he covered his head and hit the deck halfway to 
the plate, but Jack thinks his lesson got home even if his runner didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Another time, Jack bought a clothesline to tether one of his adventurous 
runners. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all in my book," reminded Jack the other night as he stood on the steps 
of the dugout in Dodger Stadium and watched his pitcher warming up. "You could 
do those things in the minor leagues. You could have fun." 
</P>
<P>
Jack once wired up his pitcher to a two-way hookup and radioed him when a guy 
would take too big a lead at first. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, I forgot to tell my first baseman, and the first throw over 
there hit him right in the head," McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
The minor leagues, contends Jack, had a higher concentration of flakes than 
Kellogg's. For instance, you ever hear of a pitcher protesting a called third 
strike? McKeon did. 
</P>
<P>
His pitching staff had been burned so often on 0-2 pitches that he announced he 
would fine any pitcher throwing an 0-2 strike. His pitcher, on an 0-2 count, 
threw a pitch so high and away the catcher had to leap for it. 
</P>
<P>
"Strike Three!" yelled the ump. 
</P>
<P>
Off the mound came the irate pitcher, screaming, "That ball was high! That's no 
strike!" 
</P>
<P>
As a wheeler-dealer, Jack had a reputation of a guy who would trade Ruth and 
Gehrig just to shake things up. Since he didn't have them, he did the next best 
thing: Smith and Kevin Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Jack traded players by the carload -- an 11-player deal once, an 
eight-player swap another time, two seven-player transactions, two involving 
six and two involving five. Unaccountably, it worked. Jack actually put 
together the team that won the 1984 National League pennant. 
</P>
<P>
It's not likely that Jack McKeon can turn the Padres into the Gashouse Gang, 
but they do need a little lightening up. They need a little fizz. They have the 
talent to win. Provided Jack doesn't trade it away. All he has to do is make 
the Padres exciting. 
</P>
<P>
If he can do that, think what a cinch Calvin Coolidge would have been for him.

ORIOLES ARE SENDING GET-WELL CARDS THIS SEASON; 
</P>
<P>
UNLIKE THE REST OF AL EAST, BALTIMORE HAS AVOIDED INJURIES TO KEY PLAYERS 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
far, the Baltimore Orioles' season has been a storybook saga, a "Worst To 
First" rise that has defied description and forced all the baseball experts to 
choke on their predictions. 
</P>
<P>
As the Orioles near their midpoint of the season, they are the talk of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
But, until recently, when attrition began to gnaw at the pitching staff, the 
Orioles also have defied the one thing that can ravage any contender: injuries 
to crucial personnel. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, other clubs have been hit harder than us," said General Manager 
Roland Hemond. "We're grateful that things have gone pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
Not that key personnel hasn't been missing. Bill Ripken, the starting second 
baseman, and Steve Finley, one of the shuttling outfielders, were disabled 
early in the season. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Bob Melvin was missing for 15 days -- the period in which Mickey 
Tettleton got hot and soared into national prominence -- and three pitchers, 
Oswald Peraza, Mark Bowden and John Habyan, did not even start the season. 
</P>
<P>
But those losses occurred early -- before the division took form -- and the 
Orioles generally have avoided the siege that has hit hard at their American 
League East opposition, particularly the Detroit Tigers, Milwaukee Brewers, 
Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
None of the big guns -- Cal Ripken Jr., Tettleton or Phil Bradley -- has been 
felled. 
</P>
<P>
"Their loss would be a tremendous blow to the club," said Manager Frank 
Robinson. "I don't know if we could play well without them. I don't even want 
to think about it." 
</P>
<P>
Look around elsewhere and key cogs have been and are missing. Marty Barrett, 
Ellis Burks and Oil Can Boyd at Boston. Dave Winfield, John Candelaria and 
Roberto Kelly at New York. Paul Molitor, Ted Higuera, Juan Nieves and Dale 
Sveum at Milwaukee. Jack Morris, Jeff Robinson, Matt Nokes, Alan Trammell and 
Gary Pettis at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Robinson has said often this year that, with few exceptions, the talent 
level of the Orioles roster is relatively even down the line. That means one 
player can replace another without a big dropoff. 
</P>
<P>
"But where it weakens you is when you don't have the other player," he said. 
"We're not a deep ballclub. When healthy, we're a good team. But we can't 
afford a lot of injuries. Everything else, you can work around or work with, 
but not injuries." 
</P>
<P>
According to Orioles trainer Richie Bancells, overall the injury recovery pace 
"is a little ahead of last year and I think our youth has a lot to do with it. 
Young players just recover faster." 
</P>
<P>
"They're less inclined to get the muscle pulls than older guys," said Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
An argument can also be made for the strength and conditioning program this 
year under the supervision of Al Johnson, but Robinson is reserving judgment 
until more data is in. 
</P>
<P>
"We're into new territory there," he said. "I don't know yet what that has 
meant." 
</P>
<P>
Hemond said: "I think it has been a positive, just in a prevention sense and 
for stamina building. Major league baseball is grueling. If you're not in top 
condition, you can't recover as well." 
</P>
<P>
What has the manager concerned most is the recent spate of injuries to his 
pitchers, "an area where we can least afford it. You lose a starter and it 
affects your bullpen, a bullpen guy and it affects your starters. Luckily, Mark 
Williamson made a remarkable recovery." 
</P>
<P>
Hemond said the "hunger" of the youth and the evenness of the talent help the 
Orioles withstand losses, even those for a few days, better than clubs with an 
older, more set lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"There might not be the disparity in talent other clubs have," he said, "and 
we've had players like (pitcher Mickey) Weston and some others come in and 
capitalize on their opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"With many of them in the early stages of their careers, they go for it." 
</P>
<P>
As any manager would, Robinson does not consider the Orioles fortunate, citing 
the nagging type of ailments (like center fielder Brady Anderson's ingrown 
toenail that forced him to miss several games) as statistics that do not appear 
on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
And he certainly isn't worrying about what has happened to the rest of the 
American League East. Nor is Hemond. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's not forget that early part when we had our problems," said Hemond. "And 
we cross our fingers because we can't predict day to day what might happen. 
</P>
<P>
"But you can't feel sorry for yourself if they do. I know the opposition never 
sends you any sympathy cards."

TOUR DE FRANCE CYCLISTS ARE GIVEN DAY OFF BEFORE TODAY'S SIXTH STAGE

DINARD, France 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After five races in four days in three countries, the remaining 195 cyclists in 
the Tour de France enjoyed an off day Wednesday as they were transported from 
Wasquehal in northern France to Dinard in the west. 
</P>
<P>
Acacio da Silva of Portugal had the leader's yellow jersey as the riders 
prepared for the sixth stage, an individual time trial of 45 miles from Dinard 
to Rennes in Brittany. 
</P>
<P>
Mechanical problems with air transport delayed some of the teams from leaving 
Lille Airport, but by late Wednesday afternoon, all the teams were ready for 
the second part of the tour. 
</P>
<P>
After flat courses south, the riders encounter the Pyrenees mountains and then 
head east before their next day off on July 17. After that, they have a long 
haul to Paris where the remaining riders will finish on July 23 with another 
time trial from Versailles to downtown Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Da Silva has a 14-second margin over Soren Lilholt of Denmark, with Thierry 
Marie of France third, almost two minutes back. 
</P>
<P>
American Greg LeMond, the 1986 champion, was 14th, 3:28 behind, after a fine 
weekend that included a fourth in the prologue. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond is realistic about his chances this year after a hunting accident, an 
emergency appendectomy and knee and shin problems since he won the famous 
cycling race three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"If I finish in the first 20, I'll be very happy," he said. "In the top ten, as 
happy as in 1986. If I end up on the podium, I would consider it as my greatest 
victory."

CLIPPERS, SCHULER MEET FOR 7 HOURS, BUT NO DECISION

No decisions were made after Clipper officials met with Mike Schuler for 
approximately seven hours Wednesday about the team's vacant coaching position, 
but General Manager Elgin Baylor said he expected the matter to be resolved 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a long conversation with Mike and the owner (Donald T. Sterling)," 
Baylor said. "It went very well, but nothing was decided. 
</P>
<P>
"But I will tell you this. A decision will be made no later than next week." 
</P>
<P>
Don Casey, the interim coach since Jan. 19, and Schuler, who spent 2 1/2 
seasons with the Portland Trail Blazers before being fired Feb. 18, are the 
only candidates to be interviewed. No further meetings with Schuler have been 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
Schuler, who finished the 1988-89 season as a scout with the Golden State 
Warriors, returned to his Bay Area home Wednesday night and could not be 
reached for comment. SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER

NEWSWIRE: METS SAY THAT GOODEN MAY MISS 3 TO 4 WEEKS DUE TO SHOULDER INJURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dwight Gooden, who was put on the disabled list last weekend, has been 
diagnosed with a slight muscle tear in his right shoulder and may miss three to 
four weeks, the New York Mets announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets quoted Dr. Fiske Warren, one of the club's orthopedic surgeons, as 
saying there was no other damage to the arm and "no career-threatening 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
Gooden, a right-hander pitcher with a 9-4 record and a 2.99 earned-run average, 
had experienced tightness and some pain in the shoulder for the past month. He 
was placed on the 15-day disabled list Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Warren said the best treatment for the injury was rest.

BOB NORDSKOG IS 76 -- BUT STILL VERY MUCH IN THE FAST LANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Shav Glick 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Nordskog, 76, is showing no signs of slowing down. 
</P>
<P>
The millionaire ocean racer-industrialist from Van Nuys will be at the helm of 
his 38-foot powerboat Saturday for 120 miles of pounding across the surf at 
speeds approaching 100 m.p.h. in the Race for Sight, event No. 4 in the Pacific 
Offshore Power Boat Racing Assn. season. 
</P>
<P>
Nordskog won overall in the first race, the Sweetheart, and won in his class in 
the second race, the Rum Run, but had mechanical failure in the Ventura Channel 
Dash in May. 
</P>
<P>
The Race for Sight, which will help raise money for Guide Dogs for the Blind of 
San Rafael, Calif., will start and finish at Marina del Rey. It will consist of 
two 60-mile loops -- from Marina del Rey south to Palos Verdes Point off 
Redondo Beach, then north to Point Dume, west of Malibu, and return to Marina 
del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller boats will race only one lap, or 60 miles. 
</P>
<P>
This will be the seventh Race for Sight and Nordskog, who is also president and 
founder of the power boat association, has won six of them, including last 
year's. 
</P>
<P>
Weather conditions should help determine the outcome of Saturday's race. If the 
ocean is smooth, Jim Duvall of Long Beach and his twin-hull catamaran, Crimson 
Tide, which can skim over the water at 100 m.p.h., will be favored. Duvall won 
overall in the Rum Run and Ventura races and has won the tunnel boat class in 
all three starts. 
</P>
<P>
If it is rough, Nordskog's 10-year-old Scarab, which has won 33 races in 36 
starts, will be the favorite. 
</P>
<P>
"Rough water is the equalizer," Nordskog said. "Duvall is faster than we are in 
smooth water, but if it gets choppy, we take the advantage." 
</P>
<P>
Nordskog built a new and faster boat, a 40-foot Fountain, for this season and 
raced it in the last two races. It won the nontunnel class in the Rum Run, a 
race around Catalina, in a heavy fog, but in the Ventura race it developed a 
problem in the drive train that has not been resolved to Nordskog's 
satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what the old boat can do and it's ready," he said. "It won its last 
race, the Sweetheart, in March, and even though it's about 10 m.p.h. slower 
than the new boat, it's probably more reliable." 
</P>
<P>
Another potential winner is John Peters of Phoenix, in Honcho, a 41-foot 
V-bottom boat that won in its class at Ventura. Other challengers include Karl 
Koster of San Francisco, in a new 30-foot Kal Kustom that will be racing for 
the first time, and Tom Hays of Pasadena in the 30-foot All Risk. A fleet of 25 
boats is expected for all classes. 
</P>
<P>
"The unique factor about our organization is that in 23 years, we have never 
had a fatality, or even a major accident," Nordskog said. "You hear quite often 
about accidents in the Atlantic, but not on our side. 
</P>
<P>
"The water's the same, but the lectures and the penalties aren't. I lecture all 
the racers on the important of safety at every race. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"If we find a driver creates a dangerous hazard, we disqualify him for a day, 
or a month, or if it's flagrant and something we cannot tolerate, we will 
disqualify him for life." 
</P>
<P>
The race will start at 10 a.m. The only viewing points will be from spectator 
boats. 
</P>
<P>
SPRINT CARS -- After a three-race weekend during which Ron Shuman, John Redican 
and Brad Noffsinger were winners, the Parnelli Jones Firestone/California 
Racing Assn. season returns to one-night action Saturday when Ascot Park holds 
a 30-lap main event for the wingless sprinters. It will be the first race of a 
three-night Budweiser American Sprint Car Series which offers $3,000 to top 
finishers in semi-main events as well as the feature races. 
</P>
<P>
Despite finishing sixth at Ascot and Tucson and 16th at Phoenix, Jerry Meyer 
retained his series lead with 2,499 points to the closely bunched pack of Rip 
Williams, 2,366; Shuman, 2,360, and Noffsinger, 2,343. 
</P>
<P>
MOTOCROSS -- The first round of the Dodge Truck California Summer Series, 
sponsored by the Continental Motosport Club, will be run Sunday at Glen Helen 
Park in San Bernardino. The nine-race series will conclude Aug. 27 at Carlsbad 
Raceway, former site of the United States Grand Prix. The CMC will also race 
Friday night at Ascot Park. . . . Ventura Raceway will open its Coors/Kawasaki 
summer series Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Bob (Hurricane) Hannah, 32, a six-time American Motorcyclist Assn. national 
champion and winner of 63 national events, will make his final competitive 
appearance Sunday in the 250cc U.S. Grand Prix at Unadilla Valley in New 
Berlin, N.Y. Other U.S. entries include Rick Johnson, who started his comeback 
from a serious wrist injury by winning the Mammoth Mountain Invitational two 
weeks ago, Jeff Ward, Micky Dymond, Johnny O'Mara, Broc Glover and George 
Holland. World points leader is Jean-Michel Bayle of France, the 125cc world 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
VINTAGE CARS -- The Great American Race will end its 12-day trek across the 
country Friday morning at Disneyland after stops Thursday in Holtville for an 
afternoon rest and San Diego for the night. The old-time vehicles are scheduled 
to reach Disneyland at 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
HILL CLIMB -- The Millen brothers, Rod and Steve, New Zealand natives who live 
in Orange County, will tackle Pikes Peak and its 156 turns in 12.5 miles Sunday 
in different equipment. Rod, 38, an international rally champion, will debut a 
Mazda MX-6 in the Rally GT class. Steve, 36, a two-time winner of the Mickey 
Thompson Gran Prix stadium championship, will be in a General Tire Nissan V-6 
pickup in the truck class. 
</P>
<P>
OFF-ROAD -- Less than a minute kept Robby Gordon of Orange from winning his 
seventh overall trophy in three years in the High Desert Racing Assn./SCORE 
series last Saturday in the Fireworks 250 out of Barstow. After more than five 
hours of desert racing, Gordon's '89 Ford truck finished 59 seconds behind Bob

Elders IXL Managers Say Buyout Near: Elders IXL Ltd. Chairman John Elliott and 
other executives said they were close to completing a buyout bid for the 
Australian brewing company through their privately held firm, Harlin Holdings. 
Elliott said Harlin, which currently owns a 34% fully diluted stake in Elders, 
is arranging financing for a stock swap that values the company at $4.08 
billion. He added that Harlin is expected to make an announcement before an 
Elders shareholders meeting on July 27. Elders is part of a group helping Los 
Angeles investor Alfred Checchi finance his $4.05-billion bid for NWA, the 
parent of Northwest Airlines.

WORKING UP A SWEAT IN THE HOT OUTDOORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For some, the office is outside and the only relief from the heat and the smog 
is an occasional breeze. 
</P>
<P>
John Goss is one of those people. 
</P>
<P>
A yard superintendent at Terry Lumber Co. in Northridge, Goss, 31, is 
responsible for a work crew of 25. Using forklifts and other heavy machinery to 
assemble loads of lumber for new home and office construction, he said the 
current building boom is making for 12-hour days that begin at 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is pretty well run down by about 2 o'clock. The heat begins to fry 
your brains after a while," Goss said, adding that the asphalt gets up to about 
120 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Radenbaugh, 36, of Bilt-Well Roofing of Glassell Park has been working up 
a sweat in the San Fernando Valley for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
"You've gotta work quickly and you gotta keep moving," he said about being a 
roofer during the hot summer months. "We usually wet the roof down and keep it 
wet up there, borrowing the customer's hose and hosing ourselves down as well." 
</P>
<P>
When not behind a desk, Dennis P. Zine, 41, a motorcycle supervisor for the Los 
Angeles Police Department, is patrolling the Valley on his Kawasaki 1000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Engine Heat 
</P>
<P>
"You get that heat rising from the engine," said Zine "and there are many days 
it feels like I'm in an oven; like Mom's making bread and you open the oven 
door and that hot blast hits you." 
</P>
<P>
Zine said he also notices the effect the heat has on motorists. "When it gets 
100-plus, people's fuses become shorter" and they become more aggressive and 
hostile. 
</P>
<P>
For a working LAPD motorcycle officer, the heat is more uncomfortable because 
of the uniform -- heavy wool pants designed for protection if the rider hits 
the pavement, a bulletproof vest, pistol, spare bullets, a night stick, 
handcuffs, gloves, boots and helmet. "You just bear with it," Zine said, adding 
that after a while he gets used to the temperature. 
</P>
<P>
Gracie Casillas, 30, is a letter carrier in the Chatsworth Branch of the post 
office who works a route on DeSoto between Devonshire and Lassen. On a typical 
work day, she delivers about 2,500 letters and 400 magazines -- not including 
junk mail -- in 900 individual stops. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes you die out there," Casillas said. "You can't really stop and relax 
and take it easy. You've got lunch but that's about it. I must have lost five 
pounds today." 
</P>
<P>
And it's not much better for airline employees such as Rob Borucki, 22, a 
customer service representative with America West Airlines at the Burbank 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
When he's not behind the ticket counter, Borucki is pounding the pavement as a 
"ramp rat," part of the ground crew that takes care of loading and unloading 
baggage. At least a of couple times a day he has to crawl inside the hot belly 
of a 737. "The heat is magnified out on the asphalt ramp," Borucki said, "It 
just kind of wells up at you and wears you out faster." 
</P>
<P>
To keep it together in the heat, everyone said they drink liquids and watch for 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"You pace yourself," Goss said. "You go fast in the morning and take her slow 
in the evening." He wears a short-sleeved shirt and a hat at all times. His 
drink of choice is water. "Not too fast and not too much during the day. I stay 
away from the sugary drinks." 
</P>
<P>
Goss is most concerned about someone in his crew getting a headache. "It means 
they're getting dehydrated and have been out there too long," he said. "They 
need a rest." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weight Loss 
</P>
<P>
There can be a plus side to the heat, Goss said. "We've got one guy who started 
two weeks ago at 258 pounds. Now he's under 250." 
</P>
<P>
"We take our shirts off and get a nice tan," said roofer Radenbaugh. "The heat 
really affects us, and we have to take a break every couple of hours. We 
perspire a lot and drink a lot of Cokes. Coke is the in drink. Plenty of ice 
and ice water as a chaser. 
</P>
<P>
"We always watch each other, looking for signs of dizziness. We wear 
sunglasses, take salt tablets and always put a hat on. It's a good job, I'm 
always out in the open. Thank goodness for a cool breeze, though." 
</P>
<P>
People in uniform stay as comfortable as possible by drinking plenty of 
liquids. LAPD's Zine prefers iced tea; postal worker Casillas opts for water. 
Added Casillas, "And on my day off, whenever I see my mailman, I give him 
something to drink."

WHERE PLAYWRITING IS STILL THE THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a hot, dry, breeze-less summer day at Cal State Northridge, and 
everybody's mind was on . . . playwriting. 
</P>
<P>
"What's the point of my writing plays?" said a serious-faced Murray Mednick, as 
he launched the six-week writing workshop of the 12th annual Padua Hills 
Playwrights' Workshop/Festival at the university's Art and Design Center. "I 
don't mean it as a tease. Is there a point? Do we really need more plays in the 
world?" 
</P>
<P>
The 25 workshop participants -- chosen from nationwide entries -- were 
momentarily silent. "It could be we're trying to communicate a human 
experience," said one. 
</P>
<P>
"A shared thought, a shared experience," offered another. 
</P>
<P>
"Be specific," Mednick said briskly. "What do we mean when we say: We write to 
communicate?" 
</P>
<P>
Padua Hills was founded in 1978, when Mednick and five other playwrights 
gathered with nine writing students in the foothills of the San Gabriel 
Mountains just north of Claremont and established a pattern of exercises, 
rehearsals and informal presentations. Since then, the company has expanded. 
But it also has drifted from such diverse sites as the Pacific Design Center 
and the Wallenboyd since 1984, lacking a permanent home. 
</P>
<P>
Mednick took a year off last year, but this year he is back -- and hoping that 
the new relationship with Cal State Northridge will be healthy and ongoing. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem of writing for the stage is that it isn't seen or sensed," Mednick 
told his students. "I think it's important we start making an effort toward 
getting to clarity. The word audience means listeners; one of the qualities 
that raises the level of communication is attention. The other side is having 
an ear for the rhythms and music of language. It's also important to hang 
around rehearsals, to subconsciously get a feel for the subject. That's how a 
playwright develops his craft." 
</P>
<P>
Time for the exercises to begin. 
</P>
<P>
"Sit up straight," Mednick said. "Everything (in you) should be prepared to be 
a writer. It will take a willingness on your part to go along. Work is about 
using parts of your body as if they were listening stations -- because the body 
has been through every experience in life . . . Let's see if I can't quiet the 
noise. The sky is resting on my head, the earth is at my feet. My right hand 
can record anything I have to say -- my living, electric right hand. The idea 
is to write fast and continuously, till I say (stop). Begin now." 
</P>
<P>
Workshop student Susan Hayden -- who makes hats, acts, writes and gives poetry 
readings around town -- is here for the second year. 
</P>
<P>
"Every two days you get a different angle, a different playwright's perspective 
on how the process works for them," she said of the rotation. "We write, we 
experiment, read our material back and forth to each other. Last year, I did 
exercises with David Henry Hwang and John O'Keefe. A one-act came out of that. 
I came back to write the second one-act, so I can have a whole show." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Mednick, this year's playwright/instructors include: Hwang, Alan 
Bolt, Maria Irene Fornes, Jon Robin Baitz, John Steppling, Martin Epstein, 
Julie Hebert, Lin Hixson, Eduardo Machado, Leon Martell, Susan Mosakowski and 
Roxanne Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an opportunity to come work on a play in an environment totally 
supportive and totally geared towards the writing and producing of plays," said 
the New York-based Mosakowski, who will stage her "Cities Out of Print" during 
the festival portion of Padua Hills' program. As a workshop instructor, "I'm 
very interested in the nonverbal aspect of the text, what's behind the text. 
I'll be creating in a way silent plays, which we will then take into 
narrative." 
</P>
<P>
Over in a dorm gathering area, Alan Bolt, a former chairman of the National 
Theatre Department of the Ministry of Culture in Nicaragua, was sweating 
through an energetic dance workshop for his performers. The result will be a 
staging of his "Beloved Love" (about violence toward women). 
</P>
<P>
"We use dance as a systematic way of training actors in Nicaragua," said Bolt. 
"Doing the dance, they train the memory of their body. We store all sorts of 
memories in the body: grief, sorrow, joy. In dance, that comes out more easily. 
Then we can develop a certain process to develop awareness. I ask them, 'Where 
did you put your tension in the dance when you were joyful?' or 'When I told 
you to straighten your back, what did you feel?' " 
</P>
<P>
Another first-timer is local playwright John Pappas, who will stage his 
"Increments of Three." "I don't know what's going to happen," said Pappas, who 
is enjoying the idea of mounting his outdoors-set play outdoors. "When they 
asked me to come, I said, 'What do you want me to do?' They said, 'Whatever you 
want.' " The play itself, he said, "is pretty well done -- half done. I mean, I 
know where it's going. But I'm not there yet." 
</P>
<P>
Eight-year veteran Leon Martell, whose "Kindling" will be staged in the 
festival, puts great emphasis on what he has able to learn from other 
playwrights: "The first time I saw pieces of John Steppling's 'Neck,' I hated 
it. I hated him -- personally. Then I said, 'Wait a minute. This is part of 
something. I should see the whole play.' Once I did, it began to grow on me, 
and I became addicted to it. I started seeing new stuff in it. It changed the 
way I thought of playwriting." 
</P>
<P>
"People aren't working in a vacuum," said Mosakowski, "even though we're all 
busy with separate things. In a regular (production) setting, you usually don't 
go beyond the circle that you're working with till the play opens -- so you 
don't really get the dialogue till it's done. But while you're doing it is when 
you need it most. Having another playwright around at rehearsals, just talking 
about it with you, is terrific. Even if we're not talking about plays or 
writing or art, it's hovering in the air." 
</P>
<P>
The festival -- which will also include stagings of Epstein's "The Ordeal of 
Nancy Fergusson," Fornes' "Oscar and Martha" Julie Hebert's "Almost Asleep" and 
a new Steppling work -- will run July 20 through Aug. 6. A benefit featuring 
previous Padua Hills plays -- some with their original casts -- is scheduled 
for Sunday. In the lineup: Mednick's "Coyote 1," Leon Martell and Elizabeth 
Ruscio's "Hoss Drawin' " and O'Keefe's "The Magician" -- plus excerpts from 
Steppling's "Neck" and Fornes' "Fefu and Her Friends."

CRITIC AT LARGE: 'RIGHT THING' STARS: A NEW ERA FOR BLACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, Times Arts Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reinforcing the power of Spike Lee's "Do the Right Thing" as a sharp but 
compassionate commentary on racial relations during a long, hot Brooklyn summer 
day is a remarkable ensemble of superior performances. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Aiello as a proud, inflexible but fundamentally decent pizzeria owner, 
John Turturro as his hate-filled son and Lee himself as the pizza deliverer 
create individuals from what could have been only symbolic roles. 
</P>
<P>
And, investing the story with the dignity and the artistry -- and the sense of 
historical perspective -- their presence carries are Ossie Davis and his wife, 
Ruby Dee. 
</P>
<P>
She is the self-appointed matriarch of the extended street family (whose ties 
are ever more tenuous), watching it all from her open window in the airless 
summer heat, worrying, as Dee said during a recent interview, "about who may be 
falling through the cracks." 
</P>
<P>
He is the joshingly titled "mayor" of the street, a lame and lumbering figure 
of grave eloquence and world-worn wisdom in whom a defiant romanticism, aimed 
at Dee, survives on beer and small encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
Davis and Dee were in Los Angeles for the local premiere of "Do the Right 
Thing" last week, nicely ensconced in a hilltop luxury hotel. It was somewhat 
different from their first visit in 1947 when both came to town in the national 
company of "Anna Lucasta." 
</P>
<P>
"I stayed in a rooming house where Pullman porters disported themselves," Davis 
said, "and you lived in a private home." Dee nodded. Still it was a triumphant 
visit and Charlie Chaplin headed the list of stars who came backstage on 
opening night. 
</P>
<P>
The housing situation was not much improved a couple of years later when they 
returned to costar with Sidney Poitier in "No Way Out" at Fox. Married in 1948, 
they again lived privately. 
</P>
<P>
"There was only one hotel in Los Angeles where blacks were accommodated," Davis 
said. But things change, personified not in the least by Tom Bradley. "We 
thought Sam Yorty would be mayor forever." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years since, husband and wife have enjoyed eventful careers as 
performers, writers, producers and director and as activists in civil rights 
and other causes. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who had worked with Lee before in "School Daze," and Dee are both 
extremely pleased with and proud of "Do the Right Thing." They have had no 
fears, as were voiced after the film's showings at the Cannes festival, that it 
might stir racial disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
"When I read those stories," Davis says, "I half thought that Spike is such a 
consummate promoter he might have planted those notions himself. But he is much 
too responsible. He has a wonderful earnestness and he takes his role seriously 
as a leadership figure." 
</P>
<P>
"He believes deeply that things can change," Dee says. "The first function of 
art is to effect change. Later you can enjoy art for art's sake, perhaps. But 
nothing really exists in isolation, and artists are providers of directions for 
change." 
</P>
<P>
Davis traces the positive role of art in black life back to slave times. "As we 
were gathered in slave pens and other awful places, some slaves were picked out 
because they had the art of cooking or could sing and dance. Those who could 
entertain the masters became the voices for those of us in the cold and dark. 
The artists began to represent us in various ways from the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
What drew Davis and Dee to "Do the Right Thing" was, Dee says, "that it was 
nice to be reminded of the possibility of hope, at a time when we're on the 
verge of terrible cynicism. If you can't find hope in young people, then where? 
That's why Spike finds audiences in today's market. He can speak to the soul's 
anguish because he senses it." 
</P>
<P>
Davis says: "As in the Dylan Thomas poem, Spike is not one to go gently. He's 
raging against racism and sexism, too. He's come so far so fast he's ahead of 
himself. He senses and intuits things, his finger is on the pulse; he knows 
things he hasn't actually experienced himself." 
</P>
<P>
Lee has also, Davis and Dee feel, been the model of a responsible film maker. 
"He paid off his investors in his first film immediately, no juggling of the 
books, no messing about." (Their actor son was one of the investors.) 
</P>
<P>
On "Do the Right Thing" Lee bent and broke union rules to employ as many 
newcomers as he could, to break the Catch-22 that has bedeviled minorities in 
the film industry: no jobs without experience, but no experience without work. 
</P>
<P>
Davis himself was one of the architects of what looked to be a major opening-up 
of the industry. In 1970 he directed and co-authored "Cotton Comes to Harlem," 
which became the first major crossover film, so-called: a black-themed film 
with great appeal to the white audience. 
</P>
<P>
The success of "Cotton" led to a bandwagon of black films, which, however, 
degenerated to what became known as blacksploitation fare, finally unpalatable 
to either black or white audiences. The gains blacks had made on both sides of 
the camera came to a sudden halt. 
</P>
<P>
Only in more recent years, with the rise of Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy and now 
film makers like Robert Townsend and Lee himself, does the crossover audience 
appear to have been rediscovered by Hollywood. The significance of "Do the 
Right Thing" is that, in Davis's view, "It's even-handed," descriptive and 
compassionate, tragicomic, strong but not exploitative. 
</P>
<P>
"In his treatment of Sal (the Danny Aiello character) and his family, Spike 
wanted us to know about them as human beings," says Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Among the many black characters caught in cameo, three black men, watching the 
parade go by and caustically aware of their economic impotence, became a kind 
of slangy chorus, rendering their bitterness as bitter comedy. 
</P>
<P>
Lee has muted nothing, yet achieved an uncommon lyrical realism, harsh but 
chastening. "It will get people to talking and thinking," Dee says. "And 
feeling."

FOUR STUDIOS SLICE UP A $1.8-BILLION SUMMER PIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK MATHEWS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For studio executives at Orion, 20th Century Fox, Tri-Star and Universal, 
reading the weekly summer box office charts must produce that same sinking 
feeling people have when they're renting during a real estate boom. 
</P>
<P>
"Top 10 Sparklers Light B.O. Fire," the Daily Variety headline chirped 
Wednesday, over a story reporting the fall of yet another film industry record. 
</P>
<P>
"July 4 weekend b.o. sizzles; 'Bat' shatters $100 million mark," said the 
Hollywood Reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Box office analysts predict a $1.8-billion summer for Hollywood, a sublime 
figure for those who are in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount's two summer releases, "Star Trek V: The FinalFrontier" and "Indiana 
Jones and the Last Crusade," have brought in nearly $200 million since Memorial 
Day. The studio figures to get another fresh infusion of cash from the eighth 
entry in the "Friday the 13th" series when it opens next month. 
</P>
<P>
"Batman" soothed the wounds over at Warner Bros. in the wake of Clint 
Eastwood's disappointing "Pink Cadillac" and has pushed the studio's share of 
the summer receipts to more than $115 million. "Batman" has grossed about $10 
million a day since its June 25 opening, and this Friday, it will be joined in 
theaters by Warner Bros. stable-mate "Lethal Weapon II," one of the season's 
box office favorites. Those pre-summer rumors about top executives being asked 
to clean out their desks at Warners have vanished. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia, having endured the worst drought since Oklahoma dried up, has two 
hits in "Ghostbusters II" and "The Karate Kid III" and summer grosses of about 
$90 million. Later this month, the studio will release Rob Reiner's "When Harry 
Met Sally," a romantic comedy that has had early witnesses raving. This is all 
good news for second-year Columbia chief Dawn Steel, but in her private 
moments, when she lets herself imagine how well "Ghostbusters II" would have 
done during any other summer, she must curse the Caped Crusader. 
</P>
<P>
Disney didn't have any sure things on its summer schedule, other than the 
upcoming re-issue of the animated classic "Peter Pan," but it bolo-punched the 
competition with "Dead Poets Society" and "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" (they've 
combined for about $95 million in grosses) and still has a Tom Hanks picture, 
"Turner and Hootch," to come. 
</P>
<P>
There were no signs of let-up over the holiday weekend. July Fourth, with 
family activities and beach weather in competition for leisure time, is 
considered a "soft" weekend for movie exhibitors, but box office analysts said 
business was down only 6% between Friday and Sunday and set an industry record 
for the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
But only four studios have been sharing the wealth. Despite its high 
visibility, Orion's "Great Balls of Fire" had a very poor opening over the July 
Fourth weekend, averaging less than $3,000 at 1,417 theaters. The company's 
best chance now for a summer hit seems to Terry Jones' comedy-adventure "Eric 
the Viking," which opens August 4. 
</P>
<P>
Universal, which opened the summer weakly with "Renegades," got some good news 
with the limited release of Spike Lee's "Do the Right Thing," but that race 
relations drama seems an unlikely breakout commercial hit, and the studio's 
best hopes rest with Ron Howard's "Parenthood," starring Steve Martin (Aug. 2). 
</P>
<P>
Although it has done some summer business with the spring hold-over "See No 
Evil, Hear No Evil," Tri-Star won't really join the party until Aug. 4, when it 
opens the Sylvester Stallone prison drama "Lock-Up." Tri-Star has had few 
summer hits in its brief history and Stallone has provided most of them. 
"Lock-Up" will test both the staying power of Stallone and those Tri-Star 
executives who hope to survive the imminent merger with Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
There may be a lot of Rolaids being chomped at both MGM/UA and Fox, as 
executives at those companies prepare to send their big soldiers to battle. 
MGM/UA has the James Bond film "A Licence to Kill," No. 16 in the most 
successful film series in history, opening next weekend, and Fox has James 
Cameron's underwater science-fiction film "The Abyss," reportedly made at a 
cost of more than $50 million, opening Aug. 9.

BEVERLY HILLS HIGH WON'T BE RAZED IN FAVOR OF A HIGH-RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Historic Beverly Hills High School has survived a controversial proposal that 
would have torn it down to make way for a high-rise development to raise money 
for the school district. 
</P>
<P>
The Beverly Hills Board of Education decided that razing the school would be 
too disruptive and entailed too many "unanswered questions," such as "traffic, 
tradition and maintaining open space," board member Fred Stern said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The board will continue to explore other ways to generate money for the 
district, which has a $27.6-million budget this fiscal year and projects an 
annual shortfall of about $1 million over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, the district would have demolished the high school, which 
sits on a 27-acre site at the southwestern edge of Beverly Hills, near Century 
City. A modern, more compact high school then would have been built on the 
northern 19 acres of the site, and the remaining land, at Olympic Boulevard and 
Spalding Drive, would have been leased to a developer to construct an office 
and condominium complex. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strong Opposition 
</P>
<P>
The district's real estate committee said the district could generate $8 
million to $18 million a year from such a development, depending on its size. 
It noted that to implement the plan, the district would have to find a way for 
the high school to operate during the construction. 
</P>
<P>
Committee chairman Ken Goldman said Wednesday that "neither I nor any other 
member of the committee wants to put commercial buildings on school property. 
If the budget deficits can be financed another way, this should be a last 
resort. . . . It looks as if we don't have to take the more radical steps." 
</P>
<P>
Stern, a 1951 graduate of the 60-year-old high school, said he opposed the 
project because of the traffic it would have generated on Olympic Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal had meet with strong opposition from the public after it was 
introduced in March by the real estate committee. At a board meeting June 14, 
parents presented petitions with 450 signatures opposing redevelopment of the 
high school site. 
</P>
<P>
The board will examine two other money-raising ideas. One is to raze the 
district offices on Lasky Drive and lease the land for development of 
apartments or condominiums, which would bring in $500,000 to $720,000 a year to 
the district, Goldman said. The district offices might be moved to the high 
school, or the district might rent space elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Another proposal is to lease the site of the teachers' parking lot at Beverly 
Vista Elementary School on Elm Drive for a four-story apartment building, 
condo, or retirement home, Goldman said. An underground garage would be built 
for the teachers and the residents. The district would earn $250,000 to 
$500,000 a year, he said.

VIET REFUGEES REUNITED THROUGH PHOTOGRAPH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Quang Giap, any hope of seeing his parents and eight brothers and sisters 
again seemed to have vanished the night of April 29, 1975, as Communist forces 
took over Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
That night, Giap, a second lieutenant in the South Vietnamese Special Forces, 
joined thousands of other soldiers who fled their homeland, afraid of being 
imprisoned or executed for fighting alongside the Americans. His family stayed 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
Giap spent two months in Guam and eventually settled in Canoga Park. His 
letters home went unanswered, and with each passing year, the possibility that 
his relatives had survived the bloodshed in Saigon seemed to him to become ever 
more remote. 
</P>
<P>
Then, leafing through The Times in June last year, he spotted a familiar face. 
</P>
<P>
"First, I didn't believe it," Giap, now 42, recalled recently. "I thought I was 
looking at something else and I looked at it again, and I said, 'That's my 
sister!' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shown in Refugee Camp 
</P>
<P>
His sister, Giap Thi Ly, was pictured with two of her sons in a photo 
accompanying an article about a refugee center in the Philippines. The sister, 
who had been married to an American civilian living in South Vietnam during the 
war, left Vietnam with her six children under an agreement that allows 
Amerasian children and their relatives to emigrate. 
</P>
<P>
Giap, who was taking a break at his former job at a Chatsworth machine shop 
when he saw the photo, told his boss of the discovery. The boss called The 
Times and was told that Giap should call the newspaper's Manila bureau. 
</P>
<P>
After several unsuccessful attempts, Giap contacted reporter Mark Fineman, then 
The Times' Manila correspondent, who relayed Giap's address and phone number to 
the man's sister at the refugee camp. 
</P>
<P>
The letter Giap got from his sister several weeks later ended 13 years of 
silence. His family in Vietnam was alive and well, the letter said. She also 
said she and her children were planning to move to the United States in the 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
A year after Giap Thi Ly stepped off an airplane at Los Angeles International 
Airport to join her brother in the United States, the 45-year-old homemaker 
this week celebrated her first Fourth of July, including the fireworks show at 
Pierce College in Woodland Hills. It was a celebration not only of new-found 
freedom, but also of new responsibilities and challenges in an alien land. 
</P>
<P>
Her children have more opportunities here, she said, but she misses her 
Vietnamese second husband and the other family members that she left behind. 
</P>
<P>
"My children can do what they want to do," she said, her English still heavily 
accented. "In Vietnam, it's very hard. You do too much work for nothing. But 
it's very difficult for me. I don't know how to write English, I don't know 
what streets to go to." 
</P>
<P>
Giap Thi Ly lives with her four youngest children in an apartment on Cohasset 
Street in Canoga Park, only a few blocks from her brother's home. Her two 
eldest sons work at a Chatsworth electronics firm and live with her brother. 
She too wants a job, but she said it will take more months of English 
instruction at a local occupational center before her language skills are good 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
The most difficult part of moving to the United States, she said, was giving up 
many of the close family ties that provided strength in times of need. 
</P>
<P>
She lived with her parents, two brothers, two sisters, her husband and children 
in an apartment in Saigon. "My big family, we all lived together," she said. 
"Everyday, I saw them. It makes me very sad." 
</P>
<P>
She said her husband, a Saigon bus driver, has applied to emigrate, but so far, 
the government has not granted his request. 
</P>
<P>
Giap, for his part, said he had no choice but to emigrate. Nor does he have any 
regrets, for life in the United States has been good to him: He married a 
fellow Vietnamese refugee shortly after immigrating and has three sons. A 
successful computer programmer with a Van Nuys aerospace firm, he lives with 
his family in a comfortable home on Laramie Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Although his parents and siblings still live thousands of miles away, forbidden 
by the Hanoi government to leave Vietnam, Giap said regular correspondence with 
them has replaced years of silence, thanks to the chance discovery of his 
sister's picture in a newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"My whole family, they are healthy," he said. "My brothers and sisters, they 
are all married and have families and are doing real well."

MAKING THE DIFFERENCE; 
</P>
<P>
CENTURY CLUB HAS GOOD TIME GIVING AWAY MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unrestrained by any formal rules of order, the Long Beach Century Club conducts 
its Tuesday night meetings in a jocular air. The members, mostly middle aged, 
like to call for drinks, tease the waitress and await the raffle drawing. 
</P>
<P>
"Informal . . . very low-key . . . we give away money to kids," attorney Don 
Dyer, a past president, had said before a recent meeting at the Park Place 
Restaurant. He was describing the club, which, amid the fun, works enough to 
carry out its commitment to help thousands of young Long Beach amateur 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Shrum, a Special Olympics coach, explained at the meeting how the club 
helped enable a junior high school student, who soon will have a steel rod 
inserted in her spine and may have to quit athletics, to compete in a recent 
Special Olympics track meet. Club donations had been used to buy track 
uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
"You guys are making a big difference in this little girl's life," Shrum told 
the members. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Begun in 1957 
</P>
<P>
The Century Club was formed as a nonprofit corporation in 1957 to promote 
amateur athletics. It was founded by men who met regularly to play cards and 
talk about sports at the old Apple Valley Inn steakhouse in downtown Long 
Beach. The idea was to have 100 members each paying annual dues of $100. 
</P>
<P>
Dues have remained the same, but there are close to 150 members now. Among them 
are lawyers, bankers, businessmen, coaches, police officers, an FBI agent and 
athletes the club once honored, such as former baseball star Bobby Grich. Only 
two members are female -- tennis great Billie Jean King and Ernie Pollman, a 
longtime Cal State Long Beach booster. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone once said it's a whole bunch of has-beens honoring a whole bunch of 
will-be's," Dyer joked. 
</P>
<P>
According to president-elect Keith Cordes, the club raises $30,000 to $40,000 
each year. It provides scholarships to CSULB, grants to Long Beach City College 
and supports and honors champion teams and individuals from junior high 
schools, high schools and colleges. It also gives $1,000 each year to the Long 
Beach Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
And the club enables athletes to travel -- it helped pay for King's first two 
trips to Wimbledon. "We've sent them all over the world to make sure they have 
a chance to compete," Dyer said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hall of Fame 
</P>
<P>
An Athlete of the Year is announced at the club's annual Sports Night banquet, 
which draws more than 700 people. And the club annually adds members to its 
Hall of Fame, which includes diving's Pat McCormick, baseball's Bob Lemon, 
football's Gene Washington and legendary umpire Beans Reardon. 
</P>
<P>
A high school athlete is honored each month; the club invites the athlete and 
his or her coach and parents as dinner guests. 
</P>
<P>
The main fund-raisers -- long gone are the days when the club had to ask the 
City Council for help -- are a spring golf tournament and a fall coaching 
clinic. Last year, Chuck Knox and John Robinson were the guest speakers. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a good time doing what we do," Cordes said. He said meeting nights are 
"pretty free-wheeling with no Roberts Rules of Order. Most of the agenda is 
written on envelopes 10 minutes before the meeting starts." 
</P>
<P>
The consensus, though, is that things were a bit wilder in the club's early 
days. 
</P>
<P>
Al Larson, a retired Long Beach Press-Telegram sportswriter, said the meetings 
would last from 6 p.m. until 2 a.m. "A lot of the wives never knew the meetings 
ended at 7," Larson said. "It was always on the minutes that they adjourned at 
2 a.m." 
</P>
<P>
John Queen, 76, the oldest member, said the club "has more fun and does more 
good. I've never seen a kid turned down who came to the club and said he 
couldn't afford to go to, say, a track meet in New Jersey." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Severson, Long Beach real estate broker and former pro football player 
with the St. Louis Cardinals and Washington Redskins, recalled being honored by 
the club in 1969 when he played at Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"The nicest award you can get is to receive one by local fans and friends," 
Severson said. "For a young man, that made quite an impression to see guys at 
the head table like Bob Lemon, John McKay and Johnny Olszewski, who you grew up 
idolizing. All of a sudden you are meeting someone your parents might have 
bought a car or insurance from, and it's something to have them come up to you 
and say, 'Hi, Jeff Severson, you had a great year.' " 
</P>
<P>
Severson also found that the club was a good springboard for getting exposure 
to the business world. 
</P>
<P>
Criticisms of the club, according to Dyer, are rare. "We give away money, so 
it's hard to criticize us," he said. "We give away everything we take in." 
</P>
<P>
Objections usually come from people who think the club overlooked someone for 
the Hall of Fame. "I was critical at one time because USC and UCLA people were 
at the head table and Long Beach people were not," Dyer said. "That's since 
been changed. They're all up there now." 
</P>
<P>
Dyer looked over the list of Hall of Fame members and athletes of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to compare it with any city," he said. "Our kids go everywhere so we 
tend to forget they're all Long Beach. You put them all together and we'll go 
against L.A. or anybody." 
</P>
<P>

REBEL ON A ROLL; 
</P>
<P>
OUTLAW SKATEBOARD PRO TURNS HIS PAVEMENT PASSION INTO ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Doug Boyce is a skateboard outlaw. 
</P>
<P>
For years he has been skateboarding the streets of Long Beach. And for years 
the police have been chasing him to give him tickets for violating local 
anti-skateboarding ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
It happens so often that it has become almost a game with him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm starting to get a kick out of it," said Boyce, 19. "I like running from 
the cops to see if I can make it. I'm into rebel sports." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mounted on Canvas 
</P>
<P>
He is not, however, a rebel without a cause. A classic California product with 
long blond hair and a deep tan, Boyce is a professional skater who makes a 
living demonstrating his skills throughout the world on skateboards and roller 
blades, those streamlined skates with four wheels mounted in a line. And 
recently he has been turning his skateboarding experience into an unusual art 
form featuring used boards mounted on brightly painted canvases. The work 
already has received some attention at a local gallery. 
</P>
<P>
But his most passionate responses are evoked by discussions of skateboarding on 
the streets of his hometown, where he has been riding regularly since he was 7. 
</P>
<P>
"If the city won't let us skate on the sidewalk, then they need to find us 
another place to skate," said Boyce, brushing the hair out of his eyes. 
"Skateboarding gives you the ultimate freedom feeling; you crave it. There 
can't be a crime in skateboarding. They can't keep banning us." 
</P>
<P>
Some of his recent art, in fact, explores the "outlaw" nature of his chosen 
sport. One piece, called "Across the Line," features a skateboard rolling 
across what appears to be a highway center dividing line. "A skateboarder will 
never walk when he can roll," Boyce said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Barbed Wire 
</P>
<P>
And a work-in-progress called "Caught Between the Boundaries" uses barbed wire 
to depict the dilemma facing local skateboarders who, according to Boyce, must 
often climb fences to skate in restricted areas such as flood control channels 
because few legal areas are available. "They don't really read no-trespassing 
signs," he said of his fellow skateboarders. "They think of skating before 
(they think of) getting busted." 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach police say the anti-skateboarding ordinances protect pedestrians, 
motorists and skateboarders from injuries resulting when boards go out of 
control. Although skateboarding is not outlawed on all city streets, said 
Charles Parks, Long Beach Police Department commander in charge of traffic 
enforcement, it is banned in many areas where residents have specifically 
requested such protection. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a lot of injuries," Parks said, explaining that the push for 
neighborhood anti-skating ordinances began in the mid-1970s when skateboarding 
was at its height of popularity. Back then, he said, skateboarding "was a 
traffic hazard -- it was quite a nuisance." Although the ensuing years have 
seen a decline in the number of skateboarders, Parks said, he has noticed a 
recent resurgence of interest in the sport. "Skateboards appear to be surfacing 
again," he said. "Lately I've seen a lot more in the street. They are very 
dangerous to young children and unskilled riders." 
</P>
<P>
Violation of posted skateboarding prohibitions, officials say, is a traffic 
infraction punishable by a fine of up to $235. 
</P>
<P>
That has not discouraged Boyce from skateboarding. In fact, it has fueled the 
anti-Establishment art that he produces in an attic studio at the Naples home 
he shares with his parents. He works on the art objects between trips to 
Hawaii, Tahiti or Las Vegas, where manufacturers and commercial sponsors pay 
him to display his stunt-skating skills in demonstrations of their 
skate-related products. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Return to College 
</P>
<P>
Boyce says he would like to make his living someday as a professional artist on 
the order of Andy Warhol. If that does not work out, however, the young man -- 
who graduated in 1987 from Laguna Beach High School -- says he is prepared to 
return to Cypress College, where he has studied to work as a psychiatric 
technician. 
</P>
<P>
That may not be necessary. A recent exhibition of his artwork at Original 
Gallery Designs in Belmont Heights drew an estimated 800 viewers and an offer 
of $2,300 for one piece. "Everyone was very pleased with his work," said 
gallery owner Nancy E. Hayes. "The colors were so bright you could see them 
from the street." 
</P>
<P>
When not otherwise occupied, it is the street to which he returns, despite the 
opposition of local police. In recent years, Boyce says, he has been forced to 
pay five fines ranging from $25 to $50 for skateboarding illegally down 2nd 
Street, a crowded pedestrian walkway in nearby Belmont Shore. He would have 
been cited several more times, he said, had the police been able to catch him. 
</P>
<P>
During the recent Long Beach Marathon, Boyce boasts, he skated nearly the 
entire course, passing up 12 frustrated policemen before one was finally able 
to stop him. And after being questioned during another recent skateboard 
outing, Boyce said, he gave a phony name. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Small Price to Pay 
</P>
<P>
Parks said he had never heard of Boyce and was unaware of any major problems 
associated with enforcing anti-skateboarding ordinances. "Unless somebody 
complains," he said, "we generally don't really do much about it." 
</P>
<P>
Boyce says his run-ins with the law are a small price to pay for the simple 
thrill of the glide. "It's a freedom sport," he said. "Gliding on concrete, you 
feel like rolling thunder. It's a very ultimate feeling." 
</P>
<P>
During a recent trip to the concrete expanses of the sidewalks near Belmont 
Plaza Pool, one of the city's legal skating areas, the young athlete inspired a 
crowd of peers to put down their skateboards and watch wide-eyed as he went 
through his paces. Those paces included "G-turns" during which he rode on the 
front two wheels of his board; "grinders" featuring noisy brushes against 
convenient concrete obstructions; and "rail rides" involving riding crossways 
down a raised concrete divider leaving a long scratch caused by the friction of 
wood against cement. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone was impressed in the same way. 
</P>
<P>
"That kid's going to break his neck someday," said one passer-by, who later 
identified himself as a retired schoolteacher. "It makes my blood run cold."

HOUSE-PAINTING HELPS THEM, NEIGHBORHOOD; 
</P>
<P>
TEENS BRUSH UP ON IMPROVEMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents in Inglewood's Centinela Heights neighborhood are no longer alarmed 
when they see a gang of teen-agers applying paint to a house. In fact, they are 
now signing up for the privilege of having it done to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Teen-agers are working to spruce up the residential neighborhood next to the 
Hyde Park area of Los Angeles in the experimental program designed to steer 
young people away from the lure of the streets. By painting the houses of 
low-income residents and senior citizens, organizers say, the young 
participants are learning a marketable craft, taking in some spending money and 
even polishing the tarnished reputations that they carry among those a 
generation or two older. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Right Direction' 
</P>
<P>
Mixing, priming and painting techniques are just the beginning, said 
coordinator Mercedes Tudy of Inglewood Neighborhood Housing Services Inc. "It's 
more than just an employment program," she said. "We try to work with the whole 
person. I think a lot of the kids have the right ingredients. We try to point 
them in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
The job program concept originated in a neighborhood group in Salt Lake City, 
where disadvantaged young people were organized several years ago to improve 
their community. The Neighborhood Reinvestment Corp., a national group that 
funds community revitalization projects, chose Inglewood last year for a 
similar job program that will serve as a model for tough urban environments. 
</P>
<P>
"In Salt Lake City, the problem kids were involved in school truancy, joy 
riding, drinking and maybe some petty theft," said Cris Mojica-Gomez, the 
Southern California manager for Neighborhood Reinvestment. "In a place like 
Inglewood you're dealing with crack dealing and gangs. The kids have a harder 
edge to them." 
</P>
<P>
In the Inglewood program, the dozen participants are required to attend 
counseling sessions to plan their futures. They learn to speak in public and 
maintain a neat appearance. They must master such job hunting basics as resumes 
and applications, and such abstractions as responsibility and dedication. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Now I Have Goals' 
</P>
<P>
"When I started, I was lost, just hanging around," said Jose Garcia, a shy 
18-year-old who became the program's first graduate this week. "Now I have 
goals. I just want to do enough so people will say, 'Jose is something.' " 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, who also graduated from Inglewood High School last month, has accepted 
a carpenter's apprentice position with an Anaheim construction firm. His goals 
include attending trade school, learning more English, and earning enough money 
to help out his mother and four sisters. 
</P>
<P>
Once he makes it, Garcia envisions himself helping others to straighten out 
their lives. "I want to teach other people that life is something, not just 
hanging around." 
</P>
<P>
Another painter, Jermaine Cooley, 18, said after a painting session this week 
that he isn't the same person he was two months ago when he first signed up for 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
"My friends see a change in me," said Cooley, a graduate of the Inglewood 
Community Day Center, an alternative high school. "It's making me see that I 
can do more than just hang out on the streets. It's helping me to get my 
responsibilities together. Right now I'd be at home doing nothing with the 
buddies." 
</P>
<P>
Participants acknowledge that painting a house is not for everyone. Arriving at 
work on time is a requirement. Teamwork is key. Many of those who sign up later 
drop out and drift away. 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell people that this is a good program," Cooley said, "but some people 
can't hang with it." 
</P>
<P>
Victor Peres, the on-site coordinator, said he took a hefty pay cut from his 
regular construction work to train the teen-agers. He considers the work a 
repayment to those who helped him turn his life around when he was growing up. 
</P>
<P>
"I was young once too," Peres said, showing the scar from a bullet wound he 
received in the abdomen during his wilder days. "I can relate to them. . . . 
I'm trying to change the world for them a little bit. That's all we can do." 
</P>
<P>
Iola Reeser, a Wexham Way resident who says she hasn't always spoken in glowing 
terms about today's young people, was beaming as she showed off her newly 
painted bright yellow home last week. 
</P>
<P>
She gave the teen-agers the ultimate compliment: "These kids did a better job 
than the professional painters who did it the first time."

SCHULLER HIRES GO-BETWEEN FOR NORTH, CONTRAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert W. Owen, a private citizen who testified in the Iran-Contra hearings 
that he served as a courier of money between former White House aide Lt. Col. 
Oliver L. North and the Contras, has been hired as a fund-raiser for the 
Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Robert H. Schuller named Owen, 35, to be assistant to the director of 
development, according to Owen's new boss, development director Chester Tolson. 
</P>
<P>
While precise details of Owen's new job still are being worked out, Owen 
basically will work in the church's development department, helping raise money 
for the ministry, which has seen donations drop in recent years in the wake of 
highly publicized scandals involving other television ministries, Tolson said. 
Owen will begin work Aug. 15, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Owen revealed his plans to television reporters Wednesday morning when he was 
being asked about the sentencing of his former boss, North. 
</P>
<P>
Owen said he would have preferred that the announcement come from Schuller 
himself and be disassociated from his past. "I want it to be made as clear as 
can be: When I leave Washington, I leave my politics behind me. I'm going to 
work for a church and a man I have the deepest respect for," he said in a 
telephone interview from his home in Washington. He said he is a strong 
believer in Schuller's positive messages of "turning your scars into stars." 
</P>
<P>
Tolson said neither he nor Schuller were concerned with Owen's relationship to 
North. "I never once discussed Ollie North or anything he had done. We were 
interested in what he (Owen) could do for us in the area of fund-raising," 
Tolson said. "The fact of his previous employment with Ollie North was not the 
thing that caught our attention about him. He's a man of enormous experience 
and ability. We're quite excited about having him come aboard." 
</P>
<P>
A member of a Washington Episcopal congregation, Owen said he met Schuller last 
year after sending him an admiring letter asking him to baptize his newborn 
daughter. "I had been a follower of his 'Hour of Power' program. He was a 
tremendous help to me during difficult times. We wanted him to baptize our 
daughter, if possible." 
</P>
<P>
Schuller subsequently baptized the child in Owen's home, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Owen testified during North's trial that he had made many trips in 1985 and 
1986 -- the period when Congress banned U.S. military aid to the Nicaraguan 
rebels -- between Washington and Central America carrying maps and money, as 
well as tactical military advice from North. 
</P>
<P>
Owen has referred to North as "my godfather" and signed his messages to North 
at the National Security Council with the code name "T.C.," meaning "the 
courier." 
</P>
<P>
For a year, he said, he received a $2,500-a-month salary in traveler's checks 
in Contra funds, paid by one of the rebel leaders. And he acknowledged that in 
1985, North gave him $1,000 in Contra money as a wedding present. 
</P>
<P>
Owen testified that he often represented North at meetings in Central America 
with Contra leader Adolfo Calero because North wanted to keep a low profile. 
</P>
<P>
Owen and retired Army Maj. Gen. John K. Singlaub testified that they had 
repeated contacts with North to raise private funds and channel military 
equipment to the Contras. North has denied that he had been working with them 
to raise private money for the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Owen said he never raised private funds for the Contras. "Development will be a 
whole new area for me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Owen testified under a grant of limited immunity. Conservatives and some 
liberals praised his speeches before the House and Senate committees on the 
Iran-Contra scandal. Rep. Lee Hamilton (D-Ind.) chairman of the House 
committee, noted that "all of us . . . respect your conviction and your 
sincerity and your dedication." 
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of his testimony, Owen read a poem to North and concluded: "I 
love Ollie North like a brother." Owen's own brother, Dwight, a U.S. foreign 
aid official, was killed in Vietnam in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
Owen said Wednesday that he did "nothing I'm ashamed of" and still believes his 
role was morally and legally proper and in the best interests of the country, 
although he added that he would be "reflecting" on it for many years to come. 
</P>
<P>
"None of us ever thought it would go on 2 1/2 years and grow into this. There 
is no question North was not a lone cowboy," he said. "He was following out 
what was expected of him." 
</P>
<P>
Owen said his testimony was "misconstrued" by some to imply that President 
Reagan had approved of North's actions. In fact, North referred only vaguely to 
"superiors" who knew of and approved of his work, Owen said. 
</P>
<P>
About the suspended sentence and fine handed North on Wednesday, Owen said: 
"The sentence Ollie 
</P>
<P>
was given was one I would have been pleased with if I were him -- not having to 
serve time in jail. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"In May, 1984, when I first started working with Ollie, he said he would be the 
designated fall guy if things went bad. No one realized how far things would 
fall." 
</P>
<P>
Owen's role in the Iran-Contra affair was not a factor in the decision to hire 
him, both Tolson and Owen said. 
</P>
<P>
Schuller "knows what I was about," Owen said. "It was never an issue. That's 
one of the things I liked about him. He's made a point of staying away from 
politics." 
</P>
<P>
Tolson noted that no charges were ever filed against Owen, and "so there was 
nothing there we needed to consider as heavy baggage." 
</P>
<P>
Owen, a graduate of Stanford University, worked in private schools, including 
The Brentwood School in West Los Angeles, as director of admissions. After 
moving to Washington, he worked as a staff member for the Senate Republican 
Conference, was an aide to Vice President Dan Quayle while the latter was a 
senator from Indiana, and was employed by the public relations firm Gray &amp; 
Co. He quit that job to volunteer for the Contras with North. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Owen obtained a contract with the State Department to provide medical 
aid to war-weary Nicaraguans. At the same time, he continued to work for North, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Owen has contributed to Schuller's "Hour of Power" television program for "many 
years," Tolson said, adding that he belongs to the Eagle Club.

O.C. FIRES TIED TO FIREWORKS; 40 HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BEENE and TED JOHNSON, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A series of fires apparently touched off by the deadly combination of illegal 
fireworks and wood-shingle roofs swept through Orange County on Wednesday, 
leaving 40 people homeless in an Anaheim apartment complex while destroying one 
residence and damaging a second in separate blazes in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
In all three cases, officials said the fires were apparently triggered by 
youngsters setting off fireworks in post-Independence Day revelry. And in each 
case, the structures that caught fire had shake or shingle roofs that were 
already hot from blistering temperatures that had settled across the Southland 
during the holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported in any of the fires, but firefighters renewed their 
call for people to refrain from using illegal fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
Two brush fires, one off Carbon Canyon Road near Brea and the other in southern 
Orange County near Coto de Caza, were also reported Wednesday. But officials 
said they have no evidence that these were caused by fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
In the most serious case, fire swept through the two-story De Anza Plaza 
apartment complex in Anaheim shortly after 11 a.m., gutting 12 units and 
collapsing part of the roof before firefighters brought the blaze under 
control. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Burke, an Anaheim city spokeswoman, said the blaze apparently started 
after two boys and a girl, all under age 12, shot off a bottle rocket that fell 
to the roof. The shake roof, already hot from the sun, erupted into flames that 
eventually caused an estimated $280,000 in damage. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Red Cross said 11 families, about 40 people in all, were 
forced out of their homes and are being put up in motels. Another family was 
relocated to a vacant apartment in the same complex. 
</P>
<P>
The children who started the fire were questioned by fire investigators and 
will be questioned again later this week, Burke said. She said that the 
children all live in the neighborhood and that the fireworks were apparently 
bought in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"If charges are filed, they would be filed against the children, but I'm not 
sure that will happen," she said. "I think a stern talking-to will take care of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
David Weingartner, manager of the apartments, said he saw the children lighting 
the fireworks in front of the building and told them to stop. Just 10 minutes 
later, he said, he was advised that part of the roof was on fire. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the fire and it was scorching," Weingartner said. "I looked up on the 
roof, and I said, 'I won't be able to stop this.' I thought that by the time I 
got to calling the Fire Department, the roof of the building might have caved 
in. 
</P>
<P>
"It just came to me, 'Get the people out, and then call the Fire Department.' 
It was instinct." 
</P>
<P>
Weingartner said he then ran door to door, pounding and yelling to tell the 
tenants to leave the building for their own safety. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Sandobal, 23, was inside her apartment when children banged on her door 
to alert her. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the fire when it barely started," she said. "I didn't know what to do, 
and then the whole thing started (moving) really fast." 
</P>
<P>
A short time after the Anaheim fire broke out, two blazes were reported at 
homes in Orange, again apparently caused by fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
The worst, at a single-story home in the 1400 block of Cabrillo Street in 
Orange Park Acres, destroyed the home of Tom and Martha Holler, who had left 
earlier in the day for a vacation of golfing in Atlanta. Their two sons were 
not home. 
</P>
<P>
According to Fire Capt. Ray Montoya, an Orange battalion chief, a suspected 
bottle rocket landed on the roof of the Holler home about noon and the roof 
immediately caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
"It spread very quickly because the roof was so hot," Montoya said. "Especially 
this time of year, when the roofs are preheated to well over 110 degrees just 
because of exposure during hot days, fires can get out of control. It doesn't 
take much to get them to the point where they burn." 
</P>
<P>
Montoya said the city has a limited ban on new buildings with roofs made out of 
wood, unless the roofs are pressure-treated with fire retardant. However, this 
new ordinance applies only in areas within 500 feet of open space where brush 
is growing. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya said the Hollers recently had roof work done and had it treated with 
some form of fire retardant, although it was apparently not pressure-treated. 
</P>
<P>
By the time firefighters arrived, a large plume of smoke had billowed over the 
neighborhood. More fire units were called to help control the blaze, Montoya 
said. 
</P>
<P>
By the time it was brought under control, the roof had collapsed, and the home 
was declared a total loss. 
</P>
<P>
Damage for the home and property was estimated at $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya said neighbors heard fireworks popping and crackling minutes before the 
fire started. He said investigators are looking for youths who were apparently 
playing with fireworks in the area. 
</P>
<P>
About the same time in another part of Orange, another shake roof caught fire 
on South Shattuck Place, again the result of illegal fireworks. But 
firefighters put that fire out before it spread. Damage was estimated at 
$4,000. 
</P>
<P>
"People think the worst is over after July 4, but the day after the holiday 
there are always problems," Montoya said. "It's always a surprise the day 
after." 
</P>
<P>
The Carbon Canyon brush fire burned just over an acre near Carbon Canyon 
Regional Park in the early afternoon. A Brea fire spokesman said it took just 
minutes to bring it under control. 
</P>
<P>
The Coto de Caza blaze, which broke out in brush just south of Via Colinas on 
the south side of the development at about 2 p.m., was a bit larger, but it too 
was brought under control quickly before it could spread to the homes in the 
area, county fire officials said.

The Soviet legislature rejected the government's nominee to head the state 
railway system, the second incumbent minister to be given the boot in as many 
days. The Supreme Soviet approved four government appointees but blocked the 
nomination of Nikolai S. Konarev, railroad boss since 1982, a day after 
throwing out the nation's chief of foreign trade. By a vote of 204 to 130, with 
40 abstentions, deputies rejected Konarev, 62, after criticism of the rail 
system's safety record and passenger services, the official Tass news agency 
said. On Tuesday, the Supreme Soviet voted down the nomination of Vladimir M. 
Kamentsev, 61, who had directed foreign trade since it was revamped by Kremlin 
chief Mikhail S. Gorbachev in 1987.

The California Highway Patrol reported 78 traffic deaths over the long Fourth 
of July weekend. Officers also made 2,857 arrests for driving while 
intoxicated. Of the traffic deaths reported in CHP jurisdictions, 49 victims 
were not wearing seat belts. The holiday period for this year's Independence 
Day weekend lasted 4 1/2 days, and is not comparable to the 3 1/2 days for 
1988, the CHP noted. The last comparable period was in 1985, when 71 motorists 
were killed.

A follow-up checkup found former President Ronald Reagan in excellent condition 
after suffering slight bruises when he was thrown from a horse at a friend's 
Mexican ranch, a spokeswoman at Ft. Huachuca in Arizona said. Base spokeswoman 
Margaret Liebchen said Dr. Juan Lopez, the Army doctor who treated Reagan after 
the fall Tuesday, went by helicopter to Mexico to conduct the checkup as Reagan 
had decided to continue his vacation at friend William Wilson's ranch, where he 
planned to celebrate his wife Nancy's birthday today. Wire services had 
erroneously reported that Reagan was hurt during a hunting accident. The former 
President was injured when his horse began bucking wildly on a rocky downhill 
slope and stumbled.

REPUTED DRUG CARTEL MEMBER ARRAIGNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The reputed No. 3 man in Colombia's Cali drug cartel was arraigned in a Miami 
prison under tight security for fear fellow cocaine traffickers might try to 
free him, federal officials said. The Cali cartel -- a rival to the 
better-known Medellin cocaine cartel -- operates out of the city of Cali and 
has grabbed a growing share of Colombia's drug trade, Drug Enforcement 
Administration officials said. Luis Santacruz Echeverri, 35, was arraigned by 
U.S. Magistrate Samuel Smargon in a prison administrative office at the federal 
Metropolitan Correctional Center. Santacruz was indicted June 14 on 14 counts 
of cocaine possession and distribution in the seizure in July, 1987, of 2 1/2 
tons of cocaine. Santacruz pleaded innocent at the arraignment. No trial date 
has been set.

Joseph Gallo is seeking a new trial in the bitter trademark-infringement case 
he recently lost to his older brothers, wine makers Ernest and Julio Gallo. In 
a motion filed in U.S. District Court in Fresno, Joseph Gallo's attorneys said 
U.S. District Judge Robert E. Coyle appeared to have been prejudiced in favor 
of Ernest and Julio Gallo because they were represented by the judge's former 
law firm. One member of that firm, Oliver Wanger, belittled the request for a 
new trial, saying that Joseph Gallo's lawyers specifically asked Coyle to hear 
the case, even though his past ties to the firm were well known.

Despite $71 million in U.S. aid since 1978 for a low-income housing project in 
Egypt, it was not until this year that families were able to benefit, according 
to a report by the Agency for International Development. In the report, 
submitted to Congress, AID Inspector General Herbert L. Beckington complained 
about U.S. aid operations as a whole in Egypt, which gets $2.3 billion a year. 
He cited the project near Cairo -- still under construction -- as an example. 
When the project began, the cost was to be shared equally, but by March, 1988, 
the United States had spent $71 million and Egypt $63 million -- and not one 
family had moved in. AID spokesman John Riddle said that since the report was 
written, 205 families have moved in.

DIFFERENT LAWS ON WOOD SHAKE, FIRE RETARDANTS CRISSCROSS O.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Fires that damaged three dwellings in Orange County on Wednesday illustrate not 
only the danger of wood-shake roofs, fire authorities said, but also the 
patchwork nature of laws governing shake roofs in the county. 
</P>
<P>
An Anaheim apartment building, where illegal fireworks sparked a fire in its 
wood-shake roof and displaced 12 families, was built before a 1982 city 
ordinance requiring newly built wood roofs to be fire retardant. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange, where two fires ignited in wood-shake roofs, there is no general 
ordinance requiring that shake roofs be fire retardant. One of the fires, 
however, occurred at a home where a new fire-treated wood-shake roof recently 
had been installed -- apparently having littleeffect in preventing the spread 
of the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
The fires came on the same day that the Los Angeles City Council gave tentative 
approval to a measure that would ban wood-shake roofs, whether treated or 
untreated, citywide. If given final approval next week, Los Angeles would 
become the first major city in the country to outlaw the popular roofing 
material, which many fire officials say is hazardous. (Story on Page 6.) 
</P>
<P>
"I think the (Los Angeles) ordinance is great," said Gail McCloud, Anaheim's 
deputy fire marshal. 
</P>
<P>
But McCloud said Anaheim fire officials would not press for a similar law 
unless supported by the Anaheim City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fire Department is always for things that lessen the possibility of fire 
damage and destruction. If the City Council felt that it were something that 
needed to be addressed, we would address it," McCloud said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, most fire officials recommend that, at a minimum, wood roofs be fire 
retardant. Most would go further and push for a Los Angeles-style total ban on 
wood-shake roofs, McCloud said. 
</P>
<P>
But political reality often intervenes, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"Ideally, (the City Council) would ban" wood roofs, said Capt. Ray Montoya, a 
battalion chief with the Orange Fire Department. "But they are balancing 
(concerns) of the developers and the business community with what they think is 
a level of protection for the property owner and resident." 
</P>
<P>
Several cities in the county, including Santa Ana and Newport Beach, have 
adopted ordinances similar to that in Anaheim, requiring that wood roofs be 
fire retardant or non-combustible. 
</P>
<P>
Other cities such as Orange, Brea and Laguna Beach require only that homes in 
certain designated areas -- usually those close to brushland -- have wood roofs 
treated with a fire retardant. 
</P>
<P>
In unincorporated county territory, fire codes now require that all wood roofs 
be fire retardant, said Capt. Ken Crispin, an engineer with the Orange County 
Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
But fire officials caution that a wood-shake or shingle roof treated with a 
fire retardant is not necessarily fireproof, as was demonstrated in the Orange 
blaze that destroyed a $300,000 home. 
</P>
<P>
Orange fire authorities said that the home in the 1400 block of Cabrillo Street 
had recently undergone a remodeling and a new roof was installed. 
</P>
<P>
"They recently had a fire retardant application on the roof and it didn't 
work," said Montoya. "We have got to look at who did (the application) and what 
they applied." 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim's deputy fire marshal, McCloud, said there is often a misperception 
among homeowners of the effectiveness of fire-treated shake roofs in protecting 
their homes -- something Los Angeles officials may have had in mind in banning 
even treated wood-shake roofs. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously (Los Angeles city officials) were taking into consideration the fact 
that fire retardancy does not last forever, and that depending on the 
circumstances of the fire and its intensity, even treated roofs will burn," 
McCloud said. 
</P>
<P>
However, McCloud said he knew of no instances in Anaheim of a fire-retardant 
shake roof catching fire.

COUNCIL PUTS OFF VOTE ON METRO RAIL FINANCIAL PACKAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY, Times City-County Bureau Chief 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"I won't forget this," Chairman Nate Holden said when fellow City Council 
committee members ignored him last week and recommended a huge city financial 
aid package for the Los Angeles Metro Rail subway. 
</P>
<P>
They say of Holden that he never forgets a slight, no matter how slight it is. 
So Wednesday, he got his revenge. 
</P>
<P>
With Holden leading the opposition on the City Council floor, the lawmakers 
overruled the Transportation and Traffic Committee and refused to approve the 
aid package. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$277 Million Sought 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they delayed for a week action on the request to commit up to $277 
million in city funds for construction of Metro Rail from the Wilshire-Alvarado 
station to Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not catastrophic," said Councilman Marvin Braude, who was in charge of 
pushing the aid package through the council. "I think the votes will be there." 
</P>
<P>
But do not include Braude. He is on vacation next week, as are some other 
council members. It may be three weeks until he can put together the eight 
votes needed for approval on the 15-member council. 
</P>
<P>
"Every delay escalates the cost," Braude said in an interview after the vote. 
</P>
<P>
The story began last week when Legislative Analyst William R. McCarley 
presented the financing request to the committee. 
</P>
<P>
The request from the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission asked the 
city to pay $96 million from its share of countywide transportation sales tax 
revenues. The money from the tax is split among various local governments in 
the county, and Los Angeles has already allocated a substantial amount of its 
share of the work of building the first segment of Metro Rail from Union 
Station downtown to Wilshire Boulevard and Alvarado Street. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the $96 million, the Transportation Commission asked the city to 
obligate another $181 million for potential cost overruns. 
</P>
<P>
And the commission said it will later ask for $112 million more in city funds 
for construction of the subway from Hollywood and Vine to North Hollywood. That 
request was not formally before the council. 
</P>
<P>
Holden declared that the huge project was costing much more than estimated. He 
demanded that the committee delay the vote for a week to get more information 
and to send a message to subway builders that the council is watching costs. 
The other two committee members, Braude and Councilman Michael Woo, a former 
chairman, turned down Holden's request for a delay. 
</P>
<P>
Outvoted, Holden finally joined them in supporting the measure in committee, 
but when the measure hit the council floor Wednesday, he complained that his 
wishes as committee chairman had been ignored. Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores 
said the council owed Holden respect and supported him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Information Arrives Late 
</P>
<P>
And, the pro-appropriation forces had made a strategic error. A thick packet 
from McCarley and City Administrative Officer Keith Comrie with all the 
information about the aid proposal was received by council members just before 
the debate began, too late for them to study it. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unconscionable for something of this magnitude to be forced to a vote 
today," Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked later if he lost because he was unprepared, Braude said: "I was prepared. 
I did not have staff work. McCarley let me down."

Ticket scalpers and peddlers of pirated baseball souvenirs beware: Anaheim 
police and Major League Baseball will play hardball at the July 11 All Star 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"Do not come to Anaheim," Police Chief Joseph Malloy warned profiteers during a 
press conference Wednesday at Anaheim Stadium, site of the 60th All Star 
contest next week. "Not only will your goods be taken from you, (but) you will 
be subject to arrest." 
</P>
<P>
The sellout game, which is expected to attract thousands of out-of-town fans, 
is also likely to lure characters not in keeping with the All-American image of 
baseball, authorities predicted. Hard-to-get tickets with a face value of $40 
and $50 are already being sold through scalpers for $750 and more, and 
officials moved this week to head off any illegal sales of tickets and 
souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
In California, it is legal to offer tickets at inflated prices but illegal to 
sell them -- even at face value -- on stadium grounds. 
</P>
<P>
The offensive on illegal ticket-scalping and counterfeit merchandise sales -- 
both misdemeanors -- will include plainclothes police and baseball security 
officers stationed at the ballpark and local tourist hotels, officials said. 
Police will also set up a command post at the Anaheim Hilton Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Such illegal sales are always a problem, but authorities are seeking to prevent 
a black market boom in anticipation of the game, which will give Anaheim and 
the host Angels a national spotlight. Acknowledging that police can do little 
to prevent ticket sales through agencies or newspaper ads, Malloy said the 
scalper crackdown will concentrate on illegal sales on the ballpark grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"On game day, the (illegal sales) action is right in front of the stadium," 
Malloy said. "We'll be there and anywhere else that fans congregate." 
</P>
<P>
Souvenir counterfeiters who cut in on sales of officially sanctioned baseball 
goods net an estimated $1 million annually, but a recent nationwide crackdown 
has made the practice more risky, according to Tom Ostertag, director of legal 
affairs for Major League Baseball. More than 250 individuals have been 
prosecuted for selling counterfeit souvenirs in the last three years, and a 
Long Island manufacturer was recently shut down for producing trademark goods 
without authorization, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Holding up a tie-dyed counterfeit T-shirt with a koala bear in a catcher's mask 
under a Dodgers logo, Ostertag warned of the "junk merchandise" that souvenir 
pirates foist off on unwary consumers. Counterfeit goods such as a San Diego 
Padres cap bearing a skewed team logo and shirts that lose their markings after 
a single washing also have been confiscated in recent sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
The quality of such goods is often poor, and manufacturers generally use 
copyrighted logos of the 26 major league teams without authorization. 
</P>
<P>
Major League Baseball oversees quality and design of official goods and is paid 
a royalty of 8.5% of the sales price. More than 300 manufacturers are licensed 
to produce caps, T-shirts and baseball novelties in a retail trade that has 
grown from $220 million in 1987 to a projected $800 million in 1989. Official 
goods all bear a red, white and blue tag with a batter in silhouette -- the 
Major League Baseball trademark. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way for fans to know they are getting the real thing is to look for 
the tag," Ostertag said.

DORNAN URGES PRESIDENT TO PARDON NORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Declaring that Oliver L. North was the "fall guy" for former President Reagan's 
"gutless advisers," an angry Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) on 
Wednesday urged President Bush to formally pardon North, the central figure in 
the Iran-Contra scandal. 
</P>
<P>
"Jimmy Carter pardoned draft dodgers, and they can all vote and run for office. 
. . . I serve with some of them in Congress," Dornan said as he stood outside 
the U.S. Courthouse here and made public a letter signed by 58 members of 
Congress calling for a North pardon. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan, who sat with North's wife, Betsy, and the family's clergyman during 
North's sentencing, spoke to reporters moments after U.S. District Judge 
Gerhard A. Gesell fined North $150,000 but spared him a term in prison. Nearby, 
about 30 North supporters carried placards urging a presidential pardon and 
expressing sentiments such as "Oliver North, American Hero." 
</P>
<P>
Dornan said he was surprised by the leniency of the sentence, which includes a 
requirement that the 45-year-old former Marine lieutenant colonel and White 
House aide perform 1,200 hours of community service in an anti-drug program. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Dornan said he would not immediately forward the congressional 
letter to the White House, but wait to give the President a chance to react to 
North's sentencing "without whatever pressure a letter from 58 congressmen 
applies on the executive branch." 
</P>
<P>
However, a White House spokesman said there would be no reaction, and that a 
North pardon has not been discussed. 
</P>
<P>
North should be pardoned, Dornan said, to permit him to run for federal office, 
should he choose. 
</P>
<P>
While expressing continued admiration for Reagan, Dornan told reporters that he 
believed the former President reneged on an implied promise to pardon both 
North and his one-time boss, former national security adviser John M. 
Poindexter. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting between Reagan and congressional Republicans in late 1987 or early 
1988, Dornan said, he stood in line behind Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.) as Hyde 
greeted the President. "Henry said, 'Mr. President, some fine day before you 
leave office, preferably Veterans Day . . . do you think you could find it in 
your heart, sir, and go down to that Vietnam memorial and pardon two courageous 
people who have served their country so well, Adm. Poindexter and Col. North?' 
</P>
<P>
"And the President said, to the best of my recollection, 'Well, Henry, some 
fine day that just might happen.' " 
</P>
<P>
Dornan said, "I took it as a promise. . . . I thought the President would do 
just that. We're all shocked that he didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for both Reagan and Hyde said they personally were unaware of the 
incident and could not immediately confirm that it occurred. 
</P>
<P>
A member of the House Armed Services Committee, Dornan has long criticized 
congressional efforts to restrict military aid to the Contra rebels fighting 
the Sandinista government of Nicaragua. North was convicted of three felonies 
in connection with his efforts to funnel to the Contras profits from secret 
arms sales to the Iranian government. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe he was a fall guy," Dornan said of North. "I warned Ollie North that 
the White House would break him. . . . I said to Ollie North, 'Ollie, they are 
giving you too much responsibility. . . . You are wearing too many hats.' 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of doing anything" about problems in Central America, Dornan said, 
"the moderate, gutless advisers to President Reagan . . . turned Ollie and 
Poindexter loose on their own. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"This man was pushed to the point of (making) minor mistakes because the White 
House was relying on the only man of action there," Dornan said, "while (former 
Reagan adviser) Mike Deaver was running around like some sleaze-ball trying to 
block people of substance from getting to President Reagan and telling him to 
go on television on Central America, not on tax reform. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Dornan, those who signed the letter urging a North pardon 
included Reps. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita), C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport 
Beach), William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) and Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad).

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ETHICS PANEL'S RENT DEAL CALLED IMPROPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The commission appointed by Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley to rewrite the city's 
ethics law is renting an office from the owner of the Westside Pavilion 
shopping mall for $1,000 per month, well below the prevailing rate in the 
Westwood neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement has irritated some homeowners, who say it is improper for the 
panel to receive below-market accommodations from a developer with a project 
pending before the city. In January, Westfield Inc. received preliminary 
approval from the City Council to expand the mall, but needs final approval to 
build a controversial bridge over Westwood Boulevard to connect the mall and 
annex. 
</P>
<P>
"Of all the buildings to rent, you don't rent that one," Sandy Brown, who heads 
a coalition of five homeowners' groups near the mall that oppose the expansion, 
said Wednesday. "They should at least charge them market value." 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the commission and Westfield denied that the commission has 
received special treatment. "It is a tempest in a teapot," said Xandra Kayden, 
director of the ethics commission. "Ideally, we would have found free space, 
but we felt an obligation to pay rent."

FUNDS BEING SOUGHT FOR TELECOMMUTING CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Riverside officials are seeking state funding for an experimental telecommuting 
work center for employees of several private companies in Orange County, 
Riverside's transportation chief said this week. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Reagan, executive director of the Riverside Transportation Commission, 
said the work center would be in the Riverside-Corona area and would allow 
company employees to use computers and fax machines there instead of driving on 
the Riverside Freeway to offices in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very interested in this as a way to relieve traffic congestion and meet 
air quality goals," Reagan said. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Steve Clute (D-Riverside) has introduced a bill that would provide 
$100,000 in state funds for the telecommuting experiment. The bill is before 
the Assembly Transportation Committee. 
</P>
<P>
No Orange County firms have been identified as participants in the project, 
Reagan said. A search for companies is being conducted in part by officials of 
Pacific Bell in Orange. Pacific Bell, among other companies, markets 
telecommuting services.

BANKER TELLS OF RADIN REJECTING EVANS' BID ON 'COTTON CLUB' PARTNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McDOUGAL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a stormy meeting in the weeks before he was killed in 1983, theatrical 
entrepreneur Roy Radin turned down efforts by Hollywood producer Robert Evans 
to allow Elayne (Lanie) Greenberger, a reputed drug dealer, into their 
film-making partnership, a banker testified Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have charged Greenberger and three other defendants with the 1983 
murder of Radin because he would not cut her in on the $35-million film 
production company deal that he had made with Evans. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Alegria, the Puerto Rican banker who drew up the contract between Evans 
and Radin, testified Wednesday that during the April, 1983, meeting in Evans' 
Manhattan townhouse, Radin and Greenberger argued over her share of the film 
company. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Completion Bond 
</P>
<P>
Greenberger broke down and wept, Alegria testified during the ongoing hearing 
into Radin's death, because Radin would not recognize her role in introducing 
him to Evans. Although Evans wanted Greenberger as a partner, Radin adamantly 
refused, Alegria said. 
</P>
<P>
Radin and Evans had also fought bitterly, "almost every day," according to 
Alegria, although they usually ended up hugging each other. Alegria said he was 
holding out on completing the deal until Evans came up with a completion bond 
for "Cotton Club" to guarantee that the film would get made. 
</P>
<P>
On the evening of May 13, 1983, Radin and Greenberger entered a limousine 
outside the Hollywood Regency hotel and drove off to a planned dinner meeting 
at La Scala restaurant in Beverly Hills. Radin had told associates that he and 
Greenberger, later identified by homicide investigators as alleged cocaine 
dealer Lanie Jacobs, were going to patch up their differences. 
</P>
<P>
Radin never made it to dinner. His body was found four weeks later in a 
deserted canyon near Gorman. Prosecutors believe that Greenberger hired three 
former security guards who worked for Hustler publisher Larry Flynt to execute 
Radin. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has not been charged, Evans has not been ruled out as a suspect by 
the district attorney's office. The 59-year-old producer has refused to testify 
in the hearing on grounds that he could incriminate himself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shot to Death 
</P>
<P>
The month before Radin was shot to death, he and Evans planned to turn the 
movie "Cotton Club" into a three-film deal that could eventually reap $150 
million in profits, according to Alegria. 
</P>
<P>
Their first film was to have been "Cotton Club," which was budgeted at $26 
million when the two men signed an agreement with Alegria in April, 1983. The 
film eventually ended up $20 million over budget.

WITH A BALCONY'S 'SNAP,' FUN TURNED INTO HORROR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARRELL DAWSEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
It was just after 9 p.m. when Craig Johnson heard a group of revelers file out 
onto the wooden balcony of the condominium next door to his Playa del Rey home. 
As the party-goers settled in, Johnson listened to their shrill shrieks of glee 
as the Independence Day rockets began to arc high into the night air. 
</P>
<P>
Then came "the snap." 
</P>
<P>
"It was like slow motion," Johnson said Wednesday, hours after the second-story 
balcony collapsed Tuesday night, injuring a neighbor and her seven guests. 
"There was the snap, and all the people on board just went for a ride. They 
just sort of slid off and onto the ground." 
</P>
<P>
Within seconds, the shrieks turned into horrifying wails as the victims tumbled 
into a flower planter below. Those injured in the accident at 16 66th Ave. 
included a woman who was impaled on a half-inch sprinkler pipe. 
</P>
<P>
Arlene Holtzman, 51, was airlifted to UCLA Medical Center with a portion of the 
pipe still in her back after firefighters spent 30 minutes cutting her free. 
She was listed in serious condition after surgery on the puncture wound. 
Medical Center spokesman Mike Byrne said she may have suffered internal 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, neighbors recalled the incident as they stood beneath the 
30-foot-long balcony, which was still hanging from the second floor of the 
condominium at nearly a 45-degree angle. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was some kids playing," said Johnson, who witnessed the accident 
with his wife, Cindy. "At first, I figured some kids were just playing a prank. 
But when I looked, I saw the people fall. 
</P>
<P>
"There were also a bunch of potted plants on the balcony that fell on the 
people. They must have weighed about 10 pounds each." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Playter, whose son lives across the street from the accident scene, said 
he mistook the sound of the crashing balcony for vandals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Idea' 
</P>
<P>
"When I heard it crash, I thought somebody had knocked over a park bench," 
Playter said. "The kids do that sort of thing sometimes. I had no idea that it 
was this bad." 
</P>
<P>
"It was horrible," said Jeff Livick, 22, who lives in the condominium next 
door. "People were really hurt. But nobody died though. . . . Still, it's a 
bummer. It's a bad way to put a damper on a fabulous Fourth." 
</P>
<P>
Among the other injured party-goers, Barbara Shore, 51, was airlifted to UCLA 
Medical Center, suffering from head injuries. She was listed in fair condition. 
</P>
<P>
Candace Shank, 40, and Madeline Watson, 41, whom neighbors identified as the 
owner of the condominium, were treated at Brotman Memorial Hospital for minor 
cuts and bruises and were released. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conditions Listed 
</P>
<P>
Ad Williams, 55, and Lorraine Grawoig, 53, are listed in fair condition at 
Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Cris, 49, and Stan Garris, whose age was not released, were also injured in 
the fall. Police said they were uncertain whether the men were hospitalized.

FIREWORKS DELAY IGNITES COMPLAINTS IN LAGUNA NIGUEL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Angry residents telephoned Laguna Niguel Chamber of Commerce officials 
Wednesday, complaining that their Independence Day spirits plummeted when the 
organization's Fourth of July fireworks show started one hour late. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you could say that many people felt frustrated by the delay," said 
chamber Manager Julie Sweany. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Niguel Chamber sponsored the free fireworks demonstration at Laguna 
Niguel Regional Park. Fireworks were scheduled for 9 p.m., but did not start 
until 9:58, Sweany said. 
</P>
<P>
"The chamber is very upset about this, and we're looking into it," Sweany said. 
"Right now, we don't have all the information, and the reasons (for the delay) 
are not quite clear." 
</P>
<P>
The chamber had invited Laguna Niguel residents to the fireworks demonstration, 
and hundreds turned out for the show. 
</P>
<P>
"I was watching with my children, and so I was among those wondering about the 
delay," Sweany said. "Children get tired after a while." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Romanio, manager of Pyro Spectaculars of Rialto, the commercial exhibitor 
for the fireworks display, blamed the delay on the Orange County fire marshal's 
office, which supervises such public fireworks displays. But Kathleen Cha, a 
County Fire Department spokeswoman, said the delay was not the fault of the 
fire marshal's representative at the scene. She said the delay was because of 
"of a slow setup" by the exhibitor, which Romanio denied. 
</P>
<P>
Sweany said she was told that "it had to do with safety precautions." 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Niguel residents weren't the only ones in the county to be disappointed 
by Fourth of July fireworks delays. In Fountain Valley, about 60,000 spectators 
waited in vain for a show that had to be postponed until Saturday because the 
truck carrying the fireworks was delayed in a freeway traffic snarl north of 
Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
That same truck carried fireworks for a Los Alamitos display, causing that show 
to be delayed more than 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Cha, the spokeswoman for the County Fire Department, said that one professional 
fireworks technician suffered second- and third-degree burns on Tuesday night 
when a device exploded prematurely at a display at Camino del Avion Junior High 
in San Juan Capistrano in south Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
She said the technician, whom she identified as Lynn Phillip Hawthorne, 42, was 
airlifted from the site to UCI Medical Center in Orange.

TRAFFIC DEATH, BRAWL, BLAZE MARK END OF LONG HOLIDAY

The long Fourth of July weekend came to a violent end Tuesday night in Orange 
County with the death of a 28-year-old Newport Beach motorcyclist, a Huntington 
Beach brawl that left a teen-ager seriously injured and the torching of a 
lifeguard station. 
</P>
<P>
The four-day weekend, which was marked by excellent weather, also saw thousands 
of arrests and citations for violations such as drunk driving and disturbing 
the peace. All this came as beach city police geared up to handle anticipated 
overflow crowds along the coast. And their predictions were correct. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'First Good Weather All Summer' 
</P>
<P>
"We started to get nice weather on Friday, and it was the first good weather 
we've had all summer," said Huntington Beach Police Lt. Mike Biggs, who 
reported that 110,000 people crowded onto the city beach on Tuesday in the 
biggest attendance of the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday we had terrific weather," he said. "Today 
(Wednesday) we have fog and wind. We would have preferred to have this the rest 
of the weekend. It would have made the crowds a lot smaller." 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana office of the California Highway Patrol reported that two adults 
and an unborn child were victims of traffic accidents in Orange County during 
the period that began at 6 p.m. Friday and ended at midnight Tuesday. In all, 
said Leslie Lazo, a spokeswoman for the CHP in Westminster, there were 78 
traffic-related fatalities statewide. 
</P>
<P>
The motorcycle death in Newport Beach came at 9:20 p.m. Tuesday when Dietrich 
Charles Long, heading south on MacArthur Boulevard near San Joaquin Hills Road, 
was hit by a pickup truck. The truck was driven by Ira Louis Radstone, 21, of 
Lancaster, said Newport Beach Police Lt. Tim Newman. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary investigation showed that Radstone apparently was trying to make 
a U-turn over a painted center divider when his truck collided with the 
motorcycle. Long was not wearing a helmet, Newman said. Long was treated by 
paramedics and then taken to Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach, where he died, 
Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
Police did not cite or arrest Radstone, Newman said, but an investigation is 
continuing. 
</P>
<P>
Another fatality occurred Monday in Huntington Beach when Jewel Gray, 86, of 
Huntington Beach was struck by a car as she was trying to cross Brookhurst 
Street near Kamuela Drive. Gray died Tuesday at UCI Medical Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach Police Lt. Ed McErlain said there was no traffic light at the 
intersection, and no marked crosswalk. He said there was no evidence that the 
driver of the car, Susan Kane, 23, of Bellflower, was speeding and she was not 
charged. An investigation is continuing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, a 29-year-old woman who was 7 months pregnant was struck in a 
hit-and-run accident in Santa Ana, killing the unborn child. 
</P>
<P>
The holiday problems in Orange County were not confined to the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested six youths in connection with a stabbing Tuesday night after a 
brawl at the Huntington Beach Pier. 
</P>
<P>
The six, from Los Angeles and Duarte and ranging in age from 14 to 17, were 
taken to Orange County Juvenile Hall and arrested on suspicion of attempted 
murder in connection with the stabbing. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old Los Angeles youth, whose name was withheld, was stabbed as he 
and some friends were fighting with another group of six boys Tuesday in a 
parking lot near Pacific Coast Highway, just south of the pier at Huntington 
Street, McErlain said. The victim was reported in serious condition at Fountain 
Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach's Lt. Biggs said officers issued 190 citations on Tuesday 
alone. He did not have a tally of the weekend's citations, but said, "As Fourth 
of Julys go, it was about average." 
</P>
<P>
Most of citations were for alcohol-related infractions, he said. "There were a 
few assaults. The rest fell into the normal run-of-the-mill drinking and 
possession-of-drug charges," he said. "It's our biggest problem -- people 
drinking on the beach." 
</P>
<P>
In Newport Beach, a special two-day operation Monday and Tuesday placed 150 
officers on the street at one time, a contrast to the usual 30 to 40 on a 
regular day, Lt. Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
Newman said there were 172 arrests made during the two days, compared to 224 
from the year before. On a regular, non-holiday night, there might be only 30 
arrests, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They were predominantly alcohol-related offenses, drunk driving, drunk in 
public, assault, disturbing the peace -- a wide variety of things," he said. 
But the penalty was a bit stiffer this year. 
</P>
<P>
"If you broke the law on the Fourth of July in Newport Beach, you probably went 
to jail," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also said a lifeguard stand at 40th Street was torched on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Three males were seen running from the scene, but there are no suspects in 
custody, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire destroyed the wooden structure valued at $2,000, he said.

<P>
PATTISUE PLUMER'S RECORD SETS HER APART FROM SISTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A year ago, PattiSue Plumer lay in the medical tent at the U.S. Olympic Trials 
in Indianapolis, trying to recover from the severe dehydration and heat 
exhaustion she suffered in one of the most painful races of her career. 
</P>
<P>
Vying for the third and final spot in the women's 3,000 meters, Plumer had 
overcome the heat -- 95 degrees and 60% humidity -- and some tremendous 
competition, to stagger across the finish line with an Olympic berth in her 
grasp. 
</P>
<P>
Hours later, after recovering, Plumer left the medical tent and was instantly 
showered with cheers. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, many of the well-wishers, like so many well-wishers before, said 
the wrong thing: 
</P>
<P>
"Way to go, Polly! You're tough, Polly Sue!" 
</P>
<P>
Once again, PattiSue Plumer was being confused with her younger sister, Polly, 
a former track star at University High School and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to scream at them, 'Her name is PattiSue! Give the woman some 
respect," said her fiance, Steve Levere. 
</P>
<P>
"But PattiSue just said, 'Just forget it, Steve. It always happens.' " 
</P>
<P>
If making the Olympic team last year wasn't enough to establish PattiSue's 
identity in the public's eye, perhaps her performance Monday at Stockholm, 
Sweden was. 
</P>
<P>
At Stockholm, Plumer placed second to East Germany's Kathrin Ullrich in the 
5,000 meters and set an American record with a time of 14 minutes 57.22 
seconds, slashing more than nine seconds off the record of 15:06.53 set in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
The former record-holder? Mary Slaney, who until Plumer's race held American 
records in every track distance from the 800 to the 10,000 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Plumer, whose time of 14:57.22 ranks as the fifth-fastest women's 5,000 meters 
of all time, said the race was almost as tough as last year's Olympic Trials. 
</P>
<P>
"It was real hard, the pain side of it I mean," said Plumer in a telephone 
interview from Stockholm. "Plus the conditions were tough. It was 75 degrees, 
there was bright sun on half of the field, and the other half was in the 
shadows, so it was tricky to see. There was a lot of bumping, too." 
</P>
<P>
But the field, which along with Ullrich, included world-class Olympians Liz 
McColgan of Great Britain, Lynn Williams of Canada and Elly Van Hulst of 
Holland, helped pull Plumer to a 20-second improvement over her previous best. 
And the crowd, as with most on the European circuit, was loud and tremendously 
supportive. 
</P>
<P>
"With three laps to go, there were four of us left," said Plumer, 27. "And with 
two laps to go, there was just three -- me, the East German (Ullrich) and the 
Canadian (Williams). With one lap to go, somehow I had a burst of energy and 
then it was just me and (Ullrich). 
</P>
<P>
"She passed me with 200 (meters) to go, I passed her back, she passed me and 
that was it for me. I was a little amazed I even made it to the finish line." 
</P>
<P>
Many were surprised that Plumer did so well, considering her race schedule the 
past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
On June 24, Plumer won a 3,000-meter race in Birmingham, England, by outkicking 
McColgan down the final stretch. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, her flight was delayed 10 hours, her clothes were stolen and she 
lost the lucky pearl earrings she received for her 16th birthday. Nevertheless, 
Plumer won another 3,000 at Villeneuve D'Asq, France. 
</P>
<P>
On June 26, Plumer flew to Lausanne, Switzerland, to try to get into a meet -- 
one in which the meet director, believing Plumer had little drawing power, had 
refused her entry. After much argument, Plumer was granted entry. 
</P>
<P>
Plumer not only won the race, but outran 1988 Olympic gold medalist Paula Ivan 
of Romania for the victory. Plumer's time of 8:42.12 is the fastest in the 
world this year. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt great during the race," she said. "I kept expecting that heavy fatigue 
to set in, but I felt fine. People kept asking me, 'Aren't you worried you're 
racing too much? Aren't you tired?' But the fatigue never came. All of a sudden 
it was me and Paula with a lap to go. I just went for it." 
</P>
<P>
Tenacity has become a trademark for Plumer, who, despite spending the past 
three years in law school, has managed to run on a consistent, national-class 
level. She won the 3,000 at The Athletics Congress championship last month by 
outkicking former Missouri star Sabrina Dornhoefer, who lost to Plumer for the 
final spot on the Olympic team last July. Plumer finished 13th at the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
But according to her college coach, Stanford's Brook Johnson, Plumer wasn't 
always the most courageous runner. 
</P>
<P>
"During her freshman year, she was just going through the motions," Johnson 
said. "In that year, the qualifying standard for (AIAW) nationals in the 3,000 
was 9:40. She ran 9:39.9 to qualify and 9:39.9 (actually 9:42.02) at the 
nationals. 
</P>
<P>
"I sat her down and said 'Look, I brought you here because you're a freshman. 
If all you're gonna do is run the minimum, then you're just running on the 
recreational level. I want to see how much you want out of yourself.' That was 
a turning point." 
</P>
<P>
Plumer, recently chosen by The Athletics Congress as the only women's 
3,000-meter entrant to represent the U.S. in the International Amateur Athletic 
Federation World Cup meet Sept. 8-10 in Barcelona, Spain, ran almost a minute 
faster -- 8:55.98 -- the next year. 
</P>
<P>
Plumer grew up in Newport Beach, but in the middle of seventh grade moved with 
her father to Ridgeway, Colo., a tiny town on the western slopes of the 
Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
In high school, Plumer competed in track and cross-country, placing third as a 
senior in the mile (5:10) and the two-mile (11:20) at the Colorado state meet. 
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, about a 1,000 miles west, Polly Plumer, 24, was making 
national news at University High. In 1982, Polly, who because of persistent 
injuries is in semi-retirement, set the current national record for the prep 
girls' 1,600 meters in 4:35.24. 
</P>
<P>
Even when PattiSue went to Stanford, where she became a three-time NCAA 
All-American in track, placing second in the 3,000 meters for three consecutive 
years, people still confused her with her sister. 
</P>
<P>
"She was always 'Polly Sue Plumer' to some people," Johnson said. "I can 
remember her running a race in L.A. and San Diego . . . through the whole race 
they announced her as Polly Sue Plumer. 
</P>
<P>
"She was clearly under her sister's shadow. There wasn't any sibling rivalry, 
but PattiSue would say, 'If I'm (working so hard), the least they could do is 
get my name right.' " 
</P>
<P>
A understandable request -- perhaps now more than ever.

LONG-AWAITED WATER RIDE OPENS QUIETLY, RECEIVES GOOD GRADES FROM THRILL-SEEKING 
PARK PATRONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Was Splash Mountain worth the wait? Disneyland patrons seemed to think so 
Wednesday as they hung on to their mouse ears and tried out the park's new 
water-flume ride. 
</P>
<P>
After spending eight months fixing design glitches in the world's most 
elaborate flume ride, Disneyland unofficially opened Splash Mountain to the 
public this week. And the public seemed pleased. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one fast ride. It's really fun -- but scary too," said Shana Koch, a 
9-year-old from Yreka. 
</P>
<P>
"They try to fake you out like it's not going to be a good ride -- there's 
nothing to start with," said John Sparrer, a labor union president from San 
Jose who has waited in Splash Mountain queues three times in three days. "Then 
the animated characters are pretty cute . . . and there's a great plunge at the 
end." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Splash Mountain, based on the 1946 Disney movie "Song of the South," 
is the speediest thrill ride in the park when its logs make their final, 
five-story descent into a foggy brier patch. 
</P>
<P>
It was that final plunge that caused most of the delay in Splash Mountain, 
which was initially scheduled to open last November. 
</P>
<P>
Design flaws with the log-shaped boats caused passengers to get soaked during 
the ride's 45-m.p.h. drop. To prevent patrons from getting drenched on cold 
days, Splash Mountain designers spent months redoing parts of the attraction. 
</P>
<P>
The troubles seemed to fade away this week, when Disneyland began allowing 
customers to try the ride. The so-called soft opening gives the Anaheim park 
time to test the attraction and eliminate remaining bugs before the official 
opening on July 17. 
</P>
<P>
"It's basically a testing period," said Bob Roth, a park spokesman. So while 
the park will continue testing until the ride officially opens, there could be 
times when it is not running. 
</P>
<P>
That is exactly what happened Wednesday afternoon, when technical problems 
caused Splash Mountain to shut down for about 30 minutes, to the dismay of 
patrons who had been waiting as long as an hour in lines that stretched to the 
park's Haunted Mansion. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, most were like Andy Sparrer, 18, a student from San Jose who chose to 
continue waiting even after park attendants closed the ride. "It doesn't 
matter. It's worth the wait," said Sparrer, who, like John Sparrer, has tried 
the attraction three times in the last three days. 
</P>
<P>
Once on board the hollowed-out logs, riders start out slowly, gliding through a 
bright green forest of hanging vines in the springtime. They float past a 
snoring bear and into a series of trees, rocks and reddish-brown tunnels. 
</P>
<P>
By the time patrons get to the lavish musical finale, 30 "Audio Animatronics" 
critters -- some of them transplanted from the now-defunct "America Sings" 
attraction -- are silhouetted on a bayou on a rocking showboat, surrounded by 
an autumn sunset of animated golden rays. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, a menagerie of rabbits, crocodiles and squirrels sing the Uncle 
Remus tale of how Br'er Rabbit outwits the fox who wants to turn the hare into 
some fast food. 
</P>
<P>
The Disney surprises are there. Patrons who watch closely, for example, can see 
Br'er Rabbit leaving home on a handcart, or watch the hapless rabbit as he is 
tied up and about to be roasted in a caldron. There's a good view of Br'er 
Bear's backside as he gets stuck head-first in a beehive. 
</P>
<P>
And like any Disney legend, the tale ends happily -- but not before customers 
get hurled down the ride's final drop into the brier patch. 
</P>
<P>
But for many riders who tried out the new attraction this week, the story 
wasn't what mattered. Several, in fact, had no idea who Br'er Bear or Br'er 
Rabbit were. "It's just lots of fun," said Sparrer, the labor union president. 
</P>
<P>
With a capacity of 2,000 patrons per hour, Splash Mountain (nicknamed "Cash 
Mountain" by some industry observers) could increase Disneyland's attendance 2% 
to 10% during its first year of operation, said Bob McTyre, vice president of 
marketing and entertainment. Disneyland's annual attendance is about 13 
million.

LABOR COSTS RISE FAR FASTER FOR COMPETITORS THAN U.S.

U.S. labor costs rose more slowly last year than in all but one of the 11 
countries that are major competitors of the United States, the Labor Department 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The rise in U.S. labor costs -- 0.3% from 1987 to 1988 -- was dwarfed by 
increases such as 17% in Taiwan and 11.2% in South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Of 11 countries for which the Bureau of Labor Statistics gave figures, only 
France recorded a decline, at 0.8%. 
</P>
<P>
While U.S. workers were still earning more than employees in most of the other 
countries, the fall in the value of the dollar meant that a Japanese worker was 
catching up fast to his U.S. counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
The average Japanese worker earned $13.14 an hour in 1988, a 10.5% increase 
over 1987. The average in the United States was $13.90. 
</P>
<P>
In eight Western European countries, the costs were already higher than in the 
United States: $19.43 in Norway and $18.07 in West Germany, for example. 
</P>
<P>
In South Korea, however, the cost of an average hour's labor was just $2.45; in 
Taiwan, it was $2.71 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
That is, an employer could hire more than five Taiwanese or South Korean 
workers for the cost of hiring one American. This helps explain why owners have 
moved production lines out of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Not all labor costs go to workers as wages. The Labor Department figures 
include employer contributions to private plans and payroll taxes for social 
services, such as pensions and health care, from which workers benefit. 
</P>
<P>
These expenses are generally higher in Western Europe than in the United 
States, and higher in the United States than in the countries on the Pacific 
Rim.

FIREWORKS CAP HOLIDAY SHOW AT MEADOWS

<P>
Appearing as a guest conductor, Pasadena Symphony music director Jorge Mester 
led the Pacific Symphony through a competent if not very exciting concert on 
July 4 to open the Pacific's second Summer Series at Irvine Meadows 
Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, there were fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
The "All-American Celebration" actually was a Pan-American program, with the 
inclusion of Mexican composer Jose Pablo Moncayo Garcia's "Huapango." A crafty, 
colorful work, "Huapango" deconstructs and reassembles the rhythms and tunes of 
three popular Mexican folk dances. (Unfortunately, no one bothered to include 
program notes about this or any of the other works on the program.) 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra played with vivid attention and modest sweep. But the strings 
were often swamped, thanks to some murky, quirky amplification. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, "Huapango" appealed irresistibly to visceral interests. The suite 
from Walter Piston's ballet "The Incredible Flutist" made more intellectual 
demands, which were well met. 
</P>
<P>
Mester shaped the suave and witty dance tunes with affection, basked in the 
written-in crowd-cheering section and skillfully evoked the eerie atmosphere 
surrounding the magical title figure of the ballet. 
</P>
<P>
Disappointing, however, was Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue," with piano soloist 
Patricia Prattis Jennings venturing an introspective, sensitive reading and 
Mester leading a plain-wrap, overt account of the work. 
</P>
<P>
The conductor opened the program with a one-speed-fits-all approach to the 
Overture to Bernstein's "Candide" and closed it with a series of marches by 
Sousa, to which the fireworks were synchronized. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the taller housing erected over the stage in November caused 
fire officials to order the fireworks display moved off to the right, so those 
sitting in the first eight or nine rows of the orchestra section missed seeing 
about 30% of the attractive, if less than spectacular, pyrotechnics. 
</P>
<P>
The program was underwritten in part by Huntington Harbour residents Dr. and 
Mrs. Wayne Allen. In dubious taste, Dr. Allen was brought on stage to conduct 
the National Anthem. 
</P>
<P>
The official audience tally was 9,516, a new high for attendance at a Pacific 
Symphony concert. 
</P>
<P>
Mester will return July 22 to lead the next summer program. 
</P>

THEATER TO SOLICIT $1 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Trustees of the Irvine Theatre, which is currently under construction, will ask 
a potential contributor for a $1-million donation later this month in exchange 
for naming the 750-seat auditorium after him. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the nonprofit theater, which is scheduled for completion in 
August, 1990, at a cost of $17.6 million, declined to identify the prospective 
contributor. The theater trustees hope to raise $4.8 million in private funds 
by the end of this year. Construction and operating costs are to be shared by 
the city of Irvine, the theater's operating company and UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas H. Nielsen, trustee board chairman, announced that more than $400,000 in 
new donations has brought the amount raised so far to $1.9 million. Two 
corporate donations of $50,000 each were made by the Keith Cos., a 
land-developer consultant based in Costa Mesa, and Oltmans Construction, based 
in Whittier. There were also donations of $25,000 or more from 11 other 
corporations and individuals. The largest donations have come from the Irvine 
Co. ($500,000) and Taco Bell ($250,000). JAN HERMAN

NEW MAY NOT MEAN GOOD AS PAIR OF ONE-ACTS PROVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The struggling Illusion's New View Theatre in Fullerton continues to offer 
premieres of works by generally unknown playwrights, mostly from Orange County. 
The latest offerings are two one-acts -- a tract against the death penalty and 
a look at a young retarded man's plans to marry. 
</P>
<P>
Illusion's commitment to new plays is brave, especially in the face of meager 
ticket sales that founder Jeffrey Ault says might force the theater's closure. 
Considering all that, and realizing how much the county needs forums for 
unexposed writers, it would be great to applaud these one-acts. 
</P>
<P>
Not this time, though. These are awkward pieces: The first is barely a drama at 
all, and the second is frustratingly underdeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
Lonnie Lincoln's "Sympathy for the Devil's Advocate" (directed by Ault) starts 
off with a middle-aged woman (Irma Lozano, looking too young for the role) 
sitting down for a nice glass of Kool-Aid when a man (Tim Fedel) comes to the 
door. She thinks that he's trying to sell something, but he's an emissary from 
Hell -- he's the devil's advocate. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln apparently equates the devil with liberal thinking because the advocate 
sits to the left on every issue. But Lincoln's thrust throughout "Sympathy" is 
pro-liberal. Maybe there's a symbolic dimension to this reversal of attitudes, 
but it wasn't clear. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, the advocate tells the woman that he wants to debate her on this year's 
most important question. "Abortion?" she replies, but he says that was last 
year's important question (disregarding the historic battle before the U.S. 
Supreme Court in recent months). This year's big issue, according to the 
devil's advocate, is the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln describes the Betty Crockerish woman as "The Most Typical American," 
although she professes a conservatism that approaches fundamentalism. She and 
the advocate argue -- she gets worked up and claims capital punishment is a 
deterrent; he stays cool and tosses out a numbing litany of statistics meant to 
show that it isn't -- and no minds get changed. 
</P>
<P>
A failure here is that Lincoln talks about the death penalty but never 
dramatizes it. In fact, "Sympathy" most seems like a quirky class assignment 
that Lincoln, a retired college professor, might have given to a social studies 
class. You know, give me loads of information but try to make it interesting. A 
debate between George F. Will and Gore Vidal would make for better theater. 
</P>
<P>
Shawn Quirk's "Slow Like Me," directed by Walter Brown, at least attempts to 
bring in some humanity. Andy (Andrew Lowery) is a retarded teen-ager who wants 
to wed. But his parents (Robert Flyer and Sheri Savage) worry that Andy's 
retardation is hereditary and will be passed onto his children. 
</P>
<P>
In highly emotional scenes, the parents fight over their son's future and hint 
at the hardships they've encountered. There is at least one moving moment here, 
when Andrew tries to explain his attraction to his girlfriend, hinting that she 
may be handicapped as well. 
</P>
<P>
But "Slow Like Me" is mostly a lot of hand-wringing without resolution. Andrew 
is not defined sharply enough, nor are his parents and his relationship to 
them. It's also difficult to connect with his girlfriend (who never appears and 
is only talked about) and her importance to him. A better play might have 
included the girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
'SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE' and 'SLOW LIKE ME' 
</P>
<P>
An Illusion's New View Theatre production of one-acts by Lonnie Lincoln and 
Shawn Quirk. Directed by Jeffrey Ault and Walter Brown. With Tim Fedel, Irma 
Lozano, Andrew Lowery, Robert Flyer and Sheri Savage. Plays Fridays and 
Saturdays at 8 p.m. through Aug. 5 at 3030 Brea Blvd., Fullerton. Tickets: $5. 
(714) 990-9605.

JOSEPH N. BELL: HOT TIME IN NEW TOWN OPENS A LONG JOURNEY

<TEXT>
<P>
For the next six weeks, I'll be driving across the United States, sending back 
periodic reports about how things look out there to a three-decade resident of 
California's Orange County. I'll be driving alone to Florida's Orange County -- 
across Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and the southeastern states. My wife and 
stepson will fly to Florida to vacation (I hope that's what it will be) with me 
at Walt Disney World and later in North Carolina. Then they'll fly home and 
I'll drive back to California through the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
Those who think I'm out of my mind to drive 7,000 miles in the worst heat of 
summer, listen up. I'll be telling you why it refreshes and re-energizes me. 
And I'll also be writing about some of the riches of this country that can only 
be seen by car. 
</P>
<P>
Since it has become a staple to a growing number of Orange County people -- 
particularly those who own boats -- I decided to spend my first night checking 
out Laughlin, Nev. If nothing else, it conditioned me for the heat I'll be 
experiencing the rest of my trip. 
</P>
<P>
I hit Laughlin on a Saturday night. The temperature had been 102 during the 
day, and the body heat from the crowds in the casinos must have pushed it up 
another 10 degrees that night. 
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas it ain't -- which isn't necessarily bad. Although both cities exist 
primarily because of gambling (the Laughlin newspaper is called the Weekly 
Gambler and has a pair of dice and a royal flush in spades on the masthead), 
the similarity -- right now, at least -- ends there. Laughlin is a kinder, 
gentler, down-home Vegas (I haven't seen so many cowboy hats since I went to an 
Oklahoma-Texas football game years ago). And most of the people with whom I 
talked had the twang to go along. 
</P>
<P>
Laughlin is built on the Colorado River, which separates it from Bullhead City 
on the other side. Water taxis carry commuters back and forth. The river serves 
multiple purposes in Laughlin. It's nice to look at, provides a launching pad 
for boaters (and sells all sorts of water trips), offers a natural "strip" for 
the casinos, and is even fit for swimming -- in spite of all the boats I saw 
plying the river. The new Harrahs had a well-populated swimming beach, and from 
above, the water looked quite clear. 
</P>
<P>
It takes almost exactly the same amount of time to drive to Laughlin from 
Orange County as it does to Vegas, even though the last 40 miles to Laughlin 
are over a roller-coaster two-lane road. Right now, it's about the only way to 
get to Laughlin, but that will be changing soon. Work has just gotten under way 
on a new, 7,500-foot runway at the Laughlin airport that will cost $26 million 
and be able to provide landing room for aircraft the size of a Boeing 727. 
</P>
<P>
And that's not all that is changing in Laughlin. The first thing that strikes a 
visitor is the construction activity. Virtually every existing hotel is 
building an addition, some larger than the original. Harrahs -- which just 
opened a few months ago -- is already working on doubling its size. The 
Flamingo Hilton is now going up. And ground has been broken for the most 
expensive hotel-casino project in Nevada -- an $800-million resort that will 
include four hotels and an 18-hole PGA championship golf course. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers are almost stupefying. Laughlin's gaming revenues have been 
increasing at the rate of about $100 million per year, housing is booming and 
so is population (from 95 people just five years ago to 3,500 today), with a 
work force of 12,000. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel-casinos have names like Colorado Belle and Pioneer and Riverside and 
Ramada Express. So many parking lots are being built over that the casinos are 
running buses to distant parking places -- which makes Harrahs' covered garage 
next to the casino one of the primary attractions in town. 
</P>
<P>
The current entertainment tends to be heavily country (the headliner the night 
I visited was Waylon Jennings, the "Nashville Rebel"), and the blackjack 
dealers talk spiritedly with customers about remote towns in Idaho or Oklahoma. 
And although there is much, much smoking, there are also numerous nonsmoking 
gambling tables and single-deck blackjack -- both civilized customs hard to 
come by in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
The certainty that all this is going to change very soon sent me away feeling a 
little sad. We don't really need another Las Vegas in Laughlin, with hard-eyed 
blackjack dealers, $100 tables, dreadful architecture and people pushing one 
another around looking hassled and unhappy. But it's going to take a lot of 
high rollers to pay for all those new casinos in Laughlin, and the folks I met 
there somehow didn't fit that picture very well. Neither did the nickel slots 
and $2 blackjack tables and friendliness of the help still prevalent in 
Laughlin that almost make losing your money fun. 
</P>
<P>
Oh well, maybe we can start another town up the river a bit.

LIFE ON WHEELS: COMPELLING REASONS FOR BUCKLING UP 
</P>

I saw something shocking on the freeway the other day. 
</P>
<P>
No, not another grisly wreck or messy spill. And it wasn't one of those rare 
scenes that you tell everybody about when you get where you're going. This was 
a problem that's been out there every day, only I just now got around to 
noticing it. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever I'm stuck in barely-moving traffic, I try to relieve some of the 
boredom and frustration by finding something of interest in my surroundings. I 
count expired registrations, read the messages on license plates, frames and 
bumpers, peek in my next-lane neighbors' windows to watch them perform personal 
grooming procedures, or try to figure out what radio station they're tuned to 
by the way they're moving to the beat. 
</P>
<P>
And that's how I saw it. Suddenly I realized that fewer than half the drivers 
around me were wearing their seat belts. (My favorite was the guy who was 
slathering his left arm in sunscreen as he steered his way through stop-and-go 
traffic. I'm all for saving your skin, but what about the rest of you?) 
</P>
<P>
I guess because I always wear my seat belt -- even if I'm just turning around 
in the driveway -- I just assumed most everybody else does, too. Sure, I've got 
a couple of friends who don't, but they're kind of odd and I figured that was 
just one more manifestation. Not so, apparently. 
</P>
<P>
People have all sorts of excuses for not buckling. One friend says he does use 
his belt, but only on long trips. But three out of four fatal accidents happen 
within 20 miles of the victim's home, according to Davine Abbott, program 
director of the Orange County Trauma Society. More than 80% are at speeds less 
than 40 m.p.h., and nonbelted fatalities have occurred at speeds as low as 12 
m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Others say belts are uncomfortable, and they wrinkle your clothes. "Carry a can 
of wrinkle spray," Abbott says. 
</P>
<P>
I know what you're saying: "If she's going to spend an entire column nagging at 
me to use my seat belt, I'm turning the page." Well, it's true, but stick with 
me anyway for just a little longer. If you still don't want to buckle up after 
you've heard me out, I promise not to bring up the subject again. 
</P>
<P>
I used to hate seat belts. I hated the way they felt. I hated the way the car 
kept beeping at you if you didn't put them on. I hated the idea that the 
government or anyone else was telling me what to do in the privacy of my own 
car. Defiantly, I buckled the belts on my old '74 Volkswagen behind the seats 
so that I'd never have to hear the electronic scolding when I started the car. 
</P>
<P>
In the 15 years since then, three things have combined to turn me into a 
born-again buckler. I became a mother, a paramedic, and an auto accident 
victim. If not for my seat belt, I might well have become something else: a 
dead person. 
</P>
<P>
As a novice mother, I still didn't buckle up, but I carefully strapped my 
babies into their safety seats whenever I took them anywhere. Unless they 
cried, in which case I unhooked everything and held them until they quieted 
down. After all, what harm could come to them in their mother's arms? 
</P>
<P>
I learned the answer to that question two years later when, as a fledgling 
paramedic, I saw a 10-month-old girl who had been flung from her mother's arms 
out the window, across the highway and into a ditch. All I could do was radio 
the coroner and try to comfort her stunned parents. 
</P>
<P>
So I became more conscientious about strapping my kids in, even though I 
refused to do so myself. Only after I saw some of the other things crunched 
metal could do to human flesh did I give in. You may be reading this over 
breakfast, so I won't go into the details. 
</P>
<P>
Let's just say I was convinced by an overwhelming dose of reality. But even 
then, I had a brief relapse. One day I reached into the back seat to release my 
daughter's belt and it wouldn't budge. I finally had to get a wrench to unbolt 
it from the frame and get her out. 
</P>
<P>
It was a freak thing; a petrified French fry was stuck in the works. But I 
refused to use belts at all for a few weeks, terrified that we could be trapped 
in a burning or sinking car. Then I had a look at the statistics and realized 
that wasn't likely. Less than .05% of all accidents involve fire and/or water, 
says Abbott. 
</P>
<P>
So I started belting again, although I still won't let the kids eat French 
fries in the car. 
</P>
<P>
By January of 1986, I had long since given up paramedic work, but the habit was 
firmly ingrained. I didn't need to make any changes to comply with the 
mandatory seat belt law that went into effect then. 
</P>
<P>
So when another driver plowed into me and pushed me into another car, my seat 
belt saved me. My car sustained more than $6,000 in damage. I was injured, but 
I'm here to tell about it. 
</P>
<P>
You think it can't or won't happen to you? 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the most recent year for which statistics are available, there were 
577,136 traffic accidents in California, with 360,699 injuries. That breaks 
down to one accident every 55 seconds, according to Abbott. 
</P>
<P>
Seat belt use has gone up dramatically in recent years, and that's encouraging. 
But the bad news is, according to a state study Abbott cited, only about 34% of 
us are buckling up even now. That's up from 3% in 1980. For passengers under 5, 
the rate has gone up from 9% in 1980 to 47% in 1988 -- but that's still less 
than half. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, according to a study by the Rand Corporation, 40% of parents 
surveyed said they never buckle up their children, while 27% said they did 
"sometimes or once in awhile" and 33% said they did "all or most of the time. 
</P>
<P>
The younger the child, the more likely he or she will be strapped in, according 
to the Rand study. Nearly two-thirds of children under the age of 1 were 
seat-belted regularly, compared with only 14% of 5- and 6-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
In metropolitan areas, children were slightly more likely to be belted, 
although black and Hispanic children were less likely to be strapped in, 
according to the Rand study. 
</P>
<P>
Parents who do buckle their children, by the way, are also more likely to be 
nonsmokers and breast-feeders, which led the Rand researchers to conclude that 
these parents were concerned about their children's health. 
</P>
<P>
Do me a favor. Try using those belts for a week. Nobody will think you're a 
wimp. Just say you're participating in an experiment. Then write and let me 
know how it worked out. 
</P>
<P>
And buckle up the kids, too. If you have a little one, get a car seat 
appropriate for the child's size, and use it according to the instructions. Too 
many parents misuse car seats, strapping them in wrong or not at all, Abbott 
says. But even a misused car seat can make it 40% less likely that a child will 
be killed or injured in an automobile accident, she says. That number jumps to 
70% if the seat is used correctly. 
</P>
<P>
Use an infant seat facing backward for babies under 20 pounds, Abbott says, and 
continue using that seat facing forward or a toddler seat until the child 
reaches 40 pounds. After that, a booster seat can not only make little ones 
safer but help them see out, which reduces the chance of car sickness. 
</P>
<P>
The Trauma Society, incidentally, offers rental seats at minimal cost for 
low-income families and short-term rentals for out-of-town visitors. For more 
information, call 937-5030.

RAISING FUNDS IS A SNAP FOR 'CAMP COOKIES BUILT'

<P>
Maybe the best moment was when Sherry Van Meter -- ex-Mousketeer, Girl Scout 
mom -- summoned Willa Dean Lyon from the small crowd gathered on the pool-side 
patio. 
</P>
<P>
Van Meter stood at a podium, a gift box in her hands, a broad smile brightening 
her still-perky features. Addressing 100 invitation-only guests at Willa Dean 
and William Lyon's Coto de Caza estate, she said as a former Mousketeer, she 
still feels partial to mice. 
</P>
<P>
"And just the other day, a little mouse told me that you were a cookie mom, 
Willa Dean!" 
</P>
<P>
Opening the box, Van Meter read aloud the icing inscription written on a cookie 
the size of a pizza: Our thanks to a great cookie mom. 
</P>
<P>
And that's when the perfectly poised Willa Dean Lyon -- society hostess, former 
Girl Scout mom -- had a close call with a blush. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how this rumor got out," said Lyon, laughing, shaking her head. 
"But I guess I did bake a few cookies in my day." 
</P>
<P>
Last week's party chez Lyon was hosted by the Girl Scout Council of Orange 
County to drum up donations to complete construction at Camp Scherman, the 
Council's 700-acre weekend retreat in the San Jacinto mountains near Idyllwild. 
</P>
<P>
"The camp, " said fund-raising chairman Ron Dominguez, "that cookies built." 
</P>
<P>
In operation for more than two decades, Camp Scherman has served an estimated 
8,000 girl scouts annually, said Dominguez. With expansion and remodeling to 
accommodate handicapped girls, the renovated camp will nearly double it's 
yearly occupancy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez said that what particularly impressed him about the Girl Scout 
Council -- and the primary reason he agreed to head the $1.5-million 
fund-raising drive -- was the organization's self-sufficiency. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time in 20 years that (the Girls Scouts) have asked for any 
financial support from the community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
During his speech to the assembled guests, Dominguez said the total cost of 
construction at Camp Scherman was $4.2 million. "Through their own efforts, 
they have raised all but the last $1.5 million, and now they're asking for our 
help to complete the project." 
</P>
<P>
Mona Ware, executive director of the county chapter of the Girl Scout Council, 
also spoke from the podium, beginning her impassioned speech by saying, "I 
think Camp Scherman and the Girl Scouts are about the greatest things in the 
world ever invented." 
</P>
<P>
Among guests were Gregory and Joyce DiRienzo, who said none of their three 
scout-age daughters had asked to join the Girl Scouts, "and I guess because of 
my business," said Joyce, an interior designer, "I haven't given it much 
thought, scheduling-wise." 
</P>
<P>
Kathryn Thompson said the Girl Scouts weren't part of her childhood in Dallas, 
but she scouted, nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad was a Boy Scout leader," said Thompson, "and he let me go on camping 
trips with them until I was about 13 years old. That's when the boys said 
they'd take me snipe hunting. My dad said, 'OK, that's it.' " 
</P>
<P>
After pool-side cocktails and buffet dinner of beef tenderloin and 
Oriental-style chicken (an al fresco meal outshone by the Lyons' majestic view 
of the purpling mountains), guests moved inside to watch a video of the 
renovation project and hear five scouts sing camp songs.

QUAKE RULES JOLT OLD LA PUENTE; 
</P>
<P>
3 AGING BUILDINGS IN CENTER OF TOWN MAY BE UNSAFE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The row of sun-baked brick buildings along Main Street has been standing since 
the 1920s, when the town was a ranching and farming community. 
</P>
<P>
Although strip commercial areas with spacious parking lots and shopping areas 
have sprouted up in other parts of the city, the old business district, bounded 
by Glendora Avenue, Old Valley Boulevard, and North 5th Street, has remained 
much the same. 
</P>
<P>
But now the city is warning the owners of 23 unreinforced masonry structures 
downtown that their buildings may be unsafe during an earthquake and must be 
brought up to city standards. The buildings, clustered in the oldest part of La 
Puente and constituting most of the downtown area, would be torn down if left 
unrepaired. 
</P>
<P>
To help owners comply with the city's uniform building code, which requires the 
upgrading of all masonry structures built before 1933, La Puente is offering 
financial assistance in evaluating and renovating the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Under a policy adopted by the City Council on June 16, the city will use 
federal community block grants to help hire a private architectural and 
engineering firm to survey the buildings and determine what work needs to be 
done. It also will offer owners low-interest loans to rehabilitate, demolish or 
rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
The buildings are beginning to show signs of strain from age and the elements, 
but customers still frequent the shops, many of which have been in business for 
several decades. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Osborn and Dwain Laughlin have owned and operated a dry-cleaner, a 
barbershop, and a dress shop on Main between 1st and 2nd streets for 37 years. 
</P>
<P>
Down the block, Leandro LuJan, 58, runs an antique shop filled from floor to 
ceiling with collectibles. Built in 1910, it used to be the city's first 
five-and-dime store, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very, very expensive" to upgrade brick buildings, said Community 
Development Director Rick Hartmann, who proposed the project. "The city of La 
Puente wants to take partnership in that responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Hartmann said the cost of renovation could run as high as $20 per square foot, 
and could be a financial burden on some owners, who have more than one 
building. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to cost me a tremendous amount of money," said Arlie Ellison, 69, 
who owns five buildings on Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what I'm going to do, because I don't have the money necessary," 
he said, standing in front of La Puente Shoe Repair, across the street from the 
barbershop. 
</P>
<P>
Citing two temblors that shook the greater Los Angeles area June 12, Hartmann 
said: "It showed me as well as the city and business owners that this reality 
of an 8-plus earthquake could crumble most of the downtown." 
</P>
<P>
But Laughlin doubts that his buildings are unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
"The buildings have been here a long time. There have been earthquakes, but 
we're still here," Laughlin said while shaving a customer. 
</P>
<P>
Osborn, La Puente's planning commissioner, agreed, saying there was 
"surprisingly little damage" after the October 1987 Whittier earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Under a state law passed in 1986, all cities in designated earthquake zones 
must prepare by Jan. 1, 1990, a list of all masonry commercial buildings built 
before 1933, when the state's first building code was enacted. 
</P>
<P>
The cities must also formally notify the owners that their type of building is 
an earthquake hazard. The law, however, does not force owners to upgrade their 
buildings. La Puente has adopted Los Angeles County's building code, which does 
require upgrading. 
</P>
<P>
Several San Gabriel Valley cities, including Alhambra, Claremont and Pasadena, 
are considering ordinances for upgrading buildings without financial assistance 
to the owners, according to officials in those cities. Ordinances have been 
approved in Azusa, along with Los Angeles, Long Beach, Santa Monica and Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
La Puente will set aside $137,502 in federal block grants for a one-year period 
to fund up to 50% of the cost of evaluating the buildings to determine the 
cost-effectiveness of renovation. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the city has access to $480,000 in block grants designated for 
economic development projects, Hartmann said. 
</P>
<P>
Owners in La Puente have 270 days after notification to decide whether to 
participate in the federal block grant program. 
</P>
<P>
Hartmann said that, if owners ignore the notices, the city would tear down the 
building as a health and safety measure and bill the owner. He added that it 
may be more economically feasible to tear down deteriorated buildings that 
cannot be easily upgraded. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gone into a couple of buildings that we would demolish without 
consideration," he said. "The interior walls had significant cracks, the mortar 
was gone, and the walls were leaning." 
</P>
<P>
But the age of the brick buildings may be what ultimately saves them. 
</P>
<P>
Because La Puente's program is supported by federal funds, it is subject to a 
review by the county Community Development Commission, which reports directly 
to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. If the county 
determines that the area should be a historical landmark, any renovation would 
have to preserve the aesthetic character of the buildings, according to Liz 
Myers, a program manager for the commission. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, the possibility of large-scale repairs or demolition troubles 
Ellison. 
</P>
<P>
"This area means a lot to me," he said. "I've been in business for longer than 
30 years. I will not (demolish) if I can avoid it." 
</P>
<P>
But Maribel Sanchez, 29, who owns and operates Francisco T's, a T-shirt shop, 
said she'd rather raze her 60-year-old building and construct a new one. 
</P>
<P>
"It costs almost the same," Sanchez said. "In fact, it wouldn't be a bad idea 
to change the whole downtown." 
</P>
<P>
A passer-by on Main Street became distraught after finding out the area has 
been declared an earthquake hazard. 
</P>
<P>
"They should just leave (the area) alone, leave this old Puente alone," said 
Connie Lopez, 50, a 26-year resident of La Puente. "There is architecture and 
talent and pride here. This is our only old part, a little touch of yesterday."

BAILEY CANYON'S TRAIL TO NOWHERE; 
</P>
<P>
SIERRA MADRE PLANS TO LINK HIKING PATH TO MT. WILSON ROUTE

SIERRA MADRE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Years ago, many hikers with more enthusiasm than experience would trudge into 
Bailey Canyon, a rugged gorge in the San Gabriel Mountains, only to be rescued 
many hours or days later, lost, cold, hungry and sometimes seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until the late 1960s that hikers could find their way in the canyon 
along a trail that was carved by a small group of teen-age boys who called 
themselves the Sierra Madre Mountaineers. 
</P>
<P>
But the Mountaineers, whose goal was to cut a three-mile zigzag path to Jones 
Peak, a 3,400-foot ridge to the northeast of the canyon, abandoned the task 
when it was two-thirds finished. Today, the map board in Bailey Canyon Park 
labels the final approach to Jones Peak as an "uncompleted trail." But to many 
hikers, "deer path" would be more accurate. 
</P>
<P>
Sierra Madre officials were notified in May that the California State 
Department of Parks and Recreation has approved a proposal by the city to 
finish the job that the Mountaineers started. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Planning Phase 
</P>
<P>
A $50,000 grant will be used to repair the existing trail, complete it to Jones 
Peak and create a new three-mile segment that will link it to the Mt. Wilson 
Trail in Little Santa Anita Canyon. Planning for the project will begin later 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Bailey Canyon was one of the best places for trapping," says Earl Lalone, 64, 
a Sierra Madre native who remembers the canyon from the 1930s and who still 
hikes there. "Up there we would get fox, raccoon, ring-tailed cat and coyote. 
We shipped the pelts to a furrier in Chicago." 
</P>
<P>
With his three brothers, Lalone was among the original members of the Sierra 
Madre Search and Rescue Team. His son, Chris, was one of the Mountaineers in 
the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey Canyon, one of several smaller canyons that slice into the mountains 
between Eaton Canyon on the west and Little Santa Anita Canyon on the east, was 
a logical place for the Mountaineers to create a path. They had grown up 
listening to their fathers, members of the Sierra Madre Search and Rescue Team, 
describe rescue operations in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
And the canyon, which starts at the northern end of Lima Street, was the site 
of a rescue that sparked the formation of the volunteer Search and Rescue Team 
in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
When their sons came up with the plan to aid hikers in Bailey Canyon with the 
trail, their fathers not only encouraged them but served as advisers, along 
with representatives of the U.S. Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
For several years the group got together on weekends and during school 
vacations, putting in hundreds of hours of work cutting switchbacks, or zigzag 
paths, up the east side of the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
They had completed the trail just beyond a point known as "the promontory," a 
spur of land next to the trail that drops off sharply on three sides, leaving a 
small, flat open area. Knee-high stone walls are the only remains of a cabin 
built there in 1910. Here the proposed trail would have climbed eastward, away 
from Bailey Canyon, zigzagging to the top of the peak. 
</P>
<P>
But from the site of the cabin the trail fades rapidly. With more than two 
miles completed -- about 2,000 feet of elevation gain -- the workers abandoned 
their project. 
</P>
<P>
Rae Anderson, whose three sons were members of the Mountaineers, says that as 
the boys became young men, much of their enthusiasm was "diverted to cars and 
girls." To finance their new interests, they found paying summer jobs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fire and Flood Damage 
</P>
<P>
In October, 1978, a fire swept over the ridge and burned Bailey Canyon almost 
to the stream bed near its mouth. Two months later, heavy rains resulted in 
flooding and, because the ground cover had been reduced to ashes, led to 
devastating erosion of the trail. 
</P>
<P>
All things considered, the existing trail is in good shape today. Over the past 
decade, local Boy Scouts and other groups have done intermittent sand-bagging 
work to shore up weak spots along the trail's edge. 
</P>
<P>
Slopes cleared by the 1978 fire have been reclaimed by typical chaparral. The 
canyon is alive again. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as last summer, the Sierra Madre Police Department required hikers 
to obtain a permit to enter the mountains above town during the peak fire 
season. 
</P>
<P>
But since Pasadena, Arcadia and the Angeles National Forest, which border 
Sierra Madre, require no permit, Fire Marshal Bill Kramer said Sierra Madre 
will waive the permit requirement on a one-year, experimental basis. 
</P>
<P>
An advantage to hiking Bailey Canyon is that one does not have to slink across 
back fences or sprint past privately owned beehives to reach the trail. It lies 
entirely on public lands, starting on the edge of Sierra Madre at the end of 
Grove Street. The hiker earns a feeling of accomplishment in the rough terrain 
and is rewarded by lofty overviews of the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Hiking purists do not fear that the trail will be clogged by mountain bikes 
after the city's work on the trail is completed. It is narrow and features 
dozens of hairpin turns. It is what riders call "a carry." 
</P>
<P>
There are disadvantages, too. The present trail does not connect with any 
other. After toiling more than two miles, hikers must turn back or crawl and 
thrash their way over three more miles of manzanita-covered slopes to reach the 
Mt. Wilson Trail. 
</P>
<P>
Jones Peak Trail is not for couch potatoes. It is steep and, as a veteran hiker 
once said, "as crooked as a dog's hind leg." When the sun is high there is 
little shade. 
</P>
<P>
The entrance to the canyon is in Bailey Canyon Park, the upper reaches extend 
well into Angeles National Forest. The start of the trail is reached by passing 
to the west of the flood control basin in Bailey Canyon Park and then, at a 
locked gate, bearing to the left into the mouth of the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The large buildings with red tile roofs visible on the hillside to the west are 
the Passionist Fathers Monastery and Retreat. 
</P>
<P>
Winter flooding over the years has eroded the stream banks near the canyon 
entrance, isolating a short nature loop-trail on a bench of land opposite the 
main trail. The trail winds into the canyon through low brush and a scattering 
of sycamore and oak. 
</P>
<P>
A quarter of a mile beyond the flood control basin, at the foot of a 35-foot 
pine, the trail begins the long ascent to Jones Peak. The slopes are covered by 
thick brush -- mostly manzanita -- and an occasional yucca. The rustling in the 
bushes turns out to be a squirrel, rabbit or scrub jay. Tiny lizards leap away 
at a hiker's approach. 
</P>
<P>
At the cabin ruins, the trail swings away from Bailey Canyon and enters a 
forest of pine and big cone spruce and then ends in thick brush. 
</P>
<P>
When completed, the link to the Mt. Wilson Trail will open up new territory for 
hikers.

TAILOR WINS $2.5 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Armenian tailor from Pasadena won a $2.5-million jackpot on a Fourth of July 
weekend trip to the Barbary Coast hotel-casino on the Las Vegas Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Vartivar Chenorhavorian, whose name in English means "congratulations", dropped 
in three coins, pulled the handle once and hit a $2,578,028 jackpot by lining 
up three Wild Sevens on the bottom line of a Megabucks machine. 
</P>
<P>
Megabucks is a statewide slot machine system linking more than 100 casinos 
throughout Nevada to a giant progressive jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
The winner and his wife, vacationing at the Barbary Coast for the holidays, 
were waiting in line to eat dinner when Chenorhavorian dropped in a few coins 
to pass the time. 
</P>
<P>
Chenorhavorian did not realize he had won the big jackpot until a casino slot 
machine attendant pointed out he was a multimillion-dollar winner. 
</P>
<P>
His wife said she was planning to quit her job. Chenorhavorian said: "Like 
every man, I have dreams -- and now some of my dreams can come true."

COUNCIL DIPS INTO RESERVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has approved a $46-million, "bare bones" budget for the fiscal 
year, but rejected the city administrator's proposal to lay off one staff 
member and reduce salaries of part-time employees by 20%. 
</P>
<P>
City Administrator Julio J. Fuentes had recommended the salary cut and a freeze 
on executive and lower management positions to maintain funding for four police 
officers and four other police personnel. Fuentes also had recommended laying 
off the assistant recreation director. 
</P>
<P>
But after hearing protests last week from a number of employees and residents, 
council members refused to cut back on staff. Instead, the council opted to use 
about a fourth of the city's $484,000 reserve fund to fully fund the positions. 
</P>
<P>
Council members instructed Fuentes to pull the funds from reserves and to seek 
new revenues for the current fiscal year, which began last week.

TORRES VOWS TO CONTINUE FIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
ROADBLOCK TO PASADENA FREEWAY ROUTE TAKES A HIT 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bid to block the routing of the Long Beach Freeway's final leg through South 
Pasadena was dealt a setback last week, but Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) 
immediately vowed to revive his fight before the legislative session ends in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to continue to raise the issue as best as I can," Torres said after 
the Senate on Friday removed his amendment -- aimed at scuttling the 
controversial freeway link -- from compromise transportation legislation. "The 
issue will never be dead," said Torres, whose district includes South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Transportation is finishing an environmental impact 
study on a freeway route that would roughly follow Meridian Avenue in South 
Pasadena and destroy some historic houses in the northern part of the city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Amendment to Bill 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans officials say they expect federal approval in August for the 
6.2-mile-long route, known as the Meridian Variation. Caltrans estimates the 
cost of completion at $425 million, but local opponents of the freeway maintain 
that the price tag eventually could climb to $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Late last week, for almost 24 hours, the freeway dispute jeopardized the 
delicately crafted transportation bill, which includes a 9-cent-a-gallon 
increase in the gasoline tax. 
</P>
<P>
The latest twist in the freeway controversy, which has spanned nearly three 
decades, began in May, when Torres amended a gasoline-tax bill by Sen. Quentin 
Kopp (I-San Francisco). The amendment prohibited the state from spending its 
funds on any state highway in Los Angeles County built through a historically 
significant site or through parks or recreation areas. 
</P>
<P>
However, after the Kopp bill incorporating Torres' proposal was sent to the 
Assembly, it was overhauled and melded into transportation legislation by 
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar). In negotiations between state officials 
and legislators over the transportation package, the Torres amendment was 
removed from the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
But, Torres said, he did not discover that the language had been dropped until 
a Democratic colleague told him last week. So, last Thursday night he revived 
his amendment by persuading the Senate Appropriations Committee to insert it 
into the Katz transportation compromise. 
</P>
<P>
An angry Katz said the Torres proposal violated the spirit of the negotiations 
over the transportation legislation. "Art is trying to carve out a special 
niche for himself," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
During the Senate floor debate Friday on the amendment, Kopp termed the 
proposal a "deal breaker" and questioned whether Deukmejian would sign the 
transportation compromise if the Torres amendment remained in the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, other opponents predicted that the amendment could affect as many as 
16 other freeway projects in the county. After several hours of intense 
lobbying, Kopp succeeded in removing the amendment on a 24-13 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Torres maintained that "Deukmejian put incredible pressure on the 
members, saying he will not sign the bill unless the language is deleted." 
</P>
<P>
A Deukmejian Administration official, who asked not to be identified, confirmed 
that the Torres amendment would have been "a deal breaker" and maintained that 
it had no support in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Awareness of Issue' 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Ochoa, lobbyist for South Pasadena, acknowledged that chances of winning 
legislative approval for the Torres proposal before the session ends in 
September are slim. But, he said, "we have been able to buy some time for the 
city of South Pasadena." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, South Pasadena Councilwoman Evelyn Fierro said she was not surprised 
at the outcome of Torres' efforts. But Fierro, who lobbied on behalf of the 
Torres amendment last week in Sacramento, added that she was pleased "it got as 
far as it got. It brought an awareness of the issue to the Legislature." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Newton Russell (R-Pasadena), who opposed the Torres amendment, cautioned 
Monday that Torres could still insert his proposal into another bill. Russell 
said he would continue to raise objections, citing opposition from his Pasadena 
constituents.

COMPLEX FOR ELDERLY OPENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 241-unit senior-citizen apartment complex with 20% of its units reserved for 
low-income residents opened last week in Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
Heritage Park Monrovia is the first and largest of five complexes being built 
in a $57.5-million joint venture between Calmark Development Corp. and the 
nonprofit Corporate Fund for Housing. 
</P>
<P>
Monthly rents for the low-income apartments, based on the tenants' income, 
start at $380 for one-bedroom units and $427 for two-bedroom units. The maximum 
rent for the rest of the apartments is $525 for one-bedroom units and $670 for 
two-bedroom units. 
</P>
<P>
Similar projects will be completed in Diamond Bar, La Verne, Whittier and 
Lakewood by next January, constituting 845 affordable housing units for 
seniors, according to Mario Guerra, spokesman for the Southern California Assn. 
of Governments. 
</P>
<P>
SCAG was instrumental in the creation of the Corporate Fund for Housing with a 
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development grant in 1984 to create more 
affordable housing in Southern California. Over the next 20 years, the county's 
population of senior citizens is expected to more than double, according to 
SCAG projections. 
</P>
<P>
Because it is nonprofit, the fund can issue tax-exempt bonds and finance the 
developments at a lower cost, said Project Manager Scott Kutner. 
</P>
<P>
"The main benefit is that the fund owns the projects, and long-term 
affordability (of the apartments) is assured," he said.

MARY LETOURNEAU, COVINA HIGH SOFTBALL PITCHER, HAILED AS 3-A PLAYER OF YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pitcher Mary Letourneau, who led Covina High to its first CIF Southern Section 
girls softball title in June, has been named 3-A Division Player of the Year by 
the Southern Section Softball Advisory Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Letourneau, a senior, completed her brilliant prep career with a 2-0 shutout 
over Mission Viejo in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
On the season, Letourneau finished with 19 shutouts, five no-hitters and four 
perfect games. She posted a 23-0-1 record and an 0.17 earned-run average with 
289 strikeouts in 167 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Letourneau will attend Cal State Long Beach on a softball scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
Covina, which went through a 26-0-1 season, was also honored with the selection 
of Rocky Buccola as 3-A Coach of the Year. It was the second title for Buccola, 
who guided South Hills to a Southern Section championship in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Two other Covina players made the CIF squad: freshman catcher Cynthia Escobedo 
and junior infielder Rebecca Montes. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve other San Gabriel Valley players were named to All-CIF teams. 
</P>
<P>
The only other valley player named to the 3-A team was junior infielder Tristin 
Alfred of Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
Sierra League champion Diamond Bar placed senior pitcher Bonnie Ebenkamp, 
senior infielder Elizabeth Sirchia and junior infielder Shannon Stec on the 4-A 
team. Junior infielder Kelly Hunt of Charter Oak also made the team. 
</P>
<P>
Temple City infielders Penny Saunders and Jennifer Woolery made the 2-A team 
along with senior pitcher Carolyn Hawkins of South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena Poly has junior outfielder Anne Devereau and senior pitcher Jennifer 
Bennett on the 1-A team. Senior infielder Amy Schroeder of Western Christian 
and freshman pitcher Chenda Chavez of Azusa also were selected. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Fenison, an assistant coach at Cal Poly Pomona last season, has been named 
an assistant coach for men's basketball at Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
Before coaching at Pomona, Fenison was an assistant at Chaffey College for one 
year and junior varsity coach at Azusa Pacific University for three seasons. He 
played for Mt. Sac during the 1977-78 and 1978-79 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Sac struggled to an 8-20 record and fifth place in the South Coast 
Conference last season. But Fenison, 29, thinks the prospects are better for 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a talented group of guys but we have to work harder and hone our 
skills because we're in such a tough conference," he said. "We have to 
re-establish ourselves as a winning team. We can't worry about the other teams. 
We have to concentrate on what we're doing. Once we do that, we'll go a long 
way next season. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Dominguez Hills has signed three San Gabriel Valley baseball players 
to letters of intent: pitcher Vince Aguilar and outfielder/pitcher Doug Brown 
from Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut and pitcher Armando Plascencia from 
Nogales High in La Puente. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills Coach George Wing, whose team finished with a 16-29-2 overall 
record and was last in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. last season, 
thinks Aguilar can help his team next year. 
</P>
<P>
Aguilar, who will be a junior, posted a 6-5 record and 3.13 earned-run average 
with 65 strikeouts in 95 innings at Mt. Sac. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who will be a junior, spent most of his time at Mt. Sac as an 
outfielder. He batted .295 as a sophomore and .308 as a freshman. As a pitcher, 
he had no record in eight innings as a reliever last season but is considered 
to have an excellent fastball. 
</P>
<P>
Plascencia, a three-time All-Sierra League selection at Nogales, completed an 
outstanding career with the Nobles by posting a 7-2 record and 2.14 ERA last 
season. In the last two seasons, he piled up 137 strikeouts in 140 innings. 
</P>
<P>
The Muir High boys basketball team will compete in the 16-team Slam-N-Jam 
Carson Grand Finale tournament today through Saturday at Carson High. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs, who reached the final 16 of the 128-team L.A. Games tournament in 
June, will compete in pool play at 12:20 p.m. today against Oceanside and at 
4:20 Friday against Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
Muir is led by front-line players LaDay Smith, Erid Scott and Jermaine Davis -- 
all 6-6 -- and 6-2 guard Phillip Turner. 
</P>
<P>
Among other top teams in the tournament are Long Beach Poly, Lynwood, 
Cleveland, Marina, Lakewood and Ocean View. 
</P>
<P>
The top teams in each pool will advance to the semifinals at 1:10 and 2:30 p.m. 
Saturday. The championship game is at 7:30.

CAP CITIES/ABC WINS WAIVER OF ONE-TO-A-MARKET FCC REGULATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McDOUGAL and Wm. K. KNOEDELSEDER Jr., Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Federal Communications Commission has granted Capital Cities/ABC Inc. a 
permanent waiver to FCC rules that might have forced the New York-based media 
giant to sell valuable broadcast properties in major cities, including KABC-TV 
and radio stations KABC-AM and KLOS-FM in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In relaxing its so-called one-to-a-market rule, the FCC is allowing Capital 
Cities to retain ownership of the three Los Angeles stations; WABC-TV, WABC-AM 
and WPLJ-FM in New York; WLS-TV, WLS-AM and WYTZ-FM, Chicago, and KGO-TV and 
KGO-AM, San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Though the granting of such a permanent waiver is the first action of its kind, 
it was not unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
In March, the FCC loosened the rules that prohibited a company from owning both 
a radio station and a television station in the same television "market," 
saying that the commissioners would look favorably upon waiver requests 
involving radio and television station combinations in the largest 25 broadcast 
markets in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The commission said it would grant waivers if there were more than 30 
separately owned, operated and controlled broadcast licensees, or "voices," in 
a market. Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest market, for example, is home 
to more than 80 radio stations and 19 television stations. 
</P>
<P>
In a 3-0 ruling made public Wednesday, the commission said Capital Cities had 
successfully shown that their stations were located in four of the five largest 
markets in the country and that more than 30 separate companies owned stations 
in those markets. According to the FCC, there are 94 separate broadcast owners 
in New York, 105 in Chicago, 79 in Los Angeles and 57 in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Capital Cities was among three companies that asked for such a waiver. The 
commission has not ruled on the other two, Boston-based New England Television 
and Great American Broadcasting of Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
When Capital Cities and ABC merged in 1985, the FCC granted an 18-month waiver 
to the one-to-a-market, or "cross-ownership," rule. Stockholders were told that 
the two companies would sell off radio and television stations to meet the rule 
and a second FCC requirement stipulating that a single company can own TV 
stations that reach no more than 25% of the viewing public. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sales in Connecticut, Florida 
</P>
<P>
The two companies owned 12 TV stations and 24 radio stations, and before the 
$3.5-billion merger was completed in January, 1986, they sold four TV stations, 
eight radio stations and Capital Cities' cable television division for a total 
price of about $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Among the sales were WTNH-TV, New Haven, Conn., sold for $170 million; WXYZ-TV, 
Detroit, and WFTS-TV, Tampa, Fla., $246 million; WKBW-TV, Buffalo, N.Y., $65 
million, and KLAC-AM and KZLA-FM, Los Angeles, $43 million. 
</P>
<P>
But before the 18-month waiver period expired, the commission announced that it 
was considering allowing common ownership in the larger TV markets. Capital 
Cities requested another extension of the temporary waiver, and then a 
permanent waiver for its holdings in the four large markets. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we can expect to see more broadcasters lining up at the commission's 
office asking for these waivers," said Patrick M. Clawson, Washington bureau 
chief of the trade publication Radio and Records. "The economic impact is 
significant in that the commission is allowing further concentration of 
ownership in the nation's top media markets."

THE AMBASSADOR HOTEL HAS BEEN SOLD. BUT WHETHER THE L.A. LANMARK WILL SURVIVE 
INTACT IS IN DOUBT.

<P>
The historic Ambassador Hotel, which closed its doors in January, has been sold 
to an investment group headed by a New York developer, but the fate of the 
68-year-old hotel, once an oasis for Hollywood's rich and famous, remained 
unclear Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Anglo-Wilshire Partners, a California general partnership, reached an agreement 
over the weekend to purchase the 23.5-acre Mid-Wilshire hotel property from 
Ambassador Hotel Properties for an undisclosed price, but the sale was not 
disclosed until Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The property, valued at $65 million to $75 million, is considered one of the 
last open spaces in urban Los Angeles available for large-scale development. 
The 510-room hotel, which occupies about one-third of the property, was put up 
for sale in 1986 by the heirs of the J. Myer Schine family. Schine, who died in 
1971, was a theater and hotel magnate who bought the Ambassador in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mixed-Use Project 
</P>
<P>
"We can't say what will happen to the hotel; it has not yet been determined," 
said Scott Malkin, president of S. D. Malkin Properties, in a telephone 
interview from New York. His firm, which also has offices in Beverly Hills, is 
acting general partner of Anglo-Wilshire Partners. 
</P>
<P>
He said the initial development concept calls for a mixed-use, 
residential-commercial project that may include a hotel. "We are not ruling out 
a hotel project," he said. His group, which has been working on the purchase 
for a year, will work on the development concept once escrow closes on the 
property in mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
In its heyday, the Ambassador Hotel hosted Hollywood stars and movie moguls, 
U.S. presidents and European royalty. It was home for the once-famous Coconut 
Grove night club. Marion Davies once rode a horse through the Ambassador lobby 
to amuse her lover, William Randolph Hearst. Marilyn Monroe attended class in 
the hotel at the Emmaline Snively Blue Book Modeling Agency. Robert F. Kennedy 
was assassinated there June 6, 1968, the night he won the California Democratic 
presidential primary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Renovation Costs Prohibitive 
</P>
<P>
The hotel, which cost $5 million to build in the late 1910s, is not officially 
designated as a historic landmark. However, the Schine family had an agreement 
with the City of Los Angeles that protects the hotel buildings from speculative 
demolition without full and final city approval on a replacement project. The 
agreement runs with the title to the new owners. 
</P>
<P>
The Schine family had studied the possibility of renovating the hotel, but the 
costs -- estimated at $10 million to $30 million -- were prohibitive. The hotel 
lost about $7 million between 1983 and 1987, according to a spokesman for the 
Ambassador Hotel Properties. 
</P>
<P>
The site was explored by the Los Angeles Unified School District as a 
possibility for a new high school and commercial development, but again, the 
costs were prohibitive. Another possible use of the hotel involved converting 
it into senior citizen housing. 
</P>
<P>
Urban Innovations Group, an affiliate of the Graduate School of Architecture 
and Urban Planning at UCLA, has recommended a mixed-use commercial and 
residential project for the property that would include a 40-story office tower 
and a six-story hotel along with upscale to low-cost housing. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilshire Stakeholders Group, a nonprofit Mid-Wilshire community 
organization, and the city of Los Angeles have funded the study to determine 
how to develop the property into an anchor and catalyst for the revival of the 
Mid-Wilshire area. 
</P>
<P>
"We understand and appreciate the important role this property will play in the 
revival of the Mid-Wilshire corridor," Malkin said. "In developing our plans 
for this exceptional property, we will be seeking input from all members of the 
community and city officials, and we intend to work closely with all interested 
parties, including the Wilshire Stakeholders Group, toward the creation of an 
urban master plan that will be the right project in the right place at the 
right time." 
</P>
<P>
Malkin is a member of the New York Malkin family, which has interests in more 
than 20 million square feet of commercial space nationwide, including the 
Empire State Building. In Los Angeles, S. D. Malkin Properties is a partner in 
Two Rodeo Associates, which is building a 130,000-square-foot retail project 
anchored by Tiffany &amp; Co. at Wilshire Boulevard and Rodeo Drive in Beverly 
Hills.

Vestron Defaults on Loan: Vestron Inc., a producer and distribution of motion 
pictures, video and television entertainment, said it had failed to make 
payment on a $25-million note owed to Wells Fargo Bank. In San Francisco, a 
spokeswoman for Wells Fargo said the bank had sent a notice of default to 
Vestron because the company had not met the July 3 maturity date on the note. 
Vestron said it was "actively negotiating" with other financial institutions to 
come up with funds to satisfy its obligations and working capital requirements.

GATT Meeting Postponed: A GATT meeting to consider a bid by China to join the

special working party that has been studying China's application since its 
submission three years ago was scheduled to meet next week to discuss the terms 
of a draft document for China's possible accession to the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade. The meeting was put off with China's agreement, and a date

AMERICAN STORES' MERGER OF LUCKY, ALPHA BETA OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American Stores said Wednesday that it will be allowed to merge its Lucky and 
Alpha Beta supermarket chains on July 10 because a federal appeals court had 
rejected a challenge by California Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
However, a special assistant to Van de Kamp indicated that the attorney general 
will appeal the antitrust case to the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
American Stores said in a statement that the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals 
in San Francisco decided Monday not to grant the attorney general's request for 
a rehearing of a March 31 appeals court ruling that would have allowed the 
merger to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
The decision is the latest development in a long-running battle that has 
frustrated American Stores' effort to reap the benefits of its $2.5-billion 
purchase of Lucky Stores. The acquisition made American Stores, based in Salt 
Lake City, the nation's largest supermarket operator. 
</P>
<P>
When American Stores bought its Dublin, Calif., rival last year, it planned to 
operate its lackluster Alpha Beta chain under the Lucky banner. Lucky has a 
strong reputation as a low-price leader. 
</P>
<P>
American Stores vowed at the time to adhere to Lucky's low-price strategy and 
to pass along savings in advertising and other expenses. The company has said 
the merger could result in savings of as much as $60 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
But as American was on the verge of merging the chains, the attorney general on 
Sept. 1 launched his challenge on the grounds that the consolidation would 
reduce competition and result in higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Strumwasser, the special assistant attorney general, said Wednesday: 
"We are not giving up. We've expected all along that if necessary we would take 
this to the Supreme Court." The first step, he said, would be to ask the 
appeals court to temporarily block the July 10 merger. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Rothman, a Los Angeles-based attorney for American Stores, noted that the 
Supreme Court has adjourned for this session and probably would not be able to 
rule until October. 
</P>
<P>
"So the question now is, will the 9th Circuit give any relief to the attorney 
general?" Rothman added. "They'll have to move very quickly, because come July 
10 we're free to go."

OPEC nations boosted their crude oil production in June to its highest level so 
far this year, surpassing the cartel's self-imposed output ceiling, according 
to estimates released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The International Energy Agency said in its Monthly Oil Market Report that the 
13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped about 21.3 
million barrels of crude a day last month, up 200,000 barrels a day from May. 
</P>
<P>
The rise lifted second-quarter production to about 21 million barrels a day, 
topping OPEC's self-imposed 19.5 million-barrel daily production limit. It also 
was the highest for the April-June period since the 23.2 million barrels a day 
produced in that quarter of 1981.

NO QUICK SALE OF CONS GOLD UNITS SEEN

<P>
Lord Hanson, the tycoon who is about to clinch the biggest deal in British 
corporate history, is expected to move slowly to restructure mining group 
Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, industry analysts said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
After 10 days of hard bargaining, Hanson PLC on Tuesday agreed to pay $5.5 
billion (3.5 billion pounds) for Cons Gold, founded more than a century ago by 
British empire builder Cecil Rhodes. Both companies' shareholders are expected 
to endorse the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"It is sad to see the loss of independence of a great British company such as 
Gold Fields," Rudolph Agnew, its chairman, said in a statement accepting the 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
Cons Gold fought off a similar offer by Minerals &amp; Resources Corp. in May 
after a lengthy legal battle. Minorco is the overseas investment arm of South 
African financier Harry Oppenheimer's gold and diamonds empire. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson PLC, one of Britain's 10 largest firms, is a multinational conglomerate 
with interests ranging from Eveready batteries and Smith-Corona typewriters to 
Jacuzzi whirlpool baths and Ground Round restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very good deal for Hanson," said one broker at London brokerage 
Kleinwort Benson. "He's not paying any more cash, and Cons Gold's shareholders 
should be reasonably happy." 
</P>
<P>
Hanson said he expected discussions to begin shortly on Cons Gold's future 
structure and policies, but analysts did not expect him to move quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"Hanson won't be a forced seller," said analyst Andy Quinn at brokerage James 
Capel. "He might not want to sell the gold assets now but rather wait for the 
next upswing in price." 
</P>
<P>
Alan Richards at Barclays de Zoete Wedd said he did not foresee a quick sale of 
Cons Gold assets. 
</P>
<P>
"Hanson has a track record of holding onto these things for several years 
before selling them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson is expected to retain ARC, Cons Gold's building materials subsidiary, 
which extracts 45 million tons of hard rock every year from British quarries. 
</P>
<P>
ARC, seen as a valuable gem in the Cons Gold treasure chest, would dovetail 
nicely with Hanson's building products businesses. It also has strong earnings 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts also said Hanson could keep Cons Gold's Australian associate Renison 
Goldfields Consolidated Ltd. Renison's AMC division is one of the world's 
largest suppliers of high-grade feed stock for titanium dioxide pigment 
production. 
</P>
<P>
"Hanson's SCM Chemicals is a major titanium dioxide producer," said analyst Liz 
Dhillon at broker W. I. Carr. "It is a possible retention." 
</P>
<P>
But Dhillon cited Minorco as a possible buyer of Gold Fields Mining Corp. in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
And Hanson almost certainly would seek a buyer for Cons Gold's 38% interest in 
Gold Fields of South Africa Ltd. for political reasons, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
There is a question mark over Newmont Mining Corp., Cons Gold's 49%-owned U.S. 
gold producer. 
</P>
<P>
Lord Hanson, often pictured escorting Hollywood stars such as Audrey Hepburn in 
the 1950s, has a formidable reputation for winning takeover battles and is 
outspoken for his right-wing political views.

ROCKWELL PAYS $820,000 CIVIL FINE IN DEFENSE CONTRACT CASE

Rockwell International Corp. on Wednesday paid the federal government more than 
$800,000 to settle civil claims arising from the firm's conviction earlier this 
year on charges of overbilling the Air Force for a satellite navigation system. 
</P>
<P>
The company has now paid nearly $1.27 million to satisfy federal court 
judgments in the case, which require the aerospace contractor to pay about 
$820,000 in civil penalties, $446,000 in restitution and $5.5 million in 
criminal fines. The $5.5 million is the largest fine levied in a defense 
procurement fraud case. 
</P>
<P>
In January, Rockwell pleaded guilty to overbilling the Air Force $500,000 on 
the $1.2-billion NAVSTAR global positioning system, by which civilian and 
military planes, ships and land vehicles can use radio signals broadcast by 
satellites to fix their exact location. 
</P>
<P>
The $5.5-million criminal penalty, which the company has already paid, was 
imposed March 6 by Los Angeles U.S. District Judge Consuelo B. Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
A company spokesman said the $820,000 civil fine was not unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of Rockwell's guilty plea, company lawyers contended that the 
overcharges came to light as a result of an internal investigation. It said the 
fraud was carried out by two former executives of Rockwell's satellite systems 
division. 
</P>
<P>
The government accused Rockwell of obtaining secret reimbursement for 
unexpected repair costs on the NAVSTAR project from a subcontractor and then 
billing the Air Force for the same costs. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment included a conspiracy count alleging that Rockwell tried to 
cover up the fraud when federal auditors began asking questions. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell said at the time that the company was not guilty of any wrongdoing, 
but that under law it must accept responsibility for criminal acts committed by 
its employees while representing the company.

1ST CITY BANCORP SEEKS FDIC'S STAKE

First City Bancorp Texas Inc. wants to buy the 18% stake in the bank held by 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. or help find another buyer for the 
interest, a move aimed at freeing the bank to proceed with acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
FDIC, which regulates commercial banks, has held the stake -- estimated to be 
worth up to $100 million -- since April, 1988, when the troubled Houston-based 
bank was rescued with government help and a reorganization plan was put into 
place. 
</P>
<P>
A. Robert Abboud, First City's chairman and chief executive since the 
reorganization, said in a statement that the transaction "would provide us with 
greater flexibility to pursue our expansion plans." 
</P>
<P>
But industry analysts say there is little to indicate that First City would 
fare any better in its bidding for bank assets now under federal control even 
if it did buy back the FDIC stake. 
</P>
<P>
"The least of its disadvantages is the FDIC ownership," said analyst Robert 
Rieke of the Dallas investment firm Rauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc. 
</P>
<P>
First City officials Wednesday would neither confirm nor deny that the bank 
planned to submit bids for two remaining Texas banking companies for which 
federal regulators are seeking buyers.

President Bush expressed pleasure today that Oliver L. North was not sentenced 
to jail for his Iran-Contra convictions, but sidestepped a question about 
whether he has considered pardoning the former White House aide. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy he's not going to jail," Bush said in answer to a question during an 
interview with a group of journalists. "I'm not going to comment further 
because this matter is under appeal and is in the federal courts." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell sentenced North on Wednesday to a 
three-year suspended sentence, two years' probation, $150,000 in fines and 
1,200 hours of community service work.

Gorbachev's Call Deflected 
</P>
<P>
On another topic, Bush deflected Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's call 
for swift negotiations over short-range nuclear weapons, noting that NATO 
leaders agreed not to entertain such talks until an accord has been reached on 
conventional forces. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to get off track" by reopening the issue of short-range nuclear 
forces that Western leaders agreed to in Brussels in May, Bush said in a 
nationally televised session with foreign reporters designed to set the stage 
for his European journey Sunday, 
</P>
<P>
In a speech earlier in the day in Strasbourg, France, Gorbachev offered to make 
additional and rapid cuts in his country's nuclear arsenal if NATO accepts 
negotiations on tactical nuclear weapons. (Story, Page 2.) 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he hoped to use his visits to Poland and Hungary to nudge both 
Communist-controlled countries toward democracy. 
</P>
<P>
He insisted that he is not trying to stir up trouble in Gorbachev's back yard, 
saying, "That is not what 1989 diplomacy is about."

KEMP CITES ABUSES, HALTS ELDERLY HOUSING PROGRAM

HUD Secretary Jack Kemp today suspended a housing program for the elderly that 
has cost the government more than $119 million in losses, as he struggled to 
clean up mismanagement and abuse within the agency dating from the Ronald 
Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp announced he was halting new and pending applications for the Retirement 
Service Center program, saying that in addition to costing the government 
millions it has failed to serve the low-income elderly for whom it was 
designed. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third troubled program Kemp has placed on hold since taking over the 
reins of the Department of Housing and Urban Development earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the latest suspension, Kemp said that in addition to direct 
losses, the program has incurred loan defaults in excess of $250 million. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a program that should serve low-income people but instead is serving 
upper- and middle-income persons -- and doing it very poorly at that," he said. 
"I plan a complete redesign of the Retirement Service Center program and will 
require that it be targeted to low- and moderate-income elderly." 
</P>
<P>
About 30% of the projects that received HUD funding since the program was 
launched in 1983 are in default, the department said. Many were built in areas 
where there was not a sufficient shortage in housing for the elderly to support 
the projects, officials added.

SANTA ANA ROBBERY SUSPECT SHOT

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Santa Ana police officer shot a robbery suspect in the leg at about 2:30 a.m. 
today, hours after three men held up the Bobkin Bar at 2521 S. Main St. and 
fled with $150. 
</P>
<P>
The wounded man was identified as Ramon Soto, 20, of Santa Ana, said Santa Ana 
police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas. He was treated at Western Medical Center and 
transferred to the Orange County Jail, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Police did not release the name of the officer. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began when three men walked into the bar at 11:15 p.m. Wednesday 
and stole $150, Thomas said. Police investigators who had been called to the 
scene found an AK-47 that was apparently used during the robbery and obtained 
the address of one of the suspects from a customer, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
They went to the address in Santa Ana, and Soto confronted them at the 
driveway, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
"Officers told him to stop, but he fled on foot, and they continued asking him 
to stop," Thomas said. "One of our officers fired one shot from his shotgun. It 
struck the suspect in the leg." 
</P>
<P>
Two other suspects were arrested at the address. Thomas declined to immediately 
release their names, saying that "it would hamper an ongoing investigation."

Ministers of the center-left Labor Party today postponed a special meeting in 
which they were to have considered pulling out of the government. 
</P>
<P>
The party acted after 12 people were killed when a Palestinian grabbed the 
steering wheel of a bus and caused it to plunge into a ravine. 
</P>
<P>
Three left-wing parties filed no-confidence motions against the government in 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Avi Gil, a spokesman for Labor leader and Finance Minister Shimon Peres, said 
the party's 100-member bureau will convene Monday to decide what course of 
action to take. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir explicitly ruled out a chief condition of Palestinians, the 
participation of 140,000 Arabs in East Jerusalem in the elections. He also 
rejected establishment of a Palestinian state and said the balloting could not 
be held until the Palestinian uprising ended. 
</P>
<P>
In Tunis, Tunisia, Palestine Liberation Organization spokesman Ahmed 
Abdul-Rahman today said Shamir's hard-line conditions have closed the door to 
peace, and he vowed that the uprising of Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied 
West Bank and Gaza Strip would be "escalated because this is the only answer to 
intransigence."

George Bush's quick comebacks during his explosive interview with Dan Rather 
last year were not entirely off the cuff, a new book says. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the presidential candidate's responses came from cue cards scrawled 
by media consultant Roger Ailes, CBS correspondent Bob Schieffer and Gary Paul 
Gates say. 
</P>
<P>
Excerpts from their book, "The Acting President: Ronald Reagan and the 
Supporting Players Who Helped Him Create the Illusion That Held America 
Spellbound," appear in the July 8 issue of TV Guide. 
</P>
<P>
During the live, January, 1988, interview, then-Vice President Bush told 
Rather, who had been questioning him on his role in the Iran-Contra affair: 
"It's not fair to judge my whole career by a rehash on Iran. How would you like 
it if I judged your career by those seven minutes when you walked off the set 
in New York?" 
</P>
<P>
Bush referred to Rather's walk-off from the CBS set in 1987 when a tennis match 
ran into news time. It caused the network to "go black" for six minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"What people in the bureau and viewers at home could not see was that the 
response had not been entirely spontaneous. As the interview progressed, the 
crafty Ailes had stationed himself beside the camera," Schieffer and Gates 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"If Bush seemed to be struggling for a response, Ailes would write out a key 
word in huge letters on his yellow legal pad and hold it just beneath the 
camera in Bush's line of vision. 
</P>
<P>
"Just before Bush had shouted that it was not fair to judge his career on Iran, 
Ailes had written out on his legal pad the words not fair to judge career ... 
Yours. Three times during the interview, Bush's answer had come after Ailes had 
prompted him with key words or phrases scribbled on the legal pad." 
</P>
<P>
Schieffer and Gates said that before the interview Bush had been stirred up by 
aides who wanted to end the candidate's image as a "wimp."

GORBACHEV TIES CUT IN A-ARMS TO NATO ACTION

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today offered additional and rapid cuts 
in his country's nuclear arsenal if NATO accepts negotiations on tactical 
nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's proposal, contained in a speech to the Council of Europe's assembly 
in this eastern French city, appeared designed to increase pressure on the 
United States to agree to the talks, an issue that caused a deep rift in the 
Western alliance that was patched over last month. 
</P>
<P>
"If it became clear that NATO countries are ready to join us in negotiations on 
tactical nuclear weapons, we could, naturally, after consulting our allies, 
carry out without delay further unilateral reductions in our tactical nuclear 
missiles in Europe," Gorbachev told the assembly, which contains 
parliamentarians from 23 Western European democracies. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev did not say how many missiles the Soviets would cut. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the Gorbachev 
statement had been anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
"We welcome any unilateral reductions" in the Soviet's nuclear arsenal, 
Fitzwater said. But he added that the Bush Administration will stand by its own 
proposal on East-West force reductions in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
NATO last month agreed to link any future negotiations on tactical nuclear arms 
to results obtained at the Vienna talks seeking Europe-wide reductions in 
conventional weaponry, a step the Soviets have said will cause delay. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's announcement, made from the podium at the ultramodern Palace of 
Europe, seemed designed to force a break in that link. 
</P>
<P>
In his 45-minute speech, Gorbachev also said the social and political order in 
Europe could change, the farthest he has gone in suggesting that the Kremlin 
would one day be ready to tolerate multiparty democracies in its Eastern 
allies. 
</P>
<P>
He also proposed a series of projects both Eastern and Western Europeans could 
take part in, including a high-speed railway spanning the Continent, an 
all-European TV satellite system and a program for processing and storing 
nuclear wastes.

The government today extended tough censorship laws to foreign media and said 
security forces can shoot Sinhalese radicals engaging in violence or putting up 
anti-government posters. 
</P>
<P>
"No news whatsoever can go out of this country without being censored," Foreign 
Minister Rajan Wijeratne told a news conference. "If you cannot conform to 
that, please leave the country." 
</P>
<P>
"I will cancel your visas and deport you if you violate the censorship," he 
told reporters, who included several foreign correspondents. "If I decide to 
cancel a visa, no appeals will be considered." 
</P>
<P>
The government blames Sinhalese militants for at least 3,500 killings since 
they launched an anti-government campaign in July, 1987, to protest peace 
overtures being made to separatist Tamil rebels.

New York's highest court ruled today that a partner in a long-term homosexual 
relationship can take over the couple's rent-controlled apartment when the 
lover who signed the lease dies. 
</P>
<P>
In a 4-2 ruling, the Court of Appeals ordered a lower court to reconsider its 
decision to evict a New York City man from a rent-controlled apartment he 
shared for a decade with his now-dead lover. 
</P>
<P>
In doing so, the court expanded the definition of a "family" as it applies to 
New York's rent-control laws. The word is crucial because state law says only 
"family members" may take over rent-controlled apartments when the tenant of 
record dies. The court said that the definition should include adults who show 
long-term financial and emotional commitment to each other, even if they do not 
fit the traditional meaning of a "family." 
</P>
<P>
Today's decision is the first time any top state court in the nation has 
recognized a gay couple to be the legal equivalent of a family, according to 
American Civil Liberties Union lawyer William Rubenstein, who argued the case.

Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. and Price Waterhouse announced today they have 
initiated formal talks about a merger of their worldwide operations, which 
would create the world's largest accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
The two firms issued a news release confirming published reports about the 
talks and that a confidentiality agreement will be in effect for 60 days while 
a merger is explored. 
</P>
<P>
A joint statement by Joseph E. Connor, chairman of Price Waterhouse World Firm, 
and Lawrence E. Weinbach, chief executive of Arthur Andersen, said the the 
globalization of world economies, accelerating technological changes and demand 
for new services and investments have created the need for increased worldwide 
professional and financial resources that would enable the firms to serve their 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors have circulated for weeks that Chicago-based Arthur Andersen and New 
York's Price Waterhouse, two of the industry's Big Eight companies, were 
looking for ways to combine. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, approval was won for the merger of Ernst &amp; Whinney and 
Arthur Young &amp; Co. accounting firms. The resulting company is expected to 
have worldwide revenue of $4.2 billion and domestic revenue of $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
If Arthur Andersen and Price Waterhouse merge, they are expected to take in $5 
billion annually worldwide and $2.7 billion in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Andersen is the leading U.S. accounting firm and the world's 
second-biggest with international revenue last year of $2.8 billion. It employs 
45,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Price Waterhouse is the fifth-largest in the nation and the fourth worldwide, 
with international revenue of $2.2 billion. It has a payroll of 39,000 people.

U.S. BANS ASBESTOS, ENDING LONG DEBATE;

MANUFACTURE OF MOST PRODUCTS TO HALT IN 7 YEARS

<P>
The government today ordered a ban on almost all uses of asbestos, ending a 
decade-long debate over the health risk posed by the cancer-causing substance 
in such items as brake linings and water pipes. 
</P>
<P>
The regulatory action, which will end the manufacture of most asbestos products 
in three phases over the next seven years, will not affect asbestos products 
already in use. Officials said replacing some of those products might be more 
hazardous than a gradual phase-out. 
</P>
<P>
"This is pollution prevention. We're eliminating a known cancer-causing 
substance from the marketplace," declared EPA Administrator William K. Reilly. 
He said despite government attempts to curb asbestos emissions, the fibers 
continue to pose "a significant risk to current and future populations." 
</P>
<P>
Reilly said the cost of getting asbestos out of most products will be minimal 
because safer alternative products are available. The EPA estimated the 
regulation will cost society $459 million over 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
The regulatory action does not affect ongoing efforts to rid buildings, 
including hundreds of schools, of asbestos insulation. Reilly said such efforts 
should continue under careful control to minimize exposure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
To Remain in a Few Items 
</P>
<P>
Under the new ban, the EPA will allow asbestos to be a component in only a 
small number of items such as guided missile liners, acetylene cylinders, and 
some types of sealant tape and packaging. 
</P>
<P>
But the ban by 1997 will cover an estimated 94% by volume of all asbestos used 
in a variety of products currently manufactured, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Among those products are automobile brake pads and linings, cement water 
distribution pipes, roofing shingles, floor and pipe wrapping, asbestos 
millboard, gaskets and other construction products. 
</P>
<P>
Because asbestos has been singled out as a cause of lung cancer, its use has 
been restricted in recent years. Loosely formed asbestos insulation for 
buildings and pipes no longer is used, and asbestos emissions into the air are 
regulated. 
</P>
<P>
School officials across the country have been directed to inspect for asbestos 
and develop plans to eliminate it from school buildings. 
</P>
<P>
But asbestos continues to be used in various forms for a wide variety of 
products. As recently as 1987 it was estimated that 85,000 tons of asbestos 
went into hundreds of products annually. Three years earlier the estimates were 
240,000 tons a year. 
</P>
<P>
Its use has continued, although scientists have known for years that asbestos 
fibers when inhaled can cause lung cancer and other lung disorders that may not 
show up for decades. 
</P>
<P>
But while there is widespread agreement about the health risks from loosely 
packed asbestos found in building insulation or from high-levels of certain 
occupational exposure, the risks posed from its other uses have been debated 
for nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The final EPA rule does not affect products already in use such as asbestos

RISE IN RETAIL SALES MAY END WITH JUNE GAINS, ANALYSTS SAY

The nation's major retailers today reported that store sales rose modestly in 
June, but analysts said the month's solid performance may be the last in an 
increasingly lackluster year. 
</P>
<P>
While Wall Street analysts said the June gains will help retailers salvage 
respectable profits in the second quarter, the rest of the year looks more 
bleak as recession fears spread and comparisons with 1988's strong results 
become more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"Retailers will be up against big numbers in the second half. It's going to be 
harder for them to improve margins," said retailing analyst David Williamson of 
Advest Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Sales at Sears, the nation's largest retailer, gained 3.6% last month, while 
they rose 2.3% at K mart, the second-largest merchandiser. Same-store sales at 
J. C. Penney gained 5.6%. Specialty apparel retailers Gap Inc. and The Limited 
Inc. made same-store sales increases of 13% and 12%, respectively.

BRITISH FUND TO SELL WATERGATE HOTEL

The Watergate Hotel, which earned a place in history because of the 1972 
Democratic Party headquarters burglary, is for sale. 
</P>
<P>
The British Coal Board has put the 237-room hotel up for sale, along with the 
lease it holds on an office building in the Watergate complex, the land under 
three cooperative apartment buildings there and retail space in the Watergate 
shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
Pension fund officials said Wednesday they want to pull out of the U.S. real 
estate market because growth prospects are better in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy Luscombe, president of Pan American Properties Inc. and Buckingham 
Holdings Inc., the American companies that manage the fund's holdings, would 
not comment on the asking price. Her office said the sale was part of a 
$1-billion portfolio. Estimates for the complex, which was completed in 1965, 
have ranged from $28 million to $71 million. 
</P>
<P>
The break-in at the sixth-floor offices of the Democratic National Committee in 
the Watergate Office Building next door to the hotel made the complex something 
of a landmark and the name of the site also became the name of the nation's 
biggest political scandal. 
</P>
<P>
G. Gordon Liddy and E. Howard Hunt, employees of President Richard M. Nixon's 
1972 reelection committee and masterminds of the burglary, waited in their room 
in the hotel while the break-in was being carried out. Nixon's resignation was 
forced two years later because of White House efforts to cover up involvement 
in the burglary. 
</P>
<P>
"It has historic value," said Stephen J. Wayne, a Georgetown University 
professor of government. 
</P>
<P>
The British pension fund's U.S. portfolio, valued at nearly $1 billion, 
includes 10 shopping centers, two shopping malls and office buildings in New 
York City and San Francisco.

<P>
Former Detroit Pistons star David Bing, now a steel company owner, says he 
wants to raise $2 million to restore sports in the Detroit public schools. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Education cut all sports programs and laid off hundreds of 
teachers and other employees as part of a $50-million budget-cutting plan. 
Interscholastic sports made up $1.4 million of the cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody needs to do something," said Bing, who averaged 22.6 points a game in 
nine seasons with the Pistons from 1966 through 1975. He said Wednesday that he 
is forming a group to raise money to continue the athletic programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I would love to see the sports programs saved," said school board 
member David Olmstead. "'Dave Bing is probably the one person in this community 
who can galvanize that kind of support." School board member George Vaughn was 
less enthusiastic, saying he prefers to save academic programs. 
</P>
<P>
"I realize there is a need for athletics, but in reality, most students do not 
participate in interscholastic sports," Vaughn said.

Retired Cincinnati Reds catcher Johnny Bench has become the first individual 
baseball player to be chosen to have his picture placed on boxes of Wheaties 
cereal. 
</P>
<P>
General Mills Inc. announced Wednesday that a picture of Bench in his Reds 
catching gear will be on the front of some Wheaties boxes being shipped to 
certain markets. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a great honor for me," said Bench, who retired after the 1983 season 
and will be inducted into baseball's Hall of Fame on July 23 in Cooperstown, 
N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Bench, now a Reds television broadcaster, said he ate the cereal as a child and 
recalls seeing a picture of Olympic pole-vaulter Bob Richards on the box. 
</P>
<P>
The Minnesota Twins were honored with having their team picture on Wheaties 
boxes after the Twins won the 1987 World Series.

All Pro strong safety Dave Duerson has requested to be traded from the Chicago 
Bears and probably will be dealt, a report published today says. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Phillips, the National Football League team's director of finance, said the 
Bears and Duerson are at "an impasse" in negotiations after months of talks. 
The sides are believed to be about $100,000 apart in annual salary figures, the 
Chicago Sun-Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
"We made a substantial offer that has been rejected," Phillips said. "Now we're 
approaching the season as if he won't be here. Things can change, but we have 
to make some assumptions as we go toward training camp." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips said the Bears don't want to lose Duerson but will try to accommodate 
his request to be traded.

GRAF, NAVRATILOVA TO MEET AGAIN;

EVERT LOSES IN WHAT MAY BE LAST TIME AT WIMBLETON

Steffi Graf ruined what probably was Chris Evert's last Wimbledon appearance 
today, beating the 34-year-old former champion 6-2, 6-1 for a spot in the 
women's final for the third straight year. 
</P>
<P>
Graf will try to retain her singles title Saturday against Martina Navratilova, 
who overcame an upset stomach and struggled before beating unseeded Catarina 
Lindqvist of Sweden 7-6, 6-2. She wrapped up the victory with her fifth ace to 
secure a spot in her 10th Wimbledon final. 
</P>
<P>
Graf, the defending women's champion from West Germany, saved six break points 
and boomed four aces in a lopsided victory over Evert that took just 68 minutes 
on a sweltering Center Court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'My Strength Now' 
</P>
<P>
"Today there were a lot of close points, and I managed to get those points," 
said Graf, who beat Evert for the eighth consecutive time after losing their 
first six meetings. "That was her strength usually, and it's become my strength 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Evert said age took its toll. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'Boy, if I was 10 years younger,' " Evert said. She added that she 
was "90% sure" she would not play Wimbledon again. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be real shocked if I came back and played this tournament next year," 
Evert said. "It would take a transplant or something. . . . A couple of 
different parts. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I'm past my prime now. When I retire -- it could be today, it could 
be the end of the year -- I'll know I played until I had nothing left." 
</P>
<P>
The crowd was for Evert all the way and politely applauded Graf's victory. 
Going off court, a ball boy stopped Evert and asked for an autograph. She 
obliged, as Graf hurried into the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
The Graf-Navratilova meeting will be their third in a row in the Wimbledon 
final, the first time that has happened since the tournament dropped the 
challenge round in 1921. 
</P>
<P>
Graf stopped Navratilova's consecutive title string at six last year, and it 
looked for a while as if Navratilova would not get a chance for revenge -- or a 
record ninth singles crown. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Easy at All' 
</P>
<P>
"It was not easy at all," Navratilova said. "My stomach was a mess. I was 
walking, and all of a sudden I couldn't breathe. It wasn't until six or seven 
games later that my stomach started settling down. . . . Everything happens to 
me in sight of the Royal Box." 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova said last year's outcome would have no effect on either her or Graf 
in Saturday's championship match. 
</P>
<P>
"I want it badly. Steffi wants it badly," she said. "This is what you live for. 
It's the Super Bowl for us and the World Cup final for Europeans."
