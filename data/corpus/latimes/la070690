<P>
Don and Patsy request the honor of your presence to celebrate their marriage on 
the Fourteenth of July, in the year Nineteen Hundred and Ninety, at the Compost 
Pile of Zeke the Sheik in Altadena, Calif. Black tie optional. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, that's how we would word the invitations if we'd been asked. 
</P>
<P>
Two friends of Zeke, landscapers Jim Norman and Patsy Stipe, are taking their 
vows on the heap, which became nationally famous earlier this year when the 
county threatened to bulldoze it as a health hazard. Zeke became a symbol of 
Earth Day, and officials have since agreed to negotiate a less drastic 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
The wedding may pack more drama than most, inasmuch as the hill spontaneously 
burst into flames twice in February. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what the bride and groom would be wearing, Zeke reacted as if it were a 
strange question. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll wear a tuxedo and she'll wear a regular bridal gown," he answered. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the dirt-covered hill would be topped with a carpet. 
</P>
<P>
We forgot to ask about footwear. 
</P>
<P>
Not that we've even been asked to attend. In fact, the only invite we've 
received lately is to view L.A.'s entrants in the Mr. (and Ms.) Nude 
International USA Pageant at the Treehouse Fun Ranch in Devore, near San 
Bernardino. The hosts are Fran and Bill. Their last name, of course, is 
Flesher. 
</P>
<P>
A story for our times: 
</P>
<P>
Lori Palmer was standing in front of her home off Mulholland Drive when a city 
fire inspector drove up to warn her to get rid of her parched ivy or face a 
citation. In a panic, she dug through the ivy to find the sprinkler valve and 
turned it on. She went inside, unaware that one of the sprinklers was damaged. 
Minutes later, the city Drought Police arrived. An anonymous neighbor had 
complained that the sprinkler was shooting water into the street. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Roundy of Montclair wishes the Drought Cops had been cruising through 
LAX at 2 a.m. the other morning. Roundy saw a worker violating city policy by 
hosing down the sidewalks as well as the crosswalk outside one of the terminals 
-- Tom Bradley International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
There's a tie in this week's Dueling Signs competition, between: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A Jolette/Jollette disparity, which David Elgenson spotted in Granada Hills 
(the correct answer is Jolette, mes amis). 
</P>
<P>
 -- A pair on Olympic Boulevard that were snapped by Robert Glynn, who sees 
them as symbolic of the fast-paced quality of life today: You can park for six 
hours, but you have to do it in 5 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
miscelLAny: 
</P>
<P>
Eight years before Mayor Bradley presented the keys to the city to 
anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela, he paid the same honor to the consul 
general of South Africa in a quiet ceremony in Beverly Hills. Mandela was then 
in his 19th year in jail in South Africa.

PRESIDENT BUSH'S DECISION TO ALLOW LOGGING IN OWL COUNTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So, our "Environmental President" has given the green light to the logging 
industry to bulldoze the spotted owl into extinction ("Logging in Owl Country 
Will Proceed," front page, June 27). Only, of course, until a new task force 
can devise a plan to "balance" the needs of nature with those of profit. 
</P>
<P>
Hah! Who does he think he's kidding? The needs of profit will always tip the 
scales in the end. 
</P>
<P>
In the name of "profit" we have fouled the air and water that sustain us. We 
have stripped the land and sent thousands of species into extinction. By thus 
condemning the Earth and its creatures we, in the end, condemn ourselves. Where 
is the profit in that?

The effort to save the spotted owl from extinction may cost thousands of lumber 
industry workers their jobs. It all comes down to which is more important: the 
welfare of human beings or animals? Owls are usually associated with wisdom, 
but the campaign to preserve them at the expense of humans is one dumb 
decision.

How much have you won on the California Lotto this year? 
</P>
<P>
My wife, Helen, is now ahead exactly $520, and that's only since the first week 
of January. After years of trying, the most she ever won was a fiver (dollars, 
that is) and that was last December. 
</P>
<P>
So, instead of going to the local 7-Eleven, she started putting her 
$10-twice-a-week "investments" into a glass jar. 
</P>
<P>
That's how she got $520 ahead, last count. 
</P>
<P>
Pretty soon, now, she's planning on taking that grubstake to Las Vegas where 
she's bound to be better entertained and, possibly, even win a little.

PRESIDENT BUSH'S DECISION TO ALLOW LOGGING IN OWL COUNTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration's decision to delay a ban on logging in the Northwest 
is incredibly shortsighted. Those who, unlike President Bush, really know the 
environmental score are painfully aware that the issue is not just an owl vs. 
some logging jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is 10% of remaining old-growth forests vs. human overpopulation and 
overuse of natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
My family drove and camped through Oregon and Washington in the 1960s. Some 
clear-cutting was visible. The "campground" had been turned into a mesa of huge 
stumps. But many mountain ranges were still forested. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five years later, in 1988, we drove through many of the same places. We 
were appalled. Logging trucks roared past continually, each carrying 3-4 giant 
logs obviously 100 years or more old. Most of the slopes had been clear-cut, 
even on the famous Olympic Peninsula. Mile upon mile seemed to have been hit 
with a nuclear bomb: heaps of huge tree roots, broken soil, brush piles. No 
living thing. I don't want to think what happened to the streams and wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the timber workers must live too. But why can't they be hired to 
restore the land, to improve recreation facilities, to entice visitors and 
their dollars back again? 
</P>
<P>
The spotted owl controversy is telling us time is short -- the future is upon 
us -- we must choose -- and we must support politicians who will make the right 
choices.

GOOD WORK BY MEXICO CITY, WASHINGTON ON MAJOR DRUG CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Daniel James Fowlie, a reputed drug kingpin, had eluded federal and local 
investigators for years. The operation he allegedly masterminded served as a 
reference point for President Bush, who delivered a major address from a seized 
ranch in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
But Fowlie became a symbol both for the objectives of the war on drugs and for 
its frustrations. Six of his associates were convicted of drug-smuggling 
charges in the United States while he remained in Mexico, successfully eluding 
his day in U.S. courts. Fowlie's extradition this week was an important new 
sign of cooperation in the drug war between Mexican and American authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Fowlie reportedly had been living a very comfortable prison life in La Paz, 
Mexico. He appealed to the Mexican Constitution to fight extradition and 
enjoyed such cordial relations with prison authorities that he was given 
generous four-day passes to go marlin fishing and pursue development interests 
in Cabo San Lucas. U.S. authorities had their 32-page indictment, with its 
charges of income tax evasion, distribution or intention to distribute 53,000 
pounds of marijuana and more, but they did not have their man. 
</P>
<P>
A court in Mazatlan, Mexico, paved the way last month with a ruling upholding 
extradition. On Monday afternoon, about 20 Mexican officials met with U.S. 
agents at a meeting so hastily assembled that Fowlie had no time to gather 
personal belongings before his extradition. 
</P>
<P>
It's interesting how quickly things can happen when two countries cooperate. 
Nearly five and one-half years elapsed from the time federal agents uncovered 
evidence of drug smuggling at the ranch to the time Fowlie returned for 
arraignment on Tuesday in federal court. In the United States alone, the case 
engaged a host of agencies. Progress came quickly in one chapter of the war on 
drugs only after the wheels of justice started turning in the courts and 
bureaucracies of two nations.

'WINNER TAKE ALL' IS NOT A JUST ANSWER;

<P>
SOUTH AFRICA: PROTECTION OF MINORITIES DOES NOT MEAN PROTECTION OF PRIVILEGE. 
IT DOES MEAN PROTECTION AGAINST THE ABUSE OF POWER BY THE MAJORITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERIK W. de KLERK, Frederik W. de Klerk is the president of South Africa. 
His article is adapted from an interview in the upcoming issue of World Link, a 
publication of the Geneva-based Davos World Economic Forum. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PRETORIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regardless of what other people say, I believe that sanctions per se are not 
the main problem in South Africa. Our prime concern is the domestic situation 
-- that is, the process of negotiation with all South Africans for a better 
future and the need for improvement of the quality of life for all. 
</P>
<P>
Insofar as sanctions against South Africa exist, we are living with them. What 
they have done, however, is retard our ability to fulfill our commitment to 
redress social and other backlogs in an imaginative way and on a sufficiently 
large scale. Should the international community re-evaluate its position on 
sanctions, it would allow us to harness our country's resources and face our 
challenges effectively, both inside South Africa and in the whole subcontinent 
-- challenges that can best be met by a vibrant South African economy. 
</P>
<P>
We disagree with the African National Congress' anachronistic emphasis on 
nationalization of industry, which it sees as the guarantee of a redistribution 
of wealth. We believe that a free-enterprise economy is the key to economic 
progress in the future. It is a proven system capable of generating new wealth 
and new opportunities, as is evidenced in the progress of the industrialized 
nations that adhere to it. 
</P>
<P>
In South Africa, unfortunately, this system is seen by many as synonymous with 
apartheid. In their rejection of apartheid, many would then equally, and 
mistakenly, equate a centrally controlled economy with economic progress. These 
are links that must be broken. 
</P>
<P>
My greatest hope is to bring about a just and fair South Africa by peaceful 
means. The greatest trap would be that radicalism and escalating conflict get 
out of hand. While firmly and fairly maintaining law and order, we must 
therefore strive for consensus, lifting our gaze above the many stumbling 
blocks presented by self-interest, exaggerated expectations and fear. 
</P>
<P>
In this endeavor, I believe I can work with Nelson Mandela. I believe I can 
work with him and other leaders in negotiating a new constitution for our 
country on the basis of give and take. I have seen Mandela keep his word after 
discussions with me. I perceive him to be a man who prefers peace to violence. 
He is a friendly and dignified man. 
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt in my mind that the overwhelming majority of South Africans 
are in favor of the kind of peaceful change I would like to bring about with 
the help of Mandela and other leaders with a proven support base. The mere fact 
that I could sit down with an ANC delegation earlier this year, I think, 
testifies to the will of the South Africans to give peace a chance. 
</P>
<P>
I believe that, on the black side of politics, there is a growing acceptance -- 
even among those who used violence as a method of policy -- of the government's 
integrity in negotiating a common future. The time of violent confrontation is 
past. All of us share some common ground in realizing that peace is the only 
option. 
</P>
<P>
Once the negotiation process has gained momentum -- and the government is eager 
for this process to start as soon as possible -- the search for consensus will 
replace polarization. 
</P>
<P>
We now want to work out a just and equitable system for all, but at the same 
time make sure that those who have enjoyed full freedoms do not forfeit them. 
That is why the National Party repeatedly emphasizes, in addition to universal 
franchise, the principle of nondomination and the protection of the rights and 
interests of minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Franchise on a common voters' roll in an otherwise undifferentiated and 
unqualified system of political representation must lead inevitably to majority 
domination of minorities. History has ample examples of the tension, 
frustration and conflict that unavoidably go together with the domination of 
closely knit minority groups. 
</P>
<P>
A constitutional system based on the "winner-take-all" approach is therefore 
not the answer to South Africa's complexities. It does not provide for adequate 
protection of minorities, nor for the cultural, religious and language 
differences among South Africans. However, universal adult franchise within a 
system into which constitutional mechanisms of protection are built is indeed 
an achievable possibility. 
</P>
<P>
One would be mistaken to draw from this a plea against the majority of the 
country's population getting their due. The whole argument now centers around 
unqualified majority rule without the balance of protection for minorities. 
Protection of minorities, I hasten to add, does not mean protection of 
privilege nor continuation of domination by a minority. It does, however, mean 
protection against the abuse of power by the majority. 
</P>
<P>
To repeat, I am in favor of universal adult franchise within a constitutional 
dispensation based on the principle of nondomination and into which most of 
these mechanisms are built: the decentralization of power, the devolution of 
authority to lower levels, constitutional checks and balances, decision-making 
by consensus and an independent judiciary. In addition, I stand for a bill of 
rights. Taken together, these elements will pave the path to a fair and just 
South Africa.

BATTLE OVER MONUMENT HAS A DEEPER MEANING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bravo to Harry Akune for his thought-provoking quotes in discussing the 
veterans' groups disagreement on who should be listed on a proposed monument to 
Japanese-American soldiers ("Battle Zone," June 28). Akune's message conveys to 
the public a meaningful insight to the purpose of the memorial. 
</P>
<P>
Since I read the article, I have given the subject considerable thought. If the 
purpose of the memorial is to (cause) people to think, if they have not, and to 
understand the difficulties we, the Japanese-Americans, faced during pre-World 
War II days to be accepted into the majority society and our desire to be fully 
accepted, then I have to agree that the World War II veterans were the catalyst 
toward meeting that goal.

BATTLE OVER MONUMENT HAS A DEEPER MEANING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The story of the 442nd Regiment Combat Team is more than the heroic battles of 
some American citizens in their quest for acceptance into American society. It 
is the story of loyal Americans interned because of their government's unjust 
fear. 
</P>
<P>
In turn, that minority of Americans (performed) the most valiant of deeds (for) 
that same government in a most desperate time of need. 
</P>
<P>
While the battle lingers concerning a monument commemorating the 
Japanese-Americas who fought for their country, I can only hope that somewhere 
. . . the virtues extolled by the 442nd -- in proving the U.S. government wrong 
-- will hold a distinct and exemplary place in American history. The spirit of 
the 442nd will always hold in me the anticipation that the interning of 
American citizens will never recur. Hopefully, the spirit of the 442nd can 
achieve a foundation in the memorial that arises from the remaining ashes of 
the "Battle Zone" affair. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps President Truman, while on the White House steps, stated a matter of 
Americanism best in his address to the 442nd upon their return home: "You 
fought not only the enemy, but you fought prejudice -- and you won. Keep up 
that fight and we will continue to win -- to make this great republic stand for 
what the Constitution says it stands for: 'The welfare of all the people all 
the time.' "

CLARIFICATION NEEDED ON AVOCADOS, CANCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As president of the California Avocado Commission, which represents the nearly 
7,000 growers in the state, I am writing to express our deep dissatisfaction 
and concern about your article that erroneously linked avocados with certain 
types of cancer ("Links Between Cancer, Dietary Fat Increase," June 26). 
</P>
<P>
In your article, you state that there is "a strong connection between dietary 
fat -- found in such goodies as ice cream and avocados -- in particular types 
of cancers. . ." By singling out the avocado, you incorrectly inferred that 
eating avocados can potentially cause cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Your misleading reference to avocados has alarmed consumers, many of whom have 
contacted our offices for clarification of your article. 
</P>
<P>
Your unfortunate choice of the avocado as a potentially detrimental food will 
undoubtedly have a negative impact on consumers' perception of a fruit that has 
many nutritional benefits when included in a healthful, well-balanced diet. 
California avocados are cholesterol-free, low in sodium and an excellent source 
of vitamins and potassium. 
</P>
<P>
We want to make it clear to your readers that avocados are healthful and 
nutritious.

Ciao, Madonna: Italians may have loved Madonna's "Who's That Girl" tour a few 
years ago, but the Italian-American singer's current tour has incurred the 
wrath of Italy's Catholic establishment. Prominent Catholics have branded the 
"Blonde Ambition" concerts as offensive, and have started a campaign to stop 
Madonna's tour from reaching Rome and Turin next week. 
</P>
<P>
The Catholic news agency SIR, which reflects opinions of the Italian Bishops' 
Conference, knocked Madonna's use of crucifixes and sacred symbols in concerts 
and videos. And the Catholic lobby group, Famiglia Domani (The Family 
Tomorrow), said that it had written to the cardinal of Rome, Ugo Poletti, 
asking him to "stop this shameful spectacle taking place in Rome -- a city dear 
to millions of Catholics." GREG BRAXTON

Cruise Races to Radio: Tom Cruise has gone from the racetrack to the radio to 
hype his "Days of Thunder" film, which is doing less-than-zooming business at 
the box office. 
</P>
<P>
Cruise visited KIIS-AM (1150) and KIIS-FM (102.7) morning personality Rick Dees 
for an hour Thursday in what was apparently his only local radio interview. The 
actor told Dees that he liked Maria McKee, Melissa Etheridge, the Rolling 
Stones, AC/DC and Technotronic's "Pump Up the Volume." Cruise also said he 
considers "Days of Thunder" a huge hit already. GREG BRAXTON

Like a Rolling Stone: Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman will record his first 
solo album in nine years when the Stones wind up their current world tour. The 
album is planned for release in March. Fellow Stones Mick Jagger, Keith 
Richards and Charlie Watts have all had outside projects in recent years that 
were met with no more than moderate popularity. GREG BRAXTON

STONE-AGE COMEDY IN 'JETSONS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like the two-headed flatworms perverse biology students raise in high school 
labs, the animated "Jetsons: The Movie" (citywide) tries to go in two 
directions at once and goes nowhere instead. 
</P>
<P>
Writer Dennis Marks and producer/directors William Hanna and Joseph Barbera 
can't seem to decide whether they're making a with-it musical for teen-agers or 
re-creating the ingenuous humor of a '60s TV show, and don't do either very 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"The Jetsons" is an odd vehicle for a feature: The original show flopped in 
prime time in 1962, although it proved popular on Saturday morning. The theme 
song is a camp favorite and the name of the Jetsons' dog (Astro), is a trivia 
game stickler. But the antics of George, Jane, Judy and Elroy owed too much to 
sitcoms like "The Donna Reed Show" and "Hazel" to be particularly memorable. 
Their Futurelux world dominated by an omnipresent, benevolent technology seems 
hopelessly dated in 1990 -- as does a family where Dad goes to work and the 
women go shopping. 
</P>
<P>
When Mr. Spacely moves George to his troubled satellite factory, Judy is 
heartbroken at leaving her boyfriend, but perks up as soon as she learns the 
new space community includes a mall. The minimal plot thickens when the Jetsons 
learn the factory is destroying the homes of the Grungies, a nauseatingly cute 
tribe of furry little critters who look like a cross between George Lucas' 
Ewoks and Gizmo in "Gremlins." (They also look suspiciously like something 
designed for a merchandising tie-in and/or spinoff TV show.) The film ends with 
a pat resolution and some leaden platitudes about ecology. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the original vocal cast has been reunited, including Penny Singleton 
(Jane), George O'Hanlon (George), Jean Vanderpyl (Rosie the Robot) and Don 
Messick (Astro). Mel Blanc recorded Mr. Spacely's lines shortly before his 
death, and Patric Zimmerman fills in as Elroy for the late Daws Butler. 
</P>
<P>
In an appeal to the potentially lucrative youth audience, Janet Waldo has been 
replaced by pop star Tiffany as the voice of Judy. A two-minute fantasy set to 
her song "You and Me," obviously designed for MTV, features some striking 
animation from the Kurtz and Friends studio. Its bold colors, fluid motions and 
kicky graphics make the limited animation in the rest of the G-rated film seem 
as exciting as a flat Perrier. 
</P>
<P>
Realistic, three-dimensional computer-generated images of the space city and 
asteroid factory make the flat, drawn characters look as though they stumbled 
in from another film. Their prominent shadows give them an odd, plastic 
texture, but don't help them fit into the computerized world. 
</P>
<P>
For all their efforts to appear hip (the characters constantly give each other 
high fives), the film makers remain mired in a kidvid mentality. An 
anthropomorphized dog growling "I love you, George" might have seemed funny in 
1962, but it isn't going to panic kids who watch "The Simpsons" and "Beverly 
Hills Cop."

'WATERWORKS': A SUMMER TONIC AT LONG BEACH MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The lazy days of summer seem to call for no-sweat art shows involving a minimum 
of mental energy on everyone's part. But every now and then, a summertime 
teaser actually has something to say for itself. 
</P>
<P>
At the Long Beach Museum of Art, "Waterworks" -- the final exhibit organized by 
departing senior curator Josine Ianco-Starrels (with assistance from media 
curator Michael Nash) -- offers photographs, videos and installations by 
artists who deal variously with the sounds, grandeur, mystery, rituals and 
wanton carelessness associated with water. 
</P>
<P>
Michael C. McMillen's installation, "Fluxus Naturae" -- the only new piece in 
the show -- invites viewers to pass through an old door into a small 
basement-like room lined with rusted implements and old trunks. This cool, dark 
place is dominated by the rushing sound of water passing through a series of 
chutes mounted on the wall. Water also gushes endlessly from a faucet into an 
old sink surrounded by plants and seedlings. Above the sink, a fat metal pipe 
serves as a porthole through which the ocean -- the real one -- is visible. 
</P>
<P>
In an Alice-in-Wonderland twist, a tiny glass door at foot-level leads to the 
outside, where a "huge" (actually normal-sized) plant looms over a tiny flight 
of back steps and microscopic garbage cans. An old clock is stopped at eight 
minutes to 12. It's hard not to see the piece as a plea for eleventh-hour 
attention to the crisis of water waste. (Even the spatial distortions and the 
tacit comparison of sink to ocean suggest the need for a change in 
perspective.) If this is preaching, it has the atmospheric charm of master 
storytelling. 
</P>
<P>
Mineko Grimmer contributes one of her sound-sculptures, a blend of quietly 
austere sculpture and natural process. Black pebbles frozen into a triangular 
block of ice are suspended above a shallow wooden trough. As the ice melts, the 
pebbles randomly dislodge and skitter through a pair of fan-shaped sprays of 
bamboo, making a pinging sound as they hit a metal bar projecting from the 
water. Unlike Grimmer's more utilitarian-looking earlier pieces in this mode, 
"Intermittent Composition" (1988) has a formal elegance that complements its 
aural allure. 
</P>
<P>
The team of video guru Nam June Paik and Paul Garrin present a twin-pack of 
rapid-fire imagery in "Two Channel Music Tape: Spring/Fall" (1987). Fashion 
models strutting, bits and pieces of a smiling nude woman, glimpses of visual 
and performing artists (Merce Cunningham, Joseph Beuys, Laurie Anderson) and 
purely abstract gyrations of color and line compete for the viewer's attention 
in a weirdly riveting cacophony of fragmented and repeated activities. The only 
thing that never changes is the sound of pounding surf, suggesting the dynamism 
linking diverse modes of audience-oriented behavior. 
</P>
<P>
In stark temporal contrast, Doug Hall's "Storm and Stress" (1986) leisurely 
tracks the onset and growing fury of thunderstorms in different locations, 
blending their peaks and valleys into a glorious and terrible symphony of sound 
and visual effects. "Stress" is shown as the province of ordinary folks and 
professional storm-watchers, all reduced to the status of passive bystanders 
beholding a dream. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Viola is represented by two early videos. In "The Reflecting Pool," 
(1977-79) the image of the artist's leap into a forest pool is frozen while the 
light effects play over the water, marking the passage of time. Gorgeously 
simple and complexly evocative -- Ianco-Starrels finds parallels to the myth of 
Narcissus -- the seven-minute tape is one of Viola's most accessible works. 
</P>
<P>
Robbert Flick's photo-grids of repeated surf imagery emphasize the constancy of 
the tides and the glinting wonder of light on water. In photographs from 
Richard Misrach's "Desert Cantos VII: Desert Sea" series, seductive washes of 
light and color veil the latter-day fallout from a mismanaged irrigation 
project of the early 1900s. Photo-documentation drains Lewis de Soto's 
performance pieces at the ocean's edge of whatever mystic feelings they may 
have embodied for spectators, however; the imagery comes across as little more 
than pretty swirls, bars and scribbles of fire or colored light. (Long Beach 
Museum of Art, 2300 E. Ocean Blvd., Long Beach, to Aug. 12.) 
</P>
<P>
Signs of art: Look, look. See Paul McCarthy's art. Everything is painted on 
electric signs. Some things look like cartoons, but not the kind for kids. A 
man is crouching on the beach in "Corporate Puppy Love." He is doing something 
to another man. A fountain is spraying from the other man. There is also a big 
blue-and-red design that looks like a target. Did those men make that design? 
Are they happy? Are they bad? Is Paul McCarthy mad at them? I'm not sure, but I 
think so. 
</P>
<P>
There are three plain black-and-red paintings, too: a radiation sign and a CBS 
"eye" sign and a skull sign for "poison." These signs warn me against the bad 
people who make harmful things. There is also a bunch of travelers' trunks 
piled on a big table. I can't see into the trunks and I'd better not open them, 
but it says on a piece of paper that they hold props from Paul McCarthy's 
performances. There's another thing on the pile: a box with two holes, like 
eyes. A long thing is sticking out from one of the holes. Paul McCarthy seems 
to like those long things. I never saw any of his performances, but I hope they 
were more grown-up. (Rosamund Felsen Gallery, 669 N. La Cienega Blvd., to July 
28.) 
</P>
<P>
Middle-aged humor: Steve Gianakos makes paintings that are really just 
super-sized cartoon line drawings translated into a high-art medium. They used 
to be genuinely witty in a deadpan way. It was hard to resist the "Dead Girl" 
series, in which a smiling, blank-eyed girl rests her head at the same abrupt 
angle no matter what she is leaning on, or what the setting happens to be -- at 
the dentist or on a date. But in his recent images, Gianakos seems to have 
succumbed to flabby middle-aged lechery that looks out of place outside the 
back pages of "men's" magazines. 
</P>
<P>
His Betty Boopish nudes are dimwitted innocents, displaying their charms for 
unseen admirers or fretting -- in careless dishabille -- over difficulties 
large and small. The tag lines generally replay the purple prose of trashy 
novels ("She was trying to recapture the few moments of bliss he had given 
her"). A number of the images contain cunning arrangements of colored 
rectangles a la Mondrian -- suggesting, perhaps, vestigial evidence of 
impress-your-date chatter about Modern Art. Everything in this work depends on 
a knowing wink exchanged between artist and onlooker. If the onlooker happens 
to be a woman, she's apt to feel mightily out of place. (Asher/Faure, 612 N. 
Almont Drive, to July 28.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Visceral images: Judie Bamber's new paintings at Roy Boyd Gallery sulk and 
snarl with an underlying bruised sensibility that derives partially from the 
imagery and partly from the titles. Each square canvas is a monochrome field 
with a small, meticulously described object in the center. Some of these are 
just small (a chameleon); others have a viscous surface texture and erotic or 
squeamish associations (a side view of a mussel that looks like a female organ, 
a dead baby bird); and still others are simple man-made objects that coldly 
represent male anatomy. 
</P>
<P>
Bamber's titles -- "I'll Never Forgive You For This (Duo Tone Balls)," "I Don't 
Want to Talk About It (Mussel)" -- inject a contemporary note of 
relationship-on-the-rocks. The pairings of objects and titles sometimes give 
seemingly innocuous objects devastatingly cutting significance. Still, the 
heart of this work lies in the painfully visceral quality of some of the images 
rather than in the pop psych by-play of the titles, which too easily become 
vapid one-liners. (Roy Boyd Gallery, 1547 10th St., Santa Monica, to July 21.)

A CULINARY PASSAGE TO INDIA AT TAZEEN'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"You know, I've never had Indian food," warned the part-time volleyball star at 
the exact moment she was sitting down. 
</P>
<P>
"No problem," I said. 
</P>
<P>
I wasn't worried. Tazeen's seemed supremely accessible, a place of light, 
cheerful food and evocative spice aromas. 
</P>
<P>
It looks rather like a coffee shop: white walls, coral chairs, Formica table 
tops, a counter. There are movie-star photos on the wall, which seems apt since 
it's only a block from MGM, except that they're all photos of Indian movie 
stars. But Tazeen's is tiny, as crowding the part-time volleyball star and her 
equally tall friends into one little booth demonstrated. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing that will disgust you about Indian food," I said. "Well, there 
are those Indian pickles, which have so many spices in them they're a little 
bitter. But they're delicious, and there's one here you probably can't get 
anywhere else: chicken pickle." 
</P>
<P>
But Tazeen, the charming young owner of the restaurant, doesn't bring out 
chicken pickle -- her aunt's recipe, she says -- unless you ask (it tastes just 
like an ordinary Indian vegetable pickle, only made from chicken). And the 
other things proved no problem for the volleyball crowd. 
</P>
<P>
The vegetable samosa, for instance. No problem. It had the all-American 
combination of peas, carrots, corn and potato. The aaloo bonda -- diced potato 
deep-fried in thin batter -- had an exotic aroma of cilantro chutney; no 
problem. Full meals start with a carrot-and-lettuce salad and a big, irregular 
round of bread hot from the tandoor oven, like extra-thick pizza bread, only 
slightly blackened here and there. It was a big hit. 
</P>
<P>
Dinner entrees come with dal -- a little pot of either plain boiled lentils or 
plain boiled yellow split peas -- and a vegetable. This is usually one of the 
dishes from the menu's sizable vegetarian list: simple sautees, usually, 
cabbage and tomatoes or potatoes and spinach, cheerily flavored with turmeric 
and cumin. Some of the vegetarian entrees are more elaborate, like the eggplant 
in a rich sauce of ground walnuts and tamarind. 
</P>
<P>
The tandoori dishes were also perfectly unproblematic. Seekh kebab was your 
basic ground lamb kebab flavored with onion and parsley. Chicken tikka, chicken 
breast tenderized with a yogurt marinade, was bright with turmeric and cumin. 
Mutter keema, sauteed ground beef with peas, likewise had lots of cumin and 
turmeric. The volleyball crowd thought it tasted like very good ground beef 
with peas. 
</P>
<P>
But I wondered about the rest of the dishes, which were remarkable for their 
subtle and unusual spicing. I was humiliated to say I had no idea what was in 
the deceptively named chicken curry. 
</P>
<P>
And what's in the aaloo ka salan? The sauce has an unprepossessing dull yellow 
color, and may be thickened with ground onions, but beyond cardamom and clove I 
can't guess what's in it. Nor have I a clue about haray masalay ka gosht, lamb 
cooked very soft in a greenish sauce. The name means "meat with fresh 
seasoning," referring to the cilantro in the sauce, but what's the rest? 
Coconut? Asafoetida? 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, the volleyballers had no trouble with these dishes. However, the 
house specialty, lamb biryani, was a problem. This pilaf is mixed with lamb 
fried very brown in the Central Asian manner, almost as intensely flavored as 
beef jerky. I guessed its exotic aroma came from ground ginger, cloves, saffron 
and something sweet and sour I couldn't make out. 
</P>
<P>
The part-time volleyball star, however, sniffed at it and said, "Windex." 
</P>
<P>
The blandest of the desserts -- a sort of milk-flavored gelatine called faluda 
-- would probably be the perfect dessert to follow a spicy meal, if we'd 
ordered our dishes hot. Saveeyan, very fine brown vermicelli in milk with 
raisins, occasioned some critical comment ("Shredded wheat," was the 
conclusion). Gulab jamun, however, was liked, and justly; this is one of the 
freshest and least soggy versions of these condensed milk balls in syrup 
around. The favorite was kheer, a very good, pretty liquid rice pudding with 
cinnamon. 
</P>
<P>
The very best dessert, to my way of thinking, was shahi tukray, a sort of bread 
pudding in a rich spiced sauce of condensed milk. In this case there seemed to 
be a layer of dried fruit in it as well, but the bright yellow sauce had that 
same wonderful, magical spice aroma I'd tasted in the biryani. 
</P>
<P>
The volleyball star, however, wrinkled her nose and pronounced an 
incontrovertible verdict: "Windex." You can't win them all. 
</P>

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: VERSAILLES SEQUEL A MATCH FOR ORIGINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE OCHOA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's a certain nervousness among the regulars of Versailles, the Cuban 
restaurant on Venice Boulevard, that is practically a commissary for the 
production VPs and film crews that work at the studios nearby. The reason for 
their distress: Versailles II. 
</P>
<P>
Can the sequel be as good as the original? 
</P>
<P>
It's too soon to tell, but judging by the first week's business, it will 
probably be as popular. Expect to wait in line for a dinner table -- especially 
after 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
The new Versailles, 1415 S. La Cienega Blvd., Los Angeles, (213) 289-0392, 
covers a lot of the same themes as the old Versailles. There's the same 
non-decor (red Naugahyde chairs, etc.), a lot of the same wisecracking waiters 
and, basically, the same menu -- including the list of daily specials scrawled 
on a mirrored board. The dining room is smaller, though, and there seems to be 
more emphasis on takeout here. 
</P>
<P>
And what about the chicken? (Chicken -- roasted, full of garlic and buried 
under a mass of grilled onions -- is the dish that 90% of the Versailles crowd 
orders.) Early tests have shown it to have just as much garlic power as the 
original. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who've never gone beyond the bird might be interested to know that 
Versailles makes other good dishes: roast pork with the same garlic-onion 
treatment as the chicken, tender oxtail and good Cuban coffee -- some of the 
cheapest and strongest espresso on the Westside. LAURIE OCHOA

FRENCH OFFICIAL LOSES JOB AFTER RENT-A-CROWD CAPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A French Cabinet minister has resigned in disgrace after he was caught hiring 
unemployed actors, students and day laborers to pose as an audience for senior 
Socialist Party speakers at a sparsely attended conference here. 
</P>
<P>
The rent-a-crowd scheme unraveled Tuesday when a news cameraman from one of the 
French networks recognized a television comic actor in the audience of the 
somber colloquium sponsored by an intellectual futurist organization, Dialogues 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
Other journalists became suspicious when members of the crowd, mistaking the 
reporters for conference organizers, asked directions for collecting the 343 
francs ($60) they had been promised for attending speeches by the Speaker of 
the National Assembly, Laurent Fabius, and Socialist Party First Secretary 
Pierre Mauroy, among others. 
</P>
<P>
By Thursday, the affair had expanded into a national embarrassment for the 
ruling Socialists, who were ridiculed in cartoons and articles on the front 
pages of all the daily newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
"A Big Hand for the Politicians," mocked the headline in the Communist daily, 
L'Humanite. For the Socialists, who have shown a steady decline in public 
opinion polls recently, it was the latest in a series of setbacks that began in 
March when party leaders feuded petulantly at a political convention over who 
would be the next candidate for president in 1995 when incumbent Francois 
Mitterrand retires. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Minister of Tourism Olivier Stirn, organizer of the ill-fated 
Dialogues 2000 colloquium, attempted to defend himself by arguing that paying 
the audience helped to alleviate unemployment. The several hundred actors, 
students and day laborers applauded enthusiastically during the three hours of 
speeches Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tiny mistake with no bad intentions," Stirn blurted under questioning 
from a television reporter. He said the stand-ins were hired after only a few 
legitimate invitees attended earlier sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Late Wednesday night, however, Stirn was forced to resign under mounting 
pressure from members of his own political party and members of the opposition 
gleeful over the latest pratfall for the ruling Socialists. 
</P>
<P>
Invited to speak after Fabius and Mauroy late Tuesday afternoon, Minister of 
Defense Jean-Pierre Chevenement had watched in astonishment as the meeting hall 
emptied as he approached the speaker's platform. The audience had been hired 
for only three hours and that time was up just as it was his turn to speak. 
</P>
<P>
Informed of the ruse, Chevenement could barely contain his rage. He was among 
the first to call for Stirn's head. 
</P>
<P>
The French political system forgives many sins that would be considered fatal 
in the United States and other Western democracies. Cabinet ministers are 
seldom forced to resign. The last was in 1985 when the late Defense Minister 
Charles Hernu resigned for his role in the bombing of the ship Rainbow Warrior 
in New Zealand. Greenpeace, the environmental organization, employed the vessel 
in its fight against French nuclear tests in the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
The one sin that apparently finds no forgiveness in the French political scene 
is provoking public embarrassment. There is a common expression in French that 
"ridicule never killed anyone." But from infancy, French children are chided by 
their parents to avoid being ridicule. 
</P>
<P>
Being ridiculous apparently proved fatal to Stirn's political career. 
</P>
<P>
"The affair is basically just embarrassing," an adviser to Prime Minister 
Michel Rocard told a reporter from the Paris newspaper, Liberation. "But it 
came at a bad time. There are times when it is criminal to look ridiculous."

<P>
West Germany declared for the first time Thursday that it is willing to 
negotiate limits on the future military forces of a united Germany as the 
Western allies neared agreement on a historic declaration designed to reshape 
NATO and reassure the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
As part of their effort to convince Moscow it has nothing to fear from a 
unified Germany inside NATO, leaders of the alliance's 16 member nations 
prepared to accept a set of proposals by President Bush that include inviting 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to address the alliance and pledging to 
use nuclear weapons "only as a last resort" in a conventional war in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Under present doctrine, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the United 
States have refused to rule out early use of nuclear weapons in the event of 
such a conflict. 
</P>
<P>
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, second only to Bush as a force in 
determining the shape that NATO will assume in response to the dramatic 
political changes that are transforming Europe, announced his country's 
willingness to limit its own forces during the opening session of a two-day 
NATO summit here. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to negotiations now going on in Vienna between NATO and the Warsaw 
Pact nations over reducing conventional forces in Europe, Kohl declared, "In 
Vienna, the federal government will be willing to negotiate on the level of 
forces to be maintained by a united Germany." 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that Kohl, who has repeatedly driven home the point that 
a united Germany must be accepted as a fully sovereign and equal member of the 
Atlantic Alliance, had agreed to cap military forces. Only last month, when 
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze advanced the idea during talks 
on German reunification, Bonn, joined by the United States, Britain and France, 
the other Western governments involved in the talks, rejected the idea. 
</P>
<P>
West German government sources conceded that Kohl's new willingness to work out 
such limits is part of an effort to obtain Soviet acquiescence in German 
reunification and in a unified Germany's belonging to NATO. Even so, German 
sources made it clear that a cap on its future armaments could come only as a 
decision by a sovereign German government, not as something imposed by Moscow 
or by its own allies. 
</P>
<P>
While Bush and Kohl took the lead in efforts to show sensitivity to the Soviet 
Union's vested interest in the NATO discussions taking place here, a West 
German spokesman said it was clear that "everyone wants a dramatic signal to be 
sent out reassuring the Soviets" that they should have no fear of a surprise 
attack by NATO. 
</P>
<P>
In a similar vein, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said at a news 
briefing after the closed-door discussions at London's historic Lancaster 
House: 
</P>
<P>
"As the adage goes, seeing is believing. And the President proposed to give the 
Warsaw Pact countries a special view of NATO that could help change their 
perspective on our years of adversarial relations. 
</P>
<P>
"He proposed to invite President Gorbachev to attend a NATO meeting and he 
proposed to establish some kind of liaison between the Warsaw Pact countries 
and NATO," Fitzwater said. "The President said, 'We will show that NATO has a 
new dimension of cooperation with the Soviet Union and with the new democracies 
of Eastern Europe,' " 
</P>
<P>
A summit declaration redefining NATO's mission and including such assurances 
will be issued when the leaders conclude their meetings today. Although their 
discussions Thursday were so free of contention that the leaders ended an 
afternoon session half an hour early, the final declaration is considered so 
important that the foreign ministers of the 16 nations worked late into the 
night hammering out its exact wording. 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press, quoting diplomatic sources, reported that the foreign 
ministers agreed early today on a 20-paragraph draft communique that includes 
an invitation to the Warsaw Pact to sign a mutual non-aggression agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The tentative proposal "is basically stating that various countries who sign it 
are no longer adversaries and should refrain from threat or use of force," one 
source said. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said the opening discussions centered on proposals that Bush had made 
before the summit and, while no final decisions have been made, there has been 
a "generally positive response" from the allies. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's proposal that Gorbachev be invited to address NATO has not yet been 
raised with the Soviet leader, nor have the allies yet formally agreed to such 
an invitation. But U.S. officials left little doubt that they expect the 
invitation to be extended and Gorbachev to accept. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said Gorbachev will be invited to address a session of the 
North Atlantic Council at NATO's headquarters in Brussels in December. A senior 
U.S. official said Bush and the other Western government leaders almost 
certainly would attend if Gorbachev accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Georgy Shakhnazarov, a personal aide to Gorbachev, said late Thursday that the 
Soviet leader is prepared to accept any such invitation. Shakhnazarov was 
interviewed on the U.S. Public Broadcasting System's "MacNeill-Lehrer 
Newshour." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said a Gorbachev appearance, as well as a Bush proposal that the 
Warsaw Pact nations be invited to establish a liaison office at NATO 
headquarters in Brussels, was intended to give the Soviets the kind of access 
to NATO that would reassure them of the alliance's commitment to peaceful 
cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal to alter NATO's policy on when it would use its nuclear weapons by 
stipulating that they would be unleashed only as "a last resort" was agreed to 
in principle by all the allies, although both British Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher and French President Francois Mitterrand had reservations about it. 
Both warned that NATO should do nothing to diminish the value of its nuclear 
arms as a deterrent to Soviet attack, noting that Moscow will retain enormous 
military power regardless of any changes the future may bring . 
</P>
<P>
Bush Administration officials had been eager to paint the proposal to make 
atomic arms the "weapons of last resort" as a significant shift in NATO 
strategy, but felt compelled to backpedal when Thatcher balked at the proposed 
wording. 
</P>
<P>
When Thatcher complained that such a declaration would weaken the alliance's 
nuclear deterrent posture, U.S. officials hastened to assure her that the new 
phrase was principally a rhetorical gesture designed to send a conciliatory 
note to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
It would not, the officials assured her, change the Atlantic Alliance's 
longstanding commitment to use nuclear force if Western Europe were in danger 
of being overrun by Soviet conventional forces. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Thatcher, the lone holdout against the "last resort" language, 
acceded to the Bush initiative. 
</P>
<P>
In her opening statement, Thatcher said, "We are at a turning point in Europe's 
history, a turning point which is as full of promise as was 1919 and 1945. And 
we know that it is the existence of NATO and its sure defense which have helped 
to change the direction of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union from the dictate 
of government towards the democracy of the people." 
</P>
<P>
The signal from the NATO summit, she said, "must be one of resolve in defense, 
resolve and unity in defense, coupled with willingness to extend the hand of 
friendship to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
She also told of receiving a message from Gorbachev that British officials 
later described as a two-page letter expressing hope for constructive results 
from the NATO summit, but also expressing interest in next week's economic 
summit at Houston, where the United States and six other industrialized 
countries -- Canada, Britain, France, Italy, West Germany and Japan -- are 
expected to discuss aid to the Soviet Union along with other economic matters. 
</P>
<P>
A British spokesman said that while Gorbachev expressed an interest in 
receiving such aid from the allies, his letter did not request it. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of aid to the Soviet Union was not raised at the summit here 
Thursday. The U.S. position has been that Western aid should not be extended 
until the Soviet Union ends its own aid in Third World trouble spots and adopts 
further reforms to transform its planned economy into more of a free-market 
system. 
</P>
<P>
French officials, meanwhile, were so eager to give wide circulation to 
Mitterrand's views on the reshaping of the NATO mission and his concern about 
the continuing Soviet military threat that they released an English translation 
of his opening statement, something they ordinarily do only long after an 
official meeting. 
</P>
<P>
While Mitterrand agreed with the "spirit" of Bush's proposals and agreed that 
it is time to establish new relations in Europe, he urged that in adopting a 
strategy for the future, NATO retain "truly a concept of deterrence, i.e., that 
its unambiguous objective should be to prevent the outbreak of war and not 
simply to try to win a war." 
</P>
<P>
"I do not think an open conflict can escape from its logical progression, 
namely ever greater use of arms, until the atomic bomb," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
In the evening, German officials spelled out in greater detail their position 
on setting limits on the military forces of a united Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"For the Soviets, the future of a united Germany's force levels is important," 
commented a senior member of the West German delegation. 
</P>
<P>
The Bonn government stressed, however, that it is only prepared to consider the 
issue in a way that would not single out Germany for punishment as a result of 
its defeat in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, West Germany, supported by the United States and other NATO 
countries, wants to cover the matter in the Vienna talks and not the so-called 
"two-plus-four" unification negotiations among the two German states and the 
four major victorious World War II powers -- the United States, Britain, France 
and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to be singled out," commented a member of the German delegation. 
"We're thankful that the Soviets say this should be discussed in Vienna." 
</P>
<P>
Theoretically, the German troop limitation would be contained within a general 
agreement concerning all military forces in Central Europe, to avoid singling 
out Germany. However, it seems certain that in practice the limit will apply 
primarily to Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The first round of the 23-nation conventional forces talks is expected to be 
concluded before the end of this year. There probably is not time enough to 
include a German troop limit in that round, but a ranking U.S. State Department 
official said the Soviet Union is demanding some sort of resolution of the 
German troop issue before it agrees to remove the last of its World War II 
occupation rights. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviets have a very substantial interest in knowing what the forces are 
going to be in the central region of Europe, before they agree to all of the 
external aspects of German unification," the U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the limit could be included either in a supplement to the first 
conventional forces agreement or in immediate follow-on talks. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to make sure it's a procedure that the Soviets are happy with so 
they'll go forward with a final (reunification) settlement," the official said. 
"There's no difference of approach between us and the Germans." 
</P>
<P>
A leading West German newspaper, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, reported 
earlier this week that Kohl, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and 
Defense Minister Gerd Stoltenberg agreed in secret talks to consider limits on 
the united German army. The newspaper said that Stoltenberg favored a limit of 
400,000 while Genscher supported a 350,000 ceiling. West Germany now has about 
494,000 troops and East Germany has at least 130,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization pact was signed April 4, 1949, in 
Washington. In it, the United States, Canada and 10 European nations -- 
Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, 
Norway and Portugal -- aligned themselves against any military threat from the 
Soviet Union. Greece, Turkey, West Germany and Spain later joined the alliance. 
The treaty says, "The parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of 
them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them 
all." France, Spain and Iceland are not part of NATO's integrated military 
structure.

AIR QUALITY PLANNERS WEIGH COMMUTER FEES; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: PROPOSALS REPRESENT A SHARP SHIFT IN STRATEGY. GAINING THE 
PUBLIC'S BACKING WILL BE A CHALLENGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In an important shift in strategy, Southern California environmental 
policy-makers are revising the region's federally mandated air quality plan to 
include a broad array of commuter fees -- from freeway tolls to higher auto 
emission charges to new parking assessments. 
</P>
<P>
Adoption of the fees would represent a shift in the outlook Southern California 
historically has held toward driving -- the notion that freeway travel is a 
birthright rather than a privilege that can be taxed. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed fees could go into effect during this decade. But enabling state 
and federal legislation would be required before many of the fees could be put 
in place. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District, which is ultimately 
responsible for the region's air quality plan, is to begin considering the 
proposed changes today. An AQMD official said Thursday that the agency's staff 
so far has found nothing objectionable. 
</P>
<P>
If adopted by the AQMD, the fees would become the latest in a series of 
regulations that will alter life in Southern California over the next two 
decades in order to bring the region's unhealthy atmosphere into compliance 
with federal clean air standards. The commuter fees would be part of a long 
list of pollution controls affecting everything from back yard barbecues to dry 
cleaners and oil refineries. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the fees acknowledge that they will have their work cut out for 
them in persuading the public to go along with at least some of the proposed 
charges. A public opinion survey conducted by the Southern California Assn. of 
Governments, which is proposing the fees, found that only 17% of people polled 
would support a toll on commuters who drive alone at rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the poll, which questioned 1,534 people in six Southern 
California counties, found that 65% would be willing to see their annual auto 
registration fees raised by $4 if the money is used to reduce air pollution and 
congestion. 
</P>
<P>
In recommending the commuter fees, officials of the Assn. of Governments 
de-emphasized an earlier strategy that called for a realignment of housing and 
jobs in the region to cut down on commuting. 
</P>
<P>
That strategy, known as the jobs/housing balance, was an integral part of the 
original Air Quality Management Plan in 1989, but was widely criticized as a 
form of social engineering that ultimately would not keep people off the roads. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, members of a task force created by SCAG insisted they were not 
bowing to political pressures against enforcing jobs/housing quotas, but were 
responding to studies which showed that the jobs/housing balance is not the 
congestion cure-all it was cracked up to be. 
</P>
<P>
"We could have communities in perfect balance and still have an enormous amount 
of commuting," said Jon Mikels, a San Bernardino County supervisor and the 
chairman of SCAG's growth management and transportation task force. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can reduce vehicle miles traveled, maybe we won't have to mess with 
moving people or jobs around the region," said Christine E. Reed, president of 
SCAG and a Santa Monica City Council member. 
</P>
<P>
Mikels said SCAG's executive committee voted Thursday to amend the 1989 air 
quality plan so that commuter fees take precedence over but do not eliminate 
efforts to achieve a jobs/housing balance. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Eichhorn, media liaison officer for the Air Quality Management District, 
said he did not foresee any serious differences between SCAG and the AQMD over 
the recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
SCAG is composed of representatives of governments throughout the region to 
advise on transportation and land-use planning. 
</P>
<P>
Eichhorn said, "We have generally accepted SCAG's recommendations. Our board 
members are pretty SCAG-oriented." 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD's approval most likely would lead to the creation of a variety of 
demonstration projects to determine which of the fee proposals work best. On 
the table are everything from rush-hour freeway tolls to a recommendation that 
private firms end subsidized parking for their employees. SCAG officials said 
Thursday that similar demonstration projects are under way in other parts of 
the state, including one in Coronado in which San Diego commuters driving alone 
to work are charged a dollar while those who share rides are not charged. 
</P>
<P>
Despite poll results showing a chilly public reaction to the proposed fees, 
officials at SCAG believe the fees can be presented in ways that will make them 
acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
"If you were asked would you be willing to pay if you were going to get a 
faster commute as a result, you might be more inclined to pay," Mikels said. 
</P>
<P>
Another approach to limiting peak-hour freeway driving would be to issue 
certificates to commuters for a limited amount of rush-hour driving. "These 
certificates could then be traded," SCAG suggests in a report on its proposed 
fees. "Those who wanted or needed more peak-period driving certificates could 
buy them, not from the government but from other people." 
</P>
<P>
If employers stopped subsidizing employee parking, they could soften the blow, 
SCAG officials suggested, by paying employees the amount it costs to park. 
Workers could choose whether to spend the money on parking, on public transit 
or on car-pooling expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed fee system would avoid penalizing the poor by using some of the 
revenue raised to defray the costs of transportation for low-income commuters, 
according to the SCAG report. 
</P>
<P>
"For example," the report says, "the revenues raised by a smog fee can be used 
to offset the costs of low-income drivers through a tax credit or direct 
financial assistance to bring their vehicles up to code." 
</P>
<P>
Officials at SCAG insist that they are not recommending that all efforts to 
achieve a jobs/housing balance in the region be abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
Those efforts were aimed at changing a growing discrepancy in the region where 
most new employment has been in the western portion and most new homes in the 
east. Goals were set to increase the number of jobs in the east by 9% and the 
number of new homes in the west by 5%. 
</P>
<P>
But communities have balked at the notion of fulfilling job and housing quotas 
set by an outside authority. 
</P>
<P>
"Cities don't want regional government telling them how to do land planning," 
Eichhorn said. 
</P>
<P>
Last January, AQMD planners notified Los Angeles officials that the Porter 
Ranch project, the largest and most controversial development under way in the 
city, would throw the San Fernando Valley's balance of jobs and housing out of 
alignment and jam nearby freeways, aggravating pollution. 
</P>
<P>
But after blistering criticism from Dan Garcia, a lawyer for Porter Ranch and 
confidante of Mayor Tom Bradley, the AQMD adopted a more tolerant view of the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Now, officials at SCAG and the AQMD say they have come to question the 
presumption that building homes close to offices will substantially reduce auto 
trips. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got Orange County in balance, and we still have a massive amount of 
commuting," Mikels said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PROPOSED COMMUTER FEES 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of the commuter fees proposed by the Southern California Assn. 
of Governments to reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality: 
</P>
<P>
Peak-period charges: Drivers alone in their cars during rush hours would pay. 
</P>
<P>
Elimination of parking subsidies: Public and private employers could no longer 
subsidize employee parking costs. One proposal calls for employers to pay 
employees the cash equivalent of annual parking costs and let employees decide 
how they want to use the money -- to pay for parking, to pay for public transit 
or to share the costs of car pooling. 
</P>
<P>
Emission charges: Raising car and truck registration fees by $5 to $10 annually 
with the proceeds used to help reduce air polllution caused by vehicle 
emissions.

CHURCHES TAKE UP DRUG FIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
CONGREGATIONS ARE TEAMING UP AT CITY AND REGIONAL LEVELS TO TARGET THE ROOTS OF 
THE PROBLEM. THEY CLOSE DOWN CRACK HOUSES AND MOBILIZE TO RETAKE WHOLE 
NEIGHBORHOODS.

<P>
Members of a church in southeast Washington, D.C. locked themselves in one 
night last year during a prayer service as drug wars raged in the streets 
outside. When the pastor of Shaw United Methodist Church went to investigate, 
he found two teen-agers shot dead on the doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
Partly because of that tragedy, the United Methodist Church has started a drug 
program that is becoming a model for religious groups around the country. 
</P>
<P>
The 9-million-member denomination has assigned a bishop full time to the drug 
effort, and 14 of its Washington churches staff "saving stations" offering a 
variety of anti-drug programs around the clock. 
</P>
<P>
From Los Angeles to New York, Chicago to Baton Rouge, La., religious coalitions 
are teaming up at city and regional levels to combat drugs. And the National 
Council of Churches has planned a summit conference in Washington this fall, 
the first time the giant umbrella agency has called leaders of its 32-member 
bodies together specifically to map an attack against drug and alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
While churches have long helped people to overcome addictions, their new 
activism marks a more unified and innovative approach -- addressing the roots 
of drug abuse, emphasizing prevention and implementing strategies to retake 
whole neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"The plan is to work together much as we did on civil rights during the '60s," 
said Felton E. May, the burly, energetic United Methodist bishop who is on a 
year's special drug-busting assignment. "This is basically a spiritual 
warfare." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the True Vine Baptist Church in Oakland fought the spiritual battle 
by driving pushers out of a large housing project after praying and marching 
around it seven times, imitating the trumpet-blowing Israelites in the Bible 
who circled the city of Jericho before its walls tumbled. 
</P>
<P>
In Detroit, churches joined forces to rehabilitate seized crack houses, turning 
them into low-cost family housing. 
</P>
<P>
In Dallas, a church-organized anti-cocaine coalition has closed down crack 
houses and raised money to open a center for teen-age drug users. 
</P>
<P>
But how much impact is the anti-drug effort by religious groups really having? 
</P>
<P>
Observers of the war on drugs agree that some neighborhood battles are being 
won; prevention programs do keep many teen-agers off drugs; spiritually 
oriented treatment groups report high cure rates. But, overall, they say, 
successes represent only a small dent in one of America's most pernicious 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie B. Walton, associate director of the Office of National Drug Control 
Policy in Washington, said churches are generally effective in changing "the 
morals and values" of those involved with drugs. But all too often "churches 
don't seem able to come together and work cohesively," he said, adding that 
community-wide efforts are essential for long-range success. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics doubt that church actions make much headway, given the continuing 
ready availability of drugs and the escalation of drug-related crimes. Other 
observers note that many pastors and parishioners fear involvement in an 
unpredictable and potentially violent ministry. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't want to get their hands dirty," said the Rev. Andrew 
Robinson-Gaither, pastor of Faith United Methodist Church in South-Central Los 
Angeles, where four recovery programs, including Cocaine Anonymous, meet 
regularly. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes," he added, "church folk don't want to deal with the tough issues. . 
. . The pastor has got to take the lead." 
</P>
<P>
Bishop May, for one, isn't afraid to wade into the thick of drug wars. He is 
the first high-level church official to head a nationwide grass-roots assault 
on drugs and violence. 
</P>
<P>
The idea, says May, who was freed up from his regular post in Harrisburg, Pa., 
on Jan. 1 to work in the Anacostia section of Washington, "is to build 
solidarity in terms of life and death with folks right where they are." 
</P>
<P>
May seems an ideal man for the job. He grew up on Chicago's South Side in the 
1950s and assisted Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the civil rights movement and 
anti-poverty programs of the 1960s. For the last several years, he has headed 
the board that directs the denomination's national programs. 
</P>
<P>
His role in combatting the drug culture, May said, is to be "a catalytic 
servant who gets the ball rolling . . . to love the hell out of all humankind." 
</P>
<P>
That's exactly what Glide Memorial United Methodist Church in San Francisco 
tries to do in its approach to addiction. In January, 800 members and 
supporters marched into the Valencia Gardens housing project in the 
drug-infested Tenderloin district, proclaiming "unconditional love" and 
announcing that "recovery time" had arrived for addicts and their families. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than simply forcing drug dealers to move a few blocks away -- a 
"drug-busting" technique that Glide's effervescent pastor, Cecil Williams, 
doesn't favor -- "We told the pushers, and the users, 'You stay here,' " he 
said. " 'The total community needs recovery. We're coming in with unconditional 
love. We're your family.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Most dope addicts feel lost, ashamed, rejected and empty," Williams continued. 
"They've lost all their friends and family and relationships. So what I did was 
fix them a new family." 
</P>
<P>
Williams' remedial approach -- faith and resistance -- has successfully 
liberated many from drugs, according to Charles Jackson, counselor for San 
Francisco's Substance Abuse Referral Unit. Jackson particularly praised Glide's 
program for "young crack mothers." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who is a close friend to May, has hosted several national conferences 
bringing thousands of church and community drug-abuse workers together at Glide 
church. And three years ago he started an informal daily rap session at the 
church called "Open Mike." 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately, 800 addicts came forward to share their stories, and out of 
that forum seven recovery groups were formed, Williams said. About 800 people 
have since completed the program and joined what Williams calls the church's 
"extended family." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said about 93% of those completing the church recovery program stay 
off cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Glide's marches into Valencia Gardens and, later, the violence-prone Army 
Street Dwellings in the Mission District, enlisted the support and presence of 
social service agencies, the police, the city's health and recreation 
departments, other recovery groups and community activists. 
</P>
<P>
Police Capt. Michael Hebel of the San Francisco Police Department's Mission 
Station reported that in the four-month period after the Glide "takeover" at 
Valencia Gardens, crimes of all types decreased significantly and there was "a 
resurgence in pride and hope" throughout the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly important, Hebel added, was the message to area crack dealers: 
"Help in overcoming their addiction is available, and this (housing) project is 
not their turf." 
</P>
<P>
That message also has been proclaimed loud and clear at Crest-Moore-King United 
Methodist Church in South Dallas, where Williams' brother is a member. 
</P>
<P>
The pastor, Rev. Patrick Williams (no relation), put together a citywide 
coalition to crack down on cocaine. More than 100 marchers, including the mayor 
and several state legislators, closed down three crack houses. And a grant of 
$534,000 has been obtained to open a center for teen-age substance abusers 
early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Williams said effective drug programs usually involve religious 
coalitions that often include Jews and Muslims (the Nation of Islam). Religious 
task forces are at work in Detroit, Chicago, New York and Baton Rouge, among 
other cities, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Several church-related ministries have been working to save abusers for a long 
time. 
</P>
<P>
The interdenominational Teen Challenge ministry, founded in 1969, staffs 114 
highly successful recovery centers throughout the country -- seven are in 
Southern California -- where young people can get off drugs and out of gangs. A 
survey found that 86% of those who completed the program were drug-free five 
years later, said Phil Cookes, director of the Teen Challenge office in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Toberman Settlement House in San Pedro, founded in 1903 to provide social 
services, food and clothing for the needy, has operated a substance-abuse 
diversion program during the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
Funded by the United Methodist Board of Global Ministries, the interfaith house 
is headed by a Jewish layman. Counseling, in cooperation with county law 
enforcement authorities, and job training and placement are provided for about 
70 recovering addicts each year. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent evening at Toberman, about 15 men and women of varying ages and 
races shared their stories with a visitor during their regular group session. 
</P>
<P>
"I can talk about my feelings here," said a young man named Jay, who preferred 
not to use his full name. "It's like a family. You can lay everything out on 
the table." 
</P>
<P>
Tra, 21, who had recently spent three days in jail after his first cocaine 
arrest, was just beginning the 20-week court-mandated course at Toberman. 
</P>
<P>
"People here are like your big brother," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They're down to earth. It's working for me," added Mario, 32, who said he'd 
failed other drug diversion courses. 
</P>
<P>
Manuella Villejas, 33, a former heroin user for 10 years, said that "the 
one-on-one counseling and personal care" at Toberman gave it an edge over 
diversion programs that lack "the religious component." 
</P>
<P>
Villejas not only completed the course; she is now the secretary at Toberman 
House, which was named after J. R. Toberman, mayor of Los Angeles in the 1870s 
and '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Villejas said the counselors, who also present programs at schools and "work 
the streets" in the Harbor area, helped her acquire office skills and schooling 
that led to a high school diploma. She said they also helped negotiate the 
return of her baby, placed in foster care by the court because of her 
addiction. 
</P>
<P>
Toberman's success rate for people one year after treatment is 65% to 70%, 
according to director Howard Ullman. All clients are tested for drug use on a 
random basis, he said, and Toberman's five counselors are certified by the Los 
Angeles County Probation Department and other education and treatment agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Declared James Davis, the counselors' supervisor and the son of a minister in 
the Church of God in Christ: "People have only been helped if they can reach 
back and help someone else in a living chain of progress. . . . God is the 
strength you have to go to." 
</P>
<P>
In this vein, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference is launching a 
national program, Wings of Hope, to involve churches in substance-abuse 
programs and provide support to one another. A Los Angeles chapter with perhaps 
a dozen cooperating churches is being contemplated, according to Faith United 
Methodist pastor Robinson-Gaither. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cecil Williams and Bishop May have announced that the first-ever 
church-wide conference on drug abuse will be held in October or November, 
featuring a "top-level think tank" of church, political, community and 
therapeutic leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The government seems unable to muster "an all-out assault" on drugs because of 
bureaucratic sluggishness and the "horrendous problem of coordination," May 
said, adding that he believes churches can do a better job of "reaching people 
on the street." 
</P>
<P>
The United Methodist Church alone has more churches than the U.S. Postal 
Service has post offices, he noted, suggesting that recovery groups could meet 
in church facilities and also at retreat centers and closed Army camps and 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
But chances of funding such a grand plan seem unlikely, given the fact that the 
United Methodists are having difficulty funding and staffing just the 14-church 
project in Southeast Washington through the summer. 
</P>
<P>
And some within the church question whether May's effort can succeed where 
local churches, the police and the government have made only isolated progress. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just not sure what one bishop can do," said Robert Wilson, a professor of 
Methodist history at Duke University. 
</P>
<P>
May nevertheless remains optimistic, though he characterized the "human misery" 
in drug-torn sections of Washington and New York as "overwhelming" and "too 
painful to talk about." 
</P>
<P>
Shedding a ray of hope, he said, is a United Methodist program asking all 
members to keep an electric candle in their window. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a symbol of a family in a drug-free home," he explained. "When you're 
out (walking the streets) you see those candles burning and, you know, things 
are better than we thought. . . . We may not be able to save an entire 
community, but we can save some."

VOLUNTEERS HELP COMMUNITY DIG ITSELF OUT OF A QUAKE

WATSONVILLE, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since early May, a motley construction crew of Bay Area residents -- from 
plumbers to musicians to computer specialists -- has trekked to this farming 
town south of Santa Cruz to build a $1-million beacon of hope for a community 
hard-hit by last October's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Just a couple of blocks from a flattened stretch of the predominantly Latino 
town's main drag, the San Francisco-area volunteers are helping local residents 
build a 6,400-square-foot community center. 
</P>
<P>
When it opens Saturday, the structure will provide more than just a cultural 
hub for the city, which sustained damages of $60 million in the quake and also 
will lose 410 jobs when one of the area's largest employers relocates some 
operations next year. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the effort hope the new center also will spark a bit of a 
renaissance in this city of 30,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We were interested in helping shift the attitude of the community from 
building from ground zero to looking forward," said Nancy Handelman, director 
of the Oakland-based Sterling Community Service Foundation, which organized the 
nine-week project. "We wanted to show Watsonville that it wasn't alone." 
</P>
<P>
Community leaders and residents who have contributed time to the project said 
the effort has paid off. 
</P>
<P>
"This is incredible, the outpouring of support in terms of time, energy, blood, 
sweat and tears," said Delilah Valadez, a Watsonville Volunteer Center activist 
who helps out weekends at the city-donated site. "We haven't seen anything like 
this since the earthquake, or before it. This shows what can be done with hard 
work, vision and teamwork." 
</P>
<P>
The center, to be dedicated Saturday, will give Watsonville residents an 
inexpensive place to hold receptions, ethnic dances, English classes and 
retraining sessions for some of the workers who are losing their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Pillsbury/Green Giant Co., one of the area's largest employers, announced in 
April it would lay off 410 of its 550 peak-season workers by 1991 when it moves 
its cauliflower- and broccoli-freezing operations to Mexico and Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Coming in the aftermath of the quake, the prospect of unemployment has been 
dispiriting for many. 
</P>
<P>
"All this has really wracked people who were already disadvantaged," said one 
volunteer, Cecile Mills, a computer technician for a bilingual community 
newspaper, El Andar. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I just want to pull my hair out and move to Portland." 
</P>
<P>
A company spokesman said Pillsbury/Green Giant is making the move for economic 
reasons. He said the company is negotiating a severance package with the union, 
and also will take steps to retrain workers. 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly won't eliminate the fact that some people are losing their jobs, 
but hopefully we can make the transition a little easier," said Duane Larson, 
plant manager. 
</P>
<P>
The Sterling Community Service Foundation's leaders and volunteers said their 
main goal is to build a spirit of cooperation and hope, something that will go 
beyond the immediate benefits provided by the community center, located in 
Marinovich Park on 2nd Street. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation originally drew up plans to build the structure as a schoolhouse 
in earthquake-ravaged Soviet Armenia. But when the 1989 temblor hit the Bay 
Area, Sterling officials decided to use their resources closer to home. The 
group has spent $75,000 on building materials. Labor and other building 
materials were donated. The city will own the center. 
</P>
<P>
Watsonville qualifies for about $4 million in federal and state disaster aid, 
and could receive more once officials complete formal reports on the earthquake 
damage. So far, the city has received about $2 million in government relief, 
said Terry Stigall, Watsonville finance director. 
</P>
<P>
So, efforts to mop up quake-related destruction in the city -- estimated by 
Stigall to be about $60 million -- have fallen mostly to local groups with 
limited resources. 
</P>
<P>
The city has received $1 million in outside relief donations, which local 
government officials have channeled largely to low-income homeowners through 
house reconstruction grants. In a separate project, a local interdenominational 
relief group has been rebuilding some of the 250 houses knocked off their 
foundations, with homeowners paying only for the cost of materials. 
</P>
<P>
The Sterling project has also funneled help from more affluent areas to the 
north, bringing together members of the farming community and residents of San 
Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, Santa Cruz and elsewhere. An average of 130 or 
more volunteers have shown up at the site every Saturday and Sunday to help 
out. 
</P>
<P>
"What I do for a living is not that fulfilling in a spiritual sense," said Matt 
Lyons, 29, a computer systems analyst from Fremont. "This gives me a chance to 
give something back. It's a chance to stand for something." 
</P>
<P>
On weekend work days, the one-story community center structure has been abuzz 
with activity. A roving safety crew barks commands, encouragement and jokes to 
small teams of volunteers -- including some construction industry professionals 
-- as they go about tasks as varied as hanging doors, installing insulation and 
painting walls. 
</P>
<P>
For the construction workers who leave their weekday jobs only to drive 90 
miles and ply their trade for free on the weekend, the project offers a reward 
not found on every project, said Harvey Rosen, 48, a Berkeley electrical 
contractor who acted as the community center project manager on a recent work 
day. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're out on a regular construction site, that building doesn't 
represent anything," Rosen said. "This building represents the community. This 
building represents people. 
</P>
<P>
"To me," he said, "this is a miracle." 
</P>
<P>
It also has a practical payoff. "It's going to fill a need that's been here for 
as long as I've lived in Watsonville," said Valadez, a 25-year resident. 
</P>
<P>
Already, the street looks nicer, residents said. The basketball court that used 
to sprawl across the community center site is gone. So are the graffiti and the 
crowd of street gang members who used to hang out there. The house next door 
has a fresh coat of ocean-blue paint. The people who live there said they 
painted it so their home would look as nice as the new center. 
</P>
<P>
Still, when the dedication ceremony is over, a lot of work will remain to be 
done in Watsonville. 
</P>
<P>
Few are more aware of that than project volunteer Herman Goon. 
</P>
<P>
Until last year, Goon, 65, owned a small dry goods store and a little house, 
each about two blocks from the nearly completed community center. He lost 
everything in the quake -- store, inventory, house. His insurance covered 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Now, pushed into early retirement by the catastrophe, Goon shows up bright and 
early on weekend mornings to help build the center in his old neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
When his fellow volunteers pack up and leave, the town's problems -- 
unemployment, a downtown partly in ruins -- will remain, he said. It will be a 
battle to keep alive the community spirit inspired by the community center 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"Watsonville will be a little while before it can build up," Goon said. "We've 
got to solve the problems ourselves now."

SENTENCE OF DEATH FOR KILLER IS UPHELD; 
</P>
<P>
COURT APPEAL: THE STATE JUSTICES UNANIMOUSLY REJECT THE DEFENDANT'S PLEA IN A 
12-YEAR-OLD MURDER CASE.

<P>
The state Supreme Court, ruling in a 12-year-old murder case, upheld the death 
penalty Thursday for a defendant whose previous sentence was reversed because 
of questions about his mental fitness for trial. 
</P>
<P>
The high court unanimously turned down an appeal from Douglas Ray Stankewitz, 
now 32, who was found guilty and condemned to die for the fatal shooting of a 
Modesto woman during a robbery and kidnaping in February, 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Stankewitz had won a retrial in 1982 when the court, in a 4-2 ruling by 
then-Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird, held that he had been improperly denied 
a hearing on whether he was mentally incompetent to stand trial and assist in 
his own defense. 
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's decision, the high court refused to grant Stankewitz a third 
trial, rejecting a series of defense claims in a 73-page opinion by newly 
appointed Justice Armand Arabian, his first since joining the court in March. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the court turned down Stankewitz's contention that the jury 
should have been instructed to "view with distrust" the testimony of a young 
witness who was with the defendant and two adult accomplices when they abducted 
Theresa Greybeal, 22, in a store parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, 14 at the time, was granted immunity. He testified that after the 
abduction, the group drove the woman's car to Fresno in search of heroin. 
Later, in the nearby community of Calwa, he said he saw Stankewitz walk up to 
the victim, take careful aim and shoot her in the head. 
</P>
<P>
After Greybeal fell to the ground, the boy said, Stankewitz turned to a 
confederate and said, "Did I drop her or did I drop her?" The confederate 
responded, "You dropped her," as both men began to giggle. 
</P>
<P>
The justices ruled that the boy's involvement in the crimes had been "extremely 
limited" and that his testimony was not inherently suspect. 
</P>
<P>
After his first conviction and death sentence were reversed by the high court, 
Stankewitz was retried in Fresno County and once again, the question of his 
mental competence was raised by the public defender representing him. As he had 
at his first trial, Stankewitz accused the public defender of conspiring with 
the prosecutor -- a claim that a psychiatrist at the first trial said appeared 
to be a sign of paranoid delusion. 
</P>
<P>
The trial judge appointed two psychiatrists to examine Stankewitz but he 
refused to communicate with either and asked for another lawyer to represent 
him. The judge appointed a private attorney to represent Stankewitz and allowed 
the case to proceed. Again, Stankewitz was convicted and sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
Stankewitz's lawyers on appeal contended that the judge, before naming a new 
attorney, should have suspended all proceedings and conducted a full-scale 
hearing to hear what they said was clear evidence that Stankewitz was not fit 
to be tried. 
</P>
<P>
But the high court rejected that contention. "The only evidence that the 
defendant could not cooperate and assist in his defense was his delusion that 
the public defender was in collusion with the prosecutor," Arabian wrote. 
</P>
<P>
John P. Ward of Oakland, an attorney for Stankewitz, said he would ask the 
state Supreme Court for a rehearing and, if necessary, pursue the appeal in the 
federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
Ward said he would contend also that Stankewitz, an American Indian, should 
have been tried in another county. "Where an Indian is tried in California has 
a substantial impact . . . and we believe there was substantial bias in Fresno 
County," he said.

Labor Secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole announced Thursday that the Department 
of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration has levied more than $500,000 
in fines against Pyro Mining Co. for violations uncovered in the investigation 
of a coal mine explosion that killed 10 people last year. 
</P>
<P>
"The fine we are levying today is the largest penalty in history to result from 
a single mine accident," Dole said. "It signifies the gravity of the violations 
and the commitment of the department to see that our nation's miners work under 
safe conditions." 
</P>
<P>
The agency has assessed Pyro Mining Co. a total of $507,996 in civil penalties 
for 121 violations found during the investigation of the Sept. 13, 1989, 
methane explosion at Pyro's William Station Mine in Union County, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
William Tattersall, assistant secretary for the Mine Safety and Health 
Administration, said: "We consider the violations in this case so flagrant and 
indicative of the company's negligence that this fine is warranted." 
</P>
<P>
The department said Pyro was fined $10,000 for each of 10 violations, the 
maximum civil penalty for a violation. Fines of $8,000 each were imposed for 26 
more violations, including 19 violations involving failure to make required 
preshift safety examinations and seven electrical violations. An additional 13 
violations, mainly involving electrical safety, resulted in fines of $6,500 
each. Lesser penalties were imposed for the other violations. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said the investigators' report determined that the William 
Station Mine explosion occurred after several violations of mine ventilation 
requirements allowed explosive methane gas to accumulate undetected. 
Investigators identified a machine with multiple electrical safety deficiencies 
as one of five possible ignition sources. 
</P>
<P>
James Greenlee, executive vice president of Costain Coal Inc., which owns Pyro 
Mining Co., said: "We're just not making any comment at all beyond the fact 
that we're surprised by the size of the penalty. The appeal is in process, and 
we will continue that."

JAPAN MAY GO ITS OWN WAY ON ECONOMIC AID TO CHINA; 
</P>

SANCTIONS: TOKYO ARGUES THAT BEIJING SHOULD NOT BE ISOLATED FROM THE WORLD

Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu was reported Thursday to have told leaders of his 
ruling party that Japan may make its "own independent judgment" on removing a 
freeze on its economic aid to China after next week's Houston economic summit. 
</P>
<P>
In a dinner meeting before Kaifu leaves today to meet President Bush on 
Saturday, four executives of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party urged Kaifu to 
explain to leaders of the United States and the five other advanced 
industrialized democracies who will meet Monday through Wednesday in Houston 
that "Japan and China have a special relationship." 
</P>
<P>
"I intend to do that," Kaifu was reported as replying. "I also intend to seek 
the understanding of the United States about China and inform President Bush 
that Japan may make its own decision" on resuming economic aid. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Nihon Keizai and the Yomiuri newspapers carried the report of Kaifu's 
comments in their morning editions today. 
</P>
<P>
Japan and the World Bank are China's two main sources of economic aid. Japan is 
also a major source of private commercial loans to China. Those loans also were 
suspended after the seven nations agreed to impose economic sanctions at last 
year's economic summit in reaction to China's violent suppression of 
pro-democracy demonstrations in June last year. 
</P>
<P>
The "special relationship" that the ruling party leaders cited was a reference 
to Japan's past aggression against China and the important role that Japanese 
aid plays in underwriting improvements in China's infrastructure, such as 
railways, dams, ports, and natural resource development. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, three former prime ministers -- Zenko Suzuki, Yasuhiro Nakasone 
and Noboru Takeshita -- also urged Kaifu to press the other six leaders at the 
Houston summit to resume economic aid to China. 
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry official, who met foreign correspondents on the condition 
that he not be named, said Japan has consistently argued that China must not be 
isolated from the international community. 
</P>
<P>
The diplomat cited China's release of more than 500 political prisoners, the 
lifting of martial law in both Beijing and Lhasa, Tibet, China's resumption of 
the Fulbright exchange of scholars with the United States, its release of 
dissident Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li Shuxian, and, "most important, the firm 
commitment of the Chinese leadership to . . . policies of reform and openness." 
</P>
<P>
"The thing we have to do now is respond in kind to these positive signs 
emanating from China," he said. "The best way to promote democracy in China is 
to shore up the living standard of the people." 
</P>
<P>
Apart from whatever action Japan itself may take, the diplomat said, Kaifu will 
oppose any economic summit declaration that reiterates last year's "censure" of 
China for the June 3-4, 1989, crackdown around central Beijing's Tian An Men 
Square, "let alone imposing additional sanctions." 
</P>
<P>
During a trip to China in August, 1988, Takeshita promised that Japan would 
extend a five-year package of 810 billion yen ($5.4 billion) in loans to China 
between 1990 and 1994. Negotiations to select projects for the loans, however, 
have been frozen since Japan joined the other six nations in approving 
sanctions against China. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Japan provided China with $747.5 million in loans for infrastructure 
projects.

KENYA CRACKS DOWN, JAILS 5 OPPONENTS OF ONE-PARTY RULE;

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a sign of government unease with a growing opposition movement, police here 
have jailed five leading supporters of multi-party democracy in a crackdown 
that began Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The most prominent figures detained in the government action are Kenneth Matiba 
and Charles Rubia, both former Cabinet ministers in the government of President 
Daniel Arap Moi, and Gitobu Imanyara, editor of the Nairobi Law Review. Matiba 
and Rubia have publicly called for an end to the monopoly party rule of the 
Kenya African National Union, or KANU, and Imanyara's journal has published 
articles in support of ending one-party rule. 
</P>
<P>
Matiba and Rubia were picked up by squads of police late Wednesday and driven 
off to unknown destinations, according to family members and newspaper reports. 
Accounts of Imanyara's arrest were confused, with the Associated Press later 
quoting an associate of his as saying the editor had escaped police and gone 
into hiding. 
</P>
<P>
Detained Thursday were John Khaminwa, a lawyer for Rubia who was reported 
arrested after he entered a Nairobi police station inquiring about his client, 
and Raila Odinga, a two-time political detainee who is the son of Oginga 
Odinga, a key political figure here in the 1970s and 1980s and a leader of the 
important Luo tribe. The Odingas were reported in the Kenya press recently as 
having held meetings with Matiba and Rubia. Five members of Matiba's staff were 
also detained. 
</P>
<P>
Police are reportedly also set to detain several other members of Kenya's 
burgeoning opposition. 
</P>
<P>
The surge of detentions Thursday brought a response from the U.S. Embassy here, 
which expressed "interest and concern." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have expressed increasing concern and anger over plans by Matiba 
and Rubia for an unofficial rally in favor of political pluralism scheduled for 
Saturday at a field in the center of Nairobi, and they have announced that 
police would use force to keep the rally from getting under way. 
</P>
<P>
President Moi recently charged in a speech that the two men were planning to 
have demonstrators at Saturday's rally shot and to blame the killings on the 
government. Matiba and Rubia, in a joint statement issued about an hour before 
they were picked up Wednesday, denied that. They said their application to hold 
the rally at Nairobi's Kamukunji Park had been turned down and that they had 
dropped the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The detentions climaxed a war of nerves between the government and Matiba and 
Rubia that began several weeks ago, when the two former ministers issued a call 
for multi-party democracy in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last two weeks, Matiba's and Rubia's offices have been under police 
surveillance and their visitors have been tailed. Police broke up press 
conferences and interview sessions held by both men and seized their passports. 
</P>
<P>
An attempt by police to arrest them June 20 for "holding an illegal meeting" -- 
they were consulting with their lawyer, Paul Muite -- was aborted when a large 
crowd gathered around the sidewalk confrontation between the three men and six 
plainclothes police officers. 
</P>
<P>
On June 13, a gang of men dressed in civilian clothes but addressing each other 
by military rank invaded Matiba's house. They asked for him by name and, when 
told he was not at home, severely beat his wife and daughter before escaping 
with a pocketbook and a cheap necklace. 
</P>
<P>
Matiba charged that the episode, which the police called a burglary, was an 
assassination attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Any confrontation between President Moi and the emerging forces for political 
change could severely damage what has so far been an African success story. 
Kenya's political stability and economic success have long held the attention 
of Africa-watchers. Since Moi came to power in 1978, there has been only one 
major eruption of unrest -- an attempted coup in 1982 by officers of the Kenyan 
air force. It was quickly put down. 
</P>
<P>
During this same period, unrest has flared repeatedly in neighboring countries: 
civil war in Uganda, repression and ethnic war in Marxist Ethiopia, civil war 
and an Islamic fundamentalist coup in Sudan, a near-total breakdown of 
government authority in Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1982, Moi has steadily tightened his and his party's autocratic grip on 
Kenya. Constitutional amendments have outlawed opposition parties and made the 
tenure of once-independent judges subject to the president's wish. 
</P>
<P>
In a move against the press, a Kenyan court on June 29 charged four editors of 
a Nairobi newspaper with publishing material "likely to cause fear, alarm and 
despondency" among the public. The editors of the Standard newspaper were 
charged after the paper ran a series of stories implying that the government 
lied about a Nairobi slum clearance operation that turned violent last May. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, economic growth has failed to keep pace with population growth, 
which is among the world's highest, and Kenya's economic status has slipped. 
Spreading corruption has driven away foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
The country would have much to lose in any extended outbreak of public unrest 
or an escalation of the crackdown on dissent. Tourism is Kenya's leading 
foreign-exchange earner; last year about 700,000 visitors spent an estimated 
$340 million here. 
</P>
<P>
Further, Kenya's budget is increasingly dependent on aid from Western donor 
countries. Foreign aid loans and grants account for 27% of the budget this 
fiscal year, compared to only 5% three years ago. U.S. aid totaled $76.4 
million last year, including $15 million in military assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, however, the United States has put the Kenyan government on notice 
that democratic countries are likely to get preference in the future. The 
notice came from Smith Hempstone, U.S. ambassador to Kenya, in a speech to a 
local businessmen's group in which he described the new standard as 
congressional policy. 
</P>
<P>
Herman J. Cohen, the assistant secretary of state for African affairs, said in 
a speech in Washington last April that the U.S. government would show "a change 
in attitude toward the African one-party state (and that) it is time for most 
African political systems to evolve toward a Western-style democracy." 
</P>
<P>
Before this week's arrests, the political crackdown here had already elicited a 
stern reaction from three influential American lawmakers, Reps. Howard Wolpe 
(D-Mich.), chairman of a House subcommittee on Africa and a frequent critic of 
Moi; Gus Yatron (D-Pa.), chairman of a subcommittee on human rights, and Dante 
Fascell (D-Fla.), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Moi, the three focused on the "harassment" of lawyer Muite and 
the conviction of the Rev. Lawford Imunde, a Presbyterian minister who was 
sentenced to six years in jail on the basis of what were deemed seditious 
entries in his diary. Imunde has appealed his sentence on grounds that some of 
the entries were made by the police and that he was tortured into signing a 
confession and pressured into waiving his right to counsel. 
</P>
<P>
These two episodes, the letter states, are "the most visible signs of growing 
hostility toward independent voices in Kenya by your government." 
</P>
<P>
The letter continues: "At a time when, throughout the world, we are witnessing 
the formation of pluralist democracies -- characterized by multi-party 
elections, respect for human rights and tolerance of opposition views -- we are 
deeply concerned about government efforts to suppress such initiative in 
Kenya." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, open criticism of Moi's leadership and of KANU, the only legal 
political party here, has also come from several leading Kenyan institutions. 
</P>
<P>
In the most serious sign of dissatisfaction, 18 Roman Catholic clerics, 
including Cardinal Maurice Otunga, the archbishop of Nairobi, on June 22 issued 
a pastoral letter assailing the political situation and the deteriorating 
economic climate. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, which appeared as a full-page advertisement by the Kenya Episcopal 
Conference in the country's three major newspapers, attacked what it called 
widespread corruption in the country and the voting system known as "queuing." 
In primary elections -- key contests in a single-party state -- voters do not 
mark a ballot but line up behind photographs of their favored candidate. 
</P>
<P>
The churchmen reserved their most stinging criticism for the increasing 
authority of the party over Parliament and other government institutions. 
</P>
<P>
"The least sign of dissent in the face of any particular decision of the party 
is often interpreted as subversive and as endangering the security of the 
state," the bishops complained. They compared the situation to the "philosophy 
of 'national security' " that gave birth to death squads, murder by torture and 
a breakdown of civil liberties in Latin America in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The political waters here have been stormy since the mysterious death Feb. 13 
of Dr. Robert Ouko, Moi's minister of foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Although political assassination has never been Moi's style -- it was with his 
predecessor, Jomo Kenyatta -- there has been widespread public suspicion that 
someone in the administration was involved in the Ouko death. Still, there has 
been no reliable explanation of why an apparently loyal member of Moi's Cabinet 
should be killed. 
</P>
<P>
Ouko's body was found near his home, charred and mutilated. When the police 
suggested that he had committed suicide, demonstrations broke out in major 
cities and marchers carried placards charging a cover-up.

HAVEL BECOMES 1ST FREELY ELECTED CZECHOSLOVAK LEADER IN 55 YEARS

<P>
Former dissident playwright Vaclav Havel became Czechoslovakia's first freely 
elected president in 55 years Thursday, marking the end of the first phase in 
the country's move toward democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"I promise that within the limits of my prerogatives and to the best of my 
ability . . . I will do everything to help lead this country to a better 
future," he told thousands of well-wishers thronging the courtyard of Prague's 
Hradcany Castle, the president's official residence. 
</P>
<P>
Havel, 53, was elected for a two-year term by a secret ballot of parliamentary 
deputies, winning the necessary three-fifths majority. He was the only 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 284 deputies present out of the 300-member Parliament, 234 voted for 
Havel and 50 against. 
</P>
<P>
The Parliament itself was voted into office last month, in the country's first 
democratic elections since 1946. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovakia's last freely elected president was Eduard Benes, elected in 
1935, who resigned after the Communist Party seized power in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
The playwright and long-time dissident was leader of the Civic Forum human 
rights movement, which spearheaded the toppling of Czechoslovakia's Communist 
dictatorship in a peaceful popular revolt last November. 
</P>
<P>
Havel was first elected interim president in December and pledged to guide the 
country to free elections. After this, the new Parliament, elected for two 
years, was free to decide who was to lead the country.

KREMLIN: UNLIKE ITS FORMER SATELLITES, THE NATION CANNOT COMPLETELY DUMP THE 
FOUNDATION ON WHICH ITS STRUCTURE HAS BEEN BUILT.

<P>
In Poland, Hungary and Bulgaria, it was Communist Party leaders, not 
disgruntled dissidents, who kicked out the Stalinist supports of their power, 
undermining the ruling monopolies and triggering the collapse of communism 
throughout Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest of Communist dominoes shows no sign that it is ready to fall. 
</P>
<P>
The ideology is in crisis in the Soviet Union for failing to deliver on a 
century-old promise of a workers' paradise, but the descendants of the 
revolutionaries who transformed Karl Marx's theories into governing practice 
have neither the desire nor the ability to throw out the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
The future of Soviet communism is at stake at the 28th Communist Party 
Congress, where political leaders are battling to redraft the ideological 
charts that have guided them out of dictatorship and into disaster. 
</P>
<P>
High-level hand-wringing over how to extricate the nation from an economic 
morass of the party's making will likely prompt the congress to make course 
corrections that traditional Marxists might consider a betrayal of the 
Communist cause. But the power brokers of the world's first socialist state are 
talking about repairs, not the wholesale replacement of their system. 
</P>
<P>
Communism cannot be given the bum's rush from the Soviet Union, as happened in 
Eastern Europe last year, because it created the moral, economic and political 
foundation on which the national structure sheltering 290 million Soviet 
citizens has been built. 
</P>
<P>
Jobs, homes, medical care, schooling, transport, industry, even movies and 
books -- all are the products of the Communist Party's managers, planners, 
engineers, ideologists and intellectuals driven by the goal of creating a 
Utopian world. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike in Eastern Europe, where revolution rolled in with Red Army tanks, 
communism -- at least in 1917 -- was the deliberate choice of a majority of the 
Russian people. 
</P>
<P>
"Marxism was accepted and developed by Russia. A synthesis of social and 
historical circumstances made the Russia of 1917 a propitious soil for Marxist 
revolutionary ferment," said Ivan I. Antonovich, a social scientist on the 
staff of the party's policy-making Central Committee. "This fact can't be 
ignored, no matter what came later." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet dictator Josef Stalin imposed the ideology on Eastern Europe after the 
1945 Yalta Conference among the World War II Allies deeded control over the 
vanquished region to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovakia had been a prosperous democracy, and rich agricultural 
traditions in Poland and Hungary lived in the memories of the repressed peoples 
through four decades of Soviet domination that never succeeded in convincing 
Eastern Europeans of communism's appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Neither did communism win hearts and minds in the Baltic nations of Estonia, 
Latvia and Lithuania, which Stalin had taken over in an earlier deal with Nazi 
Germany. Today, as a result, Soviet communism faces its greatest challenge from 
this region as each nation seeks to secede. 
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev gave the fraternal nations of socialism the 
weapons for peaceful liberation when he wrote into his perestroika reform 
script the right of each state to self-determination. 
</P>
<P>
Polish Communists caved in to pressure to legalize the Solidarity trade union. 
Hungary opened a hole in the Iron Curtain by tearing down barbed-wire fences 
that had locked its people into Moscow's unwelcome alliance. East Germans 
poured through the new opening, bringing down the government in East Berlin. 
And Czechoslovaks, Romanians and Bulgarians followed suit by ousting hard-line 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
But Soviets have 73 years of history to justify, not an occupation force to 
overcome. 
</P>
<P>
"The thought that there will be a collapse of socialism here is only wishful 
thinking or a misreading of the developments," observed Michael Davidow, an 
American Communist who has spent 12 years in Moscow as a journalist for the 
People's Daily World, the U.S. party newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet Union is not Poland, it is not Czechoslovakia or the GDR (East 
Germany)," he said. "It led the revolution" for socialist government. 
</P>
<P>
A leading Soviet economist, Oleg T. Bogomolov, has warned that what worked for 
the small nations of Eastern Europe in the way of reform does not necessarily 
apply to a superpower where every accomplishment has been the result, or fault, 
of socialist planning. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview on the consequences of Eastern Europe's break from the Kremlin 
orbit, Bogomolov told the weekly Literary Gazette that changing the socialist 
system that permeates every aspect of Soviet life is a colossal task to be 
undertaken in carefully measured doses. 
</P>
<P>
"A milligram of explosive is one thing, a ton of TNT that could destroy 
everything around is quite another," warned Bogomolov, one of Gorbachev's 
closest advisers on the economy and foreign relations. 
</P>
<P>
The current congress, which is seeking to retune the ideological machinery, has 
been confronted by a small group of radicals demanding sweeping changes like 
those employed by East European Communists to dismantle their dictatorships 
from the top. 
</P>
<P>
But the Democratic Platform, a left-wing faction within the party pressing for 
the Communists' divestiture of power, is promoted by only about 5% of the 
almost 4,700 delegates, and new rifts have formed even within those meager 
ranks. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Communist Party's best protection against ouster is probably the 
absence of an alternative force capable of running what remains a superpower 
and the world's second-largest economy. 
</P>
<P>
Fledgling political parties were merged in Hungary, Czechoslovakia, East 
Germany and Poland from the dissident and pro-independence groups that operated 
for years on the outskirts of political tolerance. In elections over the past 
year, voters in all these countries have chosen governments in which 
non-Communists are the dominant element. 
</P>
<P>
In Bulgaria, the Soviet Union's closest remaining ally, opposition groups were 
unable to convince voters in an election last spring that the Communists should 
be replaced. Romanians, in a popular uprising, overthrew the Communist 
dictatorship and dissolved the Communist Party, but then in May, elected a 
government made up of former party leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Unofficial groups have formed throughout the Soviet Union to champion such 
various causes as environmental protection, women's issues, political pluralism 
and the rights of veterans. But a unified political party with the structure 
and breadth to govern a nation has not yet developed to challenge the Communist 
monolith. 
</P>
<P>
Conservatives from the provincial regions that have suffered the most from a 
chronic dearth of food, goods and services have been the loudest voices at the 
congress against turning away from the socialist cause. 
</P>
<P>
Georgy Bukharov, a miner who addressed fellow Communists this week with an 
impassioned plea for reason and restraint, criticized the party for putting up 
with renegade members working to undo the history of the Soviet Union.

JACKSON WILL RUN FOR D.C. POST DESIGNED TO PROMOTE STATEHOOD

The Rev. Jesse Jackson announced on Thursday that he will run for one of the 
District of Columbia's two "shadow senator" posts to lobby Congress to grant 
the city statehood. 
</P>
<P>
"Statehood for the District of Columbia is the most important civil rights 
issue in America today," Jackson said. "More people live here than five states; 
we pay more taxes than 10 states; we pay more taxes per capita than 49 states, 
and yet no vote on Capitol Hill." 
</P>
<P>
He said election to the shadow post would have no bearing on whether he decides 
to run for President in 1992. "The two are not connected whatsoever," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The shadow senators will be unpaid lobbyists for D.C. statehood, with no 
official duties. 
</P>
<P>
The city has one delegate to Congress who may vote in committees but not on the 
floor of the full House. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, a two-time contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, said 
the post would allow him to help "expand democracy" to the district. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's political plans have been the subject of great speculation since he 
moved to the nation's capital last year. 
</P>
<P>
In February, he announced he would not run for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said statehood for the city would benefit the entire nation and the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be the only way to integrate the U.S. Senate," Jackson said. The Senate 
"currently has 98 white males and two white females in a society that is 12% 
African-American and majority female." 
</P>
<P>
There have been three blacks in the Senate, most recently Republican Edward 
Brooke of Massachusetts in the 1970s. Harvey Gantt, who is black, is the 
Democratic Senate nominee in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said the city-state's two senators would fight for "progressive causes" 
such as health care, multicultural and quality education for all Americans and 
safe and affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
"If the American revolutionaries were right, that 'taxation without 
representation is tyranny,' D.C. residents must take the initiative to demand 
statehood if it is ever to be achieved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Initial drafts of the city bill called for $1.3 million to be spent on the two 
shadow senators. But City Council members this year said the positions should 
not be funded in light of the city's budget deficit.

EXTRA HELP FOR ELEMENTARY PUPILS URGED;

EDUCATION: THE HEAD OF THE NEA CALLS FOR A $2.2-BILLION PROGRAM THAT WOULD 
OFFER INTENSIVE TRAINING FOR STUDENTS IN NEED OF ADDED ATTENTION.

<P>
The head of the National Education Assn. on Thursday called for a $2.2-billion 
program that would offer an intensive session to prepare elementary students in 
need of extra attention. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Geiger proposed Operation Jump Start during the opening session of the 
NEA's annual meeting, explaining that the program would be an "all-out, 
full-alert effort to give every elementary child who needs it an educational 
booster shot." 
</P>
<P>
About one-third of the nation's 26 million elementary students would be 
involved, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In his first address as president to the union's policy-making body of about 
8,100 delegates, Geiger asked the federal government to provide half of the 
estimated $2.2 billion needed for Operation Jump Start. States and local school 
districts would pick up the rest. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Geiger said that those identified for Operation Jump 
Start would be given a two-week head start on the school year, in classes 
limited to 15 students. The teachers would be those the students will have 
during the regular school year, Geiger said. 
</P>
<P>
Also at the meeting, the nation's largest teachers union said that public 
schools should offer day care, meals and health screening for preschool, 
kindergarten and elementary pupils. 
</P>
<P>
The NEA board of directors approved a committee report that said public schools 
should be the primary provider of such early childhood services. It said that 
they should be universal, with low or no cost to the child, and that all 
children would have equal access. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of Head Start, most day care or preschool programs are 
offered by private or nonprofit organizations. Head Start provides education, 
meals and health screening for needy youngsters ages 3 to 5, but officials said 
only a small percentage of eligible children are served by the program. 
</P>
<P>
The report did not contain an estimate of the cost of implementing its 
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
The committee said that its recommendations were prompted, in part, by changes 
in American families and the labor force. It also cited changes in the 
demographics of poverty, increases in the preschool population and its changing 
ethnic composition. 
</P>
<P>
NEA statistics showed that between 1960 and 1985, the percentage of traditional 
households -- mother, father, two school-age children -- decreased from 60% to 
7%. 
</P>
<P>
It said also that more than 3.2 million mothers work outside the home, and 
200,000 more mothers join the labor force yearly. By 1995, it is estimated that 
80% of children under age 6 will have mothers working outside the home.

NEIL BUSH FACES PUBLIC HEARING TO ANSWER REGULATORS' CHARGES

Savings and loan regulators Thursday released conflict-of-interest charges 
against President Bush's son Neil and ordered him to answer them at a public 
hearing in September. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision alleged that the younger 
Bush, as a director of Silverado Banking, Savings &amp; Loan Assn. in Denver, 
voted to approve more than $100 million in loans to or business deals with one 
of his business partners, Bill L. Walters. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, in a reply, denied that he had violated his duty as a director and either 
denied the specific charges or said he "lacks sufficient present knowledge or 
information to form a belief as to the allegations." 
</P>
<P>
Both the administrative charges, filed in February, and the reply, filed a 
month later, were made public Thursday for the first time under a new thrift 
office policy. The House Banking Committee had obtained and released a 
preliminary draft of the charges in June. 
</P>
<P>
An administrative law judge is scheduled to hear the Bush case on Sept. 25 in 
Denver before making a recommendation to Timothy Ryan, director of the thrift 
office. 
</P>
<P>
James Nesland, an attorney for Bush, said a public hearing could be exploited 
for political purposes but expressed confidence that the judge would render a 
fair opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Bush served on the board of Silverado from August, 1985, to August, 1988. It 
collapsed in December, 1988, at an estimated cost to taxpayers of $1 billion. 
He has denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
The charges said Bush as a director of Silverado voted to approve loans 
totaling $45 million to Walters, an investor in and lender to Bush's oil 
exploration company, JNB Exploration Co. Bush voted also to approve Silverado's 
purchase of $58.4 million in properties from Walters, the document said. 
</P>
<P>
The thrift office said that Bush had also inadequately disclosed his ties to 
Kenneth Good, a developer who defaulted on loans to Silverado. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan will decide after reviewing the administrative hearing on the case whether 
to issue a cease-and-desist order against Bush, prohibiting him from violating 
regulations in the future. 
</P>
<P>
From now on, the agency generally will release charges and conduct hearings in 
public for the officers of thrifts already closed or seized by the government. 
In order to avoid the danger of mass withdrawals by depositors, proceedings 
against open S&amp;Ls generally will continue to be conducted in private, Ryan 
said.

Heavy smoke from a 14,000-acre wildfire closed part of the Alaska Highway, 
blocking the main road into Alaska as forest and brush fires burned across the 
nation's largest state. Gov. Steve Cowper declared a state of emergency and 
called on the Alaska National Guard to help fight the fires. The blaze that 
closed the highway near Tok about 175 miles southeast of Fairbanks also closed 
two airports, a federal Bureau of Land Management spokeswoman said.

Agricultural crews are releasing tiny stingless wasps in Southern California 
this week as a weapon against the ash whitefly parasite, the state Department 
of Food and Agriculture said. 
</P>
<P>
Pesticides are ineffective and the fly has no known natural enemy in 
California. The speck-sized wasp is the first biological weapon to be used 
against the ash whitefly in California, where it was first detected in Los 
Angeles County in August, 1988. This week's releases are in Los Angeles, 
Orange, Riverside, San Diego, San Bernardino and Ventura counties, where the 
infestations are most intense.

CHAPMAN SHAW ROOT; FORMER COCA-COLA BOTTLING FIRM CHAIRMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chapman Shaw Root, 65, former chairman of the country's largest Coca-Cola 
bottling company and the grandson of the industrialist who designed the 
Coca-Cola bottle in the early 1900s. Root headed Associated Coca-Cola Bottlers 
from 1951 until 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The company had plants in Pennsylvania, Florida, New York and New Jersey. In 
1982, he sold his majority interest in the bottling company to the parent 
company of Coca-Cola for $417.5 million. Last October, Forbes magazine listed 
Root as the 389th wealthiest man in America with a net worth of $290 million. 
In 1966, he formed the Root Co. as parent company of his expanding financial 
holdings. At the time of his death, Root also owned such businesses as the 
Daytona Hilton and radio stations in Florida. Root was the grandson of Chapman 
J. Root, founder and owner of Root Glass Co., the firm that designed and 
patented the distinctive Coke bottle. That design led Chapman J. Root to 
acquire several Coca-Cola bottling franchises which later became the Terre 
Haute-based Associated Coca-Cola Bottlers. In Ormond Beach, Fla., on Monday of 
undisclosed causes.

DEATH BLAMED ON CANCER BY HOSPITAL RULED AN OVERDOSE

<P>
A 74-year old Garden Grove woman whose death was officially attributed to her 
advanced case of breast cancer actually died when a nurse at FHP Hospital 
mistakenly administered a lethal dose of potassium chloride, the Orange County 
coroner ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Although the coroner's office has concluded that the overdose was accidental, 
Fountain Valley Police Sgt. Steven J. Williams said the circumstances 
surrounding Francis Johnson's death, including the hospital's failure to notify 
the coroner of the overdose, are under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
FHP Hospital and corporate officials acknowledged the error Thursday, saying 
the nurse mistakenly administered the potassium chloride instead of a diuretic. 
Dr. Gary E. Goldstein, a regional vice president for the health maintenance 
organization, said the nurse, Maureen Daubert, 37, was deeply traumatized by 
the incident. However, she was fired several days later and remains under 
scrutiny by the California Board of Registered Nursing, a licensing agency, 
according to board executive officer Susan Brank. 
</P>
<P>
Daubert could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson died Nov. 14, 1989, at 5:50 p.m. -- 40 minutes after receiving the 
potassium chloride, according to Deputy County Coroner Bruce Lyle. Paramedics 
had taken her to the hospital a day earlier in a semi-comatose state. Hospital 
officials said her condition was extremely grave at the time of the overdose. 
</P>
<P>
Lyle said the hospital should have reported Johnson's death to his office, as 
required by state law, so an autopsy could have been performed. 
</P>
<P>
Goldstein said hospital officials said they had no intention of hiding the 
overdose, but an internal review found the exact cause of death difficult to 
determine "because any one of several acute problems could have been at fault, 
including the cancer, heart failure and septic shock." 
</P>
<P>
Typically, an injection of potassium chloride, in the appropriate amount, would 
follow a dose of diuretic to replace lost nutrients. Given before the diuretic, 
especially in large amounts, can cause heart failure.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE / ANTHONY PERRY: SHE'LL WHEEL THROUGH C&amp;W CIRCUIT, 
SINGING ABOUT POTHOLES IN LIFE'S ROAD

<P>
Is America ready for a handicapped, sex-changed country-Western singer? 
</P>
<P>
Bobbie Lea Montgomery is betting on it. 
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, while living in San Diego, Montgomery made a splash by becoming 
the first handicapped person to undergo sex-change surgery (he to she). And to 
have it paid for by Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
Later, there was a quickie romance and marriage to a long-haul trucker. And a 
son fathered by her husband and carried to term by her sister as a surrogate. 
</P>
<P>
Then Montgomery and spouse left for Las Vegas, Houston, New Orleans and 
elsewhere and fell off the media radar. 
</P>
<P>
Now she's 43 and living in Nashville with her 9-year-old son, Scooter. She 
feels she has experienced more than enough tragedy and treachery to qualify for 
the country-Western charts: 
</P>
<P>
Three divorces (one as a man, two as a woman), a degenerative bone disease that 
left her wheelchair-bound, years of scorn while living as a transsexual, a wife 
and unborn child killed in a traffic accident, political defeat (for mayor of 
Slidell, La.), an elevator accident, and a husband and marriage ruined by 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
She pulled together $2,500 and hired studio musicians to cut "Heartbreak on 
I-10" on her own label, Sexy Wheels Publishing Co. It's the mournful ballad of 
her failed marriage to the man she met and wooed over the CB radio. 
</P>
<P>
Soon she'll get into her specially equipped Oldsmobile and, like a latter-day 
Loretta Lynn, make the circuit of rural radio stations in the South. 
</P>
<P>
She's searching for a disc jockey ready for something entirely different. 
Sample lyric: 
</P>
<P>
 One day he told me 
</P>
<P>
 If I was in a hospital bed 
</P>
<P>
 With no arms and legs 
</P>
<P>
 He'd still love me. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how much we loved one another, 
</P>
<P>
 But cocaine took it all. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery knows that the country-Western road is littered with potholes and 
heartaches. But she figures there's nothing that she and Scooter can't lick. 
</P>
<P>
"Life is always changing," she says in a soft Southern voice. "I'm proof of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Have a Few Double-Takes 
</P>
<P>
Sights and sites. 
</P>
<P>
* Look-alike. Otherwise, different. 
</P>
<P>
A woman in Marin County is such a ringer for Dianne Feinstein that she posed 
for ads as a Di-clone for Hastings, the chic clothing store, when Feinstein was 
mayor of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
You might figure she'd be supporting Feinstein for governor. Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
She's Grace Bos, sister of San Diego's Otto Bos, campaign director of Pete 
Wilson for governor. She's a Wilsonite. 
</P>
<P>
* Spotted at Cardiff on the Fourth of July: 
</P>
<P>
A young surfer catching a dozen waves. Then dashing back to a group lounging 
under a beach umbrella. Then nursing her month-old baby. 
</P>
<P>
* Another difference between Orange County and San Diego County. 
</P>

EPA WARNS MERGER MAY SLOW EFFORT TO CLEAN AIR; 
</P>
<P>
UTILITIES: THE FEDERAL AGENCY SAYS IT IS CONCERNED THAT THE PLAN INVOLVING 
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON AND A SAN DIEGO UTILITY WILL INCREASE POLLUTION. 
</P>

<P>
The Environmental Protection Agency has warned that the proposed merger of 
Southern California Edison and a San Diego utility may delay Ventura County's 
efforts to meet federal air-quality standards and result in "damage to human 
health, environmental quality, forests, crops and property." 
</P>
<P>
In a document made available Thursday, the EPA recommended that the state 
environmental review of Edison's proposed merger with San Diego Gas &amp; 
Electric Co. be redesigned to show that the merger may interfere with the 
area's progress toward federal clean-air standards. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA said it is particularly concerned by the merger's potential to increase 
air pollution in Ventura County and other areas in Southern California by 
increasing production of electricity and pollution at Edison's plants near 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
The state Public Utilities Commission, which has the authority to approve or 
deny the merger, has been studying the proposal's environmental impact. 
</P>
<P>
The PUC's final environmental impact report was scheduled to be completed late 
last month. It has, however, been delayed until Aug. 10 so that consultants can 
respond to more than 200 comments from the public and governmental agencies, 
said Elaine Russell, supervisor of the PUC's environmental section. 
</P>
<P>
The PUC is expected to make its decision before Jan. 1, 1991, Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
The cities of Ventura and Ojai will consider next week whether to endorse 
Edison's plan. The cities of Simi Valley and Oxnard sent letters of objection 
about the proposed merger to the PUC, raising concerns about increased air 
pollution in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a major issue facing the city of Ventura and all Venturans," said 
Ventura City Councilman Gary Tuttle, who asked that the measure be brought 
before the council. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Edison, the Environmental Coalition and the Ventura County 
Air Pollution Control District will speak before the Ventura City Council on 
Monday. The Ojai City Council will hear the issue on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Edison proposes to merge its operations with San Diego Gas &amp; Electric in a 
move that will save Edison $1.7 billion over 10 years. Edison plans to phase 
out older power production plants in the San Diego system and shift operations 
to newer plants in Ventura County and the Los Angeles region. 
</P>
<P>
By increasing electricity production at its two Ventura County plants at Ormond 
Beach and Mandalay Bay, Edison would increase pollutants by an average of 200 
tons a year over 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
The increase in emissions would peak in 1994 when stepped-up operations would 
add 706 tons of nitrogen oxides to the county's air. Nitrogen oxides are a main 
component of smog. 
</P>
<P>
Edison said its emissions of pollutants would drop drastically to 67 tons per 
year in 1996 and drop again to 21 tons per year in 2007. 
</P>
<P>
After 1995, under an agreement with Ventura County, Edison would compensate for 
its increased emissions by footing the bill for other companies to convert 
their gas or diesel engines to pollution-free electric motors. 
</P>
<P>
That deal, drafted by the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District and 
approved by county supervisors, represents "what we felt was the best 
mitigation package we could get," said William Mount, manager of the district's 
planning section. 
</P>
<P>
County officials say any increase in emissions in Ventura County is significant 
because the county is now under federal court order to clean up the air to meet 
health standards. By court order, the EPA is in the process of preparing a plan 
to help the county reach those standards. 
</P>
<P>
The county must reduce emissions by 40% to meet the federal standards, 
computerized modeling tests ordered by the EPA revealed late last year. 
</P>
<P>
EPA states in its June 18 document that the increased emissions from the merger 
could interfere with efforts to attain the standards. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA also said it disagrees with Edison's claim that the merger will bring a 
net improvement in air quality. That claim is based on combined emission 
figures for all of Southern California, from San Diego to Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
But the air quality basins affected by the merger are "closed systems" and 
"geographically distinct," the EPA states. 
</P>
<P>
But Russell said the agency and the draft environmental impact report had 
already addressed the impacts on a region-by-region basis.

INDIAN ENVIRONMENTAL BILL CLEARS HURDLE; 
</P>
<P>
LANDFILLS: EMOTIONAL PLEAS INVOLVING CAMPO CASE PERSUADE SENATE PANEL TO 
REQUIRE TRIBES TO OBEY STATE LAW WHEN BUILDING GARBAGE DUMPS. LEGISLATION NOW 
GOES TO THE FULL SENATE.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Swayed by emotional pleas from San Diego County residents and hints of lead 
poisoning in Riverside County, an initially skeptical Senate committee approved 
a bill Thursday that would force California Indian tribes to comply with state 
environmental rules when building garbage dumps on their sovereign lands. 
</P>
<P>
The committee hearing before the Senate Toxics and Public Safety Management 
Committee provided the toughest test yet for the measure, sponsored by 
Assemblyman Steve Peace (D-Rancho San Diego) and inspired by the controversy 
surrounding plans by the impoverished Campo Tribe of Mission Indians to put a 
solid-waste landfill on a small portion of its southeast San Diego County 
reservation. 
</P>
<P>
Initial questions by committee chairman Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) seemed 
to indicate that the measure faced overwhelming odds because of a legal opinion 
by the Legislature's own attorney that the proposal would run afoul of federal 
law, which has long held that American Indians are sovereign and need comply 
only with federal regulations. As a result, Indian reservations are exempt from 
local zoning requirements and state income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
But the momentum of the lengthy hearing shifted when Peace offered a parade of 
sometimes emotional witnesses to buttress his arguments that the Campo case is 
part of a nationwide strategy by large solid-waste companies to use Indian 
sovereignty as a way around strict state and local standards for 
hazardous-waste sites and garbage dumps. 
</P>
<P>
He asserted that the state has a legitimate interest to make sure dumps on 
Indian lands don't endanger other Californians living nearby and added that 
offering tribes less than equal environmental protection than their non-Indian 
neighbors would be treating American Indians as "second-class citizens." 
</P>
<P>
To demonstrate the danger, Riverside County Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Nixon 
testified that he is conducting a criminal investigation into allegations that 
an unregulated hazardous-waste dump on an Indian reservation is leaching lead 
into the soil and water. The federal Bureau of Indian Affairs promised to 
perform an environmental study of the dump, but never got around to it, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have looked at an area on an Indian reservation that is highly 
environmentally sensitive," Nixon said, declining to name the tribe. "It is 
adjacent to a flood channel, it is in an overflow area. It is upgradient to 
several dairy farmers and upwind to several produce farms. 
</P>
<P>
"The urgency involved right now is that the lead, which is highly hazardous 
waste, will percolate through the land into the ground water, and the ground 
water will flow through the dairies and feed off into well water," Nixon said. 
" . . . The effects of this can be devastating." 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Boulevard, in southeast San Diego County, echoed those concerns, 
arguing that the dump now proposed by the Campo Indians would be next to their 
ground-water supply. Although the tribe has promised to take no hazardous 
materials into the dump, household toxins and cleaners are routinely thrown 
away and pose a threat to health, the residents said. 
</P>
<P>
The most poignant moments came when 70-year-old Catherine Saubel, a Cahuilla 
Indian from the San Diego-area Los Coyotes reservation, said the bill is 
necessary to "stop the exploitation" of her tribe, which is also entertaining 
the idea of leasing its land for a dump. 
</P>
<P>
"They are told by their so-called leaders to accept controversial enterprises 
such as landfills by waving dollar bills in front of their eyes," said Saubel, 
her testimony creating a hush in the hearing room. "When it is too late, the 
Indians will realize what they gave up: the land they valued so much before -- 
the clean water, the unpolluted water, even facing the possibility of 
themselves and their children becoming sick from the fumes of the landfill." 
</P>
<P>
The often acerbic Torres seemed particularly touched by Saubel's comments. 
Saubel told him that her people had occupied the land "since time immemorial." 
After she was identified as an Indian historian and writer, he requested a copy 
of her volume on Indian use of plants for medicinal purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the Peace bill, including representatives of the Campo tribe, 
tried using logic and legal precedent to kill the bill. 
</P>
<P>
They argued that the San Diego County Indians are working hard to make sure 
they meet or exceed state environmental standards for the proposed 600-acre 
dump. They are negotiating contracts to hire county health and air-pollution 
authorities to perform spot inspections and review reports from the landfill, 
which will be operated by a private company. 
</P>
<P>
But they warned that they will be forced to sue if the Legislature passes the 
bill. The legal challenge -- which Peace expects -- would go to the U.S. 
Supreme Court and result in a ruling for the state's 117 Indian tribes living 
on reservations and smaller rancherias, they contended. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the legal arguments, the senators voted 5 to 1 to pass the bill, which 
now goes to the full Senate for consideration. After the hearing, Peace was 
exultant about the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I never had a committee hearing like this in the eight years I've been here," 
he said. "Real people came up here and turned this committee around." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Gover, attorney for the Campo Indians, said afterward that he expected 
the committee to vote for the bill all along. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear that the prospect of losing a lawsuit doesn't deter anyone here," 
said Gover, himself a Pawnee Indian from Albuquerque, N.M. "This is tough 
politics for anyone to vote against more regulation of hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the ultimate political forum, and it is going to be tough for us to 
win here," he said. "But, in a legal forum, with judges that are honor-bound 
and legally bound to apply the law, we're going to win. They're just costing us 
money, and, in the long run, it's going to cost the state a lot of money."

BAD WELDS REPORTEDLY CAUSED CANOPY CRASH; 
</P>
<P>
SAFETY: A REPORT BY THE SAN DIEGO BUILDING INSPECTION DEPARTMENT FIXES BLAME 
FOR THE JUNE 15 COLLAPSE AT ROBINSON'S IN UNIVERSITY TOWNE CENTRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Bad welds appear to be the cause of the June 15 collapse of a canopy at 
Robinson's department store in University Towne Centre, which injured one girl 
and nearly buried several other people. 
</P>
<P>
"The canopy failed because it was not constructed according to plans. Welding 
of the metal studs to the steel beam was not done to the specifications on the 
plans," according to a press release from the San Diego Building Inspection 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
The release also stated that "wind and weather" contributed to the failure of 
the deficient welds. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Lopez, chief of structural inspection for the department, said the welds 
were not strong enough to support stucco and other materials in the canopy. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the collapse, the city ordered the upscale department store chain 
to have the canopy and the rest of the building inspected by an engineering 
firm. The store hired Englekirk &amp; Hart Consulting Engineers, and their 
findings are the source for the building inspection department's report, Lopez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson's Spokeswoman Kelly Barfield in Los Angeles said the Hahn Co. of La 
Jolla was the contractor responsible for the store's construction. 
</P>
<P>
The Hahn Co. was owned by Ernest Hahn at the time of the store's construction, 
Barfield said. The company has since changed hands. 
</P>
<P>
Barfield had no other comment on the collapse, and there was no answer at the 
telephone number of the Hahn Co. after the city's report was released late 
Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez said that, during construction of public buildings, the city requires 
constant supervision by a "special inspector" during all welding to ensure 
structural integrity. The city, however, does not keep the reports filed by the 
inspectors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The principle responsibility of the inspection department is to ensure the 
safety of public structures, and no action will be taken against Robinson's or 
the builders of the canopy, Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
The engineering firm also determined that two other canopies, which were 
constructed differently from the one that collapsed, are not a hazard, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez said he does not know why all three canopies were not constructed the 
same way. That decision was "the architect's prerogative," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The welds on the other two canopies were "found to be completed per the plans," 
according to the Building Inspection Department's release.

PEST-CONTROL RELEASE EXCLUDES COUNTY

<P>
The state Department of Food and Agriculture has begun releasing a breed of 
stingless wasps in Southern California to combat the devastating ash whitefly, 
officials announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County, however, has been excluded from the first wave of releases 
because of short supplies, said Peter Stoddard, a research scientist with the 
agriculture department's pest management branch. 
</P>
<P>
The wasps are harmless to humans but act as a biological control against the 
ash whitefly. 
</P>
<P>
The wasps are being bred in a UC Riverside greenhouse, but reproduction has 
been relatively slow, Stoddard said. Twelve counties from San Diego to Fresno 
are expected to see releases of small colonies of wasps before the summer is 
through. 
</P>
<P>
The ash whitefly was first detected two years ago by suburban homeowners in the 
eastern part of Ventura County where large shade trees have been attacked by 
the pesky insect. 
</P>
<P>
The tiny whitefly attacks a tree by sucking its sap. It produces a sticky fluid 
that coats cars, sidewalks and patio furniture. Left unchecked, the fly 
eventually kills all the leaves on the infested tree. 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture officials say they are trying to stop the spread of the whitefly 
before it threatens commercial crops. PSYCHE PASCUAL

SHELTER FOR BATTERED WOMEN WINS REPRIEVE 
</P>

<P>
The only center for battered women in Santa Clarita, on the verge of shutting 
its doors a few months ago due to financial difficulties, was awarded a $30,000 
grant Thursday, enough to keep the program operating for about a year, a 
shelter spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Announcement of the grant by the United Way was the first encouraging news in 
many months for the Assn. to Aid Victims of Domestic Violence, which has 
provided counseling and shelter for battered women for eight years in the Santa 
Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The association had high hopes of receiving a $250,000 state grant this spring, 
but those hopes were dashed in April when Federal Express failed to deliver the 
application to Sacramento overnight, missing the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Express officials apologized for the computer-caused delay -- it took 
two days to deliver the package from Van Nuys to Sacramento -- and in a letter 
urged state officials not to reject the association's application. 
</P>
<P>
"Please be assured this is not an example of the quality service we want to 
provide our customers, nor is it acceptable," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
But officials with the Office of Criminal Justice Planning said they could not 
accept the application. There was no guarantee that the association would have 
received the grant, but center officials said their proposal met all 13 
criteria for receiving it. 
</P>
<P>
Financial setbacks forced the association to scale back its programs in 
January. The shelter now has only two part-time counselors who see clients one 
or two days a week, said Robin Shine Ackerman, a member of the association's 
board of directors. In the past, counselors were available five days a week, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers have handled administrative duties at the center for five months. 
The grant will allow the center to hire an executive director to oversee 
operations and continue fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
The center is supported by fees, a variety of grants and income from a thrift 
shop run by the association. It serves women who have been beaten or verbally 
abused by their husbands or boyfriends. 
</P>
<P>
The association asked Federal Express to reimburse the center for the lost 
grant. "We are still pursuing the matter with Federal Express, but I can't say 
any more than that at the moment," Ackerman said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the association continues to seek funds. The latest grant 
application must be submitted by 5 p.m. today in Los Angeles, Ackerman said. 
"We're going to hand-carry it," she said.

FOURTH OF JULY LOST SOME OF ITS BANG: GUNS; 
</P>
<P>
CELEBRATIONS: AMMUNITION SALES WERE BANNED IN LOS ANGELES DURING THE WEEK 
BEFORE THE HOLIDAY TO STEM THE SOMETIMES DEADLY TRADITION OF FIRING GUNS INTO 
THE AIR.

<P>
For some city residents this July 4th was unlike any other in recent years. 
There were the usual barbecues, fireworks shows and traffic jams. But the sound 
of gunfire, which normally fills the holiday night in many neighborhoods, was 
noticeably absent. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard no gunshots," said 85-year old B.A. Smith, a resident of Shelter Isle 
Mobile Home Park in Pacoima. "I've lived in here for 21 years. Without 
reservation there was less noise and less confusion than I've ever witnessed." 
</P>
<P>
In May the Los Angeles City Council banned ammunition sales during the week 
before the Fourth of July in an attempt to end the sometimes deadly tradition 
of firing guns into the air on the night of July 4th and New Year's Eve. The 
city of San Fernando also bans ammunition sales before the Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
On New Year's Eve, eight people were wounded by falling bullets and 70 were 
arrested for discharging firearms in Los Angeles. Police confiscated 134 guns. 
</P>
<P>
Although statistics were unavailable from police Thursday, some officers and 
residents said the city's pre-holiday ban on ammunition sales may have been the 
reason for what they describe as a decrease in the amount of random gunfire 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something that had to be done. It was just getting worse," said Sgt. Tom 
Toutant of the Los Angeles Police Department's North Hollywood Division. "I 
think it's a great idea." 
</P>
<P>
Toutant, an assistant watch commander, said there was considerably less gunfire 
in his division Wednesday compared to previous years. 
</P>
<P>
At least one North Hollywood man was arrested on suspicion of shooting a 
firearm in a residential area, but that person used home-made ammunition, 
Toutant said. 
</P>
<P>
Similar comments came from police in other areas of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to work," said Lt. Tony Pennington of the San Fernando Police 
Department. "We only had one call and that wasn't confirmed. . . . That's 
definitely a decrease. In the past years we've had six to a dozen calls." 
</P>
<P>
The ban won high marks from residents of Shelter Isle Mobile Home Park where in 
past years residents spent the days after the holidays plucking bullets from 
walls and furniture. 
</P>
<P>
No bullet impacts were reported Wednesday night, said Muriel Lazo, manager of 
the 260-unit mobile home park. 
</P>
<P>
"We use to have them shooting from the hillside behind us. We had bullets going 
through people's homes a lot. It's certainly a big improvement for us." 
</P>
<P>
In the Foothill Police Division, Capt. Valentino Paniccia said officers have 
"seen a tremendous decrease over the last three years," in the wake of an 
intensive campaign known as "Deadly Celebration" to discourage holiday 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in June, officers distributed flyers and spoke to neighborhood groups 
and other organizations warning of the dangers of fireworks and firearms. 
</P>
<P>
Paniccia said there were no arrests or incidents Wednesday, but it was still 
too early to determine the specific impact of the ammunition ban. 
</P>
<P>
"It's only been in place for one holiday," he said, but added: "The ammunition 
ban I'm sure is going to help as far as continuing that decrease." 
</P>
<P>
In some areas, the impact of the ban was unclear. 
</P>
<P>
Sergeants in the Devonshire, Van Nuys and West Valley divisions said they had 
insufficient information to determine immediately whether there had been a 
decrease in the numbers of shots fired.

PAIR STRIKE OUT IN ATTEMPT TO PROTEST BALLPARK EJECTION 
</P>

<P>
A pair of businessmen ejected from San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium during a 
baseball game June 10 complained about stadium security to the Stadium 
Authority Board on Thursday morning, to little avail. 
</P>
<P>
Stadium Manager Bill Wilson and members of the nine-person board refused to 
take a position, saying it was the responsibility of the host team -- in this 
case, the San Diego Padres -- to hire security, so the men should consult the 
Padres. 
</P>
<P>
But Padres officials at the meeting offered terse "no comments," refusing to 
discuss the case with the media or members of the board. 
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, real estate developer Michael Alessio and businessman Phil Palisoul 
said they were taken from the stands during a Sunday afternoon Padres game and 
placed in a holding cell earmarked for drunks after they allegedly insulted two 
members of the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Palisoul said the incident came about after he and Alessio, who attended the 
game with their Little League sons, "engaged in what I would call harmless 
chiding or heckling of the (Dodgers') players. But it was not obscene or 
anything. You know, it was just stuff you would do to the opposing team. 
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing you could even remotely construe as a racial slur (which 
Dodgers outfielder Hubie Brooks had alleged). That was the furthest thing from 
anything that was said." 
</P>
<P>
Palisoul said that, after Brooks popped up in the eighth inning of the 2-1 
Padres victory, he said, " 'Nice hit, Hubie,' and then he said something to me. 
Well, then, (Dodgers manager Tom) Lasorda jumped out and started screaming at 
me, and it was very profane stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Palisoul said that Lasorda and Brooks then summoned a security guard and asked 
that the two be removed. He said they were held in the holding cell for "about 
15 minutes" and were made to wait outside until the end of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like an open, public apology from the Padres," Alessio said, "saying 
that it was wrong and that it would never happen again. So far, I haven't 
gotten it." 
</P>
<P>
Alessio said he is considering legal action.

DOCTOR URGES LIMITS ON NONTOXIC DUMP ODORS; 
</P>
<P>
LOPEZ CANYON: THE COUNTY OFFICIAL CONTENDS THAT THE AIR QUALITY DISTRICT SHOULD 
REQUIRE LOS ANGELES TO REDUCE EMISSIONS FROM THE LANDFILL BECAUSE PEOPLE CAN 
BECOME TEMPORARILY ILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Even if they aren't toxic, odors that make people temporarily ill are 
sufficient reason for regional air quality officials to require the city of Los 
Angeles to reduce gas emissions from Lopez Canyon Landfill, a top county health 
official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"Our view is that it is no good for people to have nausea, headaches and other 
health problems that are caused by odor nuisances," said Dr. Paul J. Papanek 
Jr., chief of the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services' toxics 
epidemiology and disease control programs. 
</P>
<P>
He spoke before the five-member South Coast Air Quality Management District 
hearing board conducting an inquiry into alleged violations of state air 
pollution laws at the landfill near Lake View Terrace and Kagel Canyon in the 
northeastern San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
In August, the same board ordered the city to bring gas emissions down to state 
limits by December. However, state and local officials said that as recently as 
April, emissions were measured at 10,000 parts per million of air, far above 
the 500 p.p.m. allowed by the state. 
</P>
<P>
City Bureau of Sanitation officials have not disputed that, but said it was 
expected that they would need time to get a new gas collection system installed 
and working. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Christopher Westoff, representing the sanitation bureau, told 
the board that installation of the system, which cost the city $4 billion, is 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
He said landfill operators expect to be in full compliance with state law as 
soon as the system stabilizes, and when that occurs, residents will no longer 
smell the odors. 
</P>
<P>
Papanek, who was asked to testify Thursday as an impartial witness, said his 
department routinely contacts the air quality district when residents complain 
to his office about odors. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't find that people make these things up," he said. "When they complain, 
the odors are usually there." 
</P>
<P>
A state study shows that up to 40% of the people who live near landfills 
commonly have complaints such as nausea, headaches, respiratory ailments and 
even fainting spells, Papanek said. Odors are "very clearly associated" with 
such illnesses, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Air quality officials should make sure that such incidents are "infrequent and 
slight," Papanek said. 
</P>
<P>
If such odors occur "even twice a week and can be documented, that is too 
often," he said. "If odors cause lives to be disrupted, that is too much." 
</P>
<P>
Papanek discounted any theory that odor complaints from Lake View Terrace and 
Kagel Canyon residents are the result of mass hysteria, which he said is seldom 
geographically based. 
</P>
<P>
"Odor complaints occur more often when people are upset," Papanek said. "But I 
don't think it's mass hysteria." 
</P>
<P>
Papanek said his office looked into two reported incidents in which people 
became ill as a result of breathing gases emitted by the landfill -- one Oct. 
12 in which three children became sick while playing in their yards, the other 
in March, 1989, when a city worker was overcome by fumes and collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
He said he agreed with Dr. Marjorie Laughlin, the doctor who treated the 
children, that they were sickened by "an odor episode." 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear that something pretty smelly caused those children to vomit," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It also is reasonably likely that the worker became ill from landfill fumes, 
Papanek said. "A terrible odor can cause someone to faint. To me, it seems 
reasonable that the landfill did this." 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by Westoff, Papanek said he had no evidence that the dump 
emits toxic gases in quantities sufficient to cause cancer. But he said it 
would be "prudent to do testing for carcinogens" in the surrounding community. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to watch odor nuisances like a hawk" because of their potential risk, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Quality Management District has cited the landfill at least nine times 
in recent months for emitting gas "in such quantity as to cause a public 
nuisance off site," said district Inspector Terry Wilkinson. So far, the city 
has not been fined for the violations, which carry penalties of up to $25,000 a 
day, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing will continue Wednesday and is expected to last through the month. 
Landfill opponents said Thursday that they will ask the Los Angeles Planning 
Commission to postpone a July 16 hearing on a permit that would allow the 
landfill to expand.

A Thousand Oaks man who thought he spotted a green ball on his lawn Thursday 
morning instead discovered it was a military hand grenade and carried it into 
his house until police arrived, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies did not find any note indicating why the grenade was left at the 
residence of Karl Braun, 37, said Lt. Bill Montigo of The Ventura County 
Sheriff's Department. He said the grenade appeared to be live and had military 
markings. 
</P>
<P>
The department's bomb specialist "removed it gingerly," placing the grenade in 
a safety-lined barrel inside a bomb trailer, Montigo said. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ

A Port Hueneme man who was found dead in his seaside condominium died of 
strangulation, but authorities could not locate the businessman's family to 
notify them of his death, the Ventura County coroner's office said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Eugene Pope, 62, was a self-employed, free-lance business consultant, 
whose severely beaten body was found Wednesday in a condominium in the 900 
block of Lighthouse Way, Investigator Jim Wingate said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've exhausted our resources finding relatives," Wingate said, explaining why 
Pope's name was released before his relatives were notified. 
</P>
<P>
Port Hueneme police will not release the method of strangulation and are not 
certain what objects were used in the beating, Wingate said. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second homicide in Port Hueneme since 1988, said a spokeswoman for 
Port Hueneme Police Chief Bob Anderson. It is at least the ninth slaying in 
Ventura County since January. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ

A 28-year-old Simi Valley man spent Wednesday night in jail after recklessly 
firing an AK-47 assault rifle in his neighborhood, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Forrester was released Thursday on $5,000 bail from the Ventura County 
Jail's East Valley Subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
He was held on suspicion of discharging a firearm in a grossly negligent 
manner, a felony, said Lt. Bob Klamser of the Simi Valley Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Police recovered 90 shell casings in the street and sidewalk areas of the 1200 
block of Fitzgerald Road about 11:30 p.m. Wednesday. The rifle and 100 unfired 
shells were also recovered, Klamser said. 
</P>
<P>
The state Legislature has banned the sale of assault rifles, including AK-47s. 
Under the law, owners who purchased such guns before Jan. 1 must register the 
guns with the state by the end of the year to continue to possess them legally.

CURBSIDE RECYCLING PROGRAM TO EXPAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLYN KUSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Ventura's curbside recycling program, which involves about 5,000 
residences, will expand Monday to include the remaining 15,000 households that 
get their trashed picked up. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-five-gallon barrels for recyclables are being distributed to residents 
as part of the voluntary program, which is funded entirely through fees 
collected by E.J. Harrison and Sons Inc., the local rubbish hauling company, 
said recycling coordinator Eric Werbalowsky. 
</P>
<P>
Residential pickup fees increased July 1 about $2 a month to $25.14. About 
$1.60 of the increase will be used to pay for the recycling program. The 
remaining 40 cents will be applied toward the increased cost of dumping waste 
at the Bailard landfill, said Edward Garman, the city's revenue manager. 
</P>
<P>
The light-blue barrels will hold flattened cardboard boxes, plastic containers 
such as the kind used for milk, water and soda, glass containers, metal cans 
and newspaper. Mirrors, Pyrex, panes of glass, compost and high-grade paper 
will not be accepted in the pickup, Werbalowsky said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 75% of the homes of the 5,000 residences that now receive curbside 
recycling service participate in the program, Werbalowsky said. As a result, 
the amount of trash brought to the landfill has dropped by about 14% since the 
program began in October, according to Werbalowsky. 
</P>
<P>
By 1995, the city hopes that at least 25% of its trash, or 87.5 tons a day, 
will be diverted from landfills. 
</P>
<P>
To reach that goal, the city wants to include commercial businesses in the 
recycling effort. A pilot program to recycle trash generated by residents who 
live in apartments, condominiums and mobile home parks is also being developed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to get these programs set up as soon as we can. It all depends on 
how much cooperation we get from the community," Werbalowsky said. Meanwhile, 
the city is focusing its effort on residential customers. CAROLYN KUSKY

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: PRIX FIXE AT THIS S.D. BISTRO MEANS A DELUXE MEAL 
AT AFFORDABLE PRICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just about anyone with a pulse can recall the conspicuous consumption of the 
1980s, which, in the case of restaurants, led to what could only be called a 
glorious explosion of possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
This zest for spending also led to a remarkable explosion of prices, but now 
that the 1990s have struck, it seems that the junk bond dealers have played 
their last trump and that a degree of reality has settled in. 
</P>
<P>
The news in recent months from New York, where upwards of 30,000 Wall Street 
workers have lost their jobs, is that restaurant prices have been slashed in 
response to the slump in expense-account spending. The three-martini lunch 
isn't dead, just cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
Such East Coast happenings always hit the West Coast a little late, but they do 
show up sooner or later, and we may be about to get a break in the cost of a 
good dinner out. One sign may be the return of the prix fixe (fixed priced) 
dinner, which is tentatively rearing its more affordable head at a few spots 
around town. The lovely thing about un diner prix fixe is that it offers two or 
three courses at a price generally below that of an entree ordered a la carte. 
</P>
<P>
Mid-town San Diego's The French Side of the West offers nothing but prix fixe 
and has been a mad success since it opened two years ago. Another 2-year-old 
that just now has begun to experiment with the concept is Paul Dobson's 
handsome St. James Bar in the Golden Triangle. 
</P>
<P>
The menu offers starters priced from $4.50 to $9.50 (except the caviar 
listings, which understandably cost much more) and entrees from $17 to $27. The 
new nightly choice of two prix fixe dinners include soup or salad and entree at 
$16.50, and since the kitchen prepares these with the same high-quality 
ingredients and garnishes them just as lavishly, a luxury dinner has become 
relatively more affordable. 
</P>
<P>
The choices recently have included such things as a Provencal saute of calamari 
(the sauce here interpreted as a little tomato and a lot of garlic) and a 
simply remarkable duck confit laid over a sauce too modestly described as a 
"horseradish cream." The duck, slowly simmered in its own fat (of which it has 
a great deal) and juices, and then left to steep and gain virtue for a few 
days, had a burnished exterior and wonderfully rich, juicy flesh. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen sliced the breast and arranged the pieces in a crescent below the 
leg-thigh portion; the whole was underlain by a stiff, beurre blanc sort of 
sauce seasoned with just enough horseradish to make it sharp. The sharpness, of 
course, worked to cut the unctuous richness of the bird. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant also soon will introduce an expanded menu with the entree list 
divided into "bistro" and "Dobson's favorites" sections. The bistro portion 
will include entrees into the $14-to-$17 range, such as duck, frog legs and 
seafoods; the higher-priced rack of lamb, venison, lobster and veal dishes more 
traditional at this restaurant will be listed in the second category. 
</P>
<P>
This restaurant has matured nicely since chef Christian Vignes succeeded his 
fellow Frenchman, Jacques Pastor, at the range. Vignes has retained the high 
tone of the menu while expanding it considerably, and the daily-changed list 
now typically offers nearly 20 entrees. 
</P>
<P>
Vignes has to some degree reintroduced classic haute cuisine, which he tempers 
with more contemporary offerings. Among the classics would be sauteed beef 
tournedos with a forestiere (mushroom) sauce made of costly morels; a roasted 
breast of free-range chicken with garlic and thyme sauce; grilled veal chop 
with grain mustard sauce, and Alaska halibut in the charmingly old-fashioned 
Veronique treatment, which calls for a white wine sauce finished with grapes. 
</P>
<P>
In a slightly more modern vein, Vignes recently offered sauteed frog legs with 
a chive-garlic sauce of pungent potency; there are those who might feel a 
little squeamish about this particular meat, but it really is quite delicate, 
and this particular treatment does it full justice. Another offering that 
updated a classic approach was a roasted tenderloin of pork, sliced and 
garnished with a sweet-sharp sauce of griottes, or bitter cherries. The same 
sauce would be happy with duck, which is why it worked so well with a rich meat 
like pork. 
</P>
<P>
More modern entrees would be sauteed duck breast in a citron sauce tricked out 
with candied lemon zest and the poached Maine lobster on a bed of sauteed 
spinach. The spinach, chopped almost to a paste and butter-fried to an 
unexpected crispness, was arranged in a precise triangle under the shelled 
beast, which in turn was coated with mildly anise-flavored Pernod sauce. In 
this context, the spinach had an herbal effect that, in tandem with the herbal 
liqueur in the sauce, gave a new, slightly wild (or gamy) taste to the lobster. 
</P>
<P>
This full-on French menu also offers long lists of starters, commencing with 
caviars, snails and smoked salmon and growing more interesting with Quilcine 
oysters on the half-shell, the newly available, genuine prosciutto ham imported 
from Parma, Italy (it is, unexpectedly but deliciously, quite sweet) and a 
large selection of soups. This category always includes a cream soup or two and 
the house signature dish, mussel bisque baked under puff pastry. Another 
regular is vichyssoise, the curse of the banquet circuit but here so velvety in 
texture and rich in flavor as to explain why bowdlerized versions have become 
ubiquitous. 
</P>
<P>
The salads also are quite interesting, and run to such things as baked goat 
cheese layered atop designer greens and grilled sea scallops with costly mache 
lettuce. A really fine offering is the salad of sauteed sweetbreads, each 
nugget crowned with a truffle shaving, arranged over baby greens and doused 
with a citrus-flavored dressing; this might be a good starting point for anyone 
who has wanted to try sweetbreads but has been unwilling to commit to a full 
entree order. The salads mentioned here are in the $7.50-$8.50 range and may 
not be ordered with the fixed-price dinner; the house salad served as prelude 
to that meal is nonetheless a good, well-garnished tumble of greens and 
vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
St. James Bar offers a tray devoted to house-prepared sweets that includes 
fruit tarts, a creamy cheesecake or two, the richly chocolate and coyly 
triangular "Golden Triangle" and an even more chocolaty terrine of the 
bittersweet stuff, doused in a minted custard sauce and irresistible to the 
last spoonful.

WEEKENDER: THE SOUTH BAY'S LATEST FARMERS' MARKET: A FRUITFUL IDEA KEEPS 
GROWING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ian Rose 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although Pat Holter's son works in a local supermarket, the Redondo Beach 
resident shops at a farmers' market in Torrance for her household's produce. 
"Ever see the string beans in (the supermarket)? They're not worth taking 
home," Holter said while sampling raspberries at an open-air booth. 
</P>
<P>
Being able to bite before you buy is just advantage to shopping for produce at 
a farmers' market, an increasingly popular choice in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The area's fifth market is scheduled to open in Hermosa Beach this afternoon 
with a watermelon-cutting ceremony and a country music concert. "Instead of 
cutting a ribbon, we substituted fruit," said Mary Lou Weiss, manager of the 
market, which will be held Fridays between 12:30 and 3:30 p.m. at 13th Street 
and Hermosa Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
At the local state-certified farmers' markets, growers from as far as Stockton 
and as close as Carson sell goods directly to consumers. Prices are generally 
lower and the produce fresher, said Holter after buying a basket of raspberries 
at Torrance's weekly market, held 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. Tuesdays at Charles Wilson 
Park on Crenshaw Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Produce sold in the supermarket is usually picked before it is fully ripe, 
allowing sellers time to pack and ship the product, said Richard Sager, who 
brings produce to Torrance from his farm in Arroyo Grande. However, if the 
produce is going to be sold the day after it is picked, as is the case in a 
farmers' market, the fruit can sit on the tree or vine longer and sweeten more 
than it would in a truck, Sager added. 
</P>
<P>
The state established a program in 1977 allowing farmers to sell produce 
directly to consumers. There are now 47 such markets in Southern California, 
according to the Southland Farmers' Market Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The South Bay markets are sprinkled throughout the week, and shoppers and 
farmers frequently attend more than one. 
</P>
<P>
Wes Bush, executive director of Hermosa Beach's Chamber of Commerce, said he 
hoped the new market will not compete with others but will "bring more people 
into the farmers' market habit." 
</P>
<P>
For shoppers who can't steal away during the workweek, Gardena's market is open 
on Saturdays from 6:30 a.m. to noon at the Hollypark Methodist Church on Van 
Ness Avenue. Mike Cluster, manager of the Gardena market, said it was the first 
state-certified farmers' market in the Southland, founded in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Cluster said farmers' markets free the growers from being "slaves to the 
wholesaler." Buyers for markets demand fruit and vegetables with uniform size, 
shape, color and shine, which often requires the use of chemicals and waxing, 
Cluster added. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the chance to sell direct, farmers sell their products for up to 
twice what they could get from the shipper, which they said makes the long 
hauls to the South Bay worth the trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Part of that savings is passed on to the consumer. Prices in the market usually 
run 20% to 30% below supermarket prices, according to the Southland Farmers' 
Market Assn. However, shoppers said price differences vary greatly from one 
product to another. 
</P>
<P>
Selling directly to the customer is more satisfying than selling to the 
wholesaler, farmers said. 
</P>
<P>
"The brokers are just looking for negative things to say about your fruit, to 
slash your price," said Alex Weiss, who sells his produce at several of the 
area markets. "Here my customers come back and tell me how good last week's 
food was." 
</P>
<P>
The popular items now are melons and apples, which are just starting to appear 
at the markets, and sweet corn, always a summer favorite, growers said. For 
those wishing to stray from the beaten culinary path, the markets offer 
off-beat vegetables such as Armenian cucumbers and a cornucopia of nuts and 
dried fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Host cities have supported the markets because they bring potential shoppers 
into the communities' commercial areas, farmers said. Weiss said the market in 
Hermosa Beach was partly inspired by one held in neighboring Redondo Beach, on 
Thursdays from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in Veterans Park on Torrance Boulevard. "We 
hope it will also generate business in the downtown district," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Another city that encouraged establishing a farmers' market was San Pedro, 
where a market is held Thursdays from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on 3rd Street between 
Centre and Mesa streets. Ian Rose

FAST-MOVING BRUSH FIRE CHARS 119 ACRES BUT LEAVES HOUSES UNTOUCHED; 
</P>
<P>
THOUSAND OAKS: NO INJURIES ARE REPORTED IN A BLAZE THAT BURNED FOR FOUR HOURS 
AND COULD BE SEEN FOR MILES. THE CAUSE HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED.

<P>
A fast-moving brush fire swept across a steep hillside in Thousand Oaks on 
Thursday, threatening neighborhoods of new and old houses and causing a small 
power outage before firefighters were able to bring it under control. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, which sent plumes of black smoke hundreds of feet into the air and 
could be seen from as far away as Chatsworth, charred 119 acres within a 
four-hour period, fire officials said. No injuries were reported and no 
structures were damaged in the blaze, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Arson investigators said the fire was of suspicious origin but had not 
determined its cause by late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The fire erupted about 2:15 p.m. in a brushy area in the 1500 block of Erbes 
Road, across the street from a residential neighborhood where many houses have 
wood-shake roofs. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials did not call for an evacuation, and many residents hosed down 
their roofs and the sides of their houses to fend off the intense heat from the 
blaze. A section of Erbes Road, between El Monte and La Granada drives, was 
closed to traffic for about three hours as firefighters fought to control the 
blaze. 
</P>
<P>
"We heard sirens and helicopters," said Sari Wade, who lives two blocks from 
where the fire is believed to have started. "My son went outside and he said, 
'Mom, I can see smoke.' I thought he was putting me on. We walked out on our 
front lawn, and we saw an immense amount of flames." 
</P>
<P>
Residents along nearby Sapra Street said they feared their houses would be lost 
when a wall of flames came within 100 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"I was mowing the lawn, and I looked across the hill and I saw this flame," 
said Shane McCarthy, 16. "Then it just spread." 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy said he ran into the house and alerted his family. He said he climbed 
onto the roof and began hosing it down. 
</P>
<P>
"We just panicked," said Betty Adolph, McCarthy's mother. "We've just seen all 
that destruction in the Santa Barbara fire, and we were afraid we'd lose our 
home." 
</P>
<P>
Westerly winds eventually pushed the blaze up a steep hillside toward the 
exclusive community of North Ranch. However, about 200 Ventura and Los Angeles 
county firefighters, assisted by a number of hand crews and three 
water-dropping helicopters, managed to keep the blaze away from the houses in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Tom Law of the Ventura County Fire Department said the city's strict 
weed-abatement ordinance was largely responsible for keeping the fire at a 
distance. The law requires that residents keep a clearance area of 100 feet 
around their houses and other structures. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely working today," Law said of the ordinance. "It's saved our 
bacon many times." 
</P>
<P>
Carol Larson, area manager for Southern California Edison, said about 50 
customers in the area were without power for several hours because a single 
utility pole had been damaged in the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
"We initially turned off power to approximately 2,000 homes for 60 seconds in 
order to isolate the equipment that was damaged," she said. There are a large 
number of power poles in the charred brush area, but the poles are treated with 
a special fire retardant, Larson said. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Beaumont, a Ventura County Fire Department spokeswoman, said fire 
officials were pleased that they were able to get a handle on the fire as 
quickly as they did. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was really nervous after the Santa Barbara fire," Beaumont said. 
"But everything went really smoothly." 
</P>
<P>
Brush fires in Santa Barbara and Glendale last week destroyed 637 houses, 
injured dozens of people and caused more than $200 million in damage. A brush 
fire also charred 585 acres and threatened high-priced houses on the northern 
edge of Ojai last week.

It was a bad day all the way around for accused bank robber Alexander Hatfield, 
27, of Scripps Ranch Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Bill Robinson said Hatfield was the suspect who Thursday 
morning robbed the HomeFed Bank branch in the 10000 block of Scripps Ranch 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
It was hardly a high-scoring heist. After demanding that a teller hand over 
money, the robber fled with $331. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the robber had trouble getting his car out of the bank parking lot, 
giving bank employees time to get his license number and relay it to police. 
</P>
<P>
A short time later, Hatfield found himself being pursued by police. The pursuit 
ended when he crashed his car into a tractor-trailer at Mercury Street and 
Engineer Road in Kearny Mesa, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested Hatfield and found $331 dollars in his pocket, according to 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Hatfield was in jail Thursday night, and the FBI said it would bring a 
bank-robbery charge against him and would check to see if he is a suspect in 
any other bank robberies.

The body of an unidentified woman was found at the archery range in Balboa 
Park's Palm Canyon Park about 9:15 a.m. Thursday, Homicide Lt. Jim Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of death was undetermined, Duncan said. "There were no stab wounds, 
no obvious signs of trauma." An autopsy will be performed. 
</P>
<P>
Duncan said the woman was wearing jeans, a T-shirt and a sweat shirt. Her age 
was estimated at 35 to 40. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like she was probably a transient," he said. Police will attempt to 
make a positive identification through fingerprints, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The woman's body was discovered by archers. She was covered with a blanket, and 
they first thought she was sleeping, Sgt. Jim Clear said.

CSUN OFFICIAL NOT SURPRISED BY MILKE'S EXIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leslie Milke might have surprised some people when she resigned as coach of the 
Cal State Northridge women's basketball team last Friday, but CSUN Associate 
Athletic Director Judy Brame was not caught off guard. 
</P>
<P>
"(Milke) has been thinking about it for the last three years," Brame said 
Thursday. "She enjoyed coaching, but she knew she did not want to spend the 
rest of her life doing it. 
</P>
<P>
"She really loves teaching and I think she wanted to concentrate more on that." 
</P>
<P>
Milke's resignation came a little more than four months before the start of the 
1990-91 season, Northridge's first at the NCAA Division I level. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she just wanted to make sure that this was what she really wanted to 
do," said Brame, who coached Milke when she played for Northridge from 1975-79. 
"I'm sure she didn't want to make a quick decision, then regret it. I think it 
was a good time and a good decision for her." 
</P>
<P>
Milke, who could not be reached for comment, compiled a 100-94 record during 
seven years as coach. She was a Northridge assistant from 1980-83. 
</P>
<P>
After posting a school-record 22-9 mark in 1988-89, Northridge was hit hard by 
injuries last season and finished 11-18. 
</P>
<P>
Milke, a part-time physical education and kinesiology teacher at Northridge, 
was honored as the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. Coach of the Year after 
the 1985-86 and '88-89 seasons, and was the District VIII Coach of the Year for 
'85-86. 
</P>
<P>
As a player, she was an All-CCAA selection as a senior in 1979, and ranks sixth 
on the all-time Northridge career scoring list with 910 points. 
</P>
<P>
A nationwide search for her successor will start shortly, according to Brame, 
who coached Northridge from 1974-79 and again from 1980-83. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge will accept applications until July 30, and hopes to make a hire 
before the fall semester starts on Sept. 3. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard for me to imagine (Milke) not having some association with the 
team," Brame said. "But I think she made the right decision."

WINNING A FIGHT FOR PEACE OF MIND; 
</P>
<P>
SCHRAM WARDS OFF AN AGGRESSIVE NATURE AND FINDS TRANQUILLITY AS MARTIAL ARTS 
EXPERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF RILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bruce Schram always seemed to get his kicks in the literal sense, and not 
necessarily for the right reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Too often, Schram booted his way into trouble as a youngster. But, 19 years 
later, the bully-turned-black belt has channeled his aggression toward a 
martial arts career that has been as impressive as it has been inspirational. 
</P>
<P>
Schram, 30, a dental assistant from Tarzana who won the 1989 U.S. Karate Assn. 
California Contact Karate heavyweight championship, possessed a temper shorter 
than a split-second front kick as an 11-year-old at Calabash Street Elementary 
School in Woodland Hills. He encountered more enemies than Bruce Lee. 
</P>
<P>
"I was one of those meet-you-by-the-bike-rack kids," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Schram didn't arrange these meetings because he wanted to showcase a new Huffy 
bicycle. He was huffy. 
</P>
<P>
"I just felt the aggression, and I couldn't control it," he said. "I always 
wanted to see how good the other guy was." 
</P>
<P>
Today, the El Camino Real High graduate attempts to limit his challenges within 
a dojo (the Japanese word for a training room). Last year, Schram finished 
second in the heavyweight division of the World Contact Karate Championships in 
Phoenix. In 1987, he competed for the five-man U.S. team in the Japan Cup in 
Tokyo and said he was the only American to win a match. 
</P>
<P>
Yet his aggression didn't always lead to such productive venues. It often 
directed him to a principal's office. 
</P>
<P>
"He was always getting into fights," his mother, Elaine Schram, said. 
</P>
<P>
Schram developed an interest in martial arts with the help of a Woodland Hills 
neighbor, Rich Guy, who possessed a black belt in judo. Although Schram 
instinctively pursued martial arts for violent reasons ("I was looking for 
another reason to kick somebody's butt"), his attitude quickly changed. 
</P>
<P>
Guy, who taught judo's basics to Schram in 1971, remembers his 11-year-old 
neighbor as ambitious and feisty. 
</P>
<P>
"He was eager to learn and very competitive," Guy said. "He had a good sense of 
coordination and a good mental attitude. Probably the best thing about him was 
that he wasn't out there for revenge, but for knowledge to learn and better 
himself mentally and physically." 
</P>
<P>
Schram studied about 12-15 hours a week and earned a judo black belt at age 15. 
Elaine Schram initially wasn't sure what to think of Bruce's devotion. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I thought it was just a fleeting-fancy type of thing," she said. 
"But he took it very seriously and it has really changed his life." 
</P>
<P>
Schram's patience lengthened along with his martial arts career, and today he 
seeks friends as vigorously as he once sought enemies. 
</P>
<P>
"Karate has given me a sense of peace and confidence that I carry over into the 
rest of my life," Schram said. "It gave me focus and motivation." 
</P>
<P>
And karate, which he took up in 1973, seemed to block Schram's path toward 
trouble. Although Schram has earned black belts in shorin-ryu karate-do, tae 
kwon do, and kenpo karate -- and also has studied shaolin kung-fu and judo -- 
he no longer loiters near bicycle racks. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a living contradiction," he says with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
That's because Schram, who is seeded No. 1 in the heavyweight division of the 
1990 USKA California Contact Karate Championships in November at Laguna Beach, 
now must be dragged into fights. 
</P>
<P>
Although Schram is dominating at 6-foot-1 and 190 pounds, he has replaced a 
fast fist with an even quicker smile. Nineteen years of studying martial arts 
has provided Schram with an enhanced attitude that he said has changed his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of sports you can be physically good at, but karate's 
spiritual aspects offer you peace of mind," Schram said. "It was something I 
was looking for. I used to challenge people, but I've mellowed over the years." 
</P>
<P>
Schram said his discovery of inner peace helped him through trying times, such 
as his 1983 divorce, and he doesn't care to speculate where he would be today 
if he had not developed an interest in martial arts. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an attitude with karate that instead of wanting to challenge someone 
to see what you can do, you feel you're afraid of what you can do to them," 
Schram said. "You know you can hurt them, and when you can understand what 
you're capable of, you take the ego out of it. Once the ego is out of it, 
there's really no reason to fight unless it's purely a self-defense situation." 
</P>
<P>
Schram hasn't entirely avoided confrontations. He recently was approached by 
two youths in Venice who demanded money. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I kind of laughed because I couldn't believe it was happening to 
me," he said. "But then I got angry and. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Schram teaches self-defense skills each Friday at the YWCA in Torrance. He 
practices and teaches for about two hours a day, four days a week. Although he 
says he is more passive because of martial arts, Schram remains intense during 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
"I make (competition) as close to an attitude on the street that I can," he 
said. "There are only two ways it's going to end: either my opponent is going 
down, or we both go down. With that attitude, I seldom lose." 
</P>
<P>
Simon Rhee, who runs Simon Rhee's Tae Kwon Do Centers in Woodland Hills and Van 
Nuys, has taught Schram for more than eight years. 
</P>
<P>
"Bruce has no fear and he loves challenges," Rhee said. "If something is 
difficult, he wants to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Schram emphasizes the less violent aspects of martial arts philosophy as a 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not important to look for a teacher who is going to teach you violence, 
but one who will teach you peace," Schram said. "The essence of karate is to 
refrain from violent behavior, and that's what I try to teach. We teach peace." 
</P>
<P>
Schram feels he has satisfied his goals as a competitor and would like to 
concentrate on teaching. He taught martial arts while stationed on the USS 
Kitty Hawk during a five-year stint in the Navy, and also worked as an 
instructor in Japan -- which is akin to a Japanese man teaching the Dodgers how 
to hit a forkball. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a little bit of animosity initially," Schram said. "Like anything 
else, you have to prove yourself. Once I did that, and they saw I was just a 
humble person who had something to teach, they accepted me." 
</P>
<P>
Schram receives much of his satisfaction through giving instruction, and he is 
attempting to start martial arts programs at elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
"People have given me so much knowledge, and I want to give some back," said 
Schram. 
</P>
<P>
He also is pursuing acting and writing careers. He played the role of a villain 
in a Japanese movie, "The Outsider," and says he is within a year of completing 
an autobiography that he hopes will become a movie script. 
</P>
<P>
"Karate is such a diversion," he said. "You can paint a picture and it's just 
there. You can sing a song, and it's in the song. Well, karate is something 
that stays with you, something that helps you put things in perspective." 
</P>
<P>
And also keeps him from life's bicycle racks.

WEEKENDER: YOUNGSTERS WILL RUN MINI-MARATHON

Standout marathon runners of the future might be on display at 9:30 a.m. Sunday 
at Pacific Square in Gardena when a local real estate company sponsors a 
half-kilometer fun run for children 4-12. 
</P>
<P>
World champion-caliber marathoners didn't start training by immediately running 
the 26 miles, 385 yards. The half-kilometer distance is realistic for young 
people wanting to get the feel of this type of road race. For those not yet 
familiar with the metric system, and who is except for math teachers, a 
half-kilometer is approximately a third of a mile. The children's race will be 
run on Denker Avenue south of Pacific Square. 
</P>
<P>
The stakes will be higher and the race longer for the older runners. A 
five-kilometer race with $2,000 in prize money divided among the first 10 male 
and first 10 female finishers will start at 8 a.m. Prize money includes $200 
bonuses to the first man to run the course in under 13:46 and an equal amount 
to the first woman to finish under 16:00. Awards will also go to the first five 
finishers in each age division on a course described by the sponsoring Ken 
Nakaoka Realty Co. as "the fastest road 5-K in L.A. and Orange counties." 
</P>
<P>
Cost of entrance for the kids' half-kilometer and the adult five kilometer is 
$10. Information: (213) 323-0163.

Dodgers "Egging Us On?" -- Two of the newest Dodgers and a veteran coach will 
conduct a clinic, sponsored by the California Egg Commission, for youngsters at 
Wilson Park in Torrance on Saturday from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Javier, acquired by the Dodgers from the World Series champion Oakland 
Athletics earlier this season, will be joined by left-handed relief pitcher Pat 
Perry and bullpen coach Mark Cresse, who will offer baseball advice and sign 
autographs. 
</P>
<P>
Javier, regarded as a premier defensive outfielder, has impressed the Dodgers 
with his hitting prowess. He is hitting .345 since getting a chance to become a 
regular in the lineup. He learned to play the game early in life, as he is the 
son of former St. Louis Cardinal Julian Javier, an infield standout in the 
1960s. The Dodgers probably won't allow Perry to throw too much at the clinic, 
since he is on the team's disabled list, still recovering from the effects of 
off-season rotator cuff surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Dirty Driving? -- If you get down, you might get dirty at Ascot Park in Gardena 
on Saturday night at 8. That's when Ascot plays host to the Valvoline Off-Road 
Mud Bog Nationals for four-wheel drive vehicles. Unlike the sprint-car races 
the park normally features, this one is made a bit shorter but tougher, as a 
200-foot trench full of mud is placed over part of the race course. Drivers 
race against the clock through the trench. 
</P>
<P>
If you've ever tried driving on Pacific Coast Highway heading toward Malibu 
after a heavy rainstorm, you might have an idea what awaits the event's 
drivers. Expect the cars to spin and swerve quite a bit more than they would at 
Indianapolis. Some might not make it out of the mud without towing assistance. 
If you sit in the grandstands for a close view, you could take part of the 
course home with you on your clothes and in your hair. Off-road race fans find 
this type of event exciting, so it's worth checking out.

ALOMARS AN ALL-STAR FAMILY; 
</P>
<P>
PADRES: ROBERTO ALOMAR, ALONG WITH TEAMMATE TONY GWYNN, IS NAMED AN NL RESERVE. 
BROTHER SANDY JR. HAD ALREADY BEEN SELECTED AS THE STARTING AL CATCHER FOR 
TUESDAY'S GAME.

<P>
The All-Star game is all about fantasies, dreams and memories, and as far as 
that goes, not many people are having it any better these days than the Alomar 
family. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres got word Thursday, just before their 4-1 loss to St. Louis, that 
second baseman Roberto Alomar and outfielder Tony Gwynn had been selected by 
Manager Roger Craig to the National League team for Tuesday's game at Chicago's 
Wrigley Field. Benito Santiago was voted as the NL's starting catcher by the 
fans, but a broken left arm will prevent him from playing. 
</P>
<P>
And that's too bad. Remember all of that talk during the past couple of years 
about Santiago and Sandy Alomar Jr.? The trade rumors, the who-should-stay and 
who-should-go talk and the rest. Well, Alomar Jr., now a rookie for the 
Cleveland Indians, will start behind the plate for the American League and join 
brother Roberto for an All-Star debut. 
</P>
<P>
So you can see, then, why Sandy Alomar Sr., Padre third base coach and one 
proud padre, is going through one of those once-in-a-lifetime stretches these 
days: 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, July 4: Daughter Sandia is in the middle of celebrating her 25th 
birthday at home in Puerto Rico when the results of fan voting are announced. 
Sandy Alomar Jr. is named as the AL's starting catcher. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, July 5: Roberto Alomar is picked as an NL reserve after finishing 
second in the fan balloting, to Chicago's Ryne Sandberg, with 529,390 votes. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, July 10: The Alomars will gather at Wrigley Field. Oh, and Maria 
Alomar -- Sandy Sr.'s wife and mother to Sandy Jr. and Roberto -- will 
celebrate her birthday. Sandy Sr. and Maria will be in the Wrigley Field 
stands; Roberto and Sandy Jr. will be in the dugouts. They are unsure if Sandia 
will be able to make the trip. 
</P>
<P>
What a week. 
</P>
<P>
"How can you put it?" Sandy Alomar Sr. said. "I can't put it any better than 
that." 
</P>
<P>
He was an All-Star, too, for the Angels in 1970. But Thursday, he was talking 
more about his sons. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been a very proud father," he said. "People have to realize I'm 
very proud of my kids for the way they act as persons. And they have talent and 
know how to display that talent." 
</P>
<P>
The Alomar brothers are the first All-Star brother combination since Jim and 
Gaylord Perry in 1970. So you can see why CBS, the network that will broadcast 
the game, has been rummaging around looking for profile material. On Monday, 
the network sent people to interview Roberto at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium 
and Sandy Sr. and Maria at their San Diego home. Roberto said people were even 
sent to Puerto Rico, where the Alomars grew up. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto was in the Padre video room when he got word of his All-Star selection. 
His father and Gwynn approached him at around noon Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't surprised," Roberto said. "But I wasn't sure I was going to make it. 
I'll be playing with the best players in both leagues, and that's something I'm 
never going to forget. 
</P>
<P>
"It came real soon in my career. I never thought I'd make it that quick." 
</P>
<P>
Roberto is 22, Sandy Jr. 24. 
</P>
<P>
"For Sandy, I'm especially proud," Sandy Sr. said. "He had a tough time coming 
into the big leagues. Last year, all he went through . . . the trade rumors, 
getting sent back to the minors after having had a good year. But it made him a 
better ballplayer." 
</P>
<P>
As for Gwynn, he will be making his sixth appearance in the game but will not 
start for just the second time after finishing fourth in the fan balloting with 
1,143,282 votes. The top three were Andre Dawson, Lenny Dykstra and Kevin 
Mitchell. Thursday, Gwynn was more worried about the current state of the 
Padres. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh yeah, it's an honor," he said. "It's always an honor. You don't feel real 
good about going, though, with the way we've played during the last couple of 
weeks." 
</P>
<P>
As for not starting, Gwynn said that suits him just fine. 
</P>
<P>
"To tell you the truth, it's more fun coming in off the bench," Gwynn said. 
"You can joke around and pick stuff up. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of nice to bounce ideas off of other players. See what they think. 
Last year, I picked up a couple of tips." 
</P>
<P>
Gwynn will also pick up an extra $25,000 because of the All-Star incentive 
clause in his contract. Roberto Alomar will receive an extra $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
He will also have a message for his brother, if the situation is right. If 
Sandy Jr. is catching when Roberto steps up to the plate: 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell him, 'Don't be afraid to tell the pitcher to throw a fastball.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>

KAYAKING COUPLE HOPES TO MAKE WAVES; 
</P>
<P>
SPORTS FESTIVAL: SAN DIEGO'S PATRICK AND DEANNE HEMMENS EXPERIENCED SUCCESS IN 
1989. THIS YEAR, BOTH ARE EXPECTING EVEN MORE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Last year, kayakers Patrick and DeAnne Hemmens of San Diego were happy just 
competing at the U.S. Olympic Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 In their first time out, both did extremely well. But when they compete 
Saturday and Sunday at the Festival in Minneapolis, they will be concentrating 
more on their times and less on the butterflies in their stomachs. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1989 Festival in Oklahoma, DeAnne won a gold medal in K-4 (the term for 
a four-person kayak), placed fourth in K-2 and 13th in K-1. Her husband, 
Patrick, also won a gold medal in the K-4 and a silver in the K-2 500 meters. 
He didn't finish in his K-1 competition because his rudder broke. 
</P>
<P>
This year, both will compete for the West team in the same three events. They 
left for Minneapolis Wednesday and were to receive their partners upon arrival. 
Practice sessions were Thursday and today. Patrick did know that he would again 
be paired with Mitch Kahn of San Clemente in the two-man boat. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Barlow of San Diego and Patrick Richardson of La Jolla are also 
competing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm expecting a little bit more of myself," DeAnne said. "Last year, I was 
just so happy to be there, I couldn't believe I was there. Really, I want it 
for both of us. I really want to see Patrick beat some people that he should be 
beating, and together we can do it. 
</P>
<P>
"I have definite time goals. I wanted to do well at the World Team trials (in 
Lake Placid, N.Y., in June), and I didn't do as well as I hoped, so I sort of 
have something to prove." 
</P>
<P>
Added Patrick: "She has people to beat." 
</P>
<P>
Hearing DeAnne talk of her goals and accomplishments, it's hard to imagine that 
she only has been kayaking a little more than a year and that it all began in 
jest. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the Hemmens were married a year and a half ago, DeAnne said she 
found that between work schedules and Patrick's training schedule, she was 
becoming one of those wives who wait for their husband to get home while dinner 
is getting cold. As a solution, DeAnne learned to kayak. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd train for two to three hours after work, and I never saw him," DeAnne 
said. "It started as a joke. I've always been athletic, but it takes a long 
time to learn to kayak because the boat is so tippy. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember when he was trying to teach me, I thought, 'How can you ever 
paddle?' He used to laugh at me, and say, 'You'll get it, you'll get it.' I'd 
be paddling along slowly about ready to fall, and he'd come sprinting by with 
all his friends. They make big waves as they went by, and I'd usually tip." 
</P>
<P>
Patrick has been kayaking for 10 years but did not begin sprinting, the Olympic 
sport, until last year. A South African, Patrick said marathon kayaking is more 
popular in his homeland, which cannot compete in the Games. Patrick will be 
eligible for American citizenship in December, 1991, after three years of 
marriage. Since he will then be eligible for the 1992 Olympics, he is now able 
to participate in U.S. Olympic Committee-sanctioned events. 
</P>
<P>
So while DeAnne was getting used to sitting in the boat, Patrick was making the 
transition from marathon kayaking on African rivers to sprinting on Mission 
Bay. Marathoners paddle courses as long as 50 miles in one day and up to 170 
miles in four. In the sprints, men compete over 500 or 1,000 meters, women over 
500. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like taking a marathon runner and making him run against Carl Lewis," 
Patrick said. "It's completely different training. I prefer marathons because 
I'm better at it." 
</P>
<P>
Right now, the couple trains two times a day in the water. Every other day, 
they alternate running or lifting weights. They plan to take September off, and 
from October to February, they will do conditioning through running, swimming, 
cross-country skiing and lifting. In the winter, they paddle three of four 
times a week. When the kayak season is ready to resume in March, they begin two 
times a day in the water again. 
</P>
<P>
In the World Team trials in Lake Placid, DeAnne placed eighth overall; five 
women made the team. Patrick was 13th among the men, with eight being chosen. 
</P>
<P>
In August, the couple will travel to the U.S. Nationals in Indianapolis, where 
they will compete in a K-2 together for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"Both of our goals is to make the Olympics," Patrick said. "Just to make the 
team and be able to paddle in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
He added: "It's not a sport where you can come along and suddenly be good in 
six months -- it takes years and years. It takes six months before you feel 
comfortable in the boat. DeAnne used to be a competitive swimmer, so she's got 
a lot of upper body strength. That's why as soon as she got her balance, she 
caught on very fast. Somebody just starting out might take longer. It'll be 
years until DeAnne is world class." 
</P>
<P>
DeAnne said that having her husband at a major competition is nice but can also 
be stressful. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes we both get really stressed out and are thinking of ourselves," 
DeAnne said. "Especially me. Because I'm newer at competing, I think of myself 
a lot. One of my goals in the Olympic Festival and at the nationals is to be 
calm and in control in a stressful situation instead of being out of control. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're going to be competing world class, we want to be together doing it, 
supporting each other and helping each other instead of working against each 
other."

DROUGHT MAY BE OVER FOR CALIFORNIA CONTRACTORS; 
</P>
<P>
CONSTRUCTION: TWO SOUTHLAND FIRMS ARE THE FIRST TO BENEFIT FROM PLANS BY SAUDI 
ARABIA AND OTHER OIL-PRODUCING NATIONS TO BOOST CAPACITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California engineering and construction firms that helped build much of Saudi 
Arabia's oil industry have been weathering a dry decade in the desert kingdom 
and elsewhere, but there are signs that the drought has broken. 
</P>
<P>
Parsons Corp. of Pasadena and Fluor Corp. of Irvine have won 
multibillion-dollar contracts to build and refurbish oil and gas facilities in 
Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
No figures have been released by the companies or by the state-owned Saudi 
Arabian Oil Co., better known as Saudi Aramco. But analysts estimate that each 
contract could be worth as much as $4 billion to $6 billion in the next nine 
years, depending on the eventual scope of the projects. 
</P>
<P>
The contracts are the first oil industry mega-projects to be awarded to U.S. 
engineering and construction firms since collapsing oil prices ended a 
construction boom in the early 1980s. But they are not likely to be the last, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the engineering and construction industry is on the verge of a new 
boom, fueled by growing oil demand and the need to expand oil-production 
capacity not only in Saudi Arabia, but in many of the 13 members of the 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, as well as in non-OPEC nations 
from Asia to Latin America. Saudi Arabia is OPEC's largest oil producer and the 
world's third largest. 
</P>
<P>
And California firms, which have kept in touch with the Saudis during the lean 
times, are in a good position to win future projects, analysts said. "It's a 
story of patience rewarded," said Mary Anne Sudol, an energy industry analyst 
with Fitch Investors Service in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"The scale of the work is much larger than anything (the Saudis) have done in 
recent years," said Leonard J. Pieroni, chairman and chief executive of 
Parsons, a closely held firm. "Certainly this represents some very significant 
work for us and for others." 
</P>
<P>
The Parsons and Fluor awards are two of three major projects that the Saudis 
plan to increase their oil output to anticipate growing world demand in the 
1990s. The third is also expected to go to an American firm, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, Saudi Arabia plans to boost its production capacity 
to as much as 10 million to 11 million barrels a day from the current 7 million 
to 7.5 million. Estimates place the cost of such an expansion from as low as $6 
billion to as high as $40 billion, but the most reasonable estimate is about 
$25 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The wide variation is because of the Saudis' somewhat open-ended plans. If 
world oil demand growth does not meet expectations, projects could be scaled 
back or canceled. In addition, the various project contractors will have some 
flexibility to decide how to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, OPEC has estimated that its members will need to spend $60 billion to 
boost their ability to pump oil to meet world demand in the 1990s. At present, 
OPEC is producing more than the world market can easily absorb, but economists 
predict that demand will outstrip OPEC production unless such expansions occur. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Saudi Arabia, analysts expect major projects to be awarded soon 
by Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates in the Persian Gulf region, Venezuela in 
South America and Indonesia in Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Bechtel Corp. of San Francisco is said to be in the bidding for future 
contracts as are M. W. Kellogg Co. of Dallas and Foster Wheeler Corp. and 
Lummus Crest Inc., both of New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
In Saudi Arabia, Parsons won the contract for projects in Aramco's southern 
region; Fluor will handle those in the north. The third contract will cover the 
central region. 
</P>
<P>
The Parsons and Fluor contracts are structured similarly: five-year initial 
contracts, with options for as much as four more years of work. 
</P>
<P>
Projects will include taking closed facilities out of mothballs, expanding 
existing ones and building new plants. 
</P>
<P>
The projects include everything from gas-oil separation factories to pipelines, 
to offshore platforms and all related infrastructure. The companies will 
provide program management, engineering and other services; other work is 
expected to be subcontracted out to a host of other vendors. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts don't foresee the type of gold-rush mentality that 
characterized Saudi construction projects of the late 1970s, which included 
Parsons' creation -- from the sand up -- of an entire industrial city of 
100,000 people in what was once the tiny village of Yanbu on the Red Sea. 
</P>
<P>
The current projects are "an expansion program of a pretty significant 
magnitude but are being approached in a thoughtful and intelligent manner by 
the Saudis over the next five to nine years," said Deborah Land, a spokeswoman 
for Fluor. "It will probably be a more measured approach than we've seen in the 
past." 
</P>
<P>
As a sign of the more deliberate approach, neither Fluor nor Parsons would 
discuss plans to hire additional personnel. Both said the specifics of the 
projects, including starting times, still had to be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
The caution is in keeping with an industry that has sought to scale back its 
reliance on huge petrochemical projects in the wake of the first boom's 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Pieroni guessed that hydrocarbon projects account for only a third of Parsons' 
revenue now, compared to about two-thirds in the late 1970s. Fluor also has 
diversified into other areas. 
</P>

Spelling Entertainment Idles Sale Plans: Spelling Entertainment, which 
announced Sept. 29 that it was exploring a sale to help reduce parent Great 
American Communications Co.'s debt load, said it did not find satisfactory any 
of the recent bids submitted to buy the company. 
</P>
<P>
Spelling is 46% owned by GACC, which in turn is controlled by Cincinnati 
investor Carl M. Lindner. GACC had put Spelling up for sale in order to pay off 
$125 million in reset notes due in October, but that debt is now being 
restructured. A senior Spelling executive did not rule out an eventual sale of 
the company if a buyer makes an attractive bid.

Western Digital Sued for Patent Infringement: Cadtrak Corp., a small computer 
graphics licenser in San Mateo, Calif., said it filed a lawsuit against Western 
Digital and one of its subsidiaries for allegedly infringing two Cadtrak 
patents that cover several fundamental functions in most computer graphics 
devices. Cadtrak's suit, filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, did not 
specify damages. Western Digital said in a statement that Cadtrak's claim lacks 
merit and that it will file a countersuit asking for treble damages against 
Cadtrak.

Norway Oil Production Resumes: Some offshore oil workers were returning to work 
on the fifth day of a strike over wages, and Norwegian petroleum production was 
up to half the normal level, Norway's national news agency NTB reported. About 
4,000 workers went on strike Sunday after failing to reach agreement on wages 
and job protection. The government invoked compulsory arbitration Monday, 
making the strike illegal.

UAL Suspends Talks on Wide-Body Jets: The Chicago-based parent of United 
Airlines, in a newsletter to employees, said it has temporarily suspended 
negotiations for wide-body aircraft orders with airframe and engine 
manufacturers until Aug. 9. The development was viewed as a sign that the group 
seeking the airline is serious about partly financing the planned $4.4-billion 
buyout with the help of aircraft manufacturers or engine makers, arbitragers 
said. The internal newsletter said the board was acting on a request from 
United Employee Acquisition Corp., the employee-union group attempting a 
leveraged buyout of UAL.

WORLD BANK LENDING DROPS IN FISCAL 1990; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMIC AID: SOME OF THE DECLINE IS LAID TO REDUCED LOANS TO CHINA IN THE WAKE 
OF THE TIAN AN MEN SQUARE MASSACRE.

Lending by the World Bank, the biggest source of aid to the Third World, has 
declined in the past 12 months for the first time since 1985, the bank reported 
Thursday. The decrease was partly because of a reduction in loans to China 
after tanks rolled into Tian An Men Square last year. 
</P>
<P>
Figures for the bank's year, which runs from July 1 to June 30, were made 
public by Moeen A. Qureshi, a Pakistani who is the bank's senior vice president 
for operations. 
</P>
<P>
New loans for the year just ended came to $20.7 billion. That was $600 million 
less than the $21.3 billion the year before. 
</P>
<P>
Loans to China dropped by more than $700 million, falling to $590 million from 
$1.3 billion in the year before the suppression of the democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
Just after the Chinese government moved its military forces against 
demonstrators, Bank President Barber B. Conable Jr. withdrew $780 million in 
loans for China from consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Then President Bush asked the bank to halt lending to China. Later, there was 
international agreement that new loans should be limited to basic human needs. 
</P>
<P>
The past year also brought a large drop in World Bank lending to India, where 
loans fell to $1.9 billion from $3 billion the year before. But bank officials 
said that was a coincidence and not the result of policy. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico displaced India as the biggest borrower, taking $2.6 billion, compared 
to $2.2 billion in the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Lending by the bank had been rising steadily and is expected to increase again 
in the next 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
The bank is playing a much bigger role in what used to be considered the 
"Second World," European countries that have been under Communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
"We have initiated lending to Poland for a total of some $780 million this 
fiscal year . . . and have continued our programs in Hungary," Qureshi said at 
a news conference last week. 
</P>
<P>
"We are preparing support programs for Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia, both of 
which are expected to become bank members in the coming year, and are ready to 
resume our activities in Romania."

U.S. AUTO MAKERS SPLIT ON GAS TAX HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Big Three domestic auto makers are divided over the idea of raising the 
federal gasoline tax to help reduce the budget deficit, unusual in an industry 
that often puts unity ahead of competition in lobbying Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. favor boosting the 9-cent-per-gallon federal 
levy on gasoline by a nickel a year for three to five years. Every penny 
increase would raise about $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
But General Motors Corp., the nation's largest automobile manufacturer, opposes 
any increase in gasoline taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"We have constantly said, and I think Congress has said, that the gasoline tax 
is too regressive, that it hurts the poor people," GM Chairman Roger B. Smith 
said. He discussed the issue with lawmakers during a visit to Washington last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler Chairman Lee A. Iacocca is an outspoken supporter of higher gas taxes, 
which he says would encourage people to drive more fuel-efficient cars. In the 
1980s, Chrysler's marketing strategy emphasized more fuel-efficient vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Iacocca said the higher taxes would boost conservation, lower the nation's 
trade deficit and help counter global warming by curbing emissions. 
</P>
<P>
"Consumers must demand more fuel-efficient vehicles, and today they have no 
reason to do that," Iacocca said. The cost of driving has been cut in half 
since the 1960s when adjusted for inflation and improved fuel efficiency, he 
claimed. 
</P>
<P>
Ford would accept a gradual increase in the gasoline tax as part of a package 
of consumption taxes, company spokesman Mark Miller said. "But we believe it 
should go toward reducing the deficit and not toward increasing government 
spending," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The gasoline tax frequently is mentioned as a potential source of new revenue 
as the White House and congressional leaders negotiate a deficit-reduction 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush has indicated a willingness to abandon his no-new-taxes pledge. 
Senate Republican leader Bob Dole said this week that he expects Bush to reject 
income tax increases in favor of other sources. A White House spokeswoman said, 
however, that the President had ruled out nothing. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the Big Three domestic auto makers' disagreement is how a gas 
tax increase would affect auto sales. 
</P>
<P>
GM contends that many people would delay new-car purchases. The company has 
predicted that a 15-cents-per-gallon increase would reduce sales by 500,000 and 
eliminate 120,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the country wants to see lower car sales," Smith of GM said. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler agrees that a higher tax might hurt sales, "but not significantly," 
spokesman John Guiniven said. "We also feel that reducing the budget deficit 
would reduce interest rates and that could spur car sales and the entire 
economy." 
</P>
<P>
Smith agreed that the federal Treasury needs new revenue but said Congress 
should focus on taxes that would affect a broader segment of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Big Three are a powerful force on Capitol Hill. They usually reach common 
positions on legislative issues with a major impact on their industry, such as 
the Clean Air Act rewrite. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, however, consensus eludes them. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't the norm, but it does happen," said Tim McCarthy, lobbyist for the 
Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Assn., which represents the Big Three, Honda, Volvo 
and some truck companies. "We spend a lot of time trying to reach a consensus. 
It's a competitive industry, with differences of opinion." 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy said it was too early to tell whether the auto makers would clash if 
the budget summit produced an agreement to seek a gasoline tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
Auto makers are more concerned with the impending clean-air negotiations and a 
bill awaiting Senate debate that would boost the minimum average fuel-economy 
requirement for new-car fleets to about 40 miles per gallon from 27.5, he said.

SECURITIES TAX REPORT PUSHES DOW DOWN 32

<P>
Blue-chip stocks posted their biggest loss in two weeks Thursday on selling 
fueled by a report that White House aides were considering a tax on the sale of 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, up 69.30 during the past five sessions 
before Independence Day on Wednesday, dropped 32.42 to 2,879.21. 
</P>
<P>
In the broad market, declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5-to-2 in 
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 397 up, 1,058 
down and 495 unchanged. Big Board volume slipped to 128.32 million shares from 
Tuesday's 130.05 million. 
</P>
<P>
"That tax trial balloon was the culprit," said Jon Groveman, president of 
Ladenburg Thalmann &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
A Wall Street Journal report said the White House is contemplating a proposal 
to levy a tax of up to 0.5% on the sale of stocks, bonds and futures contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that (tax report) really hurt; that, coupled with the fact you had 
sell programs from the opening bell and nothing to offset them," said George 
Pirrone, vice president at Dreyfus Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Program selling contributed to the drop in stocks, but the light volume 
exaggerated the effect of the selling. Traders were also squaring their books 
before today's employment report for June. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Roth, chief technical analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, believes that at 
least part of the selloff may have been related to nervousness over the jobs 
report. While a good report could encourage the Federal Reserve to lower 
interest rates, there is no certainty that the central bank will act on it. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts also said traders were reluctant to chase after the market's recent 
rally, given widespread doubts about prospects for corporate earnings in a 
sluggish economic environment. Earnings reports for the second quarter of the 
year are due in large numbers during the next three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow's drop was led by GM, down 1 1/8 to 47 1/4; Merck, down 1 3/8 to 86 
1/8, and United Technologies, down 1 to 56 7/8. Auto stocks generally were weak 
despite news of strength in recent auto sales. 
</P>
<P>
Other big losers included AMR, down 2 1/4 to 60 3/4; Wells Fargo, down 2 to 74 
7/8, and Wrigley, off 2 1/2 to 54 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
Among S&amp;Ls, HomeFed plunged 2 points early on, then recovered to finish 
down 1 1/4 to 19 5/8, after Merrill Lynch upgraded its short-term rating on the 
stock to "hold" from "below average." 
</P>
<P>
Winners included Genentech, up 1/2 to 29, and Eli Lilly, up 1 1/2 to 86 1/4. A 
group of researchers in Milwaukee said a study suggested that some 
characteristics of physical aging in men could be reversed with a growth 
hormone made by the two companies. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Neutrogena rose 1 3/8 to 23 1/8. Analysts attributed the gain to 
short-covering by traders who had bet that the stock was headed lower. 
</P>
<P>
Microcom tumbled 2 5/8 to 6 1/8. Late Tuesday, the computer networking company 
revised downward the earnings it reported for its last fiscal year and 
increased its estimate of the loss that it expects for the quarter ended June 
30. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices closed lower in Tokyo in slow trading as lack of incentives 
dampened a modest morning rally to end four straight sessions of gains. The 
Nikkei 225-share index lost 94.25 to close at 32,351.67. 
</P>
<P>
In London, stock prices dropped sharply as investors became worried about the 
outlook for corporate profits. The Financial Times 100-share index fell 24.1 to 
close at 2,331.4. In Frankfurt, share prices weakened after early gains to end 
broadly lower. The 30-share DAX index lost 10.95 to end at 1,914.18.

<P>
Bond Prices Fall on Rate Worries 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices generally fell, weakened by fear among traders that signs of 
economic strength are making lower interest rates increasingly unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's key 30-year bond fell about 3/16 point or about $1.87 per $1,000 
in face amount. Its yield increased to 8.40% from 8.38% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bond market strategists said the weakness was generated partly by what they 
called an unexpectedly high figure on 10-day auto sales from Detroit. The Big 
Three said vehicle sales for late June rose 11.9% over the same level a year 
earlier. The market had generally expected a rise of less than 7%. 
</P>
<P>
In the view of bond traders, higher auto sales suggest that consumers aren't 
afraid to finance expensive purchases, which means they are more confident 
about the economy. That, in turn, could raise inflationary pressure. So more 
traders figured that the Federal Reserve won't ease interest rates any time 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8%, down from 8.313% late Tuesday.

Dollar Ends Higher on Technical Factors 
</P>
<P>
The dollar closed moderately higher on world currency markets in light and 
uneventful trading. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. financial markets were closed Wednesday in observance of Independence Day. 
</P>
<P>
Traders in the United States and Europe attributed the dollar's rise to 
technical factors. Lou Calvello, a trader with Prudential-Bache Securities 
Inc., said several dealers were buying dollars to square up their positions 
ahead of Friday's release of unemployment data for June. 
</P>
<P>
The market has been anticipating the Labor Department's report for several 
days. "Hopefully it will spark some activity," said Jim Chorek, an analyst with 
MMS International in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Trading was particularly thin, with many U.S. investors absent from the market 
as they extended their Fourth of July holiday, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar rose to 151.00 Japanese yen from Wednesday's 
150.30 yen. Later in London, the dollar traded lower at 150.50 yen. But in New 
York, the dollar closed higher at 150.57 yen. 
</P>
<P>
In London, one British pound cost $1.7795, cheaper for buyers than Wednesday's 
$1.7845. In New York, it cost $1.7815 to buy one pound. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices fell. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current 
delivery traded at $361.40 an ounce, off 70 cents from late Tuesday. Republic 
National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $360.50, off 50 cents.

Rain Forecast Hurts Corn and Soybeans 
</P>
<P>
Prices of corn and soybean futures wilted on the Chicago Board of Trade after 
the National Weather Service issued a rainy forecast for the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat and oat futures also fell but not as steeply as corn and beans, which are 
grown mainly in the Midwest and would benefit from additional moisture. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodities markets, most oil futures fell; precious metals were 
lower. 
</P>
<P>
Corn futures settled 4.50 to 10 cents lower, with the contract for delivery in 
July at $2.86 a bushel; soybeans were 7 to 23 cents lower, with July at $6.285 
a bushel; wheat was 1.50 to 5.25 cents lower, with July at $3.1825 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
Most contracts for delivery of new-crop corn plunged the permitted daily limit 
of 10 cents a bushel, largely in reaction to a six- to 10-day outlook issued 
Wednesday by the weather service. The forecast was for normal temperatures and 
above-normal rainfall over most of the Corn Belt during the latter half of next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
The losses wiped out gains that had mounted during the past week in reaction to 
predictions, mostly by private meteorologists, that a pattern of unusually 
warm, dry air was setting up in the Corn Belt.

WINE DRINKING DROPS FOR 2ND YEAR IN A ROW

<P>
Wine consumption in the U.S. dropped sharply for the second straight year in 
1989, according to statistics released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Drinkers in California, New York and Washington, the top three wine-producing 
states, drank the most wine per capita, but New Hampshire was the only state to 
show a gain in consumption over 1988, according to Wines &amp; Vines, a trade 
publication. 
</P>
<P>
Americans last year drank 2.11 gallons of wine per capita, the lowest 
consumption of any major wine-producing nation and a 5.8% drop from 1988. 
Consumption in 1988 dropped 5% from 1987 figures. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, Americans over 21 drank 33.7 gallons of beer, 2.16 gallons of 
distilled spirits and about 35 gallons of coffee. Adult-only wine consumption 
was 3.03 gallons per capita. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting a national trend against alcohol consumption, individual states 
posted figures showing as much as a 19.5% drop from 1988. That distinction went 
to Arizona, where a half-gallon less of wine per capita was consumed last year 
than in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The domestic wine market, including imports, fell 5.2% to 523 million gallons. 
It was a 64.1-million gallon drop from a high point of 587.1 million gallons in 
1986, said the report. 
</P>
<P>
Domestic table wines -- still wines not more than 14% alcohol -- fell 2.6%, 
while production of domestic champagnes dropped 6.3%. Last year marked the 
fourth straight year of decline for foreign champagne sales in this country; 
they were down 7.8% to 12 million gallons. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, champagne imports to the United States hit a peak of 15.8 million 
gallons, almost all of it from Italy, France and Spain, which together produce 
more than half of all the wine consumed in the world. 
</P>
<P>
California wines accounted for 72.8% of all wine consumed in the U.S., while 
the other 42 wine-producing states held 12.6% of the market. The rest of the 
market, 14.6%, were imports. 
</P>
<P>
Wines &amp; Vines blamed the market drop on the continuing loss of ground of 
generic or jug wines, nearly all of it produced in California's San Joaquin 
Valley, and a 16.7% dip in wine cooler sales. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second double-digit loss in two years for the coolers, the sales 
phenomenon of the early 1980s that rescued California wine for several years. 
In 1988 and 1989, cooler sales fell 33.3 million gallons, falling from 21% of 
wine market share to 17% last year. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the coolers -- mostly cheap white wine, fruit juice and carbonated water 
-- represented one of six gallons of wine sold in this country last year.

RAP WRAPPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The word from malls, record stores and video arcades as well as the United 
Nations, a Hollywood dance club, is that the heavy gold-chain Mr. T look is 
out. Lately, street versions of rap style are instead inspired by the 
Afro-centric accessories of Boo Ya Tribe, the camouflage gear preferred by 
Public Enemy and the soul-rap style, with dreadlocks and African-print fabrics, 
of Soul II Soul. 
</P>
<P>
Rap fans, especially black teen-agers, picked up on these styles early and made 
them a uniform. Now there are spinoffs, adapted by Latinos, Anglos and Asians, 
that tend to eliminate a few layers of accessories for a more streamlined 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
A prideful, Third World fashion statement, the look relies on American 
classics, especially T-shirts, jeans and high tops, as key ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Freez Luv Farmer, dancing at United Nations, wears a custom-made toque of 
African-print fabrics to which he has added a baseball cap bill. "Our hats are 
modeled after Zulu crowns as a sign of pride," Farmer explains, adding, "We 
created a style that's not just African, it's Afro-American." 
</P>
<P>
T-shirts feature images of such '60s icons as human rights activist Malcolm X, 
as well as such '90s stars as movie maker Spike Lee. 
</P>
<P>
Accessories range from Zulu pendants, African masks and gold nose rings to 
big-faced clocks worn as necklaces. 
</P>
<P>
The fade, with its tall, squared-off top and sheared sides, is the haircut of 
choice. Actor and rap singer Kid, of Kid 'n' Play, set the trend in this 
spring's comic movie "House Party." 
</P>
<P>
Young people creating this global-eclectic style say they hope the resurgence 
of positive images rooted in black heritage will stir people's social awareness 
and help them "wake up," as Spike Lee would say.

THEY HAVE DESIGNS ON THE FUTURE

Exuberance was the order of the day at the graduate fashion shows for Los 
Angeles Trade-Technical College and the Fashion Institute of Design and 
Merchandising. The shows encompassed everything from vampish voguing to the 
spirit of glasnost. 
</P>
<P>
Restaurateur and school alumni Mario Tamayo hosted the show at the Los Angeles 
Trade-Technical College. He opened it by sashaying down the runway with an 
entourage of students modeling avant-garde creations to the tune of "When the 
Saints Come Marching In." 
</P>
<P>
Nighthawk Tamayo paused during the fast-paced presentation to put in his bid 
for evening wear: "obviously my personal favorite." 
</P>
<P>
During its 63-year history, the school has produced some of California's most 
successful designers -- Carole Little, Robin Piccone, Bill Whitten and Tadashi 
Shoji among them. Seniors had just seven weeks to complete up to five garments 
in various categories. The designs were judged by a group of Los Angeles 
designers and manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
Gold thimbles went to Marguerite Leslie for her quilted denim children's wear 
decorated with gold studs, Maria Tsuji for her green corduroy coat and tunic 
over a black bodysuit, Grace Motamedi for her ivory wrap dress and ivory and 
black tweed overcoat, Gloria Lira for her gold lame strapless evening gown and 
Marcella Jennings for her vinyl raincoat appliqued with a moon and stars. 
</P>
<P>
At the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising, the heavy-hitting 
audience included Mayor Tom Bradley and a delegation of entrepreneurs from the 
Soviet Union, here to discuss business opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood costume and ready-to-wear designer Bob Mackie was a guest. "Most 
students try to be practical and gear their way into sportswear," he said. "But 
every now and then, there's some wild person who comes to see me -- and that's 
nice." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Magnanti, from the school's theater costume program, showed a whimsical 
twist on hats, tying up a hat box-sized hat with a taffeta bow to resemble a 
gift box. 
</P>
<P>
After a tribute to Bullock's, the day's honoree, and a presentation about the 
school's new, $33-million building at 919 South Grand Ave., the student show 
began. 
</P>
<P>
Advanced fashion design students each showed eight garments to a panel of 
judges that included costume designer Robert Turturice and FIDM alumni active 
in the fashion industry. 
</P>
<P>
Jill Schleisman took home a trio of awards. Her '60s-inspired, op-art print 
knits with removable purse pockets collected FIDM's Debut Award for Originality 
and Creativity. 
</P>
<P>
Cu Tran's richly colored men's sportswear earned him the school's Debut Award 
for Greatest Commercial Potential. Loretta Pickering was honored for her 
pumpkin-colored ponchos over teal bodywear. FIDM's Debut Award for Fabrication 
and Coloration went to Janie Shiau for her crushed velvet-accented evening 
separates. Most awards were accompanied by a prize of $1,000 supplied by local 
merchants. 
</P>
<P>
Jean-Lafleche Giasson won a awarded for his wool flannel sportswear that 
included jackets with zip-off bottoms. Wearing his solution to the day's heat 
wave, Canadian-born Giasson took his bows in a tailored suit with thigh-high 
trousers: He had sheared them short just before the show.

GIRLS INCORPORATED SEEKING PAST MEMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Girls Incorporated, the national youth service organization that recently 
changed its name from Girls Clubs of America Inc., is mounting a nationwide 
search for past members. 
</P>
<P>
According to Margaret Gates, national executive director, former members with 
success stories "provide excellent role models for the 250,000 girls and young 
women who are currently members of the more than 200 local centers affiliated 
with Girls Incorporated." 
</P>
<P>
The organization, which celebrates its 45th anniversary this year, has been 
praised by psychologists, sociologists and adolescent experts, says Gates, for 
its variety of programs ranging from pregnancy prevention to health and drug 
information. 
</P>
<P>
Past members are invited to write Girls Incorporated 45th Anniversary Search, 
c/o Edelman Public Relations, 1500 Broadway, New York, N.Y. 10036, with 
information about their experiences as Girls Club members.

BIG BOYS NEED TO LEARN HOW TO CRY; 
</P>
<P>
BOOKS: THE DICTUMS OF SOCIETY HAVE RESTRICTED MEN AS MUCH AS WOMEN, SAY THE 
AUTHORS OF THE NEW WORK, 'MEN IN THERAPY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
What Richard L. Meth and his colleagues say is not always popular. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the women's movement, the children's movement and the concern for the 
elderly, they are making a plea for the average guy: the man left behind and 
bewildered by society's rapid changes, and who is often blamed for a complex 
and restrictive system in place eons before he was born. 
</P>
<P>
They say adages such as "big boys don't cry" and "take it like a man" restrict 
men from having a happy and fulfilling emotional life. They say socialization 
has restricted men as much as it has women. 
</P>
<P>
Meth knows not everyone agrees with him. The popular press, in general, makes 
fun of the Alan Alda-sensitive male discussions pervasive in so many 
therapeutic environments. 
</P>
<P>
Big boys, after all, don't cry. 
</P>
<P>
But, Meth says, one of the lesser-examined impacts of the women's movement is 
its effect on men. Now, Meth and others say, big boys had better learn to cry 
-- and laugh and talk about their feelings. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as men perceived themselves as being in a position of power, their 
goal in life was to be successful," says Meth, executive program director of 
the Center for Marital and Family Therapy at the University of Connecticut, 
Storrs. "Men really were not forced to look at the other aspects of their 
lives, and most of their lives were out of balance. Men don't realize they are 
out of balance until it's too late." 
</P>
<P>
That is, until their wives come and ask -- out of the blue, or so the men think 
-- for a divorce. Or until their doctors tell them they have to restrict their 
diets and take up exercise or risk an early grave. 
</P>
<P>
Looking at the women's movement and its effect on men resulted in "Men in 
Therapy," (Guilford Press; $30), which Meth co-wrote with colleague Robert S. 
Pasick, a Michigan psychologist, and others. 
</P>
<P>
The book examines people like John, a 45-year-old who was in a 23-year 
marriage, and uses what Meth calls a universal euphemism employed by men who 
just don't want to open up and talk. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a private person," says John -- a euphemism, Meth says, for: "I am not 
going to be vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
So when a man is in an emotionally critical time, he often can only say he is 
angry -- an aggressive, rather than vulnerable, emotion, Meth says. And even if 
parents make a concerted effort to teach their sons that it's all right to cry, 
society often steps in. Meth, who has a son in preschool, says his boy recently 
told him something that had happened at school and said proudly, "And I didn't 
cry, Dad." 
</P>
<P>
"If his peers say, 'Don't be such a wimp,' he doesn't cry," Meth says. "It 
doesn't matter what Dad says." 
</P>
<P>
Meth says men too often are dragged into therapy by their unhappy female 
partners. They rarely go on their own. 
</P>
<P>
The authors examine men's relationships with their wives, mothers, children, 
fathers and the workplace; how those relationships came to be, and how they 
could be approached differently to keep step with societal shifts. 
</P>
<P>
To people who argue that men are to blame for their own imbalances, Meth says 
most men are only reacting to their socialization.

<P>
"One of the things I do all the time (with clients) is get men to think about 
why they do what they do," he says. "I have asked some men for reasons, and 
they say, 'Because that's what guys do.' 
</P>
<P>
"We try to challenge people to think about these kinds of stereotypical 
behaviors that people take on. When you think about it, if you ask a man why 
they do what they do, this is something they acquired along the way."

5 PARIS MUSEUMS CLOSE AFTER ROUND OF PAINTING THEFTS;

Five Paris art museums closed their doors to individual visitors Thursday after 
paintings were stolen from three museums -- including a Renoir cut out of its 
frame at the Louvre -- over a span of several hours. 
</P>
<P>
Jacques Sallois, director of national museums, said security would be tightened 
at the city's major museums, which remained open. Authorities plan to examine 
existing security systems and develop new ones similar to those used in banks. 
</P>
<P>
The museums closed to individuals are relatively small and focus on the works 
or the collections of a particular individual: the Eugene Delacroix, Gustave 
Moreau, Jean-Jacques Henner, Hebert and Ennery museums. 
</P>
<P>
From now on, group visits to these museums must be arranged in advance, Sallois 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Police have complained previously that museum officials were not aggressive 
enough or candid enough in dealing with security. Sallois, who took up his post 
only five weeks ago, vowed this would change, and said art theft would no 
longer be a "taboo subject" for public discussion. 
</P>
<P>
Sallois' unprecedented announcement came shortly after police said that a third 
museum had suffered a theft during the short time span Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The security risk had been heightened because of a huge increase in visitors to 
French museums following a 10-year government drive to improve facilities and 
provide more space, Sallois said. 
</P>
<P>
"The flow of visitors is causing problems," he said. "The rise in prices on the 
art market is an additional factor. All of this means we must take a new look 
at security in museums." 
</P>
<P>
Sallois said he would meet museum directors and their security chiefs in the 
next few days and hoped to appoint a security chief for the entire sector soon. 
He said there was no evidence of negligence on the part of museum guards, 
however, and expressed confidence in the staff. 
</P>
<P>
Police said it was possible all three thefts were committed by the same person 
or group, moving across the city center from one museum to another. 
</P>
<P>
According to investigators, the theft revealed on Thursday apparently was the 
first to occur in the series. 
</P>
<P>
An 1816 work by French landscape painter Paul Huet was lifted off its hook 
Wednesday morning at the Carnavalet Museum, a historical museum in one of the 
oldest sections of Paris. "Les Moulins de la Glaciere" was estimated to be 
worth about $14,500. 
</P>
<P>
The other two stolen paintings were cut from their frames -- Renoir's "Portrait 
of a Seated Woman" from the Louvre and Ernest Hebert's "Portrait of Monaluccia" 
from the museum named after the artist. 
</P>
<P>
Both were small-format paintings, a type often chosen by thieves because they 
can be easily concealed. 
</P>
<P>
"Portrait of a Seated Woman" (1890-1895) is 13 1/2 by 10 1/2 inches. Hebert's 
work, painted about 1870, is 14 by 12 inches. 
</P>
<P>
The theft of the Renoir was discovered about 2:15 p.m., officials said. The 
Hebert was discovered missing about an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
All three victimized museums are run by the government. 
</P>
<P>
Officials gave no estimates of the value of the Renoir and Hebert. Independent 
experts suggested a possible value of $300,000 to $600,000 for the Renoir. 
</P>
<P>
but said it was impossible to give a precise valuation and noted that Renoir 
had done scores of portraits of women in his later years. 
</P>
<P>
Louvre director Michel Laclotte said the theft of "Portrait of a Seated Woman" 
appeared to be the work of an "especially clever" professional. 
</P>
<P>
"The canvas was very thin, the cutting instrument was probably extremely sharp 
and caused so few vibrations that the electronic sensor did not pick them up," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Laclotte led reporters to where the portrait had been hanging -- an isolated 
stairwell leading to the Denon Gallery, on the top floor of the Pavillon de 
Fleurs overlooking the Seine. 
</P>
<P>
Head painting curator Pierre Rosenberg said the Renoir had been on display in 
the stairwell for several years, due to renovations in other sections of the 
museum, once a royal palace. It was donated to the Louvre in 1961 by French 
collector Victor Lion. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg said Renoir was a "magic name" among art lovers, which could explain 
the theft, the first at the Louvre in more than 10 years.

EAST GERMANY'S 'COMING OUT' OPENS GAY FILM FESTIVAL; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: 'IT'S NOT ONLY GAYS WHO ARE COMING OUT,' SAYS THE DIRECTOR, 'BUT A 
WHOLE SOCIETY.' ONE HUNDRED FILMS FROM 15 NATIONS WILL BE SHOWN. 
</P>

<P>
East German film director Heiner Carow thinks it's ironic that the 
transformation of East Germany from communism to free enterprise is going to 
make it more difficult for movies like his gay-themed "Coming Out" to be made 
there in the future. 
</P>
<P>
But Carow, in town for tonight's screening of "Coming Out" -- the opening-night 
attraction of the eighth annual Los Angeles International Gay &amp; Lesbian 
Film and Video Festival -- was expressing an isolated regret. Otherwise, he is 
joyous about his homeland's political shift and the eventual reunification of 
East and West. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy that so many essential things have changed, that the (Berlin) 
wall is down, that everyone can travel," he said. "But on the other hand, we 
have a lot of problems coming up." 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, he is worried that the reorientation to free markets will dry up 
funding for the arts. 
</P>
<P>
Under a free-enterprise system, Carow believes, money for a gay-themed movie 
would be hard to get. The evidence that he's right is overwhelming, considering 
how few American films about gay people are made. For example, the makers of 
"Longtime Companion," a current film about AIDS, faced major financial 
obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody would finance my movie," Carow said through his son, Stefan, who 
composed the score for "Coming Out" and who, on this occasion, served as his 
father's translator. 
</P>
<P>
In Carow's view, it's a reality of the marketplace that alternative films have 
difficulty finding support. How many producers would finance a story about an 
East Berlin schoolteacher discovering he is gay, he wondered. That is the 
essential story line of "Coming Out." 
</P>
<P>
The feature-length "Coming Out" is one of four films about gay and lesbian life 
in Eastern Europe that will screen at the festival. (See box.) Its presentation 
is co-sponsored by the Goethe Institute, L.A.'s German cultural center. 
</P>
<P>
Although the festival will screen films from other nations in Europe and Asia, 
executive director Larry Horne is particularly excited about the films 
examining life in Eastern Europe. Until now -- and not surprisingly -- the 
lives of gay men and women has been a taboo subject in the party line of the 
Communist East. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, it existed, Horne noted. It just wasn't officially discussed. 
</P>
<P>
He first encountered "Coming Out" at February's edition of the Berlin 
International Film Festival held in the city's Western sector. Horne said the 
movie "created a buzz because it was gay and because it was from East Germany." 
It came at the height of the euphoria over the political changes in Eastern 
Europe and the fall of the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
When Carow was told that the general perception in the West is surprise that a 
gay-themed film was made with government funds in a totalitarian state, he 
nodded with a knowing smile. He said he understands that view. 
</P>
<P>
But in practical terms, he said, the government mandated a film budget that had 
to be awarded. There were 16 awards made annually -- with only slightly more 
applicants. "If you fight the censors hard enough, you usually can win," he 
said. But not always. 
</P>
<P>
The first time he attempted to make a gay film was more than 10 years ago. 
Under the hard-line East German regime of the time, it was not approved by 
censors. The government-run film bureau, DEFA, rejected his pitch. As well as 
angering the director, the rejection motivated him to keep trying. And over 
time, things changed. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last 10 years there has been talk of AIDS and, therefore, more talk of 
homosexuals openly," Carow said. "Some articles were published and 
documentaries were made about homosexuality. All these things were happening 
and my attempt to write a screenplay was a part of this intellectual change, 
which was spurred by Gorbachev." 
</P>
<P>
With obvious pleasure, he added, "The totalitarian government of cement heads 
was beginning to break a little, and they were not able to refuse changes." 
</P>
<P>
The script for "Coming Out," much like the American musical "A Chorus Line," 
was based on extensive interviews that Carow and screenwriter Wolfram Witt 
conducted with dozens of East Berlin gays. They used actual locations, 
including a gay bar and its patrons for several smoky, decadent scenes 
reminiscent of "Cabaret." 
</P>
<P>
The movie went into production on Nov. 10, 1988, and premiered on Nov. 9, 1989 
-- the very day the Berlin Wall began to collapse. In the days before, Carow 
and his company feared that the film might not open, since there was talk of 
police crackdowns and large demonstrations against the rule of former East 
German leader Erich Honecker. Then, on the day of the premiere, when people 
learned that the wall was coming down, "We were very much afraid that nobody 
would attend the performance." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, a large audience came. The applause was so strong at movie's 
end that the creators and actors were called to the stage. As Carow sees it, 
the film's story was symbolic and its timing was crucial. 
</P>
<P>
"Every man, every woman, every citizen of East Germany needs his own coming 
out. It is not only gays who are coming out. It is also a coming out of a whole 
society."

'DIE HARD 2' BLAZES ON THE 4TH OF JULY

<P>
"Die Hard 2," 20th Century Fox's entry in the summer '90 Box Office Blockbuster 
Sweepstakes, grossed $5.9 million on July 4, a day that is traditionally low in 
attendance because of the outdoor celebrations associated with the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's Christmas," shouted a jubilant Tom Sherak, president of marketing and 
distribution at Fox. 
</P>
<P>
"If you'd told me we would do just under $6 million on July 4, I would have 
told you to go to the hospital for a mental checkup." 
</P>
<P>
Sherak said the studio would have been happy with a $4-million July 4; as it 
turned out, "Die Hard 2" grossed almost that much from its preview opening 
Tuesday. The $3.7-million Tuesday receipts will not be counted as opening-week 
figures, however. 
</P>
<P>
"Tuesday is Tuesday, a preview day," said Sherak, preparing some tangled logic. 
"We opened on Wednesday and Tuesday's figure have nothing to do with the 
opening." 
</P>
<P>
The Fox executive declined to predict how well the film will do through Sunday, 
but other analysts said it could do as much as $30 million, which would make it 
the strongest-opening film of the year. 
</P>
<P>
July 4 figures were not released by other studios. JACK MATHEWS

9 SUSPENDED FOR BRAWL IN SEATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight players and Milwaukee Manager Tom Trebelhorn were suspended by American 
League President Bobby Brown Thursday for participating in a 28-minute brawl 
between the Brewers and Mariners last Saturday at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Trebelhorn and Milwaukee pitcher Bob Sebra, who was sent to the minors 
Wednesday, each received five-game suspensions, effective Thursday. Don Baylor, 
the Brewers' batting coach, took over the team for Thursday afternoon's game 
against Oakland, won by the Brewers, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Sheffield, Mike Felder and B.J. Surhoff of the Brewers were suspended for 
three games and fined $300 each. Sheffield's suspension was effective Thursday. 
The others' will begin next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle's Tracy Jones, Gene Harris, Randy Johnson and Jeff Shaefer all received 
three-game suspensions -- Jones' and Harris' effective Thursday and Johnson's 
and Shaefer's to begin next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sebra's suspension will take effect if and when he returns to the major league 
club. The other players have filed intent to appeal the suspensions and are 
eligible to play until hearings are conducted on the case. 
</P>
<P>
Trebelhorn said he would not appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm dead. No use in waiting for the funeral," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Spokeswomen for both leagues said no suspensions involving more individuals had 
been meted out since 1980, and major league baseball was not aware of bigger 
mass suspensions before then. 
</P>
<P>
The brawl at the Kingdome began when Sebra hit Jones with a pitch, which he 
later said was deliberate. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm shocked," Felder said in Milwaukee. "I looked for a fine, but I don't 
think I did anything to be suspended for. I think it's ridiculous to get 
suspended, and I didn't even hit anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Harris, in Cleveland for a game against the Indians, said: "I thought I was 
protecting myself and I get thrown out. That's the only reason I was out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Mariner Manager Jim Lefebvre said the club was disappointed by the severity of 
the penalties. 
</P>
<P>
"But the fines have come down and I respect Dr. Brown's position, because it's 
a tough call," he said. "He has to put an end to this. I just want to get it 
behind us and move on. It's an unfortunate situation. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Brown is doing everything he can to rectify this whole thing. He thinks 
it's fair and he's the president of the league. We all knew something had to be 
done, and it had to be severe to end this thing once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
"This hamstrings both clubs. You lose four players, it's going to hurt you," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Trebelhorn, responding to an earlier accusation by Lefebvre that he had 
instigated, then prolonged, the brawl said he had done neither. 
</P>
<P>
Trebelhorn was thrown to the ground during the melee and suffered a cut 
forehead. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not an instigator in events Saturday night," he said. "I have great 
regret that any of them took place. I did not direct any of our pitchers to 
throw at any of their hitters."

YANKEES MUST PAY ANGELS; 
</P>
<P>
FINE: COMPLAINT YIELDS $200,000 WHEN COMMISSIONER RULES STEINBRENNER TAMPERED 
WITH WINFIELD IN TRADE.

Standing on principle paid off financially for the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent ruled Thursday that comments made by New York 
Yankee owner George Steinbrenner in a May 14 meeting with Dave Winfield after 
the Yankees had traded him to the Angels were "clearly improper," and ordered 
the Yankees to pay fines of $200,000 to the Angels and $25,000 to the Major 
Leagues' Central Fund for tampering. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels had requested $2 million in damages when they filed a grievance with 
Vincent last month. 
</P>
<P>
It was also announced Thursday that Steinbrenner met with Vincent for seven 
hours to discuss his involvement with gambler Howard Spira, whom Steinbrenner 
allegedly paid $40,000 to prevent his revealing embarrassing information about 
former team employees, and who says he was hired to uncover disparaging 
information about Winfield to discredit his charitable foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The Winfield-Mike Witt trade was announced May 11, but Winfield balked at 
reporting, saying that as a 10-year veteran with at least five seasons with one 
team, he was entitled to veto the deal. He immediately stated his intention of 
going to arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
In comments made to Winfield and repeated to reporters, Steinbrenner said that 
the trade had been made without his knowledge or approval, and that he would 
gladly take Winfield back and see that he played regularly if Winfield won his 
arbitration case and remained in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Eager to play again and swayed by a lucrative offer made by the Angels, 
Winfield decided not to take his case to arbitration. On May 16 he agreed to a 
three-year contract extension potentially worth $9.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Steinbrenner's statement that Mr. Winfield would be welcomed back to the 
Yankees if he won the arbitration and should play on a full-time basis was 
clearly improper," Vincent said in a statement from New York. 
</P>
<P>
"It follows, therefore, that Mr. Steinbrenner's improper statements harmed the 
Angels' bargaining position. Although the Angels failed to offer evidence which 
would properly measure their damages, they have demonstrated some degree of 
harm." 
</P>
<P>
Angel General Manager Mike Port, who had filed the grievance and met with 
Vincent last month to state his case, was satisfied that the Angels had been 
vindicated. Neither Steinbrenner nor the Yankees issued a comment on the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
"It was most unfortunate for all concerned (that) we had to pursue the matter 
to begin with," Port said in a prepared statement. "We felt we had a position 
to maintain and had to pursue it accordingly. In the overall, we applaud the 
commissioner for his handling of the entire matter. Needless to say, we're glad 
the entire situation is resolved and that in our regard our baseball focus can 
now return to action on the field." 
</P>
<P>
Winfield preferred to keep his feelings to himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard the Angels were doing this, and they told me it had nothing to do with 
being mad at me," Winfield said. "They were pleased with me and my 
representative, Jeff Klein, but this was something they felt they had to do and 
this is the end result. What has just gone on has nothing to do with me."

PIRATES HAND MARTINEZ HIS FIRST LOSS AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shortly after being named to the National League All-Star team Thursday, Ramon 
Martinez learned one of the best things about achieving such an honor. 
</P>
<P>
You can pitch poorly in your next start, and people will still cheer you. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, those were cheers cascading over Martinez's lowered head in the fifth 
inning when he was removed from an eventual 9-6 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates 
before 36,231 at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Not that he didn't warrant some applause. After all, he had struck out six in 
his 4 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
But his problems were with the balls the Pirates hit. In Martinez's brief 
effort, Pittsburgh collected three home runs, including back-to-back homers by 
Andy Van Slyke and All-Star outfielder Bobby Bonilla. They added four 
line-drive singles, amounting to seven runs, six earned. It was the first loss 
after seven victories at home for Martinez (9-4), who will go to the All-Star 
game at Wrigley Field in Chicago next week in his biggest slump of the season. 
</P>
<P>
In his last two starts, he has totaled just 9 1/3 innings, allowing 10 earned 
runs. During that time he has struck out nine, but walked eight, while his 
earned-run average jumped from 2.62 to 3.20. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez's performance against the NL East leaders was also untimely for the 
Dodgers, as they had scored four runs in the first inning against rookie 
pitcher Rick Reed, making his third start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
That inning featured a two-run single by Mike Scioscia, the other Dodger 
selected to the All-Star team Thursday. Because of San Diego catcher Benito 
Santiago's broken arm, Scioscia will start and bat seventh, according to 
National League Manager Roger Craig. 
</P>
<P>
He will be the first Dodger catcher to start the All-Star game since Roy 
Campanella in 1954, and the first Dodger player to start the game at any 
position since Steve Sax started at second base in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
In the Dodgers' first inning, Hubie Brooks had an RBI single, his sixth RBI of 
the seven-game home stand, and Juan Samuel had a sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
But after that inning, Reed held. And Martinez didn't. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates scored four runs off Martinez to tie the game in the second, and 
added an unearned run in the fourth and two more in the fifth to knock him out. 
In doing so, they reminded him that he wasn't the only member of this year's 
All-Star team on the field. 
</P>
<P>
In the second, All-Star outfielder Barry Bonds led off with a single and stole 
second. Three pitches later, on a 2-and-0 fastball, Sid Bream homered to right 
field to make it 4-2. Bonds later hit his 15th homer, a two-run shot in the 
seventh inning against Mike Hartley. 
</P>
<P>
The homer by Bream was just the beginning, as Mike LaValliere then singled and 
Jose Lind walked, setting up an RBI single by Wally Backman and sacrifice fly 
by Jay Bell. 
</P>
<P>
While Reed was retiring 17 consecutive Dodgers at one point, Martinez and his 
teammates were struggling. LaValliere led off the fourth with a fly ball to 
right field that dropped out of Brooks' glove for a two-base error. One out 
later, Reed singled in only his seventh at-bat this season. The hit moved 
LaValliere to third, where he scored on a fly ball to left field by Backman. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez escaped the inning without further damage by fooling Bell into a 
grounder to shortstop. But the worst was yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
On Martinez's fifth pitch of the fifth inning, Van Slyke hit his full-count 
fastball over the left-field fence for his ninth homer. On the next pitch, 
Bonilla hit a ball in nearly the same place for his 15th homer. It was the 
Pirates' first back-to-back homers since opening day. 
</P>
<P>
Van Slyke is the only Pirate starting outfielder not in the All-Star game, but 
he could have easily been selected, as he has 40 RBIs and a .300 average. 
</P>
<P>
Reed was finally driven from the game in the seventh inning, when his streak 
was broken by a double by Samuel and a walk to pinch-hitter Stan Javier. He was 
replaced by rookie Scott Ruskin, who walked pinch-hitter Mike Sharperson, and 
then allowed a two-run bouncing single between shortstop and third base by Kirk 
Gibson. The hit gave Gibson six multi-RBI games in just 21 starts. His single 
in the first inning had already extended his hitting streak to six games. 
</P>
<P>
But with runners on first and third, Ruskin caught Kal Daniels looking at a 
third strike to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Reed allowed six runs in 6 2/3 innings. He is 2-0 in three starts since being 
recalled by from triple-A Buffalo on June 5. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Terry Wells will fill the "undecided" spot in the Dodgers' pitching rotation 
Sunday and face Pittsburgh in the final game before the All-Star break. . . . 
There was no indication Thursday of the past bad blood between the Pirates and 
Dodgers. The fans stirred when Hubie Brooks was hit in the right forearm by a 
pitch from Stan Belinda in the eighth, but Belinda, who also threw inside to 
Eddie Murray and Mike Scioscia in that inning, was just wild. 
</P>
<P>
The presence of five relievers on the National League All-Star team made Dodger 
pitching coach Ron Perranoski smile. As a reliever for the Dodgers in 1963, 
Perranoski was 9-1 with 12 saves at the All-Star break and did not make the 
team. As a reliever with the Minnesota Twins in 1970, he had 21 saves at the 
All-Star break and did not make the team. 
</P>
<P>
Despite three days off, there won't be much of a break for the Dodgers next 
week. They will work out at Dodger Stadium Tuesday morning, and fly to Chicago 
Wednesday morning for a series with the Cubs, which begins Thursday. . . . Ron 
Walden, the Dodgers' top pick in the June draft, improved his record to 2-0 in 
his second professional start for Great Falls in the Pioneer Rookie League with 
a 5-1 victory over Salt Lake City. In 14 2/3 professional innings, Walden has 
yet to allow an earned run.

GARRISON'S SHOCKER PUTS GRAF OUT COLD; 
</P>
<P>
WIMBLEDON: THE NO. 1 WOMEN'S PLAYER IS STUNNED IN THREE SETS. NAVRATILOVA BEATS 
SABATINI IN THE OTHER SEMIFINAL.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The world of women's tennis started spinning a little faster at Wimbledon, 
where on a dreary, gray, cold Thursday afternoon, the temperature and Steffi 
Graf fell like a drop shot. 
</P>
<P>
Zina Garrison, a 26-year-old Texan from the public courts of Houston, was 
splendid on the grass of Centre Court. Garrison, who had never won a Grand Slam 
semifinal, scored a shocking 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 victory over Graf, the two-time 
defending champion. 
</P>
<P>
The final on Saturday, which once seemed sure to include Graf, instead pits 
Garrison against Martina Navratilova, who defeated Gabriela Sabatini, 6-3, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova reacted to Graf's defeat by shrugging her shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
"I am playing somebody nobody expected to be there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Navratilova did her part to reach the expected showdown with Graf, 
the 21-year-old West German unexpectedly found herself on the short end of a 
long match. 
</P>
<P>
The temperature plummeted to 45 degrees and spectators huddled together, many 
of them wearing parkas because of the biting wind. At 4:06 p.m., after 2 hours 
2 minutes, they saw Garrison send an ace down the middle on match point. 
</P>
<P>
Garrison raised both arms in triumph and ran to the net to shake hands with 
Graf. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just made to be," Garrison said. 
</P>
<P>
It was just a colossal upset. Garrison scored her only other victory over Graf 
in 1985 and had lost five times to her since. In the 3 1/2 years since she 
became No. 1, Graf's record was 269-9. 
</P>
<P>
Graf, though, put her defeat into perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"Just a simple loss," she said. "Is it a tragedy? Is it a disaster? Who knows?" 
</P>
<P>
Garrison's ploy was to come in on Graf's backhand and stand firm at the net, no 
matter how hot Graf's forehand. 
</P>
<P>
"I just guessed right at the right time," Garrison said. "And the main thing, I 
wasn't afraid of her power. A lot of people are afraid of her power when she 
hits the forehand." 
</P>
<P>
Graf's trademark shot, the most feared weapon in women's tennis, was strangely 
inconsistent against Garrison. But Graf's serve betrayed her in the first set. 
</P>
<P>
The early advantage went to Garrison when she broke Graf in the second and 
fourth games for a 4-1 lead. Graf broke back to reach 4-2, but at 5-3, she 
double-faulted, giving Garrison a set point, and then stroked a forehand wide, 
to end the first set. 
</P>
<P>
Graf won the second set in 39 minutes and began feeling good about her game for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"After I won the second set, I thought I was playing a little better, so I was 
thinking, 'I'm back in the match,' and I thought I would be OK," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She was not. Graf lost the second game of the third set when Garrison's return 
of a second serve -- a backhand down the line -- made the most of a third 
break-point opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Down 2-1, Graf had two break-point chances in the next game, but Garrison saved 
one when Graf made a forehand error and the other on a service winner. Graf 
stayed close, held for 4-5 and watched Garrison walk to the baseline, take the 
ball and serve for the match. 
</P>
<P>
The final game took five minutes, and it seemed like an eternity to Garrison. 
But when it was over, she looked toward the stands in the direction of her 
husband, Willard Jackson, and coach, Sherwood Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
"One more match, that would be a dream come true," Garrison said. 
</P>
<P>
But she will play it against Navratilova, who counts eight Wimbledon 
championships among her 17 Grand Slam singles titles. Navratilova is 27-1 
against Garrison. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, my record is overwhelming," Navratilova said. 
</P>
<P>
She was equally overwhelming against Sabatini. Navratilova took a 4-0 lead in 
the first set and glanced back only briefly. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of staying at the baseline, Sabatini attacked the net regularly and 
tested Navratilova's passing shots. It was the right tactic, but it produced 
the wrong result. 
</P>
<P>
"She's tough, very tough, but she's beatable," Sabatini said of Navratilova. 
</P>
<P>
In defeat, Graf avoided giving Garrison much credit, preferring instead to 
blame her own play. 
</P>
<P>
"I think now it's pretty sure Martina's tournament," Graf said. "Zina doesn't 
have the game to beat Martina." 
</P>
<P>
Possibly so, but at least there is no difference in clothes between them. 
Garrison wears tennis clothes from the Martina Navratilova collection, designed 
by Navratilova's friend, Judy Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
Garrison and Navratilova wore identical shirts in the semifinals. That made 
Navratilova start worrying about the final. 
</P>
<P>
"What will we do?" Navratilova said. "We'll look like twins if we wear the same 
shirt." 
</P>
<P>
Garrison has been getting her tennis clothes washed at Navratilova's rented 
house near the All England Club because it has a washer and dryer. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I'll hide them," Navratilova said. "Or shrink them." 
</P>
<P>
It was left to Garrison and Sabatini to critique Graf, whose near-infallibility 
on the court now is being severely questioned. 
</P>
<P>
Graf has failed to win her last three tournaments -- the German Open, French 
Open and Wimbledon -- for the first time in nearly four years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just one match . . . she just lost today and it's not the end," Sabatini 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Garrison said that Graf has lost nothing except a few matches. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's too quick to say her dominance has slipped," Garrison said. "I 
mean, Steffi is the champion. And, you know, she'll definitely be coming back 
every time." 
</P>
<P>
Just not this time, not today anyway. Gone too is Garrison's reputation for not 
winning the big one. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if you believe in yourself, that's all that matters," she said.

VAUGHT WORKING ON IMPROVING HIS GAME; 
</P>
<P>
CLIPPERS: SECOND FIRST-ROUND PICK GOT STARTED LATE IN BASKETBALL, BUT HE WANTS 
TO DO IT ALL NOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
He was 24 inches long at birth and 6 feet 6 inches by the ninth grade. But the 
day Loy Vaught's mother saw him take a pass over the middle, arms extended, and 
get popped in the ribs by the defensive back was the day the NFL lost a 
prospect. 
</P>
<P>
"She thought I was too big a target," Vaught said. 
</P>
<P>
So football was out. Just before beginning his 10th-grade year in Grand Rapids, 
Mich., basketball was in, even though that was the first time Vaught ever 
played in an organized setting. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the target is larger than ever, and so is his star quality. The Clippers 
picked him out of a crowd of big men last week in the NBA draft to help cure 
their rebounding problems, making the 6-9 forward from the University of 
Michigan the 13th choice overall. 
</P>
<P>
Vaught hasn't played the game nearly as long as most who will make the jump 
from college to the pros this fall. Neither side sees that as bad, though -- it 
just leaves more room to improve. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the Clippers laud his blue-collar approach to the game, a phrase that 
surely will be tossed around often. Vaught won't mind, either. On a team full 
of scorers and passers, Vaught doesn't mind the label or the dirty work inside. 
In fact, he takes pride in it, considering that his father, a construction 
worker and handyman, made his living with that approach. 
</P>
<P>
"I took his work ethic and applied it to sports," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With profitable results. Vaught, the second of three Michigan players to go in 
the first round despite not being flashy, is already being careful not to be 
typecast as a one-dimensional player. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think many people out here know I can shoot the ball fairly well," 
said Vaught, who was at a Clippers' news conference Thursday, along with the 
team's other first-round choice, Bo Kimble. "I have confidence in my whole 
game. . . . I want to be known not only as a rebounder, but a total player." 
</P>
<P>
Added General Manager Elgin Baylor: "Loy is a physical player, and I like that. 
He doesn't mind going out and getting on the floor after a loose ball. And he 
can shoot. But because he's such a good rebounder, that's something 
overlooked." 
</P>
<P>
Kimble said he will keep jersey No. 30, the same one he wore at Loyola 
Marymount, rather than switching to 44 in memory of Hank Gathers, his late 
friend. Still, the Clippers might ask the league for permission so Kimble can 
wear a tribute to Gathers somewhere on the uniform. 
</P>
<P>
"I need to find out if the NBA will allow it," Kimble said. "Ideally, I'd like 
to have a patch with a number 44 for remembering Hank." 
</P>
<P>
Vaught will wear No. 35. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers have sold about 300 season tickets since the draft, the surge 
being credited to the selection of Kimble, a popular local player. 
</P>
<P>
It's a nice run for the Clippers, who have promoted Kimble since they drafted 
him, but it's not a record-setting pace. It took only two days for the Clippers 
to sell 200 season tickets after winning the lottery and the right to take 
player of the year Danny Manning in the spring of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Though they have made a qualifying offer to Ken Bannister, thereby guaranteeing 
the right of first refusal, the Clippers continue to search for a backup 
center. After passing on a couple of possibilities in the draft to select 
Vaught, they have decided to look at veteran Keith Lee in summer league. 
</P>
<P>
The 11th pick overall in 1985 after starring at Memphis State, Lee, a 6-10, 
220-pounder, has played with Cleveland and New Jersey. He was left unprotected 
in the expansion draft and taken by Orlando, but missed the entire season 
because of leg problems. The Clippers talked to him about coming to camp a year 
ago, but the two sides could not agree on a contract. 
</P>
<P>
Summer league at Loyola Marymount opens July 20. Bannister probably will be 
there, and guards Tom Garrick and Jeff Martin also are expected. Gary Grant, 
returning from a broken ankle, might play part of the schedule.

COLEMAN GETS 7-GAME SUSPENSION

Vince Coleman of the St. Louis Cardinals was suspended for seven games 
Thursday, a day after he bumped umpire Ed Montague during an argument. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman's suspension is effective today. 
</P>
<P>
National League President Bill White also fined Coleman an undisclosed amount. 
</P>
<P>
White ruled Coleman hit Montague in the nose with the bill of his batting 
helmet and opened a cut as they argued face to face. Coleman continued to use 
profanity and delayed Wednesday's game in San Francisco, White said. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute began after Montague called out Coleman on a steal attempt in the 
sixth inning. Coleman was ejected. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel good about it," Coleman said. "If you look at it rationally, you 
know I wasn't trying to butt him in the head. 
</P>
<P>
"He reacted as if he wanted to fight. I think there should be a $500 fine for 
the both of us and call it even," he said.

GOLF ROUNDUP: O'MEARA, HICKMAN HOT AT 64 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mark O'Meara beat the heat and his mid-season blues with a seven-under-par 64, 
and shared the first-round lead with late-finishing Greg Hickman after 
Thursday's opening round of the Anheuser-Busch Golf Classic at Williamsburg, 
Va. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly can't say that my confidence was riding very high when I teed off 
today," said O'Meara, who missed the cut in two of his past three events and 
tied for 66th in the other. 
</P>
<P>
O'Meara had nine birdies and two bogeys on the Kingsmill Golf Club's layout 
along the James River. Then Hickman, a rookie playing in the next-to-last 
group, put together seven birdies, two bogeys and an eagle for a 64. 
</P>
<P>
Lanny Wadkins and Brian Claar were a shot back. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Norman, who leads the 1990 money list with $832,709, opened with a 
five-under 66 and was joined at that figure by Larry Mize, Larry Rinker, Donnie 
Hammond, Russ Cochran and Jim Gallagher Jr. 
</P>
<P>
A large group at 67 included Curtis Strange, who lives at Kingsmill, and Hal 
Sutton, whose round included a hole-in-one on the 177-yard 17th hole. 
</P>
<P>
On a humid day when the temperature rose well into the 90s and there was 
virtually no wind, many of the golfers found Kingsmill played shorter than its 
6,790 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"The greens look like they pumped a lot of water into them last night, and it 
becomes just like a birdie shootout," Norman said. "It's a putting competition 
is all it is." 
</P>
<P>
O'Meara, who finished third in the season-opening Tournament of Champions and 
got career victory No. 5 at Pebble Beach four weeks later, said he's unsure why 
he starts strong every year and tails off toward the middle of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"Mentally I feel like maybe I play too much in the beginning of the year," he 
said. "Maybe I need to back off." 
</P>
<P>
Hickman, 35, a veteran of the mini-tour, has missed the cut in nine of his 13 
events this year. 
</P>
<P>
Britain's Mark Mouland fired a two-under-par 67 and retained his lead after the 
second round of the Monte Carlo Open with a 36-hole score of 130. 
</P>
<P>
Australia's Wayne Riley was two shots back after a 64 in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
Spain's Seve Ballesteros made a hole in one on the 140-yard second hole. He 
shot a 66 and is at 138.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; 
</P>
<P>
SIEGEL-MAYBERRY COMBINATION VICTORY TOTAL DOWN, BUT QUALITY AND PAYCHECKS ARE 
UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The other day at Hollywood Park, while their 3-year-old filly, Conifer, stood 
in her paddock stall and stared out of funny-looking blinkers, owner Mace 
Siegel and trainer Brian Mayberry talked with Martin Pedroza, who in a few 
minutes would ride the horse in the $32,000 claiming race. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, Martin, I hope you don't mind me telling you something," Siegel said. 
"Nobody will complain if you win this race by too big a margin." 
</P>
<P>
Pedroza, who rides -- and wins -- a lot of races for the Siegel-Mayberry 
combination, simply smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"We might win a race," Siegel said of Conifer, who was the odds-on favorite, 
"but she'll probably have a different owner afterward." 
</P>
<P>
Conifer, who in her only previous races had run unclaimed for $50,000 and 
$62,500 while finishing second twice at Del Mar last summer, won the Hollywood 
race. Siegel's antennae fooled him, though, for no one claimed her, and no one 
complained to Pedroza about the four-length victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody would want this horse," Mayberry chortled a little later. "Next time, I 
might drop her down to $16,000 and run her." 
</P>
<P>
One race after Conifer's victory, Pedroza, Siegel and Mayberry were right back 
in the winner's circle, thanks to a triumph by Exemplary Star, a 2-year-old 
colt making his first start and running for a $62,500 claiming price. 
</P>
<P>
The purses for the two races totaled only $44,000. The Siegels -- Mace, his 
wife Jan and their daughter Samantha -- and Mayberry quietly peck away 
financially, and this is the way their large, varied stable has earned more 
than $400,000 at the current Hollywood meeting. For the year, the Siegel 
operation has earned more than $1 million, seventh nationally by the Daily 
Racing Form's reckoning. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not winning as many races, but we have a better quality of horse and 
they're picking up more paychecks," said Mace Siegel, a 64-year-old real estate 
developer. "We're ahead of last year's pace." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Siegels won 88 races -- 11 stakes -- and their horses earned 
about $2 million, 13th in the country. 
</P>
<P>
There's much more than claiming races to their game, however. Mace Siegel, who 
has been involved in racing for about 20 years, got serious about the horses he 
was buying a few years ago, and now he's capable of spending a million or two 
on young prospects in a single year. 
</P>
<P>
Many of them come from Florida, where Mayberry, a third-generation trainer, 
used to work before he was coaxed into coming to California in 1984. J.P. 
Mayberry, the trainer's grandfather, saddled Judge Himes, the winner of the 
Kentucky Derby in 1903. 
</P>
<P>
"I never knew my grandfather, who died young," Mayberry said. "He was supposed 
to have trained for a lot of big gamblers. I don't know if that's true, 
exactly, but that's what they say." 
</P>
<P>
The most Mayberry has paid for a horse on behalf of the Siegels has been 
$185,000 for a son of Stop the Music who was incurably slow. He won a race or 
two, but not enough for Mace Siegel and Mayberry to remember his name readily. 
</P>
<P>
More typical of the Siegel-Mayberry purchases is the $44,000 spent on Stormy 
But Valid, a 4-year-old filly who gave Mayberry his first major victory and who 
has earned close to $400,000; and the $47,000 spent on Garden Gal, who will be 
one of the favorites at Hollywood Saturday in the $100,000 Landaluce for 
2-year-old fillies. 
</P>
<P>
Stormy But Valid provided a one-third interest in the Siegels' greatest day, 
when three of their horses were shipped in from California last November and 
swept the preliminary stakes on the Breeders' Cup program at Gulfstream Park. 
Records of such accomplishments aren't kept, but racing historians wonder if 
the same stable has ever won three consecutive stakes on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
The day before the Breeders' Cup, another Siegel horse won a stake at 
Gulfstream. 
</P>
<P>
Mace Siegel likes to buy Florida stock because of bloodline strains, which he 
feels are advantageous when the horses run at the speed-favoring California 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
"Florida has a lot of speed breeding," Siegel said. "The Mr. Prospectors, 
horses like that. They're the kind of horses that match up with the race tracks 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally, the Kentucky studs don't sire the horses that are bred to run in 
California. Nelson Bunker Hunt had all of those Kentucky-breds that ran out 
here. They were bred to run all day, but they weren't the kind of horses that 
were bred to win consistently in California. Hunt's horses were bred to run in 
Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Siegel has given up on buying Canadian horses, because he believes they don't 
bring the necessary competitive edge when they race in the United States. He's 
not very active at California sales. 
</P>
<P>
"The decent horses sold in California cost too much money," Siegel said. "I'm 
never really comfortable going to the California sales. You don't have a handle 
on what's going on behind the scenes." 
</P>
<P>
Garden Gal, a daughter of Valid Appeal, is a Florida-bred. In her first race, 
she barely lasted but held off Long Time Ago, another entrant in the Landaluce, 
in a quick 1:02 4/5 for 5 1/2 furlongs. That's the kind of speed Mace Siegel 
wishes all of his horses would bring with them from Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Siegels won the 1988 Landaluce with Distinctive Sis. . . . Saturday's race 
drew a field of 11, including the John Mabee-owned entry of Long Time Ago and 
Alyfair. . . . Gary Jones, who saddled the winning Classic Fame in Wednesday's 
American Handicap, has Annual Reunion running Sunday in the $150,000 Hollywood 
Oaks for 3-year-old fillies. Annual Reunion will be going from grass to dirt, 
having run second to Materco in the Honeymoon Handicap on June 2. 
</P>
<P>
Although Classic Fame is eligible for the Breeders' Cup at Belmont Park on Oct. 
27, Jones will probably send the Irish import in other directions, because he's 
a bleeder who runs on Lasix, a diuretic that's not permitted in New York. "I 
think by October, this horse might be able to handle a mile and a half (the 
distance of the $2-million Breeders' Cup Turf), but I'd rather not take the 
chance of running in New York," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Chris McCarron, who suffered broken legs and a broken forearm in a spill at 
Hollywood Park on June 3, is off crutches and is beginning a therapy program 
that he hopes will enable him to resume riding by the end of the year. . . . Go 
and Go, the winner of the Belmont Stakes, doesn't have any front teeth on the 
bottom. He was kicked in the chin long before he ever ran a race. . . . The 
Daily Racing Form has added medication information to its past-performance 
summaries.

<P>
Well, my triple streak ended at one in a row when none of my horses in the 
seventh, eighth and ninth races could find the winner's circle, so it cost me 
$20 of my bankroll. 
</P>
<P>
However, I am going to stick with the triples, making a $15 bet on Warrior and 
Circumsteller in the first to Ono Gummo and Superbe King in the second to Fire 
Back in the third and a $10 straight triple Warrior-Ono Gummo-Fire Back.

<P>
A motorist who was shot in the head as he drove onto a Ventura Freeway on-ramp 
in Sherman Oaks was in critical condition Thursday at the Medical Center of 
North Hollywood, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was identified as Juan Manrique, 18, of Arleta. He was shot about 
9:30 p.m. Wednesday as he turned from Woodman Avenue onto the westbound 
entrance to the freeway, Lt. Warren Knowles said. The gunman fired five or six 
shots at Manrique and a 20-year-old passenger from a passing car on Woodman, 
Knowles said. The passenger was not hit. 
</P>
<P>
The motive for the shooting was not known, and police said they had no 
indication that it was gang-related.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 5 BUILDINGS REOPENED AFTER COLLAPSE OF ROOF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Long Beach officials Thursday reopened five of eight music complex 
buildings that were closed after the roof of a recital hall suddenly collapsed 
Monday into a heap of rubble. 
</P>
<P>
Two buildings constructed in the same style as the Gerald R. Daniels Recital 
Hall remained closed as well as the 8-year-old hall, which has been fenced off 
and is being patrolled around-the-clock by campus security guards. 
</P>
<P>
Structural inspections showed that five brick buildings containing classrooms, 
practice rooms and faculty offices were safe, said university spokeswoman Toni 
Beron. She added that two larger buildings next to the hall probably will be 
reopened next week.

LA YOUTH PUBLICATION TAKES SERIOUS APPROACH TO SERVING AUDIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Alleged police brutality of minority teens. A first-person account of childhood 
molestation. Two pages crammed with articles on responsible sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
That's pretty heady stuff for a group of high school journalists. 
</P>
<P>
But it's regular fare in LA Youth, a publication put out by 100 or so high 
school students from throughout Los Angeles County. With a citywide circulation 
of 50,000, editors of the news tabloid say LA Youth gives teens a voice that 
often is not heard in mainstream publications. 
</P>
<P>
The paper, the youngest in a chain of teen-oriented publications across the 
nation, is no stranger to hard-hitting news coverage that attracts attention 
from teens and adults citywide. 
</P>
<P>
But the current issue seems to have struck a particularly responsive chord. 
</P>
<P>
Since publishing its June-July cover story on alleged police brutality, 
staffers say they have fielded an avalanche of calls from interested adults and 
high school students who say they too have been the victims of police abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"We have received 250 phone calls about this issue," said Donna Myrow, 
executive director of LA Youth. "We got calls from students interested in 
joining the paper, students who wanted to share their experiences with the 
police and teachers who wanted more copies. . . . We have never gotten such a 
response." 
</P>
<P>
The article, titled "Do Police Abuse Teens?," used a February confrontation in 
Will Rogers State Historic Park between 26 youths and members of the Los 
Angeles Police Department to focus on the larger issue of alleged police abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, lawyers for the youths filed a $5.2-million lawsuit against the 
police officers and the city. Attorneys for the youths have said the incident, 
which allegedly occurred Feb. 12, was racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
In writing the story, 16-year-old Josie Valderrama, a student at Sherman Oaks 
Center for Enriched Studies High School, interviewed several gang members, some 
of the alleged victims, church leaders, lawyers, the FBI and Los Angeles Police 
Cmdr. William Booth. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Fred Nixon, the department's chief spokesman, said police are conducting an 
internal investigation of the incident. Nixon would not comment further because 
of the pending litigation. He said he has not seen a copy of LA Youth and 
declined to comment on the article. Valderrama said she is surprised and 
gratified by the attention the article has received -- including inquiries from 
Time magazine and "Good Morning America." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think teens are valued much in society," Valderrama said. "Papers 
seldom show us in a favorable light. I feel it is important to show that teens 
do more than worry about SATs (aptitude tests) and hang out in shopping malls." 
</P>
<P>
And that's what separates LA Youth from other papers, she said. The paper 
focuses on issues that are pertinent to teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
Published six times a year by the Los Angeles bureau of Youth News Service, a 
national nonprofit teen-oriented wire service, LA Youth is circulated to 97 
high schools in the city and every public library, said Myrow, one of two paid 
adult staff members. The other, Elizabeth Hartigan, a former reporter for the 
Los Angeles Daily News, serves as editorial adviser for the young journalists. 
</P>
<P>
The paper, which is going into its third year of publication, is part of a 
growing network of teen-produced papers that began in Chicago in 1977 with the 
creation of New Expression. 
</P>
<P>
That publication was the first citywide high school publication in the country 
written by and for teens, said Craig Trygstad, a co-founder of New Expression 
and executive director of Youth Communication, the umbrella group for the youth 
media network. 
</P>
<P>
Now there are teen-oriented papers in Portland, Ore., New York, Toronto and 
Wilmington, Del., Trygstad said. All participate in the Washington-based Youth 
News Service, which feeds youth-related information to more than 500 schools 
and corporate clients. 
</P>
<P>
LA Youth has an operating budget of nearly $100,000, which comes from grants 
given by foundations and companies ranging from the James Irvine Foundation to 
American Airlines. Its one-room office at 6030 Wilshire Blvd. consists of three 
computers, a typewriter and two phones. 
</P>
<P>
The paper, which has no formal ties with the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, is delivered to teachers who take responsibility for circulating it 
to students. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the paper is invaluable," said school board member Rita Walters. "The 
paper demonstrates in a tangible way the importance of the Fourth Estate and 
what a free press means to Democratic principles." 
</P>
<P>
Any high school student with an interest in voicing an opinion or dealing with 
a teen-related issue is encouraged to volunteer, Hartigan said. Staffers 
stressed repeatedly during interviews that the paper offers a freedom that 
seems absent from some area high school newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
"If all the topics that were covered in their latest issue appeared in one 
issue at some high school papers, the adviser would probably be looking for a 
new assignment," said Dan Auiler, teacher and adviser for the Franklin Press at 
Franklin High School in Los Angeles.

MAN GIVEN 3 YEARS FOR STEALING STOCKS; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: JUDGE CHIDES THE 'SWEETHEART SWINDLER' FOR SHOWING A 'COMPLETE LACK OF 
CONTRITION.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Leslie Gall, the "Sweetheart Swindler" accused of wooing and bilking elderly 
women in California and Florida, was sentenced Thursday in Norwalk Superior 
Court to three years in prison for stealing $54,000 in stock certificates from 
a Pico Rivera woman he dated. 
</P>
<P>
Gall's sentence was a year short of the maximum he could have received for the 
crime. He pleaded guilty last month to grand theft charges. After serving his 
time here, his lawyer said, he will be extradited to Florida to face charges of 
forgery and felony theft from a 69-year-old Ft. Lauderdale beautician whom he 
allegedly defrauded of $42,000. Eleven counts of forgery and fraud are also 
pending against him in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Police say the paunchy, 56-year-old, Canadian-born Gall defrauded at least two 
women in Florida, in addition to the one in Pico Rivera, and was setting up a 
73-year-old Redondo Beach woman for another swindle when he was arrested in May 
on the outstanding Florida warrants. 
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrest in Redondo Beach, detectives found the Pico Rivera woman's 
stock certificates in his briefcase, along with stacks of blank checks, stolen 
and forged identification, blank power-of-attorney forms, obituaries of wealthy 
men and newspaper clippings about other confidence scams. 
</P>
<P>
The Pico Rivera woman, a 62-year-old who had met Gall at a senior citizens' 
dance, said he had apparently made an extra set of keys to her house when she 
asked him to take her car to a garage for servicing. It wasn't until police 
told her they had found her stocks that she realized they were missing, she 
said. She kept them in a file cabinet in her spare room, she said, and Gall -- 
whom she knew by the alias George Perkins -- had apparently let himself into 
her house while she was out and had taken the papers from her files. 
</P>
<P>
Gall, in a statement to a probation officer -- and in interviews with The Times 
-- denied stealing the stocks and claimed that the woman had asked him to keep 
them for "safekeeping." 
</P>
<P>
But Judge Robert W. Armstrong called Gall's explanation "a rather foolish 
posture" and chided him for his "apparent complete lack of contrition." 
</P>
<P>
He also noted that when Gall was caught, he was carrying a Thomas Bros. map 
book with every senior center in the area highlighted in colored ink. The map, 
Armstrong said, "indicated his ongoing plan to prey on elderly victims." 
</P>
<P>
However, the judge stopped short of giving Gall the maximum four-year sentence 
because the certificates were recovered. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thrilled to death with what he got," the Pico Rivera woman said. She said 
a friend called her at her work to tell her about the judge's decision, "and I 
just let out a big whoop, right there in the office. I said, 'Oh, thank God, 
I've been vindicated.' " 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Redondo Beach woman -- who disagrees with police speculation 
that Gall was planning to steal from her too -- said she was disappointed at 
the severity of the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"Three years is better than four," she said, "but I feel that at this point he 
has turned his life around, and three years to me seems like a long time. I 
feel sorry for women who have lost through him, but he was nothing but kind to 
me."

BLIND YOUTHS TRY SURFING, FIND IT'S COOL; 
</P>
<P>
RECREATION: MEMBERS OF A BRAILLE INSTITUTE OUTING OVERCOME FEAR IN A DAY OF 
CATCHING WAVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
After spending most of Thursday morning surfing off Malibu Beach, 13-year-old 
Monica Vasquez decided it was time to change her name to something that more 
aptly described her new-found talent. 
</P>
<P>
"Just call me Ms. Surfer," the blind teen-ager said Thursday after surfing for 
the first time in her life. "I was born on the surfboard." 
</P>
<P>
Well, maybe she wasn't born on a surfboard. But beach-goers who watched Vasquez 
and her 14 pals from the Braille Institute Youth Center of Los Angeles can 
attest that some of the young students can ride the waves with the best of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The youths, who ranged in age from 5 to 16 and came from across Los Angeles 
County, were invited to the beach as part of the fifth annual special outing 
for students and staff of the institute sponsored by Paradise Surfing, a local 
surfing school. 
</P>
<P>
Along with eight staffers from the institute, two volunteers and the staff of 
Paradise Surfing, the group of mostly anxious youths learned the basics of 
surfing. 
</P>
<P>
After a brief morning orientation, during which the instructors and their 
students became acquainted with one another, the group took to the water. 
</P>
<P>
With a surfing instructor and an institute staffer on each side, the students 
learned to work the board in the shallows, said Ted Silverberg, founder of 
Paradise Surfing. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez came to the beach Thursday with the three essentials: a swimsuit, 
sunscreen and an adventurous spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Although she floundered frequently, Vasquez remained undaunted as she was 
taught the new sport. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone should learn to surf. It's thrilling and fun," she said. "I'm going 
to teach my parents . . . although I know they will be too scared to learn. 
</P>
<P>
"And they can see!" 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the students were as daring as Vasquez was Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
A sobbing 5-year-old refused to set foot near the water and spent most of the 
day playing on the sand. 
</P>
<P>
But then there were others, like Damin Bordenave, 13, who were raring to go. 
</P>
<P>
"Surfing's great," said Bordenave, who has surfed in the program for the last 
five years. "I think I am the best surfer here. But that's only my opinion, of 
course." 
</P>
<P>
But even the cocky Bordenave admitted to being scared the first time he went 
out. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really scary the first year I went," he said. "I felt like I was going 
to go underwater. But you get over your fears and start to have fun." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday he surfed like a pro -- standing on the board at times while deftly 
maneuvering it with his arms and legs as he rode the small waves. 
</P>
<P>
"I only got wiped out once," he said after he had finished. "I am ready to go 
out again." 
</P>
<P>
While the exploits of the blind surfers captured the attention of some of the 
regular wave riders, these students are no strangers to high-risk adventures. 
Before the summer ends, the group will also have gone water skiing, rock 
climbing and camping in the mountains, said Gary Jimenez, assistant youth 
coordinator at the institute. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to mainstream them into the community," he said. "They do things that 
other sighted kids do and even more." 
</P>
<P>
Anita Wright, youth coordinator at the institute, added that Thursday's fun 
also had a serious purpose. 
</P>
<P>
"The day gives them a sense of accomplishment. They realize just because they 
are blind does not mean they can't achieve things," she said. "It exposes them 
to things they would normally not have an opportunity to do."

PATRIOTISM: MARCHES, ODES, SWEET ADELINES AND A EUPHONIUM SOLO CONTRIBUTE TO 
THE SPIRIT OF THE FOURTH THIS WEEK.

<TEXT>
<P>
Sousa marches and patriotic medleys are as requisite to a Fourth of July pops 
program as potato salad and cold fried chicken are to the traditional holiday 
picnic. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night at Hospitality Point, guest conductor Carl Hermanns and the San 
Diego Symphony pops orchestra did not flout tradition: The unmistakable martial 
cadences of Sousa surrounded a parade of flag-waving odes, ably assisted by the 
120 massed voices of San Diego's Sweet Adelines vocal ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
For those ears too jaded to respond to Sousa's "El Capitan" and "Washington 
Post" marches or to the time-worn Peter J. Wilhousky arrangement of the "Battle 
Hymn of the Republic," Hermanns programmed Aaron Copland's "Lincoln Portrait" 
and Herbert L. Clarke's "Bride of the Waves," transcribed for euphonium. 
</P>
<P>
In his usual chatty way, Hermanns described the euphonium as a kind of "baby 
tuba." 
</P>
<P>
Although the "Lincoln Portrait" is not exactly obscure, it is no pops staple. 
</P>
<P>
From the subdued opening to its brassy finale, Hermanns pressed the piece 
forward with a steady hand, and the players responded with their cleanest 
playing of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's narrator for the 3,167 concert-goers was City Councilman Bruce 
Henderson, who earnestly intoned the bold, awkwardly chiseled words of Abraham 
Lincoln expounding the need for national resolve to eradicate the evils of 
slavery. 
</P>
<P>
This aptly nationalistic program runs through Saturday, and, each evening, a 
different local politician assumes the narrator's role. 
</P>
<P>
Heather Buchman, the orchestra's principal trombone, performed the euphonium 
solo in "Bride of the Waves," a novel idea that no doubt looked better on paper 
than it sounded in concert. 
</P>
<P>
Although Buchman coaxed a sweet, mellow sound from the valved instrument that 
gently gurgles in the tenor range, she could not make it spring through the 
agile figuration of the piece, which was of course intended for the cornet, 
Clarke's own instrument. 
</P>
<P>
Coupled with the conductor's difficulty in keeping soloist and orchestra 
together through the quick transitions of this variation cycle, the quaint 
period piece fizzled like a damp firecracker. 
</P>
<P>
Director Kim Hulbert's energetic Sweet Adelines sounded best in their 
unaccompanied songs, especially a snappy arrangement of Cy Coleman and Michael 
Stewart's upbeat "Come Follow the Band." 
</P>
<P>
Although the well-disciplined chorus projected the characteristic sonority of 
women's barbershop harmony -- an intensely bright and shallow sound -- this 
writer agrees with the wag who labeled it "cruel and not sufficiently unusual 
punishment."

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: STAGE: NEA CONTROVERSY CALLS FOR ACTION ON PATRONS' PART

Four artists whose work has stirred the controversy surrounding the National 
Endowment for the Arts are no strangers to San Diego audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, embattled NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer barred grants to the 
four, despite a recommendation for funding by an NEA panel. 
</P>
<P>
The rejection should come as a shock to those lucky enough to have seen John 
Fleck's comic performance as "The Granny" at the Old Globe Theatre in January. 
Or to those who savored the work of Karen Finley, Holly Hughes and Tim Miller 
at Sushi Performance Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Just how obscene did San Diego audiences think these artists were? The San 
Diego Critics Circle nominated Finley, a fiery and passionate performer, for 
its Best Actress Award, and Fleck received critical accolades for a virtuoso 
performance in the Old Globe's popular "Granny." 
</P>
<P>
Finley and Hughes also drew the largest audiences Sushi has ever had, said its 
managing director, Vicki Wolf. Sushi has already booked Hughes for December and 
plans to invite Finley to appear in April. Wolf said Sushi, which receives 
$15,000 in NEA money, will not use any of that money to underwrite these 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported that, according to sources familiar with the situation, 
pressure to reject these artists came from the White House and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
It's amazing that the White House and Congress have nothing better to do than 
expend all their efforts in keeping a couple of thousand dollars from going 
into the hands of four nationally recognized artists. And why? No one is saying 
exactly, but, according to the sources, Miller got into trouble because he 
attached a personal statement with his NEA application criticizing Sen. Jesse 
Helms (R-N.C.), saying: "Look here, Sen. Jesse Helms, keep your Porky Pig face 
out of the NEA." 
</P>
<P>
Crude, granted. But don't we have a First Amendment anymore? Or has it been 
amended like the commandments in "Animal Farm" to read that Americans can say 
whatever they like as long as it isn't critical of Jesse Helms? 
</P>
<P>
Hughes deals with lesbian subjects. Miller writes about gays. Finley is a 
feminist artist who, at one point in her performance, strips and smears her 
body with chocolate and alfalfa sprouts to make a point about women's bodies 
being treated as objects. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the real concern here is not whether these individuals get a few dollars 
from the NEA. The fear is, considering the political clout of those against 
them, whether they will get jobs in the future. Will today's NEA shutout build 
the blacklist of tomorrow? 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we are more enlightened than that," said Thomas Hall, managing director 
of the Old Globe. "John (Fleck) is a consummate artist. There's no doubt that 
John's work here at the Globe and as a performance artist has artistic merit 
and deserved to be given every consideration." 
</P>
<P>
But these are the times that try enlightened souls. Will someone try to cut off 
NEA funds to companies planning to hire Fleck, Hughes, Miller or Finley? Will 
any company in this witch-hunting climate be willing to take that risk? 
</P>
<P>
The list of NEA recipients who are rejecting their grants grows daily. These 
artists and organizations don't want to be restricted in subject matter, style 
or content by what politicians tell the NEA is "obscene." 
</P>
<P>
In coming months, San Diego's leading theaters, the Old Globe, the La Jolla 
Playhouse and the San Diego Repertory Theatre, along with other arts 
organizations here and across the nation, will have to decide whether to accept 
or reject NEA money. 
</P>
<P>
Most nonprofit arts organizations came into being because of NEA money. They 
need it desperately. But how far should they be willing to compromise to get 
it? 
</P>
<P>
Wolf said Sushi will accept its money because "we don't believe we do anything 
obscene or pornographic. To not accept it would be exactly what the people 
fighting against us want us to do. It's giving in." 
</P>
<P>
The tightly organized group railing against obscenity in the arts is becoming 
drunk with its own power. The protesters are winning, and their trophy will be 
either the NEA or its soul, because if the NEA lets Helms decide what is or 
isn't art, or who can or can't be hired, then the organization will become 
little more than a pimp for a few powerful politicians and the special-interest 
groups that pull their strings. 
</P>
<P>
Art has never needed its friends more than now. Everyone who cares about the 
symphony, the ballet, the theater and freedom of expression should make his or 
her voice heard, whether it's writing their legislators or organizing to 
counter the attack. 
</P>
<P>
The NEA helped build the regional arts movement in this country. It improved 
quality here, and arts patrons no longer need to catch a flight to New York for 
an occasional culture fix. It deserves the support of the public -- but, as the 
arts benefactor it was meant to be, not as a vehicle for censorship. 
</P>
<P>
What the NEA has helped do for everyday life in America's finest cities has 
been incalculable. Now it's time to return some of that help to the NEA. 
</P>

PROGRAM NOTES: The La Jolla Playhouse crisis campaign, which had a $1-million 
fund-raising goal to be met by June 30, raised $700,000 by that date. The 
campaign will continue through October. The 1990 season, which began 
auspiciously with a 101% attendance for "The Cherry Orchard" (the extra 
percentage point means standing room only), is secure, said managing director 
Alan Levey. Subscription sales have risen to an all-time high of 9,018, with a 
68% renewal rate. And the deficit, which was $703,000, dropped to $633,000 as 
of Oct. 31, 1989, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Levey also predicts that fund raising will get easier as the season continues 
and patrons can see the work they are supporting. "The Cherry Orchard" 
attendance figures are second only to the playhouse production of Lee 
Blessing's "A Walk in the Woods," which saw 109%. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Del Mar Theatre Ensemble, a children's theater company that is opening its 
production of "Scapan" on Saturday, is desperately looking for a permanent 
home. Directed by Tony-winning William Ball, the company is working outside in 
the Del Mar Plaza at 1555 Camino Del Mar. Artistic director Bonnie Tarwater is 
hosting a fund-raising family dinner reception featuring Batman, Superman, 
Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland and the Teenage Ninja Mutant Turtles at 2 p.m. 
Saturday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Repertory Theatre is extending "Latins Anonymous" through July 
15. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Underground at the Lyceum continues with "Moment to Moment" today and Saturday. 
The Ensemble Arts Theatre's "V*V*N" (for Vaudeville Viet Nam), an original 
work, will show at 10:30 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays from July 13-28. . . . 
</P>
<P>
A reading of Judy Montague's "The Zhabotinsky Reactions," a story of modern 
gene engineering directed by San Diego Rep artistic director Douglas Jacobs, 
will be given at Words &amp; Music Bookstore at 7 p.m. July 11, and at 8 p.m. 
July 23 at the Lyceum Space.

ENCORE: New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, who'll pay the Angels 
$200,000 for interfering in their negotiations with ex-Yankee Dave Winfield 
(C1), has left his tracks in Anaheim before. . . . In November, 1979, he was 
fined $5,000 for "tampering" with the Angels' free agent Brian Downing (above). 
. . . Against league rules, Steinbrenner said publicly that he wanted to sign 
Downing. Little wonder: that season, Downing hit .326, league tops among

HOSPITAL CITES NURSE ERROR IN PATIENT DEATH

A Garden Grove woman suffering from advanced breast cancer died last November 
after a nurse at FHP Hospital in Fountain Valley grabbed the wrong medication 
from a shelf and mistakenly administered a lethal dose of potassium chloride, 
FHP officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"This was an egregious error on the part of the nurse and an inexcusable lapse 
in judgment," FHP said in a written statement, adding that the nurse was 
suspended immediately and fired a week later "as a result of her mistake." 
</P>
<P>
On that same date, Nov. 21, 1989, FHP said that it notified the California 
Board of Registered Nurses of "the termination and the medication error." 
</P>
<P>
The nurse, Maureen Daubert, could not be located Thursday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Francis J. Johnson, 74, died on Nov. 14, 1989, one day after paramedics brought 
her to FHP in what a hospital official described as a "semi-comatose" 
condition. Johnson, according to FHP, "was an end-stage victim of cancer who . 
. . was expected to die within a short period of time." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Gary E. Goldstein, a regional vice president for the health maintenance 
organization, said that Johnson had "perked up" the morning of Nov. 14. But by 
that afternoon, Goldstein said in an interview, Johnson's condition was listed 
as "extremely poor" and her doctor prescribed the diuretic Lasix to maintain 
her blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Nurse Daubert, Goldstein said, walked to the shelf where medication is kept 
and, instead of removing Lasix, mistakenly grabbed "KCl" -- the chemical 
abbreviation for potassium chloride. 
</P>
<P>
"The (doctor's) order was written for Lasix," Goldstein said. "The error is 
such that we viewed it as totally accidental -- an extreme medication error. A 
one-time event." 
</P>
<P>
Goldstein said that as soon as Daubert realized her error, she and others tried 
immediately but unsuccessfully to revive Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to firing Daubert, Goldstein said the hospital also has relocated 
the potassium chloride to prevent the mistake from happening again because of 
the alphabetical proximity. Goldstein said FHP will continue to investigate the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
The statements by FHP officials came on the same day that the Orange County 
coroner's office formally amended Johnson's death certificate to "acute 
potassium intoxication." The original certificate, signed by Dr. Sabry Fahmy 
Ghaly, attributed the death to Johnson's "metastatic breast cancer." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators began looking into the woman's death last month after state 
officials were contacted by an FHP employee, Fountain Valley Police 
Investigator Steve Williams said. When deaths occur because of unnatural 
causes, California law requires hospitals to notify local coroners so that 
autopsies may be performed. 
</P>
<P>
In its statement on Thursday, FHP said its ongoing "internal review" has found 
it "difficult to determine Mrs. Johnson's exact cause of death because any one 
of several acute problems could have been at fault, including septic shock, 
massive heart failure, and terminal cancer beyond treatment." 
</P>
<P>
As to the issue of FHP not reporting Johnson's death to the coroner for 
possible autopsy, Goldstein said there was no effort to hide the mistaken dose 
of potassium chloride. Based on his and an FHP lawyer's questioning of four 
doctors and four nurses involved, Goldstein said that Johnson's grave condition 
because of cancer weighed heavily. 
</P>
<P>
"The universal feeling was, the death seemed so obvious to us (because of 
Johnson's cancer and its complications) it never crossed their minds to make it 
a coroner's case. Half said, 'Gee, maybe we should have.' And half said, 'Gee, 
I don't know. . . .' It didn't cross their mind, unfortunately." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Lyle, a supervising deputy coroner, said that Johnson's death certificate 
was amended Thursday to reflect what his office believes to be the woman's true 
cause of death. Asked if FHP officials should have reported Johnson's death for 
a possible autopsy by the coroner's office last November, Lyle said: 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely. It would have been autopsied at that time. . . . We can't do 
anything until the case has been reported to us." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ghaly, who signed the original death certificate attributing Johnson's 
death to her metastatic, or spreading, breast cancer, declined to be 
interviewed and referred a reporter to FHP's public information office. 
Goldstein said that contacting the coroner's office is usually the 
responsibility of FHP's nursing staff. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who is survived by her husband and three children, died on Nov. 14 at 
5:50 p.m. -- 40 minutes after nurse Daubert administered the potassium, 
according to Lyle, the deputy coroner. 
</P>
<P>
Based on a review of hospital records and interviews conducted by state medical 
investigators, Lyle said, the coroner's office determined that Johnson's death 
was "accidental." 
</P>
<P>
Garry Garcia, a son of Johnson, said Thursday that he was puzzled about how his 
mother died and the handling of the original death certificate. Garcia said his 
family did not learn of the mistaken potassium dosage until a coroner's 
official called June 4. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about that, the FHP's Goldstein said, "I don't know for sure what was 
said or what wasn't said." 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley Police Sgt. Williams said the circumstances surrounding 
Johnson's death, including the hospital's failure to notify the coroner of the 
potassium overdose, remain under investigation. Williams said he plans to 
present his findings to the district attorney's office later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Daubert remains under scrutiny from the California Board of 
Registered Nursing, according to Susan Brank, the board's assistant executive 
officer. Brank said that the board, which controls the licensing of nurses, has 
been examining Daubert since January. 
</P>
<P>
But Brank said that, contrary to earlier, erroneous statements by police, 
Daubert's license has not been revoked and has been in good standing since she 
began working in California in September, 1981. Brank declined to say what the 
board has learned during its five months of investigation or what prompted the 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
FHP said its notification to the board last November started the investigation 
and that FHP doctors and nurses "have cooperated fully." 
</P>
<P>
According to officials with Fountain Valley police and the coroner's office, 
Daubert had been questioned as of Thursday by only the state nursing board. 
Investigators say they believe she has moved out of state. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Thomas A. Raffin, chief of respiratory medicine at the Stanford University 
School of Medicine, said that an infusion of potassium would typically follow a 
treatment with Lasix because the diruetic flushes the body of a number of 
nutrients and minerals. 
</P>
<P>
"If the level of potassium in the blood falls, it can cause the heart to have a 
bad rhythm, which can result in death," said Raffin. On the other hand, Raffin 
said, a hyper-elevated level of potassium can stop the heart, also causing 
death. 
</P>
<P>
In Johnson's case, the administering of potassium before, instead of after, the 
Lasix, proved deadly. Deputy Coroner Lyle said that Johnson's amended 
certificate of death lists the cause as "cardiac arrhythmia due to hyper 
kalemia." In lay terms, Lyle said, "it means too much potassium in the blood 
system."

OPEN SPACE BOND VOTE GIVEN UP; 
</P>
<P>
LAGUNA CANYON: BASED ON A POLL OF 700 COUNTY RESIDENTS, OFFICIALS HAVE 
ABANDONED HOPE THAT THE ISSUE COULD CARRY. IT WAS AIMED TO PROTECT KEY AREAS 
FROM DEVELOPMENT BY THE IRVINE CO.

Citing insufficient public support for the idea, county officials have given up 
any hope of winning a November open-space bond referendum that proponents had 
hoped might save Laguna Canyon from development, according to a report made 
public Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But while the county is abandoning prospects for a November vote, 
representatives of Laguna Beach and the Irvine Co., which plans to build homes 
around the canyon, are discussing ways to reconfigure the company's proposal to 
save the most environmentally sensitive areas. 
</P>
<P>
The company has long planned to build 3,200 homes on the 2,100-acre property, 
but the report said company officials "have expressed some willingness to 
consider" modifying their original development plan. An amended option could 
involve fewer homes and might concentrate them near adjacent Leisure World, 
away from the most sensitive areas of the canyon and its watershed, said Robert 
G. Fisher, county director of harbors, beaches and parks. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials confirmed that they are willing to consider such a proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"We are indeed willing to explore options and talk about project 
modifications," said Dawn McCormick, a spokeswoman for the company. "That 
discussion is going on, and it's been encouraging." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Ruane, county Environmental Management Agency director, agreed that 
talks have been productive and said county officials would favor a scaled-back 
plan that would not increase traffic around Leisure World. 
</P>
<P>
A group of local officials, company representatives and area environmentalists 
has been meeting for months in an effort to hammer out a deal that would 
satisfy all sides of the emotional canyon debate. If no agreement can be 
reached, or if residents reject whatever bond measure eventually emerges from 
the talks, the company intends to go ahead with its development plans. 
</P>
<P>
Most participants had originally placed their greatest hope in a countywide 
bond measure. But the county report released Thursday seems to close off that 
option. 
</P>
<P>
The report, written by officials in the EMA, notes that a recent poll of 700 
county residents found strong support for environmental issues but also 
indicated that residents' willingness to tax themselves for open-space 
acquisition fell considerably short of the levels needed to pass a bond. 
</P>
<P>
"The two-thirds majority vote required to approve tax and bond measures does 
not appear likely based on this survey," said the report, which members of the 
Board of Supervisors will receive Tuesday. "Furthermore, these results indicate 
that joining a bond measure for open space with a sales tax for transportation 
would work to the detriment of both proposals." 
</P>
<P>
The report also notes, however, that public support may be strong enough to 
carry a more modest local bond issue. The June survey, conducted by a 
Sacramento-based political pollster, found strong support among Laguna Beach 
residents for a bond that would raise taxes by $100 a year for every city 
property owner. 
</P>
<P>
Even at that level of taxation, a Laguna Beach bond measure could not be 
expected to raise enough money to buy the entire proposed site -- valued at 
more than $70 million. The local measure could probably raise about $10 
million, Fisher said, but canyon preservationists hope to stretch that money by 
soliciting donations from private industry, the state and the county. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a matter of pulling it from here and there," Fisher said.

Dear Ms. Klein: 
</P>
<P>
Freaks? Weirdos? Really, Ms. Klein, cyclists are humans, too. By the way, tell 
your husband that I highly recommend the 'Lady Remington.' It provides a close 
shave without any unnecessary bloodshed.

Dear Mr. Benner: 
</P>
<P>
 How long have you been in Orange County, Mike? Here, no one bats an eye at 
freaks and weirdos passing themselves off as humans. The human angle, in fact, 
seems to play big with the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps you think I was a bit hasty in describing my husband and his fellow 
bicycling enthusiasts in the same vein. I can understand that. It would bother 
me, too. Still, my husband seems to delight in being different. How else to 
describe this shaved-legs ritual? 
</P>
<P>
 But, heck, Mike, to give you an idea of how open-minded I am about alternative 
lifestyles, I want you to know I passed on your Lady Remington suggestion to my 
husband. He even bought one. Right about now, Mike, I'm thinking unnecessary 
bloodshed might not be such a bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Mrs. Klein: 
</P>
<P>
I have been enjoying your comments very much. Yesterday, you got over into my 
territory. You realize that each of those cows you wrote about has four 
stomachs? Never in my 92 years have I found a magnet in any of them. Nails, 
yes. Barbed wire and magnets, no. Autopsies on bovines expiring from hardware 
disease have revealed nails, baling wire and other miscellany, but no magnets. 
The foreign objects always punctured the stomach well before making it through

Dear Mr. Justus: 
</P>
<P>
 Lord knows I wouldn't presume to argue with your 92 years or the cows in your 
territory. (I, for example, have never been present at a bovine autopsy, 
although it's been on my 'Things to Do' list for years.) 
</P>
<P>
 However, with all due respect, let me point out that if you had found a magnet 
in your cows' stomachs, you might have found any 'nails, baling wire and other 
miscellany' all in one place. You see, farmers these days actually encourage 
their cows to swallow magnets and even go as far as to purchase magnets for 
their cows' enjoyment. The metal particles cling to the magnets, thereby 
greatly reducing the heartbreak of hardware disease. 
</P>
<P>
 I suppose one regrettable side effect of this technology would be a reduction 
in the number of bovine autopsies that one gets to attend. But as I'm sure you 
are aware, life is full of such trade-offs. 
</P>
<P>
 Did you know, for example, that barbed wire may soon be replaced by invisible 
electronic fences that encourage animals not to wander by giving them a mild 
jolt? Just think what that could do to your bikini line. 
</P>
<P>
 Dearest Dianne: 
</P>
<P>
Once again, I am caught reading an article of yours that is as poor as your 
knowledge of the subject/subjects. 
</P>
<P>
Your June 20 article makes reference to the totally unfounded and ludicrous 
suggestion that charities in Orange County are hard-pressed due to the 'never 
too loose with our change' mentality. You better get your facts in line to 
support that allegation. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Well, Dianne, we can't give to everything. It's that simple. I ask you -- have 
you honestly given to each and every charity that has ever approached you on 
the street, at your door, in your place of employment, etc., etc., etc.? If 
not, than you have absolutely no right to print such a ridiculous suggestion. 
Why should YOU bite the hand that feeds so many needy organizations around this 
county? . . . 
</P>
<P>
Sincerely, 
</P>
<P>
Mary Ellen Adams, 
</P>
<P>
Orange County resident, volunteer and charity contributor 
</P>

</P>
<P>
Dearest Mary Ellen, 
</P>
<P>
So nice to hear from you again. But you have me a little concerned. It's not 
like you to admit to being 'caught reading an article' of mine. Since you have 
been that honest with me, however, I'll repay your kindness. Here are some 
statistics that you may find enlightening. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County has one of the lowest rates of charitable-giving per capita, 
about 40% less than the rest of the nation. This is according to George 
Phillips, the United Way's vice president of community issues. According to 
other studies -- including the 1989 Orange County Annual Survey -- only about 
30% of county residents make any charitable contributions, while the rate 
nationwide is over 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 And, Mary Ellen, you are right. We can't give to everything. I can't. But 
maybe you're different. You certainly do seem to have a lot to share. With me, 
at least. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dear Dianne: 
</P>
<P>
I can't express completely the gratitude I felt when you called yourself a 
feminist in your May 16 column. It's time that women who espouse feminist 
values begin to come out of the closet and use the 'F' word when describing 
themselves. I believe the same mind set which made "liberal" a dirty word is 
also at work with the word 'feminism.' 
</P>
<P>
Go down the line with all the issues which have come to light because of 
hard-working feminists: from obtaining female suffrage to working for equal pay 
and access to higher education and better jobs. Only the most confirmed 
patriarchs will deny these changes have worked for the good of all. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I wish I didn't have to say I'm 'grateful' for your admission. Perhaps if more 
women and men would stand up and be counted, feminism would cease to be a 
stigma and instead become a badge of honor. 
</P>
<P>
Sincerely, 
</P>
<P>

Dear Valerie, 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks for your letter. This ought to make you feel even better. I AM A 
FEMINIST! Not that anyone who reads this column regularly ever had any doubts. 
I'm not much for hiding in closets.

JUDGE: CONTRITE BOY IS A THREAT; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: HE REFUSES PARENTS' PLEA TO RELEASE 14-YEAR-OLD RICHARD HUBLER, CITING 
EARLIER GUN OFFENSE. DEFENSE SAYS THE 'REMORSEFUL' BOY LOVED THE SISTER HE'S 
ACCUSED OF KILLING.

Richard Hubler aimed a gun at his sister's head and pulled the trigger. Nothing 
happened. Then he tried again and shot her in the head, the prosecutor alleged 
Thursday as he argued that Hubler should not be released to his parents. 
</P>
<P>
But at a hearing attended by Hubler's mother and father, Deputy Public Defender 
Sharon Petrosino said the shooting was a tragic accident. She pleaded with the 
judge to allow the boy to go home while he awaits trial on a charge of 
murdering 12-year-old Gema Marie Hubler at the family home on June 14. 
</P>
<P>
Judge C. Robert Jameson agreed with the prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Brent F. 
Romney, and ordered that the 14-year-old eighth-grader remain in custody. 
Jameson said that because of earlier offenses involving guns, he believed that 
the youth could pose a danger to others. 
</P>
<P>
Hubler, now under suicide watch at Orange County Juvenile Hall, pleaded not 
guilty to one count of murder. 
</P>
<P>
Romney told the judge there is evidence that the youth was not on good terms 
with his sister and that, on the day of the killing, he feared that she was 
going to tell their parents that he had a gun. 
</P>
<P>
But Petrosino said outside the courtroom that Hubler "loved his sister. . . . 
He's emotionally upset and very remorseful. My client had an interest in guns. 
But he was not interested in killing his sister." She said the boy insists that 
he did not know the sawed-off .22-caliber rifle was loaded when he pointed it 
at his sister. 
</P>
<P>
She argued that his parents are very distraught over what happened but that 
they believe that the shooting was an accident and want their son home with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
But Romney argued that Hubler's background proves he is dangerous. He alleged 
that just four days before the killing, Hubler's parents took a .38-caliber 
revolver away from him and hid it in the garage. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the fatal shooting, Hubler was on probation for shooting a 
neighbor in the back with a BB gun in 1988. After that incident, he was found 
to have a stolen .357 magnum pistol. 
</P>
<P>
Possessing guns was a violation of Hubler's probation. 
</P>
<P>
His parents, James and Marie Hubler, two brothers, a grandmother and an aunt 
from Spain and 12 of the youth's friends attended Thursday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
When the friends walked into the courtroom, a bailiff ordered them out, saying 
he was concerned about maintaining security. James Hubler then got into an 
angry exchange with the bailiff, asking if reporters also would be asked to 
leave. Later, the judge allowed the young people back in the courtroom to watch 
the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
"The family is very distraught," Petrosino said after the hearing. "They lost a 
daughter, and now they feel they are losing a son to a system that doesn't 
believe him." 
</P>
<P>
"They know the sister and brother didn't have any problems," Petrosino added. 
</P>
<P>
The defense attorney argued that there is no evidence to support a murder 
charge and that the youth is being prosecuted only because of his record of 
weapons violations. 
</P>
<P>
She compared his case to another recent juvenile shooting in which no criminal 
charges have been filed. On May 24, Christian Wiedepuhl, 17, was fatally shot 
in the head in an Anaheim home by a teen-age classmate. 
</P>
<P>
On June 19, Judge Jameson denied Hubler permission to attend his sister's 
funeral. However, last week, Hubler and his family received permission to say a 
rosary for his sister at Juvenile Hall, Petrosino said. 
</P>
<P>
Gema Marie, who was described as a bright, friendly sixth-grader, was shot in 
the upstairs bedroom of the family's Anaheim Shores home around 12:30 p.m. on 
June 14. When authorities arrived, they found her covered with a blanket and 
her head wrapped in bandages. 
</P>
<P>
She underwent surgery at UCI Medical Center in Orange for the single gunshot 
wound but remained in a coma until she died June 18. 
</P>
<P>
While she was still comatose, Hubler wrote her a letter and asked family 
members to read it to her in the hospital, Petrosino disclosed. He now carries 
her photograph and funeral holy card with him at all times, the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the boy told police that his sister was shot by three armed robbers 
who broke into the house and fled. 
</P>
<P>
But Anaheim police said that they found many inconsistencies in his story and 
that their investigation led them to believe that Hubler concocted the story 
and that he was responsible for the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Hubler is scheduled to appear again in Juvenile Court next Thursday for a 
pretrial hearing.

A MOTHER'S WORK: LEGAL FIGHT TO CARE FOR INFANT AT OFFICE 
</P>

Phones ring. File drawers slam shut. People move from one desk to another -- 
conferring, taking notes, consulting legal documents. 
</P>
<P>
In most ways, the office of the Women's Law Center, on the ninth floor of a 
posh office building here, is like any other law office. But in a sunny corner 
room there is a difference. 
</P>
<P>
There, two contented-looking babies snooze in portable baby cribs. Nearby, amid 
the law books and files, are neat arrangements of baby bottles. A teddy bear 
with a smile on its face sits on a book cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
The tranquil scene belies the battle being fought over the babies' quarters. 
The building's landlord has charged that having the babies in the office 
constitutes a "nursery" and breaks the lease. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't a nursery," said Diane J.Marlowe, an attorney who heads the Women's 
Law Center. "It's a working part of the office, and it's just a place where my 
baby sleeps, and where the baby of my paralegal also has a crib. But we're 
being accused of operating a nursery and being in breach of our lease by being 
'unprofessional.' " 
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically, the Women's Law Center is a private law firm that specializes in 
cases affecting mothers, such as divorce and child support. 
</P>
<P>
Marlowe, 38, and her husband, Richard C. Gilbert, 39, a lawyer who also 
operates his law firm out of the joint office, received a notice last month 
from their landlord, the Tishman West Management Corp. of Orange. The letter 
said that Marlowe's and Gilbert's office lease was "for the sole purpose of a 
law practice and for no other purpose." 
</P>
<P>
The letter added: "It is requested that you cease and desist using the 
aforementioned offices as a nursery." 
</P>
<P>
In response, Marlowe on Monday filed suit in Orange County Superior Court. "I'm 
afraid they might try to evict us, and so I want the court to give me a 
declaration of my rights," Marlowe said. 
</P>
<P>
The legal dispute is attracting widespread attention because it centers on 
major issues in the state -- child care and working mothers. "I'm getting all 
kinds of calls on this from other people who are interested," Marlowe said. She 
added that she hopes her suit will strike a blow for working mothers throughout 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
Gary D. Mull, building manager for Tishman West Management Corp., on Thursday 
said that the company is consulting with its legal department and has no 
additional comment on the case. Earlier, however, Mull had said that while 
there had not been any complaints about noise, some other executive suite 
tenants had complained that a baby's presence in the office compromised the 
professional atmosphere in the executive suites. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to remember that the nature of executive suites means that they 
share many items in common," such as the reception area, Mull said. He noted 
that Marlowe's and Gilbert's lease has a section addressing "professional 
conduct" that allows termination of a lease if "more than 50% of the co-tenants 
feel that (the conduct in question) reflects unfavorably on them or the suite." 
</P>
<P>
Mull said enforcement of the lease does not mean the landlord is unsympathetic. 
"Tishman West is not trying to take an anti-child or anti-infant or anti-day 
care stand," he said. "But we have had complaints." 
</P>
<P>
Marlowe on Thursday said she wonders where the complaints may be coming from. 
"No one has said anything to us about the babies," she said. "In fact, we've 
gotten a lot of support and encouragement from people in the other offices. 
There certainly has never been a complaint about noise." 
</P>
<P>
The room where the two babies are kept does not share a common wall with any 
other executive office in the 10-story building at 505 City Parkway West, 
adjacent to The City Shopping Center. 
</P>
<P>
Marlowe's and Gilbert's 2-month-old daughter, Jennifer, has one portable crib. 
Mason Hensley, 1 month old, has the second crib. 
</P>
<P>
Mason is the son of Tina Hensley, 24, of La Verne, a paralegal in the Women's 
Law Center. "It's wonderful that I can bring my son here every day," Hensley 
said. "I wouldn't be able to work otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
As the business day wore on Thursday, baby Jennifer and baby Mason occasionally 
awakened. Their mothers picked them up, fed them and sometimes carried them 
around for a while until the babies fell back to sleep. In the meantime, both 
women busily went about their office work, answering phones, checking files and 
consulting on cases. 
</P>
<P>
As Marlowe was holding her infant, the baby gave a wide smile. "Look at that 
smile!" Marlowe said. "Do you realize what I'd be missing if she were not with 
me? Day care is not an option for me, I can tell you that." 
</P>
<P>
Marlowe and Gilbert, who have been married 19 years, have another child, 
Jeremy, 6, who is in day school. Marlowe said that when Jeremy was a baby, she 
temporarily worked out of the couple's home in Mission Viejo "because my law 
practice was a lot smaller then." 
</P>
<P>
But now, Marlowe added, her work demands a bigger office -- the one she and 
Gilbert have leased in Orange for the past 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
In her lawsuit, Marlowe said that Tishman West "knew or should have known" that 
children have been in and out of her executive office for the past 11 years. 
Marlowe said that the Women's Law Center "represents women and their children 
in court concerning custody and divorce cases and other types of cases that are 
of interest to women and their children. The average fee charged to these 
clients is generally less than one half of what a reasonable legal fee would 
be." 
</P>
<P>
"Many of these clients are unable to afford day care, and therefore it is 
necessary for these clients to bring their children with them to the law 
office," the lawsuit states. "It is therefore common and usual for babies and 
children to be at the offices of Diane J. Marlowe every day and for most of the 
day." 
</P>
<P>
Marlowe said in an interview Thursday that her suit may plow some new legal 
ground about women's rights to bring a baby to work. Marlowe noted that other 
working mothers, including movie-television actress Lynn Redgrave, in recent 
years have been rebuffed when trying to bring their infants to their working 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Redgrave in December, 1987, testified before a state Senate committee in 
Sacramento in support of "the right (of working mothers) to hold down a job and 
keep our children near us, where they belong." That same Senate committee, 
while cool to Redgrave's plea, acknowledged that California has a severe 
shortage of day care for children -- with about 900,000 low-income working 
mothers unable to find care for their youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
Marlowe said that caring for children, paired with a mother's right to be with 
her child, are twin issues involved in her current legal dispute. "Just because 
a woman works doesn't mean she should have to give up her child," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Hensley, her paralegal, as they viewed their two sleeping babies on 
Thursday: "Things have changed. People are just going to have to get used to 
it."

Marlowe finds herself locked in a potential landmark case over whether babies 
have a place in the office. Her landlord charges that keeping babies in the

A 50-year-old Cypress man was cited Thursday for possession of fighting cocks 
after a police officer discovered about 40 individually caged roosters which 
had been altered for combat, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Also discovered in the man's front and rear yards in the 8300 block of Denni 
Street were about 20 breeding hens and 100 chicks, Lt. John Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
Demosthenes Ariosa was issued a misdemeanor citation and ordered to appear in 
Municipal Court in Westminster on Aug. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Police were called to the Ariosa residence at about 1:15 p.m. after a neighbor 
complained that Ariosa had been shooting at a dog that was bothering his 
chickens. No charges were brought in that matter, Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Animal Control officers seized some of the roosters to be used as 
evidence against Ariosa, he said. TOM MCQUEENEY

2 MEN HELD AFTER CRIME SPREE FREED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two adults arrested on suspicion of participating in a predawn crime spree 
Wednesday morning were freed after being questioned for several hours that 
evening, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"If it turns out that they were telling us the truth, we don't plan to go ahead 
with any case against them," Buena Park Sgt. Terry Branum said Thursday. "We'll 
wait and see if their stories hold up, but for now we're not planning to charge 
them with anything." 
</P>
<P>
Police had arrested the two men, Donald West, 20, and David Morgan, 19, both of 
Buena Park, suspecting that they were involved in a rampage that included two 
armed robberies, two car thefts, smashed windows at an auto parts store, a 
spray-painting binge and a dog that was shot three times. All told, several 
suspects were accused of causing about $10,000 worth of damage, and the dog 
died Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But after questioning Morgan and West, police freed both, having determined 
that they were not part of the crime spree. 
</P>
<P>
Three juveniles were arrested, and Branum said the department still intends to 
proceed with charges against them. Their names are being withheld. A sixth 
suspect is being sought, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Thursday, West acknowledged that he had been present for one of 
the robberies and the first stolen car. But he said he did not participate in 
either of those crimes and that his friends dropped him off at home before 
going on with their crime wave. 
</P>
<P>
"The police didn't believe me until the other guys confessed," West said. "They 
told me they were allowed to arrest me on suspicion, and they just kept 
questioning me." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan was not available for comment. West said Morgan had not been with the 
group during any part of the evening and that he "had not one single thing to 
do with it." 
</P>
<P>
West added that the group did not set out to go on a rampage when the youths -- 
some of whom he said are members of a gang called "Calle Nueve" -- gathered 
late Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't set out to mug nobody," he said. "We just were drinking, and we set 
out looking for some guys we don't get along with." JIM NEWTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
COUNCIL TURNS DOWN CLOSER QUAKE STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite pleas by several Huntington Harbour residents for a more detailed 
earthquake-safety study in their area, the Huntington Beach City Council has 
voted 5 to 2 to take no action on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Harbour residents' concern centered on a controversial 
condominium-building project that they contend straddles the Newport-Inglewood 
seismic fault line. 
</P>
<P>
The 36-unit project would be very unsafe in case of an earthquake, according to 
several Huntington Harbour residents who appeared this week before the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
The project is a twin-tower condominium to be built by Coultrup Development Co. 
on waterfront land now occupied by the Huntington Harbour Bay Club at 4123 
Warner Ave. The City Council, after heated debate, voted 4 to 3 to approve the 
project in January. 
</P>
<P>
But the issue came up again at the council's Monday night meeting because the 
city staff has acknowledged that the location of the Newport-Inglewood fault 
was not correctly plotted in initial engineering drawings. 
</P>
<P>
State law forbids building within an active fault zone. The city staff told the 
City Council that part of the proposed condominium project falls into the fault 
zone. But the staff said the condominiums still can be constructed by 
cantilevering one part of the foundations. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Grace Winchell, who has opposed the condominium project, urged a 
more detailed engineering study before construction is allowed to begin. She 
said lives may be at stake because of errors in plotting the quake zone. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Peter M. Green supported Winchell, but the other five members of the 
council voted to take no new action on the project. Mayor Thomas J. Mays noted 
that the project already is facing a civil lawsuit from residents in Huntington 
Harbour who are trying to block its construction. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;

<P>
7,400 NAMES HANDED IN ON COUNCIL TERMS

<P>
About 7,400 signatures were submitted to the county registrar of voters this 
week by a group of Newport Beach residents hoping to limit City Council members 
to two terms. 
</P>
<P>
The valid signatures of 6,500 registered voters are needed for the charter 
amendment to qualify for the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Janine Gault, a spokeswoman for the residents, said that she found a lot of 
voter interest in the measure on both sides of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"There was very little apathy," she said. "Even if they don't agree with the 
measure, people have strong feelings." 
</P>
<P>
Although the registrar's office has 30 days in which to verify the signatures, 
officials there said they are going to try to check each signature in the next 
two weeks so that the City Council will know by its July 23 meeting whether the 
amendment will qualify for the ballot, according to City Clerk Wanda Raggio. 
</P>
<P>
Should the amendment make the ballot, the council will examine the possibility 
of adopting an alternative measure, with wording that would allow for current 
City Council members to retain their offices even if the amendment passes. 
During earlier meetings, council members have said that to spend the money to 
run for office and then to be removed if the amendment passes would be risky 
and unfair. LAURA MICHAELIS

BOY, 3, RESCUED FROM BOTTOM OF MOTEL POOL

A 3-year-old boy who was found Thursday on the bottom of a motel swimming pool 
was in stable condition after a motel guest revived him, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Lee Hill was taken to Martin Luther Hospital in Anaheim after the 4:35 
p.m. incident, and was scheduled to be transported to Childrens Hospital of 
Orange County for further care, hospital spokeswoman Carolyn Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
According to witnesses, Joseph's mother, Doreen Hill, 25, of Buena Park, dived 
into the pool at the Ambassador Inn and pulled her son out after he was seen 
lying motionless on the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Several witnesses who were gathered around the pool after the incident said 
Joseph must have been under water for at least a minute, maybe longer, before 
anyone noticed that he was no longer standing on the pool steps. 
</P>
<P>
"We noticed something orange at the bottom of the pool and were going to dive 
after it, then we realized that was the color of his shorts," said Ukia 
Neforos, 10, who was at the pool with her father. 
</P>
<P>
"The next thing I know (the boy's mother) was diving in the pool," Ukia said. 
</P>
<P>
"The mother was doing all the screaming, she was hysterical," said Ukia's 
father, Sam Neforos. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as Doreen Hill rescued her son, she handed him to Sam Neforos, who was 
standing at the edge of the pool, witnesses said. Neforos said he did not know 
the mother. 
</P>
<P>
Neforos said he gave the child mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and pushed on his 
chest as the youngster's ears began turning blue. 
</P>
<P>
Ukia helped plug the boy's nose while her father, who said he was a little 
unsure about the proper cardiopulmonary resuscitation procedures, was trying to 
revive him. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to take a chance, he wasn't breathing at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, Joseph's eyes opened up, "and then he started breathing. He was 
coughing up a lot of food and stuff," Sam Neforos said. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics arrived a short while later and took the child and his mother to the 
hospital, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident is under investigation by Fullerton police.

THREE CHEERS: A SMALL RODENT THAT PLAYED A LARGE ROLE

<P>
Exploring the concept of death hardly represents the typical lesson plan for an 
elementary school teacher or his third-grade students. 
</P>
<P>
After all, exactly how does one confront small children -- who in many ways 
embody the meaning of life and its joys -- with a topic considered taboo to 
many adults? 
</P>
<P>
Enter Dinky the rat. 
</P>
<P>
Dinky, a black-and-white female rat, was the classroom pet for Scott Leaman's 
students at Trabuco Mesa Elementary School in Rancho Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
Housed in a glass cage in the corner of the room, Dinky C. Reeboks -- her full 
name, voted on by Leaman's former students in Carlsbad -- was taken home by 
different students each weekend to help teach them the responsibility of caring 
for another being. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, the affectionate rodent with a reputation for licking people's 
faces became a cause celebre when she developed a potentially fatal mammary 
tumor. 
</P>
<P>
The growth was successfully removed through the volunteer work of veterinarian 
Ron Kelpe, but because there was a chance Dinky might not survive the surgery, 
Leaman had prepared his class for her possible death. 
</P>
<P>
He checked out a library book called "Ten Good Things About Barney," which 
discussed the death of a family's pet cat. It focused on the concept that the 
grieving children should remember the good things about their pet rather than 
dwelling on the tragedy of his death. 
</P>
<P>
But Dinky survived. 
</P>
<P>
Kelpe even made a special trip to the classroom to remove her sutures while the 
class gathered around and watched, wide-eyed. And Leaman figured that the 
children, in the excitement of having Dinky back in their midst, had dismissed 
the idea that their pet would one day die. 
</P>
<P>
Then a couple of months later, Leaman noticed a change in the 4-year-old Dinky, 
who was nearing the average life span for a rat. 
</P>
<P>
A subsequent check-up by Kelpe confirmed Leaman's hunch. The diagnosis: 
cancerous tissue had spread to her lungs. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids would hold her and say that she was getting skinny," Leaman recalled. 
"Finally, she was getting down to skin and bones and I decided to keep her at 
my home." 
</P>
<P>
Although Kelpe tried administering large doses of antibiotics, hoping that they 
would act as a form of animal chemotherapy, Dinky responded only for a short 
period of time before her condition worsened. 
</P>
<P>
With Dinky's death imminent, Leaman told the students their pet was very sick. 
But he was careful not to make her death a certainty at that point, in case the 
antibiotic treatments worked. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to come in and tell the kids Dinky was going to die, and have 
them think, 'This is it,' then be wrong if she got better," Leaman explained. 
</P>
<P>
As Dinky grew thinner and more listless, Leaman decided to have Dr. Kelpe put 
her to sleep in February. 
</P>
<P>
He worried how the children would react to the tragic news. To make matters 
worse, a few of the students had persuaded their parents to buy them pet rats 
based on Dinky's example. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the most shocking thing," Leaman said. "The kids handled it a lot 
differently than I thought they would." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Leaman said, there wasn't a lot of reaction. 
</P>
<P>
Then, as part of an ongoing program for the kids to keep journals, he noticed 
some emotional fallout in their writing. One student wrote about crying over 
Dinky's loss; others said they missed their class pet. 
</P>
<P>
"It started oozing out in different places," Leaman said. "And although there 
might have been a lack of observable emotions, there was not a lack of feeling. 
I think I prepared them. It wasn't like we said everything was OK and then she 
was dead the next day." 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks later, Leaman considered replacing Dinky. The students debated: 
Some wanted a rat that looked exactly like Dinky, others wanted a totally 
different animal. 
</P>
<P>
Then, while passing a pet store window, Leaman spotted a beige-and-white rat 
and bought it on impulse. 
</P>
<P>
As he did with Dinky, he allowed the children to vote on a name. 
</P>
<P>
And, in the same glass cage in the same corner of the classroom, Peaches 
Snowball Dinky carries on the legacy of her predecessor. She plays with the 
students, climbing on their arms, necks and up their long-sleeved shirts. She 
teaches them the responsibility of caring. 
</P>
<P>
Dinky, meanwhile, taught the students a valuable lesson to carry them to 
adulthood: the idea of realizing that death is as much a part of life as birth, 
and that the memories of a dead loved one don't have to cause pain. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad Mr. Leaman bought Peaches," said 8-year-old Billy Glas, his freckled 
face and blue eyes solemn as he philosophized about the class pet. "Because if 
we didn't have Peaches, we'd probably forget about Dinky."

LAGUNA NIGUEL

<TEXT>
<P>
After standing by her husband, Joseph (Mac) Duffy, the reputed con man charged 
with swindling women out of their savings to lead a life of luxury, Sylvianne 
Lestringant had his bail revoked so she could use the money for an investment, 
her private investigator said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Reclaiming her Laguna Niguel home that had backed the $40,000 bond she posted 
for Duffy's bail, Lestringant watched as private investigators and Orange 
County sheriff's deputies led him away Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy, 29, was taken to Orange County Jail. He is due for a Superior Court 
hearing on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say the handsome Scotsman romanced several women in their late 30s 
to 50s, then talked them into giving him their money so he could invest it for 
them in the European stock market. But, instead of investing the funds, they 
say, Duffy used the money to support an extravagant lifestyle that included 
expensive cars, fancy clothes and high-priced watches. He is charged with grand 
theft. 
</P>
<P>
Lestringant, 41, had put up $4,000 in cash and used her house as collateral. 
</P>
<P>
Lestringant was not available for comment. However, Thomas G. Martin, a private 
investigator representing her who accompanied sheriff's deputies on Wednesday, 
said his client needed the money for investment purposes. 
</P>
<P>
"She had a business opportunity that was placed before her and she needed to 
use that money. I think she was relieved to not have it tied up with a bail 
bondsman." 
</P>
<P>
Martin said Duffy was taken aback when several investigators from Martin 
Investigative Services of Orange showed up at the Lestringant residence 
accompanied by two sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
"He was surprised but fairly stoic," Martin said. "After the initial shock he 
appeared resigned, and he said that he would go without causing any problems." 
</P>
<P>
Lestringant married Duffy in Las Vegas last January in order to avoid 
testifying against him, but those hopes were dashed when a Harbor Municipal 
Court judge ruled that, as an alleged victim, Lestringant must take the stand. 
</P>
<P>
She was one of several women who have alleged that Duffy swindled them out of 
money by promising to invest their funds in the European stock market. Police 
have estimated that Duffy took about $100,000 from at least nine women in 
Orange County and in cities around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys representing Duffy say that he has returned cash and several items 
bought with some of the money given him, including a gold Rolex watch and a 
1969 white Rolls-Royce.

SAILOR FOUND DEAD AFTER NEIGHBORS EVACUATED;

SUICIDE: 11 HOURS LATER, THE YOUNG MAN'S BODY IS DISCOVERED IN HIS FAMILY'S

<P>
Police evacuated a quiet residential neighborhood here for more than seven 
hours after a distraught young man threatened to kill himself with a gun, 
police said Thursday. But inside his house, the young man may have already been 
dead by the start of the evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Benicke, 21, who police said was AWOL from the Navy, was found by his 
family on a living room sofa around 9 a.m. Thursday. At first, family members 
thought he was asleep, but they later discovered he was dead of a single 
gunshot wound to the head, neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said a gun was found near Benicke's body, and his death appears to have 
been a suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors and police said Benicke had been upset about a recent breakup with a 
girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
About four hours before the body was discovered, some 20 Anaheim police 
officers left the neighborhood without entering the Benicke house after having 
tried unsuccessfully to contact Benicke. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said the victim's mother refused to let police enter her home, but 
Anaheim Police Capt. Roger Baker, who headed the contingent of officers, said 
that decision was made by "mutual agreement." He said that at the time, he did 
not believe there was sufficient evidence that a crime had been committed. 
</P>
<P>
The tragedy began about 9 p.m Wednesday when police received a report of a 
young man with a gun who had threatened to kill himself. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after arriving outside the Benicke home police heard what sounded like a 
gunshot from inside. They evacuated about 10 houses in the immediate area, 
sending some residents to a local school while others waited at the end of the 
block. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know anything had happened until a cop started banging on the door 
and said there'd been a shooting," recounted one neighbor, Dave Hennings. 
</P>
<P>
For the next seven hours, police, believing Benicke was still alive, tried to 
contact him by phone and by loudspeaker as they surrounded the house. Finally, 
around 5 a.m. without any response, they gave up and allowed neighbors to 
return to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said that investigators will have to wait for results of an autopsy to 
determine just what happened inside the Benicke house -- in particular to 
resolve the key question of whether the young man was already dead by the time 
the evacuation got under way. 
</P>
<P>
"We're anxious to know how the coroners will rule and where they'll fix the 
time of death," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
The Benickes, with their flag at half-staff and a bullet hole in their front 
window, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't even really know what happened because it all went so fast," an 
unidentified relative said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Prior to last month's USA/Mobil track and field championships, Bonnie Dasse, 
one of the nation's top female shotputters, was a wreck. 
</P>
<P>
Consumed with her usual megadose of pre-meet anxiety, Dasse tried to tell 
herself there was no use worrying, but her brain had only one response: 
</P>
<P>
"Yiiiiikes!" 
</P>
<P>
Realizing she had to calm down quickly, Dasse resorted to drastic measures. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to Magic Mountain and rode Viper," Dasse said, referring to the 
amusement park's latest ride. Roller coasters have always terrified her. 
</P>
<P>
"I just screamed in bloody terror," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on the day of the meet, Dasse went to see a matinee showing of "Total 
Recall." 
</P>
<P>
"It was a pretty gory action film," she said. "So it helped." 
</P>
<P>
Dasse, who went on to finish third at the national championship behind winner 
Connie Price and longtime rival Ramona Pagel, seems to enjoy scaring herself. 
Especially before a major competition. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I just thrive on that . . . that adrenaline thing," said Dasse, an 
Irvine resident. "A roller coaster, a good speedboat ride. . . . It helps me to 
mellow." 
</P>
<P>
Dasse has made a habit of facing her fears. 
</P>
<P>
Although she is terrified of heights, she once forced herself to climb the side 
of an 80-foot grain silo on her uncle's farm in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
"I forced myself to do it, just to test myself," Dasse, 30, said. "But when I 
got up there, I froze. I literally froze. Rigor mortis set in. I had to wait 
for my father to rescue me." 
</P>
<P>
And despite the fact that Dasse has continual nightmares about tornadoes -- 
"It's like I'm looking out my window and I see five touch down at once," she 
said -- she said her lifetime goal is to witness a tornado up close and 
personal. 
</P>
<P>
"You know how some people always want to see the Eiffel Tower?" Dasse said. "I 
want to see a tornado. If I ever get free time, I'm taking the entire month of 
May and going to Oklahoma. They say that's the prime time for tornadoes." 
</P>
<P>
Next week, Dasse, a graduate of Costa Mesa High School, Orange Coast College 
and San Diego State, will compete at the U.S. Olympic Festival at Minneapolis. 
The shotput competition is scheduled for July 15. 
</P>
<P>
This will be the fifth Olympic Festival appearance for Dasse, who won the 
shotput at this meet in 1986 and '87 and was runner-up in '83 and '89. 
</P>
<P>
Dasse, who in 1986 set an Olympic Festival record with a mark of 59-feet 6 
3/4-inches, watched that mark beaten last year by Price, who threw 59-10 1/2. 
Dasse would like to get the record back. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, she said, is that her two main rivals, Price and Pagel, are 
competing in Europe and will not be attending the Festival. 
</P>
<P>
"When you don't have Connie or Ramona there, it's hard to get nervous," Dasse 
said. "The Olympic Festival I really enjoy because you're there with all the 
other sports, but . . . I can't say I'll have butterflies." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that is in Dasse's best interests. In past competitions, nervousness 
has always been a problem. Her greatest moment, she said, came at a time when 
she was unusually calm. That was during the qualifying rounds at the 1988 
Olympic Games at Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
Dasse joined the U.S. contingent at a one-week training camp in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"It was awesome, like a country club -- totally stress free," she said. Dasse 
said her chances of making the Olympic team were slim. Still, the night before 
the qualifying rounds, she was completely focused. 
</P>
<P>
"At the qualifying, I was like, 'It'll be a miracle if I make it to the final.' 
But I went in and warmed up and my technique was right on the money." 
</P>
<P>
She threw 63-9 3/4 -- just off her career best of 63-11 1/2 -- and was the only 
American to qualify for the final, finishing 11th out of 12 qualifiers. 
</P>
<P>
"It was totally unexpected," she said. "I was just going crazy. I was so 
excited. It was a dream." 
</P>
<P>
But that night, with the finals the next day, Dasse said she let herself get 
caught up in dreamy hopes instead of concentrating on the task at hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I started thinking too much, and I got nervous," she said. "I hadn't expected 
to make the final, and suddenly I'm thinking 'What if?' . . . I got butterflies 
and the whole bit and the next day it was like a total burnout. I threw 57 
(actually 57-9). The problem was I put pressure on myself in the finals. I 
didn't do that (in the qualifying)." 
</P>
<P>
Although Dasse learned a lesson at Seoul, it wasn't until last month's 
USA/Mobil meet that her key to success -- be hyped for competition, but not too 
hyped -- really sunk in. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always gotten very nervous," she said. "At the (1988) Olympic Trials, I 
tried to read a book -- a mellow book -- but every time I read, my stomach 
would get going and I'd just throw the book down. That's when you have an 
overdose of adrenaline. The butterflies are like breeding inside. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I know I can control it. (Prior to the USA/Mobil meet) I had to lay down 
for about an hour before nationals to calm down, and it worked. For the first 
time, I was able to control the butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
"I call it relaxed intensity. That's how I throw my best. At work, I had to 
tell myself 'I don't care what happens today. I don't care if the building gets 
flattened by an earthquake. I am going to be calm.' "

TITAN-TO-SOONER SHUTTLE COULD GET BUSY; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASEBALL: BLYLEVEN AND OTHER PLAYERS HE RECRUITED TO FULLERTON ARE 
PLANNING ON FOLLOWING FORMER COACH LARRY COCHELL TO OKLAHOMA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
One high school baseball player who had signed with Cal State Fullerton said he 
will follow former Titan Coach Larry Cochell and pitching coach Vern Ruhle to 
the University of Oklahoma. And two players who were planning to transfer to 
Fullerton from four-year colleges appear ready to jump on the Sooner shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, two players who had signed with Fullerton are wavering in their 
commitments in the wake of Cochell's resignation Tuesday to accept the Oklahoma 
job. 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park High School pitcher Todd Blyleven, who had signed with the Titans, 
said Thursday he will ask to be released from his letter of intent so he can 
pitch under Ruhle, a former major-league pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven, a right-hander who is the son of Angel pitcher Bert Blyleven, was 8-2 
with a 1.26 earned-run average and 82 strikeouts this season. Only Fullerton 
Athletic Director Ed Carroll can issue the release, but Carroll is on vacation 
until next week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nothing against Fullerton or anything, but Vern was the reason I went 
there," Blyleven said. "I want to stay with him. I'm looking forward to going 
to Oklahoma. It's my kind of area -- you can wear cowboy boots, jeans -- it's 
kind of hicksville. That's what I'm like." 
</P>
<P>
Ruhle also was the reason that USC sophomore Mike Smedes, a right-handed 
pitcher from Laguna Hills High, had asked to be released from his Trojan 
scholarship after the season. 
</P>
<P>
Smedes, an eighth-round draft pick in 1988 by the Seattle Mariners, said he was 
planning to transfer to Fullerton after Trojan Coach Mike Gillespie gave him 
his release. But now, his plans may change. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Ruhle is where it's at, and I'd like to stay with him," Smedes said. 
"I'd like to take a trip to Oklahoma and see what it's like. I'll probably make 
a decision next week." 
</P>
<P>
Tony Darden, a sophomore right-hander who redshirted at UCLA this past season, 
was released from his scholarship by Bruin Coach Gary Adams and said he was 
planning to transfer to Fullerton. But the Diamond Bar High graduate said he 
will re-evaluate his situation. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons I was transferring was because of the coaches," Darden 
said. "They've expressed interest in me going to Oklahoma, and they're supposed 
to get back to me in a few days." 
</P>
<P>
Cochell, who can recruit Smedes and Darden because they are not presently 
obligated to any school, said he would like to have both pitchers at Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Brannis, a left-handed pitcher from Estancia High who signed with 
Fullerton this past spring, isn't exactly sure where he will go to college. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm playing it by ear to see who comes in as the head coach," Brannis said. 
"But the reason I chose Fullerton was Vern Ruhle, so I'm a little upset by 
this. It has left a weird feeling. I'm not sure why I'm going to Fullerton 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Herman, an outfielder from Golden West College who has signed with the 
Titans, says he isn't sure how the coaching change will affect him. 
</P>
<P>
"But a coach from Arkansas here says if things don't work out, I have a chance 
to play there," Herman said from Anchorage, Alaska, where he is playing summer 
baseball. "I was really looking forward to playing for Cochell." 
</P>
<P>
Cochell, who guided the Titans to two College World Series appearances in three 
seasons, says he doesn't want a mass exodus from Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"I will talk to all the kids and tell them not to panic, because Fullerton will 
hire a good coach," Cochell said. "The program will be as good or better as 
than it is now." 
</P>
<P>
Two other players who have signed with the Titans, Golden West infielder Robb 
Carabba and Glendale College first baseman Art Chute, said they will honor 
their commitments to Fullerton, regardless of the coaching change. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Constantino, an outfielder from Mission College in Santa Clara; Jim 
Betzold, an outfielder from Mater Dei High, and Jason Hutchins, a pitcher from 
Golden West -- who fill out the balance of Cochell's recruiting class this year 
-- couldn't be reached for comment.

PROFITABLE FUN ZONE RIDES ARE STILL ON THE BLOCK FOR $2.5 MILLION AFTER A YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

About a year ago, Joe Tunstall was oiling the bumper cars at the Fun Zone -- 
Newport Beach's vest-pocket amusement park -- and explaining why he was tired 
of owning the merry-go-round, the small Ferris wheel and the "Scary Dark Ride." 
</P>
<P>
Running the Fun Zone rides is a profitable business, and was even fun for a 
while, said Tunstall, who collects amusement-park rides on the side. 
</P>
<P>
But it's also a lot of work for a guy who's in his 50s and has already made a 
bundle from a bike shop and wants to spend it traveling. 
</P>
<P>
So, Tunstall said a year ago, he and a partner were putting the rides on the 
Balboa Peninsula up for sale. (The Fun Zone building itself belongs to a 
Japanese businessman; the rides are on a 20-year lease.) 
</P>
<P>
But no serious takers have come forward as yet, Tunstall said a few days ago. 
He's asking $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the rides brought in about $1.1 million last year -- up 10% from 
the year before -- and that the owners cleared around $400,000 before taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"No product costs," Tunstall said, explaining the high profit margin. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had offers, but they've been on the ridiculous side," he said. "I don't 
need to get out of here that bad. I just want to get out." It looks, however, 
like he's in the amusement-park business for a while yet.

Sweet Revenge: Prince Charles once attacked one of James Stirling's buildings 
as looking like a 1930s radio. 
</P>
<P>
But the British architect, who designed the new science library at UC Irvine, 
can feel vindicated. 
</P>
<P>
Last month he won one of the world's richest art prizes, the Praemium Imperiale 
Prize for architecture. 
</P>
<P>
The prize, given by the Japanese, carries an award of $170,000. Stirling, 64, 
took the occasion to upbraid the heir to the British throne, a critic of modern 
architecture: "I don't think he can distinguish between good and bad 
architecture." 
</P>
<P>
UCI, founded in the 1960s, has hired an impressive array of architects to 
design its buildings. The campus was laid out by the noted planner and 
architect William Pereira, who also designed many of its early buildings; Frank 
Gehry and Charles Moore worked on later buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Working drawings for the new six-story science library -- the campus' second 
major library building -- are just finished. Construction is scheduled to begin 
in October and be completed by spring, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The $32-million building, of tan glass and cement, will have a circular main 
wing with a courtyard inside and a rectangular wing on either side. A 
pedestrian mall will run through the middle of the main wing.

RECREATION: BIKES ARE CHANGING FOR THE BETTER. THE 10-SPEED YOU ONCE DREAMED 
ABOUT MAY NOT BE WHAT YOU WANT NOW. MAYBE YOU NEED A MOUNTAIN BIKE, OR HYBRID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BEENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So you thought you'd buy a new bicycle. Run down to the local bike shop, check 
out the 10-speeds, spend maybe $125 and be riding by the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
My, how things have changed. In case you don't know it, the standard-spoked 
bicycle has gone through a revolution of sorts since your youth. Thanks to 
technology, new designs and radical new features, the old two-wheeled steed has 
undergone a dizzying number of changes, making it easier, and more enjoyable, 
to ride than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
It's never been this much fun -- or this costly. 
</P>
<P>
In a word: If you haven't bought a bicycle recently but are eager to take 
advantage of Orange County's ideal biking weather and myriad bike trails, be 
ready for a shock the next time you drop by your local bike shop. You might not 
even recognize some of the machines on display, and worse yet, you might not 
know how to operate them. 
</P>
<P>
 But first, discard the idea of dusting off that old 10-speed in the garage. It 
may still work all right, but if the biking industry standard a decade ago was 
a Volkswagen beetle -- sturdy and dependable -- today it's more of a Volvo, 
equally durable but capable of so much more. So unless that relic in the garage 
was a collector's item when you bought it, consider it garage-sale fodder and 
let it go. 
</P>
<P>
And if you're still intent on going on the cheap, consider this: by the time 
you take your old bike in for a tuneup, replace the tires and a few cables and 
get it overhauled, you'll have a bill upwards of $150 -- if it's done right. 
And even then all you'll have is a spruced-up antique. What is it they say? You 
can give a bum a shave and a haircut, but he's still a bum. 
</P>
<P>
Like anything -- cars, computers, stereos -- you're better off knowing what is 
out there, and what your needs are, before you set foot in the bike shop. A 
good salesman will walk you though the new lines and what is available, but a 
little knowledge goes a long way. 
</P>
<P>
Which bike you select depends on what kind of riding you plan on doing, but 
generally there are three basic types of bicycles on the market. 
</P>
<P>
* Road bikes: This is the much-beloved classic 10-speed, the European-designed 
import that was so popular during the bicycle boom of the early 1970s. This 
skinny tire, drop handlebar machine was designed for speed and remains popular 
with traditionalists and those who have taken to biking for fitness and racing. 
</P>
<P>
But some industry experts, including Bicycling magazine, already seem prepared 
to write its obituary. The problem: the drop handlebars, designed to put the 
rider in the most aerodynamic position possible, have proved too uncomfortable 
for the mass market and the tires, while great for speed on the road, are prone 
to flats. Still, if you're looking to drop a few pounds or stay in shape, there 
is nothing that beats a road bike for overall versatility and plain, aesthetic 
beauty. Purists will ride nothing else, and think nothing of spending $2,000 to 
$5,000 for a custom model. 
</P>
<P>
Road bikes generally come with 12, 14 or 16 speeds -- the term 10-speed has 
hence become a misnomer -- and feature steel, aluminum, carbon fiber or 
composite frames. Prices for entry-level production road bikes start around 
$350 to $400. Mid-range road bikes, those with higher quality brakes, gears, 
frame tubing and components, run around $650. 
</P>
<P>
* Mountain bikes: This particularly American invention burst onto the scene 10 
years ago and has single-handedly changed the way the world looks at the 
bicycle. Immensely popular, these fat tire bikes featuring upright handlebars 
were designed to go off the road but have proved popular on asphalt as well. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers say most people who buy mountain bikes rarely leave the road. Mountain 
bikes comprise about 70% of the total bike sales in the United States, and they 
currently are the rage of Europe. Even some of Europe's most revered names in 
racing bikes (Colnago and Pinarello among them) have broken with tradition and 
are marketing their own version of the American mountain bike. 
</P>
<P>
The advantages: The fat, knobby tires rarely give way to flats, and the upright 
handlebars and padded seats make for a generally more comfortable ride for the 
recreational cyclist. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain bikes also feature a third "granny" gear in the front, giving riders 
an additional set of gears -- most come with 21 gears -- to take the steep 
hills with ease. On the downside, these bikes, like a four-wheel-drive Jeep, 
were not designed for the street, and they can be clearly limiting on longer 
rides. 
</P>
<P>
Prices for good quality mountain 
</P>
<P>
bikes begin around $300. Look for mid-range models, again featuring better 
grades of chromoly steel and superior components, in the $500-$600 range. 
</P>
<P>
* Hybrids: Perhaps the most interesting, and promising, development of the past 
few years has been the introduction of what is known as the hybrid bike. 
</P>
<P>
Sensing the public's desire for a more comfortable ride but the ability to go 
greater distances, manufacturers took the best of both the road and mountain 
bikes and came up with the hybrid, which is known by a number of names -- cross 
trainers, cross terrain, multi-track, to name a few. Most of the hybrids come 
with upright handlebars, allowing the rider to avoid the hunched-over racing 
position of the classic road bike. The tires are thinner than the mountain 
bike's but still thicker, and therefore more durable, than the road bike's 
standard slicks. 
</P>
<P>
Some industry experts see the hybrid as the bike of the future, one that avoids 
the extremes of the road and mountain bikes while providing a clean, fast, 
trouble-free ride. Prices begin around $300 and escalate from there. 
</P>
<P>
If the prices scare you, take heart. The bike of 1990 is nothing like its 
distant cousin of a decade ago. Like computers, the technology has moved so 
fast that it is almost unthinkable to be riding anything but one of the new 
generation of bikes. 
</P>
<P>
They are lighter, faster and feature superior designs and frame materials. And 
-- this can't be emphasized enough -- they also are easier to handle. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for example, what has happened to shifting. Thanks to a Japanese company, 
SunTour, most bikes now come equipped with what is known as "indexed" or 
"click" shifting. A simple click of a lever or push of a button throws the bike 
into a new gear. No more looking back at the rear freewheel to make sure the 
chain hits the right cog. Want to go up three gears? Click the lever three 
times. 
</P>
<P>
What this does is render obsolete that tired old question: Why do I need 21 
gears? Do you ever use all of them? Thanks to trouble-free shifting, riders are 
zipping through the gears with healthy abandon. 
</P>
<P>
Equally important (but probably overemphasized by those who know no better) is 
weight. Advances in design and construction have made bikes lighter than ever 
before. Pick up any new bike if you doubt it. Aluminum bikes are even lighter 
and new materials (carbon fiber, composites) are taking this quest for 
lightness to new extremes. 
</P>
<P>
But weight should not be the only consideration. More important are the 
components -- brakes, derailleurs, gearing, chain rings, etc. -- and the frame. 
If you want a better bike, pay attention to the frame and components and don't 
be reluctant to pay an extra $75 to $100, or even $200, for a superior bicycle. 
In the highly competitive world of bikes, you truly get what you pay for. 
</P>
<P>
Pedal systems have also been vastly improved, cranks are more durable and 
lighter and brakes have never been as sure. Good quality name-brand bikes (we 
are excluding department and discount store models) will also come with 
knock-off wheels, meaning that removing the front or rear wheel can be done by 
releasing a simple lever. The height of the seat post is also adjustable with a 
lever. 
</P>
<P>
The final, and perhaps most important, aspect of bike shopping is finding the 
right shop. Unfortunately, all bike shops are not equal. Shop around. Find a 
shop that carries name brands with solid reputations (Trek, Specialized, 
Centurion are three) and has a mechanic who knows what he's doing. 
</P>
<P>
Ask for references. How long has he been in business? Does he race? Look around 
the shop. Check the prices. Generally, the better shops offering more expertise 
will carry a number of higher-end models catering to racers or serious 
recreational cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
And lastly there is the fit. Ten years ago people paid little attention to 
sizing, but today the size of the frame, the height of the stem, the width of 
the handlebars and the position of the seat post are all important in providing 
the most comfortable ride possible. 
</P>
<P>
Good shops will fit you for the right size bike at no cost (this involves 
measuring the inseam, upper body, shoulders, etc). Others will sell you a bike, 
no matter how big or small, to move it off the floor. A good bike shop should 
be like the family doctor -- the expert to which you go with your problems. 
</P>
<P>
Bikers have a name for dilettantes who think they know what they're doing but 
don't. You see them on the road riding bikes too small or large for them and 
spinning along in the wrong gear. They're called Freds. So shop around, find 
the right shop, buy the bike that suits your needs and stay out of Fred's shop.

ANN CONWAY: IRVINE CONCERT AN AURAL AND ORAL TREAT 
</P>

<P>
"We're waving the flag, not burning it!" 
</P>
<P>
With that, Marcy Mulville waved Old Glory with gusto on Wednesday night at the 
Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre, site of the "All-American Celebration" concert by 
the Pacific Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Mulville, the lively chairwoman of the symphony board, joined about 100 music 
buffs for the Fourth of July gourmet picnic that accompanied the start of the 
orchestra's popular summer series. 
</P>
<P>
Available for sampling on tables set up in the orchestra pit: tender 
honey-baked ham with mustard sauce, corn-bread muffins and a crisp salad tossed 
with a rainbow of posies (nice touch). Mini pecan pies and steaming coffee 
arrived at intermission. The picnic fare was whisked to the tables -- set with 
gold-edged ivory china and spotless linens -- in huge baskets wrapped in 
firecracker-red cellophane. 
</P>
<P>
And while the food was something to write home about, it was the brut champagne 
that gave this event its gourmet status. Guests could toss the bubbly down with 
dinner or savor it -- chilled as it was in elegant silver buckets -- throughout 
the concert. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Symphony supporters have a good thing going. For $2,700 per table of 
four, subscribers can enjoy all five summer concerts and dine grandly in the 
orchestra pit every time. Each ticket really costs $1,200 (actually, you get 
eight tickets -- four for the dinner table and four for the stands -- should 
you desire to be serenaded somewhere other than in the pit). The remaining 
$1,500 is a tax-deductible donation, according to symphony organizers. 
</P>
<P>
Guests can also pack their own picnic fare. Joyce and Jim Justice, trying out 
their table for the first time, dined on chilled veal loin with peppercorn 
sauce, caviar, smoked salmon, fruit compote and chocolate mousse cake. "This is 
so much nicer than the Hollywood Bowl," Joyce said. "There, you're lucky if you 
get a decent table." 
</P>
<P>
After the concert, which included the classic "Rhapsody in Blue" (performed on 
a red, white and blue Baldwin by pianist Evans Haile), concert-goers were 
treated to a 20-minute fireworks extravaganza. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the scene: board members Anne and Tom Key (she in a white shirt 
spangled with red stars, he telling fellow picnickers that he is a distant 
relative of Francis Scott Key), Gina and Reed Royalty, Charles and Geraldine 
Spencer, Gene and Nadine Layton, Martin and Margie Hubbard, Charles and Pat 
Poss, and Louis Spisto.

LAGUNA BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the boardwalk in Laguna Beach, there's a fashion show that takes place 
whenever the summer sun burns especially hot. All along the winding wood 
runway, tourists and locals stroll by wearing their brightest beach togs. 
</P>
<P>
A recent heat wave brought out a four-pack of teen-age girls, each dressed in 
tight cutoff jeans rolled two or three inches above the knees, and white 
T-shirts. Nearby was a woman in a gauzy batik dress and a black scarf wrapped 
around her head. Stepping lightly in a sheer lavender skirt and hot pink bikini 
top was a young blonde. She was under the watchful eye of some of the boys of 
summer in their fluorescent volleyball shorts and mirrored sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
"My daughter came here last week wearing a leather bustier and a python," says 
a middle-aged woman who declines to reveal her name for fear of giving her 
daughter further exposure. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything goes," she says. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to find better-dressed beach bums than those on Laguna's boardwalk. 
With its influx of tourists from around the world and its affluent locals, 
Laguna Beach attracts visitors who can afford the very best in beachwear. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, the boardwalk is filled with people wearing cropped tops that 
leave the midriff exposed, oversize T-shirts, baggy cotton knit pants in wild, 
colorful prints and skintight biker shorts. 
</P>
<P>
On the basketball court by the boardwalk, where the squeaking of sneakers can 
be heard all day long, a man in his 20s cuts a sharp figure in his 
black-and-white checkered bike shorts and a red tank top. A little girl no more 
than 6 skips by in a pair of leopard biker shorts. Her mother wears a 
glitter-spattered T-shirt big enough to get lost in and white cotton leggings. 
</P>
<P>
Boardwalk chic also demands the right accessories -- plastic sunglasses with 
Day-Glo temples, wide-brimmed straw hats with neon ties, bright canvas "aqua 
sox" with rubber soles for venturing onto the tide pools and sandals with wide 
straps that wrap around the feet like bandages. 
</P>
<P>
People of all ages sport fanny packs, kangaroo-style, around their middles. 
</P>
<P>
"I got disgusted when I saw a Gucci fanny pack," says Barbara Carletti, who 
works in an optometrist's office in Laguna Beach. Carletti often sits by the 
boardwalk watching the fashion parade during her lunch hour and can give a 
blow-by-blow description of the trends. 
</P>
<P>
She doesn't like fanny packs because she says they give people "an Alfred 
Hitchcock silhouette." She deplores men's volleyball shorts with the 
manufacturer's logo stamped on the back because "it looks like they sat in 
something." 
</P>
<P>
"And I'm sick of neon. I hate neon," she says, pointing out a man in 
electric-orange swim trunks. "I thought this would be the summer for change, 
but there's still lots of neon at the beach. They've been doing it three years, 
and it's boring." 
</P>
<P>
While some have turned off the Day-Glo colors and changed into earth tones in 
ethnic prints, many beach-goers have yet to realize that neon is fading. They 
continue to wear blinding colors. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like there's roadwork all over the beach," Carletti says. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street from the boardwalk, one can find the latest summer styles 
inside small beachwear boutiques. 
</P>
<P>
Main Beach Sunwear has everything for the trendy beach-goer: T-shirts with 
colorful ethnic prints, hordes of bright trunks by Quiksilver, Neet Feet thongs 
in funky geometric shapes that look like something worn by the Space-Age 
Jetsons family and baggy "crazy pants" by Panama Jack, with elastic waists and 
ankles in loud geometric and cartoon prints. 
</P>
<P>
"I wear them with a tube top and sandals," says Danielle Dufault, 20, 
vacationing in Laguna Beach from Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Earl Dawson, owner of Main Beach Sunwear, says he has ordered cartons of the 
baggy pants to ride out this latest fad. Beach styles change so rapidly, Dawson 
says, it's hard to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to really keep on top of it," he says, "or 90 days later everything 
changes." 
</P>
<P>
Corinth Ladies Apparel stocks short sets with cropped tank tops in shades of 
coral, lemon and lime, some adorned with lace around the midriff or decorated 
with a tiny paisley print. There are hand-painted T-shirts, some with leather 
fringe and rhinestones around a V-neck for $40, and a tank dress in a lime or 
hot pink batik print for $28. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean Breeze, a women's boutique, has racks loaded with the gauzy batik and 
tie-dyed prints that can be worn as beach cover-ups. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen so much color -- it's vivid and splashy this year," says Helen 
Palmer, a sales clerk for the store. 
</P>
<P>
The shop has full skirts made of strips of contrasting batik prints for $70 and 
a floral skirt of sheer, crinkled fabric for $45. 
</P>
<P>
"Women buy them to dance in or to wear with a swimsuit," Palmer says. 
</P>
<P>
They can accent the outfits with scarfs made of sheer fabric in brilliant 
floral prints, and "big, fun and loud" jewelry adorned with seashells or 
brightly painted wood fish and birds. 
</P>
<P>
"People who come here from conservative areas are amazed," Palmer says. "One 
day I sold $1,000 worth of clothes to a gal from New York City who said she'd 
never seen such bright colors." 
</P>
<P>
Tourists who have a "vacation mentality" often find themselves buying clothes 
they wouldn't buy at home. 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Baum, a Long Beach resident, wanders in and out of the boutiques looking 
for a store that will carry her line of hand-painted, lace-embellished 
T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
Vacationers will pay $40 for a hand-painted T-shirt so they can take it home 
and say, "This is what I got in Laguna Beach," Baum says. 
</P>
<P>
Then they'll leave the fine T-shirt in the suitcase and wear a fun, sloppy 
T-shirt to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
People have more freedom to wear whatever they like at the beach, Baum says. 
Even locals can don the colorful or outrageous clothes they can't wear anyplace 
else. 
</P>
<P>
"Beach attire is not going to knock the fashion world on its ear, but it is a 
look unto its own," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"You can dress differently when you come to Laguna Beach. You can put on all 
that tacky stuff and get away with it."

NATO UNVEILS A NEW LOOK; 
</P>
<P>
ALLIES VOW LESS TROOPS, NUCLEAR CUTS

<TEXT>
<P>
The NATO allies pledged today to sharply reduce both nuclear and conventional 
defenses in Europe, extending "the hand of friendship" to Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
and the rest of Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush hailed the outcome of the summit as "a historic turning point." 
He said Gorbachev could use the summit's ending declaration "to convince 
others" that the Soviets need not fear the West at a time when they find 
themselves weakened economically and in military retreat. 
</P>
<P>
"NATO now has a new international vocation, a political vocation," Canadian 
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said. 
</P>
<P>
With a joint statement titled "The London Declaration on a Transformed North 
Atlantic Alliance," the 16 NATO heads of state ended a two-day summit intended 
to adapt the 41-year-old North Atlantic Treaty Organization to changing 
European realities. 
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher termed the document "a landmark in the 
history of NATO and of Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Solemnly, Bush and his 15 Western alliance partners assured the Soviet leader, 
who is under attack from left and right at the 28th Communist Party Congress in 
Moscow, that they hold "no aggressive intentions" and "will never in any 
circumstance be the first to use force." 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Gorbachev said he was ready to accept the leaders' invitation to 
address a meeting of the Western alliance, probably in December. And Soviet 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said, "We welcome the results 
of the (NATO) session." 
</P>
<P>
But Gorbachev could take little comfort from Bush's comment that he had "big 
problems" with the idea of direct Western economic aid to the Soviet Union -- a 
subject likely to dominate the Houston economic summit where Bush and many of 
the other Western leaders were flying after the NATO meeting. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the allies agreed to shrink their arsenal of battlefield nuclear 
weapons -- in tandem with Soviet action -- and relegate them to highly unlikely 
last-resort use. 
</P>
<P>
They also said, in their windup communique, that "once negotiations begin on 
short-range nuclear forces, the alliance will propose, in return for reciprocal 
action by the Soviet Union, the elimination of all its nuclear artillery shells 
from Europe." 
</P>
<P>
They also decided to field smaller and restructured ground forces, in the 
newest sign that NATO's 40-year job of containing potential Soviet-bloc 
aggression was nearing a successful end. 
</P>
<P>
One shift in NATO doctrine, away from a quarter-century threat to use nuclear 
weapons promptly if attacked, drew most of the notice. More subtle but also 
significant was the decision to abandon the strategy of massing troops against 
the East-West frontier, switching to smaller mobile units farther back. 
</P>
<P>
"Allied leaders will have maximum flexibility in deciding how to respond to a 
crisis," the communique said. 
</P>
<P>
And, in a surprise move designed to allay one of Gorbachev's deepest concerns, 
the NATO allies agreed to set a limit on the size of Germany's military forces. 
That could mean a cut of more than 160,000 soldiers from the combined troops of 
East and West Germany after merger.

POLICE SHOOT IRVINE TAXI-THEFT SUSPECT AFTER FREEWAY CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Service Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man driving a taxicab stolen in Irvine shot at pursuing police along the 
crowded San Diego Freeway this morning before he was cornered and shot by 
officers in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The unidentified suspect was shot an unknown number of times by at least one 
uniformed officer as he hid in a gully near the intersection of Moulton Parkway 
and Laguna Hills Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment of his gunshot wounds, 
Irvine police Lt. Vic Thies said. His condition was unknown. 
</P>
<P>
The man allegedly stole the taxi at a hotel and drove onto the freeway. He was 
spotted at Irvine Center Drive by police, who began a high-speed pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
As the suspect approached El Toro Road, he began firing a .45-caliber automatic 
handgun at the officers, blowing out the rear window of the yellow taxi, police 
said. The suspect continued to fire shots, leaving the freeway at Oso Parkway 
and driving through several Laguna Hills neighborhoods. 
</P>

The incident began at 9:50 a.m. when the man approached taxi driver Valery

TEACHER WHO FLED MOLEST CHARGES HELD 
</P>

<P>
A fifth-grade teacher who jumped bail nearly three years ago to avoid 
prosecution on felony charges of molesting students was brought back to Los 
Angeles in handcuffs today after he was found in a homeless camp in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Don Ray Moore, 56, who had taught for 16 years at the 97th Street School, told 
police that he had been living among Southern California's homeless since 
August, 1987, when 21 felony counts were filed against him. 
</P>
<P>
He was already facing trial on misdemeanor charges of molestation and illegal 
child paddling. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, his goatee shaved off and his gray hair partly dyed auburn, was driven 
into Parker Center downtown about 11:30 a.m. and walked inside. He was held on 
$500,000 bail, and police said he should be arraigned on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think in a way he's probably glad it's all over," said Detective Ralph 
Bennett, who went to Ventura to bring Moore to Los Angeles. "He said it was a 
very difficult time." 
</P>
<P>
Moore was recognized by a gas company employee who saw his face broadcast last 
Sunday on the television show "America's Most Wanted." The employee called 
Ventura police, who arrested Moore. The gas employee had been working around 
the homeless encampment where Moore had been living, Bennett said.

BULGARIA CHIEF QUITS IN 'LET TANKS COME' FLAP

<P>
President Peter Mladenov, the Communist reformer who oversaw Bulgaria's 
transition to a multi-party democracy, resigned today amid controversy over his 
inflammatory remarks at a demonstration seven months ago. 
</P>
<P>
The official BTA news agency announced the resignation in a one-sentence 
dispatch, but gave no explanation. Mladenov, 53, had served as president since 
April 3. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Peter Mladenov, president of the republic, has just handed in his 
resignation," the news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came hours after Bulgaria's largest opposition party, the 
Union of Democratic Forces, joined a chorus of demands for Mladenov's 
resignation, citing his remark at a stormy Dec. 14 protest that authorities 
should "let the tanks come." 
</P>
<P>
The remark, captured on videotape at the time but forgotten, was resurrected by 
the democratic opposition in the final days of the campaign for parliamentary 
elections June 10 and 17. 
</P>
<P>
After several weeks of silence, Mladenov told the nation in a televised speech 
on Wednesday that his words had been taken out of context. He said he opposes 
violence and never intended that tanks be deployed against anti-government 
demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
The resignation of the president was one of the chief demands of hundreds of 
students staging a 25-day sit-in strike at Sofia University and outside the 
presidential building. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Bulgarian Agrarian Union, which was formerly allied with the 
Communist Party, made a similar appeal. Even the newspaper of the ruling 
Bulgarian Socialist Party -- the former Communist Party -- had suggested it 
would be best for Mladenov to quit. 
</P>
<P>
The controversial remark was made Dec. 14 after Mladenov tried unsuccessfully 
to persuade a noisy mob of anti-government demonstrators to disperse. Thousands 
of protesters surrounded the Parliament building that evening, demanding that 
the ruling Communist Party give up its guaranteed monopoly on power. 
</P>
<P>
When his speech to the protesters was disrupted by jeers and heckling, Mladenov 
muttered, "Let the tanks come." 
</P>
<P>
Political observers said many Bulgarians were angered not so much by the words 
themselves as by Mladenov's initial refusal to acknowledge that he made the 
remark, despite the clear evidence of the videotape, which was examined by 
specialists.

A couple were sentenced to 10 years' probation today for allowing their son to 
die while treating him with Christian Science healing methods rather than 
taking him to a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
David and Ginger Twitchell were ordered to take their surviving children for 
regular medical checkups as a part of their probationary sentence for 
manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always tried to obey the law . . . and will try to obey the judge's 
instructions," Twitchell said after leaving the courtroom. "We'll try to 
balance the law and the judge's instructions with our trust in God." 
</P>
<P>
Suffolk Superior Court Judge Sandra Hamlin rejected a prosecution request that 
the couple be automatically jailed if they violate any term of the probationary 
sentence. Instead, if there is a violation, a hearing would be held and 
punishment would be decided. 
</P>
<P>
The Twitchells, both 34 and lifelong Christian Scientists, had faced up to 20 
years in prison. Hamlin had indicated Thursday, however, that she did not 
believe the couple should be put behind bars for the 1986 death of their 2 
1/2-year-old son, Robyn. 
</P>
<P>
The couple were found guilty of manslaughter Wednesday; their lawyer has said 
they will appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the probation, Hamlin said that American Medical Assn. standards 
should be followed for checkups of the Twitchells' three surviving sons and any 
children they might have in the future. If there is any sign of serious 
illness, they are to take their children to a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
After a two-month trial, a jury found the Twitchells, former Boston residents 
now living in New York, guilty of involuntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
The key issue in their trial is one continually debated by legal scholars: 
Where should the government draw the line on freedom of religion?

BREZHNEV'S DAUGHTER REGAINS VALUABLES;

SOVIET CORRUPTION: COURT DETERMINES PROPERTY IS HERS, NOT THAT OF HER HUSBAND

<P>
Former Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev's daughter Galina has won a court 
action for the return of a country house, a Mercedes-Benz car and other 
valuables, a Moscow newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The valuables -- including a cash deposit of 65,500 rubles ($104,000 at the 
official rate), antique furniture and stuffed animals -- were confiscated when 
her husband, Yuri Churbanov, was convicted of corruption in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The Young Communist League daily Komsomolskaya Pravda said she persuaded a 
Moscow appeal court that all the property belonged to her and not Churbanov, 
whom she married in 1971 and who then quickly rose to become a first deputy 
interior minister. 
</P>
<P>
Churbanov is serving a 12-year jail sentence for taking bribes during the 
regime of his father-in-law. Breshnev died in 1981 after ruling for 17 years 
and is now widely condemned for leading the country into economic and social 
decay. 
</P>
<P>
Komsomolskaya Pravda, which left little doubt it disapproved of the decision, 
quoted the appeal court judge as saying there had been no official interference 
in the hearing or attempts to influence his verdict. 
</P>
<P>
He told the newspaper's reporter that Galina Brezhnev, widely known during the 
Brezhnev period for her extravagant lifestyle, said in court that most of the 
valuables were presents to her from her father or from her circus artist first 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted her as declaring in evidence: "My Mercedes car was a present 
to my father from some foreign statesman. I have a driving license and I drove 
it. It wasn't my father's habit to give gifts to my husbands." 
</P>
<P>
Brezhnev himself was widely known for his love of fast foreign cars and made it 
clear he expected his hosts on overseas trips and senior foreign visitors to 
Moscow to present him new ones for his collection.

WANTED: A TENANT WHO KNOWS ROACHES AREN'T PETS

A landlord tired of undesirable tenants said today that he has received 
hundreds of phone calls since advertising for tenants with standards, including 
knowing that "roaches are not household pets." 
</P>
<P>
Landlord Jim Kennedy, 45, of New Paltz said he placed the classified ad in the 
Kingston Freeman after booting a perceived drug dealer out of one of his 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said he was tired of renting to the "dregs of society." 
</P>
<P>
The advertisement requires that tenants: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Have a job or at least give the appearance that you could get one." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Have some type of schooling or at least know there are other adverbs 
besides the one which starts with 'F' and ends with 'ing.' " 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Realize roaches are not household pets and you will keep the apartment 
clean so that you will not attract any." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Actually pay the rent on time, with a good check." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Realize drugs are not fun and you must have a doctor's prescription to use 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Must actually be married to your partner or at least know the correct 
spelling of their last name." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said he got the idea for the ad "from the people who were coming to 
look at the property. I own a lot of houses and have had this problem for a 
long time -- you put $200,000 into a building and it's not taken care of." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said he has received 200 calls since placing the ad and "195 were 
positive." He said he rented the apartment "to a lovely couple."

Nathaniel Wyeth, the brother of artist Andrew Wyeth and the inventor of the 
plastic soda bottle, died at his home in this coastal community. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
Wyeth, who lived in the village of Tenants Harbor in Saint George, was 
pronounced dead at the Penobscot Bay Medical Center in Glen Cove on Wednesday 
night, hospital spokesman Russell Donahue said today. 
</P>
<P>
While other members of the family achieved greater fame with their art work, 
Wyeth achieved distinction in science during a 40-year career with the Du Pont 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
He was best known for developing the polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, 
bottle, which he invented in the early 1970s. The bottle is used for carbonated 
beverages, wine, liquor and food because of its light weight and impact 
resistance. It was patented in 1973, and more than 6 million of the containers 
are produced annually around the world.

Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki ousted all but one former Communist from his 
Cabinet today to counter criticism of his 10-month-old government's 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
But some Solidarity activists said the changes weren't sweeping enough. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech before Parliament that was broadcast nationwide, Mazowiecki said 
political battles in the non-Communist-led government were threatening the 
country's peaceful evolution to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
The prime minister announced the resignation of five Cabinet ministers, 
including three of the four former Communists who remained in the government as 
the price for Solidarity replacing the Communist regime in September. 
</P>
<P>
Prominent among those ousted was the interior minister, Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, 
who is in charge of the police, and Defense Minister Florian Siwicki. 
</P>
<P>
Mazowiecki retained ex-Communist Marcin Swiecicki, the young foreign trade 
minister who has been instrumental in trade talks with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Some Solidarity activists said they were not satisfied with the shake-up. 
</P>
<P>
"These changes are not sufficient," said Bogdan Lis, a Solidarity senator from 
Gdansk.

Philippine communist guerrillas said today that they will release sometime this 
month a U.S. Peace Corps volunteer and a Japanese aid worker they are holding, 
but warned that the two might be killed if soldiers try to rescue them. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels, in an interview with Philippine reporters, said Timothy Swanson of 
Cheyenne, Wyo., and Fumio Mizuno were safe and were being held on Negros Island 
on suspicion of involvement in the government's anti-insurgency campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"We will turn them over within the month but an offensive by the enemy might 
endanger their lives," a New People's Army commander, who identified himself as 
Comrade Efren, said in the interview. 
</P>
<P>
The commander warned soldiers not to attempt a rescue, saying: "We will engage 
them to protect our territory. The two foreigners may be hurt, or worse still, 
get killed." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager said U.S. officials were glad to hear 
the two aid workers were safe. "We are urging their safe return soon," he said.

JUNE'S JOBLESSNESS RATE DIPS TO 5.2%;

<P>
The nation's unemployment rate fell slightly to 5.2% in June, despite a 
continued slump in the nation's manufacturing and construction sectors, the 
government said today. 
</P>
<P>
California's rate was 4.9%, down from 5.4% and outpacing performance in any of 
the 11 largest states. 
</P>
<P>
The nationwide civilian jobless rate, as measured by a household survey by the 
Labor Department, dropped from the 5.3% registered in May. The nation's 
unemployment rate has been fluctuating close to 5.3% for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
Private industries produced 92,000 new jobs last month, a weaker number than 
the 125,000 payroll additions private analysts had been calling for. 
</P>
<P>
Job growth figures are derived from a separate survey of business 
establishments. That is often considered a more reliable indicator of economic 
activity than the household survey from which the overall unemployment rate is 
calculated. 
</P>
<P>
Today's report, and its evidence of continued sluggishness, was likely to renew 
debate over whether the Federal Reserve should lower interest rates to spur 
economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fed is in a quandary now. From the job creation side, it's a clear case 
for the Fed to ease. But with unemployment so low, it's a very tough call," 
said Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Co. 
</P>
<P>
He said the weak job growth demonstrates that the economy is "as close to a 
recession configuration as we can get without being in one." 
</P>
<P>
Unemployment has managed to stay relatively low despite sluggish economic 
activity because the growth of the American work force "has almost ground to a 
halt in 1990," Sinai said. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, only about 290,000 Americans have entered the work force, 
compared with the 1.5 million Americans who joined the labor force during the 
first half of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's manufacturing sector, which has been on a downward spiral for 
months, continued its slide as factory payrolls fell by 31,000 jobs. It was the 
14th time in 15 months that manufacturing jobs declined. 
</P>
<P>
Since reaching a post-recession peak in March, 1989, about 335,000 factory jobs 
have been lost. 
</P>
<P>
The number of construction jobs fell for the fourth month in a row, reflecting 
continued weakness in the housing market, the government said. Construction 
payrolls, after seasonal adjustment, fell by 14,000. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the service sector, which has been providing most of the economy's 
steam over the past several months, added 83,000 jobs, including 40,000 in the 
health services industry. 
</P>
<P>
Retail trade businesses lost 7,000 jobs in June, bringing the monthly increases 
in the first half of this year in that sector to 15,000, half the average for 
1989. Wholesale trade added 7,000 jobs while business services added 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Labor costs, which have been pushing up and are being blamed for fueling the 
nation's inflation problems, continued to increase. 
</P>
<P>
Average hourly earnings posted a 0.3% rise in June to $10.01, up from the $9.98 
the average worker earned per hour in May. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said the federal government's hiring of census workers 
forced it to revise its May figure to 356,000 new jobs on non-farm payrolls, up 
from earlier estimates of 164,000 new jobs.

Gannett Co. today said that it expects its second quarter earnings to be lower 
than a year earlier, its first quarterly drop since the company went public 22 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Sheila Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the nation's biggest newspaper company, said 
Gannett would issue its actual earnings report for the April-June period in a 
few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Gannett stock was down 50 cents at $36.62 1/2 a share in midday trading on the 
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas McCorkindale, Gannett's vice chairman and chief financial officer, 
first projected an earnings decline during an interview published in today's 
editions of The Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
A decline in earnings would indicate how Gannett is being affected by a slump 
that has hit the entire newspaper industry. A number of Wall Street analysts 
have forecast declines for earnings of many newspaper publishers because of the 
soft ad revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"We started to see softness in advertising business in 1989, and have been 
getting softer in the last eight to 12 months," McCorkindale said. "We have not 
seen any signs of improved business conditions." 
</P>
<P>
The expected earnings decline would come at a difficult time for Gannett. 
</P>
<P>
The Gannett Foundation, the company's largest shareholder, announced April 26 
that it planned to sell its 10% stake. A weak stock price could make the 
company a possible takeover target.

Norway's state-owned Statoil oil company today shut down production on four of 
its seven platforms in the North Sea because of wildcat strikes that so far 
have cost the country about $95 million. 
</P>
<P>
Statoil chief Harald Norvik used loudspeakers aboard the offshore platforms 
today to announce his company's intention to fight the strikers, but the 
workers apparently paid little attention to his speech.

Westinghouse Electric Co., which offered to settle an age discrimination 
lawsuit two years ago for $35 million, has won the case in federal appeals 
court. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling Thursday, prompted by a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision, ended 
the court battle that began in 1983 when the federal Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission challenged Westinghouse for forcing laid-off employees 
to retire before age 70 because severance pay was not available. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement offer, which would have given about 4,000 retirees an average 
payment of $8,750, was rejected by government lawyers because they believed the 
workers would get more in court.

Cascio, the projectionist's invaluable assistant in "Cinema Paradiso," which 
won the Academy Award for best foreign film of 1989. "Everyone wants to have my

"Cinema Paradiso" was Salvatore's film debut. In fact, he had never seen a 
movie, because there was no theater in his hometown of Palermo, Sicily. 
</P>
<P>
"They made the selection among 300 children," he explained recently through an

then had another rehearsal, and I was ultimately picked.

"I wasn't nervous. I slept very well."

appearing with Mastroianni, Redgrave and Peter Ustinov, among others, and says

Yale's bowman was still checking his oarlock when the start was called, and he

Relief ace Mark Davis, a Cy Young Award winner at San Diego last season but a 
major disappointment for Kansas City this year, is going to get a chance at 
starting. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals announced that Davis will start in Sunday's game with the Tigers, 
his first appearance as a starter since June 19, 1987, when he was with the San 
Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an opportunity to get him some innings in a different role," said Manager 
John Wathan. "You keep looking for that right button to push for that switch to 
go on, and maybe this will be it." 
</P>
<P>
Wathan said he does not know if Davis will move into the starting rotation if 
he does well. He said it would be hard to find a regular spot for him if 
everybody on the pitching staff is healthy. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Gubicza was held out of his scheduled start Tuesday and isn't scheduled to 
pitch again until after the All-Star break. Storm Davis was scratched from his 
scheduled start against the Tigers Thursday and he was to have a sore knuckle 
on his right index finger examined today in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
As a reliever, Davis' record this year is 1-5 and his ERA is an unflattering 
5.40.

<TEXT>
<P>
Ivan Lendl's eternal quest for the Wimbledon title reached its annual dead end 
today against Stefan Edberg, who will face Boris Becker in the final for the 
third consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
The third-seeded Edberg did not lose his serve in the 6-1, 7-6, 6-3 victory 
over Lendl and never was seriously threatened by a man who has made no secret 
of his burning desire to win the only major title to have eluded him. 
</P>
<P>
Becker appeared rattled as he lost the first set 6-4 to hard-serving Goran 
Ivanisevic, the first unseeded player in the semifinals since 1986, but rallied 
against the 18-year-old. After coming within two points of losing the second 
set, the defending champion regained his confidence by winning a tie-breaker, 
then finished off Ivanisevic 6-0, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's final will have a familiar look. Becker defeated Edberg in three quick 
sets in last year's final, avenging his loss to the Swede in the 1988 
championship match. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl never seemed to warm up on a chilly day and at times exhibited the 
wooden, mechanical play he has struggled to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course it's disappointing when you lose and you don't play well," Lendl 
said. "I couldn't get into the match. He didn't give me anything and I couldn't 
create anything." 
</P>
<P>
Despite dedicating months of hard work to developing a serve-and-volley game, 
Lendl showed he still is no match at Wimbledon for a natural grass-court player 
such as Edberg. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt my first serve wasn't hurting him enough," Lendl said. "I felt I didn't 
move well, I was a half-step slow." 
</P>
<P>
Edberg lost only 20 points in his 15 service games and faced just one break 
point in the match, midway through the second set. 
</P>
<P>
"He put his aim on this and he tried everything he could do," Edberg said. "He 
must be feeling a little sad, but I have to do my job. I want to win this one." 
</P>
<P>
Lendl converted only 57% of his chances at the net, as opposed to 79% for 
Edberg. The top seed made 13 errors at the net, while Edberg had just five, and 
was passed 19 times. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg overwhelmed an erratic Lendl with two service breaks in the opening set. 
After each player held his serve throughout the second set, the Swede closed 
out a 7-2 tie-breaker with a pair of service return winners past a 
shell-shocked Lendl. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg broke Lendl's serve in the sixth game of the final set. 
</P>
<P>
Becker, after his match with Ivanisevic, paid tribute to the challenger who was 
playing in his first Wimbledon semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of the best grass-court matches I've ever played," Becker said. 
"He's got the hardest serve and the best serve of anybody I've ever played." 
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic, who beat Becker in the first round of last month's French Open, 
said his lack of big-match experience showed when he was serving for the second 
set. 
</P>
<P>
"At 6-5, I was thinking about going two sets up. I was thinking too much and I 
lost the game," he said. "If I had won the second set, maybe I would have won 
the third also." 
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic finished with 14 aces, one less than Becker. 
</P>
<P>
Today's defeat was a particularly bitter disappointment for Lendl. The 
Czechoslovak, based in Greenwich, Conn., passed up the French Open and spent 
three arduous months preparing on grass in Australia with coach Tony Roche 
grooming his serve and volley game. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, the world No. 1, said he will go through it all again next year in the 
hope of claiming the only Grand Slam crown that continues to elude him. 
</P>
<P>
"I still feel I have a few good years left," Lendl said. "I can imagine the 
time when I'm not going to be playing here anymore. But as long as I play, I'll 
give it my best shot." 
</P>
<P>
Lendl has won the U.S. and French Opens three times each and is a two-time 
Australian Open champion.

Garden Gal and Long Time Ago -- just a nose apart in their first starts, a 
maiden race that was one tick off the track record of 1:02 4/5 for 5 1/2 
furlongs -- head a field of 11 entered in Saturday's $100,000 Landaluce Stakes 
at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
The Landaluce, due to decide the 2-year-old filly championship of the current 
spring/summer meeting, is a Grade III event to be contested at six furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Gal, owned by Jan, Mace and Samantha Siegel, went wire-to-wire in 
winning her first outing in near-track record time. Martin Pedroza again will 
ride for trainer Brian Mayberry. 
</P>
<P>
Long Time Ago, a daughter of Conquistador Cielo trained by David Hofmans, was 
six lengths clear of the third place finisher in her debut. Kent Desormeaux 
will be back aboard the Golden Eagle Farm filly. 
</P>
<P>
Long Time Ago will race coupled with Alyfair, the daughter of Alydar who swept 
from 10th and last to win her racing bow on June 6 for trainer Richard 
Mandella. Laffit Pincay Jr. is the rider. 
</P>
<P>
Another leading contender is sure to be Sawsan, who broke her maiden at 
Hollywood Park by five lengths before going to Golden Gate Fields to win the 
Joy To The World Stakes by three lengths. Eddie Delahoussaye has the call for 
trainer Richard Mulhall. 
</P>

Moraga Handicap winner Annual Reunion will make her next appearance in Sunday's 
$150,000 Hollywood Oaks. A Grade I test, the Oaks promises to attract an 
abundance of class and speed. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like the race could be loaded with fillies who like to go to the 
front," noted trainer Gary Jones. "Fortunately for Annual Reunion, she likes to 
run at them from out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Bred in Kentucky by the John C. Mabees, Annual Reunion just missed in the 
recent Honeymoon Handicap, running second to Materco on June 2. 
</P>
<P>
"She may have come up a little short in that race," explained Jones. "I think 
the extra sixteenth on Sunday is just what she has wanted. If I were to concern 
myself with one particular detail, it would be coming from a turf race and 
running back on the dirt. Sometimes when these horses have the luxury of 
running on the turf, they don't seem to fire back on the dirt."

WORLD CUP FINAL;

<P>
TEAM FACTORS THAT MAY MAKE THE DIFFERENCE

The teams are the same, yet vastly different, as Argentina and West Germany 
settle the World Cup on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Argentina won the cup in 1986 against West Germany, runner-up in the last two 
world soccer championships. The coaches are the same: Franz Beckenbauer in his 
last game as boss of the Germans, and Carlos Bilardo. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the stars of four years ago remain, most notably Diego Maradona and 
Jorge Burruchaga for Argentina, and Lothar Matthaeus, Rudi Voeller and Thomas 
Berthold for West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The similarities, however, are overwhelmed by the contrasts. Such as the 
Germans having the easier time getting to the final this year, and the 
Argentines relying more on guile and luck than anything to get there. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, it was the exact opposite -- Argentina was expected to make the 
championship game, West Germany was a bit of a surprise and not particularly 
impressive in getting there. 
</P>
<P>
This time, it is West Germany that has the powerhouse offense and Argentina 
that needs to counterattack. 
</P>
<P>
In Mexico, both teams used different goalkeepers. Harald Schumacher was kicked 
off the West German team after a drug scandal, and Bodo Illgner took over in 
1987. Argentina's Nery Pumpido came to Italy as the No. 1 goalie, then broke 
his leg in the second game. His replacement, Sergio Goycoechea, has improved 
with each outing. 
</P>
<P>
For Argentina to spring an upset, Maradona must play at the level he reached in 
1986. So far, he has been hobbled by a sore ankle, thwarted by tight defense -- 
with as many as two men shadowing him -- and repeatedly fouled. 
</P>
<P>
"Watching Diego play on one leg has been an inspiration to all of us," said 
Claudio Caniggia, the team's best scorer who is suspended for the final. 
"Diego's leadership is more important than his goals." 
</P>
<P>
Not only will Caniggia be suspended, but three other players won't be available 
for Argentina -- defender Julio Olarticoechea and midfielders Sergio Batista 
and Ricardo Giusti. That hurts Argentina's defense most and that is no way to 
go into a match with West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The Germans have two major concerns in their third straight final, a record. 
First, they have come up short in such situations before, and, should they 
struggle, will the doubts begin to rise up again? Secondly, did they peak too 
soon? 
</P>
<P>
Beckenbauer's team surged through the first round, had little trouble with 
strong Dutch and Czechoslovak teams in the next two rounds, then struggled 
mightily against England. Sure, the Germans won the shoot-out, but they 
sputtered in the semifinal and that's no way to approach the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Argentina played by far its best game in beating Italy in another shoot-out. 
Both teams should approach the final with confidence, but Argentina's is 
soaring and West Germany's a little shakier. 
</P>
<P>
Prediction: Logic says West Germany. But logic has taken a holiday for most of 
this tournament.

LOS ALAMITOS; 
</P>
<P>
DASHING VAL EARLY FAVORITE IN CHICADO V 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what could be billed as a preview of the 1990 Los Alamitos Championship 
Invitational, stakes standout Dashing Val totes high weight against a field of 
all-star quarter horses in Sunday afternoon's $25,000 Chicado V Handicap at Los 
Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
Dashing Val has been made the 9-5 early favorite for the 400-yard showdown to 
post his fourth consecutive win. 
</P>
<P>
Here's the complete lineup from the rail out with riders and weights: Called To 
Account (Ralph Seville, 119), Dashing Val (Roman Figueroa, 125), Sig Hanson 
(Kenneth Hart, 118), TH Dasher (Eddie Garcia, 119), Heisajoy (James Lackey, 
123), Jazzing Hi (Bruce Pilkenton, 121), and Griswold (Danny Cardoza, 120). 
</P>
<P>
Dashing Val has been sensational since opening his 5-year-old campaign. After 
going winless last year, the son of Dash For Cash has rattled off three 
consecutive stakes wins this season. 
</P>
<P>
Heisajoy and Jazzing Hi are the two choices to upset Dashing Val. 
</P>
<P>
Heisajoy made his season debut on June 22 in the Double Bid Handicap. The 
gelding posted a three-quarter length win. The victory pushed Heisajoy's career 
record to 11 wins in 17 starts. 
</P>
<P>
Jazzing Hi turned heads at Los Alamitos on June 5 when Bruce Pilkenton piloted 
him to a neck verdict in the Vessels Maturity.

U.S. CUP PLANNERS FACE HARD QUESTIONS FROM WORLD PRESS

American organizers of the 1994 World Cup got a cool, almost hostile reception 
from the international media today when they held a news conference to discuss 
plans for the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred journalists gathered to hear Scott LeTellier, president of the 
World Cup '94 Organizing Committee; Werner Fricker, its chairman and president 
of the U.S. Soccer Federation, and Henry A. Kissinger, vice chairman of the 
organizing committee. 
</P>
<P>
Only when Kissinger spoke or was asked questions was the mood one of 
cooperation. Otherwise, most questions carried a confrontational tone. 
</P>
<P>
A South American broadcaster asked Fricker and LeTellier why the United States 
bothered bidding for the World Cup when soccer isn't a major sport there. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States is a tremendous soccer participation sport," said LeTellier, 
who worked on the organizing committee for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. "At a 
time when many European countries find the number of participants dwindling, 
the contrary is the case in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
To support that claim, Fricker cited studies that show soccer to be the 
third-most popular participation sport among teen-agers, behind only basketball 
and volleyball and ahead of baseball, softball, football and hockey, and second 
in the under-12 category behind basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether empty stadiums could be anticipated in 1994, Fricker said, "We 
will get total commitments, make every effort in every venue, to get a 
tremendous amount of enthusiasm generated. We will have other activities 
planned in communities to supplement (the soccer games)." 
</P>
<P>
Added LeTellier: "We have wrestled with efforts how to develop the intense 
feeling for the sport that is so evident here in Italy. One unique aspect as 
Americans is that we all came from other countries at some point. There is not 
one country that does not have a strong expatriate community in the United 
States." 
</P>
<P>
LeTellier pointed to the popularity Brazilians would have in Miami or Poles in 
Chicago, if their teams qualify. What he didn't say was that to get every team 
into areas where they are most popular would require a setup that runs contrary 
to the draw FIFA uses to determine each grouping. Under the current system, 
only the seeded teams automatically are placed in certain cities. 
</P>
<P>
Television also was on the minds of many. Since NBC already said it won't bid 
for rights and both CBS and ABC are likely to pass, it would appear cable TV 
will be the route organizers must take. 
</P>
<P>
"TV is a problem," Kissinger said. "But you can't judge by the 2% that this 
World Cup has gotten (in the ratings). TNT, which has televised the games, is 
cable and you have to subscribe and live in an area that can get cable. And it 
was not heavily advertised. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident and hopeful we will get reasonable television coverage. Even if 
not national, we will get local (coverage). I think we can solve this problem, 
but we have a lot of work to do." 
</P>
<P>
That the United States has no top-level league also troubled several 
questioners. Fricker insisted that a professional league will be developed and 
said international tournaments will be used to upgrade the standard of American 
soccer. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to do something to get high-quality soccer played in the United 
States," Kissinger said. "That is a way of getting it popular. It must be 
done."

10-ACRE BLAZE SNUFFED OUT ON P.V. PENINSULA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A 10-acre brush fire on the Palos Verdes Peninsula sent residents scrambling 
for their garden hoses when it came within a few yards of damaging expensive 
homes and nearly singed the Palos Verdes Golf Course Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, which broke out shortly after 3 p.m. in a grassy stretch of 
undeveloped Rancho Palos Verdes parkland, sent a tall column of whitish-yellow 
smoke wafting over the peninsula, dumping ash as it went. 
</P>
<P>
By 4:50 p.m., fire crews had controlled the blaze, which had crossed the city 
property, called Grandview Park, to Palos Verdes Estates. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen county fire engines and personnel from 15 different stations responded 
to the scene, Batallion Chief Robert Ericson said. Two water-dropping 
helicopters also joined the battle. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported, no homes were damaged, and no one was evacuated. The 
cause of the fire is under investigation, Ericson said. 
</P>
<P>
Anxious residents, remembering last week's devastating blazes in Santa Barbara 
and Glendale, watched as the flames descended a small canyon and began moving 
toward million-dollar homes along Barkstone Drive, Montemalaga Drive and Yellow 
Brick Road. 
</P>
<P>
The fire at one point was very near a new tract of mansions on Via La Cuesta in 
Palos Verdes Estates, where general contractor Bob York said he was just 
finishing work on the last of four homes valued at $3 million to $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just outside the tennis court of one house," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners said the fire originated in a gully near the end of Ironwood Street 
and Barkstone Drive and traveled north toward the golf course. 
</P>
<P>
"It burned a little behind the house and then ran straight down the hill," said 
Margaret Juneau, whose home on Barkstone Drive is near where the blaze began. 
"For a while we weren't sure which way it would go." 
</P>
<P>
The fire was blocked from reaching several houses by ice plant, a 
flame-resistant vegetation planted on the border of the field by several 
homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
"That stopped it around here," said Capt. Richard Davis, as he led a crew of 
firefighters digging a fire line in a portion of the field fronting homes on 
Barkstone Drive. "It's a great fire break." 
</P>
<P>
Light winds and a massive response by firefighters also contributed to a swift 
end to the blaze. "Luckily, it was slow moving," Ericson said. 
</P>
<P>
Contacted shortly after the fire broke out, Louise Anderson, who has lived in 
her Barkstone Drive home for 30 years, said she thought the flames were under 
control. 
</P>
<P>
Ten minutes later, Anderson's calm reserve was gone. 
</P>
<P>
"It just jumped the canyon and it's coming this way," she said when a reporter 
called a second time. "I've got to hang up now. I'm going to water down my 
yard." 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Putrino, a recreation supervisor for the city, said Rancho Palos 
Verdes' recreation plan calls for Grandview Park to be developed eventually as 
a hiking and picnic area. 
</P>
<P>
Until that time, she said, the land is plowed under annually to prevent brush 
build-up. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest brush fire to hit the Palos Verdes Peninsula occurred in 1973, when 
a blaze pushed by sea breezes charred 900 acres and destroyed 11 houses, 
causing an estimated $2 million in property damage.

A powerful bomb blew up today next to a downtown bus terminal used mainly by 
blacks, injuring at least 24 people. 
</P>
<P>
Police blamed right-wing extremists. 
</P>
<P>
The blast on a busy street during the morning rush hour sent concrete and 
debris hurtling through the air, a police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"There were rocks flying into the air. There was blood everywhere, people 
screaming and crying," said Nhlanhla Mbatha, who was waiting in line for a bus 
when the bomb went off. "It was only black people who got injured." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors said most of the 24 injuries were not grave. The independent South

HIT-MAKER RICHARD MARX DOESN'T SPLIT HAIRS; 
</P>
<P>
POP MUSIC: THE SINGER WITH THE FAMED MANE SHRUGS OFF HIS CRITICS AND LOOKS FOR 
RESPECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Marx leaned his head over the West Hollywood restaurant table and poked 
his fingers into the top of his notoriously lush mane. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see right here, I have no hair spray," the pop singer said. "I don't 
ever use hair spray. I just have thick hair, which I think (upsets) a lot of 
bald critics." 
</P>
<P>
Hair and critics are two things that often come to mind concerning Richard Marx 
-- and he's proven touchy on both subjects. 
</P>
<P>
Last year on "Late Night With David Letterman," Marx repeated David Lee Roth's 
famous line that critics seem to like Elvis Costello because they all look like 
him. And more recently he got into a verbal tiff with MTV veejay Adam Curry 
over who was the biggest hairhead. (Marx called Curry a "mousse endorsement.") 
</P>
<P>
But all Marx wants, he said, is a little respect. 
</P>
<P>
Like Billy Joel, an acknowledged role model, Marx professes that he is knocked 
simply for having hits and that he has been given an inaccurate image as a 
middle-of-the-road popster rather than a rock-oriented performer. 
</P>
<P>
The son of a jingle composer father and studio singer mother, Marx -- who plays 
the Greek Theatre on Saturday and Sunday -- is proud to consider himself a 
craftsman and is mystified that the critics won't take him on those terms. 
</P>
<P>
"When I read bad reviews of me and when I read slams in the press, I don't ever 
read, 'He doesn't sing well' or, 'He doesn't write melodic songs,' or 'He 
doesn't work hard on stage or produce good records,' " he said. "I read, 'His 
hair's too perfect.' " 
</P>
<P>
After having spent his teen years singing on jingles his father had written, 
Marx came to Hollywood from Chicago at 18 in 1982 at the invitation of Lionel 
Richie, who had heard a tape of his songs. 
</P>
<P>
Marx spent several years learning the studio system, having songs recorded by 
James Ingram, Kenny Rogers and Kim Carnes, doing background singing and 
performing in local mainstream clubs like Sasch in North Hollywood. At 23 his 
debut album was released by EMI records, with the first single, "Don't Mean 
Nothing," making it to No. 3 on the Billboard pop chart. 
</P>
<P>
Now at 26, Marx has had nine hit singles, including the recent Top 10 song 
"Children of the Night," a topical ballad that is the fifth hit from his 
3-million-selling second album, "Repeat Offender." 
</P>
<P>
Marx, who returns to his hometown Tuesday to sing the national anthem at 
Wrigley Field for the All-Star baseball game, believes critics let the looks of 
artists interfere with their judgment of them. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the critics necessarily hone in on the music and lyrics," he 
said, speaking genially, but making his point forcefully. "I think they look at 
the overall picture and if an artist doesn't fit the mold that they've placed 
for the artists they like, visually, then they like to beat them up." 
</P>
<P>
But Marx says that the negative reviews are easier to shrug off now than they 
were when they were new to him. His career and his personal life -- he and his 
wife, actress-singer Cynthia Rhodes, with whom he lives in the Hollywood Hills, 
are expecting their first child in September -- are satisfying enough that he 
can ignore the critics. 
</P>
<P>
"I do have a certain amount of satisfaction that somebody like Billy Joel has 
said he likes my music. And the truth is I have kind of griped and moaned that 
I get slammed so much in the press, but the truth is I knew before I even made 
a record that that would be the case, because I don't do the kind of music 
that's going to get me in good graces with the press, and that's OK." 
</P>
<P>
"Children of the Night" has also opened new creative avenues for him to 
explore. The song examines the plight of child prostitutes in Hollywood, with 
royalties from it earmarked for the assistance organization that gave the song 
its title. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a kid in Chicago I worried about whether I was going to pitch the 
next game, my term papers, whether a girl liked me," he said. "These kids, some 
of them 12- and 13-year-old girls, worry about, 'How do I get this guy out of 
my room now that I've had sex with him?' 
</P>
<P>
" 'Children of the Night' was a great exercise for me because I had to write 
about something that wasn't me. . . . After I wrote that song I started 
thinking not necessarily that I'm going to follow that road 100%, but if I can 
find other topics like that, it would inspire me to probably be better 
lyrically." 
</P>
<P>
And Marx even believes that someday that respect of peers and fans could rub 
off on the critics. Asked what a future rock history book might say about him, 
Marx answered confidently: 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to say, 'He took a lot of (flak) for along time, and now he's 
getting the respect he deserves.' That's what I hope."

to his lush hair than his craftsmanship, but he's not afraid to say things that 
may make them dislike him even more.

FRANK DEINY JR. OF BURBANK ASPIRES TO RACE WITH LIKES OF RICHARD PETTY ON 
WINSTON CIRCUIT

<P>
Up stepped Richard Petty, the King of them all. 
</P>
<P>
"Richard, do you remember Frank Deiny?" the man said by way of introduction. 
</P>
<P>
"Frank Deiny? Why, sure I do," Petty said. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, this is Frank Jr.," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Frank Jr.? How are you?" Petty said with renewed enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
The blond 17-year-old, slightly built at 5-foot-10 and 135 pounds, extended his 
hand. Frank Deiny Jr. eyed Petty with admiration but not awe. After all, one 
day this man could be his competitor. 
</P>
<P>
So it went last month at Sears Point Raceway where Frank Deiny Jr. of Burbank 
and his manager, Larry Smith, made the rounds at the Banquet Frozen Foods 300 
in Sonoma. Davey Allison, Dale Earnhardt, all the stars of the Winston Cup 
Series were introduced to Deiny. And, in turn, each brightened at the mention 
of Deiny's late, great father. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Deiny Sr. died of cancer in 1986 at age 50, leaving Frank Jr., a younger 
daughter, Diana, and wife Claudia. But while he lived, he cut a substantive 
figure in the racing community. First as a racer, when he was a champion at 
Saugus Speedway in 1966 and set a track record in 1965 by becoming the first 
man to win four consecutive main events. Then, after his racing career, as an 
engineer. 
</P>
<P>
Deiny could build cars with the best of them. He started making parts for his 
own cars, then became in demand by other drivers. He started a small business. 
The business grew. 
</P>
<P>
Deiny built cars for Petty, and other notables in the racing community -- from 
the ground up -- and eventually moved to the spacious warehouse at Speedway 
Engineering in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
But the competitive blood never left him, and in his bright-eyed boy he saw an 
opportunity to carry on the Deiny name in the racing arena. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Jr. never doubted that he wanted to race cars. When he was 3 1/2, he 
drove his first Midget car. 
</P>
<P>
Being a Deiny, Frank Jr. naturally aims high. In fact, his most common catch 
phrase -- "If I'm going to do it, I'm going to do it right" -- speaks volumes 
for this young man who is mature beyond his years. 
</P>
<P>
Petty? Allison? Earnhardt? Sure, they are legends. But one day soon, Frank 
Deiny Jr. plans to be right next to them, burning rubber and flying for that 
checkered flag. 
</P>
<P>
"It was (impressive meeting them)," he said. "But I'm trying to be a 
businessman. I can't be in awe of another guy, because then he has something 
over you for when you get there. Because I will be racing against those guys I 
met." 
</P>
<P>
Currently, Deiny is between his junior and senior years at Burbank High. He 
races in the USAC Western States three-quarter Midget circuit for crew chief 
and mentor Larry Hart, a friend of his father's. Deiny, who finished second 
last year in the competition for rookie of the year, is 10th in the points 
standings. 
</P>
<P>
But Deiny is at a more defined stage. He is in the first step of the three-step 
grand plan designed by his father. The elder Deiny, fearing for his son's 
safety, wanted him to give up driving before an accident occurred. But Deiny's 
mother knowing how much racing meant to her son, pleaded the boy's case. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Sr. relented, and, following the family creed -- "If he's going to do it, 
he's going do it right" -- plotted a course for young Frank. 
</P>
<P>
Step one: To race three-quarter Midgets. 
</P>
<P>
Step two: In two summers, to race back east in the Busch Grand National 
Circuit. 
</P>
<P>
Step three: To race in the prestigious Winston Cup Series. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes well -- meaning Frank Jr. drives well enough to attract a major 
sponsor -- he will reach step three by age 22. Which leaves plenty of years for 
big-time racing. 
</P>
<P>
To facilitate the plan, Frank Jr. plans to attend college in North Carolina, in 
the southeastern United States, the hotbed of racing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to major in business management," he said. "So when I retire from 
racing, I can come back and run (Speedway Engineering)." 
</P>
<P>
And to think, the average teen-ager's most pressing matter is getting a date on 
Friday night. But Frank Jr. is no ordinary teen-ager. He carried a 4.0 
grade-point average at Burbank -- until he received a B in chemistry last 
semester -- and is MVP of the school golf team. Deiny is a young man who 
decided at an early age that if he was going to live life, he was, well, he was 
going to do it right. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom's the real stickler," he said, grinning sheepishly. "She wants me to 
get straight A's. She thinks I'm Superman or something. I come home from a race 
and she says, 'You done with your homework yet?' " 
</P>
<P>
School is a priority. But racing, in Frank Jr.'s own words, "comes first." 
Literally. Before Frank Jr. ever crossed a school's doorstep, he had 
experienced the feel of a wheel in his innocent young grip. 
</P>
<P>
After a trip to an old quarter-Midget track in Northridge in 1976, the elder 
Deiny noticed his son's enthusiasm -- present at even that early age. 
</P>
<P>
"Would you like to drive these?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, yeah, that'd be really neat," Frank Jr. recalls saying. 
</P>
<P>
Father put son in a Midget car, where the youngster sat happily behind a wheel. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you really want one of these?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, yeah." 
</P>
<P>
The next night, Frank Deiny Jr. -- at age 3 1/2 -- was the proud owner of a 
real quarter-Midget car. From there, his racing career sped off. At age 5, he 
consistently broke the Junior Novice qualifying record. He won the 
Quarter-Midget Grand National Championship Junior Stock title in 1980, the 
Light Modified National Championship in '81 and the Light B Class title in '83. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he was the only driver to win the state Monza Championship five 
years in a row. All told, through 1988, Deiny was eight-time consecutive 
national quarter-Midget champion and eight-time state champion. 
</P>
<P>
He began racing three-quarter Midgets last year and by his fourth race -- his 
first at Saugus Speedway -- had won a main event.

CITY AIDS OFFICIAL RESIGNS FOR HEALTH, PERSONAL REASONS 
</P>

<P>
Dave Johnson, Los Angeles' first AIDS coordinator, is resigning, both for 
health reasons and a desire to be a "full-time activist" in the battle against 
the fatal disease. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was appointed to the $45,000-a-year city post in July, 1989, to help 
address housing, education and medical needs of AIDS victims. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement Tuesday, Mayor Tom Bradley said Johnson "has been compassionate, 
forthright, and determined in his efforts to improve access to AIDS education 
and treatment to those who might otherwise not receive this assistance." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 35, himself was diagnosed with AIDS-related complex three years ago. 
In an interview Thursday, he said he had been taking treatments, such as the 
drug AZT. 
</P>
<P>
"The existing treatments only last two to three years," the Van Nuys resident 
said. "For me, some of the existing treatment options are wearing off. The 
disease is progressing." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson has lost 15 pounds from his normal 185-pound weight in the last six 
weeks and, he added: "It's very difficult to keep a 50-hour-a-week pace running 
temperatures every day." 
</P>
<P>
A tall, dark-haired man with rings under his eyes from evident fatigue, Johnson 
spoke in his office at the Community Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
The room was simply furnished, with no personal touches, except a bulletin 
board filled with lists of AIDS-related "tasks" to accomplish. People who know 
Johnson say such "tasks" as public advocacy, housing, and public awareness have 
occupied most of his time. 
</P>
<P>
"He knew there was so much to be done and obviously it's taken a toll on his 
health," said Rick Abeyta, associate director of Being Alive, a Hollywood-based 
AIDS support group, after learning of Johnson's resignation. "It's 
disheartening." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he will stay in the job until September, when he hopes a successor 
will be in place. But he still plans to "be involved, as a writer and as an 
activist. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I see this as a freeing thing. I can devote myself full time to activism, as I 
have the energy." 
</P>
<P>
Although he was in the coordinator's job -- which he believes is the only one 
in the country held by someone from the AIDs-affected community -- for only a 
year, Johnson said, "I feel secure a firm foundation has been laid." 
</P>
<P>
The city has made several advances in the battle against the disease, Johnson 
said, including: 
</P>
<P>
* $2 million of city funds budgeted for construction of AIDS hospices, or other 
shelters for victims. 
</P>
<P>
* $85,000 in the last fiscal year, and $500,000 in the 1990-91 fiscal year, 
allocated for the distribution of AIDS prevention kits -- including condoms and 
bleach for sterilizing needles used by intravenous drug users; early treatment 
and awareness programs in minority communities such as South-Central and East 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also brought attention to the converging issues of AIDS and 
homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
"We're finding alarming rates of HIV positive among the chronically homeless in 
places like Skid Row," he said, "as high as 20%." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also sought to expand services to minority sufferers of AIDS, among 
whom, he said, "the disease is progressing faster, because of a lack of access 
to information and treatment." At the same time, he added, "People with color 
will soon be the majority of people with AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson believes AIDS awareness is "mainly a matter of communication." He said 
it is a constant battle to get people to recognize that it is "their problem. 
People don't want to look at it, first because of who it affects, and because 
nobody wants to look at a frightening, contagious, fatal illness. That's human 
nature." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson first became an activist for gay and lesbian rights in the early 1970s 
as a student at UCLA, he said, heading the UCLA Gay Students Union and helping 
to create the first Gay and Lesbian Awareness Week, which has become an annual 
campus event. 
</P>
<P>
By the early 1980s, Johnson had taken on a "mainstream, fairly regular career 
path" as a data processing project manager for May Co. department stores. " I 
settled on a wonderful relationship," he said, "and then friends began to die. 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
First his lover, and then an old college friend, succumbed to AIDS. Johnson 
quit his job in 1987 to work against the disease. 
</P>
<P>
"I remembered my old political activism . . . ," he said. "The analogy I used 
was how the war must have been for my parents' generation. . . . I had to 
enlist until it's over just as my father did after Pearl Harbor was attacked." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his accomplishments, Johnson said he believes even more activism is 
needed now, "more likely in the streets, which is where the battle is going." 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, in fact, Johnson has been arrested three times while 
participating in public demonstrations for more medical treatments and more 
funding for AIDS patients. Last month, he was among seven protesters arrested 
at a county Board of Supervisors' meeting, part of an ongoing set of 
demonstrations to persuade board members to increase funding for AIDS services. 
He faces a city attorney's hearing in August for disrupting a public assembly. 
</P>
<P>
"The epidemic is getting worse and the government is turned off and the media 
has been turned off," Johnson said. "The only thing that works is taking to the 
streets. I think there will have to be much more civil disobedience in the best 
tradition of the civil rights movement." 
</P>
<P>
Such tactics, Johnson believes, are the only way to break the tide of 
indifference toward the disease and its victims. 
</P>
<P>
Many people in power, he said Thursday, "do understand what a holocaust this 
is. And it's fine with them." 
</P>
<P>
"I think, ultimately, the gay community and other communities affected by this 
disease have to face the fact and mount an eloquent, powerful political 
response."
