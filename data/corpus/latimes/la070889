R. S. NEUSCHATZ; SERVED ON L.A. PARKS BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Royce Schaffer Neuschatz, former Los Angeles City Recreation and Parks 
commissioner and a regional planning consultant, died Saturday of cancer in 
Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
She was 56 and was on the faculty of the Department of Landscape Architecture, 
School of Environmental Design, at Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Ms. Neuschatz was a regional planner for the Southern California Assn. of 
Governments from 1972 to 1975, helping coordinate open-space planning and park 
bond programs, and served on the Recreation and Parks Commission from 1978 to 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
She was an ardent proponent of parkland while on the commission, voting against 
efforts to establish a landfill in Griffith Park and the construction of the 
Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum at the same park. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service will be held at 10:30 a.m. Wednesday at the old zoo picnic 
area in Griffith Park.

ELVERA K. LACK; LANDOWNER'S DAUGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Elvera Keating Lack, the last of eight children of Andrew J. W. Keating, who at 
one time owned 64,000 acres between West Los Angeles and Santa Monica, died 
Sunday in Brentwood where she had lived much of her life. 
</P>
<P>
She was 102. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Lack -- who was married first to John A. Forthmann, son of the founder of 
the Los Angeles Silk Co., and later to George M. Lack, a Brawley real estate 
developer -- inherited with her mother, brothers and sisters the acreage on 
which Culver City sits today. 
</P>
<P>
After Keating's death in a shipwreck in 1901 the land -- situated roughly 
between La Brea Avenue, La Cienega Boulevard, Pico Boulevard and southwest to 
today's Marina del Rey -- was tied up in court for several years until the 
youngest child turned 21. (Two of Keating's sons died in the shipwreck with 
him.) 
</P>
<P>
The family gradually sold it between 1911 and 1920. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most significant parcel was 93 acres of barley fields purchased by 
Harry Culver for a $2,000 option. Culver City was later incorporated in 1917. 
</P>
<P>
Keating was British by birth and a Chilean nitrate magnate by profession when 
he purchased in 1892 what came to be known as Rancho Bonita Meadows. The 
Keating family used it originally as a winter home.

What's the controversy? 
</P>
<P>
There's a simple rule in baseball and everybody knows it. You don't bet on 
ballgames. Pete Rose knew the rule; and if he ignored the rule, he has to go. 
</P>
<P>
No more megabuck contracts and $15 autographs. No more big league perks. He's 
not going to be special anymore, and for a guy like him, that's probably the 
worst punishment of all.

NICKLAUS' NEW COURSE OUT OF BOUNDS FOR MANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have admired Jack Nicklaus, the golfer and the man, for nearly 30 years. His 
contributions to the game are legend. And yet . . . 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus' course design for David Murdock's enclave for the super rich, the 
Lake Sherwood Country Club, further divides the game of golf between the 
ultra-haves and the not-so-lucky. 
</P>
<P>
The nature of Lake Sherwood's shrine to grandiosity is to be found in the 
quaint Marie Antoinette style of its publicity. The first 300 "deemed worthy" 
(and who can come up with $100,000) will be admitted. 
</P>
<P>
It is not the best of all worlds when the words wealthy and worthy are 
seemingly synonymous.

WINNERS TESTED THEIR METAL IN CLASSIC CAR RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A parade of classic automobiles chugged, roared and rumbled across the finish 
line of the 3,660-mile Great American Race in Anaheim on Friday with drivers 
from Texas and Indiana in the lead. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-day race, which started June 26 in Norfolk, Va., ended in the 
turn-of-the-century atmosphere of Disneyland's Town Square as a Navy band feted 
the winners. 
</P>
<P>
A field of 120 autos built before 1936 competed in the coast-to-coast contest. 
Drivers came from the United States, Japan, Canada, India, Switzerland and 
Great Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Well-known makes such as Jaguars, Model Ts and Rolls-Royces competed with such 
obscure cars as a 1902 Mors and a Locomobile along a circuitous route that took 
them through Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, the Southwest and on to 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate sponsors put up $250,000 in prize money for the seventh annual race. 
</P>
<P>
The big winner was Dick Burdick, 60, of Rosanky, Tex., who took home $50,000 
for coming in first overall in his 1924 Bentley. The touring car was one of 
three he entered and one of more than 50 classics he and his family display in 
a museum near Austin. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the competition and we just got really, really lucky this year," 
Burdick said. 
</P>
<P>
Burdick's team also raced a 1905 De Detrich, an open-wheeled racing car that he 
said was once buried in a French barn to avoid confiscation by the German army 
during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Burdick, a manufacturer of electric heating cable, said the $50,000 would come 
"pretty close" to covering the cost of running the race. 
</P>
<P>
Top honors in the "brass badge" division for racing cars went to David Kleptz, 
33, of Terre Haute, Ind., who drove a 1912 Haynes. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have to do a thing to the car except add about a quart and a half of 
oil a day," said Kleptz, who works in his family's building-supply business. 
"Our support van was the one that kept breaking down." 
</P>
<P>
Kleptz scoffed at the idea that the cars, some of them nearly 90 years old, 
were better off in a museum than on the road. 
</P>
<P>
"If old man Ford were to come back, he'd be appalled that these cars are kept 
locked up," Kleptz said. "They were made to be driven."

YOUNG SAILORS GET THEIR FEET WET, REGATTA-WISE, IN THE DUTCH SHOE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was the kind of feat of skill and daring that might have made Dennis Conner 
proud. 
</P>
<P>
But, more likely, he would have been envious of 14-year-old Bill Hardesty, who 
on Friday afternoon confidently skippered a red, white and blue dinghy into 
Coronado Bay to capture first place in the Dutch Shoe Regatta. 
</P>
<P>
The Dutch Shoe is a 20-year-old competition for sabots -- small, single-sail 
boats that resemble wooden shoes, but often act like bathtubs, once on the 
water. The boats, which can easily fill with water or capsize, are standard 
training equipment for beginning sailors on the West Coast. Conner, winner of 
the America's Cup, reportedly began his career in such a craft. 
</P>
<P>
"I sailed smart," explained Hardesty, with Conner-esque self-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seasoned Sailor 
</P>
<P>
A surfer and soon-to-be freshman at Point Loma High School, Hardesty is a 
fairly seasoned junior skipper. With four years of experience, he was an 
advanced sailor among the 140 participants -- some as young as 10 years old -- 
in the annual event, sponsored by the San Diego Yacht Club. 
</P>
<P>
But sabots, as many of the regatta's participants discovered, are not a force 
easily reckoned with. 
</P>
<P>
"Consider getting onto a warm, plastic Tupperware trash can cover on ice, and 
try to stand up and move around. When you're first learning to sail a sabot, 
that's what it feels like," said Dave Folsom, a spokesman for the event. 
</P>
<P>
Combine that with a 6-mile course, threading its way from Shelter Island to 
Coronado Bay through tanker and barge traffic, insensitive wakes and impish 
winds, and you've got yourself one heck of a . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Cinch," Hardesty said, a few minutes after his craft passed a cheering crowd 
at the finish line. "I didn't really have any problems." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Hardesty, an A-class competitor from the Mission Bay Yacht Club, did 
have one problem: Lizzie Collins, a competitor in the lower B class from the 
Newport Harbor Yacht Club in Newport Beach. She led the race most of the way. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Changing Lead 
</P>
<P>
But neither Collins nor Hardesty was ahead of the fleet in the beginning. When 
the gun was fired at noon Friday near Shelter Island, it was Chris Wright of 
the San Diego Yacht Club, a C-class skipper, who first sailed smoothly out of 
the jumble of dinghies. 
</P>
<P>
The first 45 minutes of the three-hour marathon, however, were nullified after 
a huge Navy tanker divided the fleet of sabots near North Island, prompting 
officials to restart the event. 
</P>
<P>
This time Collins, capitalizing on a clean, plucky downwind, jumped out in 
front and led the pack for the next two hours as the fleet wound its way down 
the San Diego Bay channel. 
</P>
<P>
"The start is everything," said Melinda Carroll, 19, a former B-class winner 
who watched the race from one of 23 rescue boats accompanying the sabot fleet. 
"After that, it's a matter of staying as close as possible to the wind and 
always keeping your head in the game." 
</P>
<P>
Hardesty, who placed second behind Carroll in her 1985 victory, eventually 
overtook Collins under the Coronado Bridge, where the sailors tacked their 
boats, trying to catch the best wind. 
</P>
<P>
Collins was not to be disappointed, however. The sailor captured first place in 
the B class. Mandy McDonnell of the Lido Isle Yacht Club of Newport Beach led 
the C class. About 10 skippers failed to finish, event organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
"The big bay is like an ocean to some of these kids," said Joni Palmer, 
director of the junior program at the San Diego Yacht Club. "I think for those 
who made it -- there are some who have never raced this before -- it's a big 
accomplishment."

GOVERNOR CUTS FREELY AT FUNDS FOR COUNTY 
</P>

<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian's blue pencil fell heavy on San Diego County Friday as 
he vetoed millions of dollars in local projects before signing the state's 
$49.3-billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the cuts, Deukmejian left intact legislation sponsored by Assemblyman 
Robert C. Frazee (R-Carlsbad) to set aside $500,000 to help build migrant 
farm-worker housing in North County, a proposal that the governor disallowed 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm extremely pleased that there is recognition that the homeless problem is 
much greater than the usual view of people wandering on the streets in the 
inner-city," Frazee said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Deukmejian vetoed the $500,000 migrant housing request after 
explaining that "there did not seem to be community support for the program," 
Frazee said. 
</P>
<P>
That observation prompted Frazee to pull together community activists and other 
local governmental officials in a task force to address the problem and send a 
message to the governor that San Diego County needs the housing to help farm 
workers now living in makeshift huts in North County ravines and canyons. 
</P>
<P>
"They are economic contributors to our society, and there's a recognition that 
there needs to be participation by all levels of government in solving the 
problem," he said, adding that the one-time $500,000 appropriation is intended 
to be used as "seed" money for housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lost Out on Parks, Education 
</P>
<P>
While the county picked up money for farm-worker housing, it lost several key 
park and higher education projects in Deukmejian's quest to trim $489 million 
-- or 1% -- of the spending plan sent to him by the Legislature last week. 
</P>
<P>
Gone is $375,000 set aside by the Legislature to pay for restoration of Mission 
Bay, which has been bedeviled by a series of sewage spills in recent years. 
Also gone is $4.7 million lawmakers set aside for a new chemistry and geology 
building at San Diego State University. 
</P>
<P>
Another cut erased $2.7 million for the purchase of the Bohannon Pottery 
Village as part of the Old Town State Park, described by Assemblywoman Lucy 
Killea (D-San Diego) as one of the biggest losses in this year's budget wars. 
</P>
<P>
Killea and other legislators wanted to purchase the village property to create 
a formal entrance to the popular tourist attraction. "That's something we can 
come back on and recoup next year," Killea said. "I intend to work on it." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian also deleted $1.2 million that state Sen. William A. Craven 
(R-Oceanside) wanted to buy 2.15 acres close to the Torrey Pines State Beach 
and Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
An aide to Craven said Friday that the money was not a new appropriation, but 
was actually money left over from another, unsuccessful San Diego County park 
project that was included in the governor's proposed budget earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"We just wanted to keep the money in San Diego and he turned us down," said 
Scott Johnson, the aide. "We asked for a little and got less. We're disgusted." 
</P>
<P>
The scenic property, owned by former San Diego Charger Lance Alworth, is at 
Camino del Mar and Carmel Valley Road and has been openly coveted by 
environmentalists ever since Alworth announced plans to develop a restaurant 
and office building there. 
</P>
<P>
Other San Diego County items cut from the budget include: 
</P>
<P>
* $75,000 for the Regional Water Quality Control Board to help coordinate a 
multi-agency effort to clean up San Diego Bay. 
</P>
<P>
* $55,000 to establish a temporary San Diego field office for the state's 
Public Utilities Commission, which will be considering the fate of the proposed 
San Diego Gas &amp; Electric merger with Southern California Edison. 
</P>
<P>
* $500,000 set aside to help the PUC pay for "public education, understanding 
and participation" in the proposed merger deliberations. The governor said the 
PUC's division of ratepayer advocates should handle such a task. "It would be 
inappropriate for a government entity to collect funds for the type of 
informational activities specified in this provision," Deukmejian wrote in his 
veto message. 
</P>
<P>
* Two appropriations to UC San Diego, one for $428,000 to research alternatives 
to animal experiments and the other for $300,000 to conduct aquaculture and 
fisheries research. 
</P>
<P>
The governor also slashed two-thirds of a proposed $75 million in extra money 
to go for mental health programs statewide. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of San Diego County, that cut means local mental health programs will 
receive an estimated $3.2 million instead of the nearly $6 million in extra 
funds set aside by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
But Deukmejian also took steps to help San Diego County -- and others that have 
been traditionally under-funded for mental health programs -- in the long run 
by making sure a special formula is used to help them catch up. 
</P>
<P>
The formula was written into state law three years ago and directs that at 
least half of all increases in the mental health budget go toward those 
under-funded counties. But a legislative conference committee, at the behest of 
Los Angeles lawmakers, changed that language to minimize the so-called 
equalization. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian deleted the conference committee language and restored the special 
formula that favors the under-funded counties such as San Diego.

HEDGECOCK CASE STATEMENT CLEARED FOR HOOVER TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The judge in the Nancy Hoover Hunter fraud trial ruled Friday that parts of a 
statement, signed by Hunter in a plea-bargain agreement in the case of illegal 
funding of Roger Hedgecock's 1983 mayoral campaign, can be introduced as 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
However, it remains unclear how prosecutors will be able to introduce the 
edited statement as evidence because they have no witnesses who can testify 
about the document. 
</P>
<P>
Although U. S. District Judge Earl B. Gilliam has ruled that the jury cannot be 
told about Hunter's previous conviction, he said he will allow jurors to see 
the portions of the statement that contain background material on Hedgecock's 
connection to J. David &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
"She confessed to conduct that is direct evidence of the crimes in this case," 
argued Assistant U. S. Atty. Stephen Clarke. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Funding Link? 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors want to use the statement because it supports their contention that 
Tom Shepard &amp; Associates, the firm that managed Hedgecock's campaign, was 
set up specifically to illegally funnel money into the successful mayoral 
campaign. Clarke said that, in the statement, Hunter admits financing the 
Hedgecock campaign with J. David funds and acknowledges discussing the campaign 
before the establishment of Tom Shepard &amp; Associates. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter was the primary financial backer of the company, and, if it was set up 
for illegal campaign contributions, then the losses she claimed on her 1983 tax 
returns are also illegal. Tax evasion for the years 1980 through 1983 are four 
of the 234 counts that Hunter is facing in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Shepard, who testified in June about the statement he signed in his plea 
bargain stemming from the Hedgecock scandal, vehemently denied that his firm 
was established with Hedgecock in mind. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Richard Marmaro warned Gilliam that, "in a worst-case 
scenario," allowing the statement into evidence would require a retrial of the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a statement about the Ponzi (scheme)," Marmaro said. "It's not about 
the tax case. It's a statement about the Hedgecock case." 
</P>
<P>
Marmaro also argued that the statement should not be introduced because it 
would force Hunter to take the stand to explain her previous statements. 
</P>
<P>
But Gilliam overruled this objection, saying it is up to the defense to 
determine a way around this obstacle.

USD STUDENT CHARGED IN CROSS BURNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY MILLICAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A University of San Diego fraternity member has been charged with a misdemeanor 
in connection with a cross burning on Torrey Pines State Reserve in May. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Schizas, 21, was notified Wednesday by the city attorney's office to 
appear in court Sept. 6 on a charge of starting a fire in an area of the park 
where burning is prohibited, said Deputy City Atty. Kim-Thoa Hoang. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six others who took part in the Sigma Chi fraternity ritual May 20 will 
not be prosecuted, Hoang said. The evidence against the others was not strong 
enough to warrant charges, Hoang said. 
</P>
<P>
Schizas, who could not be reached for comment, could be sentenced to a maximum 
of 90 days in jail and a $1,000 fine if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Official Disappointed 
</P>
<P>
Bob Wohl, park supervisor at the Torrey Pines Reserve, said the decision not to 
prosecute the other fraternity members was "a disappointment but 
understandable." 
</P>
<P>
Wohl, who discovered the group planting and lighting the wooden cross on an 
isolated bluff, had hoped the other fraternity members would be charged with 
unlawful assembly. 
</P>
<P>
"We did feel they were culpable and accountable," but there were constitutional 
issues raised in charging unlawful assembly in the public park, Wohl said. 
</P>
<P>
Schizas identified himself the night of the incident as spokesman and 
coordinator of the ritual and was the only one to give statements that would 
hold up in court, Hoang said. 
</P>
<P>
Schizas signed a written statement the night of the incident describing the 
ritual as a religious initiation rite that dates back to the Roman Emperor 
Constantine. 
</P>
<P>
Another fraternity member who confessed to the cross burning was not read his 
rights, Hoang said. 
</P>
<P>
Wohl said the others involved in the incident "haven't gotten away scot-free." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of attention and outrage has been focused on the fraternity," Wohl said. 
"The community as a whole was quite revolted at the thought of burning crosses 
as a sign of religious devotion." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Symbolic Ritual 
</P>
<P>
The initiation ritual, the fraternity has said, symbolically rids budding 
fraternity members of their faults, making them worthy of membership. 
</P>
<P>
A letter, released by Sigma Chi fraternity members shortly after the incident, 
apologized for the carelessness in starting a fire in the natural reserve, 
which is covered with dry brush and is home to the rare Torrey Pine tree. 
</P>
<P>
Fraternity members maintained the cross burning was not racially motivated or 
cult linked, but "was meant to inspire our new associates."

BUSH ON A POLISH TIGHTROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush, who leaves for Poland on Sunday, will arrive at a time of great 
hope and great frustration: great hope for Poland's tantalizing new promise of 
democracy, great frustration because both Poles and Americans think he can make 
their dreams come true. He can't. 
</P>
<P>
Poland faces twin crises: one economic, the other political. Poland owes $39 
billion to foreign creditors, and its economy is further weakened by serious 
structural flaws. The Polish political system is struggling to shed its 
authoritarian cast and find a way to accommodate the new and awkward alliance 
between the Communist Party and the labor union Solidarity. Both situations are 
in flux. 
</P>
<P>
No matter who is in charge, Poland faces severe austerity in the years ahead. 
And neither Solidarity nor the Communist Party wants to prescribe that bitter 
medicine. The Polish people hope that Bush will bring a miracle cure for their 
ills, preferably in the form of cold cash or debt forgiveness. He cannot and 
should not. Instead, he should go ahead with his plan to offer a moderate, 
sensible package of debt rescheduling and trade incentives, including 
most-favored-nation status. 
</P>
<P>
On the political front, Bush will have to tread carefully, deferring both to 
the ruling party and Solidarity. Although American values and sympathies 
necessarily side with the trade union, Solidarity is not yet willing or able to 
take over the government completely. Its best bet is to keep cooperating with 
the current government, allowing the old order to take the blame for the coming 
austerity. Bush should not try to interfere in relations between Solidarity and 
the Communist Party or seem to favor one side at the expense of the other. 
Poland's best hope lies in their cooperation; Bush should simply bestow an 
American blessing on the still-fragile partnership. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the President should not give in to the temptation to take advantage 
of Poland's new stirrings of democracy, either by gloating over the decline in 
communism or by grandly welcoming Poland to the West. Neither Poland's 
conservatives nor the Soviets are ready for political grandstanding, as 
Gorbachev openly warned this week. Stability in Europe, ironically, now rests 
on the stability of the Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the Bush Administration seems to understand these dangers and is 
actively seeking to lower public expectations for the visit, especially in 
Poland. Unfortunately, sweet assurances offer poor comfort to the hungry and 
the anxious.

THE PERILS OF CONFRONTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Supported by many of the finance ministers of Africa, the United Nations 
Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) has called for an alternative to the tough 
structural adjustment programs imposed on African nations by the World Bank, 
the International Monetary Fund and the major aid-giving nations, led by the 
United States. The move invites a confrontation that could endanger the already 
meager flow of funds to the desperate African nations. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the initiative is a controversy over whether the bitter medicine being 
administered by major sources of money, including the World Bank and IMF, has 
been working. A report by the World Bank in March argued that nations adopting 
strong reform programs are indeed doing better than the others. The ECA 
disagrees and, in a report released Thursday, concluded that "more often than 
not, even the positive results that might be achieved through the conventional 
programs, could be outweighed by . . . negative consequences." 
</P>
<P>
ECA's report promotes the "African Alternative Framework," a complex formula 
for a "more human-centered development process." It would modify the existing 
emphasis on reduced budgets, traditional export promotion, credit squeezes, 
free trade and what the authors of the new study call "doctrinaire 
privatization." The report is laudable in its sensitivity to the dimension of 
suffering in Africa, its recognition of the importance of agriculture and its 
candid recognition of African weaknesses, including the centralized, 
non-democratic governments that prevail. It calls for "a prominent focus" on 
such things as "employment generation for the majority of the population, 
equitable income distribution especially to households and vulnerable groups 
and the satisfaction of the essential needs of the people." But World Bank 
officials can argue persuasively that the best way to address those problems is 
to make growth the first priority, increasing the size of the pie, rather than 
making equitable divisions of an admittedly inadequate pie the first priority. 
</P>
<P>
Adebayo Adedeji, the respected Nigerian executive secretary of the ECA, is the 
moving spirit behind the report. Through it, he is asking the sources of 
external credit and aid to soften the conditions imposed on recipients and to 
provide funds on more flexible terms, trusting that the money will be 
well-spent. But the report admits that "government interventions in Africa have 
so far become discredited, not because there is an effective alternative in the 
form of efficient market mechanism, but because of inefficient management, poor 
results and misallocation of resources." 
</P>
<P>
The report's lack of confidence in the private sector raises the danger of 
allowing Africa to repeat the errors of the past when bureaucracies paralyzed 
progress. If nothing else, the report may serve to underscore one issue on 
which all agree, and that is the desperate need for more money. The United 
States, for example, has failed to provide the increased aid promised in 
exchange for economic reform, but the debt relief plan announced Thursday by 
President Bush will help many nations significantly. 
</P>
<P>
Africa stands out among the developing continents, the only region where there 
has been a decline in almost every element of society and the economies. Unlike 
Asia and Latin America, Africa is seeing a steady decline in per capita food 
supplies and per capita gross national product, despite what had been a 
relatively high flow of aid. That has now reversed into a net outflow because 
of declining new credits and debt repayment burdens. Internal organizational 
failures have been made worse by the collapse of prices for primary commodities 
on which most African nations depend for export earnings. Droughts and civil 
wars have compounded the misery, flooding already impoverished nations with 
tens of thousands of refugees from neighboring states. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the ECA report's proposals may contribute constructively to fine-tuning 
the essential reforms to minimize the impact on the already impoverished 
people. It may be possible to do that without turning off the flow of resources 
so urgently needed. That, however, will require a process of collaboration and 
consultation rather than the confrontation that appears implicit in the new 
report.

THE LUNACY OF VENGEANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lebanon-based Islamic Jihad, which appears to exist only to engage in 
murder, kidnaping and terrorism, says it was behind this week's bus tragedy in 
Israel and hails as "heroic" that revolting act of homicidal lunacy. Newspapers 
in a number of Arab countries have similarly rushed to salute the supposed 
courage of the Palestinian Arab who forced the commuter bus off the Tel 
Aviv-Jerusalem highway, killing 14 and injuring more than a score of others. In 
Israel, meanwhile, in the aftermath of the crime, a few hundred followers 
respond to Rabbi Meir Kahane's usual demagogic oratory with cries of "kill the 
Arabs," while elsewhere in Israel Arabs come under random attack in a mindless 
spasm of vengeance. And so the cycle of hatred and intolerance is freshly 
renewed, and so the innocent die and suffer in a war that shows no signs of 
abating. 
</P>
<P>
Islamic Jihad may well be lying about its connection with the unnamed suspect 
in the bus attack. But, taken together with the suspect's cry of "God is 
great!" as he sized control of the vehicle and Kahane's notion that to drive 
the Arabs from all of historic Palestine is to do God's will, its claim 
dramatizes the inescapable religious component in the Arab-Israeli war. The 
long and bitter battle waged over this small piece of the world is not only a 
clash between competing nationalisms but a conflict involving religious 
extremisms as well, adding greatly to the difficulties of resolving it. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli papers report that the suspect in the bus attack wanted to avenge a 
beating suffered by a relative at the hands of the Israeli army. The government 
has so far said only that he is a Muslim fundamentalist from the occupied 
territories, implying that he may have acted out of religious fervor. 
Identifying the wellsprings of his behavior may have relevance for legal 
purposes, but motivation is of course beside the point when considering the 
appalling consequences of the crime. Not for the first time innocent people 
were made to suffer horrible deaths. That it happened is bad enough. That there 
are some who openly exult in it is infinitely worse.

CARDINAL TIMOTHY MANNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times' coverage of the life and death of Cardinal Timothy Manning (June 24) 
proved three things to me. First, leadership means service; further, it means 
making a difference for the good of all humankind. Second, such "mild-mannered" 
leaders as Cardinal Manning are many times more profound than the leaders who 
take a more reactionary approach. Third, he was truly a good man. I hope that 
my epitaph reads the same.

VOTERS CLOSE RANCHO SECO PLANT: 'THE NUCLEAR ENERGY QUANDARY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial correctly asserted the nuclear power industry must learn some 
lessons from the voters' decision to turn off the Rancho Seco nuclear plant. 
Here's another lesson for the list: nuclear waste. 
</P>
<P>
The industry went full-bore into nuclear power production before finding a safe 
way to dispose of deadly radioactive wastes or decommission the plants. 
Furthermore, nuclear power does pollute. Each year, the average 1,000-megawatt 
nuclear reactor produces 25 metric tons of highly radioactive wastes. All these 
wastes are being stored on site at each reactor. 
</P>
<P>
A National Academy of Sciences study prepared for the Department of Energy 
states that we do not know if current technology can safely isolate those 
wastes from the environment. Repeated failures at the Waste Isolation Project 
Plant in Carlsbad, N.M., where the DOE plans to store radioactive defense 
wastes, indicate that safe nuclear waste disposal is a contradiction in terms. 
</P>
<P>
The commercial nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nev., is flawed 
because it was a politically expedient choice, the bomb testing at the nearby 
Nevada Test Site and the potential for earthquakes. In the nuclear industry's 
best-of-all-possible worlds, it won't even begin to accept nuclear wastes until 
the early part of the next century. This is nothing but a hasty and ill-advised 
remedy to a dangerous, deadly problem.

VOTERS CLOSE RANCHO SECO PLANT: 'THE NUCLEAR ENERGY QUANDARY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times has found it prudent to endorse the decision by the Sacramento 
electorate to close Rancho Seco. It further states that the nuclear industry 
may not have learned from the mistakes made at Rancho Seco. 
</P>
<P>
But the suggestions you make are also lacking in evidence that you have fully 
understood the historical consequences of the shut-down vote. The Times assumes 
that the nuclear industry should now be in a position to rethink its haphazard 
enterprising and start to standardize plant design and construction. 
</P>
<P>
Private utilities own over 90% of the nuclear power plants in this country. 
Plants in other countries with better performance records are primarily state 
operated. This leads to standardized designs and tougher controls. 
</P>
<P>
The reason why other nations have been successful with nuclear power is because 
their governments have a vested interest in making sure plant performance is 
more than adequate, costs are contained, and safety concerns are met. Past and 
current Administrations in this country state support for nuclear power, but 
appoint members to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission who only heed the 
corporate line. 
</P>
<P>
The nuclear experiment in this country has failed for reasons that are inherent 
in the energy policy of this country for the past three decades. This policy 
allows industrial corporations to decide for the public what energy sources 
shall be exploited. 
</P>
<P>
Voters in Sacramento decided that nuclear power would not be one of them. It is 
up to the federal government now to stop investing so much time and money in 
nuclear power, and put more effort into alternative energy sources that are 
less costly in terms of safety and dollars. 
</P>
<P>
To argue that we should standardize nuclear power plants only amounts to one 
more excuse to continue nuclear power generation. To do what The Times suggests 
would mean a reinvestment in nuclear power in the tens of billions of dollars. 
It costs too much. Enough is enough.

SUPREME COURT OKS ABORTION LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a 33-year-old woman, I was fortunate enough to come of age during a period 
of relative leniency with regard to women's right to abortions. I think many 
women my age and younger are so accustomed to having this right that they have 
come to take it for granted. 
</P>
<P>
I shuddered when the news came out about the Supreme Court's decision (Part I, 
July 4). I feel threatened, not so much because I feel I may need an abortion 
at some future date, but because I realize I am a member of a sizeable minority 
whose rights are being taken away. 
</P>
<P>
I am amazed at the shortsightedness of those who, in the name of sanctity of 
human life, would force women to bear children we may not be able to care for. 
What kind of a life would that be for such a child? Who's going to wave the 
magic wand and get rid of child poverty, of child abuse, of the hopelessness of 
youngsters who are not loved and who see all around them a future of drugs and 
crime? As Justice Harry Blackmun said in his dissenting opinion, a chill wind 
is indeed blowing.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hold it! Before we get into an all-out civil war between the pro-lifers and the 
pro-choicers that consumes the rest of the century, let's ask if either side 
can really win. 
</P>
<P>
The positions of both sides are so rigid that any laws passed in state 
legislatures will be widely violated. In a democracy, any law to be effective 
must be generally accepted by the populace. Abortion laws will take the 
imposition of a police state to enforce. 
</P>
<P>
The debate will consume our society, and divert attention from other pressing 
needs. Not only will judges and legislators have to pass one or the other 
side's "litmus test," but such a test will influence selection of executives 
and other positions. We will be lucky if the U.S. doesn't become one giant 
Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
The reason: Attitudes towards abortion are primarily religiously based and the 
judicial and legislative branches of government are out of their element in 
finding a solution. Any government finding is meaningless, and may be dismissed 
as having no content. 
</P>
<P>
So butt out, government. Come on in, churches, and help your flocks. But one 
request. After coming to your insights, do not try to proselytize. Respect 
other people's rights to find the truth as they see it.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO

<P>
The final defendant to be sentenced for robbing a Lodi city councilman's wife 
during a mugging was sentenced Friday to two years in state prison and ordered 
to pay the victim $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Probation was denied for William Austin, 20, of San Diego, whose mother and 
sister were in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Marjorie Reid, 63, was beaten unconscious and robbed Oct. 16 at a Mission 
Valley hotel parking lot while her husband, Fred Reid, 66, attended a League of 
California Cities convention here. She suffered head injuries and a broken hip 
and knee, and was robbed of $200 in cash, her credit cards and a pair of 
diamond earrings. 
</P>
<P>
Austin pleaded guilty March 27 to second-degree robbery and could have been 
sentenced to three years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Two other defendants, Dwayne Elliott, 21, and Willie Rankin, 22, were sentenced 
previously. Rankin received three years and eight months in state prison after 
being convicted April 25 of being an accessory to robbery and receiving stolen 
credit cards. Elliott was sentenced to one year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Superior Court Judge Jesus Rodriguez sentenced Austin, and gave him 
credit for time spent in jail. Rodriguez said there was a likelihood that 
Austin would pose a danger to others if not imprisoned. He cited Austin's 
record, which included convictions for assault and weapons charges. 
</P>
<P>
Marjorie Reid did not testify because her injuries caused a memory loss.

A man wanted on charges of defrauding a Virginia bankruptcy court was ordered 
held without bond Friday by a federal court magistrate who said there was a 
"very serious" risk that he would flee if released. 
</P>
<P>
David DeFusco, 34, and his wife Annette, 27, were arrested Wednesday in their 
rented home in Rancho Santa Fe by FBI agents, who searched the house and found 
thousands of dollars worth of furs, wine, furniture, jewelry and computer 
equipment that the DeFuscos allegedly moved from their home in Virginia in an 
attempt conceal the property from bankruptcy officials. 
</P>
<P>
The DeFuscos, who have used several aliases since they moved to California 
three months ago, also face mail-fraud charges in Texas in connection with 
their direct-mail solicitation business, which purportedly made false promises 
of expensive gifts to prospective buyers of time-share resorts. They are under 
investigation in the state of Washington for a similar operation, according to 
federal prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
U. S. Magistrate Irma Gonzalez said Friday that Annette DeFusco, who wept 
throughout the proceeding, also is a flight risk, but set her bond at $150,000 
so that she may care for the couple's two children. David DeFusco's father and 
brother, who were in the courtroom, said they were willing to post Annette 
DeFusco's bail. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing on whether to transfer the couple to Virginia to face charges there 
will be held this month.

An unidentified woman who was walking along Interstate 5 near Fiesta Island 
Road was struck by a car and killed Thursday, authorities reported. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, who carried no identification, was walking north on the eastern 
shoulder of I-5 about 6:25 p.m. when she stepped into traffic, according to 
Deputy Coroner Ken Bell. 
</P>
<P>
A northbound car driven by Philip Kanish of San Diego struck the woman, Bell 
said. She was pronounced dead at UC San Diego Medical Center about 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, thought to be a transient, was described as black, 5-foot-6, 130 
pounds, in her early 30s. She was wearing a yellow pullover.

The East County fire that blazed for more than two days was finally doused by 8 
a.m. Friday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
About 80 firefighters mopped up throughout the afternoon Friday were sent home 
at about 5 p.m., said Chris Hess, a dispatcher with the California Department 
of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 firefighters battled the blaze at its peak. Erratic winds in rugged 
terrain that made it difficult to fight the blaze Thursday "went the right way" 
early Friday, Hess said. "It wasn't as hot and the winds changed." 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,150 acres of brushland were scorched, though no homes were burned, 
Hess said. Seven firefighters suffered minor injuries.

MORNING BRIEFING: BETTER ASK HIM WHAT HE THINKS 20 YEARS FROM NOW

After the Sacramento Kings drafted University of Louisville center Pervis 
Ellison, club Vice President Bill Russell was asked about Ellison's reputed 
blase behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a kid I used to watch in high school they said that about," Russell 
told the Sporting News. "He just retired at 42 years of age." 
</P>
<P>
Add draft: Seton Hall guard John Morton, first choice of the Cleveland 
Cavaliers, said at a news conference: "In the Bronx, I played on courts that 
had a lot of holes in them that helped me with my moves. At Seton Hall, I 
worked on my jump shot to the point where it was just about automatic." 
</P>
<P>
When someone reminded him of his 43% shooting from the floor, he said: "You 
remember I said just about automatic."

48 years ago today: On July 8, 1941, Ted Williams of the Boston Red Sox hit a 
two-out, three-run homer in the ninth inning to give the American League a 7-5 
victory in the All-Star game at Briggs Stadium in Detroit. Pittsburgh's Arky 
Vaughan hit two home runs for the National League. 
</P>
<P>
For what it's worth: David Atchison, UCLA's new golf coach, is a 
great-great-great grandson of former U.S. senator David Rice Atchison 
(1807-86). Atchison was president for one day -- March 4, 1848 -- when Zachary 
Taylor declined to be inaugurated on a Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Man's best friend: Abe Lemons, Oklahoma City basketball coach, on the early 
days of his marriage: "I got home one evening, and my young wife met me at the 
door crying. She said the dog had eaten the meat loaf she had fixed for supper, 
but I consoled her and said I'd buy her a new dog." 
</P>
<P>
Oops: Said Cincinnati Manager Pete Rose last week when asked about Atlanta 
pitcher John Smoltz: "Believe me, Smoltz is one of the best. I voted for him 
for the All-Star team and I bet . . . oh, I shouldn't say that. I hope he makes 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Would-you-believe-it Dept.: Kansas City's Bo Jackson estimates that he receives 
about 20 pounds of mail a week. But he doesn't feel overburdened. "I'm a speed 
reader," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The last round: Mac O'Grady says he's quitting the PGA Tour this year to devote 
himself to writing and other pursuits. He said he and his Japanese wife will 
spend six months of every year in her homeland, living at the foot of Mt. Fuji, 
where he will be "a Zen gardener." 
</P>
<P>
He told Owen Canfield of the Hartford Courant: "I'm 38, but I'm old enough to 
retire. I figure each of the 17 times I went through the qualifying school it 
aged me a year, and every year I spent on the tour, seven of them, aged me a 
year. So I'm 62. That's retirement age."

KNOX KEEPS HARTFORD LEAD BY ONE STROKE

<TEXT>
<P>
Leading the Greater Hartford Open is nothing new to Kenny Knox. Staying on top 
would be. 
</P>
<P>
Knox shot a four-under-par 67 Friday at Cromwell, Conn., for a two-round total 
of 132 and held a one-stroke lead over Clark Burroughs, who is seeking his 
first PGA Tour victory. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Trevino had the best round of the tournament. His 64 put him in a tie for 
third place at 134 with David Frost (who shot a 65), Jim Carter, Bill Britton 
and Robert Wrenn. 
</P>
<P>
Knox had shared the first-day lead at 65 with Paul Azinger and Bob Gilder. But 
Azinger, the 1987 Hartford champion, had a second-round 70 for a 135, and 
Gilder shot a 74 for a 139. 
</P>
<P>
Knox, with two victories since turning pro in 1978, had a good chance to win 
the 1986 tournament. He was tied for first place after three rounds, then 
soared to a 75 and ended up tied for 24th. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Crafter and Susan Sanders, both seeking their first LPGA tour victories, 
shared the lead in the first round of a $275,000 tournament at Sylvania, Ohio., 
at four-under-par 67. 
</P>
<P>
Betsy King, the year's top money-winner, was only one shot back, tied with 
Liselotte Neumann of Sweden, the 1988 U.S. Women's Open champion. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Douglass shot an eight-under-par 64 to take the first-round lead in a 
$300,000 Senior PGA Tour tournament at Concord, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Douglass, who equaled the competitive course record set by Bruce Crampton in 
1986 and matched by himself in the second round last year, held a one-stroke 
lead over Mike Hill and Bob Charles.

FERNANDEZ GIVES METS A CHANCE TO SMILE, 7-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Throughout his career with the New York Mets, left-hander Sid Fernandez has had 
great potential. Except for the 1986 season, during which he was 16-6 and 
pitched well in the World Series, he has seldom met expectations. 
</P>
<P>
This season, his sixth since being traded by the Dodgers, he began by being 
sent to the bullpen. Injuries to others on the staff resulted in his return to 
the rotation, and he has pitched well since. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night in New York, Fernandez (7-2) pitched a three-hitter, and the Mets 
beat Cincinnati, 7-1. It was only his 10th complete game in 146 starts. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez's performance was a bright spot for a pitching staff in shambles. 
Dwight Gooden is injured, and David Cone, Ron Darling and Bob Ojeda failed 
badly in recent outings. 
</P>
<P>
In the three losses before Fernandez's start, the Met starters gave up 20 
earned runs and 24 hits in 9 1/3 innings. Fernandez has given up only 14 earned 
runs in his last nine starts. 
</P>
<P>
Except for a home run by Luis Quinones, his third in two games, Fernandez was 
in complete control. Two days ago, Quinones had three home runs in 362 at-bats 
in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin McReynolds drove in three runs with two singles, and Howard Johnson drove 
in a run and scored three runs to pace the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
"If we needed a potion, that was it," Met Manager Davey Johnson said of 
Fernandez. "Sid threw only 108 pitches. He was absolutely outstanding." 
</P>
<P>
Manager Pete Rose was concerned about the Reds' lack of offense. "I hate to 
think Luis Quinones is our offense," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sid pitched well against us tonight. He didn't throw a lot of high pitches." 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 6, San Francisco 4 -- Kevin Mitchell hit his 29th home run to trigger 
a four-run second inning for the Giants at St. Louis, but the Cardinals won 
their fourth game in a row as Milt Thompson drove in two runs and Terry 
Pendleton hit a home run. 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton's homer gave the Cardinals, as a team, a 31-29 lead over Mitchell in 
home runs for the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals won despite another poor outing by Jose DeLeon, who has lost five 
in a row. He gave up all four runs in four innings, but the bullpen shut down 
the leaders of the West. Frank DiPino (5-0) went 2 1/3 innings to win it. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 11, Houston 8 -- The Expos blew 4-0 and 8-1 leads at Houston, but Tom 
Foley singled in the go-ahead run in a three-run 10th that enabled them to stay 
1 1/2 games in front in the East. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros, trailing, 8-5, scored three times in the ninth to send the game 
into extra innings. Rafael Ramirez had a two-run double in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
After Foley, who earlier hit a two-run home run, drove in the tiebreaker, Tim 
Raines singled in two more runs. 
</P>
<P>
The Expos have won eight games in a row at the Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat kept the Astros from moving within a game of the Giants in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 5, Philadelphia 3 -- For most of the season, pitcher John Smoltz and 
left fielder Lonnie Smith have provided the brightest moments for the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
Smoltz, who will represent the Braves in the All-Star game Tuesday night at 
Anaheim Stadium, improved to 11-6 in the game at Atlanta. It was a two-run home 
run in the sixth inning by Smith that brought the Braves from behind. 
</P>
<P>
Smoltz struggled with his control, walking five, but he made it through eight 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 3, San Diego 0 -- The season has been a disaster for the Dodgers, 
but it hasn't been much better for the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Drabek threw a three-hitter at Pittsburgh to hand the Padres, who are only 
a half-game ahead of the Dodgers, their sixth loss in the last seven games. 
</P>
<P>
Drabek has given up three or fewer runs in 17 of his 18 starts but has only a 
6-6 record. DAN HAFNER

SAUGUS DRIVER RECOVERS STOLEN TRANSPORT VEHICLE IN TIME FOR RACE

<P>
It isn't often that the police wind up assisting a speeding driver, but Friday 
that's what happened to Frank Ofria, a stock car racer from Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Ofria, 28, who suffers from Hodgkin's disease, had received special permission 
from his doctor to race in tonight's Street Stock program at Saugus Speedway. 
But those plans hit the skids when Ofria's pickup truck was stolen Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Ofria said that he had left the truck overnight at his father's auto repair 
shop in Northridge because he was too woozy to drive himself home after a 
chemotherapy treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Without the beige, 1971 three-quarter-ton truck, Ofria had no way to transport 
his souped-up Dodge Challenger to the race track. And he could not replace the 
truck because he had not insured it against theft because of its age. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a real blow," said Carolyn Ofria, the driver's wife. "The racing boosts 
his spirits, and the doctor said the higher his spirits are, the faster he'll 
get better." 
</P>
<P>
Ofria said that he had just about given up hope of competing in tonight's 
program when he drove past an impound yard in Northridge about noon Friday 
after a doctor's appointment. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw my truck inside that yard and said, 'yahoo,' " Ofria said. "The only 
things missing were the speakers and my tools, but who cares about them." 
</P>
<P>
Detective Wayne Newton of the L. A. Police Department's West Valley Division, 
said that an officer had seen the truck Friday near Parthenia Street and Tampa 
Avenue and had it towed to the yard. Newton said that stolen cars, particularly 
old ones, often are recovered shortly after they are stolen because the thieves 
use them to joy-ride, then abandon them. 
</P>
<P>
Mal Borders, owner of the car Ofria will drive tonight, said that Ofria has 
competed in only a dozen races and is still looking for his first win. But he 
"does a little better every time," Borders said. 
</P>
<P>
Borders said he hopes that Ofria wins tonight because "considering everything 
he's been through lately, it's time for his luck to change."

GRIFFINS' HEARTS SET ON RALLY RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Vince Kowalick 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jeff Griffin really knows how to impress a date. 
</P>
<P>
The first time Griffin took his girlfriend, Camille, for a practice run in the 
desert last year in his off-road rally car, Camille flipped head over heels. 
</P>
<P>
But then so did Jeff. 
</P>
<P>
"We rolled it," Griffin, 29, recalled with a laugh. "It was at night and I had 
to call some friends to rescue us. She said that I lied to her, that I go a lot 
faster than I told her I did." 
</P>
<P>
After more than a year of marriage to Jeff and two off-road events this season, 
Camille Griffin, 27, who serves as her husband's navigator, still recalls the 
incident with a trace of fright. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a very gentle roll," she said. "But it was really a shock. I got out 
of the car and grabbed the first person I could." 
</P>
<P>
Funny how some of the most successful endeavors result from inauspicious 
beginnings. 
</P>
<P>
Since they began rolling along in their Volvo 142, the Griffins, husband and 
wife, driver and navigator, have rallied to assume the points lead of the 
Sports Car Club of America's California Rally Series Open Class division. 
</P>
<P>
Through two of the series' six events, Jeff and Camille, happily joined in 
off-road matrimony, are heading toward their first SCCA championship. The 
Tujunga residents placed first in the Indio Rally Stages in February and second 
in the San Andreas Stages in Lancaster in May. 
</P>
<P>
And they're not planning to roll over in the points race. 
</P>
<P>
Said Jeff: "At first, I'm not sure if she enjoyed it, or if she just did it 
because she knew I needed a navigator." 
</P>
<P>
Added Camille: "I would say that if Jeff wasn't racing, I would probably be 
doing it with someone else." 
</P>
<P>
The California Rally Series, created in 1976, consists of eight events 
(although two have been canceled) of off-road racing against the clock along 
desert paths in California, Arizona and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
"Rallies" are divided into "stages," in which a driver-navigator team bounces 
along the rugged off-road terrain, and "transits," in which competitors travel 
on paved roads between stages. 
</P>
<P>
While in transit, competitors must obey all traffic laws. While in a stage. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
"You're on a road that you've never been on," Camille explained, "and then all 
of a sudden, you have to watch out for a cliff or something." 
</P>
<P>
The navigator's job is to keep the driver informed of what lies ahead as 
indicated by a route chart and track markings. Calculation and execution is 
crucial. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just flying at top speed one time," Camille recalled, "and there was a 
turn and it wasn't marked and we just flew off the road. We must have rolled 
three, four, five times and did pirouettes. And we were heading for trees and 
signs. It was quite scary." 
</P>
<P>
But not enough to frighten either into retirement from rally events. The pair 
plan to compete in the Glen Helen Rally Cross in Devore, Calif., on July 29. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had three navigators," Jeff said. "And she's the best one I've had." 
</P>
<P>
Car cornucopia: Rick Crow could open his own used car lot. 
</P>
<P>
"Two cars that will be there (at Saugus Speedway) on Saturday, two cars with 
(roll) cages and rolling chassis and five cars that are just normal street cars 
that are ready to go," Crow said, cataloguing his nine vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Crow, a resident of Canyon Country, has languished in seventh place in the 
Street Stock division points standings at Saugus Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
Crow has won two main events this season and the division's "pretty car" 
trophy, awarded on opening night to the driver with the most attractive car. 
</P>
<P>
But after three months of slamming around the track, Crow's 1969 pink Chevelle 
was ready to be replaced -- by a '68 model. 
</P>
<P>
"The car was getting kind of, you know. . . . The body was kind of getting 
jagged around the end," Crow said. 
</P>
<P>
When does Crow expect to need a new car? 
</P>
<P>
"Probably next week," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Motocross: Third-round qualifying in the Coors/Kawasaki Summer Series continues 
tonight at Ventura Raceway where the one-fifth-mile dirt oval will be 
transformed into a mini motocross track complete with jumps, bumps and tight 
turns. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a mini stadium motocross track," track manager Cliff Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's qualifying round is the third in a series of four leading to the 
Ventura County Fair Motocross on Aug. 18. 
</P>
<P>
Four subdivisions of beginner, intermediate, amateur and professional will 
compete in six classes ranging from 80cc to 500cc. There also will be 
four-wheel vehicle competition and an over-30-year-old "veteran" class. 
</P>
<P>
Riders must finish among the top 20 to qualify for the Fair. Twenty-eight 
trophies will be awarded.

BEGINNER'S LUCK HELPS BOLES AT VENTURA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It took a little luck and some hard driving, but Allen Boles of San Fernando 
won the 15-lap Street Stock main event at Ventura Raceway on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Boles, in his first race at Ventura, drove the one-fifth-mile dirt oval as if 
he had been driving the track the entire season. And a little bit of luck 
didn't hurt either. 
</P>
<P>
Street Stock points leader Charles Utts of Camarillo was leading the 17-car 
pack when a broken fan belt put him out of the race and allowed Boles to take 
charge in his 1968 Camaro. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Curtis of Camarillo edged figure 8 points leader Rock Ake, Jr. of Moorpark 
by half a car length in the six-lap Mini Stock figure 8 main event. With the 
win, Curtis' sixth, he ties Ake for the most figure 8 main event victories this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Webster of Camarillo was third. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis also won the 20-lap oval track main event. The victory was Curtis' 14th 
main-event title of the season, which reached its midway point Friday. 
</P>
<P>
John Christensen of Palmdale overtook Tom Stephens of Ventura on the final lap 
of the eight-lap Street Stock figure 8 main event to score his third such win 
of the season. Stephens and Don Famularo of Canyon Country finished second and 
third, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Utts continued his winning ways earlier in the evening with a hard-fought 
eight-lap heat-race victory. Utts overtook leader Mike Johannes of Van Nuys on 
Lap 6 after working his way up from the back of the pack. Johannes finished 
fourth after hitting the backstretch wall on Lap 7. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Barrow of Oxnard and Boles finished second and third, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo's Jeff Bosley won the other Street Stock heat race. Paul Moore of 
Oxnard and Nick Magley of Ventura won the Mini Stock heat races. 
</P>
<P>
Sue Pittinato of West Hills captured the four-lap Street Stock trophy dash, and 
Curtis won the Mini Stock division.

BUSH PROPOSES HIKES IN FEDERAL PAY OF UP TO 25% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush dove back into the politically messy issue of federal pay 
increases Friday, calling for raises of up to 25% for federal judges and 8,000 
of the government's top executive branch employees along with a ban on members 
of Congress taking money for personal appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Bush did not propose a congressional pay increase but Press Secretary Marlin 
Fitzwater said that the President still supports the idea and will work with 
congressional leaders to develop a politically acceptable proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The whole issue of pay has been a logjam for years. Congress, which must vote 
on all pay raises for federal employees, has strongly resisted allowing federal 
workers to earn more than congressmen but has also been reluctant to raise its 
own pay. A congressional pay raise was defeated in February amid a political 
firestorm. At the same time, members of Congress are not willing to give up 
honorariums without a pay increase. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, senators and representatives are allowed to add to their pay by 
taking money for speeches and other appearances -- up to 40% of their salary in 
the Senate, 30% in the House. Bush's plan would eliminate that in two stages, 
becoming fully effective when the next Congress is seated in January, 1991. It 
is widely expected that any plan to raise the current $89,500 congressional 
salary would be similarly phased in. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and his aides have been saying that the President would propose a pay 
increase ever since February, when increases of 51% for members of Congress and 
federal judges were defeated. Repeatedly, Bush has said that he was waiting for 
the right time. He chose a moment just before he departs Sunday for a 10-day 
European trip, which should virtually guarantee that reaction to the pay plan 
will not dominate the news. 
</P>
<P>
Under Bush's plan, about 8,000 of the government's 2.2 million employees would 
immediately get raises. The increases would range from 25% for the most senior 
officials down to 8% for more junior executives, taking the salaries for top 
civil servants over $100,000 for the first time. Vice President Dan Quayle 
would also get a raise, from his current salary of $115,000 to $143,800. Bush's 
own salary would stay at $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, 200 new positions would be created with authorized salaries of as 
much as $124,900. Government agencies could use those slots to recruit or 
retain workers whose special skills are in high demand, such as physicists for 
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, doctors for the National 
Institutes of Health and economists for the Commerce Department. 
</P>
<P>
Given the relatively small number -- 200 positions to cover the entire 
government -- those slots are expected to be the subject of intensive jockeying 
among federal agencies. Virtually all federal agencies have been complaining of 
a rapid drain of highly trained specialists into better paying jobs in the 
private sector. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Bush reiterated support for a 25% pay increase for the nation's 
1,300 federal judges, a plan that he submitted earlier in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the plan would add almost $200 million annually to the federal budget. 
Increasing judicial salaries would cost about $30 million a year. The raises 
Bush plans for top federal workers would cost about $155 million a year, 
including $8 million for the 200 new specialists' jobs. And indirectly, Bush's 
plan would cost roughly another $10 million that would go to some 1,100 senior 
civil servants whose pay is now capped to prevent them from earning more than 
their bosses. If their supervisors receive a raise, their pay automatically 
would increase. 
</P>
<P>
The plan came under immediate fire from some federal workers unions, who 
objected that Bush's plan would directly or indirectly provide large raises for 
9,000 of the government's highest paid employees while he proposes to hold the 
vast bulk of federal workers to a 3.6% increase. White House officials defended 
the proposal, arguing that salaries for most federal workers are roughly 
comparable to pay in the private sector but that pay at the top levels has 
fallen seriously behind. 
</P>
<P>
Pay for top federal administrators "has slipped from 66% to 39% of the pay of 
the lower range of private corporate executives," Fitzwater said, "key 
scientific, medical and economic jobs remain unfilled in our Administration due 
to non-competitive pay." 
</P>
<P>
Bush also would require federal officials who receive the increases to undergo 
reviews every three years to demonstrate that they still deserve the extra pay. 
</P>
<P>
Salaries for senior federal officials have risen relatively slowly. As a 
result, not only corporate executives, but also local government officials, 
currently earn more than federal executives, with most school superintendents 
in large cities, for example, earning more than federal agency directors. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, Cabinet secretaries earn $99,500, their deputies earn $89,500 and 
salaries for top federal managers below that rank range from $68,700 to 
$82,500. Under Bush's plan, Cabinet secretaries would get a raise to $124,000, 
deputy secretaries would earn $111,900 and the range for top managers would run 
from $74,500 to $103,100. The wider range of salaries is designed to restore a 
pay ladder to the senior civil service, where many officials find that long 
before retirement they have hit the salary ceiling and cannot hope to earn more 
without leaving government. 
</P>
<P>
Given the concentration of top-level federal officials in Washington, the 
raises would have their greatest impact here. According to the federal Office 
of Personnel Management, however, roughly 3% of the federal workers eligible 
for raises under Bush's plan are located in California.

SKIMMING OF INSURANCE FIRM FUNDS ALLEGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Key executives of firms affiliated with Coastal Insurance Co. told a 
legislative hearing Friday that company officials and agents skimmed millions 
of dollars, spinning Coastal earlier this year into a bankruptcy that will 
result in a $60-million surcharge on all California auto insurance policies. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal became well known to television viewers for the advertising slogan, 
"It's no problem," selling about 200,000 policies by appealing to drivers with 
poor records. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lurid Testimony 
</P>
<P>
In nearly two hours of frequently lurid testimony, the three executives made 
these principal allegations: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In an effort to build up cash flow and thus add to agents' and executives' 
commissions and bonuses, many extremely bad drivers were allowed to misstate 
their accident records and the values of their cars to permit sale of policies 
that were bound to lead to heavy claims. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Some $40,000 cars were recorded on insurance forms as $20,000 cars under 
different model names, and some drivers with three accidents were said to have 
had no accidents. This allowed affordable premiums, but saddled Coastal with 
undesirable policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Policies were paid for on a month-by-month basis, yet Coastal executives 
accounted for them as if they were paid up for a full year. This grossly 
overvalued the company in periodic financial reports to a gullible state 
Department of Insurance. Meanwhile, the company paid its agents a full year's 
commission on new policies, many of which were canceled after a month or two. 
Some of these canceled policies were renewed a month later, and again falsely 
projected as if they were annual sales, thus "pyramiding" the fraudulent 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Coastal spent $17.5 million to purchase a sales affiliate, FGS, even though 
FGS was badly in debt and its president had a restricted insurance license. It 
was the FGS agents who sold thousands of risky policies. Both the inordinately 
high commissions paid to FGS agents and huge numbers of claims on these 
policies helped drive Coastal into bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- As Coastal and its holding company, Advent, reeled into financial problems, 
their chief executive officer, Harry Miller, insisted on giving $5 million in 
contributions out of company funds to the campaign for an insurance initiative, 
Proposition 101, on the 1988 ballot. The initiative received only 13.3% of the 
total vote. 
</P>
<P>
 -- While Coastal and its sales affiliates, FGS and Public Insurance Service, 
had huge numbers of sales agents, it had very few people to process claims. 
There were frequent long claims backlogs, and thousands of telephone calls that 
went unanswered. On some occasions, claims calls were even switched by 
operators to 900 "pay-for-porn" lines to further exasperate the people calling 
for help. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A number of the executives and financial officers of Coastal and its 
affiliates were unqualified to be in the insurance business and intentionally 
followed practices that led to the debacle. Yet most of these people remain in 
the insurance business, sometimes changing the names of their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Those who testified at the hearing of the Assembly Committee on Finance and 
Insurance were Don McMillan, former sales manager of FGS; Stephanie Rager, 
former customer service manager at FGS, and Bob Pearlman, former comptroller of 
Advent Co. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$60-Million Surcharge 
</P>
<P>
According to subsequent testimony by John W. Gates, executive director of the 
California Insurance Guarantee Assn., the agency charged with paying off claims 
against bankrupt companies, the surcharge resulting from Coastal's bankruptcy 
will be more than $60 million. The policyholders of other insurance companies 
are required by law to pay any claims against companies that go bankrupt. The 
guarantee association is empowered to raise that money by levying surcharges. 
</P>
<P>
After four hours of hearing witnesses, including two leading Coastal and Advent 
executives who did not challenge the testimony but claimed they were not 
personally responsible for what had happened, Assemblyman Patrick Johnston 
(D-Stockton), chairman of the committee, expressed shock. 
</P>
<P>
He said he feared that unless state insurance regulators exert much closer 
scrutiny over such practices in the future, there will be more insurance 
company bankruptcies. 
</P>
<P>
After Steve Avgeris, the top executive under Miller in both Coastal and Advent, 
had testified that he was only an "office boy" paid $400,000 a year but not 
responsible for any of the companies' shortcomings, Johnston expressed 
consternation that Avgeris is already involved in a new company selling auto 
insurance to substandard drivers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'You're Moving On' 
</P>
<P>
"See, you're moving on, and California policyholders may be stuck with new 
bills in the future," the assemblyman said. "They're the ones that will be 
hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Avgeris said that actually all he is doing with the new company, Summit 
Insurance Services, is directing its advertising. "Otherwise, now I can only go 
back to school or run a hamburger stand," the 51-year-old executive said. 
</P>
<P>
However, this did not impress Johnston, who remarked that the lesson of Coastal 
was that it was good only in marketing its policies, not in serving claims or 
performing any of the other functions of an insurance company. He noted that 
the new company Avgeris now works for does not yet have a state license but is 
doing business under license of an agent it has hired. The committee had 
attempted to subpoena Miller to appear, but could not find him. Johnston said 
Miller employees had told a process server that he was in Alaska at an 
undisclosed location and that he has not been in California for more than a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Another leading executive subpoenaed to appear, Sid Field of FGS, an executive 
who received $17.5 million in payments from Miller, sent a lawyer to the 
hearing to say he had not yet been able to consult with his principal attorney 
and would appear at a second committee hearing, Aug. 29. 
</P>
<P>
However, Field called The Times after the hearing to say, "I was not 
responsible, not in charge" of FGS at the time, after its acquisition by 
Coastal, when its agents were allegedly selling risky policies in order to gain 
high commissions. "The only thing I was in charge of was advertising," he said. 
"I had no ability to make decisions." 
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the board of Advent and Coastal, Gerald Milton, who did 
testify, also disclaimed responsibility for what had happened. He said that 
Miller had often done things without his permission. For instance, Milton said, 
he had told Miller that the terms for buying FGS were "a bad deal," but that 
Miller had bought it anyway on the disadvantageous terms.

GORBACHEV BEGINS BID TO RESHAPE IDEA OF EUROPE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
With the same vigor and vision with which he has set about reforming the Soviet 
Union, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is now embarked on reshaping Europe for 
the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev is offering ideas -- a philosophy, even -- rather than a preset 
formula. But at home his ideas are already remaking a revolution and remaking a 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
He has no blueprint for the new Europe, no plan for what he calls "the common 
European home," not even an agenda for negotiations beyond broad topics such as 
disarmament, environmental protection and economic cooperation, but this is an 
idea that is beginning to catch on here and elsewhere in Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
What Gorbachev is offering is his own relentless energy. And in his visit to 
France this week he made clear his determination to work for sweeping political 
and economic changes in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Declaring that the Cold War is over, he proposes that the armed camps formed in 
that era disarm and eventually disband as political trust replaces military 
power as the basis of security -- or, as Gorbachev put it here this week, "the 
doctrine of restraint replaces the doctrine of deterrence." 
</P>
<P>
"It is time to consign to oblivion the Cold War assumptions that viewed Europe 
as an arena of confrontation, divided into 'spheres of influence,' someone 
else's 'forward-based defenses,' as an object of military confrontation, as a 
theater of war," he said, offering Europeans the glimpse of a future where 
there no longer would be even the fear of war. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of a continent divided between East and West, between socialist and 
capitalist, Gorbachev envisions a community of individual nations, each with 
its own culture, history and political-economic system, but all engaged "in the 
process of the joint creation" of a unified Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"Europeans can meet the challenges of the coming century only by pooling their 
efforts," he told the 23-nation Council of Europe in Strasbourg, France, on 
Thursday as he set out hopes for the Continent. "We are convinced that what 
they need is one Europe, peaceful and democratic -- a Europe that maintains all 
its diversity and common humanistic ideas, a prosperous Europe that extends its 
hand to the rest of the world, a Europe that confidently advances into the 
future. It is in such a Europe that we visualize our own future." 
</P>
<P>
And to those who ask whether the Soviet Union, more expansionist than Czarist 
Russia ever dared to be and more zealous in spreading socialism than its 
neighbors would tolerate, is ready to live in such a community and abide by its 
rules, he offers his own domestic reforms, known as perestroika, as proof of 
Soviet sincerity -- and as a challenge to potential partners. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Changing the Country 
</P>
<P>
"Perestroika is changing our country, advancing it to new horizons," Gorbachev 
said. "That process will continue, extend and transform Soviet society in all 
dimensions -- economic, social, political and spiritual, in all domestic 
affairs and human relations. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"As a result, you and your governments, your parliaments and your peoples will 
soon be dealing with a totally different socialist nation than has been the 
case before. And this will have, and cannot but have, a favorable impact on 
developments through the entire world." 
</P>
<P>
This is not the sweeping, soaring vision of a philosopher or poet, but that of 
a bold politician convinced of the need for far-reaching changes that break 
sharply with the past but that are still realistic and pragmatic. 
</P>
<P>
"The 'idea of Europe,' as the French like to put it, is really armchair stuff, 
something to talk about over a fine Armagnac," Prof. Alexander O. Choubarian, 
director of the Soviet Institute of World History, a key Kremlin think tank, 
commented in an interview here. 
</P>
<P>
"Our idea of the 'common European home,' as Gorbachev has called it, is a 
dynamic one that invites participation," he said. "Gorbachev has posed the 
question, and it is also a challenge: 'What kind of Europe do you want to live 
in?' 
</P>
<P>
"He is giving his own answers, and we can see the dynamism beginning to work. . 
. . Pay attention: Europe is being reshaped, history is being made." 
</P>
<P>
Following his talks with President Francois Mitterrand, the Soviet leader 
expanded his proposal for a pan-European summit, with the United States and 
Canada also participating. He suggested that it convene within the next two 
years to ratify an agreement reducing conventional armed forces on the 
continent and then discuss the major problems facing Europe as well as the 
"future stages of progress toward a European community of the 21st Century." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's starting point for all this is deceptively simple: Through the 
impact of its own reforms, the Soviet Union is generating changes in other 
countries in Europe and throughout the world. And to Gorbachev's mind, these 
add up to a historic opportunity to reshape Europe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Let's Act Together' 
</P>
<P>
"The world is not static -- when we act, you react, and when you act, we 
react," Vadim Zagladin, one of Gorbachev's foreign policy advisers, said during 
the Soviet visit here. "Now we are proposing, 'Let's act together, break out of 
that old game of action-reaction and try to build something new.' " 
</P>
<P>
Through its weight as a superpower, its leadership in the socialist world, its 
economic potential and the vigor of its "new political thinking" and 
willingness to rethink virtually all past positions, the Soviet Union feels 
that it can alter the international balance of power, particularly in Europe, 
as it proceeds with its reforms. 
</P>
<P>
But Moscow needs partners if it is to create a different environment around it 
in Europe, as Gorbachev explained in Strasbourg, and that is the current focus 
of Soviet diplomacy here. 
</P>
<P>
The prolonged confrontation of the past four decades was ruinous for the Soviet 
Union, and continuing it would preclude his own country's economic 
reconstruction and the improvement of its citizens' living standards. 
</P>
<P>
With international tensions reduced substantially, the Soviet leadership 
believes that it can cut its military spending by as much as half, expand 
economic ties to spur its development and open itself to the world to bring in 
new ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev made clear that the Soviet Union understands the price for such a 
detente will be high -- and that Moscow is ready to pay it. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the democratization of the socialist countries of Eastern 
Europe could lead not only to a multi-party system, as is emerging in Hungary 
and Poland, but even to the loss of power by the ruling Communist parties. 
</P>
<P>
"The social and political order in some particular countries changed in the 
past, and it can change in the future as well," he said. "But this is 
exclusively a matter for the peoples themselves, for their choice." 
</P>
<P>
Going further, he ruled out "any interference in the internal affairs, any 
attempts to limit the sovereignty of (other) states, whether friends and allies 
or somebody else." 
</P>
<P>
This not only ended the so-called "Brezhnev doctrine,"(named after the late 
Soviet President Leonid I. Brezhnev) which Moscow has used to justify its 
intervention in other communist countries to defend the gains of socialism 
there against "counterrevolution," but it also abandoned the decades-long 
Soviet effort to protect itself with buffer states in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Answering another frequent criticism of Soviet policy -- its willingness to 
sacrifice basic human rights out of political expediency -- Gorbachev said 
Moscow's commitment to human rights was now firm and solid. 
</P>
<P>
"A world where military arsenals would be reduced but where human rights would 
be violated would not be a safe place," he declared in what seemed almost an 
echo of Western statements. "We have made this conclusion for ourselves, once 
and for all." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said the reassessment that led to these and other equally profound 
policy shifts "did not come easy and sometimes was downright painful." 
</P>
<P>
But the net result, he argued here and in Strasbourg, was a liberation from the 
"vicious circle of 'action-reaction' in East-West relations" -- a new freedom 
of action that he believes can be used in reshaping Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In the first address by a Communist leader to the Council of Europe, he 
declared: "I strongly believe that it is high time that Europeans brought their 
policies and their conduct in line with a new rationality -- not to prepare for 
war, not to intimidate one another, not to compete in improving weapons . . . 
but rather to learn to make peace together, and together to lay a solid basis 
for it."

The B-2 stealth bomber is set to take its maiden flight within the next two 
weeks, the Air Force said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The $530-million-a-copy warplane -- the costliest aircraft in history -- will 
undergo taxi tests and its first flight test during a 15-day period beginning 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The bomber will undergo three trials during the period -- slow taxi, fast taxi 
and flight. No specific date or time has been set for any of the tests, but 
reporters have been advised to appear at Northrop Corp.'s Palmdale plant each 
day just in case one occurs. 
</P>
<P>
The flying-wing bomber, which is made of materials designed to absorb or 
deflect radar, is scheduled to reach about 10,000 feet and fly over Southern 
California for two hours before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, 35 miles 
east of Palmdale.

KEMP PUTS BLAME ON PIERCE FOR HUD TROUBLES; 
</P>
<P>
CALLS PREDECESSOR 'HONEST MAN' BUT SAYS AGENCY WAS NOT MANAGED CAREFULLY

In his strongest comments yet on the burgeoning scandals in his department, 
Housing Secretary Jack Kemp on Friday blamed Samuel R. Pierce Jr., his 
predecessor, for the agency's current troubles and indicated that he might halt 
additional programs as part of his in-house cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm making a lot of changes, so that, by definition, is suggesting that 
Secretary Pierce unfortunately -- a very decent and honest man -- did not in my 
view manage HUD as carefully or closely as it should have been managed," Kemp 
told reporters after speaking to a Republican youth group. "That reflects on 
Mr. Pierce and, I say this with sadness not anger, it reflects on the (Ronald) 
Reagan Administration." 
</P>
<P>
Kemp, who announced Thursday that he had suspended a third HUD program because 
of mismanagement, said "there may be" more cuts, adding: "But I'm not going to 
announce them today." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Bush Administration took steps to avoid being caught off guard 
by similar scandals in other corners of the federal bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
Richard G. Darman, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, 
prepared a memo directing inspectors general of the other Cabinet departments 
to be "extra diligent" in reviewing the record of the Reagan Administration, a 
White House official said. He explained that the White House wants to be sure 
that there are no problems comparable to HUD's that could embarrass it. 
</P>
<P>
And in a related development, a White House official has been relieved of her 
responsibilities overseeing certain aspects of the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development budget because she is under congressional investigation for 
projects she handled while working at the beleaguered agency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Asks for Reassignment 
</P>
<P>
Janet Hale, associate director of OMB, whose duties include dealing with the 
entire HUD budget, asked for the reassignment and was told late Thursday by 
Darman that she would be removed from any OMB matters relating to the HUD 
investigation, although she was not relieved of all HUD-related budget matters. 
</P>
<P>
"As you suggested, . . . I have decided it would be prudent to make a 
reassignment of responsibilities that might be perceived to relate to these 
matters," Darman wrote in a memo to Hale. "For the time being, any matters 
specifically involving the HUD investigation or the HUD actions under 
investigation should be handled . . . without your involvement." 
</P>
<P>
Kemp has been harshly critical of the abuse within his department's programs. 
But until Friday he had avoided any direct references to the performance of his 
predecessor. In fact, on June 19, he pointedly refused to comment when asked 
whether Pierce was responsible for the department's problems, saying: "I'm not 
going to make a political judgment about any past secretary because I think 
it's unseemly of me." 
</P>
<P>
Kemp is scheduled to begin testifying Tuesday before the House Government 
Operations subcommittee on employment and housing, which is investigating fraud 
and mismanagement within the department. The subcommittee is also expected to 
recall Pierce, possibly before the August congressional recess. 
</P>
<P>
On the matter of OMB's Hale, Darman said that her responsibilities regarding 
the HUD investigation would be handled by her deputy for the time being and 
that her staff should report directly to him for those areas. 
</P>
<P>
"I recognize that there is some awkwardness in this arrangement," Darman wrote, 
"but, as you suggested I might, I have concluded that this is in the best 
interest of OMB -- and I am inclined to think that, for the period of the 
investigation, it is also in your own best interest." 
</P>
<P>
Hale could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Hale, former deputy assistant secretary of housing, is the subject of 
congressional scrutiny for her role in at least two areas while at HUD, 
including a controversial apartment project in Durham, N.C., that involved a 
former law firm colleague of Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
Hale approved the Durham project, according to a report by HUD's inspector 
general, despite opposition from HUD staff members. The project, an $11-million 
plan to convert a former hosiery mill into HUD-subsidized apartments for the 
elderly, was opposed on environmental grounds -- toxic waste had been buried at 
the site and a railroad runs nearby -- and because it lacked adequate private 
backing and would cost the housing agency too much. 
</P>
<P>
Hale declined comment earlier this week when asked about signing the waiver for 
the Durham project, saying that she had not reviewed the records. When a 
reporter asked her to do so, she said, with a laugh: "Don't call me. I'll call 
you." 
</P>
<P>
But a former top HUD official, who was there when the Durham plan was approved, 
described Hale as having "had an emotional struggle" in approving the project. 
</P>
<P>
The Durham project had been promoted by Charles B. Markham, the city's former 
Republican mayor, who is a former law partner of Pierce, and by Louis Kitchin, 
a key GOP strategist in the South for Reagan's presidential campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Hale was notified earlier this week that she would be called to testify before 
the House subcommittee. The panel began hearings in May into charges that HUD 
favored clients of influential Republicans in awarding grants under its 
moderate housing rehabilitation program. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart E. Weisberg, staff director for the subcommittee, said that Hale would 
be the focus of an nquiry into the Durham project and into her response to a 
1985 report by the HUD inspector general that described problems in the 
department's co-insurance program, in which the federal government and private 
mortgage lenders join to underwrite mortgages on apartment projects. 
</P>
<P>
"She responded that he (the inspector general) had exaggerated them and it 
turned out that he was right and she was wrong," Weisberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Staff writers Douglas Frantz, David Lauter and Ronald J. Ostrow also 
contributed to this story.

'IMPOSSIBLE TO DEAL WITH';

<P>
SAUDI MEDIA BRAND IRANIAN RULERS AS MADMEN, TERRORISTS

<P>
Saudi Arabia's official media branded Iran's rulers madmen and terrorists 
Friday in renewed conflict over the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, where more than 
a million Muslims have gathered. 
</P>
<P>
The behavior of Iran's rulers "can only be described as madness and 
foolishness. . . . It is impossible to deal with Iran in any way," Saudi 
Arabia's Al Riyadh newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
The attack was Saudi Arabia's most stinging this year in a dispute that has 
simmered since 1987 when more than 400 people, mostly Iranians, were killed in 
clashes with security forces in Mecca. 
</P>
<P>
In Tehran, Iran's chief justice accused Saudi rulers of using baseless excuses 
to limit Iranian pilgrims and said: "We want God to give us the strength . . . 
to throw out the corpse of this taghut (tyrant) from the House of God." 
</P>
<P>
Abdulkarim Moussavi Ardabili, speaking at Friday prayers and referring to the 
1987 clashes which erupted as pilgrims demonstrated against Israel and the 
United States, said Riyadh has imposed a quota because it "fears that in 
protesting against infidels, the new (pilgrims) will be as adamant as the 
(1987) martyrs." 
</P>
<P>
Iran, which sent 150,000 pilgrims to Mecca in 1987, has sent none this year for 
the second year running because Saudi Arabia said it would accept only 45,000 
Iranians. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia last year gained the support of all Muslim states except Iran for 
a quota system of one pilgrim for every 1,000 Muslims in any one country while 
a $300-million project to improve facilities at holy sites is under way. 
</P>
<P>
Al Riyadh charged that Tehran fosters "terrorism in Arab and European states 
and seeks recourse with international gangs. . . . It imagines it is the 
world's third superpower." 
</P>
<P>
Tehran Radio, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Ahmad Khomeini, son of the Ayatollah 
Ruhollah Khomeini, the supreme leader who died last month, as condemning the 
Saudi royal family as advocates of "American-style Islam." 
</P>
<P>
King Fahd and his relatives aim to make Islam nonpolitical and useless for 
fighting oppressive powers, the radio said. 
</P>
<P>
Iran has been at odds with conservative Saudi Arabia since the 1979 Islamic 
revolution in Tehran and Iran's new leader, Ali Khamenei, urged pilgrims 
Thursday to stage new protests against Israel and the United States in defiance 
of a Saudi ban. 
</P>
<P>
The mass pilgrimage, or hajj, reaches a climax Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The following day will be the end of 40 days of official mourning in Iran for 
Khomeini, who died of a heart attack June 3. 
</P>
<P>
Riyadh, which backed Baghdad in the Iran-Iraq War, severed ties with Iran early 
in 1988. But in October, after an August cease-fire in the Persian Gulf War, 
King Fahd ordered a halt in a war of words with Iran.

LIKUD'S TERMS MAKE PEACE MORE ELUSIVE, BAKER SAYS

<TEXT>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Friday that tough terms set by 
Israel's ruling Likud Party for Palestinian elections in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip would make it more difficult to move toward peace in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"In our judgment, the Likud resolutions are not helpful," Baker told reporters 
after a meeting in Brunei, a small, oil-rich nation on the north coast of 
Borneo, with Southeast Asian foreign ministers. 
</P>
<P>
"Imposing restrictive conditions are . . . obviously going to make it more 
difficult to get negotiations, and we have urged all the parties to avoid 
this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir bowed this week to pressure from Likud 
hard-liners and set restrictive terms on a proposal for Palestinian balloting 
in Israeli-occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir had originally proposed allowing Palestinians to choose delegates to 
negotiate self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
But Wednesday he told the Likud central committee that Israel will never 
negotiate with the Palestine Liberation Organization, allow a Palestinian state 
or halt Jewish settlement in the territories. 
</P>
<P>
Washington had praised Shamir's original proposal as a move toward peace, but 
State Department officials traveling with Baker said the tough new position 
reduces the chances of drawing Palestinians into direct talks with Israel.

CHINA CANCELS OFFICIALS' VACATIONS TO RECOUP LOSSES CAUSED BY UNREST

China canceled summer vacations Friday for all government and Communist Party 
workers nationwide, saying they need to make up for economic losses during the 
recent unrest and warning that those who flout the ban will be punished. 
</P>
<P>
The order, carried by the Communist Party newspaper People's Daily, was issued 
as an "urgent notice" by the party Central Committee and the State Council, 
China's Cabinet, which oversees government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
It came as the country's finance minister, Wang Bingqian, warned of serious 
problems in the national budget and called for increased efforts to keep the 
budget deficit within its targets. 
</P>
<P>
Wang said spending rose by 15.9% during the first five months of the year, 
twice as fast as revenue grew. He blamed rising costs of raw materials, poor 
management and a drop in economic efficiency in factories and other 
enterprises. Administrative expenses were budgeted to increase 2.5% during the 
period, but actually soared by 23.6%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The order canceling vacations except for national holidays applies to all 
government and party officials at national, provincial and local levels, and 
appeared to affect tens of millions of people.

DALAI LAMA FINDS CHINA PURGE FAMILIAR

<P>
The bloody suppression and punishment of student protesters in China in recent 
weeks was foreshadowed by similar events in Tibet, the Dalai Lama said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We already experienced this kind of unfortunate tragedy," the exiled Tibetan 
religious and political leader told a news conference in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
An official of Tibet's government in exile charged that as many as 800 
prisoners have died through torture since March, when Chinese officials imposed 
martial law amid protests in Tibet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'More Teeth' in Repression 
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Tibet is very grim," said Tashi Wangdi, who has headed the 
Dalai Lama's efforts to seek talks with China on human rights violations and on 
proposals to return a degree of political autonomy to Tibet. 
</P>
<P>
Wangdi charged that the prisons are full in Tibet and that the current martial 
law has given "more teeth" to a repression lasting nearly 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Guo Chongli, the Chinese consul for political and press affairs in Los Angeles, 
responded Friday by calling the claim of torture deaths "groundless." 
</P>
<P>
"Those very few people who commit crimes against the law are arrested," Guo 
said in a telephone interview. "(But) there have been no deaths by torture in 
prison, absolutely not." 
</P>
<P>
Although martial law continues, the Chinese official asserted that "the Tibetan 
situation has gradually become normal now." Guo added that his government is 
"against any political activities by the Dalai (Lama) and his followers abroad. 
(They) are splitting the motherland and the unity of its nationalities." 
</P>
<P>
Tenzin Gyatso, whose 54th birthday was celebrated Thursday, was selected as the 
14th Dalai Lama when he was only 2. He was called to assume political 
leadership of the 6 million Tibetans in 1950, the year Chinese troops invaded 
the Himalayan region. As Chinese soldiers put down an uprising in 1959, the 
Dalai Lama and a large entourage of Tibetans left the country and established a 
government in exile at Dharmsala, India. 
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama is in Southern California until July 20, principally to conduct 
intricate Buddhist teaching ceremonies at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the "hard-line, repressive nature" of the Chinese regime, the Dalai 
Lama called the arrests and silencing of critics "a temporary setback." 
</P>
<P>
"I always believe in human determination, the human spirit, to overcome," he 
said.

RYBAKOV NAMED TO LEAD MOSCOW CHAPTER OF PEN

Leading writers here have elected liberals to head the Soviet Union's first 
branch of PEN, an international literary organization that for years has 
denounced by Moscow as anti-communist, members said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The president of the new group -- to be known as the Russian Soviet PEN center 
-- will be anti-Stalinist novelist Anatoly Rybakov and among its seven vice 
presidents are poets Andrei Voznessensky and Yevgeny Yevtushenko. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a vital moment for literature and the intelligentsia," the 78-year-old 
Rybakov told reporters. "Our center will work for freedom of creation, for the 
rights of writers and against censorship everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
About 50 founder-members of the group, a product of the freer cultural policies 
followed under Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev program of glasnost 
(openness), gathered Thursday night for the elections after sending a 
delegation to a recent Pen congress. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts by dissenting writers to form a PEN chapter in Moscow in the 1960s and 
1970s were quickly squashed by the authorities, although the international 
organization includes some of the best-known figures in world literature. 
</P>
<P>
Arkady Vaksberg, a specialist on the Soviet legal system and one of the vice 
presidents, said the Moscow center will take part in international campaigns in 
support of persecuted or threatened writers like Salman Rushdie or Vaclav 
Havel. 
</P>
<P>
Rybakov and Vaksberg, with other founder members, issued protests earlier this 
year over the Prague's jailing of Havel, a leading Czechoslovak playwright, and 
of a death sentence against British author Rushdie by Iran's late revolutionary 
patriarch, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. 
</P>
<P>
"We regard it as very important for Soviet writers to publicly express their 
support for writers in similar situations everywhere, not just in the Soviet 
Union itself," Vaksberg said.

GORBACHEV ASSURES EAST BLOC ON REFORM;

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told East Bloc leaders Friday they are 
free to pursue their own views of communism, but suggested his own program of 
economic and social reform as a guide. 
</P>
<P>
"We are entering a time which requires new policies and new solutions," 
Gorbachev said in a dinner toast after the first day of the Warsaw Pact summit. 
</P>
<P>
"Each country and each party has its own specifics and can continue its own 
individual road to socialist democracy and progress," he added. 
</P>
<P>
His host at the banquet was Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu, the most 
vocal critic of Gorbachev's reforms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Splits in Alliance 
</P>
<P>
The alliance's seven members are divided over Gorbachev's new policies, with 
the Soviet Union, Hungary and Poland on the liberal side and Bulgaria, 
Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Romania sticking to the orthodox course. 
</P>
<P>
Their purposes at this summit are to discuss Western arms-reduction proposals 
and the Warsaw Pact's role in a new world where Gorbachev speaks of a "common 
European home" with no threat or fear of war. 
</P>
<P>
In his dinner toast, Gorbachev said, "We took new steps today toward European 
security, rapprochement and East-West dialogue." But he added: "There is still 
a war psychosis which we must overcome. We think it is necessary to stress the 
need for a shift from military to political moves" in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu renewed what he described as the Soviet Bloc's "appeal to NATO to 
give up its policy of nuclear deterrence." 
</P>
<P>
Neither he nor Gorbachev specifically mentioned what was decided Friday, but 
sources said the alliance has concluded discussion on documents which will call 
for more dialogue with the West on disarmament and lay out a vision of a world 
free of nuclear and chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NATO Plans Discussed 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told an earlier news 
briefing that Gorbachev and his counterparts discussed NATO proposals for 
reducing conventional forces and how the Soviet Bloc "should change, adapt . . 
. become contemporary." 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody would agree there are vast changes, in our country, in the world," 
Gerasimov said. "They are talking about the role of the Warsaw Pact in these 
changing conditions." 
</P>
<P>
Ion Diaconu of the Romanian Foreign Ministry refused comment on a report by the 
Soviet news agency Novosti that the leaders were discussing creation of a 
Warsaw Pact "political commission" to arbitrate disputes between members. 
</P>
<P>
Diaconu denied reports that Romania had requested a discussion at the summit of 
its dispute with Hungary over Romania's alleged mistreatment of its 1.7 million 
ethnic Hungarians. 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov said problems within the bloc were not on the agenda, but "each 
delegation can say a few words about its own problems." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said in West Germany last month that the Bucharest summit would 
respond to President Bush's proposal May 29 for a joint reduction in U.S. and 
Soviet troops stationed in Europe to 275,000 for each side by 1993, accompanied 
by cuts in combat aircraft and other conventional weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet leader said the Bush proposal had increased chances for quick 
agreement at Vienna negotiations on conventional forces. Bush's plan is 
expected to be discussed in September. 
</P>
<P>
He also is pushing for talks with NATO on reducing tactical, or short-range, 
nuclear weapons in Europe, but the United States wants the issue tied to cuts 
in conventional forces. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, during a visit to Strasbourg, France, Gorbachev again tried to 
push the Western alliance into talks on the short-range weapons, offering the 
possibility of more unilateral cuts in the Kremlin's nuclear arsenal if NATO 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Offer Recalled 
</P>
<P>
His last offer to scrap nuclear weapons -- about 500 warheads -- came in May 
during a visit to Moscow by Secretary of State James A. Baker III, while NATO 
was arguing about a joint position on short-range missiles. 
</P>
<P>
There was unconfirmed speculation in Bucharest that documents released after 
the summit ends tonight might include numbers for the Strasbourg offer. 
</P>
<P>
Romanian television broadcast scenes of delegations arriving on Thursday. 
Rezsoe Nyers, the Hungarian party chairman, appeared to be the only delegation 
head Ceausescu did not greet with a comradely kiss on the cheek. 
</P>
<P>
After Gorbachev arrived, reporters asked him what he expected of the summit. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you when we've finished," he said.

3 GOVERNOR HOPEFULS SEEM TO SOFTEN STANDS AGAINST PROCEDURE

<P>
With this week's U.S. Supreme Court decision forcing them to take a stand in 
the emotional abortion debate, early indications are that some politicians long 
considered part of the anti-abortion camp have begun to move closer to the 
abortion rights forces. 
</P>
<P>
To a certain extent, this erosion may indicate concern over the political 
strength long-dormant pro-choice groups are expected to muster, now that the 
Supreme Court has moved abortion to the top of the national agenda. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most dramatic defections was that of Illinois Atty. Gen. Neil 
Hartigan, who has long said he was personally opposed to abortion. He is also 
highly visible as the official who will be urging the Supreme Court this fall 
to allow his state to impose abortion restrictions more far-reaching than those 
the court upheld in the Missouri case handed down Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Huddled With Advisers 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Hartigan declared Friday that "the right of privacy is of 
paramount importance. I support the woman's freedom of choice" to have an 
abortion. His announcement, which drew fire from activists on both sides, came 
after he had huddled several days with advisers for his possible run for 
governor, where he is viewed as the strongest of the likely Democratic 
contenders. 
</P>
<P>
In Massachusetts, former Atty. Gen. Francis X. Bellotti, another Democratic 
candidate for governor, issued a statement supporting abortion rights 
immediately after the court decision, despite his record of defending the 
state's anti-abortion laws. A 1979 Supreme Court case bearing his name, Baird 
vs. Bellotti, established a system under which a minor must have both parents' 
permission to get an abortion, unless a judge intervenes. 
</P>
<P>
"Bellotti is begining to be convinced that the abortion issue is a critical 
issue and that he needs to be pro-choice to win," said Joyce Cunha, director of 
Mass. Choice. "We're going to be very skeptical." 
</P>
<P>
All the shifts have not been so clear, nor have they all come from Democrats, 
whose national party supports abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Apparent Softening of Stand 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Jim Courter, the GOP nominee for New Jersey governor, has a congressional 
voting record that pits him squarely against abortion. But he appeared to 
soften that position somewhat earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
Courter told the Bergen Record, in an interview published Thursday, that 
"there's not the consensus here to modify the laws we now have in order to 
restrict abortions." 
</P>
<P>
"The laws aren't going to change," he said. "For myself, it's never been on the 
top of the agenda." 
</P>
<P>
A recent poll by the Record found that more than two-thirds of the state's 
residents oppose a ban on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to see a lot of what Courter is doing -- a lot of anti-choice 
candidates trying to downplay this issue," said Nancy Broff, political and 
legislative director of the National Abortion Rights Action League, which plans 
to pour hundreds of thousands of dollars into the New Jersey governor's race 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court's decision is seen as a turning point, from which the court's 
new conservative majority is expected to chip away at its 1973 Roe vs. Wade 
decision that established abortion as a national right. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, in the next few years, for the first time in almost two decades, 
sometimes reluctant state politicians will be handed the power to decide 
whether to place restrictions on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians trying to find a middle ground between the two views, or shifting 
from one side to the other, are finding themselves drawing fire from both. 
</P>
<P>
Hartigan, for example, attempted to reconcile his personal views with his 
public stand by saying: "The choice may not be one that I would advise a woman 
to make, but in a pluralistic society, a society like ours, the differences of 
opinions and beliefs must be tolerated." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think his political strategists served him well by this," said Ralph 
Rivera, chairman of the Illinois Pro-Life Coalition Political Action Committee. 
"I feel he is trying to get votes from both sides. It won't work." 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Dougherty, executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action 
League's Illinois chapter, also was critical of Hartigan's statement. "It 
doesn't do anything for me . . . . I find it disturbing when he talks about 
tolerating. (The issue) is not to tolerate, but to protect these rights."

FBI RECOVERS 3 F-16 ENGINES STOLEN AT BASE

<P>
The FBI has recovered three F-16 jet engines that were missing at least four 
days ago from this base in northern Utah, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The latest we have on the theft and recovery of the missing jet engines is 
that they've been found, they've been located and are in the possession of the 
government. They were recovered by the FBI," said Air Force spokeswoman Maj. 
Donna Pastor in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
But CBS News reported Friday that the engines were never actually missing and 
that the entire mystery was part of a "Pentagon sting" designed to uncover 
evidence against a major military theft ring. 
</P>
<P>
NBC News also reported a "sting operation," adding Friday that members of a 
theft ring may have thought they were selling the expensive engines to "boat 
enthusiasts" to power speedboats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Details Provided 
</P>
<P>
Pastor said she could not provide any details, such as where the engines were 
found and whether there were any arrests. 
</P>
<P>
"We have recovered three jet engines stolen from Hill Air Force Base," said Tim 
Screen, with the FBI's Salt Lake City office, which handled the investigation. 
"Due to the sensitive nature of the ongoing investigation, we cannot say more. 
The FBI recovered them." 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Louis Arana-Barradas, spokesman for Hill Air Force Base, about 35 miles 
north of Salt Lake City, said: "The engines were discovered missing during the 
normal course of business." 
</P>
<P>
The engines used to power F-16 Fighting Falcons are 16 to 20 feet long and 
weigh about 3,500 pounds each, Arana-Barradas said. They are valued at about $2 
million apiece.

VATICAN PRAISES ABORTION RULING

The Vatican's chief guardian of doctrine on Friday praised this week's U.S. 
Supreme Court ruling that allows states to restrict abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision is a sign of the birth of a new moral consciousness on abortion," 
Roman Catholic Cardinal Joseph A. Ratzinger said at a news conference at Madrid 
University. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a kind of move away from earlier attitudes, where I see a reflection 
that weighs more on the side of the value of human life," said the prefect of 
the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which makes sure that church 
officials adhere to Catholic doctrine. 
</P>
<P>
Ratzinger made the comments after delivering a lecture entitled "Jesus Christ 
Today" at a university seminar. 
</P>
<P>
In a decision issued Monday, the Supreme Court voted 5 to 4 to give the states 
broader powers to restrict the availability of abortions. The ruling narrowed 
the court's 1973 decision legalizing abortion.

The Centers for Disease Control reported Friday that at least five of 11 
physical fitness goals for 1990, which it outlined at the beginning of the 
decade, probably won't be met. 
</P>
<P>
"Evidence indicates that regular physical activity reduces the incidence of . . 
. many medical conditions," the CDC said in its weekly report, citing the 
benefits of exercise in fighting heart disease, colon cancer, diabetes and 
obesity. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the government's 1990 "Objectives for the Nation," published in 1980, 
and the progress -- or lack thereof -- that has been made include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The proportion of adults ages 18-65 participating three times a week in 
vigorous, 20-minute exercise should exceed 60%. Unlikely to be met; a 1984-87 
survey shows that about 8% of adults exercise regularly at such a level. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Half of Americans 65 and older should walk, swim or engage in other 
"appropriate" aerobic exercise at least three times a week. Not likely; a 1985 
survey showed that while 46% of older Americans said they walked for exercise, 
only 8% met the three-times-a-week, 20-minute level. 
</P>
<P>
 -- More than 90% of children ages 10-17 should participate three times a week 
in 20-minute sessions of vigorous exercise. Not likely to be met; a 1984 survey 
found that 66% of children exercised at that level.

COCAINE WORTH $1 BILLION SEIZED ON SHIP FROM PANAMA

<P>
With the permission of the Panamanian government in exile, federal agents 
stopped a ship from Panama City and confiscated 3,359 pounds of cocaine, one of 
the largest seizures in U.S. history, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Adm. Paul A. Yost, Coast Guard commandant, flew here from Washington for a news 
conference on the seizure, which he called special because the street value of 
the confiscated cocaine could have reached nearly $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The 162-foot cement carrier Barlovento was heading for Puerto Plata, Dominican 
Republic, from Tampico, Mexico, when it was intercepted Wednesday by two Coast 
Guard cutters about 180 miles southwest of Key West. 
</P>
<P>
An initial search did not uncover any cocaine, but the suspicious behavior of 
crew members prompted the Coast Guard to seek permission from the Panamanian 
government in exile in Washington to escort the ship to Key West for a more 
thorough search, the Customs Service said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Panama is ruled by the regime of Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, who faces indictment 
in the United States for drug smuggling, but the United States recognizes 
exiled Panamanian President Eric A. Delvalle.

RECORD $990,000 PAID FOR 1804 COIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the most prized coins known to collectors was sold at auction Friday to 
a Los Angeles collector for a record $990,000, the highest amount ever bid for 
a coin. 
</P>
<P>
Hugh Sconyers of the American Rare Coin Fund in Los Angeles purchased an 1804 
silver dollar at a Chicago auction, paying $900,000 for the coin plus a $90,000 
auction fee. 
</P>
<P>
"It's perhaps one of the most famous coins in all of numismatics, and our fund 
feels that it represents a good long-term value," Sconyers said after the 
purchase, describing it as a "cut-and-dried business decision." 
</P>
<P>
The coin was one of only 15 of its type struck by the U.S. mint for use by 
ambassadors as gifts to foreign governments. Seven of the 1804 dollars are in 
museums, and individual collectors hold the remaining eight. 
</P>
<P>
The coin was sold by Leon Hendrickson, owner of a Winchester, Ind., coin shop. 
</P>
<P>
Hendrickson acquired the so-called "Dexter" specimen of the 1804 dollar nearly 
four years ago, paying $500,000 for it. The dollar was once owned by Denver 
banker James V. Dexter, who acquired the coin for $1,000 in 1885 and 
counterstamped a tiny D on the reverse. 
</P>
<P>
The previous auction record price for a U.S. coin was $625,000, paid in 1982 
for an 1870s $5 gold piece.

GOVERNOR'S FAMILY PLANNING BUDGET CUT DENOUNCED AS 'CALLOUS' ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian's deep cut in the state budget for family planning was 
denounced Friday as a "callous and uncaring" action that could cost taxpayers 
$265 million annually in expenses resulting from unintended pregnancies and 
births. 
</P>
<P>
The budget cut is expected to curtail or eliminate a wide array of services -- 
including examinations to detect cancer -- for 235,000 women who will have 
nowhere else to turn for their care, the program's director said. In the Los 
Angeles area alone, 35 clinics are expected to close. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's budget veto also represented a devastating blow to feminist groups 
still reeling from Monday's U.S. Supreme Court decision giving states greater 
leeway to regulate abortion. Family planning providers contended that 
Deukmejian's action, ironically, will lead to thousands of additional abortions 
for California women whose pregnancies could be avoided with proper 
contraceptive care and counseling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cuts Applauded by Some 
</P>
<P>
But anti-abortion activists applauded the cuts as justified because, they said, 
the state-supported clinics have failed to prevent pregnancies and instead have 
relied increasingly on abortion as a form of birth control. 
</P>
<P>
Some abortion opponents, including Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti 
(D-Los Angeles), said the family planning program brought the budget cut on 
itself. Roberti claimed that the clinics have encouraged abortions. 
</P>
<P>
The $24.1-million cut sliced two-thirds from the $36.2 million the Legislature 
had approved for the state Office of Family Planning for the 1989-1990 fiscal 
year, which began July 1. This cut came even as Deukmejian approved 99% of the 
Legislature's nearly $50-billion budget for all state operations, granting 
budget increases to virtually every other major program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Program Singled Out 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian addressed reporters in a brief news conference as he signed the 
budget in his office Friday, but he declined to explain why he singled out the 
family planning program for such a drastic cut. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the governor said the cut was needed to maintain the budget's 
$1.1-billion "prudent reserve" for emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
The only other clue to the rationale behind the governor's decision came 
Thursday in Los Angeles when Deukmejian said in comments after a speech that 
the family planning program had been ineffective and would be better funded by 
private sources. 
</P>
<P>
The Office of Family Planning, part of the state Health Services Department, is 
best known for providing birth control services through contracts with private 
organizations such as Planned Parenthood. Agencies that use the state money are 
permitted to counsel pregnant women about abortion but may not use state funds 
to pay for the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Services 
</P>
<P>
But the family planning budget also provides other services for poor women, 
including Pap smears to detect cervical cancer, breast exams and tests for 
sexually transmitted diseases and the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the program served 471,000 women through more than 500 clinics, 
according to Jerome Hansen, director of the office. Hansen said the budget cuts 
would most likely be distributed across the board by simply reducing the number 
of women served. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got 235,000 women who no longer have access to that care," Hansen said, 
referring to the estimated number of people the program no longer will be able 
to serve. "It's not clear where they're going to get that care, if they are." 
</P>
<P>
Norma Clevenger, executive director of the Planned Parenthood Affiliates of 
California, said the cuts will lead to more pregnancies and births among poor 
women who will no longer be able to get birth control. She pointed to the 
results of a University of California study concluding that for every $1 the 
state spends on family planning, it saves $11 in other costs that would result 
from unintended pregnancies and births. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's Ridiculous' 
</P>
<P>
Under that formula, the $24.1-million cut would amount to about $265 million in 
added costs to the state. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ridiculous to assume that this action is going to do anything except 
increase the need for abortions in this state," Clevenger said. "It is callous 
and uncaring." 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles area, the cuts are expected to force the closure of 35 
private, nonprofit clinics, said Gary Wallach, assistant director of the Los 
Angeles Regional Family Planning Council. Wallach predicted that the cuts will 
lead to 65,000 additional California pregnancies in the next year and 35,000 
added abortions. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to mean a whole lot more unwanted children, and a lot of 
unhappiness in families," Wallach said. "You're going to have more child abuse, 
more drugs, more people in jail. That's the syndrome we've been trying to 
stop." 
</P>
<P>
But Brian Johnston, Western director of the National Right to Life Committee, 
an anti-abortion group, said programs such as Planned Parenthood have failed to 
stop unwanted pregnancies and have instead advocated abortion as a form of 
birth control. 
</P>
<P>
"If they want to get out of the abortion industry, they will get us off their 
backs," Johnston said. "If they were willing to separate abortion from family 
planning they would not be in this predicament." 
</P>
<P>
Senate Leader Roberti, an otherwise liberal Democrat who opposes abortion for 
religious reasons, said he believes that Deukmejian cut "deeper than he had to" 
into family planning. But Roberti suggested, as did Johnston, that the family 
planning agencies brought the problem on themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"I think family planning would have much more across-the-board support if they 
totally got out of the abortion business," Roberti said. "I could then myself 
categorically say the governor was dead wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Roberti and Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) said they hoped to 
negotiate with Deukmejian to have at least part of the family planning budget 
restored.

CAL STATE PLANS TO CHALLENGE ORDER TO REINSTATE PROFESSOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California State University system plans to ask the State Personnel Board 
to reconsider an order reinstating a Cal State Northridge professor fired last 
summer for allegedly offering students grades in exchange for selling raffle 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Northridge President James W. Cleary said in a written statement that 
the university "will pursue whatever course of action is available to have this 
case reconsidered." 
</P>
<P>
The professor, Eleazu Obinna, was suspended by the state board for 90 days for 
unprofessional conduct, but the university was ordered to reinstate him in the 
Pan-African studies department. 
</P>
<P>
In its June 27 decision the board said attorneys for the Cal State system did 
not present enough evidence to show that Obinna offered students "A" grades in 
exchange for selling $100 worth of raffle tickets for the nonprofit United 
Crusade Foundation that Obinna headed. 
</P>
<P>
Obinna admitted that he asked students to sell the tickets on campus but denied 
in sworn testimony earlier this year that the sales were connected to grades. 
The board ruled that he had sold tickets in connection with an upper-division 
field studies course last spring. 
</P>
<P>
The five-member board could decide to hear all or part of the case again, said 
Walter Vaughn, assistant executive officer. "If the board decides against 
reconsidering the case, then that is the end of the process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayer Chapman, attorney for the Cal State system, declined to say on what 
grounds the campus will ask for reconsideration. Generally, he said, such 
requests question "whether all the evidence was properly considered." 
</P>
<P>
Chapman said he did not know when the request would be filed.

INCONCLUSIVE SURVEY STALLS PLAN FOR MINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal officials say a controversial plan to operate an open pit mine in 
exclusive Sand Canyon has been left in limbo because land surveys could not 
determine whether Eureka Consolidated Development has a right to mine the site. 
</P>
<P>
Federal surveyors failed to establish whether a proposed iron silicate ore mine 
is within an area of Angeles National Forest where mining is allowed, said 
Richard Borden, a special projects coordinator for the U.S. Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
Eureka Consolidated staked its claim to the proposed Black Diamond Mine under 
an 1872 federal mining law that allows prospecting on some public lands. But 
the area's rugged terrain -- plus confusing maps from the 1890s -- have made it 
impossible to determine whether the proposed Black Diamond Mine lies within 
legal mining territory. 
</P>
<P>
The questions raised by the surveys prompted the Forest Service to halt work on 
an environmental impact report, Borden said. Resolving the questions would 
require a $200,000 land survey, but "we don't have the money to do that work," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Forest Service spent $15,000 for a survey in December and January, but that 
effort only raised the questions that now perplex the agency, Borden said. 
Although the 1872 law allows mining in national forests, Congress declared 
portions of Angeles National Forest off limits to miners in 1928, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, Borden said, is tracking down the boundary line drawn by Congress. 
"Nobody knows where that line is," he said. The proposed mine is about four 
miles south and one-quarter of a mile east of the Antelope Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The discrepancies in the boundary lines were discovered more than a year ago 
when four Sand Canyon homeowners near the proposed mine became embroiled in a 
property dispute. The dispute came to the attention of Minebusters, a 
homeowners' group, which raised the issue last July when it submitted 55 points 
challenging a draft of the environmental impact report prepared by the Forest 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
Minebusters has not declared victory in its fight, but group leader Mike 
Levison said the inconsistent surveys "pretty much eliminate the prospect of a 
mine there in the immediate future." 
</P>
<P>
But in a June 22 letter, Eureka Consolidated asked the federal Bureau of Land 
Management to survey the proposed mine site. Barbara Maxfield, a bureau 
spokes-woman, said the agency had not yet reviewed the request. A final 
decision will be made by the bureau's state director, Ed Hastey, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Levison said the bureau should not use public funds to promote a private 
venture. "There must be something more important on their agenda than to 
justify a questionable mining claim," he said. If Eureka is serious about 
mining in Sand Canyon, he said, the company should offer to pay for the survey. 
</P>
<P>
George Warsaw, company president, said that Eureka is still committed to the 
Black Diamond Mine and that the survey problem could be resolved soon. "I don't 
imagine it'll take too long," Warsaw said. He refused to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
Minebusters, which has fought the mine for six years, claims that crushers used 
to grind ore into small chunks would disrupt the quiet of the secluded canyon. 
Sand Canyon is considered Santa Clarita's most exclusive area, dotted with 
Tudor-style estates and Arabian horse ranches. 
</P>

of area was voted off limits in 1928. MATT MOODY / Los Angeles Times

charity bingo games may soon wipe out the charity that her 800-seat bingo 
parlor supports, Edith Ryan charged Friday. 
</P>
<P>
And without the charity, she will have to close what has become in terms of 
attendance and revenue the most popular bingo game in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan operates a free physical and psychological therapy program for physically 
disabled young adults with proceeds from thrice-weekly bingo games she stages 
at a warehouse-sized building in Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
Since its start in 1982, Ryan's game has become the richest in Los Angeles, 
where bingo has been a legal method of fund raising for licensed churches, 
schools and charities since 1977. The city's 88 authorized games take in about 
$50 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
But a new city law that limits the number of games that can be played each 
night and restricts the number of players threatens to eliminate the revenues 
needed to run her self-styled "Identity" rehabilitation program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
40 Games a Night 
</P>
<P>
Only 40 games a night can be offered at bingo parlors under one part of the law 
that became effective late last year. And as of Aug. 1, only 350 players will 
be allowed to play in any one game. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, whose huge parlor is filled with folding tables and chairs, says she 
needs at least 60 nightly games and 600 players to support her charity. She has 
requested a waiver from the ordinance, which was approved by a 10-1 City 
Council vote last September. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ryan, the city's crackdown is aimed solely at her. She charges 
that the city has acted to hamstring her game because she has refused to pay 
bribes to officials. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'd paid a bribe, they wouldn't be trying to put me out of business," she 
said. "This is going to kill us. We're ostensibly dead right now." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan said she did not report the alleged bribery solicitations to authorities 
because she felt she lacked evidence to prove her assertion. She said she was 
too naive at the time to have tape-recorded the conversations, which she said 
occurred on more than one occasion. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Bingo Division of the city's Social Services Department who 
regulate the 88 licensed bingo parlors in Los Angeles denied Ryan's 
accusations. They said Friday that the new rules are intended only to protect 
small games run by churches and schools that have been squeezed by larger games 
such as Ryan's. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'That's Crazy' 
</P>
<P>
"Bribes? That's crazy. That's outrageous," said George Delianedis, the acting 
manager and chief investigator of the department. "We cannot and do not accept 
any gifts from any organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"If what she says was the truth, we'd have been in court long ago," he said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say Ryan's game has grossed nearly $25 million since her callers 
first began shouting numbers at an abandoned Canoga Park department store that 
Ryan rented to launch her game. 
</P>
<P>
After prizes and game costs were deducted, city records show that Ryan has paid 
about $3.5 million to her charity. Her game and therapy clinic moved to Warner 
Center in 1985 when the department store site was razed as part of the 
Fallbrook Mall remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials say part of the money earmarked for the charity is being 
used by Ryan to pay $15,000 monthly rent at her De Soto Avenue site. Although 
most of the facility is used as the bingo parlor, several small rooms in front 
are used for therapy sessions that are conducted three days a week for about 20 
disabled clients. 
</P>
<P>
"What you see when you walk in is her charity," Delianedis said. "She says she 
uses the bingo-callers' platform for therapy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$500,000 a Year 
</P>
<P>
Delianedis said the Identity charity nets about $500,000 a year, which would 
provide $25,000 per client if much of it was not spent on Ryan's rent and other 
overhead. 
</P>
<P>
He said state law prohibits Ryan from paying salaries to herself or her bingo 
game operators from bingo proceeds. Ryan said she draws a $750-a-week salary 
solely from the profits of her bingo parlor's snack bar. 
</P>
<P>
She said her bingo games need to generate at least $50,000 a month for the 
charity to pay the physical therapist and psychologist she employs. Ryan said 
she has fired the psychologist and given a layoff notice to the therapist. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan predicted that the new rules would reduce the charity's proceeds to about 
$25,000 a month -- forcing her to offer only "social activities" such as 
TV-watching and pinball games to her handicapped clients after Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ryan, her charity has reached beyond the young people who arrive 
in wheelchairs and on crutches for therapy sessions on Mondays, Wednesdays and 
</P>
<P>
Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
She said she has pumped thousands of dollars into such things as artificial 
limbs for needy accident victims and wheelchair ramps at Pierce College. Dozens 
of disabled individuals have received free trips to camp and have been sent on 
expense-paid excursions, such as those organized for handicapped skiers, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ryan, city bingo regulators have never visited her bingo 
parlor/therapy center to see what she is accomplishing. 
</P>
<P>
Bingo officials have kept close tabs on Ryan's game, however. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, they sought a 30-day shutdown of the Identity game after a 10-month 
investigation allegedly uncovered 10 violations of state and city laws. A 
Superior Court judge blocked the license suspension, calling the action 
unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Retroactive Suspension 
</P>
<P>
Robert Burns, general manager of the Social Services Department, then imposed a 
retroactive 120-suspension of Identity's bingo license. The suspension had no 
practical effect because it covered a period when the game had been voluntarily 
closed by Ryan so she could move from the Fallbrook Mall to Warner Center. But 
it was recorded as a black mark on her record. 
</P>
<P>
Burns, who is on vacation, was unavailable for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But Delianedis said Ryan is the only bingo operator in town who has complained 
about the new law. He said officials will be forced to review Identity's 
charity status if she eliminates services to the handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
"If she cuts off all her services, we'll have to re-evaluate her," he said. "If 
her charity goes under, she goes under." 
</P>
<P>
In the Bingo Queen's parlor, David Austin was hoping Friday that doesn't 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came here eight months ago, I was in a wheelchair," said Austin, a 
21-year-old Canoga Park resident who is recovering from serious head injuries 
caused by a motorcycle accident. 
</P>
<P>
Therapist Angela Ciminiello and aide Michael Rood were assisting Austin as he 
slowly completed his third lap on foot around the huge bingo room -- a distance 
of about three-quarters of a mile. Forming his words carefully, Austin slowly 
explained that his progress will suffer if the therapy program is slashed. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I came here, the hospital said I would never walk again," he said. 
</P>

INQUIRY CONTINUES INTO ARSON AT SYNAGOGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Fire Department investigators are continuing to look for arsonists 
who scorched a Tujunga synagogue and spray-painted it with anti-Semitic 
graffiti, including a Nazi swastika and the initials of the Ku Klux Klan. 
</P>
<P>
A Fire Department spokesman said no witnesses had been found to the fire at the 
Verdugo Hills Hebrew Center in the 10200 block of Tujunga Canyon Boulevard. The 
gasoline fire last Sunday morning caused about $5,000 damage to the center's 
fire-resistant doors but burned out before firefighters arrived at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was reported by synagogue members who smelled smoke when they entered 
the building.

MAN ARRESTED IN DEATH OF ROOMMATE IN LLANO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man described as "an old desert rat" was arrested Friday at his home in the 
Antelope Valley community of Llano on a charge of murder in the death last 
month of his roommate, a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy said. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Greathouse, 63, was arrested in connection with the June 17 shooting 
death of Paul Staten, 47, who died after an argument between the two men, 
Deputy Hal Grant said. Greathouse was being held without bail at the Antelope 
Valley sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
Greathouse was arrested the day of the shooting, but released the next day 
because investigators thought that the shooting might have been accidental. 
</P>
<P>
Grant said the Antelope Valley office of the Los Angeles County district 
attorney decided Friday to pursue murder charges against Greathouse. He was 
arrested without incident at his home near California 18 and 233rd Street. 
</P>
<P>
A sergeant at the Antelope Valley sheriff's station described Greathouse as "an 
old desert rat" who sometimes sat in a rocking chair beside the highway waving 
at motorists.

MARY'S DANISH SELLS OUT THE ROXY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG LEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Riding high on the local success of its debut album "There Goes the 
Wondertruck," Mary's Danish graduated from minor club status to headlining a 
sold-out Roxy on Thursday night. Part of the sextet's burgeoning popularity is 
based on "Don't Crash the Car Tonight," a hot KROQ-FM item filled with enough 
late-night despair and rumbling, roaring energy to please the pickiest of X 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
And X -- the much admired Los Angeles rock band led by John Doe and Exene 
Cervenka -- does mark one of the several roads the energetic Mary's Danish 
travels. Singers Gretchen Seager and Julie Ritter often resemble dueling 
Exenes, the blond Seager's hollow-toned drawl caroming off the dark-haired 
Ritter's nasal, histrionic squall. And it works -- at first. 
</P>
<P>
On songs like "Mary Had a Bat" and "Hey There Man," the women's idiosyncratic 
harmonizing created a striking complement to some bluesy rock 'n' soul grooves 
reminiscent of a Haight-Ashbury party band. (How did these two former UCLA 
French majors develop those Southern hick accents? Chalk it up to that L.A. 
street-rocker/poet-discovers-Americana aesthetic that confuses country and 
Western with Hollywood and Western.) 
</P>
<P>
But without the personality, poetic suspense and X-perience of its role models 
behind it, the static vocal assault eventually became an irritating drone. 
</P>
<P>
But Mary's Danish (which returns to the Roxy on Monday and Tuesday, opening for 
Stan Ridgway) was a delectable confection compared to second-billed Too Free 
Stooges, a dead-on-arrival joke band featuring two guys impersonating tacky 
lounge comedians in front of a trio playing hoary Cream songs and "Jesus Christ 
Superstar." CRAIG LEE

SECOND CITY SAGS A BIT UNDER 'PIER PRESSURE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The least we can expect out of Second City is for it to be funny. The group's 
second show at its new Santa Monica outpost, "Santa Monica Pier Pressure," 
meets that standard. But the writing doesn't live up to the expectations 
engendered by the Second City name or by this group's first show. 
</P>
<P>
Only three of the first show's seven cast members are in "Pier Pressure," but 
they're joined by three newcomers, two of them from other Second City venues. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Kind makes the biggest splash of any of the newcomers. This is almost 
literally true; Kind is a big guy, with a big mouth that's perfect for the 
roles of a telephone screamer who's talking to his daughter's suitor, a 
vengeful Lotto winner, a man who brags to his wife about his affair with a 
movie star, and an all-knowing waiter who offers silent psychological 
counseling as a side order. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan Stiles, whose long neck is a natural comic resource, sometimes adds 
especially beady eyes that serve him well in a number of situations. Making her 
Second City debut, Diane Stilwell moves easily between self-effacing and 
self-absorbed roles. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who remain from the first show, Robin Duke gets the showiest 
moments. As a snooty boutique clerk, she contorts her body for maximum comic 
results. Dana Anderson and Chris Barnes also bounce skillfully through a 
variety of characterizations. 
</P>
<P>
It's the material that isn't particularly ambitious. 
</P>
<P>
This group's first show examined AIDS and homelessness in sketches that 
ventured beyond the easy laugh. It included a relatively daring song about gang 
warfare; in this show, the opening bit mentions the Crips and the Bloods but 
turns out to be about something entirely different -- and more innocuous. 
</P>
<P>
"Pier Pressure" does address a few topical issues -- the Supreme Court's recent 
decisions, Mikhail Gorbachev's appeal to Americans, and the continuing 
Japanization of America (a musical number that could use a bit more rehearsal) 
-- but not in ways that are particularly enterprising or probing. 
</P>
<P>
The opening night performance included very little improvisation, and the two 
stabs in that direction seemed tentative. In fact, one sketch -- an amusing 
parody of performance art -- was improvisatory in name only; the audience 
suggestions didn't have much to do with the effects of the piece. 
</P>
<P>
That piece, however, did include such excellent work from musical director Fred 
Kaz and the uncredited lighting designer that one wonders why so many Second 
City sketches have such limited production values. The first act is 
particularly bereft of visual design; when the audience finally sees a streak 
of visual ingenuity in a campground sketch in the second act, it's a relief. 
</P>
<P>
"Pier Pressure" is enjoyable, but it doesn't lift Second City above the 
competition (most notably, the Groundlings) in the manner you would expect from 
a full-time Equity-contract company with the pedigree that Second City has. 
Peter Torokvei is the director. 
</P>

p.m., Fridays and Saturdays at 8 and 10:30 p.m., Sundays at 7:30 p.m. Tickets:

'HORIZON' OFFERS A LOOK AT LOVEMAKING IN THE WILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY ATKINSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Sex dominates the world," believes Princeton biology professor James Gould, 
who goes on to back up his assertion -- without once mentioning Freud -- in the 
quirky premiere of "Horizon," a 12-part science series that KCET has picked up 
from the BBC. 
</P>
<P>
"Making Sex Pay" (9 tonight, Channel 28) is the provocative title of this 
50-minute (eye-) opener. No, Geraldo Rivera doesn't show up with a segment on 
prostitution. The whole program is devoted to detailing the sex lives of 
animals (with an emphasis on birds, fish and a variety of icky insects) and how 
this relates to human erogenous behavior. 
</P>
<P>
If you can make your way through the occasionally beastly aspects of lovemaking 
in the wild -- which reaches its nadir in scenes of females eating males while 
they copulate (the operative word here) -- information, insights and humor 
await you. 
</P>
<P>
Among the things we learn: why many females are "more choosy" than males, why 
some males tend to jump in rudely and ask questions later (while others go 
through elaborate display or gift-giving procedures), why there's a continual 
battle of the sexes in nature, and why males fight each other over females. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's an array of oddities: a water bug who wants to make sure his 
wife's offspring are his, jealous male birds, sneaky female birds, animals who 
"cheat." Also -- not to leave out our own species, there's a section on why men 
and women alike look for kindness and intelligence in mates over all other 
qualities. 
</P>
<P>
The program has its own quirks. The photography seems grainy and unevenly 
colored after all the superb nature photography we're used to on PBS and 
elsewhere. And it starts out narrated by an unseen British voice, which 
introduces us to Gould and is never heard again. TERRY ATKINSON

WEEKEND TV: CABLE, FOX BROADCASTING SHOULDER THE BURDEN OF AVOIDING THE RERUN 
RUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the three major networks hunkered down in summer reruns, it's up to cable

of Charles Dickens' great novel, "Great Expectations," Sunday at 8 p.m. Jean 
Simmons stars as the eccentric Miss Havisham, with Anthony Hopkins as Magwitch, 
Martin Harvey as the young Pip and Anthony Calf as the adult Pip. The 
miniseries concludes Monday and Tuesday at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday also marks the debut of a new Fox series, "Totally Hidden Video," 8:30

Tea, one of the world's most popular beverages, can be a worthy alternative to 
coffee, soda or wine. Here is a sampling of 10 ideas to pique the interest of 
the tea lover and to intrigue others who have not yet been initiated to the 
pleasures of tea and the ceremonies that can surround it.

CRITICS DOUBT BRADY PROPOSAL WILL WORK; 
</P>
<P>
U.S. PLAN FOR THIRD WORLD DEBT STRUGGLES FOR ACCEPTANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration's controversial new Third World debt strategy is facing 
a critical test in the next several weeks -- whether it can be made to work or 
will have to be supplanted to keep Latin America's economic problems from 
boiling over into political turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
Although Mexico and commercial banks are expected to reach agreement soon on 
the outlines of a debt-reduction package, support for the new U.S. approach 
remains generally lukewarm among creditor banks and debtor nations alike. 
</P>
<P>
And analysts warn that for all the high-flown rhetoric about the benefits of 
reducing some of the region's debt, the plan will be unable to provide even 
minimal debt relief beyond the case of Mexico and one or two other larger Latin 
American countries. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't been able to find anybody outside of the U.S. Treasury who thinks 
this plan is viable," said Alan J. Stoga, international debt analyst for 
Kissinger Associates, a New York-based consulting firm. "There is criticism of 
it from virtually all sides." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. debt proposal, unveiled with fanfare by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. 
Brady March 10, marked a major departure from the previous strategy. That plan, 
formulated by Brady's predecessor, James A. Baker III, asked banks to lend even 
more money to debtors such as Mexico and Brazil. The Brady proposal, by 
contrast, seeks to reduce national debt burdens by asking banks to forgive 
portions of the debt in return for International Monetary Fund and World Bank 
guarantees for the remainder. 
</P>
<P>
But critics quickly spotted two problems with the Brady proposal. First, 
reducing debt rather than providing new loans simply could not produce the 
amount of relief that debtor countries require to finance their needed economic 
overhaul as well as to resume growth. Second, other industrial countries did 
not want government-financed institutions such as the World Bank and IMF to use 
taxpayer dollars to underwrite any concessions the banks might make. 
</P>
<P>
As a consequence, although U.S. officials do not acknowledge it, the Brady plan 
has changed since being unveiled. There is now far more emphasis on new lending 
rather than debt reduction. Second, the roles of the World Bank and IMF have 
proven far smaller than the Administration first envisioned, reducing the 
amount of available debt reduction. 
</P>
<P>
What the expected accord with Mexico would accomplish is to blunt, at least for 
the moment, the prospect that the growing dissatisfaction with the Brady plan 
might seriously embarrass President Bush at next weekend's seven-nation 
economic summit in Paris. French President Francois Mitterrand, always ready to 
upstage the United States, has invited leaders of 22 debtor countries to an 
eve-of-summit dinner to discuss Third World debt. 
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand's gambit -- designed to drum up support for a rival French proposal 
to boost liquidity worldwide to help underwrite debt-reduction efforts for 
Third World countries -- was not expected to get very far at the summit. The 
seven leaders still were expected to reaffirm their support for the Brady 
proposal, albeit unenthusiastically. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. officials had feared that a blowup of the negotiations with Mexico 
might have enabled Mitterrand to push through a call for a worldwide conference 
on the debt issue. That almost certainly would have wrested control of the 
situation from the United States, weakened the dollar and led to additional 
chaos and increased political restlessness in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the medium-term outlook is far from sanguine. The debt situation in 
the region has been deteriorating rapidly. Argentina is in its worst financial 
straits in years. Brazil just last week suspended or delayed some payments on 
its debt. Venezuela's situation is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Situation Cited 
</P>
<P>
Six months ago, virtually all the region's countries except Peru and Costa Rica 
were maintaining debt payments. Today, however, only Mexico is paying on 
schedule. And several, such as Argentina, are on the brink of a debilitating 
currency crisis. 
</P>
<P>
What is more, the political situation in Latin America is becoming steadily 
more alarming. Years of hyperinflation and declining living standards have 
radicalized the small but emerging middle class in most of the larger debtor 
countries, making it all the more difficult for the new democratic governments 
in the region to maintain popular support. 
</P>
<P>
Argentina's incumbent government has already lost to the radical Peronist 
party, and Brazil's centrist political machine is under serious challenge for 
the November election. Venezuela, whose economic problems earlier this year led 
to riots in which almost 300 persons were killed, is in something of a 
political limbo. Mexico so far still is doing well, and the government is 
enjoying strong popularity but officials here worry that could wane. 
</P>
<P>
Until late this past week, even some Bush loyalists had been searching for 
alternatives. The White House National Security Council, concerned that other 
Latin American debtors soon may follow Argentina on a more radical path, had 
been pondering an aid plan for Mexico to keep the situation from mushrooming 
into a full-blown political problem. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Machinery Bypassed 
</P>
<P>
And on Wednesday, Baker, who is now secretary of State, took a U.S. appeal for 
$1 billion for the Philippines directly to American allies in the Pacific, 
effectively bypassing the Brady plan machinery. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the pressure for an accord between Mexico and the banks has come mostly 
from the Administration, largely with the summit "deadline" in mind. Although 
Brady had refused for weeks to inject himself in the talks, aides said he spent 
much of the past two weeks trying to keep the talks from falling apart -- an 
outcome that could have scuttled the entire debt strategy. 
</P>
<P>
As late as Thursday, Brady was professing to be unconcerned over whether a 
debt-reduction agreement for Mexico could be reached before the summit. "It 
would be very exciting if it were done in time by the summit, but to me, if it 
isn't done by the summit it'll be done shortly thereafter," Brady told 
reporters then. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the impasse between the Mexicans and the banks has continued so 
long spawned increasing resentment in the government of Mexican President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari. "The U.S. really is not providing the leadership 
that it used to, not on our own situation, not on the debt problem as a whole," 
a well-placed Mexican official said before the pact was signed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stakes Growing 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, for all its difficulties, the Brady plan has not gone entirely 
sour. The Group of Seven, a forum for finance ministers and central bankers of 
the countries whose leaders will participate in the summit, has endorsed the 
proposal, despite some dissension. 
</P>
<P>
And the IMF and the World Bank quickly agreed to allocate portions of their 
loans for debt relief. The two organizations already have lent sizable sums to 
Mexico and Venezuela under the new Brady formula, and Japan has pledged to 
contribute $6.5 billion to help underwrite efforts to attract banks to discount 
some of their loans to debtor countries. 
</P>
<P>
What happens next in the new debt strategy still is unclear. Despite the 
expected accord for Mexico, there are not many other candidates in sight for 
debt reduction. International officials say Venezuela simply does not want to 
undertake the kinds of sweeping economic reforms that would be required to 
qualify for the Brady plan. Costa Rica is a possibility. But the rest are 
unlikely to win any concessions from the banks. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the stakes are growing. A Mexican official pointed out that the debt 
issue "is not just a financial problem, but one that goes to the heart of 
determining whether there is political stability in the country. My worry is 
when the solution comes, it will come too late."

FED EASES CREDIT A NOTCH; SMALL BANK CUTS PRIME; 
</P>
<P>
BOARD COMMITTEE'S POLICY SHIFTS FROM COOLING INFLATION TO PREVENTING RECESSION 
</P>

<P>
The Federal Reserve allowed a key interest rate to fall slightly on Friday, a 
signal that it has eased credit another notch, government officials and private 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
The central bank, which had been taking steps to hold the federal funds rate at 
about 9.5% for the past month, left it trading at 9.25% on Friday rather than 
draining significant amounts of cash from the banking system to keep interest 
rates up. By the end of the day, the federal funds rate had dipped further -- 
to 9.125%. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Southwest Bank of St. Louis lowered its prime lending rate Friday to 
10.5% from 11%. The bank is often a bellwether for major money center banks, 
and several economists suggested that the big banks are likely to make similar 
cuts in their own prime rates on Monday. Many small business and consumer 
loans, particularly the increasingly popular home equity loans, are tied to the 
prime. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed began relaxing its grip on credit generally last month, reversing a 
16-month-long policy of pushing interest rates higher as part of its effort to 
fight inflation. That turnaround followed a sharp internal debate among Fed 
policy-makers, with some officials arguing that interest rates needed to fall 
to help avoid a recession and others contending that the Fed should not retreat 
because of the threat of higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed's move followed a two-day meeting of its policy-making Open Market 
Committee on Wednesday and Thursday. Although the federal funds rate had 
drifted down to 9.375% late Thursday on financial market speculation that the 
Fed had decided to ease credit, analysts said it was not clear until the Fed's 
action Friday that it wanted interest rates to fall. 
</P>
<P>
"It is now clear the Fed has taken another one-quarter-point easing move," said 
Kathleen Cooper, chief economist at Security Pacific National Bank in Los 
Angeles. "And I wouldn't be surprised to see it go the rest of the way to 9% if 
the inflation figures next week look good." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Signs of Softening 
</P>
<P>
The Fed conducts monetary policy on a day-to-day basis, mainly by actions that 
change the federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other on 
overnight loans. Infrequently, the central bank also signals its intentions by 
announcing an increase or decrease in the discount rate, a special borrowing 
rate used by financial institutions. The Fed's discount rate is currently 7%. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed's modest easing followed Friday's employment report, which provided 
further evidence of a soft -- but still growing -- economy and relatively 
modest inflation pressures. Fed officials, as is their policy, did not comment 
on the central bank's money market actions. 
</P>
<P>
Interest rates fell across the board and the stock market rose sharply in 
response to the Fed's latest credit-easing move, which was widely anticipated 
because of recent signs of economic weakness. 
</P>
<P>
But financial markets currently reflect an expectation that interest rates will 
decline sharply over the next few months, and several analysts warned that 
investors may be disappointed if the Fed continues to move cautiously in easing 
its credit grip. 
</P>
<P>
"The markets have gotten too far ahead of the Fed," said David Hale, chief 
economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, 
Hale added, "is pursuing a policy of gradualism, and I don't think he is going 
to ease as much as the markets expect." 
</P>
<P>
Adding to that caution was the Fed's release Friday of the minutes from its May 
16 Open Market Committee meeting, which disclosed that several members of the 
12-member panel still favored continuing the Fed's policy of tilting toward 
tighter money. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One Member Dissented 
</P>
<P>
At that meeting, the Fed agreed to move toward a stance "that would make an 
easing or a tightening of policy equally likely, depending on economic and 
financial developments and the behavior of the monetary aggregates." 
</P>
<P>
There was only one dissenter to the decision, St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank 
President Thomas C. Melzer, who favored an easier credit stance because he was 
worried that slow growth in the money supply was raising the risk of recession. 
</P>
<P>
While most Fed members have tended to play down the importance of money supply 
figures in recent years because they have been an unreliable guide to economic 
activity during the 1980s, the minutes disclosed that other policy-makers were 
also beginning to worry about sluggish growth in the money supply. 
</P>
<P>
"Members attached considerable importance to the need for an upturn in monetary 
growth," the minutes read. "A failure of monetary growth to revive during this 
period might well signal some further weakening in the business expansion and 
warrant a special consultation of the committee." 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan conducted an informal telephone conference in late May, officials 
say, in which committee members agreed to allow the Fed chairman to ease credit 
in response to signs of economic weakness. 
</P>
<P>
At the May meeting, the Fed also authorized its New York bank, which conducts 
currency transactions, to buy more foreign currencies as part of the 
government's attempts to keep the dollar from rising. The Fed boosted the limit 
on foreign currency holdings from $12 billion to $15 billion at the meeting and 
was forced to raise the ceiling again on June 14 to $18 billion.

U.S. JOBLESS RATE EDGES UP TO 5.2% DURING MONTH; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCIAL MARKETS RALLY ON SIGN NATION'S ECONOMY IS HEADED FOR 'SOFT LANDING' 
</P>

<P>
The overall unemployment rate edged upward to 5.2% in June from May's 5.1%, 
while a gradually slowing economy generated 180,000 new payroll jobs, somewhat 
fewer than expected, the Labor Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In California, the civilian unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage point 
to 5.6%. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, the recession-sensitive goods-producing sector of the economy lost 
51,000 jobs in May, 31,000 of them from factory payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
The discouraging news about job creation was offset in part by a steep upward 
revision in May's new jobs to 207,000 from an anemic 101,000 first estimated a 
month ago. Nevertheless, the number of jobs grew at an average monthly rate of 
less than 200,000 for the two months, down from about 300,000 a month for 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But there were indications that the economy is declining on a controlled glide 
path rather spinning out of control. Hourly wages rose only negligibly in June 
for the second consecutive month after steady increases earlier this year 
seemed to herald the start of a classic wage-price spiral brought on by a 
tightening labor market. 
</P>
<P>
Financial markets rallied, apparently in the belief that the Federal Reserve 
Board is now more worried about recession than inflation and that it now will 
gradually loosen the monetary tourniquet. The Dow Jones industrial index rose 
25.42 points, and bond prices also rose. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Signs of Recession 
</P>
<P>
"The soft landing remains right on track," said Kathleen Cooper, chief 
economist at Security Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a weaker economy, but there is no suggestion we're slithering close 
to a recession," added David Levine of Sanford Bernstein &amp; Co., an 
investment banking firm in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"In a typical recession, you get minus 300,000 jobs" a month in goods-producing 
industries for several months at a time, Levine said. "So we're only one-sixth 
of the way there." 
</P>
<P>
David Wyss of Data Resources Inc., a consulting firm in Lexington, Mass., 
called the latest jobs report "unremarkable." 
</P>
<P>
"Manufacturing continues weak, reflecting weak consumption in autos in 
particular," he said. "Factory hours declined slightly to 40.9 hours a week, 
the shortest since September, 1987, and 50,000 factory jobs have been lost over 
the past three months. Of the 31,000 factory jobs lost in June, 15,000 were in 
motor vehicles and parts." 
</P>
<P>
But Wyss was encouraged by the hefty upward revision in May job creation, and 
by the increase of only 1 cent an hour in labor costs. 
</P>
<P>
"That amounts to two consecutive months with almost no wage cost increase after 
a larger jump (7 cents) in April," he said. "That should make the Fed happy: 
They can loosen without much fear of wage inflation." 
</P>
<P>
Donald Straszheim of the Merrill Lynch brokerage house in New York said the 
worst case for the economy is a wage-price spiral in which workers negotiate 
higher wages based on higher prices, and the higher wages in turn force higher 
prices on the goods the workers produce. 
</P>
<P>
"The decline in manufacturing employment is not worrisome," Straszheim said. 
"It's a small price to pay for a slower economy with less inflation, because a 
return to a wage-price spiral would be the worst of all worlds." 
</P>
<P>
The small increase in the June unemployment rate was caused primarily by a big 
jump of 485,000 in the number of Americans in the job market last month, after 
a decline of 60,000 in May. The rate in June was 5.2% if the armed services are 
counted, 5.3% if only civilians are counted. 
</P>
<P>
Teen-age joblessness rose from 15.2% to 15.6% in June. For black female 
teen-agers, the unemployment rate shot up from 28.4% in May to 40.2% last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
The number of Americans participating in the job market rose to 66.9%, an 
all-time high, while the equivalent participation rate for civilians rose by a 
like amount to 66.6%, also a record.

TIMES MIRROR BUYS SMALL STAKE IN MCCLATCHY PAPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS B. ROSENSTIEL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Times Mirror Co. announced Friday that it had acquired a small interest in 
McClatchy Newspapers, the closely held Sacramento company best known for its 
ownership of the Bee newspapers of California. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a stock arrangement that virtually assures family control of 
McClatchy, analysts saw the acquisition by Times Mirror, which publishes the 
Los Angeles Times, as simply a long-term investment without any intention 
toward a merger or takeover. 
</P>
<P>
"Psychologically, it does tend to link the two companies, but whether that 
really means anything is open to question," said Bruce Thorp, who analyzes 
newspaper stocks for Provident National Bank in Philadelphia. "Without 
cooperation of all the McClatchy insiders, Times Mirror couldn't really be up 
to much of anything," Thorp said. 
</P>
<P>
Times Mirror's acquisition amounts to 7% of McClatchy's Class A common stock, 
or 293,900 shares, and cost the company about $6 million on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
But because only 14% of McClatchy shares are publicly traded, Times Mirror's 
stake really amounts to less than 1% of McClatchy overall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Typical in Industry 
</P>
<P>
The rest of McClatchy shares are family-controlled Class B stock, which has 10 
times the voting power per share of the publicly traded Class A stock. To 
further maintain family control, any Class B shares sold to outsiders 
immediately converts to Class A status. Hence, any sale of family shares 
actually increases family control. 
</P>
<P>
Such multi-tier stock structures are designed to protect against takeovers and 
are typical of newspaper companies. Times Mirror itself has a multi-tier stock 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to McClatchy, Times Mirror Chairman Robert F. Erburu 
even called officials at McClatchy before the shares were purchased to 
privately assure them that the company was buying the stock only as an 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
McClatchy first sold shares to the public in February, 1988. Earlier this year, 
McClatchy Chairman C. K. McClatchy died, and on June 27 his estate sold 1 
million shares of his stock to help pay estate taxes. It was not clear whether 
the roughly 300,000 shares that Times Mirror purchased involved any of those 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Owns 12 Daily Papers 
</P>
<P>
McClatchy owns the Sacramento Bee and 11 other daily papers, including the 
Fresno and Modesto Bees, the Tacoma News Tribune in Washington state and the 
Anchorage Daily News in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to The Times, Times Mirror publishes Newsday in Long Island and New 
York, the Baltimore Sun and Evening Sun, and four other newspapers. The Los 
Angeles-based company's interests also include broadcast and cable television 
and book, magazine and other publishing. 
</P>
<P>
In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, McClatchy Class A 
stock gained 62.5 cents a share to close at $22.25. Times Mirror shares closed

Americans took out $3.6 billion more in consumer debt than they repaid in May 
as the pace of borrowing turned upward again, the government reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve Board said consumer credit in May rose at a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 6.2%, up from the 4.3% pace of the previous month. 
Still, it was a smaller rise than the gains of 6.6% in March and 9.5% in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending, which is closely watched as a barometer of the economy's 
health since it represents two-thirds of overall economic activity, had 
increased 8.5% during 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Latta, an economist with Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass., said 
the report suggests consumer confidence.

Bilzerian Denies Charges: Former Singer Co. Chairman Paul A. Bilzerian denied 
charges made by the SEC in a civil suit filed last week that he has transferred 
assets out of the United States to prevent the government from recovering more 
than $31 million in profit it says he made from an unsuccessful takeover 
attempt for Hammermill Paper Co. and other investments. "I do not have any 
assets located outside the United States," Bilzerian said in papers filed with 
the U.S. District Court in Washington.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: HOW TO FIGURE SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Carla Lazzareschi 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: If we correctly understand the latest information we received from 
the Social Security Administration, it would appear that the longer my husband 
works, the lower his Social Security benefits will be. 
</P>
<P>
Here's what happened. After working full time and paying the maximum possible 
Social Security taxes for 28 years, my husband had a heart attack at age 55. 
Several years later, he returned to work on a part-time basis. Now it seems 
that the Social Security Administration will average in these part-time years 
when it calculates whatever benefits he is entitled to. My husband will be 62 
next year, and although he would like to continue working, maybe he should just 
retire to preserve his benefits status. -- M. L. C. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Now, hold on. According to the Social Security Administration, your 
husband's part-time job should actually be helping, not hurting, his expected 
Social Security benefits. Here's why: 
</P>
<P>
Social Security benefits are calculated according to a multi-step formula that 
takes into account the recipient's date of birth, the number of years he or she 
has worked, as well as the amount of money he or she has contributed to the 
Social Security fund. 
</P>
<P>
Using that formula, your husband will be awarded benefits based on the highest 
34 years of his earnings. Now, since you say he was employed full time for 28 
years, if he retires next year, his average will include six years of "zero" 
contributions to Social Security. However, if he adds contributions from 
part-time employment, that average will be increased. 
</P>
<P>
"Any amount of earnings is better than nothing," says Roy Aragon, of the Los 
Angeles branch office of the Social Security Administration. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, please remember that if your husband elects to take his Social 
Security benefits at age 62, his average monthly check will be about 20% lower 
than it would be if he waited until age 65 to receive benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Q: In a recent column, you said two single adults, age 55 or more, who share 
ownership of a residence would each be entitled to exclude $125,000 of gains on 
their income taxes when they sell their house. This means that these two people 
could shelter as much as $250,000 in real estate gains. 
</P>
<P>
However, you said that a married couple would be entitled to use just a single 
$125,000 exemption. It just seems to me that your answer makes a good case for 
a married couple to divorce and then continue to co-own and reside in their 
house for the next three years. Would each party then be eligible for the 
$125,000 exclusion? It doesn't seem right, does it? -- M. G. 
</P>
<P>
A: Maybe not to you, but our tax advisers say the Internal Revenue Service has 
no problems with this scenario. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, our advisers say the IRS is interested in your marital status at the 
time you sell your house, not your situation when you bought it. So, if you get 
divorced and meet the minimum residency requirement of living there for three 
of the last five years, you and your wife may each claim the $125,000 profit 
exemption. Even if one spouse moves out, that person can still claim the 
exclusion if he or she meets the residency requirement. 
</P>
<P>
One caveat: Unlike with married couples, each member of an unmarried 
home-owning group must be at least age 55 to claim the exemption. In a marital 
ownership situation, the couple may qualify for the $125,000 exemption if just 
one member has reached age 55. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have been buying shares and reinvesting dividends in a utility company 
since late 1979. My cost basis ranges from $10.50 to about $40 per share, and I 
now own about 6,700 shares. This company is expected to merge with a larger 
utility next year, and when the deal is completed, I should have about 9,100 
shares of the second company. Let's say I want to sell 200 shares of this 
second company's stock; how do I figure my cost basis? -- H. E. M. 
</P>
<P>
A: Actually, despite the complicated maneuverings, it's going to be easier than 
you might think. 
</P>
<P>
But, first, let's discuss why you must be able to determine your cost basis. 
The reason you need to know the cost basis of your holdings is to compute your 
taxable gain or loss when you sell any of your investments. Practically 
speaking, an owner's basis in stock is simply his cost minus any purchase 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
And this is the formula you should use to compute your basis in the shares you 
receive in the second company. Simply add together your total investment in the 
original utility company -- purchases and dividend reinvestments -- and divide 
the amount by the number of shares you receive in the second company. So it you 
have a total investment in the initial company of $150,000 and you receive 
9,100 shares of the new company, your cost basis of these new shares is $16.48. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is it true that if you own stock in a particular company, you can attend its 
shareholder meetings and write off the expenses as a tax deduction? -- R. L. 
</P>
<P>
A: Let me see. . . . Let's rephrase that question. Are you really asking 
whether you can buy shares in Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and write off the cost 
of a trip to San Francisco as a business expense? If so, the answer is "no." 
</P>
<P>
Unless your stake in a particular company is so significant that your presence 
is absolutely required to protect your position, you can safely assume that 
your attendance at an annual meeting will not meet the IRS' definition of an 
"ordinary and necessary expense" of maintaining your investment in the company. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, and just for your additional information, expenses that do meet 
the IRS definition of an "ordinary and necessary" outlay may be deducted from 
your income only to the extent that they exceed 2% of your adjusted gross 
income. 
</P>

column to financial questions of general interest. Please do not telephone.

PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: CREDIT REPAIR CLINICS COULD CLEAN YOU OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Credit repair clinics, or "credit doctors," are flourishing. But while they 
promise to clean up your credit problems, in many cases they only clean out 
your pocketbook. By preying on the ignorance of debt-troubled consumers, the 
clinics defraud them of millions of dollars, government investigators say. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, unscrupulous operators can be easy to spot. And anything they 
claim that they can legitimately do, you can do on your own at little or no 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people who use these clinics are really unaware of the law and 
believe there is something mysterious these companies can do for them," says 
Herschel Elkins, a California senior assistant attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
Credit clinics have thrived largely because of consumers' growing use and 
overuse of credit, resulting in rising personal bankruptcies and credit card 
delinquencies. 
</P>
<P>
For debt-ridden consumers, the clinics' pitch sounds tempting. Often through 
newspaper advertisements, the clinics claim that they can eliminate your credit 
problems by removing adverse information, such as records of late payments or 
collection actions, from your files. Such information is contained in records 
maintained by such credit bureaus as TRW Credit Data, Transunion or CBI. TRW, 
for example, maintains files on about 143 million consumers, with information 
provided by lenders. 
</P>
<P>
The law requires that accurately reported information may remain in your credit 
file for seven years, or 10 years if you declare personal bankruptcy. But 
credit bureaus are required under the Fair Credit Reporting Act to investigate 
and respond to consumer disputes about such information within a reasonable 
time. The Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. agency charged with enforcing the 
act, deems 30 days from receipt of a dispute as a reasonable response time. 
</P>
<P>
Credit clinics seek to exploit this loophole by overwhelming bureaus with so 
many challenges of adverse information that the bureaus won't be able to verify 
the data within the 30-day limit. Thus, the clinics hope, the adverse 
information will be removed. 
</P>
<P>
But if the credit information is correct, it cannot be removed legitimately. If 
eliminated, it is likely to be reinstated when the lender files new reports 
with credit bureaus. 
</P>
<P>
The law also allows credit bureaus to refuse to investigate frivolous disputes. 
TRW has even gone further, refusing to respond to third-party inquiries and 
dealing only with consumers directly, spokeswoman Susan Murdy says. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, credit clinics charge as much as $1,000 for their services -- and 
often get it. But some don't perform promised services or do just a minimal 
amount of work. Others have gone belly up, leaving customers without refunds. 
</P>
<P>
Credit clinics also charge exorbitant fees for services you can easily perform 
yourself for little or no cost. For example, some clinics charge hundreds of 
dollars to provide you with a copy of your credit report and a sample 
application for a secured credit card -- the type that requires a bank account 
or other assets as collateral. But you can get both for free or for a nominal 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
Federal legislation has been proposed to crack down on abuses. Among other 
things, the legislation would require that clinics advise you of your rights 
before signing a contract, fully disclose their services and the cost and allow 
you to cancel the contract. 
</P>
<P>
California already has such a law. But it hasn't been enough to stop the abuses 
because state and federal agencies say they don't have adequate staff to police 
unscrupulous operators. "We could bring actions against 30 or 40 companies next 
week if we had a large enough staff," Elkins says. 
</P>
<P>
The FTC and the Attorney General's office have filed civil suits and obtained 
restraining orders against some of the largest and worst offenders, charging 
that they could not guarantee credit repair as touted. For example, in what may 
be one of the largest settlements of such a case, a California firm, Action 
Credit Systems, agreed earlier this year to refund $1.2 million to customers to 
settle an FTC complaint. 
</P>
<P>
The state Attorney General's office also forced a California man to quit 
holding seminars in which he charged each person $90 for information on how to 
repair credit records. The agency plans to increase actions against other 
abusive practices in the next two months, Elkins says. 
</P>
<P>
But stronger enforcement and tougher laws alone are not enough. The real 
solution will come when consumers become more informed. Here are some tips: 
</P>
<P>
* Know your credit rights. If you act within 30 days of being denied credit, 
federal law entitles you to review the credit report that the lender used in 
making the decision, at no charge. Otherwise, the fee is typically $5 to $15. 
</P>
<P>
Call the credit bureau first to find out the procedure. The two biggest credit 
bureaus in the Los Angeles area are TRW and CBI. Others are listed in the phone 
book. 
</P>
<P>
If you challenge information in your file as inaccurate or fraudulent, credit 
bureaus must investigate and delete information that cannot be verified. If the 
credit bureau deems the information correct and you disagree, you can submit a 
brief statement, which becomes part of your file. 
</P>
<P>
Three free booklets, "Building a Better Credit Record," "The Fair Credit 
Reporting Act" and "Fix Your Own Credit Problems and Save Money," can be 
obtained from the FTC, Room B-3, 6th and Pennsylvania Ave. N.W., Washington, 
D.C. 20580. 
</P>
<P>
* Recognize credit repair rip-offs. Avoid services that claim they can clean up 
your credit record or that are vague about the services they provide. Steer 
clear of those offering to assist you in obtaining your credit report for a 
fee. And avoid those promising to get you a credit card, regardless of your 
credit history. In many cases they will provide you only with an application. 
</P>
<P>
* Complain if you've been duped. In the Los Angeles area, write to the Attorney 
General's Office, 3580 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles, Calif. 90010. Also complain 
to the Federal Trade Commission, 11000 Wilshire Blvd., Room 13209, Los Angeles, 
Calif. 90024, or call its complaint line at (213) 209-7575 between 8:30 a.m. 
and noon weekdays. 
</P>
<P>
You also can sue in small claims court, suggests Ann Guler, an FTC public 
information officer. 
</P>
<P>
* Know how to get legitimate credit counseling. Reputable, low-cost help on 
repaying your creditors, managing debt and setting up a budget is available. 
One service is provided by Consumer Credit Counselors, a nonprofit organization 
with 400 offices nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
For referrals to the office nearest you, call (213) 386-7601 in Los Angeles 
County, (714) 547-8281 in Orange County, (619) 224-2922 in San Diego County and 
(714) 781-0114 in Riverside County. Elsewhere, call the National Foundation for 
Consumer Credit in Silver Springs, Md., at (301) 589-5600. 
</P>
<P>
* Know how to get a secured credit card on your own. Consumer Action, a San 
Francisco consumer group, offers a free list of California institutions that 
offer low-cost, secured cards directly to the public. Send a self-addressed, 
stamped envelope to the organization at 116 New Montgomery St., Suite 223, San 
Francisco, Calif. 94105. 
</P>
<P>
The Bankcard Holders of America also provides lists of secured card issuers, 
along with a pamphlet on credit clinics. Send $3 to the organization at 460 
Spring Park Place, Suite 1000, Herndon, Va. 22070.

UAL STOCK SOARS ON PILOTS' RENEWED INTEREST IN BIDDING 
</P>

<P>
Pilots for UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines, said Friday that they were 
considering a bid for the airline as UAL's stock price soared on growing 
speculation that the company was an acquisition target. 
</P>
<P>
UAL shares, up $35 in the past three weeks, rose $13.50 to close at $166, with 
1.7 million shares changing hands, making it the second most heavily traded 
issue on the New York Stock Exchange. At its current stock price, UAL is worth 
more than $3.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation that UAL might be taken over was triggered by the $3.6-billion 
acquisition of NWA Inc., parent of Northwest Airlines, on June 19, analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The gains and recent heavy volume in UAL suggest that the stock is under 
accumulation, they said. But no bidders have stepped forward. 
</P>
<P>
Because UAL has fewer than 22 million shares outstanding, the stock movement 
has been magnified, with 5% or more of the shares changing hands daily. 
</P>
<P>
Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass, Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis and Pan Am 
Corp. have all been mentioned as potential bidders for UAL. Davis and Pan Am 
were spurned by NWA. 
</P>
<P>
United's 7,000-member Air Line Pilots Assn., which played a large role in 
forcing UAL to restructure in 1987, said it is considering revising a 
$110-a-share conditional bid it made for the company two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the pilots said they were again interested in UAL. "We have been in 
constant communication with our financial advisers and our attorneys. Our 
interest has piqued," said Rick Dubinsky, chairman of the master executive 
council of the Air Line Pilots Assn. "We are back at work to try to come up 
with another opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Dubinsky, chairman of the master executive council of the Air Line Pilots 
Assn., declined to specify a possible price for a revised bid but acknowledged 
that it would have to be significantly higher than the pilots' earlier offer. 
</P>
<P>
UAL spokesman Joe Hopkins declined comment.

U.S. TO BUY $15 MILLION WORTH OF APPLES TO HELP CUT SURPLUS

The Department of Agriculture will purchase $15 million worth of apples to help 
reduce a huge surplus created when consumers stopped buying amid fears over use 
of the chemical Alar, the department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The industry has estimated that 5 million to 7 million boxes of apples from 
last year's crop, valued at between $40 million and $56 million, remain unsold. 
</P>
<P>
The department said apple stocks were 53% greater on May 31 than the average 
for that date in the previous three years, and prices to growers had fallen by 
$3 to $4 per carton from what they were a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Top-grade red apples produced in Washington state were recently selling for 
between $7.50 and $8 per box, about $2 below the cost of production. The 
nation's 20,000 apple growers have estimated losses at well over $100 million 
in sales. 
</P>
<P>
Alar is used to enhance red color, to ease harvesting by delaying ripening so 
that most apples ripen together and to lengthen shelf and storage life. The 
chemical penetrates throughout the fruit tissue and, unlike many pesticides, 
cannot be washed off. 
</P>
<P>
The Alar controversy began in late February when a private environmental 
advocacy group, the Natural Resources Defense Council, said apples treated with 
the chemical substantially increase the risk of cancer in children. 
</P>
<P>
Even though EPA criticized the Natural Resources Defense Council report, the 
agency plans to ban use of Alar and the manufacturer has withdrawn it from the 
U.S. market.

JERRY DUNPHY QUITS KABC TO JOIN KHJ 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jerry Dunphy, anchor of KABC-TV's "Eyewitness News," has turned down a 
"multimillion-dollar" contract offer to stay at the station and instead will 
join Disney-owned KHJ/TV Channel 9 as chief anchor of a new three-hour 
prime-time newscast being developed for debut in January. 
</P>
<P>
Dunphy resigned from KABC Friday after a 14-year tenure; his resignation 
becomes effective Monday. Dunphy will join KHJ before the debut of the 8-11 
p.m. news program as chief anchor of an expanded evening newscast. 
</P>
<P>
Dunphy will be replaced by KABC weekend anchor Harold Greene, who will move to 
the 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. editions of "Eyewitness News," effective Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Crofoot, president and general manager of KABC, said Friday that Dunphy's 
contract expired this week, adding that Dunphy and KABC had been in contract 
negotiations for several months but had reached an impasse. 
</P>

"We made him a multimillion-dollar offer, and he did not accept, and came in 
with an offer from KHJ -- and we chose not to match it," Crofoot said. "Our 
offer was in the millions of dollars; their offer was higher than that. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to keep Jerry Dunphy at KABC. We were very happy with him, and we're 
sorry to see him go. . . . What KHJ is trying to do is hire someone with a very 
high viewer profile, in hopes that his audience will follow." 
</P>
<P>
Crofoot said that failure to reach an agreement with Dunphy over the last 
several months prepared the station for his resignation and allowed them to 
quickly announce Greene as his replacement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Top Anchor' 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, KHJ President and General Manager Blake Byrne called 
Dunphy "unquestionably the top anchor on the West Coast and a legendary figure 
in broadcast journalism." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Saunders, executive vice president and manager of the station, said Dunphy 
will help to plan the direction of the new newscast. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne, Saunders and Dunphy were unavailable for further comment. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, Dunphy served as lead anchor in the nation's first expanded 
newscasts at KNXT (now KCBS-TV). He joined KABC as chief anchor in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Greene, who began his broadcasting career in 1964 at KDIG radio in La Jolla, 
worked at KABC as a news anchor from 1978-80, and returned to the station in 
1982 after serving as managing editor and anchor of the early and late news 
broadcasts of ABC affiliate KGTV in San Diego.

PLAN TO 'RESURRECT' SOUTH-CENTRAL AREA UNVEILED BY BRADLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid the garbage and graffiti of a South-Central Los Angeles street corner, 
Mayor Tom Bradley on Friday announced the formation of a task force to 
"resurrect this community from the grasp of drug peddlers and gang members." 
</P>
<P>
"Neglect, vandalism, crime -- all have eaten away at the spirit of this 
community, but we are determined to bring it back," Bradley said in announcing 
what aides described as the most comprehensive effort yet to revitalize the 
economically blighted sector south of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The task force is to be made up of nine committees, which will explore gangs 
and drugs, economic development, job training, education, neighborhood 
beautification, senior citizen services, affordable housing and other central 
issues. The committees -- made up of city officials, community activists, 
academicians and educators -- are to make recommendations to the mayor in 60 
days. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Subtle Turn 
</P>
<P>
The announcement was seen by some community activists as marking a subtle turn 
in Bradley's political focus. For years, South-Central community leaders have 
grumbled privately that the five-term Democrat has not done enough for the poor 
neighborhoods, though they publicly stood firm with him. 
</P>
<P>
Some community and political leaders from South-Central said Friday that it is 
only now, in possibly his last term in office, that Bradley is confident and 
secure enough as a black politician to take care of the very neighborhoods that 
spawned his career. Others said they see his latest initiative as an attempt to 
put the final touches on his legacy. 
</P>
<P>
"Now he feels free to do it," said Bob Gay, an aide to City Councilman Gilbert 
Lindsay, who represents the district. "He wants to go out in a blaze of glory 
where he started." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sweeping Proposal 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's announcement -- one week after his inauguration and one day after 
an equally sweeping proposal to clean up the city's 28 public housing projects 
-- is one of what aides say will be a series of proposals by Bradley to flesh 
out the general theme of his inauguration speech: to make Los Angeles a more 
livable city. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Mayor Mike Gage took exception to any characterization that Bradley's 
formation of the task force was to make up for lack of attention in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a deviation or a aberration, but a continuation" of Bradley's 
efforts to aid the depressed area, Gage said. "He's making the commitment of 
additional resources now because the need is there." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said the South-Central effort will mean a redeployment of existing city 
services, such as street cleaning and other public works projects, but "much of 
it will be new ideas, new services and programs" to be developed by the 
community leaders on the task force. "We want their input. That's why we're 
here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Time Spans for Projects 
</P>
<P>
Some projects will begin as soon as Monday, when Bradley said workers with the 
Clean and Green youth jobs program will begin cleaning up streets, alleys and 
other public areas. Other programs, such as job training, will take years to 
bear fruit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Central Avenue was once a thriving center for commerce and activity," Bradley 
said. "Over the years, the condition of this lifeline of South-Central has 
deteriorated. Starting at the grass-roots level, we will get every sector of 
this community involved in directing the rebirth of this area. 
</P>
<P>
"We are expecting help from the federal government, but we will not wait for 
other government agencies . . . we will get it done," he said to enthusiastic 
applause from the two dozen civic leaders who stood with him at the 
announcement. The spontaneous reaction of the crowd brought a smiling Bradley 
to repeat his central slogan for the day: "We will get it done." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'He'll Do It Again' 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. E. B. Hill of the Mt. Zion Church in South-Central told the crowd: 
"The thing that makes this exciting today is the one who is making the promise. 
He's the one who said we'll have a successful port. It happened. He said, 
'Let's bring the Olympics to Los Angeles and not go broke doing it.' It 
happened. . . . Now we're here at 45th Street and Central Avenue. He did it 
before and he'll do it again." 
</P>
<P>
Kerman Maddox, a former Bradley aide and now political consultant, said, "It's 
great; it's the kind of thing people have been waiting for." When reminded that 
this is now Bradley's fifth four-year term as mayor, Maddox smiled and said: 
"Better late than never. And now everyone is coming together to celebrate it 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Long Overdue 
</P>
<P>
Though the community leaders agreed that attempting to tackle the job is long 
overdue, most of those interviewed defended Bradley's record of aiding the 
South-Central neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Hill said Bradley had to stabilize and then expand Los Angeles' business 
community in his earlier terms, before taking on massive problems such as 
unemployment, poverty, high school dropouts, drugs and crime that plague 
South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
In Bradley's first four terms, his most notable successes involved expansion of 
the city's port facilities and development of the downtown business district. 
Redevelopment of Los Angeles International Airport was a third leg of the 
economic infrastructure Bradley pieced together to, among other things, create 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Problems 
</P>
<P>
Hill, like others, said it would have been politically impossible for Bradley, 
as the city's first black mayor, to make South-Central a focus in his earlier 
terms of office. 
</P>
<P>
State Assemblywoman Teresa P. Hughes, who represents much of the South-Central 
area, said that as mayor of the whole city, Bradley has had to deal with many 
problems. "This city is so huge" and has so many problems, she said. "Where do 
you put out the fire? Where it is burning the most. And that's right here, 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
Juanita Tate of the Concerned Citizens of South-Central said that a similarly 
sweeping effort to revitalize South-Central in earlier years may not have 
worked. But now, she said, the community is determined to do something about 
its problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Until you educate the people in the neighborhoods (that they can control their 
own destiny), it doesn't matter what the mayor comes down here with," Tate 
said.

PLANE CRASHES IN VENICE STREET; NO ONE INJURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An instructor and student pilot escaped serious injury Friday when their small 
plane lost power, struck utility lines and crash-landed upside down in a Venice 
intersection, dropping its nose gear on a passing car. 
</P>
<P>
The occupants of the Cessna 150 were helped out of the two-seater by passers-by 
who rushed to their aid as downed power lines crackled around the upside-down 
plane. 
</P>
<P>
A nearby motorist, Caryn Doran, 35, of Santa Monica, said she felt "lucky to be 
alive" after a wheel and other equipment broke loose from the aircraft and 
smashed through her car's windshield. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the flight instructor, Albert Henry Schaaf, 42, and student, Julian 
James, 36, were practicing touch-and-go landings at Santa Monica Airport when 
the single-engine plane had an apparent power failure. They attempted to make 
an emergency landing on the beach but realized that they were too far away and 
tried landing on the street instead. 
</P>
<P>
The low-flying plane struck a power line at 7th Street and Rose Avenue, 
breaking off its nose gear. The main wheels caught on two other lines, spinning 
the plane around. A witness said the plane bounced once off the street before 
landing upside down, its propeller hanging inches from the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran over to the plane and unbuckled one of the guys from his seat and pulled 
him out," said Greg Monk, a painting contractor who was working on a building 
near the crash site. 
</P>
<P>
"There were downed power lines all around us," said John McFadden, another 
witness who helped the two men out of the plane. "I heard a crackling sound 
right by my foot. I didn't want to move." 
</P>
<P>
"It's an experience I don't want to go through again," said Kenny Shea, a third 
passer-by who helped the men out of the plane. 
</P>
<P>
Both Schaaf and James walked away from the crash and did not need any medical 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
Doran also escaped injury when the nose gear shattered her windshield. Doran 
said her attention had been diverted because she was looking for a parking spot 
on the street. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had been looking forward, I probably would have gotten glass in my face," 
Doran said. "The metal strut (of the nose gear) came through the window." 
</P>
<P>
"Of course I feel lucky to be alive," she said. "But my insurance company is 
never going to believe this." 
</P>
<P>
The plane is owned by Danford Aviation, based at the Santa Monica Airport. A 
spokesman for the company said he had no idea what might have caused the 
apparent power failure. 
</P>
<P>
After talking with police and a Federal Aviation Administration investigator, 
Schaaf and James declined to discuss the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing is that no one on the street was hurt," Schaaf said. 
</P>
<P>
Said James, who claimed 50 hours of flying time, "Sometimes these things 
happen."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLAN FOR RETURN OF CHILDREN REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Oregon Juvenile Court judge has rejected a plan submitted by the Ecclesia 
Athletic Assn. for the return of 53 children taken into protective custody by 
the state after a child's beating death. 
</P>
<P>
The children were removed from a farmhouse near Sandy owned by the Los 
Angeles-based group after Dayna Broussard, the 8-year-old daughter of group 
founder Eldridge Broussard Jr., was beaten to death during a discipline session 
last October. 
</P>
<P>
Ecclesia members want the children returned to the farm for a summer camp that 
would run from mid-August to mid-October, said Bart Wilson, manager of the 
Clackamas branch of the state Children's Services Division. 
</P>
<P>
But Clackamas County Juvenile Court Judge Robert Morgan rejected the plan 
Thursday, saying it lacked detail and failed to show how funding could be 
raised to take adequate care of the children.

TASK FORCE FORMED TO STUDY LEGALIZING OF STREET VENDORS; 
</P>
<P>
WOO SAYS L.A.'S LAWS ARE TOUGHEST OF ANY MAJOR CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maria Elena Chacon sat silently on the steps of City Hall on Friday morning, 
another face in the crowd as Los Angeles City Councilman Michael Woo announced 
plans for a task force on legalized street vending. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many onlookers, however, Chacon had more than a passing interest in the 
proceedings. The Salvadoran refugee, who supports her family by selling food 
and clothing on the streets of her inner-city neighborhood, said she is tired 
of police cracking down on her business. 
</P>
<P>
"My friends and I have been arrested; they've confiscated our goods; they've 
even taken our personal belongings," the 32-year-old Chacon said through an 
interpreter. "All of us are afraid right now. . . . We fled from oppression. We 
expected to find more opportunity here." 
</P>
<P>
Chacon is looking for answers from Woo's task force, which will spend the next 
three months studying ways to legalize street vending. The task force, made up 
of business people, police and vendors, was appointed by Woo and will make 
recommendations to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Chacon and other vendors, selling everything from hot dogs to hydrangeas, say 
it is time Los Angeles joined other like-sized cities in legalizing the street 
sale of goods. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a problem that the city should have taken into account a long time 
ago," said Francisco Flores, who heads the Assn. of Ambulatory Street Vendors, 
a group of about 200 people who make their living from outdoor sales. "People 
should be able to sell comfortably on the streets, especially when you 
(realize) that this is a city of immigrants." 
</P>
<P>
Woo said he supports the vendors. While the councilman did not offer any 
specific proposals for legalizing street vending, he agreed that there is no 
reason why local vendors should be hounded off of the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"This city has the most restrictive street vending ordinances of any major city 
in the country, maybe even the world," Woo said. "That's absurd. Properly 
regulated, street vending adds vitality to the streets of a city. It also 
provides a livelihood for immigrants." 
</P>
<P>
Street vending has been a problematic issue in Los Angeles for years. While an 
estimated 2,000 vendors, many of them Central Americans, ply their trade here, 
city laws prohibit the great majority of curbside sales. Past efforts at 
legalization have met some resistance from merchants, who say street vendors 
interfere with business. Others say a health hazard is posed by the open air 
sale of such food items as baked goods, fresh fruit and frozen desserts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public Health 
</P>
<P>
But Woo said there should be a way to regulate the industry to everyone's 
satisfaction. He said certain "street sale zones" could be established. 
Licensing could also be restricted to certain items that do not pose a threat 
to area businesses or the public health, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Capt. Gregory R. Berg, who joined Woo at the press 
conference, said police would welcome a change in the laws, because they have 
better things to do than arrest street vendors. 
</P>
<P>
"It's refreshing to see the city doing something about this problem," Berg 
said. "This is a good opportunity for us to make some sense of a persistent 
irritation." 
</P>
<P>
Under current city laws, flowers and hot dogs are among the only items that can 
be legally sold on the streets. Flower vending is allowed within the confines 
of the city's central business district and hot dog sales are permitted if 
local health codes are met. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Sappietro, an immigrant from Argentina who operates a downtown hot dog 
cart, said street vending offers newcomers one of their best opportunities for 
success. 
</P>
<P>
"This is better than any other job I've had," said Sappietro, who spent several 
months picking grapes. "Besides, people like the idea of walking down the 
street with a hot dog and a soda."

A LOST COMPANION; 
</P>
<P>
PARROT, ELDERLY WOMAN'S PET FOR 40 YEARS, APPARENTLY STOLEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
To Magda V. Wilson, it was like a serenade. As dusk advanced each evening at 
her Santa Monica apartment, her companion of nearly 40 years would squawk, "I 
want to go to bed. You want to go to bed?" 
</P>
<P>
But now the 80-year-old widow is without Baby, a yellow-naped Amazon parrot 
known to neighbors as a ham who loved singing to children. After years of 
roaming around the apartment complex greeting strangers and calling out, 
"How're you? What's your name?" the two-pound, foot-long bird was apparently 
stolen Saturday afternoon from a perch outside the apartment while Wilson went 
to work on a rosebush. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Was Beside Myself' 
</P>
<P>
When she returned moments later, Wilson saw a young man in a red jacket walking 
down the sidewalk. Then she realized that her bird, which had clipped wings and 
therefore could not fly, was gone. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran out looking for him and, of course, I didn't see him and I was beside 
myself," she said, fighting tears. "He was a magnificent bird. He was my 
companion." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, who manages the apartment complex, has been distraught since Baby's 
disappearance and has had difficulty eating and sleeping. "I don't know how a 
person could just pick up a bird," she said. "I have been so confused about the 
whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Well-Known in Area 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors near Wilson's San Vicente Boulevard home say the parrot and his owner 
were well-known throughout this quiet corner of Santa Monica. Strangers who 
have seen the pair on walks together have called Wilson to donate reward money 
after seeing posters advertising Baby's theft. 
</P>
<P>
A police report filed by Wilson valued the 43-year-old bird at $1,000, but a 
local pet store owner said older parrots typically sell for about $500. 
</P>
<P>
"He seemed to be sort of a part of her. . . . He gave her a focus," said Leila 
Mara, an interior designer and Wilson's tenant since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's friends said Baby was a performer who loved attention and could mimic 
more than 100 words and animal sounds, greeting strangers with "How are you 
doing? What's your name? Want to get on my hand?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Acquired in 1950 
</P>
<P>
The German native acquired Baby in 1950 when she ran a pet store with her 
second husband in downtown Los Angeles. She adopted the bird and kept him after 
her husband's death in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica police report that a young man was seen in a nearby park at the 
time with a bird under a red jacket. Bulletins have been sent to county 
agencies, and local pet stores have been alerted to watch for anyone trying to 
sell the bird. There is a reward offered, but Wilson would not specify the 
amount.

STICKERS SETTLE ANSEL ADAMS PHOTOS SUIT; 
</P>
<P>
JUDGE ORDERS CALENDARS LABELED AS NOT USING ORIGINAL PICTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge Friday ordered a Santa Barbara publishing company to paste 
stickers on more than 60,000 desk and wall calendars featuring photographs 
taken by the late Ansel Adams to warn customers that the pictures are made from 
reprints, not original Adams works. 
</P>
<P>
The order, issued by U.S. District Judge William D. Keller, represented a 
partial victory for Adams' estate and his long-time publisher, Boston-based 
Little, Brown and Co., in a lawsuit against Day Dream Publishing Inc., which 
produced a book of the reproduced Adams photographs earlier this year and is 
distributing the line of 1990 calendars. 
</P>
<P>
"There's something you can't do," Keller told Day Dream's lawyers in a ruling 
issued from the bench. "You can't pass off (reconstituted photos as original) 
and mislead, knowingly or unwittingly, the purchasing public." 
</P>
<P>
The book and the calendars bear the title, "The Mural Project." They include 
pictures made by re-photographing images printed by Adams for the U.S. Interior 
Department in 1941 and 1942. 
</P>
<P>
Distribution and promotion of the book was not affected by Friday's ruling 
because attorneys for Adams' estate and publishing company conceded that 
virtually all copies are already on store shelves or sold. The attorneys had 
argued for greater court sanctions, but Keller ruled that they had not proven 
that the typographical design of the calendars and the book was illegally 
similar to designs used for Adams' works by Little, Brown. 
</P>
<P>
In issuing the injunction, Keller also offered a novel, court-sanctioned 
definition of what can be called an Ansel Adams photograph. 
</P>
<P>
For a photograph to be advertised and promoted as Adams' own work, Keller said, 
the image would have to be representative of Adams' style of subject selection 
and picture composition -- characterized by waiting for just the right shadow 
and lighting conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The photograph would have to have been made with focus, shutter speed and 
depth-of-field characteristics identified with Adams. The negative would have 
to have been developed by Adams, and the print made from the original negative 
using printing techniques developed by Adams that rely on a unique reproduction 
of gray tones in black and white images. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strike a Balance 
</P>
<P>
Keller said he developed the definition in an attempt to strike a balance 
between the right to use artworks that are in the public domain -- as the 
entire Mural Project series is -- and an artist's right to safeguard the 
integrity of his work. 
</P>
<P>
In ordering the injunction, Keller concluded that Day Dream had engaged in 
promotion and advertising of its Ansel Adams product line that is "misleading, 
calculated (to), and will in all probability, create confusion in the general 
population." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust and Little, Brown filed 
the court action after Day Dream announced it would publish the Adams photos in 
the book. 
</P>
<P>
But Day Dream said only about half of the 1990 calendar line -- a total of 
122,000 copies -- had been shipped. Keller's order requires Day Dream to place 
disclaimer stickers declaring that the images they present were "printed from 
copies of Ansel Adams photographs" on all copies remaining in warehouses. The 
requirement includes an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 that are already boxed and 
await shipment to such retailers as Waldenbooks, B Dalton Bookseller and 
Doubleday Book Shops. 
</P>
<P>
A set of prints made by Adams of the 225 images in the Mural Project series is 
in the custody of the National Archives in Washington. Anyone can order prints 
for about $5 a photograph by writing to the federal facility. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Remain in Vault 
</P>
<P>
The original negatives for the series remain in Adams' vault in Carmel 
Highlands, Calif. The custody and status of the negatives has emerged as an 
emotionally charged side issue in the legal dispute but is not officially a 
part of the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Adams, who died in 1984, had been hired to produce a series of more than 200 
photographs of national park scenes for possible use as murals in Interior 
Department buildings. The mural prints were never executed.

KOREATOWN BLAST SUSPECT TELLS HOW HE WAS INJURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The man blamed in a Koreatown fireworks explosion that injured 10 policemen 
last week says he was poking at a skyrocket with a knife, "curious to see what 
they make it with," when he caused an earlier blast that tore off much of his 
right hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm into fireworks," Gary Weksler said Friday at a Westside motel where he has 
been staying since his release from Los Angeles County Jail. Weksler was 
released on his own recognizance Thursday pending a court appearance on charges 
of possession of a dangerous device. 
</P>
<P>
Weksler, 38, conceded that he had been storing illegal fireworks at his 
Koreatown apartment. "It wasn't an overabundance," he said, just "a little more 
than an average person would have . . . enough to put on a small show." 
</P>
<P>
He said he collected the fireworks because he enjoyed putting on private 
pyrotechnics displays for his friends, usually at local beaches. "It's a hobby 
of mine," he said. "I've been doing it for 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
Weksler refused to say where he was before dawn June 27 when an M-80 skyrocket 
exploded in his hand, ripping off two fingers, mangling two others and pocking 
his face and chest with burns from flaming explosive. 
</P>
<P>
Later that day, officers went to his apartment after hospital personnel who 
were suspicious of his injuries contacted authorities. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, bomb squad experts had discovered a "major fireworks 
cache" in his home before a blast tore through the apartment, causing minor to 
moderate injuries to 10 officers in and around the building. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Objects to Reports 
</P>
<P>
Weksler objected to newspaper accounts that mentioned his personality problems 
and psychiatric counseling as a youth. "I am not some crazy bomber that makes 
bombs," he said, stressing that his fireworks, which are illegal in Los 
Angeles, were the sort that are commercially available in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
Weksler said that despite his injuries and the injuries suffered by the police 
officers, he would like to continue to "fool around with fireworks."

EVANGELICALS AIM FOR YEAR 2000 AS TARGET DATE FOR SPREADING FAITH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Evangelicals, a growing force in Christianity, open a global conference next 
week to refine strategies for spreading the faith, some aiming for it to be 
offered to everyone by AD 2000. 
</P>
<P>
That widely asserted target sometimes is considered more as a stimulus than a 
potentially accomplishable task. But the fervor for working at it is mounting 
in many church quarters. 
</P>
<P>
"The Countdown Has Begun" goes the title on a book of interdenominational 
planning discussions held early this year in Singapore. But the mission's 
success was seen to require some course corrections. 
</P>
<P>
"We see afresh that cooperation and partnership are absolute necessities if the 
Great Commission is going to be fulfilled by the year 2000," the participants 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Up to now, they said, "pride, prejudice, competition and disobedience have 
hindered our generation from effectively working at the task of world 
evangelization." 
</P>
<P>
The "Great Commission" refers to biblical instructions attributed to Jesus to 
present his message to all peoples. Evangelicals have a special passion for 
proclaiming that message and eliciting belief in it. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing that task beyond any particular time frame is the objective of the 
International Congress on World Evangelization, which is meeting Tuesday 
through July 20 in Manila. 
</P>
<P>
Evangelist Billy Graham had been scheduled to give the opening address, but 
canceled the Manila appearance in favor of extending his "Mission '89" in 
London, his office said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 4,000 evangelical-minded Christians of both mainline, historic 
churches and smaller evangelically oriented groups in 190 countries are 
expected to make the Philippines gathering one of the largest of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
It has been dubbed "Lausanne II," a successor to a similar gathering in 
Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1974, which was convened by Graham's organization and 
spawned a continuing, interlinked movement. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Leighton Ford of Charlotte, N.C., chairman of the Lausanne committee 
that is sponsoring this year's congress, says the session will address new, 
crucial issues that are affecting evangelization. 
</P>
<P>
"Secularism is rampant and we're suffering from a lack of evangelical 
cohesion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Planners say participants are coming both from major Protestant and Orthodox 
churches in the World Council of Churches and also those outside it, plus some 
Roman Catholic evangelization specialists.

BAPTIST GROUP TO LAUNCH CABLE TV PROGRAM ON BLACK LIFE, ACHIEVEMENTS

<P>
The National Baptist Convention U.S.A. Inc. plans to launch a cable TV news 
magazine on black life and achievements, the denomination's president, the Rev. 
T. J. Jemison, announced. 
</P>
<P>
It will deal with "education, politics, civics -- not just religion -- all the 
problems of the world," said Jemison, who was in Nashville for the 
denomination's annual meeting and dedication of its new $10-million Baptist 
World Center. 
</P>
<P>
The denomination is the country's third largest Protestant body -- 7.5 million 
members by its count -- after the Southern Baptists and United Methodists. 
</P>
<P>
Jemison, a Baton Rouge, La., pastor, said the cable program, "The Black World 
Today," will emphasize "good news regarding the black community" instead of 
"reports of drugs, crime and violence on the nightly news." 
</P>
<P>
The program is to be carried on the new Vision Interfaith Satellite Network, an 
interdenominational cable network.

SIMI POLICE QUIT EXTRA POSTS IN LABOR DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty-seven Simi Valley police officers, including SWAT team members, have 
resigned from volunteer duty assignments during a labor dispute, but city 
officials said the action would not affect law enforcement in the Ventura 
County city of about 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Paul Miller called the resignations from the paid duties "symbolic 
at this point." He said that if there is an emergency, such as a gunman holding 
hostages, "the officers will respond when the chips are down." 
</P>
<P>
But Sgt. Gary Collins, a spokesman for the department's 85 officers, sergeants 
and detectives, said the action will force Miller to call in deputies from the 
Ventura County Sheriff's Department in some instances, including serving 
warrants on suspects considered dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said he will ask his officers to work before contacting the Sheriff's 
Department under a mutual aid agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The union denied it is behind the resignations. Union attorney Stephen H. 
Silver called the resignations a spontaneous protest. But he said the union 
will continue to apply pressure on city officials until they accept its 
demands. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said he will order six officers who resigned their volunteer positions 
as firearms specialists to resume their duties supervising the department's 
weekly shooting practice. The department's next practice is set for today. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to go without our regularly scheduled pistol practice," 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the firearms specialists, known as range masters, the 
resignations leave the department without its 14-member Special Weapons Team, 
which serves certain arrest and search warrants and deals with criminals 
holding hostages. The five-member Crisis Negotiating Team also resigned, as did 
two officers who train 13-to-18-year-old volunteers in the Explorer program. 
</P>
<P>
Officers have been working without a contract since last Saturday. An impasse 
was reached last week in contract negotiations between the city and the Simi 
Valley Police Officers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The officers have demanded a 9% salary increase over two years and a workweek 
of four 10-hour days. They want their pay to be adjusted in the 21st month of 
the contract to equal the average police salary in 12 specified Southern 
California cities, including Oxnard, Ventura, Pasadena, Torrance, Santa Monica 
and Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
The city has offered a salary increase of up to 24% over a four-year period, 
and wants to pay no more than 50% of the difference between Simi Valley police 
wages and the average wage in the 12 cities. 
</P>
<P>
Silver said the officers resigned from the volunteer details because the city 
refused to bring their salaries up to the 12-city average and refused to allow 
them to work a shorter week. They want a four-day week, Silver said, because 
"they're working 10-hour days anyway, and it's taking a toll." 
</P>
<P>
Silver said the union has offered to hire an expert to assess the feasibility 
of the four-day week and would accept a pay cut if the program ends up costing 
the department money. It also has offered to let the department implement the 
new schedule on a trial basis for one year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Laura Wylie, city personnel administrator, said the four-day work week would 
cause scheduling problems regardless of what it cost. She said the city is 
concerned that officers still would end up working overtime, stretching their 
work day to 12 to 14 hours. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more than a dollar issue, it's a philosophical one," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Wylie said she doubts that the officers' resignations will affect police 
services because "we think they will respond to situations involving public 
safety or hazards." 
</P>
<P>
Officers currently earn between $2,206 and $2,884 per month, about 8% lower 
than the average salary in the 12 other cities, Wylie said. 
</P>
<P>
In February, the City Council raised Chief Miller's salary to the average level 
earned by chiefs in the 12 cities. Miller now makes $6,139 per month, which 
could rise to a maximum of $6,927. Previously, the maximum he could earn was 
$5,684. 
</P>
<P>
No mediator has been called in. The union said it is willing to accept binding 
arbitration.

TUDOR LASTS FOR 10 PITCHES; DODGERS LOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

CHICAGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the last four days, using grimaces and gestures because he could not bear 
to use the words, John Tudor had been trying to tell the Dodgers something. 
</P>
<P>
Friday afternoon, in 10 pitches that wore on him like 10 years, he finally made 
his message clear: Tudor, 35, is physically unable to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodger left-hander is not ready to return from extensive winter shoulder 
and elbow surgery that has left his shoulder in unplayable condition. 
</P>
<P>
In the Dodgers' 6-4 loss to the Chicago Cubs Friday before a crowd of 35,434 at 
Wrigley Field, Tudor lasted through only seven Cub batters. With every 
delivery, he would later say, there was pain. He wasn't throwing fastballs or 
curveballs, but softballs. 
</P>
<P>
After Tudor made it through the first inning on five pitches, Lloyd McClendon 
hit his second pitch of the second inning over the left-field wall for a home 
run. Two pitches later, Damon Berryhill singled up the middle. Then Vance Law 
doubled, and Tudor was finished. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger pitching coach Ron Perranoski went to the mound. Tudor stared at the 
sky. Reliever Tim Belcher had already warmed up in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
Perranoski grabbed the ball, patted Tudor's back, and the pitcher walked off, 
accompanied by one last shot -- a couple of hundred fans chanting, "Leave him 
in, leave him in." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going back out there again with my shoulder like this, I know that," 
Tudor said. "I can't throw the ball. I can't throw the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what the Dodgers are thinking, but they are thinking of putting 
me back out there -- that's ridiculous. I've had shoulder problems all my 
career, but this is a lot worse, a lot different. Here, I'm messing with 
people's lives." 
</P>
<P>
Tudor's early exit threw the bullpen into more chaos and helped the Dodgers 
incur their fifth straight loss, a season low, and 10th defeat in their last 12 
games. The Cubs had taken a 3-1 lead against Tudor, but the Dodgers tied the 
score on Chris Gwynn's two-run pinch single in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Cubs won it with three runs in the final five innings off weary 
relievers John Wetteland (Jerome Walton's RBI fly and single) and Ricky Horton 
(Berryhill's RBI single). 
</P>
<P>
"We're all concerned," said Fred Claire, Dodger vice president. "This is a team 
and a town that we swept through last year. But that was last year. We have to 
face reality." 
</P>
<P>
Claire was equally concerned about Tudor: "He's obviously troubled and has not 
been able to do the job," he said. "We need to do something." 
</P>
<P>
Look for them to place him on the 21-day disabled list, along with Alejandro 
Pena, who suffered a strained groin muscle in the bullpen Friday. This probably 
will mean the post-All-Star-break return of left-handed reliever Ray Searage 
from his minor league rehabilitation assignment at triple-A Albuquerque, and 
right-handed starter Ramon Martinez from the Albuquerque roster. 
</P>
<P>
What were the Dodgers thinking in sending Tudor to the mound? It wasn't as 
though his sore shoulder was a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"Even before I went out there, they knew what it was going to be like, and I 
knew what it was going to be like," Tudor said later. "They didn't put a gun to 
my head, it was my decision to pitch. But (Manager) Tom Lasorda knew just what 
I had -- nothing. We all knew what would happen." 
</P>
<P>
And with good reason. This was his third start since beginning his comeback 
June 27, but he lasted only 4 1/3 innings in his first start, and three innings 
in his second. And since that start, last Sunday against Pittsburgh, he has 
complained daily of shoulder tenderness. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them after that last game there were no guarantees the shoulder 
wouldn't give me problems again," Tudor said. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me to go out there and try it, that I would never know unless I 
tried it. And I've never not taken the ball when asked." 
</P>
<P>
Said Claire of what happened after last Sunday's game, in which Tudor threw 
three shutout innings against the Pirates before exiting: "We met with Dr. 
(Frank) Jobe, and he said the shoulder wasn't anything serious. We asked John 
if he felt he could make another start, and he said yes. We didn't force 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night in St. Louis, when it became obvious Tudor was going to remain 
as Friday's starter, he was asked about his doubts. 
</P>
<P>
"Ask the bullpen if they have any reservations," he said. "I'm told to pitch, I 
pitch. The know how it feels. It felt the same way today as it did yesterday as 
it did the day before." 
</P>
<P>
Friday, the Dodgers ordered Belcher to prepare as if he would be the starter. 
And in the bullpen, it took Tudor an incredible 149 pitches to warm up. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a record," said bullpen coach Mark Cresse, whose pitchers normally 
require 70 to 90 pitches. "And no, John didn't have very good stuff. But that's 
the problem. He doesn't have a whole lot of stuff even when he has a whole lot 
of stuff. He gets people out in other ways. So, it's hard for us to tell when 
he's not right." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Dodger management left the decision up to Tudor. 
</P>
<P>
"It was completely up to John -- we would never ask anyone to go out and do 
something that he wouldn't be comfortable in doing," Claire said. "We told him 
we didn't care when he came back, as long as he was healthy." 
</P>
<P>
Added Tudor: "No, they didn't force anything. But I'm always going to want to 
pitch." 
</P>
<P>
Until now. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Mike Davis' arthroscopic exam revealed loose cartilage in both knees. The 
cartilage was removed by Dr. Frank Jobe and Davis, who went on the 15-day 
disabled list Thursday, is expected to be sidelined for a month. . . . Jose 
Gonzalez, who entered Friday in an 0-for-14 slump, moved back into good graces 
against the Cubs with a single, a double and his second great assist this week 
from center field, throwing out Lloyd McClendon attempting to score from third 
base on a fly ball in the seventh. Gonzalez is hitting .317. . . . Tim Leary 
offered no excuses for his season-worst start, Thursday in a 14-2 loss to St. 
Louis. He gave up five runs in four innings. Friday morning he rushed to Los 
Angeles to be with his wife, Catherine, who had gone into labor with their 
second child. . . . Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda jogged and walked 6 1/2 miles 
from the team's downtown hotel to Wrigley Field for Friday's game. It took him 
one hour 15 minutes.

ORIOLES PONDER A TRADE;

<P>
TEAM IS HESITANT TO MAKE A CHANGE IN WINNING LINEUP

They have come this far, so the question is, how far can they go? They are 
taking it one day at a time, the Baltimore Orioles say, but their season is 
more than half over. It's time for the club's front office to confront its next 
critical set of decisions. 
</P>
<P>
As one coach put it, "When do we declare war?" Not on the field, where the 
Orioles already boast a 5 1/2-game lead in the American League East, but off 
the field, where pennants often are decided through a trade. 
</P>
<P>
Because the youthful Orioles resemble no other contender in recent major league 
history, their approach to the stretch drive might not follow the classic 
pattern. General Manager Roland Hemond, in fact, has indicated he isn't seeking 
a move to put the Orioles "over the top." 
</P>
<P>
At this point, no one in the organization is anxious to disrupt the club's 
seemingly flawless chemistry, a rarity in this era of big contracts and bigger 
egos. But much can change in the hot summer months, and Hemond knows one trade 
could mean the difference. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles considered themselves a rebuilding club when the season began, but 
inevitably, their focus must shift. Every team, realistic or not, dreams of 
winning its division. The opportunity doesn't come often, and it can't be taken 
lightly, opposing general managers say. 
</P>
<P>
"You go for broke," Boston General Manager Lou Gorman said. "The Red Sox have 
won only one world championship in 80 years. How often do you get close? What 
guarantee is there that you'll be there next year? You've got to take the 
chance." 
</P>
<P>
Said Milwaukee General Manager Harry Dalton, "If it looks like they can win the 
thing with one more addition, I think they'd be very active (in the trade 
market). When you smell it, when you feel like you're awfully close, it's tough 
not to do whatever you can to get it." 
</P>
<P>
Hemond dismisses such talk as premature, but in subtle ways he's already 
operating with the mindset of a contender. Last September, the Orioles tried 
not to tinker with their triple-A roster, forfeiting talent to keep Rochester 
in a pennant race. This year, they've manipulated Rochester without regret. 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Jose Bautista was demoted one day after beating the defending American 
League champion Oakland A's, simply because Manager Frank Robinson needed a 
fresh arm. Pitcher Pete Harnisch was summoned as insurance if Jay Tibbs went on 
the disabled list, which eventually happened. 
</P>
<P>
Those moves were telling, but they hardly rated as acts of war. Hemond still is 
conducting a police action. Maybe he'll get away with it, maybe he won't. "The 
best thing is not to make any dramatic moves at this time," he said. "The 
players we've given opportunities have given us production." 
</P>
<P>
But will it last? Since the Red Sox collapsed in 1978, no American League East 
team has taken a lead of 3 1/2 games or more into July and failed to win the 
division title. History, however, is not an accurate measure for this team. The 
Orioles' season is too improbable, too magical, too unreal. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of weird," pitcher Dave Schmidt said. "At the start of the year, we 
were rebuilding. We were going to play the young guys no matter what, to get 
them experience. Now that we're in a race, we'll see if that tune doesn't 
change a little. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a team that could not only contend now, but down the road. It's my 
opinion you don't tinker with it at all. I don't see changing philosophies this 
quickly just because we're in a pennant race. The original plan has gotten us 
to this point. 
</P>
<P>
"The greatest thing that could happen would be to win with a rebuilding team 
that is supposed to contend in two or three years. . .and still looking two or 
three years down the road, seeing where we are then." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't look at it and say, 'We can win with this group,' " Robinson said. "I 
look at it and say, 'This group has done fine so far. They're maintaining it.' 
We'll go as far as we can without tearing this system apart. 
</P>
<P>
"If we find someone who can make us a better ballclub, then we wouldn't 
hesitate to do it. We're not getting lulled into a false sense of security. But 
we're not seeking a trade just for the sake of a trade."

The Vancouver Canadians, the triple-A team of the Chicago White Sox, ended a 
one-game players' strike after the general manager delivered overdue paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
Brent Imlach, in his first year as vice president and general manager of the 
Pacific Coast League team, met with the players and handed over the checks that 
were due June 30. 
</P>
<P>
The players, who said Thursday that the White Sox have been consistently late 
in meeting the twice-a-month payroll, agreed to play the windup of a four-game 
series with the Albuquerque Dukes. Vancouver won, 7-3.

The National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Division I Basketball Committee 
recommended awarding the men's Final Four to four cities in the years 1994 
through 1997. 
</P>
<P>
The 1994 Final Four would go to Charlotte, N.C., followed by Seattle, the 
Meadowlands in New Jersey and Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendations must be approved by the NCAA Division I championship 
committee and the NCAA executive committee, which meet Aug. 14-15. 
</P>
<P>
Cedric Dempsey, chairman of the basketball committee, said the unprecedented 
step of selecting four cities at once was taken because of the cost involved in 
making presentations.

Next Feb. 4, the day Santa Anita runs the Charles H. Strub Stakes, will be when 
Bill Shoemaker makes his last ride. 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker, 58 next month, has been riding since 1949, and by bowing out next 
year he will be able to do what no other jockey has done -- ride in six 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker, who has ridden more than 8,800 winners, announced his impending 
retirement earlier this year and is on a farewell tour that has taken him to 
many of the tracks in Europe. Today, he is scheduled to ride at Phoenix Park in 
Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
On July 21, Hollywood Park will run a special evening program in its farewell 
salute to Shoemaker, who is returning from Europe earlier that week. 
</P>
<P>
Shoemaker has won the Strub and its forerunner, the Santa Anita Maturity, seven 
times, his last win in the stake coming aboard Spectacular Bid in 1980. BILL

BUSH CHOOSES OUTSIDER TO LEAD ENDOWMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John E. Frohnmayer, an Oregon business and media lawyer and moderate 
Republican, is President Bush's choice to take over as chairman of the 
politically besieged National Endowment for the Arts, the White House said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Disclosure of the intention to nominate Frohnmayer came after weeks of 
speculation about the identity of the new chairman. The endowment has been 
without a permanent head since the resignation of Frank Hodsell in February. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in another development Friday, endowment staff members sent to a 
conservative congressman draft language of changes in endowment 
grant-evaluation rules intended to avert what many Washington observers believe 
is the most serious threat to the endowment's independence since it was founded 
nearly 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But the congressman, Rep. Dick Armey (R-Tex.), summarily rejected the change in 
wording, which would re-emphasize the need for panels and individuals 
evaluating endowment grant applications to fund arts projects based on 
standards of creative excellence. Armey said he would attempt to strip at least 
$6 million from the endowment's budget when the appropriation comes up for a 
vote before the House Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Armey's vow is the latest development in a simmering controversy over endowment 
funding of a traveling art show last year that included a photograph of a 
crucifix immersed in urine and the endowment's support of the late photographer 
Robert Mapplethorpe, whose work included homoerotic themes. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview Friday, Armey reiterated a threat to take a selection 
of photographs by Mapplethorpe and the crucifix image, by New York photographer 
Andres Serrano, onto the House floor on Wednesday to dramatize his case against 
the endowment's support of controversial art. 
</P>
<P>
The Frohnmayer selection appeared to surprise some members of the East Coast 
arts community because Frohnmayer is not identified with what some sources in 
Congress and the national endowment characterized as the "New York arts mafia." 
</P>
<P>
But Chase Untermeyer, the White House director of personnel, said in a 
telephone interview that when the search began for a new head for the arts 
endowment, Bush expressed a specific preference for someone "from outside the 
Boston-Washington arts corridor who might provide a healthy outlook that the 
job needs." 
</P>
<P>
Although only two people from outside the Boston-Washington-New York area were 
among the six finalists for the job, Untermeyer said Bush's selection was 
consistent with the president's original preference "for having somebody who 
was deeply involved (in the arts) but from a community, small state basis." 
</P>
<P>
Untermeyer said the formal nomination of Frohnmayer, 47, would have to await 
completion of an FBI background check and evaluation of Frohnmayer's financial 
disclosure statements. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview from his office in Portland, Frohnmayer declined to be 
drawn into the political tempest enveloping the endowment. He said it would be 
inappropriate to become involved in the controversy publicly before his 
confirmation hearings. The national endowment chairmanship requires Senate 
confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that this is a serious issue that is being taken 
seriously by all sides," he said of the threat by conservative congressmen and 
senators, including Sens. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and Alfonse D'Amato (R-N.Y.), to 
strike at the endowment's budget in an attempt to pressure the endowment into 
regulation of subject matter content of art. 
</P>
<P>
But in past congressional testimony, Frohnmayer has emerged as an emphatic 
advocate of federal support for the arts. Testifying in opposition to deep cuts 
in the national endowment's budget proposed by the Reagan Administration in 
1981, Frohnmayer called such a plan "disastrous." 
</P>
<P>
"There is a definite domino effect from the loss of federal dollars," he said 
eight years ago. "When the NEA gives a grant to an organization or project, 
that serves as a Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval. It is definitely easier to 
attract corporate or private funds when the national endowment has evaluated 
and approved a project. Such private support would simply (not be there) 
without the catalytic effect of national endowment dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer, who is himself a talented amateur singer, has two sons who are 
professional musicians. He was director of the International Sculpture 
Symposium in Eugene, Ore., in 1974 and chaired a committee that selected 
artworks for the Oregon Capitol in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
He headed the Oregon Arts Commission from 1980 to 1984 and was a member of the 
commission for eight years. His law practice focuses on business law, including 
contract, real property and other commercial disputes. He has practiced First 
Amendment, libel and media law in Oregon and represents a Portland television 
station and several small newspapers in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer's wife, Leah, is a member of the Portland school board. The couple 
has two sons, Jason, 19, a student at Northern Arizona University, and Aaron, 
17, a Portland high school student. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, sources within the national endowment said the Frohnmayer 
nomination was greeted enthusiastically in the organization. Frohnmayer's lack 
of identity with established political factions in the East Coast arts 
community was widely perceived as a significant advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Anne Murphy, executive director of the Washington-based American Arts Alliance, 
called the Frohnmayer nomination "a breath of fresh air." 
</P>
<P>
She said Frohnmayer "comes to the job with a knowledge of the arts, a belief in 
the arts and a caring for the arts and yet he hasn't been so involved (in the 
East Coast arts establishment) that he comes with any preconceived, preset 
values." 
</P>
<P>
John Walsh, director of the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu and president of the 
Art Museum Directors Assn., said of Frohnmayer: "I don't know him yet, but 
everything we've heard about him so far is good. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very encouraged. It's a tough moment for the NEA. It's time for a strong 
appointment."

CRITIC AT LARGE: STEGNER SHARES HIS 'SENSE OF PLACE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, Times Arts Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I began college, one of the men teaching freshman English was Wallace 
Stegner, a sturdy and open Westerner who even to a naive newcomer seemed a man 
set apart from the pinched pedagogical caution of my Eastern academic 
establishment. I was dismayed when I was assigned to another man's section and 
I've regretted it since. 
</P>
<P>
Stegner had that year published a novel, "The Big Rock Candy Mountain," 
obviously autobiographical in origin, about a family moving around in a West 
where the spaces then as now were vacant and demanding. 
</P>
<P>
Published novelists were figures of awe to me, even outranking film stars, and 
I watched Stegner striding among the immemorial elms in the Harvard Yard like a 
man wishing for wider skies. I didn't meet him until, several decades later, he 
received The Times' Robert Kirsch Award for a body of work written in or about 
the West. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Stegner did not much like Cambridge and says he would be hard 
put to summon up any significant memories of his six years there. He left in 
1945 to return to the West, as head of the creative writing program at 
Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
The revelation about his unhappiness as a temporary Easterner is in a new 
introductory essay, one of nine pieces about the West Stegner reads in "A Sense 
of Place," a two-cassette recording from The Audio Press (Box 935, Louisville, 
Colo. 80027; (303) 665-3201). 
</P>
<P>
The album is, not least, further evidence of the almost unbelievably wide and 
nourishing variety of cassettes you can now acquire to defeat the inefficiency 
of slow or paralyzed traffic. 
</P>
<P>
It is also a reminder that the production costs of audio cassettes are modest 
enough that albums can be created as labors of a particular passion for a 
specialized audience rather than as candidates for the mass market. The Audio 
Press is, I take it, M. De Witt Daggett III, who celebrates the spoken West 
from his Colorado base. 
</P>
<P>
In his uninflected but warm, quiet, deep-toned voice, Stegner remembers an 
itinerant Western boyhood. Born in Iowa in 1909, he has, he says, lived since 
in eight states and Canada, in 20 places. During the early years, there may 
have been anywhere from two to 10 dwellings in each of those places. 
</P>
<P>
Friendships had to be left behind, with other things there wasn't room to take, 
and he sometimes regrets the lack of the fixed and rooted past others have 
enjoyed. Yet he gives an eloquent evocation of Salt Lake City where, a Gentile 
in Mormon country, he paused longest and attended college. 
</P>
<P>
At Stanford before he retired, Stegner inspired a long generation of young 
writers, while continuing to produce his own remarkable novels and nonfiction 
works. Notable among the latter is "Beyond the Hundredth Meridian," his account 
of the opening of the West and in particular the daring explorations and the 
prophetic warnings of John Wesley Powell about overcultivating a dry land. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the most moving of the essays, "How the West Was Lost," Stegner 
carries forward Powell's warnings about tampering with a fragile ecology, 
plowing and planting a land where aridity not moisture was the way of life. The 
consequences are everywhere, in the draining of the water table, the dust 
storms then and now, the chemical polluting of such water as there is. Stegner 
is an outspoken environmentalist, the poetic power of his prose born of an 
early found love of the austere beauty of the Western landscapes. His account 
of life amid the vastness of the Saskatchewan prairies captures the humbling 
majesty of the silent distances (full of sounds, if you listen as Stegner did). 
The emptiness is intimidating but also enviable, in a time when almost no vista 
seems beyond reach of the crimping 'dozers. 
</P>
<P>
The readings draw you to the books, "Wolf Willow," "The Sound of Mountain 
Water" and "American Places," from which six of the essays are taken. Those who 
love the West are likely to find even more reasons than they knew they had. 
</P>
<P>
The same profound love of nature's handiwork, and the same alarmed contempt for 
man's, informs John Hersey's "Blues," his celebration of fishing for bluefish 
off Nantucket Island. The author of "Hiroshima" and "A Bell for Adano" has been 
seeking blues for 20 years. The book has become another imaginative and welcome 
audio eccentricity. 
</P>
<P>
Published in 1987, the book is unabridged on four cassettes from Recorded 
Books, Inc. (Box 409, Charlotte Hall, Md. 10622; (800) 638-1304). Read by 
Norman Dietz in an appropriately cracky Eastern if not New England voice, 
Hersey's text is in the form of a dialogue with a fictional inquirer about 
blues, a man he calls only The Stranger. 
</P>
<P>
The format lets Hersey offer a treasury of ichthyological facts (how do the 
scientists know these things?), several mouthwatering recipes, poems in praise 
of blues and other fish, and his own poetic summoning of the magic of tides, 
light, weather and the respectful communion of man and sea. 
</P>
<P>
Like Stegner, Hersey is appalled by man's greedy, witless poisoning of a 
God-given bounty: the indiscriminate dumping of wastes, the overfishing that 
has endangered the striped bass and many other species, the oil spills and the 
overboating. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not a fisherman, but Hersey's book is engrossing and quite moving because, 
like Stegner's, it is first and last about love.

THE THEATER FUND-RAISER THAT DISAPPEARED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Mark Pinsky's article "O.C. 'Sorcery' Fund-Raiser Goes Poof" 
(Calendar, June 15): 
</P>
<P>
I read this article with great interest, as I was one of the many psychics 
invited to volunteer my time to provide entertainment at this fund-raiser for 
the Laguna Playhouse. It was very unfortunate that the fund-raiser was canceled 
as a result of the Rev. Jerry Tankersley's letter to his congregation at the 
Laguna Presbyterian Church. It is difficult to imagine that anyone living in 
the 20th Century would refer to contemporary psychics as "those who are 
representatives and voices of spiritual powers that at times have proven to be 
destructive of human life." Tankersley and his supporters obviously have no 
idea regarding what type of services professional psychics actually provide. 
</P>
<P>
The psychic work I engage in has nothing whatsoever to do with activities 
"destructive to human life." It involves providing consulting services to the 
public in a positive and constructive manner. I frequently volunteer my 
services to organizations such as the Laguna playhouse that are engaged in fund 
raising. I know this to be true of many psychics. 
</P>
<P>
Although it would have been only beneficial for psychics to provide their 
services for the Laguna Playhouse fund-raiser, I can assure you that we do and 
will have plenty of other platform opportunities in Orange County and 
elsewhere. Tankersley and his supporters may have succeeded in canceling the 
Laguna Playhouse fund-raiser, but they won't stop professional psychics from 
providing their services to members of the public who request them. 
</P>
<P>
Tankersley and his supporters might be surprised to know that I, a practicing 
psychic, also believe in God, and I am not familiar with any psychic who does 
not. I would invite Tankersley and his supporters to read First Corinthians, 
12:4-6: "There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit. There are 
different kinds of service, but the same Lord. There are different kinds of 
working, but the same God works all of them in all men." 
</P>
<P>
In closing, I can't help but think of one of my favorite passages from the 
Bible: "Judge not, that you be not judged. For with what judgment you judge, 
you will be judged; and with the same measure you use, it will be measured back 
to you."

Although the vacancy rate throughout Orange County has been headed downward 
since 1987, just seven individual cities have followed the same pattern. Six 
have had steadily increasing rates and in 13 others the rate has moved up and

house, apartment or mobile home is considered vacant if it has

4 TEACHERS SELECTED FOR MADRID CONFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four county teachers are among 52 from California chosen by the state 
Department of Education to attend a monthlong literature conference in Madrid. 
</P>
<P>
The four are Maria Palacios and Lupe Alfaro, both of the Santa Ana Unified 
School District; Martha Martini of the Centralia City School District, and 
Virginia Brady of the Orange Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Education is awarding $500 scholarships to some of the 
teachers, who will have to spend about $1,000 of their own money for the 
balance of the traveling expenses, according to the department. 
</P>
<P>
Those wishing to attend the conference have to be bilingual in English and 
Spanish and have previously participated in bilingual training programs. 
</P>
<P>
The conference -- the Second Annual Summer Institute on Children's Literature 
-- will be conducted this month. The purpose is to promote the idea that 
"literature develops ethical, cultural and aesthetic values while enabling 
students to build a reservoir of knowledge of themselves and the world around 
them," according to a department news release.

STATE TO HUNT FOR SOURCE OF ALGAE IN NEWPORT BAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State and county officials will survey areas fronting a creek leading to 
Newport Bay this summer to track down the sources of nutrients that are choking 
the waters with algae. 
</P>
<P>
Joanne Schneider, the environmental program manager for the California Regional 
Water Quality Control Board, said at a press conference Friday that officials 
will try to determine where nutrients, such as those found in fertilizers, are 
flowing into San Diego Creek. In the past few years, they have identified some 
nurseries and agricultural areas along the creek but have concluded that they 
are only part of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"The next step is: What are those other sources?" Schneider said. "It's kind of 
like a piece of detective work." 
</P>
<P>
They speculate that such runoff also might come from parks, lawns and 
construction projects. Another source might be nutrient-laden ground water, 
which can rise to the surface near the creek. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Report Due in September 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the state Legislature, acting on legislation introduced by state Sen. 
Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), called for the water board to survey water 
quality in Newport Bay. A report is due Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson and other residents had been concerned that work on the report had not 
been moving fast enough. After the press conference, Bergeson said: "I think 
it's evident the survey is going forward. I feel very positive." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Bergeson added: "I've been disappointed that (the survey) hasn't been 
moving at a more rapid rate, but I understand it's very complex. I just don't 
want to lose momentum." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Creek flows into Upper Newport Bay, where the algae buildup is 
thought to be the worst. Bergeson and other residents who live near the upper 
bay have been alarmed by recent algae growth. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been more algae built up in the last few months than I have ever 
seen," Bergeson said. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Hamilton, owner of the Cannery Restaurant on the Rhine channel near Lower 
Newport Bay, said that he continues to observe the ugly buildup. 
</P>
<P>
"There are places in Newport Harbor where it looks like indoor/outdoor 
carpeting," he said. "It looks terrible." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its slimy appearance, algae can kill fish and other marine life 
by soaking up the oxygen in water. High amounts of nutrients -- especially 
nitrates, phosphates and trace metals -- can produce algae in massive 
proportions. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Fish and Game has said that it appears existing levels 
of nutrients have yet to excessively deplete the oxygen supply to marine life 
in Upper Newport Bay. But it is not known how much the area can take before the 
situation becomes excessive. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Environmental Management Agency did a study of the area that 
showed a decline over time in the amount of the organic nitrogen nutrients in 
the bay. They have not determined whether this means the problem is getting 
better or worse. 
</P>
<P>
But Bob Collacott, manager of the environmental resources division at the 
agency, said that the amount of nutrients flowing into Newport Bay is still 
much greater than any other place in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"You will not see this anywhere else," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In its statement, the water board advised that no action be taken until the 
state and county organizations have completed their study. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, I don't think any legislation is needed," Schneider said. "It's 
just a question of having to know what to control and if we can control it." 
</P>
<P>
But steps have been taken at some nurseries to stem the runoff of water and 
fertilizers into San Diego Creek. 
</P>
<P>
Hines Wholesale Nurseries in Irvine has installed 117 acres of drip irrigation, 
which helps prevent the overflow of excess water from plants. By September, it 
plans to start a recycling system in which runoff will be collected, the 
nutrients removed and the water reused. The system is expected to cost more 
than $1 million, said Bud Summers, the nursery's technical resource manager. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, the water board also has had erosion-control measures for 
agricultural areas along the creek. Deposits of silt caused by erosion have 
been found to carry nutrients that flow into the bay.

JUNIOR COLLEGE PROJECTS, HUNTINGTON BEACH PIER WORK CUT FROM BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

SACRAMENTO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian's blue pencil knicked Orange County on Friday as he 
vetoed more than $4 million earmarked for community college projects and the 
restoration of the Huntington Beach Pier before signing the state's 
$49.3-billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the cuts, the governor left intact millions more set aside for major 
renovation and construction at UC Irvine and Cal State Fullerton, as well as 
acquisition of Chino Hills State Park. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Deukmejian also used his line-item powers to restore a formula 
first written into law by state Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) to help equalize 
funding levels for Orange County and others that have been traditionally 
under-funded in mental health programs. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour, who holds a key position on the Legislature's budget conference 
committee, said Friday that he has mixed feelings about what the new budget 
holds for Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was disappointed that Deukmejian had deleted $1.5 million set aside 
for the restoration of the Huntington Beach Pier, a project that is estimated 
to cost about $11 million overall. 
</P>
<P>
He also lamented the fact that Deukmejian also cut large appropriations, 
requested by the Legislature, that would have meant added brick and mortar for 
local community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Gone is $2.4 million earmarked for new cafeterias at Saddleback and Irvine 
Valley colleges. Also deleted was $266,000 worth of new maintenance buildings 
or warehouses for Cypress, Orange Coast and Fullerton colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian also took about $100 million raised by Proposition 99 -- the 
increase in the state's tobacco tax -- out of the budget for trauma care, an 
undetermined portion of which would have gone for the operation of the trauma 
unit at UCI Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County and four other counties were dropped from a proposed perinatal 
substance-abuse pilot project planned for nine counties. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the governor left intact millions of dollars in new construction 
projects at UCI and Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Almost $27 million has been earmarked for the UCI campus for the renovation of 
the physical sciences building, to pay for working drawings for a new science 
library, to help expand the campus road system and to begin planning for a 
center to house engineering programs and the central computing facility. 
</P>
<P>
Another $22.4 million was set aside for a long-awaited 100,000-square-foot 
addition to Cal State Fullerton's McCarthy Hall. The addition will allow 
overcrowded labs to move out of the poorly ventilated building, the first 
permanent structure opened on the Fullerton campus in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
The new building, which will be connected by a second story foot-bridge to 
McCarthy Hall, will dramatically improve science programs, according to Jim 
Diefenderfer, dean of the School of Mathematics and Natural Sciences. "We've 
worked to get funding for the science addition for six years. . . . This new 
building will allow us to provide the very best undergraduate science education 
in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Also approved in the budget was $636,290 for conversion of unused classroom 
buildings at Saddleback Community College into a satellite campus for Cal State 
Fullerton. Saddleback Community College District Chancellor Richard Sneed 
praised the satellite funding as "historic." Classes will begin in the 
converted buildings Aug. 28. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the culmination of three years of work to bring graduate and 
upper-division programs to south Orange County," he said. "The beginnings will 
be small, but the demand is great, and our next step will be to work toward 
permanent facilities in conjunction with the university." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County, which still faces a budget deficit of at least $24 million for 
the current fiscal year, is hoping to receive about $20 million from the state 
to erase the shortfall. But that grant is still unresolved in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant County Administrative Officer John Sibley said Friday that he expects 
to hear about the state grant next week. Without it, county officials have 
warned that they might have to severely cut county services and lay off 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the governor's $489 million in budget cuts came when Deukmejian slashed 
$50 million out of the $75 million that the Legislature wanted to distribute in 
extra money for mental health funding this year. That left $25 million in 
excess aid, the same amount the governor proposed in January. 
</P>
<P>
With that cut, Orange County stands to gain between about $2 million extra this 
year to bolster its overburdened programs to care for the mentally ill. But 
that amount is about half of what the Legislature had in mind for the county. 
</P>
<P>
But while he cut the number of dollars flowing to Orange County, he also took 
steps to make sure that it and other under-funded areas in the state made some 
long-term gains to catch up in mental health funding with such areas as Los 
Angeles, Marin, San Francisco and Napa counties. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian restored a formula, written into state law three years ago, that 
directs that at least 50% of all increases in the mental health budget for 
unrestricted programs be given to Orange and other under-funded counties. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour said the mental health cuts were "bad news," but restoring the special 
funding formula makes sure that "whatever Orange County receives, it is 
receiving its fair share." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Boyd, the county's administrator for mental health programs, said her 
department has tentatively calculated its share of the extra money at about 
$1.4 million, a number that is slightly below what is suggested by a 
legislative analysis showing $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
If the $1.4-million figure holds true, she said, the extra money wouldn't even 
be enough to allow the mental health programs to keep up with increases in 
labor and contract costs. "It doesn't even allow us to stay even," she said.

TWO SISTERS CONVICTED OF RUNNING MASSIVE 2-COUNTY COCAINE NETWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two sisters who operated a massive cocaine distribution network in Orange 
County and Los Angeles were convicted of drug trafficking Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Flor Mary Restrepo, 30, and Luz Restrepo, 33, who were described as leaders of 
the network, were convicted of conspiracy and possession with the intent to 
distribute narcotics. One shipment was found in Westminster on the 15900 block 
of Prince Circle, where 220 pounds was seized. 
</P>
<P>
The sisters face prison terms of up to 10 years and fines of up to $4 million. 
There is no possibility of parole, said Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Susan 
Bryant-Deason, who prosecuted the case in a 2 1/2-week trial before Chief U.S. 
District Judge Manuel Real. 
</P>
<P>
Flor Restrepo was also found guilty of using a minor, her sister, Vivian, who 
was 16 at the time, in the narcotics network. 
</P>
<P>
The network received shipments of cocaine hidden in red, white, blue, and green 
packages smuggled across the Mexican border, which were believed to have 
originated with a cartel operating from Cali, Colombia, Bryant-Deason said. 
</P>
<P>
The sisters and their associates were known as "corporate-level," or the top 
distributors who then passed the drug to middlemen and street dealers, 
Bryant-Deason said. The network was a key force in the flow of cocaine 
throughout Southern California, she added. 
</P>
<P>
The convictions are a major victory for the law-enforcement agencies, 
Bryant-Deason said, because traffickers at that level of the drug network were 
found guilty. 
</P>
<P>
"We got numero uno, who was Flor Restrepo, and the others who followed her as 
well. That's usually not the case," Bryant-Deason said. 
</P>
<P>
The sisters were arrested April 10 in a string of arrests and raids that 
yielded a total of 1,166 pounds of cocaine, including 950 pounds that were 
seized in a van in Huntington Beach, and thousands of dollars. The total street 
value of the cocaine, weighing 1,200 pounds, was about $196 million, one of the 
biggest drug busts in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Others convicted on the same charges were their brother, Faber Antonio 
Restrepo, 26, a brother-in-law, Carlos Alberto Montoya, 32, and five 
associates: Claudio Roger Martinez, 26; Olga Naranjo Garcia, 32; Janeth 
Naranjo; 30; Juan Casanova, 34, and Luis Fernando Monsalve, 22. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police followed the network after a tip earlier in the year. After 
a two-month surveillance, police found 950 pounds of cocaine in a van driven by 
Martinez who was meeting with Monsalve and Casanova at the Westminster Pavilion 
Shopping Center. After those arrests, the police then issued search warrants 
for the rest of the network.

SBA ASKS CAMPBELL TO REPAY CONFERENCE FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Small Business Administration has asked state Sen. William R. Campbell 
(R-Hacienda Heights) to repay $49,300 that the SBA spent on a 1988 
Campbell-sponsored conference on women's issues, according to a federal 
watchdog agency. 
</P>
<P>
The SBA wants its money back because it contends that Campbell violated an oral 
agreement with the SBA on the fee that the conference's coordinator, a former 
Campbell aide, was to receive, according to a report released by the General 
Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The report does not say how much the organizer of the event was paid, nor did 
it give the figure that the SBA and Campbell purportedly had agreed on. 
</P>
<P>
Although the SBA made the reimbursement request in January, Campbell had not 
repaid the money as of May 9, the report states. 
</P>
<P>
While the report does not mention Campbell by name, an informed congressional 
source said that he is one of two unnamed California legislators to which the 
document refers. The other, who promptly returned $11,098 to the SBA after it 
made a similar complaint about a conference he sponsored, was identified by the 
source as state Sen. Ken Maddy (R-Fresno), a Campbell ally. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell's press secretary declined comment and referred all questions to John 
Costello, an accountant involved with the women's conference. Costello did not 
return several telephone calls Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell's 1988 Conference on Women, held in Anaheim, was coordinated by Karen 
L. Smith of Laguna Nigel, once Campbell's top aide in Orange County. Smith had 
coordinated the 1987 conference in partnership with Campbell's wife, Margene. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO study of the SBA's involvement in co-sponsoring events with private 
groups and public figures was requested by Sen. Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.). 
</P>
<P>
Of the 161 events that the regional office of the SBA co-sponsored between 
April and September of last year, Campbell's conference received the greatest 
subsidy, according to the report. The $49,300 was used to print and mail 
promotional and other material for the conference, one of several that Campbell 
has sponsored in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Only two of the events co-sponsored by the SBA, those involving Campbell and 
Maddy, were organized by public officials, the GAO said. Most of the rest were 
sponsored by nonprofit organizations, while 20 were put on by for-profit 
concerns.

Tracy Dupre of Newport Beach and her partner, Stephanie Martin of Camarillo, 
shot a 76 Friday to open a seven-shot lead in the girls' 12-18 four-ball 
competition at the La Paloma team golf tournament at Tucson, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
Dupre and Martin have a two-day total of four-over-par 148. 
</P>
<P>
In the boys' 12-14 four-ball, Joe and Ben Garner of El Toro struggled to an 86 
and dropped 16 shots behind the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Bestor of Laguna Niguel and Austin Maki of Costa Mesa, competing in the

opening-round 69 and trail the leaders by 19 strokes. 
</P>
<P>
Half the field in the boys' 15-18 division played the foursome format, in which 
partners alternate hitting shots. The other half played four-ball (better 
ball).

ST. JOSEPH HOSPITAL TO OPEN CENTER FOR TREATMENT OF HARD-TO-HEAL WOUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by Leslie Berkman, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
St. Joseph Hospital later this month will open near its Orange headquarters the 
first center licensed in Southern California to offer a new treatment developed 
to heal the wounds of diabetics, the elderly and other patients with 
circulatory problems. 
</P>
<P>
Sally Sims, executive director of clinical services for St. Joseph Hospital, 
said the hospital has been licensed by Caratech Inc. to use the firm's patented 
process to produce a substance for treating hard-to-heal wounds. 
</P>
<P>
Sims said the substance, called Procuren, is derived from a patient's own 
blood. By using the patented laboratory process, she said, certain cells that 
promote wound-healing tissue growth are taken from the blood and used to 
produce a clear liquid that is applied to the patient's wound. 
</P>
<P>
Diabetes creates circulatory problems that can cause chronic open wounds on the 
lower limbs, particularly the feet. The condition can lead to gangrene and 
amputation. 
</P>
<P>
Sims said Medicare as well as major private insurance companies will reimburse 
the cost of the Procuren treatment. She said that St. Joseph Hospital will 
charge $50 to $60 a day for the treatment and that most wounds will require 
daily treatment for at least eight to 10 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Sims said the St. Joseph Wound Care Center, scheduled to open July 18, will be 
housed at 845 W. La Veta Ave. in Orange, across the street from the hospital. 
She said it will have a staff of seven nurses and technicians. In addition, she 
said, a group of medical specialists will see patients there. She said the 
center will accept referrals from family physicians countywide. 
</P>
<P>
To date, Sims said, only nine wound-care centers in the country are licensed to 
provide treatment with Procuren. The only other California facility, she said, 
is Seton Hospital in San Francisco.

INVESTOR WANTS CONTROL OF NEWPORT ELECTRONICS; 
</P>
<P>
BID TO BUY 35% OF STOCK COMPLICATES PLAN TO MERGE WITH SENSOR CONTROL CORP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Like the wedding guest who objects to the marriage at the last moment, a 
Connecticut investor has spoken up in a bid to ruin the proposed merger between 
Newport Electronics Inc. and a Silicon Valley company. 
</P>
<P>
Milton B. Hollander of Stamford, Conn., who owns a 13% stake in Newport 
Electronics, launched a bid Thursday to take control of the Santa Ana firm, 
just one month before Newport's proposed merger with Sensor Control Corp. of 
Sunnyvale is expected to be completed. 
</P>
<P>
If Hollander's bid succeeds, Sensor Control and Newport Electronics will not be 
able to complete their merger, Ronald L. Wilson, Sensor's chief financial 
officer, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still reviewing what his offer is and what it means," Wilson said, "but 
we don't think his offer is as good as ours." 
</P>
<P>
Newport Electronics directors discussed the Hollander bid at a meeting Friday, 
board member Norman Gray said. Gray said the board reached no decision about 
whether to recommend or reject the new offer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agreement Made in April 
</P>
<P>
Newport agreed in April to be acquired by Sensor, a manufacturer of industrial 
sensors, for $9 a share, or $10.8 million. Officials of both companies said 
that the plans to merge are progressing and that the deal is scheduled to be 
completed in August. 
</P>
<P>
The new bid from Hollander will complicate those proceedings, however. 
</P>
<P>
Hollander, a self-employed engineer and former vice president at Gulf + Western 
Inc. (since renamed Paramount Communications) in New York, is proposing to buy 
392,000 shares of Newport for $9.50 a share, or $3.7 million, raising his stake 
in the firm to 48%. 
</P>
<P>
Hollander and his wife, Betty Ruth Hollander, are the sole owners of Omega 
Engineering Inc., a Stamford catalogue distributor of electronics instruments. 
Betty Hollander is the chief executive officer of Omega, and Milton Hollander 
is a director. 
</P>
<P>
Omega is a customer of both Newport and Sensor, according to officials of both 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Firm Makes Offer 
</P>
<P>
Hollander, whose offer is being made through a new company called High 
Technology Holding Corp., said he wants to obtain working control of Newport, 
according to a filing made Thursday with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
According to the filing, Hollander has no plans to replace Newport Chairman 
Barret B. Weekes or any of the other current Newport officers, but he did say 
that he will seek representation on its board. Hollander also said he would 
consider selling Newport to Omega. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson of Sensor said his company believes that its offer is better because it 
would pay $9 a share for 100% of Newport's stock. Hollander's bid would pay 
$9.50 a share for 35% of Newport's stock.

DIRECTOR HOPES TO KEEP O.C. JUMPIN' AWHILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They're back, and they're black, and they ain't misbehavin'. But Spike Lee's 
choreographer has every intention of keeping the joint jumpin'. 
</P>
<P>
"I flew from New York to do this," said Otis Sallid, who is co-directing the 
revival of "Ain't Misbehavin' " by the Orange County Black Actors Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"Ain't Misbehavin'," a musical tribute to legendary composer and jazz pianist 
Thomas (Fats) Waller, opens tonight on the Second Stage at South Coast 
Repertory in Costa Mesa and runs through July 16. 
</P>
<P>
The Broadway production won a Tony as the best musical of 1978, setting a 
standard for black stage revues that hasn't been matched since. (It also 
catapulted Nell Carter to fame.) 
</P>
<P>
"Fats was hot, really hot, and so was his period in the '20s and '30s," said 
Sallid, whose electrifying choreography in Lee's latest movie, "Do the Right 
Thing," defines hot for the '80s. "We're going to show you what it was like 
back then." 
</P>
<P>
To underscore Waller's era, Sallid said, he has staged "Ain't Misbehavin' " 
with period choreography, using such dance steps as the Shorty George, Count 
Your Money, Truckin', Walkin' the Dog and Fallin' off the Wheelbarrow. 
</P>
<P>
But if all of Waller's music was danceable -- it spanned waltzes, jitterbugs, 
blues and jazz -- his tunes were just as entertaining for their wickedly 
sophisticated lyrics (sometimes written with and by others). Many of the 30 
earthy songs that fill the score of the show are fabled for their double- and 
even triple-entendres. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the title of "This Joint Is Jumpin' " obviously denotes a place 
where everybody is having a terrific time. But it also suggests the use of 
potent marijuana and, on a deeper level, it has a specific sexual connotation. 
</P>
<P>
"Fats says one thing and means another," Sallid noted. "He was a great guy for 
metaphor. He was into rhyming and naming. When you work on his stuff, you get 
to see the relationship between what Fats did back then and what groups like 
Run DMC and Public Enemy are doing now." 
</P>
<P>
Of course there is nothing remotely like rap in "Ain't Misbehavin'," which 
features such tunes as "Honeysuckle Rose," "Squeeze Me" and "Keepin' Out of 
Mischief Now" as it moves between the black Tin Pan Alley of Harlem and the 
white downtown nightspots where Waller also entertained. 
</P>
<P>
"Fats mixed both worlds," said Adleane Hunter, who heads the black theater 
troupe and co-directed the show with Sallid. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Waller mixed more than that. Although all his music bears the stamp of 
his most influential teacher, ragtime/jazz pianist James P. Johnson, Waller 
also studied formal composition with Carl Bohm at the Juilliard School and 
classical piano technique with Leopold Godowsky. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider the thorough (left-hand) bass foundation I got in the study of Bach 
the best part of my training," Waller, who died in 1943 at the age of 39, once 
told Metronome magazine. And, he explained, "whenever you get stuck for a 
two-part harmonic device, you can always go back to Liszt or Chopin. (But) it's 
all in knowing what to put on the right beat." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter had planned to stage "Ain't Misbehavin' " last summer at South Coast 
only to find the rights withdrawn when a national touring revival was mounted 
last year with the original Broadway cast. "They thought it would be coming to 
Los Angeles and maybe to the (Orange County Performing Arts) Center," she 
recalled. "But it never did." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter staged "Eubie!" instead, which was just as well, she said, because it 
primed the troupe for the Waller show. "Fats' music is much more difficult than 
Eubie Blake's," she noted. "I'm not sure we would have been up to it last 
season." 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1982 as an outgrowth of an earlier group, the nonprofit Black Actors 
Theatre does not have its own performance space and is administered out of 
Hunter's home in Santa Ana. Its annual budget of $121,000 comes chiefly from 
ticket sales to productions that were scattered in four theaters over slightly 
more than the past year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The troupe's biggest hit until "Eubie!" was the non-musical "For Colored Girls 
Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf" in 1987. It too was 
mounted at South Coast's 161-seat Second Stage. 
</P>
<P>
"We're much closer to finding our own theater than we've ever been before," 
said Hunter. "It's an empty storefront in Santa Ana, which could be turned into 
a 100-seat house." (See accompanying story.) 
</P>
<P>
The cast of "Ain't Misbehavin' " features Rose Mallett, Tina Jackson, Michael 
Larche and Henry Weaver -- all back from "Eubie!" -- along with newcomers 
George Bouldin and Delilah Williams. They will be accompanied by a three-piece 
band, with music conductor Richard Abraham on stride piano "playing to the 
max," said Sallid. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the expense of staging the show -- about $41,000 -- Hunter said it 
can't break even unless it sells out. "This is a labor of love," she said. "The 
cast isn't even getting paid. It's worth it just to work." 
</P>
<P>
If it's any consolation, the original members of the Broadway cast started out 
with "Ain't Misbehavin' " at an Off Broadway theater that could afford to pay 
each of them only $25 for eight weeks of workshop performances. 
</P>
<P>
For the Harlem-born Sallid, "Ain't Misbehavin' " represents a return to the 
stage after working extensively in television (for Debbie Allen on "Fame"), in 
videos (he did Don Johnson's latest) and in movies (he choreographed Spike 
Lee's "School Daze" musical as well as "Do the Right Thing"). 
</P>
<P>
The show is also a directorial warm-up. In September, Sallid will begins 
rehearsals of "Tales of Manhattan," a musical he will direct by the rock 'n' 
roll songwriting team of Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller (They penned Elvis 
Presley's "Hound Dog," "Love Me Tender" and "Jailhouse Rock" and the Coasters' 
"Searchin'," "Yakety Yak" and "Charlie Brown"). 
</P>
<P>
"We're aiming for an opening on Broadway early next year," Sallid said. "I 
couldn't think up a better way to get my stuff together than working on Fats." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ain't Misbehavin"' runs through July 16 on the Second Stage at South Coast 
Repertory, 655 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Curtain times: 3 and 8:30 p.m. 
Saturdays; 3 and 8 p.m. Sundays, 8:30 p.m. Tuesday to Friday. Tickets: $18 to 
$22. Information: (714) 957-4033. The production will move to the Anaheim 
Cultural Arts Center, after it closes in Costa Mesa, from July 22 to Aug. 5.

HIGH-TECH HOME: HARD-OF-HEARING TUNE IN WITH HEADSETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA L. La GANGA, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
The cancer hit in 1986, requiring massive doses of radiation and chemotherapy. 
A year later, his hearing was all but gone, fallen victim to the drastic 
treatments that saved his life. Hearing aids in each ear helped bring back some 
semblance of a normal life for Marvin McConnell of Newport Beach, but 
television was pretty much out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
Until last year, when McConnell invested in a gadget called PrivatEar, an 
"infrared assistive listening device" that brought Laker basketball back into 
McConnell's home. 
</P>
<P>
Hearing aids and television do not mix, because hearing aids increase the 
volume of all sounds equally. So a device like the PrivatEar -- which brings 
sound directly from a transmitter on the television set to a set of headphones 
worn around the neck -- can be invaluable to Orange County's estimated 230,000 
hard-of-hearing residents. 
</P>
<P>
"If you just have your regular earphones (hearing aids) in, it's very difficult 
to watch television," McConnell explains. "They pick up the regular TV sound 
and the sound around you. They don't discriminate. So I could hear Chick Hearn, 
but I had a difficult time differentiating between his sound and the sounds of 
all the other activities around me." 
</P>
<P>
But wearing his wireless headphones, McConnell can pick up Lakers announcer 
Hearn without traffic and kitchen sounds from the house and neighborhood. The 
result, McConnell says, is "magnificent." 
</P>
<P>
The PrivatEar is one of a growing number of wireless headphone systems in use 
throughout the country -- everywhere from churches, cinemas and theaters to 
convention halls and private homes. 
</P>
<P>
The technology of infrared sound transmission was developed in the mid-1970s, 
originally for home, medical and educational uses; it was adapted for musical 
and theatrical applications around 1980. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of June, Mann Theatres opened eight screens in Laguna Niguel, 
complete with a system called Audex, which is manufactured by Audiometrics Inc. 
The Orange County Performing Arts Center employs a system manufactured by 
Sennheiser Electronics Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how home infrared listening systems work: A transmitter, usually no 
larger than a remote control device, is placed on top of the television set and 
plugged into the audio-out jack or headphone jack. The transmitter is also 
plugged into an electrical socket with an AC adapter. The hard-of-hearing 
television viewer wears a headset or headphones, depending on the brand of 
system. 
</P>
<P>
The transmitter converts sound from the television into infrared light pulses 
beamed across the room via light-emitting diodes. The headphones capture the 
infrared light and change it back into sound. A volume control on the 
headphones allows the hard-of-hearing viewer to make the sound as loud as 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Using an infrared system does not interfere with normal television viewing, so 
friends and family members without difficulty hearing can enjoy programs along 
with the hard-of-hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The systems "work very nicely in a home environment," said O.T. Kenworthy, 
director of audiology for the Providence Speech and Hearing Center, which is in 
the city of Orange and affiliated with Childrens Hospital of Orange County. 
"The infrared systems probably provide the best acoustic signal in a system 
that doesn't involve hooking you up directly. They are wireless." 
</P>
<P>
But they do have drawbacks, Kenworthy says. Price is one. Providence does not 
sell such devices, but opens up its Hear Center to the public every Wednesday 
to allow free trials of infrared systems and other gadgets that help the 
hearing-impaired cope with life more easily. 
</P>
<P>
McConnell bought his PrivatEar at the Hearing Enhancement Center in Costa Mesa. 
At the Hearing Enhancement Center, the PrivatEar starts at around $85. 
</P>
<P>
Another widely used system is made by Siemens Hearing Instruments Inc., a 
subsidiary of Sennheiser, which provided the Performing Arts Center's infrared 
theater system. The Siemens system runs about $325 at the Hearing Enhancement 
Center, says audiologist Mark Dobkin. 
</P>
<P>
"You're talking $325 to $400 by the time you buy accessories like the 
rechargeable batteries and various microphone units," Kenworthy says. "In 
addition, only people who are hard of hearing, with mild to severe hearing 
losses, can benefit from such a system. Someone with a profound hearing loss, a 
'deaf' person, would not be helped." 
</P>
<P>
But for television viewers like McConnell, a PrivatEar or Siemens system can 
bring entertainment back into the home via the television or videocassette 
recorder. And for many, that kind of help is worth the money. 
</P>
<P>
"Particularly for the elder folks, who are a little more TV-prone because of 
their lack of full activity, it's just a magnificent thing," says McConnell, 
68. "They can hear beautifully with it." 
</P>

If you are moving to a new home, redecorating or refurbishing an existing one, 
or merely giving your house a good thorough cleaning, you will likely be forced 
to face one of life's great challenges -- the dreaded shelf lining caper. 
</P>
<P>
Remember the frustrations of the last time you decided to line every shelf in 
the house? Measuring -- not quite accurately, as it turned out? Peeling, and 
positioning sticky paper that seemed to have a life of its own? 
</P>
<P>
Can your marriage survive another exasperating attempt? 
</P>
<P>
Well, Donna Bradshaw and her sister, Pam Owens, owners of the Santa Ana-based 
branch of American Shelf Lining, offer a simple alternative to the 
do-it-yourself frustrations that often accompany lining shelves. 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw, a former corporate real estate executive, and Owens, a former 
elementary school teacher, will handle the awful chore for you. Bradshaw takes 
care of customer inquires and appointment scheduling, while Owens does the 
measuring, banking and bookkeeping. For the installation itself they work as a 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw and Owens say their lining is unequaled and unavailable in the retail 
market. It comes in a choice of eight decorator colors (white, oyster, peach, 
sea foam green, pink, blue, dark gray and black). It is a medium weight, high 
gloss, patent leather-like vinyl, cut to measure and bonded to a specially 
designed backing, which, they say, ensures durability. American Shelf Lining 
guarantees both material and workmanship for life. 
</P>
<P>
When a prospective customer calls to inquire about an installation, an 
appointment for a free estimate is arranged, at which time all shelves and 
drawers are measured. A custom-designed and patented decimal tape measure is 
used that allows the team to measure 1/20th of an inch, assuring a perfect fit 
-- not only on shelf and drawer bottoms, but on sides, back and front as well. 
</P>
<P>
A hand-held computer feeds the measurements to the factory and then provides a 
complete printout of each drawer and shelf to be lined, including size and 
cost. The product is custom cut and hand-wrapped at the factory and shipped, 
ready to install. (The cost averages about $2.25 per square foot, says 
Bradshaw, for a total of anywhere from $1,000 to $1,500 depending on the size 
of the home.) 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw and Owens say the advantages of lining shelves this way are 
multifaceted. "The material is durable, shelves and drawers are custom fit, you 
don't have bubbles or curling edges, and it never needs to be replaced," says 
Bradshaw. 
</P>
<P>
Owens adds: "It is water-resistant, so spills wipe off easily, and grit and 
grime won't get stuck into crevices." 
</P>
<P>
Customers seem to like it too. Kim Levine, a Yorba Linda homemaker and mother 
of three is clearly delighted. "I had planned to do it myself, but I remembered 
the time I papered shelves in my last home," she says. "I am a perfectionist -- 
but no matter how careful you are, you just can't achieve a look like this. 
When we bought our new home, we decided to just go ahead and have it done 
professionally, and I am very, very glad we did." 
</P>
<P>
Levine's neighbor, Judy Altshuler, recently had her own home done. "I love it! 
Every time I open a drawer it looks so clean and bright and shiny -- it's just 
great," she says, "but the best part is it was so effortless for me!" 
</P>
<P>
A typical home can be lined in less than a normal working day, depending on how 
many rooms are lined. They will do an entire home or just a kitchen, depending 
on need and budget.

ON THE WATERFRONT: BOATER TURNS PROBLEM INTO PROFIT SEWING SHEETS FOR ODD-SIZED 
BUNKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEARLEAN DUKE, Shearlean Duke is a regular contributor to Orange County 
Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several years ago when Judy Schuda could not find any sheets to fit the 
odd-shaped bunk of the family's 32-foot sailboat, she finally gave up and made 
her own. Since then Schuda has been cutting and sewing custom sheets for 
boaters up and down the coast from San Diego to Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, she had to knock out a wall in the family's Irvine home to 
create a bigger sewing room and she had to quit her job as a school bus driver 
to work full time sewing sheets. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have a boat, you can't go to a retail store and buy sheets that fit," 
Schuda says. "They are just not available to fit (because of) the odd-sized 
berths on boats." 
</P>
<P>
What many boaters end up doing, Schuda says, is using sleeping bags on their 
berths. Some companies even specialize in producing elaborate, custom sleeping 
bags for boaters. And a few boat-canvas and upholstery companies, such as Amtex 
Manufacturing and Supply Co. in Newport Beach, do offer custom sheets, but the 
sheets make up only a small part of the company's business. 
</P>
<P>
Many boaters who can't find custom sheets just give up and try to make do with 
the standard store-bought sizes. But if you've ever tried to make up a narrow, 
pie-shaped bunk with a rectangular sheet that -- after a night of tossing and 
turning -- ends up as a rumpled ball near the foot of the berth, you will 
understand Judy Schuda's frustration. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have bought a sleeping bag," she says. "But I'm a little 
claustrophobic, and I don't like sleeping bags. I like all the comforts of home 
at sea." 
</P>
<P>
In her quest for a good night's sleep, Schuda, a frugal mother of nine who had 
made a few clothes for her children as they were growing up, bought a set of 
sheets and literally ripped them apart to find out how they were constructed. 
She then measured the berth on the family boat, made a pattern and sat down at 
her sewing machine. The result was a set of perfectly fitted sheets. 
</P>
<P>
When her boating friends saw the results, many asked her to make sheets for 
their boats. "Pretty soon, I was running down to Newport Beach on my lunch hour 
measuring berths," she says. "The sheet business kept growing, and I had to 
make a choice about quitting my job and doing this full time." 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Schuda left her job as a bus driver in the Anaheim City School 
District and founded a home-based, one-woman company called "Sleep at Sea with 
J." But among Orange County boaters, the 58-year-old Schuda is known simply as 
"The Sheet Lady." 
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, Schuda estimates that she has produced hundreds of 
custom sheets for boats ranging from 22 to 82 feet in length. "Every boat's 
berth is different," she says, "so if I make several sets of sheets for every 
berth in the boat, I embroider the sheets, so that the owner can tell which 
sheets fit which berths." 
</P>
<P>
Working in her enlarged sewing room, Schuda cuts and sews her sheets from 
factory-bought king-sized sheets, which usually provide enough leftover 
material to sew up a pair of pillow cases or shams. "People think that I 
probably buy material by the ream," she says, "but I couldn't work like that 
because a ream costs $5,000, and then all I would have was one color. If a 
boater wanted a different color, I couldn't provide it." 
</P>
<P>
It is more economical to order ready-made king-size flat sheets from the 
factory, she says. That way she can afford to keep a variety of colors in 
stock. "I can now offer 13 colors," she says. "And they are the latest colors." 
</P>
<P>
Average price for a set of Schuda's custom sheets, including an elasticized 
fitted bottom, flat top and a set of pillow cases or shams, is $175. That price 
includes monogramming, a service Schuda has been able to provide ever since a 
wealthy customer offered to lend her enough money to purchase a $17,000 
monogramming machine a few years ago. Schuda has already paid back the 
interest-free loan. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of Schuda's customers are from Southern California, she has had 
mail orders from Arizona, New Mexico, Florida and New York, even Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Schuda has been in the business for a while, she has built up a file 
of berth sizes of standard production boats and can produce sheets for certain 
vessels without having to drive out to the marina to take measurements. "And 
some of my business is now repeat business, in which I already have the boat's 
measurements on file," she says. 
</P>
<P>
But in most cases, Schuda actually visits the boat and measures each bunk 
herself to ensure a perfect fit. "One of the hardest jobs I ever did was for 
the aft cabin of a powerboat," she says, "which was 113 inches wide and had the 
oddest angles. I ended up having to piece it together." 
</P>
<P>
Other challenges have included producing narrow, five-cornered elasticized 
sheets, standard fare for many sailboats. In addition to sheets, Schuda now 
offeres customized quilted pads, blankets and coverlets. And now that she has 
the expensive monogramming machine, she also offeres monogrammed towels. 
</P>
<P>
"We all have our wants," she says, "and I am fulfilling a need for boaters. 
When my customers find I am a boater too, and that we talk the same language, 
it helps." 
</P>
<P>
Since Schuda began her business, she has pumped most of her profits back into 
it and now, in addition to two sewing machines and a monogramming machine, she 
even owns her own van. "I've had people who've seen my van with the name of my 
business on it and waited for me in the parking lot to order sheets," she says. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to expand her business, Schuda works most of the local boat shows 
and her one-woman company was recently registered with Dun &amp; Bradstreet, 
the well-known financial rating company. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody called me up and asked if I had 'a D &amp; B,' " Schuda says. "I 
didn't know what that was. Then Dun &amp; Bradstreet called and starting asking 
me all these questions. They investigated me and gave me a number. Then they 
sent me a nice letter." 
</P>
<P>
Schuda admits that most of her customers don't care about her newly acquired D 
&amp; B rating. "To them I'm still just 'The Sheet Lady' " 
</P>

FAMILY LIFE: THE BACK-YARD POOL: A DREAM COME TRUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HOFMANN, Jan Hofmann is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the street, our house hardly looks like a haven for decadent 
self-indulgence. We have a tastefully landscaped lawn that gets attacked once a 
week -- whether it needs it or not -- by gardeners wielding assorted 
noisemaking devices. The little alcove by the front door is downright prim, 
with its porch light discreetly hidden inside an ornate cast-iron hood. 
Everything looks firmly under control. 
</P>
<P>
But come around back, and you will see why some folks swore we had gone off the 
deep end when we moved in last summer. In fact, there's the deep end right over 
there. The shallow end is over here, next to the spa. 
</P>
<P>
We have a swimming pool. Nothing fancy, you understand. No faux boulders, no 
marble trim or waterfalls. Just a kidney-shaped blue puddle with a plain 
concrete deck and a narrow row of decorative tiles around it. It's not really 
ours -- we're renting -- but as long as we live here, we can pretend. 
</P>
<P>
Back-yard pools are certainly nothing unusual in these parts; they're as much a 
part of the county landscape as palm trees and clogged freeways. 
</P>
<P>
So I'm always more than a little surprised at the reactions I get from people 
when they hear about it or -- better yet -- when they step outside and get a 
look at the thing. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes with words, other times with alternate forms of expression -- dropped 
jaws, gasps, laughter -- they all seem to echo the same theme: 
</P>
<P>
"Pretty extravagant, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
"You've gone the whole nine yards this time." 
</P>
<P>
"Aren't you sort of spoiling your kids? And yourself?" 
</P>
<P>
That's about what I expected to hear from friends and relatives in other parts 
of the country. They accuse me of having gone truly Cally-forny, what with the 
ce-ment pond and all. 
</P>
<P>
But I didn't expect the locals to react that way. True, they're not as taken 
aback as the out-of-towners. But they still snicker when they call and hear my 
son say, "Mom's out in the spa right now. Can she call you back?" 
</P>
<P>
"So how's the screenplay?" one friend asked after I toweled off and returned 
his call. 
</P>
<P>
"What screenplay?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, if you've got a pool and spa, I figured you probably had a screenplay in 
development too." 
</P>
<P>
"Nope. No screenplay." 
</P>
<P>
"OK. So how's the Porsche?" 
</P>
<P>
"No Porsche, either." 
</P>
<P>
"Too bad," my friend said. "Guess that's what happens when you're spending all 
your money on a pool before you sell your screenplay." 
</P>
<P>
So what's the big deal? After all, the thing is filled with water, not gold 
coins. 
</P>
<P>
I finally figured out the reason for all the giggling and teasing. It's simple: 
They don't have pools. 
</P>
<P>
I've wanted a pool for as long as I can remember. To be fair, I must admit that 
this is not my first. The others, however, were just two feet deep, with 
cartoon characters all around their thin plastic walls. 
</P>
<P>
In the small southern Appalachian town where I grew up, there was -- as far as 
I knew -- just one kid whose family had a back-yard pool. Her dad was the local 
car dealer, so in addition to the pool, they always had a brand-new car. 
</P>
<P>
Once a year, she would invite all the other kids in her class over for a pool 
party. We would track up the house and leave wet towels everywhere and 
seriously deplete her mother's Band-Aid supply patching up our minor boo-boos. 
</P>
<P>
Every year, at least one kid's glasses would get stepped on and he would go 
home squinting. Our eyes got red, our fingers and toes got wrinkly. It was 
great fun. I wasn't even much of a swimmer, but I secretly vowed that someday 
I'd have a pool in my back yard. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the summer, all we had was the local municipal swimming pool. But 
it cost a quarter to get in, so we could hardly afford to go every day. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from that, the only pools I encountered were at motels on vacations. 
</P>
<P>
Many years later, when I moved to Orange County, I suddenly found myself 
surrounded by pools. Three of my four immediate neighbors had them. Sometimes, 
I admit, I would stand on tiptoe at the fence and gaze longingly at the 
sparkling blue water on the other side. It seemed like such a waste, because 
they were almost always empty. 
</P>
<P>
The few times they weren't, however, always seemed to be the hottest, smoggiest 
days of the year. I thought I already knew what the word hot meant, but I was 
wrong. It isn't the desert when the thermometer reads 120, and it isn't a muggy 
July afternoon in some landlocked, windless spot where the relative humidity is 
97% and you can't even sweat. 
</P>
<P>
No, the true definition of hot goes beyond that. When you're burning up in your 
own back yard and you hear your neighbors splashing around in their pool -- now 
that's hot! 
</P>
<P>
It got up to more than 100 degrees when we moved in here last Labor Day 
weekend. I don't think there could have been a more perfect time for us to make 
the transition. Finally, we were the folks doing the splashing. 
</P>
<P>
For the first few weeks, we were in it day and night. The kids would jump in as 
soon as they got home from school, sometimes to the detriment of their 
homework. 
</P>
<P>
I preferred floating around in an inflatable chair with a good book -- but not 
an expensive book, lest I happened to fall into the water with it. 
</P>
<P>
Now I was the mom who went around picking up wet towels and yelling at 
everybody to dry off before coming inside. I was the mom passing out Band-Aids. 
And unlike my childhood friend's mother, I was the mom who fretted constantly 
about not only safety but lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
I established and strictly enforced the rules: no swimming alone, no diving, no 
running, no glass. And no games that involved yelling, "Help! I'm drowning!" 
when you didn't really mean it. 
</P>
<P>
After a while, the novelty wore off. The temperature dropped, and the Santa Ana 
winds blew all the leaves off our neighbors' trees -- right into our pool. We 
fished out as many as we could, but only the pool man could get them all. 
</P>
<P>
By January, when what passes here for winter was at its coldest, we looked out 
and watched the rain splash into the pool and wondered what point there was in 
having it. 
</P>
<P>
"Can we turn on the heater?" my children asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Nope," I said. "I can't afford it." 
</P>
<P>
But then spring finally got here, and we promptly forgot all our doubts. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, I could always fire up the spa, no matter what the weather. Sometimes 
the kids and I would get in and soak together, relaxing and discussing the 
events of the day. Or I'd invite my friends over. 
</P>
<P>
Some of them were a little reluctant. That's one difference between Orange 
County and, say Marin County, north of San Francisco, legendary for its hot-tub 
debauchery. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't worry, I promise everybody can keep their suits on," I said. "It's not 
that kind of pool party." 
</P>
<P>
As I said, it's only water. You can make it into anything you want. For me, it 
is not decadence but simply the fulfillment of a promise made long ago by, and 
to, a little girl who had no idea how she was going to make it come true. 
</P>
<P>
I'm just glad the kid didn't want a Porsche too.

KEEP OFF THE GRASS; 
</P>
<P>
THAT'S BEST LAWN PROTECTION, SAYS EXPERT WHO CAN'T PRACTICE WHAT HE PREACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The guy with the greenest lawn in town has some advice, but there is a caveat: 
He does not practice what he preaches. 
</P>
<P>
"Try to keep activities off the grass," says Don Marshall, who encourages 
people in spiked shoes to run all over his domain, which is the field at 
Anaheim Stadium and the fairways at Anaheim Hills and Dad Miller golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall, golf course operations manager for the city of Anaheim, has a special 
task this year: Anaheim Stadium hosts the Baseball All-Star game on Tuesday, 
and millions of people will see whether his lawn looks good. Nothing less than 
perfection is permitted in this age of television. 
</P>
<P>
This time of year, when hot, dry weather bakes the verdant spears into a dull, 
yellow-brown on many an Orange County lawn, Marshall will pull all kinds of 
tricks to keep the turf at the stadium telegenic-green. Like lightly watering 
several times a day, over-seeding frequently and cutting the grass to exactly 1 
1/4 inches deep almost daily. 
</P>
<P>
As we said before, do not try these stunts at home. Marshall would not do this 
to his own lawn, or one of the golf courses, especially in July. 
</P>
<P>
"You should mow the least amount possible," he says. Turf height should be 
about two inches, which might hamper a ballplayer but preserves precious 
moisture in a conventional lawn. 
</P>
<P>
October, not July, is the best month to over-seed or reseed, since the intense 
heat and dryness take their toll on newly sprouted grass seed. And watering 
should be done not lightly and several times daily but perhaps two or three 
times a week, depending on the weather. Do it for good, long soaks, say 20 
minutes, but do not allow runoff. This allows the water to get down to the 
roots to provide a deep lawn rather than a shallow one that is more vulnerable 
to weather changes. 
</P>
<P>
At the stadium, they water periodically during the day, but the best time for 
lawns is early in the morning, "about two hours before dawn," Marshall says. 
This gives the ground time to absorb the water before the sun causes 
transpiration. It soaks the roots, leaves the leaves dry, and it actually 
washes the grass. Washes the grass? Oh come on, Don. Some of us have enough 
trouble keeping our cars clean. 
</P>
<P>
The man is serious: "You know the dew that you see on the grass the first thing 
in the morning? Well it contains a high amount of sugars; the sugars attract 
organisms." 
</P>
<P>
Organisms that lust after your lawn, that is. So, OK, life is sort of fair 
sometimes. Your lawn can't just lie there; it has to go on a diet just like the 
rest of us. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, before dawn is a good time to water," Marshall concludes, "but do it 
with a timer because who the hell wants to get up at that hour of the morning?" 
</P>
<P>
The field at the stadium, which is ripped up every January and a new one 
planted in March, a few weeks before baseball season begins, currently consists 
of bluegrass with a rye grass over-seeding. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall says the bluegrass, which was his second choice after the usual Santa 
Ana hybrid Bermuda grass turf became unavailable, is holding up well under the 
exertions of the Angels and their opponents. But bluegrass is a cool weather 
species not really adapted to this area, so it probably would not be a good 
choice for homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall recommends a strong Bermuda, with ryegrass over-seeding during the 
winter, or one of the new patented fescues, which stay green all year with the 
right care. Marathon grass, a thick fescue, is a good choice for a lawn but 
does not rejuvenate very quickly after damage, so it is not a good choice for 
ball fields. Bermuda types quickly recover from abuse because of their creeping 
stems. 
</P>
<P>
Pesticides are rarely used on the stadium field because of its protected venue 
and short duration but are used at the golf courses. "We don't use any Category 
I (highly toxic) materials," Marshall says. "We wouldn't use anything on a golf 
course that I wouldn't use on my own lawn." He would not recommend that a 
golfer consume anything that has touched the grass, such as a cigar tossed 
aside in between shots. But he warns against "hysteria" about pesticides. 
"Hell, the cigar will kill you before any of those pesticides will." 
</P>
<P>
For lawns, any good commercial product will do, Marshall says, especially those 
that also fertilize while killing bugs. 
</P>
<P>
As for fertilizers, again, what is good for the stadium is not necessarily good 
for the lawn keeper. The stadium bluegrass is a winter feeder, so Marshall 
rarely fertilizes. Bermuda grass is a summer feeder, and should not be 
fertilized in the winter. 
</P>
<P>
Where the line is drawn is not exactly clear, especially on lawns that are 
combinations of many grasses. And there are no guarantees. Marshall, who has 
been caring for golf turf since 1957, stresses: 
</P>
<P>
"As my old agronomy prof told me, 'You can't make grass grow; you can only help 
it grow.' " 
</P>
<P>
So what if all efforts fail? Is Marshall above adding a bit of artificial color 
to keep that stadium field a dreamlike green? 
</P>
<P>
"That's kind of a professional insult," he says, slightly ruffled. "Since 1982, 
we have not applied colorant to this field. If you have to paint the field, you 
might as well have Astroturf."

YOU CAN CONSERVE WATER WHILE NOURISHING LAWN IN ARID ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>

Is your lawn drinking you out of house and home? Large amounts of water can be 
saved by watering lawns properly and by taking some simple conservation 
measures. Here are a few: 
</P>
<P>
Water early in the morning, so most of the water gets down to the roots instead 
of evaporating. You can also water early in the evening, but morning is the 
best time. 
</P>
<P>
Water only enough to keep your lawn healthy. A steady schedule of three days a 
week in the summer is sufficient, except during extremely hot weather, when you 
can increase the amount or frequency. The Orange County Water District, which 
provides water for the northwestern half of the county, has a lawn watering 
guide available. It is a pocket slide device that tells you exactly how much 
water is needed for your lawn, based on the amount your sprinklers put out as 
measured in three cans placed on your lawn. Call (714) 963-5661 for 
information. 
</P>
<P>
Wash car on lawn, using little or no soap, which can be harmful to the grass. 
</P>
<P>
Sweep sidewalks and driveways rather than hosing them down. 
</P>
<P>
Control weeds; they use up the water that your lawn and garden need. 
</P>
<P>
Put down a layer of mulch in your garden. This will moderate soil temperatures, 
prevent soil compaction and discourage weed growth. 
</P>
<P>
Find leaks in hoses, pipes and faucets. This can be done by turning off all 
water sources inside and out and checking your water meter before and after a 
15-minute period to see if there has been any movement on the gauge. 
</P>
<P>
Mow less often and set the trim level higher. Taller grass holds moisture 
better. 
</P>
<P>
Avoid over-spray, in which sprinklers water paved areas, by adjusting sprinkler 
heads and turning down the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Use a garden hose to touch up any temporarily dry areas rather than 
over-watering a large area or the whole lawn. Uniform coverage is best. 
</P>
<P>
Cut the lawn down to size. Replace thirsty grass with decking, ground covers or 
porous pavement. The next logical step is the xeriscape, as decribed below. 
</P>
<P>
Adopt the xeriscape concept, which is a water-conserving landscape that 
combines minimal turf areas, drought-resistant plants and ground covers, 
irrigation instead of sprinkling and a regular schedule of maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Just tear it all up and pave the whole. . . . ROBERT KNIGHTSources: Water

GARDEN GAFFES: MISTAKING INSECTS FOR FUNGIS CAN HARM PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some county gardeners have been finding small blister-like growths on the 
leaves of their eugenia plants and treating them with fungicides. In fact, the 
culprit is a tiny insect pest called a psyllid that can quickly defoliate a 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people will think it's a fungus," said Kris Nolte of Dana Point 
Nursery. The problem can be treated with a spraying of Orthene if caught 
quickly enough, but the situation often goes unnoticed at first because the 
eugenia -- also known as the brush cherry -- is usually "kind of a background 
plant," Nolte said. Psyllid infestations have been on the rise in the past two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
If caught too late, the only solution is to cut back the leaves and wait for 
new growth. 
</P>
<P>
Tips from the California Nurserymen's Assn. -- Petunias can be deceiving. 
Beginning gardeners see young plants in bloom at the nursery when they are no 
larger than a teacup, not realizing that the plant can vastly increase in size. 
</P>
<P>
Pinching new growth regularly will keep the plants compact. Petunias require 
sun. They should be planted 8 to 18 inches apart because they spread rapidly. 
The petunia provides good summer color, with shades including soft pink, deep 
red, light blue, purple, cream, yellow and white. 
</P>
<P>
Fertilizers: Liquid or Dry? -- Many gardeners use liquid fertilizers, 
particularly varieties that are pre-mixed and attach to the hose, because of 
their convenience and fast action. The downside, however, is that they are 
usually washed away by the next watering. 
</P>
<P>
Dry fertilizers, in contrast, combine slow- and fast-release foods. This allows 
some food to be used immediately while keeping some in store for future 
waterings. As always, follow the application and watering directions on the 
fertilizer package. 
</P>
<P>
Thirsty Natives -- California native plants are touted as one way to cut down 
on water use. While they are an excellent way to save water in the long run, 
gardeners should realize that in the first year they need about as much water 
as popular exotic plants. 
</P>
<P>
This allows the plant to establish a viable root system and avoid shock in the 
crucial first year. After that, most native plants require little water and 
little maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Mulching Methods -- All lawns are not created equal, at least when it comes to 
mulching. Different grasses call for different approaches. 
</P>
<P>
Bermudas and St. Augustine grasses are usually mulched in spring, after being 
mowed to ground level and fed. Dichondra lawns should be mulched when they 
start to reseed. These grasses all call for a deep mulch. 
</P>
<P>
Blade grasses, on the other hand, should have a light mulch, a quarter to half 
an inch thick. 
</P>
<P>
Summer is a good time to mulch a flower bed, as it keeps roots cooler and helps 
the soil retain water, as well as keeping weeds down. Mulching before a 
vacation is a good idea, as the garden or lawn will require less water.

What's new on the market? 
</P>
<P>
A wood glue designed especially for darker woods. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturer's claim: The super-strength polymer glue is formulated to produce 
a close match to darker wood, such as mahogany, cherry and cedar. It helps to 
eliminate visible seams some yellow wood glues leave behind. It allows for easy 
alignment of parts, good penetration of woods and easy cleanup, yet bonds 
quickly. It is resistant to lacquers, varnishes, water and heat when dry. It 
also resists softening and gumming-up of sandpaper as well as the heat 
generated by sanding and cutting. It is water-based, non-sniffable and without 
harmful fumes. 
</P>
<P>
A solution that plates and replates pure gold over ordinary metals at home. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturer's claim: The solution is a bath that contains 24-karat gold in 
liquid form and works with the natural electromotive forces within the metals 
themselves. It will plate all jewelry and small items -- whether gold, gold 
plate, silver, silver plate, nickel, brass, copper or bronze -- quickly and 
inexpensively. It adheres evenly to the surface of clean base metals without 
forming ridges or lines. Items are placed in a basket with the activator for 
only 10 to 15 seconds and then washed in soapy water and buffed with a soft 
cloth. 
</P>
<P>
A hand masker-dispenser. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturer's claim: The dispenser enables professional or amateur painters to 
dispense a continuous sheet of masking paper or film in one smooth stroke. It 
is lightweight and compact. It places the protecting paper in place on walls, 
windows and floors so they are not damaged by paint runs, roller mist or 
overspray. It has only two moving parts and does not need lubrication. It comes 
with a carrying holster for convenience. 
</P>
<P>
The glue is manufactured by Borden Inc., 180 E. Broad St., Columbus, Ohio 
43215; the gold replating solution by Sheffield Plate Polish Co., 1600 
Orrington Ave., Evanston, Ill. 60201 and the masking tape dispenser by 3M DOY 
Business, Building 223-4S-01, 3M Center, St. Paul, Minn. 55144.
