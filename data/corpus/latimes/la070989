THE HARDEST HARDBALL IN THE WORLD; 
</P>
<P>
YOU GOTTA HAVE WA BY ROBERT WHITING (MACMILLAN: $17.95; 224 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The concept of kamikaze pilots has most certainly baffled the American mind 
ever since World War II. Loyalty to one's country is one thing; suicide on its 
behalf entirely another. 
</P>
<P>
So it is ironic that one of the best explanations of that Japanese approach to 
fighting a war comes in a book on the game of baseball, "You Gotta Have Wa 
(team harmony)" by Robert Whiting. 
</P>
<P>
In Whiting's book, baseball is everything to the Japanese, including war. Their 
approach to their version of the Great American Pastime is tense and 
militaristic. And the joy they seem to glean from it is consistent with their 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
The topic of Japanese baseball is probably not a particularly compelling one to 
many readers, including even the most avid sports fan. To the American at the 
corner bar, swilling beer while watching the Cubs and Cards from Wrigley Field 
and reading the box scores from the morning sports section, Japanese baseball 
is something played by a bunch of light-hitting Asians and a handful of 
Americans in the twilight of their careers. And the only reason the Americans 
are over there is for a couple of big paychecks before they go over the hill 
for good. 
</P>
<P>
Much of that is the truth. 
</P>
<P>
But Whiting turns this scenario into a fascinating collection of anecdotes 
that, in the end, adds up to a nicely researched and written book that goes 
beyond the games and the cliches and into some intriguing sports sociology. 
</P>
<P>
There are the Japanese heroes: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Choji Murati, the veteran pitcher who lived and breathed the accepted work 
ethic of a major-league pitcher by throwing hundreds of pitches each day, even 
on days when he wasn't in a game. Murati felt a twinge one day, kept right on 
throwing until the pain was so intense he simply could not do it any more, and 
finally came to Los Angeles, where Dr. Frank Jobe discovered he had been 
pitching with a severed tendon. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sachio Kinugasa, who stepped onto the field in the Japanese major leagues 
Oct. 18, 1970, and didn't step off again until he had played every game of 
every season and retired Oct. 22, 1987. In that time, he broke Lou Gehrig's 
consecutive game record of 2,130 with 2,215 of his own, and even kept playing 
the day after a pitch struck him and broke his left collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Shinechi Ishimaru, the 20-game-winning pitcher turned kamikaze pilot, whose 
heroics became legendary when he demanded to throw 10 strikes to a hastily 
recruited catcher on board his aircraft carrier before getting in his plane and 
flying off to his death. 
</P>
<P>
And there are the American anti-heroes, the gaijin (foreigners) who came to 
Japan to play for crowd appeal, huge salaries and, many felt, for the purpose 
of providing the Japanese press and fans with easy whipping boys: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Davey Johnson, a power hitter now managing the New York Mets, who enjoyed 
great success in Japan before suffering a hand injury that limited his hitting. 
In Japan, players play through injuries; they merely practice harder until the 
aches and pains depart. When Johnson wouldn't and couldn't, he was deemed to 
have disrupted team wa and eventually was released, even though he was among 
the best players on his team. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reggie Smith, the volatile former Dodger whose temper once took him into 
the stands after some fans at Candlestick Park in San Francisco. Smith was 
afforded little or no privacy, and his flamboyant personality flew right in the 
face of the Japanese way. The Japanese have a saying: "The nail that sticks up 
shall be hammered down." Eventually, Smith was, and left Japan in anger. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Randy Bass, arguably the most successful gaijin ever to play Japanese 
baseball, who got to within one home run of the fabled Sadaharu Oh. But then, 
in the final game of the season, his last chance to tie the record of 55 homers 
in a 130-game season, was thrown nothing buthorrible, unhittable pitches by 
Japanese pitchers. The manager of the team playing against Bass that night, who 
allegedly instructed his pitchers as to how to pitch to Bass, was, of course, 
Oh himself. 
</P>
<P>
Bass eventually left Japan because his 8-year-old son was suffering from a 
brain tumor. When Bass was criticized for putting family before team and for 
demanding that the medical insurance his contract called for be paid, the rift 
was too wide for him ever to return. And if there ever had been a chance for 
him to be forgiven and welcomed back, it ended when an official of his Japanese 
team, upon returning from California and a negotiating session with Bass, 
leaped to his death from a hotel balcony. Baseball kamikaze, apparently. 
</P>
<P>
Whiting captures all this and more in a wonderful narrative manner that gets 
the reader through the book quickly and easily. And he ends up with a picture 
of a Japanese culture so built around face-saving and group-think -- not to 
mention an American baseball culture built around ego and greed -- that it is a 
wonder the two cultures can even come close to co-existing in a game that has 
readily available weapons such as bats and balls. 
</P>
<P>
Among Whiting's most telling anecdotes is about an 11-year-old boy who went 
through a workout with his softball team on a hot day. The team's pregame 
workout consisted of 20 dashes of 160 yards each, a two-mile run and a fielding 
session of 100 ground balls. When the youngster's team lost, the coach ordered 
10 30-yard dashes, 10 60-yard dashes, 10 laps around the field (310 yards 
each), 10 sprints up and down the stadium stairs and 3 60-yard dashes to finish 
up. And all this without any water. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-year-old youngster collapsed and died of a heart attack. His parents 
sued the coach and team and were paid 40 million yen (about $260,000). The 
local newspaper, in reporting the incident, pointed out that the workout had 
been fairly normal. 
</P>
<P>
From the tone of Whiting's book, the only surprising thing about the case of 
the 11-year-old was that the parents even bothered to sue. Their son's death, 
while tragic, was also honorable in the context of what baseball symbolizes to 
the Japanese populace. 
</P>
<P>
No way, you see, should there be no wa.

MOVIES OF THE WEEK

<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Man With the Golden Gun (ABC Sunday at 8:30 p.m.), the ninth James Bond 
adventure, is virtually interchangeable with its predecessors, except that the 
double-entendres seem broader than ever. This time Agent 007's (Roger Moore) 
chief nemesis is Christopher Lee, in the title role. 
</P>
<P>
Of Pure Blood (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.), a 1986 TV movie, starts out credibly but 
becomes routine and predictable. Based on the Nazis' infamous Lebensborn 
program, which paired SS "supermen" with Aryan women to produce a "master 
race," it stars Lee Remick as a German-born American woman confronted with her 
past. 
</P>
<P>
The four-hour 1987 TV movie Hands of a Stranger (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m., 
completed Monday at 9 p.m.) is a raw and terrifying nail-biter that captures 
some of the heat, passion and suspense of Robert Daley's best-selling story 
about a cop's obsession with his wife's mysterious rape. Armand Assante and 
Beverly D'Angelo star. 
</P>
<P>
Beach Party (Channel 5 Monday at 8 p.m.), starring Frankie Avalon and Annette 
Funicello (natch), kicks off a week of American International "beach party" 
pictures of the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
In Jumpin' Jack Flash (Channel 11 Monday at 8 p.m.) Whoopi Goldberg, cast as a 
computer whiz caught up in espionage, makes this 1986 feature seem lots hipper 
than it really is. 
</P>
<P>
The James Bond series got off to a rousing start in 1963 with Dr. No (ABC 
Monday at 9 p.m.), which found Sean Connery's incomparable 007 taking on his 
first master villain (Joseph Wiseman). 
</P>
<P>
Anne Bancroft and her husband Mel Brooks attempted a 1983 remake of Ernst 
Lubitsch's To Be or Not to Be (Channel 11 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) in an effort to at 
last work together. They play stars of their Warsaw acting company on the eve 
of the Nazi invasion. There are amusing moments scattered here and there, but 
the comedy-adventure misfires because Brooks lacks the crucial Lubitsch touch 
and because we know far more than in 1942 the full extent of the Nazi evil, 
especially in regard to the fate of Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Sadie and Son (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.) is an overreaching 1987 TV movie that 
asks us to accept Debbie Reynolds as a Jewish New York cop who ends up teamed 
with her own son (Brian McNamara), a failed comedian. 
</P>
<P>
Dragnet (Channel 11 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) is the entertaining 1954 feature which 
Jack Webb adapted from his long-running radio and TV series. 
</P>
<P>
The impressive 1982 TV movie World War III (Channel 11 Thursday at 8 p.m., 
completed Friday at 8 p.m.) imagines a tense confrontation between the U.S. and 
the Soviet Union. Rock Hudson, David Soul and Brian Keith star. 
</P>
<P>
Grease (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 p.m.), that garish, amusing 1978 musical of 
high school life in the '50s, stars an appealing John Travolta and Olivia 
Newton-John. 
</P>
<P>
O'Hara's Wife (Channel 7 Thursday at 9 p.m.) is a 1982 theatrical release that 
was better suited to TV in the first place. Edward Asner stars as a workaholic 
attorney opposite Mariette Hartley, struck fatally by a massive brain 
hemorrhage but who returns on a ghostly mission to urge Asner to start living 
before it's too late. 
</P>
<P>
In the title role of Popeye (Channel 13 Friday at 8 p.m.), Robin Williams is 
fun and so is Shelley Duvall as Olive Oyl, but the Robert Altman film is 
nevertheless curiously lifeless. 
</P>
<P>
George C. Scott stars in the admirable 1986 TV movie version of The Murders in 
the Rue Morgue (CBS Friday at 9 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
Jean Renoir's celebrated, panoramic 1938 La Marseillaise airs on Channel 24 
Friday at 9 p.m. and Channel 28 at 11 p.m. as a celebration of the 200th 
anniversary of Bastille Day. It depicts the turbulent events that took place 
between July 14, 1789 and Aug. 10, 1792, culminating in the defeat of the 
Prussian infantry. Pierre Renoir and Louis Jouvet star. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday brings two Sam Peckinpah pictures, the so-so World War I epic, Circle 
of Iron (Channel 5 at 8 p.m.) and the exciting, amoral The Getaway (Channel 13 
at 9 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
Since Mac Davis and Jackie Gleason star in the amiable 1982 The Sting II (ABC 
Saturday at 9 p.m.), it's a good thing it's a variation of rather than a sequel 
to the Newman-Redford "Sting." 
</P>
<P>
S.O.B., Blake Edwards' always audacious, often hilarious and sometimes 
appalling, vitriolic Valentine to Hollywood, airs on Channel 9 Saturday at 10 
p.m. 
</P>

The ratings checks on movies in the TV log are provided by the Tribune TV Log 
listings service.

OIL DRILLING WITH A HUMAN FACE; 
</P>
<P>
OIL NOTES BY RICH BASS (HOUGHTON MIFFLIN: $16.95; 171 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert Kanigel, Kanigel writes often on science and technology 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Great idea: Who better to tell of the rousing, romantic world of oil discovery, 
of wildcats and roustabouts and instant millionaires, of the black science of 
finding liquid gold trapped underground for a hundred million years, than a 
petroleum geologist who can write? No need to confine himself to geology and 
drilling rigs, either. Include personal stuff too -- humanize it. The geologist 
at home, as it were -- off with his artist girlfriend, driving down the back 
roads of the rural South. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Great idea. And now, Rick Bass' "Oil Notes" in hand, we can weigh the results 
of the experiment: It didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
Bass could have brought it off. A real working geologist, like his father, he 
knows his oil; he hunts it for a living. And he's surely got the writerly gifts 
to tell about it, as we see, for example, in his account of core point: "While 
drilling, the bit grinds up underground rock into flake-shaped pieces brought 
to the surface by circulating mud. Analyzed, these often suffice to tell the 
geologist what he's encountered a mile down." 
</P>
<P>
But sometimes, as when near the oil, the geologist needs a closer reading. So 
he orders his men to take up the drill bit and replace it with a hollow tube 
perhaps 30 feet long laced with diamonds at one end; back underground, it cuts 
out a neat core of earth, the way a cookie cutter punches out cookie dough. 
</P>
<P>
"They bring the barrel up . . . and knock the core out by banging on the side 
of the barrel with hammers," writes Bass. "The core slides out like a skinny 
pole, wet and steaming, broken in places, but they piece it back together and 
wrap it quickly in foil to keep all the oils and gases and fluids trapped in it 
from escaping." These are then analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
But it's a big step to do all this -- and expensive. Ten thousand bucks for the 
diamond-studded barrel alone -- which you use only once. And the drilling has 
to stop. And you have to make sure you've got people on hand ready to rush off 
and analyze the samples. So picking the right time to do it -- establishing the 
core point -- is crucial. "Drilling, drilling, drilling, watching, and then 
knowing, or thinking you know, that you are right on top of the formation 
you're interested in: a foot above it or less. Son, you had better be right." 
</P>
<P>
Well, all this is great. Why, then, isn't there more of it? And that's just the 
problem: "Oil Notes" hasn't enough oil. 
</P>
<P>
What it has instead is the author's loose-fitting white T-shirt, his girlfriend 
Elizabeth, the big-antlered deer he sees, the biscuits and milk gravy he eats, 
his pet likes and dislikes. "I love sitting on tractors and smelling their old 
oil smell," he tells us. "It sounds as if I'm drinking beer but I'm not; it's 
really an orange soda, and the March sun going down is still warm on my left 
elbow." 
</P>
<P>
There's a merciless self-indulgence at work here, pumping out "telling details" 
not telling at all, but merely details. We care about the contents of the 
author's office in Jackson, Miss., not nearly as much as he thinks we should. 
He concludes his six-page inventory of erasers, newspaper clippings, oil 
exploration magazines, maps, arrowheads and bottles of antacid with the 
throwaway line: "It is a good place to work" -- as if that justifies subjecting 
the reader to it. A paragraph or two, maybe. But six pages? He prefaces it all 
with a question: "Do you want to know what my office looks like?" -- but, of 
course, never offers the opportunity to say, "No." 
</P>
<P>
It's not just that the personal details fail to enhance the book; they detract 
from it. At one point, the author starts to tell how some geologists, charged 
with eking out all they can from existing fields, seek never to drill a dry 
hole; while others, who hunt new fields and know they'll often come up dry, 
"don't especially care about being right or not, and don't particularly mind 
being less than careful with people's hopes. We're leaving the realm of geology 
here and going into the abrasions of sociology." 
</P>
<P>
Then, abruptly: ". . . wind on my porch this morning, and a mockingbird 
fighting something -- John Prine spinning on my turntable . . ." followed by 
his half-hearted return to a distinction that could have been developed, but 
now winds down to nothing within the space of a paragraph. 
</P>
<P>
We are supposed to experience links between the seeming trifles of Bass' 
personal life and the profundities of oil. Too often, though, the links are 
feeble, or non-existent, forged from air: "We lay in the hammock together 
today. Her yellow shirt was the color of a banana. I didn't go to work until 
10. I was burned out. I didn't lie, didn't call in sick. Just told them I'd be 
in around 10." 
</P>
<P>
"You can't find oil if you're not honest," he decides. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, while off with Bass, we are seduced into appreciating some lovely 
little scene, as when he finds two scraggly, worm-ridden, flea-tortured, 
abandoned puppies in the weeds, and drives them to Elizabeth's house. "We gave 
them milk. They paused before the bowl, then leapt upon it like hockey players 
in a face-off." 
</P>
<P>
And sometimes, he does link his life the oil fields. At one point, he tells 
how, when Coca-Cola changed its formula, he and Elizabeth had driven all over 
the country stocking up on old-formula Coke -- 800 cans of it. Then, 20 pages 
later, he argues that any oil gluts you see mask ever-smaller oil reserves, 
adding: "When they did away with the old Cokes, the day they stopped producing 
them, there were plenty of Cokes on the shelf, were there not? Perhaps even a 
glut, to someone interested in buying a lot of them? Hell, I bought a thousand, 
no sweat, and at a good price." 
</P>
<P>
Point made. But such revealing linkages come too rarely. And often we're 
driving to ask, "Where's the oil?" 
</P>
<P>
Astonishingly, for a book called "Oil Notes," there's far too little of it. How 
do you prepare the drill site? How do you control a drill bit two miles 
underground? What powers it? How long does a bit last? What does it look like? 
How do you know when it's hit something new? 
</P>
<P>
You won't find out here. 
</P>
<P>
Repeatedly, the author stops short of delivering the goods. To "log" a hole 
means to lower into it an electronic gizmo that emits signals and picks up 
others that together tell the geologist about underground formations. "I know 
what to look for," Bass writes, "and if I see the things I want to see -- good 
high resistivity, good porosity and good permeability, like the three cherries 
spinning into view at the end of a slot machine play -- then we've got a well, 
a producer." 
</P>
<P>
But what's "resistivity"? Or, for that matter, the others? And what makes them 
"good"? For the reader, they're just three more polysyllabic words, with no 
inkling as to what they mean, and making no contribution to his appreciation of 
the underground world. Bass knows what they mean. But it's as if the novelist 
in him secretly doubts that anyone cares about oil that much and so feels the 
need to cuteify it with his girlfriend and his vagrant puppies. 
</P>
<P>
But if it's not oil that justifies this book -- as its title seems to suggest 
it should -- then what does? The sun on the author's left elbow? 
</P>
<P>
"Occasionally," writes Bass, "you will meet a geologist with an ego, who acts 
as if every lift of his eyebrows should be chronicled in a little black book." 
"Oil Notes" has too many eyebrow lifts.

JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: GENTLEMEN AT ARMS; 
</P>
<P>
A 75-CENT POINT OF HONOR PROVIDES INSIGHT INTO THE CHARACTER OF HEROES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
AS LONG AS any of us veterans of World War II in the Pacific survive, there 
will be arguments about who or what really won the war. 
</P>
<P>
There will always be the gung-ho types for whom the answer is very simple: They 
won the war by themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Others will give credit to some junior officer whose courage and leadership 
turned the tide at Iwo Jima or Peleliu. 
</P>
<P>
High brass will always have its advocates: Some will insist that the shrewd and 
tough decisions of Adm. Chester Nimitz made the difference. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the admirers of Gen. Douglas MacArthur, of whom there are many, will 
insist that his reconquest of the Philippines was the turning point; others 
will argue that the U.S. Navy victory in Leyte Gulf made it possible. 
</P>
<P>
Many will credit the carrier bomber pilots who died pressing the attack against 
the Japanese carrier squadron in the critical battle of Midway. 
</P>
<P>
Others, taking a more democratic view, will say that the dedication of the 
American home front won the war. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, many will hold that the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki crushed 
the Japanese will to continue and brought the war to an end. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, I have come across two documents that, for me, leave little doubt 
that victory in the Pacific must be credited to the vigilance of the U.S. 
Marine Corps Quartermaster and the simple honesty of a junior officer. 
</P>
<P>
The documents have been sent to me by David K. Ellison of Palm Desert, a former 
Marine Corps captain. The first is a letter to him from the Quartermaster, U.S. 
Marine Corps Headquarters, Washington. It is dated Nov. 26, 1943. 
</P>
<P>
Ellison notes that he received the letter during a brief stay at Camp Elliot, 
near San Diego, on returning from New Zealand after having served at Pearl 
Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, at the Battle of Midway and on Guadalcanal. 
</P>
<P>
The letter follows: 
</P>
<P>
"Subject: Subsistence enroute. 
</P>
<P>
"Reference: Cmdg. Officer's Report of Troops carried, 24 October, 1943. 
</P>
<P>
"1. Records indicate that meal ticket 109,511 was issued in your favor for 126 
meals to be furnished enlisted men of the Marine Corps. Reference (a) states 
that 125 enlisted men performed the travel. Since you certified and signed the 
meal ticket, that 126 meals were furnished, it would appear that the extra meal 
was obtained by you. Since officers must not secure meals on meal tickets and 
in order that settlement can be made, it is requested that a draft or postal 
money order in the amount of $0.75 be forwarded direct to the disbursing 
officer, Quartermaster's Department, Headquarters U.S. Marine Corps, 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
"2. For convenience, a copy of this letter is forwarded with the request that 
same be returned with remittance. 
</P>
<P>
"SIGNED: By the Quartermaster." 
</P>
<P>
Ellison also enclosed his answer: 
</P>
<P>
"From: Capt. David Ellison, USMC. 
</P>
<P>
"To: The Disbursing Officer, Quartermaster's Department, U.S. Marine Corps, 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
"Subject: Subsistence enroute. 
</P>
<P>
"1. You are correct. Money order in the amount of seventy-five cents ($.75) 
enclosed." 
</P>
<P>
These letters, Ellison says, should "put to rest for all time any questions of 
how we won the war in the Pacific." 
</P>
<P>
Ellison recalls that the men were "a ragtag bunch from all over the South 
Pacific. Some sick, some well, some good poker players, some lousy poker 
players." He wonders whether this confession can get him tried for having 
played poker with enlisted men. 
</P>
<P>
I doubt it. I imagine the matter is dead in the files of Marine Corps 
Headquarters, just as I hope the medical report on the fractured vertebra I 
suffered in falling out of the second-story window of the Moana Hotel in 
Honolulu while celebrating our victory at Iwo Jima has long since been 
misplaced, burned or shredded. They said that because the injury was not caused 
by enemy action, I was not entitled to a Purple Heart. Nonsense. If the 
Japanese hadn't bombed Pearl Harbor, I'd never have fallen out of that window. 
</P>
<P>
But I agree with Ellison that victory in the Pacific depended finally on such 
virtues as the alertness, thoroughness and tenacity with which the 
Quartermaster detected and prosecuted Ellison's petty defalcation, and the 
promptness with which he came clean. 
</P>
<P>
Of such character is victory wrought. 
</P>
<P>
Semper fidelis!

THEATER PRODUCER JOSE ARMAND WANTS TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN CLASHING ART 
WORLDS

<TEXT>
<P>
It's midnight in Tijuana, and the border town is hopping. Jose Armand, a Los 
Angeles theater producer, is guiding a cadre of associates through the touristy 
Avenida Revolucion, a boulevard about to vroom into high gear. 
</P>
<P>
Drunk American jocks tote six packs; donkey-cart drivers offer Polaroids and 
the promise of immortality; and lost suburbanites who've been separated from 
tour groups whine helplessly. 
</P>
<P>
"It's T.J.," Armand comments to his L.A. compadres. "And anything can happen." 
</P>
<P>
He's not fooling around. As Armand spirits his group into the Rio Rita disco 
across the street from Denny's, the punk band Mercado Negro (Black Market) 
strums an eardrum-shattering note throughout the three-story club, warning the 
uninitiated that when they leave Rio Rita, they'll never be the same. 
</P>
<P>
Tijuana may seem like the trinket capital of the world, but this city of 1.5 
million has always been a hotbed for rock and experimental art making. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows this better than Armand, 35, who makes monthly trips between 
Tijuana and L.A., trying to build "bridges." He's also the director of Los 
Angeles' Festival Latino, an unprecedented gathering of Pan-Latin American 
experimental performance works, scheduled for next May -- a few months before 
the more Pacific Rim-oriented Los Angeles Festival being put together by Peter 
Sellars. 
</P>
<P>
Although Armand has far less financial support than Sellars, his goal, while 
modest, is similar. He says he wants to make L.A. "pay more than lip service to 
the multicultural rap." 
</P>
<P>
One way of doing this, he says, is to bring audiences from different and 
traditionally segregated communities together through art -- in his case, that 
means producing innovative theatrical 
</P>
<P>
events. 
</P>
<P>
Armand's dream is to create the kind of cultural exchange where Anglo and 
Latino artists would "be blown away by their common cultural bonds. . . . I'm 
searching for the bridges," he admits, "the uncharted one between various 
Latino cultures and the one between the Anglo and Latino experimental theater 
scenes." 
</P>
<P>
Usually, he finds it. For Tijuana literally quakes with acoustic electricity 
and poetic justice. The scene dares all would-be rockers to break the sound 
barrier with a quasi-Jesus and Mary Chain metallic Latin style. 
</P>
<P>
Guitarist Carlos Santana used to jam in Tijuana, a fact that does not go 
unmentioned by the four cool dudes who form Mercado Negro and who rattle off 
bands that inspire them -- the Dead Kennedys, the B-52s. 
</P>
<P>
When Armand shows up, the rockeros are so jazzed that they stop tuning up and 
flirting. To the members of Mercado Negro, Armand represents the bridge between 
the "big time" of L.A. and Tijuana avant-garde. 
</P>
<P>
It all sounds so rosy until you see the thorns. 
</P>
<P>
Armand is Cuban. And among Chicanos who have struggled hard to establish 
cultural pride in Southern California, Armand often feels like an uninvited 
guest. 
</P>
<P>
When he first went to Tijuana, he was braced for the standard, if traumatic, 
discrimination he says he's been subjected to from Mexican-Americans here. 
</P>
<P>
But the border writers, musicians and performers who make up the burgeoning art 
scene that tourists seldom see had nothing against Armand. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Armand can be both a placid and passionate man -- a bohemian with 
hip-length hair; his integrity is apparently catchy. He has endeared himself to 
the kind of experimental artists who hang out at Rio Rita. His monthly trips to 
Tijuana have made him a familiar face. He says he and his associates are there 
to check out the "wound" between the two countries -- and that impresses the 
people there. 
</P>
<P>
In the nightclub, Tijuana rockabilly music starts up to announce the entrance 
of a Tijuana star: the torch-bearer of the Baja performance art world, Carlos 
Niebla. 
</P>
<P>
Niebla cries out in Spanish, and the spectacle begins. Mercado Negro punctuates 
Niebla's performance with harsh chords and delirious drumming. 
</P>
<P>
"The performance work is called 'Dios en la Tierra,' or 'God on Earth,' " 
Armand says, narrating calmly to his friends and a reporter, even though he has 
to scream to be heard. 
</P>
<P>
The piece's message -- that liberty is the most precious possession in life -- 
has moved many viewers, including Armand, to tears. After the performance, 
Armand greets Niebla warmly: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm crazy about your show," he says in Spanish. "We'd love to produce you in 
L.A., because there's just no one like you there." 
</P>
<P>
And, in fact, he did, last Wednesday night at Jack's Placita in downtown Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Armand's life has been a crash course in independence, and his main teacher has 
been art -- specifically, the theater. 
</P>
<P>
In 1962, when Armand was 8, the revolution had reached a climax in his native 
Cuba. He and his family, who were preparing to leave the island, lived in a 
poor town. 
</P>
<P>
To protect himself physically and mentally from arbitrary cross fire, Armand 
would gather friends in his house and direct little plays about war. 
</P>
<P>
This combination of politics and art came in handy years later, when at the 
theater department at Miami -- Dade Junior College, Armand found himself 
leading classes with the Promoteo Players, an influential theater troupe. 
</P>
<P>
But this legacy also had its drawbacks. When Armand moved to L.A. in the late 
'70s to complete his theater degree at Cal State L.A., he realized that he was 
practically a stranger in a city with one of the largest Latino populations in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like an outsider both as a Latino in the white world and as a Cuban 
among clannish Chicanos. . . ," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
This "constant state of otherness" provided him with what many see as his 
obsession for "multiculturalism," an appreciation for "the entirety of our 
Latin-American roots, not just that of a particular country or a particular 
sexuality or a particular ideology." 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Armand founded the Latino Ensemble, a nonprofit Pan-Latin American 
production entity that produces experimental Latino plays in various locations 
around the city. 
</P>
<P>
Armand, who makes his home in Echo Park, has been the artistic producing 
director since 1984, presenting plays on subjects usually considered taboo by 
his Latino colleagues: racism and homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
His collaborators are "Que Pasa U.S.A" star Connie Ramirez, designer and 
graphic artist Angel Ramirez, technical director Mario Martinez, administrator 
Derrick Washington and actress Norma Maldonado. 
</P>
<P>
During the Olympic Arts Festival, the Latino Ensemble staged its acclaimed "The 
Night of the Assassins" at the 
</P>
<P>
Inner City Cultural Center, a venue in the heart of the black community. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the Latino Ensemble produced the bilingual "Paper Flowers" -- which 
dealt with class and sexual struggles -- at the Boyd Street Theater downtown. 
And then during the 1987 Fringe Festival, Armand produced "Garden of Delights," 
under the auspices of the Gay and Lesbian Theater Alliance's "Purple Stages" 
series. 
</P>
<P>
Armand has also emerged as the most vocal spokesman for Latino arts and 
multicultural dialogue in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Partly because Armand has not played a dominant role in the L.A. theater scene 
for very long, his colleagues have few criticisms. 
</P>
<P>
He has just taken on a leadership position in the Arts Congress, a 1,000-member 
multiracial ad hoc group that recently banded together to advise Al Nodal, the 
new general manager of the city of Los Angeles' Cultural Affairs Department, on 
how to spend the new $20-million Arts Endowment. 
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing but the greatest respect for him, both as an artist and as an 
organizer," Nodal says about Armand. "He's been working to bring different 
audiences together for years, and I think he's great." 
</P>
<P>
Adds Aaron Paley, director of the 1987 Los Angeles Fringe Festival: "The work 
Jose is doing with the Latino Ensemble of bringing people together from 
different communities is admirable and worthy of the Latino community here. I 
am highly supportive of his Festival Latino; it could really revolutionize the 
L.A. theater community." 
</P>
<P>
"Latino artists hardly ever talk to each other," Armand admits. "If anything, 
our interaction is characterized by suspicion and anger." 
</P>
<P>
Armand is referring to a major bone of contention within the Latino art 
community: The venues that cater to Latino needs are rigid, rarefied and 
ruthlessly exclusive. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone talks about multiculturalism," he explains, "but very few people do 
anything to cultivate it." 
</P>
<P>
In April, Armand organized a rare occurrence in the Latino theater scene: a 
conference to discuss multicultural issues. The list of prominent panelists 
included Nodal; Jose Luis Valenzuela, director of the Latino Lab at the Los 
Angeles Theater Center; and Judith Hoye, of California Lawyers for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
There was an easily reached consensus on such safe issues as "non-traditional 
casting," where it was argued, for instance, that mainstream theater should be 
less uptight about having a black woman play the wife of a white husband. But 
when Armand, as the moderator, brought up the idea of multiculturalism, "anger 
filled the room." 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, everyone still operates in their own segregated and 
ghetto-ized cliques," Armand said. "People have worked so hard to get grants 
and funding that they are afraid that this new word -- multiculturalism -- 
might take hard-earned goodies away from them. 
</P>
<P>
"Oppressed groups," he answers, "sometimes feel that they have to consolidate 
power . . . before reaching outward. "It seems that Los Angeles Theatre Center 
is cleaning up its act," Armand observes, referring to LATC director Bill 
Bushnell's Latino Lab, which had the reputation of working only with Chicanos. 
"And while Chicanos make up the bulk of Latinos in L.A., that was very 
discriminatory to the thousands of us who are not." 
</P>
<P>
"Only one venue, Bilingual Foundation for the Arts, seems to program Latino 
Theater regularly," Armand says. "And there's no Latino theater award that 
would unite us, like the Drama-Logue awards. The Nosotros Foundation only 
awards (to) film and TV figures." 
</P>
<P>
But Armand doesn't want to be "bogged down in negativity." He believes that 
criticisms "must be made," but also feels too "much time is wasted in fighting 
to get in tired institutions rather than creating our own." 
</P>
<P>
So with the Latino Ensemble and Festival Latino, that's just what he did. 
</P>
<P>
There's been a new birth of Latino activism in the arts, according to Armand. 
It parallels what he calls the explosion of activism that began in November, 
1988, when the Los Angeles City Council passed four ordinances to create the 
$20-million L.A. Arts Endowment. 
</P>
<P>
Armand remembers being shocked that 300 Latino artists had showed up to the 
Arts Congress meetings that took place on March 5 at Self-Help Graphics. People 
like performance artist Gronk and visual artists Patssi Valdez and Dolores 
Guerrero Cruz had crowded into the standing-room-only reception room. And 
people talked to each other! Old grudges seemed forgotten! 
</P>
<P>
Armand had decided not to speak. He and his collegues had wanted to show a 
united front; criticism could only hurt their case, they reasoned, and could be 
used as fodder by the mainstream press to show Latinos fighting each other. 
</P>
<P>
But toward the end of the evening, Armand grew livid at mock harmony. 
</P>
<P>
"What I have to say here tonight is not easy for me," he intoned. The room grew 
incredibly still. 
</P>
<P>
"Previously, when I have addressed Anglo crowds to raise issues of Latino 
rights, the task has been easier, but I find now that I must express my outrage 
against the few major institutions that supposedly represent Latino artists. 
All of us here know about these institutions, mostly because their doors have 
been locked and the houses dark for too long, and we have been kept out from 
them." 
</P>
<P>
"I must challenge this unspoken complicity. . . . I question how long these 
institutions will keep on getting funded. We need access to space for 
rehearsal, performances and showcases for our work as Latinos." 
</P>
<P>
The crowd burst into applause. Afterward, artists who had kept their criticisms 
to themselves, began speaking up, supporting Armand's brutal slap in the face 
to the Latino arts scene. Artists recounted hellish stories about some Latino 
organizations keeping out non -- Chicano artists or discriminating against 
artists who seemed to be avant-garde or gay. 
</P>
<P>
Valdez, the visual artist, reminded the crowd that a group of Chicano artists 
had picketed Plaza de la Raza two years ago with these chants: "Plaza, Open 
Your Doors." 
</P>
<P>
Artists fired by Armand's speech approached Nodal and City Councilman Joel 
Wachs, asking them this question: "If we have no access into the Anglo 
avant-garde and even less into Latino institutions, where do we do our work? 
What good is an arts endowment if we have no place to show our art?" 
</P>
<P>
Armand's answer is simple: "We should criticize places like Plaza de la Raza 
and the Los Angeles Theatre Center's Latino Lab, but we should not stop there. 
Our challenge is to present work anywhere and any way that is feasible, whether 
it's in the street or in a bar or in our homes. . . . No one else can do it for 
us."

THE TESTAMENT OF A LESBIAN WIDOW; 
</P>
<P>
THE EDUCATION OF HARRIET HATFIELD BY MAY SARTON (W. W. NORTON: $17.95; 307 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Katherine V. Forrest, Forrest is a writer-editor. Her sixth novel, The 
Beverly Malibu, will be published by Naiad Press in October. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
May Sarton's 77 years of life have provided a lode of artistic subject matter 
and she has quarried a great quantity of it. 
</P>
<P>
We have experienced her pleasures in friends both human and animal -- and the 
passing of many of those friends. We've shared her "grand passion for 
gardening," her love of fine literature and music. We've listened to her 
acerbic reflections on the passing political scene, her candid assessments of 
other writers, her insights into the phases of aging. Through it all, she has 
fulminated unceasingly in both journal and interview over the "lack of serious 
critical attention" given her work. Whatever the critical response or lack of 
it, the significant value of Sarton's work lies in its clear relevance to 
women's emotional lives. 
</P>
<P>
Her 1973 novel, "As We Are Now," is unusual in theme -- a strong, moving, 
beautifully crafted story of a woman in a nursing home. "A Reckoning," about a 
woman coming to terms with her life before death takes her, is of transcendent 
importance because it belongs on that short shelf of novels dealing with this 
theme. 
</P>
<P>
Reviewer Lore Dickstein, who had the temerity to call "A Reckoning" a lesbian 
novel in the pages of the New York Times, was raked over the fires of Sarton's 
fury throughout her journal, "Recovering." In a March interview in Writer's 
Digest, Sarton stated that she cannot be labeled a lesbian writer because "only 
one of my books deals with that subject." 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Sarton's "only" (in her eyes) book about "that subject" was "Mrs. 
Stevens Hears the Mermaids Singing," published in 1965. This book emerges from 
the body of Sarton's work as an autobiographical study of the inner artistic 
workings of a poet whose muse is always a woman, whose creative force arises 
from her passionate emotion for that woman. The publication of "Mrs. Stevens" 
was a courageous act in its time, and Sarton later said of the book, ". . . I 
am well aware that I probably could not have 'leveled' as I did in that book 
had I had any family . . . and perhaps not if I had had a regular job." 
</P>
<P>
Now another of Sarton's novels deals with "that subject," and unlike "Mrs. 
Stevens," which thematically dealt with homosexuality only as a creative 
source, "The Education of Harriet Hatfield" deals with it unequivocally as a 
social issue. 
</P>
<P>
Harriet Hatfield is 60 years old. Her companion of 30 years, a professional 
woman who sheltered Harriet and dominated her, has died. After months of grief, 
Harriet attempts to reclaim her life by fulfilling a dream: to open a bookstore 
which will be "a haven for women." 
</P>
<P>
Soon an assortment of women wend their way to her store, located in a carefully 
chosen lower-class suburb near Boston. Martha Blackstone, whose marriage is 
smothering her career as an artist, is a stock figure from a number of Sarton 
novels. There are Chris and Mary, two nuns at home between trips to El 
Salvador. And lesbians Erica and Veronica. And two gay men, Eddie and Joe. A 
black woman, Nan Blakely. And annoying Sue Bagley, whose disapproval of the 
store's "queer" clientele causes Harriet to reflect, "The image of gay and 
lesbian in the public's mind is, of course, the young and exhibitionist, the 
outre and the promiscuous, visible and shocking. And if none of the old and 
respectable like me ever admit what they are that image will reinforce 
discriminatory laws. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
When she is visited by a reporter from the Boston Globe, Harriet speaks out: "I 
want it known that an elderly woman, as you see I am, can be a lesbian and 
certainly in the case of . . . my lifelong friend, a distinguished member of 
society. Isn't it time a whole submerged part of respectable society came out 
into the open?" 
</P>
<P>
In response to the newspaper article, Harriet receives threatening letters and 
her store is hit by vandalism. Her cadre of supporters rally as best they can 
to protect her . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Based on this scenario, "The Education of Harriet Hatfield" seems to have the 
potential to become a significant addition to Sarton's body of work. The 
problem is that within the social milieu of 1989, the "education" Harriet 
receives turns out to be conspicuously narrow. 
</P>
<P>
A source of the problem is the background Sarton has set up for Harriet; her 
dead companion was the editor and owner of a small publishing house, and 
Harriet is a women's bookstore owner. Yet Harriet is so unaware of basic 
women's issues that she might have stepped into a time capsule in the '50s, to 
emerge in the '80s. She professes amazement at the inequitable results of 
no-fault divorce to the victimized divorcee who assists her in the store. She 
says of her bookstore clientele, "It never occurred to me that the women were 
bound to be feminists, and some of them lesbians." 
</P>
<P>
She listens to the clamoring voices of 1980s women, yet never hears the 
hard-won wisdom shouting from her own bookshelves -- such as the shelf of books 
about battered women. So when artist friend Martha ends up hospitalized from 
her husband's assault, Harriet recommends a visit to a psychiatrist, and is 
pleased when Martha afterward returns to her husband. The Pollyanna-like 
resolution is, regrettably, typical of this anachronistic novel. 
</P>
<P>
Lesbian Harriet concedes the literary existence of Gertrude Stein and poet 
Adrienne Rich, but says dismissively, "I am not chiefly interested in lesbians 
or the very little lesbian literature there is, not at all." Last year alone, 
more than 1,000 gay and lesbian books were published -- but none of this 
dynamic activity manages to swim into Harriet's ken. 
</P>
<P>
After Harriet's interview is published in the Globe, her younger brother 
discloses to her that he is gay. If he were your brother, wouldn't you give 
immediate thought to the peril of AIDS? Not Harriet, not until pages later, as 
an afterthought in another scene. Then Harriet learns that Eddie, one of her 
two new gay friends, has contracted AIDS because he has not been monogamous in 
his relationship with Joe. Never is there any hint that Joe is in any jeopardy 
-- only Eddie, the straying partner. And at a time when drugs are prolonging 
the lives of people with AIDS, Eddie is immediately on his deathbed. 
</P>
<P>
The characters who assemble in Harriet Hatfield's bookstore are clothed in both 
stereotype and sentimentality, the women all conforming to Harriet's 
Panglossian view of her "haven for women." Despite the store's blue-collar 
location, scarcely anyone who comes in is poor by any realistic definition of 
that term. Eddie's untidy dying is kept off stage; gay-bashing violence is 
confined to the shooting of a beloved pet; even the vandalism to the store 
consists of washable graffiti on the store windows. 
</P>
<P>
Repetitive language and surprisingly poor craft add to the problems. We are 
given a scene, only to have Harriet repeat the events of the scene to one 
character after another. W. W. Norton, with whom Sarton has published for 
decades, owed this author better editorial support. 
</P>
<P>
However, Sarton chooses to view her many fictional portraits of women who 
identify emotionally with other women, she has always had a devoted lesbian 
following, especially in the past when quality fiction for or about lesbians 
was rarely published. But "Harriet Hatfield" contains such scant relevance to 
the real lives of women today, whether heterosexual or lesbian, that the 
primary audience for this book would appear to be Sarton's faithful readers in 
her own age group. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1982 interview for the Paris Review, Sarton stated that she considered 
herself a bridge between the homosexual and heterosexual worlds. In this new 
novel she may be speaking for both her art and her life when she says through 
Harriet, "But if only the obvious, the exhibitionist, the aggressively 
role-conscious women 'come out,' how is a bridge ever to be made? And is it not 
precisely that bridge that I had envisioned, though not consciously, when I 
dreamed of a women's bookstore?" 
</P>
<P>
Sarton has termed herself "a solitary." Indeed she is. Because the sad, lonely 
fact about being a bridge is that one does not, in actuality, belong anywhere.

<P>
Such a fuss about the flag. After the Supreme Court ruled that burning it 
during a political protest was legally protected free speech, George Bush came 
on television to announce that he supports a constitutional amendment that 
would override the decision. 
</P>
<P>
In typical Bushian syntax, the President declared that "I just feel very, very 
strongly about it, and perhaps I haven't been quite as emotional as I feel 
about it. But I want to take this opportunity to say protest should not extend 
to desecration of the unique symbol of America, and that is our flag." 
</P>
<P>
What -- we're the only country with a flag now? Well, we know what he was 
trying to say. 
</P>
<P>
Many people did find the Supreme Court decision galling and absurd, though with 
Bush attacking it, it begins to take on a certain appeal. At the press 
conference, meanwhile, it was Brit Hume of ABC News who asked the smuggest and 
most sarcastic flag question: 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. President, in light of your renewed concern about the display of proper 
reverence for the flag, I wonder if you think it helps the situation, sir, for 
you and other political figures of both parties to make the flag the kind of 
instrument of partisan politics that it was in your campaign last fall, with a 
visit to Flag City and the tour of flag factories and flags at all the 
conventions and so forth?" 
</P>
<P>
Flash! Hume walks into a political convention and is shocked, shocked, to find 
flag-waving going on there! Next thing you know, those rascally politicians 
will be kissing babies! 
</P>
<P>
It's ironic that Hume should be the one to ask that question. For one thing, 
his network was the only one not to carry the press conference live. CBS, CNN 
and NBC did. For another, ABC is the network that has tried the hardest to 
appropriate the U.S. flag as its own corporate symbol. 
</P>
<P>
At ABC News, they plaster the flag on news promos, newscasts and documentaries. 
The opening logo for the "Burning Questions" series of special reports looked, 
in fact, like a smoldering flag. Maybe if Bush gets his amendment through, ABC 
News will go to jail. 
</P>
<P>
It's just a thought. 
</P>
<P>
Other national symbols besides the flag are regularly called into the service 
of commercial concerns on TV. NBC News tried to make the Statue of Liberty a 
kind of second NBC peacock. The statue was featured on the opening of "NBC 
Nightly News" and on news briefs during the day. This seems to have abated. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's Sure, the deodorant whose ads feature people with their arms 
raised as a way of demonstrating the efficacy of the product. The commercials 
usually end with a shot of the Statue of Liberty with her arm raised. 
</P>
<P>
This is the same revered icon that Chinese students copied for their brave and 
historic protests in Beijing's Tian An Men Square. They seemed to have shown it 
more reverence than we do. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are cultural treasures. Nobody in the world but me seemed appalled 
when United Airlines purchased the rights to turn George Gershwin's "Rhapsody 
in Blue" into a corporate jingle. Children will henceforth think of it not as 
Gershwin's masterwork but as the song of the friendly skies. 
</P>
<P>
Madison Avenue is no respecter of songs, no respecter of symbols, no respecter 
of anything. They will use Mozart to sell detergent and Vivaldi to move 
weenies. And they will use a national hymn like "America the Beautiful" to sell 
carpet, as Sears has done.

The publishers of Cole Porter's music must really need the money for them to 
have sold "I've Got You Under My Skin" for use by a toilet bowl cleanser. It is 
now known as "I've Got You Under My Rim." A toilet sings it. 
</P>
<P>
Every society has its symbols and treasures. If you watch enough television, 
and most people watch too much, you will see most cherished symbols misused, 
maligned or mangled. The only way to stop this would probably be to ban 
television, and we can't do that, now can we?

We watched a recent telecast of "Entertainment Tonight" because it was going to 
feature Alex Trebek explaining how very careful steps were being taken by 
"Jeopardy!" and himself to see that contestants were properly isolated. What a 
joke. The film clips showed about 30 seconds of Trebek, and the rest of the 
story focused on different contests held years and years ago such as "The 
$64,000 Question" and "What's My Line?"

<P>
Because the ones I work for do not love me, because I have said too much and I 
haven't been sure of what is right and I've hated the people I've trusted, 
because I work in an office and we are lost and when I come home I say their 
lives are theirs and they don't know what they apologize for and none of it 
mended, because I let them beat me and I remember something of mine which not 
everyone has, and because I lie to keep my self and my hands my voice on the 
phone what I swallow what hurts me, because I hurt them -- 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
I give them the hours I spend away from them and carry them, even in my sleep, 
at least as the nag of a misplaced shoe, for years after I have quit and gone 
on to another job where I hesitate in telling and I remember and I resent 
having had to spend more time with them than with the ones I love.

THE HIGH STAKES OF STAND-UP COMEDY: THE SEDUCTION BY TV AND MOVIES; 
</P>
<P>
FOUR DAYS IN VEGAS ADD UP TO A HUGE GAMBLE FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED 
</P>

For most of the gamblers posted grimly at the tables and the slot machines, the 
future lay in the instant. But for the nearly 300 comedians and entertainment 
industry reps who convened for the Second Annual American Comedy Convention, 
the gamble lay in the future itself. 
</P>
<P>
The event, organized by Budd Friedman (owner of the Improv) and his partner 
Eddie Kritzer (and underwritten by Seagram's Distillers and Laughtrack 
magazine), consisted of four days of seminars, showcases, demonstrations, 
ancillary parties and all-purpose general schmoozing in which comics, club 
owners, agents, managers, publicists and network casting directors sniffed over 
each other in a mating dance that could spawn fame and big bucks for the right 
connection. 
</P>
<P>
The comedians came from all over the country, from Venice Beach to New England. 
One came from Liberia. One came on a bicycle bearing all his belongings. One 
brought his partner, an English sheep dog named Winston. An improbable 
character named Gay Boy Ric (Ricardo Hunter Garcia), as lank and slender as a 
noodle and wearing plastic knee guards and carrying a huge red Crayon, spent 
his time passing out self-promotional materials (he never performed). There was 
one Nazi-style comic ("Take my vife, I command you!"). 
</P>
<P>
In another era most of the industry types would've viewed this pack of 
eccentrics with derision. But comedy holds the table right now in the ratings 
and revenues crap shoot. Look at "Ghostbusters" I and II. Look at Bill Cosby 
and Eddie Murphy, two of the wealthiest and most powerful figures in the 
entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
If everyone knows that it took Jay Leno 20 years to get to the top, everyone 
also knows (as was discussed in the convention) that Howie Mandel's sudden 
career launch began with an impromptu five-minute routine at the Comedy Store 
-- the first time he'd ever stepped before an American audience. 
</P>
<P>
The runaway success of the "Roseanne" show was uppermost in everyone's mind. 
Three years ago, Roseanne Barr was an overweight pot-walloping Hausfrau 
grinding through married life in a Denver trailer court and easing the slow 
skid into a dead-end existence with wisecracks, which she culled into a 
stand-up routine. 
</P>
<P>
Today she rules over the second-highest-rated show on television and shares the 
mysterious tabloid immortality accorded Elvis Presley and Elizabeth Taylor. You 
may think she can't act. You may think her smart mouth is no substitute for a 
real character. But she's up there in the megabuck ozone, the modern American 
pantheon where the rest of these visiting comedians would like to be -- and 
where handlers would like to offer them a leg up for a piece of the action. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'll find a comic here," said Shana Landsburg. "I know there'll be at 
least one person I can follow and send out for next pilot season." 
</P>
<P>
Landsburg, a wry woman in her early '30s, is manager of casting at NBC and one 
of three network casting directors who were on hand for the convention (the 
other two were Chris Gorman of CBS and ABC's Robin Nassif). 
</P>
<P>
"I think this convention accomplishes a real meshing of the entertainment 
community," she said. "I know this sounds naive, but things can change so 
quickly that all you really have to rely on is people you can trust, 
relationships you can build on. I'm optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
Budd Friedman hosted a keynote breakfast for club owners and comics, after 
which Jim McCawley, a former talent coordinator and now co-producer of NBC's 
"The Tonight Show," spoke on "Getting Ready for Late-Night TV." 
</P>
<P>
More than anything, six minutes in front of Johnny Carson and the nation 
represents the Big Shot for most aspiring comics, who can thereafter call for 
hefty club salaries and maneuver themselves closer to the ultimate payoff of 
movies and television. McCawley, the man behind the scene, the potential link, 
was therefore viewed with more than the usual curiosity, and he knew it. 
</P>
<P>
Out there, in the audience, were some people he may already have rejected, and 
people he was sure to hear from now with phone calls, written pleas, press 
packets, videotapes. Many of them wouldn't know how to present themselves, or 
weren't funny, or ready, or tasteful enough for Johnny, or were in stand-up for 
the wrong reasons. 
</P>
<P>
McCawley slouched at the lectern with the gloomy nervousness of a honky-tonk 
piano player who'd heard too many gunfights erupt behind his back. But he had 
some hard truths to impart, and in retrospect, during a week in which the term 
"art form" was freely tossed around, he was the only one to address the 
comedian as principally an artist. 
</P>
<P>
He spoke of comedy as a form of truth-telling. How do you find those truths? 
"If you have things that amuse you, things that are important and you like to 
tell your friends about, that's what should make up your material. You should 
ask yourself, 'Will this still be funny a thousand years from now?' Chances are 
it will be funny if it's true to the human condition. I still find Aristophanes 
funny." 
</P>
<P>
He deplored talking dirty as ". . . far too easy and not to Johnny's taste. 
It'll prevent you from getting to the top of your profession." He warned 
against using regionalisms, such as New York looking down on the South. He 
advised against talking to the audience: "Most of the time it's playing around 
and trying to get something, except in the case of Jimmy Brogan." He added 
pointedly, "If you showcase for me, don't spend a lot of time asking me 'Where 
you from?' " 
</P>
<P>
He told the audience that the "Tonight Show" introduced six new comedians each 
year, and that "the goal is to go through the roof, which makes it easier for 
your second appearance. By your third, you'll have two movies and a series." 
</P>
<P>
McCawley's was nearly the first address, and it turned out to be the most 
eloquent of the entire convention because it dealt with principle over the 
practical rigors of job-hunting. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole point is that the comedian sees the world through his own eyes with 
a vision that's a little skewed," he said. "The comedian's art is the shock of 
discovery. You'll begin to talk about something and at the end come up with 
something that isn't what the audience expected. But it seems right just the 
same, and it's yours." 
</P>
<P>
Someone asked him if America weren't on the verge of being "comedy'd out." 
"That's a philosophical question," he replied. "I do know that when I was 
growing up, folk-singing was big. Now . . . " he shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always comedy and tragedy. You don't see any tragedy clubs." 
</P>
<P>
He received a generous applause, to which Winston added his bark. 
</P>
<P>
In a seminar called "Casting at the Network Level," Landsburg, Gorman and 
Nassif introduced themselves briefly before opening up the floor to questions, 
which sometimes led to amusing and even contentious results. 
</P>
<P>
To the query "What do you wanna see on tape?" Landsburg replied, "I'd follow 
the Rob Lowe approach. If you have acting that's really good, I'd like to see 
it." 
</P>
<P>
"I wanna see whatever you're proud of," added Gorman, momentarily unaware that 
this ingenuous remark concealed a double entendre. The audience erupted in 
laughter. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid not to see a tape," he said, his face reddening. "A comic can 
happen so fast that he can come out of nowhere and be the talk of the town." 
</P>
<P>
"If they're a good comic, we'll push that," said Landsburg, referring to the 
talent she and her colleagues steer toward development teams, pilots, and 
network shows in search of new faces. "If it's dramatic acting, we'll push 
that. Sometimes it's just the presence of the personality that sells." 
</P>
<P>
"Is a character pigeonholed, like Roseanne," someone asked, "or do they get to 
play something else?" 
</P>
<P>
"Roseanne has a strong persona," Nassif replied. "Some people say she's not a 
good actor, but she's laughing all the way to the bank." 
</P>
<P>
"A character that's extreme can be a liability," Gorman said. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you put Bob Goldthwait in a series?" Nassif asked rhetorically. "He's 
such an extreme, a large personality." 
</P>
<P>
"You use sub-titles," Landsburg quipped. 
</P>
<P>
A young woman rose to say that a number of her female colleagues had been 
excluded from the upcoming showcase schedule. If she could get them together, 
would the casting people see them perform? "We'll see you," Landsburg said, 
looking at the others for confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
A young Southerner stood up to ask why NBC "took the cheap way out" in its 
casting of "The Heat of the Night" by not using Southerners in secondary roles. 
"Hey, that's NBC," Landsburg replied. "Most of the casting is done in Los 
Angeles. If Carroll O'Connor will show up week after week is a bigger issue 
than if the accents are real or fake. Don't print that!" she yelled at whatever 
press was in the room. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you wanna be real or fake?" the young man persisted. 
</P>
<P>
"Fake, OK?" she retorted angrily. "Is this to do with the comedy convention or 
is it a personal vendetta?" 
</P>
<P>
"Calm down," someone cried. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a Southern actor from Africa . . ." began another questioner. The audience 
laughed. "How do I develop?" he added, now serious. Learn scene study, cold 
reading. 
</P>
<P>
"Should we pay to see a casting person?" 
</P>
<P>
"No!" Nassif said sharply. "That person is the slime of the universe." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the same points on acting skill and preparation were made in the next 
seminar, "How to Go From Standup to Sitcom," in which TV directors John Bowab, 
Ellen Falcon and Howard Storm said that while it was important not to be 
intimidated by the system, it was also important to be ready. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want to go to that first meeting and have the word passed around, 
'Can't act,' " Bowab said. "Sometimes you can pay the price of one bad showcase 
for two or three years." (See adjacent story.) 
</P>
<P>
Later in the afternoon, the three-day showcase sessions began. Aside from 
career tips from seminar panelists, this is what the comedians were waiting for 
-- the chance to strut their stuff before industry pros and move themselves one 
step closer to the big time. It also gave the "buyers" -- the catch-all term 
for anyone in a position to sign up talent -- a chance to see what was going on 
in flyover country; that is, any of the dark terrain that rolled unseen beneath 
the New-York-to-Los-Angeles redeye. 
</P>
<P>
To showcase, a comic had to be a headliner somewhere, or else he had to be 
recommended by two club owners, or else he had to recommend himself to Friedman 
and Kritzer through a videotape. 
</P>
<P>
It was hard to believe that many, if not most, of these comedians could 
headline anywhere. One Southern comedian named Killer Beaz spent much of his 
act talking about tobacco chaws and spitting. Another comic opened with a line 
about what it felt like to sneeze into a tissue that someone else had sneezed 
in first. Said one comic: "Jackie O can take out a half dollar and say, 'Yeah, 
I slept with that guy.' How many women can say that?" 
</P>
<P>
Outside, Landsburg looked grim. "They're so much like actors -- just like 
children," she said. "It's all pee-pee jokes." 
</P>
<P>
Nine comedians performed in the afternoon session and 16 played that night, 
during which similar patterns of style, rhythm, subject matter and references 
quickly began to emerge. Sometimes you heard the same joke ("Honey, is my butt 
gettin' big?") from different comedians. There were a lot of jokes about being 
from the South ("You really make it with farm animals?" one comic said was a 
frequently asked question). 
</P>
<P>
Many had poise and physical assurance; few had memorable material, or an 
original point of view (the club scene has clearly become an insular 
sub-culture that feeds on itself). Some forgot where they were on stage and 
fumbled painfully through their routines. Others breezed through their 12 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Lahai Fahnbulleh, the Liberian, wore his dashiki and gold vai (his tribal hat) 
and said things like "I told the barber to give me a real African look. I woke 
up with a bone in my nose," and "We used to ship in rednecks from Alabama, but 
they were so bad we decided to do the work ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
"Just think what he could be talking about," moaned one observer. "What a world 
of contrasts he has at his fingertips, what a unique experience! And what does 
he do? He tells African Yakov Smirnoff jokes." 
</P>
<P>
"What's the story with Uncle Ben's converted Rice?" asked one comedian. "What 
was it converted from?" 
</P>
<P>
Friedman came on stage at 10 o'clock, read the room, smiled cleverly and said: 
"Relax, there are only 4,473 comedians to go." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Fahnbulleh owned up to the criticism. "I have tons and tons of material 
but my English is not where'd I'd like it to be," he said. "On stage, the words 
come slow. I'm beginning to see where I'm going. In time I'd like to highlight 
the politics of the Third World." Fahnbulleh, 33, is one of 27 children (his 
father has four wives) and came to America eight years ago as a student in 
Seattle, only to lose his green card. 
</P>
<P>
"Life is awful in Liberia right now," he said. "It's pretty much in a constant 
state of emergency where the government can be suspended at any time. I'm 
totally scared to go back; I could be killed. When I first came here and saw 
Johnny Carson talk about the president, I was scared for him. I ran into the 
bedroom to wake up my sister and said: 'You've gotta see this. He's talking 
about the president. They're gonna kill him!' My father-in-law came in and 
laughed." 
</P>
<P>
The day his green card was revoked was one of the lowest in his life. "I was 
devastated," he said. "I was walking along the street and this guy in a taxi 
pulled up and said, 'How come you so depressed? Do you know any jokes?' I knew 
one. 'At the age of 20, a woman is like Africa,' I said. 'Semi-explored. At the 
age of 30 she's like India. Warm, cool, mysterious. At 40, she's like America, 
technologically developed. At 50, she's like Europe, a ruin. At 60, she's like 
Siberia. Everybody knows where she is, but nobody wants to go.' " 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, the cab driver was a comedian who invited Fahnbulleh to try 
out at a local club. 
</P>
<P>
"The convention's been useful to me because there are no other Africans here, 
and it gives me a chance to show how we've been misrepresented by people like 
Eddie Murphy in 'Coming to America,' " he said. "Africa is not just gorillas 
and stupid people and savages. The words don't come easily to me yet, but one 
day I'll be able to talk about the hardships, the common ethnicity. My friends 
think I'm crazy, but if I make it, they'll be proud." 
</P>
<P>
The next day's seminars included career management, the booking of comedy clubs 
by the larger agencies, and comedy writing. Steve Allen was honored at the 
Comedy Legends lunch and performed wittily in return, an old pro still on his 
game. He received two standing ovations. "It ain't what you do, it's how you do 
it," he said later, in a TV interview. "Watch the reasonably successful people, 
watch how the masters do it. There's no such thing as an expert in every field 
of comedy. Some comedians can make you laugh, but it's like Chinese food. 
Someone like Benny could make you laugh, but you still smiled when you went out 
the door." 
</P>
<P>
"We need a 12-second answer," the TV interviewer said. Allen improvised. 
"You're such a pro," the interviewer said. 
</P>
<P>
Landsburg liked the first comedian in the afternoon showcase, a confident young 
man named Donald McEnery who said, "I'm thirtysomething, which means that every 
Tuesday night at 11, I cry," and "After 'Fatal Attraction,' if I slept with a 
woman, I killed her. That's my idea of safe sex." She liked a comedian named 
Chance Langton even more. A burly-looking Bostonian who is also an excellent 
guitarist, he played the crowd skillfully. "At five I fell in love with Shirley 
Temple," he said. "She danced, she sang, she turned me on. At six, I met her in 
a shopping mall. She was 50." 
</P>
<P>
The roster went downhill from there. "Relax," said a tall, very fat comic. 
"I've been fed." Said another comedian, "So do these Iranians know how to put 
on a funeral, or what?" Landsburg slumped over the table. "I miss Winston," she 
moaned. 
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, over dinner, she said: "In many ways this convention is better than 
last year's. Budd has arranged it so that the seminars don't conflict with the 
showcases. Overall, it does serve a good purpose. But," she added, "I am 
disappointed about the quality of the showcases. The material has been very 
pedestrian." 
</P>
<P>
She spoke of one comic who had a good look but stumbled at the beginning of his 
act and lost control; and of another: "He's overweight and saying 'How schlumpy 
and fat can I make myself look.' McEnery has fresh material and a good vocal 
quality. I could see him as a best friend or a crazy ad exec. He knew how to 
dress, which is important. A lot of comics don't know how to present 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Landsburg is somewhat skeptical of the TV star system, which can be even more 
treacherous than movie stardom; television is more closely associated with the 
notion of brand identification. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a problem when I hear people say 'I want somebody to be a star.' We 
want somebody to be successful -- absolutely. But you have to realize that 
acting is an art. You don't have to be a star to be an actor. Sometimes being a 
star means you don't work after a show runs its course or is cancelled." 
</P>
<P>
Although she specializes in comedy, she thinks the run on comedians is bound to 
slow down. "It's cyclical," she said. "I think the comedy high is gonna fall. 
At some point there's gonna be something else. If the comedian thinks he can 
just automatically move over to sitcoms, that isn't gonna happen. A lot of 
people knock the quality of TV, but it's what America accepts and there's a lot 
of money in it. That's another reason I respond to a guy like Langton. He's 
taking a chance. He's not a leading man, not a Jewish type. His humor is 
esoteric. He talks about people. He gives you something to relate to, instead 
of telling a bunch of jokes on flipping people off. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no wonder there are so many people trying to do stand-up now. There's so 
much crap out there you say, 'If they can do that, so can I.' What works for me 
is humor that gets me on an emotional level, the thing that makes you say, 'Oh 
yeah, I've been there.' " 
</P>
<P>
The convention began winding down on the fourth day, in which a seminar on 
Agents and Your Career was held in the morning, and publicists Michael Levine 
and Glenn Schwartz, through phrases such as "In the '40s the medium was the 
movies; now the medium is the media" and "It's still all about image" 
established a self-importance about their roles even more egregious than the 
self-congratulation that characterized many of the earlier panelists. 
</P>
<P>
It would have been of great interest to entertainment news editors to learn, 
for example, that Schwartz and Levine consider the majority of them lazy and 
dependent on publicists for story ideas. "Remember, it's not called show art," 
said Levine in a telling epilogue to the series of addresses idealistically 
begun by Jim McCawley. "It's show business." He added: "Information is power. 
You could help yourself more by reading." Reading what? "More books on public 
relations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Landsburg checked out the last batch of comedians before getting ready to drive 
back to Los Angeles (in the greatest put-on of the showcase, the Nazi turned 
out to be an impeccably stylish comic from Long Island named Jim Myers). She'd 
gone to the private women's showcase, held in a hotel room, and left after the 
first act. 
</P>
<P>
"I always had a problem with the fact that all the women weren't allowed to 
perform," she said. In other words, women were excluding women. "But that's not 
the only reason I left. The first woman I saw was too obvious; she had no 
material. She'd given up a career as a psychotherapist and she was too much, 
wearing a little party dress and too much makeup. It was sad. I saw that that's 
what this showcase was about -- women pushing." 
</P>
<P>
She shook her head. She acknowledged that the convention served a good purpose 
(a unanimous opinion of everyone asked on the subject). But: "I don't believe 
in actors having to showcase. They pay transportation, room, food. I try to be 
supportive. Some will make it. A lot more won't. I have a problem with people 
having to pay to audition. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there should be more of an effort on the part of the industry too. Or 
else we should move the convention to Los Angeles. It's hard to get producers 
and writers to take four days out of their week to go to Las Vegas. I'm 
energized by the people I've met, and there are a few people I'm excited to 
bring to NBC. But the greatest need of the majority of these comedians is to 
look at their material and be clear about what character they are on stage." 
</P>
<P>
That evening the Fox Television Network hosted a 90-minute gala dinner and 
comedy show at the Skytop Room of the Riviera Hotel. Landsburg had already 
packed and was long since gone on her way. She had seen as much has she needed

<P>
The power a standup comedian possesses is a luxury most people only dream 
about. Apparently so do many of the comics who attended the Second Annual 
Comedy Convention. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine being the star of your own one-act play in which the subject is your 
life and experience. Nobody else's thumb gets in your autobiographical 
manuscript. Your story isn't strewn on a cutting room floor. 
</P>
<P>
You hold center stage and an audience's attention for as long as you want. You 
share your brightest observations. Your opinions go uncontested. You vent your 
hostilities and air your perplexities. Think of the pleasure you get when you 
can make another person laugh and multiply it by 100, or 300, or 2000, or a 
national TV audience of millions. 
</P>
<P>
That's power money can't buy. And if one of your jokes zips 
</P>
<P>
through the collective psyche of the culture, you've made a bit of history a 
regiment of flacks couldn't concoct for you. That's power too. 
</P>
<P>
It was surprising and saddening then to discover that few of the comedians who 
showed up at the Second Annual Comedy Convention saw standup that way, or 
seemed to realize that standup comedy and acting are two radically different 
disciplines. 
</P>
<P>
All those mall jokes and airline jokes and Southern Goober jokes, all the 
standardized patter and kiddie dirt, showed us where the comedy zeitgeist was 
plugged in. Judging by the interest and the nature of the questions the comics 
posed to the seminar panelists, finding a marketable context for 
self-expression and one's point-of-view wasn't the goal; getting a part in a 
sitcom was. 
</P>
<P>
That's understandable of course, as the audience was reminded of how profitably 
TV and the movies have stood on the efforts of Bill Cosby, Bob Newhart, Billy 
Crystal, Robin Williams, Michael Keaton, numerous Second City and "Saturday 
Night Live" alumni, and most recently, Roseanne Barr and Richard Lewis. And 
that's not to mention how much earlier television, and radio, benefited from a 
score of vaudeville-trained talents, such as Fred Allen and Jack Benny. And 
there are some talents, such as George Burns, Jonathan Winters and Bob Hope, 
who've transcended decades of change. 
</P>
<P>
The convention's casting and sitcom directors were quick to point out that the 
comedian's personality, and his (or her) ability to control an audience were 
distinct advantages in those likability quotients whose official existence 
everyone denies. Lost in the rush to be the new Roseanne, that is, to have a 
show dropped around you like a tent, was the cautionary note of ABC-TV's Robin 
Nassif: "An actor will usually get chosen over a comedian." 
</P>
<P>
Various panelists disagreed on how much training a comedian needs (TV director 
Howard Storm said that some people shouldn't study at all: "If Woody Allen had 
studied acting, he wouldn't have done things his way"). Some suggested that 
knowledge of scene-study and cold-reading techniques might be enough. One thing 
was certain; if a comedian bombs onstage, he can come back the next night (or 
even drive to another club). But if he bombs at a casting audition, it may be 
years before he'll be seen again. 
</P>
<P>
John Bowab was the most emphatic about preparation, perhaps because he comes 
from a theater background. (He was associate producer of "Mame" and "Sweet 
Charity" on Broadway, and has worked with Morton DaCosta, Cyril Ritchard, 
George Abbott, Gene Saks and Bob Fosse. He's director of the production of "The 
Unsinkable Molly Brown," with Debbi Reynolds and Harvey Presnell, which is 
currently on tour.) He's directed numerous sitcoms, including episodes of 
"Soap," "Benson," "It's a Living" and "The Facts of Life," among others. 
</P>
<P>
In the seminar "From Standup to Sitcom" he despaired of "the comic who wants to 
act but can't use his body" by way of recommending dancing, fencing, karate -- 
anything that lured the performer away from the false security of playing it 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
Later, after the convention was over, he said, "If someone says 'I want to be 
an actor,' or 'I want to be a comic actor,' I have no problem with that. But if 
someone says, 'I want a sitcom,' they're looking at acting as a quick way to 
fame and fortune. Even if they get a sitcom, they're looking at a short career. 
It should not be the end of ambition. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm concerned that standup is becoming 
</P>
<P>
diminished," he added. "It is an art form, the most challenging thing you can 
do. I think that performers who look at it just as a stepping stone are failing 
themselves. But if acting is going to be the choice, you have to understand 
that there is no short route, even though everything today seems capsulized and 
most people think there is. You have to learn how to learn, how to enlarge your 
technical ability and your ability to communicate." 
</P>
<P>
Bowab understands the impulse to jump from standup comedy to sitcoms as a 
career move. "The competition is fierce; if 40 million people see you on 
television, it certainly means a lot when you face future audiences in the 
clubs." Also, "Newhart and Cosby have done phenomenally well in sitcoms because 
both were able to play characters not far from themselves. The same with 
Roseanne." 
</P>
<P>
But he's unsympathetic to the comedian's lament that too much time is spent on 
the road, and that a sitcom part represents the easy way out. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't you think theater people go through the same thing?" he said. "I know 
people who've been in the theater 30 years and are still on the road a lot. 
It's a lonely life too, where you can be out for a year or a year and a half, 
where your life is the plane, the city, the theater, the hotel." 
</P>
<P>
Noting that Billy Crystal is a theater devotee, and that Robin Williams was a 
Juilliard student, Bowab added, "I say, 'Don't let a day go by without doing 
something. If all you do is wait for an 11 o'clock spot at the Improv, you 
won't make it." Even if one does get lucky, "once you've been chewed up and 
spit out of a sitcom, you're not necessarily going to get another one next 
season. And if you haven't developed as an actor, where are you?"

CHINA IN SEARCH OF ITS FUTURE;

<P>
YEARS OF GREAT REFORM 1982-87 BY JOHN WOODRUFF (UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON PRESS: 
$19.95; 218 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jay Mathews, Mathews, co-author with Linda Mathews of One Billion: A China 
Chronicle, served as the Washington Post's Beijing bureau chief in 1979 and 
1980 and covered the recent pro-democracy uprising in China. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pity John Woodruff, China book author. After five years combing the People's 
Republic for insights and anecdotes, after a year putting his thoughts and 
notes together into a coherent whole, after waiting patiently through copy 
editing and galleys, he finds his book coming out in the middle of one of the 
great crunch points of modern Chinese history, when student uprisings and army 
massacres place in doubt many of the assumptions of the period he had so 
carefully described. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, this book has much to offer, thanks largely to Woodruff's 
comprehensive knowledge of China, sense of balance and -- most uncharacteristic 
of China book authors -- modesty about what can and cannot be said about a 
country in painful transition. For Americans who have not paid attention to the 
Chinese drama until recently -- a group that includes about 99% of the reading 
public -- this is a timely background briefing, a welcome addition to the 
stream of daily bulletins and headlines that have too little time and space to 
give anyone a history lesson. 
</P>
<P>
White House advisers ought to tear out the book's last two chapters, "Students 
in the Streets" and "Will China Make It?," and stick them in their boss' 
weekend reading file the next time he goes off to Kennebunkport. In the chapter 
on students, we see the uncertain beginnings in 1986 of the movement that 
turned Tian An Men Square into a remarkable encampment for freedom and 
democracy, words whose vague meaning for Chinese is well analyzed here. 
</P>
<P>
Woodruff describes the students' first use of "The Internationale," of all 
things, as an anti-government protest song. He traces the beginnings of large 
student demonstrations to some semi-official protests of Japanese foreign 
policy and to a few hundred Shanghai undergraduates who felt classmates had 
been manhandled by police at a concert given by the aged surf rock duo, Jan and 
Dean. In an intriguing clue to the spirit that erupted at Tian An Men, Woodruff 
finds young Chinese engaged in "a search for identity or a sense of place or 
belonging . . . in a society that has rejected both its old certainties and its 
new, and has replaced them mainly with a drive for national prosperity." 
</P>
<P>
In the final chapter and in a brief epilogue written last December, Woodruff 
uses just the right term -- "control-minded" -- to describe the Chinese 
leadership that unleashed an ill-trained, paranoid army on the students. There 
is no better explanation for the root of the violent response to what most 
Western leaders would have considered an annoyance to be handled by local 
police, hardly something worth even canceling a vacation for. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the book provides a helpful review of the reforms of the Deng 
Xiaoping era as they affect consumers, peasants, workers, women and the 
Communist Party. Woodruff avoids leaping to conclusions from the bizarre 
byproducts of loosened restraint, such as female body building and punk 
haircuts. 
</P>
<P>
His last chapter includes an astute disclaimer that should probably be 
memorized by all China correspondents, past and present, and particularly by 
people like me who suffered severe emotional and intellectual whiplash from 
returning to Beijing in the heady days of May and then witnessing the 
terrifying, heart-breaking events of June 4 at Tian An Men: 
</P>
<P>
"Foreign commentators have been writing for nearly one hundred years that China 
has been standing poised to join the modern world, and that the next few years 
would see China burst upon the world scene as a major economic and political 
force. These enthusiasms of foreigners have accompanied events as long ago as 
the abortive reforms of the late 19th Century, the fall of the Qing Dynasty in 
1911, the victories of the Nationalist armies in the 1920s, and the rise to 
power of Mao's Red Army in 1949. Some of the voices that have participated in 
these enthusiasms have belonged to figures of far grander reputation than my 
own, but I am little inclined to join this distinguished company." 
</P>
<P>
Woodruff, who served from 1982 to 1987 as Beijing bureau chief of The Baltimore 
Sun, confesses at the very beginning that this is a journalist's book, "one 
reporter's attempt to describe and to comment upon what he saw of a unique 
moment in time." He takes care to disguise his Chinese sources and notes those 
moments he relied upon the observations of other reporters, but there is a 
depth and assurance to his reporting that may derive from the unusually long 
time he has been watching China -- beginning in Hong Kong in 1970 -- and the 
Asian studies he has pursued at both the University of Michigan and the School 
of Advanced International Studies of Johns Hopkins University. 
</P>
<P>
Knowing what we know now, Woodruff's cautious final conclusion strikes just the 
right note: "My sense is that the rapid and dramatic changes I saw are indeed 
potentially historic, but that the key word in the sentence may yet prove to be 
'potentially.' It still seems too soon to feel certain that the Deng Xiaoping 
years will prove, in retrospect, to have been more than the greatest in a long 
line of ambitious starts."

THREE EXPRESSIONS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S PASSION FOR REMODELING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIRGINIA GRAY, Virginia Gray is an associate editor of the Los Angeles Times 
Magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FROM THE STREET, this 1920s-vintage house looks much the same as it always has. 
But step around to the back and the dramatic change is apparent: A two-story 
addition, in contemporary Craftsman style, expands the house with 2,000 square 
feet of much-needed living space. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne and Lana Selness bought this house in the Hancock Park section of Los 
Angeles despite the fact that it needed remodeling. They were attracted to its 
character -- the central hallway, decorative plaster moldings, spacious 
upstairs bedrooms. But the kitchen was small and outdated, there was no family 
room, and the couple wanted a larger master bedroom and bath. 
</P>
<P>
Brentwood designer Nick Berman, with the assistance of associate designer Cory 
Buckner, reworked the existing rooms and expanded the four-bedroom, 2 1/2-bath 
home to include five bedrooms and 4 1/2 baths. 
</P>
<P>
"What I did is redefine the proportions and the scale of things. I opened rooms 
up and let light shine in," Berman says. "Homes from this era tend to be dark 
and rather confined on the interior. Though the new rooms have a contemporary 
feel, they're detailed in a classic sense so that they adhere to the character 
of such an old house." 
</P>
<P>
On the first floor, the new family room, kitchen and banquette open onto the 
back yard and pool. Although visible and accessible from the family room, the 
modern kitchen is divided by a long granite-top counter and cabinets enclosed 
with clear and ribbed glass. A banquette, located in a rounded bay, echoes the 
bay in the new master suite directly above it. 
</P>
<P>
Materials are elegant yet simple. Grid patterns are repeated in glass block 
walls, windows and doors. "The colors -- pale, soft blues, pinks and yellows on 
the walls and ceilings -- are a counterpoint to the crispness of the shiny 
white trim and moldings. During different times of the day, the light 
reflecting off the colors creates subtly different moods," Berman explains. 
</P>
<P>
Berman designed many of the tables and sofas. Other furniture is a mix of 
classics by Donghia and modern chairs by Philippe Starck. Fabrics in the family 
room are in soft colors; in the living room, they're dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
"Nick always seemed to understand what we wanted, and his interpretation of 
that really works for us and this house," Lana Selness says. "From the outside, 
our house remains appropriate for this older neighborhood. Inside, it now has 
the ideal balance of old and new." 
</P>
<P>
A Dark '50s Bungalow Opens Up to Airy '80s Style 
</P>
<P>
When architect Kaye Secomb and her husband, David Spetner, found this 
three-bedroom, two-bath home in the Los Feliz area, they called it "the house 
nobody wanted." But Secomb and Spetner saw potential in the bungalow's small, 
dark rooms and outdated '50s styling. 
</P>
<P>
After two months of remodeling, the house had an entirely new look. Secomb 
didn't change the house's basic layout, but she reworked its flow of space and 
she added skylights, larger windows and French doors to give it a bright, sunny 
ambience. Japanese, tropical and contemporary interior-design touches create 
what she jokingly calls an Ethno-Deco look. 
</P>
<P>
Secomb, a native of Australia, wanted to connect her house to the outdoors, so 
she installed French doors in the kitchen and den / office that open onto a 
sunny terrace. French doors in the master bedroom lead to a rear patio. 
</P>
<P>
In the kitchen, Secomb removed all the upper cabinets and installed windows 
along an entire wall. "My kitchen is modeled after an open-air kitchen in Bali 
-- my favorite kitchen in the world," Secomb says. "I tried to give it a 
similar feel -- sunny, open, casual. 
</P>
<P>
"I've used very little color in the interior of this house," she says. "I've 
ended up with a lot of black-and-white furniture. Art, flowers and people's 
clothing provide the color. 
</P>
<P>
"David and I have discussed a formula that describes what we've done here," she 
continues. "We've taken a house from the '50s, added some touches from the '30s 
and come up with something that suits the 1980s." 
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Influences Enliven a Simple Spanish Cottage 
</P>
<P>
Bands of color encircle the wood-frame windows and front door. The rustic-pine 
door, a Mexican import, is finished with a sunny yellow wood stain. Even before 
you cross the threshold, it is apparent that this house is owned by someone who 
is not afraid to express herself. 
</P>
<P>
Claudia Grau, who designs and sells contemporary sportswear at the Melrose 
Avenue boutique that bears her name, bought this Spanish-style two-bedroom, 
one-bath house in West Hollywood last year. "It was the only one I liked and 
could afford," she explains. 
</P>
<P>
After a contractor completed the major work -- repairing the foundation, 
removing the wall between the dining room and kitchen, adding a large window in 
the second bedroom and remodeling the bathroom -- Grau hired a friend, designer 
/ artist Paul Glynn, to help add decorative touches. 
</P>
<P>
Glynn, who owned the innovative but now-defunct Melrose boutique, Cowboys &amp; 
Poodles, fashioned the front fence, the frames around the doors and windows, 
kitchen cabinets and breakfast-room chairs. 
</P>
<P>
Glynn gilded Grau's bathroom medicine chest and painted the natural-looking 
artificial rocks in the living-room fireplace. Glynn also installed a 
cracked-tile back splash in Grau's kitchen above the granite counters. 
</P>
<P>
After construction, there was not much money left for decorating, but Grau was 
able to pare costs by buying some of her new furnishings (such as her 
metal-frame furniture and the front door) in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"The bold color combinations used in and on Mexican and Central American homes 
are so positive and upbeat," she says. "I wanted to bring some of these same 
qualities to my home."

<P>
TALKING GOD BY TONY HILLERMAN (HARPER &amp; ROW: $17.95; 288 PP.; 006-016118-3) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Orlando A. Romero, Romero, a novelist, is research librarian for the History 
Library of the Museum of New Mexico and columnist for the Santa Fe Reporter. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tony Hillerman's new novel takes the reader through a crescendo of characters, 
locations, plots and subplots. Hillerman manipulates his reader to the hilt. It 
wouldn't be a Hillerman mystery otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
The plot is centered around Yeibachai, the great Talking God of Navajo night 
chant ceremonial. The author's ability to relate with great detail the Navajo 
mythology surrounding the ceremonial adds a dimension that his fans expect. 
First-time readers will discover that he has set the stage for the introduction 
of two Navajo cops, each from a different police agency. 
</P>
<P>
Reunited to solve the mystery of a dead foreign terrorist found in New Mexico, 
they find themselves embroiled in a conflict over valuable ancient ceremonial 
masks, the return of about 18,000 Native American remains held at the 
Smithsonian, and the introduction of a reborn Indian named Highhawk, who is the 
Smithsonian conservator in charge of an ambitious exhibit called "The Masked 
Gods of the Americas." 
</P>
<P>
Highhawk's deep love of Navajo culture, his connections to terrorists, his work 
at the Smithsonian, his attendance and recording of the night chant ceremonial 
and his arrest for digging up a historically prominent New England couple to 
challenge the Smithsonian's retention of Native American skeletons add further 
complexity to the plot. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Pete, a Navajo turned Washington lawyer, takes on Highhawk's defense. 
When Jim Chee, one of the two Navajo cops, arrives in Washington, Janet 
confides in him that she believes she is being followed. Fleck, the unsavory 
character following her, turns out to be connected to a larger evil. 
</P>
<P>
Hillerman left me very uncomfortable with the development of this heavy. At 
first, I sympathized: a product of the so-called justice system, I thought; an 
assassin by circumstance rather than by choice. But the introduction of his 
"Mama," a deranged character maintained in a nursing home by Fleck's earnings 
from his "profession," is gratuitously confusing. 
</P>
<P>
While Chee of the Navajo Tribal Police is trying to figure out Fleck, Lt. Joe 
Leaphorn is trying to discover the identity of the toothless corpse found in 
New Mexico. I wasn't sure Hillerman could draw these two cops together, 
especially in an environment as foreign to them as D.C., but he pulls it off 
very smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
Hillerman is also very clever at describing the predicament of the modern 
Pueblo Indian and turning it into a minor plot to distract us from the real 
villains. The return of one of the Tano Twin War Gods may get a young Pueblo 
official elected and thus assure a right-of- way on Pueblo Indian land, further 
increasing the value of land being developed by Sunbelt Corp. Traditionalists, 
of course, are opposed. Out here in Pueblo Land, the issue of Indian 
development is quite a serious matter, so for a while the reader is led to 
believe that plain old land development greed is somehow connected to the 
corpse in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
Hillerman also spins off little intellectual diversions to see if his fans are 
paying attention to the plot. These passages read like little tests to see how 
much the reader knows about the Southwest. When our toothless terrorist's 
baggage contents are examined, a few pieces of Indian pottery are wrapped in a 
Spanish language newspaper entitled El Crespusculo de la Libertad, The Dawn of 
Liberty. Any serious student of the Southwest would immediately know that this 
is one of the rarest newspapers ever published in the Southwest, one for which 
a collector might literally kill. Then, as the plots develop, the fact that the 
newspaper is in Spanish ends up being its only connection with the stiff. 
</P>
<P>
Hillerman's great skill is in throwing out possible scenarios while hiding 
motive in a complex web of myth, exotic characters and remote places. One of 
America's best storytellers, he gives new meaning to the label mystery writer. 
His inspiration is the Southwest and its people, but his ability as a 
storyteller has no limits. Another golden star for Tony Hillerman has just 
crossed his sky.

THE POLAR CONQUEST OF LOVE;

When I was little more than a child my imagination was caught by a book called 
"Alone," written by Adm. Richard E. Byrd. Published in 1938, it's the 
reflective and ultimately spiritual journal Byrd kept during a solo expedition 
to gather meteorological data in the region of the South Pole. 
</P>
<P>
For five months, Byrd lived alone in a shack sunk in the ice with temperatures 
reaching minus 50 and 60 degrees. Each day he emerged through a trap door to 
read his instruments above ground, also noting the look of things in the polar 
winter ("storm-blue bulge of darkness . . .") he was experiencing, and in which 
he almost perished. He came to believe that "such beauty was reserved for 
distant and dangerous places" which "extract a price from those who would 
witness it." 
</P>
<P>
Two or three writers since have succeeded in conjuring up that polar beauty for 
me again -- Ursula K. Le Guin in a brilliant story called "Sur," and Doris 
Lessing in the fourth of the "Canopus in Argos" books, "The Making of a 
Representative for Planet 8." Now I would add S. L. Stebel's evocatively 
ice-bound novel, a book of winning beauty and mythology, "Spring Thaw," which 
is set on a ship near an island in the region of the North Pole. 
</P>
<P>
The story revolves around an expedition of seal hunters, who set out in a ship 
called the Seljegeren for the annual harvest of seal pelts. The Seljegeren's 
old captain is ailing and his son, Jason, from whom he is estranged, assumes 
command of the ship. The sailor-hunters are anxious for the kill, their annual 
livelihood depends on it, and already, other ships are taking up the best 
waters. During a fierce storm at sea, Jason stumbles across an old chart in his 
father's cabin, and against the advice of the more experienced of his crew, 
heads for a cluster of islands called the Mirabelles, where a quick and 
bountiful harvest is hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
The ship anchors off the Mirabelles, ice encroaching and threatening to freeze 
it in place. A sullen, defeated population greets them hastily, dark and heavy 
villagers slogging across the ice like medieval Grendels wary of the stranger 
in the mead hall, a broken people who no longer even hunt their own abundant 
seals. Some force seems to protect the seals from being killed, as the crew of 
the Seljegeren discover when they attempt a slaughter and meet with 
inexplicable accidents. 
</P>
<P>
This is no medieval tale however. We are meant to understand that Jason has 
witnessed the bombing of a marine base in Lebanon ("We lifted what was left of 
once able-bodied men . . . our hands sticky with substances the mind would not 
contemplate . . ."), an experience so psychologically destabilizing that he has 
been relieved of command in the Navy. Is the destructive, malevolent force he 
encounters in the Mirabelles the psychological residue of modern war, or a 
"spiritual visitation . . . the creation of shame-ridden mind" in an 
ecologically unbalanced world? 
</P>
<P>
In time Jason discovers the truth, which is that the force protecting the seals 
is a spirit-woman whom Jason's father had wronged many years ago, and with whom 
he engages in a somnambulistic hearth-side fever-love. Now he asks: Is he his 
father's rival, a self-deluded fool, or the inheritor of a family curse? 
</P>
<P>
By the time the reader comes to the final father-son confrontation scene, 
Jason, like the seeker of the Golden Fleece, has made heroic discoveries 
through trial and confrontation, in a story with very modern overtones. "Spring 
Thaw" is immensely enjoyable, a book with considerably more going for it than 
its evocation of ice-bound wonder, but for this alone, I was rather grateful.

PRIVATE LIVES: SHADES OF STATUS; 
</P>
<P>
SUNGLASSES THAT MAKE A FASHION STATEMENT CAN WREAK HAVOC ON ONE'S FINANCIAL 
STATEMENT 
</P>

"NICE SUNGLASSES," sneers my ex-husband Richard. "All you need is a cupful of 
pencils." This is what you get for buying $3 shades on the Venice boardwalk, 
chides an inner voice. "Get a decent pair," orders Richard, who is wearing $100 
Serengeti ("like the African plain") Drivers. "You look ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
I generally hate to admit that my ex-husband is right. Besides, I'm not one of 
these people who thinks that sunglasses are a fashion statement. I don't like 
glasses. The happiest day of my life was the day I got contact lenses. Of 
course, I only wear sunglasses for utilitarian reasons: My contacts get 
scratchy when I'm in the sun. But everyone else seems to have gone sunglass 
crazy. 
</P>
<P>
"I love my Ray-Bans," exclaims the woman sitting next to me at the beauty 
salon. What's to love? I wonder. Ms. Blond Highlights caresses her Dark Metal 
III's. "They're my alter ego," she reveals. "I put them on and I'm tough." 
</P>
<P>
Some people think a pair of dark glasses can define you, like your blood type. 
I don't understand it, though in a way I'm not surprised. First it was real 
estate. Then real estate got too expensive. Next it was cars. Then cars got too 
expensive. So now it's sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got two pairs," my hairdresser Carole says fondly, as if she's talking 
about her children. "One's collegiate, my Anne Klein's. And then I've got my 
'killer' sunglasses, my L.A. Eyeworks. The ones I spent $200 on." 
</P>
<P>
For $200 I could fly to Hawaii. But Carole maintains that her sunglasses also 
provide an escape from reality. "They have aluminum frames and mirrored 
lenses," she explains. "I wear them when I want to create an attitude without 
having to get into it. My sunglasses make me unapproachable. People leave me 
alone." 
</P>
<P>
Sure they leave her alone. There's nothing more annoying than trying to have a 
conversation with a person hiding behind mirrored sunglasses (which they rarely 
if ever remove). Not only can't you make eye contact, which means flirting is 
out of the question, but you keep noticing that your hair looks funny and your 
makeup is smudged. "Cheap sunglasses won't protect your eyes from the damaging 
invisible rays," Carole warns me. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Cheap on the Venice boardwalk has this angle covered. He's put enormous 
Ultra-Violet Protected stickers on his entire line of Nok-Offs. "Those lenses 
are terrible," argues Judit Putter, the owner of Snooty Fox Eyewear. What else 
would she say when she's selling $900 Cartier sunglasses made of 22-karat gold? 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing people notice about you is your face," says Putter, a licensed 
optician in Santa Monica who has just fit a 1-year-old client with $290 
Mikli's. "You can wear the greatest clothes in the world, but you'll make a 
rotten impression if your glasses are wrong." I begin to panic. 
</P>
<P>
Even my own sister is sunglass obsessed. "I wouldn't wear cheap sunglasses," 
says Laurie, who regards her $100 Vuarnet's as an alternative form of jewelry. 
"They always hurt your nose more, or they're not as well made. And you can 
never lose them." This is true. You can throw a pair of cheap sunglasses out of 
the car window in Tijuana and they'll walk home to L.A. -- like Lassie. Cheap 
sunglasses will even dig themselves out from under the sofa cushions. 
</P>
<P>
But expensive sunglasses disappear before your check clears. "I had these great 
white Emmanuelle Khanh's with brownish tinted lenses," my friend Lynne recalls, 
hastily explaining that this was back when Khanh's were in. "I adored them," 
she says. "Then I went horseback riding and the instructor decided to teach us 
to trot. My glasses went flying off my face and bounced down a canyon. I 
seriously gave thought to going after them. I lost my company I.D. card, too, 
but I didn't care at all about that." 
</P>
<P>
Lynne is a self-described sunglasses addict. "I believe in total coordination," 
she says, adding that she once bought a pair of hand-painted frames to match 
her car. "I've got at least 20 pairs." She used to have 21 pairs, but recently 
she was robbed. "They stole my Mikli's," Lynne complains. "They passed over all 
the others and went for my gray granite Mikli's." 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to keep them on a leash," says Putter, the optician. "I've heard 
every horror story in the world. Customers set their Porsche Carrera's on the 
table and the busboy steals them. I've known people who had their car windows 
smashed to get a pair of Persol's left on the dashboard. Everyone wants hot 
sunglasses." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone, I think smugly. But a few weeks later, the temple of my inferior 
shades breaks. I'm in Mexico, on a glass-bottom boat surrounded by 10 sunburned 
noses supporting $2,000 worth of designer frames. To make matters worse, the 
ocean is murky, so there's nothing for anyone to stare at but the paper clip 
that is now holding together my glasses. 
</P>
<P>
I can't stand the shame. As soon as I get back to Los Angeles, I hurry to the 
nearest eye-fashion salon. After trying on everything from buffalo horn to 
sterling silver, I sheepishly choose a pair of faux tortoise frames, which, the 
salesperson assures me, I can wear with "almost anything." I can't tell you how 
much they cost. I can't even tell my husband. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he notices. 
</P>
<P>
"Nice sunglasses," Duke says when I return home. "Do we need a rider for our 
insurance policy?"

GARDENS: POINTS OF INTEREST;

<P>
IN THIS CLASSIC FORMAL GARDEN, STATUES AND FOUNTAINS LURE VISITORS EVER FARTHER 
INTO THE LANDSCAPE

ROUNDING A corner on a certain stretch of Beverly Hills' Sunset Boulevard, 
motorists can't help but be surprised at the audacity of the nicely dressed 
couple trying to get a view of what is beyond a high stucco wall. They are 
statues, of course, by Stuart Johnson, as are the wall's tireless painters and 
the security guard by the gate. 
</P>
<P>
But what is on the other side? A private residence with a garden that is as 
classically formal as the statues on the street are modern. Statues are an 
important part of the inner garden as well, but all within are antique, 
purchased in Italy by the estate's owners. To a large extent, the landscape 
architects, Galper / Baldon Associates, designed the garden around them. 
"Remnants of an older formal plan" on the old estate, Cleo Baldon says, served 
as the inspiration. Formal gardens such as this one are walking gardens, 
designed for people to move through. The paths are straight and neat, and 
objects such as fountains and statues are placed in the distance and along the 
way to lure visitors ever farther into the landscape. 
</P>
<P>
The most puzzling aspect of the redesign of this garden was to provide safe 
access off a blind corner on Sunset. What Baldon calls an off-ramp feeds into a 
sharply angled drive, which then leads to a small formal garden surrounding an 
antique fountain. Broken concrete is the paving material, with dichondra 
between the cracks to break up the monotony. The beds here are the most 
colorful in the garden, filled during cold weather with tulips and 
winter-spring flowers. When the jacaranda trees come into flower in early 
summer, the beds are changed to marigolds and ageratum, which landscape 
architect Alan Fleischacker of Galper/Baldon, who has been in charge of this 
ongoing project for the last several years, specified to mimic the color of the 
jacaranda blossoms overhead. From the side windows of the living room, there is 
a perfect view of the fountain, which serves as a distraction from the bustle 
of the busy street beyond the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Walking through an arched passageway in a wall on the other side of the 
fountain brings one to a formal rose garden off the mansion's terrace. Another 
path runs a mighty distance between trees and spectacular Phoenix canariensis 
palms, some of them remnants of the earlier garden. The view from there is as 
straight as an arrow. Far in the distance is yet another antique figure that 
draws you into the garden to investigate. Little statues stand all along the 
way; another fountain marks the halfway point. 
</P>
<P>
Near the end of the walk is the swimming pool. It is centered on the path as if 
it were a reflecting pond. Just beyond it is a spa, disguised as yet another 
small fountain. The classic beauty standing over the spa, another statue 
protected by an arbor and only dimly visible from the house, is the reward at 
the end of this garden walk. 
</P>

is a classic formal garden. The driveway, above, surrounds an antique fountain.

FASHION: THE KYMIO EQUATION; 
</P>
<P>
KIM DAM'S SIGNATURE STYLE IS ONE PART CONTEMPORARY, ONE PART CLASSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIE MONEYSMITH, Marie Moneysmith is a Los Angeles-based writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIM DAM DISPROVES THE theory that a fashion designer can succeed on creativity 
alone. The tiny Vietnamese-born designer darts about her downtown office like a 
hummingbird, solving a problem here, answering a question there, keeping things 
moving. Dam knows that talent is not all that rare. She credits her 
achievements to discipline, attention to detail, perse verance and commitment. 
</P>
<P>
Dam clears a spot on her work table, pushing aside a bolt of turf-green fabric 
and the remains of a lunch that has been cold for hours. As she settles into a 
well-worn chair, her harried countenance is replaced by an intensely focused 
energy that helps explain how the 32-year-old designer has accomplished in a 
few years what usually takes much longer. "I can't stay home and do nothing," 
she says simply. "I like to work." 
</P>
<P>
To Dam, work is a synonym for success. Sales for Dam's 4-year-old company, 
Kymio, a name she made up, climbed past $7 million in 1988, and this year looks 
even stronger. 
</P>
<P>
Her Ba-Tzu boutique (another made-up name) at the Beverly Center is thriving, 
too, with annual sales of more than $1 million. In spite of these impressive 
figures, Dam says her goal is slow growth. "I don't want to grow really fast," 
she says, "because then you go down really fast." 
</P>
<P>
These days, though, Dam doesn't have to worry about the downside. Her designs 
are turning up on the pages of top fashion magazines as well as at Nordstrom, 
Bullock's and Neiman Marcus. The hallmark of a Kymio design is unusual 
detailing such as the "necklace" of fabric loops that tops a simple two-piece 
outfit. Or a jacket that looks like a tailored classic from the front but 
features cutouts in the back. "One of the things I like best about Kymio," says 
Nordstrom buyer Eula Smith, "is that the styling is very contemporary, and 
there are always plenty of new silhouettes." 
</P>
<P>
Dam works hard at keeping Kymio fresh. Nine or 10 times a year, she creates 30 
to 40 new designs, about four times the annual output of the average designer. 
"To Kim, designing is like turning on a faucet," says husband Stefan Gerhardt, 
who oversees Kymio's production. The two met when Gerhardt was in the 
import-export business representing designer lines carried at Ba-Tzu. 
</P>
<P>
The fashion press uses the phrase Euro-Japanese to describe Dam's work. She 
prefers to call her clothing "fashion forward," meaning, she says, that its 
classic quality transcends trendiness without sacrificing its contemporary 
look. Her customers are women age 17 to 60 who like stylish yet unusual clothes 
at moderate prices, she adds. (Jackets retail for $100 to $130; skirts are $60 
to $70.) On a quick tour through the warehouse next to her office, Dam points 
out examples: accordion-pleat chiffons and cotton knits for summer, big 
black-and-white checks mixed with broad black-and-white stripes for fall. 
</P>
<P>
More than anything, though, eclectic detailing sets Dam's designs apart. "Kim 
is extremely innovative," says Denise Cohen-Scher, fashion director at the 
California Mart. "She takes a classic approach but with a slant -- lots of 
intricate detailing, stitching, pleats, appliques, tucks -- that make her 
clothes different." 
</P>
<P>
Dam tends to favor outfits like the one she wears today: an elegant white 
blouse and black rayon skirt, a look she calls "tailored, yet soft and 
feminine." She wears no jewelry, not even a wedding ring, with one exception: a 
gold bracelet that was a gift from her mother. Dam started wearing it as a 
child; now her wrist is too large for her to remove the bracelet. "I don't wear 
jewelry because I don't want to set myself apart," she explains between sips of 
tea so weak it's almost water. "I just want to be a regular person with a 
regular life." 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, the thought of having a regular life was something akin to an 
impossible dream. Still speaking in cadences of her native tongue, gesturing to 
help along her tenuous grasp of English, Dam tells of growing up in war-torn Da 
Nang, where a walk to school meant passing bombed-out houses and lawns littered 
with bodies. Dam had just completed her first year of law school at Saigon 
University in 1975 when her father, a prominent government official, began 
receiving death threats. Soon after, the family left behind a comfortable 
middle-class existence to seek refuge in America. "As we took off," Dam 
recalls, "we saw the bombs falling where we had been." 
</P>
<P>
Relocated in Southern California in late 1975, Dam worked days as a salesclerk 
in a department store and studied English and business at night school. Her 
home was a two-room Van Nuys apartment, shared with her family of nine. One day 
a teacher who was taken by Dam's wardrobe suggested that she study fashion. 
Dam, who as a child used to sneak into her mother's room to use her sewing 
machine, liked the idea. At Los Angeles Trade Technical College, she captured 
four Gold Thimble awards. "Kim was always trying hard to get the most from her 
education," says Sharon Tate, assistant dean of the school's fashion center. 
"There was no question she would go on to do great things." 
</P>
<P>
After graduating in 1977, Dam spent two years taking night courses at Cal State 
Los Angeles, then moved on to a variety of fashion-design jobs, always with the 
thought of someday going into business for herself. In 1984, with her own 
savings and the backing of her family, she opened Ba-Tzu. A year later she 
started Kymio. Now her problem is finding time to do even more. Dam, who works 
seven days a week, decided not to have a baby sitter raise her child, so 2 
1/2-year-old Mio goes to work with her each day. "She loves clothes," Dam says. 
"She changes as often as 10 times a day, playing with the children's clothing 
samples." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the line of children's wear she would like to launch, Dam wants 
to add a line of women's dresses (under the label Mio) for spring of 1990. A 
new shop, Jo-Hji, at the Glendale Galleria, is in the works, and Kymio 
distribution is expanding to France, Italy and England next year. Someday, she 
says, she will teach fashion design at Trade Tech. Can one person maintain such 
a level of activity? "I can," Dam says without a trace of doubt. She twirls a 
pencil, eager to get back to work. "If I had stayed in Vietnam, I would be a 
lawyer or a housewife now. I like this life better. It's everything I dream 
about." 
</P>

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: THE EVOLUTION OF SPIKE LEE; 
</P>
<P>
'DO THE RIGHT THING' IS A TRIUMPH OF FILMIC MATURITY FOR A YOUNG 
WRITER-DIRECTOR-EDITOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his pungently funny trailer for "She's Gotta Have It," Spike Lee, its 
mosquito-legged writer-director-editor, was discovered on a street corner in 
his trademark baseball cap, hightops and oversize glasses, peddling "Tube 
socks, tube socks, three for fi' dollahs." His rap was simple: You bought a 
ticket to his movie, you kept Lee off the streets and maybe he could stop 
selling these tube socks. 
</P>
<P>
With the arrival of his preternaturally assured "Do the Right Thing," Lee's 
third feature, even those whom the movie riles up will have to concede one 
thing: Spike Lee is safely out of the tube sock business. 
</P>
<P>
Each of Lee's films has been a progression, however nothing he has done before 
quite prepares us for the richness of "Do the Right Thing," for the 
picture-puzzle interlocking of its characters, for their organic, explosive 
humor or for Lee's enormous assurance. It is one of those leaps that are 
sometimes called quantum, but may be simply the broad strides of a man born to 
make movies, which Lee, quite clearly was. The leap that "Do the Right Thing" 
represents from the two earlier features is roughly equivalent to the one 
Martin Scorsese made from "Who's That Knocking on My Door?" to "Taxi Driver." 
It was only eight years in time, '68 to '76, but light-years in the director's 
power, his focus, his visual and story-telling sophistication. 
</P>
<P>
Scorsese? Spike Lee? The accepted comparison, I suppose, would be to Melvin Van 
Peebles (the early 1970's Van Peebles of "Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song") 
or to Woody Allen, for their comic stance and their work as writer-directors, 
or writer-director-actors. Yet there's something seditious and Scorsese-like to 
"Do the Right Thing," something about heat and intensity and a purely New York, 
faintly surreal vision. And something in the beautiful camera work of Ernest 
Dickerson, Lee's customary cinematographer, may recall the opening of "Alice 
Doesn't Live Here Anymore," or moments from "New York, New York." 
</P>
<P>
What is stunning to consider is the speed with which Lee's technique has 
matured. Certainly having more money to work with is part of the equation, but 
Lee's control seems to have increased a hundred-fold with each film. It seems 
impossible that "She's Gotta Have It," shot in 12 days in 16mm black and white, 
was made only three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
A brash sex comedy, it made money for its distributors, which, considering the 
fact that it had cost $175,000 to make and had been invited to the New 
Director's corner at Cannes, shouldn't have been hard. 
</P>
<P>
To look at it in the light of "Do the Right Thing" is to to wince at some of 
the other male performances, to groan at that dud color dream dance sequence 
and to see how Lee sometime killed his own jokes with undue fussiness. 
Nevertheless, some of his concerns were already in place: he was interested in 
different types within the same strata, and humor was clearly going to be his 
weapon. 
</P>
<P>
"School Daze" (1988) was set in a college not unlike Lee's own Morehouse. It 
took on color and class, apartheid and divestiture; perceived caste differences 
between dark- and light-skinned blacks; skirmishes between the college kids and 
townies, and political differences between young radicals and faculty members. 
It was a lot to do in a light vein, and it confused some audiences. 
</P>
<P>
But its final dreamlike sequence, in which all segments of a divided campus are 
brought together by an alarm bell and told to "Wake up!" "School Daze" was a 
clear precursor to the issues of "Do the Right Thing." 
</P>
<P>
"Do the Right Thing" is certainly about the black community's need to come 
together, but Lee wants everyone, not just the black community who knows it by 
heart, to understand the simmering mess that race relations are in right now. 
It's a situation that has been papered over, avoided, denied or lied about 
during eight years under the Reagan Administration. The inner cities seem a 
remote part of the Bush agenda. 
</P>
<P>
So Lee's way of ringing that alarm bell is a 24-hour visit to the 
Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn on the hottest day of the year, shot in 
colors that look like a reflection from hell itself. 
</P>
<P>
"Do the Right Thing" is complex, bravura movie making. It is also hugely 
entertaining, since fortunately for us, Lee's seditious method is to use humor 
to carry his biting message. The film's enormous amount of humor is satiric, 
physical, sometimes inside, sometimes throw-away, but pervasive. It is attitude 
as much as anything else; a wry philosophical bent that has let more than one 
race get the best of the seemingly unendurable. 
</P>
<P>
As he has before, Lee works with a cross-section but, more ambitiously this 
time, he writes from different ages, voices, races and attitudes. What gives 
the film its flint is watching those attitudes strike up against one another. 
</P>
<P>
Lee forces us at every point to readjust our opinion of characters, to question 
them, to see that within even the most seemingly simple person are 
contradictions and shadings. The pizzeria's Sal (Danny Aiello), so proud that 
over 25 years, the kids in this neighborhood have grown up on his food, can be 
looked at as solid and sincere in what he says, or, I suppose, as a man 
paternalistic as a plantation owner, whose slaves fed at his table, too. 
</P>
<P>
Ossie Davis' unofficial Mayor and Ruby Dee's Mother Sister are the block's 
sages -- yet the Mayor, who's also a genial alcoholic, is not exactly revered 
by a quartet of teen-agers on the block. In reply to an almost sentimental 
speech by the mayor about the pain of listening to his hungry children cry (its 
written sentiment stripped away by Davis' innate power), one of the teen-agers 
tells him it isn't gonna be that way for children of his, because he's going to 
have a job. 
</P>
<P>
Mother Sister can, for one instant, be caught up by the excitement of a looting 
spree, and in the next, screaming in soul-deep pain over what that really 
means. 
</P>
<P>
Mookie, much of whose appeal comes from the fact that Lee plays him, is at the 
same time a lover and an absent father, a calming presence in his job at Sal's 
Famous Pizzeria . . . and the igniting factor in the riot. And even there, his 
actions can be interpreted two ways. Sal might believe that Mookie's lobbing a 
garbage can through his plate-glass window just at the moment when a mob was 
advancing on Sal and his two sons was diversionary. Mookie might see it as his 
expression of pure fury over the death of his friend, minutes before. If "Do 
the Right Thing" is about racism, it's pan-racism. This once-Italian 
neighborhood is now mostly black, partly Puerto Rican; it has a pizzeria built 
and owned by Italian-Americans and a flourishing fruit and vegetable deli owned 
by recent Korean immigrants. Least we look on this as the melting pot in 
action, about mid-way through the heat-wave, everyone suddenly lets loose. 
</P>
<P>
In one of those customary Lee moments when characters address the camera 
directly, there's suddenly an orgy of invective: a black slanders Italians, an 
Italian turns on blacks, Puerto Ricans defame Koreans, a white lets loose 
against Puerto 
</P>
<P>
Ricans and a Korean derides Jews. The effrontery of it will remind you of Lenny 
Bruce, Lee's use of it is almost calmly reportorial. You think things are going 
well here? Think twice. 
</P>
<P>
In Lee's view, there are no clear-cut heroes or villains, only multi-layered 
men and women with intensely human frailties, a point that reportedly worked 
against the film at Cannes with the jury's president, Wim Wenders. Frankly, 
having seen (and hugely admired) the Cannes winner, "sex, lies and videotape" 
and "Do the Right Thing," the scope, the complexity and the accomplishment of 
the two films is in no way comparable. "Do the Right Thing" wuz robbed. 
</P>
<P>
Some people are complaining that Lee should be less ambiguous than he is with 
his film's last 10 minutes. Well, defending "Da Butt," a dance number in 
"School Daze" that cheerfully celebrated pride in anatomy, Lee replied to his 
critics at that time with a prickly open letter printed in Harper's Magazine, 
the most moderate part of which read: "Just because I present problems, some 
people expect me to solve them. That's really unrealistic. It's a burden I 
won't assume. I am 30 years old. I don't have all the answers, and don't 
pretend to. That's not my job. We intended this film to provoke discussion, 
which is what it's doing. . . . If we don't address problems, they don't get 
talked about and solved." 
</P>
<P>
At the very least, "Do the Right Thing" is going to get important things talked 
about. It would be a shame if, in the process, people lost sight of the fact 
that it is also blisteringly fine film making.

PEANUT BUTTER'S BEEN in the news a lot lately. It seems we're all eating a 
whole lot more of it. And why not? Given a choice between, say, a steak and a 
peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich, what sensible person wouldn't opt for the 
latter? Provided, of course, that the peanut butter came from Magee's. 
</P>
<P>
Magee's began grinding freshly roasted peanuts into peanut butter in 1917. In 
those days, the business was located in downtown Los Angeles' Grand Central 
Market. Then in 1934 Blanche Magee opened the first food stall at the Farmer's 
Market. Soon people from all over were discovering that Magee's fresh peanut 
butter was so much more delicious than the stuff you could buy in ordinary 
shops that it was worth ordering by mail. 
</P>
<P>
Magee's Peanut Butter is still as delicious as ever. But now that everybody's 
gotten in on the peanut-butter-eating act, you might want to move on to a 
better class of nut butter. To Magee's Macadamia Butter, for instance, with its 
enormous appeal to food snobs (if only because it is so expensive -- $4.95 for 
a 4-ounce jar). Actually, that particular butter is eerily white, a bit lacking 
in smoothness and not altogether an improvement over unsullied nuts. Almond 
Butter's not a big hit, either -- it has a tendency to remain stiff and 
slightly chunky. 
</P>
<P>
But Magee's Cashew Butter is another matter, entirely. It is smoother than 
peanut butter. It is tastier than peanut butter. It is more expensive than 
peanut butter ($7.50 a pound compared to $2.50 a pound). And it is the perfect 
spread for people who want to be just a little bit ahead of the crowd. After 
all, now that peanut butter's all the rage, can cashew butter be far behind? 
</P>
<P>
Magee's Cashew Butter is available at Magee's, in the Farmers Market, 6333 W. 
3rd St., Los Angeles; telephone (213) 938-4127.

OUTTAKES: SOUL ON ICE

NBC is developing a two-hour movie that will chronicle the rise of ice skating 
star Tai Babilonia and her descent into drugs, alcohol and attempted suicide. 
In 1980, Babilonia and partner Randy Gardner were strong bets to take the gold 
medal at the Lake Placid Olympics when an injury to Gardner ended the pair's 
dream. Babilonia began a slide into chemical dependency and depression that 
ended with her recovery last year. 
</P>
<P>
The TV movie, likely to air during the 1990-91 season, will spend the first 
hour focusing on her start in skating, her pairing with Gardner and the 
crushing blow at the Olympics, an NBC rep told us. Hour two will concentrate on 
her decline, with an upbeat ending as the skater returns to the ice. 
</P>
<P>
Although there's been no casting, Tai and Randy will not play themselves, said 
a staffer at Spectacor Films, which is producing. But the pair will perform 
their own skating sequences. Jeff Kaye

It's been three years and several false starts, but a spokeswoman for producer 
Dino De Laurentiis tells us that film maker Michael Cimino will be back to work 
early this fall directing the remake of "The Desperate Hours," with Mickey 
Rourke reprising the Humphrey Bogart role from the 1955 film. 
</P>
<P>
The tense suspense drama was based on the Joseph Hayes play about an escaped 
convict who holds a man and his family hostage. The latest adaptation, by 
writers Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal, reunites producer, star and 
director, who last teamed for "Year of the Dragon" (1984). 
</P>
<P>
Cimino is currently scouting Dallas locations for the film, which is being 
produced by Pathe Communications for distribution by Warner Bros. -- De 
Laurentiis' first project since the demise of his financially beleaguered De 
Laurentiis Entertainment Group. 
</P>
<P>
Since making the little-seen "The Sicilian" in 1986, Cimino has been attached 
to several stalled films, including the adaptation of Truman Capote's 
"Hand-Carved Coffins"; "Michael Collins," the director's long-cherished project 
on the legendary Irish rebel; and "Santa Ana Wind," a romantic thriller. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Cimino's checkered career, the spokeswoman said, "Dino has nothing but 
praise for Michael's work. . . . He considers him a brilliant talent and plans 
to do several films with him." 
</P>
<P>
Come late fall, the busy Rourke (currently in Rio, filming the steamy "Wild 
Orchid") has the title role of "El Cordobes" for Five Star Productions, 
scheduled to shoot in Spain. Rourke is preparing for the role of the 
flamboyant, legendary matador under the tutelage of veteran matador Manuel 
Benitez. Luis Valdez directs for producer-writer Simon Raphael Abehsera.

TAKING BACK THE PARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'm relieved at long last to see an in-depth look at one of L.A.'s most tragic 
losses -- her parks. The demise of these community extensions has cost us space 
to relax, refocus, gather together, nurture and round out our lives. 
</P>
<P>
This has been a major contributing factor to the increasing burden on our 
schools to take over yet another aspect of education. When park-sponsored, 
extracurricular programs supplement the school programs, the schools, children 
and the community benefit. Parks provide learning opportunities for all ages 
and an essential refuge that schools simply have not been able to replace. 
</P>
<P>
The attention you have called to the plight of our parks should be the 
beginning of a continued and concerted effort to keep this problem in a 
high-priority focus. The loss seems overwhelming; the hope begins with the fact 
that you have begun to open our eyes to the loss.

The cover reminded me of my favorite graffiti in Los Angeles County. When one 
visits the Huntington Botanical Gardens in San Marino, one is naturally drawn 
to the beautifully manicured theme gardens. Each has its own charm, but the 
Japanese garden is the most distinctive. Close inspection of the tall bamboo 
brings shock, then amusement. Visitors have left their marks by carving 
hundreds of ideograms on the trees. With no knowledge of the language, one 
leaves with a mixed impression. Strangers have defaced what others have 
created. But perhaps they have felt so welcome that they have treated this 
garden as they would their own. In any case, they have added an Eastern version 
that blends nicely with the diversity of Los Angeles.

"Taking Back the Parks" was a well-written but depressing review. But what's 
new? A small minority using tactics the majority are loath to employ has 
usurped public property and put people in fear. Nicole Yorkin places the fault 
with Proposition 13. Hooliganism similar to that in Los Angeles exists in New 
York, Chicago, Detroit, Washington and many places where there is no 
Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
Possibly if the small number of destroyers in a community could be identified, 
the large number of producers would take courage. The ratio is probably much 
less than 1 in 100. With the positive approach that seems doable.

THE PHOTO CONTEST

"Classics," The Times' 16th annual photography contest (May 28), asked for 
photos that captured the Southern California image. Top honors went to pictures 
of a garden hose in someone's back yard, a rock enveloped in surrealistic 
colors and the sun trying to peep through the smoke of a brush fire. Where do 
these judges live, on the moon? Yes, we have brush fires, yes, we have garden 
hoses by the mile, but surely, our image could have been better represented by 
more identifiable pictures.

COMMENTARY: A KNOCK ON ROCK MOVIES;

<P>
HOW 'GREAT BALLS OF FIRE,' THE LATEST FAILED ROCK BIO, REDUCES JERRY LEE LEWIS 
TO ROGER RABBIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 30 years of rock 'n' roll movies, is it too much to ask Hollywood to make 
a biography that reaches for insight rather than nostalgia; a film with enough 
imagination and heart to add to a performer's artistic legacy rather than 
belittle it? 
</P>
<P>
The current "Great Balls of Fire," ironically, ends just where the real drama 
in Jerry Lee Leiws' life began: the time in 1959 when the proud hellcat -- 
accustomed to being paid thousands of dollars a night in the nation's top 
ballrooms and theaters -- was forced to settle for $100 a show in backwoods 
Southern honky-tonks. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, a man of relentless determination and ego, eventually returned to bigger 
paydays, scoring hits in the country field in the late '60s and then benefiting 
from the '50s rock revival in the '70s and '80s. He remains an arresting live 
performer who, far more than Chuck Berry or Fats Domino, represents the purest 
active taste of the original rock 'n' roll spontaneity and independence. 
</P>
<P>
But you'd never know that from the movie. 
</P>
<P>
"Great Balls of Fire" could have been the classic film biography. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Quaid was an inspired choice to play Jerry Lee, the piano-pumping 
Louisiana wild man who was so notorious during rock's early days that he made 
anxious parents think Elvis Presley wasn't so bad after all. Elvis may have 
shaken his hips when he sang, but he had manners when he was around adults and 
he knew the importance of discretion. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Lee bowed to no man and he didn't see anything wrong in telling the world 
about his marriage to his 13-year-old cousin, Myra Gale Brown. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In Winona Ryder (she's 17), director Jim McBride also had an actress who 
reflects marvelously the conflicting emotions that must have been going through 
13-year-old Myra Gale when Jerry Lee suddenly reached out to her: the urges 
that accompany sexual awakening, the intoxication of being close to somebody so 
famous, and the underlying fear that Jerry Lee could someday go over the edge. 
And the singer does turn suddenly violent in a scene 
</P>
<P>
after his downfall. 
</P>
<P>
With all these elements in place, however, McBride fails badly. Rather than 
explore Lewis' character, McBride, who co-wrote the script with Jack Baran, 
ends up simply satirizing the argyle innocence and daffy exuberance of the 
'50s. 
</P>
<P>
By concentrating on the nostalgia of the '50s rather than the complexities of 
Lewis, McBride leaves us with a film as colorful, slick and soulless as the new 
breed of neighborhood '50s diners. There are hints of Lewis' dark, 
self-destructive streak and his dirt-poor origins in "Great Balls of Fire," but 
it is all kept far in the shadows. 
</P>
<P>
With no depth of story or character to support him, Quaid -- sadly -- ends up 
appearing hammy and even goofy, whether assaulting the piano, strutting around 
the house or driving through town in his shiny new convertible. 
</P>
<P>
"Great Balls of Fire" is the toon of rock movies, with Jerry Lee Lewis reduced 
on screen to Roger Rabbit. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Lee Lewis may be a lot of things, but he's not a simple cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
No one in rock -- even youngsters half his age -- has had a bigger reputation 
for hard living and hard drinking. Lewis was on the road as much as 250 nights 
a year for two decades -- and it almost killed him. It was touch and go in 
1981, doctors said, as they worked to repair a tear in Lewis' stomach lining. 
</P>
<P>
Tragedy, meanwhile, seemed to stalk Lewis at every turn. One of his sons died 
in a swimming pool, another died in a jeep accident. His fifth wife, Shawn, 
died of a drug overdose in 1983 under suspicious circumstances. "20/20" and 
Rolling Stone magazine both raised questions about Lewis' possible implication 
in the death. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview just weeks after the delicate stomach operation in 1981, Lewis 
sat backstage at a Longview, Tex. ballroom and said, "I'll tell 
</P>
<P>
you what it was -- all those years of going, going, going. I think my stomach 
just finally wore out. I've got to start taking better care of myself." 
</P>
<P>
With a showman's timing, Lewis flashed a wide grin and added, "Now where's that 
whiskey?" 
</P>
<P>
Rock 'n' roll movies in the '50s at least had the rock stars themselves in 
front of the camera. They were mostly quick exploitation films, offering fans 
-- in the days when rock concerts were still rarities -- a chance to see a 
parade of their favorites do their hits. The plots were no more imaginative 
than the titles of the film: "Don't Knock the Rock," "Rock, Rock, Rock" and 
"Go, Johnny, Go." 
</P>
<P>
In "Don't Knock the Rock," a riot breaks out at a rock dance and city fathers 
blame the music, but disc jockey Alan Freed finally convinces everyone that 
rock is really a healthy outlet. All this goes on between the real action and 
lure of the film: numbers by rock stars Bill Haley and Little Richard. 
</P>
<P>
In "Shake, Rattle and Rock," a citizens' group again wants the ban rock, but 
another disc jockey (this time played by Touch Connors) again saves the day. 
The real lure: the songs by Fats Domino and Joe Turner. 
</P>
<P>
Even the plots of Elvis Presley's early movies were simply stock "pop star" 
vehicles, but Elvis' presence alone in "Jailhouse Rock," "Loving You" and "King 
Creole," conveyed far more of the rock experience than the toothless nostalgia 
of "The Buddy Holly Story" and "Great Balls of Fire." 
</P>
<P>
Two new forms of rock movies eventually took their place alongside the the 
early star vehicles: documentaries and the biographies. The documentaries -- 
from the pure musical celebration of "Monterey Pop" in 1968 and "The Last 
Waltz" in 1978 to the violence and chaos of "Gimme Shelter" in 1971 -- have 
been the far more valuable. 
</P>
<P>
The best was D. A. Pennebaker's "Don't Look Back," a chronicle of Bob Dylan's 
1965 solo tour of England. It was an unforgettable glimpse of what's it's like 
to be a creative artist virtually under siege by both the press and fans. It 
shows Dylan, only a couple of years older than the Lewis as shown in "Great 
Balls of Fire," being alternately intrigued by the fan worship and repelled by 
it. "Don't Look Back" might not unravel the mystery of Dylan, but it gives us a 
memorable look inside his world. 
</P>
<P>
Another classic rock film of the '60s, Richard Lester's "A Hard Day's Night" in 
1964, was a bridge between the old exploitation rock vehicles of the '50s and 
the emerging documentary style as -- partly scripted and partly improvised -- 
it celebrated the Beatles' vitality and charm. 
</P>
<P>
For all its ambition, Prince's "Purple Rain" in 1984 was a throwback to the 
'50s exploitation films -- showcasing Prince the same way that, say, "Jailhouse 
Rock" showcased Elvis. The story was corny and confusing, but Prince's 
electrifying performance gave the film a wallop that far outclassed the 
biographies. 
</P>
<P>
Few stars can carry a film the way Presley and Prince have (and Prince's 
follow-up, "Under the Cherry Moon," showed just how much trouble he had on the 
screen when stepping outside of his musical persona), so the best chance at 
quality in a rock movie remains the documentaries. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the biographies -- however shallow and contrived -- seem to represent the 
best chance at a solid box-office return, so Hollywood will be forever tempted 
by them. The music and continuing affection for early rock heroes gives the 
film makers a head-start on connecting with a wide audience. 
</P>
<P>
There are plenty of '50s performers to choose from: Rick Nelson, Little 
Richard, Sam Cooke, Fats Domino. And, then there are the '60s stars. Films are 
already under way or under discussion about Jim Morrison, Otis Redding and Jimi 
Hendrix. Ultimately, someone will attempt a Dylan biography. 
</P>
<P>
The latter is enough to make you shudder.

On his first pop-oriented album in four years, Manilow has largely dispensed 
with the Big Finish -- the booming, crashing climax that was long his 
trademark. The Big Finish contributed to Manilow's long string of hits in the 
'70s, but also hastened his decline in the '80s as many fans tired of the 
tightly constructed formula. The best songs on Manilow's new album, including 
the tender ballads "Keep Each Other Warm" and "Some Good Things Never Last," 
are looser and more fluid. The increased subtlety and restraint give the album 
a more contemporary sensibility. The quality of the songs -- Manilow had a hand 
in writing only two -- doesn't compare with his best '70s work, but the sound 
rethinking of his approach is encouraging. PAUL GREIN

Wasn't there a time when honest-to-goodness self-expression was a part of 
popular music? These days it often seems that the concept of soul has been 
battered into submission by runaway drum-machine beats and over-amped, 
under-talented vocalists. Well, the soul-starved can give those vintage Aretha 
Franklin and Bob Marley albums a break. Soul II Soul's debut album is a bright, 
cheery and innovative collection that will go over as well with hip-hop hungry 
teens as with those having more sophisticated tastes. 
</P>
<P>
This British dance posse isn't a conventional band. Leader and producer Jazzie 
B. uses the Jamaican term "sound system" when describing this diverse alliance 
of female vocalists, deejays and musicians. Borrowing beats from the mellow 
side of New York hip-hop and adding string backing in lieu of standard R&amp;B 
horns, the group arrives at a natural, uncontrived sound with strong reggae and 
African influences. 
</P>
<P>
The styles may be mixed, but the sound is solid as a rock. From the jazzy flute 
soloing on "African Dance" to the gorgeously arranged, a cappella "Back to 
Life," Soul II Soul shows that the sound-system concept not only works, but 
also may be an effective way of presenting a wide range of talent. 
</P>
<P>
The coolest cuts are the fine down-tempo dance grooves. Caron Wheeler takes the 
mike on the current single, "Keep on Movin'," a breezy, romantic composition 
that's moving up the pop charts, while vocalist Do'reen lays down her 
free-style lyrics on the aptly titled up-tempo house groove "Happiness." 
Do'reen perhaps sums up the Soul II Soul feeling best. As the warm and funky 
beats of "Fairplay" fade, the vocalist repeats the chorus, " ... It's all about 
expression." DUFF MARLOWE

Want to empty a dance floor fast? Play some of the lame, low-energy dance 
tracks from this album. The vocal trio's hit debut album, "Exposure," included 
'Come Go With Me," one of the best dance tracks of the last few years, and it 
established Lewis A. Martinee as a premier dance-music producer. But on the new 
album there's nothing even remotely close to that gem. It's hard to tell which 
is worse, Martinee's production or his arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Expose has veered strongly in a pop direction. Pop ballads get a heavier 
emphasis this time -- possibly because the ballad "Season's Change" from the 
last album was a smash hit. Actually, Expose's singers -- Ann Curless, Gioia 
and Jeanette Jurado -- are very capable, and their vocal quality continually 
shines through, even on some of the awful tunes. The album does feature one 
top-notch song -- a ballad, "Your Baby Never Looked Good in Blue," which has 
mournful, country-style lyrics. DENNIS HUNT

An album of roughly half-religious and half-romantic songs like this one by the 
Rev. Green isn't a good idea. Those who prefer one kind of music don't want to 
be bothered -- on the same album -- with a lot of material from the other 
genre. And in this case, the scales tip more toward gospel, as the lyrics of 
some of these romantic songs have religious overtones. Green seems to be more 
interested in not offending religious fans than pleasing his pop/R&amp;B 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
Green -- the top romantic R&amp;B singer of the early '70s, known for his 
passionate, near-orgasmic style -- switched to gospel in the late '70s. In the 
last few years, though, he's been easing back into romantic R&amp;B. But he's 
not singing love songs with that same old passion. His edge is gone. Maybe he 
doesn't invest the same fervor into those love songs because, as a cleric, he 
now regards that material differently. For whatever reason, as a romantic 
singer, he's sunk from great to just above average. Thus, the religious half of 
this album is fine. The pop/R&amp;B parts, though, are bland. The message is 
clear: Green should stick to what he does best, which, these days, is religious 
music. Duff Marlowe

POP EYE: 'FOR SALE' SIGNS AT A&amp;M RECORDS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL GREIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's the hottest rumor in the music industry: A&amp;M Records, the label that 
brought you Herb Alpert &amp; the Tijuana Brass, the Carpenters, Peter 
Frampton, the Police and Janet Jackson, is supposedly for sale. 
</P>
<P>
The reported asking price: $500 million -- not including A&amp;M's extensive 
real estate holdings in Hollywood or its Almo/Irving music publishing division. 
</P>
<P>
The rumor mill has even produced a potential buyer: Fujisankei, the Japanese 
communications conglomerate that releases A&amp;M product in Japan through its 
Pony Canyon subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Industry scuttlebutt notwithstanding, A&amp;M chairman Jerry Moss insists that 
the label isn't for sale -- at least not now. 
</P>
<P>
"The company is not imminently for sale, and I'm convinced all these rumors are 
just spread by our competition," he told Pop Eye. "They constantly put our 
people on edge, confuse our artists and affect my negotiations. It's terrible. 
They're unfounded." 
</P>
<P>
Moss acknowledged that his use of words like "imminently" and "for the time 
being" makes his denial seem qualified, but he said, "I can only speak for 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Moss did say, however, that in a general, philosophical way, he and his partner 
Herb Alpert have begun to see the day when they'd like to step down from the 
company that they founded in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think if that time came it would be under the best circumstances for our 
people, where they would have an opportunity to perform at a higher level in 
every way with our artists," Moss said. "If that kind of a situation came 
about, an offer that was so unbelievable, obviously (we'd have to consider it). 
</P>
<P>
"But I think the way the company is set up at the present time gives me the 
latitude to do the kind of things I like to do. I'm not in a big hurry to 
change it. I'm still having a good time." 
</P>
<P>
A&amp;M's poor showing on the national sales charts this year has helped fuel 
the speculation about a sale. The label has just two albums in Billboard 
magazine's top 100 this week -- LPs by the Neville Brothers and soap opera star 
Michael Damian (the latter through a distribution deal with Cypress Records). 
At one point in April, A&amp;M had just one album in the top 100, a woeful 
performance for a major company. 
</P>
<P>
Like all record companies, A&amp;M has had lean years before -- most recently 
in 1984 -- and it has always bounced back. In 1985 and 1986, for example, 
A&amp;M rebounded with smash albums by Janet Jackson, Bryan Adams and Sting. 
A&amp;M could bounce back again: Jackson's final album under her current 
A&amp;M contract, "Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation," is due this fall, along with 
albums by Adams, Suzanne Vega, Brenda Russell and Squeeze. 
</P>
<P>
The rumors about A&amp;M come just two months after Thorne-EMI acquired a 50% 
interest in Chrysalis Records, and amid much speculation about an imminent sale 
of Island Records. 
</P>
<P>
"You're seeing an incredible shrinking of the record business," said David 
Geffen, whose Geffen Records has in the past two years surpassed A&amp;M as the 
industry's most successful independently owned record company. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the buying spree, Geffen said, is that the major record 
distributors need volume to make the system work. 
</P>
<P>
"Volume is everything for RCA, PolyGram, MCA and Capitol, and they can't seem 
to get it any other way than acquiring these other companies," he said. "It 
seems to me that by the end of next year, the only independently owned record 
company of any size left will be mine because I have no intentions of selling." 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the A&amp;M rumors is that Alpert and Moss declined to comment 
on them for several weeks. Moss acknowledged that the silence probably fueled 
the flames. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, but it's hard to stand up on a soapbox every week or so and say 'I'm not 
for sale,' " he said. "Pretty soon you just get tired of it. And in all 
fairness, I like to talk to the press as much as I like to go into a gorilla 
cage." 
</P>
<P>
LONE STAR: Gloria Estefan has achieved a nifty feat on her fast-rising hit "I 
Don't Wanna Lose You." The lead singer for Miami Sound Machine receives solo 
billing even though she hasn't left that group. 
</P>
<P>
Estefan continues to be backed by the Miami Sound Machine musicians -- 
including her husband, Emilio. The upgraded billing is said to simply reflect 
the way that she has become the star of the act in the eyes of the public and 
the media. 
</P>
<P>
"It just makes sense. You go to where your strength is," said Don Grierson, a 
senior vice president at Epic Records, which will release Estefan's "Cuts Both 
Ways" album next week. 
</P>
<P>
"As they refined and streamlined the show -- made it more 
mass-market/contemporary and less Latin -- Gloria obviously became the focal 
point," he added. "The center of this band is no longer the Latin 'conga' kind 
of dance thing -- though that's still a part of it -- but it is Gloria singing 
songs that she writes primarily." 
</P>
<P>
Estefan has written most of the group's hits to date, including the 
chart-topping ballad "Anything for You." That was a song from the group's 1987 
album "Let It Loose" -- its first as Gloria Estefan &amp; Miami Sound Machine. 
</P>
<P>
Grierson said that one reason for the latest change in billing is that an album 
by an attractive female singer has a greater sales potential than one by an 
oversize pop group -- especially one named after a machine. 
</P>
<P>
"From an image and marketing point of view it's much more logical to use the 
singular name and the singular identity," Grierson said. "The label definitely 
feels more comfortable emphasizing Gloria because she's become such a star, but 
it happened without our trying to force it. It was just the next logical step." 
</P>
<P>
Through a spokesman, the group declined to comment on the change in billing. 
</P>
<P>
NEWS NOTES: Tom Petty has an unusual demand in his contract rider for all 
concert appearances: The rock star insists that no Styrofoam cups or plastic 
plates and utensils be used backstage, on the grounds that they are 
non-biodegradable. Also unusual is the video for Petty's new single "Runnin' 
Down a Dream" -- it's a fully animated, black-and-white clip. . . . Sting is 
set to make his Broadway debut as Mack the Knife in a revival of the Kurt 
Weill/Bertolt Brecht musical "Three Penny Opera," which opens Nov. 2. . . . 
Music by retro-balladeer Harry Connick Jr. is featured on the Columbia 
sound-track album to the upcoming Rob Reiner movie "When Harry Met Sally . . . 
", starring Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan. The comedy also features standards by 
Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong that aren't on the LP. Just 
one question: Will this movie do for Tin Pan Alley what Reiner's 1984 spoof 
"Spinal Tap," did for heavy metal?

INTRODUCING: BLACK IS BOUNTIFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Artist: Clint Black. 
</P>
<P>
Personnel: Black, vocals, guitar; Hayden Nicholas, guitar; Dick Gay, drums; 
Jake Willemain, bass; Jeff Peterson, steel guitar, dobro; John Permenter, 
fiddle. 
</P>
<P>
History: Black is a 27-year-old Houston native who recently topped Billboard's 
country charts with his first single, "Better Man." After flirting with the 
harmonica, which he picked up at 13 (actually purloined one from one of his 
older brothers), Black turned to guitar at 15 and got his first public exposure 
playing at his family's weekly back-yard barbecues. He kept singing while 
working a variety of jobs from iron worker to bait cutter and fishing guide. 
After playing the club circuit around Houston for six years, Black landed a 
meeting in 1987 with ZZ Top's manager Bill Ham, who had long been interested in 
managing a country artist and subsequently helped negotiate his deal with RCA 
Records. 
</P>
<P>
Sound: As both singer and songwriter, Black demonstrates much to be admired in 
the nine songs on his debut album, "Killin' Time." With frequent songwriting 
partner Hayden Nicholas, Black willingly invokes country-music stereotypes -- 
the hard-drinkin' man, the heartfelt goodby -- only to turn them on their 
heads. A perfect example is his first single, "Better Man," the country 
chart-topper. This is one man who finds new strength and wisdom, rather than 
the bottom of a whiskey bottle, after a painful romantic farewell. Black has a 
winning vocal style that evokes a very young Merle Haggard at times, and 
musically he can Western-swing just as hard as fellow Texan George Strait, 
which he proves on the delightful "Straight From the Factory."

NOTEBOOK: PARADISE FOUND NEAR BUSY FREEWAY INTERCHANGE

The San Diego Freeway isn't exactly Restaurant Row -- especially not the part 
that stretches down into Orange County, south of LAX. But that part of the 
freeway is a high traffic area in more ways than one. Surely, reasoned 
developer Howard Mann, there ought to be enough commerce in the area to produce 
a substantial clientele for a high-quality restaurant. Thus, in constructing 
his Andrex Point complex, a 50-acre business park at the intersection of the 
San Diego and Harbor freeways just east of Torrance, he decided to install an 
eating place among the office buildings -- an "oasis," he said. And what better 
name for an oasis than Paradise? 
</P>
<P>
Paradise it will be, then. Mann has hired chef-consultant Debbie Slutsky, who 
helped open such restaurants as the Coyote Cafe in Santa Fe, China Moon in San 
Francisco, and Opera in Santa Monica, as menu consultant for the place. She 
promises "California eclectic" food, with assorted Asian (or, as they say 
nowadays, "Pacific Rim") accents. A beachy theme will be carried out in the 
decor, which will include, for instance, wash basins in the restrooms made out 
of old surfboards. Scott Johnson is architect on the project, with Vince 
Kikugama as management consultant. Mann expects to open Paradise in September.

REVOLUTIONARY DINING: All the Bicentennial Bastille Day Activities Fit to Eat: 
Champagne in West L.A. observes Bastille Day on July 14 with a special 
seven-course dinner (including such dishes as le saumon Robespierre and a 
dessert called l'extase du bourreau -- "the executioner's ecstasy"). Tariff for 
the first seating, from 6 to 6:30 p.m. is $70 a head . . . or rather, per 
person. For the second seating, between 8:15 and 8:45 p.m., the price goes up 
to $90 per person, and black tie or period costume is requested -- there will 
be dancing to a live orchestra. . . . Two days later, on the 16th, the 
non-profit July 16th Committee hosts a gigantic Bicentennial festival in the 
infield at Hollywood Park. Among the attractions will be French-style street 
entertainers (jugglers, fire-eaters, musicians and the like), races involving 
both French waiters and French and American horses, a petanque (bowling) 
tournament, and food and drink provided by such Gallic and not-quite-Gallic 
establishments and purveyors as Antoine's (in the Newport Beach Le Meridien 
Hotel), the Bistro Gardens, Cafe Pierre, Chez Sateau, Camelions, Citrus, Dar 
Maghreb, Emilio's, Fennel, L'Ermitage, Le Dome, Ma Maison, Patout's, Rebecca's, 
Koutoubia, Le Chardonnay, Michael's Waterside Inn, Perrier-Jouet Champagne, 
Evian Water, and that old French favorite, Coca-Cola. The event runs from 9 
a.m. to midnight, with tickets priced at $5 per person in advance and $7 per 
person at the door (with food and drink samples extra). The event will benefit 
the Starlight Foundation and the Pro-Musicis Foundation. Call (213) 472-9645 
for further information. 
</P>
<P>
Ma Maison in West Hollywood observes Bastille Day on both the 14 and 15 with 
food and live music. An a la carte menu and a five-course, $60-per-person prix 
fixe menu will be featured. . . . And if you still haven't gotten the 
Bicentennial out of your system, Salisbury Manor in Los Angeles brings up the 
rear with a commemorative seven-course post-Bastille-Day wine dinner on 
Wednesday, July 19, at 7 p.m. Price is $50 per person.

COMINGS AND GOINGS: Award-winning chef Jean Banchet and his wife Doris, owners 
of Le Francais in Wheeling, Ill. (near Chicago), have sold their landmark 
restaurant to Roland and Mary Beth Liccioni -- former chef and pastry chef, 
respectively, of another noted dining establishment in that area, Carlos' in 
Highland Park. The Banchets say they plan to rest for a while and might 
consider opening another place. Meanwhile, Jean plans to consult on several 
restaurant projects. . . . Don Dianda, owner of the resolutely old-style Doro's 
in San Francisco, has sold the establishment to Albert Bourla, owner of the 
Mao's Palace restaurants in Milbrae and San Carlos. Dianda plans to retire, as 
does longtime Doro's chef Paul Bermani. Neither the terms of the sale nor 
Bourla's plans for the place have been revealed. . . . And Rick O'Connell has 
resigned her post as executive chef for Rosalie's and RAF, two popular San 
Francisco eateries of a more modern bent. Both restaurants are operating under 
Chapter 11 protection. O'Connell was also in charge of the kitchen at the 
short-lived Los Angeles version of Rosalie's, which opened for a few months on 
the site of the old 385 North on La Cienega. 
</P>
<P>
BORN AGAIN: Bruno's Chartreuse, which closed last year at its Cheviot Hills 
location because the pretty little red brick building it occupied didn't meet 
city earthquake codes, has reopened in Santa Monica -- on the site of the 
recently shuttered Tosh. (Tosh owner/chef Jeff Vinion is reportedly going to 
open a new place in Santa Barbara. . . . The popular Cafe Beaujolais in 
Mendocino has spawned a casual offspring, The Brickery, next door. The simple 
menu includes nothing but salads, pizzas (cooked in a wood-burning brick oven) 
and desserts . . . . . . Stratton's, long a popular restaurant in Westwood, has 
opened a new branch in Encino. . . . And Peony, a Hong Kong-style seafood 
restaurant in San Gabriel, has sprouted a second location, this one in El 
Monte. 
</P>
<P>
NIBBLES AND BITS: From Paris comes world that chef Alain Senderens has 
introduced a new bargain-priced luncheon menu at his notoriously pricey 
three-star Lucas-Carton on the Place de la Madeleine. The cost of the new 
so-called "business lunch," offering a choice of four appetizers, four main 
courses, and four desserts? A mere 350 francs -- about $55 at the current 
exchange rate! Come to think of it, though, that's really not so bad: Another 
Parisian three-star, Jamin, now gets 350 francs apiece for several of its main 
courses. . . And, while you might think it's a given that Italy has better 
restaurants than Spain, the Guide Michelin doesn't necessarily agree. In their 
1989 guide to Spain and Portugal, just out, they have awarded Arzak in San 
Sebastian a third star. With Zalacain in Madrid, which earned its third star 
last year, that gives Spain two top-ranked Michelin restaurants; Italy still 
has but one, Gualtiero Marchesi in Milan. . . . Piero Selvaggio's Primi in West 
Los Angeles has introduced a new summer menu, featuring such unusual Italian 
dishes as snails with polenta, orange-cured salmon with eggplant and zucchini, 
and frogs' legs risotto. . . . Joe Patti has opened Piccola Alley behind his La 
Famiglia and Piccola restaurants in Beverly Hills. Chef is old-timer Henri 
Broussard, who ran Broussard's Patio Orleans on the Sunset Strip in the 1950s. 
. . . Fama in Santa Monica has opened for lunch on weekdays, and Cha Cha Cha in 
Los Angeles now serves brunch both Saturday and Sunday, from 11:30 a.m. to 5 
p.m. . And the Foodsource Hotline, a good number to call for restaurant 
information, has a new phone number: (213) 653-8585.

AGENCY'S FUNDING OF NEW ARTWORKS IS JUST ONE OF MANY SIGNS THAT LOS ANGELES IS 
CONTINUING TO TIGHTEN ITS GRIP ON THE TITLE OF MURAL CAPITAL OF THE WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
When it comes to exposure, artist Wallace (Rip) Cronk thinks his latest work 
has it all over anything by Vincent Van Gogh. 
</P>
<P>
"Even a very famous painting won't be seen by the number of people who will see 
this," Cronk said as he worked on "Rebirth of Venice" one recent Saturday. "Not 
as many people see 'Starry Night' as will see this." 
</P>
<P>
Cronk doesn't claim that his work is superior to Van Gogh's. Just more visible. 
Certainly it's larger. The painting, which takes up the side of a two-story 
building by the Venice boardwalk, is one of nine murals being completed under a 
pilot program between the city of Los Angeles and the nonprofit Social and 
Public Arts Resource Center (SPARC). 
</P>
<P>
Called Neighborhood Pride, the program will be expanded in its second year to 
fund 15 new murals. It is one of several signs that Los Angeles has tightened 
its grip on the title of mural capital of the world. Efforts are under way to 
restore fading works, and a map and guidebook to 260 murals has been published. 
</P>
<P>
Trouble spots still exist. Several works throughout the city have disappeared, 
painted over or torn down by property owners. Artists have lawsuits pending in 
two such cases. In another instance, a building owner has refused to permit 
restoration of a mural, and graffiti remains a persistent problem. 
</P>
<P>
But muralists still love L. A. Last year, when Venice-based SPARC received a 
$250,000 city contract for the Neighborhood Pride project, 90 artists applied 
for the nine commissions. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the largest murals program in the country," said Joe B. Rodriguez, 
executive director of SPARC. 
</P>
<P>
The 14-year-old agency will receive $405,383 for the program in the fiscal year 
that started July 1. Adolfo Nodal, general manager of the city Cultural Affairs 
Department, said he hopes to see SPARC receive even larger contracts in years 
to come. 
</P>
<P>
"The murals are like a cultural emblem of the city," Nodal said. He estimates 
that there are 1,000 murals in Los Angeles, more than any other city worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Cronk's "Rebirth of Venice" will be immediately familiar to hundreds of 
thousands of people who have strolled or roller-skated the Venice boardwalk. At 
the western end of Windward Avenue in Venice, a few steps from Ocean Front 
Walk, the artist is finishing a replacement for "Venice on the Half Shell." 
</P>
<P>
The original hung for seven years on the Venice Pavilion along the boardwalk. A 
parody of the Botticelli painting, "Birth of Venus," its central figure is a 
woman roller-skating. Cronk's girlfriend, Linda Foster, was the model. The 
original has been damaged by weather and graffiti. Done on plywood, it was 
removed and placed in storage last year. 
</P>
<P>
The artist said he has planned for the inevitable graffiti in the new work. The 
part of the mural depicting the walkway, an area from the ground to a height of 
six feet, is splatter painted, making graffiti less distinguishable and easier 
to cover up. In the rest of the mural, Cronk has designed shadows or outlines 
around most of the figures. Graffiti will blend into these outlined images with 
a little retouching, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As with all commissions in the Neighborhood Pride program, Cronk receives 
$7,000 and is furnished a five-member crew of apprentices. The youths, ages 14 
to 22, are paid minimum wage and work 15 to 20 hours a week for about three 
months. SPARC also pays for paint and other materials, bringing the cost of 
each mural to about $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Burguno, 22, said he hopes to attend art school and has learned much from 
helping Cronk. "Using an airbrush was new, and I picked up lots of techniques," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
While the Neighborhood Pride program, which uses funds from the mayor's office, 
is new, SPARC has commissioned murals with money from other city departments. 
Judy Baca, a SPARC co-founder, estimates the total number to be 250. Baca was 
the principal artist on the city's largest mural, the "Great Wall of Los 
Angeles," done on a concrete side of the Tujunga Wash in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone views the SPARC commissions as a valuable addition to the city's 
murals scene. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate the idea that people are waiting around for a program, and if there's 
no program, they don't do a mural," said Kent Twitchell, who, like Baca, is one 
of the city's best-known muralists. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to see people go out and find a wall and just do a mural," he said, 
adding that it's not hard to find an owner who will permit a building to be 
painted. "That's what makes it a truly important indigenous folk art. It 
doesn't cost that much. For 50 or 60 bucks in paint, you can do a small mural." 
</P>
<P>
Older murals increasingly face the problems of fading and destruction. 
Twitchell has sued a building owner who slapped white paint over "Old Woman of 
the Freeway," a mural of a woman with a flowing, snake-like shawl that was 
visible from the Hollywood Freeway. The owner hoped to sell the space for 
advertising to an athletic shoe company, Twitchell and others said, but the 
deal fell through. 
</P>
<P>
Amy L. Neiman, an attorney in the Century City office of Folger &amp; Levin, is 
representing both Twitchell and a group of East Los Angeles artists whose 
block-wall mural was torn down by the property owner. She said the lawsuits 
cite the California Art Preservation Act, which requires a property owner to 
give an artist a chance to remove an artwork before it is destroyed. Neiman and 
others say there are chemical processes that permit murals to be peeled off, 
even if they are painted directly onto walls. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica artist Tom Van Sant won what he termed a considerable settlement 
by suing under the preservation act after his mural inside a downtown Los 
Angeles building was damaged and covered up during a remodeling project. 
</P>
<P>
"The destruction is a significant problem," Neiman said. "Artists don't know 
what their rights are, and property owners don't know what their 
responsibilities are." 
</P>
<P>
She said the state law probably would not apply in another situation: the 
refusal of a building owner to permit restoration. 
</P>
<P>
In Venice, at Dell Avenue and Venice Boulevard South, a mural called "The Jaya" 
is chipped and fading. Designed by Emily Winters and painted in 1975 by a group 
of women, it depicts the encroachment of high-rise development on an idyllic 
Venice. SPARC runs a mural restoration program and has offered $500 toward 
refurbishment. 
</P>
<P>
Winters wants to do the work. But Peter Williams, a photographer who bought the 
building 2 1/2 years ago, says he doesn't like the mural and won't give his 
consent. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand the mural has historical significance and is an emotional trigger 
for some portion of the people who live here," Williams said. "I don't want to 
have it destroyed and I don't want to restore it either. The subject of the 
mural is strongly political. I have taken an informal poll of my neighbors. 
Sixty to 70% say it's not very attractive, and the others say if you touch that 
mural, there's going to be trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, of SPARC, said the group heads off problems of graffiti and offended 
residents by holding community meetings before going ahead with a mural. "We 
create the idea of neighborhood ownership," he said. "I don't like plop art, 
where you take a sculpture, for instance, put it in a community and say, 'Enjoy 
it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Mark L. Brown, an assistant city attorney who handles matters for the Cultural 
Affairs Department, said a task force of city officials and community members 
has discussed passage of an ordinance that would protect murals. A draft of the 
measure has yet to be completed. 
</P>
<P>
No official count exists of the number of murals lost to fading or destruction. 
Baca said she has done about 20 murals and has lost perhaps three. (A degree of 
permanence will be a side benefit in her current project, "World Wall," being 
painted on seven large panels of canvas. Baca plans to show the work worldwide, 
mounting it a movable wall of chain-link. Two finished panels are on display at 
the SPARC gallery.) 
</P>
<P>
Twitchell said his murals do not fade because he uses the correct paint. Cronk 
said he expects his murals to disappear, that in all artworks the freshness of 
ideas fades, and it is appropriate that the paint does also. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the 2-year-old L.A. Murals Conservancy extend the life of murals by 
washing them occasionally. The private, nonprofit group has applied for grants 
to begin financing restorations. Joy Nuell, executive director, believes that 
the city's estimate of a mural total is high. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been as many as a 1,000, but not that many have existed at one 
time," she said. "Some are dying all the time." 
</P>
<P>
In April the conservancy published a guide and map to 260 murals. Most entries 
are accompanied by a description of the work. The guides cost $2 and are 
available at Dutton's in Brentwood, Small World Books on the Venice boardwalk 
and a few other stores.

Regarding John McManus' June 25 article on the millions that the NBA (and the 
NFL) rake in from television rights: Why don't these sports-biz organizations 
take some of this largess and form minor leagues to develop their talent and 
stop the cynical use of colleges to do it for them? 
</P>
<P>
It is not part of higher education's mission to produce athletes for the 
professional sport leagues, and I, for one, have been infuriated to the point 
of picketing an NFL game in the Coliseum last August and the final NBA playoff 
game at the Forum in June asking that this action be taken. 
</P>
<P>
I write letters, picket professional games and hand out literature advocating 
this idea. The rest of you apparently have never let this idea cross your mind.

POETRY FROM A PC?

<TEXT>
<P>
YOU SIT ALONE at your desk by the window. A cold rain pours down outside. You 
want to write a poem to tell your lover of your feelings of ineffable longing 
and desperate passion. Except, today -- cruel fate -- the words won't come. 
</P>
<P>
But, hey! No problem! Just pop a copy of Poetry Generator into your PC and let 
the music play. 
</P>
<P>
 I used to be an expert on 
</P>
<P>
 Things I'd rather not remember 
</P>
<P>
 Now and then 
</P>
<P>
 The pounding of the surf keeps us awake 
</P>
<P>
 And it begins to rain 
</P>
<P>
 In the morning you notice that 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't mean anything. 
</P>
<P>
 But wait a second, you say. Your love is a heavy-duty intellectual, a fan of 
Sartre and Heidegger. You can't send a mushy love poem to someone who's into 
death, existential terror and the unbearable lightness of being. Then fire up 
Poetry Generator one more time and lay this little beauty on her mind: 
</P>
<P>
 Share a glass of wine with me 
</P>
<P>
tonight 
</P>
<P>
 Without letting anyone know 
</P>
<P>
 And I will follow you 
</P>
<P>
 In the milky moonlight 
</P>
<P>
 Faded photographs 
</P>
<P>
 Settle over the landscape 
</P>
<P>
 And it had to end this way 
</P>
<P>
 Sudden the sky grows dark.

 Poetry Generator can compose a poem in about three seconds in any quantity you 
like. As with snowflakes, no two are alike. The author, R. K. West of Mission 
Hills, has compiled a library of thousands of words and phrases randomly chosen 
by the software and then arranged in poetic form according to certain 
structural rules. Eight out of each 10 poems make only partial sense, but the 
remainder are at least as comprehensible as the sort of things you see in 
poetry magazines or the kind of existential Angst that angry young men and 
women used to shout out at poetry readings.

 The weight lifters who don't belong here

 They are all unfaithful to you

<P>
 Even though they've lost track of the time 
</P>
<P>
 You feel your cheeks burning with shame 
</P>
<P>
 They look at you through 
</P>

binoculars 
</P>
<P>
 And your analyst was right.

CHILDREN LOVE THE outdoors. An outing to a local nature center is fun for both 
adults and kids and can be suitable for all ages, from the baby carried in a 
backpack to the budding junior scientist. 
</P>
<P>
The staff guides and naturalists of the Wilderness Institute in Woodland Hills 
and Agoura lead outings and classes for parents and children in the Santa 
Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. Topics of walks and study sessions 
include tidepools, survival skills, bugs, lizards and an expedition to a 
Chumash Indian cave. 
</P>
<P>
At the William O. Douglas Outdoor Classroom (WODOC), volunteer docents lead 
non-strenuous walks through the Upper Franklin Canyon Reservoir. Babes in the 
Woods is designed for children 3 and under and is accessible to strollers. 
Tykes on Hikes is for kids 4 to 6 and their parents. WODOC also offers special 
programs such as Tales in the Woods, which features Native American legends, 
nature stories and other local lore. 
</P>
<P>
TreePeople is an organization primarily interested in the reforestation of 
areas denuded by fire, disease and urbanization. At its headquarters in 
Coldwater Canyon Park, there is a nature trail through the Magic Forest, a 
seedling nursery and an educational center that features information on 
recycling as well as the restoration of the urban forest. Guided tours are 
offered Sunday morning, but families are welcome to take a self-guided tour at 
any time. 
</P>
<P>
The Eaton Canyon Park and Nature Center in Pasadena offers Saturday-morning 
family walks and regularly scheduled talks on native Southern California 
animals. It also offers twilight and moonlight hikes to see and hear some of 
the area's nocturnal residents, including owls, coyotes and bats. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilderness Institute maintains an outdoor center in Agoura Hills but 
utilizes a number of sites in the Santa Monica Mountains. Fees are charged for 
hikes and classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The William O. Douglas Outdoor Classroom is located on Franklin Canyon Drive 
and can be reached from either Beverly Drive or Coldwater Canyon Drive. Walks 
are free but reservations are required for Babes in the Woods and Tykes on 
Hikes walks. 
</P>
<P>
 The TreePeople location is at 12601 Mulholland Drive, at the intersection of 
Coldwater Canyon Drive. Free guided tours are offered Sunday from 11 a.m. to 
noon. 
</P>
<P>
 Eaton Canyon Park and Nature Center is located at 1750 N. Altadena Drive. 
Admission is free. Twilight and moonlight hikes are coordinated with the new 
and full moons.

FORD TAURUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LASKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"YOU CAN HAVE IT in any color you like as long as it's black," said Henry Ford 
of the Model T, setting the precedent for his company's vaunted conservatism. 
Indeed, Ford is still stamping out its boxy Lincoln Town Car, little changed in 
a decade and boasting an interior trimmed with tacky wood-grained plastic. 
</P>
<P>
Yet now, Ford's bread-and-butter entry in the family-car field is stylish 
Taurus, introduced in 1985. With the Taurus, Ford finally one-upped GM, 
traditionally the styling leader, by winning mention on Fortune Magazine's 10 
best-designed American products list and becoming the best-selling car in its 
class. And the bulbous Taurus station wagon -- in black, of course -- has 
become a stylish, mid-range station wagon choice among Southern Californians, 
including the trendy design community. 
</P>
<P>
Ford's vice president of design Jack Telnack, an alumnus of Art Center College 
of Design in Pasadena, recalls that the managers were serious about wanting 
something really different. The new model was to appeal to yuppie buyers not 
affluent enough for a BMW but appreciative of European styling and 
instrumentation. Indeed, the Taurus bears a striking resemblance to the 
German-made Audi 5000. Says Telnack: "We started work on ours before theirs 
came out. We have a softer, more aerodynamic shape and better-integrated 
bumpers." 
</P>
<P>
The Taurus' "aero" looks appeal to the pocketbook as well as to the eyes, 
because the reduction in wind resistance means that the engine burns less gas. 
(On the other hand, the rounded profile and windows mounted flush to the body, 
without protruding trim, have won the Taurus nicknames such as "jellybean" and 
"bathtub.") 
</P>
<P>
To enhance aerodynamics further, Telnack dispensed with the grille entirely; 
air cools the engine by traveling through ducts under the bumper. Reportedly, 
the grille was the biggest single design decision, perhaps because no part of a 
car's anatomy has been as touchy to Ford management since the ill-fated Ford 
Edsel. The Edsel's odd vertical grille, likened to an anteater's snout, 
contributed to the car's demise in 1962 -- at the time the costliest fiasco in 
American corporate history. Luckily, this time Ford indeed "had a better idea."

BOOKBINDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH SIMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A HAND-BOUND BOOK is two works of art: the writing on the pages, and the design 
and craftsmanship on the cover surrounding it. A hand-bound book is hard to 
find and expensive to buy -- but it is not impossible to bind yourself. 
</P>
<P>
A warning: This is not the hobby for a dilettante. The array of equipment 
needed is great, and the availability of materials in Southern California is 
rather poor. Mail order looms large. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, anyone who cherishes books for their heft and color, size and 
shape, the feel of the cover as well as the diversions within, will be 
fascinated by the craft of bookbinding. At its very simplest, it is sheets of 
paper stitched together and encased with a binding of board, paper or leather 
that is glued at the spine and tidied up on the inside with endpapers. But the 
pages and covers must be carefully measured and cut and then squeezed into a 
piece of medieval equipment called the lying press, which not only gives the 
book its tight shape but also makes that little ridge where the spine curves 
around to become the cover. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the size of the book and style of the binding, there are many 
different ways to stitch the pages together; there are even different types of 
adhesives and spines. Veteran hand-bookbinders can turn out metal, wood, 
plastic or velvet-covered bindings that rival the Hope diamond in flash and 
substance. "Bound to Vary," a designer-bookbinding exhibit at the Renwick 
Gallery in Washington (up through the end of July), includes various 
bookbinders' editions of Herman Melville's "Billy Budd" (with handmade papers 
and handprinted woodcuts) in dazzling nautical styles. If anything can inspire 
courage to try this craft, this collection will. You don't have to fly to D.C.; 
there is a book of the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Collings Bindery in Los Angeles is perhaps the only source of 
hand-bookbinding instruction in Southern California. Charles Collings gives 
three-hour classes every Saturday; the cost is $75 a month, open ended; 
students can stay one month or longer. Much longer -- one student has been 
going for 15 years. "A lot of people don't have the space at home," Collings 
says, or the lying press. Collings says there is no local source for general 
bookbinding supplies, but they are available from Talas, 213 W. 35th St., New 
York, N.Y. 10001-1996 (catalogue $5); Bookmakers, 2025 I St. N.W., Room 502, 
Washington, D.C. 20006 (free catalogue), and Colophon Bindery, 1902 N. 44th 
St., Seattle, Wash. 98103 (catalogue $2). Several books are available in 
varying levels of instruction; Collings recommends "The Craft of Bookbinding," 
by Eric Burdet, and "Bookbinding and the Care of Books" (Taplinger Publishing); 
they are no longer in print, but copies might still be circulating. He also 
recommends "The History of English Craft Bookbinding Technique," by Bernard C. 
Middleton (available from Oak Knoll Books; write 414 Delaware St., New Castle, 
Delaware 19720). Oak Knoll Books has just issued a new catalogue, "M511 
Bookbinding", that lists new titles and rare books about bookbinding. 
</P>
<P>
 On a more accessible level are three Dover Publications books, "Bookbinding: 
Its Background and Technique," by Edith Diehl, "Basic Bookbinding," by A.W. 
Lewis, "How to Clothbind a Paperback Book," by Francis J. Kafka, and "Hand 
Bookbinding: A Manual of Instruction," by Aldren Watson (Macmillan Publishing). 
"The Practical Guide to Craft Bookbinding," by Arthur W. Johnson (Thames &amp; 
Hudson), is not for beginners. The last five books, as well as "Bound to Vary," 
can be ordered from the Renwick Gallery Museum Shop, c/o Smithsonian 
Institution, Washington, D.C. 20560; telephone (202) 357-1300.

ORANGE COUNTY PLAYS CATCH UP ON GOLF COURSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County mattress magnate Wayne Simmons plans to drive from his Anaheim 
Hills residence to Dana Point every other week this summer to play golf at the 
Links at Monarch Beach, shunning a country club located much closer to his 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons, owner of W. Simmons Mattress Co. in Cerritos, says it doesn't bother 
him a bit to fight freeway traffic for 45 minutes and pay the highest green 
fees in Orange County -- $50 on weekdays, $75 on weekends -- to play a 
first-class course with two holes right on the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
There are plenty of people who share Simmons' enthusiasm, and their apparent 
willingness to play golf at nearly any cost is prompting developers to 
transform hundreds of acres of valuable land in Orange County into upscale golf 
courses. 
</P>
<P>
At least 12 new golf courses are being planned or built in Orange County, most 
in conjunction with expensive south county housing developments. Their 
completion will increase the number of public and private courses in the county 
to 44. 
</P>
<P>
The new facilities are billed as premier courses, designed by golfing 
luminaries and architects such as Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Robert Trent 
Jones Jr., Tom Fazio, Tom Weiskopf, Jay Morrish and Ted Robinson. And all will 
cost much more to play than most golfers are accustomed to paying. 
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of golfers and a limited supply of courses has sparked a 
golf course construction spree across the country. Developer interest has been 
stoked by higher fees, which make operating courses more lucrative than in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
Contributing to the boom in Southern California is the ability to use golf 
courses to satisfy open space mandates and the recognition that the presence of 
golf courses will increase adjoining property values. 
</P>
<P>
From 1970 through 1988, the number of golfers in the United States more than 
doubled to 23.4 million from 11.2 million, according to the National Golf 
Foundation. The national golfing population is expected to expand to 30 million 
by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lagged Behind in Construction 
</P>
<P>
The foundation believes that demand is sufficient to support construction of 
400 or more golf courses annually between now and the year 2000. Only 211 new 
courses were opened in 1988. Golf, which seemed to take a back seat to tennis 
as the "in" sport of the early 1970s, is enjoying a resurgence in the 1980s. 
The national tennis population has fallen to 20 million from a peak of 40 
million in the late 1970s, according to the American Tennis Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The change is generally attributed to the aging of America's baby boomers, many 
of whom are now looking for less strenuous forms of recreation that also offer 
social and professional payoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County, with an estimated 214,000 golfers, long has lagged behind other 
areas in construction of new golf courses. National Golf Foundation statistics 
show that in 1987, the county had 4,653 golfers for each 18-hole course. That 
compared to 3,620 golfers per 18 holes statewide and 2,056 golfers per 18 holes 
nationally. California had the fewest courses per capita of any state in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
The demand in Orange County is dramatized by the long lines that form every day 
before dawn outside of pro shops at lower-cost public courses. Early rising is 
a required regimen for golfers who stand in line not to play that day, but to 
make reservations for a week later. 
</P>
<P>
The new courses are expected to attract golfers who want to escape the jammed 
municipal courses and are willing to pay more for some elbow room at the 
upscale facilities. The new courses also claim that they will be a cut above 
most municipal courses in quality. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Fees 
</P>
<P>
Gene Krekorian, senior vice president of Economic Research Associates in Los 
Angeles, said no one in Orange County is building the kind of golf course that 
is needed most: those with fees of $10 to $15. Even so, he said, there are 
plenty of golfers who will support the more expensive courses. 
</P>
<P>
By traditional standards, the new courses are certainly pricey. 
</P>
<P>
At the Tustin Ranch Golf Course, an undulating expanse of manicured turf, 
pools, waterfalls and 2,000 trees that is making its debut Monday, golfers will 
be asked to pay $45 on weekdays and $60 on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Charges at Tijeras Creek Golf Course, scheduled to open next summer in the 
developing foothill community of Rancho Santa Margarita, are expected to run 
about $25 on weekdays and $50 on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
And two public golf courses that the Irvine Co. plans to develop along the 
coast just south of Corona Del Mar as part of a resort project are expected to 
top the $50 and $75 fees at the Links at Monarch Beach, currently the county's 
most expensive course. 
</P>
<P>
With fees like these, developers can not only recover all of their development 
costs but also pay for part of the land underlying the course, said Krekorian. 
</P>
<P>
Some developers, however, have no interest in operating golf courses and plan 
to recapture their costs by turning the courses into private clubs and selling 
memberships at prices that would have seemed astonishing only a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Initiation fees for memberships in the new private courses range from $8,500 at 
Pacific Golf Club in San Clemente to $75,000 at Marbella Golf &amp; Country 
Club in San Juan Capistrano. In addition, members must pay monthly dues in the 
hundreds of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the high cost, memberships are selling briskly. Although the golf 
course and clubhouse at Marbella have yet to open, all but 52 of 300 club 
memberships have been sold, said Ken Olson, corporate broker for the 
developers. And at Pacific Golf Club, memberships are being snapped up at a 
rate of 50 a month, according to Bob Hayward, general manager of the 27-hole 
course. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, cities are encouraging the development of public golf courses. 
Jay Pierce, director of land development for an Irvine Co. subsidiary that is 
developing Tustin Ranch, said the Tustin City Council insisted on construction 
of a showcase public golf course as part of the 9,000-home community. 
</P>
<P>
"We wouldn't have been able to build houses out there if it weren't for the 
golf course," Pierce said. 
</P>
<P>
Christine Singleton, Tustin's community development director, conceded that 
fees at the new course will be too rich for the blood of some Tustin residents. 
Even so, she said, the city is getting a free golf course that is "far better 
than what the city could afford to construct." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Open Space 
</P>
<P>
Although Orange County planning officials will not let developers substitute 
golf courses for required parkland in planned community developments, they will 
count courses toward general open space requirements. To that extent, the 
courses wind up generating revenue from land that would not be developed 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Jessen, chief of planning and acquisition for Orange County Harbors, 
Beaches and Parks, said the county planning commission has shown "a strong 
interest in golf courses." 
</P>
<P>
Jessen said that in return for giving developers open space credit for golf 
courses, the county in recent years has begun filing deed restrictions to be 
sure that the courses will be retained forever as open space and not later 
converted to housing. 
</P>
<P>
In areas where land proposed for a golf course is flat and easily buildable, 
Jessen said, the county generally gets more open space than it otherwise could 
have demanded from a developer. 
</P>
<P>
But as a rule, golf courses are not built because of the green fees they will 
generate or the open space requirements they will satisfy. Krekorian said the 
most compelling economic incentive is the opportunity to increase the prices of 
lots and homes in surrounding communities, especially those directly 
overlooking the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason they do it is for the real estate premiums that in many cases more 
than make up the cost of the land being used for the golf course," Krekorian 
said. "You can't afford to buy a piece of property and build a golf course and 
(expect to) make money. You need to do it as part of an overall community 
development." 
</P>
<P>
Garth Chambers, developer of the Dove Canyon community in southeastern Orange 
County, figures that his costs for golf course development include $6 million 
for the land, $6 million for construction of the course, $12 million for the 
clubhouse and $3 million to subsidize the private club until it is 
self-supporting. He said that if the state Department of Corporations approves 
his plan to sell 479 golf club memberships for $60,000 each, he will reap a 
very modest profit on his $27 million investment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Water Features 
</P>
<P>
But Chambers said he expects that the private country club atmosphere created 
by the golf course will add 30% to average property values within the 
1,300-home community. 
</P>
<P>
According to real estate sales people, home buyers cherish a view of a golf 
course second only to an ocean view. A home by a fairway often will sell for 
$50,000 to $300,000 more than the same model home just out of sight of the golf 
course, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"If a unit is directly on the golf course, the typical premium is about 20% of 
the base price. So if it were a $400,000 single-family home, it would get a 
$80,000 premium for the course," said Ken Agid, a national real estate 
marketing analyst. 
</P>
<P>
The size of the golf course premium, marketing experts said, also depends on 
whether the golf course is private and has water features. 
</P>
<P>
"If you add water, they will pay an additional premium," said Ted Robinson, a 
Laguna Beach golf course architect who designed the new courses in Santa 
Margarita and Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
"For every dollar spent on waterscapes, we will get $3 to $4 in increased real 
estate values," said Robinson, who specializes in "babbling brooks and 
waterfalls." 
</P>
<P>
At Marbella, sales of lots over the past year have been at least as hot as 
sales of golf club memberships. "We had 215 lots for sale, and they are all 
gone but for five. People love to live on golf courses," said J. Richard (Rick) 
McMichael, president of Fairway Land Co., a Laguna Niguel firm that is creating 
the exclusive golf community with two Bay Area developers. 
</P>
<P>
McMichael noted that home buyers don't seem discouraged by the company's 
warnings that living near a golf course can pose dangers from errant golf 
balls. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Essential to Resorts 
</P>
<P>
Even before Coto de Caza has enough golf club members to support one golf 
course, the developer of the fashionable community is planning a second course 
to open in mid-1991. The reason, said John Yelverton, president of the 
California division of Arvida, which is developing the project with Chevron 
Land Development Co., is to provide more golf course settings for more lots. He 
said a golf course view adds $60,000 to $90,000 to the price tag of each 
buildable lot. 
</P>
<P>
Nor does living on golf courses appeal only to golfers. "Typically, 75% of the 
buyers in a golf course-oriented community do not belong to the club or play 
golf," said Agid. "Twenty-five percent of the buyers are attracted by the open 
space and manicured setting, and another 50% by the associated benefits, such 
as the prestige and future real estate values." 
</P>
<P>
Golf courses are deemed essential to south Orange County's bid to become a 
major destination resort area. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarch Beach course is important to the nearby Ritz-Carlton Hotel and will 
be a big draw for two other hotels that are planned on its perimeter. In tandem 
with the new hotel projects, Townsend said, the golf course will be expanded 
and redesigned. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Scheilein, general manager of the Ritz Carlton, said he dearly values an 
agreement that reserves for the hotel half of the Monarch Beach tee-off times. 
"A resort couldn't label itself a resort without a golf course," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Scheilein said, many of his hotel guests are Japanese businessmen who 
are "wild about golf."

<P>
I'm going to spread some rumors that were told to me last week by a couple of 
stock traders. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, I'm going to tell you that I hear (as in "I hear a rumor") that a 
group of investors purchased a 3% stake in Paramount Communications. 
</P>
<P>
In case that one doesn't interest you, I'm also going to tell you that I hear 
(again, as in "rumor") that someone might be interested in acquiring Perry 
Drug. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not going to check out either rumor, quite frankly, because it's too much 
trouble. And besides, I think that I can trust the guys who told me the rumors 
even if they do have a vested interested in spreading them. 
</P>
<P>
I could call the companies involved, but they'll just say "no comment." And 
phoning investment bankers during the summer is futile -- most are on vacation 
for three months. 
</P>
<P>
So I'll just be honest with you, the reader, and say that the Paramount and 
Perry stories are just "rumors." Phew, now my conscience is clear. 
</P>
<P>
With the above exercise, I have become a practitioner of a new and dangerous 
form of para-journalism that I'll call journalossip. I've done nothing wrong, 
legally. I've just given the professional trader what he wants -- rumors. 
</P>
<P>
And so what if the amateur stock buyer loses a lot of money if these rumors 
don't come true. On Wall Street, I'll be a hero. 
</P>
<P>
Journalossip is to business journalism what those tabloid TV news shows are to 
the real broadcast news industry. But journalossip is worse -- because small 
investors can get hold of these rumors, not recognize them for what they are 
and endanger their financial health. 
</P>
<P>
While financial journalossip has been around and growing for years, it reached 
a milestone recently with the introduction of something called the "Traders 
&amp; Investors Alert," a phone-in service with a "900" telephone number that 
will give any rumor lover an earful of corporate takeover gossip for just $1.95 
a minute. 
</P>
<P>
How popular is the service? Barry Davis, the service's "broadcaster," says 
Traders &amp; Investors Alert has more than 1,500 regular customers after being 
in business just over seven months. And it probably will generate $4 million in 
revenue this year. 
</P>
<P>
Davis admits that most of the information on his "whisper" report -- as he 
calls it -- is nothing more than unconfirmed rumors. "The difference," he says, 
"is we lend some sophistication to the rumors because we check the (New York 
Stock Exchange trading) floor on the quality of the buying." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, Davis tries to see if the big professional traders are putting 
their money where their mouth is by buying stock based on the rumors they are 
spreading. 
</P>
<P>
Davis is not a journalist by training. He says he was a stockbroker and 
insurance salesman until he lost his licenses. He now lists his profession as 
"broadcaster," but he also passes his time by trading some of the stocks that 
he's talking about on the whisper wire for his own account. 
</P>
<P>
The popularity of Traders &amp; Investors Alert raises a host of side 
questions: Is there a conflict of interest if Davis trades stocks that he's 
spreading rumors about on his wire? And should he be allowed to call himself a 
journalist and claim protection under the First Amendment? 
</P>
<P>
But for now, let's just discuss one thing: the phenomena of rumor mongering and 
why Wall Street just can't seem to get its fill of gossip. 
</P>
<P>
One trader last week offered this opinion: "The only action we have right now 
are quasi-deals, possible deals and rumors. There aren't enough real takeovers 
to go around at this point," he added. 
</P>
<P>
So, he says, in order to earn a living, traders must buy stocks on rumors, ride 
them as high as they can and sell the stocks before everyone moves on to the 
next rumor. 
</P>
<P>
Here's where Davis and the rumor mongering press come in. The more efficient 
that the press is in helping spread a rumor, the longer that traders get to 
ride the stock higher. 
</P>
<P>
Davis makes a good point. He says he is doing nothing different from other 
journalists these days. But he doesn't pretend -- like some journalists do -- 
to check the accuracy of rumors. 
</P>
<P>
As for capitalizing on people's desire to hear takeover rumors, Davis says: 
"This is the way the world is. Rumors make stocks go up and down. I'm teaching 
people how to play the takeover game." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sick society that wants to get rich overnight," says Davis, adding that 
other phone-line services that he offers -- like one that gives a technical 
interpretation of the stock market -- get far fewer calls than the rumor hot 
line. 
</P>
<P>
Rumor mongering is likely to get worse. Since it's summer, there aren't likely 
to be many real takeover deals announced in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
And since the stock market has been weak recently because of recession fears, 
traders and brokers will probably have to continue to make money off "special 
situations," Wall Street's polite term for stocks rumored to be takeover 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
Which gets me back to the role of journalossip. 
</P>
<P>
Am I, as a journalist, actually doing my readers a service by spreading 
unconfirmed rumors about Perry Drug and Paramount? 
</P>
<P>
Readers may think so as long as the price of Paramount and Perry rise after I 
spread the rumor. But when stock prices turn lower -- as they will someday -- 
those same readers will regret the day that they began playing takeover rumors. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask anyone who was speculating in takeover stocks in October, 1987. A lot 
of people probably swore off speculating in the stock market after that. 
</P>
<P>
Here's more on hidden corporate assets that could lead to takeovers: 
</P>
<P>
Probably the least hidden of all assets in America is land. It's just too hard 
to conceal. 
</P>
<P>
But while some companies, like retailers, obviously own valuable real estate, 
there are many other companies whose land holdings aren't so apparent. Wall 
Street has spent years exploring corporate landholdings, but the recent 
takeover of NWA Corp. -- which came about after it was discovered that the 
airline's secretly owned property in Tokyo was worth hundreds of millions of 
dollars -- has rekindled interest in the subject. 
</P>
<P>
Now companies as diverse as computer manufacturers, farming concerns and mobile 
home manufacturers are coming under the microscope -- or, more accurately, the 
surveyor's scope. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Metz, a managing director at Oppenheimer &amp; Co., says Data General 
Corp., for instance, has facilities on real estate near Boston and in Southern 
California that is so valuable that if the land and buildings were sold and the 
proceeds given to stockholders, he estimates that it could mean a $10- to 
$15-a-share payout. 
</P>
<P>
And Data General's stock is only selling at about $17 a share. 
</P>
<P>
As I mentioned several weeks ago, some of the older airlines are believed to 
have foreign and domestic real estate that was bought quite accidentally 
decades ago but is now worth small fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
The same accidental purchases of real estate have blessed companies in other 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
Metz says that Coachman Industries, whose stock sells for around $9 a share, 
Skyliner Corp. (around $17) and Fleetwood Enterprises (around $26) all have 
stumbled into the ownership of some valuable real estate. 
</P>
<P>
The three mobile home manufacturers located their factories on prime property 
just off major highways to facilitate shipping. And now that same real estate 
has risen sharply in value. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel chains, obviously, own valuable parcels of land. A piece of property that 
Hilton Corp. owns in Hawaii, for instance, could be the crown jewel that leads 
to the acquisition of the company. Even McDonald's Corp., the hamburger chain, 
has erected its golden arches on some pieces of property that have turned 
platinum over the years. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of industries whose primary business isn't real estate but 
which have valuable real estate assets," says Roderick MacIver, a specialist in 
hidden real estate assets who heads his own firm in Basking Ridge, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Railroads, water utilities, agricultural companies, forest products companies 
and industrial companies have all stumbled into valuable land holdings, says 
MacIver. 
</P>
<P>
His most successful pick was Alexander &amp; Baldwin Inc., an agricultural and 
shipping company that owns 95,000 choice acres in Hawaii and California. 
</P>
<P>
If you invest in the stock market, should you be cheering a slowdown in 
economic growth or an acceleration in growth? 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, the answer these days seems to be neither. The stock market has 
put itself in the puzzling position of being afraid of accelerating growth 
because it could bring with it inflation and higher interest rates, and even 
more wary of an economic slowdown because it will hurt corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices lately have been looking on the negative side of all economic 
statistics. "A month ago there was nothing but ecstasy. Now you see nothing but 
problems," says William King, a trader for Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Next Friday, there will be a lot more for the stock market to worry about. The 
government is scheduled to report how much producer prices rose in June. The 
estimates are that prices rose a modest 0.3%, compared to a 0.5% rise in May. 
Retail sales figures, industrial production levels and the capacity utilization 
rate for factories are also to be reported that day. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an extraordinarily difficult market to please," says Hugh Johnson, 
chief investment officer of First Albany Corp. "What the market really wants 
are numbers that say the economy is on a no-boom, no-bust trajectory."

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / PAUL R. KRUGMAN: THE VALUE OF THE DOLLAR MUST FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL R. KRUGMAN, PAUL R. KRUGMAN is professor of economics at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As of late last week, the dollar was trading for about 140 Japanese yen. This 
was at least 20 yen too high, and anyone buying dollar-denominated assets at 
that price was making a big mistake. 
</P>
<P>
The basic point is very simple: There is no sensible long-term forecast for the 
dollar that can justify its current value. That means that everyone who is 
willing to buy or hold dollars is either failing to take a long view or betting 
that he can get out before the dollar comes down too far. At some point, the 
bubble on which the dollar is floating will come into obvious conflict with 
reality, and everyone will try to get out at once -- and the result will be a 
dollar crash. 
</P>
<P>
To understand this argument, it is important to realize that anyone who decides 
to put his money into one or another currency is implicitly making a forecast 
about the future exchange rate. For example, suppose that the one-year interest 
rate in Japan is 5%, while in the United States it is 8%. Then anyone who has 
the choice of putting money into either country, and who chooses to put it in 
the United States, is in effect betting that the dollar will not decline by 
more than 3 percentage points over the next year. (Similarly, putting money in 
Japan is in effect a bet that the dollar will decline more than 3 percentage 
points). 
</P>
<P>
What forecasts are the markets implicitly making now? Never mind the short-term 
forecasts: Nobody knows what may happen over the course of three months, or 
even a year. But over a decade, economic constraints begin to apply. It becomes 
necessary that the forecast made by the market imply feasible paths for the 
balance of payments, foreign debt and so on. So let's look at fairly long-term 
bonds -- specifically, government bonds due in mid-1998. Looking at the 
financial page, we discover that in Japan such bonds yield about 5%, while in 
the United States they yield about 8%. That is, the market is implicitly 
forecasting that over the next nine years the dollar will decline against the 
yen no more than roughly 8% minus 5%, or 3% per year. 
</P>
<P>
Is this possible? No, for at least three reasons. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has higher inflation than does Japan, so it has to have a 
steadily falling dollar just to keep the real exchange rate constant. The 
United States would need a substantially lower dollar even now just to 
stabilize its growing foreign debt, and the steady erosion of what is left of 
U.S. technological superiority requires a dollar that declines over time to 
compensate. 
</P>
<P>
On the inflation issue, the underlying inflation rate in the United States is 
about 5%, while in Japan it is more like 1%. This alone means that if the 
dollar were to decline as slowly as the market apparently expects, the United 
States would become steadily less competitive on costs and prices as time went 
by. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, almost all estimates suggest that the dollar needs to fall 
substantially if the United States is not to have an explosive growth of 
foreign debt. Major international agencies such as the International Monetary 
Fund and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development were 
forecasting widening U.S. deficits after next year even before the recent 
run-up in the value of the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
A recent study by William Cline at the Institute of International Economics, 
using middle-of-the-road numbers, estimated that simply to slow the rate of 
growth of U.S. foreign debt to a sustainable rate -- not to stop its growth, 
which would be much harder -- the yen would have to rise 28% from its late-1987 
level in real terms, implying a dollar-yen rate in current prices of not much 
more than 100. The longer that decline is delayed, the more the dollar must 
drop, because of the growing burden of foreign debt. So the prospect is that 
sooner or later the dollar must fall very sharply in real terms. Yet the 
financial markets seem to believe that it actually can rise. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, when looking at the dollar-yen rate it is impossible to avoid the 
broader issues of competitiveness. Who can look at recent experiences without 
being amazed and somewhat depressed by the ability of Japanese firms to hold 
onto their market share and by the timidity and conservatism of U.S. firms 
despite an unprecedentedly weak dollar? In 1980, we thought that U.S. firms 
could be competitive with an exchange rate that, at 1989 prices, would have 
been about 190 yen. In 1989, the Japanese obviously felt quite comfortable at 
130 yen. What do you think the competitive rate will be in 1998? 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone agrees with this diagnosis, of course. Let me mention two excuses 
commonly made for the strength of the dollar and explain why they won't wash. 
</P>
<P>
The first excuse is that of purchasing power parity. Look how cheap everything 
is in America compared to Japan, say the advocates of this view; surely this 
must mean that the dollar is undervalued against the yen and must rise. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that in order to pay its way in the world, a country must pay 
its way on world markets, not impress visiting business people with what a 
bargain it is. That is, the sign of an undervalued dollar would be a convincing 
demonstration that firms considered the United States a highly attractive place 
to produce for world markets, not just to visit. And the plain fact is that 
this is not happening on a large scale. The export boom of 1987-88 has slowed, 
and if there is a rush to export new products from the United States, it is 
happening very quietly. 
</P>
<P>
The other excuse offered for the strong dollar is that its position as a key 
currency somehow means that the usual rules do not apply to the United States. 
The cheap answer is that the dollar's special role may not last long: The yen 
and especially the European Currency Unit (ECU) are rapidly coming to play 
comparable roles. But in any case, the point is nonsense. If a Saudi 
businessman prefers to have a London bank account whose value is indexed to the 
dollar rather than the pound, this does not add to U.S. purchasing power in any 
significant way -- and yet that is all that the special role of the dollar 
really amounts to. 
</P>
<P>
There are other excuses -- blame it all on the Recruit Co. scandal, or the 
power of the Greens, or Tiananmen Square. All of them fail under scrutiny. The 
simple fact is that the current level of the dollar is the result of a market 
that has lost its anchor in reality, in which nobody takes a view more than a 
few months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
None of this says that the dollar must crash tomorrow, or even this year. But 
crash it must, sooner or later. My own image of the exchange market is that of 
one of those cartoon characters who steps off the edge of a cliff and manages 
to walk on air for five or six steps before noticing that there is no ground 
underneath; it's only when he realizes that he is suspended in mid-air that he 
plummets. It's the same with the exchange rate: One of these days the market 
will notice that there is nothing real supporting the dollar, and down it will 
fall.

CULTURE SHOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Concerning your article about the tumultuous shareholder meeting in Tokyo 
involving T. Boone Pickens Jr. and the Koito Manufacturing board ("Pickens, 
Rejected by Koito Directors, Blasts 'Japan Inc.'," June 30): 
</P>
<P>
It appears that Pickens has failed to do his homework about Japanese business 
practices. In his efforts to gain a seat on Koito's board, Pickens should have 
known that boards of directors in Japan are employees of the company who have 
come up through the ranks due to their ability, seniority and age. In Japan, 
directors' seats are not "bought" from outside entities as they often are here. 
Also, Pickens' high profile and demanding demeanor destroyed the harmony that 
must prevail in any Japanese relationship. 
</P>
<P>
His remarks of not being able to become a director because he "was not 
Japanese" and his speech full of "political overtones" is reminiscent of Archie 
Bunker. Further, Pickens' comment about the Koito shareholders meeting being 
"the most unusual shareholder meeting I have ever attended in my life" again 
shows his lack of understanding of Japanese business practices. He has only to 
look out the windows of his hotel to see those American firms that have taken 
the time to learn the Japanese way of doing business and have been successful. 
</P>
<P>
It appears Pickens has received incorrect information from his advisers. He is 
also acting like a spoiled child who didn't get his own way. If Pickens doesn't 
learn soon how to do business in Japan, his opportunities there may soon be 
known as "Slim Pickins."

AIDS HYSTERIA: OUTBREAKS OF BAD LAW AND THE BAGGING OF BODIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michael Kirby, Michael Kirby, a member of the World Health Organization's 
Global Commission on AIDS, is president of the Court of Appeal of the Supreme 
Court of New South Wales, Australia. His article is adapted from the July issue 
of Daedalus magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are limits on what the law can and should do in response to AIDS. It 
never ceases to surprise me how otherwise intelligent people (including some 
lawyers) assume that when society has a problem, all it need do is make new law 
and the problem will be solved. 
</P>
<P>
But obedience to a law, even if everyone is familiar with it, cannot be 
assumed. The law may entirely miss its mark because of ambiguity or sanctions 
that cannot be enforced. Want of resources, discriminatory prosecution or 
ineffective design of enforcement mechanisms frequently torpedo a law that 
looked fine when first passed but just did not work on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Our objective in proposing new laws on AIDS must be to contain the epidemic. 
Australian Health Minister Dr. Neal Blewett has a clear criterion for 
AIDS-related measures. I take it as my text: "Whether it will or will not 
impede the spread of the disease, whether it will be productive or 
counterproductive in containing the dissemination of the virus; any action, 
however well intentioned, which impedes efforts to monitor, contain and assess 
the spread of the disease should be rejected." 
</P>
<P>
The policies adopted to cope with earlier epidemics lie in the history books as 
warnings about human pain and cruelty but, above all, about general 
ineffectiveness. The best-known administrative measure of earlier times, 
quarantine, is said to have been developed in 14th-Century Italy. Such 
isolation was followed by the temporary removal of suspects, the creation of 
plague barriers, the use of purifying fires in public places and vicious 
actions against minorities who were already stigmatized by factors other than 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
King Philip of France ordered the extraction of the tongues of all blasphemers. 
He believed, ever so sincerely, that blasphemy had brought the bubonic plague 
on his country. 
</P>
<P>
Reporting, incarcerating, disenfranchisement, privation and deprivation of 
civil rights have been the usual legal companions of infections over the 
centuries. As late as 1832 in Paris, numberless innocent people stricken with 
cholera were lynched by fearful mobs. 
</P>
<P>
In this age of computer science and biotechnology, can we do better? Only if we 
acknowledge the limited function of law as a response to AIDS and realize that 
laws will not be effective until they are based on good data concerning the 
nature of AIDS and the precise conduct that encourages or diminishes 
transmission. We must recognize the counterproductive effects of laws that 
limit the supply of condoms or the availability of sterile needles. 
</P>
<P>
We may decide that we prefer a society that clings to the ideals of sexual 
chastity to a society that teaches young school children explicitly about the 
dangers of AIDS and facilitates the provision of condoms to all who want them. 
We may prefer prosecuting the "war on drugs" rather than legalizing the 
provision of sterile needles or bleach to users at risk. But we should do so 
with our eyes open. 
</P>
<P>
A frightened community concerned about the spread of a dangerous virus may be 
impatient indeed with the human-rights context. But any review of law on this 
subject which ignores human rights will be empty of principle. 
</P>
<P>
There is no human right to spread a deadly virus, whether knowingly or 
recklessly. The right to the protection of life is primary. But it must be 
achieved with the protection of other relevant human rights, such as the right 
to privacy, the right to marry and found a family, the right to work and the 
right to freedom from inhuman or degrading treatment. We must harmonize legal 
reponses with fundamental values that will endure even after the AIDS peril has 
been overcome. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible that in some places knowingly spreading HIV to another person -- 
or being recklessly indifferent to the consequences of sexual or other conduct 
-- already violates general provisions of criminal law. Such conduct might 
amount to murder, manslaughter or assault occasioning grievous bodily harm. 
Calls are now being made for the provision of specific criminal offenses 
permitting courts to penalize the deliberate or reckless spread of this lethal 
virus. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to such calls, a number of states in Australia and the United States 
have enacted laws to provide a specific penalty in the case of unprotected 
sexual intercourse by an infected person. Such law does not prohibit an 
infected person from having sexual intercourse. It applies the law's sanction 
for failing to inform and secure the consent of the other person. 
</P>
<P>
All such laws should be seen as having a symbolic rather than a practical 
value. Proof and enforcement would be extremely difficult. The offender may be 
dead or very ill by the time of prosecution. Proof that he or she caused the 
infection may be next to impossible. Moreover, such laws may have a 
counterproductive effect, even though unintended. If an element in such crimes 
is knowledge of one's own HIV status, the law may actually discourage persons 
from taking the HIV test, particularly if there are provisions for reporting 
persons who prove positive. 
</P>
<P>
Quarantine laws are generally categorized as civil rather than criminal, yet 
they may impose restrictions on individual freedom as severe as penal laws. 
Sometimes they do so without the protections typically built into criminal 
process. 
</P>
<P>
So far, only Cuba has a specific law to quarantine persons with HIV infection. 
Such a law would be unjust and ineffective in the most developed nations. The 
antibody test does not disclose all who are infected. It would be difficult, if 
not impossible, to provide resources to house, feed, guard and isolate all such 
persons. The impact of removing from an economy people with 8, 10 or more years 
of valuable contribution would be crippling. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the target of laws and policies should be the behavior that spreads 
the risk, not the individual as such. Laws focused on individuals or groups may 
carry the risk of unjust discrimination or may be too heavy-handed in their 
operation. That is why a general policy of quarantine has been described, 
rightly in my view, as a brutal and unrealistic approach to the containment of 
HIV. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, calls for quarantine and identification of the infected will 
become more common as the infection spreads. In a number of jurisdictions, 
already existing powers of quarantine have been enhanced and made specific to 
include AIDS. Fortunately, lessons have been learned from the ways communities 
earlier tackled syphilis, also a potentially lethal sexually transmissible 
disease. An English Royal Commission report in 1913 made the point that the 
public health objectives of identifying the infected, counseling them and 
giving them such treatment as was available were more likely to contain the 
disease than were punishment and quarantine. As with syphilis, so with AIDS. 
Winning the support of those who bear the burden of infection and modifying 
their behavior is the strategy that offers most promise at this time, at least 
in developed countries. 
</P>
<P>
Many jurisdictions have enacted laws to provide screening for the presence of 
HIV. China, for example, has recently extended its compulsory testing to all 
foreigners who apply to live in the country for more than six months. Many 
other countries, particularly those reporting a low incidence of AIDS and HIV, 
have drawn up similar laws. 
</P>
<P>
One of the trickiest problems AIDS presents to lawmakers is that groups 
initially infected with the HIV virus in developed countries were already 
stigmatized and, in some sense, outcast. I refer to homosexual or bisexual men, 
intravenous drug users and prostitutes. In Australia, public opinion polls 
suggest wide support for mandatory testing of such groups. 
</P>
<P>
Democratically elected governments, under the pressure to do something in the 
face of a major epidemic, may be tempted to legislate against particular 
groups. Migrants, prisoners, drug users and prostitutes, in particular, lack 
effective voice to dissuade lawmakers from making laws discriminating against 
them. To test migrants but not tourists would seem unjustifiable, since the 
latter may indeed have greater exposure to AIDS. Testing prisoners without 
making arrangements for their care if found to be HIV-positive is pointless. 
Yet in prisons around the world, compulsory testing is now increasing.

Sadly, hysteria can generate pain for the dying and the grieving. In New South 
Wales, regulations require that a person known to have AIDS -- or reasonably 
suspected to have suffered it -- be placed at time of death in double plastic 
bags, heat sealed, with the words "Infectious Disease-Handle with Care" placed 
on the body. This procedure only exacerbates grief, betraying the right of a 
deceased person not to disclose the nature of his illness. There is no 
scientific basis for the regulation. AIDS is not transmitted by handling a 
body. The regulation was, I regret, nothing more than response to a trade-union 
demand grounded in irrational fear. We will see many more such laws before this 
epidemic is over. 
</P>
<P>
An Australian judge once said that the law "limps after medicine . . . at the 
rear of the line." For the health of society and the practical containment of 
AIDS and HIV, that is where I would generally keep the law for the present. 
Overenthusiasm in enacting laws on AIDS may make some people feel better, but 
such laws will have precious little impact on controlling the epidemic. For the 
time being, control in countries like Australia and the United States depends 
primarily on community and individual education. That may seem a strange 
conclusion for a lawyer to reach. But I am sure that it is right.

MINUS A GOVERNMENT, ITALY VOTES FOR EUROPE

The longer a foreign observer lives in Italy the more difficult it is to 
account for the Italians. Familiarity breeds black holes in one's sense of the 
national fabric. Why, for instance, did 88% of the adult population go to the 
polls last month to vote for their representatives in the European Parliament 
at Strasbourg? (How many Italians know precisely where Strasbourg is?) 
</P>
<P>
That turnout was about two or even three times greater than in the 11 other 
countries voting, including those such as Britain and Denmark, with longer 
democratic traditions. And why did 88% of the voting Italians also vote "yes" 
in a referendum asking if they favored strengthening the powers of that distant 
Parliament, to include drafting a constitution destined to become the supreme 
law for everyone in the European Community? 
</P>
<P>
The big question is why Italians are so gung-ho for a united Europe, itself a 
notion not yet clearly defined beyond the dropping of barriers affecting 
customs, goods and people. 
</P>
<P>
Some answers will be hazarded. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-one years ago most Italians (and all Italian women) voted virtually for 
the first time in a democratic election, and in those early years the turnout 
was 92%. Since "civic duties" are not taught here in school -- and probably 
seldom at home -- the number of voters can perhaps be explained by the fact 
that those who fail to vote in any election may be branded on the "certificate 
of good conduct" everyone must have to apply for some civil service jobs. 
</P>
<P>
While life was admittedly less complicated when Benito Mussolini decided 
everything, Italians have continued to vote with the same conviction that takes 
them into a church for baptisms, weddings and funerals. It is the thing to do. 
Meeting obligations, and little more, in the polling stations may also explain 
why the Italians so seldom switch politicial parties, even with a vast choice 
of about 12 parties on each ballot. 
</P>
<P>
When those 40 million Italians voted in June they had been without a government 
of their own for exactly one month. Prime Minister Ciriaco De Mita and his 
five-party coalition cabinet had resigned, causing no excitement, much less 
panic. The political leaders solemnly announced that the new government 
"crisis" would be "difficult and long" and they were right. All of the resigned 
cabinet ministers have remained in their offices during the hiatus and no one 
so far has noticed the difference. 
</P>
<P>
Could it be that after 47 governments in nearly 45 years, Italians hanker for a 
big change -- namely, collective rule with 11 foreign countries with whom they 
share so little in common? Do they reckon, perhaps, that a government dominated 
by friendly aliens might be better, or at least not worse? 
</P>
<P>
To hear the citizens talking about "1992" as if it were a magic number fills a 
friendly visitor with foreboding. (By 1992 they really refer to Jan. 1, 1993, 
when all those barriers are expected to drop.) 
</P>
<P>
Italians may be right, for example, in thinking that banking will be better. 
You can be sure that people with small checking accounts will switch to, say, 
German or British banks when they open for business here, so shoddily do the 
Italian banks now treat their clients. And a Danish dentist who decides to hang 
his shingle here -- where the sun shines almost every day and where schools of 
dentistry were first opened only five years ago -- could expect a waiting list 
of eager patients. 
</P>
<P>
But what about Italy's art treasures? Even though thousands of artworks are 
routinely stolen in Italy each year, usually on commission, this country is 
still custodian for about 60% of the entire Western art heritage. The 
regulations for 1993 say that "goods" may circulate freely within the 12 
countries. Then, if an Italian painting is sold to someone in France, will the 
French guard against legal or illegal exportation to Tulsa or Tokyo? One must 
assume that proper precautions will one day be taken but, few Italians so far 
have expressed much concern. 
</P>
<P>
Italian interest in the European Parliament did not stop voters from electing 
candidates known to have no intention of setting foot in Strasbourg more than a 
couple of times -- or not at all -- during the next five years. Most party 
leaders ran for office and won. This means that their salaries as 
parliamentarians in Rome -- $6,500-a-month, plus perks -- double when they sign 
on the good ship Europa as well. 
</P>
<P>
There have been enterprising Italian politicians who were members of a city 
council, members of the Italian Senate and members of the Strasbourg Parliament 
-- all simultaneously. No one thinks any less of them for being that clever. 
</P>
<P>
There is a faint suspicion that some wily Italians already regard Europe as a 
gravy-train and they want to become its conductors. There is also a curious 
dichotomy between what Italians think they want, or expect to get from Europe, 
and what their own politicians back home are doing for Europe. 
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has been whooping like a Wagnerian 
soprano about Italy's delinquent record as a European partner, including the 
fact that milking cows on the island of Sicily have been getting subsidies from 
the European Community chest. Meanwhile, the Rome government admits that about 
40% of the value-added tax, which pays for the Community, is artfully dodged by 
Italians. 
</P>
<P>
One of Italy's permanent commissioners in European Community administration, 
Carlo Ripa di Meana, allows that his country has chosen to ignore 200 Community 
rules, but he also complains about the people who tally up those shortcomings, 
claiming them to be motivated by "ruthless" obstinacy. 
</P>
<P>
Italians are not great newspaper readers; they may not know the sorry facts -- 
or they may not care to know them. Directives from above, like laws, are made 
to be circumvented when they no longer can be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the strangest aberration in the Italian choices for the European 
Parliament was the election of two candidates from the Lombard League. Lombardy 
is the Italian region bordering on Switzerland. The League advocates liberating 
Milan and the rest of Lombardy from Rome, in order to establish a government of 
federated regions. That government would restrict the number of southern 
Italians who migrate to Lombardy and who thus threaten racial purity. The 
league obviously intends to push its peculiar project from the Strasbourg 
floor, thereby doing more to promote Italy's disintegration than Europe's 
unification.

AN IDENTITY CRISIS INSIDE SOVIET UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger was interviewed late last month by 
writer Marc Ullmann of Paris Match. These are excerpts from that session: 
</P>
<P>
 Ullmann: Can the transformation of communism occur peacefully and can the 
Soviet national state be kept together in more or less historic national 
boundaries? 
</P>
<P>
Kissinger: That is the big question, more important than arms control and many 
other issues of day-to-day diplomacy. The second big question is whether you go 
from a centrally planned economy to a market economy without the turmoil that 
threatens political cohesion. 
</P>
<P>
I don't think anybody knows whether the Soviet nationalism problem is 
manageable. The Russian empire never found a way of governing except by Russian 
domination of the non-Russian population. The difference between the Russian 
empire and the European empire is that the Russian empire is contiguous to the 
Russian population. My instinct is that if it begins to look as if the historic 
Russian empire is disintegrating, there will be an assertion of state 
authority, by the army , the party -- or a combination of both. I do not 
believe they will let it disintegrate without fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Would the Ukraine be a more severe test than the Muslim regions? 
</P>
<P>
A: The Muslim populations are the most immediate test, but Soviet leaders may 
still believe that they can balance domination of the Muslim populations with 
local autonomy -- and maybe they can. They may be prepared to make major 
experiments in Muslim areas but will not make the same experiments in the 
Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
In the Baltic republics they are willing to take chances because the Baltic 
peoples are culturally and historically different from the Russian people; 
theoretically the Soviets can experiment with market conditions there without 
risking large migrations of Russians to share in any good economic results. But 
that depends on whether the Baltic countries are satisfied with autonomy and a 
higher standard of living, or whether they will want total independence. That 
is where I suspect the Soviet Union would draw the line. 
</P>
<P>
Q: There are all sorts of experiments in Poland and Hungary; what are the 
limits the Soviet Union can accept there? 
</P>
<P>
A: The potential crisis in European diplomacy is in managing the evolution of 
the East European countries. My instinct is that if these countries should try 
to leave the Warsaw Pact, that would mean an end to Soviet patience. 
</P>
<P>
One can make a case that if the Soviet Union identifies its security with 
communist governments in Eastern Europe, then it assumes a permanent position 
of policeman, subject to crises it does not control. The Soviets would risk all 
their public-opinion achievements in Western Europe if they were driven -- or 
even tempted -- into repression. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, the East Bloc countries should be free to leave the Warsaw Pact. I 
suspect that the best way to approach this is in stages, to say that as part of 
existing arms-control negotiations the Soviets have to withdraw from 
Czechoslovakia and from Hungary but may keep certain forces in East Germany and 
Poland if they commit to evolution toward pluralistic forms that leave those 
countries free to determine their political future. 
</P>
<P>
That still leaves the problem of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). 
In Poland and Hungary it is possible to identify security with national 
independence toward East and West. The German Democratic Republic could not 
survive as a state once the Communist Party accepts minority status. 
</P>
<P>
The West European countries have an interest in peaceful evolution within a 
European context and not a German national context; in a German national 
context it is less likely to be peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
Napoleon once said, "If you want to take Vienna, take Vienna." It follows that 
if you want to conduct foreign policy, conduct foreign policy. So we have to 
solve our foreign policy problems with the Soviet Union. It is naive to believe 
that by intervening, benevolently or not, in Soviet internal affairs we can 
affect foreign policy. Not even the Soviets understand what they are starting. 
</P>
<P>
The future can go in one of two directions. The Soviet Union will disintegrate 
or it will become very strong by succeeding with its economic reforms. If the 
Soviet Union disintegrates, which is not in our interest in my view, there will 
be unforeseeable international consequences. 
</P>
<P>
If perestroika succeeds, it is naive to think the issues that could not be 
settled when the Soviets were weak can be settled when the Soviets are strong. 
Therefore the basic problem has not changed. The question is whether the 
smaller states on the Soviet periphery can live in equilibrium with that 
colossus of an empire embracing 11 time zones. That problem has never been 
settled. It needs to be settled now. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you see a possibility of a backlash against Mikhail S. Gorbachev reforms 
-- would he lead such a backlash himself? 
</P>
<P>
A: Either could happen. He could try to lead the backlash, and given the 
powerful position he has developed, it's not out of the question. Or they could 
get rid of him. I like him better than any other Soviet leader I have met, but 
I would be careful not to tie Western policy to one Soviet leader. 
</P>
<P>
I believe that should Gorbachev die or be replaced, the next Soviet leader 
would face the same necessities. He might not operate with the same 
psychological skill, but if he were realistic he would have to act in the same 
manner.

JIANG, CHINA'S FACE FOR THE OLD MEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Edward A. Gargan, Edward A. Gargan, a former New York Times correspondent 
now writing a book about China, was in Beijing during the June upheaval. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's new Communist Party chief, Jiang Zemin, is, to read some U.S. press 
accounts: a man cosmopolitan in outlook, at ease with Western investors and 
their business practices -- the leader to steady the ship of state, able to 
carry on policies of economic reform and reinstill confidence in a stable 
China. In the weeks that followed the blood bath in Beijing, this is a picture 
Americans may find reassuring. It is one, however, not shared by the people of 
China. 
</P>
<P>
Two and a half years ago, when students in Shanghai marched through the streets 
carrying pictures of the Statue of Liberty and shouting slogans for democracy, 
Mayor Jiang Zemin reacted with fury. With his authority as mayor, as a senior 
member of the Communist Party, believing he could stifle the demands for 
freedom, he went to Jiaotong University to confront an auditorium packed with 
more than 3,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
Jiang stood at the podium to demand that the students cancel their marches 
through the city. He rambled on, telling the students that China's economic 
reforms were proceeding well, that Shanghai was beginning to prosper as a city. 
What the mayor would not address was the students' insistence that the country 
move toward a more democratic political system. Slowly, then more rapidly, 
hisses and hoots swept the auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
"Who dares to boo once more?" the enraged mayor shouted. There were more boos. 
"You won't listen to me. How about you standing up and speaking instead." 
</P>
<P>
A student rose and pointedly asked why there was no freedom of press in China 
and why, since Jiang had not been elected by the people of Shanghai but 
appointed by Beijing, he thought he had any right to govern. The mayor was 
livid. He demanded to know the student's name and department. It was the 
typical response of tyranny -- refusal to be questioned, to be called to 
account. It was also the response of a man who had failed as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Even as the rest of China's coast was experiencing dramatic economic growth, 
Shanghai's economy was regressing, bogged down by an arthritic bureaucracy and 
political factionalism. Jiang failed so conspicuously that he was replaced last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
At 62, Jiang is considered young for a Chinese leader. But he brings with youth 
no innovative ideas, no freshness to the chamber of octogenarian mandarins who 
control the central party apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
When student protests began anew in Shanghai, Jiang, then the party secretary 
for the city, responded in the thuggish fashion for which he is known among 
Shanghai intellectuals. He pleased Deng Xiaoping and the party elders in 
Beijing by dismissing Qin Benli as editor of the World Economic Herald, a 
path-breaking journal that championed both economic and political reform. That 
Jiang had no formal legal authority to dismiss was, as is true of everything in 
China now, irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
Like Premier Li Peng, Jiang was trained as an engineer in the Soviet Union 
during the Stalin years, an experience that bred belief in both the absolute 
power of the party and the virtues of centralized planning. He benefitted, as 
did the premier, from nepotism. Li Peng was an adopted son of China's first 
prime minster, Chou En-lai; Jiang is a son-in-law of Li Xiannian, China's 
former president and a member of the emergent hard-line old guard. Like Li, 
Jiang did not suffer in the Cultural Revolution; instead, he advanced his 
career in the machine-building industry, demonstrating an ability to thrive in 
a climate of political hysteria and terror. When Deng and his colleagues 
wrested power from the party's extreme left wing and the political winds 
shifted, Jiang deftly adapted to the mood of economic reform. 
</P>
<P>
Jiang's ascendence, intended to project an image of stability, demonstrates in 
fact the fragility of Chinese politics. He possesses no visible strengths of 
his own. He has no strong support within the provincial party apparatus or the 
army. He is detested by intellectuals and unknown by most of the rest of the 
country. He is, as one Chinese now in the United States put it, "just a facade 
for the old men." 
</P>
<P>
By anointing Jiang as party general secretary, Deng and the gerontocracy around 
him have admitted that China is incapable of establishing a coherent political 
order, a system where transition from one era of leadership to another is 
possible, where the institutions of administration and law function independent 
of personal whim. Indeed, it was not the party as an institution, nor the 
government itself, that bloodily repressed the spring democracy movement. It 
was a small coterie of elderly men -- some holding no formal posts -- that 
decided to send the army to Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
Deng, at the head of this clique, bluntly acknowledged that neither the 
Communist Party nor the government wielded any real authority, that only these 
old men exercised power in China. "We still have a large group of veterans who 
have experienced many storms and have a thorough understanding of things," Deng 
told a gathering of military commanders on June 9. "They were on the side of 
taking resolute action to counter the turmoil. Although some comrades may not 
understand this now, they will understand eventually." These old men, Deng, 
Yang Shangkun, Li Xiannian, Chen Yun, Peng Zhen, Bo Yibo, Wang Zhen -- all over 
80 -- run China, not Party Chief Jiang, not Premier Li. 
</P>
<P>
Jiang and Li, the men who are to be the face of China, have proclaimed the 
country stable, the situation returning to normal. Foreign businessmen are 
urged to return and resume operations, continue negotiations on new projects, 
provide new loans, to -- in the words of Zheng Tuobin, minister in charge of 
foreign trade -- "show their commitment to China." To the Chinese people as 
well, the leadership is putting on a show of normalcy. National television 
shows scenes of what purports to be larger harvests of wheat, increased steel 
production, a greater abundance of goods in shops. Normalcy also means new 
arrests, more raids on campuses, executions, a reinvigorated system of 
informing -- on neighbors, colleagues and even relatives. 
</P>
<P>
There are, among the targets of this propaganda, only two real audiences: the 
vast rural population that knows little or nothing of the democracy movement in 
the cities and the foreign business community. Already, foreign factory 
managers, bankers, lawyers are dribbling back to China. At Beijing's airport 
one overhears expressions of confidence from the returning executives, that the 
crisis is over. "Business," they say, "is business." 
</P>
<P>
But the real crisis is yet to come -- the crisis of transition to a new 
generation of Communist Party leaders. Many Chinese who think about their 
country and its future expect this process to be tumultuous. They point to the 
succession struggle following the death of Mao Tse-tung, a swift military coup 
accompanied by arrests and wide-scale purges within the party. They point to 
Deng's inability to arrange for his own succession, how his dissatisfaction 
with the policies and inclinations of his designated successors led him to 
repeated reassertions of his own informal but paramount authority. 
</P>
<P>
As bloody as the suppression of the spring democracy movement was, many Chinese 
intellectuals believe the worst is yet to come. One of them told me in late 
June, "These old men will die and when they die the knives will come out." The 
tragedy is not for the Communist Party, it is for the people of China.

Thanks for your in-depth coverage on China (June 25). The case of a 
gerontocracy turned "gerontocrazy" reminds me of the ancient Roman Senate, 
so-called for being made of "senes" or senescent members. A graphic Latin 
saying characterizes that citadel of power for all ages and cultures: 
"Senatores, boni viri; senatus, mala bestia" (The senators, decent guys; the 
senate, a wild beast.)

Your special report on the tragic events in China was heart-rending ("The 
Shattered Dream: China/1989," June 25), but I hope that your readers gave 
careful attention to the remarks by former President Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
Equally curious, at least in my view, was the absence of any editorial or Op-Ed 
coverage (noting) this day in history: On June 25, 1950, the North Korean Army 
launched a surprise attack that initiated that Korean action, whatever you 
would like to call it. To those on the ground, it sure seemed like a war. 
</P>
<P>
While it's fine for us to have a memorial, the real memorial is a strong, 
vibrant Korean society. Its politics may be flawed, but it is in sharp contrast 
to the events on the mainland of China or the mess that was left in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps you are saving coverage of the Korean "action" for the 40th anniversary 
next June. For my part I trust that I'll be able to revisit Korea, go to the 
"truce line" and make some appropriate gesture to the North Korean communists, 
who are no less cruel and brutal than their Chinese, Vietnamese and Russian 
brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Peace, freedom and democracy are easy words to throw out, but must be defended 
by blood, sweat and tears when necessary.

In the interest of fairness, The Times has gone too far! Paul Conrad's cartoon 
(June 11) of former President Nixon eating a joker from a deck, and titled "The 
China Card" -- well, that had credibility. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes the former President himself in Opinion with his defense of China's 
leadership for its mainland misdeeds. We have here the penultimate dilemma. The 
nation's prime, geopolitical expert (Nixon) on international behavior 
modification now argues (inadequately) for no reprisals against the People's 
Republic of China. As we all know from readings into the fabled behaviorists' 
"Skinner boxes," animals can be trained to react to external stimuli; even 
negative varieties. 
</P>
<P>
To do nothing, as per President Bush's weak response and Nixon's reaction, will 
modify nothing -- all in the name of letting "boys be boys" to retain their 
internal domestic control of that political system. Balderdash!

YELLOWSTONE AND THE GRAY WOLF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Wayne Owens (D-Utah) has joined with the conservation organization 
Defenders of Wildlife in sponsoring legislation that would implement the 
deadlocked federal plan to reintroduce the gray wolf to Yellowstone National 
Park. The proposal deserves speedy congressional approval and should eliminate 
any further hesitation by the Department of the Interior in carrying out the 
wolf recovery plan in Yellowstone -- as it actually is required to do now under 
the Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
The Interior Department has balked because of the opposition of a handful of 
senators and House members from Rocky Mountain states who are representing the 
interests of alarmed stockmen in areas of Wyoming, Idaho and Montana that 
border Yellowstone. But the wolf restoration program has picked up some 
powerful supporters in the last year or so, including Idaho Sen. James A. 
McClure, the ranking Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources 
Committee and a longtime opponent of most progressive conservation and 
wilderness legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Defenders of Wildlife and Owens may not have a deal the ranchers will find 
irresistible, but the stockmen should find it difficult to be so stubbornly 
opposed to the wolf program now. Defenders of Wildlife has established a 
private foundation to compensate ranchers for any sheep or cattle lost because 
of the wolf recovery program. The fund would be publicly administered, somewhat 
like the one that has been in operation for some time in northern Minnesota, 
which has the largest wolf population in the lower 48. The Owens bill 
woulddirect the secretary of the interior to complete an environmental impact 
statement on the wolf recovery program by the end of 1991, to make a decision 
on the recovery program within 60 days after that and then implement the 
decision within six months. The bill authorizes the secretary to give financial 
assistance to the states of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho to help administer state 
wolf conservation and management plans. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 wolves lived in the 2.2-million-acre Yellowstone in the early 
1900s before the government started a systematic plan of killing them by 
shooting, trapping and poisoning. The wolf was wiped out by the 1920s. Idaho's 
McClure is correct in saying, in an interview in the Defenders of Wildlife 
magazine, that the eradication of the wolf has upset the natural balance in 
Yellowstone and, among other things, led to the overpopulation of elk in the 
park. One result was the very high death rate of elks in Yellowstone this past 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
McClure said that wolves were eliminated by man unnaturally. "If we can 
reintroduce them in a way that minimizes conflict with man and man's raising of 
livestock, then I think we have accomplished something," McClure said. The plan 
proposed by Owens and Defenders of Wildlife would do just that. But the 
Department of the Interior does not have to wait for Congress to act. With the 
conservationists pledging to pay for any steer or lamb killed by a wolf, and 
with people like McClure in agreement, the department should feel confident 
enough to move ahead with the recovery program immediately.

THE POLES' REAL HERO IS AMERYKA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BD Andrew Nagorski is a senior associate of the Carnegie Endowment for 
International Peace. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Poles have a longstanding love affair with Ameryka. President Bush will 
revel in the outpouring of adulation, but Poland's heart was conquered long 
ago. No country in the world is as unabashedly pro-American as the Polish 
People's Republic. 
</P>
<P>
I learned that lesson on my first visit to Poland in 1964. Arriving by 
coincidence on the same day as Robert Kennedy, I followed the crowds to 
Warsaw's huge Old Market Square, which was packed with people. When Kennedy 
emerged from St. John's Cathedral, I found myself literally lifted off my feet 
by the surging crowd chanting "Kennedy, Kennedy." Twice I dangled above ground, 
both exhilarated and frightened. 
</P>
<P>
As a 17-year-old American discovering the land of his parents, I was initially 
reluctant to admit that I was the beneficiary of the fallout effect, not just 
of the magic of the Kennedy name but the deeper magic of the word Ameryka. When 
Poles would solemnly declare that I had the "Kennedy look," something no one 
had ever noticed back home, I chalked it up to their perspicacity. When young 
women flashed dazzling smiles after they heard me described as an Amerykanin, I 
figured that Polish women had much better taste than American high school 
girls. 
</P>
<P>
But soon I had to somewhat sorrowfully admit that other factors were at work, 
since the evidence was just too overwhelming. Ameryka is associated with 
everything positive and far away, and the antithesis of all that is sinister 
and nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Ameryka means wealth and success. Meeting someone who is turned out in fancy 
clothes or drives a new car, a Pole will say: "I see that Ameryka has opened up 
to you." A relative of mine went to a wedding in the countryside, where the 
bride's father muttered as guests heaped on huge helpings of food: "Where do 
they think they are -- in Ameryka?" 
</P>
<P>
Ameryka also means a state of mind, not just of freedom but of civility in a 
society based on constitutional rights that may be more mythological than real. 
If a Pole demands to be treated with respect and talks back to a petty 
bureaucrat, the bureaucrat is likely to bark: "What do you think, that this is 
Ameryka?" The assumption about the meaning of Ameryka is shared by both parties 
in such an exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Successive attempts by Communist officials to discredit their opponents as 
American puppets or agents have backfired. Solidarity's support of American 
economic sanctions against Poland in the wake of the imposition of martial law 
in 1981 was widely applauded, despite the government's efforts to portray 
Washington as the cause of the country's economic disarray. Anti-American 
posters had to be displayed on the inside of shop windows; otherwise, they were 
immediately torn down. 
</P>
<P>
By the last election campaign, Communist officials were tacitly acknowledging 
reality and doing everything to obscure their true affiliation. One Communist, 
an author of several books about the United States, promoted his candidacy by 
posing against a backdrop of American flags. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, Ameryka represents the forces of good versus the all-too-familiar 
forces of evil at home and across the Soviet border. When Ronald Reagan began 
speaking of "the evil empire," Poles were ecstatic that finally an American 
President was echoing what they had been saying all along. 
</P>
<P>
When West Germans took to the streets to protest the deployment of American 
medium-range missiles, Poles contemptuously dismissed their concerns. "Better a 
Pershing than a Soviet soldier in your back yard," they were fond of saying. 
</P>
<P>
If Poles are sometimes disillusioned with American leaders, they can act like 
lovers scorned. That is why Franklin D. Roosevelt, who is blamed for handing 
over their country to Stalin at Yalta, arouses such wrath. But even presidents 
who are perceived as weak -- Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter -- were greeted 
enthusiastically on their visits to Poland. Americans may be considered 
bumbling or naive at times, but any gesture of support is more than 
reciprocated. 
</P>
<P>
John F. Kennedy and Reagan, who are seen as living up to Polish expectations, 
are adored. On a visit to Poland last year, I frequently encountered the 
question: "Is it really impossible for Reagan to run for a third term?" 
Whatever his record on other issues, Poles are firmly convinced that his 
willingness to stand up to the Kremlin greatly strengthened their struggle for 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
By serving as Ronald Reagan's vice president and visiting Poland in 1987, Bush 
guaranteed himself the welcome he is getting. But, Mr. President, a bit of 
advice that should not be taken amiss: They love you more for what you 
represent than for who you are.

INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IS THE ROUTE INTO MANNED SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KARL G. HARR JR., Karl G. Harr Jr., former national security coordinator for 
President Dwight D. Eisenhower and for many years president of the Aerospace 
Industries Assn., is now a senior fellow at the Eisenhower World Affairs 
Institute.

<P>
In time, and with considerable expense, we can land men and women on Mars. We 
can also establish a permanent manned base on the moon. We are building a 
manned space station. And there are numerous fascinating unmanned missions we 
can undertake. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the cost and time commitments involved in pursuing any of these 
options, we have important decisions to make about our nation's future in 
space. 
</P>
<P>
For those of us who played a role in formulating original U.S. space policy 32 
years ago, considerations today about the future of space evoke strong feelings 
of deja vu. The situation now is vastly different from that of 1957 when 
Sputnik was launched, but the questions and the need to resolve them quickly 
are fundamentally the same. How big should our effort be? How should our 
programs be divided between military and civil? Manned and unmanned? National 
and international? And space exploration's huge cost remains unchanged, causing 
tough choices for any nation contemplating significant space ventures. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, the one great difference lies in changed U.S.-Soviet relations. 
In 1958 and 1959, when the National Security Council Planning Board developed 
from scratch the first national policy on space, we were at the peak of the 
Cold War. The atmosphere between the two nations was hostile, distrustful and 
fearful. We welcomed each other's failures and took great pleasure in "beating" 
the other in one space achievement or another. 
</P>
<P>
Only on the most cosmetic level was there talk of cooperation. Barely beneath 
the surface was a shared fear that the other's space capabilities portended 
important, perhaps, decisive, military capabilities. And in the struggle for 
world leadership, space achievements counted heavily as symbols of national 
advance or decline. 
</P>
<P>
Today, such national security and world leadership concerns remain important to 
both nations, but count for much less. As our sophistication is increasing, our 
mutual paranoia is subsiding considerably. And the rest of the world is no 
longer so closely interested in "who's ahead?" 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Roald Sagdeyev, former director of the Soviet Space Research Institute and 
newly elected People's Deputy, has made it clear that the United States is not 
alone in facing tough decisions about its future in space; such decisions also 
confront the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
So why not cooperate, where we can, under whatever ground rules we are 
comfortable with? 
</P>
<P>
Cooperation can help alleviate the heavy financial pressure on both of our 
space programs. The United States, with its annual appropriations cycle and 
two-year congressional terms, has always felt downward pressure (sure to stay 
strong as long as the high deficit remains). The Soviet Union, more tightly 
controlled, has seemed better able to sustain long-term, high-cost programs. 
But now, with perestroika lagging, it, too, is feeling the pressure of public 
opinion on space expenditures. The Soviets are cutting back on existing 
programs, such as the Mir space station, and re-evaluating others, such as Mars 
exploration. They are also sensitive, Sagdeyev says, to the unnecessary costs 
incurred as a result of our respective programs duplicating one another. 
</P>
<P>
So we both face the choice between cooperating or turning our backs on the 
major challenges in front of us. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of current domestic attitudes toward cooperation on civil space 
exploration, both countries have much to draw on that we never had before. 
Whether or not we can overcome the obstacles to such cooperation is the 
question. 
</P>
<P>
There is, for example, the widely held American view that cooperating with the 
Soviets on non-military space projects will afford them disproportionate gains 
from "technology transfer." While this concern is valid, it is manageable 
because so many measures have been developed to protect against undesirable 
disclosures. 
</P>
<P>
If we can overcome this and other roadblocks, we will have an enormous 
potential joint capability -- scientifically, technologically and economically. 
If we cannot, or choose not to do so, we might as well forget about major 
advancement in space for a long time to come. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, we will have a worthwhile menu of unmanned space missions such as the 
recently launched Magellan probe to Venus, the on-going Project Earth missions 
and the forthcoming Hubble telescope mission. But we will have forgone any 
meaningful manned exploration of the universe, and perhaps even have seriously 
limited our opportunities for unmanned missions. That would be sad given the 
measure of our joint capabilities. And it would be difficult, if not 
impossible, to resuscitate such capabilities once abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
It is time we take a new giant leap in space and, with prudence at every step, 
go with it on an international basis. The exploration of space, to realize its 
full potential, must become an arena of international cooperation.

OUR LUNGS LABOR IN A CHEMICAL SOUP; 
</P>
<P>
ADMINISTRATION'S CLEANUP GOALS ARE LOFTY, BUT LAWS MAY FALL FAR SHORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID D. DONIGER, David Doniger is a senior attorney with the Natural 
Resources Defense Council, a national environmental organization. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the President and Congress debate changes to the Clean Air Act, a toxic 
cloud hangs over America. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually every American is exposed. Tens of millions of people live near 
chemical plants, oil refineries, smelters, coke ovens and thousands of other 
industrial emitters of toxic pollutants. Well over 100 million people living in 
urban areas breathe a deadly "chemical soup" concocted from the emissions of 
factories and motor vehicles, from which they are not protected by conventional 
smog standards. And hundreds of miles downwind from pollution sources, a toxic 
rain contaminates major ecosystems like the Great Lakes, causing severe damage 
to fish and aquatic resources and indirectly endangering public health. 
</P>
<P>
The magnitude of the emissions is staggering. Major industries reported dumping 
nearly 2.7 billion pounds of toxic chemicals into the air during their 
"routine" operations in 1987. At least a comparable amount comes from millions 
of cars, trucks, buses and other urban sources. The Bush Administration puts 
the cancer death toll from these "routine" chemical emissions at 1,500 to 3,000 
people each year. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent report, "A Who's Who of American Toxic Air Polluters," the Natural 
Resources Defense Council identified nearly 4,500 factories in 46 states 
putting more than 360 million pounds of just 11 cancer-causing chemicals into 
the air. Thirty of these facilities reported emissions of 1 million pounds or 
more. The Environmental Protection Agency says there is no known safe level of 
exposure to these chemicals. Yet the EPA has put no curbs on these emissions. 
</P>
<P>
To the cancer deaths must be added the toll of death and injury when "routine" 
operations give way to chemical accidents. More than 11,000 chemical accidents 
have already occurred in the United States in the 1980s, killing 309 people, 
injuring more than 11,300 others and requiring the evacuation of nearly a half 
a million people from their homes, schools and businesses. Seventeen of these 
chemical accidents had the potential to surpass the catastrophe in Bhopal, 
India, where a toxic gas cloud killed more than 3,000. But for the grace of 
good weather and good luck, even more people could have died here. Yet the EPA 
has no program to prevent these accidents. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that people receive their greatest toxic chemical exposure through 
the air -- more than from toxic waste dumps, polluted drinking water or 
contaminated food. The same is true for the environment; well over half the 
toxic contaminants entering the Great Lakes are coming from the air. You drink 
about two quarts of water per day, but you breathe 15,000-20,000 quarts of air 
per day. You have some choice over the water you drink, but you have no choice 
over the air you breathe. It is time to stop treating the atmosphere as the 
nation's largest hazardous waste dump. 
</P>
<P>
There are some signs of progress in Washington. All factions in the clean air 
debate, including President Bush, now agree that toxic air pollution is a major 
public health hazard. As Bush has said, "People who live near industrial 
facilities should not have to fear for their health." 
</P>
<P>
But legislative proposals for curbing toxic air pollution vary greatly. One 
bill, introduced by Reps. Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles), Mickey Leland (D-Tex.) 
Guy V. Molinari (R-N.Y.) and others, would make major strides forward in the 
fight to safeguard the public and the environment. The bill covers the full 
spectrum of toxic air releases, from routine to accidental; the full spectrum 
of sources, from factories to motor vehicles; and the full spectrum of harm, 
protecting resources like the Great Lakes as well as public health. Most 
important, the bill sets deadlines for reducing the added cancer risk from 
factory emissions below one chance in 1 million over a lifetime. One in 1 
million is the EPA's own standard for the acceptable cancer risk for pesticide 
residues on food. There is no reason to tolerate danger that is tens, hundreds 
or even thousands of times greater from chemicals in the air. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, the same praise is not due President Bush's proposal. His goals are 
lofty. In announcing his plan, he said that "the very best control technology 
we have will determine the standards we set for these plants." But all signs 
are that the actual legislative language to be proposed will fall far short of 
requiring "the very best" controls. Worse, instead of solid health protection 
standards, the Administration is proposing a "cost-benefit" test under which 
your life could be forfeit if a government accountant thinks it will cost 
industry too much to save. Furthermore, the President's proposals were totally 
silent on chemical accident prevention and protection of the Great Lakes. There 
is still time, however, for the President to embrace the needed reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Americans are fed up with the assault on their skies and their health. They are 
demanding action as never before. The time for strong action on the Clean Air 
Act is now.

JOURNEY ON A SHIKARA

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even with the sliding lattice-work screens opened on both sides of the narrow 
room, it was an airless night in the Vale of Kashmir. My floating neighbors on 
one side were arguing; on the other, they were celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
Restless, I finally dozed off, only to awaken in a sweat, my father's furious 
voice in my ear. 
</P>
<P>
"You must be crazy!" he bellowed. "Going off with three unknown Muslim men." 
</P>
<P>
My father had been dead 12 years, but I wasn't arguing. How did I get into such 
a situation? 
</P>
<P>
The problem was that a week of paradise was all I could take. That's how long 
I'd been living aboard the houseboat Argonaut. The indolent days had become too 
sweetly contrived, a surfeit of honey. 
</P>
<P>
In the mornings Farouk, a commercial boat guide, would paddle me to the 
vegetable market in his wooden shikara, a long, gondolalike craft he'd named 
the King of Diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
From underneath its gold-tasseled canopy I peered out at a traffic jam of 
market boats piled high with lime-green beans and purple cabbage. 
</P>
<P>
One day we visited Farouk's cousin's papier-mache shop, and on another the 
Shalimar Gardens. After supper he would take me out again, perhaps to watch the 
pink light fade behind the white mosque, Hazratbal. Musk floated in the air, 
cardamom seeds in the tea and flattery was on the lips of every trader. 
</P>
<P>
Everything in Srinagar, a city of 450,000 and the hub of Kashmir's tourist 
business, is for the pleasure of the summer visitors. The tourists' open purse 
is what keeps the economy going through the frozen winter months when Kashmir 
has its beauty all to itself. 
</P>
<P>
On the Argonaut I sank into carpets, leaned into velour cushions and was waited 
on by six men who glided through the rooms as soundlessly as boats through the 
water. Each man mulled over the possibilities for exchange -- and profit -- 
just like Abdul Kalich, one of the Argonaut's staff who sat barefoot in the 
corner of the porch, watching as I studied a map. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul wanted to take me up the Jhelum River to see village life, "the real 
Kashmir." He spread his own map out on the table while I listened. 
</P>
<P>
But I couldn't go alone, I insisted. Others would have to be found. To make it 
a party, I mean. 
</P>
<P>
"No problem," he told me. "I will find someone." 
</P>
<P>
The next day he was all smiles: "Allah is with us. They will come at 7 tonight, 
to talk." 
</P>
<P>
"A couple?" 
</P>
<P>
"No. Two men." 
</P>
<P>
That evening, several local men appeared on our dock and immediately huddled. 
After a bit, Abdul came over and told me that we could leave the "next day." 
</P>
<P>
"I want to meet the others," I said. "Where are they?" 
</P>
<P>
Two Kashmiri youths emerged from the group. 
</P>
<P>
"I am called Nazaramid," the tall one said. "Marajhen," said the younger, shy 
one. 
</P>
<P>
"They are strong paddlers," announced Abdul. "I am guide and cook." 
</P>
<P>
"But where are the other . . . Westerners?" I asked weakly. 
</P>
<P>
"No more room in the boat," said Abdul. "For you, not comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
In slow motion, I began to understand. 
</P>
<P>
In the conversation I had later with my father, just before I went back to 
sleep, I told him not to worry. I was too old for a harem and, besides, I liked 
their faces. 
</P>
<P>
"Go with the flow," my daughters had been telling me for years. 
</P>
<P>
Our excursion would take three nights and proceed up the Jhelum River north 
from Srinagar to Lake Manasbal, Lake Wular, the town of Gandarbal, Lake Anchar 
and home by Lake Nagin and Lake Dal. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Day 1: On the Jhelum River. We embarked the next afternoon with fierce 
swiftness, the boys sitting in the rear, pulling hard, in unison, on their 
heart-shaped paddles. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul Kalich sat in the middle of the 20-foot boat, where he and I were 
separated by a board that served as his serving table and my backrest. A crude 
awning was our roof and yellow curtains were pulled around me, for privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul was in charge. He showed me his kerosene stove, his lantern, the bottle 
water and toilet paper he knew I would ask for. The "facilities" were au 
naturel. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul was 31 years old and the father of two. The place we were headed was his 
home. 
</P>
<P>
In the first hour we passed through Dal Gate and followed the Jehlum west, then 
north. The river was fast. We practically flew downstream under the nine 
bridges of the city, curtains flapping, our necks craning to catch sight of the 
mosques and three-storied brick and wooden houses of the old city. 
</P>
<P>
The houseboats we passed were not for tourists, but were barges called doongas. 
Looking through their open windows, we caught glimpses of bronze pots on the 
wall, quilts piled high and scenes of Kashmiri domesticity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Call to Prayers 
</P>
<P>
From that point on we marked the day by the Muslim Call to Prayers. At 4:30 
p.m. a man on the left bank turned to the east and threw himself forward onto 
the ground. The sun was low and hot on the river, which smelled putrid. 
</P>
<P>
By 6:30 dusk moved in and Abdul was cooking. The paddlers slowed down, and we 
all drank beer and listened to a tape of Indian music. From a mosque hidden in 
the trees nearby the 7:30 call interrupted and put our day to rest. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul lit our lantern and, across the board between us, passed a white napkin 
and silverware, a plate of curried mutton stew, rice, tiny cubed carrots with a 
touch of chili and one perfect banana for desert. In the stern the crew ate a 
spicier version and talked in their own language. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward I chose to sleep in the boat rather than on shore. Abdul asked if he 
could put his bag down in front with me so that the boys could have more room 
in the back. 
</P>
<P>
Feet to head, each wrapped in our own thoughts, we faced a noisy night on the 
river: the whimpers of the baby next door settling down, then, from the woods, 
the "Late Show" dog chorus. 
</P>
<P>
In the deepest part of the night I parted the curtains to look out at a new 
moon and bright stars. 
</P>
<P>
Day 2: Much too soon, a fervent 4:30 a.m. song to the new day rose over the 
water. It was light when we moved out on a snaky path through a shaded canal, 
across a garden of water lilies into cool, clear, deep Lake Manasbal, where I 
put on my tank suit and dived over the side. 
</P>
<P>
This seemed to embarrass my male guides; too much show of skin, I suspected. 
Kashmiri women bathe fully dressed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paddling Furiously 
</P>
<P>
Over breakfast of fresh fish I admired Abdul's cool cotton drawstring pants and 
floppy shirt. In no time the boys were paddling again furiously, this time to 
the dressmaker. 
</P>
<P>
Five men sat in a closet high off the dirt lane selling soap, sugar and fabric. 
Abdul, the interpreter and tastemaker, suggested a conservative gray and white 
print. With this material under my arm, we moved on to the shop with the sewing 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
In another closet I was measured, while many eyes watched. My Kashmiri dress 
would be ready the next day. Would I take a picture for them? A rush of men 
crowded upstairs to carry the bedridden patriarch down to sit for a portrait 
with his sons and grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon we visited Abdul's village of Hajhen. At a place that looked 
like all the others we moored on the river and walked through the woods, 
emerging on a dirt main street. I met the schoolteacher, who greeted me, 
jubilantly, in phrase-book English: "I hope you enjoy your visit to Hajhen." 
</P>
<P>
I took dozens of pictures of men grinning insanely before the interiors where 
they worked. It was a boisterous hour, the first one in Kashmir where no one 
asked for anything. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not a poor village," Abdul said. "We have some brick houses." 
Nevertheless, during the tourist season, Abdul must leave his family and travel 
to Srinagar to work on the houseboats. It had been two months since he'd seen 
Nura and their children. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul lives in his mother-in-law's house across the lane from the river, behind 
a willow fence, through a gate and into a mud courtyard he shares with a cow, a 
goat and some chickens. 
</P>
<P>
When we arrived it was twilight, and a clap of hands sent someone to spread out 
a carpet in front of the house. A quilt was laid over the carpet, and on top of 
the quilt was a pillow. I was motioned toward it, and Abdul came to sit beside 
me. Another hand clap brought his 7-year-old son with the hookah water pipe for 
his father. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Served Spicy Tea 
</P>
<P>
After a while the boy's mother-in-law came to sit beside me. From the outdoor 
kitchen we were served spicy tea and nan bread. 
</P>
<P>
Then, one by one, the women of the house took turns coming to sit with me. Nura 
could be Abdul's sister; it was the same face. She was five months pregnant and 
carrying a feverish 2-year-old on her hip. 
</P>
<P>
I met many cousins, some of the 13 people who sleep in the four rooms of the 
house. To cover what I took as awkward silences, I attempted small talk -- 
praising Abdul's omelets and asking questions. 
</P>
<P>
But my hosts had no such compulsions. Mostly, we sat in what Kipling called the 
"uncounted Eastern minutes," watching night fall on the river. 
</P>
<P>
Snatches of conversation echoed through the courtyard and interrupted the 
wheeze of the hookah. Abdul inhaled deeply, anxiously cradling his pale 
daughter as we settled into the muggy darkness together, whacking away at the 
first mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
Day 3: When I awoke in the boat the next morning, some senses told me that I 
was not alone. Pulling back the curtains, I found a dozen children waiting for 
me to get up. On stage, brushing my teeth over the side, I tried to keep white 
drips off my chin. Indians at their morning toilets discreetly rubbed twigs 
between their teeth. 
</P>
<P>
We made a quick backtrack to the boutique to collect my pantsuit. After I 
emerged from my dressing space, many cheered, and I sat lighter in the boat, 
with my wide, soft trousers as flimsy and yielding as the summer breezes. 
</P>
<P>
By then it was clear that we wouldn't be camping out in tents. The shikara -- 
cleaner, cooler, drier than the earth and supplying us with rations and 
protection from the creatures of the night -- became our refuge from the 
struggle for survival. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by Struggle 
</P>
<P>
We saw the struggle all around us. In the morning mist, men crowded into their 
shikaras, dredging the silt, which they used as a building material, from the 
river bottom. 
</P>
<P>
One man stood, poling; another, with a long-handled shovel, dug, while a third, 
who held a strong cord attached to the shovel, was the human pulley who lifted 
the shovel toward the mountain of mud rising in the center of the boat. 
</P>
<P>
We saw young women fishing with their feet on the shallow bottom for twigs 
brought in by the current; they would dry these and use them for kindling. We 
watched a stream of young girls race along the river banks, heading for home 
with baskets of grass on their heads, some weighing as much as 15 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
On our last night on the river, not quite in the dark, I asked Abdul about his 
arranged marriage. He was 20 and his father was dead, he said, when his older 
brother told him he had found the perfect wife for him. 
</P>
<P>
Unconvinced, he got her name and village, took the next day off from work and 
went to her village. "Who is this Nura?" he asked. When she was pointed out, he 
approached her and managed a casual conversation. Suddenly suspicious, she 
wanted to know, "Who are you anyway, taking my time?" 
</P>
<P>
"I am your husband." 
</P>
<P>
Her face went red and she ran away in a rage, screaming back at him, "No you're 
not!" 
</P>
<P>
"I liked her too much," was the way he put it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Sound Sleep 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, before the ceremony, they saw each other for a year, but never 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not like in America," Abdul said. "She must stay home and not let other 
men see her." 
</P>
<P>
I slept soundly that night. After three days up the Jhelum looking for the real 
Kashmir I had become conditioned -- to the dogs, the mosquitoes, the rocking of 
the shikara, even to the kick in Abdul's nocturnal nightmare, which I responded 
to with an automatic, wifely kick back. 
</P>
<P>
Even in sleep the consummate trader grinned. He knew he had delivered his 
promises. 
</P>
<P>
It hadn't been so much a linear journey as a step through the curtains to 
backstage, where I had been introduced to the players without their makeup. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul's kinsmen had not charmed one single cobra for their visitor. They had 
simply offered themselves . . . with the assurance that that would be enough. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Srinagar is 555 miles from Delhi, or about an hour and 10 minutes via Indian 
Air Lines, which has several flights daily. Round-trip price is $154 U.S. 
</P>
<P>
For less money but a lot less comfort, you can cross the Punjab on the 
overnight Jammu Tavi Express from New Delhi ($31.50 for a first-class ticket), 
then continue by bus ($10) the next morning to Srinagar. It's a rugged 
183-mile, 9- to 12-hour journey. 
</P>
<P>
Warning: The Department of State suggests that "because of sporadic incidents 
of political and criminal violence in the Punjab area" travelers should check 
with the American Embassy in New Delhi before traveling through this area. Air 
travel is thus recommended. A regular Indian visa is all that's needed. 
</P>
<P>
Best time to visit the Srinagar area is mid-May through September. April and 
October can be nice, too, but it can also be quite rainy. 
</P>
<P>
Many tour operators and travel agencies can arrange Srinagar houseboat stays in 
advance. I paid about $20 a day. Planning a shikara trip up the Jhelum River 
into the Sindh Valley is best undertaken after arrival in Srinagar. 
</P>
<P>
Ask your houseboat owner or inquire at the Tourist Reception Centre. Look for a 
guide who really knows the villages; you don't want to just paddle by. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartan voyage I took was arranged solely between Abdul Kalich and me. Like 
many houseboat employees he operates such trips on the side. Abdul arranged for 
the boat, hired the paddlers and bought and cooked the food. I paid about the 
same as I did on the houseboat, $20 a day. 
</P>
<P>
If you make arrangements this way, be sure to define precisely what is included 
and what is not. Make no assumptions. Pay only a small advance. Ask for 
references and compare services with reputable agencies. Bargaining is 
expected, except with Western suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
Abercrombie &amp; Kent, which has a representative in Srinagar and its head 
office in Delhi, can arrange a deluxe version of the shikara trip -- four days 
and three nights, all-inclusive, for $816 per person, based on double 
occupancy. You'll be in glorious comfort. Contact Abercrombie &amp; Kent in the 
United States at 1420 Kensington Road, Oak Brook, Ill. 60521, toll-free (800) 
323-7308 or (312) 954-2944. 
</P>
<P>
Sita World Travel is another established agency with a representative in 
Srinagar. U.S. address: 767 Fifth Ave., New York 10153, (800) 262-1297 (in 
California) or (212) 759-8979. 
</P>
<P>
What to take on your trip: a black umbrella for sun or rain; insect repellent; 
bottled water or a water bottle with iodine tablets or other purification 
system; dependable flashlight with extra batteries; toilet paper; soap and a 
sleeping bag liner of light cotton flannel. Wear what the Kashmiri wear: loose 
cottons, thongs, lightweight wool in the cool evenings.

CELADON POTTERY LEAVES VISITOR WITH GLAZED LOOK

ICHON, South Korea 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 80 years ago a Korean farmer returning from work noticed a curious object 
half-hidden along a red dirt path near his home. He thought the item was a 
piece of jade -- it had the right texture and color. But once he had picked up 
the curio and rubbed it clean, he found a green ceramic duck instead of a 
precious stone. 
</P>
<P>
The duck was in good condition, and its charming shape showed the whimsical 
intent of its maker. 
</P>
<P>
People in the country had no use for such items, so the farmer went to town the 
next day and sold his prize -- a perfect Koryo Dynasty (AD 935-1392) celadon 
water dropper. 
</P>
<P>
Serendipitous discoveries such as this were almost routine in early 
20th-Century Korea. The story of the duck-shaped calligraphy instrument is not 
unique. It was just one of several finds that exposed a cache of ceramics 
unlike anything the art world has ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
Celadon is to Korea what Sevres is to France, Ming to China and Delft to the 
Netherlands. Until 1910, however, the grayish-green porcelains, symbolic of 
South Korea's Golden Age, remained largely forgotten -- buried in aristocratic 
tombs for about 600 years -- until unearthed when occupying Japanese began to 
dig a network of highways throughout the peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Since their rediscovery Koryo celadons -- items such as water droppers, hair 
ornaments, square pillows, rice bowls, teapots and wine vases -- have delighted 
connoisseurs. 
</P>
<P>
In South Korea's capital of Seoul, merchants lug wooden carts piled high with 
intricate new inlaid maebyongs (vases with a gourd-shaped top) through crowded 
streets of Insa-dong, Seoul's exclusive antique district, where shops show off 
medieval ceramics from water droppers to wine bottles. 
</P>
<P>
A few blocks south in the deluxe hotel region of Myong-dong, expensive 
galleries in underground arcades lure buyers with one or two flawless Koryo 
Dynasty copies. 
</P>
<P>
For a first-time visitor the concentration is dizzying. After a while, however, 
saturation gives way to appreciation. And before you know it, a love affair 
with the soft green ceramics begins. 
</P>
<P>
Part of what distinguishes Koryo celadons is their elegant simplicity. Unlike 
the more flamboyant Mings and Imaris, effects rendered by a celadon maebyong 
are as subtle as a Japanese garden. 
</P>
<P>
The maebyong does not reach out and dazzle the observer as does a Ming; 
instead, it waits. Its appeal stems from an uncontrived balance of color, motif 
and form -- as well as the quiet impression this leaves upon the intellect and 
senses. 
</P>
<P>
South Korea's antique celadons are rare and expensive. Prices vary according to 
quality and demand, but an authentic Koryo Dynasty bowl, even in poor 
condition, is certain to bring $3,000 or more. Foreigners can buy flawed but 
charming antique celadons at Insa-dong galleries. 
</P>
<P>
(You must have government approval if you want to take any curio more than 65 
years old home with you.) 
</P>
<P>
But if it is perfection you want, do not despair. Reproductions crafted in 
mountain kilns using the ancient process make fine substitutes. At city 
galleries and even department stores you can buy copies that rival original 
Koryo ceramics found in the National Museum of Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
But they do not come cheap. Vases from potters such as Chi Sun-t'aek and Yoo 
Keun-hyeong -- both national living treasures -- could cost $8,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
If your schedule permits, there is a less expensive way to acquire a celadon 
souvenir. For one-third the cost and three times the fun, you can travel to a 
country kiln and discover what South Koreans mean by "Chosun" or "Morning 
Calm." 
</P>
<P>
South Korea's most popular pottery region is this mountain village of Ichon -- 
about 20 miles south of Seoul, where famous kilns of Koryo-doyo and 
Haegang-doyo, craft splendid Koryo celadon reproductions. 
</P>
<P>
In early fall, country dwellers string red peppers atop roofs in preparation 
for the kimchi festival (when Korea's staple of hot and spicy pickled cabbage 
is celebrated) as workers push for an abundant celadon harvest before the 
frigid winter sets in. 
</P>
<P>
Ichon's kilns keep busy, and when its storerooms bulge with pots, you can seize 
a masterpiece for a fraction of its gallery value. And better yet, the beauty 
of the Korean countryside is there for the seeing. 
</P>
<P>
Fluffy white clouds cap mountains and pepper hills with shadows as if imitating 
subtle designs on a 12th-Century celadon vase. In the valley, the harvest nears 
and the rice stands tall. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers dressed in white carry heavy loads of produce on their backs and 
gracefully walk red dirt paths as if being carried down terraced hills on a 
wave of grain. 
</P>
<P>
Part of what distinguishes South Korean celadon from that of the Sung Chinese 
lies in these simple pastoral scenes. The graceful lines and sensuous forms 
come from familiar objects -- a melon, a gourd, a bamboo shoot, a reed. The 
spirited motifs -- ducks playing among reeds, cranes soaring through clouds -- 
arise from landscapes lyrical and naive. 
</P>
<P>
Good celadon reproductions follow the same painstaking process of the Koryo 
period. First, the best clays are selected and taken to the kiln site. 
Preparation of the clay is important, for unless a suitably plastic condition 
is achieved, the finished product will appear rough. 
</P>
<P>
Also, without the proper mixture of clays containing kaolin and petuntse, a 
Chinese discovery called the "bones and flesh" of porcelain, celadons would 
crack at the high firing of 1,300 degrees centigrade, and the soft, green glaze 
would never fuse with the body. 
</P>
<P>
Twisting up and down Ichon's mountain roads, you encounter kiln upon kiln. 
</P>
<P>
In one room, an artisan with Popeye-sized forearms throws a slab of gray earth 
onto a spinning wheel and -- presto -- a shape is born. In another, 12-year-old 
apprentices carve intricate designs onto "leather-dried" pots, while older 
artists inlay chiseled crevices with white or black slip, depending upon the 
master potter's whim. The day that storerooms fill with trimmed pots the real 
feat begins -- the glaze. 
</P>
<P>
Of Koryo celadon's three distinguishing features (shape, design and glaze) the 
latter is the most important and the hardest to achieve. It is perhaps the 
delicate serenity of the celadon glaze -- never opaque, always soft and 
transparent -- that most distinguishes the beauty of Koryo pieces. 
</P>
<P>
How a color so lush could emerge from elements as common as flower petals, red 
clay and wood ash is a factory secret. While the precise composition of the 
iron-oxide-based glaze varies from kiln to kiln, all masters share in one 
tradition -- they reveal their formulas only to their heirs. 
</P>
<P>
The best celadons bake in pine-burning kilns that arch like dormers onto 
Ichon's wooded mountainsides. Some reproductions are fired in electric ovens, 
but modern methods, while more predictive, fail to capture the luster of 
medieval Koryo -- especially the soft sparkle caused by melted particles and 
bubbles imprisoned within the glaze. 
</P>
<P>
Master potters preferring ancient ways heat with pine even though only one in 
10 of their intricately prepared pots will survive. Those that do are 
expensive. 
</P>
<P>
If you visit Ichon, you might want to take along a rabbit's foot or two. When 
the kilns begin to smoke, a cloud of superstition wafts across the hills. 
</P>
<P>
Believing that spirits reside not only in humans but in natural forces and 
inanimate objects, Korean potters call on ancient shaman symbols to ensure a 
successful outcome. Some hire mudangs (sorceresses) to perform ceremonies 
(kuts) to shake off demons. Others offer food -- pig's heads on tridents -- to 
get good spirits on their side. 
</P>
<P>
Spells notwithstanding, fall firings are festive occasions. Besides good buys 
(especially on pots judged imperfect for gallery sale), Ichon offers insights 
and experiences not shared in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
The best approach to Ichon, 35 miles southeast of Seoul, is via bus tour or 
private car. Your hotel concierge can put you in touch with one of the many 
Korean travel agents who offer day trips to Ichon and nearby Kwangju 
(Kyonggi-do province). 
</P>
<P>
If you are not the bus-tour type, a chauffeur-driven car can be arranged 
through your hotel. Most car-rental agencies, such as Seoul's Hertz-affiliated 
Daehan Rent-a-Car, provide drivers. The daily rate (10 hours) for driver and 
car is $80, plus tolls for the first 77 miles. After that, the rate changes to 
50 cents a mile, plus $6 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
While foreigners can obtain rental cars without drivers, most do not -- 
especially when traveling outside Seoul. Country road signs are only in Korean, 
so persons not fluent in Hangul are advised to pay the modest chauffeur's fee. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 kilns are spread out along the Kwangju-Ichon highway. Most feature 
showrooms in addition to factories. The most famous are Chi Sun-t'aek's at 409, 
Sugwang-ri Shindun-myon, Ichon, and Yoo Keun-hyeong's at 323-4, Sugwang-ri, 
Shindun-myon, Ichon. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to pottery, Ichon is noted for its hot springs. Just off the main 
highway at 313-5-Anhung-ri, Ichon-up, is the town's famous resort spa -- Hotel 
Seol Bong. 
</P>
<P>
Besides offering some of Korea's best spa facilities, the hotel features both 
Western and Korean cuisine.

World Travel Watch is a monthly report designed to help you make informed 
judgments about travel throughout the world. Because conditions can change 
overnight, always make your own inquiries before you leave home. In the United 
States contact the nearest passport agency office; abroad, check in with the 
nearest American embassy. 
</P>
<P>
Asia 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tibet: Tibet has reopened to foreign travelers, but only to groups of 10 or 
more. Special permits are required and must be obtained a month in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 -- China: In view of the recent military crackdown on pro-democracy 
demonstrators and continuing unsettled conditions, travel here is not 
recommended at this time. 
</P>
<P>
Africa 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mauritania: A 10 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew remains in effect in Nouakchott, 
Nouadhibou and Rosso as a result of street violence and looting in May. Air 
traffic in and out of Nouakchott has been curtailed. Avoid unnecessary travel 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Senegal: Avoid travel in the northern region, between the cities of St. 
Louis and Bakel due to unsettled conditions along the Mauritania border. 
</P>
<P>
Middle East 
</P>
<P>
 -- Iraq: All foreigners staying more than five days must prove they are free 
of the AIDS virus, either by submitting to a test at Iraq's National Laboratory 
in Baghdad or by having a test completed, notarized and then certified by state 
and federal authorities in the United States before departure. For more 
information, contact the U.S. Department of State Authentications Office at 
(202) 647-7734. 
</P>
<P>
Europe 
</P>
<P>
 -- East Germany: When driving West German rental cars in East Germany, be sure 
to keep in your possession the car's certificate of ownership and international 
insurance card. They will be required on entry and in the event of an accident. 
Don't leave them in an unattended vehicle. Driving laws are strictly enforced. 
Don't drink at all when driving, and don't speed. Fines are collected 
immediately at the rate of about $5 per kilometer over the speed limit. The 
hard currency of choice in East Germany is the deutsche mark. 
</P>
<P>
 -- West Germany: Authorities recently announced tightened security at 
Frankfurt Airport due to a continuing investigation of a terrorist group active 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Soviet Union: Aeroflot, the world's largest airline, recently recognized 
the need to implement Western-style marketing to offset its reputation for bad 
service. Plans are being made for an advertising campaign in U.S. media. 
</P>
<P>
Unrest continues in several parts of Soviet Asia, most recently in Uzbekistan 
and Kazakhstan. Such unrest stems from a combination of ethnic tension, rising 
population, pollution, lack of consumer goods and job shortages. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the vast stretch of Soviet territory encompassing 148 nationalities 
and underdevelopment throughout much of the country, such unrest is likely to 
continue sporadically and may also erupt in other regions that have been 
peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
South America 
</P>
<P>
 -- Paraguay: A cultural explosion has followed on the heels of political 
reform with the removal from power of dictator Alfredo Stroessner. Comics are 
lampooning politicians and art galleries are displaying long-hidden paintings 
depicting torture and oppression. Free expression, suppressed for 35 years, is 
booming. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Venezuela: The main runway at Maracaibo's La Chinita International Airport 
is closed for repairs through September and possibly through November. Flights 
are being rerouted to an alternate runway, but flights may be suspended as the 
work progresses. Check to see if your flight has been rerouted or canceled. 
</P>
<P>
Central America 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nicaragua: A visa is required of all U.S. citizens and must be obtained at 
a Nicaraguan consulate before arrival. 
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asia 
</P>
<P>
 -- Burma: A recent demonstration in Rangoon in which troops fired on and 
killed one protester confirms that authorities are maintaining a hard line 
against the pro-democracy opposition, which was violently suppressed last 
September. Future unrest appears likely. Exercise caution. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have changed the country's name to the Union of Myanmar, and 
Rangoon's name to Yangon. The changes were implemented to better reflect the 
country's ethnic diversity by encompassing all minority groups, but critics say 
the term Myanmar has long referred only to the ethnic Burmans of the plains, so 
the change is no change at all. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Singapore: A new law taking effect this month imposes fines as high as $500 
for failing to flush public toilets after use. The law applies to all public 
facilities, including those in hotels, stores and restaurants. Given 
Singapore's obsession with cleanliness, it's likely that the law will be 
enforced.

HER WORLD: WHERE THE NEXT ISLAND IS BETTER THAN THE LAST

<P>
It was a small vacation, a few days stitched onto a working trip. But it was a 
pure and restful space in time, a cloud that floated away from the real world 
and loosened all ties to hours. 
</P>
<P>
I knew I was on vacation when I felt the trade winds brush against my face and 
rattle the lacy leaves of old kiawe trees. I knew I was on vacation when it 
seemed natural to slip into sea-green flip-flops, and a long cotton cover-up 
for breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
I knew I was on vacation when the day began with slabs of sweet mango, 
crescents of papaya and rich, dark coffee that I did not brew. 
</P>
<P>
I knew I was on vacation when the climate was balmy, not hot, and when I did 
not have to think about carrying a wrap, as my grandmother used to call coats, 
jackets and sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
This was in Hawaii, my first visit to the islands in 10 years. I found that 
much had changed and much had not. I found that the changes were more 
intriguing than troublesome. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Honolulu Traffic 
</P>
<P>
Honolulu traffic and high-rise construction may rankle the natives, but I was 
impressed with the happy faces and upbeat demeanor of tourists on Waikiki. 
These travelers from East and West seem to have achieved a major holiday goal: 
their trip met their expectations. Singles, couples, families, youngsters, 
seniors -- the crowds in Honolulu were obviously having fun. 
</P>
<P>
My favorite meal in Honolulu was at Siam Orchid, an unpretentious Thai 
restaurant tucked into a shopping center on Keeaumoku Street. The owner, Kris 
Vilassakdanond, and his wife came from Chiang Mai. They worked for Japan Air 
Lines in Bangkok before moving to Hawaii eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
From a long and tempting menu I chose Pinang red curry with peanuts, coconut 
milk and sweet basil. I tasted Evil Chicken in a sauce of garlic and chili 
peppers. I savored crisp ongchoi, an Asian watercress -- stalks and tips -- 
that was stir-fried. 
</P>
<P>
Each dish is prepared as mild, medium or spicy. I heeded the proprietor's 
warning and ordered medium. But as a lover of salsa, I added tiny Thai peppers, 
which are among the hottest in the world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diamond Head 
</P>
<P>
My favorite morning on Waikiki began with a long beach walk toward the crater 
of Diamond Head, past the subtle Oriental roofs of the new-old hotel 
Halekulani, the colonial verandas of the Moana Surfrider, the blush of the 
Royal Hawaiian. 
</P>
<P>
It was just after 6:30 a.m. Two men roamed the beach, scouring the sands with 
metal detectors in search of coins, watches and other treasures. Outrigger 
operators were just setting up shop (one-hour ride: $6). Umbrella boys were 
stirring. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day is fresh and beautiful before 8 a.m.," a silver-haired doorman told 
me. "That is the hour to be up and outside." 
</P>
<P>
I walked on, in the cool of a tropical dawn, and listened to the chatter of 
mynah birds high in the coconut palms of Kapiolani Park. 
</P>
<P>
I admired the window displays at Liberty House, which was heralding summer 
fashion with swimsuits, cotton pants and tops that looked remarkably like 
spring or fall or winter on this blessed island. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traditional Waikiki 
</P>
<P>
It was still quiet when I walked back for breakfast on the seaside terrace of 
the House Without a Key, a traditional Waikiki gathering place. 
</P>
<P>
"Where are you from?" the waitress asked, her skin as dewy as the frangipani 
blossom in her hair. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego," I replied. 
</P>
<P>
"Why, you already live in paradise," she blurted. "What are you doing here?" 
</P>
<P>
"I'm on vacation," I heard myself say, as if that were a remarkable 
achievement. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand," she said with a grin. "I have next week off and I'm heading for 
California." 
</P>
<P>
Later, bedecked in pikake leis, I climbed into a taxi for the airport and ran 
into another opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"Flying home now?" the young driver asked as he dodged through rush-hour 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I'm going to Tahiti." 
</P>
<P>
"Tahiti," he said with a sigh. "Now you're talkin' paradise."

FINDING THE BEST OF OLD, NEW ON THE BIG ISLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB O'SULLIVAN, O'Sullivan is a travel writer based in Canoga Park. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We just got back from our first visit to Hawaii. All we had known about those 
islands before we went was what we'd read and a few things we'd heard from 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, talking about Waikiki, said, "Nobody goes there any more because 
it's too crowded." 
</P>
<P>
Worse, others said that the Old Hawaii was "fading fast and that the old ways 
would soon be gone." 
</P>
<P>
Our first three days were at Waikiki. The palms; the trade winds; the scent of 
plumeria and dozens of other flowers, a sea with hundreds of greens and blues. 
We loved it all. That Hawaii was intact. 
</P>
<P>
But the other complaint, that Hawaii "was slipping further and further from the 
old ways," was a little harder to deal with or even define. 
</P>
<P>
On our fourth day we flew to the Big Island. We were going for a continuation 
of our vacation, but because some of the experts had said that the first 
settlers had gone to the Big Island first, it seemed a likelier place to look 
for answers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Biggest Island 
</P>
<P>
The state of Hawaii is the whole archipelago. But the southernmost island of 
Hawaii, the "Big Island," is the largest of the group. It is also, at a million 
years, so young that it's still under "construction." 
</P>
<P>
Mauna Kea, one of its two volcanoes, is in eruption. Its lava, flowing across 
the land and into the sea, makes the island a little bigger each day. Evidence 
of earlier eruptions is everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Kona Airport is on part of an 1801 lava flow. For the entire 25-mile drive 
north from the airport to our first hotel, the Mauna Lani Bay, the road was 
over uninterrupted lava beds. 
</P>
<P>
At a small sign saying Mauna Lani Bay, we turned off the highway. Suddenly, we 
weren't driving through the shiny black flow-lava anymore. We were in a green 
belt of golf courses and trees, then lush vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel and its grounds were startling. Just past the reception area was an 
atrium, a half-acre open to the sky, with growing flowers, shrubs, trees 
reaching up six floors, birds and even a lagoon and waterfalls. 
</P>
<P>
For the next three days, though, we both felt some mistake had been made, that 
we were in Shangri-La rather than Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
We moved to our next hotel, the Hyatt Regency Waikoloa, a few miles farther up 
the road, simply because we'd heard so much about it. 
</P>
<P>
If the Mauna Lani had seemed a little out of place, the Hyatt Regency Waikoloa 
was another world entirely. It had 1,600 rooms, and you had the option of 
taking either a boat or a train to get to and from the main lobby. Management 
advised you to allow 15 minutes to make the trip. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't seem to bother Joyce, so I kept myself in check, figuring I could 
always wax indignant later. But what with the pools, lagoons, trade winds and 
flowers, after an hour or so I couldn't remember, to save my neck, what I had 
wanted to be indignant about. The New Hawaii wasn't so bad. 
</P>
<P>
Later, at dinner with other hotel guests, the subject of the Islands' past 
"slipping away" came up again. There was some debate as to just what that past 
was. 
</P>
<P>
Was it Don Ho and a rum drink? Was it ukuleles and hula girls? Or was it a 
people living on fish, poi, breadfruit and pineapple, waiting and never knowing 
what they were waiting for, unless it was for Pele to make her next move? 
</P>
<P>
One woman told me that if I was really looking for the Old Hawaii I ought to be 
talking to an old Hawaiian, and she had just the right person in mind. 
</P>
<P>
"The man is 64 years old. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Incredible," I said. "People still get that old?" 
</P>
<P>
His name was Jimmy Tohara and he was the chief plumber at another hotel, the 
Mauna Kea. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Golf Courses and Gardens 
</P>
<P>
The next morning while Joyce had breakfast in bed, I drove to another oasis of 
golf courses and gardens, in the center of which was the Mauna Kea. It was 
magnificent. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Tohara had a smile that filled his whole face. As we walked to a place 
where we could talk, I told him how impressed I was with his workplace. He 
seemed to take it personally. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, this is one of the oldest hotels on the Kohala Coast," Jimmy said. 
"I've worked here for 25 years and I still notice the beauty every day. 
Everything belongs -- art pieces, even the people. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us have been here most of our lives, and our children come to work 
here, too. We get second-generation guests. When something gets this right, you 
don't want to change it." 
</P>
<P>
He led me into a dining room that was not serving and we sat down. Jimmy's 
reaction to my "old ways" question surprised me. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to know whether we're getting away from the old ways? I hope so. This 
is a land where, at one time, the penalty for letting your shadow fall on the 
pathway of the king was instant death. Where a child born with anything wrong, 
even a birthmark, was not allowed to live. Old ways?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Little Problem 
</P>
<P>
He raised his brows, took off his glasses and polished them. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think people even want the 'not-quite-so-old' ways." 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy told me about something that had happened 25 years before. When the hotel 
had been new there had been a little problem with the water. Though it was 
pure, on its way down from the snows on 13,000-foot Mauna Loa it tended to 
acquire the color of tea. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the guests called me," he said. "She said, 'Look at that water. It's 
brown. You can't expect me to bathe in that water, much less drink it.' " 
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing I could do. I acted like I was really offended. 'Lady,' I 
said, 'that water comes from the Goddess Pele. You have heard of King 
Kamehameha with his bodyguard so big and strong. Seven feet tall with muscles 
hard as teak. It's because all their lives they drink this water. No other 
water, this water.' 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Natural Springs 
</P>
<P>
At that point he poured himself a glass of water, drank it down, took a deep 
breath, stood up as straight as he could and left. "I was trying to grow before 
her eyes. It must have worked. I never heard from her again." 
</P>
<P>
He laughed at the memory. "Now we tap natural springs and the water is as clean 
and clear as the sky." 
</P>
<P>
"A long time ago I found a couple of steering sweeps, the big oars they put on 
canoes to steer with. I cleaned them up and put them on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
"When people asked me what they were, I told them they were blades from 
Hawaiian helicopters, that we had them here hundreds of years ago and that we 
didn't need engines because we always had the trade winds." 
</P>
<P>
Then I said, "You aren't above making up a legend yourself." 
</P>
<P>
"I would never do that," he said, trying to keep his face straight. "But that 
business about bad luck coming to people who take the lava rock from Pele's 
volcanoes for souvenirs . . . you know how that started? 
</P>
<P>
"I heard it was a bus driver who got tired of all the tourists bringing the 
dirty rocks onto his nice clean bus, so he made up the legend." 
</P>
<P>
"Jimmy," I asked, "would you take a lava souvenir from the volcano?" The 
question seemed to startle him. 
</P>
<P>
"You think I'm crazy?!" he said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"But most of our legends can be explained," he said. "Hawaiian fishermen throw 
a bucket over the side, bring up water and drink it. Haoles (foreigners) try 
it, get sick and a legend is born. Hawaiians can drink sea water. Hawaiians are 
magic." 
</P>
<P>
"How do they do that?" I asked. He ignored the question. 
</P>
<P>
"Magic, I tell you, magic. A million years, maybe all our lava breaks down into 
soil, huh? The people who build these hotels don't want to wait; they crush the 
lava, bring in topsoil and fill it with plantings from all over the Pacific 
Basin. 
</P>
<P>
"And birds, do you think they would be here? These hotels brought in the birds. 
Now there are birds all over the Kohala Coast, and they take the seeds of our 
flowers all over the island. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of these hotels there is employment where there was none before and 
visitors can come from all over the world to enjoy Hawaii. I think maybe the 
new ways are worth considering too, huh? 
</P>
<P>
"Tomorrow night there will be a hukilau on the beach, at the Royal Waikoloan, a 
luau with fish instead of pork. You go and take your wife and you may see some 
of the best of the old ways." 
</P>
<P>
I was mad at myself for feeling any resentment about the big hotels' 
"intrusions." I had not considered how they figured in the island's economy and 
how their existence made advancement possible for so many people. 
</P>
<P>
Back at the hotel, the information was available. Since opening in 1988 the 
Waikoloa resort alone has pumped an estimated $50 million into Hawaii's 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$4,000 a Day 
</P>
<P>
It spent $4,000 a day on produce alone that it bought from farmers. It required 
so much staff that the hotel had to run daily buses to Hilo, on the other side 
of the island, to bring people to work and then take them home. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce and I went to the hukilau on the beach the next night. Young people in 
native costume danced against a background of the sea and a setting sun to the 
music of drums, ukuleles and the trade winds in the palms. 
</P>
<P>
When it got dark, torches were lighted and food was served. 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of the evening I talked with one of the girls who had been 
dancing for us. I told her about how I'd been asking around about the Old 
Hawaii and of what I'd learned so far. 
</P>
<P>
I told her that it was probably good that the islands were changing, that the 
local people were getting a share of the prosperity. It might have been that I 
couldn't keep the disappointment out of my voice. 
</P>
<P>
She touched my arm. 
</P>
<P>
"No," she said, "don't feel that way. I know what you feel. I have children and 
I'm grateful that, thanks to the people who visit us, I'll be able to send them 
to college. But because we have gained something it doesn't mean we've lost 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all still here." 
</P>
<P>
She took my hands. 
</P>
<P>
"All my life my grandmother would take my hands, like this, and look into my 
eyes and say, 'Hold on, hold on.' I think it was the last thing she said to me 
before she died. 'Hold on.' 
</P>
<P>
"We have a word -- malama. It means 'stewardship,' a knowing and caring 
stewardship. My grandmother had taught me and my mother the old ways, as her 
mother had taught her. She was telling me to hold on to them, hold on to the 
traditions. Don't ever let them go. And I haven't, and neither will my children 
and their children. The old ways are here." 
</P>
<P>
I nodded toward the torch-lighted stage amid the palms. "Here?" 
</P>
<P>
"No." She touched the area over her heart. "Here."

PALMS SPRINGS ETERNAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First, I must tell you how entertaining and informative your Travel Section has 
proved to be. When I get the Sunday Times I save your section until last 
because it's my dessert. 
</P>
<P>
Second, my main reason for writing is in regard to the Palm Springs article, 
"Palm Springs Trying for a Comeback," June 25. After reading about all the 
planned resorts with waterfalls, lakes, shorelines and aquatic activities, I am 
most curious about one point. Where on earth -- or maybe under earth -- is all 
that water to come from? At the rate of development you wrote about, I wonder 
if it will be a real desert someday?

I have just come back from a long trip to New York, England and France. Thank 
goodness, my office kept all the back issues of the Sunday Los Angeles Times. I 
have just read and re-read your pieces on Bora Bora (May 14) and Raiatea (May 
21). They are some of the best stuff I have ever read and I have saved them, 
not only to refer to for my readers, but as a source of inspiration. Thank you

PARADISE LOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My wife and I look forward eagerly to your Travel Section and enjoy reading 
about all the places that we hope to visit some day. We especially enjoyed the 
June 18 article by Georgia Hesse -- "Voyaging Between the 'Lost Islands' of 
Micronesia." But the article's dateline puzzled us, since Tarawa Atoll has 
always been part of the Gilbert Islands and, although nearby, not part of the 
Marshall Islands. Thanks again for all the inspiring travel articles which 
propel our daydreams.

PALMS SPRINGS ETERNAL

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The paean to Palm Springs and its neighboring communities makes it easy to 
doubt the drought warnings that perennially surface in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The hydromanic developers in that low desert area who add aquatic amenities 
(to) their plans as if there's a bottomless wellspring of water for them to 
tap, must think such alarms are a mirage. 
</P>
<P>
One has to wonder also what effect this rush to convert these arid areas into 
lush oases will ultimately have on the balance of nature there. Specifically, 
when the climate turns too muggy for comfort in the low desert, as it surely 
will, won't their boast, "Sure, it's hot here, but it's a dry heat" go down the 
drain? 
</P>
<P>
But take heart. When the wells run dry in the lower half of our state we can 
just put pumps in all their lakes, ponds, pools and the river Palm Springs 
Mayor Bono wants to have down Palm Canyon Drive, and pipe water out to the 
thirsty masses of Southern California.

Unfortunately, your Travel Editor Jerry Hulse was accurate when he described 
this city's problems. Most of us who live here year-round do not want Palm 
Springs turned into a Coney Island or a race track with streets lined with 
T-shirt shops. The question we have is whether a city of the '90s needs a mayor 
of the '60s. The quote from Mayor Sonny Bono, "I am a tourist attraction," 
explains part of the city's problem. Sonny Bono is a celebrity in his own mind 
who has used the city's highest office to promote himself. 
</P>
<P>
Last October the Citizens of Palm Springs, a citizen advocate group, voted 
unanimously to give Mayor Sonny Bono and City Manager Norm King a 
"no-confidence" vote. King, who told you he favors the proposed stadium and "is 
very much looking forward to this year's road race," was publicly asked to 
resign last week by one of our city council members. Maybe there is hope for a 
comeback after all.

"Outraged" is the word for my feelings while reading of how Palm Springs shows 
its indifference to California's water needs as it blithely constructs more and 
more lakes, lagoons, waterfalls and pools at the expense of the rest of us who 
are being asked to conserve. Are we conserving for Palm Springs? 
</P>
<P>
"Outraged" also describes my feelings about The Times as it hypocritically 
preaches environmental concerns and water conservation on its editorial pages 
while at the same time, in its Travel Section, it provides color pictures and 
other glamorous hype for Palm Springs and its obscene water usage policy.

URBAN SCENE: WATTS TOWERS: SYMBOL OF HIGH EXPECTATION; 
</P>
<P>
'CHALLENGE' ENVISIONS RODIA MASTERPIECE AS CENTERPIECE OF A REVITALIZED 
COMMUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON, Whiteson is a Los Angeles free-lancer who writes on 
architectural topics. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Working for 30 years, alone and without financial help of any kind, Simon 
Rodia, an uneducated Italian laborer, raised his famous Watts Towers in the 
yard of his one-room shack between the 1920s and 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
"I had in mind to do something big, and I did" was how Rodia explained the 
creation of his masterpiece of visionary architecture, admired by artists and 
designers around the world. Rodia called his towers "Pueblo Nuestro" -- "Our 
Town" in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of Watts -- then as now one of Los Angeles' poorer neighborhoods 
-- these proud spires demonstrate that imagination and guts can raise a man 
above his own limitations and above the restrictions of a society that pegged 
him as an uneducated immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
Rodia's Watts Towers provide the emotional inspiration and physical centerpiece 
of an imaginative new scenario sketched for the future urban design development 
of Watts at a recent four-day community planning workshop. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the workshop's recommendations, contained in a report titled 
"The Challenge of Change," is a suggestion for an expanded cultural-arts 
complex to be developed around the towers at 1765 E. 107th St. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Link Pedestrian Arcade 
</P>
<P>
The complex, proposed for a park to be created between the towers and the new 
Los Angeles-Long Beach light-rail line now under construction, would include a 
multipurpose performance hall, galleries and workshops for 
artists-in-residence. 
</P>
<P>
A pedestrian arcade would link the cultural center to the recently renovated 
Watts train station and the adjacent 103rd Street shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
The station would become a "Watts Gateway" identifying the community's "new 
green and creative heart," according to several members of the team that 
prepared the report. 
</P>
<P>
"The Challenge of Change" came out of a four-day workshop on Watts mounted June 
9-12 by a Los Angeles Design Action Planning Team (LA/DAPT) made up of 
planners, architects, landscape architects, city and county officials and 
community activists. The workshop was held at Markham Intermediate School on 
East 104th Street. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the Los Angeles City Planning Department and the Urban Design 
Advisory Coalition, the Watts LA/DAPT was the third in a series that has 
already produced reports on Van Nuys and the Olive Hill district of East 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of the series is to bring to bear the combined expertise of top design 
professionals and city planners, with the participation of local residents, to 
suggest coherent and socially sensitive urban design policies for the areas 
under study. 
</P>
<P>
The Watts district, home to 35,000 people, lies between 92nd Street on the 
north and Imperial Highway on the south, and between Alameda Street on the east 
and Central Avenue on the west. 
</P>
<P>
If you were able, like Rodia, to climb to the top of the tallest Watts Tower, 
almost 100 feet high, you would overlook a mixed landscape of quiet, tree-lined 
streets lined by neat small bungalows and huge, ugly public housing projects 
defaced by gang graffiti and degraded by drug dealing. 
</P>
<P>
In the long shadows cast by the towers you would see a community caught in the 
hot hollow of the Los Angeles Basin; a community that deserves an imaginative 
response if it is to live up to Rodia's challenge to "do something big." 
</P>
<P>
"The Challenge of Change" report is a good beginning. It suggests both short- 
and long-range urban design plans for Watts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exploit Location 
</P>
<P>
The short-range plan relies upon a small-scale incremental approach to 
development, a project-by-project strategy that stitches together the tattered 
urban fabric of the area piece by piece. 
</P>
<P>
The long-range plan, spread over 30 years, has the ambition to transform Watts 
into one of the region's major economic centers by exploiting its location next 
to the new transportation corridors now under construction. The cultural-arts 
complex would form the focus of the long-range proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Community members interviewed by the LA/DAPT team spoke proudly of the 
district's social and cultural heritage. They described neighborhoods rich in 
residents who care about one another and who have formed self-help groups to 
aid the distressed and comfort the desperate. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, several people interviewed, such as Robin Cannon of the 
Concerned Citizens of South Central and Gladys Carr Coleman of the Community 
Youth Gang Services, described a Watts social landscape that includes many 
single-parent welfare families headed by women and "gun-toting gang members 
ready to prey on people who leave the security of their homes or automobiles." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Drop-Out Rate a Scandal' 
</P>
<P>
"Unemployment is high, development is scarce, transportation is poorly served," 
Cannon said. "The school drop-out rate is a scandal. The area's location, at 
the bottom of the Los Angeles Basin, leaves it suspended in limbo between 
downtown L.A. and Long Beach." 
</P>
<P>
One of the local schoolchildren interviewed by the workshop panel put it 
succinctly: "This is a jungle, man," he said, "and there ain't no Tarzans." 
</P>
<P>
The report acknowledges that in the decades since the 1965 riots, which 
residents term an "uprising," attempts have been made to improve the quality of 
life in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"But the dream of a revitalized Watts community remains unrealized," the report 
states. "Many of the economic and social conditions which frustrated residents 
24 years ago are still evident." 
</P>
<P>
The completion of the Los Angeles-Long Beach light-rail line and east-west 
Century Freeway early in the 1990s will alleviate the area's sense of isolation 
by linking Watts to the rest of the metropolitan region, planners hope. 
</P>
<P>
"The community has huge reservoirs of hope, imagination and energy," said 
LA/DAPT team member Sterling Barnes, a city planner and a member of the Watts 
Community Action Council. He believes that the resources for renewal are many, 
"if only we can put it all together, both within Watts and outside." 
</P>
<P>
Barnes explained that the Watts workshop had by far the most intense and 
numerous community participation of the three LA/DAPT programs done to date. 
</P>
<P>
"What most moved those of us who participated in the Watts workshop was the 
tremendous passion, interest and energy of the local residents," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Like Rodia, the people of Watts have in mind to do something big.

SAM HALL KAPLAN: PRO-DEMOCRACY MOVE IN L.A. PLANNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM HALL KAPLAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps it is the spirit of Independence Day, but it appears that the repeated 
pleas for a more democratic planning process in Los Angeles is at long last 
being heard, at least in some quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Especially welcome are the recent publicly sponsored design workshops in Watts, 
East Hollywood and Van Nuys, encouraging citizen participation, and the open 
discussions concerning the proposed major development of Playa Vista. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the workshops, by focusing on select neighborhoods and specific 
solutions, hold out the promise that some of the recommendations might be 
implemented within a reasonable time, that the residents involved will be able 
to see the fruits of their labor beyond the publication of a report. 
</P>
<P>
Among the recommendations is the diversion of traffic away from residential 
neighborhoods, widening of sidewalks to encourage pedestrian use, tree-planting 
programs, the call for mixed uses, such as apartments above stores, and the 
construction of some sort of focal point to lend the respective communities an 
identity. 
</P>
<P>
As important as the recommendations is the fact that as the workshops have 
progressed, the latest held a few weeks ago in Watts, the attending design 
professionals and civil servants are listening more to each other and, in 
particular, to the citizens. The result has been a healthy dialogue among those 
involved, instead of the usual attempts by a few in power to manipulate, 
dictate and ultimately alienate. 
</P>
<P>
The workshops have been orchestrated by a handful of dedicated city planning 
department employees and volunteers from the local Urban Design Advisory 
Coalition, guided by Charles Zucker of the national American Institute of 
Architects' community assistance program. 
</P>
<P>
Helping has been a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. And then 
there are the neighborhood residents and merchants, donating their time in a 
gesture of hope over experience. 
</P>
<P>
The Playa Vista planning effort is somewhat different. While there are still a 
number of environmental, architectural and economic items and issues yet to be 
clarified, the fact that the developer, Maguire Thomas Partners, has opened the 
process for all to see and comment on is a refreshing change. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt, the approach was prompted in part by the vociferous opposition to 
previous proposals there by adjacent communities and a vigilant Councilwoman 
Ruth Galanter. 
</P>
<P>
Time will tell whether the workshops and the open discussions are just window 
dressing for the usual special interests, a public relations and psycho-social 
gimmick to further sap the energies and good will of concerned residents. Or 
whether they are the progenitors of a new and enlightened local planning 
process. 
</P>
<P>
For too long the process in most cities generally has been an academic gesture 
weighted down with thick studies and multicolored maps full of sound and fluff. 
They have tended to affect little, except usually to pad bureaucratic fiefdoms 
and consultant fees, while frustrating community groups and confusing the 
media. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the actual planning often has been a closed-door, 
over-an-expense-account-lunch or out-on-the-golf-course exercise, involving 
private interests, select politicians and compliant officials. 
</P>
<P>
Prompting such meetings is the fact that an estimated 80% of campaign 
contributions in local elections come from individuals and corporations 
involved in one form or other in real estate. The aerospace, financial and 
entertainment fields notwithstanding, real estate development is the prime 
honey pot of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Within this reality, community groups tend to be viewed as an annoyance, and an 
open planning process downright subversive. Patted on the head and ignored, it 
is no wonder that many groups have become so strident, giving rise to what has 
been called "vigilante planning," where rhetoric on all sides tends to drown 
out a rational approach to growth management. 
</P>
<P>
Not helping has been the failure of the city to date to establish the promised 
community plan advisory committees, proposed nearly three years ago in the wake 
of the overwhelming passage of the Proposition U slow-growth initiative. 
</P>
<P>
The committees are seen as a way citizen participation might be better 
structured and channeled, giving communities a more coherent, recognized voice. 
At present, it is hard to tell who speaks for whom and what, whether it is just 
a few demagogues, political cronies or straw men for developers, or responsible 
representatives of a concerned neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
When asked recently what happened to the proposal for the committees, city 
Planning Director Ken Topping declared: "It is happening." 
</P>
<P>
Topping seems to prefer active verbs to answer such questions. When asked a 
year ago about the committees and other programs to promote an open planning 
process, Topping replied in a letter that the varied efforts "are getting under 
way," or "will be formed," and that generally the city was "aggressively" 
pursuing the goal of a more livable city. 
</P>
<P>
Eight months later, in a letter to the editor published in this newspaper 
commenting on an editorial calling for planning reforms, Mayor Tom Bradley 
repeated many of the same items and the same phrasing Topping had used. 
</P>
<P>
"We are turning the corner on city planning," declared the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes that corner seems like a circle, raising the issue whether the city 
as presently constituted and managed has the ability to manage growth and 
protect a dwindling quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the workshops promised in the letters were launched, albeit thanks in part 
to a cadre of volunteer design professionals, and the local residents and 
merchants themselves. And if some politicos haven't seen the writing on the 
wall by communities calling for an open planning process, at least the 
development firm of Maguire Thomas has. 
</P>
<P>
While not exactly a revolution of, by and for the people in the planning 
process, they are gestures that no doubt the Founding Fathers would appreciate.

TIMES HAS CHANGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For as many years as I can remember, I've looked forward to the Sunday Times 
Real Estate Section, always expecting to read about the major players in 
Southern California's dynamic real estate marketplace and about the trends 
being established by builders and developers in the area. I even look forward 
to Sam Hall Kaplan's commentary on the above, although I seldom agree with him. 
</P>
<P>
The front page always managed to generate excitement with news and photographs 
of the latest grandiose monument downtown or perhaps a new planned community in 
Riverside County. And Hot Property has always reminded us that we are, after 
all, Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The Times has changed though, hasn't it. News of the next phase of the 
long-delayed California Plaza (no photos) was hidden on an inside back page -- 
well after such "real estate" news as rats and problem garden soil. And what of 
the Koll Co. signs on the site of Gene Scott's old church? No word in The Times 
Real Estate Section. Even the Orange County Register made mention of that one. 
</P>
<P>
Come on, guys -- let's put the "handy hints" after the real estate news -- 
better yet, in its own section of the newspaper.

TESTS FOR BROKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David W. Myers' June 18 article, "Bill to License Appraisers Set for Vote" 
covered quite well many of the problems and issues involved with licensing of 
real estate appraisers and the involvement of the California Assn. of Realtors 
through its bill, AB 527. 
</P>
<P>
I oppose the blanket "grandfathering" of brokers as appraisers. To me, the 
conflicts of interest inherent in this are both obvious and overwhelming. I 
support the California Coalition of Appraisers' position that brokers can be 
licensed or certified if they pass the course requirements, pass the exams and 
pay the appropriate fees that all other professional appraisers will have to 
meet also. 
</P>
<P>
Your article stated brokers will not be allowed to advertise themselves as 
appraisers. This is not correct. Under AB 527 brokers certainly can advertise 
themselves as appraisers. They cannot advertise as "Licensed Appraiser" or 
"Certified Appraiser" unless they have passed the exams, etc. for those 
classifications. 
</P>
<P>
I found an interesting juxtaposition in that same Real Estate Section where a 
CAR spokesperson says that appraisers have not cornered the market on ethics 
and that realtors are restrained from wrongdoing by their code of ethics. In 
the Real Estate Q &amp; A column by Robert Bruss a few pages away, the very 
first letter begins "When are you going to expose the realtors? My wife and I 
found out their so-called Code of Ethics is a joke." 
</P>
<P>
I have been an appraiser for over 10 years and I agree appraisers have no 
corner on ethics. I have also been a real estate broker for over 10 years, and 
I know that neither realtors nor CAR have any corner on them either.

DO THE BENEFITS OUTWEIGH THE COSTS OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT COURSES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: Recently, I have seen ads on TV for several real estate seminars. I 
also saw one where a fellow advertised a set of tapes for $99 that were 
guaranteed to show me many ways to buy real estate for no down payment. 
Recently, I heard about a one-week real estate course for $5,000 that is 
guaranteed to set me up in business buying foreclosured properties. Do you 
think I should go to one of these seminars or buy the real estate tapes? Or 
should I just read some good books on how to make money in real estate? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Over the years I have attended most of the real estate seminars and 
listened to most of the real estate tapes commercially available. For my book 
review column I have to read one real estate book every other week so I have 
read most of the real estate books published during the last 12 years. However, 
I have not taken the new, very expensive courses, costing several thousand 
dollars, which also provide follow-up consulting service. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people have taken the Al Lowry and Robert Allen real estate 
seminars. I did too and thought they were well worth the fees. However, it is 
too bad the sponsors didn't stick to earning real estate profits instead of 
going broke in the seminar business. 
</P>
<P>
We all need motivation. For some people, attending seminars, listening to tapes 
or reading books provides that motivation. Yet, there are thousands of very 
successful real estate investors who never took one of these courses, never 
listened to a real estate tape or read any of the books, but they just went out 
and started investing in real estate. 
</P>
<P>
If you are a highly motivated individual, you probably don't need these 
courses. But if you want to learn fast and will apply what you learn, then 
spending money on this education may be what you need. I suggest you begin by 
studying all the real estate books you can get at local bookstores and at the 
library. Then get started by investing in your first property, preferably your 
personal residence. Also, check out the excellent real estate courses offered 
at low cost from local community colleges.

Set Short Time-Limit to Acceptance Offer 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am having trouble buying a lot where I want to build my home. The seller 
lives about 50 miles away and the listing real estate agent refuses to drive to 
the seller's home to present any purchase offers. She insisted on telephoning 
the offer to the seller. I made an offer which the listing agent explained over 
the phone to the seller in my presence. The seller said he wanted 30 days to 
consider the offer so I amended my offer to make it valid for 30 days. Now I am 
afraid the seller and agent are "shopping" my offer to get a better price from 
another buyer. What can I do as I want that lot but am very upset with the 
realty agent? 
</P>
<P>
A: Shame, shame, shame on that lazy realty agent for presenting your offer over 
the telephone. I have never yet seen an offer signed over the telephone. Have 
you? The agent should have driven the 50 miles to the seller's home to deliver 
and discuss the offer. If the seller lived far away, your offer could have been 
sent overnight via Federal Express. 
</P>
<P>
You can still revoke your offer but that won't accomplish anything other than 
to make the seller mad. But you might want to inform the seller you will keep 
your offer open for only three more days so you can consider other property. 
This will put pressure on the seller to either accept or counteroffer your 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
It is very difficult to know how to handle sellers and their real estate 
agents, but in the future you may want to add to your offers: "This offer to be 
presented to seller in person only in the presence of buyer or his real estate 
agent." 
</P>
<P>
A similar situation like yours happened to me a few years ago. Fortunately, the 
agent through whom I made my purchase offer insisted he and the listing agent 
drive together to the seller's home which was about 120 miles away. The seller 
was very impressed that the two agents would drive so far. The agents explained 
to the seller why my offer was a good one and, after a few minor changes, the 
seller accepted although he had earlier rejected several similar offers.

Mortgage Priority Set by Recording Date 
</P>
<P>
Q: We are thinking of selling our home. It has an assumable VA first mortgage 
of about $74,500. If we carry back a $100,000 mortgage for the buyer, since it 
is larger, will it have priority over the VA mortgage if the buyer doesn't make 
the payments and foreclosure occurs? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. Mortgage priority is determined by the recording dates, not by the 
amount of the mortgages. The VA mortgage will remain a first mortgage and your 
new loan will become a second mortgage. For further details, please consult a 
real estate attorney. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Don't Let Borrower Fall Behind on Bill 
</P>
<P>
Q: About four years ago we sold our home and carried back a second mortgage for 
the buyers. All went well until several months ago when the monthly payment 
didn't arrive. When I called the buyers I learned they had moved out of the 
house due to a divorce. The house is now listed for sale. How long should I 
wait before foreclosing? 
</P>
<P>
A: Not a minute more. You have already waited too long. If a borrower cannot 
make the monthly payment, you are not doing the borrower a favor by delaying 
foreclosure. The further behind the borrower gets, the more home equity the 
borrower loses. Another consideration is the borrower probably also is not 
paying the first mortgage, thus jeopardizing your second mortgage. Please 
consult a real estate attorney for more details. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
How Does a Recession Affect Home Prices? 
</P>
<P>
Q: If a recession occurs, what do you expect will happen to home prices? How 
much of a price decrease do you expect? 
</P>
<P>
A: In the last recession, home prices in most cities did not decrease. Instead, 
they plateaued. But nationwide, home prices actually increased. The reason is 
most property sellers don't sell unless they can get at least the price they 
paid for their property plus a little profit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ways for Two People to Hold Joint Title 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am concerned about your recent article where a joint tenant discovered her 
joint tenancy had been ended without her knowledge and as surviving joint 
tenant she wound up being a tenant in common. What do you think is the best way 
for two people to hold title to real estate? 
</P>
<P>
A: The big benefit of owning property as joint tenants with right of 
survivorship is when one joint tenant dies, the survivor automatically receives 
the deceased's share of the property without probate. 
</P>
<P>
However, in most states it is possible for a joint tenant to convey away his or 
her share without the permission of the other joint tenant. A notable exception 
occurs between husband and wife in states that allow joint tenancy by the 
entireties, which requires approval of both spouses to convey any ownership 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
Since you didn't indicate if you plan to own real estate with a relative or 
friend, and if you want that person to automatically receive your share when 
you die, or vice versa, I can't completely answer your question. Please consult 
a real estate attorney for further details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What Determines Rates on Sales Commissions? 
</P>
<P>
Q: How are real estate sales commissions set? We plan to sell our home in a few 
months so are shopping around for a real estate agent. The two agents we have 
consulted so far both want a 6% sales commission. We also talked to one 
so-called discount broker who charges a fixed fee of about 3% percent. However, 
the discount broker expects the home sellers to hold weekend open houses and 
negotiate with prospective buyers. What puzzles us is how the sales fees are 
determined? 
</P>
<P>
A: Theoretically, real estate sales commissions are freely negotiable between 
the realty agent and property sellers. But in the real world most full-service 
real estate agents all charge the same commission rate. However, as you 
discovered, the so-called discount brokers charge less but they usually offer 
fewer services too. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Incurable Home Defect Has an Up Side Too 
</P>
<P>
Q: We are having trouble buying a home we can afford. However, out of sympathy 
I'm sure, a real estate agent called to tell us about a new listing which we 
can actually afford. But the big problem is the fairly nice house is located 
adjacent to a busy six-lane street. We like the house, but the noise from the 
street is pretty bad. Everything looks good, especially the top schools for our 
kids, except for the location. What do you advise? 
</P>
<P>
A: The problem you describe is called an incurable defect. That means you have 
virtually no control over the drawback which affects the desirability of the 
home. 
</P>
<P>
As you probably know, location is the most important factor to consider when 
buying a home. However, beggars can't be choosers. Over the years I've learned 
highway noise is not as big a problem as most people think. Inside the house 
you can minimize the noise by using insulation and double-pane windows. 
Outdoors, you can plant trees and bushes to absorb sound. A perimeter fence 
will give you privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Of course I can't give specific advice to buy or not buy, but if that house is 
the only one you can afford in the vicinity where you want to live, perhaps you 
can learn to live with its big drawback. However, don't pay too much because 
someday when you want to sell you will encounter the same incurable defect 
problem that the current seller has. In the meantime, I'll bet you get used to 
the noise. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
VA Home Loans Are Based on Appraisal 
</P>
<P>
Q: We are receiving conflicting advice about VA home loans. One real estate 
agent told us to forget about VA mortgages because, she says, the appraisals 
are too low. But another agent says he has sold many homes with VA mortgages. 
He agrees the appraisals are often lower than the sales price but usually only 
by a few thousand dollars which the vet can pay in cash. What do you think 
about VA mortgages? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think VA home loans are the best deal in home financing. Their advantages 
include (1) no or very small down payment, (2) fixed interest rate, (3) 
attractive interest rate, (4) prompt funding if you deal with a lender who has 
approval authority, and (5) liberal qualification rules. 
</P>
<P>
However, one drawback to consider is the loan discount fee cannot be paid by 
the VA buyer. That means the seller can either pay the fee or elect not sell to 
the VA buyer. But I think this is outweighed by the little or no down payment 
required. Yes, if the appraisal comes in lower than the sales price the seller 
will accept, then you have the option of either paying the difference in cash 
or not buying that home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
When an Easement May Not Be Valid 
</P>
<P>
Q: About two months ago, we bought a house that has a shared driveway with the 
neighbor. However, our deed says nothing about any easement. What irritates us 
is that the neighbor leaves for work about 6 a.m. in her noisy old car. We 
asked her to park her car on the street and not to wake us, but she wasn't very 
nice and told us to go someplace I don't want to go. The neighbor could build a 
driveway on her property to the back alley. Is there any way we can stop her 
from driving over our property? 
</P>
<P>
A: Perhaps. Please consult a real estate attorney. If there is no recorded 
easement over your land, then you can deter the neighbor from using your land 
by erecting a fence. 
</P>
<P>
However, the neighbor may argue she has a prescriptive easement to continue 
driving over your property. But a prescriptive easement can only be created by 
long-term use that is open, notorious and hostile. 
</P>
<P>
If you can prove the previous owner allowed permissive use, that defeats the 
neighbor's prescriptive easement claim because the use wasn't hostile. Because 
the neighbor has access to the street, she couldn't claim an easement by 
necessity, so you might win if the case goes to court.

CONDO Q&amp;A: CONDOS AND TOWNHOUSES: WHAT IS DIFFERENCE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HICKENBOTTOM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: Thank goodness for your new column. Now maybe I can get an answer to 
my question: What is the difference between a condo and a townhouse? 
</P>
<P>
I've asked many real estate agents and friends who own condos and what a 
mishmash of answers I have received. Please let me know the correct definition 
as we are interested in buying one or the other but not until we know for sure 
what we are getting into. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Confusion arises because community associations can have several 
different architectural designs and legal descriptions. Architectural styles 
vary from high-rise to low-rise, townhouse to single-family residences. 
</P>
<P>
Condominium structures often have public entrances, common hallways and garage 
areas much like apartment buildings. A townhouse complex usually has four or 
five units in one or more buildings. Exterior doors lead directly to each unit 
with separate garages or carports. Single-family houses on individually-owned 
lots are sometimes controlled by a homeowners' association. 
</P>
<P>
Community associations are formed for maintenance and administration of land 
and buildings that are owned "in common" by several owners. 
</P>
<P>
Membership is mandatory -- if you purchase property in the association, you are 
automatically a member of the association with all the rights and 
responsibilities outlined in the Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and 
Restrictions (CC&amp;Rs). Owners pay assessments for the operation and 
maintenance of the commonly owned property. 
</P>
<P>
How does legal ownership differ? When you read the legal documents of a 
"condominium" you will probably discover that the unit owners own a percentage 
of the land and building structure and common elements (landscaped areas, 
hallways, recreation rooms, swimming pools) plus the individual owner owns the 
inner walls and improvements within the condo unit. 
</P>
<P>
This condominium concept has expanded to commercial and office condominiums and 
even marinas, called "dockominiums." 
</P>
<P>
In a "planned unit development" (PUD), usually called a "homeowners' 
association," the unit owners often own the land on which the individual unit 
sits, and a proportionate interest in the common elements. Townhouses and 
single-family residences are often PUDs. Owners in a planned unit development 
or homeowners association are often responsible for roof maintenance or 
landscaping around their individual unit. Check the association's CC&amp;Rs for 
this information. 
</P>
<P>
While we're defining, let's cover the cooperative concept. A "cooperative" is a 
nonprofit corporation which owns and pays property taxes on the land and 
building structure. The owners own a share of stock in the corporation, rather 
than a percentage of the property. 
</P>
<P>
Owners "rent" their units pursuant to a proprietary lease with the corporation, 
and they pay regular assessments just like the condo or PUD owner. This basic 
legal difference provides certain advantages for the cooperative. Since the 
corporation owns all of the property, if the building requires major repairs, 
the cooperative has the capability of borrowing money secured by a mortgage on 
the entire building to make the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
When you purchase in any community association, remember that you are legally 
bound to abide by the CC&amp;Rs and other legal restrictions that run with the 
property, so read them carefully. If you do not understand the documents, 
consult an attorney who specializes in common-interest real estate law. 
</P>

Neighborhood Watch May Prevent Crime 
</P>
<P>
Q: Our homeowners association is having some problems with vandalism and 
graffiti, etc. You mentioned Neighborhood Watch in a recent column. Where can 
our association obtain more information? 
</P>
<P>
A: The Neighborhood Watch program encourages people to work together to combat 
crime within the neighborhood. Anyone can obtain information about it by 
calling your local police. Do not call 911. Call the non-emergency line. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Association Will Not Act on Complaint 
</P>
<P>
Q: My wife and I belong to a homeowners association. Our neighbor has 
constructed a block wall between our properties. The footing of the wall is 
exposed on my side of the wall and there is no reasonable way for me to elevate 
my yard. The wall stands partially on my property and was built on top of my 
sprinklers. It has altered the ground drainage, resulting in flooding of my 
property when his lawn sprinklers are turned on. Lighting that shines in my 
window has been installed on a pilaster at the end of the wall. 
</P>
<P>
We learned that our neighbor obtained construction approval from the 
association after the wall was already constructed. There are several CC&amp;R 
violations involved, but our association has not responded to our complaint 
other than to indicate that this is a "civil matter." How do we make the 
homeowners association enforce the CC&amp;Rs? 
</P>
<P>
A: First, if you haven't already done so, file a written complaint with your 
association board of directors and request a written response. In its written 
response, the board of directors should tell you why they are declining action. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, there may be a time limit imposed on the board by the 
association's legal documents. It may be too late for the board to act. 
</P>
<P>
Second, you should check with your city or county to see if building permits 
for this type of construction are required and whether permits were obtained. 
You may get some assistance from local government if the work was done without 
the proper permits. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, you must determine the answer to this question: Is the aggravation and 
expense of your corrective repairs to the lawn and sprinkler system worth the 
additional time and expense of pursuing this with an attorney? Remember that 
you may be living in this association next to this neighbor for some time to 
come. 
</P>
<P>
If you wish to file a lawsuit, your attorney can advise whether to sue the 
association, the offending neighbor or both.

<P>
VEGETABLE GARDENERS: RELAX, BUT NOT TOO MUCH; 
</P>
<P>
DURING SUMMER, KEEP UP WITH WATERING, HARVESTING AND WORM-CONTROL CHORES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SIDNAM, Sidnam has written garden columns and features for The Times 
since 1975. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Summer presents a time to relax and enjoy your vegetable garden, especially the 
summer harvest. Red, sun-ripened tomatoes, garden-fresh green beans, shiny 
green, yellow and red peppers, tender young squash, luscious melons with their 
marvelous aroma, succulent sweet corn, crisp cucumbers and glossy purple 
eggplant form a colorful cornucopia of good eating. 
</P>
<P>
But don't relax too much. Hot weather makes heavy demands on vegetables; they 
need extra care this time of the year. And if you are going on vacation, it is 
absolutely essential to have someone take care of your garden while you're 
away. Here are some suggestions to help you maintain a healthy garden and a 
prolonged harvest. 
</P>
<P>
Watering: You must never neglect irrigation chores during the summer months. 
Vegetables generally have higher water requirements than ornamentals, and you 
can easily lose vegetable plants that are water-stressed. 
</P>
<P>
It is best to water early in the morning. Overhead watering is to be 
discouraged as it promotes mildew on many vegetable plants. How much water 
should you apply? Irrigate your plants deeply at least once a week. The 
moisture should penetrate at least 6 inches into the soil; tomatoes require 
much deeper watering. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Frequent Harvesting 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind that vegetables grown in containers require far more frequent 
irrigation. Never let the soil dry out completely as you can lose 
container-grown vegetable plants in a matter of hours if they become 
water-stressed. 
</P>
<P>
Harvest frequently: Warm-season vegetables mature at an incredibly rapid pace 
during periods of hot weather and require frequent harvesting. Check summer 
squash and cucumbers daily, as oversized fruit will limit new production and 
affect quality. 
</P>
<P>
Beans, in particular, will produce over longer periods if picked often. Don't 
allow melons to spoil because they are hiding under foliage -- search the 
plants thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
Control weeds: Weeds compete with vegetables for moisture and sunshine. The 
expression "grows like a weed" is doubly true during hot weather. Weeding is a 
dull, tedious task, but you must force yourself to keep at it on a weekly 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
You can help lessen drudgery by using mulches around your vegetable plants. 
Black plastic mulch is especially effective in controlling weed growth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worm Control Needed 
</P>
<P>
Control worms: Now is the peak season for tomato and cabbage worms. Everyone 
who has grown tomatoes knows what the big ugly tomato hornworm looks like and 
the destruction it can do in a short period of time. Although cabbage and other 
cool-season crops are not in production now, cabbage worms can cause a lot of 
damage to other vegetables, particularly beans. 
</P>
<P>
You can easily control both tomato and cabbage worms by spraying every 10 days 
with a product containing the biological control Bacillus thuringiensis. The 
products include Dipel, Attack and Thuricide. 
</P>
<P>
These products will not harm warm-blooded animals, birds, bees or other 
beneficial insects, but are highly effective in destroying harmful 
caterpillars. Don't wait until the insects appear -- spray routinely every 10 
days during the growing season.

THE ONE-HOUR PROJECT: A SMOOTH SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM OF DRYWALL HOLES; 
</P>
<P>
ONLY BASIC TOOLS AND MATERIALS NEEDED FOR MAKING PATCHES THAT BLEND IN WITH 
SURFACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL BIANCHINA

<TEXT>
<P>
One of the most common of all household repairs is patching drywall. Whether 
you've moved a light fixture or someone's put a doorknob through the wall, 
closing up the resulting hole and blending it in with the rest of the wall 
probably seems pretty intimidating -- but it's actually quite simple. 
</P>
<P>
Only basic tools and materials are required, plus a little patience. Here's an 
old drywaller's repair trick that works great: 
</P>
<P>
First, even up the edges of the hole with a drywall or keyhole saw so that it 
is round and all of the damaged material has been removed. 
</P>
<P>
Next, cut a circle out of a piece of scrap drywall, 2 inches larger in diameter 
than the size of the hole. Turn the piece over, and mark out a circle on the 
back that is the same diameter as the hole. Use a razor knife to carefully cut 
through the backing paper along the edges of this smaller circle. 
</P>
<P>
Crack the drywall along the circular cut by gently snapping it from back to 
front. Carefully peel the outer circle of gypsum off the front paper, and you 
will be left with a circular patch that has a one inch strip of paper all 
around it on the front. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Apply Second Layer 
</P>
<P>
To make the repair, coat the inside edges of the hole with drywall joint 
compound. Using a 6-inch-wide drywall taping knife, apply a layer of joint 
compound to the wall around the hole also. 
</P>
<P>
Push the patch into the hole, and use your taping knife to embed the paper 
strip in the joint compound. Smooth out the paper and remove any excess 
compound. Let the patch dry overnight. 
</P>
<P>
When the patch is dry, apply a second layer of joint compound over it. This 
time, make sure the compound covers the entire patch, plus an area of the wall 
about 6 inches past it on all sides. A 12-inch-wide drywall blade will work 
best, but you can also do this with a 6-inch knife. 
</P>
<P>
As you apply this second layer, try to "feather" the compound out onto the 
surrounding wall surface, so that the edges are fairly thin. Don't worry if 
there are ridges or slight irregularities in this layer, as they'll be sanded 
out later. Once again, allow the patch to dry overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Sand the patch with 120-grit sandpaper, using either a drywall sanding pad or a 
3-x-6-inch block of wood. What you're trying to achieve here is a smooth patch 
that tapers off onto the surrounding wall without obvious edges. 
</P>
<P>
Sand carefully, so that you don't penetrate into the underlying paper. If you 
can't get a smooth, well-blended patch after two coats of joint compound, apply 
a third layer and feather it even farther out onto the surrounding wall. Let it 
dry and sand it smooth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Textured Surfaces 
</P>
<P>
If the wall has a textured surface, you'll also need to match the texture in 
order to have the patch completely blend in. In older homes the texture may 
have been painted on, or hand applied with a trowel; newer homes typically have 
texturing that is blown onto the walls with an air-powered spray rig. 
</P>
<P>
In either case, texturing your patch will require some patience and 
imagination. Begin by studying the existing texture, and try to determine how 
it might have been applied and how you can best duplicate it. Spray texture has 
the appearance of random globs when viewed closely, and can be matched by 
thinning joint compound with water, then flicking it onto the wall with the end 
of a paint brush or whisk broom. 
</P>
<P>
You might also try applying regular joint compound with a trowel, a stiff 
brush, a sponge or some crumpled newspaper, or try thinned-down compound 
applied with a heavy paint roller. A little experimentation is all it takes for 
a perfect match.

FLAGSTONE PATIO BEST BUILT ON LEVEL GROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By READER'S DIGEST, For The Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A flagstone patio is attractive, practical and creates a bridge between your 
house and the outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
It is best built on a level or gently sloping site. When designing it, consider 
shade, privacy and access from the house. Avoid placing it where an overhanging 
roof will drip water on it as heavy rains can cause the stones to settle 
unevenly. 
</P>
<P>
Flagstones come in many sizes, starting at a nominal 12-inch stone and 
increasing by 6-inch increments to 36 inches and occasionally 42 inches. In 
reality, the stones are slightly smaller, by about a 1/2-inch in each 
direction. Use the nominal size in your plans since a small space is left 
between stones. 
</P>
<P>
Although sold as 1 1/2 inches thick, they actually range from 1 1/2 to 2 
inches. Compensate for this by putting more or less sand beneath each stone. 
</P>
<P>
When ordering, specify the size of your patio. (The length and width should be 
divisible by 6 inches.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Base 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lay the patio on a 3-inch bed of sand over a 4-inch gravel base, for 
drainage. (In areas where theground freezes, it is best to lay a patio on a 
reinforced concrete base.) 
</P>
<P>
 -- Use crushed aggregate for the gravel and concrete sand, which is coarser 
than mason's sand. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Order these by the cubic yard. To calculate the amount needed, multiply 
thickness by width by length. Be sure all measurements are in feet (for 
example, 4 inches equals one-third of a foot). Then divide the product by 27. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Planning 
</P>
<P>
1. When the flagstones arrive, measure each and record its dimensions. 
</P>
<P>
2. Make a scale drawing of the patio on graph paper. Let 1 inch equal 1 foot. 
</P>
<P>
3. Using colored paper, cut out a shape representing each stone. Label each 
piece, and move the pieces around on the graph paper until you get a pleasing 
pattern. 
</P>
<P>
4. Paste the shapes on the graph paper. This is your plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tools 
</P>
<P>
You will need a spade, iron rake, wheelbarrow, hand cart (optional), pry bar, 
stonemason's chisel, mason's hammer or steel mallet, hammer, broom, garden 
hose, safety goggles, disposable paintbrush, carpenter's level, string, 
scissors, 4-d galvanized nails, 1-by-8 pine for forms, 1-by-4 stakes 11 to 12 
inches long, creosote, a 2-by-4 for leveling and another for tamping. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Construction 
</P>
<P>
1. Drive temporary stakes at the patio corners, allowing 1 1/2 inches extra on 
each side for wooden forms. Run string between the stakes to outline the patio. 
Measure the diagonals. If the patio is a true rectangle, they will be equal. 
</P>
<P>
2. Dig out the soil to a depth of 8 1/2 inches. Be sure the bottom of the 
excavation is level. Set aside some turf and topsoil for later use. 
</P>
<P>
3. Paint creosote on the 1-by-8 boards for the forms. Also paint permanent 
1-by-4 stakes. 
</P>
<P>
4. Place the 1-by-8 boards around the perimeter of the excavation. Drive the 
permanent stakes at the corners and additional stakes where the ends of the 
boards meet. Nail stakes to form boards with 4-d nails. 
</P>
<P>
5. Spread gravel in the excavated area to a depth of 4 inches. Rake it smooth, 
then use a 2-by-4 level to pack it. Place carpenter's level on top of the 
2-by-4 and move it around to check if the gravel is level. 
</P>
<P>
6. Spread sand over the gravel. Level and pack it. 
</P>
<P>
7. Begin laying stones, following the pattern you made. Leave a 1/2-inch gap 
between stones. Stand on each stone to make sure it doesn't teeter. Use a pry 
bar to raise one edge of the stone to shift its position or to add or remove 
sand beneath it to make it level with the other stones. Tamp stones down with a 
rubber mallet. 
</P>
<P>
8. Mix sand with some topsoil. Spread the mixture on the patio and sweep it 
into the spaces between the stones. Water the surface to pack down the mixture. 
Let dry. Repeat with more sand and soil until the joints are filled. Pack the 
edges of the patio and cover the dirt with the turf removed earlier. 
</P>
<P>
9. Perimeter stones may have to be cut to fit. If so, wear safety goggles. 
Pencil a line where a piece is to be cut. Score along the line, using a chisel 
and hammer or steel mallet. Score a line on opposite face. Place a board under 
the stone, with the section to be removed overhanging. Tap the excess section 
with the hammer or mallet until it breaks off.

INSTALLING WOODEN FLOOR ON TOP OF CONCRETE BASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BD Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I know a wood floor can be installed over concrete because I have 
seen it on two occasions. In neither case was the owner of the house able to 
tell me how it had been done, since it was there when the houses were 
purchased. My plan is to put tongue-and-groove flooring over a concrete floor 
in what once was a garage. Can you at least give me a hint on how it is done? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: A wood floor can be placed over concrete by first setting 2-by-4s into 
mastic spread on the concrete. There are two ways to do this. One is to place 
the mastic over the entire floor, in which case only about one-eighth of an 
inch is required. Or you can put mastic on the floor only where the 2-by-4s or 
screeds will be placed. The mastic then should be twice as thick. You will need 
2-by-6s and 2-by-8s along the walls. The flooring is attached to the screeds 
after it has set thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shellac Stick Available for Fixing Furniture 
</P>
<P>
Q: I read somewhere about a product called a shellac stick. If I recall 
rightly, it could be used for repairing scratches or other small furniture 
mars. Do you know if this is still available? My local hardware store says if 
there was such an item it probably isn't made any more. He says I must be 
thinking of wax sticks. Is he right? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. There was -- and is -- such a thing as a shellac stick. It must be 
melted very carefully and requires a certain amount of expertise. Many 
professional wood finishers still use this shellac stick, but the wax stick is 
somewhat similar and easier to use. 
</P>
<P>
Pros say the shellac stick is superior. Try the wax stick and see how you make 
out. If you are dissatisfied, try the shellac stick, being sure you get the 
alcohol lamp and whatever else is required to get good results. You probably 
can use a wax stick easily the first time out, whereas the shellac stick is 
something you have to learn how to use. Both come in a variety of colors to 
match the wood you are repairing. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Ripsaw Leaves Rough Edge, Needs Sanding 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have worked with handsaws for many years but have never used a ripsaw, 
which I will have to do on an upcoming project. Anything I should know about 
using a ripsaw? 
</P>
<P>
A: The technique is very much the same, except a ripsaw should be held at about 
a 60-degree angle, whereas a crosscut saw is held at a 45-degree angle. 
Remember to do the same thing you do with a crosscut saw, cut on the waste side 
of the cutting line. One thing you will notice. The cut with a ripsaw usually 
is a lot rougher than with a crosscut saw, so you will have to smooth the edges 
with sandpaper when you complete the cutting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Avoid Extremes in Weather in Caulking 
</P>
<P>
Q: We want to caulk the outside of our house. Is spring a good time to do this? 
</P>
<P>
A: When caulking is required, any time is a good time to do it. When you have a 
choice, the fall is considered the proper time in areas where winter places a 
burden of some sort on the house. Proper caulking, for instance, can cut down 
on heating bills as well as permit air conditioning to work more efficiently. 
No matter when you do the caulking, it is best to avoid extremes of 
temperature. 
</P>
<P>
Wants to Know Size of Drill to Purchase 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am about to purchase an electric drill. My home center carries three 
sizes. Is there any special one I should buy? 
</P>
<P>
A: The 1/4-inch drill usually is the starting tool, but the 3/8-inch drill has 
become very popular in recent years because it handles heavier work a bit more 
easily, whereas a 1/2-inch drill is more in the commercial line or at least for 
serious, heavy-duty workers. Remember the size designates the size of the chuck 
into which the bit fits. A 1/4-inch drill, for instance, can handle bits that 
cut into wood and make 1/2-inch holes, providing the chuck of the bit is no 
larger than 1/4-inch. The same goes for the other sizes. 
</P>
<P>
The techniques of using varnish, shellac, lacquer, stain, sealer, bleach, 
remover, etc., are detailed in Andy Lang's booklet, "Wood Finishing in the 
Home," which can be obtained by sending $1 to Know-How, P.0. Box 477, 
Huntington, N.Y. 11743. Questions of general interest will be answered in the

HOMEOWNERS NOT BORED, STILL LIKE HARDWOOD FLOORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From various sources come these bits of information of interest to the 
homeowner: 
</P>
<P>
Even thought the construction industry no longer was required to use hardwood 
flooring in newly built houses since the mid-'60s, more than 4.2 billion board 
feet of strip wood floors have been installed since. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for the continuing popularity of hardwood flooring was the 
fact that high-tech Urethane finishes and sealers changed the way of hardwood 
floor maintenance. Some consumers, however, have maintained their perception of 
past maintenance problems. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Reynolds, president of Bonakemi USA, manufacturer of hardwood floor 
products, says homeowners who have their hardwood floors refinished make the 
mistake of not asking about the type of finish or treatment to be used. 
</P>
<P>
He suggests asking such questions as: What products are being used, how long 
can the refinishing be expected to last, whether the job will save on the cost 
of long-term maintenance and whether some other product or treatment might save 
time and money in the future? 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds says new formulations make finishes odorless, smooth flowing and fast 
drying, making it possible to stain and finish a hardwood floor in one day.

RID PEELING SURFACE OF MOISTURE PROBLEM BEFORE NEW PAINT JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When excess moisture is trapped in a home, it often manifests itself in a rash 
of blistering, cracking and peeling paint. 
</P>
<P>
Smothered under a fresh coat of color, Country Home magazine says, even small 
amounts of moisture can cause wood to swell and break the adhesion of the 
bottom layer. Hence, beautifully painted walls, ceilings and other surfaces 
quickly transform into ragged skins. 
</P>
<P>
There is no sense in repainting a damaged surface until moisture problems have 
been solved. The first step in treating peeling paint is to locate and remove 
sources of moisture. 
</P>
<P>
Install exhaust fans and vents to remove excess interior moisture from 
bathrooms. Check for leaky plumbing or disconnected dryer exhaust pipes. Keep 
moisture from entering the home from the outside by correcting the following 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Faulty Flashing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Leaking gutters. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Defective roof shingles. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Deteriorated caulking in joints and seams 
</P>
<P>
 -- Shrubbery growing too close to painted wood. 
</P>
<P>
After the moisture problems have been solved, allow the home to dry out 
thoroughly. Once dry, the damaged paint should be scraped off. The the surface 
can be repainted. 
</P>
<P>
If working with a historically significant structure, keep a small sample of 
the original paint. Cover a small area with a metal plate or mark it in some 
way so that future investigators will have a record of the building's paint 
history.

NEW DEVICE SOUNDS OFF BEFORE QUAKE RUMBLES BY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SPENCER S. HSU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The classroom of 4-year-olds was observing a morning rest period. The 20 or so 
children napped, assembled puzzles at tables or played in a miniature kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, a high-pitched tone pierced through the day-care center. Children 
looked up and then ducked beneath their desks as they had been drilled. Their 
teacher called out instructions, then moved to a doorway. 
</P>
<P>
Three seconds later, the June 12 earthquake centered beneath Montebello rumbled 
through the Culver City Tiny Tots preschool. While the floor shook and windows 
rattled in the 4.5-magnitude temblor, children crouched under desks, hands 
folded over their necks. At the same time, another class on the playground had 
moved away from the building, while a third group ducked below tables in 
another part of the school. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Met With Skepticism 
</P>
<P>
The alarm worked again half an hour later for the 4.3 aftershock. 
</P>
<P>
The school's 65 children, ages 2 to 6, had reacted to a new, low-cost 
earthquake warning device donated by one student's father. 
</P>
<P>
David Elliot, 38, and two friends are the creators of California QuakeAwake, a 
$30-device shaped like a white triangular smoke alarm said to provide up to 30 
seconds' warning of approaching temblors. 
</P>
<P>
Although the earthquakes were relatively minor, Elliot and fellow entrepreneurs 
Ken Caillat and David Elston believe their product passed a crucial test. 
</P>
<P>
Since it began two years ago as an idea in a Malibu guest house, the device 
manufactured by California QuakeAwake Inc. has frequently encountered skeptics. 
But, since production began last December, the Century City company has seen 
sales slowly climb and has distributed 10,000 QuakeAwake alarms to 200 stores 
in California and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Chain retailers, including Fedco, Home Club and National Lumber, have stocked 
alarms, and the entrepreneurs are directing marketing efforts at other 
earthquake-leery regions worldwide, including Japan, Mexico, Taiwan and eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Technology Sound 
</P>
<P>
State earthquake experts say the alarm's technology is sound. 
</P>
<P>
"The principle behind these devices is valid," says Wilfred D. Iwan, Caltech 
professor of engineering and applied sciences and former chairman of the 
California Seismic Safety Commission. Iwan, like all state and academic 
officials contacted, does not endorse commercial products. 
</P>
<P>
According to Iwan and the product's makers, the alarm works by sensing seismic 
"waves" emitted by earthquakes. There are two kinds of waves: P-waves -- 
"pressure" or "primary" waves, and S-waves -- "secondary" or "shear" waves. 
Seismic waves are analogous to sound waves but travel through the earth rather 
than the air. 
</P>
<P>
P-waves travel faster than S-waves and yield about one-fifth of a second 
warning for each mile away from the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
A person on top of a quake's epicenter would receive almost no warning. But if 
a quake occurred, say, on the San Andreas Fault, residents of Culver City 45 
miles away could expect up to nine seconds of notice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slept Through Aftershock 
</P>
<P>
Elliot, formerly a traveling merchandiser of promotional theater goods, saw the 
need for an earthquake alarm when he slept through the 5.4-magnitude aftershock 
of the October, 1987, Whittier quake. Staying in a guest room overlooking a 
cliff at Caillat's Malibu home, the Culver City resident and father of two 
nervously questioned Caillat, 42, about the prospects for a homemade alarm. 
</P>
<P>
He discovered his friend had already tackled the problem: Caillat had taken a 
cue from a dining room chandelier and hung a wrench next to a wall as a sort of 
detector. 
</P>
<P>
Within a day of the Whittier aftershock, the pair had built an electrical 
prototype of the pendulum using the miniature "tilt" component in one of 
Caillat's pinball machines. Calling himself a tinkerer and an inventor, Caillat 
has designed items such as a talking doorbell and a record production studio. 
In 1977, he won a Grammy Award for producing the rock album "Rumours" for 
Fleetwood Mac. 
</P>
<P>
By December, 1988, the pair had researched the P-wave, developed a prototype, 
raised $40,000 from family investors and brought aboard Elston, 38, a 
Connecticut real estate developer who moved to California in 1983. The three 
began working out of Elston's Rancho Park apartment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Marketing Challenge 
</P>
<P>
By last month, they were considering marketing strategies. Caillat and Elliot 
watch as a mellow voice from the television set asks, "Are you prepared for a 
major earthquake?" 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, the answer: "With California QuakeAwake, you are." 
</P>
<P>
Scrutinizing a two-minute video marketing clip, the pair review their latest 
promotion. Elston is in New York City meeting potential investors. 
</P>
<P>
Although the two men smile sheepishly at the video -- which ends as a heavy 
picture frame drops onto a just-vacated infant's crib during a temblor -- they 
are serious about taking advantage of a quake-wary Southern California market 
and about their device's potential for saving lives. 
</P>
<P>
Caillat imagines QuakeAwake's possibilities: Alarms in schools, hospitals and 
factories. Shop awnings that spring open, sheltering pedestrians from falling 
glass of skyscrapers. Window blinds that automatically shut in the home. Lathes 
and machinery shutting down seconds before quakes strike, and computer-linked 
water and gas lines shutting off in residences and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Safety Issues Studied 
</P>
<P>
After years of not taking commercial concerns seriously, Iwan said, California 
authorities and the National Research Council have convened committees to 
explore the usefulness of "real-time earthquake monitoring" and other quake 
safety issues. The scientist, a member of the national panel, says there is 
growing recognition of possibilities for immediate quake detection, especially 
in areas of government emergency response. 
</P>
<P>
Private application in homes and businesses, however, "really is a marketing 
question," Iwan says. 
</P>
<P>
The circumstances for marketing the product look ideal -- there is only one 
competitor in the earthquake alarm field, and its products costs thousands of 
dollars because it uses very sensitive technology. But the aspiring 
manufacturers also know that at least five other companies have tried without 
success to market earthquake detection devices in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Technological advances, computer communication possibilities and their own 
marketing success have convinced the three that their wall-mounted device 
offers better applications and reliability at lower cost than the earlier 
devices. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Rejection 
</P>
<P>
Elliot says he and his partners have come a long way from their first idea for 
a commercial product: a red and gold plastic box and pendulum set -- "basically 
a Mickey Mouse-looking thing," he says -- that was rejected by the first design 
agency they consulted. 
</P>
<P>
And although they do not plan to market QuakeAwake in areas unaccustomed to 
earthquakes -- such as New York, says Elston -- they're confident they can sell 
their product to anyone willing to listen. 
</P>
<P>
"The first reaction is always a chuckle at first," Elliot says. 
</P>
<P>
"But once we explain what it does, that's when people go, 'Ah, I want one of 
those.' " 
</P>

STATE APPROVES PLAN TO FINISH HIKING TRAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN TICE, Tice is a Pasadena free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Years ago, many hikers with more enthusiasm than experience would trudge into 
Bailey Canyon, a rugged gorge in the San Gabriel Mountains, only to be rescued 
many hours or days later, lost, cold, hungry and sometimes seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until the late 1960s that hikers could find their way in the canyon 
along a trail that was carved by a small group of teen-age boys who called 
themselves the Sierra Madre Mountaineers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$50,000 Grant 
</P>
<P>
But the Mountaineers, whose goal was to cut a three-mile zigzag path to Jones 
Peak, a 3,400-foot ridge to the northeast of the canyon, abandoned the task 
when it was two-thirds finished. Today, the map board in Bailey Canyon Park 
labels the final approach to Jones Peak as an "uncompleted trail." But to many 
hikers, "deer path" would be more accurate. 
</P>
<P>
Sierra Madre officials were notified in May that the State Department of Parks 
and Recreation has approved a proposal by the city to finish the job that the 
Mountaineers started. 
</P>
<P>
A $50,000 grant will be used to repair the existing trail, complete it to Jones 
Peak and create a new three-mile segment that will link it to the Mt. Wilson 
Trail in Little Santa Anita Canyon. Planning for the project will begin later 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Bailey Canyon was one of the best places for trapping," says Earl Lalone, 64, 
a Sierra Madre native who remembers the canyon from the 1930s and who still 
hikes there. "Up there we would get fox, raccoon, ring-tailed cat and coyote. 
We shipped the pelts to a furrier in Chicago." 
</P>
<P>
With his three brothers, Lalone was among the original members of the Sierra 
Madre Search and Rescue Team. His son, Chris, was one of the Mountaineers in 
the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey Canyon, one of several smaller canyons that slice into the mountains 
between Eaton Canyon on the west and Little Santa Anita Canyon on the east, was 
a logical place for the Mountaineers to create a path. They had grown up 
listening to their fathers, members of the Sierra Madre Search and Rescue Team, 
describe rescue operations in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Site of Rescue 
</P>
<P>
And the canyon, which starts at the northern end of Lima Street, was the site 
of a rescue that sparked the formation of the volunteer Search and Rescue Team 
in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
When their sons came up with the plan to aid hikers in Bailey Canyon with the 
trail, their fathers not only encouraged them but served as advisers, along 
with representatives of the U.S. Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
For several years the group got together on weekends and during school 
vacations, putting in hundreds of hours of work cutting switchbacks, or zigzag 
paths, up the east side of the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
They had completed the trail just beyond a point known as "the promontory," a 
spur of land next to the trail that drops off sharply on three sides, leaving a 
small, flat open area. Knee-high stone walls are the only remains of a cabin 
built there in 1910. Here the proposed trail would have climbed eastward, away 
from Bailey Canyon, zigzagging to the top of the peak. 
</P>
<P>
But from the site of the cabin the trail fades rapidly. With more than two 
miles completed -- about 2,000 feet of elevation gain -- the workers abandoned 
their project. 
</P>
<P>
Rae Anderson, whose three sons were members of the Mountaineers, says that as 
the boys became young men, much of their enthusiasm was "diverted to cars and 
girls." To finance their new interests, they found paying summer jobs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fire and Flood Damage 
</P>
<P>
In October, 1978, a fire swept over the ridge and burned Bailey Canyon almost 
to the stream bed near its mouth. Two months later, heavy rains resulted in 
flooding, and the ground cover's being reduced to ashes led to devastating 
erosion of the trail. 
</P>
<P>
All things considered, the existing trail is in good shape today. Over the past 
decade, local Boy Scouts and other groups have done intermittent sand-bagging 
to shore up weak spots along the trail's edge. 
</P>
<P>
Slopes cleared by the 1978 fire have been reclaimed by typical chaparral. The 
canyon is alive again. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as last summer, the Sierra Madre Police Department required hikers 
to obtain a permit to enter the mountains above town during the peak fire 
season. 
</P>
<P>
But since Pasadena, Arcadia and the Angeles National Forest, which border 
Sierra Madre, require no permit, Fire Marshal Bill Kramer said Sierra Madre 
will waive the permit requirement on a one-year, experimental basis. 
</P>
<P>
An advantage to hiking Bailey Canyon is that one does not have to slink across 
back fences or sprint past privately owned beehives to reach the trail. It lies 
entirely on public lands, starting on the edge of Sierra Madre at the end of 
Grove Street. The hiker earns a feeling of accomplishment in the rough terrain 
and is rewarded by lofty overviews of the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Hiking purists do not fear that the trail will be clogged by mountain bikes 
after the city's work on the trail is completed. It is narrow, and features 
dozens of hairpin turns. 
</P>
<P>
There are disadvantages, too. The present trail does not connect with any 
other. After toiling more than two miles, hikers must turn back, or crawl and 
thrash their way over three more miles of manzanita-covered slopes to reach the 
Mt. Wilson Trail. 
</P>
<P>
Jones Peak Trail is not for couch potatoes. It is steep and "as crooked as a 
dog's hind leg," a veteran hiker once said. When the sun is high, there is 
little shade. 
</P>
<P>
The entrance to the canyon is in Bailey Canyon Park; the upper reaches extend 
well into Angeles National Forest. The start of the trail is reached by passing 
to the west of the flood control basin in Bailey Canyon Park and then, at a 
locked gate, bearing to the left into the mouth of the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The large buildings with red tile roofs visible on the hillside to the west are 
the Passionist Fathers Monastery and Retreat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Low Brush 
</P>
<P>
Winter flooding over the years has eroded the stream banks near the canyon 
entrance, isolating a short nature loop-trail on a bench of land opposite the 
main trail. The trail winds into the canyon through low brush and a scattering 
of sycamore and oak. 
</P>
<P>
A quarter of a mile beyond the flood control basin, at the foot of a 35-foot 
pine, the trail begins the long ascent to Jones Peak. The slopes are covered by 
thick brush -- mostly manzanita -- and an occasional yucca. The rustling in the 
bushes turns out to be a squirrel, rabbit or scrub jay. Tiny lizards leap away 
at a hiker's approach. 
</P>
<P>
At the cabin ruins, the trail swings away from Bailey Canyon and enters a 
forest of pine and big cone spruce and then ends in thick brush.

ALTADENANS WANT VICTORIAN FOR TOWN HALL

<P>
Taking the first step toward transforming a Victorian-style house into a 
combination town hall, museum and community center, about 20 representatives 
from 16 local organizations said they will form a nonprofit group to raise 
funds for the project. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to take everybody's effort," said Tim Gregory, chairman of Altadena 
Heritage, a preservationist group, at a recent meeting of the representatives. 
"We're facing a very grim deadline." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Supervisor's Support 
</P>
<P>
To save the building from demolition, the community must come up with an 
estimated $220,000 to move and restore the Hawkins House in central Altadena 
before the buyer of the house wins county approval to build a mini-mall on the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
An official of Nottingham Ltd., the Baldwin Park-based development firm that is 
buying the 6,000-square-foot structure, expects the approval process to take at 
least six months. 
</P>
<P>
Another $250,000 will be sought to construct a multipurpose room and theater 
addition after the building is moved to county-owned land less than a mile away 
on El Molino Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Michael Antonovich, whose 5th District includes the unincorporated 
community of 42,000, agreed at a meeting with Altadena Heritage representatives 
in May to support a proposed lease of the county property. 
</P>
<P>
The house, built in 1891 by the Rowan family amid an orange grove, was a 
barn-like structure until it was remodeled in 1897 by Adelbert and Sarah 
Stevens. In 1915, the house became a home for retired Methodist ministers. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawkins family has owned the property for the past 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Council Meets at Library 
</P>
<P>
The 14-member Altadena Town Council, which has not had a permanent home since 
its creation 13 years ago, now meets at the Altadena Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
A town hall would "improve the pride in the community," said Councilman Duane 
Merrill before the meeting. "It would give you a place to hang your hat, store 
your records." 
</P>
<P>
Minutes from council meetings are now kept at the library. Also, historical 
memorabilia of the area has been in storage for three years because there is no 
museum, said Mary Jane Crunk, president of the Altadena Historical Society. 
</P>
<P>
Nottingham Ltd. has agreed that, if it does not have to pay to demolish the 
house, it will contribute to the project some of the money it expects to save. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Developer's Plan 
</P>
<P>
The firm, which intends to build a small shopping center at the site, will also 
provide expertise from its community relations staff to publicize the project. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd anticipated we might have some trouble getting a demolition permit" 
because of the house's architectural value, said Jonathan Webb, director of 
development for Nottingham Ltd. He offered to donate the house when he met 
Gregory at an Altadena Land Use Committee hearing to review plans for a 
mini-mall. 
</P>
<P>
Giving the house to Altadena Heritage "just seemed like a perfect match," Webb 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit group, which seeks to protect historical and cultural resources, 
will be the custodian for funds raised until the new organization is 
incorporated, Gregory said. After that, the project would become a 
communitywide effort, with representatives from various local groups -- 
including the town council and Chamber of Commerce -- forming the board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
"The broader the participation, the more chance for bucks," said Ned Estey of 
Theatre Americana, Altadena's 55-year-old community theater group, which also 
does not have a permanent facility. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory, the chairman of Altadena Heritage, told the gathering that, even if 
enough money is not raised in time, the effort to find a building should 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't have to be (the Hawkins House)," he said. "It's the idea of a town 
hall." 
</P>
<P>
Gregory said the organization would eventually assume responsibility for 
managing the building. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Land Use 
</P>
<P>
The group plans to meet with county officials to draw up the lease for the El 
Molino property. Located between a fire station and a sheriff's station, the 
land is designated for general public use, said Ollie Blannin, Antonovich's 
senior deputy. 
</P>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors must approve the lease, and the county Regional 
Planning Commission must approve the use of the land.

HOSPITAL RECEIVES AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Huntington Memorial Hospital has received the third annual transportation award 
of excellence from Commuter Transportation Services (Commuter Computer). The 
award recognizes outstanding efforts to improve air-quality, traffic and 
parking problems. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital's commuter alternatives program provides for monetary incentives, 
facility improvements and a marketing program to encourage ride-sharing among 
its 3,500 employees. The Huntington was the first organization in Pasadena to 
hire a full-time coordinator to implement the program. 
</P>
<P>
The plan offers subsidies for new van pools and nearly half-price bus passes. 
After employees pay for a month's worth of bus tickets or van pool expenses, 
the hospital pays the fees for the second month. Employees then must resume the 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital plans to add 140 preferred parking spaces for car pools and van 
pools. 
</P>
<P>
The plan also calls for a hospital shuttle service for employees who live 
within half a mile of the hospital and guarantees a ride home in case of 
emergency for any employee who ride shares.

ZAN THOMPSON: AN IOWA TRAVELOGUE: FIELDS OF DREAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Zan Thompson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
She's flown over the ocean in a plane, seen the jungle when it's wet with rain, 
taken a slow boat to China and put her camel to sleep. She has also cruised the 
Amazon and traveled and vacationed in 38 states. She is my treasured friend, 
Barbara Maple, and it is ridiculous to name the places she has been except to 
tell you that she has been to Paris 14 times. Of course, some of those Paris 
trips have been on the way somewhere else, like East Germany or Alsace. It's 
easier to riffle the pages of the Almanac and say, "Barbara was there." 
</P>
<P>
Now, she has taken a trip which, she says, is probably her absolute favorite, 
although it is not comparable to Singapore or Israel, because it is Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
She told me all about it over the weekend when I was sitting in her tall, 
gray-shingled house looking out over the Pacific to Catalina. 
</P>
<P>
I am one of those people who would draw a map of the United States as 
consisting of two coastlines, and between these coasts is the middle, which 
holds the Mississippi River, the Grand Canyon and the Rockies. I know nothing 
more about Iowa than I know of the moons of Uranus. I have never even known 
anyone from Iowa. Once I went to Chicago to make a speech and rode a cab to and 
from the airport. That was my trip to the Middle West. I know that makes me 
hopelessly parochial. 
</P>
<P>
But now Barb has me convinced that Iowa is one of the most delightful places in 
the world, like visiting inside a portfolio of Norman Rockwell paintings, 
embellished with rich, nourishing food and towns full of people who have just 
won the Golden Hospitality Award. 
</P>
<P>
Her mentor and the leader of the tour was a woman named Gwen Znerold who lives 
in Des Moines and takes groups of 35 people at a time to see the sights where 
the tall corn grows. She is an art and antiques appraiser, and speaks all over 
the United States on antiques, silver and glass. 
</P>
<P>
One of the women on this trip was going to Iowa for Znerold's tour for the 
third time. Barbara was going for the second time, and, for heaven's sake, I 
want to go. There were also five men on this trip, all of them informed antique 
buffs. 
</P>
<P>
Every person on the tour was from California and had heard Znerold speak here. 
She does one regular tour of California every winter. 
</P>
<P>
The group was met by a four-piece brass band playing a Meredith Willson tune. 
They were introduced and entertained all around Des Moines. 
</P>
<P>
They had a magnificent dinner at the governor's mansion, which is known as 
Terrace Hill. They were the guests of Gov. Terry Bransdadt in the immense, 
gold-filigreed, Italian-Victorian house that Znerold had decorated with 
furnishings and bric-a-brac that she found for the house. One of the appetizers 
was cream cheese with sherry and chutney, smoothed on a crisp, sliced bagel. 
</P>
<P>
They saw farm houses and city houses, fields of corn and rolling green hills, 
more green than Ireland, Barbara said. I think Barbara may have gone a bit too 
far with that Iowa hyperbole. 
</P>
<P>
They visited Galena, a small town where the father of Ulysses S. Grant had a 
leather shop. When Grant had finished duty as commanding general of the Union 
Army in the Civil War, he returned to Galena where the grateful populace built 
him a large and spacious house. His wife, who was dear to him, had an eye 
problem that would have taken only minor surgery to repair. But Ulysses 
wouldn't allow her to have it done. He said, "I couldn't love her more than I 
do right now so I don't want her to change anything." 
</P>
<P>
In Galena is the old DeSoto Hotel with its balcony where Grant made a speech. 
</P>
<P>
In Des Moines, there are 30 blocks of skyway, which is a suspended glass 
passageway that connects office buildings, shops and restaurants so people can 
walk out of the rain, snow or heat. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara even heard a great New Orleans jazz band concert and visited a 
Christmas shop where one tourist spent $500. 
</P>
<P>
Of course I wish I had been along. Barbara is good fun as a traveling companion 
because she always sees something exciting and interesting to tuck in her 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara had such a good time, she even invited the bus driver, Larry, and his 
wife and daughter, Laura, to visit her and her husband, Earl, at Balboa 
Peninsula.

ASSAULT GUN BAN MADE PERMANENT; 
</P>
<P>
U.S. EMBARGOES 43 MILITARY-STYLE WEAPONS, INCLUDING AK-47S AND UZIS 
</P>

<P>
The vast majority of assault weapons barred from importation since spring will 
be banned permanently from the United States, the government announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The ban imposed on 43 styles of semiautomatic weapons -- including the popular 
Chinese-made AK-47 and Israeli-made Uzi carbine -- followed a four-month study 
by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms on whether the weapons met the 
standards imposed by the Gun Control Act of 1968, which barred importation of 
weapons that are not used for legitimate sporting purposes. 
</P>
<P>
"The study was undertaken because of the dramatic increase in the number of 
these weapons being imported and police reports of their use in violent crime," 
said Stephen E. Higgins, ATF director. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
7 Permitted 
</P>
<P>
While the 43 were banned permanently, another seven whose imports had been 
suspended since early spring will be available for import again as a result of 
the study. Those include six .22-rimfire caliber rifles and a gun called the 
Valmet Hunter, which had been considered an AK-47 type of weapon during the 
suspension. 
</P>
<P>
The ATF, which studied the marketing and use of the weapons, said the models 
banned were not being used for sporting purposes. Such weapons were identified 
officially Friday as "semiautomatic assault rifles." 
</P>
<P>
The ATF annually traces 35,000 to 40,000 guns used in crimes, and about 10% of 
them are semiautomatic assault weapons, Higgins said. He estimated that 
slightly more than half of them were domestic makes that are not subject to ATF 
control. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not saying that it (the assault weapon importation ban) will solve the 
basic problem" of crime, Higgins said, adding, "Their use in crime is probably 
disproportionately high compared with the number that are here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Folding Stock 
</P>
<P>
Holding aloft one of the banned weapons -- an Israeli-made Galil rifle -- 
Higgins pointed out some of the accouterments that led to its prohibition: a 
folding stock, a night sight, a flash suppressor on the end that could serve as 
a grenade launcher, its ability to accept a bayonet lug, a pistol grip and a 
large magazine. 
</P>
<P>
In the future, he said, weapons with several of these features probably also 
would be subject to an import ban. 
</P>
<P>
Higgins estimated that the Customs Service has seized about 20,000 of the 
weapons and that those will not be allowed into the country unless purchased by 
law enforcement agencies. Asked whether the government will pay damages to 
importers, Higgins said, "That's something the court would decide." 
</P>
<P>
Three importers already have sued the government over the suspension, and 
although a U.S. District Court has upheld the government in one of the cases, 
Higgins said the ATF would accept comments on the permanent ban from any 
importers for 30 days. The final regulations would be issued "very quickly" 
after that, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why the ATF previously had allowed imports of the now-banned weapons, 
Higgins said the committee set up after the 1968 law was passed to determine 
whether guns qualified for import had "concentrated primarily, almost 
exclusive, on handguns." It was not until the number of assault weapons being 
imported increased dramatically that the ATF focused on them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Action Lauded 
</P>
<P>
The action Friday was lauded by gun control advocates, but John M. Snyder, 
spokesman for the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, said 
it "shows the undependability of government, because originally, the ATF had 
certified that these rifles could be imported because they are suitable for 
sporting purposes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it also tends to further undermine whatever credibility President Bush 
has left with the firearms-owning community in the United States," Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, a hunter and a lifetime member of the National Rifle Assn., came into 
office opposing any ban on assault weapons despite an outcry over their 
increasing popularity among drug gangs and a heightened public concern 
triggered by the January schoolyard slayings of five children in Stockton, 
Calif., by a man wielding an AK-47. 
</P>
<P>
However, Bush asked William J. Bennett, the director of the Office of National 
Drug Control Policy, to advise him on what to do about the weapons. In March, 
at Bennett's urging, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady suspended the 
importation of many of the weapons, and Bush expanded the list the next month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. Guns Not Affected 
</P>
<P>
The ATF, which has the power to control imports, does not regulate domestic 
manufacture of weapons, so similar weapons made in the United States would not 
be affected by the action. Several bills pending in Congress would control or 
eliminate many of the U.S.-made assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The ATF has estimated that domestic models account for 75% of the 3 million 
semiautomatic rifles now owned by Americans. Colt Industries Inc. suspended 
sales of its AR-15, the most popular of the domestic assault semiautomatic 
rifles, in March. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Brady, chairwoman of Handgun Control Inc., praised the ATF's action as 
Bush's "leadership in working toward reducing assault weapon violence by 
stopping the import of these weapons of war." 
</P>
<P>
"I urge the President and the Congress to continue in the direction of public 
safety by passing legislation to stop the domestic production of assault 
weapons," said Brady, whose husband, former White House press secretary Jim 
Brady, was severely wounded in the 1981 assassination attempt on President 
Ronald Reagan. "It is no more acceptable to have citizens being gunned down by 
killing machines wearing a 'Made in the USA' label than by those made abroad." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gun Limits Decried 
</P>
<P>
The NRA has argued vociferously against limits on the rights of law-abiding 
citizens to own the weapons and has urged a crackdown on criminals rather than 
gun-control laws. 
</P>
<P>
The weapons on the original suspension list come primarily from China, Israel, 
West Germany and Belgium. Others are made in Austria, Australia, Italy and 
Switzerland, among other countries.

CONGRESSIONAL STAFF OF 15,000 IS LARGE ENOUGH TO FILL A TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On New Year's Day, 1934, Alice Klopstad stepped off the train at Washington's 
Union Station, a 22-year-old shorthand whiz on her first trip away from her 
home town of Spink, S.D. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, she went to work as a secretary in Room 452 of the Senate Office 
Building, one of fewer than 600 employees on the staffs of the 96 senators and 
their committees. 
</P>
<P>
How that 600 has grown. 
</P>
<P>
Today, about 4,000 people work for 100 senators; committees employ 1,700 more. 
The story in the House is similar. In 1934 there were 992 employees; in 1989, 
between members and committees, there are 9,683. 
</P>
<P>
In all, more than 15,000 people work for Congress -- enough for a medium-size 
town. 
</P>
<P>
One is Alice Klopstad Andersen, still deep in the congressional paper chase 55 
years after she took her first dictation for South Dakota Democrat William J. 
Bulow. Since 1973, she has been the administrative assistant to California Rep. 
Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's so Different' 
</P>
<P>
"Now, of course, it's so different," Andersen said. "You think of a rural area 
and now it's a metropolis. It's that different." 
</P>
<P>
It sure is. 
</P>
<P>
People worry about it. Political scientists write books about it. 
</P>
<P>
Some say the staffs have grown too big, that all they do is help their bosses 
get reelected. 
</P>
<P>
Others disagree. Congress needs more staff, they say, because it has more work 
to do now. 
</P>
<P>
As staffs have grown, so has their work space. 
</P>
<P>
The office Alice Andersen unlocks each morning shortly after 8 a.m. is Room 
2346 of the Rayburn House Office Building, one of three House office buildings 
-- and two annexes -- tourists encounter as they drive up the long slope of 
Independence Avenue to the south of the Capitol. On the northern, or Senate, 
side, are three Senate office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
By mid-afternoon, Andersen has papers spread all around her. Snatching some 
from a chair so a visitor can sit, she recalls that in 1934 she was one of four 
people on Bulow's Washington staff. He kept an office in South Dakota, to be 
sure, but it was in his home in Beresford. 
</P>
<P>
Her current employer, Moorhead, has a staff of nine in Washington, plus two 
back home in Glendale and three more in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Such district staffs are typical. In 1959, roughly half the members of Congress 
had full-time, year-round offices in their states or districts. Now all do, 
usually more than one. 
</P>
<P>
Sens. George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) and Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.) have eight home 
offices apiece. Sens. Donald W. Riegle Jr. and Carl Levin, both Michigan 
Democrats, each have seven. Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) has four district offices, 
staffed by 57 workers. 
</P>
<P>
Many congressional staff members, both in Washington and at home, work on 
"constituent services" -- dealing with complaints about their bosses' stand on 
an issue, answering questions about legislation, helping voters penetrate the 
bureaucracies of the Social Security Administration or the Veterans 
Administration, for example. 
</P>
<P>
Others assist their bosses in dealing with the welter of legislation before 
them. 
</P>
<P>
One recent day, as the Senate debated the budget resolution, four senators were 
on the floor. Two aides flanked Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-N.M.), thrusting 
papers in front of him. Across the aisle, Sen. Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.) conferred 
with two aides. More than a dozen others sat on a red plush bench in the rear 
of the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Or consider the role of staffs in melding divergent House and Senate versions 
of legislation into one bill both houses can accept. For example: 
</P>
<P>
In Room 2175 of the Rayburn Building, where House and Senate conferees are 
discussing the minimum wage bill, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), chairman of 
the Senate Labor Committee, leafed through the conference agenda. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my understanding," he said, "that there has been agreement at the staff 
level and we do have recommendations on items 2, 3, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 
16. It is my understanding we can just go through those or just move to adopt 
them if there is no further discussion." 
</P>
<P>
There was none. 
</P>
<P>
Items 4 to 7, on the other hand, dealt with the sub-minimum training wage, a 
key point of dispute between congressional Democrats and the Bush 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"We have indicated they couldn't be part of a staff recommendation and would be 
decided by the members," Kennedy said. After brief discussion, the items were 
left in. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Kennedy and Sen. James M. Jeffords (R-Vt.), the only senators 
present, had to leave for a vote on the floor. Representing the Senate side was 
left to John V. Harvey Jr., 33, chief labor counsel of the committee, and a 
cluster of other staff members. 
</P>
<P>
That brief meeting on May 2 was the culmination of weeks of staff work, 
beginning when the bill passed the Senate on April 12. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic and Republican Senate aides met separately to formulate their 
positions. Then all the Senate aides got together. There were similar meetings 
in the House. Then there were four meetings of aides with the members of the 
conference committee, going through the agenda item by item, making objections, 
agreeing on changes. 
</P>
<P>
After each preliminary meeting, said one aide, the staffs carried the changes 
to their bosses for approval. "The member is always involved in terms of final 
approval," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When the conference committee met, said the aide, who commented on the 
condition he not be identified, "It was really easy. We didn't know until that 
moment that it was going to be easy." 
</P>
<P>
Andersen, reflecting on what staff members do, said, "There's a volume of work. 
I wouldn't think we needed all those people, but. . . ." She lets the thought 
trail off. 
</P>
<P>
Others are more blunt. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, they will get as many staff members as they possibly can," said 
Mark Liedl, director of the Congressional Assessment Project of the 
conservative Heritage Foundation. "As their power grows, they are able to get 
into more and more mischief, and I think having the staff is just another 
resource that allows them to." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Christopher J. Deering, an associate professor of political 
science at George Washington University who specializes in the study of 
Congress, said the number of congressional staff members is "hardly outrageous 
when you compare it to the size of the operation and the responsibilities that 
they have. It's really quite an appropriate staff level, it seems to me." 
</P>
<P>
Still, it is by far the largest staff of any legislative body in the world. The 
Canadian Parliament, which is second, has an administrative staff of 1,700 and 
an additional 1,500 employees who work for members. 
</P>
<P>
The swelling of congressional staffs -- from just over six per senator when 
Andersen arrived in Washington to 40 or more today -- was sharply criticized in 
a 1980 book by Michael J. Malbin, then a research fellow at the 
conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute. 
</P>
<P>
In "Unelected Representatives," Malbin wrote that the staggering growth in the 
number of aides "has reinforced a situation in which the deliberative aspect of 
representation gets short shrift on all but the broad outlines. . . . The 
process no longer forces members to talk to each other to resolve the tough 
issues." 
</P>
<P>
Deering said members of Congress range "all the way from a member who is pretty 
much staff-driven to members who don't deal with their staffs at all." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'More Direct Involvement 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Norm Dicks (D-Wash.) has seen the process from both sides. Before his 
election to the House in 1976, he served for three years as legislative 
assistant and later administrative assistant to the late Sen. Warren G. 
Magnuson. 
</P>
<P>
In the House, Dicks said, there is "more direct member involvement and 
interest" than in the Senate because the 435 representatives are not spread as 
thinly among the committees as the 100 senators are. 
</P>
<P>
"You hear some grousing in the cloakroom about how we have to go to conferences 
and the senators sometimes don't show up and you've got to deal with the staff 
of the Senate," he said. He added, however, that as a member of the House 
Appropriations Committee he has been "impressed with the level of knowledge 
that the Senate subcommittee chairmen have, and you didn't feel that they were 
being led around by the staff. 
</P>
<P>
"I think, frankly, that the American people get a good return on the investment 
in congressional staff," Dicks said. 
</P>
<P>
So do the members of Congress, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Staff members "can make or break you. If they make mistakes and get you in 
trouble, it can hurt you. On the other hand, if they do a good job, it can do 
you an enormous amount of good. It's a big advantage for the incumbent." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed it is, say critics, and that's the rub. 
</P>
<P>
"If they are helping Congress solve national problems, then it's good," said 
the Heritage Foundation's Liedl. "If they are focusing more on doing activities 
that help their individual congressmen expand and keep power, as in helping 
them get reelected, then it's disturbing." 
</P>
<P>
Dicks is by no means alone as a member of Congress who graduated from being an 
aide to a lawmaker from his state. 
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) worked for the late Sen. Henry M. 
Jackson. Mitchell, the Senate majority leader, worked for Sen. Edmund Muskie of 
Maine. Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-Kan.) worked for Sen. James B. Pearson. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional aides also move on to other jobs in Washington. A check of 58 
biographical sketches of key government officials in the Federal Staff 
Directory for 1988 showed that 10 of them had worked on Capitol Hill. They 
included an assistant attorney general, two assistant secretaries of state, the 
director of an independent agency and members of three full-time commissions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aides Lobbied 
</P>
<P>
Like the senators and representatives they work for, the staff aides get 
lobbied. 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest with you, most of our nuts-and-bolts work is done with the staff 
members," said Jim Magill, legislative director of the Veterans of Foreign 
Wars, who sometimes makes his point with staff members over lunch. He buys. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably the most visible of our work is appearing before the various 
committees and subcommittees where we make our testimony, but that usually is 
the final stage in a very long and drawn-out process of working with the staff 
members and drafting legislation, and also working with the staff members to 
get the member that they work for to offer amendments." 
</P>
<P>
All in all, said Dicks, "The professional staff up here does a great job and 
they don't get paid very well." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pay and Travel 
</P>
<P>
Some might disagree about the pay. 
</P>
<P>
Records of the clerk of the House show that Andersen was paid $50,000 last 
year. Harvey, the Senate Labor Committee counsel, made $52,500. At 24, Michael 
R. Bushman, press secretary to Rep. Terry L. Bruce (D-Ill.), made $29,000. 
</P>
<P>
For some aides, there is a fair amount of travel at the taxpayers' expense. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate's statement of disbursements for the six months that ended Sept. 30 
showed, for example, that Daryl H. Owen, staff director of the Senate Energy 
Committee, ran up $8,860 in expenses on a trip to Moscow, Leningrad and Kiev in 
the Soviet Union; that Joanne N. Paulk, director of interparliamentary services 
in the Secretary of the Senate's office, was paid $3,841 for a trip to London 
and Geneva, and that her assistant, Yvonne L. Hopkins, got $3,611 for travel to 
Vienna, Warsaw, Prague, Czechoslovakia, and Reykjavik, Iceland. 
</P>
<P>
James A. Miller, in his book "Running in Place," about his experiences on the 
staff of former Senate Republican leader Howard H. Baker Jr., said that in 
1982, Baker's chief foreign relations aide, George Cranwell Montgomery, visited 
Panama, Argentina, Chile, Peru and Mexico in January; Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, 
Jordan and Israel in April, and China and Hong Kong in May. 
</P>
<P>
Defenders of Capitol Hill staffs point to Congress' greater responsibilities 
these days, both at home and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"Congress' role has increased dramatically because of the Great Society 
programs . . . our role in the world, what have you," said Deering. "I don't 
think there is any question the size of government itself and government 
responsibilities expanded in the 1960s." 
</P>
<P>
It was a simpler capital when Alice Klopstad arrived that New Year's Day 1934. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in Washington about six months of the year and home about six months," 
she said. "Now, everybody's here all the time."

GARMENT FACTORY A HAVEN FOR BANGLADESHI WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
DHAKA, Bangladesh 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A quiet revolution is starting behind the soft whir of sewing machines: 
Bangladeshi women are finding alternatives to poverty, early marriage and 
frequent childbirth. 
</P>
<P>
In this underfed, overpopulated, disaster-prone nation, the garment industry 
has established itself as a success story both economically and socially. 
</P>
<P>
Nahar was 12 years old when her family arranged her marriage to a pedicab 
puller who, she said, beat her. By 16, she was a deserted wife with an infant 
son. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the only respectable options for a poor village girl like Nahar 
would have been remarriage or becoming a maid. The other possibilities in 
Bangladesh's limited female labor market were husking rice, pounding bricks and 
stones into gravel at construction sites or prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, a few months after Nahar's husband cast her out in 1985, a relative 
offered her a job in the fledgling garment industry. 
</P>
<P>
Today, at 20, Nahar (like many Bangladeshis she uses only her first name) is a 
sewing machine operator at Y. K. Garments on Elephant Road in the center of 
Dhaka. She sends half her monthly salary of 900 takas (about $28) home to her 
mother in the village to take care of her 5-year-old son. Her annual salary of 
$336 is more than double her nation's per capita annual income of $160. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I'm the happiest woman on Earth," she said. "No one beats me anymore 
almost every night. I'm independent and I earn my own money." 
</P>
<P>
Such independence is still rare for most Bangladeshi women, but it is a 
beginning and it is growing. 
</P>
<P>
About 300,000 women work in Bangladesh's clothing factories, making up 90% of 
the industry's work force. The number of export-oriented clothing factories 
swelled from four in 1979 to 722 in 1988, according to government statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Export earnings shot up from $500,000 in 1979 to $450 million in 1988 and now 
bring in 35% of the nation's foreign exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Bangladesh is the fifth-largest exporter of ready-made clothing to the 
United States, after Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan and China, according to the 
U.S. Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
But the garment industry could help in another problem area -- population 
growth -- if more women choose to work and marry later, thereby reducing their 
child-bearing years. 
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is the world's most densely populated land after the city-states of 
Hong Kong and Singapore. If its birth rate is not checked, its population of 
110 million will double within 35 years. According to the United Nations 
Children's Fund, 86% of the population already lives below the poverty level. 
</P>
<P>
Ayesha Khatoon, daughter of a landless peasant in Bangladesh's northern Rangpur 
district, was 11 when she fled to Dhaka in 1984 because her parents planned to 
marry her off to a 16-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not want the marriage," she said. "The job at the garment factory has 
saved my life. Otherwise, I would have ended up either being a maid at a rich 
man's house or, who knows, in a brothel." 
</P>
<P>
Ayesha and three of her co-workers at Meghna Garments Industry Ltd. share a 
one-room, tin-roofed apartment. That in itself is a social breakthrough in a 
country where single women are expected to live with their families. 
</P>
<P>
One of her roommates, 25-year-old Khodeza, said she left her husband two years 
ago because he insisted that they have a fifth child. The first four were 
girls, and he wanted a son. 
</P>
<P>
"One night, I thought and thought. Suddenly, I decided that I can't take it 
anymore. I must leave for a life of my own," Khodeza said. 
</P>
<P>
"The garment women have achieved a great social revolution in our conservative 
Muslim society," said Sufia Kamal, a women's rights activist and a leading 
poet. "They have done what many of us educated women have failed to achieve so 
far. Although the women are taking the jobs out of necessity, they are also 
silently fighting against the social taboos."

DIGGING UP PALMYRA: SYRIA'S TOP TOURIST ATTRACTION IS SLOWLY EMERGING

PALMYRA, Syria 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Archeologists have been excavating this ancient oasis for more than 50 years, 
but it will take 30 more before the full splendor of Palmyra's temples, tombs 
and colonnades is restored. 
</P>
<P>
Lines of weathered columns gleam golden against green date palms. Hundreds more 
lie buried in the sand, along with piles of huge stone blocks dating back 1,800 
years to a time when Palmyra was the center of a kingdom on desert caravan 
routes. 
</P>
<P>
"If we brought in bulldozers, we could clear the site in six months, but we'd 
also destroy much evidence needed to assess the city's role in history," said 
archeologist Khaled Assad, the site director. 
</P>
<P>
"Doing it slowly means another generation of work by Syrian and foreign 
excavators. . . . We'll also be restoring as much of the ancient city as 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
International Effort 
</P>
<P>
Polish, French, West German, East German and Japanese archeologists are digging 
in different areas of Palmyra. 
</P>
<P>
Syria, where human habitation has been traced back 150,000 years, is an 
archeological treasure house of the remnants of countless civilizations that 
have flourished and fallen throughout its history. 
</P>
<P>
About half of ancient Palmyra, about 4 1/2 square miles, has been unearthed. 
</P>
<P>
It's Syria's top tourist attraction, drawing more than 70,000 visitors a year. 
</P>
<P>
Palmyra was important because it was the hub of the network of caravan trails 
that carried silks and spices from eastern Asia across the Roman province of 
Arabia to the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Challenge to Rome 
</P>
<P>
But its rebellious Queen Zenobia challenged Rome's authority. The city was 
plundered in AD 272 after Zenobia was captured during a long siege. 
</P>
<P>
"Palmyra is a unique site . . . a great responsibility, and we have to look 
after it, restoring the architecture, bringing it back to life," said Culture 
Minister Najar Attar. 
</P>
<P>
This year, conservators finished renovating a 3,000-seat amphitheater 
overlooking a colonnaded main avenue where plays, concerts and youth festivals 
will be staged. 
</P>
<P>
A tall, arched portico forms the backdrop, flanked by deep-set doorways and 
pillars made of limestone hauled from local quarries. 
</P>
<P>
"Palymra boasts very lively Roman architecture, and its public buildings are 
superbly planned," said Asif Bahnassi, a recently retired director of 
antiquities who supervised the restoration. 
</P>
<P>
"We've re-erected more than 150 columns as well as many masonry blocks. . . . 
You can feel the sense of spaciousness and grandeur." 
</P>
<P>
When excavations started in the 1930s, the villagers of Palmyra lived in the 
ruins of the huge temple of Bel, the Babylonian equivalent of Zeus, king of the 
Gods in Greek mythology. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Residents Resettled 
</P>
<P>
They were resettled in a town that now has a population of 30,000. 
</P>
<P>
The only modern building among the ruins is the 12-room Hotel Zenobia dating 
from 1918, mentioned in many Middle East travelers' memoirs. 
</P>
<P>
But it's unlikely to be torn down because "it happens to stand in the courtyard 
of a temple to the rain god Belshamin and doesn't overlie anything important," 
Assad said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he said, Syrian archeologists pulled 30 pieces "of really beautiful 
statuary" from an underground tomb dated around AD 98. 
</P>
<P>
In that period, wealthy Palmyrenes buried their relatives in family tombs 
decorated with sculptures and wall paintings of the deceased. 
</P>
<P>
The excavators are still looking for a likeness of Queen Zenobia. 
</P>
<P>
"She doesn't appear in the archeological record although we have a good deal of 
information about her. Her career was recorded in detail by Roman historians," 
Assad said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Remains Were Razed 
</P>
<P>
The site of her palace has been identified, but a later Roman emperor, 
Diocletian, razed its remains and built a military camp there about 30 years 
after the city was captured. 
</P>
<P>
In the 3rd Century, Palmyra won tax breaks from the Romans that helped boost 
its commercial importance. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its markets for luxury goods, the city operated a network of 
caravan hostelries at 15-mile intervals -- equivalent to a day's journey. 
Palmyrene merchants owned ships that sailed in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
But Zenobia provoked imperial anger by asserting the city's independence after 
her Arab husband, Odeinat, died. 
</P>
<P>
"She was very ambitious for her son, Wahballat, but she was also a strong 
personality in her own right," Assad said. 
</P>
<P>
Called "the most beautiful woman in the Orient," she wore Roman purple and 
addressed her troops on horseback like an emperor on campaign. She followed 
political developments in Rome and hired a Greek philosopher, Longinus, as an 
adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Zenobia was seized by the Romans near the Euphrates River, while riding a camel 
to seek help against the Emperor Aurelian's siege of Palmyra. 
</P>
<P>
According to some historians, she was taken to Rome where she married a Roman 
senator and lived in a villa at Tivoli.

MAJOR PROBLEM IN PACIFIC ISLANDS; 
</P>
<P>
'PARADISE' LEARNS TO COPE WITH SUICIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID CLARK SCOTT, Christian Science Monitor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SYDNEY, Australia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Azure waters. Coconut palms. Many people equate the Pacific islands with 
paradise. 
</P>
<P>
But two years ago, suicide was the greatest single cause of death in the 
Marshall Islands. And, although the suicide rate here has since fallen by more 
than 50%, it still is a major problem. 
</P>
<P>
Experts here say they hope the Marshall Islanders' progress may hold lessons 
for other Pacific island nations trying to cope with what some consider an 
epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
Health officials say suicide rates are related to the islands' shift from 
subsistence to cash economies and a breakdown of traditional family structures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Suicide Rates 
</P>
<P>
Suicide rates are highest (or at least best documented) in the Marshall 
Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia and Western Samoa. But in the 1980s 
other islands, such as Fiji and Tonga, have also seen rising suicide rates. 
</P>
<P>
Most victims are male, aged 15 to 24. Most die by hanging or poison. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall Islands' authorities were shocked in 1987 when 21 men and one women 
committed suicide. For a population of 35,000, the figure was staggering. 
</P>
<P>
"In these countries, you've got a suicide rate 10 to 20 times higher than for 
the same age group in the United States or Australia," says Don Rubinstein, 
director of the Micronesia Area Research Center at the University of Guam. 
</P>
<P>
Most suicides are compulsive. A young man argues with his wife or girlfriend, 
gets drunk and kills himself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Poor Coping Mechanisms' 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds crazy; but without the extended family, they have very poor coping 
mechanisms," says Neal Palafox, director of preventive health services. 
Traditionally, when a young man had an argument, an uncle or grandmother living 
with the family would step in and offer counsel or mediate. 
</P>
<P>
But the cash economy is changing family roles and long-established methods of 
solving social conflicts. In the matrilineal subsistence economy, the land 
belonged to the mother. It was the source of income and gave her and her 
relatives authority in the family. When a woman married, the husband moved to 
her land. 
</P>
<P>
Now that most cash jobs are in urban areas, part of the family follows the 
father. "He's the one earning the bread in the family, and the mother's 
authority is diminished. Now he's the one with the authority," says Marie 
Maddison, minister of health services. But she adds, "The fathers aren't ready 
to take on that role." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nationwide Campaign 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a nationwide campaign was mounted. Workshops, seminars, and skits 
were held in schools and the workplace. The turning point came with a 
high-profile endorsement of the program in a nationwide radio broadcast of a 
briefing in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
This year, so far, the suicide rate is about the same as in 1988. The publicity 
campaign has been cut back to a weekly radio broadcast and occasional 
workshops. 
</P>
<P>
"These are stop-gap measures but very important stop-gap measures," says 
Palafox. "It will take years to teach people about coping, to teach people to 
come to counselors, to teach people that the culture is disrupting itself and 
other things need to be institutionalized to take care of what the disruption 
has caused. But in the short term, we have part of the answer in that 
Marshallese are now watching out for Marshallese."

<P>
In small towns in Sicily, where just looking at a man can get a woman labeled 
"loose," Lara Cardella is being called all kinds of names for telling how it is 
to grow up female and Sicilian. 
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old native of Licata, Sicily -- population 45,000 -- is also 
selling a lot of books. 
</P>
<P>
Her novel "Volevo I Pantaloni" -- "I Wanted Pants" -- has been Italy's 
best-selling paperback since early spring. Cardella wrote it at night, longhand 
in a notebook, in her parents' house, and submitted it in an Italian contest 
for young, unpublished writers. 
</P>
<P>
She says she didn't expect to win, let alone get published. She did both. 
</P>
<P>
Arnoldo Mondadori, the Italian publishing giant, has already sold the film 
rights for the book, which at 121 large-type pages is more a novella than a 
novel. 
</P>
<P>
Cardella also didn't expect insulting telephone calls and scornful looks from 
townspeople who felt ridiculed by the book. 
</P>
<P>
When she came out of her house one day with a French TV crew, paramilitary 
police had to protect her from a crowd shouting curses, she recalls. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of my friends stayed by me. Some of them left me," she said in a recent 
telephone interview from her home. "My sister was forced to change schools. Few 
of my parents' friends remain." 
</P>
<P>
The small town in her scathing story could be Licata or hundreds of other 
coastal towns or mountain villages in Sicily. 
</P>
<P>
Telling the story is 16-year-old Annetta. She is not an autobiographical 
character, Cardella says, but embraces the experiences of many of her 
girlfriends whose modest attempts at liberation -- like kissing a boy in public 
-- sometimes ended in beatings or being kept at home under even tighter 
supervision. 
</P>
<P>
Annetta wants to wear pants like men. Or at least be able wear her skirts 
short, like her friend Angelina, who used to live in the more liberal north. 
</P>
<P>
Annetta asks her mother how she can get pants. 
</P>
<P>
"Her reply, innocent, revolutionized my adolescent life," Annetta says. "She 
told me, 'I pantaluna falli purtari e masculi e buttani.' " The Sicilian 
dialect translates: "Men and whores wear pants." 
</P>
<P>
Annetta then sets out to learn how to put on lipstick, sway her hips so boys 
will notice her and lie to her parents so they'll let her go to an afternoon 
party -- at Angelina's house, naturally -- where there are more boys than girls 
and no parents. 
</P>
<P>
At the party she meets a boy named Nicola. The next day an uncle sees Nicola 
kissing Annetta. She is beaten up by her father and renounced by her mother, 
who is so busy weeping from shame that she quits cooking dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Wanting to eat again, her father arranges for Annetta to stay with an uncle, 
even though her parents know the uncle sexually molested her when she was 10 
years old. 
</P>
<P>
"Woman is wife, woman is mother, but she is not a person," Cardella writes. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Licata's residents who protested the book didn't read it, she says. 
</P>
<P>
nd derided one of southern Italy's most sacred rituals, the Sunday afternoon 
passeggiata, or stroll, taken after the day's big meal. 
</P>
<P>
Girls walk hand in hand, around and around the main square. Boys cluster in 
groups and ogle the girls, who have mastered the art of looking chaste and sexy 
at the same time. Older folks sit on the sidelines to make sure that all the 
boys and girls exchange are looks. 
</P>
<P>
After the television show, Cardella told another interviewer that the mayor met 
her on the street and said: "You need to be straightened out." 
</P>
<P>
Cardella regrets blurting out on television that "99%" of Sicilians are 
backward. 
</P>
<P>
"I love Sicily. It's so beautiful, it's stupendous. But the idea that people 
won't denounce violence is wrong. . . . Violence exists. . . . I think it's 
wrong a woman can't go to a disco." 
</P>
<P>
In general, she says, girls are more repressed in the poorer towns and 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"People say I'm impulsive. That I want to change things too quickly. But I 
don't want to wait 100 years. I don't want to know my daughter will have the 
same problems I did."

Blizzards in remote western China have trapped 8,000 gold prospectors for more 
than a month and 36 have died, the official Xinhua News Agency said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Altitude sickness caused the deaths, it said. 
</P>

Helicopters on Friday dropped 8 1/2 tons of food into the Hoh Xil Lake area of 
Qinghai province, more than 16,500 feet above sea level, the report said.

EASTERN COMPANY WANTS TO SEND GARBAGE WEST;

<P>
NEW MEXICO RESIDENTS TRASH PROPOSAL FOR LANDFILL 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like many small New Mexico towns, Lordsburg wants new jobs, tourists and 
growing businesses. 
</P>
<P>
But promoters never dreamed the hottest development deal here in decades would 
involve a Manhattan-size landfill that has thrown the town into the debate over 
the nation's mounting solid waste problem. 
</P>
<P>
Immense, isolated and sparsely populated, the Hidalgo County desert near Mexico 
has been chosen by a Maryland company for the commercial landfill. The dump 
would accommodate up to 20,000 tons of garbage a day from East Coast cities. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was not exactly a secret. A major construction firm, Driggs Corp. 
of Capitol Heights, Md., acting locally as Innovative Environmental Systems of 
New Mexico, had secured property in the area and in January asked the state for 
a landfill permit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Local Outcry 
</P>
<P>
But elected officials and their constituents -- caught off guard when news of 
the proposal surfaced -- sent a shock wave of opposition that has since 
reverberated in every New Mexico town and county as well as the Capitol in 
Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
Clark Smith, mayor of this southwestern New Mexico town of 3,200 people, 
recalls that January morning when he saw a map of his town on the front page of 
a newspaper: 
</P>
<P>
"There's Lordsburg on the map right there, and Driggs, and I looked at my wife 
and said, 'What is this?' My phone started ringing, 'What is this? What is 
this?' " 
</P>
<P>
The 7,300-acre landfill site would sit on 36 square miles now occupied by 
lizards, snakes, mesquite brush and yucca. The property is neatly and 
conveniently bisected by Interstate 10 and the busy Southern Pacific Railroad 
line. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legislation Introduced 
</P>
<P>
The opposition moved fast, turning trash into a major environmental-political 
issue in New Mexico and focusing attention on the state's inadequate landfill 
regulations and the national quest for suitable landfill space. 
</P>
<P>
When the 1989 Legislature convened in mid-January, a bill was introduced to 
toughen the landfill law and block commercial dumps. It received overwhelming 
support. 
</P>
<P>
But the bill was vetoed by Gov. Garrey E. Carruthers, who cited technicalities 
that he said would have forced the immediate closure of every landfill in the 
state. But in March, Carruthers issued a moratorium outlawing all new 
commercial landfills except under special circumstances. The state 
Environmental Improvement Board adopted new regulations two months later. 
</P>
<P>
Hidalgo County, responding to the public demand, also imposed a landfill 
moratorium and initiated its first-ever land-use planning effort. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Need to Protect Ourselves' 
</P>
<P>
"Now that we are aware . . . that they are looking at deserts for landfills, we 
need to protect ourselves," said County Commissioner Maura Rico. 
</P>
<P>
Don Sanchez, Driggs' director of special projects who was the company's local 
representative, and Ralph Golden, executive vice president, refused to be 
interviewed, citing fears of adverse publicity. 
</P>
<P>
However, Innovative Environmental Systems' director, I.M. (Ike) Smalley, who 
retired last year from the state Legislature after 38 years, said Lordsburg 
residents never waited for a full explanation, leading to misconceptions about 
the landfill and its potential benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Lordsburg would reap economic benefits, including up to 150 jobs and a 
$3-million payroll. 
</P>
<P>
Few residents are tempted. 
</P>
<P>
"My first reaction was that no waste disposal operation of this size could 
possibly be a good thing for the community . . . no matter how many jobs it 
creates," said Charlie Hayes, a school administrator and leader of the 
opposition.

PRISON PROVIDES SHOCK FOR N.Y. WOMEN INMATES

<P>
Felicita Rodriguez is ready to start her life over. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a future in front of me," said the 24-year-old resident of New York 
City's lower East Side. "A better future." 
</P>
<P>
That future includes a high school equivalency degree, a job and the chance to 
raise her two young children properly. Rodriguez said it will not include using 
or selling drugs, which is what got her into trouble in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
It also got her into state prison. 
</P>
<P>
"This inmate thinks she can do it," she said. "I know I'm special now." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez and 14 other women this month became the first female platoon to 
complete New York state's shock incarceration program. About 1,400 of the 
state's 40,000 prison inmates are women. 
</P>
<P>
While doing their six months at the shock camp, the women followed an intense 
regime of military drills, manual labor, exercise, remedial education and drug 
and alcohol counseling. They lost weight, gained some self-respect -- and won 
their freedom earlier than they would have in a traditional prison. 
</P>
<P>
They opted into the program, trading a tough six months in an environment very 
much like a Marine boot camp for a shorter prison term. 
</P>
<P>
First-time, nonviolent offenders sentenced to three years or less in prison who 
complete the shock program are immediately eligible for parole. That means they 
can cut up to 2 1/2 years off their minimum prison time. 
</P>
<P>
That is good news for the state, whose prisons are so overcrowded that 
officials recently decided to start housing inmates in prison gymnasiums. And 
it is very good news for inmates who want to go home early. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going home and growing my hair," said Christine Conti, a former cocaine 
dealer, as she stuffed her possessions in a paper bag and prepared for a ride 
home to New Jersey. The women in shock camp do not have to shave their heads as 
closely as the male inmates, but their hair is cut to about collar length. 
</P>
<P>
Conti, 25, said most of the other shock inmates "thought I was crazy" because 
she liked the running and the strenuous exercise that begins every day at 5:30 
a.m. But other aspects of the military life did not sit as well. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst part is the mess hall," she said. "I like to talk when I eat. . . . 
You can't talk. You can't even look." 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Rosetta Burke said the military basis of the shock program teaches the 
inmates responsibility, discipline and respect, traits most had "very little 
grounding" in before. 
</P>
<P>
Conti said drug counseling helped her get over a cocaine addiction. Before 
shock camp, she said, "I wouldn't have told you I was a drug addict. They 
taught me how to open up and deal with my problem." 
</P>
<P>
Other programs taught her she did not "always have to say something about 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
Inmates who do not like the program can transfer back to a regular prison and 
their longer sentences. Troublemakers are sent back. 
</P>
<P>
The platoon of 15 started out with 25 women six months ago, most of them 
convicted of drug charges. One woman owes a month because she was hospitalized 
during her shock term. Another left for medical reasons. Five were kicked out 
because of disciplinary problems. 
</P>
<P>
Inmates like the three who chose to go back to prison "can't take it anymore," 
said Burke. "They don't like getting yelled at. They don't like getting up in 
the morning. They don't like the responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't let them off the hook." 
</P>
<P>
While all of the graduating platoon spoke sincerely of new, brighter futures, 
the odds are that a few of them will get in trouble again. Shock inmates have a 
17% to 19% recidivism rate, Burke said. However, the average prison inmate 
return rate is 25%. 
</P>
<P>
That improvement -- and the millions the state can save through shorter prison 
terms -- has prompted Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to propose raising the current 
26-year age cap for shock camp to 29. The shock programs operated by a growing 
number of states -- Louisiana and Mississippi also have graduated classes of 
women -- have attracted the attention of national drug policy chief William J. 
Bennett, who is interested in it for federal prisons.

LIFE FOR NEPAL'S SHERPAS HIT PEAK WITH HILLARY'S ARRIVAL, GUIDE SAYS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Edmund Hillary reached the summit of Mount Everest 36 years ago, he did 
more than make history, he changed the lives of a people -- the Sherpas. 
</P>
<P>
One of those affected was Pertemba Sherpa, who today runs a trekking company 
and exudes all the confidence and warmth of a man who has climbed the world's 
highest mountain three times. 
</P>
<P>
"Hillary loved the Himalayas and especially the Sherpa people and he came back 
many times after 1953. He opened a school in 1960 and I became one of the first 
to study there," Pertemba said with a broad smile in his Katmandu office. 
</P>
<P>
Until Hillary's school, education was almost nonexistent in the highest regions 
of northeastern Nepal, where Sherpas had migrated from eastern Tibet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High-Altitude Porters 
</P>
<P>
They worked as farmers, herders and tradesmen. Their physical prowess and good 
nature also made them excellent high-altitude porters on mountaineering 
expeditions. 
</P>
<P>
But meeting Hillary -- who is now the New Zealand High Commissioner to India 
and Nepal, based in New Delhi -- and his friends changed Pertemba's life. 
</P>
<P>
"I dreamed of following in their footsteps to the summit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nepal is home to eight of the world's 10 highest mountains. Freezing 
temperatures, threats of avalanche, ice falls, strong winds and high altitudes 
have tested the most experienced climbers. Sherpas are ideally suited for the 
extreme conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Pertemba, who was born in 1949 in the shadow of Everest, worked as a trekking 
and climbing guide before he got his first chance to scale a major peak. He 
joined British mountaineer Chris Bonington on an expedition to Annapurna. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Supported the Team' 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't get to the summit but I supported the team," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1975, after two previous unsuccessful attempts on Everest, he joined 
Bonington as sirdar, or chief Sherpa, and scaled the world's highest peak at 
29,028 feet. But the experience was marred by tragedy when Englishman Mick 
Burke died during the descent. 
</P>
<P>
"It took me a long time to get over it, but I went back to Everest in 1979 with 
a West German expedition and reached the summit again. The weather was good, 
the view was fantastic and I found myself much more relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
He joined Bonington again on a Norwegian expedition to Everest in 1985 and made 
it to the top of the world for the third time. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been very lucky," he said. "I've had enough for now. Maybe I'll still try 
the north side or some other route but reaching the summit isn't the most 
important thing -- it's the enjoyment, the sharing of the experience and the 
building of friendships." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lasting Bonds 
</P>
<P>
The bonds forged during a climbing expedition are lasting, he said. "So many 
things go together -- good weather, good equipment and a good team." 
</P>
<P>
Religion is also an important ingredient. Devout Buddhists, Sherpas pray for 
protection and hold prayer sessions during climbs. 
</P>
<P>
Fate has been kind to Pertemba. During his mountaineering career he has had 
only two close calls, once narrowly escaping an avalanche and a second time 
during a descent in darkness. 
</P>
<P>
Other Sherpas have not been as fortunate. Seven were killed in the first 
attempt on Everest in 1922 and many have died since. 
</P>
<P>
Pertemba's close friend, Sungdare, who holds the world record along with Ang 
Rita for scaling Everest five times, was not as lucky. 
</P>
<P>
"During his first attempt he and two other climbers were forced to spend the 
night outside. The others died but we had a very good rescue team who managed 
to get Sungdare down," Pertemba said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Six Months in Hospital 
</P>
<P>
Sungdare lost four toes to frostbite and spent six months in a hospital, but 
"he hasn't had any problems since going back," Pertemba added. 
</P>
<P>
Mountaineering has changed since Hillary's time. Siege-style expeditions with 
large teams have given way to smaller groups and solo attempts. 
</P>
<P>
The opening of Nepal's borders after World War II also resulted in a booming 
tourist industry and Sherpas can now choose less hazardous occupations. Many 
run guest lodges, tea houses or trekking companies. 
</P>
<P>
The tourist boom has brought about improvements in education, health care and 
the standard of living. Despite the influx of foreigners, Pertemba said, 
Sherpas have guarded their ancient traditions. 
</P>
<P>
"The local culture has become stronger because the changes have given us an 
opportunity to explore our own country. Very few people could travel before." 
</P>
<P>
Bonington has a "profound regard" for Sherpas and has often acknowledged how 
vital they have been to all Everest expeditions. But that's not their most 
important achievement, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The great success of the Sherpas is how well they have adapted to a changing 
society," he said. "They are a resilient and wonderful people."

WOULD PLAYERS, REPORTERS DO BETTER THAN FANS? 
</P>

<P>
By MIKE LITTWIN, The Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As you know, Mike Schmidt (3B, retired) and Jose Canseco (OF, resting) have 
been voted by you, the baseball public, onto their respective All-Star teams. 
</P>
<P>
You could analyze this phenomenon in a number of ways. One, many Americans are 
practical jokers. Two, many Americans are too busy to keep up with the news 
(for them, this public service announcement: Reagan retired; Orioles in first; 
Franco still dead). Three, as Dan Quayle once said, it's a terrible waste to 
lose your mind. 
</P>
<P>
Personally, I think it's much too easy to attack Joe and Jane Fan (or Jane 
Fanda), who could have put, say, Jimmy Hoffa on the team. Certainly, voters 
have erred more grievously in the past. There is a story of the dead man who 
was actually elected to political office, and not just some All-Star team. He 
wasn't retired. He wasn't injured. He was dead. Requiescat in pacem. 
</P>
<P>
Let's try to put ourselves, if gingerly, in the shoes of the honest-to-gosh 
live person who lost that election. He had to face up to the fact that people 
believed he was less competent to lead than someone who no longer remembered 
how to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of breathing, how 'bout them O's, alive and well and breathing fire, 
except for Jeff Ballard. More on that later. 
</P>
<P>
Bowie Kuhn resurrected the concept of fan voting, overruling a strong sentiment 
that he should have introduced simultaneously a literacy test. (Sample 
question: It's one, two, how many strikes you're out in the old ballgame?) But 
Kuhn wanted all fans, literate or otherwise, to vote, thereby increasing 
interest in our national game. And, hey, it worked. I'll bet Pete Rose 
accumulated more votes over the years than Ronald Reagan, and he wasn't hitting 
against Walter Mondale either. 
</P>
<P>
If the fans didn't name the starting lineup, who would? You could go back to 
the players, some of whom can name all the teams in their league. Or you could 
tap the sportswriters, some of whom can name all the teams in their city. Or 
you could go to Tony LaRussa, who picks the pitchers and reserves with the help 
of league President Bobby Brown and was sufficiently adept at the business of 
star-making to leave Ballard off the team. You think the fans could do worse? 
</P>
<P>
But even if you like the concept of fans as voters, you still can't help but 
wonder what the person who punched in Schmidt and-or Canseco might have been 
thinking. It doesn't take a genius to figure out who gets the preponderance of 
votes. Most people who aren't victim to Rotisserie-League fever do not pore 
over the statistics each day, comparing the relative prowess of Felix Fermin 
and Jody Reed. And since the voting starts early in the season anyway, we vote 
for the guys we know have done well in the past. Which is why I'm always a 
little surprised when Hank Aaron doesn't make it. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Schmidt, who retired May 29, he's done a lot of good things in 
the past. The fans must have figured: "I can vote either for Howard Johnson (a 
restaurant, after all) or thegreatest third baseman of all time." 
</P>
<P>
Canseco is a little more puzzling. Last year, he became the first 40-40 man (40 
homers, 40 steals), and this year he's the first 0-2 man (0 at-bats, 2 arrests) 
to make the All-Star team. He did, however, prompt one of my favorite lines of 
the baseball season. After being arrested for driving 140 mph, he told Los 
Angeles Times columnist Scott Ostler that, in his sports car, 140 mph felt like 
going 60. Ostler said that could be quite dangerous, because when the car is 
going 40, Canseco might think it has stopped and try to get out. 
</P>

In any case, unlike Schmidt, who retired for a reason, Canseco wanted to play. 
He planned to take his first major-league swings this year on Sunday and 
figured that would have been enough time to have his injured wrist ready by 
Tuesday. Unfortunately, American League officials determined Canseco maybe 
didn't deserve the position and said he can't play. 
</P>
<P>
You usually need at least two consecutive good seasons to gather enough fan 
recognition to be voted onto the team, leaving one to wonder why there wasn't 
more support for Kevin Costner (brilliant in "Bull Durham" and "Field of 
Dreams"). Maybe they didn't know which league he belonged in. Shoeless Joe 
Jackson ("Field of Dreams" and "Eight Men Out") could, with a hit next year, 
possibly make the squad, if not the Hall of Fame.

THEY MAY BE SCORELESS STARS -- JUST LIKE 1967

What if they gave an All-Star Game and nobody scored? 
</P>
<P>
Don't laugh. It almost happened the last time baseball's best players conducted 
their mid-season convention down the road from Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night's renewal comes 22 years to the day after the All-Stars last 
gathered in Anaheim Stadium for the longest game in the history of the series. 
The Stars struggled 15 innings that afternoon and evening in a game finally 
settled by Tony Perez' home run that gave the National League a 2-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The key here is afternoon and evening. 
</P>
<P>
Because of television's desire to showcase the event in prime time, the 1967 
All-Star Game began at 4:15 p.m., leaving batters squinting through the late 
afternoon California sun against some of the best pitchers in the game. It made 
hitting an adventure and the results were obvious in the box score. 
</P>
<P>
There were a record 30 strikeouts, 17 by AL hitters, 13 by the NL. Ferguson 
Jenkins tied a record with six strikeouts in three innings of work. Gary Peters 
and Catfish Hunter each struck out four hitters, Peters in three innings and 
Hunter in five. 
</P>
<P>
On a day where the offenses were all but invisible, where scoring rallies were 
non-existent, all the runs came on homers. 
</P>
<P>
Rich Allen connected for the NL against Dean Chance in the second inning and 
Brooks Robinson tied it against Jenkins in the sixth. Then the teams played 
scoreless baseball for the next nine innings before Perez settled the issue 
against Hunter in the 15th. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the three home runs, it was largely a three up-three down game. 
There were precious few scoring threats and the game is best remembered for the 
strikeouts, all those strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
The game was less dramatic than it was draining, stretching through 3 hours, 41 
minutes of offensive futility. The setting sun and some talented pitchers 
completely neutralized the game's best hitters. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most frustrated was Roberto Clemente, one of 16 Hall of Famers who 
dotted the two rosters. Clemente would win his fourth batting title that 
season, but you couldn't tell from his performance in the All-Star Game. He 
singled in his first at-bat and then struck out the next four times against 
four different pitchers, setting a record. 
</P>
<P>
"Those late afternoon and early twilight shadows made breaking pitches 
especially tough to follow," he said at the time. "No wonder everybody was 
swinging at the wind." 
</P>
<P>
Not to mention the sun. 
</P>
<P>
And those guys weren't facing all-time strikeout king Nolan Ryan, who, at the 
age of 42, has won a spot on this year's AL staff. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Seaver, who pitched the last inning to get the save for the NL in the 1967 
game, will be in the broadcast booth for NBC Tuesday night. He has a hunch that 
the hitters, swinging again in the California twilight, may be in for a not-so 
instant replay of the kind of frustrations the '67 Stars experienced. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it could be the same kind of game," Seaver said. "I believe you will 
see a number of strikeouts early on." 
</P>
<P>
Seaver was a rookie that year on a veteran pitching staff that included 
Jenkins, Juan Marichal, Bob Gibson and Don Drysdale. That left NL Manager Walt 
Alston with a surplus of Hall of Fame arms and it showed. The AL managed just 
eight hits, three of them by Carl Yastrzemski. The NL didn't do much better, 
getting just nine hits against Chance, Jim McGlothlin, Peters -- who threw 
three perfect innings -- Al Downing and Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
"Possibly, it was over-all the best pitching in any All-Star Game I've seen," 
Alston said. "You'd have a hard time picking the best one." 
</P>
<P>
That game's Hall of Fame contingent was a galaxy of some of baseball's greatest 
stars -- Alston, Yastrzemski, Hunter, Drysdale, Clemente, Gibson, Marichal, 
Brooks Robinson, Frank Robinson, Al Kaline, Mickey Mantle, Harmon Killebrew, 
Hank Aaron, Ernie Banks, Willie Mays and Lou Brock. 
</P>
<P>
But the leading vote getter -- at that time All-Star balloting was done by the 
players, managers and coaches -- was Pittsburgh shortstop Gene Alley, who 
received 250 votes. Perhaps in recognition of his status, Alley was permitted 
to play the whole game. That, however, turned out not to be such a good idea. 
He went 0-for-5. 
</P>
<P>
Alley had plenty of hitless company, though. Killebrew, Orlando Cepeda, and 
Tony Conigliaro were each 0-for-6. Bill Freehan was 0-for-5. Willie Mays, a 
non-starter for the first time since 1956, pinch-hit in the sixth inning, 
stayed in the game and went 0-for-4. Bill Mazeroski was 0-for-4 and Rod Carew 
and Dick McAuliffe were each 0-for-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim game was second in a series of three where All-Star hitting was 
nearly entirely absent. The year before, in St. Louis, the NL won 2-1. The next 
year, in Houston, the score was 1-0. Pitching was king in those days and its 
dominance led to changes in the rules, a lowering of the mound and the eventual 
introduction by the American League of the designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the twilight affected the hitters, baseball has not hesitated to 
play subsequent west coast showcase games at that hour. The last California 
All-Star Game was in 1987 at Oakland, where the two leagues were scoreless for 
12 innings before the NL won 2-0. All five of last year's World Series games in 
Los Angeles and Oakland also had twilight starting times. 
</P>
<P>
Television had the right idea, though. NBC research reported that a record 55 
million people watched the 1967 All-Star Game, the largest audience ever for a 
non-World Series baseball game. The game had a rating of 25.6, representing 
more than one-quarter of the total TV sets in the country, and was viewed on 
23,800,000 of the sets in operation at that time. 
</P>
<P>
Now, 22 years later, with the advent of cable TV and VCR use reducing audiences 
across the board, NBC is estimating an audience of 45 million for Tuesday 
night's game.

DAN GOLDIE IS TENNIS' MR. WARMTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL JACKMAN, The Baltimore Evening Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dan Goldie, the former NCAA tennis champ from Stanford and McLean, Va., is a 
guy who could use some help in the public relations department. 
</P>
<P>
After beating Jimmy Connors at Wimbledon, he sniffed, "It's tough to rank the 
victory one-two-three. You'll have to ask my agent. He keeps track of that 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Warmth, this guy. 
</P>
<P>
"The incident took place on a team bus in mid-August. At issue was whether or 
not Phil Linz should play his harmonica." 
</P>
<P>
Ah, does that bring back memories. 
</P>
<P>
This is the 25th anniversary of the glorious summer of '64 for the Baltimore 
Orioles and, about now, you're asking yourself, what did the Birds do that 
year? 
</P>
<P>
They led the American League on a merry chase nearly all season, that's all. 
"Pennant Fever," the feeling and the record, was a hot item in Baltimore. Yogi 
Berra was managing the New York Yankees, and they seemed doomed as the players 
had trouble relating with Yogi as boss man. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks Robinson of the Orioles was on an MVP kick (.317 with 20 homers and 118 
RBI) and, it appeared, the O's had enough pitching to hold up. 
</P>
<P>
The Yanks had just lost a game on getaway day and, as the bus moved toward the 
airport, Linz hauled out his harmonica. Berra yelped "knock it off" from the 
front of the bus and Linz, preoccupied, didn't hear him. He asked what the 
manager had said. Mickey Mantle answered, "He said, 'Play louder.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Bombers were in turmoil, but they began to play better anyway. In September 
and in need of relief help, they latched on to Pedro Ramos, on his last legs. 
Baltimore manager Hank Bauer groaned that New York would win as it had so many 
times with late-season acquisitions. He was right; the Yanks went 22-6 the last 
month, beating out the Chicago White Sox by a game, the O's by two. But what a 
terrific summer. 
</P>
<P>
A bottle of champagne at Wimbledon goes for $43.20. Which seems a bit steep 
until one considers that strawberries go for 65 cents apiece. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles should post the weights and physical measurements of all hands in a 
prominent place and plead with the lads to maintain their condition. I mean, 
these guys even look as though they can play, unlike so many of their 
pot-bellied brethren. 
</P>
<P>
Heartfelt apologies are due the National Basketball Association. It was assumed 
basketball played the longest season, but this year hockey won by nearly a 
week. The icers went from Oct. 7 to May 28 (234 days) while pro hoops lasted 
229 days. Baseball is third at 203 days, followed by pro football (141), 
college hoops (137) and college football (129). Has indoor soccer sent the boys 
home yet? 
</P>
<P>
Temple's nickname is the Owls, as in "wise, old ... " Maybe a change is in 
order though; next year's basketball team will contain six former Proposition 
48ers. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary and Vancouver have signed a pair of magnificent Soviet hockey players 
in Sergei Makarov and Igor Larianov, but how good will they be not playing 
alongside each other? 
</P>
<P>
Scene from the 1988 Winter Games in Calgary: The Soviets consistently change 
five men at a time on the fly and, during a game against tough Finland, it was 
time for the first string to skate off. Makarov had the puck and rather than 
just flip it down the other end, he decided to see how far he could go 
single-handedly before being stopped. Going one-on-five, he maneuvered to the 
high slot and got such a fine shot on goal, the netminder had to smother it, 
giving the Soviets a faceoff deep in Finland's territory. Bobby Orr used to do 
such things. 
</P>
<P>
The first recorded cricket game in the United States occurred in 1709 in 
Westover, Va. However, the sport has had its problems catching on. 
Nevertheless, players from across the land congregated in Washington over the 
long weekend bidding to make the U.S. team that is headed for international 
competition. The team is expected to be world class in the not-too-distant 
future due to the influx of people from the West Indies, a cricket hotbed. 
</P>
<P>
This honesty-is-the-best-policy business is beginning to catch on. Nebraska, 
checking its archives while preparing for its 100th football season, found it 
was crediting itself with nine too many wins. Let's see if Oklahoma follows 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
Given his druthers, Mike Tyson said he'd rather fight in Atlantic City, N.J., 
than Las Vegas, Nev., because the Convention Hall there provides a "gladiator 
factor. Yeah, the crowd's above you looking down, just like in ancient times." 
</P>
<P>
Tyson has been in A.C. readying for a July 21 date with Carl Williams for a 
week. Truth pulls in Friday.

CRYING 'SHAME!' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Nov. 5, 1984, the San Diego City Council rejected a plan that would have 
modernized the look of Horton Plaza and put in it several undesirable features, 
such as shelters and towers. The council arrived at its decision after many 
tiring and stormy public hearings. At the time there was much talk about how 
preserving the original facade of what was then the Bradley Building, with its 
Italian Renaissance trim, would enhance the historic look of the old plaza. Not 
surprisingly, the Los Angeles Times' San Diego County Edition decided this 
wasn't good enough, and, acting in the time-honored way, it offered to pay for 
an arts ticket center in front of the former Bradley Building (now Glendale 
Federal). 
</P>
<P>
Once again, public input and the intention of restoring the plaza to its early 
19th-Century appearance were discarded. How often has this happened to Horton 
Plaza and to Balboa Park? It is too late to undo the damage that has been done 
to the only public meeting and resting place in downtown San Diego. But it is 
not too late to cry, "SHAME!" 
</P>
<P>
San Diego is a city of rich and poor, with everything for the first. I am sure 
the yuppies who will buy tickets at the new building will care less that it is 
on an extension of a public plaza. It will not even cross their minds that the 
ticket booth should have been put somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
My thoughts go back to the words of Julius Wangenheim, Jan. 10, 1919, to the 
Board of Park Commissioners, on which he had served for many years: 
</P>
<P>
"It is with keen pleasure that I wish to thank you for the very generous 
attitude toward the Liberty Loan in the dedication of the plaza for that 
purpose. It was only the urgent need of the nation in time of crisis that would 
have tempted me to ask you to infringe on the inviolability of the plaza. 
</P>
<P>
"Might I not suggest, now that the war is over, that the plaza be protected 
against any infringement for any other purpose. It is so small, so dainty and 
so centrally located that every inch should be carefully guarded. And might I 
not also suggest that all signs, booths and everything else of this nature on 
the plaza be discontinued."

THE SEED FOR MIGRANT HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was plenty of bad news for San Diego County in Gov. George Deukmejian's 
budget cuts Friday. But one small, yet important, appropriation survived the 
ax: $500,000 in seed money for migrant farm-worker housing. 
</P>
<P>
To receive the money, local government will have to kick in another 25%. And 
housing advocates plan to leverage the money with federal and private 
contributions to produce up to $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
That's still a drop in the bucket, considering that some estimates put the 
homeless migrant population as high as 15,000. 
</P>
<P>
But it's a start. 
</P>
<P>
Now it will be up to local government to get serious about finding sites for 
the housing. Much of the responsibility for coordinating that effort will fall 
on the county, which in the past has used a lack of land as an excuse for not 
pursuing migrant housing. 
</P>
<P>
Finding land will be difficult, politically and financially. But it's not 
impossible, if government and community leaders make it the priority they have 
told the governor it was.

IMPERIAL BEACH NEEDS TO LOOK BEYOND THE BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SERGE DEDINA, Serge Dedina is a lifelong Imperial Beach resident and a 
member of the city's beach area and water-oriented facilities advisory 
committee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The budget crisis in Imperial Beach is temporarily over, and plans to 
disincorporate the city are on hold. City Manager Ron Jack has managed to raise 
revenues and cut Sheriff's Department services to balance the budget. What 
promised to be a fiscal disaster turned into a rather routine budget-cutting 
operation for a city government that has been strapped financially for most of 
the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The recent problems, however, have opened debate on the future of Imperial 
Beach and the development strategy that will allow the city to avoid recurring 
financial crises. 
</P>
<P>
The situation in Imperial Beach is similar to what happens to Third World 
nations that take out loans to finance large development projects that 
international experts assure will lead the countries to salvation. If the 
project is a failure, basic public services are cut to pay off the loans. In 
the case of Imperial Beach, basic public services have been cut so that the 
city can pay off the loan to rebuild its fishing pier. However, unlike the 
Third World, the International Monetary Fund does not bail out small American 
cities for the bad decisions of their elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
City officials in Imperial Beach historically have complained about their 
inability to develop a community surrounded by open space -- while blaming 
environmentalists for stalling development projects -- without realizing that 
what has defined the character of Imperial Beach is its open space. Instead of 
planning a strategy that integrates the natural setting with its small-town 
character, the city, in effect, has attempted to ruin the two factors that make 
Imperial Beach unique among Southern California beach communities. 
</P>
<P>
A comprehensive planning study conducted by the Graduate School of Urban 
Planning at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo concluded that Imperial Beach should not 
concentrate all its development efforts along the beachfront, which it said has 
a limited potential for revenue generation. Instead, the city should 
concentrate on its commercial core along Palm Avenue where there is room for 
enhancement. The study, financed by a grant from the city, has been ignored by 
Imperial Beach officials, who keep insisting that the beachfront development is 
the key to economic revitalization. 
</P>
<P>
There is no indication that officials have learned anything from the recent 
crisis. City officials want the San Diego Unified Port District to assume 
control of the oceanfront tidelands to reduce city costs and to speed 
beachfront development. Mayor Henry Smith envisions an oceanfront marina 
alongside a mile-long ocean platform for hotels and restaurants in an area in 
which some of the largest waves in Southern California break during periods of 
heavy surf. Apparently the loss of almost $1 million during the attempt to 
construct a submerged breakwater along the beachfront has not deterred the 
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
A strategy that concentrates on developing publicly owned areas that are open 
to the forces of nature and protected by state and federal regulations that 
require lengthy environmental review is bound to fail. 
</P>
<P>
The city has neither the resources to pursue projects that end up in court, as 
in the case of the breakwater, nor the foresight to reject those projects when 
they are presented to the council for preliminary review. 
</P>
<P>
However, a strategy that uses the natural setting and community character of 
the city as its focus should be welcomed. With the population of the South Bay 
expected to grow by more than 200,000 residents by the year 2010, the city will 
become a magnet for South Bay residents seeking a well-maintained beachfront 
removed from the congestion encountered in most Southern California beach 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
The picture painted by city officials looks bleak as they assure residents that 
the solution to the financial problems in Imperial Beach is to give away the 
rights to the public resources we have and develop the remaining publicly owned 
open space. 
</P>
<P>
However, it only takes a comparative look at other beach communities in 
Southern California -- congested, overdeveloped and not affordable for most 
people -- to realize that Imperial Beach needs a change of leadership and 
direction, and new priorities.

SAVVY COMPROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The idea of environmental groups accepting a cash settlement from developers in 
return for dropping a lawsuit is an unsettling. one. 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Club has such a lofty reputation that few people question its 
motives or ideals, even when they disagree with its positions. 
</P>
<P>
So it came as quite a shock to many that the Sierra Club and San Diegans for 
Managed Growth were considering a settlement of $500,000 or more from two 
developers whose projects were possibly jeopardized by a lawsuit the groups had 
filed against the city. 
</P>
<P>
The groups said they planned to use the money to set up a foundation, which 
could intervene in future cases to protect sensitive lands and the city's urban 
reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Disclosure of the negotiations brought on a furor of criticism from builders 
and politicians. Mayor Maureen O'Connor accused the environmental groups of 
selling out. Builders, afraid of setting a precedent, pressured the two 
developers to back off from a settlement that would have given 
environmentalists the freedom to decide how the money would be spent. 
</P>
<P>
At issue in the suit is whether the City Council improperly gave the developers 
permission to build on 320 acres in the city's northern tier, land that the 
environmentalists claim cannot be developed without voter approval. The 
environmentalists lost the first round when a judge said the statute of 
limitations had been exceeded, a ruling they are appealing. The developers, 
hoping to speed resolution of the case, offered the groups a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Settling lawsuits out of court is an everyday occurrence in most legal circles. 
Each side weighs the chances of winning and the costs and risks of continuing a 
case. Practicality often prevails over principles. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists and other public-interest groups face the same legal hurdles 
as other litigants. But they wage their battles mostly with volunteers, while 
their adversaries are often financial Goliaths. 
</P>
<P>
So, perhaps even more than other plaintiffs, public-interest groups have to 
temper idealism with realism. They do this when they decide whether to file a 
suit, when they decide how much money and volunteer time to devote to the suit 
and whether to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
It would be unreasonable to expect them to refuse all settlements, which are 
fairly rare and probably should be if public-interest groups want to maintain 
the public's trust. 
</P>
<P>
But, in some cases, settling might provide the funds to allow public-interest 
groups to better succeed with future efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Settling doesn't necessarily mean selling out; it may just be smart strategy. 
And, in San Diego, where most elected officials tend to favor development, 
environmentalists need to be smart.

AQMD TRIES AGAIN TO CUT PLANT'S EMISSIONS 
</P>

The South Coast Air Quality Management District has renewed its efforts to 
require the Commerce refuse-to-energy plant to meet emissions standards, 
attacking the legality of the facility's recently granted variance from 
pollution limits. 
</P>
<P>
The district's Hearing Board on Tuesday is scheduled to consider a petition for 
a new hearing on the variance, which allows the plant to operate in violation 
of AQMD pollution standards until Nov. 1. The variance was granted in April. 
</P>
<P>
"The board made errors of law which render (the decision) improper," AQMD 
lawyer Elliott Sernel wrote in a petition to the Hearing Board. 
</P>
<P>
Hearing Board Chairman B. C. Escobar declined to comment on the allegation 
because the matter is before the independent, quasi-judicial body. The AQMD 
could seek a Superior Court order to overturn a Hearing Board decision. 
</P>
<P>
The Hearing Board also is scheduled to consider a petition for an order of 
abatement, which would empower the AQMD to require the plant to stop emitting 
excessive amounts of pollution. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD staff would like the plant to meet emission standards sooner than is 
likely under the variance, said Robert R. Pease, the district's senior air 
quality engineering manager. The variance requires the plant to meet emissions 
standards by Nov. 1, but the Hearing Board has scheduled an Oct. 25 hearing to 
consider an extension if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to ensure compliance on an expedited schedule," Pease said. 
</P>
<P>
The district could seek to shut down the plant, as a last resort, if it failed 
to meet emissions standards, Pease said. 
</P>
<P>
A plant official said the abatement order was unnecessary because the county 
Sanitation Districts and the city of Commerce, which jointly own and operate 
the plant, are making more than $500,000 in improvements to pollution-control 
equipment under the variance. Those improvements should be completed in 
September, project manager Michael Selna said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're moving extremely fast," Selna said. "We're doing quite a bit better and 
are hopeful that we'll meet the (original emissions) standards." 
</P>
<P>
The plant, the first in the county, fired up in late 1986 and operated under a 
construction permit. The facility is capable of burning up to 420 tons of 
municipal garbage a day in its boiler, which turns water to steam to drive a 
generator. The plant, which sells electricity to Southern California Edison 
Co., produces enough power for 20,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
District Denied Permanent Permit 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD and plant officials have been at odds since January, when the district 
denied a permanent operating permit after citing the facility for exceeding 
limits on nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide emissions on 40 days during a 
two-month period last year. 
</P>
<P>
Emissions of nitrogen oxides exceeded limits of 41 pounds an hour by as much as 
14 pounds. Emissions of sulfur dioxide ran as high as 27.8 pounds an hour, more 
than triple the limit of nine pounds per hour. In addition to volume limits, 
the plant also exceeded concentration limits of 225 parts per million for 
nitrogen oxides. 
</P>
<P>
Under the variance, the plant is permitted to exceed its hourly emissions 
limits a small percentage of the time. 
</P>
<P>
Emissions reports indicate the plant has stayed within the variance limits, but 
it has continued to exceed the original emissions levels, Pease said. 
</P>
<P>
From April 3 through June 11, the plant exceeded the original hourly volume 
limits for sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide four times. It also exceeded 
concentration limits for nitrogen oxides at least nine times during the same 
two-month period. 
</P>
<P>
In its petition for a new hearing, the AQMD attacks the Hearing Board for 
allegedly granting the variance without satisfying accompanying legal 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The state Health and Safety Code allows such variances only under certain 
circumstances. There must be evidence that an owner would be forced to close 
his business or suffer an unreasonable loss of property if required to meet 
emissions standards. 
</P>
<P>
There must also be proof that such a closure would be without a corresponding 
benefit in reduced emissions. Several other findings must be made as well 
before a variance can be granted. 
</P>
<P>
Sernel, the deputy district counsel, could not be reached last week to describe 
specific allegations against the Hearing Board's decision. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD filed the petition for a new hearing on June 2, several days after 
officials from the district met with officials of the California Air Resources 
Board. The state agency has jurisdiction over the local air pollution control 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
The California board reviewed the variance proceedings after receiving letters 
from Assemblywoman Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles) and others in 
opposition to the variance. 
</P>
<P>
In a June 21 report, the California board's staff also criticized members of 
the Hearing Board for allegedly granting the variance without meeting the legal 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The board's staff found, among other things, that Commerce officials had not 
proved the plant would fail financially if the amount of trash burned was cut 
back to reduce emissions. 
</P>
<P>
The state board could move to modify or revoke the variance granted by the 
local Hearing Board. But James J. Morgester, chief of the state board's 
compliance division, said the agency would await the Hearing Board's decision 
on the new hearing.

COLLEGE CUTS CHILDREN'S AFTER-SCHOOL CULTURAL CLASSES

Benita Alvarado, 45, had just finished practicing a Mexican folk dance in one 
of the few remaining classes in Cerritos College's cultural arts program. 
</P>
<P>
She was angry that her granddaughter and other neighborhood children probably 
will not be able to take similar classes during the 1989-90 school year. 
Cerritos College has cut after-school classes for elementary school students 
and others who are too young to attend the community college. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're interested in fighting against drugs and gangs, if they have this 
program, why are they going to stop it?" Alvarado asked in a recent interview. 
"(Youths are) learning something positive." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mother Says Program Important 
</P>
<P>
Another parent, Josefina Pena, said her children would miss the after-school 
program. "It's important for them to learn something of their culture, of their 
roots," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The cultural arts program has been a growing success since it was introduced at 
the start of the 1987-88 school year, according to college officials and 
parents. Last semester, 60 adults attended classes in ethnic dance and music 
and 300 youths participated in the after-school segment of the program, college 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But the after-school classes, which represent about 80% of the program, became 
an unaffordable luxury when the enrollment at Cerritos College grew an 
unexpected 2.5% last year, said Charles S. Tilghman , instructional dean of 
fine arts and communication. The state pays for enrollment growth of up to 1% a 
year, leaving the college to absorb the cost of any larger enrollment 
increases, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The district spent about $150,000 in 1988-89 on the college classes and ethnic 
dance and music classes for youths, Tilghman said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a fairly sizable chunk of money to be spending on a program that can be 
seen as not really a college program," he said. "From the beginning there was 
some uncertainty as to whether we should be doing it at all." 
</P>
<P>
The district expects to spend about $16,700 to provide classes in ethnic dance 
and music for college students in 1989-90, college spokesman Mark Wallace said. 
The college is expected to operate on a $42.9-million balanced budget with a 
$2.5-million reserve in 1989-90, Wallace said. Last year's budget totaled $40.1 
million with a $2.5-million reserve, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The cultural arts program was established in the fall of 1987 with the support 
of community and civic leaders. Its purpose was to promote cultural education 
and awareness, and to attract more minority youths to Cerritos College, 
according to a statement of objectives prepared by Sally Morales, an English 
teacher at the college and one of the organizers. 
</P>
<P>
At first there were mariachi and folkloric dance classes at the community 
college level. Students must be in at least the 11th grade to attend community 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
But the program quickly expanded to include the after-school classes at the 
former Excelsior High School site and at John Glenn and Norwalk high schools of 
the Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District. After-school classes for youths 
also were provided at the Downey Unified School District's Warren High, and at 
Furgeson Elementary of the ABC Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Filipino dance was added last year, and will be continued at the college level, 
Morales said. There were plans, which are now uncertain, to offer Chinese 
dance, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
About 35 Staffers 
</P>
<P>
The three school districts provided the facilities and some support services, 
while Cerritos College planned the program and provided instructors. There were 
about 35 coordinators, instructors and aides at the height of the program, 
Tilghman said. 
</P>
<P>
Eligible students received college credit, Wallace said. Cerritos College 
received state funding for the courses until the school reached its growth cap 
last year, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Morales, one of the program's founders, has started meeting with local city and 
school officials to try to secure funding to maintain the after-school program. 
She also hopes to revive a booster club, which once raised money and bought 
instruments. 
</P>
<P>
The one major effort to raise money for the program was a flop. 
</P>
<P>
A June, 1988, benefit concert featuring several of Mexico's most famous 
mariachi artists failed to generate any money for the cultural arts program. 
The college rented its stadium to concert organizers, who were later 
investigated by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department for alleged misuse 
of funds. Sheriff's investigators found insufficient evidence to take further 
action. 
</P>
<P>
Morales hopes that Norwalk officials will agree to help pay for part of the 
after-school program. The Norwalk City Council several months ago approved 
spending as much as $275,000 to implement an anti-gang program. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very difficult thing in these times of no money because this is always 
considered a frills area, one of the things that has to be cut because the 
academics have to be continued," said Morales, who grew up in Norwalk and now 
lives in Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Take Care of Kids' 
</P>
<P>
"We have to take care of our kids because we're losing them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A Norwalk official said he will meet in the next couple of weeks with Morales 
to discuss the cost of programs and other details. 
</P>
<P>
"The city feels the program is a good program," said Ernie Garcia, Norwalk's 
deputy city manager for community services. "We're waiting for information to 
see what we can do." 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the Downey and Norwalk-La Mirada School districts said funding is 
not available for the after-school program. The director of educational 
services for the ABC district, Helen Fried, said the Board of Education will 
consider whether to fund part of the after-school program later this month.

EPA USES ADS TO FIND EX-WORKERS TO REPORT ON OII USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WARD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When he saw an advertisement inviting his former employees to help the U.S. 
government nail his company for environmental pollution, Bill Donahoe, owner of 
a truck-washing business, was astounded. 
</P>
<P>
"I wondered what country I was living in," Donahoe said. Surely, the United 
States would not solicit anonymous gossip from disgruntled ex-employees, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But there it was, an ad in English in the Los Angeles Times and in Spanish in 
La Opinion that listed 51 companies topped by the headline: "Ever worked here?" 
The ad invited those who had worked for the companies to ask themselves whether 
they had handled hazardous chemicals and waste and whether the waste was taken 
to the Operating Industries Inc. (OII) landfill in Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
"Please call us!" the ad urged. "Your information can help us at this hazardous 
waste site." The ad included a toll-free telephone number and the address of 
the EPA regional office in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ads Not Unusual 
</P>
<P>
Terry Wilson, spokesman for EPA's Western region, said the EPA did nothing more 
than take the sort of action that attorneys routinely take when they place 
classified ads seeking witnesses to their clients' traffic accidents. 
</P>
<P>
All of the information received by the agency will be carefully checked by 
investigators, he said, as part of an effort to put together a civil case 
against companies that shipped hazardous waste to the Monterey Park dump. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA has reached an agreement with more than 100 companies to help pay for 
the initial phases of the toxic cleanup of the OII site by contributing $33 
million in cash and $34 million in work. But no settlement has been reached 
with more than 50 other companies that are believed by the EPA to have shipped 
hazardous waste to the dump before it was closed because of environmental 
problems in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The settlements reached so far are only for the initial stages of the cleanup 
effort. The EPA will seek additional payments to continue the cleanup, which 
could eventually cost $200 million to $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$50,000 Spent 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said the EPA spent $50,000 on the ads, which ran every other day for two 
weeks in The Times and La Opinion. He said the ads were a new tactic, never 
before used by the EPA in any of its regions. 
</P>
<P>
The tactic was used in this case, he said, because the agency needs more 
information about waste shipments to OII. Some of the targeted companies claim 
that their waste was not hazardous, but lack documents to support that claim, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson refused to say how many calls had been elicited but said: "We had a very 
good response -- better than expected." 
</P>
<P>
He said he also "heard from a couple of senior vice presidents who were very 
agitated," about their companies being named in the ad. Wilson said the agency 
had no qualms about listing the companies because they have been identified in 
public records as potentially responsible for cleaning up the OII site. 
</P>
<P>
Donahoe said the EPA ad was an open invitation for anyone with a grievance to 
take revenge. "Every company has probably got an employee who is (mad) at 
them," he said. Besides, he added, "there are a lot of just plain disgruntled 
people out there." 
</P>
<P>
Roy Leach, owner of Leach Oil Co. in Compton, said the EPA used a "very 
low-life tactic," giving his company and others named in the ad a black eye by 
implying that they were in trouble with the EPA for wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, his company, an oil recycler, did no more than send waste to a dump 
that was licensed by government agencies to receive it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Federal Law 
</P>
<P>
"What we took out there, we took legally," Leach said. "It was just waste 
water." 
</P>
<P>
Under federal law, companies that produce hazardous waste are liable for it 
even after they have legally disposed of it. Thus, the EPA is trying to 
identify all of the companies that shipped hazardous waste to the Monterey Park 
dump and force them to share in the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
Donahoe, who owns Vernon Truck Wash, which has 100 employees, said the 
government has asked his company to pay $296,000. Leach said the EPA has 
demanded $500,000 from his small business, which has only six employees. 
</P>
<P>
"They're trying to squeeze blood out of a rock," Leach said. "We don't have it 
to give them." 
</P>
<P>
EPA records show that Leach's company is responsible for 692,000 gallons of 
hazardous waste at OII, ranking it 46th in volume on a list of 182 companies 
that shipped a total of 182 million gallons of hazardous waste to the site. 
</P>
<P>
Leach said his company disposed of a slightly caustic solution of waste water 
condensed from steam created during the process of recycling used motor oil 
into fuel. 
</P>
<P>
EPA records rank Vernon Truck Wash 65th on the list of hazardous waste 
shippers, with 470,000 gallons. Donahoe said his company sent mud and sludge 
washed from trucks. "We have documentation proving that what we disposed of was 
not hazardous waste," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consortium's Efforts 
</P>
<P>
The largest volume -- more than 14 million gallons -- came from Chevron USA, 
which has agreed to participate in a consortium of 60 companies that will 
undertake $34 million worth of monitoring and cleanup work at the OII site 
under EPA supervision. The consortium also will pay $1.9 million cash. 
</P>
<P>
Other companies, including the Times Mirror Co., which owns the Los Angeles 
Times, have agreed to pay cash amounts totaling $31 million. The largest cash 
amounts are $4.9 million from Exxon Corp., $5.7 million from the American 
National Can Co. and $5.9 million from the Atlantic Richfield Co. 
</P>
<P>
A number of companies that have not settled with EPA are major firms, such as 
Continental Airlines and Union Pacific Railroad, but others are quite small. 
Leach said the government should give special consideration to companies that 
face financial ruin if they are forced to share in the cost of cleaning up a 
toxic waste problem that arose through no fault of their own. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got to work with the little guys, instead of stomping us like flies," 
Leach said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Leach and Donahoe said they expect their companies to be sued by EPA over 
the OII cleanup costs. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at EPA said they are working toward legal action against a number of 
companies, but cannot say when a suit might be filed.

OLD SOAP FACTORY BEGINS FALLING TO WRECKING BALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The empty shell of the old Procter &amp; Gamble soap factory met its date with 
the wrecking ball last week. Chunks of concrete, clung together by steel 
reinforcing rods, began falling amid dust and rubble as a wrecking crew went to 
work. Below, Mike Gilliland of Bragg Crane Service makes sure the wrecking ball 
is securely fastened to its cable. The 34-acre property on West 7th Street has 
been sold to the Port of Long Beach and is being cleared for a new shipping 
terminal. 
</P>
<P>
The factory was built in 1930 and opened in 1931. Its first product was 
Flakewhite shortening, followed by Oxydol and Dash soaps. The plant survived 
the Long Beach earthquake in 1933 and steadily expanded its capacity and 
products through the years, reaching its height in the early 1980s when the 
average daily production was 22,000 boxes of synthetic detergents, 13,000 cases 
of bar soap and 14,000 cases of food products. But on June 19, 1987, 
announcement was made that the plant would close, a victim of company economic 
strategy influenced by brand shifts, deregulation and competition from more and 
better manufacturing technologies. Procter &amp; Gamble ceased operations on 
Oct. 2, 1988. Demolition by Diamond Pacific Co. is estimated to take about five 
months.

DEPUTY, MAN HE SHOT IN FACE TELL CONFLICTING TALES IN COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy and the man he shot in the face six years 
ago offered strikingly different versions of their confrontation at the start 
of a personal injury trial last week in Torrance Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
In the civil trial, which is expected to be decided by a jury this week, 
Armando Estrada charges that the county is liable for the May 17, 1983, 
shooting that left him with blurred vision, severe headaches, a stiff neck and 
occasional breathing problems. 
</P>
<P>
Estrada, who was 19 at the time of the shooting, is demanding unspecified 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
The county and Sheriff's Deputy Richard Garcia argue that Estrada caused the 
injuries when he lunged for Garcia's .357 magnum revolver. 
</P>
<P>
A few facts are not contested: 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred at about 1 a.m. as Garcia and his partner were patrolling 
in an unincorporated neighborhood east of Inglewood that is rife with gang 
activity. The Sheriff's Department had just broadcast a report that shots had 
been fired when Garcia saw Estrada and three friends in a sedan on South 
Vermont Avenue. Garcia said he stopped the car, believing that the young men 
might have fired the gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
What happened next is the subject of the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, 31, testified Thursday that he recognized Estrada, whom he had arrested 
less than two months before. The deputy and the teen-ager had scuffled in the 
earlier incident, and Estrada had served 16 days in jail after pleading guilty 
to resisting arrest. 
</P>
<P>
On the night of the shooting, Garcia said, he had his gun drawn as he escorted 
one of Estrada's friends to the curb. He said he returned to the car and asked 
Estrada to get out of the back seat. 
</P>
<P>
Estrada obeyed, but as he touched the ground he pivoted and lunged for the 
deputy's revolver, grabbing his hand that gripped the pistol, Garcia testified. 
He said he reacted by pulling the trigger, although he could not recall if he 
intended to shoot. 
</P>
<P>
"I was scared," Garcia told the jury. "I was surprised that he closed the 
(arm's length) distance that fast on me. . . . I just remember thinking that I 
was about to lose the gun." 
</P>
<P>
Estrada testified Friday that he did not see the deputy clearly and so did not 
recognize him from their previous encounter. He denied that he lunged at 
Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he was turning to comply with Garcia's order to walk toward the 
squad car, when the deputy demanded, "Estrada, do you remember me?" 
</P>
<P>
"I heard a little noise like a firecracker and I saw like a fire," Estrada 
testified. He said he remembered nothing else until days later, when he 
regained consciousness at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The bullet entered his skull under his left eye and traveled downward, lodging 
against the top of his spinal cord. Fragments of the bullet are still lodged in 
his neck, said Estrada, now 25. 
</P>
<P>
Estrada's attorneys, Eric G. Ferrer and Winston K. McKesson, said they will 
present expert witnesses this week who will testify that Garcia did not follow 
Sheriff's Department procedures -- particularly standing at a safe distance 
from a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy County Counsel J. Patrick Joyce said he will argue that, regardless of 
the deputy's tactics, Estrada caused the shooting when he lunged for the gun.

Tim Staats' passport is a commentary on man's capacity for brutality. 
</P>
<P>
He has dodged bullets in Beirut, toured ravaged Palestinian hospital wards and 
taught Soviet doctors how to make lifelike limbs for soldiers returning from 
Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
As one of the nation's foremost experts in the art and craft of fashioning 
artificial limbs, the director of UCLA's school of prosthetics has taken 
American techniques abroad to help the maimed victims of war back on their 
feet, even if some of those feet are synthetic. 
</P>
<P>
"He is regarded by his peers as a man who can do a prosthetic as well as any 
we've got in this country," said Peter Edmunds, a senior consultant to the 
World Rehabilitation Fund in New York. 
</P>
<P>
An amateur sculptor whose figures adorn his hillside home in Northridge, 
Staats, who is married and has one child, has a reputation for making limbs 
with an artist's eye. 
</P>
<P>
So respected is his talent that the fund and the United Nations have dispatched 
him to international trouble spots to assess the ability of war-ravaged nations 
to care for their crippled. It can be a humbling tour. 
</P>
<P>
"In a lot of countries, there is just nothing there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He recalled a "very disturbing week" on the Israeli West Bank, where hospitals 
were filling up with Palestinian children wounded in the Intifada. ' 
</P>
<P>
'It was like being thrown back 50 years. Prosthetics are at a very sad state. 
The patients were uncomfortable and complaining," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Beirut he found the remnants -- twisted equipment and a shattered lathe -- 
of a shop that made artificial limbs. 
</P>
<P>
It was a depressing sight, yet the effervescent, 41-year-old was not depressed. 
Unlike someone who lives by the industry aphorism that holds "life is like a 
prosthesis, it's always chafing somewhere," he appears perpetually smiling. 
</P>
<P>
Born and raised in a suburb of Chicago, he attended the University of Montana. 
To push each other to do better in their physical therapy studies, Staats and 
some friends began a competition that allowed the person who received the best 
grade on a test to require his mates to perform sit-ups and pullups as a 
penalty for mediocrity. 
</P>
<P>
It was an effective tool. Staats' six-foot frame was whipped into shape and he 
graduated in three years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bicycle Accident 
</P>
<P>
But his life was changed in Montana by a bicycling accident that broke his 
back. Staats could no longer do the lifting required of a physical therapist. 
With his career dream shattered, he turned to the relatively obscure field of 
prosthetics, which deals with the replacement of missing body parts, and 
orthotics, the science of making braces. 
</P>
<P>
He applied to UCLA, which had set up the nation's first school of prosthetics 
in 1953 to help Korean and World War II veterans who said they were receiving 
inadequate care. Because of the need for prosthetics caused by the Vietnam War, 
he was accepted in 1968. "They were all over me like a hobo on a ham sandwich," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even today, there are only 1,500 prosthetists in the United States -- one-fifth 
of those are in California -- to serve a population of amputees estimated at 
500,000. Staats said there are 50,000 new amputees each year, many of them 
victims of highway accidents. 
</P>
<P>
At the Prosthetics, Orthotics Education Program at UCLA, Staats learned to make 
artificial limbs, a delicate, sometimes frustrating process that can take a few 
hasty hours or as long as a year. Measurements of the residual limb are taken. 
A model of the limb is made, and heated plastic is pulled over the model and 
allowed to cool. That becomes the socket that goes over the residual limb and 
holds the prosthesis. Once the prosthesis is attached, adjustments make it 
conform to the way the patient moves. 
</P>
<P>
After college, Staats taught and then went to work for United States 
Manufacturing in Pasadena, which makes artificial limb components. He returned 
to UCLA when the retirement of the prosthetic school's director, John Bray, put 
the institution in jeopardy. Because the school was not funded -- and still is 
not -- by the University of California, it survives on federal grants. 
</P>
<P>
With the director gone, no one was writing grant proposals. "They thought they 
might close the program," Staats said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Impulsive Act 
</P>
<P>
In what he describes as a crazy decision, Staats resigned his job and returned 
to UCLA in 1982 to try to resurrect the program. He wrote a grant proposal to 
the U. S. Department of Education and heard nothing for months. 
</P>
<P>
"Things were getting a bit threadbare at home" when word finally came that the 
grant had been approved for three more years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA is a recognized leader in work on artificial legs, especially in creating 
new techniques in limb-making that can be easily taught to prosthetists in a 
classroom or a war zone. 
</P>
<P>
Staats has tutored doctors in Mexico and Spain, and visited Moscow to show how 
leg amputees from the war in Afghanistan can be made to walk without a limp and 
without pain. 
</P>
<P>
"We can make people get up and walk," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you lost a limb and had it cut off above the knee, Tim is the guy you want 
to work on you," said Edmunds, of the World Rehabilitation Fund. "He has an 
incredible kind of a nuts-and-bolts sense. If I've got a tough problem, I'll go 
to Tim. If I want somebody to look at a specific problem in an area, Tim Staats 
is the guy we go to every time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Visited Beirut 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Staats was dispatched to Beirut by the World Rehabilitation Fund. 
Normally exceedingly dangerous for an American, the city was in the control of 
the Israeli army. Nonetheless, tanks rolled in the streets at night, and Staats 
dodged gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
He fled the city on the last flight before the airport was closed, but not 
before completing his tour. It showed that half the prosthetics facilities had 
been destroyed in a city locked in a civil war that daily produced new 
amputees. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to assisting war-torn countries, Staats also aids areas that have 
been struck by natural disaster. He has fabricated limbs for victims of the 
devastating earthquakes that struck Soviet Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
A Hollywood celebrity who requested anonymity recently paid him to make a new 
leg for a visiting Vietnamese film director who was injured while fighting for 
the Viet Cong in the Vietnam War. It took all night and the plastic was still 
cooling when the director arrived for the final fitting. He asked Staats how he 
felt about helping a former enemy. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my contribution toward peace," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
Not all his work is with people in crisis. Staats said he told the producers of 
"Battlestar Galactica," a science-fiction television series, that he was the 
only person in town who could make their four-limbed creatures, named Ovions, 
move realistically. 
</P>
<P>
"You can pay me now or pay me later," Staats said he told them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Call for Help 
</P>
<P>
They went somewhere else, but two weeks before shooting started, he received a 
call for help. After working long hours to get them ready, the creatures were 
destroyed in the first scene. 
</P>
<P>
The business of artificial limbs is a flourishing one. Manufacturers sell 
10,000 feet each month at prices that range up to several thousand dollars for 
a luxuriously crafted foot made of a space shuttle-type composite of woven 
glass and graphite. 
</P>
<P>
Now in favor among female amputees are limbs coated with a new material that 
has the soft, yielding quality of flesh. Freckles can be added to make the limb 
look more lifelike. 
</P>
<P>
Styles in prosthetics "go in and out of fashion every month, it seems," Staats 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone wants their limbs to mimic life. Some look upon their artificial 
limbs as a way to make personal statements. In Staats' lab on a low hill 
overlooking Westwood is a plastic leg covered with pictures of a woman in a 
bathing suit, resembling a World War II-era Betty Grable. 
</P>
<P>
Another limb is adorned with the California Raisins.

FAIR HOUSING COUNCIL SEEKS NEW LEADER, MORE STABILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the fourth time in three years, the Fair Housing Council of the San 
Fernando Valley is looking for an executive director, and some say the ongoing 
turmoil is undermining its efforts to battle housing discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
The council, one of the oldest such civil rights agencies in Southern 
California, fired its executive director in May for incompetence. The council's 
previous director was fired in August, only five months after taking the 
position, for uttering a remark interpreted as anti-Semitic. Before that, the 
position was vacant for nine months after the departure of a director who held 
the position for less than a year. 
</P>
<P>
Partly as a result of the staff turnover, the Fair Housing Congress of Southern 
California, an umbrella organization that distributes city and county grants to 
the six housing councils in Los Angeles County, in August placed the Valley 
council on probation and began monitoring its performance. Marcella Brown, the 
congress's executive director, said the probationary status would continue 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Staff Turnover 
</P>
<P>
Brown said the number of housing discrimination complaints investigated by the 
council has not dropped significantly as a result of the mostly volunteer 
organization's problems, including frequent bookkeeping errors, overly 
ambitious fund-raising goals and rapid staff turnover. 
</P>
<P>
But the number of council investigations resulting in complaints filed with 
state or federal fair housing agencies or in private lawsuits fell from 20 two 
years ago to six last year. Brown said the congress also began to hear from 
clients who said they were unable to get the Valley council to pursue their 
discrimination complaints. 
</P>
<P>
In November, the council hired Juan Solis, an experienced housing coordinator, 
and the investigative activity began to pick up, according to council and 
congress representatives. The number of formal complaints filed rose to 15 
during the fiscal year that ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a tremendous amount of housing discrimination in the Valley," said 
Mary Lee, president of the congress's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complaints Shift 
</P>
<P>
The nature of complaints in the Valley has shifted somewhat from racial 
discrimination and discrimination against children to denial of housing based 
on prospective tenants' religion or national origin, Solis said. He said a 
growing number of Arabic and Latino people are complaining about housing 
denials. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said the housing congress became concerned last year when the Valley 
council's performance began to falter after many years as the most aggressive 
in the city. "The council did go from being one of the top councils in the city 
to not being one of the top councils, and that is why they are on probation," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Holly Azzari, president of the council's board of directors, said she does 
not believe that the apparent revolving door for executive directors has hurt 
the agency's ability to investigate discrimination complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"The reality is that we have gone through three executive directors and it 
doesn't enhance our reputation, but the other reality is that we are doing just 
fine," Azzari said. "While there may have been problems last year, there aren't 
any now and we are feeling very positively." 
</P>
<P>
The councils find and train volunteers to serve as undercover checkers, who 
attempt to buy or rent housing from sellers or landlords suspected of 
discrimination. In recent years, the councils have investigated a variety of 
other tenant-landlord disputes, a responsibility that some believe is 
stretching their resources too thin. The San Fernando Valley council covers an 
area from Glendale and Burbank on the east to the Ventura County line. Its 
territory stretches north to Palmdale and includes the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Lee said the San Fernando Valley council continues to meet the terms of its 
contract with the congress. The council's outreach efforts and its handling of 
complaints have satisfied contract minimums. 
</P>
<P>
But, she said, the congress's board of directors feared that the Valley 
council's performance was declining. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why we're monitoring so closely," she said. "Our staff is going to make 
sure they aren't so low that they can't" satisfy their contract terms. "We 
don't want to run that risk. We want the community to be able to get the 
service it needs." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Private Sources 
</P>
<P>
The congress this year will provide about $110,000 to the Valley council from 
contracts it has with the city and county. The Valley council will need to 
raise about $20,000 from private sources. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Sohm, the congress's assistant director, said that in the past the Valley 
council has set unrealistic fund-raising goals and then fallen short. Last 
year, the council wrote a budget that required raising nearly $80,000 from 
outside sources. 
</P>
<P>
When former executive director Richard L. Levin was fired in May, Azzari said 
he had been an ineffective fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
Brown and Lee at the housing congress said the vacancy is particularly 
inopportune. They said the congress is negotiating a new contract with the city 
of Los Angeles to cover the 1989-90 fiscal year. Although a budget and a 
contract for the San Fernando Valley council have been submitted, they have not 
been approved by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
If the City Council requests additional information from the Valley council, it 
will be difficult to supply it, which may hold up approval of grants for the 
entire city, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, "the best thing for them would be to get good staff up and running," 
Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas A. Nowlin III, a council director who heads the search committee for a 
new executive director, said the present problems are forcing board members to 
function as day-to-day managers. 
</P>
<P>
He said finding the right person to fill the job, which pays between $27,000 
and $33,000 a year, is critical. 
</P>
<P>
"It's critical because with an efficient, proficient executive director, the 
board can be about the business of identifying the priorities for combatting 
discrimination in housing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Search Committee 
</P>
<P>
The search committee has written a job description more specific than those in 
the past, placed ads and begun reviewing applications, he said. A selection is 
expected by September. 
</P>
<P>
The executive director manages the council's office, administers its programs 
and contracts, and acts as its chief fund-raiser, Azzari said. Although Solis 
has been effective as a housing coordinator, Azzari said, he has never 
expressed interest in the executive director's job. 
</P>
<P>
She said the council's dismal record in hiring competent leadership is a 
coincidence that she cannot explain. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been involved in the selection of each of the three, and I've been 
pleased with each of them," she said. "And then some unexpected large 
deficiency appeared. We obviously have not done a good enough job in our 
screening or we would not have made these mistakes."

D.A. SIFTS EVIDENCE IN POISON-PEN CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They called themselves Rocky and Bullwinkle. 
</P>
<P>
They are accused of a crime that is more the stuff of tabloids than of Saturday 
morning cartoons: a mass mailing of extortion letters threatening the lives of 
265 Antelope Valley political leaders, professionals and business people. 
</P>
<P>
Before their arrests in Las Vegas last Thanksgiving, former Rockwell aerospace 
technicians Richard Faroni and Roman (Moose) Makuch inhabited a nocturnal and 
obsessive shadow world of weapons, movies, science fiction, law enforcement, 
computers and surveillance technology, according to court testimony. 
</P>
<P>
With pretrial motions set to begin this month, prosecutors and investigators 
are still trying to separate fact from fantasy in the two men's lives. "We have 
many, many hours of work left to do, " said Stephen L. Cooley, head prosecutor 
in the Antelope Valley office of the Los Angeles County district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Widespread alarm in Lancaster and Palmdale has faded since Thanksgiving, when 
the arrests of Makuch and Faroni brought a media invasion to the high desert 
that included "Unsolved Mysteries" and other national television programs with 
a taste for bizarre criminal fare. 
</P>
<P>
But seven months later, prosecutors continue slogging through documents in 
search of hard evidence that Faroni, a slightly built 26-year-old, and Makuch, 
a hulking 27-year-old, are guilty of conspiracy to commit extortion, attempted 
extortion and mailing threatening letters. They each face a maximum of eight 
years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors must still show a motive behind the strange plot to demand money 
from prominent Antelope Valley residents with death threats. Other questions 
remain: How did the conspirators plan to collect, if at all? 
</P>
<P>
And the suspects have out-of-town alibis for the period when the letters were 
mailed, so who else was involved? 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney William A. Clark, one of the few Antelope Valley lawyers who 
did not receive an extortion letter, said Faroni and Makuch will be absolved at 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence they have is very tenuous," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
He is defending Faroni, while Van Nuys attorney Carl Burkow is defending 
Makuch. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks good going in, but when you get down to it, there's nothing that 
links these guys to the crime," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
Cooley described the evidence as eclectic and "rather unusual." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the difficulty is that Makuch and Faroni allegedly crafted a plot to 
fulfill their frequently expressed interest in committing the perfect crime, 
Cooley said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no bit of evidence that is conclusive or telling in itself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But there is a fabric, a pattern when you combine the evidence as a whole, 
that points toward their guilt." 
</P>
<P>
The letters mailed in early November went to hotel and restaurant owners, 
attorneys, doctors, realtors and public figures such as former Lancaster Mayor 
Louis Bozigian, Lancaster businessman and present state Republican Party 
Chairman Frank Visco and former Lancaster City Manager James Gilley. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Childishly Malevolent 
</P>
<P>
The letters were crude, strewn with expletives, childishly malevolent. They 
demanded that amounts generally ranging from $200,000 to $600,000 be sent to 
various names and addresses. Some letters instructed victims to gather their 
cash along with cash to be received from others, purchase walkie-talkies and 
drive repeatedly to Las Vegas until contacted. 
</P>
<P>
The letters threatened victims and their families with death by hideous means, 
claiming that the authors had poisoned former Lancaster Mayor Nick Maluccio, 
who died of a heart attack in a Palmdale restaurant in June, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"The police cannot protect you every minute of every month, day and year," the 
letters said. "But we'll stay after you FOREVER. . . . We are experts in 
poison. We can put toxic chemicels (sic) in your toothpaste or glue laced with 
poison cyanide on envelopes and stamps that you lick." 
</P>
<P>
The letters were postmarked at the nearby Kern County town of Mojave and 
alluded to personal details about the victims, including their children and 
cars, which indicated that they were being watched. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Cathrin L. De Voe, for example, was addressed as "Miss Cat," a 
nickname she had not used since teaching exercise classes several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I had my moments of paranoia for a while," she said. "At least half of the 
victims were extremely fearful. The other half took it to be a ludicrous joke." 
</P>
<P>
Some of those who took it seriously hired bodyguards, bought guns and left the 
area temporarily. Several victims became ill from the shock, said Cooley, who 
believes that personal information was gleaned from newspapers and other public 
documents as well as actual surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Task Force Formed 
</P>
<P>
With consternation mounting among the prominent people of the Antelope Valley, 
the Sheriff's Department put together a task force of detectives to 
investigate. They moved fast. 
</P>
<P>
A caller on the We Tip hot line reported that Lancaster residents Makuch and 
Faroni had bragged about sending the letters. The pair had left town sometime 
in early November, but when they applied for Nevada driver's licenses in Las 
Vegas, detectives were able to track them down by computer records. They were 
arrested Nov. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Among the possessions seized in Lancaster and Las Vegas were two walkie-talkies 
of the type described in the letters, papers with the names of several victims, 
books on electronic surveillance, computer printouts with lists of cars and a 
9-millimeter pistol belonging to Makuch, who acquaintances said always carried 
a gun. 
</P>
<P>
At a lengthy pretrial hearing in March, Cooley conceded that he did not have a 
"smoking computer," physical evidence linking the two suspects directly to the 
crime. He even conceded that he believed an alibi presented in defense 
testimony by Faroni's father -- that Faroni and Makuch were visiting Faroni's 
family in Connecticut during the days before and after the mailings. 
</P>
<P>
But Cooley called the alibi, along with the suspects' abrupt move to Las Vegas 
upon their return from Connecticut, suspiciously coincidental. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the normal way people leave town," he said. "These guys were up to 
something. . . . A couple of guys left under strange circumstances who have 
been bragging about surveillance and end up in Las Vegas where all the money is 
supposed to go with all the equipment they are supposed to have to communicate 
with the victims." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Numerous Lists 
</P>
<P>
Prosecution witnesses included neighbors, co-workers, friends and classmates of 
the suspects. They testified that Makuch and Faroni compiled numerous lists: 
names and addresses of co-workers at Rockwell, possible fund-raising sources 
for the Antelope Valley Film Commission on which they served and local 
attorneys. A bail bondsman with whom the two men hoped to go into business 
testified that he had told them about obtaining information through real estate 
records and other public records. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Mock, who worked with Makuch and Faroni as a technician on the B-1 
bomber project at Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale, testified that the three 
often concocted fantastic scenarios for the "perfect crime" during coffee 
breaks on the night shift. Faroni and Makuch were laid off by Rockwell about 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Other witnesses testified that the two bragged about their expertise with 
high-tech eavesdropping equipment and clandestine surveillance that they were 
conducting. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony showed that they had contact with at least one victim, a Palmdale 
realtor whose son played on a Little League baseball team that Makuch helped 
coach. At a college photography class, the two befriended the son of a 
prominent produce merchant who later received an extortion letter. 
</P>
<P>
And an editor of a local newspaper testified that his comparison of the writing 
style and grammatical patterns of the extortion letters and a short story 
written by Makuch suggested that they had been written by the same person. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys objected strenuously. 
</P>
<P>
"That short story analysis isn't going to float," Clark said. "They are going 
to need someone with more credentials at trial." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Portrait Emerges 
</P>
<P>
Clark acknowledged that a portrait emerges of the inseparable Makuch and Faroni 
as secretive, nocturnal, military veterans with a penchant for discussing 
schemes such as becoming private investigators, taking elaborate revenge on 
nosy neighbors and raising money to establish an Antelope Valley film studio. 
</P>
<P>
"They are rather odd characters," he said. "They live in a fanciful world." 
</P>
<P>
But that is no crime, he said. The prosecution "is going to have to come up 
with an explanation as to why they would do it and how they would get the 
money. All the money's going around in a great big circle." 
</P>
<P>
Clark said there are innocent explanations for apparently suspicious 
circumstances. For example, he said, the defendants had a list of local 
attorneys because they planned to go into business as process servers. They 
went to Las Vegas because they had been laid off for almost a year and were 
looking for jobs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most significantly, Clark said, he has yet to see anyone offer a convincing 
motive for the plot. 
</P>
<P>
Cooley said he will expand on arguments that Faroni, Makuch and several of 
their acquaintances resented prominent area residents. For example, he said, 
because of their membership in the Antelope Valley Film Commission, they knew 
of the frustration of its director, Stephanie Abrahamson, who testified that 
she had been stymied in efforts to get financial support to attract movie 
companies to Lancaster and Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confuse Authorities 
</P>
<P>
Such resentment was part of a "variety of motives" that are "not necessarily 
clear-headed and logical," Cooley said. He said he believes that there were 15 
to 20 actual targets of the plot and that the rest of the victims were included 
only to confuse authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Clark said the prosecution must supply the "missing link" of who mailed the 
letters and how the conspirators intended to collect the money. 
</P>
<P>
Cooley said he believes that the arrests came as Makuch and Faroni were 
preparing the next phase of the plot, in which they would have chosen a smaller 
number of victims and given further payment instructions. He said investigators 
still hope to find the accomplice or accomplices. 
</P>
<P>
Former Mayor Bozigian is among the victims who say they believe that a longtime 
resident or residents with longstanding grudges aided the criminals.

BOY, 7, IN GOOD CONDITION AFTER FALLING INTO POOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 7-year-old boy who was discovered unconscious on the bottom of a swimming 
pool was in good condition Saturday at Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles, a 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Abdullahim Muhammed, who is from Nigeria, was last seen by his parents Ibrahim 
and Amina about 2:30 p.m. Friday at their home in the 11600 block of Burbank 
Boulevard in North Hollywood, Los Angeles police said. He was discovered at the 
bottom of a nearby apartment house pool by registered nurse John Silkey just 
before 3:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Silkey resuscitated the boy and called paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
The boy's parents did not report their son missing until 9:30 p.m., after their 
own search was unsuccessful.

HERMOSA CRACKS DOWN ON LIQUOR STORES, NIGHTCLUBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to a rising number of citizen complaints about "excessive noise and 
unruly behavior," Hermosa Beach police and firefighters soon will start an 
aggressive campaign aimed at curbing violations of local and state laws at 
liquor stores and nightclubs, Public Safety Director Steve Wisniewski has 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the warning and notification phase now," said Wisniewski, who serves 
as the chief of both the Police and Fire departments. "But in the very near 
future, we will turn up the heat whenever it's necessary to gain compliance." 
</P>
<P>
Letters are being sent to bars, restaurants and other establishments warning 
owners to observe limits on occupancy and noise, he said, and liquor store 
operators are being advised to check the ID of any customer who looks even 
remotely like a minor. 
</P>
<P>
Officers will be armed with noise meters when they check out entertainment 
spots, Wisniewski said. He advised owners to close windows and doors when a 
band is playing and to maintain screens over windows to prevent patrons from 
passing drinks to friends outside. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Underage Stings 
</P>
<P>
A couple of months ago, Wisniewski said, police worked for a week with Explorer 
Scouts and other youths, who attempted to buy alcoholic beverages at bars and 
liquor stores. When the underage "customers" made a purchase, he said, the 
owners were cited. When they were turned down, Wisniewski sent the owner a 
letter of commendation. 
</P>
<P>
That operation netted 17 citations for selling liquor to minors, he said. He 
said fines have ranged from $300 to $1,500 for the violations that have been 
processed so far. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, the Lighthouse Cafe was closed down for several hours one night 
in the last week of June for exceeding its legal occupancy limit, the chief 
said, and officers ordered P. J. Brett's on the Pacific Coast Highway to reduce 
its seating capacity. Under the fire code, the limit for P. J. Brett's is 186 
patrons, he said, but officers counted 238 stools and chairs. 
</P>
<P>
The managers at both P. J. Brett's and the Lighthouse Cafe declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More to Come 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be doing a lot of this type of enforcement," Wisniewski said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Roger Creighton said a joint meeting of the City Council and the 
Planning Commission several months ago provided the impetus for the current 
crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to send a clear message that Hermosa Beach residents will no longer 
tolerate excessive noise and unruly behavior at these places," he said. "The 
problem starts when overcrowding is allowed, which leads to customers and noise 
spilling into the streets."

WILMINGTON CARGO HANDLING FIRM FINED $3,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Wilmington cargo container terminal has agreed to pay federal fines totaling 
$3,000, part of that in connection with the death of an employee who was 
crushed when a 4,000-pound container fell on him. 
</P>
<P>
The April 28 accident at Martin Container Services, killed Adrian Jacinto, 21, 
of Long Beach and injured his brother, Francisco, 24, of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
John Hermanson, area director for the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration, said that the federal safety agency initially cited Martin for 
four serious safety violations and four lesser violations. After discussions 
with company officials, the agency dropped one of the serious violations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Connected With Death 
</P>
<P>
Two of the citations were connected with the accident: the firm was penalized 
$900 because the fatally injured employee had worked under a suspended 
container and $600 for leaving a container handling machine unattended without 
lowering the lifting device. 
</P>
<P>
A serious violation is one that can cause bodily injury and that the employer 
knew about or should have known about. 
</P>
<P>
Though the firm will pay the fines, Martin President Nick Martin said that both 
Jacintos were violating the company's written safety policy when the accident 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"The man who drove the machine was not an authorized operator and had never 
driven the machine before and got on the machine without knowing how to operate 
it and never locked the container to the lifting mechanism," Martin said, 
referring to the surviving brother. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First in 14 Years 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first accident we have had in 14 years in business." 
</P>
<P>
The largest fine against the firm, which is on East Lomita Boulevard, was 
$1,200 for failure to complete translation of its hazardous materials training 
program into Spanish, which had been the basis of a citation issued in March. 
Martin said the translation has since been completed. 
</P>
<P>
The company also was fined $300 because safety inspectors who went to the yard 
following the accident found that oxygen and acetylene tanks were stored too 
close together and did not have the proper protective caps.

RESEDA GOES QUIETLY AFTER DAY IN THE SUN; 
</P>
<P>
WOODLAND HILLS WEST AWAKENS WITH 6-RUN OUTBURST TO END 14-INNING LEGION GAME, 
14-8 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It dulled the senses of even the die-hard fans, it dulled the pencils of 
statisticians and it darned near lulled Woodland Hills West reserve Gregg 
Sheren into a deep sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Sheren was reclining comfortably on the bench in the top of the 14th inning 
Saturday when he was rudely awakened by Coach Gary Gibson. At the time, Sheren 
was lying on his back, hands behind his head, cap over his eyes. Thirty seconds 
later, Sheren was inserted as a pinch-runner, his first action in what would 
eventually be 5 hours, 50 minutes of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"And I told him not to fall asleep," Gibson said. "When he ran out there, one 
of the umps asked if I was sure (Sheren) even knew where he was." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe he was and maybe he wasn't, but moments later, Sheren scored the first 
run of a six-run outburst that led Woodland Hills West to a 14-8 win over 
Reseda in an American Legion District 20 Western Division game at Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
With three regular-season games remaining, West (16-3) clinched the divisional 
title, its second in as many seasons under Gibson. Woodland Hills East is in 
second place at 10-6 and has six games left but has twice lost to West. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the title-clincher had mercifully ended -- the marathon included 
the final 1 2/3 innings of a game suspended June 14 and now officially a 5-3 
West victory -- fans were grumbling and umpires were mumbling. 
</P>
<P>
Sheren, of course, was slumbering. 
</P>
<P>
"That's basically it," he said. "I'm not used to sitting on the bench. After 15 
innings or whatever of not playing, it lulled me to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
West, trailing, 8-6, rallied in the ninth to force extra innings. Greg 
Lederman, who started in the outfield in place of Sheren, drove home both runs 
in the inning with a looping two-out, bases-loaded double. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the one bright spot on offense," Gibson said. "He came through for us 
in the clutch a couple of times." 
</P>
<P>
Lederman, batting ninth, finished three for five and had five runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
While Lederman was bailing out West with his bat, left-hander Ryan McGuire was 
holding Reseda (10-7) at bay. McGuire, who pitched a scoreless 1 2/3 innings to 
close out the suspended game and earn his first win of the season, blanked 
Reseda over the final eight innings of the regularly scheduled game for his 
second victory in six hours. In 9 2/3 innings Saturday, McGuire allowed five 
hits, struck out 12 and walked three. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire's last pitching appearance was against Reseda, on June 14. So when 
called upon, like Sheren, McGuire wasn't exactly running on empty. 
</P>
<P>
"Last time against Reseda, I pulled a muscle or something in my back," said 
McGuire, who will be a senior at El Camino Real High in the fall. "I hadn't 
thrown since then, so I was rested." 
</P>
<P>
West starter Lance Gibson didn't fare as well. Two wins shy of 20 in his 
three-year Legion career, Gibson was given a 5-2 lead entering the bottom of 
the fifth but couldn't hold on. Likewise, Reseda starter Tony Holiday was his 
own worst enemy, walking five and hitting three in 8 1/3 innings. Holiday also 
failed to advance seven runners in his first three plate appearances, twice 
hitting into inning-ending ground-outs. 
</P>
<P>
"Both of those guys are better pitchers than that," said Reseda Coach Frank 
DesEnfants, who sat in the stands for most of the fateful 14th. "But in 
general, we did OK, we held our own against them with a bunch of kids who 
aren't exactly household names." 
</P>
<P>
One name that was more than a little familiar to the Gibsons was almost enough 
to win it for Reseda. Outfielder Tom Gibson, no relation, was four for five 
with a double, home run and four RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
In the battle of (pitcher) Gibson vs. (hitter) Gibson, the edge clearly went to 
the latter, according to (coach) Gibson, father of (pitcher) Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a big kid who swings a pretty good bat, that's for sure," Gary Gibson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
There were others, given the length of the game, who rolled up some good 
numbers, too. For West, Del Marine had four hits, including two doubles; Jason 
Cohen (one home run), Bobby Kim (two doubles) and Carl McFadden each had three 
hits. Joey Tushnet had three hits for Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
Other events of note included McGuire drawing a walk five times in nine plate 
appearances, West stranding 22 baserunners and one preteen fan -- who returned 
to the game after a lengthy absence -- asking his mom with a straight face: "Is 
this a doubleheader or what?" 
</P>
<P>
"It was a brutal, brutal game," Gary Gibson said. "It's hard to believe these 
are two playoff teams."

TIES THAT BIND;

<P>
KUCHIKI FAMILY PAYS PRICE IN TIME AND MONEY WHILE DAUGHTERS CHASE DREAM OF 
SKATING IN OLYMPICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Sashi Kuchiki, the Olympic dream began in a dim, long-forgotten ice rink in 
Japan, a rink illuminated by a single light. 
</P>
<P>
Three decades later, Kuchiki is still pursuing that dream on ice, sometimes 
seven days a week, on well-lit, well-kept rinks all over Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Not longer himself, though. At 51, his Olympic hopes are long gone. 
</P>
<P>
Now he skates for his daughters, Tamara, 14, and Natasha, 12. Both of the 
Canoga Park girls are rising stars in the skating universe. 
</P>
<P>
Natasha, teamed with Richard Alexander, finished second in junior pairs in the 
nationals held earlier this year in Baltimore. That followed first-place 
finishes in both the Southwest Pacific and Pacific Coast regionals. She also 
finished first at the Southwest level and third in the Pacific Coast 
competition in junior singles, enabling her to skate in the nationals in that 
category as well. 
</P>
<P>
Natasha finished last in Baltimore in singles, however. "Trying to do both," 
she said, "was just too much." 
</P>
<P>
Her sister was senior ladies champion in the Southwest competition. Tamara came 
in fifth in the Pacific Coast regionals, leaving her as a spectator at the 
nationals where she served as an alternate. 
</P>
<P>
Both have big summers ahead, however. Tamara will be going to Oklahoma later 
this month to skate in the U. S. Olympic Festival. Natasha is going to Sun 
Valley, Ida., to take part in a pairs seminar with a squad from the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
None of this comes cheaply. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Sashi and his wife Denise. Both spend their working hours giving skating 
lessons to support their daughters' $35,000-a-year habit. 
</P>
<P>
"We live, sleep and breathe skating," Denise said. "It's our life. My husband 
hasn't been on a vacation since 1981. We are self-employed and the lessons are 
our income. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's worth it. It keeps Tamara and Natasha out of trouble. Skating is a 
healthy activity. And it has given them the chance to travel and see things 
they wouldn't otherwise see." 
</P>
<P>
For the Kuchikis, the family ties are practically never broken. 
</P>
<P>
On a typical day, all four can be found at the Pickwick Ice Arena in Burbank, 
Sashi in one corner giving a lesson, Denise in another corner doing the same, 
while the girls work with their own coach, Wendy Olson. 
</P>
<P>
Hectic? 
</P>
<P>
Read on. 
</P>
<P>
Because Natasha is training in both singles and pairs, and, because her 
partner, Todd Sand, and her coach, John Nicks, live in Orange County, Denise 
spends much of her time skating around traffic on the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The family schedule goes as follows: Up at 6 a.m. . . . Leave the house at 6:30 
. . . On the ice at Pickwick at 7:15 . . . At 9, Denise and Natasha leave for a 
rink in Costa Mesa where Sand and Nicks are waiting . . . At 1, the Kuchikis 
are again on the freeway for the long haul back home to the Valley for school. 
</P>
<P>
But things are getting better, the Kuchikis have cut their girls' skating back 
to six days a week. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the incredible demands of their sport, both girls have left public 
school and are learning via correspondence courses. 
</P>
<P>
They are not even allowed to use the family pool too often because of concern 
by their parents that utilizing the muscles called upon for swimming could 
affect their skating. 
</P>
<P>
Tough life? Both girls sometimes think so. 
</P>
<P>
"I sometimes feel I'd like to have a regular life," Tamara said, "going to 
school, getting other friends." 
</P>
<P>
When the girls get down, it's pep-talk time. 
</P>
<P>
That's Denise's department. 
</P>
<P>
"They ask themselves, is it worth it?" their mother said. " We just ask them, 
what are the goals you are aiming for?" 
</P>
<P>
Both girls say they always come back to the conclusion that the potential 
prizes are worth the price. They love the travel opportunities skating brings 
them and the presents their parents offer as carrots on a stick, payable upon 
victory in whatever competition they are facing. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody gets lazy," Denise said. "Everybody needs to be pushed, no matter 
how great a skater they might be. They need to be reminded what can be 
accomplished. You need to keep their confidence and their willpower going." 
</P>
<P>
When Denise isn't giving her daughters pep talks or a ride to the rink, 
occasionally simultaneously, she's busy recording music or working on dresses 
for their routines. 
</P>
<P>
The parents do everything but coach the kids. So why not take that additional 
step and save a little money? 
</P>
<P>
"It's better to have someone else coach them," Denise explained. "Kids tend to 
tune their parents out. This way, they get more accomplished. They are always 
trying to please their coaches."' 
</P>
<P>
Not that Sashi and Denise just sit silently on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to satisfy us because we are also coaches," Denise said. "While 
other parents may be happy about what their kids have done, we are not as happy 
as maybe we should be because we know more technically. We may be too critical. 
We praise them, but we don't leave the corrections out either." 
</P>
<P>
Both Denise and her husband say they had no skating goals for their daughters 
when the kids first put on skates, each at about 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
"Putting them on the ice was a good way to sort of baby-sit them at the time," 
Denise said, "while we were busy skating. Then, things just kind of happened. 
We put them in competition and they won. We put them in more competition and 
they won again. Then, they wanted to get better. It just took off." 
</P>
<P>
While the girls seemed destined for the ice, that was certainly not the case 
for their father. A native of Japan, Sashi's sport was baseball. He was a 
catcher until injuring his shoulder in his teens. 
</P>
<P>
Desiring to remain physically active, he turned to skating at 17, a strange 
choice for an athlete who had specialized in a position not noted for its 
finesse. 
</P>
<P>
Sashi found other obstacles barring him from the ice. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me skating was a high-society sport," he said. "It was for the rich. 
My family was not rich. I said, nonsense. I was going to prove to them I could 
succeed." 
</P>
<P>
And he did. 
</P>
<P>
Despite poor coaching, poor lighting and rented skates, Sashi eventually made 
it all the way to the Olympic Games after winning a national championship in 
Japan in junior competition. 
</P>
<P>
While Sashi hovers over his kids, he never wanted his family to watch him 
skate. 
</P>
<P>
"I was too shy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So he told them to stay away. His family (including two brothers and two 
sisters) would ignore his request and sneak in to watch him. 
</P>
<P>
For a long time, Sashi never knew that. He would compete and then bring his 
trophy home. How did you do? members of his family would ask. 
</P>
<P>
Here, he would answer, meekly showing the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
His family would feign surprise, hiding the fact they'd watched him win it. 
</P>
<P>
Sashi never actually skated in the Olympics. He came to the 1960 Winter Games 
in Squaw Valley, Calif., as an alternate. But he liked what he saw well enough 
to stay, settling in Sacramento and, eventually, the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
He became a professional skater, joining the Ice Capades where he stayed for 19 
years. It was with that production that he met his Canadian-born wife, Denise, 
who performed in the Ice Capades for 14 years after winning a gold medal in 
dance in the first Canadian Winter Games, held in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
The only Games the pair thinks about now are those their daughters might be in. 
But what if it never happens? What if the girls were to decide they preferred a 
life off the ice? 
</P>
<P>
"I would be sad," Denise said. "Especially after all the money we've put out. 
All the sacrifices. They have a lot of talent. " 
</P>
<P>
Sashi offered similar feelings. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know what would happen when they started skating," he said, "but 
we're in too deep now. We can't go back. 
</P>
<P>
"For them to reach the Olympics would be a dream. But it's their dream now."

MINTEY TRAVELS WIRE TO WIRE FOR SAUGUS WIN

<P>
Pat Mintey Jr. of Quartz Hill is not even listed among the top 15 drivers in 
the Saugus Speedway Sportsman division points standings. 
</P>
<P>
Ostensibly, he'd be listed 16th, but the track's program includes only the top 
15 in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
But Mintey, a track rookie, was at the top of the list of competitors at the 
beginning and end of Saturday night's 40-lap Sportsman division main event 
before a crowd of 3,486. 
</P>
<P>
Mintey led from pole to checkered flag to claim his second main-event win of 
the season in a crash-free race that featured only one change in position among 
the top four drivers. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew (Will) Harper was back there the whole time. He always is," Mintey 
said. "He's a clean driver; he only bumped me once. But I knew that I had what 
it takes to beat him." 
</P>
<P>
Harper, of Tarzana, the division's points leader, and Dave Phipps of Simi 
Valley, the two-time defending track champion, finished second and third, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Spangler of Northridge, who started third ahead of Phipps, finished 
fourth after Phipps moved ahead of him on Lap 6. 
</P>
<P>
The evening also proved to be a memorable one for Eric Foster of North 
Hollywood, who won his first Street Stock division oval main event of his 
four-year career and his second consecutive main event after posting a figure 8 
win two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"This one is very special," Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
Especially considering the disappointment the 29-year-old has suffered. 
</P>
<P>
In the 25-lap oval main event on June 24, Foster held the lead with three laps 
to go and was ready to claim his first oval win. But a flat front tire forced 
him to pull out and he finished at the back of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Foster's blue and white Chevelle sustained a broken clutch during 
qualification, making it necessary for Foster's wife Jennifer to speed through 
town in search of a clutch plate minutes before the start of the main event. 
</P>
<P>
"I went 80 m.p.h. down Soledad Canyon Road, going in and out of traffic," she 
said. "I went into an auto parts store and said, 'Please help us!' " 
</P>
<P>
She returned with the part just in time for her husband to make a quick repair 
and hit the track. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't get to set it or anything," Foster said. "We just put it in and took 
off." 
</P>
<P>
Foster took off past pole sitter Sue Pittinato of West Hills on the opening lap 
and breezed unmolested to the checkered flag. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Marlewski of Simi Valley finished a distant second with Craig Rayburn of 
Simi Valley third and Pittinato fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Andrews of Redlands won his third of four Mini Stock main events this 
season, passing Tim Mitchell of La Crescenta on the 19th lap of the 25-lap 
race. 
</P>
<P>
In other races, John Lindley Jr. of Newhall won the 12-lap Street Stock oval 
semi-main event to lead four drivers who advanced to the main event. Greg 
Benner of Whittier, Arnold Fagan of Palmdale and Dale Petty of Agoura also 
advanced. 
</P>
<P>
Eight-lap Sportsman heat race winners included Larry Krieger of Reseda, Keith 
Spangler of Northridge and Arlyn Olson of Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
Eight-lap Street Stock oval heat race winners included Lindley, Pittinato and 
Rayburn. 
</P>
<P>
Russ Beckers of Sepulveda won the eight-lap Street Stock figure 8 heat race 
ahead of Steve Nickolai of Simi Valley and Rayburn. 
</P>
<P>
Eight-lap Mini Stock heat race winners included Mitchell and Pat Dennison of 
Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Trophy dash winners included John Watkinson III of Canyon Country (Sportsman), 
Rip Michaels of Arleta (Street Stock oval) and Nickolai (Street Stock figure 
8).

Keith Smith figured that he had been paying the price for 10 years, so he 
didn't think it was too much to ask that he get paid on time. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 27, joined his teammates on the Vancouver Canadians -- the Chicago White 
Sox triple-A affiliate -- in boycotting Thursday night's Pacific Coast League 
game in Albuquerque because the White Sox were repeatedly late delivering 
players' paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
"Four out of the last six checks have been late," Smith said by phone from 
Albuquerque on Friday. "It causes a lot of problems, especially for the guys, 
like me, who are married. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife and daughter live in Denver and there are bills that have to be paid. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew it wasn't a little thing we did, but as far as I'm concerned we did 
the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, a shortstop, signed with the New York Yankees in 1979 after being 
drafted in the 15th round out of Canyon High. He spent a total of 35 days in 
the major leagues with the Yankees during the 1984 and '85 seasons, played two 
seasons in the Milwaukee Brewers organization and joined the White Sox as a 
free agent before this season. 
</P>
<P>
Players are supposed to be paid on the first and 15th day of the month. Smith 
said that Canadians players often have had to wait as long as four days for 
their paychecks to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
"The longest delay I've ever had (receiving a paycheck) with other 
organizations was a day or two," said Smith, who is batting .240 with one home 
run and 14 runs batted in. "It's irritating if it's any longer." 
</P>
<P>
Canadians players had not received their checks Thursday. They met before 
batting practice Thursday and voted not to play the game, which was a 
promotional night in Albuquerque that featured Bob Feller. 
</P>
<P>
"We went into the locker room yesterday and there were a lot of upset people," 
Smith said. "We decided we were going to have a vote and the first thing we 
decided was that we would stick together as a team." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Canadians' general manager flew to Phoenix and delivered 
players' paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said he hopes the issue is settled so that the players can get back to 
concentrating on baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"I have Ozzie Guillen playing in front of me making $800,000, so there's not 
much I can do except continue to play hard," Smith said. "When you're at this 
level and playing every day, you've got a chance." 
</P>
<P>
The long road: Steve Wapnick's pitching career hit a major roadblock earlier 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
Wapnick, a 23-year old right-handed reliever who played at Monroe High and 
Moorpark College, was scheduled to make his first start of the season Tuesday 
for the Dunedin (Fla.) Blue Jays, Toronto's affiliate in the Class-A Florida 
State League. 
</P>
<P>
However, what began as a normal two-hour commute from Dunedin to Osceola for 
the game against the Houston Astros' affiliate turned into a nightmare; the bus 
carrying the Dunedin players got ensnared in a Fourth of July traffic jam that 
resulted in a three-hour standstill. 
</P>
<P>
"Once I found out I was starting, I kind of dwelled on it," said Wapnick, who 
was selected by Toronto in the 30th round of the 1987 draft out of Fresno 
State. "The longer I waited on the bus the more I thought about it." 
</P>
<P>
The bus driver finally traversed through motorists who had taken to playing 
football on the highway, then drove across the grass-and-gravel center divider 
and began a circuitous journey to the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Dunedin arrived five minutes before the scheduled game time so the start was 
delayed 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Wapnick, who was 4-0 with a 2.05 earned-run average and seven saves in 24 
appearances, finally was able to relax once he took the mound. He was pulled 
with a 2-1 lead after striking out the side in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I was only going to go five so I felt OK," Wapnick said. 
</P>
<P>
He felt even better immediately after he entered the dugout when the coaching 
staff informed him that he was being promoted to Knoxville in the double-A 
Southern League. 
</P>
<P>
"It started out as a rough day," Wapnick said, "but I guess it was worth it." 
</P>
<P>
Starting over: After making a school-record 38 appearances at USC last season, 
primarily as a reliever, Darrin Beer is off to a sparkling start in his 
professional career. 
</P>
<P>
Beer, 21, is pitching for the Geneva (N. Y.) Cubs, the Chicago Cubs' affiliate 
in the Class-A New York-Penn League, and is 2-0 with a 1.74 ERA. Beer, a 
right-hander from La Crescenta, has struck out 17 and allowed just one walk in 
20 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"He knows how to pitch and he doesn't give into the hitters," said Ken 
Reynolds, Geneva's pitching coach. "He can throw his breaking pitch over any 
time he wants to. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a polished college player coming out of a good program. He isn't fazed 
too much." 
</P>
<P>
Beer signed with the Cubs as a free agent after going 3-3 with a 5.48 ERA last 
season for the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
He began the season at Geneva in a relief role but moved into the starting 
rotation after pitching impressively in the second game of a doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing I liked about (relief pitching) was it gave me a chance to get in a 
lot of games," said Beer, who had been a starter at College of the Canyons and 
for his first two seasons at USC. "But starting is what I like best." 
</P>
<P>
Orel advice: Travis Willis says he might have turned his season around, thanks 
to Orel Hershiser. 
</P>
<P>
Willis, the Chicago Cubs' eighth-round draft pick out of Cal, has pitched well 
but received no decisions in his past two outings for Geneva after beginning 
the season 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just doing horrible and thinking, 'Shoot, can I make it here?' " said 
Willis, a 20-year-old right-hander who played at Camarillo High. "Then I 
started reading Orel Hershiser's book. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned the main thing is to take things pitch by pitch instead of game 
by game. I've been doing that and it's helped." 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Willis got off to a 6-0 start for Cal before he injured his finger 
while wrestling with his father. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just screwing around the night before a game against Arizona," Willis 
said. "We always play a little rough." 
</P>
<P>
Willis finished his junior season 7-5 and with a 3.33 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I'm getting back to where I was before I messed up my finger," 
said Willis, who makes his next start Monday against the Auburn Astros. "It's 
just a matter of concentration."

EX-HUD OFFICIAL'S LINKS TO CHARITY LAUNCHED PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the night of April 22, 1988, about 50 people attended a $1,000-a-plate 
dinner at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Denver to raise money for an obscure 
charity called Food for Africa. 
</P>
<P>
One of the speakers was Thomas T. Demery, whose position as federal housing 
commissioner at the Department of Housing and Urban Development gave him sway 
over millions of dollars in HUD grants and subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
Developers and their consultants knew full well that Food for Africa was 
Demery's favorite charity. 
</P>
<P>
A former director of Food for Africa, he had introduced the charity's South 
African founder to friends and associates and invited him to a Washington 
political dinner in 1987 where he met Maureen Reagan, the President's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
So it was no surprise that the audience that night at the Hyatt was dominated 
by people seeking HUD funds or that the dinner itself was organized and paid 
for by a former agency official involved in at least 20 HUD-related housing 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
An investigation by HUD's inspector general later found that $290,544 in 
contributions to the charity over 2 1/2 years -- 50% of all the money it raised 
-- came from individuals and firms involved in programs administered by Demery. 
</P>
<P>
The HUD inquiry, however, established no direct connection between 
contributions to the charity and the awarding of HUD grants. And Demery, in a 
90-minute interview Friday, denied that a link existed and hotly disputed the 
way the inspector general calculated HUD-related contributions to the charity. 
</P>
<P>
"The discharge of my duties wasn't linked to anyone who contributed," said 
Demery, who left HUD with the change of administrations in January. "The facts 
are that I didn't know who contributed to Food for Africa and it didn't help 
them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sparked Inquiry 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the 700-page HUD report on Demery, the charity and a HUD program 
for rehabilitating low-income housing sparked a congressional investigation 
that has uncovered evidence of widespread mismanagement and political 
favoritism within the agency during the Ronald Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The scandal has mushroomed far beyond Demery and a single housing program to 
raise questions about former HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr., his executive 
assistant, Deborah Gore Dean, and a host of HUD programs. 
</P>
<P>
Dean and her allies have blamed Demery. Demery, now a real estate investment 
adviser with Boston Partners in Washington, has hired a high-powered public 
relations firm, Hill &amp; Knowlton, to help absolve him of responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like 'Let's Make a Deal' over at HUD," said Stuart E. Weisberg, staff 
director of the House Government Operations subcommittee on employment and 
housing, which is leading the inquiry. "The question is who was the big deal 
maker? Behind door No. 1 you've got Debbie Dean. Door No. 2 is Sam Pierce. And 
door No. 3 is Tom Demery." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lying Going On' 
</P>
<P>
Pierce has said little. In his only appearance so far, he told the employment 
and housing subcommittee on May 25 that he was not a "hands on" manager during 
his eight years at the agency's helm. After his appearance, he told reporters 
cryptically, "I think there is lying going on." 
</P>
<P>
He has been so secretive that he has refused to provide congressional 
investigators with a telephone number where he can be reached. 
</P>
<P>
But he is willing to call them, and they have asked him to testify again, 
perhaps as soon as this month, about charges by a former HUD official that he 
ordered her to approve a HUD project in Durham, N.C., pushed by a longtime 
Pierce friend and a Republican political strategist. 
</P>
<P>
Considerable attention has focused on Dean, the 34-year-old daughter of a 
prominent Republican family. She served as Pierce's chief aide until the Senate 
refused to confirm her for an assistant secretary's post and she left the 
department to become a housing consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Dean declined to testify before the subcommittee, citing her Fifth Amendment 
rights. She also declined to be interviewed for this article. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Played Major Role 
</P>
<P>
But other testimony and press accounts have portrayed her as the leader of what 
some former HUD executives call a "brat pack" of high-ranking officials in 
their 20s and early 30s. She played a major role in running the $5-billion 
housing operation, according to ex-HUD officials, during the two years when the 
federal housing commissioner's job was vacant before Demery filled it in 
October, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Demery was a former commercial real estate broker in Birmingham, Mich., an 
affluent suburb of Detroit. He had been working as a HUD consultant since 1982, 
when he set his sights on winning the post of federal housing commissioner, a 
political appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Demery said that he had not been active politically before, but raised money in 
1984 for Reagan's reelection campaign and began pressing political contacts to 
put his name in for nomination to the HUD post. 
</P>
<P>
In early 1986, he offered to host a fund-raiser for George Bush in Michigan but 
was turned down. Later that year, he raised funds for the aborted presidential 
campaigns of religious broadcaster Pat Robertson and Jack Kemp, who now heads 
HUD. 
</P>
<P>
When Demery arrived at HUD in late 1986, he quickly ran into conflicts with 
Dean and some of her colleagues. "Tom was at war with Debbie almost from the 
start," said a former HUD official who considers himself a friend of both. 
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Demery, 39, said that he considered himself a housing expert 
and believed that Dean and many others at HUD were inexperienced. Some, he 
said, were philosophically opposed to providing good housing for the poor and 
near-poor. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not run with the brat pack," said Demery, who is described by friends as 
very religious. "I had no desire at all to be even an ex-officio member." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rebuffed by Pierce, Dean 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that he tried three times to fire or transfer his deputy, R. 
Hunter Cushing, who was a Dean ally and former member of Pierce's executive 
staff. Each time, he said, he was rebuffed by Dean and Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
Internal HUD documents show that Demery raised questions about Cushing's 
performance and loyalty as early as Nov. 14, 1986. In a memo to Pierce, he 
said: "When I call him on the hot line to come to my office, he will usually 
call Deborah first to find out what it is I could want." 
</P>
<P>
A source close to Cushing said only that "Mr. Cushing was loyal to the 
secretary and felt that Mr. Demery was acting contrary to the secretary's 
wishes and pursuing his own agenda." Cushing is expected to testify soon before 
Congress and, as a Dean ally, to lay blame on Demery. 
</P>
<P>
The failure to remove Cushing undercut Demery's standing with the remainder of 
his staff, according to former department insiders. In the mind of Demery and 
others, it also sowed the seeds that led to the inspector general's voluminous 
report on Demery, Food for Africa and HUD's moderate rehabilitation program for 
low-income housing, known as "mod rehab." 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't drop a dime on me," said Demery, using the colloquialism for 
squealing on someone. "They dropped a bag of dimes." 
</P>
<P>
The origins of the inspector general's investigation of the mod rehab program 
have not been made public, but in May, 1988, the office initiated an extensive 
inquiry that focused on searching for a connection between contributions to 
Food for Africa and the awarding of HUD grants. 
</P>
<P>
Mod rehab originally was one of three major programs within HUD that offered 
incentives for developers to rehabilitate or build housing for low-income and 
moderate-income families, the handicapped and the elderly. The generous 
incentives included mortgage guarantees, grants, loans, tax credits and rent 
subsidies that easily could top $50 million per project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Competing for Fewer Dollars 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan Administration eliminated the programs for new construction and 
substantial rehabilitation and slashed funds for mod rehab. That increased the 
competition among developers for the remaining supply of money. 
</P>
<P>
The HUD report and interviews with ex-officials found that developers turned to 
two sorts of consultants in their pursuit of mod rehab funds: Republicans with 
political connections and ex-HUD officials with close ties to the department. 
</P>
<P>
The going rate for consultants was $1,000 a unit. A consultant who helped land 
a grant for a 300-unit project could get a $300,000 consulting fee. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who received money for arranging grants under mod rehab were former 
Interior Secretary James G. Watt, who shared in a $300,000 fee for making a few 
telephone calls to set up meetings for a developer with Pierce. Joseph Strauss, 
a former HUD official, got $1.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Receives Tax Credits 
</P>
<P>
Philip D. Winn, current ambassador to Switzerland and a former Colorado 
Republican Party chairman, was part of a loose group of ex-HUD officials whose 
projects received $29 million in tax credits alone from the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
Strauss acknowledged in congressional testimony that he hired Watt for one 
project because of his influence. Strauss also contributed $15,000 to Food for 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Winn gave $6,000 to the charity, and one of his business associates, Joseph M. 
Queenan, contributed $35,000 and organized the fund-raiser at the Denver Hyatt 
in April, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The Denver fund-raiser was timed to coincide with a trip by Demery to the area 
on HUD business and it was one of eight events across the country he attended 
while a HUD official, according to the HUD report. Each event was organized by 
individuals or firms doing business with HUD. 
</P>
<P>
At the Denver dinner, Demery gave a short talk about Food for Africa and about 
a trip he made to Mozambique at his own expense in 1986 to view the charity's 
efforts to distribute food to starving people. He also introduced Peter 
Pretorious, the South African who founded the organization. 
</P>
<P>
"Demery said it was his favorite charity," recalled Barbara MacRavey Richards, 
an official in HUD's Denver regional office, who had been told to attend the 
event by a superior because it would look bad if the tables were not full. 
</P>
<P>
The turnout was still disappointing, and Queenan, the organizer and former head 
of housing in the Denver office, wound up contributing $35,000 to make the 
evening a success, according to records and his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
E. Lawrence Barcella, a Washington attorney representing Queenan, said that his 
client had met Pretorious a year earlier and organized the dinner because he 
had "come to believe in the charity." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HUD Connection Denied 
</P>
<P>
Barcella said that Queenan basically had promised Pretorious that the event 
would raise a specific amount of money. But the lawyer said that the dinner was 
not connected with Queenan's extensive HUD business. 
</P>
<P>
"Queenan certainly didn't believe there was any causal relationship between the 
contribution and getting favorable consideration from Tom Demery," said 
Barcella, who added that Queenan is expected to testify before Congress in the 
coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The HUD inspector general's office found no direct connection between 
contributions to the charity and HUD grants. 
</P>
<P>
While the report was being completed, the office recommended to Pierce in late 
1988 that Demery be removed from making decisions on mod rehab grants because 
of questions about the charity and a perception of widespread favoritism in the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Demery, in a reply to Pierce, defended the integrity of the mod rehab program 
and said that no one had received favorable treatment at HUD as a result of 
contributions to Food for Africa. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shift to Other Matters 
</P>
<P>
Although the HUD report kicked off the congressional inquiry in May, the 
employment and housing subcommittee has put the issue aside to deal with hotter 
matters raised in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), chairman of the subcommittee, said that he does 
not believe laws were violated in connection with the charity. But he said the 
contributors were trying to ingratiate themselves with Demery. 
</P>
<P>
"If you had a pattern like this, it is clear that you want to curry favor with 
the individual whose favorite charity that is," Lantos said. "Eyebrows can be 
raised, but not much else."

The Bush Administration, frustrated by new "deal-breaker" restrictions on 
Israel's Palestinian election proposal, may consider abandoning the Israeli 
initiative in favor of an Arab-backed plan for an international peace 
conference, according to a senior State Department official. 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, the official told reporters aboard Secretary of State James 
A. Baker III's aircraft that arrived early Saturday in this Persian Gulf 
sultanate, the Administration will continue to base its Middle East diplomacy 
on Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's plan for elections in the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip. But, the official said, Washington's patience is running out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prospects for Conference 
</P>
<P>
"If things totally bog down, if you can't make progress with this election's 
proposal, then we would have to look a little bit more closely at the prospect 
of an international conference," the official, a top policy maker, said. 
"There's an awful lot of support (for a conference) out there from other 
countries." 
</P>
<P>
Just a week or so ago, Administration officials were prepared to wait for 
months, if necessary, for Shamir's election initiative to bear fruit. They said 
privately that they would be satisfied if preliminary talks about the details 
of the balloting began before the end of this year, with the actual election 
even farther into the future. 
</P>
<P>
But that was before Shamir agreed to new conditions demanded by the right wing 
of his own Likud Party. Although the restrictions were not very different from 
Shamir's own long-held position, the impact of the action at this time on the 
peace process was devastating. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the kind of things that fall under the heading of 'deal-breakers,' " 
said the official, who spoke on the understanding he would not be named. 
</P>
<P>
The official quickly added that Israel's Arab adversaries have taken a 
similarly hard-line stance that also makes progress toward compromise far less 
likely. Moreover, the terrorist attack on a Tel Aviv-to-Jerusalem bus last week 
is certain to harden positions on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Shamir's new conditions the official said, "This is the equivalent 
of the Arabs saying, 'Before we'll talk about elections, we want the Israelis 
out of the occupied territories. . . .' We had requested both sides to refrain 
from doing that. Both sides have done it." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the official's even-handed distribution of blame to Israelis and Arabs 
for the current stalemate, the Arabs stand to gain at Israel's expense from 
Washington's growing impatience. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all Arab parties, including the Palestine Liberation Organization, 
advocate an international conference, to be attended by the parties to the 
dispute plus the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, to hammer 
out a solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. Shamir is firmly opposed to such a 
conference, arguing the other participants would gang up on Israel and pressure 
it to yield at least some of the territory it seized during the 1967 Middle 
East War. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. Cool to the Idea 
</P>
<P>
The United States has been cool to the international conference idea, although 
former Secretary of State George P. Shultz reluctantly embraced it as part of 
his abortive Middle East peace initiative last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration maintains that a "properly structured conference at the 
right time" might advance the cause of peace, but the President made the Shamir 
plan the cornerstone of his Middle East diplomacy from the moment the Israeli 
prime minister unveiled it during a visit to Washington earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has argued that the Shamir plan is the most promising 
initiative currently available and, therefore, should be given every 
opportunity to succeed. Baker and other Administration officials have tried, 
without much success, to persuade the Soviet Union, Western European countries, 
the PLO and such moderate states as Egypt and Jordan to give the Shamir plan a 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Odds Getting Longer 
</P>
<P>
The senior official said that Washington will not change that course for the 
time being. But he conceded that the odds against it have lengthened 
considerably. 
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to try work with the (Shamir) proposal because we always 
thought it offered us the possibility of getting the parties into 
negotiations," the official said. "But it will depend on whether progress can 
be made. There's no doubt that this makes it harder to make progress. 
</P>
<P>
"If we get stalemated and we can't make progress, then maybe we have to say, 
OK, we tried the elections proposal and it didn't work, and we'll look for 
other formulas," he said. "But we're not at that point." 
</P>
<P>
The official's comments went far beyond the Administration's guarded public 
reactions to Shamir's speech to a Likud Party meeting last week. For the 
record, officials are insisting that the action represents only a party 
position, not a change in policy by the Israeli government, a coalition in 
which Likud is joined by several junior partners, including the more liberal 
Labor Party. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Actions of Party Only 
</P>
<P>
Baker told a press conference in Brunei on Friday that the new restrictions 
were "the actions of a political party; they were not the actions of a 
government." Baker said only that the Likud resolution was "not helpful." 
</P>
<P>
But the official who spoke to reporters during Baker's flight from Brunei to 
Oman left little doubt that Washington believes the damage is far more 
extensive than it cares to admit in public. 
</P>
<P>
Baker discussed the Middle East situation Saturday with the defense and foreign 
ministers of Oman, a tiny but strategically located sultanate that controls the 
south side of the Strait of Hormuz, the choke-point at the entrance to the 
Persian Gulf. However, Baker's stop in Oman was primarily to give him a brief 
rest between the meeting of the Assn. of Southeast Asian Nations that ended 
Friday in Brunei and the start today of President Bush's European trip. Baker 
is scheduled to join the President in Warsaw tonight.

<TEXT>
<P>
It's just a political joke making the rounds of Hungarian coffee shops: The 
last Soviet division in Hungary should not be withdrawn, but rather redeployed 
to the southeast to keep the peace with Romania. 
</P>
<P>
"Except it's not that funny," said a Hungarian diplomat here. Romanian 
President Nicolae Ceausescu has twice hinted at his country's capacity to build 
nuclear weapons and is reportedly taking part in a program to develop a 
ballistic missile, the diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
This the is new reality of Eastern Europe as President Bush leaves today for 
visits to Poland and Hungary. The dismantling of the Soviet empire, the last 
colonial empire in the world, is moving almost too fast, even for American 
comfort. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the post-World War II U.S. policy of containing communism, a 
reaction to the Soviet takeover of Eastern Europe, is a dead letter. At least 
in Poland and Hungary, where Bush will travel, the political ideology and 
centrally planned economies of Marxism are being buried -- and age-old national 
and ethnic animosities are resurfacing in ways that recall the chaos of 
pre-World War I Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Washington may not be fully prepared for the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
"You call for tearing down the Berlin Wall," Henry Trofimenko of the Soviet 
Institute for the Study of United States told a recent conference here. "But 
then what?" 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration, reacting to the changes instituted by Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, put forward a new policy this spring called "beyond 
containment." Its goal is to eliminate the barriers between the two Europes, to 
ease the nations of Eastern Europe out of the Soviet orbit without blasting 
them out. 
</P>
<P>
Bush did not call on the Eastern European nations, for example, to leave the 
Warsaw Pact. That would change the balance of forces in Europe radically. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Power Sharing Urged 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, a Polish diplomat said that during the recent negotiations between 
the Polish government and the Solidarity trade union, the United States urged 
"cooperation in the peaceful transition" to power sharing, not "breaking down 
the (communist) system." 
</P>
<P>
And the United States has put no particular pressure on East Germany, 
Czechoslovakia, Romania and Bulgaria, which have vigorously rejected the 
reformist course, to follow the examples of Poland and Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush has left no doubt about his goal. "The Cold War began in Central 
Europe, with the building of the Iron Curtain and the Berlin Wall," he said 
after the recent North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit meeting in Brussels. 
"If the Cold War is to end, it will have to end where it began." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cautious on Interfering 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, the Soviets have had relatively few complaints about the new 
policy, in part because the Administration was very cautious about interfering 
in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"We obviously do not want to promote instability in that region," explained a 
senior U.S. official. "Events there have gone beyond our resources. For the 
past decade, we have spent our wealth on military weapons that are useless in a 
situation that calls for economic aid." 
</P>
<P>
But last week Bush called for the unilateral withdrawal of all Soviet forces 
from Poland and, implicitly, from the entire region. That appears to have 
raised the hackles of Gorbachev as he visited France last week. 
</P>
<P>
If Eastern European nations want to remake their political and economic 
systems, Gorbachev said, that is the "internal affair" of the individual 
nations concerned. The changes should remain within a "socialist framework," he 
added, using a phrase he has used before without defining it. 
</P>
<P>
But then, in what was seen as a warning to Bush as he prepared to leave for 
Poland and Hungary, Gorbachev said that "the present political processes (in 
Eastern Europe) are positive, but they are complex and they are also fragile. 
They are subject to various risks, including destabilization and rupture." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anti-Soviet Demonstrations 
</P>
<P>
"Russians go home" demonstrations have already broken out in Hungarian and 
Polish cities. The most violent of them took place in Krakow, Poland, with 
bottles and other trash thrown at the Soviet Consulate. Moscow has chosen to 
ignore the provocation so far. 
</P>
<P>
But anti-Soviet emotions can quickly get out of hand, especially in the 
superheated mood generated by Bush's impending visit. If Bush appeals for a 
total Soviet troop withdrawal while visiting Poland, for example, that could 
provoke escalating attacks on the Soviets that Moscow could not ignore. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev reportedly told his French hosts what he has said privately to 
others: that the Soviets will not interfere in Eastern Europe as long as the 
West seeks no military advantage there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consensus on Reforms 
</P>
<P>
The consensus among U.S. and foreign experts is that the best interests of 
Washington and Moscow will be served if the political, economic and social 
reforms in Eastern Europe -- some call them revolutions -- are peacefully 
managed. 
</P>
<P>
Any reversal of the process, and particularly any Soviet military intervention 
in Eastern Europe, would have far worse consequences than Moscow's previous 
invasions. It would plunge U.S.-Soviet relations into a new and deeper Cold War 
for at least the rest of the century, according to a senior U.S. official. 
</P>
<P>
It would also put an end to Gorbachev's internal reforms of perestroika 
(restructuring) and glasnost (openness), and to his "new thinking" in foreign 
policy, which has yielded the troop withdrawal from Afghanistan and unilateral 
troop reductions in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Intervention is most likely if the pressing economic problems of Poland and 
Hungary turn to riots. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looking for Bailout 
</P>
<P>
Neither nation can generate enough wealth to restructure its economy on its 
own. Both countries -- and the Soviets -- want the West to bail them out. 
</P>
<P>
But the West is insisting on continuing political and economic reforms as a 
condition for aid. At the Paris economic summit, which Bush will attend next 
weekend after leaving Hungary, the world's seven leading industrial democracies 
are expected to devise a cooperative economic plan to help Poland and Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
The four other Soviet Bloc nations -- Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany 
and Romania -- are in better economic shape today, but most experts predict 
they will soon have similar problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The main issue," said a Polish scholar who asked not to be named, "is how East 
Europe and even the Soviet Union itself can be integrated into the Western 
economic community." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Multi-Party Systems 
</P>
<P>
Both Hungary and Poland are on the way to multi-party political systems with at 
least some of the trappings of market economies. Poland is more advanced 
politically, but its economic problems are so urgent and all-consuming that 
beyond solvency, its reformers have not laid out coherent national goals. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary has had greater success with economic reforms while moving slower 
toward political pluralism. Its long-term goal is to become the Sweden of 
Central Europe, according to Hungarian officials. They said the nation would be 
"a neutral, socialist democracy," operating under a constitution in which the 
legislative and judicial branches are separated from the executive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Communists Lack Majority 
</P>
<P>
That government would be leftist, with communists playing a major role but 
lacking an absolute majority in Parliament. The country would be owned 
one-third by the state, one-third by industrial and agricultural cooperatives, 
and one-third by private individuals or corporations, including foreign firms. 
</P>
<P>
Hungarians believe the Soviets would not object to these goals, even to 
neutrality of the country, in a decade or so. But they recognize the danger of 
Soviet intervention if they move too fast, particularly in seeking new security 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin would be less likely to accept the neutrality of Poland, a more 
strategic territory than Hungary. The critical supply lines to its forces in 
East Germany, considered the Soviets' most important ally in Eastern Europe, 
run through Poland. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Soviet Forces in Poland 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviets tell us that stability in Poland is most important, even more 
important than Poland remaining communist," said a Polish diplomat. "They also 
indicate that they would want to move troops into Poland if there was a war." 
About 40,000 Soviet troops are now based in Poland, but they are logistical 
support personnel rather than combat forces. 
</P>
<P>
Least tolerable to the Soviets, experts believe, would be for either Hungary or 
Poland to leave the Warsaw Pact and join the NATO alliance, as Hungary seemed 
tempted to do in 1956. A Hungarian diplomat concluded: "Unless there was a 
profound military threat to the Soviet Union from Central Europe, we don't 
believe the Soviets would intervene." 
</P>
<P>
A Kremlin official was not so sure. Citing a Russian proverb, he said: 
"Everything is reversible in life, except time."

RENOVATIONS STIR UP NEW POISON FEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, Times Environmental Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fleeing the suburbs to be nearer their jobs, young professional couples are 
buying and proudly restoring old houses and, in the process, inadvertently 
poisoning their young children with dust from lead paint. 
</P>
<P>
Recent studies have found that even low levels of lead may impair children's 
intelligence and learning potential, forcing public health authorities to 
reevaluate their estimates of the number of children at risk and to reconsider 
the level at which intervention should be required. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been many sleepless nights feeling guilty about what we might have 
done to our children, just because we didn't know," said Allen Gibson, 32, a 
Charleston, S.C., attorney whose young son was poisoned during the remodeling 
of their century-old home. 
</P>
<P>
Because the effects of low-level, asymptomatic poisoning are subtle, the 
Gibsons probably will never know whether their children have lost any 
intellectual potential. "I know you're not supposed to get really wrapped up 
with the IQ level of your child," said Allen's wife, Wendy Gibson, 28, a 
homemaker. "But if any numbers have been knocked off our children's IQ, we'll 
never forgive ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
The main culprit in poisonings is paint in older homes, especially those built 
before the 1950s. The poor are disproportionately affected because they tend to 
live in the oldest housing. But members of the middle class are not immune and, 
with gentrification, more and more are falling victim. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In Millions of Homes 
</P>
<P>
Like asbestos, lead paint can be found in millions of homes built before 1977, 
when the Consumer Products Safety Commission restricted the metal in household 
paint for sale. In a report to Congress last year, the federal Agency for Toxic 
Substances and Disease Registry estimated that about 12 million American 
children live in housing that contains lead paint at potentially toxic levels, 
and about 3 million to 4 million may have hazardous levels of the metal in 
their blood. 
</P>
<P>
"Lead poisoning these days is the most common preventable disease in the 
pediatric age group," said Dr. John Rosen, a professor of pediatrics at Albert 
Einstein College of Medicine in New York. "It's a national disgrace." 
</P>
<P>
Lead from any source is harmful to children, whether from food contaminated by 
lead-soldered cans or improperly glazed dishes, water by lead in pipes and 
solder, or soil and dust by freeways or industry. However, lead paint continues 
to be the major single source of poisoning in the United States. (Although 
pencils are made of graphite, not lead, they may be a source of poisoning if 
they are covered with lead paint.) 
</P>
<P>
A child can be poisoned by lead-tainted dust emitted from a painted surface 
that is cracked, water-damaged or peeling, even when the top layers are regular 
oil or latex paint. Even intact, uncovered lead paint can poison a susceptible 
child because it chalks and contaminates household dust. A baby teething on a 
door or windowsill, where lead paint was most often used, is also vulnerable, 
although most severe poisonings still occur from chronically eating paint 
chips. The higher the lead content, the sweeter they taste. 
</P>
<P>
Stripping old paint can be nearly as perilous as removing asbestos. Sanding, 
scraping or burning it with a heat gun raises a fine, invisible dust or vapor 
that can be extremely toxic. Lead particles are distributed into the 
environment, coating the floors, walls, furniture and children's toys with an 
invisible poison. 
</P>
<P>
Although the phase-out of lead in gasoline in the early 1970s is generally 
credited with reducing the average level of lead in the general population, it 
did not end the hazard. In the last three to five years, there have been 
ominous signs from around the world that even this progress has been 
insufficient. Careful epidemiological investigations have reported the same 
unsettling conclusion: lead in young children, even at levels thought to be 
safe, appears to cause long-lasting if not permanent damage in cognitive 
ability.

<P>
Children More Susceptible 
</P>
<P>
Adults can get lead poisoning, but children are more susceptible because of 
differences in metabolism and excretion of the metal. Adults absorb about 10% 
of the lead they ingest; children absorb about 50%. Women of childbearing age 
are also considered of special concern because lead crosses the placenta and 
can impair brain development in a fetus. 
</P>
<P>
Health authorities recommend screening children up to 6 years of age. One- to 
3-year-olds are considered most vulnerable because they are undergoing rapid 
neurological and physical development and are prone to put their hands and 
dust-covered objects in their mouths. At that age, children also are more 
likely to have iron deficiency, which makes them more susceptible to lead 
poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
Lead attacks the brain, which is still developing in young children and the 
fetus. The metal can reduce a child's intelligence and cause hearing problems, 
hyperactivity, impaired reaction time, impulsiveness and difficulty in 
persisting in a task. The effects are often permanent, even after medical 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The Gibsons' 3 1/2-year-old son, Walker, was poisoned by dust about a year ago 
when his father used a sander, a heat gun and a scraper to remove several 
layers of old paint from elaborate moldings and door frames in their newly 
purchased home. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to bring out the detail of the wood -- lovingly restoring an old 
home," the Charleston attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shared Picnic Lunches 
</P>
<P>
Before moving in, he worked on the house on the weekends and his wife and son 
brought him picnic lunches which they shared on the floor. "Of course Walker 
thought it was great fun," Wendy Gibson recalled. "He thought he was in some 
cave somewhere. We would pull over a box and sit down to eat." 
</P>
<P>
"I look back at it," she said in a flat voice, "and cringe." 
</P>
<P>
"He would have a cookie or a sandwich in the midst of all this lead paint," his 
father said. "It was the dust. We never saw him with anything (such as paint 
chips) in his mouth." 
</P>
<P>
Although Walker had no symptoms, his pediatrician recommended that he be tested 
for lead because of the remodeling. His level was more than twice the national 
average, and after moving into their new home, it climbed above 25 micrograms 
per deciliter of blood, the level considered toxic by public health 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Frightened and nearly "hysterical," Wendy moved him and her newborn son, 
Andrew, to Florida to stay with her parents while Allen worked with public 
health authorities to clean out the lead dust. 
</P>
<P>
"We had so looked forward to involving ourselves in restoring a historic old 
home," she said, "and then I just felt angry that we had bothered at all. I was 
ready to sell the house and move back." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Warned of Danger 
</P>
<P>
Besides the disappointment, there was bitterness that no one had warned her of 
the dangers. She called friends who had done similar work, and they, too, were 
unaware. "I don't think people realize how common it is," she said, looking out 
her window and watching workers scrape the paint off her neighbor's equally 
historic home. "It is probably happening, and people don't realize it." 
</P>
<P>
At relatively low levels, such as Walker's, the effects of lead may be 
invisible to parents or doctors. It is only when such children are studied in 
populations that differences are noticed. Toddlers who were exposed to lead in 
the womb and in the first year of life score lower on cognitive development 
tests than other children. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Centers for Disease Control recommend intervention at 25 
micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood, that level is undergoing review and 
is expected to be lowered within a year. Recent epidemiological studies from 
Greece, Scotland and Denmark have found that children with blood lead levels as 
low as 10 and 15 micrograms per deciliter scored an average of 4 to 7 points 
lower on IQ tests than children who were not exposed. 
</P>
<P>
Walker's highest level was 31 micrograms per deciliter, and his brother, 
Andrew, now 15 months old, was tested at 1 year old and had a level of 11. For 
an individual child, however, it is virtually impossible to predict what effect 
low-level exposure will have because reactions and vulnerability can vary 
significantly. What damages one may leave another unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Epidemiologists' Concern 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the loss of a few IQ points may have relatively little effect on an 
individual's lifetime achievement. Indeed, much of the concern of 
epidemiologists is the effect on a population in which even low lead exposure 
significantly reduces the number of people with superior intelligence and 
raises the number who are below average. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Herbert Needleman, a professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at the 
University of Pittsburgh and a leading authority on lead and children, said the 
loss of IQ points from lead may not be as detrimental to a child's future as 
the other effects of poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
"The ability to persist in boring work is important because that's what a lot 
of school is -- very boring," he said. "Distractibility, persistence, 
impulsiveness, frustration, all those things are affected by lead." 
</P>
<P>
Needleman studied asymptomatic lead-intoxicated children whose levels at the 
time they were measured did not exceed the then-higher federal health 
guidelines. For the high group, the average lead level was 35 micrograms per 
deciliter; the low group had an average of 24 micrograms. 
</P>
<P>
In the first and second grades, the children with the higher lead levels scored 
lower on IQ tests and on scales measuring auditory and language function and 
attention span. Teachers who were unaware of the lead levels rated those with 
the higher exposure more distractable, disorganized, hyperactive and impulsive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Likely to Be Held Back 
</P>
<P>
By the fifth grade, those with the higher levels were more likely to be held 
back a grade or referred for special services. 
</P>
<P>
By age 18 or 19, those with the higher levels had more reading disabilities, 
lower scores on vocabulary, grammatical reasoning and fine motor tests and 
slower reaction times. There were also more high school dropouts among the 
high-lead group. 
</P>
<P>
Because many lead-intoxicated children do not have symptoms, particularly at 
low levels, poisoning cases may often go undetected. An Oakland couple, for 
example, did not discover that their children had been poisoned two years ago 
until their cat became sick. A veterinarian diagnosed lead poisoning. 
Subsequent tests on the couple's two toddlers found enough lead in their blood 
to require hospitalization for chelation, the removal of lead from the blood. 
The children had been poisoned during the renovation of their Victorian home. 
</P>
<P>
Some lead specialists speculate that poorer children are more likely to be 
tested for lead than higher-income youngsters because of a misperception that 
lead poisoning is only a poor person's disease. Dr. J. Routt Reigart, a 
pediatrician at the Medical University of South Carolina and an expert on 
childhood lead poisoning, maintains that any neighborhood that has housing 60 
to 100 years old has a problem. "I would almost bet on it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Testing Begins 
</P>
<P>
Health authorities in Charleston began testing low-income children for lead 16 
years ago and found that about 40% had above 40 micrograms per deciliter in 
their blood, he said. But few affluent children were tested until a recent 
series of articles in the city's newspaper raised parental anxiety and 
heightened pediatricians' awareness. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing how many of them are coming up with abnormal test results," 
Reigart said. He was interviewed as he waited at the hospital for the admission 
of the 28-month-old grandchild of a prominent surgeon in town, a baby girl who 
had been poisoned during the renovation of her home. Her blood lead that day 
had reached 60 micrograms per deciliter. 
</P>
<P>
"Our experience has been that . . . in somewhere between 70% and 80% of people 
who do renovations without removing their children from the house, the children 
have elevated levels in their blood -- higher when the family is doing the work 
themselves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Many parents of children with learning disabilities now tell him they renovated 
old houses when the children were 1 or 2 years old. "They had vague symptoms 
that no one ever tied to the lead, and now they have learning problems," 
Reigart said. "That's what we are trying to prevent." 
</P>
<P>
The most tragic cases, of course, are bright youngsters who were mentally 
retarded after eating large amounts of lead, usually in paint chips. Physicians 
who have treated such children describe playful, alert toddlers who reached 
their developmental milestones on time -- learning to walk, talk and interact 
normally -- only to end up mentally impaired and in remedial classes at school. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Children Lose Skills 
</P>
<P>
"You have no real feeling for just what a terrible thing this can be until you 
run into a mother or a grandmother taking care of a child and she said, 'Oh 
yes, Johnny, he doesn't tie his shoes anymore,' and they call him in, and you 
are looking at a little kid who has been lead-poisoned," said Jim Simpson, a 
public health adviser for the Centers for Disease Control who witnessed such a 
scene many years ago in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
The prospects are brighter but still uncertain for Reina Rugerio, 3, of Long 
Beach, who was in danger of going into convulsions from lead poisoning two 
months ago. Bright-eyed with dark thick lashes and a ponytail, Reina betrayed 
no trace of illness while at home three weeks ago, skipping around the tidy 
living room, eating Popsicles and proudly showing off her necklaces. 
</P>
<P>
She had been eating paint for several weeks, peeling it with her fingernails 
from a metal water heater closet in the back yard, before she was diagnosed 
with lead poisoning. Her mother said she tried many times to break Reina of 
eating paint, finally slapping the child across the mouth in desperation and 
even trying a paint chip herself to discover the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"It tasted like chalk," Areli Maravilla, 23, an immigrant from El Salvador, 
said through an interpreter. "Reina liked the crunch of it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Symptoms Described 
</P>
<P>
The girl developed severe nosebleeds, waking up in the mornings in a pool of 
blood with the sheets soaked. "I got very frightened because my daughter had 
always been very active and playful, and she wouldn't eat and she wouldn't 
play," her mother recalled, sitting in their living room, filled with plants 
and plastic flowers and pictures of children. "It got to the point that she was 
afraid to go to bed at night." 
</P>
<P>
At first, anemia was diagnosed and only later lead poisoning. Reina was 
hospitalized in May for chelation therapy. Her lead level, however, rose again 
and she returned to the hospital last month. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely do worry about the long range but I don't know for sure right now 
what could happen because they haven't explained that much to me," Maravilla 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It is this uncertainty about the long-term consequences that haunts parents of 
lead victims. 
</P>
<P>
"I would find myself asking, 'Oh my God, is she acting more hyperactive than 
usual? Is that because of the lead? Is she having an attention deficit right 
now?' " said Minda Bernstein, 36, whose 21-month-old daughter, Zoe, was 
poisoned last summer. "I couldn't help myself." 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein said she had to make herself come to terms with her fears. "I didn't 
want to be asking every time she got a low grade on a math test, was it because 
of the lead? I finally made a conscious decision to try to lay it to rest, and 
with time, it is getting easier." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Had Taken Precautions 
</P>
<P>
A bright child with light blue eyes and dark blonde hair cut in a pixie, Zoe 
was poisoned when her parents, concerned about the peeling lead paint in their 
New York country home, tried to remove it for her safety. They were aware of 
the dangers of removal, and they took precautions to protect her. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the woodwork was taken outside to be stripped, and the rest done on the 
second story of the 17-room house. The family remained isolated in two rooms 
that they thought they had sealed from the rest of the house. At the end of 
each day, the house was vacuumed thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
It was all futile. Vacuuming just spread the tiny lead particles: They escaped 
through the holes in the bag. On a rainy day, Zoe's father, Harle Thomas, 40, 
accidentally tracked in a paint chip. Zoe ate part of it before her horrified 
parents could get it out of her mouth. 
</P>
<P>
They called a poison-control center. Officials there told them not to worry 
about a single paint chip but to get Zoe tested eventually because of the 
paint-removal work in the house. Nearly three months after the work began, Zoe 
had a lead level of 37 micrograms per deciliter, and she was hospitalized for 
chelation. The dust, not the chip, was to blame. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Intelligence a Consolation 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein said her only consolation is Zoe's obvious intelligence. She is alert 
and talkative, successfully attempting such words as "condominium" and 
"curious," and seems to be developing on target or even in advance of 
expectations. But no medical expert will tell Bernstein that her child has 
suffered no permanent damage, an assurance the mother "repeatedly wanted to 
hear," and she has found no comfort in reading reams of scientific reports 
about lead in children. 
</P>
<P>
Rosen, the professor of pediatrics at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine 
in New York, evaluated Zoe's case and advised her parents on treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"She has very supportive, interested parents, and if she has lost a couple of 
IQ points, her nurturing environment is a great compensation to fall back on," 
said Rosen, an expert on diagnosing and treating lead intoxication. "So I am 
optimistic. Hopefully, she will be all right or, to the extent there is a loss 
of potential, it will be very minor for her."

Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh predicted that the Supreme Court will eventually 
take action that will "have the effect" of overturning the landmark Roe vs. 
Wade decision legalizing abortion. In an interview with CNN's "Evans &amp; 
Novak," Thornburgh said the high court's decision last week to uphold a 
Missouri law restricting abortions "was consistent with the goals that we (in 
the Bush Administration) seek of returning the regulation of abortions to the 
state." The Supreme Court ruling did not overturn the 1973 Roe vs. Wade 
decision or allow states to forbid abortion but did allow them to restrict it. 
"I think eventually they will take action that will have the effect of 
overruling (Roe vs. Wade)," Thornburgh said.

PIPELINE TEST ADVOCATED

<TEXT>
<P>
A powerful pipeline explosion that killed two people and injured 31 others in 
San Bernardino could have been avoided if a routine pressure test had been 
conducted, a pipeline safety official has told a congressional committee. 
Richard L. Beam, director of the federal Office of Pipeline Safety, told the 
subcommittee on investigations and oversight for the House Public Works and 
Transportation Committee that a pressure test would have revealed the danger. A 
spokesman for Calnev Pipe Line Co., which owns the pipeline, defended the 
company's inspection of the line, which was conducted after a high-speed train 
derailment in the area. But one panel member said that the governmental 
regulation of pipelines is so lax that the state fire marshal's office had no 
record of the pipeline, which supplies 90% of the gasoline to the city of Las 
Vegas.

An international association of computer professionals is planning to lift an 
eight-year ban on contacts with the Soviet Union because of improvements in 
human rights and scientific freedom. Bryan Kocher, president of the 
73,000-member Assn. for Computing Machinery, said the ban was adopted in 1981, 
primarily in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, but that the 
reasons for it have "now disappeared." At the same time, the New York-based 
group has sent letters to Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping warning that 
professional exchanges with China could be jeopardized by Beijing's violent 
suppression of the country's pro-democracy movement.

The Army has temporarily grounded more than 3,400 troop carrier and medical 
evacuation Huey helicopters so that a defective part installed in some of the 
choppers can be replaced. Lt. Col. John Chapla, an Army spokesman, said the 
part, known as a universal control lever, is a component of the system in 
UH-1H, UH-1V and UH-1D series helicopters that enables the pilot to control the 
aircraft. The spokesman said the U.S. Army has about 3,000 UH-1H helicopters 
and 400 to 500 UH-1V helicopters specially equipped for medical evacuation.

THOUSANDS BATTLE 29 WESTERN WILDFIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thousands of firefighters -- plagued by erratic winds, lightning and a summer 
heat wave -- fought to contain about 29 wildfires that were burning more than 
87,000 acres in Western states, threatening homes in some places. Fire crews 
were at work in Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, California and 
Washington. Four big fires burned in interior Alaska, one having charred an 
estimated 24,000 acres. The Boise Interagency Fire Center in Idaho said 7,000 
to 7,500 people were on fire lines, along with 42 air tankers and 10 
helicopters. Many of the fires were in areas that had not burned in a number of 
years, spokesman Arnold Hartigan said, and some were in inaccessible terrain.

A San Francisco court has approved payments to 205 homosexual men and women as 
part of the $3.5-million settlement reached in 1986 with Pacific Bell in an 
anti-gay job discrimination case. Each plaintiff will receive anywhere from a 
few thousand dollars to $80,000, depending on how the awards are meted out by a 
court-appointed arbitrator, said Leonard Graff of National Gay Rights 
Advocates, the law firm that filed the class-action suit in 1975. The case 
represents the largest anti-gay job discrimination case in the nation, Graff 
said.

On the eve of a critical vote to place a proposed half-cent sales tax increase 
for transportation projects on Orange County's November ballot, a Times Poll 
shows local voters almost evenly divided, with support slipping. Asked how they 
would vote on a ballot measure to raise the county sales tax from 6% to 6 1/2%, 
48% of the respondents said they would favor it, 46% opposed it and 6% were 
unsure. Support was at 54% last summer. The Orange County Transportation 
Commission is expected to vote Monday to call a Nov. 7 special election on the 
sales tax question, partly to avoid having the county tax measure appear on the 
same ballot in June with Gov. George Deukmejian's proposed statewide gasoline 
tax hike. The proposed tax would raise $3.1 billion for an $11.5-billion, 
20-year traffic improvement and growth management plan. The remaining $8.4 
billion would come from the state and federal governments.

A radical Palestinian guerrilla leader said that the adoption of hard-line 
peace conditions by Israel's Likud Party proves that the policies of Palestine 
Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat are useless. Ahmed Jibril, leader 
of the anti-Arafat Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General 
Command, said in a statement issued in Damascus, Syria: "We consider the Likud 
conditions as a slap in the face to Arafat and his capitulatory moves."

The Soviet Lithuanian Parliament passed a law that goes a step beyond national 
legislation in giving land back to farmers after decades of collectivization, 
the Lithuanian Communist Party daily Sovietskaya Litva reported. The law, which 
goes into effect Aug. 1, would -- without charge -- give farmers the land they 
now farm with the right to pass it on to heirs, the paper said. The law does 
not allow farmers to sell land, a step Moscow might view as a violation of the 
Communist ban on ownership of major private property.

U.S. Customs Service surveillance planes watched a plane drop bales of cocaine 
to a speedboat just inside Cuban waters, then withdrew as Cuban MIG fighters 
approached. A few hours later, federal agents recovered 1,600 pounds of cocaine 
from the speedboat, found abandoned 20 miles south of Miami, said Patrick 
O'Brien, U.S. customs special agent in charge for South Florida. "The crackdown 
in Cuba has done little to stop the flow of drugs," O'Brien said. He said the 
seizure is significant because it follows a Cuban crackdown on drugs that has 
reached the highest levels of the Communist island nation's government.

Greece's new conservative-Communist government coalition won its first 
confidence vote in Parliament, clearing the way for the prosecution of former 
Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and other defeated Socialists. The 
unprecedented coalition won 174 votes in the 300-seat Parliament after a stormy 
debate in which Socialist deputies denounced a decision to name Papandreou as a 
target for criminal investigation. The confidence vote, required by the 
constitution, was the last procedural hurdle before the coalition could start 
work on lifting immunity and prosecuting former Socialist ministers for alleged 
involvement in financial scandals.

PROTESTS OVER, CHINA STUDENTS FACE EXAMS

The students in the courtyard of the Ritan High School on Saturday were not 
thinking about pro-democracy protests, counterrevolutionary rebellions or 
martial law. They were cramming. 
</P>
<P>
Just six weeks ago, many of the high school seniors had joined in the massive 
protests in Tian An Men Square, with banners assuring the demonstrators' older 
university leaders, "We are your younger brothers and sisters; we are the next 
you." 
</P>
<P>
But now, with textbooks open under Beijing's baking summer sun, they were 
sweating it out in the process of taking their college entrance exams. 
</P>
<P>
The protests of the spring, they explained, are a thing of the past. The exams 
are their future. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Politics Now Secondary 
</P>
<P>
"We still care about politics, but right now that is secondary," said one 
senior, an 18-year-old woman who spoke good English to an American visitor in 
the courtyard shortly before an afternoon round of testing began. "This is the 
most important thing in our life right now. 
</P>
<P>
"If we fail, no job, no money bad life. But if we succeed now and make it to 
the university, maybe then we can again think about politics. Yes, the pressure 
on every one of us is very, very great right now." 
</P>
<P>
"Black July," the students' traditional nickname for the all-important three 
days of college testing, has arrived in Beijing. This year, it has a stark 
double meaning with the exams coming just a few weeks after the army and 
hard-line Communist Party leaders cracked down on the student-led protests and 
killed hundreds -- some say thousands -- of pro-democracy demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
But there are other, larger forces at work in Chinese society. And for nervous 
high school students throughout China this weekend, the present reality was 
largely restricted to their own personal futures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pressure of Competition 
</P>
<P>
The pressure is in the numbers. During the three days of testing that ends 
today with an examination of their political loyalties, 2.26 million high 
school students competed for 640,000 university slots. Nearly three-fourths of 
them will not make the cut, and instead will be assigned to work units in 
factories, offices or farms -- or, worse, be forced to go out and find their 
own jobs at a time of unprecedented unemployment and inflation. 
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, the students have some advantage. The schools here, and in most 
major Chinese cities, are better than those in the countryside. But the 
pressure to succeed also is intense in Beijing, where there were 34,800 high 
school students trying to qualify for 17,000 university openings. 
</P>
<P>
The exams, although similar in concept to America's Scholastic Aptitude Tests, 
are far longer and more difficult than their U.S. counterparts. And now, after 
eight years of economic liberalization have created a new consciousness of 
consumerism and ambition once unheard of in Communist China, the pressure is 
all the greater. 
</P>
<P>
Even the English-language China Daily commented on the phenomenon. It told 
about Zhu Zhisheng, who had accompanied his ailing son to school for the first 
round of testing Friday. Last month, Zhu explained, his son was hospitalized 
for a severe stomach ailment. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to wait here," he told the newspaper. "I am afraid he might break 
down." 
</P>
<P>
So dreaded is the testing process that in the past it has led to widespread 
cheating and even suicide. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the government reported that one student had hidden a two-way 
microphone inside his shirt and was fed answers from 21 collaborating teachers 
and school officials. At the same time, the party newspapers told about a 
19-year-old student who was caught cheating and later strangled his parents in 
a fit of rage. And a third Beijing student who had been driven to suicide by 
the entrance exams left a note that despondently proclaimed, "I am no longer 
naive and happy. I have become indifferent to the outside world. I am just a 
slave to exams. Only when I die can I be free." 
</P>
<P>
Although Saturday's mood in the courtyard of Ritan High School was free of 
evidence of such despair, many comments of the young men and women reflected 
the additional anxiety provoked by the recent grim events, which occurred 
during a time when high school seniors ordinarily would have been studying hard 
for the entrance exams 
</P>
<P>
The exams test students on a full range of subjects, including mathematics, 
English, science, history and politics. The political testing that takes place 
today was the subject of most of the conversation in the courtyard Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Student Mocks Deng 
</P>
<P>
"Oh yeah, Deng Xiaoping (China's paramount leader) is very correct," one 
student shouted with a laugh. "Everything Comrade Deng says is perfectly 
correct. This is how to pass the political exam." 
</P>
<P>
Another young man was a bit more serious, but he sounded equally cynical. 
</P>
<P>
"They ask us to differentiate between the capitalist system and the socialist 
system, and we're supposed to include in our answer the facts that, No. 1, if 
you want to be president of the United States, you have to be rich, and, No. 2, 
the concept of democracy in the West only works for those who have money. 
</P>
<P>
"But don't you have any of this kind of stuff in the United States?" 
</P>
<P>
The American visitor replied that college entrance exams in the United States 
test only academic subjects, not political indoctrination. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . I wish I could take that test," the student replied. "I'd do just fine 
on the American test." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hand of Caution 
</P>
<P>
An even more serious student placed his hand on his friend's back and said, 
"You shouldn't be saying these things to a foreigner," but the friend just 
shrugged it off. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old woman who had said politics must now come second discussed her 
role in the pro-democracy demonstrations more openly than the others in the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
"I was there," she said. "There were 1 million of us in the street. But the 
newspapers in Beijing said we were only 30,000. And then, after the army came 
(on June 3-4), I went around asking other students how many people had died, 
and everyone said thousands, maybe 10,000. But the government said only 300 
were killed. I think somebody is lying. 
</P>
<P>
"We are still thinking about these things. They still worry us. But, well, 
today, there just isn't time for this. We must worry more about our future." 
</P>
<P>
Asked why it is so important for her personally to win a place in the 
university, the woman pointed to the young man beside her and said, "He is a 
boy. He has many paths he can take, even if he fails the exams. I am a girl. If 
I fail, I have very few choices. I don't want to be a simple typist or a farmer 
or a factory worker." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about her aspirations, she said: "I want to be a teacher -- a Chinese 
language teacher. 
</P>
<P>
She said it didn't matter to her that an average teacher's salary in China is 
only 160 yuan (about $40) a month. "The money isn't important. I just want to 
do something useful." 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, her smile faded, and speaking almost in a whisper, she said: "Uh oh. 
It's a soldier." 
</P>
<P>
A People's Liberation Army officer in fatigues was frowning and staring as he 
approached the group of students and the American. 
</P>
<P>
"We better shut up, and you better go," she said nervously. "Besides, we have 
to go take our exams. And that really is more important now." 
</P>

ARGENTINA'S ALFONSIN HANDS OVER THE REINS TO MENEM

<P>
Peronist Carlos Saul Menem, who dreamed of the presidency from his jail cell 
during the last dictatorship, took office Saturday with a call for 
reconciliation and sacrifice so that "from these ruins, we will build the 
country we deserve." 
</P>
<P>
Menem, elected in a landslide in May, was sworn in five months early after 
President Raul Alfonsin resigned in the face of a devastating economic crisis 
that has brought unprecedented hunger and hardship. 
</P>
<P>
Although Alfonsin departed with his reputation ravaged by his economic 
failures, he was able to fulfill a historic pledge when he placed the 
blue-and-white presidential sash on Menem. It was the first transition from a 
civilian president to an elected successor in six decades, breaking a cycle of 
periodic military intervention in politics dating back to 1930. 
</P>
<P>
In his inaugural address, Menem moved still closer to saying that he would 
declare an amnesty for military officers accused of human rights violations 
during the 1976-83 dictatorship. Alfonsin put five former junta members behind 
bars, but his continual conflict with the military led to three army 
rebellions. 
</P>
<P>
Menem, a 59-year-old provincial governor, spent five years in detention without 
charge during that period, along with many other Peronists. He said that after 
nearly six years of democracy, the wounds remain unhealed. "To this, I say 
enough. . . . We are not going to stir up the ghosts." 
</P>
<P>
He focused his speech on the need to attack the structural problems that 
brought Argentina from the ranks of the world's 10 wealthiest countries to 
Third-World style hyperinflation and a minimum wage worth $18 a month. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no other way to say it: The country is broken, devastated, destroyed, 
razed," Menem said. 
</P>
<P>
On Alfonsin's final day in office, officials disclosed that inflation for the 
first week of July alone climbed 45%, with the monthly total expected to be 
near 180%. That is more than four times the record before Alfonsin took office 
for a six-year term that should have ended Dec. 10. 
</P>
<P>
But rather than blame Alfonsin, Menem declared, "The reality that we all must 
admit if we want to succeed is that all of us are responsible for this 
Argentine failure." 
</P>
<P>
In appealing to Argentines to take up this new opportunity -- "perhaps the 
last" -- Menem promised a pragmatic administration that would favor no single 
sector. He said he would attack the tradition of offering privileges to 
whatever group happened to be in power, be it business, labor or the military. 
</P>
<P>
"Argentines, get up and walk," he said in his address to a joint session of 
Congress, attended by six Latin American presidents and delegations from 77 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
Criticized during the campaign for his flamboyant style -- including long hair 
and flowing sideburns -- Menem has surprised many critics with his political 
skills and his ability to reach out to a range of sectors in this divided 
society. Calming fears of continued Peronist state domination in the economy, 
he named a conservative economy minister, Miguel Roig, from the huge 
grain-exporting conglomerate, Bunge and Born. 
</P>
<P>
Menem also made clear he would not pander to the trade union movement, the 
traditional backbone of the Justicialist Party, the formal name for the 
Peronists. He has tried to dislodge the secretary general of the General 
Confederation of Labor, so far unsuccessfully. 
</P>
<P>
He repeatedly said Argentines would have to work, sacrifice and compromise to 
emerge from the crisis and become competitive in world markets. 
</P>
<P>
"Hard days are coming," Menem said from the Government House balcony to 
thousands of Peronists gathered in the Plaza de Mayo. To a joint session of 
Congress, Menem said that Argentines will have to learn to pay taxes and that 
corruption "will be considered treason." 
</P>
<P>
The son of Syrian immigrants, Menem is the first Peronist to be elected in his 
own right other than the party's founder. Gen. Juan D. Peron, who himself 
emerged after a military coup in 1943 to be elected in 1946 and again in 1952, 
was overthrown in a coup in 1955. He returned from exile to rule again briefly 
until his death in July, 1974. 
</P>
<P>
His third wife and vice president, Maria Estela Peron, was deposed in a coup in 
1976 at a time of left-wing insurgency and economic turmoil. During the 
dictatorship that followed, at least 9,000 Argentines "disappeared" and were 
presumed murdered by the regime. Menem said it was "time to turn this painful 
page" and find a definitive solution "for the wounds that have yet to heal." 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts have noted that while the economic crisis now is far more grave, 
the military commanders have never shown interest in intervening, and 
Alfonsin's principal legacy -- respect for civil rights -- remains intact. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the accelerating economic deterioration fostered widespread 
suffering, prompting fears of a social explosion. Hyperinflation slashed buying 
power by 40%, the Argentine currency plunged from 17 australs to the dollar to 
540 australs, and supermarket lootings erupted in May, leaving 15 dead and 
2,000 arrested. That turmoil apparently persuaded Alfonsin to step down early. 
</P>
<P>
Alfonsin and Menem embraced after the ceremony in the Government House, and the 
62-year-old outgoing president flew by helicopter to his home town of Chascomus 
in Buenos Aires province. He has said he plans to remain active in the Radical 
party. 
</P>
<P>
Menem is determined not to repeat the errors of Alfonsin, who would not or 
could not say no to Argentina's array of powerful interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
Menem's advisers insist he will privatize or close money-losing state-owned 
companies that account for half the government's budget deficit and raise the 
cost of public services to their real levels. Details are to be announced 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Although Argentines were bitterly disappointed at the nation's decline during 
Alfonsin's term, most people sounded willing to give Menem a chance, even if 
that meant hardships in exchange for long-term improvements. Menem appeared 
equally determined to take advantage of that good will while it lasts. 
</P>
<P>
"Argentines voted for a transformation of our decadence," he told Congress. 
"Either all Argentines cure this country or Argentina dies. This is the cruel 
choice."

1ST TEST MET, PERU FAVORITE BACK IN RACE; 
</P>
<P>
CONSERVATIVES HEAL RIFT BUT VARGAS LLOSA FACES STIFF CHALLENGES

LIMA, Peru 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, the writer-turned-front-runner for the presidency, 
has been through his rite of initiation in the icy waters of Peruvian politics 
and is still afloat. 
</P>
<P>
But no Peruvian doubts that the campaign ahead, and the presidency itself, if 
he should win it, will pose far greater challenges than the squabble that 
briefly took him out of the race almost as soon as it began. 
</P>
<P>
Vargas Llosa, 52, rejoined the campaign this month as the nominee of the 
conservative Democratic Front Movement, 10 days after resigning and flying off 
to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
He quit when the two largest parties in the coalition refused to agree on 
candidates for mayoral races in November, raising the prospect that 
conservative candidates would run against each other. Reluctant to lose their 
figurehead, who has given the coalition a commanding lead in opinion polls, the 
parties settled their differences, and Vargas Llosa then announced from Spain 
that he was back in the race. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strengthened by Showdown 
</P>
<P>
The novelist's supporters contend he has emerged strengthened from the showdown 
with his veteran partners in the front, former President Fernando Belaunde 
Terry of the centrist Popular Action party and former Lima Mayor Luis Bedoya 
Reyes of the rightist Christian Popular Party. 
</P>
<P>
But others ask how a newcomer to politics such as Vargas Llosa can cope with 
the overwhelming problems in a nation that is suffering advanced symptoms of 
disintegration. 
</P>
<P>
President Alan Garcia, who enjoyed immense popularity when he was elected in 
1985, is staggering through his final year of office in an incalculable crisis. 
Violence by the Maoist guerrilla group Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) and a 
smaller pro-Soviet group has left nearly 15,000 dead since 1980 and terrorized 
much of the country. Inflation has surged to 5,000% a year, and buying power 
has fallen by half since austerity measures began last September. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Constant Strikes 
</P>
<P>
Angry trade unions stage constant strikes, common crime has soared and the 
inefficient state, never fully in control of the whole country, has been 
crippled by the guerrillas in numerous districts. Peruvian intelligence 
officials have estimated that more than 35% of the population won't even be 
able to vote in the presidential election next spring because of the turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether Vargas Llosa has the stomach for it, I don't know," mused a Western 
diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
Although Belaunde and Bedoya recognize that they need Vargas Llosa, the 
author's supporters also realize that they lack the nationwide political 
machinery of the two established parties. Vargas Llosa's Liberty Movement, 
founded last year, has been little more than a group of conservative friends 
from well-to-do sections of Lima, scarce on experience and contact with the 
vast, poor countryside and urban shantytowns. 
</P>
<P>
Thus the Liberty Movement has begun creating its own political organization to 
give Vargas Llosa more muscle within the coalition. More than 25,000 people 
signed up in the first days of the drive last week, said Miguel Cruchaga, the 
movement's secretary general, and the goal is 350,000. 
</P>
<P>
"People were afraid that he could be manipulated by the politicians," Cruchaga 
said. In resigning to force concessions, "he showed that he could stand up to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Vargas Llosa, following a Latin American writers' tradition by entering 
politics, is regarded by some as the region's finest author, with works 
including "The Time of the Heroes" and "Conversations in the Cathedral." He 
scorns being labeled rightist, saying his support comes not only from Lima's 
tiny upper and upper-middle classes but also from the poor who want the 
government off their backs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Divisions in Left 
</P>
<P>
He should benefit not only from his support in the Establishment media but also 
from divisions within the strident left. 
</P>
<P>
Alfonso Barrantes, a former Lima mayor considered the most likely leftist 
presidential candidate, is caught up in wrangling among the seven parties of 
the misnamed United Left coalition. Two small moderate parties have virtually 
broken away to challenge some of the more extremist groups. Barrantes is caught 
unhappily in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
"Shining Path wants Vargas Llosa to win so the confrontation will move to a 
higher level," said Barrantes, an independent Marxist. "This should be a time 
of cooperation, not confrontation. Vargas Llosa is encouraging polarization. 
But we (on the left) are forgetting the principal foe -- the right -- and are 
buried in this secondary fight among ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Mirko Lauer, a political analyst and publisher, said the left appears more 
interested in winning a strong parliamentary base than the presidency. "Who 
wants to be tied to the executive branch and wait for a coup for the next five 
years?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although he dismissed Vargas Llosa as "a media event (without) a party or 
machinery, Lauer added, "The Vargas Llosa mystique is very strong in this 
country; everyone is going preppy." 
</P>
<P>
And now, he said, "Vargas Llosa has been welcomed to the club, like a new boy 
at boarding school who needs to get into a fight and get his nose bloodied 
before he is accepted." 
</P>

MEXICO DEBT TALKS REPORTED CLOSE TO AGREEMENT

<P>
Negotiators for Mexico and a consortium of commercial banks said Saturday that 
they are "close to agreement in principle" on a new financing package for that 
cash-strapped country that is likely to exceed $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Banking industry officials said the outlines of the accord probably would be 
completed late this coming week. Full details of the package are not likely to 
be worked out for several weeks after that. 
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued jointly by senior negotiators for both sides, was 
intended to signal the likelihood that they will reach an accord before the 
start of the annual seven-nation economic summit in Paris on July 15-16. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides have been under intense pressure from the U.S. Treasury 
Department to end the three-month stalemate and hammer out an accord that 
President Bush can use to show that his new Third World debt strategy is 
working. 
</P>
<P>
French President Francois Mitterrand has invited leaders of 22 poor countries 
to an eve-of-summit dinner to discuss the debt issue, and U.S. officials fear 
that Bush could be embarrassed if an accord is not in hand. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. proposal, unveiled March 10 by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, 
already is under growing criticism by debtors and creditors alike, mainly on 
grounds that it cannot provide enough relief to do the job. 
</P>
<P>
The plan calls on commercial banks to forgive a portion of their loans to Third 
World countries in return for receiving guarantees from the International 
Monetary Fund and the World Bank for the remainder of their loans. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's statement said the pending new accord was likely to include "a range 
of options," from paring the amount of the debt owed by Mexico to providing new 
bank loans to that country. 
</P>
<P>
The total of new loans and debt reduction for Mexico would amount to slightly 
more than $3 billion. The Mexicans had asked for something approaching $6 
billion to $7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiations had been stalemated for months, and the Mexicans had begun to 
consider taking new measures -- such as placing their current debt payments in 
escrow -- that would escalate their skirmish with the banks. 
</P>
<P>
However, in the past two weeks, the Bush Administration has stepped up its 
pressure on both sides to complete agreement on at least the outlines of an 
accord. Brady himself jumped into the fray. 
</P>
<P>
The talks are being conducted in New York by a 15-bank advisory committee 
headed by William R. Rhodes, a vice president of Citibank, the largest bank in 
the group, and Jose Angel Gurria, the Mexican undersecretary of the Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico has a $107-billion foreign debt, of which about $75 billion is owed to 
commercial banks, both U.S. and foreign.

The Soviet government has decided to shut down all five nuclear reactors 
producing plutonium for nuclear weapons at this top-secret military center in 
the Ural Mountains, idling two more reactors than originally announced by 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev three months ago in London. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was revealed here by Boris V. Brokhovich, the center's director, 
during an unprecedented two-day visit by a group of U.S. congressmen and 
independent scientists to this vast city with no official name. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest example of the Soviet defense establishment's increasing use of 
openness, Brokhovich guided the group on a lengthy tour of his nation's first 
military reactor and allowed his aides to release detailed new information 
about Soviet weapons production. 
</P>
<P>
He said in an interview Saturday that two of the site's reactors are shut now, 
a third will be closed next month and the remaining two will cease operating in 
1991.

The mother of British hostage John McCarthy died of cancer Saturday without 
knowing whether her son, kidnaped in Lebanon more than three years ago, is 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
Sheila McCarthy, 66, died in a hospital in Cambridge, eastern England, a 
hospital spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
John McCarthy, 32, a cameraman with Worldwide Television News, was kidnaped in 
Beirut in April, 1986. He is one of 15 foreigners missing in Lebanon. Nine are 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Early last week the family had issued a statement in Beirut pleading with 
McCarthy's kidnapers to set him free to allow a final reunion with his mother. 
</P>
<P>
"I urge you in the name of mercy, for which Islam is known, to fulfill the wish 
of a dying woman who wants to see her son before she dies," the family's 
statement in Arabic said.

JAPAN OFFICIAL GETS LESSON ON WOMEN'S ROLE 
</P>

Prime Minister Sosuke Uno's agriculture minister apologized Saturday for saying 
that a woman's place is in the home and that Socialist Party Chairwoman Takako 
Doi is unfit to serve as Japan's prime minister because she is unmarried. 
</P>
<P>
The minister, Hisao Horinouchi, offered the apology and asked that his remarks 
be withdrawn during a news conference that he gave in Tokyo on orders from Uno, 
whose own sex scandals have become an issue in a campaign for a crucial 
election July 23 for the upper house of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Reporters Present 
</P>
<P>
Horinouchi made the offending statements in a campaign speech on behalf of a 
ruling Liberal Democratic Party candidate Friday night in Mie prefecture 
(state). No reporters were present, but women in the audience informed Japanese 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Fragmentary accounts of the speech published Saturday reported that Horinouchi 
said stability and "control" in families has been maintained in Japan "because 
wives have been in the home." 
</P>
<P>
"In the end, a woman's task is to stay home and take care of her family," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, he said at another point, is fit to 
serve in politics "because she has a husband and children and has acted as a 
housewife, but Chairwoman Doi doesn't understand that feeling . . . because she 
is single." 
</P>
<P>
"We must not allow such a person who has never had a family to be a head of the 
state," he added. 
</P>
<P>
At another point, Horinouchi asked rhetorically, "Can women be of any use in 
politics?" 
</P>
<P>
The 64-year-old minister made the remarks in the process of criticizing the 
Socialist Party, whose female candidates won surprising victories in a June 
by-election in a traditionally conservative upper house district, and in a 
Tokyo assembly election last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Women Voters' Key Role 
</P>
<P>
Women voters, angered by the ruling party's imposition of a 3% consumption tax, 
a massive influence-buying scandal, and charges that Uno paid for sex with a 
geisha and a number of bar hostesses, played a key role in both Socialist 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to believe he said it," commented Ryutaro Hashimoto, secretary 
general of the ruling party, whose majority in the upper house is endangered. 
</P>
<P>
Doi herself said she was "dumbfounded" by the comments. Horinouchi, she said, 
"still doesn't seem to realize that Liberal Democratic Party politics is so 
corrupt that women can't keep quiet any more." 
</P>
<P>
She also offered the ruling party a suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
"The Liberal Democratic Party," she said, "should remember that women are 
everywhere in Japan."

The California congressman who is heading the investigation of allegations of 
fraud and political abuse at the Department of Housing and Urban Development 
said in an interview to be aired today that "large numbers of people will go to 
jail" as a result of the probe. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), chairman of the House Government Operations 
employment and housing subcommittee, refused to name the individuals he expects 
to be charged, but he predicted it will be revealed that wrongdoing at the 
agency has cost taxpayers billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"It's much too early at this stage of my investigation to give you a hard 
figure, but when I say billions, I think I'm conservative," Lantos said in a 
taped interview to be broadcast on "The Wall Street Journal Report." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to comment on specific individuals, but I'm fully prepared to 
say that large numbers of people will go to jail -- there's no question about 
it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation was sparked by disclosures about abuse during the Ronald 
Reagan Administration.

PIRANHA IN SANTA BARBARA CITY POND PROVES ELUSIVE TO CAPTORS

A piranha nicknamed Alice that has turned a city pond into its own version of 
"Alice's Restaurant" eluded capture by fishermen armed with nets and electro 
shock equipment, but a second fish bit the hook. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good fight," said city parks worker Bob Sloan who reeled in the 
captured piranha. "He came out of the water twice." 
</P>
<P>
However, Jeff Cope, the park's superintendent, said Alice the piranha seems 
even more wary of people after its compatriot was bagged. The two fish were 
recently spotted in the pond at Alice Keck Park, which has become a popular 
dumping ground for unwanted fish. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Maimed Turtles 
</P>
<P>
Park visitors and workers began finding a number of dead fish that had been 
partially eaten, and turtles were suddenly missing legs. Frogs fled the habitat 
for safer ground. 
</P>
<P>
As dozens of spectators looked on, the first piranha was caught on a hook 
baited with beef liver on Friday morning. Ken Sasaki, state Department of Fish 
and Game biologist, described the fish as measuring 17 inches and weighing 2 
1/2 pounds. The fish actually had been caught once before, but was tossed back 
when it was misidentified as a pacu, a harmless piranha look-alike. 
</P>
<P>
Cope said the park department's next plan of attack may be to get an expert 
archer to skewer the fish, or perhaps use a baited underwater trap.

COALITION LAUNCHES DRIVE TO PROTECT FLAG; 
</P>
<P>
PHONE-IN 'SIGNATURES' WILL SUPPORT CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Veterans groups, conservative organizations, local politicians and a television 
commentator launched a nationwide petition drive Saturday to support a proposed 
constitutional amendment that would prohibit desecration of the American flag. 
</P>
<P>
But the newly formed National Save the Flag Coalition is not canvassing 
neighborhoods for signatures -- it is relying on a national 900 telephone 
number to attract supporters. 
</P>
<P>
During a press conference in Burbank on Saturday, organizers blasted the U.S. 
Supreme Court's June 21 decision that flag-burning is protected by the First 
Amendment and said they hope to get at least 10 million people to pick up their 
phones and dial the 900 number as an act of protest. 
</P>
<P>
"We regard that flag as something that is alive," said Bruce Herschensohn, a 
KABC commentator. "It should have the rights of any citizen of the United 
States." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Names Recorded 
</P>
<P>
By calling 1-(900) 860-9138, the phone company will automatically record the 
name and address of the phone's owner, which will then be transferred to the 
petition. The call costs $2 for the first minute and $1 for each additional 
minute that the caller listens to a prerecorded message denouncing the court's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
The National Save the Flag Coalition is composed of a variety of groups 
including the American Freedom Coalition, the American Legion of Los Angeles 
County, the World Bible Society, the American Pistol and Rifle Assn., Christian 
Voice and the Moose Lodges. 
</P>
<P>
"The flag is more than a symbol. It is really the soul of America," said state 
Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights), who wore red, white and blue 
suspenders at the news conference. "When an American sees the flag, he just 
doesn't see a flag. He sees the hopes and dreams and aspirations of all 
Americans." 
</P>
<P>
Herschensohn, who made an unsuccessful bid for the Republican U.S. Senate 
nomination in 1986, said he will take the petition to Capitol Hill in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Produced TV Program 
</P>
<P>
The American Freedom Coalition, one of the principle organizers of the 
petition, produced the television program "Oliver North: Fight for Freedom" and 
sponsored a petition to have him pardoned. The organization, which is 
headquartered in Washington, has about 500,000 members, according to Robert 
Spitz, executive director in California. 
</P>
<P>
"We support traditional American values," Spitz said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives on June 27 passed a resolution by a 411-5 
vote to express its "profound concern" over the Supreme Court decision. Two 
days later, members of the House -- with President Bush's backing -- introduced 
a constitutional amendment that would ban desecration of the U.S. flag. 
</P>
<P>
Before the amendment can become law, it must be approved by Congress and 
three-fourths of state legislatures.

neighborhoods, arresting more than 185 people, including at least 153 suspected 
gang members. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests were part of the Los Angeles Police Department's periodic 
"Operation Hammer" to combat gang- and drug-related crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Operation Hammer, which was introduced last year, is one of the task forces the 
Police Department is using to blitz the rising number of crimes citywide, said 
LAPD spokesman Lt. Fred Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Story in Figures 
</P>
<P>
Statistics released Friday showed there were 162,711 major crimes recorded in 
Los Angeles during the first six months of 1989, compared to 149,021 in the 
same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
There were also increases in almost all categories of serious crimes. Robberies 
rose 19.9%, with 14,654 robberies committed between Jan. 1 and June 30, 
compared with 12,214 in the same period last year. The next sharpest rise was 
in aggravated assaults, which rose 18% to 21,355 so far this year, compared to 
18,065 last year. Auto thefts were up 14.6%; homicides rose 14.5% to 395 so far 
this year; auto burglaries increased 7.1%; thefts from autos were up 3.2% and 
rapes rose 0.2% to 992. 
</P>
<P>
The only crimes showing a decline were thefts from people -- down 14.5% -- and 
burglaries -- down by 4.3%. 
</P>
<P>
"With the numbers being no more encouraging than they are," Nixon said, Police 
Chief Daryl F. Gates "is mandating his managers to reverse that." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday and Saturday evenings, an extra 200 officers were deployed in 
neighborhoods in Rampart, Northeast, Newton, Hollenbeck and Central areas. 
About 60 arrests were made early Saturday night, most of them suspected gang 
members, said Sgt. John Fletcher. The sweep was scheduled to continue into this 
morning. On Friday, police spokesmen said they made 127 arrests and seized six 
cars. The seizure of suspected gang members' cars is an important part of 
Operation Hammer, police say. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Less Mobility 
</P>
<P>
Said Sgt. Steve Tuohy: "If we get a carload of gang members and we have any 
legal justification, we impound the car. We use that as a tool to take away 
their wheels for a bit. It gives them less mobility." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the increased patrols, police reported that five people were wounded in 
gang-related shootings early Saturday. In South-Central Los Angeles, two male 
gang members and a teen-age girl were wounded in a drive-by shooting. The names 
of the three victims were not immediately released. 
</P>
<P>
Another unidentified man was wounded in the buttocks in what police say was a 
gang-related drive-by shooting in Lincoln Heights early Saturday morning. And 
police reported that another man was shot and wounded in the foot about 1 a.m. 
Saturday southwest of downtown.

TAR 'OOZE' IN SCHOOL'S PLAY YARD IS MYSTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE HARRIS and MAURA DOLAN, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Where a month ago schoolchildren played, a team of federal environmental 
experts drilled 2 1/2 feet into the ground Saturday, seeking clues to the 
mysterious oily, tar-like substance that oozes through the asphalt at Cudahy's 
Park Avenue Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
For four hours, the representatives of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
-- wearing protective clothing, gloves and masks -- collected water, air and 
ground samples from the school's playground. 
</P>
<P>
They shoveled, they poked, they scraped, they sniffed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Gooey and Smelly' 
</P>
<P>
And still, they had little idea exactly what the substance was or what was 
causing it to appear. 
</P>
<P>
"It's black, gooey and smelly," said Doug Frazer, EPA regional project officer, 
noting he believed it contains traces of hydrogen sulfide, a byproduct of 
discarded oil sludge with a pungent scent. 
</P>
<P>
The visit by the EPA was the latest attempt by school, health, environmental 
and community officials to identify the substance that has been appearing 
periodically for 20 years and get to the bottom of why it continues to bubble 
to the playground's surface. 
</P>
<P>
"It was coming up when I attended school there from 1971 to 1975," said Jose 
Mireles of Cudahy, a 26-year-old a Los Angeles policeman. "There was also a 
rotten egg smell in the summer. You couldn't breathe. We thought it was 
normal." 
</P>
<P>
In the face of a new round of complaints by parents and teachers, school 
officials two weeks ago fenced off about one-fourth of the playground, making 
the tar-like spots off-limits to students of the year-round school. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Committee Formed 
</P>
<P>
Cudahy officials have accused the Los Angeles Unified School District of acting 
slowly, teachers at the school have formed what they call an "ooze committee" 
to keep abreast of the issue and a handful of parents have withdrawn their 
children from the school -- with more threatening to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
Some parents complain that their children suffer from eye irritations, rashes 
and headaches. 
</P>
<P>
As early as 1968, when the Cudahy school opened, school district workers had 
patched leaks in the asphalt, long-time school employees said. 
</P>
<P>
EPA spokesman Terry Wilson said Saturday it will take the agency about four 
months to analyze the samples and determine whether the ooze is hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
What is known is that the school and a nearby city park were built atop 
landfills that had operated since the 1930s and were shut down before the early 
1960s, Wilson said. Trash, oil sludge, abandoned vehicles and old boats were 
reportedly dumped there, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although EPA officials said it was yet to be determined whether the substance 
is hazardous, a recent study by an environmental firm for the school district 
identified the ooze as either a type of toxic coal tar or a petroleum-based 
asphalt tar. 
</P>
<P>
School district officials, too, seemed to agree that hazardous compounds are 
present in the ooze but they said they pose little danger to students at the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"We are confident right now that unless students ate a bunch of this stuff or 
rubbed it all over their bodies, there is no problem," said Don Coleman, 
district public information officer. 
</P>
<P>
In a report to the district in December, Thomas N. Dixon, a project geologist 
for Anaheim-based Thorne Environmental Inc., said the firm found in the ooze 
methylene chloride, a potential carcinogen that can cause eye and skin 
irritation and kidney and respiratory ailments. 
</P>
<P>
It also found methylnapthalene, known sometimes as white tar, which can cause 
headaches, eye irritation, abdominal ailments and mental confusion. In 
addition, phenanthrene, a potential carcinogen, and pyrene and benzo pyrene, 
combustion products that are carcinogenic and toxic, were discovered in the 
substance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sources of Danger 
</P>
<P>
The report said the "immediate danger" would come from eating the ooze, 
breathing the vapors if it were burned or from prolonged skin contact. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers and scientists for the state Department of Health Services, which 
investigated the seepage last month, found some different compounds, all of 
them mild to moderate toxins. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Leonard, a program supervisor in the department's toxics division in 
Burbank, said that the substance may be a "petroleum hydrocarbon, possibly a 
refinery byproduct." 
</P>
<P>
Leonard, who performed a preliminary review for the EPA, said the black ooze 
could cause skin burns because of its acidic nature and would be harmful if 
eaten. 
</P>
<P>
School officials stress that the seepage has occurred in isolated spots, not 
throughout the playground's surface. 
</P>
<P>
"They are small spots of asphalt that become gooey when there is hot weather," 
said Shirleen Bolin, a school district administrator. "They are not bubbling 
pools out there like on the Beverly Hillbillies." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Variety of Sizes 
</P>
<P>
She said the ooze spots range in size from that of a half-dollar to 6 to 8 
inches in diameter. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Cudahy City Manager Gerald Caton accused school district officials of 
not being cooperative in responding to inquiries about potential toxins at the 
school site. District officials have denied this. 
</P>
<P>
Now, "We are just pleased that people are taking this seriously and things are 
in motion," Caton said. 
</P>
<P>
The district was ordered last month by state authorities to begin checks of the 
playground and to install barriers until the ooze spots were covered or 
removed. School board member Leticia Quezada said she hoped the installation of 
the fence would "calm any fears and anxiety of parents and the community." 
</P>
<P>
About 100 parents met with district and state health officials last month, with 
some parents demanding promises that children would be unharmed by the 
substance. School officials said that, although they have seen children 
sometimes play with the ooze, they do not know of any cases when a student has 
been harmed.

BODY FOUND IN DESERT BELIEVED TO BE MISSING CAR SALESMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WOOD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A body discovered Saturday in the desert north of Palm Springs is believed to 
be that of Charles Washington, a Los Angeles car salesman who apparently was 
kidnaped earlier this year while on a demonstration drive with a prospective 
customer, Riverside County sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Homicide detectives from the Los Angeles Police Department's Wilshire Division 
went to the scene to help identify the body. 
</P>
<P>
A man who claims that he killed Washington, Yale Booska, 21, was arrested near 
Grand Island, Neb., four days after the car salesman disappeared on April 17. 
Booska reportedly told Nebraska sheriff's deputies that he killed Washington 
and dumped his body somewhere near Interstate 10 "between L.A. and Palm 
Springs." 
</P>
<P>
The body discovered Saturday was in an isolated area known as Painted Hills, 
north of Interstate 10 and west of California 62, the main road between Palm 
Springs and Twentynine Palms. 
</P>
<P>
"It is believed the victim may be Charles Washington," said a press release 
issued by the Riverside County Sheriff's Department, although no positive 
identification has yet been made. 
</P>
<P>
Before his arrest, Booska led Nebraska officers on a wild chase that spanned 
about 75 miles and at one point reached speeds of about 130 m.p.h. He was 
driving the $21,000 sports car in which he and Washington disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Officers searched the desert along Interstate 10, but were unable to locate the 
body. 
</P>
<P>
A hiker reportedly spotted the dead man about 8 a.m. Saturday. Riverside County 
Sheriff's Sgt. John Sebastian said the body appeared to have been dumped and 
was "pretty well intact. It was partially mummified" by heat and sand, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Washington disappeared from Barrish Chrysler-Plymouth on La Brea Avenue in the 
Mid-Wilshire area, apparently while taking Booska on a test drive in a 1989 
Chrysler Conquest sports car. As a result of Washington's kidnaping, the 
Greater Los Angeles Motor Car Dealers Assn. urged dealers and sales people to 
be more cautious with test drives, to obtain a copy of the customer's driver's 
license before allowing anyone to drive a car and to try to have two sales 
people go on each demonstration drive.

ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK PUT CAREER BACK ON TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PITTSBURGH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ed Whitson's eyes smolder with resentment, the sinews in his neck are stretched 
taut. 
</P>
<P>
The subject is New York, and Whitson has difficulty formulating the proper 
words to describe the experience. This is a time in his life that he has longed 
to forget, a time in which he became closer than anyone would know to quitting 
the game of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Today is the three-year anniversary of the day he escaped the shackles of 
playing for the New York Yankees, and for the first time since being traded 
back to the Padres, Whitson spoke extensively about the 18 months that he 
described as a "living hell." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking ever so softly, almost in a whisper, Whitson said, "There wasn't a day 
that went by where I didn't fear for my life, or the safety of my family. Every 
day I went out that door I wondered what would happen to me. I didn't know if 
I'd be shot. I didn't know if somebody'd blow up my car. I didn't know if 
somebody'd run me off the road. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I was carrying a bull's-eye on my back, waiting for someone to 
take that first shot." 
</P>
<P>
Whitson closed his eyes, momentarily allowing his mind to recapture the feeling 
that threatened his sanity, his face showing an odd mixture of relief and 
appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
Bizarre as it sounds, Whitson says that if not for his days in Yankee 
pinstripes, this fantasy season he's living might not have been possible. 
</P>
<P>
He enters the All-Star break with an 11-6 record, three victories shy of his 
career best in 1984 and on pace to become the Padres' first 20-game winner 
since Gaylord Perry in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"It's crazy, isn't it?" Whitson said in his Tennessee drawl. "The worst time in 
my life might be responsible for the best time in my life. 
</P>
<P>
"Boy, who would have ever figured?" 
</P>
<P>
It's the day after Christmas, 1984. Whitson is driving to his Dublin, Ohio, 
home from the Columbus International Airport, where he had just spent the past 
45 minutes talking with Yankee owner George Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
The radio's blaring as Whitson cruises down the road, and he grimaces when he 
hears the weatherman predict snow. He recalled the conversation he had just had 
with Steinbrenner, feeling good that a man of his stature wants him to play for 
his ballclub. But he's a country boy who was raised with a fishin' pole in one 
hand and a can of worms in the other, and Steinbrenner reluctantly understood 
when Whitson turned down his offer. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, with no one else in the car, Whitson blurts aloud, "How much did he 
just offer me?" 
</P>
<P>
A five-year contract that would guarantee him $4.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Shoot, the most money he'd ever seen in his life while growing up was the 
$5,000 the Pittsburgh Pirates offered him out of high school. And now someone 
wants to provide him financial security for life? 
</P>
<P>
"I remember turning the radio down and saying to myself, 'I've got to think 
about this.' I mean, I'm thinking so hard I'm driving 30 m.p.h. in my Corvette, 
and you know, a Corvette don't run too good at 30 m.p.h." 
</P>
<P>
When he reaches home, he tells his wife, Kathleen, of the offer. He knows it 
sounds crazy to be talking about living in New York, but even a fella like 
himself from the back hills of Tennessee can figure out that $4.4 million over 
five years is a whole heck of a lot better than the $2.8 million over four 
years that the Padres are offering to keep him. 
</P>
<P>
In a matter of an hour, he telephones his agent, Tom Reich, who is on a skiing 
vacation in Utah. The following afternoon, he is a member of the New York 
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
"When he signed that contract, I think all of us had a funny feeling about 
this," said Doug Harrison, Whitson's longtime buddy from Erwin, Tenn. "I think 
Eddie had that same kind of feeling, too. But when Steinbrenner made that offer 
to him, I remember him telling me that he came home, looked at his wife and 
little girl and said, 'I'm crazy not to go.' 
</P>
<P>
"He told me, 'I don't like New York. I really don't want to play for New York. 
But I can't pass up that security. I've got to do it for my family." 
</P>
<P>
Virtually every decision Eddie Lee Whitson has made in his 34-year-old life has 
been based on his family. His father left a wife and nine kids to fend for 
themselves when Eddie was 7, and he has been working to help support the family 
ever since. 
</P>
<P>
There's Bradford, Buford, Eugene, Dennis, Martha, Trula, Randy and Susan, and 
in one way or another, Eddie has helped every one of them. Then, of course, 
there was Eddie's mama, Anna Mae, the backbone of the family. When she died of 
cancer eight years ago, the whole town of Erwin mourned. 
</P>
<P>
"She was about the nicest person you'll ever want to meet in this whole wide 
world," Harrison said. "She was this black-haired, rotund woman. She was not 
real fat, just rotund. She laughed all of the time and made you feel good about 
yourself. When she died, not only did the family take it hard, but so did 
everybody else around these parts." 
</P>
<P>
Everybody is family around here. Why, there was the time Harrison scheduled his 
wedding during the 1980 All-Star break just so Eddie could be the best man. 
Wouldn't you know it? That had to be the year Eddie made the All-Star team with 
the San Francisco Giants. Whitson told his buddy about the news and even 
offered to back out, but Harrison would hear none of it. 
</P>
<P>
The wedding went on as planned, but, boy, you should have seen the hullabaloo 
at the reception. The men had snuck in a small black-and-white TV set, propped 
it on a table in the corner of the room, and you can imagine just how the women 
were reacting 
</P>
<P>
"People in town are still talking about it," said Randy Whitson, Ed's youngest 
brother. "His wife was yelling, 'We don't want to watch the All-Star game.' He 
was yelling back, 'Well, we do.' They had just got married, and they were 
already arguing. 
</P>
<P>
"But there we sat watching that little television set. I think the only time he 
(Harrison) moved was when they cut the cake, and then he was right back as soon 
as he swallowed it." 
</P>
<P>
The news story flashed across the sports pages of the Johnson City Press, and 
the folks of Erwin were plenty scared. 
</P>
<P>
They read all about Whitson and Manager Billy Martin's vicious barroom brawl in 
the wee hours of the morning of Sept. 22, 1985, and when Martin came away with 
a broken arm, they cringed at the thought of the impending reaction in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
The fight started in a hotel bar in Baltimore, went into the lobby, carried 
into the parking lot and concluded on the fourth floor of their hotel. It 
remains in Yankee folklore as one of the best knock-down-drag-out fights in 
team history. 
</P>
<P>
Whitson, who already had been receiving death threats at his home and in the 
clubhouse because of his 1-6 start, was terrified over what Yankee fans would 
now do to him. He already was taking every necessary precaution for his family, 
sending them home to Ohio one day before every trip and having them return one 
day after he returned, but now he envisioned the worst. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Whitson, who had been laid off from work at the nuclear plant back in 
Tennessee for 11 1/2 months and was struggling just to put food on the table, 
telephoned Eddie the moment he put down the paper. They must have talked for 
hours, he said, but it was of no use. He had never heard Eddie sound so 
depressed in all his life. 
</P>
<P>
"I was having problems at the time, plenty of 'em," Randy Whitson said, "but 
mine weren't . . . compared to Eddie's. To tell you the truth, I was scared for 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Randy and Harrison talked it over, and by that afternoon, Harrison was taking a 
flight from the Tri-City Airport to New York City. 
</P>
<P>
"All I tried to do was take his mind off it as much as I could," Harrison said, 
"but he was pretty miserable. I told him, 'Look how far you've gotten in life. 
Come on, don't let something like this stop you.' 
</P>
<P>
"I reminded him that he's his own person, and there hasn't been a Whitson that 
I've met yet who isn't tougher than nails. I remember growing up, you could be 
walking around town feeling kind of tough, and then all of a sudden you'd have 
some rocks coming out of nowhere at you. Right away you knew that was one of 
the Whitson boys from Rock Creek." 
</P>
<P>
New York is a long way from Rock Creek, though, and the way of life in the Big 
Apple was something that Whitson never had experienced -- and, he vows, he 
never again will. Whitson's life style is unornamental and direct, stripped 
down to the bare essentials, ill-suited for the big city's menace. 
</P>
<P>
Whitson said he could have tolerated the boos night after night. Maybe he could 
have even overlooked the tacks and nails from irate fans that littered his 
driveway on occasion. But those threats. Those ugly phone calls. He could not 
take any more. 
</P>
<P>
"We had guys, FBI agents, in our locker room, in the tunnel and in the dugout," 
Whitson said. "Lord knows the game of baseball is big business, but it wasn't 
worth risking your life over. 
</P>
<P>
"I was struggling, and I could understand why people were upset, but I refused 
to take my life in my own hands every time I went out there." 
</P>
<P>
Whitson's emotions were in such disarray that Lou Piniella, who became the 
Yankee manager in 1986, had to completely juggle his pitching staff. Whitson 
would start only in road games; he'd pitch at Yankee Stadium strictly in 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
"Even then, it didn't do any good," Piniella said. "When he walked to the 
bullpen, he wouldn't even walk across the field. He always walked under the 
stands. 
</P>
<P>
"He just became useless here. Even when I called for him in the bullpen, he'd 
get real fidgety. He was worrying about everything except getting batters out. 
</P>
<P>
"He got off to a bad start with the fans anyway because he was struggling, and 
then when they found out they were getting to him, it just snowballed. And once 
he had the problem with Billy Martin, well, what can I say, he became a basket 
case." 
</P>
<P>
Whitson, with no other recourse, turned to Steinbrenner. He asked out. Trade 
me, he pleaded, please trade me. 
</P>
<P>
"When I signed Ed," Steinbrenner said, "I promised him that if things don't 
work out, I'd do my damnedest to send him to where he wanted. I knew what he 
was going through. He had problems with Billy Martin, but lots of guys here 
have had problems with Billy. But all of the other things he was going through, 
I couldn't keep him here. You don't do those things to people. 
</P>
<P>
"I know things didn't work out here for Ed, but never once did he complain. He 
took a lot of b.s. from a lot of people, and he took his share of slings and 
arrows of misfortune, believe me. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll always respect Ed because he was a real man. He never whimpered to me or 
made excuses like a lot of these guys do nowadays. He took it all without 
saying a word. 
</P>
<P>
"I know we didn't get what we should have in return for Ed, but he's a 
tremendous person. Whatever good things come to him in this game he deserves." 
</P>
<P>
Said Whitson: "A lot of people thought George Steinbrenner was a bad man, but 
I'll tell you right now, I'll respect him to the day. He's as honest as any man 
I've ever met." 
</P>
<P>
The way Whitson has it figured, he was born and raised in the hills of 
Tennessee but grew up in New York. He arrived there a thrower and left a 
pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned about life there, maybe more than I ever cared to know," Whitson 
said. "But I do know it's helped me. I've learned to deal with certain 
situations, and really, it's helped me on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
"I know how to handle things now, where as before, if I gave up a homer or 
something like that, I'd just lose it. I mean, if I gave up a homer, you could 
have been as assured as I'm sitting here that I'd be out of the game in two 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't get me wrong, I still get flustered when I leave a game, and I'll get my 
tail feathers ruffled, but I won't dwell on it and let it ruin my next start. 
And Lord knows that's what happened in New York, I just tried to do more than I 
was capable of." 
</P>
<P>
This is why Whitson believes that he's pitching better now than at any time in 
his life, and if there are any doubts, check out his 21-12 record since June 3, 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the thing that hurt him so much in New York," Piniella said. "He'd be 
cruising along for four or five innings, throwing 91, 92 m.p.h., and suddenly 
give up a bloop single, or we'd make an error. And then he'd just lose it. He'd 
start throwing in the mid-80s, and before I had a chance to get anyone in 
there, he was getting rocked. 
</P>
<P>
"From what I can tell, he's a whole different pitcher than he was here. Going 
back to San Diego was the best thing that could have ever happened to him." 
</P>
<P>
Whitson's teammates, curious to see how he had changed since leaving for New 
York, were surprised, and almost astonished, to see that he returned his same 
old easy-going self in July of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"We had heard all of the horror stories," outfielder Tony Gwynn said, "and 
about people chasing him out of the ballpark, and everything else. But as soon 
as he walked through the clubhouse door, I knew that he was the same guy that 
left here. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never forget that moment when he walked though the door. He just grinned 
from ear to ear, and he looked like the happiest guy in the world. His face 
said it all." 
</P>
<P>
Oh, it was not easy when Whitson returned. His confidence was so shot that he 
went 1-7 with a 5.59 ERA and was 10-13 in 1987, failing to win a game after 
July 31. Slowly, his confidence began mending. He won 10 of his last 16 
decisions of 1988 and now firmly believes that he has never pitched better in 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got New York to thank, every one of those fans," said Whitson, his face 
breaking into an expansive grin. "Every day I worked out over the winter, I 
kept thinking about them, because I want to prove every damn one of them wrong. 
They thought I wouldn't be back. They thought I was washed up. 
</P>
<P>
"Now look at me."

<P>
The years come and go for Ivan Lendl in his personal purgatory, where he walks 
off the court after every loss and thinks, gosh, that grass has just got to be 
greener next time. 
</P>
<P>
And this may be the year that a raining champion is crowned at Wimbledon. 
Showers washed out the women's final Saturday, so Steffi Graf and Martina 
Navratilova have to wait another day. 
</P>
<P>
Those imaginary dark clouds that have followed Lendl around the hallowed 
grounds of Wimbledon cast an eerie shadow over him once again. 
</P>
<P>
For the 10th time in 10 trips to Wimbledon, Lendl left knowing that he has to 
wait until next year for another shot at winning the only Grand Slam title that 
has eluded him. 
</P>
<P>
With the strength of a powerful backhand, Boris Becker propelled himself into 
the men's singles final on a gloomy Saturday afternoon, and in four hours one 
minute, he ended Lendl's quest for the championship he covets most. 
</P>
<P>
Becker, given time to regroup from a one-set deficit during a one-hour 
16-minute rain delay, came back to beat Lendl in their semifinal showdown, 7-5, 
6-7 (7-2), 2-6, 6-4, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Now, weather permiting, Becker will play Stefan Edberg today in a rematch of 
last year's Wimbledon final, which Edberg won. 
</P>
<P>
Knowing that the final again would not include him, did not make Lendl feel 
very good. 
</P>
<P>
Passing in front of the Princess of Wales as he left the court, Lendl did not 
break stride to nod his head in the direction of the Royal Box, leaving Becker 
to walk off alone. 
</P>
<P>
Becker was sympathetic toward the breach of etiquette by his longtime rival 
whom he defeated here in last year's semifinals, as well as in the 1986 final. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, it was a difficult moment for him, and I didn't want to be in his 
position right now." 
</P>
<P>
Lendl's mood was as grim as the sky, the color of a bathtub ring. When he 
answered questions in a postmatch press conference, his disposition had not 
improved much. 
</P>
<P>
Question: Is this one of the most disappointing losses? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: They are all disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How do you get over something like this? 
</P>
<P>
A: Time. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Do you replay the match a little bit? 
</P>
<P>
A: No, don't worry about it. 
</P>
<P>
There are probably a few moments that Lendl will remember for a very long time. 
Rain turned out to be an unexpected adversary for him. 
</P>
<P>
Before the rain stopped play, Lendl led, 3-0, up two breaks in the third set. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just all over me," Becker said. "Then the rain came. That was 
definitely good for me. You know, I could settle down. I could think again and 
come back fresh." 
</P>
<P>
At the time it began raining, Lendl sensed that Becker's game was in disarray. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt he was shattered at the time when we went off the court," Lendl said. 
"I had a feeling he didn't know what to do at that moment . . . and he came 
back and started playing better." 
</P>
<P>
Lendl's last moment came early in the fourth set. He went up a break to 3-2 
when Becker double-faulted at break point. 
</P>
<P>
But then Lendl gave it right back with his own double fault at break point, and 
the set was on serve again at 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
"If I held serve there, I felt I would be pretty much in the driving seat," 
Lendl said. 
</P>
<P>
Becker also realized that momentum was on the verge of shifting in Lendl's 
favor. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I have to break or I'm going to be out of these championships in 
another 15 minutes," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
Serving at 4-5, the match slid away from Lendl even more, given a slight nudge 
by a couple of unhelpful actions by chair umpire Paulo Pereira, who replayed 
points after overruling service line calls. 
</P>
<P>
When Lendl double-faulted to 15-40, Becker held two set points. But Lendl 
fought back to deuce twice before Becker earned a third set point with a 
brilliant down-the-line backhand return of a second serve. 
</P>
<P>
At 4:51 p.m., after 3 hours 23 minutes of tennis, Lendl dumped his first volley 
into the net off Becker's service return. In that one moment, the fourth set 
was over, the match was dead even and the fifth set was to begin. 
</P>
<P>
For Becker the margin of victory was a single service break he collected off 
Lendl in the fourth game. Lendl double-faulted for the seventh and last time at 
break point, and Becker led, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl couldn't find another spot to pull even. Kept off balance by the power 
and accuracy of Becker's withering backhand, Lendl eventually trailed, 5-2, but 
held serve to stay in the match. 
</P>
<P>
Then, when Becker blasted his 17th ace straight down the middle of the court, 
the message for Lendl was clear. This wouldn't be his year at Wimbledon either. 
</P>
<P>
A service winner pushed Becker to 40-0, and when he struck a forehand 
crosscourt for another winner, the match was over. 
</P>
<P>
Wimbledon, a fickle companion, spurned its most ardent suitor once again. Next 
year, Lendl will come back and hope things turn out differently. He is even 
thinking about skipping the French Open to better prepare for another assault 
on his battlefield of grass. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very disappointed because I thought I played well and I thought I had a 
good chance," Lendl said. "I just wish I had won. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not going to roll over and not try again, so it's going to be hard for 
awhile, but I'm sure I'll get over it." 
</P>
<P>
No matter how many times he leaves Wimbledon in defeat, Lendl said he will 
remain optimistic. He won't come back to the grass courts next year riding a 
backhoe. 
</P>
<P>
Why should he? After all, fate isn't really conspiring against him here, is it? 
</P>
<P>
"You have to play well, you have to stay healthy and you need a little bit of 
luck," Lendl said. "Then that is what you need to win. I would always like to 
think it evens out sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
Boris Becker leads his series with Stefan Edberg, 10-7, but he has lost three 
of their last five meetings. Edberg beat Becker in the semifinals at the French 
Open. They are 1-1 on grass. . . . For what it's worth: In the 17 previous 
Becker-Edberg matches, the winner of the first set has gone on to win 16 times. 
Edberg is 34-6 this year and Becker 39-5. Edberg is 25-5 in seven years at 
Wimbledon and Becker is 29-3 in six years. . . . Rick Leach and Jim Pugh play 
John Fitzgerald of Australia and Anders Jarryd of Sweden in the men's doubles 
final today. Fitzgerald and Jarryd completed a rain-delayed semifinal win over 
U. S. Davis Cuppers Ken Flach and Robert Seguso, 4-6, 6-2, 6-2, 6-3. . . . 
Today's tickets will be good for both the men's and women's finals, as well as 
the other matches.

MOUNTAIN STAGES COULD PROVE TO BE LEMOND'S DOWNFALL IN TOUR DE FRANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

As the Tour de France ended it's seventh stage Saturday in Bordeaux, American 
Greg LeMond maintained his five-second overall edge over France's Laurent 
Fignon -- along with the bicycle race leader's coveted yellow jersey. His main 
concern now is how long he can continue to wear it. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond is coming off of what would normally be considered a disappointing year. 
In his first full racing season since 1986, he has not won a major race. The 
Tour of Italy appeared to be another disappointment, but an especially strong 
finish in the final time trial provided a hint of what was to come. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the Tour of Italy finish) gave me confidence that I could at least do 
something in France, maybe win a stage or something," LeMond said. "It gave a 
hope, a possibility of doing well." 
</P>
<P>
Monday, the race will enter the Pyrenees in what will be the first of seven 
mountain stages. Mountain climbing is where Fignon is considered particularly 
strong. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond is taking a cautious line on this portion of the race. "I feel strong 
and I'm waiting to see," he said, "but it's impossible to tell. I haven't been 
in such good form for a long time, I have nothing to judge myself on." 
</P>
<P>
One factor that may work to LeMond's advantage is the similarity of this year's 
race to the one in 1986, when LeMond became the first and only American to win 
the Tour. 
</P>
<P>
"This year's race is about the same as when I won in '86," he said. "It's 
always difficult. The winner is the strongest rider in the world. The mountains 
don't matter." 
</P>
<P>
Having Fignon five seconds behind him doesn't seem to bother LeMond, but he is 
definitely respectful of Fignon's ability. LeMond still considers Fignon the 
favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Assessing his current condition, LeMond said: "I feel real strong, but I'm 
tired mentally. The last three days have been full of non-stop demands, and 
it's taking its toll. Right now, the most important thing is recuperation. Six 
weeks ago, I was having a difficult time in the Tour of Italy, but I attribute 
it (his lead in the Tour de France) to training and dedication. I came in as a 
hopeful to be a top-20 finisher. I'm already satisfied; anything else is a 
bonus. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't win a race by surviving. You have to be capable of being an 
all-around rider, not just mentally tough. You have to be consistent. I always 
do well under pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Andy Hampsten is the other American contender in the Tour de France. Although 
Hampsten finished 94th in Saturday's stage, he was only four seconds behind the 
winner and remained in 14th place overall. 
</P>
<P>
Hampsten was noncommittal on the mountain stages, but takes a different 
approach to cycling than LeMond. 
</P>
<P>
"Things happen (in cycling)," he said. "Bike racing is designed to give people 
problems. If I go too hard one day, the next day I'll be in trouble. Racing is 
about survival." 
</P>
<P>
LeMond's position in the race has come as no surprise to Hampsten, who said: 
"He's riding where he should be, using the strength everyone knows he has."

Heading into the second week, Greg LeMond remains atop the Tour de France 
standings, but he doesn't think he can stay there much longer. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really think I will be able to hold on to the yellow jersey," he said 
after the seventh stage Saturday. "It's possible I'll lose it in the next few 
days. Perhaps Monday in the first stage in the mountains. I'll do my best. 
We'll see." 
</P>
<P>
LeMond has a five-second advantage over Laurent Fignon of France, the 1983 and 
1984 winner whom many regarded as the favorite before the Tour began on July 1 
in Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, few gave LeMond a chance. Although he won in 1986 -- to become 
the only American champion -- he missed the last two Tours due to injuries and 
a hunting mishap. 
</P>
<P>
In April 1987, he accidentally was shot by his brother-in-law and sprayed with 
shotgun pellets. He recovered slowly, and the following year he had an 
emergency appendectomy and knee and shin problems. 
</P>
<P>
So, when LeMond came in fourth in the prologue of the 23-day, 2,020-mile race, 
a lot of people cheered. 
</P>
<P>
Then, last Thursday, he won the individual time trial to vault into the lead. 
</P>
<P>
He stayed there over the past two days as he finished in the pack with most of 
the major rivals, while less dangerous racers took the sixth and seventh legs, 
the two longest of the Tour, both more than 160 miles. 
</P>
<P>
But LeMond admits he is tiring. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very tired. With the long stages I had to wake up at 6:30, and I don't 
get to sleep before midnight," he said. "Then you have to ride for more than 
150 miles, and following that, there are the reporters, the massages, 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
He has one benefit, though. "But I have one consolation . . . the yellow 
jersey," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's race was won by Belgium's Etienne de Wilde in 7 hours 21 minutes 45 
seconds. LeMond finished 22nd.

NEWSWIRE: NUGGET SALE TALKS IN PROGRESS -- $65 MILLION? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Denver Post reported that the Denver Nuggets have been sold to a group of 
Chicago investors for $65 million, but team owner Sidney Shlenker said 
negotiations are still in progress and no deal had yet been made. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still the owner so far," Shlenker said. "We are in conversation. I expect 
for something to be announced in the next few days. It's a little premature." 
</P>
<P>
Shlenker, who is shifting his business operations top Memphis, didn't identify 
the investors but said the Nuggets would remain in Denver.

The Cleveland Crunch expansion team selected a 24-year-old heart transplant 
recipient, Simon Keith, as the top pick in the first round of the Major Indoor 
Soccer League's college draft. 
</P>
<P>
Keith, of Victoria, Canada, was a forward for Nevada Las Vegas and has been 
playing in the Canadian Soccer League for the Victoria Vistas. He received a 
heart transplant in 1987 from a 17-year-old English soccer player who died of a 
cerebral brain clot during a match.

<P>
All-Snub Team: Here are some talented players who won't be in Anaheim Tuesday 
because they weren't selected for the All-Star team: First base -- Fred McGriff 
or Alvin Davis; Second base -- Rob Thompson or Bill Doran; Shortstop -- Ozzie 
Guillen; Third base -- Carney Lansford; Catcher -- Bob Boone; Outfield -- Ken 
Griffey Jr., Joe Carter, Brett Butler, Rob Deer, Paul O'Neill or Lonnie Smith; 
Pitchers -- Bert Blyleven, Kirk McCaskill, Dennis Martinez, Rick Sutcliffe, 
Jeff Ballard, Ed Whitson, Roger Clemens or Mike Schooler. 
</P>
<P>
Snub II: Reflecting on the failure of National League Manager Tom Lasorda to 
pick either Doran or Thompson as the second base reserve and the low position 
of Lasorda's Dodgers in the standings, the Houston Astros' Dave Smith told the 
Houston Chronicle: "Thank God that . . . won't be in a position to manage this 
team (the NL All-Stars) next year." 
</P>
<P>
Yankee Killer: Ted Higuera of the Milwaukee Brewers improved his career record 
against New York to 11-2 Monday night. Among pitchers who have 10 or more 
career victories against New York, Higuera's .846 win percentage is the highest 
in history. 
</P>
<P>
Power Outage: The Boston Red Sox, 53-28 at Fenway Park last year, are 20-21 
this year, having been out-homered, 35-18. In fact, the Red Sox have hit only 3 
homers in their last 17 home games. No wonder Manager Joe Morgan gazed out at 
the Green Monster in left field recently and said, "We don't even come close 
any more." 
</P>
<P>
AL Least: When the Yankees moved over the .500 mark Thursday night (they're now 
43-42), it was the first time any AL East team other than Baltimore had been 
over .500 since May 26. There have not been three AL East teams over .500 since 
May 13. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson &amp; Henderson: In his first 16 games as the Oakland Athletics 
leadoff hitter, Rickey Henderson is 25 for 61 (.410) with 10 walks, 19 runs and 
11 runs batted in. Dave Henderson, batting second, is headed in the other 
direction. D. Henderson has 17 hits in his last 101 at bats (.168) and 30 in 
his last 161 (.186). ROSS NEWHAN

TEUFEL DOES A LOT OF HITTING DURING AN 8-3 VICTORY OVER REDS

Tim Teufel, who had four hits in four at-bats to help the Mets rout the 
Cincinnati Reds, 8-3, Saturday in New York, batted only .500 during a brawl in 
the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
With the Mets holding a 7-0 lead, controversial reliever Rob Dibble, hit Teufel 
in the back. Teufel charged the mound and landed a punch that cut the pitcher's 
lip but missed with another swing. 
</P>
<P>
Both benches emptied. After order was restored, Teufel charged out for more, 
and the benches emptied again. This time it was mostly wrestling. Dibble, 
Teufel, the Mets' Juan Samuel and the Reds' Norm Charlton were ejected. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, Charlton telephoned the Mets' clubhouse, asking for Samuel. 
Darryl Strawberry, who hit a two-run homer, answered the phone and invited 
Charlton to the clubhouse. Charlton, Tom Browning and Danny Jackson started to 
go but were restrained by five security guards. 
</P>
<P>
Dibble has been in trouble before. He was fined for hitting the Dodgers' Willie 
Randolph and for throwing a bat against the backstop. 
</P>
<P>
Red Manager Pete Rose blamed Teufel for the brawl. "Nothing happened until 
Teufel charged the mound. Dibble wasn't kicked out for throwing at the batter." 
</P>
<P>
Rose was also upset because the Mets were stealing bases late in the game with 
a big lead. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just rubbing it in," Rose said. "(Met Manager) Davey Johnson and I are 
from the same school. If you're stealing at that point, you should expect to be 
knocked down. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want the opportunity to do it back, but we only get one more crack at 
the Mets. I've never rubbed it in, but maybe it's the trend. The Pirates did 
it, and the Dodgers, too." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson defended the base-stealing. "I don't believe in letting up," he said. 
"Six or seven runs isn't that much with their offense." 
</P>
<P>
The other Johnson, Howard, whom the Mets tried to trade all spring, had three 
hits, stole two bases and drove in two runs. DAN HAFNER

SEEMINGLY READY TO RETIRE, EVERT ADMITS SHE'S PAST HER PEAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WIMBLEDON, England 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the past six months, Chris Evert has been dropping hints, but the message 
she gave Thursday came through loud and clear. 
</P>
<P>
Evert, 34, said she is 90% sure there will be no more Wimbledons for her and 
indicated again that this year is probably her last. 
</P>
<P>
Four months ago, Evert lost to 15-year-old Monica Seles in the final of the 
Virginia Slims of Houston and that hastened her thoughts about retiring. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I'm thinking about retirement now," she said. "You know, this year. 
It's always been on my mind: When is the right time to stop? 
</P>
<P>
"You know, maybe I'm not willing to give 100% in every sense of the word, 
physically and mentally and emotionally like I used to. 
</P>
<P>
"If I don't do it and I start losing to players that I've never lost to before, 
then that's the right time." 
</P>
<P>
Evert, who lost to Steffi Graf in the Wimbledon semifinals, said she is 
undecided about playing the tournaments to which she is committed -- the 
Virginia Slims of Los Angeles is one of them. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I'm past my prime now, past my peak," Evert said. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Flink of World Tennis magazine, who has covered Evert since 1972, was 
surprised to hear such an admission. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never heard her say that before," Flink said. "She's always talked like 
there was a chance she could improve. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's any question that this is Chris' last year," Flink said. 
"I think she'll probably play the U.S. Open and that'll be it. It's probably 
100-1 she'll win the Open, but if she gets to the semifinals, I'm sure she'd be 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
If Evert does not play Wimbledon again, she will leave behind a record of 
making at least the semifinals 17 times in 18 years. The exception was in 1983 
when Kathy Jordan beat her in the third round. 
</P>
<P>
In Evert's last 55 Grand Slam events, she has made it at least as far as the 
semifinals 51 times. 
</P>
<P>
Does Ralph Kiner have British relatives? 
</P>
<P>
In the style of the New York Mets' broadcaster, who is famous for his bloopers, 
the BBC's Wimbledon announcers have put their tennis shoes in their mouths 
before. 
</P>
<P>
"There is Peter Graf, Steffi's father, with his head on his chin." 
</P>
<P>
 -- DAN MASKELL 
</P>
<P>
"She puts her head down and bangs it straight across the line." 
</P>
<P>
 -- ANN JONES 
</P>
<P>
"Diane keeps her head beautifully on her shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
 -- ANN JONES 
</P>
<P>
"That shot knocked the stuffing out of their sails." 
</P>
<P>
 -- FREW McMILLAN 
</P>
<P>
"They must take their minds off their games and think what tactics to employ 
next." 
</P>
<P>
 -- ANN JONES 
</P>
<P>
"We've had no more rain since it stopped raining." 
</P>
<P>
 -- HARRY CARPENTER 
</P>
<P>
"It looks as though the end is over." 
</P>
<P>
 -- DAN MASKELL 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper lead of the week, from the London tabloid the Sun: 
</P>
<P>
"Count Dracula saw off Batman on Wimbledon's Centre Court. 
</P>
<P>
"Sweden's caped crusader Ronnie Bathman (pronounced Batman) spilled some early 
blood by taking in the first set against the out-of-touch world No. 1 (Ivan 
Lendl). 
</P>
<P>
"But in the end, there was only bad news to relay back to Gotham City . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Boring quote of the week, from Sweden's Mats Wilander: 
</P>
<P>
"I think I am playing very well. I think I am playing better than before. You 
just get better. I think I am playing better than last year. I have to wait and 
see what's going to happen or something." 
</P>
<P>
Best quote of the week, from Kristine Radford. 
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old telephoned her mother in Australia to tell her she had won the 
first set against Martina Navratilova in a match suspended by darkness: 
</P>
<P>
"Mum was over the moon." 
</P>
<P>
Money talks (louder): Prize money for the champion in men's singles is nearly 
100 times more than it was 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The men's singles winner will receive 190,000 British pounds, which is about 
$304,000. 
</P>
<P>
In 1968, the first year of the open era, Rod Laver won 2,000 pounds, or about 
$3,200. 
</P>
<P>
Only 10 years go, the prize money for Bjorn Borg was 20,000 pounds, or $32,000. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Chamberlin, Dan Goldie and the others who reached the quarterfinals this 
year won $38,504 apiece.

WIMBLEDON SINGLES FINALISTS HAVE THEIR SPECIAL LITTLE WAITING ROOM

The room is eight feet square. Five wicker chairs are arranged against one 
wall, and near the door are a desk and chair. 
</P>
<P>
In the corridor outside, a single blue light shines when there is royalty in 
the stands just above. 
</P>
<P>
The next two Wimbledon champions will emerge from this tiny waiting room, 
directly beneath the Royal Box at the south end of Centre Court, and walk out 
onto the most famous grass court in tennis to meet their destiny. 
</P>
<P>
For a player, this room is a final sanctuary before he is surrounded by the 
tumult outside. 
</P>
<P>
There are two television sets to follow the tennis action. Only two pictures 
are in the room. 
</P>
<P>
In one of them, the one on the far wall, Maureen Connolly is holding the 
women's singles trophy she won three consecutive times, in 1953-1955. 
</P>
<P>
The other picture is a sketch of John McEnroe and Bjorn Borg waiting to play 
one of their finals. 
</P>
<P>
In the drawing, McEnroe and Borg are talking to each other, which is purely an 
artistic device because there is no conversation in here. 
</P>
<P>
The players are escorted from their dressing room to the waiting room. They 
follow a traditional path: Out the main entrance of the All England Club, up 
seven carpeted steps, through a set of swinging doors and inside. 
</P>
<P>
Over the doorway through which the players pass from the waiting room to Centre 
Court is a quotation from Rudyard Kipling: 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can meet with triumph and disaster 
</P>
<P>
 "And treat those two impostors just the same."

THE NBA HASN'T CHANGED MORLON WILEY; 
</P>
<P>
EX-CAL STATE LONG BEACH CAGER KEEPS PERSPECTIVE, EVEN THE SAME CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At 8 a.m., invading a Belmont Shore beach occupied only by a tractor, Morlon 
Wiley raced through deep sand with the enthusiasm that defines him. In seconds, 
he became a speck on the gray horizon. 
</P>
<P>
Returning to the parking lot after that workout last Saturday, Wiley, 22, 
entered not a luxury car befitting a pro basketball player but a 1966 
Volkswagen black bug he has owned since he was a sophomore at Cal State Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually," he answered with his easy smile when asked if a Mercedes-Benz is 
in his future. Typically, he added, "I'll get my mom one first." 
</P>
<P>
He always credited her with keeping him humble. 
</P>
<P>
Wiley, who as a senior led the 49ers to a 17-12 season record and a National 
Invitation Tournament appearance two years ago, was a 6-foot-4 rookie guard for 
the Dallas Mavericks of the NBA last season. 
</P>
<P>
Unprotected by Dallas in the recent expansion draft, he was selected by the 
Orlando Magic and signed with that new team last week. His agent, Leonard 
Armato of Los Angeles, was pushing for a guaranteed contract calling for 
"significantly more" than the $100,000 Wiley made last season. 
</P>
<P>
For the summer, Wiley has returned to the town in which he grew up, staying in 
a campus dormitory to be near the gym and weightlifting room, and helping 49er 
Coach Joe Harrington conduct clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Although he played an average of only eight minutes in 51 games with Dallas, 
Wiley impressed Mavericks Coach John MacLeod, especially as a person. 
</P>
<P>
"A great young man, a breath of fresh air," MacLeod said by telephone from 
Dallas. "We hated to lose him, we really wanted to keep him. I think he'll be a 
very good player. He has confidence in his ability, is respectful of others and 
is one hellacious competitor." 
</P>
<P>
The first draft pick (second round) of the Mavericks in 1988, Wiley was on a 
team with three established guards -- Rolando Blackman, Derek Harper and Brad 
Davis -- so the recognition he resolutely sought did not come easily. Although 
fans might recognize him in a Dallas mall, his national TV time was minimal and 
Lakers broadcaster Chick Hearn called him Morton Wiley. 
</P>
<P>
"I showed a lot of enthusiasm," Wiley said, wearing a sweat suit with a 
Mavericks logo during a break in his morning run-lift-shoot routine. "I let 
people know I wanted to be there. I'd have to humble myself and do what I 
could. I would sometimes get in a game with only 20 seconds left, but I would 
think, 'I might get a steal or a rebound.' " 
</P>
<P>
A quick, defensive-oriented player, Wiley had to work hard just to make the 
team. On the advice of his brother, Michael, a former NBA player, he did not 
look at newspapers when he was trying out so he would not have to read that he 
might be cut. What his mother, Geraldine, had to say was also held dear. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom said to remember that whatever happened her love was still going to be 
there," Wiley said. "That got me over the hump. I knew I had nothing to lose. I 
saw myself playing in the league; it was just a matter of getting my chance." 
</P>
<P>
His first year as a pro was similar to his junior year at Long Beach Poly High 
School, when he played little but was named the most spirited team member. Last 
season, he again sat on the bench and cheered, staying ready, waiting his turn. 
</P>
<P>
"My attitude was great the whole time," said Wiley, who would arrive hours 
early for home games, dressed in practice clothes. "I'd get my workout in 
regardless of whether I played or not." 
</P>
<P>
On the road, besides acquiring tastes for good restaurants and various 
cuisines, he became familiar with the health clubs and local gyms, spending 
long hours in them. He became a frequent writer of letters, and sent a touching 
one to the Cal State Long Beach coaches. "It was such a great letter to get," 
Harrington said. "Here's a guy who made it to the big time and he took the time 
to remember where he came from and say thank you." 
</P>
<P>
Wiley's character made an impact on the big names of his sport. 
</P>
<P>
"People are the same, human beings," he said. "They treat you with utmost 
respect if you're a good person. The superstars would talk to me -- Magic 
Johnson and Kareem (Abdul-Jabbar) would tell me what I was doing wrong, Kevin 
Johnson (of Phoenix) would take me out to dinner, Mark Aguirre gave me four or 
five suits. They appreciated a young guy who worked hard. I looked at them as 
regular people, not as superstars, and they respected me for that." 
</P>
<P>
He loves the pro life -- "red carpet all the way, the best hotels" -- but has 
seen that it invites abuse by young men with wealth and idle time. "Some guys 
can't handle it," he said. "I live a basic life, one without a lot of risks. I 
don't do drugs or drink, I have good clean fun, going to dinner, spreading my 
name around." 
</P>
<P>
Among those who befriended Wiley was teammate Roy Tarpley, who entered a drug 
rehabilitation center during the season. "He took me in when I got there, he 
was very supportive," Wiley said, adding that Tarpley never drank or used drugs 
in his presence. 
</P>
<P>
In appreciation, Wiley bought Tarpley a pool table. 
</P>
<P>
"It was unfortunate he slipped," Wiley said. "I just pray for him." 
</P>
<P>
Money has not become an obsession with the young man who was raised in Long 
Beach's inner city. "Adrian Dantley told me it's not how much you make, it's 
how much you keep," Wiley said, referring to the forward who moved to Dallas in 
a trade with Detroit. "That stuck with me. I saved quite a bit." 
</P>
<P>
"People say I'm cheap," he went on with a laugh. "I'd rather see my mom have 
it. She raised five kids, and hasn't asked me for a cent." 
</P>
<P>
The last season was one he will not soon forget. He lived on his own for the 
first time, accepting the responsibilities brought by bills and dirty dishes; 
he saw how a team was affected by a major trade (Aguirre for Dantley) and by 
drugs, and felt the pressure of a fight, which turned out unsuccessful, to make 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"Rolando Blackman told me that it was good I saw all that because now nothing 
should faze me." 
</P>
<P>
Wiley is proud that he has broadened what he calls his level of awareness. "I 
was doing things (in college) the same way all the time -- always eating pizza, 
going to the same gym, because I didn't know better. Now I'm not afraid to take 
a chance. I want to see different things, I want to grow." 
</P>
<P>
He regrets leaving Dallas and MacLeod. "He would talk to me all the time," 
Wiley said of his former coach. "He'd come over at dinner and we'd talk about 
basketball and life. I'll miss the talks we had. But he made a decision to play 
certain guys and stuck with it. I didn't want to leave but change is 
inevitable, something you accept." 
</P>
<P>
Wiley is optimistic about his chances with Orlando, where his back-court 
competition will include veterans Reggie Theus, Scott Skiles and Sam Vincent. 
"If I keep a level head and work hard, it shouldn't be a problem at all," he 
said. "I just have to keep the foot on the pedal. The sky's the limit."

Bob Weiss, a Dallas broadcaster last season and now an assistant coach with the 
Magic, said Wiley, who averaged 20 points in his last season at Cal State Long 
Beach, "never got his offensive game going" with the Mavericks. "Although 
everyone's high on him, we don't really know for sure about him," Weiss said. 
"We're anxious to get him in our summer camp." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, as Wiley drank a soft drink in a campus deli where the employees 
wondered if he was someone famous, he seemed anxious to get back to the life he 
has fallen in love with. 
</P>
<P>
He talked about someday returning to school to acquire the additional credits 
needed for his degree, but that will have to wait. What he has now, he said, a 
basketball under his arm, is "the best job in the world."

A FRESH TWIST IN THE ROAD;

<P>
FOR NOVELIST RICHARD YATES, A SPECIALIST IN GRIM IRONY, LATE FAME'S A WICKED 
RETURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was the kind of propitious beginning that most young writers can only dream 
about, and, by all counts, it should have signaled a career of celebrity and 
honors. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Yates was 36 years old and his first novel, "Revolutionary Road," 
published in 1961, had garnered not the elliptical adjectives that constitute 
the usual dust-jacket blurbs, but whole sentences, an entire trumpeting 
paragraph, from no less than the country's pre-eminent living playwright, 
Tennessee Williams: 
</P>
<P>
"Here is more than fine writing; here is what, added to fine writing, makes a 
book come immediately, intensely, and brilliantly alive. If more is needed to 
make a masterpiece in modern American fiction, I am sure I don't know what it 
is." Since then, a veritable Who's Who of writers has jumped in with ebullient 
praise for Yates' literary prowess. Kurt Vonnegut has called "Revolutionary 
Road" " 'The Great Gatsby' of my time." Critic James Atlas declares it's "one 
of the few novels I know that could be called flawless." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Praise From Styron, Updike 
</P>
<P>
Then there are William Styron, John Updike, Anne Beattie, Robert Stone -- all 
sounding their admiration for his impeccably crafted prose. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, he has been championed for three decades by Seymour Lawrence, one of 
the literary Establishment's most respected publishers. 
</P>
<P>
So it seems almost a case of fatal defiance that Yates has managed to slip past 
the footlights, remaining unknown not only to the masses of popular-novel 
readers but to most literate book lovers as well. 
</P>
<P>
His novels have never become big sellers, with 12,000 copies tops for any one 
book. But, more, his spartan existence and his lifelong battle with the whiskey 
bottle have done nothing to make him into the sort of faddish idol a 
well-scrubbed yuppie could adore. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, his current recognition has been all the more startling -- an event 
worthy of the author's hallmark irony. Photographed by his friend Jill 
Krementz, he stares out soulfully from his writer's tweeds in the current issue 
of the ultimate celebrity magazine, Fame -- the one with Donald Trump on the 
cover. 
</P>
<P>
Yates calls the appearance "embarrassing." After all, he rarely has a spare 
dime, lives without a car and has weathered much of adult life without a 
television set. Such cynosures of the decade's taste as "Lifestyles of the Rich 
and Famous" passed by without his notice. 
</P>
<P>
Living in Los Angeles, where he is teaching creative writing at the University 
of Southern California and working on his 10th book of fiction, he holes up in 
an unadorned apartment where the rented sofa, easy chair, table and lamp form a 
perfunctory living-room setting. Facing a bare white wall is the square table 
on which the author writes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suffers From Emphysema 
</P>
<P>
The principal artifacts are the cigarette butts that fill the ashtrays (despite 
the fact that Yates suffers from emphysema and lost a lung to an earlier bout 
with tuberculosis) and clusters of yellow pencils, which he uses to write his 
manuscript (even the old manual Royal on which he later types his pages goes 
too fast to allow him control). 
</P>
<P>
Three portraits of his daughters, nailed to the wall with exacting symmetry, 
are the only objects that identify the place as home. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it is in this anonymous room that Yates is enjoying new discovery. 
"Revolutionary Road," along with his 1976 novel, "The Easter Parade," and the 
collection of short stories, "Eleven Kinds of Loneliness" (1962), currently are 
being reissued, after all of his titles had drifted out of print. Just the week 
before, Esquire magazine bought two chapters of his book in progress. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shot in the arm," he says of the sale. Sitting in a neighborhood bistro 
in West Los Angeles, Yates, 63, is smiling like any successful novelist, 
declaring: "I am delighted to be interviewed." 
</P>
<P>
A tall, gaunt man who speaks in a deep, graveled voice, Yates generally is not 
prone to such unqualified cheerfulness. His head, which he often anchors on a 
fist, swings back and forth as he talks in an unconscious gesture of 
negativity. When friends speak of him, they describe a person of moral, almost 
puritanical, rectitude, a perfectionist quick to correct errors, a proverbial 
"gentleman from the old school." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'People Shy Away' 
</P>
<P>
"He has values of integrity that are lost in today's glitz and yuppiness, and 
you pay for that," says Lawrence, who publishes his imprint at Houghton 
Mifflin. "People shy away from him because he tells the truth." 
</P>
<P>
The truth Yates tells in his books is of unremarkable middle-class Americans 
trapped in dreary lives that they nevertheless often confront with courage. In 
"Revolutionary Road," Yates depicts a disintegrating suburban marriage; his 
earnest heroine, April Wheeler, who longs for a world of "marvelous golden 
people," holds on to a husband whom one reviewer has described as "a kind of 
repellent Walter Mitty." But, true to form for Yates' principal characters, 
Wheeler is unable to fulfill her aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
Nor are Yates' other books optimistic. "The Easter Parade" opens with the 
passage, "Neither of the Grimes sisters would have a happy life . . ." and only 
on the book's final page does Emily Grimes seem to fall into step with the 
mainstream. In "Eleven Kinds of Loneliness," Yates' short stories portray 
devastating moments of unwanted solitude. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Gray, Deathly World' 
</P>
<P>
Just how dim a picture he gives of everyday life is a matter of critical 
opinion. Writing in Nation, Joyce Carol Oates has called Yates' fictional 
universe "a sad, gray, deathly world." 
</P>
<P>
Critic and novelist Carolyn See, who has reviewed two of Yates' books, wrote 
eight years ago: "He's not going to get the recognition he truly deserves 
because to read Yates is as painful as getting all your teeth filled down to 
the gum with no anesthetic. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
So it's little wonder that when asked about "Revolutionary Road," the author 
himself fires off, "You found it depressing, didn't you?" 
</P>
<P>
Everybody does -- or almost. 
</P>
<P>
Yates supporter William Styron takes exception to that evaluation. "You don't 
use the word depressing as a criterion for the excellence of a book," Styron 
declares. "A lot of remarkable books that we all value very highly are 
depressing. And I didn't find it depressing; it rises above that." 
</P>
<P>
"I hope he gets more attention," adds Styron, who contributed the cover blurb 
for the new edition of "Revolutionary Road": "A deft, ironic, beautiful novel 
that deserves to be a classic." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Downbeat Look at Life 
</P>
<P>
Still, Lawrence, who advanced Yates $1,500 to write "Revolutionary Road," 
thinks that his downbeat look at life has impeded commercial success. "His 
books are grim portrayals of life in America. People want to be cheered up and 
entertained." 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very angsted novelist," his old friend Vonnegut says; besides, he 
points out, Yates writes about people who are "third-rate financially" and "the 
Harvard Business School people want winners." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Yates' buddies have repeatedly tried to heave him up before the 
crowds. Four of his books were chosen as Book of the Month Club selections, 
sent to as many as half-a-million households. "We tried everything at 
Delacorte," says Lawrence, who formerly had his imprint there, "but we never 
could reach a huge audience." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Vonnegut has proposed Yates three times for membership in the 
American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, with backing by Styron and 
John Updike. But, he says, even the nation's lauded artists and musicians are 
not necessarily familiar with Richard Yates. 
</P>
<P>
To a large degree, Yates' work reflects his life, neither of which have been 
particularly easy for him to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
"He's had a hard life," says Vonnegut, who's known the author since the '60s 
when they taught together at the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop. He feels 
hampered by both health and money problems, Vonnegut says. 
</P>
<P>
Yates adds to the list of hardships his two divorces. ("Anyway, I've got the 
three daughters, so it can't all be wreckage.") 
</P>
<P>
He's been on the wagon for two years, though, he says, "I was much more affable 
when I was drinking. Now I'm sort of shrunk into myself from the effort to keep 
from drinking." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Honesty and Irony 
</P>
<P>
Yates talks about his life with a combination of almost bone-crushing honesty 
and his brand of cool, distanced irony. The son of a sales manager in the Mazda 
lamp division of General Electric, he grew up in New York. His parents were 
divorced when he was 3 years old. When asked if his childhood was happy, he 
says: "Most people looking back believe their childhood was more poignant than 
anyone else's. So I won't compete with anyone for the poignancy prize. My 
parents were decent people. My childhood was OK." 
</P>
<P>
Eager to start writing, he skipped college (as did Mark Twain and Ernest 
Hemingway, he points out) and wound up making a living as a free-lance public 
relations writer. 
</P>
<P>
Since then he has paid his bills by teaching creative writing variously at 
Iowa, Columbia University, and briefly at Harvard Extension and Boston 
University. 
</P>
<P>
"The business of teaching creative writing offers solace to writers who are 
down on their luck," he says with deadpan humor, quoting Vonnegut. 
</P>
<P>
When he talks shop, however, Yates' relationship with writers and characters in 
his novels becomes immediate. April Wheeler, for instance, is "the one who 
takes your heart and throws it someplace else. She puts her heart into 
everything. She even put her heart into that silly marriage. I like her 
enormously. I think she's a wonderful girl. If she were real, I'd find her 
irresistible." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'My Best Book' 
</P>
<P>
" 'Revolutionary Road' remains my best book without question," he adds. "I'm 
one of these writers who has the misfortune to write his best book first." 
</P>
<P>
It's such a sense of the sad that often gets Yates compared to F. Scott 
Fitzgerald. "I derive from him more than anyone," says Yates, who discovered 
his works in the '40s. "When I was young, he had a false reputation as a 
popular writer of little substance with one first-class book to his credit." It 
took a lot of effort by great explicators, like Edmund Wilson and Malcolm 
Cowley, he says, to put Fitzgerald on literature's big-hit charts for the 
duration. 
</P>
<P>
There are other similarities between the two authors, Vonnegut says, pointing 
out that they look alike and that Fitzgerald had tuberculosis; but mainly there 
was the same turn of mind. 
</P>
<P>
"Yates accomplishes what Fitzgerald did at his best," James Atlas observes, "an 
evocation of life's unbearable poignance, the way it has of nurturing hope and 
denying it, often in the same instant." Says Yates of his tendency to see 
tragedy more than hope: "Something would be wrong if I didn't." He quotes 
former Israeli diplomat and foreign minister Abba Eban, on the occasion of 
President John Kennedy's assassination, " 'Tragedy is the difference between 
what is and what might have been.' To dwell on what might have been is 
nostalgia, which I think serious writers can easily fall into. Though it's much 
more satisfactory and more profitable if you can keep your eye on what is." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Writes in the Morning 
</P>
<P>
The "what is" of Yates' present life is the simple routine of his work: up at 6 
a.m. and writing for five or six hours. "Since I'm getting older the mornings 
are the only time I have that kind of energy. I get ideas that flow out of the 
pencil. Afternoons are bad periods for me. The energy's gone." 
</P>
<P>
His book is almost halfway done, and going well for the moment, though he 
worries that it's already been four years in the works. Titled "Uncertain 
Times," it is drawn from a period of his life in 1963 when he worked as a 
speech writer for Atty. Gen. Robert Kennedy. The title comes from Kennedy's 
discourse during Yates' hiring interview: "'We're living in very uncertain 
times, Mr. Yates, and those of us in a position of leadership are obliged to be 
responsive to issues like civil rights, but at the same time I have a great 
sense of responsibility here. Do you understand that?' And I said, 'Yes, I do,' 
without quite knowing what he was talking about," Yates says. 
</P>
<P>
"But the times were uncertain for me. I only took the job because I needed the 
money, which is an odd thing because everybody else around him was there at 
some sacrifice of income. I was the only hireling. I never got to know him very 
well, Mr. Robert Kennedy, but I did write everything that came out of his mouth 
for eight months. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the title will be ironic." 
</P>
<P>
Yates has ideas for two more novels, which will bring his output close to the 
15 books he considers respectable for a lifetime. "Nobody knows how much time I 
have left," he says, a volcanic cough rumbling up through him every now and 
then as if to confirm his foreboding. 
</P>
<P>
Later, back in the apartment, he pats a sofa pillow in an idle gesture of 
domesticity that seems eloquently left over. "Getting out of here is an 
appealing idea," he says. "But then, as long as I've lived, getting out of 
wherever I am has seemed an appealing idea. I've learned to temper that." 
</P>
<P>
So he's always continued to write, with the paradox, says Vonnegut, that "he's 
becoming a better artist as his books have become less recognized." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Lawrence, who's negotiating to publish his new book, persistently 
believes in Yates -- to the end and, if need be, thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually it takes them a few years after they're gone to be evaluated," he says 
of writers. "I hope it won't be his case."

OF JUDGMENT AND EXCESS: LOOKING FOR BAD TASTE IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN ALLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bad Taste. Like pornography, no one seems able to define it -- but everyone 
claims to know it when they see it. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike bad morals, bad taste is basically harmless, benign, even funny. And 
unlike bad manners, bad taste is a subjective blight, existing in the eye of 
the beholder. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles is everything a great American city should be: rich, hilarious, of 
questionable taste and throbbing with fake glamour," says director John Waters 
("Hairspray"), who has made a career out of tackiness; his 1972 film "Pink 
Flamingos" was even advertised as "an exercise in poor taste." He cautions, 
however, "to understand bad taste one must have very good taste." 
</P>
<P>
Other artists have tackled the topic as well. Pablo Picasso once said, "The 
chief enemy of creativity is 'good' taste." And the French surrealist Andre 
Breton asserted, "In the bad taste of my epoch, I strive to go farther than any 
other." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In Search of Answers 
</P>
<P>
One wonders what Picasso and Breton would make of Los Angeles circa 1989: a 
town where a supposedly formal party can mean more bras on cars than on the 
women who drive them. But after asking L.A. professionals who work in a variety 
of fields to elaborate on their notions of bad taste, one can only draw a 
single conclusion: bad taste is merely a question of . . . taste. "De gustibus 
non est disputandum." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"It's a vast topic," giggles Jackie Collins, the British-born novelist whose 
best-selling books "Hollywood Wives" and "Hollywood Husbands" recount bad 
taste, L.A. style, in lip-smacking detail. "There's always been plenty of bad 
taste in L.A. Hollywood is more flashy than other American cities, except maybe 
Las Vegas; it has more glitz, more gossip, more hustlers." 
</P>
<P>
"Bad taste results when people don't understand limit or dimension. Then, 
tackiness and pretense become emphasized," says restaurateur Piero Selvaggio, 
who has had a bird's-eye view of the behavior and misbehavior of the rich and 
famous at his restaurants Valentino and Primi. 
</P>
<P>
Selvaggio is bemused rather than annoyed by the bumper crop of bad taste he 
sees in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a growing, new city, with all the problems that go with that," he says. 
"Money has been pouring in so incredibly that suddenly people are rich and 
finding themselves behaving in the most pretentious manner. Isn't that all a 
part of a city with very little culture or diversification? Material things 
become a part of the status quo." 
</P>
<P>
"Someone who in the fin-de-siecle of the 20th Century wants to live in an 
all-Chippendale room is exhibiting a lack of taste and a lack of judgment," 
says Charlie Scheips, formerly the associate publisher of ARTCOAST magazine and 
the current project manager for ART-LA89, the annual L.A. Contemporary Art 
Fair. 
</P>
<P>
"Bad taste, to me, is the attempt to express style without humor or mystery," 
Scheips says, "and you can certainly see plenty of that in L.A. But there are 
really no external standards for taste, despite the fact that the whole camp 
and kitsch sensibilities are based on an understanding of bad taste." 
</P>
<P>
Merchant Fred Hayman, who set the style in Beverly Hills first with Giorgio and 
now with his own eponymous shop on Rodeo Drive, thinks that taste in L.A. is 
improving, "but there's still lots of bad taste everywhere. It's part of L.A. 
being a much younger, much more fun city." 
</P>
<P>
It's easier to stick to generalities when discussing bad taste; when it comes 
to specifics, there's a wide range of opinion. Certainly most people, for 
instance, would agree on the poor taste of something as ludicrous as a mink 
bikini. But what about that hotly debated symbol of conspicuous consumption, 
the fur coat? 
</P>
<P>
Animal-rights activists might argue that merely owning one would be an act of 
the poorest taste imaginable, but others would qualify the coat by where and 
how it was worn: to a PTA meeting, for instance, or on the back of an Eskimo. 
</P>
<P>
"Fur coats are in bad taste. Period," Collins says, while Scheips demurs, "I 
think some fur coats are beautiful. But they're more practical in colder 
climates. In Los Angeles, where no one really needs a fur coat it's a major 
issue (of taste)." 
</P>
<P>
"I think they (fur coats) are more an example of poor judgment, not poor 
taste," says screenwriter/novelist Bruce Wagner. Wagner limned the vulgarities 
of the rich in his screenplay for the film "Scenes From the Class Struggle in 
Beverly Hills," which gleefully delved into a world where family wakes come 
with cocktail pianists and the rich seek diet quacks to lose weight. After a 
moment of reflection on the fur-coat issue, however, Wagner revises his 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I take that back. If I see them on those young actors who fancy themselves 
to be celebrity poets, those fur coats are in bad taste." 
</P>
<P>
Others disagree. Longtime Beverly Hills socialite and charity worker Ellen 
Byrens says simply, "If you have 'em, you wear 'em. But I would not purchase 
the fur of a trapped animal." 
</P>
<P>
Clothing, that ultimate personal expression of style, is particularly fraught 
with the potential for bad taste. 
</P>
<P>
"A polyester pantsuit is, of course, in bad taste," Collins says. "But so is 
wearing too many diamonds. Good and bad taste has nothing to do with wealth. 
Diamonds are great and rhinestones are great -- but not with diamonds. Someone 
who would mix rhinestones and diamonds would be exhibiting very bad taste." 
</P>
<P>
"Don't you know that the people who are against big diamonds are only the ones 
who don't have them?" Byrens laughs. 
</P>
<P>
Rhinestones and diamonds, tasteless as they may be when mixed together, are 
hardly a common sight outside the charity bowls of Beverly Hills. What about 
the far more common -- and growing -- phenomenon of wearing workout gear 
outside of the gym? 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen men wearing weightlifting belts in the supermarket," Wagner 
shudders. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone wearing gym clothes to a restaurant is in bad taste," says Scheips, 
for whom workout gear crosses the line even in a town famous for its casual 
clothing at all occasions. "In L.A., casual means having expensive loafers and 
a Missoni sweater. I call it faux-casual." 
</P>
<P>
And when it comes to evening wear Scheips is equally adamant. 
</P>
<P>
"No colored bow ties or cummerbunds," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Others agree. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen tuxedos made of screaming-green Lurex," Jackie Collins says. "The 
only person I think could get away with that is someone like Michael Jackson, 
whose taste is impeccable," she adds. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner, whose everyday wear is more Melrose than Brooks Brothers -- thick 
black-rimmed glasses and baggy jackets -- finds clothing to be more of a 
relative matter. 
</P>
<P>
"I think things that are either studiously boring or studiously affected are in 
bad taste," he says. "But different people can get away with different things. 
What's inexcusable is if you have bad shoes." 
</P>
<P>
"A plaid tuxedo is in absolutely horrible taste," Byrens says. "I know a guy 
who has one and wears it!" 
</P>
<P>
Subtlety is the key to avoiding bad taste, say both Hayman and Selvaggio, who 
think that a tasteful tuxedo is one that is not noticed or out of place. "Less 
is much, much more, as long as it doesn't become boring," says Hayman, who 
professes "a great dislike" for ruffled or colored tuxedo shirts or -- worst of 
all -- wearing brown shoes with a tuxedo. But what of men's evening wear in 
colors other than black or white? 
</P>
<P>
"If you have the guts to wear it, I take off my hat to you," Selvaggio says 
diplomatically. "But some of those things I've seen are purely . . . 
hallucinogenic." 
</P>
<P>
Designer clothing that bears the designer's name also rankles Scheips ("I'm not 
an ad"), while Collins thinks, "It depends on the designer. Fendi, for 
instance, is never in bad taste." 
</P>
<P>
The chic L.A. restaurant scene can be a breeding ground, a veritable petri dish 
of bad taste: a place where eateries boast of their unlisted telephone numbers, 
potential customers will wait two hours to pay for the privilege of being 
abused, and it's often a draw as to whether the staff or the customers behave 
the worst. 
</P>
<P>
"We see things at Valentino that . . . puzzle us," Selvaggio says, choosing his 
words carefully. "Recently we had a birthday party for a 1-year-old with real 
lions and a circus and a lavish buffet -- for a 1-year-old! Then we had a 
bachelor party, which ended with the arrival of a 240-pound lady wrestler. 
</P>
<P>
"I have also seen people order a $5,000 bottle of wine, merely to impress a 
girl. And then when they only drink about three ounces of it -- it really blows 
your mind." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes bad taste in restaurant-going begins even before one enters the door. 
Which is in worst taste: the restaurants that force customers to queue up for 
no reason at all, or customers who willingly put up with such treatment? 
</P>
<P>
"What's the point of going to a place that doesn't want you to be there?" 
Wagner sneers, speaking of the boites and private clubs whose pretentions to 
exclusivity result in long humiliating lines for the proletariat. "I think it's 
in bad taste for both the restaurant and the people waiting to get in, like it 
was Six Flags Magic Mountain. To me, it's in bad taste to wait for anything 
except a movie or an AIDS test." 
</P>
<P>
Says Scheips: "I don't understand anybody wanting -- or paying -- to be treated 
badly." 
</P>
<P>
"Bad taste in restaurants is just poor manners," Hayman says. "It's when people 
are too loud or obnoxious, or the waiter or captain tries to become too 
personal." 
</P>
<P>
And speaking of personal, Collins claims to have been in trendy L.A. 
restaurants where "people are having sex with girls in adjoining rooms. That is 
in horrendous taste, as is using drugs. I also hate it when I'm out and I see a 
couple who are passionately making out nearby; I figure that they don't even 
touch each other once they get home." 
</P>
<P>
"These people that pay $350 for box seats at the Lakers, or $500 to see 
'Phantom of the Opera' -- it becomes about status, not sports or theater," 
Selvaggio says. "Certain people play into that sense of inferiority, that 
confusion about values. I've been to some picnic orgies at the Hollywood Bowl, 
where Tchaikovsky is playing to the stars, and people are eating, kissing, 
doing everything but listening to the music." 
</P>
<P>
One aspect of L.A. life that several people singled out as being in bad taste 
was the proliferation of bodyguards on the Hollywood scene, and the celebrities 
who, for whatever reason, feel the need to surround themselves by intimidating 
musclemen at industry functions. 
</P>
<P>
"I have seen movie stars with six bodyguards," Collins states in 
half-fascinated, half-horrified tones, "who send a bodyguard or two over to 
another table to try and get a woman for the star. Appalling." 
</P>
<P>
According to Selvaggio, "That is insecurity, not bad taste. They've come to 
accept and need an entourage to cope with success. I mean, I know people who 
make money by being professional company, going out with celebrities and 
laughing at their jokes and everything." 
</P>
<P>
Can bad taste sometimes become good taste? That is, can it go so far, with such 
abandon, that it transcends traditional notions of taste and becomes an 
expression of style all its own? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, absolutely," Collins says. "Las Vegas is the very capital of bad taste for 
instance -- but it can be fun. Look at the style in films like 'Married to the 
Mob' or 'Hairspray.' You can get away with a lot if you have humor." 
</P>
<P>
"Kitsch transcends all that," according to Wagner, mentioning the Tail o' the 
Pup (the venerable L.A. wienie stand shaped like a hot dog) as an example of 
bad taste so transcendent it becomes good taste. "The worst thing about it is 
if it becomes boring or self-conscious." 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, Wagner cites The Burger That Ate L.A. (a new Melrose hamburger 
stand shaped like a hamburger), as true bad taste -- "an artificial landmark. 
Like Epcot Center in Florida, trying to replicate the Eiffel Tower and the 
landmarks of the world. It's bullying the public, rubbing people's nose in it." 
</P>
<P>
What about someone like Liberace, who took rococo kitsch to such an extreme 
that he still stands as perhaps the bad taste beau ideal of our time? 
</P>
<P>
"Liberace's home is not bad taste," Collins insists. "He was an entertainer, 
and this was part of his persona. If a bank manager decorated like that, it 
might be bad taste." 
</P>
<P>
Wagner agrees. "Hollywood is, after all, a repudiation of one's roots," he 
points out, while Scheips thinks it was actually good taste on Liberace's part. 
"He did it with humor. He transformed kitschy candelabras into a statement." 
</P>
<P>
What's the ultimate in bad taste? 
</P>
<P>
"I've lived in L.A., for 25 years, and I've seen people making fools of 
themselves in so many ways," Selvaggio says, begging off the question. "Let's 
forgive L.A., shall we, for being so young and rich?" 
</P>
<P>
"Flaunting excess," Fred Hayman says. "Publicizing your wealth. You know, 
there's nothing wrong with having a hell of a lot, but when you show too much, 
that is in awful taste." 
</P>
<P>
"I think criticizing other people is in very bad taste," Scheips says. "And 
making someone feel as if they were in a lower station than you is the very 
ultimate in bad taste." 
</P>
<P>
To Byrens, the ultimate in bad taste "is putting someone in an embarrassing 
position. If you want to yell at someone who is your social equal, that's OK -- 
but never at a salesgirl or a waiter." 
</P>
<P>
Isolating bad taste in L.A., according to Wagner, "would be like taking a slide 
of a cancer patient and pointing your stubby finger at which cells are growing 
and where. Come on! This is the very crucible of bad taste!" 
</P>
<P>
But Wagner is a pragmatist as well. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line, of course," he sighs, is "as long as you make a lot of money 
in L.A., people do tend to ignore bad taste."

TIPS FOR STYLISH TRIP DOWN BAD-TASTE LANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

In the car culture of Los Angeles, the limousine may be the ultimate status 
symbol. A quick look through the Yellow Pages reveals a dizzying array of 
accouterments with which one can appoint a hired car: moon roofs, color TVs, 
VCRs, quadraphonic stereo systems with CD players, wet bars, fax machines, 
bodyguards, cellular phones, and even "personalized napkins" (the final touch 
to an elegant evening). 
</P>
<P>
The question: When does the well-appointed limousine run the red light of 
decorum and crash squarely into bad taste? 
</P>
<P>
"Limos with Jacuzzis are in decidedly bad taste, as are those 
stretch-stretch-stretch limos," best-selling author Jackie Collins says, adding 
that she believes the elegant car can only come in black, white or silver. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Scheips, project manager for ART-LA89, the L.A. Contemporary Art Fair, 
is even more strict. "I don't think they should be anything but black," he 
says. "And believing that a limousine makes you a more important person is in 
very bad taste." 
</P>
<P>
"The redeeming value of a limousine is to be in company you enjoy without 
worrying about the driving," restaurateur Piero Selvaggio says. "I see the new 
long stretch limos, and I think I would not like to be inside. I would feel 
silly. 
</P>
<P>
"(Limousines in) colors are even worse. They are looking to other people to be 
noticed. They're stretching it, like they're stretching the limo itself." 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Byrens, a Beverly Hills socialite and charity worker who often travels by 
limousine, stresses that "black is the only acceptable color. Really, they're 
only for transportation, not entertainment. Have you heard about the ones with 
the hot tubs? Disgusting." As for the new super stretch limos, the ones that 
almost require a flexible joist in the middle to traverse corners, Byrens says, 
"they should live in them -- not ride them." 
</P>
<P>
Screenwriter Bruce Wagner, who began his Hollywood career as a limo driver, has 
developed his own opinions on limousines from the perspective of both the front 
and the back seats. "Stretch limousines are really for the nouveaux riche," he 
says, the curled lip evident in his voice. "When I see one of those block-long 
stretch limousines, I know the person inside is one of two things: Either some 
prom kid, or some guy who pays for Ike Turner's bail or something."

LARGE-SCALE GAUCHERIES ON THE BIG-MONEY CHARITY CIRCUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN ALLMAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The party's over, and waiters are taking up the wine-stained damask 
tablecloths. Guests are drifting to their cars, stuffed with veal and 
self-satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
But what's that over there? Oh, it's just a guest who paid $10,000 for his meal 
-- trying to sneak out the door with a purloined centerpiece worth about $25. 
</P>
<P>
On the big-money charity dinner circuit, no one would dare show up in a clip-on 
tie, or clean his teeth with a matchbook during dessert. No, at the power 
parties of Beverly Hills and Hollywood, bad taste comes on a much larger scale. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes it's celebrities who misbehave. For instance, smoking on the dais may 
or may not be in bad taste -- but how about the nighttime soap star who 
horrified the crowd by doing just that at a benefit for the American Cancer 
Society? 
</P>
<P>
Guests at another benefit several years back could hardly forget the evening's 
guest of honor, a former top star of the 1940s whose limousine was two hours 
late and who never made it inside once she pulled up. She had been nervous, 
sources said, and had kept the driver circling the block while she imbibed a 
liquid courage from the wet bar in the back seat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crossing the Line 
</P>
<P>
Charities that concern themselves with man's inhumanity to man sometimes cross 
the line of bad taste as well. Take one Amnesty International party, where 
guests were shown real-life films of torture -- after which a zealous party 
organizer chirped, "Let's eat!" to the stunned group. 
</P>
<P>
At one Academy Awards viewing party, thrown as a benefit for another human 
rights organization, organizers used the commercial breaks in the Oscar 
telecast to show videotapes of atrocities that included graphic close-ups of 
dead and rotting bodies, leaving guests with forks poised halfway between plate 
and mouth. 
</P>
<P>
Most charity functions provide alternatives for those who don't like or can't 
eat the dinner on the menu. But it wasn't a request for vegetarian or kosher 
food that inspired one cranky guest at the Beverly Hilton Hotel to demand that 
the kitchen make him up a plate of spaghetti. Party organizers all over town, 
well used to this man's sensitive palate and heavyweight clout, grit their 
teeth and prepare him whatever he likes when he shows up to an affair. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Execrable Taste 
</P>
<P>
Discussing how much -- or how little -- something costs, is in the most 
execrable taste, most would agree. Most, that is, except one local captain of 
finance, who regaled his table companions at a Joffrey Ballet dinner with a 
laundry list of the price tags related to his recent home remodeling. The 
gentleman, who apparently wished to be thought of as another Donald Trump, 
instead came off as that other great American, George Babbitt. 
</P>
<P>
Worse yet after an art auction benefiting the medical emergency charity 
Operation California, one $25,000 donor was so miffed when he wasn't mentioned 
in press coverage of the event that he stopped payment on his check. 
</P>
<P>
And, believe it or not, even something as innocuous as a centerpiece can serve 
as a catalyst for human bad taste and greed. At one annual yuletide luncheon, 
the mistress of ceremonies finally had to forestall centerpiece squabbling by 
announcing that the person at each table whose birthday fell closest to her own 
would get to keep the favor. Were drivers licenses produced and examined? You 
bet. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the lavish premiere of "Ruthless People" at the Century Plaza 
Hotel, which featured especially striking centerpieces. They were all too 
attractive to sticky-fingered guests, and guards finally had to be set up at 
the escalators to keep guests from absconding with the Memphis-style vases that 
held the flowers.

Britain's Duchess of York has landed a fee of $125,000 from Redbook magazine 
for serial rights to her first two children's books about a heroic helicopter. 
"Budgie The Helicopter" will appear in the magazine's September issue, which 
will be on newsstands next month, Redbook Editor in Chief Annette Capone 
announced. The wife of Prince Andrew has penned one other "Budgie" adventure: 
"Budgie at Bendick Point." The title character's name comes from the nickname 
the duchess gave to the helicopter in which she learned to fly. Capone 
described the books as about "the adventures of a feisty little helicopter 
named Budgie who heroically risks his life to come to the aid of children who 
find themselves in a jam." The books, illustrated by John Richardson, will be 
published in September. Part of the duchess' income will be donated to charity.

JUDGE MIRRORS SPOUSAL-ABUSE MYTHS; 
</P>
<P>
MISPLACED REGRETS OVER SENTENCING A SYMPTOM OF THE VIOLENCE MALAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOYCE FAIDLEY, Joyce Faidley coordinates the Family Violence Prevention 
Center at the Center for Women's Studies and Services in San Diego. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I recently sat through the sentencing of Navy Cmdr. Larry J. Evans as an 
advocate and supporter of his former wife, Mary Kouwe, whom Evans was convicted 
of pistol-whipping and raping while they were married. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Bernard E. Revak sentenced Evans to 11 years in prison, 
less than the moderate 14-year sentence recommended by the Probation 
Department. And he presented this judgment with a 20-minute soliloquy on how 
sorry he was to so strictly sentence a man with such professional potential and 
such an honorable background. 
</P>
<P>
Revak said this was probably the most difficult sentence in which he had been 
involved in more than 24 years as a prosecutor and a judge. It was difficult, 
he said, not only because of the individuals involved but because state law 
required him to sentence Evans to prison. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Cmdr. Evans will understand it . . . because I think he is perhaps the 
most intelligent defendant that has ever appeared in front of me. . . . If I 
had the discretion, I would grant you probation. There is just no question in 
my mind I would grant you probation. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the punishment that you have received and will receive, loss of a 
military career, unlikely reunification with your children, with your wife, the 
embarrassment of such a conviction, the loss of your dental license, everything 
that you have worked so hard for all of your life, all these things I feel are 
tremendous punishment." 
</P>
<P>
Revak's comments, in which he repeatedly pointed out the virtues of the man he 
was sentencing while making little mention of the physical and emotional abuse 
inflicted on the victim, provide a clear example of some of the myths about 
family violence and spousal rape that still permeate our society. 
</P>
<P>
The first myth about wife beating that came through in Revak's remarks was the 
idea that the woman is responsible for the beating, that she aggravates the man 
to a point of no return -- pushes his buttons so to speak -- so that he has no 
recourse but to beat her. "I think both of you have to share a lot of 
responsibility for what went on," Revak said. 
</P>
<P>
Revak supported this myth by saying that there was conflicting testimony on who 
obtained the gun and who initiated its use. 
</P>
<P>
He also said he was troubled by the fact that the former Mrs. Evans had 
"willingly engaged in sexual relations with her husband" after obtaining a 
restraining order against him. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it created a false sense of security or home for Mr. Evans. . . . And 
so I think that in some small way she is responsible. I think he is 
responsible. I think it's a tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of Mary Kouwe's comments or behavior surrounding the use of the 
weapon, regardless of whether she had earlier consented to sexual relations 
with her husband, she did not ask to be brutalized and terrified. And the 
actions Larry Evans was convicted of -- rape, rape with a foreign object, 
forced oral copulation, assault with force likely to create great bodily harm 
and assault with a deadly weapon -- are not justified. Kouwe's injuries 
included black eyes, a broken ear drum, chipped tooth and injury to her nose, 
not to mention the emotional trauma. Rape is not an act of sex, but an act of 
violence. And rape by a husband, psychologists say, can be more traumatizing 
than rape by a stranger because the victim feels not only violated, but 
betrayed. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the nature of the crime, however, Revak repeatedly emphasized the 
defendant's positive attributes. "Here's a man with a lot of skills. He has 
been to Harvard Medical School, where he brought himself up by his bootstraps 
in the South, went to school in Florida, graduated first in his class . . and 
now, here he stands, convicted of extremely serious felonies." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Revak would have sentenced this man to perform community service for 
battered women and poor people if he had had his way. 
</P>
<P>
Revak did acknowledge, however, that Evans' sentence might deter other men from 
beating their wives. Revak said "a message has to be sent, because here is a 
man who was up for captain at an accelerated rate, who knows he might have been 
an admiral some day. And the prospect of sentencing such a person to prison is 
not pleasant with me . . . but nevertheless here is a man who attacked and beat 
his wife." 
</P>
<P>
Revak was not certain, however, whether Evans was one of those men who 
consistently batter their wives, as his wife had testified. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel confident that Cmdr. Evans will never commit such a crime again, or any 
crime for that matter. . . . But notwithstanding that, there are a lot of men 
that continually batter their women and continually get away with it." 
</P>
<P>
One of the stereotypical attitudes most clearly expressed by the judge can be 
seen in this comment: " . . . a lot of men that continually batter their 
women." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps men still beat their women because they feel women belong to them. When 
a wife or woman is viewed as property, she can be abused as a thing rather than 
treated as a human being. Sex becomes her duty, and she becomes, once again, 
"unrapeable." The truth is that sexual expression of love is one thing, forced 
sex is another. No one consents to violence when she marries or enters an 
intimate relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Many women may believe that spousal rape and battery could never happen to 
them, and many men may believe that Mary Kouwe's victimization is an isolated 
experience shared by few women. 
</P>
<P>
But the attorney general says that 50% of California women will be assaulted at 
some time in their lives by someone they love, and one out of three women in 
the state will be confronted by a sexual assailant. It is estimated that 80% of 
these sexual assaults will involve a perpetrator whom the victims know. 
</P>
<P>
How can we educate people about domestic violence? A lot is happening locally 
to dispel the myths about family violence and to help both victims and 
perpetrators. 
</P>
<P>
A countywide Task Force on Domestic Violence was recently formed to consolidate 
efforts in aiding victims. The Center for Women's Studies and Services (CWSS) 
offers workshops for hospital personnel on how to work with the battered woman 
and training for police officers. The CWSS Family Violence Prevention Center 
also has a crisis hot line, a shelter, a legal clinic to help women obtain 
temporary restraining orders and divorce assistance and to provide courtroom 
advocacy. The center also provides individual and group counseling. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Volunteer Lawyer Program also recently began a Domestic Violence 
Prevention Project. 
</P>
<P>
There is also assistance for perpetrators. The city attorney's Domestic 
Violence Unit recommends counseling at the YWCA's Men's Counseling Program as 
part of the sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
But, before these resources can be used, the problem must be identified. As a 
society, we need to remove the problem from behind closed doors and acknowledge 
it as a serious crime. 
</P>
<P>
Attitudes like those presented by Judge Revak make that difficult. Wife beating 
and rape are condoned when the perpetrator is acknowledged as "very successful, 
very intelligent, a tremendous educational background," while the survivor's 
plight is virtually ignored. 
</P>
<P>
Spousal abuse and spousal rape need to be understood as actions that can 
escalate to death, and they should be dealt with in our judicial system in the 
same manner as stranger incidents. 
</P>
<P>
Would we examine the bank robber's educational background and potential for 
career advancement and would we ask the bank teller he held up why she let the 
crime happen? 
</P>
<P>
Revak referred often to the Evans case as "a real tragedy." The real tragedy is 
not Larry Evans' sentencing. He was allowed to remain free pending appeal. Nor 
is it Mary Kouwe's victimization. She now calls herself a "survivor." The real 
tragedy does not even lie in the future of the Evans' three children, who we 
hope will receive help so that they do not perpetuate the cycle of violent 
relationships. 
</P>
<P>
The real tragedy is the message that can be inferred from Judge Revak's 
comments -- that family violence is somehow a less serious crime that should 
receive a less serious sentence than other crimes of violence.

BOWEN BUILDINGS RAZED FOR HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recently, through a tragic turn of events, a major developer won permission to 
destroy a Huntington Beach landmark and build six upper-income, single-family 
dwellings directly across the street from the new Civic Center parking lot. His 
profit, according to data in the environmental impact report, will be slightly 
less than $400,000. The cost of his project to this city is virtually 
inestimable. 
</P>
<P>
As you drive by these homes in the future and see the bronze marker identifying 
the location of the former landmark structures, the Bowen Buildings, try to 
estimate the value of what was lost: an $8-million petroleum museum, once 
offered at virtually no expense to the city of Huntington Beach; positive 
recognition as the location of the only such museum in the Los Angeles basin; 
and retention of a historic landmark of major significance. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission and the City Council had the opportunity to evaluate 
the proposal for this grand museum and determine for themselves if it was 
feasible. They failed. How many more opportunities for cultural advancement 
will be ignored because they do not fit into city leaders' previously conceived 
plans? 
</P>
<P>
A modern city is seldom evaluated on just the number of expensive houses it has 
built. Houses can be built anywhere. The factors that contribute to the quality 
of life are those that are unique to an individual city or that offer cultural 
and social advantages. It is, unfortunately, too late for this cultural jewel. 
Will Huntington Beach also lose the next one, and the one after that?

THE TRIAL BETWEEN IRVINE CO., HEIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your June 15 edition contained an article entitled "Trial Pitting Irvine Co., 
Heir Enters Its Final Two Days." Your reporter did not include all of the 
facts. It had been reported that the Irvine Co. was prepared to pay about $76 
million in interest on top of a $114-million offer to Joan Irvine Smith. 
Assuming this is accurate, the offer is $190 million, the request $330 million, 
a difference of $140 million. 
</P>
<P>
I understand this is all about money and how much compensation Smith and her 
mother, Athalie Clark, should receive for her 11% of ownership in the Irvine 
Co. For what it's worth, I have a suggestion to resolve the impasse. The 
difference between request and offer is $140 million. I propose that Smith 
accept the $190 million offer and that in addition, both sides agree to 
allocate the $140-million difference in the following manner: 
</P>
<P>
1) 50%, or $70 million, to the James Irvine Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
2) 50%, or $70 million, to the Irvine Co. Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The corpus shall be left intact and the interest to be allocated annually among 
the 700-plus nonprofit agencies and organizations in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
My only caveat is that distribution of funds go specifically to help the 
homeless, the poor and the needy in Orange County. We've now taken care of both 
the plaintiff and the defendant, neither of whom personally needs the 
additional money. 
</P>
<P>
The only task remaining is who pays the barristers and expert witnesses? Having 
watched "L.A. Law," there is a concept still around called pro bono. Since 
everyone else would be willing to compromise, I suggest Paul Hastings, Janofsky 
&amp; Walker as well as Loeb &amp; Loeb be paid for their services in full, and 
in return, they be asked to donate 50% of their fees to the James Irvine 
Foundation and the Irvine Co. Foundation. The house of wisdom has seven pillars 
-- knowledge, integrity, judgment, imagination, courage, tolerance and faith. 
Good manners may in seven words be found: Forget yourself and think of those 
around. A lesson for us all.

PLANNING FUTURE OF BOLSA CHICA LANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a longtime Huntington Beach resident and observer of the painful efforts to 
"plan" the Bolsa Chica, I think some recent events deserve considerably more 
public attention than they have received so far. 
</P>
<P>
It has been apparent for some time that many conflicting public and private 
interests would have to be melded if an acceptable and workable plan is to be 
formulated for the Bolsa Chica wetlands. It has also been apparent -- though 
perhaps not so readily -- that a true consensus plan would be a prerequisite 
for actually achieving any of the public or private benefits the Bolsa Chica 
could provide. The key question has been how to achieve that consensus. 
</P>
<P>
It appears that Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder found the answer when she 
insisted on the creation of the Bolsa Chica Planning Coalition by 
representatives of the major factions to develop an acceptable plan. At last, a 
consensus seems to be evolving among the varied interest groups and agencies 
involved in determining the future of Bolsa Chica. 
</P>
<P>
The Bolsa Chica is my front yard, so to speak. I am very concerned what happens 
there. I also view the Bolsa Chica as a significant environmental resource 
worthy of protection and enhancement. Philosophically, I believe that the 
landowner has certain property rights. I think there has been a serious and 
creative attempt by Wieder and the coalition to balance all these valid 
objectives. 
</P>
<P>
The recent unanimous approval of the coalition's concept plan by the city of 
Huntington Beach is an important indicator that a true consensus is emerging. 
</P>
<P>
More work remains to be done to further refine the agreements reached to date. 
I hope that work will continue in the spirit of consensus building and balanced 
interests established by Wieder. Those of us interested in the future of the 
Bolsa Chica owe her and the members of the coalition a sincere thank you.

TRAINING HIKE BY MARINE RESERVISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding the article concerning Marine Corps reservists' 10-mile training hike 
through Irvine and Newport Beach (June 27), the story was so embellished with 
terrifying adverbs and adjectives that it appeared the march route was 
populated with people whose mental capacity to comprehend is open to question. 
</P>
<P>
The article was filled with terms such as "startles suburbanites," "quite 
intimidating" to onlookers, "startled some civilians," "worried" residents, got 
"strange looks" from drivers, "surprised" people, made people "uneasy at 
first," individuals thought "we were getting into trouble" and "surprised and 
scared" other persons. 
</P>
<P>
Lord spare us if the people quoted are indicative of the home front in case of 
actual conflict.

Re "Dannemeyer Suggests Top-Level Gay Drift" (July 1): As Rep. William E. 
Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) continues his pitiful publicity march against 
homosexuals, the family unit, which he contends he's protecting, stands alone 
in its effort to maintain the very fabric of its existence. Orange County 
families are on a daily battlefront facing the realities of unaffordable 
housing, drug abuse, chemical air pollution, inadequate day-care facilities, 
deteriorating public school systems and the necessity for two incomes to 
survive. Dannemeyer meanwhile, kicks up his heels, tinseled in a gaudy 
self-promotion, headlining in his silly savagery against the "pink plague." 
</P>
<P>
A politician interested in making news by spitting bullets at a life style is 
missing the target; worse still, he leaves his constituents defenseless in 
their crusade against the problems they elected him to combat. 
</P>
<P>
I would suggest that the brave soldiers who are fighting to keep their families 
intact, retire Dannemeyer and his fruitless, incompetent efforts and elect a 
leader with backbone, one interested in solving real problems, not making them 
for his personal glorification.

GOLF RANGE VS. THE GROWING NEEDS OF ONE COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After reading the article on the successful, productive community gardens at 
Leisure World (June 26), a letter regarding the organic community garden at 
Golden West College is in order. Golden West's garden has been in existence for 
over 10 years. During the last six months, the gardeners at the college have 
been actively working toward the preservation of this community amenity. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1988, we were sent a letter that the garden was to be closed as 
early as June but by Sept. 1, 1989, for certain. They were only allowing those 
enrolled in the fall 1988 semester to continue until the closure. This was the 
first any of us knew of the plan. Golden West College officials would like to 
see the area converted into a golf driving range. There already exist three 
golf driving ranges within five miles of Golden West College. In an even larger 
area, there exist no community gardens. 
</P>
<P>
I believe that the college deviates from its mission when it additionally 
suggests that not only will it develop a golf driving range, but is also 
considering apartment buildings or a commercial center at the southwest corner 
of the campus. What is happening to the community college system? Aren't these 
campuses sacred from the overwhelming need to cover every inch of open space 
with concrete structures? Similar proposals have been initiated by Orange Coast 
College in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the matter, as the June 26 article reiterated, is the fact that 
the community gardening is beneficial in many ways to those who participate. 
Participants who have no other place to garden gain exercise, healthy fruits 
and vegetables, opportunities to socialize that may not be available otherwise 
and general mental renewal from the act of gardening. Time after time the 
National Gardening Assn. surveys find that gardening is the most popular 
leisure-time activity. 
</P>
<P>
Our immediate goal has been to reopen the garden to everyone on a 
semester-by-semester basis, to use the garden to the fullest until this 
development plan is actually formulated. As of this writing, the college is 
uncertain about how it will develop the campus, however it refuses to reopen 
the garden to everyone. It will allow the few who were not scared off by the 
closure letter to remain but will not let others partake in this renewing, 
ever-popular activity. 
</P>
<P>
I thought community colleges had a responsibility to serve the needs in their 
community. I am disappointed in the lack of the community college district to 
address the full range of community needs. Without forward-thinking planning 
for the whole community, urban life will continue to produce symptoms which are 
even more expensive to repair than the buildings at Golden West College, which 
is the cited motivation for these development plans.

ORANGE COUNTY FIREWORKS BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is unfortunate that the Los Angeles Times and apparently a handful of others 
still cling to the idea that if something is banned, no one will obtain it or 
use it. In your editorial "A Ban Against Fireworks Should Be Countywide" (July 
2), you continue to wring out the same tired reasons you feel a ban on all 
fireworks is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, most states allow their residents to legally purchase and use some 
type of fireworks for the Fourth of July. Eight allow all types of class C 
fireworks, including firecrackers, skyrockets and star shells. I'm not saying 
those should be legal here, but I do feel most residents of California are 
responsible enough that they should be able to purchase some items legally if 
they choose to do so. 
</P>
<P>
It's also disappointing that you choose to criticize the groups that still sell 
legal fireworks somewhat harshly. It's never been easy to raise funds, no 
matter how you do it. And despite how you feel about them, fireworks are a very 
popular item. Nobody is forced to buy any, but sales continue to do well year 
after year. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Boy Scouts, I really don't care whether they sell fireworks or not, 
but it is interesting that an organization that tries to teach young people how 
to do things correctly and responsibly says no to something that, in a way, can 
be a teaching tool. Most people handle flammable objects many times during a 
life, be they matches, road flares or any of a thousand other things. Why not 
instruct them on how to handle legal fireworks correctly? Personally, I can't 
help wondering whether they have since canceled all cookouts and campfires too, 
since those can also be hazardous if misused. 
</P>
<P>
No item is risk-free, but legal fireworks are probably the safest items of 
their kind sold anywhere to the public. I have tried most class C items in 
various states where they are legally sold, so I know something of where I 
speak. 
</P>
<P>
Urge proper use and proper supervision. Strongly discourage use of illegal 
goods and offer the best and most reliable products in their place, and I think 
you will achieve much more than you would with a total ban. I sincerely hope 
that the seven Orange County cities that allow legal fireworks sales and use 
will continue to do so.

A short time ago raw sewage spilled into the beach at Newport. Last month raw 
sewage spilled into Aliso Beach in Laguna. Shall we wait until there is an 
epidemic of cholera, dysentery and several other death-causing diseases before 
the city or county declares a moratorium on building and until the adequate 
filter beds and larger sewer lines are built and installed to accommodate the 
ever-increasing amount of sewage from new construction in Orange County?

TIMES ORANGE COUNTY POLL; 
</P>
<P>
O.C. TRANSPORTATION TAX INCREASE A TOSSUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the eve of a crucial vote to place a proposed half-cent sales tax increase 
for transportation projects on the November ballot, The Times Orange County 
Poll shows local voters almost evenly divided, with support slipping. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how they would vote on a ballot measure to raise the local sales tax from 
6% to 6 1/2%, 48% of the respondents said they would favor it, 46% opposed it 
and 6% were unsure. Eleven months ago, The Times Orange County Poll found 54% 
in favor of the tax increase, which is expected to cost consumers about $50 to 
$75 per year. 
</P>
<P>
The Times Orange County Poll, conducted by Irvine-based Mark Baldassare &amp; 
Associates, involved a random-sample telephone survey of 672 registered voters 
in Orange County from June 28 to July 1. The margin of error is 4%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Approval in Question' 
</P>
<P>
"The measure's chance of getting the majority approval it needs to pass in 
November is in question," Baldassare said Saturday. "I think that as we get 
closer to an election the more real it becomes. People realize that this is not 
an abstract concept, and we see some backing off." County residents' lack of 
support for the half-cent sales tax proposal "contrasts sharply with their 
opinions of the county's traffic situation," Baldassare said. 
</P>
<P>
"A stunning 66% are highly unsatisfied with local traffic and transportation 
conditions, and only 8% are very satisfied," Baldassare said. Another quarter 
say they are somewhat satisfied with this aspect of their life in their 
community." 
</P>
<P>
Baldassare said this follows the pattern seen in 1984, when Proposition A, a 
1-cent sales tax increase for transportation projects, was defeated 70% to 30% 
although several pre-election opinion surveys showed majority support for it. 
The ballot measure, if approved, would have added 1 cent to the retail sales 
tax in Orange County for 15 years, making it 7 cents on the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
"Support for the 6 1/2% sales tax does increase as perceptions of local traffic 
become more negative," Baldassare added. "But even among those who say they are 
not at all satisfied with traffic and transportation conditions in their local 
community, only a mere 51% majority favors the ballot measure." 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Transportation Commission is expected to vote Monday to call 
a Nov. 7 special election on the sales-tax question, partly to avoid having the 
county tax measure appear on the same ballot in June with Gov. George 
Deukmejian's proposed statewide gasoline tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed county tax would raise $3.1 billion for an $11.5 billion, 20-year 
traffic improvement and growth management plan, with the remaining $8.4 billion 
coming from other sources, including the state and federal governments. 
</P>
<P>
Without the sales-tax increase, experts say, the county faces a $14-billion 
shortfall over the next 20 years in revenue needed to pay for various projects 
including freeway widening, a countywide commuter rail system, "super streets" 
and other improvements designed to reduce congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the poll respondents said Saturday that they didn't know what the 
proposed tax increase would pay for, and wouldn't vote for it unless they did. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe there's too much mismanagement with the current funds, so there's no 
sense in forcing more funds into the system," said Bob Richardson of Santa Ana. 
"They'd have to prove to me that it's going to truly improve traffic conditions 
in Orange County. We could spend all this money and still be 20 years behind in 
solving the traffic mess. We have to slow down the economy, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
"I think I already pay enough sales tax," said Noreen Weatherford of 
Westminster. "I don't know that spending this money would make any difference. 
I don't think anything will stop the traffic mess." 
</P>
<P>
However, Weatherford said she might change her opinion if she knew what 
projects would be funded with additional tax money. She said she was unaware 
that county transportation officials plan to use some of the money for new 
roads and commuter trains, for example. 
</P>
<P>
Support for the tax increase, meanwhile, is clearly built on drivers' 
frustrations. 
</P>
<P>
"Have you ever taken the (Costa Mesa) 55 Freeway in the morning?" asked 
tax-measure supporter Roland Bryant of Garden Grove. "It's backed up from here 
to God-knows-where. It's hard on your truck, hard on your back, and you're 
basically screwed." 
</P>
<P>
"We need it to be able to ease the transportation system," added Newport Beach 
resident Michael Gorfain, who commutes daily to Los Angeles. "It will provide 
some needed improvements, such as expansion of the freeways and the bus and 
car-pool lanes." 
</P>
<P>
The latest Times Orange County Poll shows that the half-cent sales-tax increase 
receives its strongest support from south county voters, where it leads by 54% 
to 38%. North of the Costa Mesa Freeway, however, the measure is rejected by a 
45% to 49% margin. Similarly, those with jobs in the south county or outside 
the county support the measure, while those working in the north county do not. 
Among those people who are not in the work force, Baldassare said, only 37% 
favor the tax. 
</P>
<P>
By income, the poll shows that only residents with incomes above $60,000 a year 
give the proposed tax increase majority support. The measure also holds a 
slight majority among Democrats and non-GOP voters, Baldassare said. But among 
Republicans, more oppose the tax increase than favor it. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the most significant things we found in our poll is north county versus 
south county," Baldassare said. "It suggests that north county residents see 
less direct benefit from the tax than do south county residents. . . . South 
county residents have new freeways on their minds and they are more desperate." 
</P>
<P>
This is not unlike the split that emerged between north and south county in the 
battle over last year's unsuccessful slow-growth ballot initiative, which 
carried in the south but failed in the more populated north. 
</P>
<P>
"The north-south issue," said Baldassare, "is going to be one of the most 
fascinating in this campaign." 
</P>
<P>
The north-south split was characterized more as a cities-versus-county battle 
during negotiations that have led to Monday's anticipated action by the Orange 
County Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The League of Cities, representing mayors, council members and city managers, 
was able to shift some of the planned spending under the sales tax proposal 
from transit to local and regional street projects. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Monday's anticipated decision by the commission comes after 18 months of 
mostly successful wrangling among divergent political factions which include 
developers, city officials, environmentalists and slow-growth advocates such as 
San Juan Capistrano rancher Tom Rogers, a key opponent of the unsuccessful 
June, 1984, 1-cent sales tax measure. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently won over this time, Rogers said Friday: 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like we got what we had asked for. There's nobody more anti-tax in 
Orange County than this ol' cowboy, but I've looked at the lack of 
transportation facilities we have and my own use of the freeways, and I can see 
that this (tax) investment will end up saving me money (in reduced delays). I'd 
like everyone to see it that way. It's an economic savings." 
</P>
<P>
The last remaining stumbling block to widespread acceptance of a November 
election was the formation of an independent committee -- insisted upon by 
Rogers and others -- which would oversee implementation of the sales-tax plan, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Even as late as Thursday, the League of Cities was trying to limit the powers 
of that committee. But county officials said the only major departure from 
Rogers' proposals was that the committee would not be able to control actual 
disbursement of the money. 
</P>
<P>
Interviews with several commission members indicated that they favor calling a 
Nov. 7 election to avoid having the measure on the June, 1990, ballot with 
other tax increases, especially Gov. George Deukmejian's proposed 
nickel-a-gallon statewide gasoline tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly don't want to be in competition with a state gasoline tax," 
commission Chairman Thomas F. Riley said Friday. "Having both (measures) might 
be confusing to the public." 
</P>
<P>
Without the extra $3.1 billion that would be raised by the proposed sales tax 
increase, officials say, there will be only enough money to build three planned 
tollways in eastern and southern Orange County, complete 80% of the 
$1.5-billion Santa Ana Freeway widening project and 60% of planned local street 
projects, and to maintain existing transit service at current ridership levels. 
</P>
<P>
None of the revenue from the proposed half-cent sales tax would go for the 
three planned tollways. 
</P>
<P>
Other concessions to the 1984 opponents include strict growth regulations that 
county officials say will prevent use of the tax money for projects that 
primarily benefit developers instead of relieving current congestion. Also, the 
plan gives the independent committee authority to conduct public hearings and 
block any changes in the spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, there is a tacit but unwritten understanding between sales tax 
proponents and environmentalists that proponents also will support a bond 
measure in June for purchase of additional parklands. 
</P>
<P>
Baldassare acknowledged Saturday that some surveys conducted by other firms 
have shown support for the proposed sales tax as high as 67%, as recently as 
March. 
</P>

"However, we know both from previous polls in Orange County and from campaigns 
involving ballot initiatives in California that voter sentiment can shift very 
dramatically, in a very short period of time," Baldassare said. "We're in a 
very volatile period." 
</P>
<P>
The Times Orange County Poll sales tax ballot measure poll was conducted June 
28 to July 1 by Mark Baldassare and Associates. The telephone survey of 672 
Orange County registered voters used a random sample of listed and unlisted 
telephone numbers. The margin of error for a sample of this size is +/- 4 
percent. The margin of error for subgroups, such as North and South County 
residents, would be larger.

<P>
Now this is the life. 
</P>
<P>
You're three stories up at Anaheim Stadium, a short foul ball away from home 
plate, in an air-conditioned cubicle overlooking the swirling crowd. 
Plate-glass windows stretch to the ceiling. There are plush swivel chairs for 
lounging, closed-circuit TV, a fully stocked bar to lean on and quaff a few. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent balmy evening, Dean Poremba and his four buddies were making the 
most of it. The day's work was a distant memory, the beers were flowing and a 
mean game of "pass the cup" was on. To top it off, the Angels had just poked a 
three-bagger to drive one in and tie the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Yep," Bob Restaino summed up in his best beer-commercial voice, "it doesn't 
get any better than this." Poremba and the rest busted up. Even bad jokes get a 
laugh when you're having this much fun. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, the sky box. Fast becoming a part of the national lexicon, it's as 
distinctly American as the game of baseball. Or football. Part local pub, part 
corporate board room, the sky box is every grown-up Little Leaguer's dream. 
These are the best seats in town. Certainly the most expensive. 
</P>
<P>
And when the All-Star game comes to Anaheim Stadium on Tuesday, the 113 sky 
boxes ringing the second level of the triple-tiered ballpark will be the 
hottest ticket in town, playing host to an impressive lineup of corporate 
sluggers, celebrities and assorted other VIPs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited. It'll be fun," said Greg Janssen, a salesman for Kilsby-Roberts, 
a tubing manufacturing company that leases a spacious box at Anaheim Stadium 
for use by the company's employees and customers. "I know we'll be putting on a 
spread, and I think the Angels and the city of Anaheim are really working to do 
it right for this game." 
</P>
<P>
But don't get your hopes up: Life in the sky box is typically reserved for a 
privileged few. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High-Level Entertainment 
</P>
<P>
"This is a high-level entertainment that companies buy for their key accounts 
or potential customers," said Pete Donovan, sales and promotions director for 
the Los Angeles Rams, operators of the Anaheim Stadium sky boxes. "It's the 
same kind of business that's done on the golf course. It's schmoozing and 
getting to know them. It's part of the American business psychology." 
</P>
<P>
It will be no different for the All-Star game, although even the most 
productive middle managers may find few seats in the company box come Tuesday. 
Instead, the sky boxes will be mostly reserved for top executives and their 
biggest customers. 
</P>
<P>
The pricey perks will go to executives and friends of such firms as Arco, 
Coca-Cola and Eastman-Kodak -- as well as the Irvine Co., Rockwell, C.J. 
Segerstrom &amp; Sons, The Times and other Southland businesses. 
</P>
<P>
And no wonder. At Anaheim Stadium, a typical 12-seat sky box costs upward of 
$34,000 a year for a package combining both football and baseball. Garnering 
such a box for just a dozen pro football games costs $22,000. 
</P>
<P>
If, however, you want to go enjoy the sky box during a Madonna concert or a 
tractor pull or stadium motocross, you pay extra for admission. Moreover, sky 
box holders must lay down extra cash for tickets to the All-Star game. Most are 
doing just that and using their clout to purchase even more ducats than usual 
for this very big game. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Whole Bit 
</P>
<P>
"We were able to secure 36 tickets," Janssen said. "We'll have a luncheon 
beforehand, a tour of the plant, then drive everyone out in one big group. 
People will probably get commemorative T-shirts, the whole bit." 
</P>
<P>
Lofty though the admission price to an Anaheim Stadium sky box may seem, it's a 
relative bargain on the national scene. 
</P>
<P>
Parks in such places as Seattle, Denver and Miami charge much more, up to 
$80,000 annually. At Texas Stadium in Irving, Tex., near Dallas, where the sky 
box concept was pioneered back in the early 1970s, the boxes are sold outright, 
with some fetching as much as $1.5 million during the oil boom a few years 
back. These days, one has to plunk down a mere $1 million to root for the 
Cowboys from the best sky box in the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
With such stratospheric price tags, some critics worry that the sky box 
phenomenon is ushering in a virtual caste system for spectators at professional 
sporting events. While ordinary fans cram into plastic seats and raise 
umbrellas when the rain falls, the sky box denizens lounge in 
climate-controlled suites, watch instant replays on wall-mounted televisions 
and sip champagne (up to $30 a bottle at the Big A). 
</P>
<P>
Robert Baade, an economics professor at Lake Forest College in Illinois who has 
studied the issue, suggested that sky boxes and other elite seating 
increasingly threaten to make professional sports "less democratic." Moreover, 
he noted that sky boxes have been constructed in many stadiums across the 
country with the help of taxpayers who have little opportunity to enjoy such 
privileged perches. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seems Unfair 
</P>
<P>
"It strikes me as unfair," Baade said. "To me, it smacks of inequity, and it's 
something that could potentially create social tensions. Maybe that's something 
we ought to be paying attention to." 
</P>
<P>
But social tension was nowhere to be seen in Poremba's sky box, which he leases 
with two partners at his Santa Fe Springs steel company and uses to entertain 
friends and customers. With the door wide open and smiles on their faces, 
Poremba and his cohorts greeted just about anyone who poked his head in, 
inviting him in for a beer or two or three. 
</P>
<P>
Though sky boxes are beginning to make an appearance in some baseball-only 
ballparks, the exclusive suites are largely controlled by National Football 
League teams, much as the Rams do. The boxes at the Big A were built by the 
city in 1980 as part of the effort to lure the Rams from Los Angeles. Anaheim 
now gets 20% of the sky box revenue to repay those construction costs. 
</P>
<P>
In the parity-conscious NFL, where television receipts and other big-ticket 
revenues are divvied up evenly among all 28 clubs in the league, sky boxes are 
one of the few economic bonanzas left for the home team. While regular ticket 
sales are shared with visiting teams, sky box revenue goes almost exclusively 
to the host outfit. 
</P>
<P>
Eager to bolster their profit picture, football teams increasingly have looked 
to sky boxes as a vital economic ox to gore. For teams such as the Chicago 
Bears and the Washington Redskins, the suites were perhaps the key reason that 
owners threatened in recent years to abandon venerable old stadiums for plush 
new accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the biggest repercussions have been in the Southland. Miffed by a 
dispute over construction of sky boxes at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, 
the Raiders have promised to move out of the city after the 1991 season, with 
Irwindale and Oakland among the destinations most often mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
"These suites are one of the few areas where a club has the opportunity to 
increase its revenue," the Rams' Donovan said. "One need only look at the other 
football team in Southern California to see the woes of not having these 
suites." 
</P>
<P>
But sky boxes have not been an unmitigated success for the Rams, either. 
Although the exclusive suites sold out virtually overnight in 1980, several sky 
box holders declined to renew their five-year leases when they expired in 1985. 
Since then, the team has worked hard to market the units, but about a dozen 
remain unoccupied. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Competing With Weather 
</P>
<P>
"The weather is our biggest competition," Donovan said. "It's just harder to 
market tickets in general here because the variety of options we have in 
Southern California compared to areas like the Midwest. And the same holds true 
for the suites." 
</P>
<P>
While Angels inherited their sky boxes when the Rams moved to the stadium, many 
baseball teams have been less eager to embrace the concept. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Cubs recently completed 67 executive suites they lease for between 
$45,000 and $65,000 annually at Wrigley Field. But such teams as the Los 
Angeles Dodgers have steadfastly refused to partake in the sky box explosion. 
Bob Smith, operations director at Dodger Stadium, said the team has looked into 
the concept but decided against it because too many longtime season ticket 
holders would have been displaced. 
</P>
<P>
"A sky box that would probably be occupied by just one company would take the 
place of up to 32 people in regular seats," Smith said. "You just can't kick 
them out like that. Most of them have been good customers since 1962." 
</P>
<P>
But if 7-year-old Andrew Walker is any indication, teams better start thinking 
twice before they rule out sky boxes. An avid T-ball player, the youth has 
accompanied his father, Bill, to many an Angel game and invariably prefers a 
comfortable sky box to lesser digs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Good Service 
</P>
<P>
"I like sitting in the boxes 'cause it's good service," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew has that right. The Anaheim Stadium suites offer enough amenities to 
please a President, as they did when George Bush recently enjoyed a game from 
the Arco sky box. 
</P>
<P>
Each is equipped with television sets mounted high on the walls, wet bars and 
ice-makers, private bathrooms, wall-to-wall carpeting and cushy, swiveling 
chairs. Patrons have the option of either sticking out a game hunkered inside 
the confines of the suite, or moving to orange plastic seats on the "club 
level" just outside the sky box. 
</P>
<P>
"If you sit inside, you have kind of a cocktail party atmosphere," said 
Janssen, who has used his company's box on scores of occasions to woo clients. 
"Go outside and you're right in the game. It's a nice mix of both." 
</P>
<P>
Food is delivered from one of three kitchens that fire up for football games 
(two will probably be used for the All-Star game). The menu is decidedly more 
upscale than the standard fare found in typical stadium concession stands. 
Aside from such staples as hot dogs and chili, sky box patrons can dine on 
chicken or pork ribs or shrimp, munch on cheeses and meats and fruits, sip on 
imported beers ($13 a six-pack) or a high-ball ($32 for a bottle of Chivas 
Regal). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Special Requests 
</P>
<P>
Linda McAndrew, catering manager for the stadium, said she expects to have 30 
employees outfitted in white shirts and black bow ties tending the needs of 
suite holders during the All-Star game (a typical night baseball game is 
staffed by a dozen). But box holders have yet to make any All-Star game 
requests for special foods or lavish spreads beyond what's normally offered, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
While every suite gets the same food, not all sky boxes are created equal. Some 
are cozy little cubicles with elbow room for about six adults at a time. Others 
can comfortably house 26 people. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the suite of Rams owner Georgia Frontiere. Decorated in soft woods 
and forest green carpet, the sky box is a two-story affair with a dramatic 
spiral staircase leading to Frontiere's private office and a lounge area. 
</P>
<P>
The Arco suite, meanwhile, has the exclusive services of Mary Cuevas, a private 
bartender who takes care of the food and beverage needs of guests in the box at 
every game. She has served the likes of the President, Governor George 
Deukmejian and former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach and expects the 
suite to be packed during the All-Star game with "top-notch corporate people" 
and their biggest customers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm usually busy until the seventh-inning stretch, when I bring out ice cream 
and brownies," Cuevas said. "They've really got it made in here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Customers Pampered 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the goal in the sky boxes is to pamper the customer, Donovan said. 
</P>
<P>
"Think of all the things that bother you when you go to the ballpark, and most 
of those are eliminated," he said. "You don't wait in line for food, you don't 
have to wait in line at the parking lot when the game is over, you don't have 
to worry about the temperature, you don't have to worry about missing a play, 
because most of them are replayed." 
</P>
<P>
Those television replays are a must feature for people such as Janssen, who 
admits he's often so busy attending to the needs of his customers that he 
hardly gets to see the game. 
</P>
<P>
"You're so wrapped up working a group as a salesman, you miss a lot," he said. 
"Most of the stuff I see is on instant replay during the football season." 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, the television sets can dominate the action. Janssen remembers 
well a veritable multi-sports feast, when he had one TV tuned to a Dodgers 
broadcast, another showing a Lakers game and the Rams playing outside. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1988 NBA playoffs, everyone in the sky box was so wrapped up in the 
basketball game on television that they turned the couches toward the TV set 
and virtually ignored the baseball game going on outside. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Going Bananas 
</P>
<P>
"When the Lakers would score, the group in here would go bananas," Janssen 
recalled. "Anyone outside within earshot could hear us." 
</P>
<P>
Janssen admits that ensconced in the company sky box he feels a bit like he's 
in a fishbowl looking out. He wishes everyone had an opportunity to enjoy the 
pleasures of a sky box. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes people sort of stare up at us," he said. "They think we've got all 
the money in the world here, but I just work for the company. Sometimes I wish 
we could just invite them all in."

If there's one thing that annoys Darrell Metzger, it's having people mistake 
Orange County for a suburb of Los Angeles. Or worse, having to politely explain 
that, yes, there is more to Orange County than Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
As president of the Orange County Centennial Committee, Metzger's job is to get 
that message out to the 15,000 visitors -- including 700 members of the media 
-- who have descended upon Anaheim for Tuesday's 60th Major League Baseball 
All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually," Metzger said, "I'd like to say 'Orange County' and have it mean 
something to somebody." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
National Spotlight 
</P>
<P>
In other cities that have hosted the All-Star game, local officials have tried 
to draw the national media spotlight to local economic opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
In Houston, for instance, the 1986 All-Star game meant a chance to dispel some 
of the gloom-and-doom reputation that had tarnished its image after the oil 
slump of the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes people think of Houston as a place to visit," said Barbara Weiner, 
director of public affairs for the Greater Houston Convention and Visitors 
Bureau. "It shows that things are going on all the time and that exciting 
things are happening." 
</P>
<P>
But in Anaheim, officials aren't worried about attracting tourist dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, a convention of Job's Daughters filled the hotel rooms where 
baseball fans are sleeping this week. And next week, they will be replaced by a 
national convention of evangelical Christians. 
</P>
<P>
So when it comes to the All-Star game, local organizers are more concerned 
about making a good impression than making money. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's the way it should be," said Allan B. Hughes, executive director 
of the Anaheim Chamber of Commerce. "I'd hate to turn it into an economic 
land-sale enterprise." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Chamber had not even prepared estimates of the game's economic 
impact on the area until a few days before the event. Officials with the 
Anaheim Area Visitors and Convention Bureau were in the process of compiling 
such estimates, but as of this weekend the figures were not available. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hughes, the All-Star game is expected to infuse more than $20 
million into the local economy, mostly benefiting the hotel and restaurant 
industries. That estimate is disputed by Tom Seeberg, All-Star coordinator for 
the host California Angels, who predicts that the game will generate closer to 
$40 million. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever amount the visitors spend, Metzger wants them to leave with good 
feelings about Orange County. To that end, the Centennial Committee was charged 
with coordinating an army of 500 volunteers, clad in crisp navy blue and white, 
who will greet people arriving at John Wayne, Los Angeles International and 
Ontario airports and staff hospitality booths at Anaheim hotels nearly 
around-the-clock. 
</P>
<P>
About 4,000 VIPs invited by Major League Baseball will be shuttled to Anaheim 
hotels aboard buses and vans accompanied by volunteers who will deliver a 
scripted introduction to the All-Star game, Orange County, and the centennial. 
Approved topics for discussion include the history of Orange County, 
corporations that sponsor the All-Star game, and, surprisingly, Southern 
California's chronic transportation problems.

For those unfortunate enough to be mired in traffic during the 50-mile drive 
from Los Angeles International to Anaheim, the Centennial Committee has 
thoughtfully provided copies of "100 Solutions to Traffic Problems in Orange 
County," a booklet prepared as part of the centennial, Metzger said. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's turn (the traffic problems) around to a plus and tell them what we're 
planning to do about it," Metzger said. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the list of "inappropriate" topics for discussion. Metzger 
declined to be specific about the topics beyond identifying one: which baseball 
players really deserved to make the All-Star roster. 
</P>
<P>
"It's common sense," he said. "We just want to keep the conversation in a 
positive vein." 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Angels and Major League Baseball say the celebration of Orange 
County's centennial this year was an important factor in deciding to award the 
All-Star game to Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
The All-Star proposal submitted by the Angels in 1983 included proclamations 
from all the county's cities welcoming the event as part of a year of 
centennial festivities. 
</P>
<P>
"There was real commitment to putting on the best possible event in Orange 
County," said David Dziedzic, director of special events for baseball. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels were able to satisfy the concerns of baseball officials in two 
important areas: transportation and accommodations. A detailed plan for 
shuttling visitors from airports to hotels was included in the Angels proposal, 
as was the availability of 2,700 hotel rooms at the Anaheim Hilton and Towers 
and the nearby Marriott. 
</P>
<P>
In places such as Houston and Cincinnati, which hosted All-Star games in 1986 
and 1988, local chambers of commerce and visitors bureaus were extensively 
involved in the event. For example, the Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce's ties 
to game organizers allowed the group to obtain 500 advance copies of the 
All-Star program to mail to business clients around the country, said Ruger 
Ruhl, the chamber's vice president for communications. 
</P>
<P>
In Anaheim, the involvement of local business groups has been minimal. 
</P>
<P>
"We're probably a little more blase," said Anaheim chamber director Hughes, 
"when we have millions who visit every year." 
</P>
<P>
The money All-Star visitors will spend this week is nothing "out of the 
ordinary," said Elaine Cali, a spokeswoman for the Anaheim Area Visitors and 
Convention Bureau. She noted that 4.3 million people vacationed in Orange 
County last July, and 34.6 million people visited last year. 
</P>
<P>
At the Anaheim Hilton, hotel representatives said they were pleased to be 
chosen as hosts for baseball players and officials who have booked 1,000 rooms. 
But the hotel is usually filled this time of year anyway, said Patrick Hynes, 
director of public relations. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Anaheim financial officials are not expecting the All-Star game to 
create a blip on their revenue charts. Anaheim benefits from out-of-town guests 
through a transient occupancy tax, or bed tax, that gives the city a percentage 
of hotel room proceeds, said Bill Sell, the city's treasury manager. He said 
the city had not planned on the game generating any extra revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more the prestige that comes from having the All-Star game" that matters, 
Sell said. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of public relations, the city of Anaheim has weighed in with a packet 
of press releases promoting stories on Anaheim Stadium's playing field, 
scoreboard, traffic control plan and parking lot. The city also is touting 
Disneyland, a local literacy program and the renovation of an apartment project 
through an unusual teaming of public and private efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Mayor Fred Hunter sides with those who believe that in terms of 
revenue, the All-Star game is not that big a deal. What matters, Hunter said, 
is selling Anaheim and Orange County to the media and to influential people in 
the sports world so that more big events can be brought to the city. 
</P>
<P>
"It is showing that we, the city of Anaheim, are doing a bang-up job on the 
All-Star game," Hunter said, "and that we could be a very good host to the 
Super Bowl, which we've never had."

1,000 TAKE PART IN CONFRONTATION AT ABORTION CLINIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR MERINA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 anti-abortion activists and pro-choice advocates taunted one 
another, set up rival picket lines and formed human blockades around a Tustin 
medical clinic on Saturday in one of several demonstrations staged nationwide 
after the Supreme Court handed down a controversial abortion ruling. 
</P>
<P>
The boisterous demonstration outside the Doctors' Family Planning facility in 
the Santa Ana-Tustin Medical Pavilion was the first in Southern California 
since the Supreme Court decided Monday that states can restrict abortions if 
they choose. 
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by the ruling, members of Operation Rescue, a militant anti-abortion 
group, had hoped to block the entrances of the facility where abortions are 
performed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opponents Were Waiting 
</P>
<P>
But when anti-abortion demonstrators arrived early Saturday, they were met by 
pro-choice activists who quickly locked arms and formed a wall of bodies 
intended to shield patients and keep the facility open. 
</P>
<P>
"There were no arrests made because there were no complaints from the clinic," 
said Capt. Steve Foster of the Tustin Police Department. "The clinic remained 
open, and patients were being seen." 
</P>
<P>
Operation Rescue officials disputed that contention, and one woman who 
identified herself as a clinic employee told anti-abortion demonstrators that a 
number of appointments had been rescheduled Saturday and that no abortions were 
performed. 
</P>
<P>
But Judi Larson, executive director of the Doctors' Family Planning Medical 
Group Inc., insisted that the majority of patients were seen as scheduled. 
"Several patients chose to terminate their pregnancies this morning, and that 
was done," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the Tustin demonstration was largely nonviolent, although tempers 
flared and a few people reported minor injuries from shoving matches. Previous 
demonstrations this year in Southern California resulted in hundreds of 
arrests. Officers who arrived from several Orange County communities prepared 
for an unruly crowd spent the day merely watching both sides wage a battle of 
songs, chants, protest signs and prayers. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, each group declared it was the victor. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that we accomplished our goals to rescue babies that were immediately 
in danger," said Elaine Bingham, an Operation Rescue spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Councilman Attends 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Earl J. Prescott, one of two Tustin City Council members who had 
earlier expressed opposition to the clinic, praised the demonstrators for 
choosing the clinic as a target. "Thanks for coming to Tustin," he said. "There 
was no killing over there today." 
</P>
<P>
Pro-choice advocates were equally elated about the hours-long standoff. 
</P>
<P>
"I am absolutely thrilled," said Margie Seigle, executive director of Planned 
Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino counties. "I think we have stated that 
Orange County is pro-choice and we will not tolerate the lawlessness of 
Operation Rescue." 
</P>
<P>
And after the demonstrations, Robin Schneider, executive director of the 
California Abortion Rights Action League South, told cheering supporters: "We 
confronted them today, and we beat them. And not only did we beat them, we beat 
them with style." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Latest Skirmish 
</P>
<P>
The clash between the two groups was the latest in a series of skirmishes that 
began in February when Operation Rescue first appeared in Southern California 
to carry out part of its nationwide campaign to shut down abortion clinics. It 
was also one of the most peaceful for a day that saw demonstrations scattered 
nationwide from Brookline, Mass., to Denver. 
</P>
<P>
No one was arrested in Brookline, but police reported 61 arrests in Chicago, 58 
in Milwaukee, 50 in Denver, 41 in Dallas and 27 in Miami. Most of the arrests 
involved people who attempted to block entrances to buildings where abortions 
are performed. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion clinics and police had braced themselves for another round of 
demonstrations this weekend after the U. S. Supreme Court on Monday upheld a 
Missouri law that forbids abortions in public hospitals and bans public 
employees from assisting abortions in any way. 
</P>
<P>
Although the justices did not overturn the landmark 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling 
that legalized abortion, their ruling marked a departure from the court's 
long-established practice of striking down nearly all state restrictions on 
abortions.

40-YEAR-OLD TACO STAND WILL HAVE TO SIT OUT '90S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Everything seemed so much easier, almost innocent, when Joe Cano got started. 
It was 1949 -- Disneyland didn't exist, and the term fast food had yet to be 
coined -- when a young Cano opened a small Mexican restaurant in north Anaheim, 
serving tacos, tostadas and burritos to anyone with a few dimes to spend on a 
hot meal. 
</P>
<P>
He called it the La Palma Drive-In Restaurant (his patrons dubbed it the "Bean 
Hut" in reference to the spicy beans he served), and for the next 40 years, 
Cano's little taco stand stood amid a sea of development and change. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the long era of the La Palma Drive-In came to a close, as Cano 
helped clear the restaurant of its last furnishings. The old Bean Hut is going 
the way of the rest of Orange County and is being upgraded; it will become a 
dental office. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Peak of Popularity 
</P>
<P>
At its peak of popularity in the late 1950s and 1960s, Cano said, the 
restaurant catered to as many as 1,000 high school kids on weekend nights. 
People got married there, danced there and ogled the celebrities who stopped by 
for a quick burrito. 
</P>
<P>
"The Righteous Brothers used to come around, and every Friday night you'd see 
Marlon Brando here," said Cano, 62. "He'd come by after picking up his son from 
the St. Catherine's military school. We never bothered him. But he was a 
regular." 
</P>
<P>
With success, the little taco stand at 940 N. Anaheim Blvd. near La Palma 
expanded, eventually added curb service, a restaurant and a piano bar. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Business Was Better 
</P>
<P>
"I operated it for 33 years and then leased it out," Cano said. "It didn't do 
so well after that. But we used to have a big business. People from all over 
would come there. The No. 4 plate was our best seller. Let's see, that was a 
combination plate of a taco, tostada and enchilada." 
</P>
<P>
Suzette Cano, Cano's niece, said she remembers it having "a kind of 'Happy 
Days' atmosphere. Kids would sneak out of their houses to come down to see 
everyone. There would be car clubs there, people from Long Beach and all over. 
It's kind of sad to see it go." 
</P>
<P>
For Joe Cano, the end did not come without a dose of nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now," he said, "I feel like crying. I actually spent more than half of 
my life there." 
</P>
<P>
Cano has no connection with the large Cano's Restaurant in Newport Beach, he 
said.

DEADLY FORCE SETS OFF INVESTIGATION, LONG PROCESS OF SECOND-GUESSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BEENE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The decision to use deadly force is often made in a millisecond, but the 
investigations and legal reviews on the shooting can often run into years. 
</P>
<P>
Although the process varies throughout the state, in Orange County it is 
standard practice that the district attorney's office investigates each case in 
which a police officer fires his or her weapon in anger or in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
Officials defend this procedure as a way of avoiding criticism that comes when 
police agencies investigate their officers, hoping that the use of an 
independent, outside agency such as the district attorney's office will put 
more faith into the outcome of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"Law enforcement enjoys autonomy and traditionally is uneasy about other 
agencies coming in and looking at the use of force," said Loren W. DuChesne, 
head of investigations for the district attorney's office. "This way there is 
more credibility in the result. That is what everyone -- the family, the police 
agency, everyone -- is interested in. This offers less a chance for the 
appearance of bias and favoritism." 
</P>
<P>
According to DuChesne, 17 investigators are on 24-hour call to respond to any 
police shooting and often arrive just minutes after the incident. The 
investigators immediately begin questioning witnesses and gathering the 
evidence, calling in a mobile crime-scene van to help in the investigation, and 
set a time when the officer can be debriefed at length as to exactly what 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
In the interim, the officer is often put with a support partner who comforts 
him during the initial stages of the investigation. When his gun is taken by 
DuChesne's investigators as evidence, the police department replaces it with 
another weapon. 
</P>
<P>
While DuChesne's shooting team conducts its investigation, a number of other 
things are happening simultaneously. A parallel investigation by the police 
agency may be under way, not into the shooting itself but into other 
circumstances surrounding the incident, such as if the suspect had been dealing 
narcotics or was suspected of another crime. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, some police unions and associations have standing policies that if 
an officer feels the need, he can call an association attorney to represent him 
immediately at the scene of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"We only do it if we are asked," said Don Blankenship, president of the Santa 
Ana Police Benevolent Assn. "Having the lawyer there doesn't constitute an 
adversarial role. He is there to make sure all the officer's rights are being 
afforded and he (the officer) is thinking clearly before he writes his report 
or gives any statements." 
</P>
<P>
After collecting evidence and interviewing the officer, DuChesne's 
investigators then compile a report on the shooting, which is sent to a 
coroner's review board consisting of a toxicologist, an investigator, a lawyer 
from the district attorney's office, expert consultants and a representative of 
the police department. 
</P>
<P>
The final report is sent to a deputy district attorney, who then rules on the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation into the shooting can be a long one, taking four to five 
months before a case is finally resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"There is probably no case more difficult than a serious injury or death at the 
hands of a police officer," DuChesne said. "Every jail death and shooting can 
be expected to make the front page. That is the kind of media attention you can 
expect. There is a tremendous amount of pressure on the officers and this 
office. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is second-guessed and scrutinized as much as a jail death or an 
officer-involved shooting. What we do is eventually opened to the most 
detailed, microscopic scrutiny. We take all these cases very seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Often, DuChesne said, the officer who fired the gun may be one of the last 
persons interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
"You make sure the officer is capable of being interviewed," he said. "Is he 
coherent? You allow him to call his family. You keep him busy. You give him a 
support partner. You have to remain cognizant that he is undergoing a very 
stressful situation. 
</P>
<P>
"These are stressful interviews," DuChesne said, "because perhaps for the first 
time the cop is on the other side. They are apprehensive. They are very 
uncomfortable." 
</P>
<P>
In his 11 years as head of investigations for the district attorney's office, 
DuChesne said that only once was a law-enforcement officer prosecuted, and that 
was for the non-fatal beating of a jail inmate. 
</P>
<P>
Two other times the cases were so difficult to decide that they went to a grand 
jury, and in both of those cases the officers were cleared of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I think it speaks well for Orange County law enforcement," he 
said. "But there is never a simple cut-and-dried case of law enforcement's use 
of force. At some point in time you are going to have an issue. Somewhere there 
is going to be a controversy about what happened."

MINTON DOESN'T GET WIN OR SAVE, BUT HE PITCHES IN WITH SCORELESS RELIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, Times Staff Writer

<P>
As reporters huddled around starting pitcher Jim Abbott in the Angels' 
clubhouse Saturday afternoon, Greg Minton sat alone on a stool a few feet away, 
his right elbow and shoulder packed in ice. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the illustrious world of middle relief pitching. 
</P>
<P>
Making his first appearance since coming off the 15-day disabled list with an 
elbow injury, Minton pitched 1 2/3 innings of scoreless relief in a 4-1 Angel 
victory over the Minnesota Twin.s. He didn't earn the victory. That went to 
Abbott. 
</P>
<P>
And he didn't get the save, which went to Bryan Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
But what Minton did get was 16 pitches in a game -- something he had waited for 
since June 22. The 37-year-old right-hander also ended a threat by the Twins in 
the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like opening day for me," Minton said. "They (Angels) are paying me an 
awful lot of money to go 1 1/3 innings. Today was perfect. I was the stopgap 
between Abbott and Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
"I got us out of the inning, and that's all I want to do. I want to be like the 
offensive line in football. There's no notoriety in what I do." 
</P>
<P>
But it beats sitting on the bench, which is where Minton has been since 
injuring his right elbow while warming up in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
"I pitched in 30 of our first 65 games," Minton said. "I was warming up for my 
fourth straight game. My elbow just let go a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors diagnosed it as a strained flexor tendon, the same injury that 
sidelined him for nine weeks at the start of last season. 
</P>
<P>
As a precautionary measure, Angel manager Doug Rader put Minton on the 15-day 
disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
"Doug called me and said 'You're going on the DL,' " Minton said. "Then I said, 
'But Doug.' And he said 'Shut up, you're going on the DL.' I was taking a 
vacation and I didn't have much to say about it." 
</P>
<P>
But it was hardly a vacation. Trainers used hot and cold packs and cortisone on 
his elbow. He lifted so many weights that he was ready for the Olympic 
weightlifting team. 
</P>
<P>
His "vacation" ended Saturday with one out in the seventh inning. The Twins 
were trailing, 3-1, with runners on first and second when Rader replaced Abbott 
with Minton. 
</P>
<P>
On his first pitch, Minton forced pinch-hitter Randy Bush to ground into a 
double play to end the inning. Minton gave up a double to Greg Gagne in the 
eighth and Harvey took the mound in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have any velocity on my pitches," said Minton, who threw two sliders 
and 14 sinkers. "I concentrated on where to put the ball. That's one of the 
things about being an old . . ., you know what you're doing out there." 
</P>
<P>
Angel pitching coach Marcel Lachemann said Minton gives experience to the Angel 
pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
"He has been a premier closing pitcher in his time," Lachemann said. "He helps 
the younger pitchers like Harvey. He knows his role." 
</P>
<P>
Minton returned to a team leading the AL West Division with one of the best 
pitching staffs in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to like this," said Minton, who spent 10 years with the San Francisco 
Giants before coming to the Angels in 1987. "I played with the Giants too long. 
I remember playing in front of 660 fans one night." 
</P>
<P>
Now he's contributing to a team in the midst of a division race. 
</P>
<P>
"If my arm holds up, I can go 30 more games and we have a very good chance to 
win the division," he said. "If I can keep on being the offensive line and help 
us win, I'll wear a (World Series) ring and be proud of it."

A SWEATSHOP WITH CHARACTER ; 
</P>
<P>
SINCE 1970S, WESTMINSTER BOXING CLUB HAS GIVEN YOUNGSTERS A FIGHTNG CHANCE TO 
BE SUCCESSFUL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Say this for the Westminster Boxing Club: The place has character. And it also 
draws its share of characters. 
</P>
<P>
The club, on Locust Avenue near an unfinished furniture store on Westminster 
Avenue, used to be a sweatshop. But the garment manufacturer that occupied the 
building for years left in the late 1960s. It stayed empty for more than a 
decade, so the club moved in and turned it back into a sweatshop. 
</P>
<P>
On a steamy July afternoon, Mike (Choo Choo) Chavez sits out front in a folding 
metal chair trying to beat the heat. Chavez is the rotund executive director 
and co-founder of the club. 
</P>
<P>
He and Carlos Palomino started the club in the early 1970s, finding equipment 
and a place to set it up wherever they could. 
</P>
<P>
"It took about five years before we got our doors open full time," Chavez said. 
</P>
<P>
The club spent about four years in a building on Golden West Street, then moved 
to its current location about six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Palomino went on to win the World Boxing Council welterweight title in 1976 and 
earn a tidy little nest egg from boxing. Chavez stayed behind, ran for the city 
council in Westminster that same year, lost, and pushed and prodded to find the 
club a permanent home. 
</P>
<P>
He hasn't made a cent off the club, which is a non-profit United Way agency, 
but he has reaped rewards in ways that have little monetary value. His vocation 
is automobile mechanic, but his avocation is the boxing club. 
</P>
<P>
George Garcia, a 31-year-old house painter and super bantamweight fighter, 
pulls up in his van when he sees Chavez sitting out front. 
</P>
<P>
He needs some help. His brakes have been making a terrible squeaking sound and 
he's worried about them. "Hey Choo Choo, maybe you can have a look later?" 
Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia has been coming to the club since he was in his early teens. He figures 
Chavez, the club and boxing have straightened out his life at least twice. 
</P>
<P>
Without the club, Garcia said he would be drinking in a nearby park with his 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
"It gave me a place to go to and spend time away from the park," Garcia said. 
"Now, I've got something in my heart that's going to push me." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia had his first professional fight in 1978, fighting a succession of 
no-names until he got a shot at the big time against Richard Sandoval in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"He owned him for seven rounds," Chavez said. But Sandoval rallied for a 
10-round decision. The next year, Sandoval won a world bantamweight title in 
Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, who went on to hold the state bantamweight and super bantamweight 
titles, recently ended a three-year layoff and returned to the ring. 
</P>
<P>
In June he upset Jesus Poll, who had fought for the World Boxing Assn. title 
two months earlier, in a 10-round decision at the Reseda Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
"George and another kid, whose name I've forgotten, came here as little kids," 
Chavez said. "They were fighting some surfers." 
</P>
<P>
And that put them into the first of about three categories of youngsters who 
show up at Chavez's door. 
</P>
<P>
First are the tough kids, looking, whether they realize it or not, for a 
constructive outlet for their energies. 
</P>
<P>
Second are the kids who only think they're tough. They usually don't last long. 
Kids who think they're tough don't like doing 100 sit-ups day after day, Chavez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Third are the kids who really want to box, these are fewer in number, but more 
dedicated and coachable. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez takes them all in, regardless of age or background. 
</P>
<P>
"But," he said. "we don't baby-sit them. They gotta work or get out." 
</P>
<P>
The club is painted battleship gray with a touch of blue trim here and there. 
Small lettering above one of the doors reads:

</P>
<P>
Six worn-out, heavy bags hang from the ceiling. On crowded days, boxers trade 
off hitting the bags. 
</P>
<P>
Some skip rope, keeping time as the rope beats methodically under foot. Others 
punch speed bags with a furious, non-stop energy. 
</P>
<P>
A few boxers pound gloves held by trainers as they move around the bare 
concrete floor. "Here, hit this," one says to the fighter he's working with, 
holding up a glove. The youngster pounds away with a right cross. 
</P>
<P>
And still others bob and weave in front of several mirrors placed around the 
club. 
</P>
<P>
There are two rings wedged into one corner of the 4,500 square-foot building. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, the club has age-group amateur tournaments, but mostly it's a 
place to work out and learn to box. 
</P>
<P>
Fighters in gray, blue and black outfits dance lightly around the rings on the 
balls of their feet, trading heavy blows. Trainers, all of them volunteers, 
watch with a carefully attuned eye. 
</P>
<P>
To younger boxers, they holler an endless stream of advice. "Move. Stick. 
Harder. Now back off. Now stick. Jab. That's it." 
</P>
<P>
They also fine-tune the volleys of the professionals. Even experienced fighters 
need endless hours of teaching, particularly before a fight. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, a harsh-sounding buzzer rings out and all action stops. The fighters 
jog in place, catching their breath while trying to stay loose. After 60 
seconds, the buzzer sounds again and everyone resumes their workout. 
</P>
<P>
It's like this each afternoon. Three minutes of work, followed by a minute of 
rest, in a fixed pattern. 
</P>
<P>
The boxers are surrounded by posters. Leonard vs. LaLonde. Fight night at the 
Forum. Richard Sandoval. 
</P>
<P>
Yellowing newspaper clippings are posted on a board on one wall. 
</P>
<P>
There's Paul Gonzales, the 1984 Olympian, posing with Chavez and other club 
officials. Willie deWit, the Canadian heavyweight, pounds a bag in another 
picture. Garcia is pictured in another. Nearby is a lengthy article on the 
Yuppie following that the Irvine Marriott's monthly program has developed. 
</P>
<P>
All that seems a long way from 14042 Locust Ave. in Westminster on a warm 
summer afternoon. But that's why many of the 30 boxers punch and skip rope and 
listen attentively to their trainers. They want to walk into the limelight as 
professional boxers. 
</P>
<P>
David Ramirez, a 15-year-old junior-to-be at Westminster High School, has been 
coming to the club about 11 months. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of our most promising young fighters," Chavez said, pointing out 
Ramirez, who batters a speed bag in one corner of the gym. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something I've always wanted to do," said Ramirez, dripping sweat during 
a rest interval. "I looked into it last year and came down to the club." 
</P>
<P>
He has been coming daily ever since in hopes of becoming the next George 
Garcia. Or the next Carlos Palomino. 
</P>
<P>
Noe Cruz, a retired roofer, also comes to the gym every day. He started 
training Palomino in 1968 at the old Stanton Boxing Club. He also has worked 
with the Quarry brothers, Mike and Jerry. Cruz can reel off a page-worth of 
other names, but only a few are recognizable. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, Cruz works with younger amateurs such as Ramirez. He also hands down 
his training knowledge to Chavez and the other young trainers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be gone soon," Cruz said. "I could keep all the knowledge with 
me, but that's no good. I like to share it. (Chavez) is younger. He can pass it 
on. He's the one I've picked to pass it on." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, too, spends time with the younger boxers trying to pass on the hints he 
has learned in his years in the fight game. It helps him stay involved. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not just trying to teach the kids to box," Garcia said. "There's more to 
it than that. This club has touched my life. If I would have been like this 
from the git-go, I'd be a lot better off now."

TIRELESS WATCHERS LOOK FOR SHOPLIFTERS

Anne Droid looks like a typical mannequin, except for an unusual twinkle in one 
eye. That twinkle means Anne Droid can "see" you. She can also "hear" and even 
"remember." 
</P>
<P>
Anne Droid is a surveillance mannequin designed to watch for shoplifters, an 
idea that has caught the eye of some retailers. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife is a jeweler," says F. Jerry Gutierrez, Anne Droid's creator. "We were 
in a jewelry store and they had a TV monitor set up, but I couldn't find the 
camera. Then the jeweler showed me this tiny thing, and I thought, 'My God, 
that would fit in a mannequin.' " 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Gutierrez's job was to restore mannequins -- a business he started 
when he was laid off as a carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the 40-year-old Gutierrez has designed a line of mannequins with built-in 
cameras and microphones, which he hopes business owners will use to fight 
shoplifting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Miniature Camera 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez inserts a miniature camera behind a mannequin eye, and the image is 
projected on a monitor that can be viewed privately. For sound, a microphone is 
placed in one nostril. Everything the mannequin sees or hears can be recorded 
on videotape. 
</P>
<P>
"It's got a perspective no other surveillance system has," said Eric Freehling, 
who owns Odyssey Jewelry and Watch Out Watches in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
He said when he first heard about Gutierrez's mannequins he was interested only 
in getting one for his store. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was a heck of an idea," Freehling says. "Then I realized he 
didn't have as much of a business background as he needed to get off the 
ground. With my CPA background and a lot of experience in retail, I told him 
I'd see if I could help." 
</P>
<P>
A partnership developed, as did a spinoff from the mannequin restoration 
business called Anne Droid Security Systems. Freehling pitched in $115,000 to 
help launch it. 
</P>
<P>
Basic security mannequins cost about $2,400, not including extras like a 
time-lapse VCR, Gutierrez said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Television Watcher 
</P>
<P>
"One gentleman travels a lot, and he wants to have a male mannequin that would 
'watch' television to give the appearance someone is home," he said. "If that 
wasn't a deterrent the mannequin would double as security for him" by recording 
anyone entering the room. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez said he has an order for 10 mannequins from a major Denver retailer 
but wouldn't give the company's name and did not say how many he's sold 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
"This is covert surveillance," he explained. "Some businesses don't want the 
customers to know they are being watched." 
</P>
<P>
Shoplifting and employee theft cost the nation $508 billion annually, said 
Detective Gail Riddell, who heads the Denver police shoplifting unit. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's an interesting idea," said Susan Henderson, owner of Bikboks, a 
store in a tony Denver shopping district. She has ordered a male Anne Droid for 
delivery in the fall and plans to use it for nighttime surveillance.

AT SOME GOLF CLUBS, COST IS A DEFINITE HANDICAP

The price of membership in golf clubs is appreciating even faster than Orange 
County real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Membership at Mesa Verde Country Club now costs $60,000, compared to $40,000 a 
year ago. Over the same time, the cost of membership at Yorba Linda Country 
Club has more than doubled to about $37,000 from $16,000. And at El Niguel 
Country Club in Laguna Niguel, the price of membership has soared to $72,000 
from $35,000 over the last 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
At Big Canyon Country Club in Newport Beach, a membership most recently sold 
for about $145,000, according to members who asked not to be identified because 
the club has a policy against discussing costs. Some of the memberships are 
held by people who bought them for $7,500 when the club opened in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
Club memberships are "a great investment," said Sharon Polster, general manager 
at El Niguel. "Better than real estate." 
</P>
<P>
At some clubs like Big Canyon, El Niguel and Yorba Linda, the members are 
allowed to sell their memberships for whatever the market will bear, while at 
other facilities like Mesa Verde, the club determines the selling price. 
</P>
<P>
Just how much of the profit is pocketed by the seller depends on each club's 
policy. Some memberships entitle a golfer only to use of the facilities and 
cannot be resold. All clubs claim some percentage of the sales price, starting 
at 20%. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Lober, general manager of Mesa Verde, warns would-be speculators against 
buying club memberships for investment purposes. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had an idea someone applying to be a member was in it to make money, he 
wouldn't be accepted," Lober said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the initiation fees, golf club members are obliged to pay hefty monthly 
dues. "If someone is going to pay dues of $350 to $300 a month, he has got to 
be pretty serious about the game," Lober said. LESLIE BERKMAN

STOCK WATCH: IT'S BACK ON THE NASDAQ SYSTEM, BUT SCIENTIFIC NRG'S TROUBLES 
AREN'T OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scientific NRG resumed trading on the NASDAQ over-the-counter market system 
Thursday after a six-month absence imposed because its assets had fallen below 
the minimum amount required to be listed. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Anaheim company is back among those listed on the National Assn. 
of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system (the only automated quotation 
system for the over-the-counter market), its comeback could be short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
Scientific, which manufactures light fixtures, was given six months to get its 
total assets above $750,000 when it was dropped from NASDAQ in December. 
</P>
<P>
In April, Scientific received an order worth at least $525,000 from Denny's 
restaurants, which had helped raise its assets base to about $930,000 as of 
June 30, the last day of its fiscal 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the company's most recent filing with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission indicates that Scientific still has serious problems. 
</P>
<P>
Its working capital, for instance, fell from the $1.5 million it had as of June 
30, 1986, to just $216,068 as of March 31, 1989. Analysts often use the working 
capital figure to gauge a company's financial health. 
</P>
<P>
"In order for the company to continue in business, additional capital will need 
to be raised and revenues will need to increase substantially," the company's 
management warned investors in its latest filing to the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
"We've come a long way, but there is a lot of work to be done," said Mark 
Morris, Scientific president and chief executive. He said the company is 
considering a variety of measures to improve its financial position, including 
being acquired by a larger corporation. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the problems, there are a couple of bright spots in Scientific's recent 
financial reports. For instance, the company reported that sales increased 
nearly 28% for the fiscal 1989 third quarter, to $432,400 from $311,920 for the 
same period the year before. For the same period, the company's losses fell to 
$10,500 from the $32,163 reported for that period in the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Scientific is, however, heavily dependent on two customers. Sales to Denny's 
and to Restaurant Enterprises Group accounted for 36.6% of its sales totals for 
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"A fair and honest appraisal would require admitting in many respects we are a 
one- to two-customer company and in some respects a one-product company," 
Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
Scientific's common stock closed Friday at 34 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
A group of investors that includes several Mission Viejo executives has bought 
a 6.3% stake in a New Jersey-based manufacturer of prefabricated pools and pool 
products and has indicated that it may try to initiate a merger. 
</P>
<P>
Several officers of Girard Corp., a Mission Viejo holding company, have 
disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that they may try to 
place its chairman, Laurent H. Girard Jr., on the board of Heldor Industries 
Inc. They also said they may attempt to merge Heldor with another company. 
</P>
<P>
The investor group holds 233,200 shares of Heldor common stock, including 
142,100 shares bought between April 3 and May 30 for $381,785. 
</P>
<P>
Executives at Heldor and at Girard Corp. were unavailable for further comment. 
</P>
<P>
Heldor stock closed Friday at $2.13 a share, up 13 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Belcor Inc. said it has paid $1.2 million and exchanged 500,000 shares of its 
common stock in order to acquire a computer service company. The Irvine maker 
of polyethylene bags and other products bought Finite Graphics of Camarillo as 
part of its continuing effort to diversify. 
</P>
<P>
Finite sets up computer hardware and software packages to help clients tackle 
problems unique to their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Belcor closed Friday at 62.5 cents a share in over-the-counter trading, 
unchanged for the week.

BRITAIN'S BOOMING POWERBOAT INDUSTRY SETS COURSE TOWARD U.S. MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY ANDERSON, The Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LONDON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Britain's small but booming powerboat industry is riding a wave of success 
toward the American market. 
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping to find a market for high-quality, high-performance, stylish 
boats," said Hans Wallberg, export liaison manager of one of the United 
Kingdom's top powerboat manufacturers, Sunseeker International, which is 
leading the way across the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
The North American market -- the largest in the world -- has long been a 
difficult area for British boat builders to penetrate, but Wallberg hopes that 
English craftsmanship will meet the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not Americanizing the product," he said. "We are selling a prestigious 
British product in much the same way as Jaguar does its cars." 
</P>
<P>
In a small-boat industry that last year contributed $157 million (100 million 
pounds) to the British balance of trade, the power-cruiser sector is surging. 
Exports of luxury British-made powerboats more than doubled in value between 
1985 and 1988, from $54.5 million to $121.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Throughout the 1980s, the United Kingdom boat market has followed a 
progressively upward path which shows little sign of tailing off," said Peter 
Gregory, chairman of the British Marine Industries Federation's marketing 
committee. "Power-cruiser builders are reaping the richest rewards, with 70% of 
boats exported." 
</P>
<P>
The British may be enviously eyeing American shores, but the Americans are 
already over there -- in bulk. 
</P>
<P>
The weak dollar had, until recently, made U.S. boat prices very competitive in 
Europe, and U.S. dealers have made the most of it. "The United States dominates 
80% of the world powerboat market," Wallberg said, but he sees a positive side 
to the American invasion of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"They have opened markets that we haven't been able to reach because we're not 
big enough," he said. "They have helped the market grow -- something we would 
hope to exploit in future." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sunseeker has crossed the ocean and set up a production company in 
Canada in an attempt to find a niche in the American market. Their factory just 
outside Montreal has started making two Sunseekers, the Mohawk 29 and the 
Martinique 36. 
</P>
<P>
"Americans are selling low-priced into Europe," Wallberg said. "We will try and 
sell high-priced, quality boats in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
The 29-footer starts at about $121,000 while the 36-footer starts at $182,000, 
the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Compelling financial reasons made a trans-Atlantic move a necessity. "Marketing 
practices in the United States are vastly different to those of Europe," 
Wallberg said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's the problem of fluctuating exchange rates, which recently have been 
rarely favorable. And most important, base equipment, such as engines, which 
represent a high proportion of each unit's cost, are much cheaper in the United 
States than they are here in Europe. We just couldn't have competed from 
England." 
</P>
<P>
Initial reaction to their product has been encouraging, according to Wallberg. 
"The first demonstration boats for America have just been completed, and 
indications are favorable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"With the size of the North American market," he said, "it is quite possible 
that production on the other side of the Atlantic will before long outstrip 
that of our British base."
