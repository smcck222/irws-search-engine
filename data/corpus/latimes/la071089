SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: TORREY PINES 'DRIVE-BYS' ARE TEEING OFF MOTORISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the driving range at the Torrey Pines Golf Course was shifted a year ago 
to a grassy new spot parallel to North Torrey Pines Road, golfers rejoiced. 
</P>
<P>
The old range had been a soggy cow pasture. 
</P>
<P>
But the boys in Risk Management at San Diego City Hall soon began groaning 
about the new range. A tall net notwithstanding, damage claims began to mount 
as motorists complained about slicing balls breaking their windshields and 
denting their hoods. 
</P>
<P>
The drivers were harassing the drivers, you might say. There's even an arch 
term for it: Torrey Pines drive-bys. 
</P>
<P>
"The errant golf ball is not an unfamiliar item when a golf course is next to a 
roadway," said claims manager Jerry Johnson. He started authorizing payments 
the day the range opened. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the possibilities, if even the tiniest fraction of balls go awry. 
</P>
<P>
On a busy 15-hour day at the range, upward of 25,000 balls are airborne. And 
North Torrey Pines is no chump road. 
</P>
<P>
North Torrey Pines connects Del Mar and La Jolla. People who drive Porsches and 
BMWs and know the definition of liability and tort use North Torrey Pines Road. 
</P>
<P>
Balboa Park Golf Course had a similar problem, but things are better now. The 
Torrey Pines problem has been particularly stubborn. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's the sea breezes; maybe the golfers can't swing straight. Nobody 
knows. 
</P>
<P>
Several cures have been tried. The tees were moved south; the tees were moved 
north; the tees were realigned; the net was hiked to 60 feet, tapering to 40. 
</P>
<P>
A consultant from Tustin has been hired. One idea is to hike the net even 
higher, but it's unclear if the Coastal Commission will approve or if the 
supporting poles can handle added height. 
</P>
<P>
The latest city stratagem requires driving-range employees to have both golfing 
acumen and tact. 
</P>
<P>
Employees have been told to size up which golfers look likely to have incurable 
slices and then gently suggest that they move as far from the road as possible. 
Don't ask how I know this. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Double Licking 
</P>
<P>
If conversation starts to drag, here are two suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
* Gunther Gebel-Williams, who arrives in San Diego on Tuesday with Ringling 
Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, has suffered more than 500 stitches in 
four decades as an animal trainer. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen or so were needed when a tiger draped around his neck took a swipe at 
him during the filming of an American Express commercial. 
</P>
<P>
* Is designer ice cream finished? Gelato expired? Haagen-Dazs dead? 
</P>
<P>
The latest rage on the North County coast is a Dairy Queen that opened last 
month in Solana Beach. The smart set from Del Mar and Rancho Santa Fe is 
enjoying its exotic recipe: ice milk. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Holy Bat Conservation! 
</P>
<P>
Update: Bat Conservation International, urging compassion for the misunderstood 
mammals, is now part of the battle over bats roosting at Olivenhain Town Hall. 
</P>
<P>
A BCI official and a state bat specialist toured the hall last week, tiptoeing 
through ankle-deep guano. After the bats migrate, the Town Council plans to 
spend a $138,000 state grant to seal up the walls and roof. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, BCI wants to cool fears that some of the bats may be rabid and has 
offered to do tests on any dead bat found in Olivenhain. 
</P>
<P>
Just keep the bat carcass in the refrigerator until a BCI member can pick it 
up, the group says. So far, no takers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An 'A' for Ambitious 
</P>
<P>
There are 189,600 public school teachers in California. 
</P>
<P>
So naturally State Schools Supt. Bill Honig on Friday picked Sharon Rogers, 
late of La Jolla Country Day private school, to serve on a new task force to 
"help shape California's elementary schools in the new decade and the next 
century." 
</P>
<P>
Is the politically ambitious Honig trying to benefit from the public support 
for Rogers since the March 10 bombing of her van? Heavens no, says a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Honig asked Rogers to join the task force "because he feels this is a good time 
for educators to stand up for each other."

GOT A BEEF? MEDIATORS HELP SOOTHE FESTERING DISPUTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many of the cases sound like candidates for "The People's Court." Such as the 
ones that could appropriately be named "Move Your Fence or I'll Move Your Face" 
or "This Apartment's Not Big Enough for the Two of Us." Then there was the 
mother-daughter summer vacation dispute that might well have been titled, 
"Whose Life Is It Anyway?" And who could forget "Get Your Eugenia Berries Off 
My White Carpet!" 
</P>
<P>
Those and hundreds of other cases likely would end up clogging local court 
calendars were it not for a growing and widely praised mediation program that 
offers a quicker, cheaper alternative to the legal system in settling disputes. 
</P>
<P>
Under action taken by the San Diego County Board of Supervisors last month, the 
Community Mediation Program, which has proved successful over the past six 
years within the city of San Diego, will be expanded countywide in an effort to 
alleviate the backlog of civil cases in Municipal and Superior courts. 
</P>
<P>
Unencumbered by formal courtroom procedures, the mediation program brings 
people together in an informal, but still structured, hearing intended not so 
much to determine who is right or wrong as it is to simply settle the 
disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of mediation isn't to find the truth -- it's to find a solution," 
said Liz Underell, the program's director. "We don't think in terms of good 
guys and bad guys, or victims and guilty parties. Worrying about who's right or 
wrong doesn't move you on -- it just keeps you stuck where you are." 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors' approval last month of a $300,000 contract will allow the 
program's staff of 125 volunteer mediators to be expanded by about 100 
mediators by next June, county administrators said. Each mediator will undergo 
27 hours of training before being assigned to dispute hearings, which will be 
held at about two dozen locations throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of 1986 state legislation, San Diego County plans to finance 
expansion of the program through a $3 surcharge on all civil suits filed in 
local Municipal and Superior courts. The city of San Diego, which has helped to 
underwrite the program since 1985, also has agreed to contribute $75,000 during 
the next fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Disputes that end up in mediation range from rather mundane squabbles between 
neighbors -- a genre that Underell describes as 
"your-tree-is-dripping-in-my-pool or your-dog-is-barking-too-loud cases" -- to 
complex complaints involving issues such as construction defects, product 
liability and labor-management differences. In some, money is only a peripheral 
issue and the dollar amounts at stake are small, while others involve 
settlements reaching hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
However, Charles Wiggins, a law professor at the University of San Diego, where 
a prototype of the mediation program was developed in 1983, cautions against 
dismissing any of the seemingly minor mediation cases as trivialities that 
simply indulge individuals' hardheadedness and litigious instincts by providing 
a quasi-legal forum to air petty differences. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these cases are trivial only in monetary terms, not in emotional 
terms," Wiggins said. "If you're involved, it's very important to you. In fact, 
in some ways, it's more important for people to find ways to get along with 
their next-door neighbors than it is for companies to make decisions involving 
huge amounts of money." 
</P>
<P>
Although no dollar limits are imposed upon mediation cases, many of the 
disputes are ones that otherwise would be destined for small claims courts or 
that, if they never reached the courthouse -- for economic or other reasons -- 
could produce lingering enmity, if not physical violence, among neighbors, 
tenants and landlords or customers and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Mediation Center's cases, in fact, stem from referrals from small 
claims court officials, who inform individuals intending to file a suit of the 
alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"When people call us for the first time, they think we're Judge Wapner or 
something like that," Underell joked, referring to the judge who presides over 
TV's "People's Court." 
</P>
<P>
Consistently loud music, barking dogs, overgrown shrubbery or visually 
intrusive fences along property lines, house expansions that block a neighbor's 
view, rental security deposit arguments, dissatisfaction with auto repairs or 
consumer purchases -- these and other everyday occurrences form a large 
percentage of the disputes that go before the mediators. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego lawyer Jerry Harris said that resolving commonplace disputes via 
mediation can reduce local courts' logjams -- a major reason why many judges 
have embraced the concept. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cases Won't Just Go Away 
</P>
<P>
"These cases aren't going to just go away," said Harris, a member of the 
Community Mediation Center's advisory board. "If they aren't settled this way, 
the courts probably will have to deal with them. And in many of these cases, 
that's in no one's best interest." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Supervisor Brian Bilbray, a strong advocate of the mediation 
program, argues that it "prevents small disputes from escalating into large 
ones . . . without resorting to judicial overkill." 
</P>
<P>
"So-called minor disputes between neighbors can turn into very ugly situations 
where people get hurt," Bilbray said. "Before mediation, if you couldn't settle 
the problem yourself, your only option was going to court. Mediation lowers the 
intensity of the process to reflect the intensity of the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the mediation program resolved about 800 disputes involving nearly 
1,900 people, according to Judy Foland, the Mediation Center's program 
coordinator. While most disputes heard by the center involve only two people, 
mediators have heard cases involving as many as 50 people. With the program's 
staffing level now scheduled to nearly double, a commensurate increase in the 
caseload is expected next year. 
</P>
<P>
Although estimates on the extent to which mediation has lessened court 
caseloads are imprecise -- in part because of the uncertainty that any 
threatened lawsuit will ever actually go to court -- Presiding Superior Court 
Judge Michael Greer feels that the impact has been significant. 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing less and less of these family dispute-type cases, which makes it 
possible for us to use our limited resources better," Greer said. "When judges 
realize there are (major cases) needing attention, it's frustrating to have to 
handle disputes over whether one person did or did not punch someone else, 
whether a fence is two inches over a property line and which side the fruit 
falls on." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agree to Abide by Decision 
</P>
<P>
In a conscious effort to keep mediation proceedings less complicated, 
time-consuming, intimidating and expensive than court cases, the guidelines 
governing mediation disputes are kept to a minimum. The only requirements, 
Underell explained, are that both sides agree to enter mediation and to abide 
by any compromise reached. 
</P>
<P>
That latter provision, however, is more of a voluntary oath than a binding 
pledge because the mediation agency has no legal authority to enforce it. 
Despite that fact, follow-up calls to mediation participants show that about 
86% abide by the mutually agreed-upon resolution. 
</P>
<P>
"I think when people are part and parcel of settling a dispute, they're more 
supportive of the decision," Underell said. 
</P>
<P>
Characterizing mediation as a no-lose proposition, its proponents note that 
individuals unable to reach a settlement reserve the option of going to court. 
On occasion, mediators suspect that some people involved in disputes use the 
mediation as a trial run for a court proceeding to get a sense of how a neutral 
third party reacts to their arguments. Such instances of "coming into the 
process in bad faith," however, are rare, Underell said. 
</P>
<P>
A mediation session itself is described by USD law professor Wiggins as "a 
little more than a casual chat . . . but a lot less threatening than a 
courtroom." Typically lasting about two hours, the meetings give both parties 
-- who appear, more often than not, without attorneys -- an opportunity to air 
their grievances and to offer proposed solutions, with the mediator playing a 
role that is equal parts moderator, compromiser and devil's advocate. 
</P>
<P>
Of the disputes that are settled, nearly 95% are resolved during the first 
mediation session, Underell said. Some problems, however, require multiple 
sessions that, on occasion, stretch into double digits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Finding Common Ground 
</P>
<P>
Wanting to be perceived as neither judge nor jury, mediators usually resist 
offering solutions themselves, preferring to nudge the principals into finding 
acceptable common ground. That formula, mediation officials believe, is largely 
responsible for the program's high success rate. Unlike court cases, which 
produce clear winners and losers, mediation is designed to allow each side to 
walk out feeling satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"In mediation, people have a much stronger hand in shaping decisions than they 
do in court," mediator Marty Arnold said. "They don't just sit back while 
lawyers do most of the talking. And the resolution isn't imposed on them -- it 
comes from them." 
</P>
<P>
In adherence with mediation's guiding tenet, the dispute resolutions usually 
are based more on simple common sense -- a commodity often lost amid long 
pent-up hard feelings -- than precise legalities or factual analyses. 
</P>
<P>
That approach is illustrated by the eugenia tree case, which occupies an 
honored place in local mediation lore. In that case, the dispute focused on an 
overgrown eugenia tree between two yards -- the yard belonging to an older 
couple in which the tree grew and the yard of a young couple that had recently 
redecorated their house by installing a white carpet. 
</P>
<P>
Tiring of tracking eugenia berries in on their new carpet, the young couple 
repeatedly asked their neighbors, without success, to trim back their tree. As 
the situation dragged on, mutual animosity grew faster than the eugenia. 
Finally, they agreed to enter mediation, where the dispute was quickly defused 
by the younger couple agreeing to help their older neighbors -- who explained 
that they had trouble reaching the top of the tree -- trim the eugenia. 
</P>
<P>
Many other cases end with such logical, simple solutions. 
</P>
<P>
A mother's insistence that her daughter stay home during summer vacation to 
baby-sit her younger sister was resolved, for instance, when the older daughter 
-- who initially wanted to be free to spend time with her friends whenever she 
chose to -- agreed to take her sister with her if she left the house. Another 
dispute over division of monthly bills between two roommates led to their 
admission to the mediator that the problem was not the bills, but rather that 
they intensely disliked each other -- a confession that led to an amicable 
decision to part their ways. Property line and fence disputes often are settled 
with a minimum of expense and inconvenience to both parties. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the answers are simple things you'd think people could work out 
between themselves," lawyer and mediation adviser Harris said. "Unfortunately, 
many of these people have stopped talking or are so suspicious of each other 
that they need someone else to help them discuss it." 
</P>
<P>
Despite its impressive track record, Underell cautions that the mediation 
program -- like any effort to resolve differences -- does not ensure that 
"everyone ends up friends -- or even friendly." 
</P>
<P>
"But most times, they feel satisfied because they know they've really had their 
say and someone listened to them," Underell said. "That's really what a lot of 
people are looking for in these cases."

SCRIPPS WANTS TO MAKE IT BIG IN MICROSURGERY; 
</P>
<P>
COMPETITORS FEAR A GLUT OF SPECIALISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA ROACH MONROE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla has begun a drive to become the leading 
microsurgery center in southernmost California. 
</P>
<P>
An important use of microsurgery is reattachment of severed limbs, and Scripps' 
move has raised concerns that too many San Diego-area hospitals may be getting 
into that field. 
</P>
<P>
But Dr. Stephen M. Krant, a plastic surgeon who heads the new Scripps unit, has 
a different view. "We are not creating a new science at Scripps," he said. "We 
are creating the availability of the microsurgeons. People will know that, if 
you have an accident or fire, you call 911, if you have an amputation the first 
thing you think about is Scripps Memorial Hospital-La Jolla Microsurgery and 
Replantation Center." 
</P>
<P>
However, critics of the proliferation of such high-profile programs as 
microsurgery worry that having too many of them will dilute their efforts and 
might lower the quality of overall care. Furthermore, it would limit the 
ability of UC San Diego Medical Center to train surgeons in the microscopic 
intricacies of reattaching severed limbs, some doctors say. 
</P>
<P>
"What you're dealing with is a lot of administrators trying to play 
one-upmanship on the next hospital down the street," Dr. Jonathan Jones said of 
the boom in new programs. A plastic surgeon, Jones heads the Mercy Hospital 
&amp; Medical Center replantation team. 
</P>
<P>
Microsurgeons, viewing the field of surgery through a microscope and using 
sutures so fine that they can float in the air, are able to sew tiny blood 
vessels together and restore circulation to newly connected tissue. 
</P>
<P>
Microsurgery is useful in a variety of specialty operations, including breast 
reconstruction after a mastectomy and transplanting tissue from one part of the 
body to another to repair birth defects, cancer damage or chronic wounds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dramatic Results 
</P>
<P>
Some of the technique's more dramatic results come in emergencies when it is 
used to reattach fingers, hands or limbs and make them functional again. Such 
operations are done by teams of rotating doctors, and can take more than 24 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County's first limb reattachment unit was at UCSD Medical Center, 
which began performing the operations in 1977. By the early 1980s about 60 a 
year were being performed at the center. When the unit was too busy to handle a 
case, it was usually referred to surgeons in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
The number of amputation cases in San Diego County has fallen, microsurgeons 
say, apparently because of safer equipment in industry and home shops. 
Nevertheless, replantation programs have proliferated. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago Mercy Hospital set up a replantation unit that Jones said was 
intended to handle UCSD's overflow. Then, a year ago, a surgeon trained at UCSD 
began setting up a program at Grossmont Hospital. It is gearing up for a major 
marketing push to industrial employers in eastern San Diego County and, 
possibly, Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
Together, those two hospitals handle about 2 dozen major replantation cases a 
year, and the UCSD total has dropped to about 30, doctors there say. 
</P>
<P>
In that competitive milieu, Scripps is using a San Francisco hospital as a 
model for what it would like to become: the private hospital that draws 
patients from a wide region because of its medical reputation and no-nonsense 
efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though microsurgery has been done in San Diego for a while, this whole 
unified concept hasn't been done," Krant said. "It is an all-inclusive program 
because we are organizing a complete team approach with social service, 
psychologists, rehabilitation, occupational therapy -- because all of that is 
really involved with these patients that are injured." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Willing and Committed' 
</P>
<P>
Even as UCSD Medical Center and other hospitals in San Diego County back away 
from drawing in no-pay patients, Krant said, the Scripps program won't set up 
financial roadblocks to replantations. 
</P>
<P>
"We are willing and committed to taking all comers -- insurance, no insurance, 
whatever," said Krant, who has a private plastic surgery practice in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
He hopes this policy will help Scripps become the best-known replantation 
center in both San Diego and Imperial counties, which would then draw in more 
paying replant operations as well as non-emergency microsurgeries. 
</P>
<P>
Allen Yearick, associate administrator at Scripps, said the unit is a logical 
extension of reconstructive microsurgical work the hospital's doctors already 
are doing related to cancer surgeries, birth defects and the trauma unit. It 
also will offer an opportunity to educate the public about what to do when an 
accident at home severs fingers or limbs. 
</P>
<P>
The Scripps model for its unit is Davies Medical Center in San Francisco, a 
private hospital where microsurgery pioneer Dr. Harry J. Buncke leads a team 
that does 150 replantations and 200 other microsurgeries a year. 
</P>
<P>
That is despite the fact that there are competing centers at UC San Francisco, 
Stanford University and UC Davis. Scripps' replant team has consulted with UC 
Davis and sent nurses there for training, Krant said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the industry workers' compensation cases don't go to UCSF. They go to 
Buncke because they know from the time you make that phone call there's no 
hassle," Krant said. 
</P>
<P>
He contrasts this to what he characterized as bureaucratic roadblocks, based on 
financial issues, that an employer with an injured worker faces at a university 
hospital such as UC Davis or UCSD. Already, the Scripps replant team has drawn 
one such case from El Centro, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gearing Up for 2 Months 
</P>
<P>
For the patient, the difference between a replant operation at a public 
university and one at a private hospital is "the difference between a bed and 
breakfast and the Hyatt Regency," said Michelle O'Hara, coordinator of the 
Davies replant center. 
</P>
<P>
As the Scripps team was gearing up over the last two months, it did three 
replantation operations, about the same rate as Mercy and Grossmont. Krant said 
he hopes the center will do 10 to 15 replants a year and an additional 40 to 60 
elective surgeries involving microvascular techniques. 
</P>
<P>
If that goal is met, it should be enough to keep Scripps' four plastic and 
reconstructive surgeons in good enough training through elective surgeries to 
assure they have good results with the emergencies, Mercy's Jones said. As in 
any complicated surgery, the more practice a surgeon gets, the better the 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
But Jones and others worry that too many programs might mean too few elective 
cases at any one hospital to keep the doctors in good training -- leading to 
unsuccessful reattachments of fingers and limbs. 
</P>
<P>
"The tragedy of it will be that, if Grossmont gets their big program going and 
all their PR, and Scripps has theirs, and Mercy and University, you're going to 
find that each hospital with their well-advertised program does two cases a 
year, and they may not be successful," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Whether that becomes a problem will depend on how many non-emergency 
microvascular surgeries the hospitals attract, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the person doing them does free tissue transfers and regularly does 
microsurgery procedures then this is just a spinoff from that, and then it can 
be successful in all the centers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ephraim Zinberg, chief of the Hand and Microvascular Surgery Service at 
UCSD Medical Center, said UCSD used to be the only hand and limb replantation 
center in the county "and, as far as we're concerned, we're still the only 
one." 
</P>
<P>
He questioned whether a replantation program should consider its doctors 
qualified to do replantations if they have not done one-year fellowships in 
hand surgery to gain experience in the complicated surgical and follow-up care 
such cases need. Zinberg has done so, and UCSD also trains two hand fellows 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
Zinberg noted that the American Society for Surgery of the Hand appears likely 
to establish the one-year training program as a requirement for eligibility to 
take a new board-certification exam in the specialty. 
</P>
<P>
Of the private microvascular centers, only Grossmont's has a surgeon who has 
done a one-year hand fellowship. He is Dr. Ronald Vandell, who was trained at 
UCSD. 
</P>
<P>
At Scripps, Krant's training included a three-month hand fellowship in a 
community hospital while he was a resident at Yale University, plus many 
microsurgeries at Yale. His three plastic surgeon colleagues on the Scripps 
team have not done one-year hand fellowships, but they have extensive 
experience in complicated microsurgeries. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Dr. Ned Garrigues started the microsurgery program at Naval 
Hospital San Diego in 1982 and had a six-month specialty training in skull and 
face reconstruction in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of people that are excellent hand surgeons who are not going 
to take those boards and have not had a special fellowship," Krant said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worries About Training 
</P>
<P>
Some doctors also worry about UCSD'S ability to train hand fellows if the 
number of replantations there falls because patients are being drawn by private 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
"When you begin to have it all over the place, things get fragmented. When I 
started practice here, having trained at UCSD, I took all my replants to 
University Hospital . . . because my concern was that that is a training 
program," Vandell said. "If these injuries are now going to be taken care of in 
the private hospitals, then that significantly injures the training program." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his involvement in the Grossmont program that will compete with UCSD 
for patients, Vandell continues to be involved in the university's efforts as a 
hand surgery teacher at the UCSD Medical Center and the VA Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
One solution to the potential dearth of patients at UCSD would be cooperation 
among the various centers to train doctors in microsurgery. UCSD and Grossmont 
recently announced a joint training program to teach microvascular surgical 
techniques to doctors in the community. Beginning in September, the program 
will offer a five-day course. 
</P>
<P>
Krant said he would be interested in cooperative programs between Scripps and 
the university too, but said the option has not yet been explored. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, whether there are too many microvascular/replantation programs in 
San Diego County may be settled Darwinian style, with the survival of the 
fittest. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think UCSD's our competitor," Krant said, but added: "I think we can 
blow them out of the water in terms of quality of care." 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same as in any specialty or sub-specialty," he said. "Those guys who 
do good (heart operations) are going to be very, very busy. And those who don't 
do good hearts and don't have good services are not going to be very busy."

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Davis' column skipped over an important point. There are thousands of voices 
speaking out at any moment about the problems facing America, but once an 
individual states the need for sweeping change he is likely to be denied access 
to the media. Intellectuals such as Noam Chomsky or Gore Vidal may get mention 
as personalities, but to get access to their ideas one has to know their names 
and look for them in a bookstore. There has been a campaign for the last 
several months to get a progressive counterpart to William Buckley et al on 
PBS, but with no results I've ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
Individuals such as Edward Abbey, Abbie Hoffman, or I.F. Stone have to die or 
be arrested to get into the mainstream media. Perhaps if they had been given an 
open hearing for their ideas, the former two would not have had to engage in or 
advocate outrageous behavior to give us a faint hope for change. Then we could 
have thought they were intellectuals too. I'm afraid even to mention the host 
of New Age thinkers because they've all been branded as weird and flaky. 
</P>
<P>
As recommended reading, Riane Eisler, Michael Parenti and Robert Anton Wilson 
all suggest interesting reasons why the public does not get exposed to ideas 
that shake up the system. Their books may be available in one of the few 
remaining independent bookstores.

HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thanks for the article regarding the homeless couple who couldn't find 
emergency shelter because the wife was in a wheelchair (Metro, June 24). I 
clipped it out and put it in the file next to the one you printed March 8 about 
the homeless Vietnam veteran, also in a wheelchair, who had a difficult time 
finding an accessible shelter willing to take him. 
</P>
<P>
In my work at the Westside Center for Independent Living, I help people with 
disabilities and seniors to maintain their independence within the community 
and avoid costly institutionalization. Adequate affordable and accessible 
housing is vital to that effort. Because of skyrocketing costs for housing and 
a real lack of community support services, there is an unacceptably large 
number of homeless people who are also disabled. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the sensitivity of shelter providers has not kept up with this 
growing population. I recognize that providers of emergency shelter are being 
asked to fulfill a lot on the smallest of budgets. Still, when shelter requests 
involve homeless individuals with disabilities, all too often providers' first 
concern is liability. 
</P>
<P>
Some shelter providers and government funders suggest creating new shelters to 
serve only homeless people with disabilities and seniors. History too clearly 
shows that separate is never equal. There are a variety of shelters to serve a 
variety of needs: substance abusers, battered women, shelters for chronically 
mentally ill, emergency shelters for homeless families and runaway youths. 
People with mobility impairments fall into all these categories. As a result, 
all these categories need accessible facilities. For that to occur, there must 
be an assessment of need and development of a plan that makes shelter services 
available to all. Needless to say, there must be funds for this to be achieved. 
</P>
<P>
Your reports keeps us mindful that we have a way to go in achievement of the 
"kinder, gentler society."

In response to "Intellectuals: Mute Voice of America" by Donald Davis, Opinion, 
June 25: 
</P>
<P>
The issue is not muteness on the part of this country's intellectuals, it is 
the silencing of these people by this culture -- a silencing more thorough and 
insidious perhaps than the silencing of intellectuals in many communist or 
fascist countries. 
</P>
<P>
We are writing, but our best, our strongest work is not getting into print. The 
low salaries most of us command as university professors reinforce the popular 
notion that we are ineffectual and dismissable. We are not taken seriously in 
the political arena. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, children are taught early on to distrust ideas, to make 
fun and to disregard abstract thinkers. Look at the way poets and intellectuals 
are treated for example, on television -- very effective. Who would listen to 
such buffoons?

OUT-OF-DATE DIVERSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forty years ago, the Central Valley Project began delivering water to 
irrigation districts in the San Joaquin Valley from the new dams and reservoirs 
the federal Bureau of Reclamation operated on rivers flowing down the west 
slope of the Sierra Nevada. No one gave much thought then to the environmental 
effects the diversions would have over the years to water quality, soil 
conditions and fish and wildlife habitat. Today, the effects are obvious, 
especially within the context of the massive water transfers achieved by the 
expanded Central Valley Project along with the state Water Project. 
</P>
<P>
But even with the benefit of hindsight, the Bureau of Reclamation and its 
parent, the Department of the Interior, are intent on recommitting the water to 
the very same sort of diversion for another 40 years as if it had learned 
nothing about the environment in the past four decades. At the direction of 
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., the bureau has begun to issue new 40-year 
contracts for the sale of the same amounts of water to the same districts 
without conducting a formal environmental impact assessment. 
</P>
<P>
The Lujan action is becoming increasingly unpopular, even within the Bush 
Administration. The secretary should stop the process and acknowledge that an 
environmental impact study is both reasonable and necessary under the law. The 
Environmental Protection Agency already has called for such a study. And now 
the White House Council on Environmental Quality has, too. 
</P>
<P>
The council's statement reached the logical conclusion that to commit such a 
vast amount of water -- roughly 1.5 million acre-feet annually, nearly twice as 
much as the entire city of Los Angeles consumes -- for another 40 years indeed 
does constitute a major federal action. That is the test for requiring the 
full, formal environmental study. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan claims that federal law requires him to renew the contracts. But there is 
not necessarily a conflict between contract renewal and conducting the study. 
An environmental impact study outlines a number of alternate actions, assesses 
the potential environmental damage from each one, selects a favored course of 
action and proposes mitigation for any harmful effects. Mitigation might be 
stricter conservation measures or a shorter renewal term. 
</P>
<P>
The Council on Environmental Quality cannot overturn Lujan's action. The 
council basically serves as a referee when there is an environmental dispute 
between two federal agencies. But its opinion used to carry considerable weight 
with the White House and in Congress. There already is legislation in the House 
to bar the Bureau of Reclamation from executing any more contracts during the 
next year pending an environmental study. And a federal court in Sacramento has 
said any renewals will be subject to his final decision on whether an 
environmental impact statement is required. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan could simplify the whole matter by rescinding his earlier order and 
conducting the study. A word from the White House that this is the right thing 
to do might help him make up his mind.

RESCUE THE WAR AGAINST AIDS; 
</P>
<P>
ONLY A CZAR CAN INSTILL COURAGE, REBUILD PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NEIL R. SCHRAM, Neil R. Schram, an internist, is chairman of the AIDS Task 
Force for the American Assn. of Physicians for Human Rights. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The AIDS epidemic has been studied to death. Numerous sound recommendations 
have been made, and most have been ignored. 
</P>
<P>
The failure of the federal government to act on the medical experts' advice is 
leading to an imminent crisis: The patchwork quilt method of dealing with AIDS 
is about to be overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
Most of our elected officials have been paralyzed by the perceived 
"controversial" nature of this epidemic. There is now only one with the stature 
to provide the necessary leadership to deal with the escalating problem: 
President Bush. He must appoint an AIDS czar with the responsibility for 
developing and implementing major new programs. Continued lack of presidential 
leadership will likely result in social devastation growing to the point of 
outrage until finally the necessary political pressure is created -- a high 
price for our society to pay for political cowardice. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Public Health Service has predicted that an additional 250,000 
Americans will require medical treatment for AIDS over the next 3 1/2 years or 
need expensive medications to delay or prevent the disease. This compares with 
100,000 Americans diagnosed with AIDS during the first eight years of the 
epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
AZT, the one medication proven effective against the human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV), is now provided through a federal program that is due to end soon. 
Congress has shown little interest in renewing it, yet imagine how tens of 
thousands of patients and their friends and loved ones will respond if AZT is 
suddenly unavailable? 
</P>
<P>
We heard at the International AIDS Conference in Montreal earlier this month 
that about 50 potential AIDS drugs are being studied, and 17 are considered 
high priority. As some of these are proven effective, it follows that they 
should be provided to people who need them. Yet tens of thousands of people 
will be denied them, either because the drugs are still considered experimental 
or because the patients do not have health insurance with a drug benefit that 
makes them affordable. 
</P>
<P>
Our response to AIDS also is collapsing on another front. The voluntary 
agencies that have been the backbone of the response to the epidemic are in 
trouble. Most of the early volunteers are burned out or are ill themselves. The 
newer volunteers are overwhelmed by the continually growing number of people 
needing services. Voluntary funding for these agencies cannot keep up with the 
need. As services outside hospitals decline, more AIDS patients will have to be 
hospitalized longer, adversely impacting public hospitals and all their 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
Solving these problems requires federal funds, and only an effective, 
coordinated response and leadership from the Bush Administration is likely to 
persuade Congress to act. Too many politicians seem to believe that their 
constituents are not concerned enough to spend money for people who are sick 
with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
At present, there is no master plan for a government response to this national 
public health crisis. One is desperately needed. President Bush must appoint an 
experienced, knowledgeable physician to lead the AIDS effort -- not to do more 
studies, but to develop programs to submit to Congress, and then to implement 
them when they are approved. Retiring Surgeon General C. Everett Koop would be 
an ideal appointee. 
</P>
<P>
Apathy remains the main roadblock. On the policy front, public health 
officials, frustrated by lack of funding, are encouraging AIDS activists to 
mount dramatic public protests, the only thing politicians are known to respond 
to. People in the AIDS fight have tried to get more Americans to care by 
pointing out the heterosexual threat, by appealing to compassion and by trying 
to show that money spent now on prevention saves money and lives later. None of 
these has succeeded: At present, the heterosexual threat affects mostly 
minorities, so white Americans are not concerned; compassion seems in short 
supply these days; and prevention requires programs that politicians do not 
have the courage to implement. 
</P>
<P>
President Reagan successfully evaded the AIDS epidemic by ignoring it for 
years, then by appointing a commission when Congress seemed ready to appoint 
one of its own. But he never followed through on his commission's key 
recommendations. Now there will be a new commission, with the new President's 
appointees, who undoubtedly will have to do more studies and make more 
recommendations. And the commission will not have the authority or the ability 
to implement programs. 
</P>
<P>
We do not have time to start all over again. President Bush should read the 
reports of the earlier commission and of the National Academy of Sciences. And 
he must give someone the mandate to implement their recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
The concept of leadership in the United States has changed. When difficult 
problems arise, we can no longer look to political leaders for vision and 
direction. Instead of leading us, politicians watch the polls; they have become 
followers of what a handful of people tell an interviewer. In the area of AIDS, 
can President Bush make an exception? The price of not doing so will be 
devastating.

DISLIKE ABORTION RULING? WE VOTED FOR IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN SCHRAM, Martin Schram is a syndicated columnist in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sorry to say, the Supreme Court's whittling of abortion rights is the ultimate 
pro-choice decision. 
</P>
<P>
Pro-choice -- as in our choice. We made our choice in 1980, again in 1984, and 
for good measure we reaffirmed it in 1988. We made it despite the fact that we 
knew we would someday regret it. 
</P>
<P>
We made our choice when we elected and reelected Ronald Reagan, despite his 
repeated warnings to us that he intended to pack the Supreme Court (in fact, 
all our courts) with judges who would abort the precedent-setting decisions 
that affirmed a woman's right to have a safe abortion. 
</P>
<P>
It's perverse but true: We pick our presidents these days even though we may 
disagree with them on fundamental issues. We chose Reagan, for example, even 
though we disagreed with him on most issues -- the deficit, defense spending, 
the environment and, especially, abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Polls show that we have for years believed women have both the right to have an 
abortion and the right to make for themselves this very personal decision that 
affects their bodies. A recent Gallup Poll showed that 58% of Americans did not 
want the court to roll back its 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision, which (as the 
pollster phrased it for those interviewed) "ruled that states cannot place 
restrictions on a woman's right to an abortion during the first three months of 
pregnancy." Just 37% wanted the ruling overturned and 5% were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
Also, in another Gallup survey last October, a whopping 66% of us opposed the 
Reagan Administration's decision to withhold government funds from clinics 
providing abortion counseling. Only 26% of us backed the Reagan decision. 
</P>
<P>
Yet here we are, stuck with a carefully stacked court that has given us just 
what we don't want. The Rehnquist Court has dropped upon us a neutron bomb 
ruling on abortion. They left standing the shell of Roe vs. Wade but wiped out 
the vitals that were inside. 
</P>
<P>
Abortions are not illegal -- yet. But by upholding a Missouri law that bars 
public employees and public funds from being used in abortions unless the life 
of the mother is endangered, and inviting each state to set its own laws, the 
Supreme Court has struck hardest at those who can least afford it. 
</P>
<P>
This will be the result: America will become a land of safe abortions for the 
rich and the well-to-do. Poor women will be left to their own devices -- and 
those of quacks. Safe abortions will still be available for women who can 
afford to pay private physicians and hospitals or who can afford to shop from 
state to state until they find one that will permit a safe public abortion. 
</P>
<P>
As our TV weathermen say, there is no relief in sight; in fact, it just figures 
to get worse. Three of the four dissenting justices in the latest abortion 
decision are the court's only octogenarians. Justice William J. Brennan Jr., an 
Eisenhower appointee who turned out to be a court moderate, is 83; Justice 
Thurgood Marshall, a Johnson appointee who is the court's only liberal vote, is 
81; Justice Harry A. Blackmun, a Nixon appointee who proved to be a court 
moderate and the author of the original Roe vs. Wade ruling, is 80. 
</P>
<P>
Actuarial tables tell us it's possible President Bush could wind up naming 
replacements for all three. Also, Justice Byron R. White, a Kennedy appointee 
who has turned out to be one of the court's most conservative justices, is 72 
and has talked of retirement. If Bush winds up picking successors to Marshall 
and White, it will mean that we will have a Supreme Court comprised of justices 
chosen entirely by Republican presidents. 
</P>
<P>
The true legacy of the Reagan years is that he bequeathed to us a Supreme Court 
that will rule our lives and those of our children and grandchildren in ways 
that are not to our liking. For this, we have only ourselves to blame -- that 
is, ourselves and Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis, who never could focus 
public perceptions on the danger we faced from an all-conservative court. 
</P>
<P>
Just this past week, the news reminded us of all there was to know about the 
Reagan presidency and why we wind up with government policies we oppose. There 
was the sentencing of Ollie North and the scandals of HUD -- reminders of all 
our President never cared to know. There was the Supreme Court's abortion 
ruling -- a reminder of all we never cared to know about what his decisions 
could do to us. 
</P>
<P>
But then there was that news report about Reagan himself -- a reminder of why 
he'd captured our spirit and our votes in the first place. Ever-heroic, he was 
riding the range at age 78, when the horse bucked and landed him first on the 
ground and briefly in a hospital. "My own private rodeo," Reagan reportedly 
quipped. 
</P>
<P>
What a guy. That's what we like in our Presidents.

LET'S HAVE A YEAR-LONG MORATORIUM ON POLITICS -- TO REDISCOVER AND PLAN FOR 
CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. WOOD, Father William J. Wood, S.J. is executive director of the 
California Catholic Conference in Sacramento. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian and the Legislature are to be commended for putting 
together a budget that more fairly meets the needs of Californians. And it is 
especially commendable that they successfully negotiated a financial scheme for 
education and transportation in the process. 
</P>
<P>
The pathetic reality, however, is that this took a miracle, or what Speaker 
Willie Brown called "an awesome legislative achievement." California is a 
magnificent ship adrift. What our elected leadership lacks is vision, the 
ability to see what things will be like 10 years from now and plan, as 
historian James MacGregor Burns puts it, beyond one's own ambition. 
</P>
<P>
A way to generate such vision would be for the people of California to call for 
a moratorium on politics over the next year. Like the Year of Jubilee 
proclaimed in the 25th chapter of the Book of Leviticus, no bills would be 
introduced or passed during the next legislative session, except for those that 
formulate the budget. And the budget would be developed and adopted only after 
eight months of study, debate and planning. 
</P>
<P>
That long-range planning process would commence on September 16 when the 
current legislative session ends and extend until June 30, 1990. Campaigns for 
state political offices would not be allowed to begin until July 1, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
All Californians would be invited to participate in the debate about the 
shaping of our future. Legislators and the governor would go out into the local 
communities and listen to the people. 
</P>
<P>
With all due respect to the many conscientious legislators of both parties and 
in both houses, what goes on in Sacramento year after year is absolutely 
insane. Since January, 4,599 pieces of legislation have been introduced, 
hundreds of them restructured with countless amendments. That's ridiculous! No 
legislator can keep track of the bills, let alone understand them and how they 
all fit together. This is essential for the responsible development of public 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
What is worse is that their overriding concern and preoccupation is not 
principled law-making, but getting elected the next time around. This is 
commercialized politics marketed for an increasingly disconnected electorate of 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
The newly framed abortion question could provide a marvelous opportunity to 
reconnect the electorate and involve them in the vigorous public debate that is 
the stuff of democracy. But, because of the commercialization of politics and 
the lack of vision, what the campaigns of 1990 promise is a thoughtless and 
fruitless exchange of loud and angry slogans, playing for the polarized crowds. 
</P>
<P>
That's the way things will go, unless and until we the people start taking 
responsibility for our future and stop leaving politics to the politicians. We 
must re-enfranchise ourselves in the knowledge and skills necessary for 
effective citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
And we can change. It's already happening in a number of communities throughout 
the state. In 1988, for example, it was not the politicians but people 
organized at the grass-roots in the inner city of Los Angeles who brought about 
an increase in the minimum wage for California workers. Similar church-based 
community organizations are working from a shared vision of what they want 
their cities to be like to solve the drug problem as it menaces their 
neighborhoods in Oakland, San Jose, Anaheim, Santa Ana and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
We need to revitalize the traditional seedbeds of civic virtue: families, 
churches, neighborhoods and local communities. There we need to talk to one 
another about what is important to us and how we want to live together as 
communities of mutual support. What are the truths we hold to be self-evident? 
How do we realize them and live by them in our public life? 
</P>
<P>
With this as a start, we can begin to come to grips with the issues that remain 
unaddressed in most political campaigns, from environmental degradation and 
urban decay to the feminization of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
Hunger, homelessness and the lack of access to basic health care are the most 
blatant symptoms of a system that is not working. There is no reason that the 
system cannot be made to work. But that will never happen unless we reject the 
short-term, piecemeal, quick fix finagling and manipulation of a fragmented 
system that has masqueraded for enlightened government for too many years. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most important thing to be hoped for from a moratorium on politics 
as usual is that during that time someone will come up with an idea for how we 
can do away with the commercialized politics in which wealth and technical 
expertise determine public policy. 
</P>
<P>
A global consensus is emerging that, as we stand on the brink of the 21st 
Century, we face an unprecedented time of reckoning, a singular moment of 
opportunity. But without radical change and recovery of civic virtue, we will 
stagnate in the vicious circle of visionless, self-serving and ultimately 
self-destructive commercialized politics.

ANTI-NOISE FORCES SEEK AIRPORT BOARD SHAKEUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leaders of anti-noise groups and state legislators are working together to 
challenge the makeup of the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority as a 
method to thwart plans for the expansion of Burbank Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Close of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. and Tom Paterson of the 
North Hollywood Residents Assn. said they want to amend existing legislation to 
put more members representing Burbank on the authority. They also want 
representation for Los Angeles residents affected by noise. Three members each 
from Burbank, Glendale and Pasadena sit on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
They said Glendale and Pasadena representatives have been unresponsive to 
residents near the airport who have complained about noise from airplanes 
flying over their homes. 
</P>
<P>
"The way it's structured now, the people who are most affected by the airport 
have no real power in the decision-making governing the airport," Paterson 
said. "Burbank should exercise primary control of that airport. After all, it's 
in their city. It's an idea whose time has come." 
</P>
<P>
Anti-noise advocates have approached Assemblymen Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) and 
Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles), as well as Burbank officials, in their 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman, who represents Studio City and Sherman Oaks, said he is drafting 
legislation to change the board's composition. 
</P>
<P>
"The interests of Los Angeles and Burbank residents have to be protected," he 
said. "The majority of the authority have been so unresponsive to my 
constituents that I would oppose any expansion of the airport. We should all 
equally share the burdens and the benefits of the airport." 
</P>
<P>
But there already is uncertainty and opposition to the suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just a game that these people have played time and time again," said 
Carl Mesick, who represents Glendale on the board. "The bottom line is, they 
just want to shut Burbank Airport down. This is nothing new." 
</P>
<P>
Even Burbank officials doubt that the shift would work. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank City Councilwoman Mary Lou Howard, who is on the airport board, said: 
"We've thought about doing this before -- becoming full owners of the airport 
and buying the other cities out. I would not be opposed to it, but I don't 
believe the other cities are willing for Burbank to control this airport." 
</P>
<P>
Burbank Mayor Robert R. Bowne said: "The fact that the city does have the 
airport within its boundaries does make it reasonable for Burbank to have more 
influence, but I'm not about to start a crusade over it. I'm not sure it could 
ever happen." 
</P>
<P>
The three cities purchased the airport from Lockheed Corp. in 1978 for $51 
million. Under state law, a joint-powers agreement was established by the three 
cities to set up the airport authority. Each city appoints three 
representatives to serve on the authority, and each city has equal 
responsibility for the facility's operation. 
</P>
<P>
Close and Paterson complained that Glendale and Pasadena commissioners don't 
care about the airport's impact on Burbank. They cited a recent authority 
decision rejecting the Burbank City Council's request to switch authority 
meetings from morning to evening so that more citizens could attend. 
</P>
<P>
They said Glendale and Pasadena have refused to share noise from planes routed 
over Burbank and other areas of the San Fernando Valley, and have been 
indifferent to complaints about flight patterns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proposed New Terminal 
</P>
<P>
Those same residents are now worried about the size of a proposed new terminal, 
the added noise from an increased number of flights and the effects such 
changes will have on community traffic and development. 
</P>
<P>
"Burbank Airport is being run for the benefit of Pasadena and Glendale and to 
the detriment of Burbank," Close said. "These cities look upon the airport as a 
spark plug for business and convenient transportation for their residents. Only 
Los Angeles and Burbank see the harm the airport is causing. It's not fair that 
Burbank can't control its own destiny." 
</P>
<P>
David Robinson, a commissioner representing Pasadena, disagreed. "The duty of 
each commissioner is not to be responsive to a city, but to do what's right for 
the airport. The authority is a separate public entity. I feel the commission 
is responsive to Burbank's concerns, and to the concerns of other cities."

DISPUTES, FEAR OF VIOLENCE MARK MEXICO VOTE COUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MEXICALI, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid fears of violence and charges of ruling party manipulation, the official 
count began Sunday of last week's hotly contested and potentially historic 
elections in the northern Mexican state of Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the evening, with some electoral results being released, it appeared 
that the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, had won five 
legislative seats -- three in rural zones of Mexicali, one in Tecate and one in 
an outlying area of Ensenada. The opposition National Action Party, or PAN, 
meanwhile, had emerged triumphant in at least four districts, all in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Six other legislative seats remained undecided late Sunday evening. 
</P>
<P>
The apparent legislative victories for PAN in Tijuana could be significant, as 
the PRI had earlier claimed victory in much of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, PAN declared that there was evidence of systematic electoral 
manipulation by the PRI. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a tendency to revise the results to reduce our votes," said Jesus 
Rivera, state chairman of PAN. 
</P>
<P>
A number of tense standoffs were reported at various counting sites, mostly 
schools. Activists from all parties, seeking to prevent fraud, have been 
maintaining vigils outside of the sites, where ballots and electoral tallies 
have been held under army guard since last Sunday's elections. 
</P>
<P>
At stake are the Baja governorship, 15 seats in the state legislature, and the 
mayoralities of the state's four municipalities: Tijuana, Mexicali -- the state 
capital -- Ensenada and Tecate. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling PRI has already acknowledged that its gubernatorial candidate, 
Margarita Ortega Villa, a federal senator who represents Baja in Mexico City, 
is the likely loser to Ernesto Ruffo Appel, a PAN candidate. 
</P>
<P>
With Ruffo's election apparently clinched, much of the interest in recent days 
has focused on the other races, where both sides have claimed victory. 
Particularly crucial are the disputed results in Tijuana, the state's most 
populous city, with up to 1.5 million residents. 
</P>
<P>
PAN maintains that it has won at least nine of the 15 legislative slots, 
including all six from Tijuana, giving the opposition a solid majority in the 
state legislature. PAN has also claimed triumphs in the mayoral races in 
Tijuana and Ensenada. The PRI has claimed likely victory in 12 of 15 
legislative slots and also maintains that it has won the mayor's post in 
Tijuana. Both sides agree that the PRI is the likely winner of the mayor's race 
in Mexicali, and that PAN will likely be victorious in Ensenada, the hometown 
of Ruffo. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding alleged PRI manipulation on Sunday, Rivera, PAN state chairman, said 
that PRI officials involved in the vote counts were citing numerous 
"irregularities" -- ranging from mathematical errors in the tallies to 
allegations of PAN intimidation at voting precincts. The complaints could form 
the basis of annulled results in many districts. 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate outcome, PAN leaders said, could be to give PRI a majority in the 
five-member state electoral college, which is scheduled to ratify the vote in 
October. A PRI-controlled electoral college, PAN says, would open the way for a 
PRI majority in the state legislature and in the city halls, largely reducing 
the effectiveness of the new PAN governor. 
</P>
<P>
PRI officials have denied allegations of electoral fraud and manipulation, 
accusing PAN of the same underhanded tactics. 
</P>
<P>
Conducting the vote counts are electoral committees composed of members of each 
party. The process is supervised by a state electoral commission that is 
nominally independent, but which opposition leaders have long charged is 
manipulated by the vast PRI apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
At Leona Vicario elementary school here, where a number of ballots were being 
counted, banner-waving PRI and PAN loyalists engaged in several near 
confrontations Sunday. The two groups frequently shouted barbs at each other 
across a 10-foot-wide "no man's land" set up by local authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"We are here to ensure that the law is respected," said Carlos Ling, a PAN 
candidate for city council in Mexicali, who was standing outside the elementary 
school with a group of fellow PAN supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Across the short divide, PRI officials accused the opposition observers of 
using intimidating tactics and attempting to provoke violence. PRI loyalists 
charged that PAN's gubernatorial candidate was an agent of U.S. imperialism. 
(Ruffo, a Mexican citizen, was born in San Diego, a fact that has sparked 
considerable controversy here.) 
</P>
<P>
"We dont want to turn our state over to foreigners," said Javier Castro, a 
Mexicali teacher who is a longtime PRI supporter. Ruffo's election, Castro 
said, would signal the "end of democracy" for the state.

ERRATIC WINDS HELP FUEL RAGING MT. LAGUNA BLAZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A raging fire, fueled by erratic winds and dry chaparral, burned out of control 
on Mt. Laguna late Sunday night, threatening residents of a nearby Indian 
reservation and forcing the evacuation of campers. 
</P>
<P>
By 8 p.m., the blaze, which began about 8 a.m. Sunday, already had claimed more 
than 2,000 acres in Thing Valley near Laguna Mountain Road, about 35 miles east 
of San Diego near Interstate 8, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Although no one had been injured and no structures had been destroyed by that 
time, the fire, dubbed the "Thing" by firefighters, was spreading quickly in 
two directions through the steep, chaparral-covered mountains, forestry 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going like a freight train," said Rosalinda Ewen, a spokeswoman for the 
U.S. Forestry Service. 
</P>
<P>
Another fire, at Morettis Junction between Highways 79 and 76 near Lake 
Henshaw, earlier claimed some 40 acres. But that blaze, which began about 12:35 
p.m. Sunday, was nearly contained by nightfall, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities were unsure of how long it would take to stifle the Mt. Laguna 
blaze, which was heading both north and south of the valley. 
</P>
<P>
Some officials, however, indicated it might take at least several days to 
collar the fire. 
</P>
<P>
More than 400 firefighters and 20 engines from 14 local, state and U.S. 
forestry crews battled the blaze on the steep terrain, while five air tankers 
and eight helicopters tried to snuff it out from above, according to officials. 
</P>
<P>
"The winds are 15 to 20 m.p.h., and it's very rocky terrain, very dry, heavy 
brush," said Audrey Hagen, a spokeswoman for the California Department of 
Forestry. "We haven't had a normal rainfall, so it's very, very dry out there 
in the back country." 
</P>
<P>
The Mt. Laguna blaze is the largest of several fires this summer in and around 
San Diego County, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In just one day, it destroyed more land than last week's Dogpatch blaze, which 
burned about 1,150 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities cleared the Burnt Rancheria campground of visitors before the fire 
swept through. Residents of the Cuyaipe Indian reservation, home of the 
Southern Diegueno Tribe, late Sunday were being allowed to stay in their homes, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have strike teams out there to protect those structures," Hagen said. 
</P>
<P>
California Highway Patrol officials had closed Sunrise Highway near Interstate 
8 by early Sunday evening.

GORGEOUS LOOKS GOOD AS GOLD IN WINNING BY 7 1/2 LENGTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five years ago, in racing's first $3-million race, Slew o' Gold got caught 
between the rock and the hard place -- Wild Again and Gate Dancer -- in the 
stretch run at Hollywood Park and wound up second, after Gate Dancer's 
disqualification, to Wild Again in the Breeders' Cup Classic. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, a sizable 3-year-old daughter of Slew o' Gold ran in another major 
race at Hollywood and had none of the distractions. Shifting into high gear on 
the far turn, Gorgeous put in one long run and romped to a 7 1/2-length victory 
in the $160,200 Hollywood Oaks, adding to a reputation that began in Kentucky 
and New York. 
</P>
<P>
This was the second major victory and the fifth one in seven starts for 
Gorgeous, and although she was unable to beat Open Mind, the star filly of 
Wayne Lukas' stable, in New York a month ago, she easily put away two of the 
same trainer's top runners Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly, a Secretariat filly who has never won a stake, finished second in the 
Oaks, with the Lukas entry running third and fourth in the six-horse field. 
Kelly finished 2 1/4 lengths ahead of Lea Lucinda and it was 2 1/2 lengths 
farther back to Imaginary Lady, who had her three-race winning streak stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Gorgeous, ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye for the seventh consecutive time, 
covered 1 1/8 miles in 1:47 4/5, which missed the stakes record by just 
two-fifths of a second. The second choice by only a few dollars to the Lukas 
entry in the crowd of 24,336, Gorgeous paid $4.20, $3.40 and $2.10. Kelly 
returned $5.20 and $2.10 and the show price on Lea Lucinda was $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
Gorgeous earned $92,700 for her owner and breeder, Robert Clay of Midway, Ky., 
to boost her career total to $390,000. 
</P>
<P>
After the Oaks, Clay, Delahoussaye and trainer Neil Drysdale all said that they 
would welcome a return match with Open Mind, particularly at 1 1/8 miles, which 
is Gorgeous' best distance. Open Mind won over Clay's filly by a head at that 
distance in a record-breaking Mother Goose at Belmont Park last month and it's 
possible that the two horses might clash again in the 1 1/4-mile Alabama at 
Saratoga on Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we could beat Open Mind if we ran again," Delahoussaye said. "This 
filly was not as seasoned as Open Mind when we hooked up last time, but she 
still ran a hell of a race. Today, she was a lot stronger, and she finished a 
lot stronger than she did in the Open Mind race." 
</P>
<P>
Imaginary Lady's style is early speed, but she had company on the fast pace 
from Kool Arrival, who was running for the first time in four months. In fact, 
Kool Arrival made the lead in the early run down the backstretch before 
Imaginary Lady moved ahead approaching the turn. 
</P>
<P>
On the turn, however, Gorgeous and Delahoussaye made a break, after sitting in 
the fourth place for the first half-mile. Once Gorgeous went by Imaginary Lady, 
the outcome was all but over, although Delahoussaye did hit his filly seven 
times through the stretch to make sure she didn't lose interest. 
</P>
<P>
The fractions were :45 2/5 for a half-mile and 1:09 4/5 for six furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
"We got pressure from the 3-horse (Kool Arrival), and that cost us our chance," 
Lukas said. "I knew the other filly was fresh and I thought she might go out 
like that. You can't run like that early and expect to beat a closer. And you 
can't dictate what the other guy is going to do." 
</P>
<P>
Kool Arrival wound up last, beaten by almost 20 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
"The pace was too fast," said Gary Stevens, riding Imaginary Lady. "I got fried 
on the lead. My filly wouldn't come back and relax, that's all." 
</P>
<P>
Drysdale is winning races with horses other than Gorgeous and is having his 
finest season. His barn has earned more than $2 million, which ranks the 
41-year-old trainer fourth nationally, about $4.5 million behind the Lukas 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a cracking pace and my filly relaxed nicely," Drysdale said. "I 
don't know how to compare this filly to some of the other good ones I've had, 
but she does everything right. That was a tough decision that she lost (to Open 
Mind) in New York." 
</P>
<P>
Drysdale, when was asked about the quickness of Gorgeous' move, said: "When she 
goes, she goes," the trainer said. "When it was time to go, it was time to go." 
</P>
<P>
Six years after he began his training career, Drysdale began putting major 
victories on the board in 1980 with another talented 3-year-old filly, Bold 'n 
Determined. Drysdale also trained Princess Rooney, who was the national 
filly-mare champion after she won the Breeders' Cup Distaff in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to compare horses but as far as riding, I think Bold 'n Determined was 
a little more kinder to relax and stuff, than Gorgeous," Delahoussaye said. 
"This filly gets a little tense and on edge. But she's just as genuine as Bold 
'n Determined, and she tries her heart out. I think she's one of the top 
fillies I've ever ridden." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
The stewards at Hollywood Park conducted a hearing into the Pick Nine scam at 
the track earlier this season and on Sunday they recommended that Deane Bailey, 
a mutuel clerk who was implicated, have his license permanently revoked. His 
fate will be decided by the California Horse Racing Board. Bailey had already 
been suspended after a cancelled $4,800 Pick Nine ticket wound up being 
privately sold to several bettors, who found out that an apparent winning 
ticket, worth $1.3 million, had been voided by Bailey at the window. . . . 
Bailey's lawyer indicated to the stewards that he might appeal their ruling in 
the courts. "There are indications that something like this may have happened 
before," said Pete Pedersen, one of the stewards. 
</P>
<P>
The stewards also fined trainer Steven Young $750 and placed him on probation 
for two months after his horse, Dubiously, tested positive for an illegal drug 
after running third at Hollywood Park June 9. Dubiously, who was treated with a 
drug that is given to horses with respiratory problems, was disqualified from 
any purse money. 
</P>
<P>
For good measure, Neil Drysdale and Eddie Delahoussaye teamed up to win the 
last race Sunday, and Delahoussaye had a three-winner day, as did Pat 
Valenzuela. That brought Valenzuela out of a slump in which he had only one 
winner out of more than 50 mounts.

AZINGER CHIPS HIS WAY TO VICTORY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Azinger made a 40-foot chip shot from the rough for a tie-breaking birdie 
on the final hole and beat Wayne Levi by one stroke with a course record 267 at 
the Greater Hartford Open Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Azinger, who lost a four-stroke lead on the back nine, repeated his tournament 
triumph of 1987, when he beat Levi and Dan Forsman by a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a Jekyll and Hyde round. I probably have never hit the ball in my life 
as well as I hit it on the first nine holes," said Azinger, who shot 
six-under-par 65 in the final round. "I became very unsure of myself (after 
that)." 
</P>
<P>
Levi, the co-leader after the third round, had a 67 Sunday and 268. 
</P>
<P>
Azinger, 29, seemed to have a safe lead when he shot six-under-par 30 on the 
front nine and went 17 under. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Levi was in second place, four strokes behind after eight holes. 
</P>
<P>
Levi began his charge on the 585-yard ninth hole, in which he birdied. Then, he 
birdied the 10th and 12th to cut Azinger's lead to one stroke. 
</P>
<P>
Azinger, at the 14th hole, was making his fifth consecutive par, but Levi made 
an eight-foot birdie putt on the 13th to tie for the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Moments after Azinger bogeyed the 446-yard 15th hole, Levi bogeyed the 424-yard 
14th, leaving both at 16 under. They stayed there until Azinger played the 
18th. 
</P>
<P>
The record since the event moved to the TPC of Connecticut in 1984 had been 
269, the score of four of the previous five winners. 
</P>
<P>
On his last 41 holes, Azinger had 11 birdies, 29 pars and one bogey. 
</P>

He moved from 11th place to fourth on the tour's earning list. The $180,000 
first-place prize in the $1 million purse gave him $597,499 for the year. He 
has finished in the top 10 in nine of his 18 tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Rummells shot 66 to finish third at 14-under-par 270. Jim Carter, with a 
66, Lee Trevino, with a 67, and Mark Calcavecchia, with a 69, tied for fourth 
at 271. 
</P>
<P>
Penny Hammel, holding off challenges by Nancy Lopez and Betsy King in the final 
nine holes, won by two strokes for her second Jamie Farr Toledo tournament 
championship.

CERAMIC SHOW GIVES TRANQUIL VIEW OF CHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, Times Art Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
News from China for the past few weeks has been so unsettling that one is 
hardly prepared for the exquisite calm that pervades "Imperial Taste: Chinese 
Ceramics From the Percival David Foundation." The rare traveling show of works 
from a renowned London-based collection, at the Los Angeles County Museum of 
Art through Sept. 17, is about as far as one can get from the China of recent 
headlines. 
</P>
<P>
Three curators -- George Kuwayama of LACMA, Tung Wu of the Boston Museum of 
Fine Arts and Rosemary Scott of the Percival David Foundation -- have selected 
58 works from a collection of 1,400 for the jewel-like exhibition. "It's a bit 
of everybody's favorites and a representative group from the collection," Scott 
said at a press preview. "The American curators had an eye on things that are 
not in American collections or rarely seen here, and I pointed out the most 
important pieces in the collection." 
</P>
<P>
Decision by committee? Perhaps, but the show doesn't suffer for it. Though 
works span the 9th to the 18th centuries and styles run from modest to 
flamboyant, the exhibition is a tranquil, sensibly ordered survey. If it 
accomplished nothing else, "Imperial Taste" would serve as a quiet reminder 
that China is a cultural powerhouse despite its turbulent history and extended 
blackouts. 
</P>
<P>
That power comes on with a whisper in 9th- and 10th-Century vessels of definite 
shapes and indefinite colors. This Yue ware (gray-bodied stoneware) includes a 
small grayish vase shaped like a pair of upright fish, a green-gray spittoon 
far too lovely to use and a silvery bowl delicately inscribed with two 
phoenixes. White basins and dishes from the Ding kilns in Hebei province look 
rather like embossed objects, subtly covered with scrolling floral motifs. 
</P>
<P>
A 7-inch-tall guan (official) vase from the Southern Song Dynasty is considered 
"the perfect example of its type," according to Scott, because of its graceful 
shape, pale blue color and a cracked pattern that complements the form. 
</P>
<P>
Such examples of understated beauty suggest that ceramics was a pure art form, 
but others undermine that notion. One 13th-Century vase with notched corners, 
for example, emulates a jade tube, while another vase is patterned after a 
bronze. Both offer evidence of a 13th-Century fascination with the archaic, 
Scott said. Another work that isn't quite as simple as it seems is a 
yellow-glazed porcelain table screen. Though it appears to depict a rooster 
looking for lunch in a garden, it's actually a pun that offers a wish for a 
successful career in government. 
</P>
<P>
Ceramic decoration becomes more complex as the show moves into the 14th 
Century. Monochromatic forms give way to cobalt blue and white porcelains 
sporting convoluted dragons, a wine jar with beaded outlines and lattice-like 
floral reliefs, and various fussy teapots. One of the most elaborately 
decorated pieces is an enamel-painted porcelain dish with the gods of 
happiness, rank and longevity painted in the center and a ring of leaf-shaped 
panels depicting birds and animals. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the objects in the show were owned by Chinese emperors and have 
inscriptions to prove it. The late Sir Percival David acquired them over a 
20-year period beginning in the late 1920s. His wife, Lady David, writes in a 
catalogue essay that he was "a born collector" who first visited China in 1924. 
"He instantly became so attracted by the Chinese tradition of art 
connoisseurship that he determined to study it in its highest manifestation, 
the Imperial Collection," which was displayed rather haphazardly in the 
Forbidden City in Beijing. With the blessing of Chinese officials, Sir David 
financed the renovation of a building in the Forbidden City, staged an 
exhibition of the collection there and published a catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
He went back to Britain in 1925, but returned to China in 1927 when rumors 
indicated that parts of the collection might be for sale. According to Lady 
David's rather vague account, Sir David arranged to buy 40 pieces in an 
on-again-off-again deal that involved hostile competitors and the temporary 
jailing of a Japanese dealer who helped him. Those 40 objects are the core of a 
collection that presently numbers 1,400. In 1950, Sir David gave the collection 
and a library on Chinese ceramics to the University of London. The collection 
is now housed in a historic house in the Bloomsbury district of London where it 
is open to the public on weekdays.

WARHOL PROFILE DOESN'T PENETRATE ENIGMATIC ARTIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, Times Art Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He has been dead for more than two years and the tent has folded on his 
retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, but the jury is still 
out on Andy Warhol. Was he a genius or a fraud, a wise child or a cynical 
street kid? Or was he a minor talent with an uncanny ability to sniff out the 
Zeitgeist? 
</P>
<P>
"Andy Warhol," premiering at 10 tonight on KCET Channel 28, doesn't render a 
final judgment of the late Pop artist. Instead the 90-minute profile hears 
testimony from members of the art and avant-garde film world who worked with 
Warhol. Their memories, assessments and occasional criticisms mingle with 
Warhol's art and films in an engaging biographical collage, hosted by Melvyn 
Bragg of London Weekend Television's "South Bank Show" and directed by Kim 
Evans. 
</P>
<P>
Strains of "Over the Rainbow" and romantic shots of smokestacks -- a reference 
to the fairy-tale quality of Warhol's life and his working-class background -- 
quickly give way to pounding rock music and brash Pop imagery, but the film 
maintains an ironic distance. 
</P>
<P>
At the end Warhol comments, "Death can really make you look like a star, but 
then it could be all wrong because if your makeup isn't right when you're dead, 
you won't look really right." As he applies makeup and turns into a 
computer-generated image, we realize that we still don't know Andy Warhol; we 
have merely learned some things about his life from his infinitely more 
knowable friends. 
</P>
<P>
Dealer Ivan Karp, for example, talks about Warhol's decision "not to drip" (in 
the reigning style of Abstract Expressionism) and reveals himself as a salesman 
with a taste for tough-looking art that turns out to be fun. Gerard Malanga, 
Warhol's chief assistant from 1963 to 1970, proves himself a shrewd, if 
self-interested, critic when he notes slippage in Warhol's art -- from 
chillingly detached portraits of famous strangers to splashy commissions later 
churned out by "a court painter." "It's an American disease to love famous 
people," and Warhol had a severe case, according to film director Emile de 
Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
When called upon to explain himself, Warhol is a stony-faced shadow who says 
"uh yes" and "uh no" to interviewers or begs them to give him answers as well 
as questions. 
</P>
<P>
"This thing about Andy can't keep going on because now it's really finished," 
says actress Brigid Berlin. She is wrong. In art world circles, Warhol is 
generally considered the quintessential Pop artist, but his public reputation 
is far less circumscribed. Fascination with Warhol won't go away because he 
never revealed himself. Unlike stereotypical Americans who blurt out their life 
stories and plead, "Do you like me?" Warhol kept his feelings under his wig.

Two more TV news troupes are joining those of the three networks and CNN this 
week in covering the economic summit conference in Paris: cable-TV's Financial 
News Network and its rival, NBC-owned CNBC. The latter is dispatching five 
staffers from its London bureau for live morning and afternoon reports from 
Paris during the conference on Thursday, Friday and on Monday. New York-based 
FNN is sending a team of seven, including anchors Bill Griffeth) and Doug 
Ramsey. The Paris conference is the first major overseas event covered live by 
CNBC, which only began operations three months ago. FNN says it covered last 
year's economic summit conference in Toronto. Claudia Puig

American ballerina Eva Evdokimova was on the bill to dance Mikhail Fokine's 
"The Dying Swan" Sunday at a command performance in the Casino de Monte Carlo. 
Prince Rainier III and Princess Caroline of Monaco were expected to attend the 
performance, a benefit for the John Gilpin Scholarship Fund of the Academie de 
Danse Classique Princesse Grace. Evdokimova claims she is the highest-paid 
dancer in ballet history. The reason: When she danced the two-minute, 58-second 
"Dying Swan" last September in Berlin (in front of Frederick the Great's 
palace), she received a custom-built Mercedes-Benz, valued at more than 
$80,000. Evdokimova, 40, has been prima ballerina of the Deutsche Oper, Berlin, 
since 1973. Claudia Puig

The Jewish Film Festival gave first prize to the first Israeli movie on the 
Palestinian uprising, and its best short film award went to one directed by a 
Palestinian refugee, a jury member at the Jerusalem festival said Sunday. An 
international jury awarded the $35,000 first prize to Isaac Zepel Yeshuron's 
"Green Fields," produced by David Tur, jury member and film critic Yehuda Stav 
said. The movie portrays three generations of an Israeli family caught in the 
violence of the 19-month-old uprising. Yeshuron, a leading Israeli director, 
condemns his characters who accept violence as the only means of dealing with 
the revolt. "The Shelter," by Palestinian director Rashid Mashrawi, which 
describes a day in the life of two Palestinian laborers in Tel Aviv, was 
awarded the $10,000 prize for best short film. Mashrawi is from the Shati 
refugee camp in the occupied Gaza Strip. Claudia Puig

INNER CITY CULTURAL CENTER HOSTS BARRO ROJO DANCERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With its primal images of proletarian struggle, Barro Rojo works in a 
modern-dance style that seems as classic as Isadora Duncan's "Marche Slave" and 
as contemporary as the latest activist performance art. 
</P>
<P>
In its Los Angeles debut Saturday at Inner City Cultural Center, this 
eight-member company from Mexico City presented six short, intense pieces 
expressing solidarity for the downtrodden. Hands desperately reaching out 
dominated all of them, as did a sense of oppressive weight and fierce communal 
pride. These artists know what modern dance was created to do -- and, for all 
their beauty and technical skill, they wasted no time on personal display. 
</P>
<P>
Fueled by the deepest anger, Laura Rocha's "Atadura" showed four women in 
fringed shawls confronting the implications of this archetypal garment and then 
furiously hurling it away. Mime-based, her "Crujia H" depicted two men so 
trapped and brutalized that they could relate to one another only as deadly 
enemies. 
</P>
<P>
Arturo Garrido's three group vehicles each exploited the company's technical 
expertise and might have looked slick except for the extra stretch and 
muscularity of the execution. Whether in jeans (" . . . Y Amanacera!"), 
overalls ("Aztra") or traditional loose white pants tied at the ankles ("El 
Camino"), his men would fling back pinioned hands and brandish clenched fists. 
No less committed, his women excelled at his signature stag-jump: arms flung 
back as the contorted body heroically lunged into space. 
</P>
<P>
Serafin Aponte's "Buscando Tierra" initially explored the range of movement 
possible for someone badly injured, a concept Paul Taylor took much further in 
"Dust." Nevertheless, this solo proved inventive in its contrasts between 
large-scale choreographic motion and intimate pedestrian activity -- and for 
such odd, compelling step sequences as the passage in which Francisco Illescas 
kept swiveling in place, his weight repeatedly shifting from toes to heels and 
back. 
</P>
<P>
Barro Rojo takes nothing for granted -- not even this pitifully limited 
physical freedom and mobility. Indeed, it celebrates endurance most of all and 
embodies it in dancing of selfless stamina. This is an exciting, important 
company that deserves to be much better known north of the border. LEWIS SEGAL

PBS TRIBUTE TO EARLY MASTER OF MOVIE MAGIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The wonderful fantasy and trick films of the French cineaste, Georges Melies -- 
who made more than 200 short movies at the very dawn of the cinema, from 1896 
to 1913 -- are sources of curious, unabashed delight. In them, we watch 
magicians appear and disappear in explosive puffs of smoke, devils cavort, 
star-men dance and intrepid, mustachioed explorers daringly scale 
wood-and-canvas mountainsides or moonscapes while scantily clad chorus girls 
"ooh" and "aah." 
</P>
<P>
It's a magic-land, befitting Melies' origins as a music-hall illusionist. 
(Sadly, he went bankrupt and wound up operating a toy concession at the 
Montparnasse railroad station before the French government, belatedly, gave him 
recognition and a subsidy.) For all their fragility, they've proven to be 
precious, sturdy illusions. 
</P>
<P>
In "A Tribute to Georges Melies," shown tonight on PBS' "Alive From Off Center" 
(Channel 15 at 10 p.m.), three modern French film-makers -- rock video 
specialist Philippe Gautier, and feature directors Aline Isserman and Pierre 
Etaix -- try to evoke again the long-ago spirit of Melies. 
</P>
<P>
Gautier and Etaix adapt old scripts of Melies' ("The Seven Deadly Sins" and "An 
Artist's Dream"), adding their own wit to the consciously primitive recreation 
of the master. Isserman, in her "The Slap of Beate Klarsfeld," reimagines in 
the style of Melies (who also restaged historical incidents in his films) a 
famous episode involving Nazi hunter Beate Klarsfeld and ex-West German 
Chancellor K. G. Kiesinger. 
</P>
<P>
Etaix, a clown and maker of comedies, who assisted Jacques Tati on "Mon Oncle" 
and later made the ebullient "Yoyo," seems the most natural matchup with 
Melies, and his effort, which puts "King Kong" in the artist's studio, is the 
funniest. 
</P>
<P>
But Gautier, who apes Melies' style meticulously in his parade of vices, and 
Isserman, who creates a grim fairy tale, have their moments too. There are also 
delightful stretches of pure Melies shown in between. And, with the narration, 
a deadpan video trickery that suggests a Terry Gilliam Monty Python montage and 
colorfully complement the black-and-white trickery old and new. 
</P>
<P>
One complaint: "Alive and Off Center" has chosen to eschew subtitling and offer 
instead, simultaneous translation of the French narrator and directors, which 
makes for an irritating babble of voices. Ignore them and wait for the magic 
instead.

2-CONCERT BEETHOVEN FEST CLOSES AT CAL STATE L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Beethoven concerts have by now been given in just about every shape and size 
imaginable. It's therefore easy to take for granted a concert of three 
successive Beethoven opuses -- 60, 61 and 62. 
</P>
<P>
But Saturday night, when Masatoshi Mitsumoto conducted the Concordia Orchestra 
at the State Playhouse, Cal State L.A., solid music making prevailed over this 
pat game plan. Concluding a modest two-concert festival dedicated to 
Beethoven's work between the years 1806 and 1808, the evening offered exciting 
and expert presentations of three of Beethoven's more succinct masterpieces. 
</P>
<P>
The Symphony No. 4 challenged the players with virtuosity and lighthearted 
expression. Although the energy level of the winds sagged at a few key moments, 
the powerhouse string section kept the music vital and forward-moving. 
</P>
<P>
The Adagio second movement found some anemic elements coming to the fore, while 
the scherzo took off at a faster clip than usual. Yet Mitsumoto's careful blend 
of confidence and intelligence kept the music crisp and unusually brilliant. 
</P>
<P>
Beethoven's Violin Concerto equally displayed an abundance of polish and 
spirit. Soloist Chikashi Tanaka chose an aggressive approach. Unfortunately, 
the price of his frequent manhandling was several passages in which intonation 
and accuracy suffered rough and slipshod edges. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the program was a powerful, invigorating reading of the "Coriolan" 
Overture. A dedication to the students of Tian An Men Square opened the evening 
with an appropriately placed encomium. GREGG WAGER

FETTA LEADS A MICROPHONED 'TOSCA' OUTDOORS IN REDLANDS

Many years before the Inland Empire became -- as it is today -- an area of 
varied and competitive symphonic activity, there was opera every summer in 
Redlands Bowl. The outdoor showplace, now in its 66th summer season, has hosted 
budding singers and al-fresco operatic production -- as well as dance and 
orchestra concerts and recitals -- throughout its long history. 
</P>
<P>
Puccini's "Tosca" returned to Redlands Bowl on Friday night, courtesy of music 
director Frank Fetta, a 31-player orchestra and a cast of attractive young 
singers. Unstaged, the old thriller still made its mark; the power of this 
score does not reside in sets, costumes and gesture. 
</P>
<P>
There was a modicum of interaction between the singing actors, which helped. 
What did not help the performance was a probing use of microphones and 
amplification, which seemed to distort all voices, flatten out timbres and 
stifle vocal coloration. The one benefit of such close aural scrutiny was a 
near-complete clarity of words: Sung in English in a serviceable combination 
translation, this "Tosca" could usually be understood. 
</P>
<P>
Fetta's impassioned and thorough approach to the familiar score achieved 
Puccinian sweep in some moments, but too often bogged down, motion-wise, in 
detail. Still, this was an effective musical reading, buoyed neatly by the 
capable orchestra. Assisting in choral duties was the Cambridge Singers, 
prepared by Alexander Ruggieri. 
</P>
<P>
Though their voices and singing emerged from the sound system distorted in 
regard to size and color, the three principals nevertheless seemed 
appropriately cast, and comprehensive in their preparation. 
</P>
<P>
As Tosca, Starleigh Goltry looked statuesque and divalike in her gowns, and 
sang confidently and with conviction. And, like Jane McGowan before her -- in 
1958, McGowan was Tosca in Glynn Ross' production for Redlands Bowl -- Goltry 
sang her final lines from the balcony above the Bowl stage. 
</P>
<P>
William Trabold's Cavaradossi matched Goltry in spirit and vocal thrust, 
despite apparent sound distortion above the staff. Peter Van Derick looked 
stoic and impassive as Scarpia, but spit out the words vehemently. 
</P>
<P>
Among the assisting singers, John Ross Nelson produced a well-detailed 
characterization of the Sacristan. DANIEL CARIAGA

<TEXT>
<P>
For the third time in the last five years, Boris Becker cast his spell over 
Wimbledon and established himself once again as the ruling monarch of tennis' 
magic kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
Becker, the red-haired king of the green courts, sent Mach-1 serves at Stefan 
Edberg and unceremoniously deposed the defending champion in stunning straight 
sets, 6-0, 7-6 (7-1), 6-4, to claim his third Wimbledon title. 
</P>
<P>
After Edberg returned his serve long on match point, Becker whirled and heaved 
his racket 20 rows up into the stands of Centre Court. 
</P>
<P>
Becker did not mourn its loss. 
</P>
<P>
"The racket is gone with the wind," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
And the West German one-time boy wonder is very much with us. The 21-year-old 
Becker, who was forced to play Sunday's final the day after finishing off Ivan 
Lendl in a grueling five-set semifinal, never allowed Edberg much of a chance. 
</P>
<P>
Key to Becker's victory was the 6-0 first set, a 21-minute masterpiece that 
left Edberg reeling. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't get a great start," Edberg said. 
</P>
<P>
That was an understatement. In fact, it was the first time in 40 years that a 
player had won a set, 6-0, in the men's singles final. 
</P>
<P>
The worst was yet to come for Edberg. In the second set, he won the first point 
in the tiebreaker and lost the rest of them. 
</P>
<P>
Becker was already two sets ahead after 78 minutes of tennis. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg looked up at the dull gray sky and sighed deeply, but Becker cut his 
suffering short. With Edberg serving at 4-4 in the third set, he lost a 40-0 
lead and was broken when he double-faulted at break point. 
</P>
<P>
Serving for the championship, Becker calmly drilled Edberg into the sod. 
Becker's second serve on the first match point was still too much for the Swede 
to handle. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg returned the ball long and shook hands with Becker, who then decided to 
throw his racket with no fear of being fined. 
</P>
<P>
Becker became the youngest male three-time Wimbledon champion at 21 years, 7 
months. The fifth player in the post World War II era to win at least three 
Wimbledon titles, Becker joins Rod Laver, John Newcombe, Bjorn Borg and John 
McEnroe in that group. 
</P>
<P>
A two-time champion by age 18, Becker said he appreciates this triumph more 
than the others, possibly because of his second-round Wimbledon loss in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"The early victories were more like a fairy tale," he said. "It wasn't true, 
really. I didn't know what I was doing. 
</P>
<P>
"But over the last two or three years, I had to work much harder than I ever, 
ever had," he said. "And so I feel much more proud now than in my early years. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, I didn't know what it was like if you lose second round at Wimbledon, or 
what it was like if you suddenly are not going up every time and then you go 
down suddenly," he said. "I had to go through those experiences. And that made 
me a little bit tougher." 
</P>
<P>
Becker won Wimbledon in his first try in 1985 when he was 17. He won again in 
1986, but as a two-time defending champion, Becker lost to Peter Doohan of 
Australia in the second round of the 1987 tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"Losing was very important," Becker said. "There I had to realize that not 
everything is sunshine and not everything is good and sometimes you have a bad 
experience and you lose and you don't know why. 
</P>
<P>
"And then you have to dig deep down and find the answer. Then you have to work 
to come back. I'm glad it happened in 1987 when I was, you know, still a young 
boy. You know, now, I'm so much older." 
</P>
<P>
Richer, too. Becker earned $330,600 for his victory. 
</P>
<P>
For Edberg, his defeat could be tied directly to the misdirection of his most 
reliable weapon, his volleys. They had always seemed to find the right location 
in his semifinal victory over McEnroe, but they failed him at a crucial moment 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg broke Becker in the 11th game of the second set and was serving at 6-5 
to even the match at one set all. 
</P>
<P>
He led 40-0 and 40-15 but then dumped three consecutive volleys into the net. 
</P>
<P>
At break point, Edberg's lunged to hit a backhand first volley and popped it 
long. Edberg admitted that those missed volleys wounded him deeply. 
</P>
<P>
"Losing that game hurt me quite a lot," he said. "I mean, you have have 40-0, I 
think you can count on one hand as many times as I have lost in a situation 
like that. And really, this is the situation you really should stamp your 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been a different story if I had won that game," Edberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Becker's backhand was a story in itself. Throughout the tournament, it was a 
dangerous weapon, never more so than the passing shot he sent cross-court for 
0-30 with Edberg serving at 4-4 in the third set. 
</P>
<P>
Knowing that if he broke Edberg here, he could serve for the match, Becker held 
three break points at 0-40. Edberg rallied to deuce, but then wilted with a 
volley error and the fatal double fault. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg chose a poor time for his game to go flat. The victim of Michael Chang 
in the French Open final and now of Becker, Edberg is the unlucky loser of two 
consecutive Grand Slam finals. 
</P>
<P>
"I made him look a lot better maybe than he was playing," said Edberg, who was 
surprised Becker could play so well after slugging his way past Lendl the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Brett, Becker's coach, said the Lendl match actually helped. 
</P>
<P>
"For Boris, yesterday's win was the key to today's match because he was down 
and he had to fight really hard," Brett said. "That carried him through at 
least the first two sets." 
</P>
<P>
Becker's victory meant he is the dominant player at Wimbledon in the last half 
of the decade. Maybe that is what he was thinking about when Edberg was serving 
for the second set, only one point removed from putting Becker's goal further 
away. 
</P>
<P>
"Funny things happen when you're in the final," Becker said. "It's almost 
unexplainable what sometimes happens, what sometimes you miss and what 
sometimes you hit good." 
</P>
<P>
And Becker it hit plenty good. 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
Boris Becker said it was a big day for West Germany with his victory and Steffi 
Graf's. "For her to win today and for me, I thought it was just something," 
Becker said. "It may not ever happen again, you know. Maybe. Hopefully. It 
depends more on me than on her. But it's quite special." Becker, from Leimen, 
and Graf, from Bruhl, grew up only six miles apart. "I used to be the best in 
the boys' and she used to be the best in the girls', so when I was maybe nine 
and she was seven, I all the time had to hit with her," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
In their first Wimbledon doubles final, Rick Leach of Laguna Beach and Jim Pugh 
of Palos Verdes lost to John Fitzgerald of Australia and Anders Jarryd of 
Sweden, 3-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-4, 7-6 (7-4). "They are very consistent doubles 
players, (but) we played well on the big points and I think maybe that was the 
difference," Fitzgerald said. The women's doubles title went to Helena Sukova 
and Jana Novotna of Czechoslovakia, who defeated the team of Natalia Zvereva 
and Larissa Savchenko of the Soviet Union, 6-2, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
This was the first time since 1973 that both men's and women's singles finals 
were played on the same day. Jan Kodes of Czechoslovakia and Billie Jean King 
won their finals on the same day in 1973. . . . Becker's $330,600 earnings 
Sunday made him the sixth male to pass $5 million in career prize money. He is 
sixth on the all-time prize money list behind Ivan Lendl, John McEnroe, Jimmy 
Connors, Mats Wilander and Stefan Edberg. . . . Becker's 6-0 first set marked 
the first time since 1923 that the men's final began with a love-set. That 
year, Americans William Johnson defeated Francis T. Hunter, 6-0, 6-3, 6-1. . . 
. Edberg did not have an ace in the match.

<P>
The message strung on Steffi Graf's racket was heard again at Wimbledon, where 
it reverberated around Centre Court until, finally, Martina Navratilova heard 
it, too. 
</P>
<P>
"I got beat . . . she beat me," Navratilova said. "She aced me on the last 
point and that's about how the match went." 
</P>
<P>
Three sets, over and out, Graf won her second consecutive Wimbledon title 
Sunday in pretty much routine fashion. Just like last year, Graf lost a set to 
Navratilova, but that was all. 
</P>
<P>
With a forehand flourish, the West German pinned a 6-2, 6-7 (7-1), 6-1, defeat 
on Navratilova, her primary foe on the women's tennis scene, and walked off 
Centre Court with scarcely a grass stain to smudge her reputation. 
</P>
<P>
Was there ever a doubt? Well, sort of. Navratilova owned the second-set 
tiebreaker with indisputable volleys, but that was really her only great 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
Graf, who broke Navratilova's serve twice in the first set and twice again in 
the third, won the championship on the dead run, sprinting into corners to find 
winning shots. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Graf wept openly at the side of the court. It was a victory she 
longed for dearly. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to win it so badly and I worked quite a bit for it," Graf said. 
"There was really much inside of me that I really wanted to win it for some 
reason and that's why I was giving everything for it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too much," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Graf was clearly too much for Navratilova to handle. Even though grass is 
Navratilova's surface of choice, it was Graf who won its affections. 
</P>
<P>
Central to Graf's victory was when she broke Navratilova's serve for a 3-1 lead 
in the third set. Graf won three points on crucial volley errors by 
Navratilova. 
</P>
<P>
Graf began the game with a backhand cross-court passing shot and was then the 
recipient of a devastating string of misplaced volleys by Navratilova. 
</P>
<P>
0-15: First volley, a forehand, into the net. 
</P>
<P>
0-30: First volley, a forehand, long. 
</P>
<P>
0-40: Second volley, a forehand, into the net. 
</P>
<P>
Only one more chance appeared for Navratilova to break back. In the next game, 
she caught Graf coming in and paralyzed her with a forehand passing shot to 
30-40. 
</P>
<P>
But at break point, Navratilova sliced a backhand approach long and Graf 
eventually escaped. 
</P>
<P>
"It was about a foot long, and that was it," Navratilova said. 
</P>
<P>
Graf, who made 77% of her first serves during the match, was particularly 
accurate in the third set when she made 19 of 22. 
</P>
<P>
She broke Navratilova a final time for a 5-1 lead. A backhand service return 
winner, at 30-30, set up break point, which Graf quickly converted when she 
returned serve to Navratilova, who popped it into the net. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, it was over. At 40-15, double match point, Graf blistered her ace, shook 
hands with the vanquished and buried her head in her hands. 
</P>
<P>
Comparing the newest title to last year's victory was difficult for Graf. 
</P>
<P>
"They're two different wins," she said. "And both times, I had a feeling, a joy 
of winning as never in any other tournament before. 
</P>
<P>
"It was different going into the finals than, for example, last year," she 
said. "Not too many people were really saying 'She can do it' or 'She still is 
tough for her.' But this time more people were believing in me." 
</P>
<P>
It's difficult not to trust in Graf anymore. She has won five of the last six 
Grand Slam titles. Navratilova, who was the loser in two of them at Wimbledon, 
said she wishes she could have played a better match. 
</P>
<P>
"Mentally, I feel I'm right up there, but today I couldn't . . . I mean that 
was the best that I could do," Navratilova said. "Obviously to win today I 
needed to play a little better and another day I may be playing my best tennis 
and Steffi may be playing her average, in which case I would win." 
</P>
<P>
Graf wasn't so sure. She thought Navratilova may have psyched herself out by 
placing so much emphasis on winning Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just that I don't know how much she believed she could do it today," Graf 
said. "It's just she was preparing so well for the tournament and trying 
everything to win it . . . there is a plus, it's to my advantage." 
</P>
<P>
Graf is 20, Navratilova 32, and they aren't getting any closer together in age. 
That is also to Graf's advantage, as if she needs any more. 
</P>
<P>
But as Wimbledon heads into the 1990s, Graf said she will come back next year 
to try for a third consecutive championship. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova, who once won six consecutive here and shares the record of eight 
overall, is also thinking about coming back to Wimbledon next year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm planning on it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Next year, Steffi? 
</P>
<P>
"I can be much better," she said.

WITT LOOKS LIKE AN ACE AGAIN, 9-3;

Mike Witt was expected to carry the Angel pitching staff this season, but until 
now, has been the weak link to a surprisingly strong corps. 
</P>
<P>
Pitchers have set the pace for the Angels, but without much help from Witt, who 
for years has been the team's ace. He was 3-7 on June 12. 
</P>
<P>
But Witt (7-7) gained his fourth consecutive victory Sunday as the Angels 
entered the All-Star break with a 9-3 victory over Minnesota, which has lost 
six in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal was to be 8-7 at the break," Whitt said. "But coming from where I was, 
7-7 is not bad at all. This is definitely the best staff I've ever been on. 
</P>
<P>
"That's helped me a lot, because I've struggled. But I finally realized I 
didn't have to go out there and pitch a shutout every time, just do my best." 
</P>
<P>
Witt went seven innings, giving up six hits and two runs as the Angels held the 
opposition to three runs or fewer for the 13th consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
The Twins have been victimized in seven of those games, their only victory 
coming 2-1 last Sunday in Minnesota. The Twins have lost six in a row since 
that triumph by left-hander Frank Viola. 
</P>
<P>
"That team obviously is too much for us to handle," Minnesota Manager Tom Kelly 
said. "We used four pitchers and none of them could stop them. And I can't say 
enough about their pitching." 
</P>
<P>
Brian Downing's two-run homer and Johnny Ray's two-run single keyed the Angels' 
15-hit attack. 
</P>
<P>
With their third consecutive victory and 13th in 16 games, the Angels swept 
into the annual All-Star break with a record of 52-33, best in the major 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Wally Joyner opened the second with a single before Downing hit his ninth 
homer, off Allan Anderson (9-7) for a 2-1 lead. Minnesota took a 1-0 lead in 
the inning on Gary Gaetti's 16th homer. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Schofield doubled in the third and scored on Joyner's single to make it 
3-1 and the Angels added an unearned run in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Armas singled and was safe at second when Lance Parrish's grounder to 
short was juggled by Greg Gagne for an error. Schofield then doubled home 
Armas. 
</P>
<P>
California made it 6-1 against reliever Mike Dyer in the sixth on Ray's single. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Larkin singled and Brian Harper doubled with no outs in the seventh, but 
the Twins managed only one run on Doug Baker's sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels made it 7-2 in the bottom of the inning on Parrish's RBI single. 
Kent Hrbek homered for the Twins in the eighth, his ninth.

WITT KEEPS ROLLING, TWINS STILL REELING AT THE ALL-STAR BREAK 
</P>

The winningest team in baseball will have but two representatives in Tuesday's 
All-Star game, which has proven a minor annoyance in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
But as Brian Downing, the Angels' long-time designated hitter, says, an 
All-Star snub is nothing compared to all the World Series snubs he has seen. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd much rather have the ring that comes from October than the ring that comes 
from July," said Downing, who will spend Tuesday at home with his family 
despite a .312 batting average. 
</P>
<P>
"If you'd ask me in spring training to make a choice -- first place at the 
All-Star break or making the All-Star team from a fifth-place team, you don't 
have to ask me which one I'd pick." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, Angels can't be choosers. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's 9-3 victory over the Minnesota Twins brought an end to one of the most 
remarkable first halves in Angel history. The team's turnaround, though still 
only half-baked, has been stunningly swift. 
</P>
<P>
After back-to-back 75-87 finishes in 1987 and 1988, the Angels are 19 games 
over .500 at 52-33, the best record in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
After placing 29 games behind the Oakland Athletics in the American League West 
last season, the Angels lead the A's by 1 1/2 games and the rest of the West by 
at least 3 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
After finishing 13th out of 14 AL clubs in team ERA last season, the Angels own 
the lowest ERA (2.89) in the league, along with a pitching staff that has 
limited the opposition to three runs or fewer in the Angels' last 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
If the rest of baseball has been slow to notice and it winds up costing the 
Angels an extra name or two on the AL All-Star roster, Downing believes the 
club can live with it. 
</P>
<P>
"We've turned the organization around," Downing announced. "We've got our 
confidence back. This is basically the foundation we need to have if we're 
going to win it all." 
</P>
<P>
Win it all? 
</P>
<P>
Downing nodded. 
</P>
<P>
"I was making these same comments in spring training," he said. "I said then 
that I could see us winning it all . . . or I could see us finishing fifth. I 
thought we could win if we had a return to health of several starting pitchers, 
we stayed away from any more injuries and we had six or seven guys on a 20-home 
run pace. 
</P>
<P>
"At the halfway point, those are the factors that have gotten us where we are." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, the Angels completed a three-game sweep of Minnesota, which improved 
the team's record against the Twins to 6-1. In their last home stand before the 
All-Star break, the Angels went 6-1. In their last 16 games, the Angels are 
13-3. 
</P>
<P>
And the latest victory was a much-awaited one. With it, Mike Witt (7-7) finally 
returned to the .500 level -- a statistic that underscores the startling 
effectiveness of the Angels' pitching rotation. With Witt basically missing in 
action for 2 1/2 months, the Angels still have been able to play better than 
.600 baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best staff I've ever been on -- definitely," Witt said. "And 
that's saying something, because we had an awesome staff in '86." 
</P>
<P>
The difference, Witt surmised, is depth. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, somebody else is doing the job I used to do," he said. "Somebody 
else is winning games and stopping losing streaks. That's helped me a lot this 
year while I've been struggling. It took a little of the pressure off." 
</P>
<P>
Witt threw seven innings against the Twins, giving up two runs on six hits. One 
was a second-inning home run by Gary Gaetti, one of Minnesota's two All-Stars. 
The Twins scored their second run in the seventh when Gene Larkin hit a single, 
moved to third on Brian Harper's double and came home on Doug Baker's sacrifice 
fly. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Witt led, 6-2. The Angels added another run in the bottom of the 
seventh before Angel Manager Doug Rader summoned reliever Willie Fraser to 
finish the job. 
</P>
<P>
From 3-7 to 7-7, Witt, like the Angels, has taken the long road back. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal the last five games was to get to 8-7 by the break," Witt said. "The 
last game, I kinda gave up a lead (Witt received no decision in a 5-2 Angel 
victory over Texas), but to be 7-7 after where I was at before is not bad. 
Hopefully, I can go from there." 
</P>
<P>
The Angel offense pounded four Minnesota pitchers -- including starter Allan 
Anderson (9-7) and reliever Jeff Reardon -- for 15 hits. Downing's two-run home 
run in the second inning, his ninth of the season, was the biggest blow, but 
significant contributions were also provided by Dick Schofield (two doubles and 
a single), Johnny Ray (two hits, two RBIs), Wally Joyner (two hits, one RBI) 
and Lance Parrish (two hits, one RBI). 
</P>
<P>
When the pounding stopped, the Angels packed their belongings to make room for 
the American League All-Stars and paused to reflect on a first half well done. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys we have going to the All-Star Game should definitely go there with 
their heads up," left fielder Chili Davis said. "They're not only representing 
the home team, but a first-place home team. That's a good feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of whether or not Chuck Finley and Devon White are enough Angel 
All-Stars. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
It's the traditional dilemma that confronts a streaking team come All-Star 
time: To break or not to break. "It's a mixed blessing," Angel Manager Doug 
Rader admitted. "We have a number of guys who can use the rest -- Tony Armas, 
Brian Downing, Lance Parrish, Chili (Davis), even Johnny Ray. We've had to use 
a very small number of players a long time. We don't platoon much. Yet, at the 
same time, you don't like to see a pitching staff that's going so well to sit 
down for three days. But if I had to choose, I'd rather have a full-rested team 
to begin the second half." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' 52-33 record is their best at the All-Star break. The only other 
years in which they've had 50 or more victories by the All-Star Game were 1970 
(51-35), 1979 (55-38) and 1985 (52-35). This also marks the sixth time the 
Angels have led the AL West at the break. The Angels' biggest lead at the 
All-Star Game was six games, in 1985. That team eventually finished second, one 
game behind Kansas City.

PITCHERS' PARADISE;

'67 GAME WAS A MOUND OF FUN WITH TWILIGHT START AND A SYMPATHETIC UMPIRE 
</P>

<P>
Twilight was never Dean Chance's favorite time. 
</P>
<P>
In the early years of the Angels, he and Bo Belinsky, who combined to cut a 
swath wider than the Sunset Strip, were at their best when the night was 
darkest and the neons were brightest. 
</P>
<P>
But as Chance, then 26 and a member of the Minnesota Twins, walked into Anaheim 
Stadium in mid-afternoon on July 11, 1967, he was given reason to believe, he 
recounted recently, that his twilight assignment as the American League's 
starting pitcher in the first All-Star game at the Big A might lead to 
something special -- or unusual, at least. 
</P>
<P>
"Walking in that day I happened to run into a gentleman named Ed Runge and he 
said to me, 'Dean, we're going for the record today.' I didn't know what he 
meant at the time, but I found out a few hours later." 
</P>
<P>
What the hitters couldn't see in the twilight shadows, plate umpire Runge 
could. 
</P>
<P>
Known as a pitchers' umpire with a strike zone that Ron Luciano, a former 
American League umpire turned author, once decribed as stretching from dugout 
to dugout, Runge would emerge as the only umpire to receive consideration for 
the All-Star game's Outstanding Performer Award. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Perez of the Cincinnati Reds received the award for hitting a home run 
that mercifully ended history's longest All-Star game, which the National 
League won in 15 innings, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
The NL had come in with a team batting average of .306. The American League 
averaged .273. But it became a game to be remembered for futility and failure 
as Chance and 11 other pitchers took advantage of Runge's strike zone and the 
4:15 twilight zone to register an All-Star record 30 strikeouts, 11 called. 
</P>
<P>
"No umpire ever lived who had a strike zone as big as Ed Runge's," Chance said. 
"I once gave him a gold cigarette lighter with the inscription, 'To the 
Greatest Strikeout Man in Baseball History.' Of course, he couldn't use it 
until he retired." 
</P>
<P>
Chance, 48, lives in Wooster, Ohio. He has managed boxers and carnivals and now 
operates the midway at the Ohio State Fair, his life still illuminated by 
neons. 
</P>
<P>
Runge, 74, spent 17 years as an American League umpire, retired in 1970, and 
lives in San Diego. His son, Paul, umpires in the National League. 
</P>
<P>
"I once asked someone what kind of strike zone Paul had and they said, 'Big, 
real big,' " Chance said. "He must have learned from the old man." 
</P>
<P>
The senior Runge laughed when informed of Chance's recollections and said he 
walked into Anaheim Stadium that day with the other umpires, that he did not 
encounter the AL's starting pitcher, that he would never have told a player 
they were going for a record and he did not recall receiving a cigarette 
lighter from Chance. 
</P>
<P>
"Dean has always been a little wacky," Runge said. 
</P>
<P>
Our memories play tricks, of course. Sometimes conveniently, sometimes not. The 
march of time erodes details, but neither Runge nor Chance are on trial here. 
The commissioner has enough problems, and there are other witnesses to Runge's 
role in that game. 
</P>
<P>
John Hall, who covered the game for The Times, alluded to the strikeouts in his 
lead as he wrote: 
</P>
<P>
"It was a burning, boiling Orange County afternoon, but baseball's biggest 
hitters selfishly turned on all the fans." 
</P>
<P>
Perez, now a coach with the Reds, recalled, "Between the umpire and the 
shadows, the hitters didn't have a chance. Roberto Clemente struck out four 
times. That tells you how tough it was." 
</P>
<P>
Perez added that he got lucky in the 15th inning, that Jim (Catfish) Hunter 
simply threw a pitch that hit his bat, that he didn't get a good look at it and 
was as surprised as anyone that he hit it out. 
</P>
<P>
In a game that featured 16 future Hall of Famers, American League hitters 
struck out 17 times, NL hitters 13. 
</P>
<P>
Richie Allen homered off Chance in the second inning, then struck out three 
times. Tony Oliva, a .304 career hitter, also struck out three times. Mickey 
Mantle and Willie Mays struck out as pinch-hitters. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson Jenkins, the second National League pitcher, struck out six in three 
innings, an All-Star record he still shares. Jenkins also gave up the only 
American League run on a sixth-inning homer by Brooks Robinson, who was hitless 
in his other five at-bats, striking out twice. 
</P>
<P>
Al Downing, then with the New York Yankees and now a radio talk- show host, 
reflected on his two-inning stint as the American League's fourth pitcher, and 
said: 
</P>
<P>
"The hitters knew they had to be hacking at anything around the plate. Runge's 
reputation preceded him. Bill Freehan was catching that day and I had never 
thrown to him. But I remember that the first thing he said to me when I came in 
was, 'Let's go for a Runge strike.' That meant low and away. You could throw it 
six inches off the plate early in the count and get a strike. But once you had 
two strikes, he (Runge) made you throw it over the plate. I don't know if he 
was a pitchers' umpire as much as he wanted to see the hitters up there 
swinging and quick games." 
</P>
<P>
Although lasting 15 innings, the game took a relatively short 3 hours 41 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Torre, who caught the early innings for the National League and now does 
commentary on Angel telecasts, said: 
</P>
<P>
"We had Juan Marichal pitching with Carl Yastrzemski up and Juan threw two 
pitches out of the strike zone that Runge called strikes and Yaz spun around 
and said, 'those weren't strikes and you know it.' 
</P>
<P>
"But Runge said, 'That's my strike zone,' and when I heard that I moved even 
farther outside. I knew between the time of day, the caliber of pitching and 
that strike zone, it would have to get dark before anyone would get a pitch 
they could see. It's going to be tough again Tuesday night." 
</P>
<P>
Torre referred to the 60th All-Star game and the second to be played at Anaheim 
Stadium, which has been enclosed by outfield seating since 1967 but again will 
be bathed in shadows for the 5:30 start. 
</P>
<P>
The twilight start in '67 marked the first such All-Star concession to 
television and the prime-time Eastern viewers. There have been five West Coast 
All-Star games that started in the outdoor twilight and they produced a total 
of only 25 runs, or five per game. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get guys like Nolan Ryan and Dave Stewart and Chuck Finley busting 
the ball between 5:30 and 7:30, there aren't going to be a lot or runs scored 
in this game either," said Bill Rigney, an adviser with the Oakland Athletics 
now and manager of the Angels in 1967, when he served as the American League's 
third-base coach. 
</P>
<P>
"The twilight had a lot to do with it, but I think it was more Runge," Rigney 
said. "He was one of the American League's best umpires, but if you had to 
categorize him, he was definitely a pitcher's man. They knew that if they got 
the ball near the plate, it would be a strike. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember when I was managing at Minnesota that I told Ed we had just brought 
up a kid he was going to love because he threw nothing but strikes. I was 
talking about Bert Blyleven." 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven, now 38, remains a control specialist who is enjoying a rebirth with 
the Angels but was snubbed in the All-Star selections and doesn't expect to 
attend Tuesday night's game as a spectator. 
</P>
<P>
Runge was present Sunday for the Equitable Old-Timers game and said he would 
stay to see Tuesday night's game, reliving memories. 
</P>
<P>
Was it the twilight or strike zone in '67? 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was more me with my usual strike zone," Runge said. "I was known as 
a pitcher's umpire and that didn't bother me. If the ball got any part of the 
plate it was a strike. I wanted to see the hitters swinging. That's what the 
fans paid to see. But I didn't change my zone depending on the count or batter. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember Billy Martin saying, 'He's a pitcher's umpire, but he's consistent. 
He doesn't call 'em any differently for a .200 or .300 hitter.' There were 30 
strikeouts in that game, but only one or two guys turned around to question a 
call." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it was because they couldn't question what they couldn't see. 
</P>
<P>
"When the game ended, Bill Murray (an administrator in the commissioner's 
office) came into our dressing room and said I had missed by only a couple 
votes of winning the MVP award," Runge said. "He said that if the winning run 
had scored on a couple singles I might have won it, but with the home run they 
had to give it to Perez. Too bad. I'd have hung it right in my game room."

<P>
FOR PADRE PITCHING ACE WHITSON, 18 MONTHS IN NEW YORK WAS A 'LIVING HELL' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Padres are here to play the Pirates, but the subject is New York, 
and Ed Whitson has difficulty formulating the proper words to describe the 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
This is a time in his life that he has longed to forget, a time in which he 
became closer than anyone would know to quitting baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday was the three-year anniversary of the day he escaped the shackles of 
playing for the New York Yankees, and for the first time since being traded 
back to the Padres, Whitson spoke extensively about the 18 months that he 
described as a "living hell." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking ever so softly, almost in a whisper, Whitson said: "There wasn't a day 
that went by where I didn't fear for my life, or the safety of my family. Every 
day I went out that door I wondered what would happen to me. I didn't know if 
I'd be shot. I didn't know if somebody'd blow up my car. I didn't know if 
somebody'd run me off the road. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I was carrying a bull's-eye on my back, waiting for someone to 
take that first shot." 
</P>
<P>
Bizarre as it sounds, Whitson says that if not for his days in Yankee 
pinstripes, this fantasy season he's living might not have been possible. 
</P>
<P>
He enters the All-Star break with an 11-6 record, three victories shy of his 
career best in 1984 and on pace to become the Padres' first 20-game winner 
since Gaylord Perry in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"It's crazy, isn't it?" Whitson said in his Tennessee drawl. "The worst time in 
my life might be responsible for the best time in my life. 
</P>
<P>
"Boy, who would have ever figured?" 
</P>
<P>
It's the day after Christmas, 1984. Whitson is driving to his Dublin, Ohio, 
home from the Columbus International Airport, thinking about an offer from 
Yankee owner George Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
A five-year contract that would guarantee him $4.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Shoot, the most money he'd ever seen in his life while growing up was the 
$5,000 the Pittsburgh Pirates offered him out of high school. And now someone 
wants to provide him financial security for life? 
</P>
<P>
When he reaches home, he tells his wife, Kathleen, of the offer. He knows it 
sounds crazy to be talking about living in New York, but even a person like 
himself from the back hills of Tennessee can figure out that $4.4 million over 
five years is a whole heck of a lot better than the $2.8 million over four 
years that the Padres are offering to keep him. 
</P>
<P>
In a matter of an hour, he telephones his agent, Tom Reich, who is on a skiing 
vacation in Utah. The next afternoon, he is a member of the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Whitson got off to a 1-6 start with the Yankees and was receiving death threats 
at his home and in the clubhouse. But his real troubles began in the wee hours 
of the morning of Sept. 22, 1985, when he and Yankee Manager Billy Martin got 
into a barroom brawl. 
</P>
<P>
The fight started in a hotel bar in Baltimore, went into the lobby, carried 
into the parking lot and concluded on the fourth floor of their hotel. It 
remains in Yankee folklore as one of the best knock-down-drag-out fights in 
team history. 
</P>
<P>
Martin came away with a broken arm. 
</P>
<P>
Whitson was terrified over what Yankee fans would now do to him. 
</P>
<P>
He already was taking every necessary precaution for his family, sending them 
home to Ohio one day before every trip and having them return one day after he 
returned, but now he envisioned the worst. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Whitson, Ed's youngest brother who had been laid off from work at the 
nuclear plant back in Tennessee for 11 1/2 months and was struggling just to 
put food on the table, telephoned Eddie the moment he put down the paper. They 
must have talked for hours, he said, but it was of no use. He had never heard 
Eddie sound so depressed in all his life. 
</P>
<P>
"I was having problems at the time, plenty of 'em," Randy Whitson said. "But 
mine weren't . . . compared to Eddie's. To tell you the truth, I was scared for 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Doug Harrison, Whitson's longtime buddy from Erwin, Tenn., flew to New York. 
</P>
<P>
"All I tried to do was take his mind off it as much as I could," Harrison said. 
"But he was pretty miserable. I told him, 'Look how far you've gotten in life. 
Come on, don't let something like this stop you.' 
</P>
<P>
"I reminded him that he's his own person, and there hasn't been a Whitson that 
I've met yet who isn't tougher than nails. I remember growing up, you could be 
walking around town feeling kind of tough, and then all of a sudden you'd have 
some rocks coming out of nowhere at you. Right away you knew that was one of 
the Whitson boys from Rock Creek." 
</P>
<P>
New York is a long way from Rock Creek, though, and the way of life in the Big 
Apple was something that Whitson never had experienced -- and, he vows, he 
never again will. 
</P>
<P>
Whitson said he could have tolerated the boos night after night. Maybe he could 
have even overlooked the tacks and nails from irate fans that littered his 
driveway on occasion. But those threats. Those ugly phone calls. He could not 
take any more. 
</P>
<P>
"We had guys, FBI agents, in our locker room, in the tunnel and in the dugout," 
Whitson said. "Lord knows the game of baseball is big business, but it wasn't 
worth risking your life over. 
</P>
<P>
"I was struggling, and I could understand why people were upset, but I refused 
to take my life in my own hands every time I went out there." 
</P>
<P>
Whitson's emotions were in such disarray that Lou Piniella, who became the 
Yankee manager in 1986, had to completely juggle his pitching staff. Whitson 
would start only in road games; he'd pitch at Yankee Stadium strictly in 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
"Even then, it didn't do any good," Piniella said. "When he walked to the 
bullpen, he wouldn't even walk across the field. He always walked under the 
stands. 
</P>
<P>
"He just became useless here. Even when I called for him in the bullpen, he'd 
get real fidgety. He was worrying about everything except getting batters out. 
</P>
<P>
"He got off to a bad start with the fans anyway because he was struggling, and 
then when they found out they were getting to him, it just snowballed. And once 
he had the problem with Billy Martin, well, what can I say, he became a basket 
case." 
</P>
<P>
Whitson, with no other recourse, turned to Steinbrenner. He asked out. Trade 
me, he pleaded, please trade me. 
</P>
<P>
"When I signed Ed, I promised him that if things don't work out, I'd do my 
damnedest to send him to where he wanted," Steinbrenner said. "I knew what he 
was going through. He had problems with Billy Martin, but lots of guys here 
have had problems with Billy. But all of the other things he was going through, 
I couldn't keep him here. 
</P>
<P>
"I know things didn't work out here for Ed, but never once did he complain. He 
took his share of slings and arrows, believe me. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll always respect Ed because he was a real man. He never whimpered to me or 
made excuses like a lot of these guys do nowadays. He took it all without 
saying a word. 
</P>
<P>
"I know we didn't get what we should have in return for Ed, but he's a 
tremendous person. Whatever good things come to him in this game he deserves." 
</P>
<P>
Said Whitson: "A lot of people thought George Steinbrenner was a bad man, but 
I'll tell you right now, I'll respect him to the day. He's as honest as any man 
I've ever met."

KLIMCHOCK, 18, WINS LA JOLLA TENNIS TITLE;

<P>
Experience meant nothing against youth and confidence Sunday in the women's 
open singles finals at the 73rd Robins Group La Jolla Tennis Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Unseeded Luann Klimchock, an 18-year-old freshman at Arizona State University, 
won almost every big point, including five in a row to end the match, in 
beating 27-year-old and No. 1 seeded Lisa Seemann of Solvang, 6-3, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's open finals, 23-year-old Scott Patridge of La Jolla defeated 
30-year-old Jack Kruger of La Jolla, 6-2, 3-6, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
The match and the second set appeared to be slipping away from Klimchock, who 
graduated from high school in Tempe, Ariz., a semester early to attend Arizona 
State, as she faced three set points in the tiebreaker. But Klimchock surprised 
Seemann, who played at UC Santa Barbara from 1981-85, with her aggressive play. 
</P>
<P>
Klimchock, named to the West team for the U.S. Olympic Festival in Oklahoma 
this month, hit two forehand volley winners and a deep serve which Seemann hit 
into the net, to tie the score, 6-6. She then hit a backhand passing shot up 
the line and another deep, unreturnable serve to close out the match. 
</P>
<P>
Strangely enough, Klimchock said she never felt threatened. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt good about my game the whole week," she said. "I had nothing to lose. I 
won the big points. I tried not to think about them -- just play." 
</P>
<P>
Klimchock said her volleying was the difference in the tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a few balls where I could (have) let them drop, but I caught them 
in the air and caught her off guard," said Klimchock, whose father, Lou, played 
baseball with Cleveland, Kansas City, the New York Yankees and the Milwaukee 
Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Patridge's power game proved to be too strong for the charging and 
slicing game of Kruger. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not used to playing against a guy that hits the ball that hard," said the 
fourth-seeded Kruger, who is playing his first singles tournament in two years. 
"He was keeping pressure on my serve by hitting low returns and I wasn't doing 
enough with his serve." 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Patridge, who played at USD, said his plan was to hit the ball 
with as much speed as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured that's how I would keep Jack off his game and off the net," Patridge 
said.

PACIFIC RIM TALK; 
</P>
<P>
ELOQUENT -- AND INTERESTING -- SEMINAR SPEAKERS ARE HARD TO COME BY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taking advantage of growing American interest in the Pacific Rim, more 
organizations are sponsoring seminars on business opportunities in Asia. The 
economies of the Pacific Rim are growing -- as a subject for conferences. 
</P>
<P>
With the growth in conferencing comes a spate of speakers-for-hire, a growing 
number of "Pac Rimmers" ready and willing to tell companies how to ride the 
Asian economic tide. Some come with interesting and helpful presentations, and 
others come with dull speeches and hidden agendas. 
</P>
<P>
As the ranks of traveling Pac Rim "experts" swell, conference organizers -- 
faced with more and more competition for seminar dollars -- are beginning to 
cast a more critical eye at podium candidates as part of an effort to identify 
entertaining and informative speakers. 
</P>
<P>
Conference organizers and leading speakers say the quality of presentations can 
vary widely because the ranks of the eligible range from executives with weak 
public speaking skills to university professors with little or no understanding 
of the business world. 
</P>
<P>
"Speakers can make or break a conference," said Jack Lewis, who organizes 
Pacific Rim conferences for USC's International Business Education and Research 
program. "An instructor must have content and good delivery skills. It doesn't 
do anyone any good if a speaker is knowledgeable but doesn't know how to keep 
the participants interested." 
</P>
<P>
IBEAR, which has a tradition of preparing seminars, has produced conferences on 
the Asian economies since 1985. However, many other organizations -- for 
example, some management consultants, accounting firms, business chambers, 
trade groups and foundations -- have only recently begun to sponsor Pac Rim 
conferences. Some of the newer sponsors sometimes have difficulty getting 
desired speakers, according to Richard Drobnick, an economist and director of 
IBEAR. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Invitation a Week 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big growth industry . . . and many conferences are lousy," Drobnick 
said. "Often, important people are put in a position where they don't want to 
speak. They don't want to say anything controversial. That situation produces a 
lot of yawns." 
</P>
<P>
Drobnick, among the nation's most popular Pacific Rim speakers, said he gets 
about one invitation per week. 
</P>
<P>
"The demand (for speakers) has really taken off in the last couple of years," 
Drobnick said. "Sponsors want to get someone who knows something about business 
in that region. That may sound silly, but it's not unusual for a conference to 
present someone who doesn't know very much. In those situations, the 
(speaker's) staff writes a speech." 
</P>
<P>
IBEAR tries to ensure quality by having seminar participants grade their 
conference instructors on a scale of 1 to 7 -- 7 being the top grade. 
Participants rate the speakers on clarity, knowledge, organization and other 
elements. 
</P>
<P>
IBEAR administrators say participants rank most instructors in the 5-to-7 
range. In most cases, IBEAR relays those grades to the speakers. However, a 
small number are given low grades and are not invited to speak at subsequent 
seminars, IBEAR administrators said. They said ratings are not relayed to 
speakers in those cases. 
</P>
<P>
Among those getting kudos from IBEAR and other conference organizers are two 
China scholars -- William A. Fischer of the University of North Carolina and 
Denis F. Simon of Tufts. Thomas Gold of the University of California-Berkeley 
is rated among the best speakers on Taiwan. Yu Sang Chang of Boston University, 
a specialist on Korea, also makes the "best-address" list of some sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
The list of so-called stars has lengthened as more and more management 
consultants and corporate executives join academicians on the circuit. One of 
the most respected speakers in this "business world" group -- Berkeley-based 
consultant Tom Lifson -- condemns those who use conferences for personal 
ax-grinding. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Awkward Situation 
</P>
<P>
"These people," Lifson said, "are not so interested in enlightening the 
audience. They have ulterior motives. I've seen speakers who provide a 
professional service, try to highlight the need for their service -- try to 
sell their service. That's uncomfortable for the audience and embarrassing to 
fellow members of the panel." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, some academicians irritate their audience by presenting 
theory without a practical context, according to Christopher Engholm, a San 
Diego business consultant who has frequently attended conferences. Engholm, who 
has business experience in China, said he sometimes chafes when a professor 
focuses on studies in a narrow academic discipline, a field that only remotely 
relates to business. 
</P>
<P>
"One conference presented two graduate students who actually read their 
dissertation," Engholm recalled. "After listening to a dynamic speaker, having 
someone read to you can be pretty anticlimactic. Later, someone asked them a 
business-related question and they couldn't give an answer. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes," Engholm continued, "you get a muddle-headed academic who studies 
surveys and reads the Harvard Business Review, but has very little hands-on 
experience. I've seen audiences get pretty frustrated with that." 
</P>
<P>
While conferees, conference organizers and leading seminar speakers sometimes 
differ over the most redeeming qualities of a conference speaker, they all 
subscribe to one philosophy: Know the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"The best speakers have a feel for the needs of the audience," explained Diana 
Rowland, author of "Japanese Business Etiquette" and a speaker. "Some make a 
mistake by not speaking on the same level as the audience. You need to be 
knowledgeable, but you also need to provide the information in an interesting 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Sharp, a Los Angeles-based vice president at Manufacturers Hanover, said 
he uses humor to get his audience to relax and be more receptive. 
</P>
<P>
"I often tell them that the first 38 years in the (Asian) market are the 
hardest," said Sharp, formerly president of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Bank 
Ltd. in Tokyo. "It's important to have a touch of lightness and humor because 
financial information can be boring." 
</P>
<P>
While eloquence and wit are important to some conferees, others are more 
interested in a speaker's business contacts, according to Natasha Wolniansky, 
director of international programs for the New York-based American Management 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
"The smart executives come for the networking," she said. "That's the biggest 
selling point for the conferences -- the opportunity to network with people who 
have done business in Asia." 
</P>
<P>
Wolniansky said she prefers to present executives from firms based in the 
Pacific Basin as speakers because U.S. executives are very interested in the 
views of their Asian counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
However, Hiro Saito, a Los Angeles-based senior vice president and general 
manager at Mitsui &amp; Co., said he accepts fewer speaking invitations to 
Pacific Rim conferences. He said he has been losing interest because many 
concentrate on broad topics -- dealing with cultural differences, for example 
-- instead of nuts-and-bolts topics such as business opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Saito said he has seen a change in the approach of Japanese speakers at 
conference gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
"Japanese people generally are not outspoken . . . and have not been 
provocative," Saito observed. "Now, the Japanese are becoming more outspoken at 
these conferences."

CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY PLANNERS LOOKING TO CANADIAN POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DIETRICH, Special to The Times Dietrich writes for the Seattle Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
Each summer as demand for energy rises in California to power air conditioners, 
it falls in British Columbia as heaters switch off. At the same time, the 
Canadian rivers that can turn electric turbines are gushing with snowmelt. 
</P>
<P>
The potential symmetry of this has not been lost on West Coast energy planners, 
who increasingly talk about the possibility of a unified power line grid 
stretching from the Yukon to the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
The rewards are clear. Trading electricity between the Southwest's peak summer 
season and the Northwest's peak winter season, said Sen. Mark Hatfield 
(R-Ore.), could postpone the need for up to 7,500 megawatts of new generating 
capacity in the West, and with it the immense problems of siting new nuclear or 
coal-fired plants. 
</P>
<P>
The idea has never gone far, in part because it is imperfect symmetry. In 
reality it means that British Columbia, a province more than twice the size of 
California but with only 3 million people, would become a major supplier of 
power to the south with all the attendant problems of development and 
transmission. 
</P>
<P>
But two events may be changing the power equation: 
</P>
<P>
* British Columbia's present government sees power export as a potential 
economy booster, and publicly owned B.C. Hydro, the province's electric 
utility, has even formed an export subsidiary called Powerex. 
</P>
<P>
* The Pacific Northwest's huge Bonneville Power Administration, which has 
earned up to $600 million a year selling its own surplus hydroelectricity to 
California, has been reluctant to open its transmission lines to Canadian 
competition. But BPA Administrator Jim Jura has become more amenable to 
accepting transmission ties with Canada now that Bonneville's hydroelectric 
sales have been curbed in recent drought years and the Northwest's power 
surplus is rapidly disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
Two private Washington state utilities -- Puget Sound Power &amp; Light and 
Washington Water &amp; Power -- have proposed new cross-border transmission 
lines of their own to British Columbia. Bonneville is likely to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in an era of greater flexibility," said Sue Hickey, Bonneville's 
assistant administrator for energy resources. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Use Its Lines 
</P>
<P>
Another impetus to cooperation is that a 1961 treaty giving BPA up to 1,400 
megawatts of Canadian-owned power at a bargain price is due to begin expiring 
in 1998 and is up for renegotiation. 
</P>
<P>
In return for extending that agreement or replacing that power with other 
Canadian electricity, Jura said, BPA may be willing to make available its lines 
for Canadian export to California. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe it is time to include California interest to a much larger scale 
than we have in the past," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That is welcome news to Robert Mussetter, commissioner of the California Energy 
Commission, who is worried about the political struggle necessary to upgrade or 
replace the state's aging oil- and gas-fired plants. 
</P>
<P>
He said at a conference of Canadian and U.S. utility executives in Portland, 
Ore., this spring that energy conservation alone is unlikely to take care of 
rising demand in California. "We don't have much of a back door," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Columbia has developed only half of its economically 
feasible hydroelectric power, but has enough proposed projects in its files -- 
totaling 87,000 gigawatt hours -- to equal 47% of California's annual energy 
requirement. 
</P>
<P>
A key element still missing from the regional rapport among utility executives 
is the concurrence of environmentalists and the opposition party in British 
Columbia, who warn that flooding Canada's valleys or digging its coal to 
satisfy American energy deeds is political suicide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plan Draws Fire 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to degrade our environment to power air conditioners in 
Southern California," vowed Calvin Sanborn, staff lawyer for the West Coast 
Environmental Law Assn. in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
A B.C. Hydro proposal to build a 900-megawatt dam on the Peace River in 
northeastern British Columbia, called Site C, has enraged some 
environmentalists because it would create a 50-mile long reservoir and flood 
more than 23,000 acres of the only prime farmland in that part of the province. 
</P>
<P>
The utility is careful to emphasize that such a dam would only be for domestic 
Canadian power production. Nevertheless, the project is a powerful symbol of 
the company's intentions. 
</P>
<P>
"The government of British Columbia has said it will export power," said Anne 
Edwards, the province's Legislative Assembly member who is the opposition's 
designated energy critic. "The people of British Columbia have not." 
</P>
<P>
Sanborn and Edwards predicted that the Social Credit Party in power can expect 
energy exports to be a key campaign issue in the next election, expected next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"It clearly is an emotional issue as well as an economic one" to nationalistic 
Canadians, conceded B.C. Hydro Chairman Larry Bell. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Boatman, president of Powerex, agreed. But he said cross-border 
cooperation makes too much sense to be ignored. Powerex recently asked for 
private proposals to provide 600 megawatts of power for sale to the United 
States. Thirteen companies replied in May with various generation projects 
totaling 4,000 megawatts. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are expected to take years and take many twists and turns. 
"Everyone talks globally, but they get parochial pretty quickly," Boatman 
cautioned.

Government Rests Case: Federal prosecutors rested their case in the 
Princeton-Newport securities racketeering trial after playing a tape of a 
former Drexel Burnham Lambert trader telling a Princeton-Newport Partners LP 
executive after an alleged illegal deal: "Welcome to the world of being a 
sleaze." Also, defense lawyers declined to cross-examine Drexel Chief Executive 
Frederick H. Joseph for fear of introducing into evidence potentially damaging 
information about Drexel's $650-million plea bargain with the government. Five 
partners in the defunct Princeton-Newport brokerage and ex-Drexel trader Bruce 
Lee Newberg are on trial.

Northrop Ends F-5 Fighter Program: Northrop Corp. has ended its F-5 fighter 
program, flying the last three aircraft from Mojave to Singapore. A total of 
3,806 aircraft in the series, which included the T-38 Air Force trainer, were 
produced since 1964. The longest-running fighter production program in history, 
the F-5s were sold to 30 nations, one of every four nations in the free world, 
the company said. Northrop had previously marked the end of the F-5's foreign 
military sales program about two years ago but then sold several additional 
aircraft. It declined to identify Singapore as the customer, saying the 
identity was classified by the buying nation.

QANTAS RAIDS HONG KONG'S POOL OF TALENT; 
</P>
<P>
OFFERS PASSPORTS TO MAINTENANCE WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Financial Times of London

<TEXT>
<P>
The Australian airline, Qantas, is attempting to recruit maintenance and 
engineering staff from the Hong Kong airport by offering them jobs that will 
ultimately entitle them to Australian passports. Nearly a third of the staff 
are seriously considering the offer. 
</P>
<P>
The move, a coup for Qantas, which is desperately short of skilled engineers 
and maintenance staff, will be a further blow to confidence in Hong Kong, which 
is suffering an accelerating brain drain as its best qualified people leave in 
search of security and passports elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong government and Cathay Pacific, the colony's airline, are 
understood to have expressed concern to the Australian government in Canberra. 
Hong Kong officials also raised the issue with Sir Geoffrey Howe, the British 
foreign secretary, during his visit last week, citing it as a dramatic example 
of the crippling effect the brain drain will have on the local economy if the 
right of abode in the United Kingdom is not granted to Hong Kong people. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many May Accept 
</P>
<P>
Qantas, which is also trying to recruit in Singapore, Britain and Ireland, sent 
airline executives to Hong Kong together with an Australian immigration 
official. 
</P>
<P>
The airline interviewed more than 150 of the 400 engineering employees of 
Haeco, which provides maintenance services to airlines operating in and out of 
Hong Kong's Kai Tak international airport. Up to 130 are expected to join 
Qantas and move to Australia within two to six months, once applicants produce 
professional and technical certificates and immigration documentation. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of more than 100 licensed engineers at Haeco would deal a severe blow 
to the company. The Hong Kong government and Cathay Pacific would like the 
departures staggered over a longer period to allow Haeco time to adjust. About 
50% of Haeco's business comes from Cathay Pacific Airways, which like Haeco, is 
part of the Swire group of companies.

Gas Prices Edge Downward: Gasoline prices fell nearly two cents per gallon in 
June, defying the historical trend toward higher prices during the summer, but 
still registering 18 cents more than at the first of the year. A survey of 
12,000 gasoline stations across the country found the nationwide average for 
all grades of gasoline with taxes included was $1.1676 per gallon, said Trilby 
Lundberg, publisher of the Lundberg Letter, an industry trade publication. The 
average price of $1.1676 was a drop of about two-thirds of a cent from the last 
survey two weeks earlier.

JAPAN'S TSUTSUMI STILL TOPS FORBES' RICHEST LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Six of the 10 richest people in the world are Japanese but the United States 
still leads the world in the total number of billionaires, according to 
estimates compiled by Forbes magazine. 
</P>
<P>
For the third straight year, Yoshiaki Tsutsumi led Forbes' list of private 
billionaires even though his wealth wasn't reported to be quite as great as had 
been estimated 12 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Tsutsumi, head of Japan's Seibu Railway Group, has a personal net worth of at 
least $15 billion -- nearly $4 billion less than estimated last summer due 
mainly to a rise in the value of the dollar against other major currencies, 
Forbes said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The estimate was far greater than the $2.8 billion that Fortune magazine had 
reported as Tsutsumi's worth in its September, 1988, ranking of those whom it 
considered to be the world's richest people. 
</P>
<P>
In last year's list, Forbes estimated Tsutsumi's net worth at $18.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine reports in its July 24 issue that Tsutsumi edged out second-ranked 
Taikichiro Mori by less than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Mori, a former economics professor who owns 72 office buildings in Tokyo, has 
an estimated net worth of $14.2 billion. In last year's survey, Forbes placed 
Mori's worth at about $18 billion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Walton No. 3 
</P>
<P>
The third-richest on the list was American Sam Moore Walton, founder of the 
third-largest retail operation in the United States, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. 
Walton and his family are worth an estimated $8.7 billion, up from Forbes' 1988 
estimate of $6.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
After the Waltons came Canada's Reichmann brothers, owners of the Olympia &amp; 
York real estate empire, with a combined net worth of about $8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the 10 richest people in the world, their country and 
industries, according to Forbes, were: Shin Kyuk-ho, South Korea, candy, real 
estate, $8 billion; Hirotomo Takei and family, Japan, publishing, real estate, 
$7.8 billion; Kitaro Watanabe, Japan, real estate, hotels, $7 billion-plus; 
Haruhiko Yoshimoto and family, Japan, real estate, $7 billion; Hans and Gad 
Rausing, Sweden, liquids packaging, $7 billion; and Eitaro Itoyama, Japan, 
land, $6.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Forbes said it identified 226 individuals or families around the world with 
personal assets worth in excess of $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The United States was the country with the most billionaires, with 55 
individuals qualifying for that title. Japan ranked second with 41, and West 
Germany was third with 20. 
</P>
<P>
America also accounted for the most billionaires in the 1988 survey, 47, 
followed by Japan's 32 and West Germany's 16. 
</P>
<P>
Among the richest of the world's rich are people who didn't necessarily come by 
their money in an honest way. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not All Legitimate 
</P>
<P>
Colombia's cocaine barons, for instance, are still putting away piles of money 
from selling the illegal drug even though profit margins in the cocaine trade 
have been shrinking in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Three of them made Forbes "World Billionaires" list, including Pablo Escobar 
Gaviria, leader of the notorious Medellin cocaine cartel, with an estimated 
personal net worth of $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In compiling its list, Forbes does not consider royal families and heads of 
state "because their wealth derives more from political heritage than from 
economic effort."

KIDNAP VICTIM DECRIES MYTH OF MOUNTAIN MEN 
</P>

<P>
On July 15, 1984, athlete Kari Swenson was kidnaped while running on a mountain 
trail near this resort town about 20 miles north of Yellowstone National Park. 
</P>
<P>
Her abductors -- who the next morning shot Kari through the chest and killed 
one of her rescuers -- were self-proclaimed mountain men Don Nichols, 53, and 
his 18-year-old son, Dan. They had long shunned society, hiding out in the 
mountains and surviving on squirrel meat, poached livestock and caches of red 
beans. They believed that it was all right to kidnap a wife. 
</P>
<P>
That's what they had in mind for Swenson, then one of America's top competitors 
in the biathlon, a sport that combines cross-country skiing and target 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Subject of Extensive Media Coverage 
</P>
<P>
The kidnaping, Swenson's rescue and the subsequent six-month hunt for the 
kidnapers was the subject of extensive newspaper, television and magazine 
coverage. The sheriff who captured the kidnapers wrote a book, and the incident 
spawned a 1987 NBC television movie, "The Abduction of Kari Swenson" featuring 
Tracy Pollan as Swenson. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Kari Swenson is a 27-year-old veterinary student. Still fearing harm 
from strangers, the graceful auburn-haired athlete doesn't want people to know 
where she is living, and she has never talked to reporters specifically about 
the kidnaping. Even when she agreed to be interviewed earlier this year at her 
family's home in Bozeman, Mont., Swenson said as little as possible and let her 
mother do the talking. 
</P>
<P>
Swenson for the first time has broken her silence in print form in a book 
released this month. "Victims: The Kari Swenson Story" (Pruett Publishing Co.) 
was written by her mother, Janet Swenson. The book was written because Kari 
Swenson and her family are haunted by more than the memory of her ordeal. They 
feel that Kari was the victim not only of a crime, but of a bizarre myth-making 
process that turned the criminals into folk heroes. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on the media handling of her case, Kari Swenson said urban reporters 
-- "people who don't understand the mountains" -- managed to transform her 
ordeal into a ribald frontier adventure. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Walters said during a "20/20" segment aired after the Nicholses were 
convicted that the kidnapers' nonconformist philosophy sounded "almost 
romantic." 
</P>
<P>
Esquire magazine glossed over the tragedy in this synopsis of their piece on 
the crime: "When some rowdy mountain men tried to snag a wife, a stubborn 
sheriff had to set 'em straight on the law." 
</P>
<P>
Around campfires and in Montana mountain taverns, Swenson's ordeal was further 
transmuted into a modern-day Western legend, in which the Nicholses' ability to 
survive in the wilderness and make their own rules became a quality to be 
admired. 
</P>
<P>
At the kidnapers' trials in Virginia City, Mont., tourists solicited autographs 
from the "Nichols boys" as they were called. An entrepreneur tried to hawk 
"mountain man" T-shirts printed with an image of the accused criminals; and a 
bar advertised a Don Nichols look-alike contest. A prosecuting attorney put a 
stop to both schemes. 
</P>
<P>
Even after the pair were convicted, the media continued to give them a forum 
for their survivalist beliefs. (Don Nichols was convicted of deliberate 
homicide, kidnaping and assault, Dan of kidnaping and assault. Both are serving 
time in a Montana prison.) "Every time they snapped their fingers, the 
reporters ran to them," Janet Swenson said. The Nicholses were interviewed in 
prison for "20/20" (Kari Swenson declined to appear), and the Bozeman Daily 
Chronicle did a jailhouse interview as well as publishing letters to the editor 
that Don Nichols wrote from prison. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kari Swenson couldn't help feeling that her own suffering was 
trivialized by the media, when, for instance, an article caricatured her as "a 
proper Belle of Bozeman, the perfect flower of the New West." 
</P>
<P>
She also recalls angrily the incident in which a writer for a magazine asked 
her to pose for photographs in a rustic cabin the magazine had rented for the 
purpose. She was to sit in front of a roaring fire wearing a red-and-black wool 
plaid shirt the art director had selected to complete the woodsy scene. Swenson 
refused. 
</P>
<P>
According to trial testimony, five years before he kidnaped Kari Swenson, Don 
Nichols bought a chain with the intent of securing a suitable woman when he 
found one. He had a dream of starting his own "tribe" in the mountains and knew 
a woman probably wouldn't go along with the idea willingly -- at first, he 
thought. 
</P>
<P>
According to his testimony, on the day of the kidnaping Dan Nichols was 
wrapping fish line around a stick beside Ulreys Lake when he spotted Kari 
Swenson jogging down the trail. She was wearing running shoes, red shorts and a 
blue T-shirt with the sleeves and collar cut out. Dan testified that he was 
pleased with his find when Swenson came closer and he saw that she was the sort 
of good-looking woman he had hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
Then 22, and a recent graduate of Montana State University in Bozeman, Swenson 
had just set out on a six-mile training run when the Nichols father and son 
blocked her path. She was still basking in the recent thrill of winning the 
first medal ever for the United States in world biathlon competition in 
Chamonix, France. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kidnaped at Gunpoint 
</P>
<P>
The men grabbed her by the wrists. When Swenson struggled, the elder Nichols 
hit her on the left side of the face. She was led away through the woods, 
tethered by a rope to Dan Nichols, with Don Nichols walking behind her, his 
rifle aimed at her back. 
</P>
<P>
The athlete's parents and friends organized a search that night when Kari 
failed to report for dinner duty at the Lone Mountain Ranch in Big Sky where 
she worked. By dawn, about 40 local people had assembled with their horses and 
motorbikes to help search. 
</P>
<P>
About 8 that morning, 18 hours after Swenson was kidnaped, one of the 
searchers, Alan Goldstein, found the Nicholses in their camp. Kari was chained 
to a fallen lodgepole pine nearby. In an incident he later would testify was 
accidental, Dan Nichols shot Kari Swenson in the chest. Then Don Nichols shot 
and killed Allan Goldstein. 
</P>
<P>
A second searcher, Jim Schwalbe, entered the camp after Goldstein, witnessed 
the shootings and ran for help. When Kari saw that the Nicholses were going to 
flee the scene, the wounded athlete begged them to leave her a sleeping bag so 
she could stay warm (it was a cold morning), but they dumped her out of the bag 
onto the ground. 
</P>
<P>
For almost four hours, until Schwalbe returned with help, Swenson was left 
alone with ants and flies invading her bleeding wounds. "I thought I was 
probably going to die at any time," she later told the Madison County District 
Court jury. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Near Death 
</P>
<P>
Swenson survived the wait only to come near death again as she was being 
airlifted out of the campground and her stretcher -- dangling beneath a 
helicopter -- collided with a tree. 
</P>
<P>
Once Swenson was hospitalized in Bozeman, the media seemed to quickly lose 
interest in her and shifted their focus to the Nicholses. It was here that the 
mythologizing process took over and the campfire tale was born. 
</P>
<P>
The Nicholses fascinated the press and the public, according to historian 
William Lang, because they fit neatly into a pre-existing archetype in the mold 
of legendary mountain men such as Yellowstone Kelley and Liver Eating Johnson, 
also known as Jeremiah Johnson. Lang is the former executive editor of Montana: 
The Magazine of Western History. 
</P>
<P>
As a Sports Illustrated article said in a story on the abduction: "Some people 
were delighted at the ease with which the fugitives eluded capture and regarded 
'old Don and Dan' as harmless throwbacks to an earlier, less trammeled era in 
the West." 
</P>
<P>
In a similar vein, a newspaper headline called the elder Nichols a "Nice Man 
Born 100 Years Too Late." 
</P>
<P>
So, while the Nicholses grew larger than life, Kari Swenson was "overwhelmed 
and obliterated" by the myth-making process, Lang said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rescuer Was a Hero 
</P>
<P>
Janet Swenson says she thinks that Alan Goldstein, the man who died trying to 
rescue Kari, also was unfairly depicted -- as a bumbling "James Bond city 
slicker" who had no business being in the mountains in the first place. 
(Goldstein, 34, had owned a men's clothing store in Michigan and had moved to 
Montana only the year before his death after discovering the majestic region 
during a cross-country ski vacation.) 
</P>
<P>
The new book is dedicated to Alan Goldstein and restores him to his proper role 
as a hero. 
</P>
<P>
It also recasts Kari Swenson as a survivor who was at least as resourceful as 
her captors. 
</P>
<P>
"Victims" shows Swenson studying the terrain as she was dragged through the 
woods so she could find her way out if there was a chance to escape. She risked 
her captors' rage by dropping items such as her wristwatch to leave a trail for 
search parties. And she deliberately pressed the imprint of her running shoes 
in the soft dirt of gopher mounds and ant hills. 
</P>
<P>
Even when shot, Swenson didn't behave like a victim. "I lay still and 
experimented with different types of breathing, trying to find the pattern that 
caused the least gurgling and sucking (in her collapsed lung)," she said in the 
book. Drawing on her athletic conditioning, she said, "I closed my eyes and 
concentrated on slowing my pulse." 
</P>
<P>
Kari Swenson was a solitary woman even before she was kidnaped, happy to spend 
days alone with her horse, or running trails and wading creeks in training for 
the biathlon. The kidnaping and the media frenzy that followed have made her 
even more guarded. 
</P>
<P>
Her written statement, which is included in the press materials for the book, 
expresses her ongoing reluctance to talk about the case: "I am a private person 
and I was not certain I wanted to relive the tragedy that affected so many 
people in my life. However, I decided having the facts published was important 
to all of us." 
</P>
<P>
Among the facts the Swensons want set straight is that Kari Swenson did not 
proceed easily and miraculously from the emergency room to the biathlon 
circuit, as did her character in the television movie. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Swenson, a nurse at Montana State University's student health services, 
writes of Kari's agonizing real-life recovery from a critical gunshot wound, 
detailing procedures such as painful respiratory exercises she performed to 
expand her collapsed lung. 
</P>
<P>
Getting over the incident has been difficult not only for Kari, but for the 
rest of the family, including her father, Bob Swenson, chairman of the physics 
department at Montana State University, and the couple's two other children, 
Paul and Johanna. 
</P>
<P>
Kari Swenson did compete again after the kidnaping, traveling to Norway as a 
member of the U.S. Women's Biathlon team. But, partly due to residual pain from 
the shooting, she retired from women's biathlon in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Painful Reminders 
</P>
<P>
Today, Swenson still skis in local races and coaches young skiers. She 
continues to require biofeedback and physical therapy to help control pain 
caused by nerve damage to her back and chest. 
</P>
<P>
Another physical reminder of the kidnaping is the slender metal band Swenson 
wears around her front teeth to correct a jaw problem caused when Don Nichols 
hit her.

While Swenson has said she would like to work with other victims of violent 
crimes someday, she's not ready yet. 
</P>
<P>
She still sees a psychologist periodically to help her deal with fear. She 
often slips into the third person when talking about the abduction, and she 
can't bear to call the Nicholses by name, referring to them as "the old man and 
the young man" instead. 
</P>
<P>
"How I handle it anymore is like it (the kidnaping) didn't happen to me," she 
said. "It happened to somebody else."

JANE FONDA'S SPA OFFERS RIGOROUS REGIMEN FOR THE RICH, BUT ITS TWIST IS IT ALSO 
STRETCHES TO HELP THE POOR

SANTA BARBARA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The familiar voice on the answering machine is surprisingly friendly. 
</P>
<P>
"Hello, this is Jane Fonda. Thank you for calling the Laurel Springs Retreat. 
I'm sorry that no one is available to speak with you at the moment, but I'm 
very pleased you called." 
</P>
<P>
Then why is it that, while making the drive to Santa Barbara, winding around 
the Santa Ynez Mountains and passing through the rustic gate of her ranch, you 
feel like a trespasser? What if, like Rupert Pupkin in the movie "The King of 
Comedy," you've only imagined this personal invitation onto her property? When 
is someone going to scream, "Go away. Get lost. Scram!"? 
</P>
<P>
But that won't happen. Not if you're one of the three to six people willing to 
pay $2,500 for the weeklong privilege of, if not actually rubbing shoulders 
with the 51-year-old Goddess of Good Health, then eating her recipes, hiking 
her trails and following her fitness-for-life philosophy as a guest at what 
could be the most exclusive spa in the world -- her 160-acre home here. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, these days stars seem eager for entrepreneurship, owning as they do 
everything from restaurants (Tom Selleck) and clubs (Billy Idol) to even 
hairdressing salons (Mickey Rourke). And the undisputed queen of them all is 
Fonda, who with her best-selling workout videos, books and Beverly Hills 
studio, has made a bundle from her businesses. 
</P>
<P>
But nearly all celebrities would draw the line at any venture that interfered 
with their personal privacy. Why didn't Fonda? 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't do the retreat because I wanted to get rich off it," she states 
firmly. "I knew that if people could receive information about exercise and 
nutrition in the personal way that I have, then their commitment to their 
health would be changed forever. And by taking people out of their environment 
and putting them in a very intense and private situation, which is also 
extremely peaceful and individualized, the experience is even more profound. 
</P>
<P>
"So I thought, 'I have this house. I have this ranch. Why don't I try to make 
it available to other people?' " 
</P>
<P>
And why not also fund some social causes and get a tax write-off in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
According to Fonda, she and her estranged husband, Assemblyman Tom Hayden 
(D-Santa Monica), purchased the ranch in 1977 to start Camp Laurel Springs, 
their nonprofit summer facility for youngsters of different racial, ethnic and 
socioeconomic backgrounds that includes a program for inner city kids from the 
Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
But the camp has become "increasingly difficult to fund" in recent years, 
maintains Fonda, who came up with the idea of underwriting it with a nonprofit 
enterprise in the form of a super-deluxe spa. It opened in November in the 
remote and remodeled redwood lodge known as the Hill House, which Fonda used to 
rent to singer Joe Cocker. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, the spa is expensive for most people," concedes Fonda. "But the money 
goes for things they can also feel proud of." 
</P>
<P>
According to Fonda's projections, "depending how fast we can take off," within 
two years the spa's net proceeds, which go into the Temescal Foundation, will 
be enough not just to support the camp but also research in health, child 
development and education. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Punishment or Reward? 
</P>
<P>
At first, the idea of spending the day at Fonda's Laurel Springs Retreat sounds 
more like a punishment than a reward. No doubt, the superathlete, whose "feel 
the burn" philosophy has toned up and tuckered out men and women of all sizes 
and ages, would be expected to organize a regimen more fitting to a medieval 
torture chamber than a Xanadu of rest and relaxation. 
</P>
<P>
And when reveille -- in the form of a gentle wake-up call -- comes at 6:15 
a.m., your worst fears are confirmed. The very idea of calling it a retreat 
seems like a cruel joke. 
</P>
<P>
But the punch line is still to come -- a voice explaining sweetly but 
insistently that the 3 1/2-mile hike will start in a matter of minutes and 
you'd better get downstairs pronto. 
</P>
<P>
At any other resort, turning off the phone, jumping back into bed and catching 
a few more hours of sleep would hardly raise an eyebrow. And even if you did 
get up and go out, you could look forward after the hike to all those lovely 
beauty treatments like mud baths, manicures and makeup lessons that other spas 
offer. Not this one. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State-of-Art Gym 
</P>
<P>
Instead, your reward consists of being led to a state-of-the-art gym, hooked up 
to a six-lead EKG machine and put on a treadmill by Dr. Daniel Kosich, the 
program director for Fonda's Workout empire. He conducts a rigorous evaluation 
to assess your cardiovascular fitness, body fat composition, flexibility and 
muscle balance. 
</P>
<P>
And it's not even 10 a.m. yet! 
</P>
<P>
"The point of the treadmill is you're going to learn how it feels to exercise 
at your optimum level," Kosich tells his guinea pig, Los Angeles screenwriter 
Susan Lindau. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so wonderful -- when it stops hurting," she laughs after she finishes her 
Herculean effort and removes the electrodes. "But he said my fitness level was 
above average, and I've never been above average on anything in my life." 
</P>
<P>
With that, she went on yet another hike. 
</P>
<P>
In all honesty, life could be worse than to be coddled for a week in this 
Navajo and Nautilus Nirvana furnished cozily by Fonda with Los Angeles 
decorator Barbara Pohlman (they met through singer Linda Ronstadt) -- sleeping 
on linens from the Ralph Lauren Home Collection, dining on Franciscan Desert 
Rose china, feeding on low-fat high-energy gourmet fare, exercising amid 
Rauschenberg lithographs and getting massaged before a panoramic view of the 
Pacific Ocean and Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
It's almost enough to forget all the hiking, biking, twisting and turning that 
your personal trainer puts you through every day. But sharing the misery 
creates an atmosphere of instant intimacy, resulting in nighttime gab sessions 
in front of the 17-foot-high stone fireplace, or in the frothy hot tub under 
the stars. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sharing Secrets 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, complete strangers are telling each other the gory details of a 
failed marriage, or showing off the cottage-cheese-like cellulite on their 
thighs, or gossiping about the latest promotions and demotions in The Industry. 
</P>
<P>
Because of Fonda's other career as an actress, the spa gets its fair share of 
show business managers, agents, studio executives and, of course, celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Rollins, Sharon Gless, Melanie Griffith and Ally Sheedy have visited. 
But there also have been civilians like the three housewives from Dayton, Ohio, 
who stumbled onto a brief blurb about the spa in USA Today and immediately sent 
in their deposits. 
</P>
<P>
No matter who's who and who's not, they all seem to get infected with farm 
fever after just a few days at the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, like in one of those old episodes of "Green Acres," everyone is on a 
first-name basis with pigs Rosy and Rita, goose Newton, Rosemary the lamb and 
Rene the cow. (One guest even became so attached to the resident dog that she 
followed him down a steep path during a morning hike and ended up breaking her 
arm.) 
</P>
<P>
While California, and especially Southern California, has a disproportionately 
greater number of spas than the rest of the country, due to both the gentleness 
of its weather and the body-consciousness of its residents, Fonda's spa has 
generated more than average curiosity. For instance, the June issue of House 
and Garden magazine featured a cover article on the retreat, complete with 
achingly beautiful pictures of its inside and out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Next Door to Fonda House 
</P>
<P>
The reason, no doubt, is that the spa just happens to be right next door to 
Fonda's own modest farmhouse. 
</P>
<P>
And while she's only an infrequent visitor to the ranch, given her movie 
schedule and other activities, Fonda is a presence nevertheless -- from the 
pictures of her in the spa's brochures and recipe collection, to the Adirondack 
furniture and folksy objets d'art that she personally picked out for the lodge 
quarters, to the Jane Fonda Workout T-shirts, towels and water bottles on sale 
in the workout center. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the unspoken but clear message of the retreat is: Live like Fonda, 
eat like Fonda, work out like Fonda, and maybe, just maybe, you'll end up 
looking like Fonda. 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, right. 
</P>
<P>
But guests have other reasons in mind for coming. When Lindau, a regular at 
Fonda's Beverly Hills studio, first heard about the spa, "I decided to do it 
there and then," she recalls. "And once I set aside the shock of spending the 
money, I decided that the place was perfect. Because it would get me not just 
physically fit, but also psychically fit. And that's what I'm really focusing 
on. My objective here is to do inner and outer work." 
</P>
<P>
Fonda maintains that her retreat fills a vacuum within the industry -- 
somewhere between the "boot camp approach" and the "pampering places with 
herbal wraps and manicures." What it's not, she emphasizes, is a "reducing 
factory where you can lose 10 pounds in one week." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Health in the Long Term 
</P>
<P>
Instead, her spa's schedule is designed to teach guests how to make the 
"long-term investment in their health" through activities that she herself 
likes to do -- hiking, biking, aerobics and weight training in a program of 
cross-training that "helps relieve boredom" -- as well as a series of 
nutritional classes, biochemistry lectures and cooking lessons. 
</P>
<P>
"The spa is probably a good reflection of Jane's philosophy that fitness is 
achieved over the course of a long period of time and that you should try to be 
a healthier person as you get older," says Kosich, an expert in exercise 
physiology and nutrition who was hired two years ago, soon after Fonda came 
under fire from the medical profession for pushing high-impact aerobics on the 
population. 
</P>
<P>
But what comes as something of a surprise, considering Fonda's reputation for 
fanaticism when it comes to exercise, is that she puts a premium on down time 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
That's why the "Blue" bedroom has a window seat for reading, the "Green" 
bedroom a bathtub with a 180-degree view of the mountains and the "Red" bedroom 
a private sun deck, or why guests can zone out in front of the video 
entertainment center or lose themselves in the library books about fantasy and 
fairy tales. Or why extra care is given to such small niceties as garden roses 
in the bud vase by each bed or home-grown pansies on the plates at meals. 
</P>
<P>
Or why the peacefulness of the place is as soothing as it is eerie. The 
quietude at night is so complete that you can actually hear the moths 
fluttering against the window screens. 
</P>
<P>
"To be able to relax is really critical," explains Kosich. "So if you have the 
opportunity to come to a place like this where the ambiance and the environment 
helps modify stress, then you have a major advantage in becoming fit." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Energy Equations 
</P>
<P>
That night, over a 1,200-calorie dinner of eggplant soup, stone grain rolls and 
mock Cobb salad (made with fruits and vegetables instead of blue cheese and 
bacon), you listen intently while Kosich launches into an elaborate 90-minute 
discussion of things you never heard of: set-point theories, basal metabolic 
rates and energy balancing equations. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow it all sinks in -- to the point where you can intelligently respond to 
Kosich's quizzing. "What is the number of calories in a gram of fat?" (Nine.) 
"What are the waste products of aerobic exercise?" (Water and CO2.) 
</P>
<P>
But, more important, you vow to hike four miles every day and never eat another 
candy bar for as long as you live. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you think we can go over this again in the morning when I'll be fresher?" 
begs Lindau, who is yawning uncontrollably. "But, then, you're probably going 
to take me on an eight-mile hike in the morning, instead." 
</P>
<P>
"Not that far," Kosich replies, grinning. 
</P>
<P>
"See, what'd I tell you," Lindau whispers conspiratorially. "These guys are 
trying to kill us." 
</P>
<P>
"But," concludes Kosich, "that's what you came here for." 
</P>
<P>
With that, it's lights out. That is, until 6:15 a.m. 
</P>

IT'S A STEAMY NIGHT WHEN ACTOR'S GANG STAGES NOISY BENEFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN

<TEXT>
<P>
A good cause and loud music lured hundreds of people to 2nd Coming on Friday 
night for a sweaty benefit for the Actors' Gang, the 8-year-old Los Angeles 
theater ensemble led by actor Tim Robbins. 
</P>
<P>
A low ebb in the club scene (or a wave of philanthropy?) may explain the 
around-the-block lines and valet parking that was full by 10:30. Once inside, 
the only way to move was like toothpaste through a tube -- but what an 
interesting way to meet people. 
</P>
<P>
Evaporating body fluids were replaced with Coronas, selling briskly at $4 a 
pop. Oxygen was another rare commodity as clubbers greedily hoarded window 
space. 
</P>
<P>
Beefy actor John Cusack acted as Gang spokesman as he faced the "Entertainment 
Tonight" cameras, wearing a bandanna and a big black hat on his head. 
</P>
<P>
Weaving through the throngs were other young Hollywood-ites: Dylan McDermott 
and Julia Roberts, Hart Bochner, Rae Dawn Chong, Rebecca DeMornay, Alex Winter, 
Billy Baldwin; singer-musicians Tom Waits, Flea and members of Trulio 
Disgracias; designer Rachel London and a smattering of agents and studio execs. 
</P>
<P>
Actors' Gang producer Patti McGuire figured the profits from the event the 
old-fashioned way: "There are 1,000 people, and they paid $20, so that's 
$20,000!" 
</P>
<P>
As the club loaded up, getting past the bouncer-doorman became more and more 
difficult. Would-be guests had to resort to using their wits, as with the woman 
who stood behind the ropes and shrieked, "I'm with CAA! I'm with CAA!!"

IS U.S. READY FOR TWO 24-HOUR COMEDY CHANNELS?; 
</P>
<P>
HBO AND MTV ARE GETTING SET TO GIVE US THE GIGGLES AROUND THE CLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what may prove to be the Humorfight at the OK Corral, two cable-TV companies 
here are preparing to launch 24-hour-a-day comedy channels. While both 
conceivably could survive, many industry executives predict that only one of 
them will get the last laugh. 
</P>
<P>
The battle pits two of the cable industry's most successful program suppliers 
against one another. In one corner: Home Box Office and its Comedy Channel, 
which is scheduled to be launched this fall. In the other: MTV Networks and its 
HA TV Comedy Network, which will arrive early next year. 
</P>
<P>
The rivalry extends far beyond the comedy ring. MTV Networks, which operates 
the MTV, VH-1 and Nickelodeon cable networks, is a division of Viacom 
International, which also owns Showtime and the Movie Channel, which have long 
labored in HBO's shadow among pay-TV services. In May, Viacom filed a 
$2.4-billion lawsuit against HBO and parent Time Inc., charging that they had 
engaged in "predatory and exclusionary acts" against their competitors. HBO has 
termed the suit "totally baseless." 
</P>
<P>
Though the formats of the two services will differ, the companies cite 
basically the same reason for developing advertiser-supported comedy channels 
-- that just as there proved to be a market for all-news CNN, all-sports ESPN 
and all-music MTV, there is bound to be one for a form whose popularity is 
easily gauged by network programming, motion pictures and nightclubs. 
</P>
<P>
As Dick Beahrs, president of the Comedy Channel, observes, comedy "is probably 
the last bastion of network programming that has not been fully exploited by 
cable." 
</P>
<P>
The idea of 24-hour-a-day comedy may boggle the mind, he says, "but when I 
first heard of ESPN being 24 hours of sports in 1979, I thought somebody must 
have been smoking something. And I'm a sports junkie." ESPN is the nation's 
largest cable network, serving 56% of the nation's homes. 
</P>
<P>
The certainty that viewers could find comedy on TV, regardless of when they 
switch on the set, is another major selling point, says MTV Networks president 
Tom Freston, who is overseeing the HA TV effort. "It's really that constancy, 
we feel, that's going to give you enough of an audience to make the thing 
ultimately profitable," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Details of what the HA TV Comedy Network and the Comedy Channel will offer are 
still sketchy, although each says no R-rated fare will appear because each, 
unlike pay channels where viewers make a deliberate choice to accept such 
programming by sending in their check each month, is on basic cable and thus 
available to all cable viewers, young and old alike. 
</P>
<P>
The Comedy Channel seems to be taking a leaf from MTV's format. It plans to 
have six to 12 comedy hosts -- or "comedy jocks," as some call them -- 
introducing the material and performing their own jokes too. There'll be clips 
of comedy films, classic TV comedy shows, stand-up comedy performances and 
full-length comedy movies, Beahrs says. 
</P>
<P>
The HA channel, says MTV's Freston, will offer long- and short-form 
programming, sketch comedy, stand-up performances and movies and situation 
comedies either made for HA or bought in syndication. There'll be no comedy 
hosts, per se, but there will be new comic personalities on the network. "We 
see a large role for performance comedy, as we did with rock 'n' roll on MTV," 
Freston said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Freston nor Beahrs would say how much their channels will cost to 
start. But as with other new ventures, they will run in the red for several 
years and possibly longer. 
</P>
<P>
Freston notes that the cost could be defrayed by co-production deals and even 
co-ownership of HA TV by other companies. His company is talking with "several" 
large cable operators about "a possible equity interest" in the new channel, he 
says, declining to identify them. This might also help circumvent the advantage 
that the Comedy Channel will have by getting out of the blocks first. 
</P>
<P>
The key question as to cost, says one cable executive, is how much each company 
will have to pay for what it shows. Original programming is costly, he says, 
and if they start "bidding against the broadcast market" for recent films, 
syndicated shows or reruns of network fare, "you are going to run into some 
very hefty price tags." 
</P>
<P>
An even bigger problem, however, will simply be getting the new services on 
cable systems that have become increasingly crowded with other offerings, among 
them NBC's business-channel CNBC and Ted Turner's TNT movie channel in just the 
past seven months. 
</P>
<P>
While newer cable systems have a capacity for 70 channels or more, the industry 
average is 36 channels. Older systems are being upgraded, but right now, MTV's 
Preston acknowledges, cable "is pretty tight in terms of channel availability. 
. . . I think there's a bottleneck existing in terms of channel capacity that's 
going to exist for the next couple of years." 
</P>
<P>
Given that bottleneck, there is doubt in the industry that cable operators can 
or will want to make room for two all-comedy channels. "My sense is that 
there's room for one (cable channel). . . . I don't see many systems at all 
offering two," says Ted Livingston, senior vice president of Boston-based 
Continental Cablevision, which has 2.4 million subscribers, including 900,000 
in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
Continental already had sales pitches by executives from HA and the Comedy 
Channel. "We've said to both of them that it's a concept that makes sense," 
Livingston says. However, he adds, "we've also said to them that there's a very 
low probability that we'd carry two." 
</P>
<P>
The fact that two channels focus on the same genre doesn't necessarily mean one 
has to fail, says Thomas S. Rogers, president of NBC Cable, whose CNBC is still 
wooing cable operators for channel space. There are multiple channels 
specializing in movies, business, home shopping and sports. But, he adds, "I 
would say the likelihood of both (comedy) channels surviving is not great." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone agrees. There will always be room for a hit channel, says Bob 
Clasen, president of Comcast Cable Communications, which is based near 
Philadelphia and operates or manages systems that serve 2.4 million 
subscribers. His case in point: TNT started only last October, but its mix of 
made-for-TNT movies and acclaimed old films already has put it into 49.3% of 
the nation's TV households, according to the latest A. C. Nielsen figures. 
</P>
<P>
"I was one of the nay-sayers of TNT and I was wrong," Clasen says. "With those 
movies and made-for-cable films, it created a niche for itself almost 
overnight." 
</P>
<P>
But the Comedy Channel and HA will be competing for sponsors as well as cable 
outlets. Richard J. Kostrya, executive vice president of the J. Walter Thompson 
USA advertising agency, says: "It's going to be hard to get advertisers to put 
in major (commercial) schedules to support both networks. It's just too much." 
He notes that in recent years there have been many first-run comedy shows in 
syndication, "and they have just not been able to generate the audience." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, he says, "from an audience standpoint, I don't think two can 
survive. I don't think there's a need for two."

Big city life has lost its allure for some people. And big business is paying 
dearly to change their minds. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is not so much crime, pollution or traffic congestion. Rather, 
people are turned off by a widening gap in the cost of living between the least 
and most expensive U.S. cities. As a result, companies are giving some workers 
big bonuses and tens of thousands of dollars in housing subsidies to persuade 
them to move to such expensive areas as Southern California, the Bay area, 
Boston and New York. 
</P>
<P>
The trend has been downplayed partly because companies fear that discussing 
special pay and housing deals might fuel dissension in the workplace. But the 
growing cost gap is changing the way many companies do business as more 
Americans resist relocating or demand to be well-compensated for moving to 
cities where their housing expenses, income taxes and other expenses might 
triple or quadruple. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cost Put at $15 Billion 
</P>
<P>
"There's not a single homeowner that we move here for less than $100,000," said 
Catherine Morris, relocation manager for Los Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield 
Co. Overall, U.S. employers spend more than $15 billion annually to relocate 
workers, according to the Marriott Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Even hefty financial incentives, however, sometimes fail to sway employees. Mel 
Dinkel, a General Electric plant manager in Tampa, Fla., said he turned down a 
transfer to Orange County -- despite pressure from his employer -- "because of 
the horror stories about housing costs." He is now taking a careful look at a 
new offer to move to Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Relocation has become "a major problem for companies," said Harry Usher, 
managing director of the Los Angeles office of Russell Reynolds Associates, 
which recently completed a study on the issue. Some companies, he said, have 
begun doing more local hiring or are setting up operations in lower-cost 
locales to save money. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Those Most Vulnerable 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps hardest hit, though, are employees -- generally those making less than 
$70,000 annually -- who are offered transfers but, unlike senior managers, are 
given little in the way of financial help. 
</P>
<P>
The growing regional cost gap is driven by skyrocketing prices in areas where 
high-tech and service industries have blossomed, such as Boston, Raleigh, N.C., 
and California. Meanwhile, weak energy and food prices have depressed the local 
economies of, among other places, Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana, keeping prices 
there relatively low. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as 1984, there was just a 29% difference in the overall cost of 
living between the least and most expensive of 10 major U.S. cities. Today, the 
spread is 50%, reports the consulting firm Runzheimer International. In Los 
Angeles -- the survey's third-most expensive city behind Boston and New York -- 
a family of four spends $66,249 for housing, goods and services that cost just 
$49,694 in 10th-ranked Houston. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of living gap is most apparent in housing prices. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1981, for example, the median price of a single-family detached home, or 
townhouse, has risen 222% to $178,500 in Boston this year and jumped 181% to 
$201,000 in Los Angeles, according to the National Assn. of Realtors. During 
the same period, the median home price increased 60% to $73,800 in Kansas City 
and actually declined 14% to $62,900 in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Ever-widening cost of living differences are forcing employers to grapple with 
the additional issue of whether they should devise separate pay scales for 
workers who perform the same jobs but live in different cities. To some extent, 
such a pattern already appears to be emerging. For example, the average weekly 
salary last year of a computer systems analyst was $804.50 in Los Angeles 
versus $740 in Atlanta, reports the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Widening Disparities Seen 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts expect such salary differences to grow as more companies adopt 
regional pay systems. But for now, the federal government appears to be taking 
the lead. In June, the government announced 20% raises for air traffic 
controllers in New York, Chicago, Oakland and Los Angeles because of the high 
cost of living in the four areas. The government also says it may abandon its 
uniform pay system for its 1.4 million white-collar employees in favor of one 
that reflects regional economic patterns. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout most of the postwar era, the manufacturing-dominated U.S. economy 
had kept the wages of most Americans -- even those at different income levels 
-- rising at about the same pace, experts say. Consequently, price differences 
for housing, goods and services were comparatively small from region to region. 
For the most part, high-cost areas were special cases, such as New York, Alaska 
and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, employee transfers did not become an important business issue until 
the mid-1960s, around when a few companies set up the Employment Relocation 
Council to address concerns about buying and selling employees' homes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Burden on Families 
</P>
<P>
Today, U.S. workers are under pressure to move as a result of corporate mergers 
and relocations by nimble-footed service industries, said Dennis J. Donovan, a 
senior vice president at the New York consulting firm Moran, Stahl &amp; Boyer. 
In the face of that pressure, however, the rise in two-earner families and 
regional cost of living differences have consorted to make families 
increasingly unwilling to pack their bags. 
</P>
<P>
"The availability of qualified labor is the paramount issue facing American 
business as it enters the 1990s, in part, because of cost of living differences 
workers face," said Donovan. Suddenly "more companies are offering cost of 
living adjustments, housing subsidies and raising their pay scales." 
</P>
<P>
Atlantic Richfield, for example, pays as much as 25% of a new employee's or 
transferee's monthly mortgage for up to five years. And the company will pay 
the subsidy on mortgages up to $200,000. ARCO also provides interest-free loans 
to finance up to 20% of the down payment on the new home as well as one-time 
bonuses equal to one month of the employee's annual pay. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. of New York pays a monthly stipend based on a 
complicated formula that takes into account family size and salary, according 
to Carol Cerreta, a personnel assistant at Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, a single homeowner, making $100,000 in Morgan's Wilmington, Del., 
offices would receive a lump-sum payment of at least $5,000 as well as $1,718 
in monthly housing subsidies for up to two years if he were transferred to New 
York. The bank also pays, among other things, closing costs on the purchase of 
a new home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Impact on Cost Gap 
</P>
<P>
But many employees complain that the subsidies do not come close to closing the 
cost gap. 
</P>
<P>
A 39-year-old administrator who left a $50,000-a-year hospital post in the 
Southwest to take an $80,000-a-year position at National Medical Enterprises in 
Los Angeles said he suffered a big change in his standard of living, despite 
receiving financial assistance. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was prepared for the price difference," said the administrator, 
who requested to remain anonymous. "But what I envisioned and what I actually 
got was quite a shock." 
</P>
<P>
The administrator, who said he sold his former 3,800 square-foot, four-bedroom 
home for $125,000, had to negotiate an interest-free 90-day loan and a mortgage 
loan interest rate subsidy from his new employer to buy a home in Los Angeles. 
Even so, he said he had to pay $250,000 for the house, which has three 
bedrooms, 2,100 square feet of space and is located farther from his job than 
his previous home. His utility costs are lower in Los Angeles but he said his 
property taxes and car insurance rates have more than doubled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shocked at Prices 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, after Tampa plant manager Dinkel went on a house hunting trip near 
Anaheim, he was shocked by the huge difference in housing prices. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked all over within an hour's drive of Anaheim," said Dinkel, who has 
been asked to become manager of GE's Anaheim facility. "From what I've been 
able to see now, they would have to at least double my salary, along with a 
lump-sum bonus to cover the down payment" for a new house. 
</P>
<P>
Yet while highly paid managers and executives can get such special deals from 
employers, the burden of coping with the cost gap falls harder on lower-paid 
professional and technical workers such as nurses, insurance actuaries and 
engineers, because many companies will not fully compensate them to relocate. 
</P>
<P>
"If they are not at the management level or above, we would not use any of the 
incentives to lure them," said Alan Ewalt, senior vice president of human 
resources at National Medical Enterprises. For such employees, Ewalt said, 
"it's too expensive for us to apply a relocation package" that ordinarily would 
equal an employee's base salary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Older Workers Resisting 
</P>
<P>
Younger workers may swallow the loss and make the move in the interest of their 
careers, experts say, but many older workers are refusing -- forcing companies 
to consider relocating their offices or establishing training programs so they 
can hire locally. 
</P>
<P>
A survey by the Employee Relocation Council this year found that 40% of the 
nation's 600 largest companies had some problems with employees who are 
reluctant to relocate. The high cost of housing was cited as the No. 1 reason. 
</P>
<P>
Even young workers who are willing to move for a job seem increasingly 
interested in heading to less expensive communities. Among MBA graduates at the 
University of Virginia's Colgate Darden business school, for instance, just 15% 
accepted jobs in New York this year, compared to 27% in 1987, said Nevin 
Kessler, Darden's associate director of placement. 
</P>
<P>
"We are seeing a dramatic shift in preference from metro areas students feel 
are too expensive to areas where they feel they can obtain a standard of living 
that meets their need," Kessler said. 
</P>
<P>
A case in point is Ty Eggemeyer, one of the newly minted MBAs from the 
University of Virginia. After graduating, Eggemeyer turned down a Boston job 
paying more than $55,000 and accepted a lower paying position at the Dallas 
offices of the consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Boston Firm No Match 
</P>
<P>
The Boston firm, he explained, "would have had to pay me 50% more for me to 
have a standard of living comparable to what I'll have in Dallas." 
</P>
<P>
When companies use financial incentives to lure workers, the extra compensation 
for new employees often angers other longtime company workers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a terrible negative" in terms of worker morale, said Wayne L. Wright, a 
former vice president of human resource for Nissan Motor Manufacturing in 
Tennessee who is now an employee relations consultant at the Center for Values 
Research in Dallas. Among some of his clients, he said, the gap in total 
compensation -- mainly salary and signing bonuses -- between old and newly 
hired relocated workers performing the same job approaches 20% or more. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all companies try to disguise or limit special compensation by ending 
such benefits after a period of one to five years or by separating special 
housing payments or bonuses from an employee's salary. Still, many workers are 
resentful. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Now Where's My Raise?' 
</P>
<P>
"The work force is made up of conformists," Wright said, "and they don't 
understand this sudden need for signing bonuses for people who have never done 
an hour's work for the company. The natural response is: 'Well, that's fine for 
them, now where's my raise?' " 
</P>
<P>
Special pay for new employees is only "a stopgap measure," said Wright, who 
questions whether any amount of money will be able to adequately compensate 
workers to move to areas such as Los Angeles. "All the (data) I've looked at 
say the problem is going to get a lot worse before it gets better."

PYONGYANG, North Korea 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It started innocently enough. Two journalists, an American and a Japanese, 
walked into an attractive noodle shop, filled with Korean customers, a few 
blocks from an area of grand sports stadiums and new hotels filled with 
visitors to the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant's windows bore posters of the festival, and the ceiling was 
strung with small flags of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. It was 
spotlessly clean and freshly painted. Customers were well dressed. Several wore 
the uniforms of festival guides. Although it seemed to be something of a model 
restaurant, at least it was a place where ordinary residents of Pyongyang could 
eat lunch. 
</P>
<P>
So the Japanese journalist took a picture. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Angry Reaction 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, a Korean man in his mid-30s, dressed in the high-button gray suit 
favored by officials, stood up, his face contorted with rage. The man -- who 
was not in the picture and knew he was not in it -- called out for the photo 
taking to stop. He strode over angrily to the journalists' table. 
</P>
<P>
As he shouted at the foreigners, one of the festival guides came over and 
translated. 
</P>
<P>
"You must give him the film," the translator said. 
</P>
<P>
"Why?" 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many beautiful buildings in Pyongyang, and very good 
restaurants," said the translator. "Why do you take pictures here?" 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very nice restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
"No, it's not," came the reply. "It is a middle-level restaurant. You must give 
him the film." 
</P>
<P>
The journalists refused. After a tense standoff, the angry man disappeared and 
the noodles were served. They proved to be excellent. The foreigners indicated 
this to the staff, who responded with smiles. Even if the official could not 
endure foreigners taking pictures of a noodle shop, the waitresses knew it was 
a nice restaurant with good food. 
</P>
<P>
Under orders of President Kim Il Sung, who has ruled with an iron hand since 
the end of World War II, the people of North Korea have built central Pyongyang 
into a beautiful city of broad, tree-lined streets, with attractively 
landscaped parks, statues and fountains. There are many grand buildings, some 
in Western style and others with traditional Korean roof lines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Asia's Tallest Hotel 
</P>
<P>
Dominating the skyline like a Gothic cathedral in an old European city is the 
105-story, pyramid-shaped steel and concrete shell of the Ryugyong Hotel, on 
which structural work has been completed but interior work remains. The hotel 
is said to be the tallest in Asia -- beating by one story a South Korean-built 
hotel in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
For North Korea, with half the population of South Korea and less than half the 
south's annual per capita income, competing with the capitalist south is of 
great importance. But it is not easy. An attempt to present the best possible 
face to the world is part of the reason for a burst of construction in 
Pyongyang during the past few years. It also is a factor motivating 
heavy-handed attempts to keep visitors from seeing or recording scenes of 
ordinary life. 
</P>
<P>
North Korea is a reasonably well-off developing nation that is desperately 
pretending to be richer and more equal than it is. 
</P>
<P>
It sometimes seems as if the entire society is nursing a deep inferiority 
complex. As much as possible, foreigners are encouraged to see only the 
concrete grandeur and decorative neon glitz of Pyongyang -- the most modern 
factories, the richest cooperative farms or the better housing developments. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible, however, to leave one's guide behind and wander into ordinary 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
One such neighborhood is clustered around the Ragwon Cinema House on the west 
side of the city. Here, families live in apartment blocks that range from two 
to 10 stories high. Families are subdivided into groups of about 800, according 
to one explanation given to a foreign reporter, and are assigned specific 
shops, where they do most of their grocery shopping. Shopkeepers said that some 
foods are rationed. They said that per-person allotments are about eight pounds 
of meat a month, slightly less than half a pound of fish per day and two 
bottles of beer per day. 
</P>
<P>
The fish market near the cinema had three kinds of fish one recent day: salted 
mackerel, salted herring and salted sardines. Dried fish, various kinds of 
edible seaweed, canned sardines and canned squid were also available. A 
vegetable market had cabbage, cucumbers, squash, green peppers, hot peppers, 
onions, tomatoes, watermelon and apples. 
</P>
<P>
At a shop across the street selling consumer goods, well-made umbrellas were 
selling briskly for $11 apiece plus a ration coupon. There are at least three 
methods of rationing. One is by coupon, as with the umbrellas. Another is by 
the memory of the storekeepers, as with bottles of beer, which individuals can 
generally purchase only at their assigned neighborhood store. A third, 
consisting of a record book kept at home, is used for the purchase of household 
furniture. Many small consumer items, however, may be purchased freely if one 
has enough money. Average monthly wages are about 100 won, or $45, according to 
various people interviewed in Pyongyang. Rents are only a few dollars. 
</P>
<P>
People on the streets during the festival have been well dressed, the women 
generally wearing skirts or dresses that extend below the knee, with some women 
in the traditional Korean gown called chima chogori. Most men wear Western 
clothes, with a significant minority in high-button suits, similar to what in 
China is called a Mao jacket. People appear well fed and energetic, but 
conversation in public places tends to be reserved. 
</P>
<P>
Within Pyongyang, there still exist earthen lanes, lined with multifamily, 
one-story white cottages with tiled roofs and blue-trimmed windows, separated 
by tiny private patches of corn and other vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
Few foreigners ever enter these areas, however, and when they do, officials or 
security guards usually appear quickly to check identities and ensure that no 
conversation gets out of hand. Try to take a picture, and people usually turn 
and hurry out of sight. People act as if they are ashamed of traditional 
practices, such as women carrying loads on their heads or babies on their 
backs. 
</P>
<P>
North Korea remains an intensely secretive society for many reasons. One is 
that the country's political stability depends to a large degree on vast 
distortions of the history of President Kim's life and the general history of 
the past 45 years. Dissent remains so dangerous it is invisible. All citizens 
must constantly proclaim respect for Kim, 77, and affection for his son and 
designated successor, the "Dear Comrade" Kim Jong Il. Everyone wears a pin with 
a small picture of Kim Il Sung wherever they go. 
</P>
<P>
President Kim is portrayed as a brilliant revolutionary leader, who led the 
country to freedom from Japanese colonialism. Japan's defeat in 1945 and the 
establishment of a Communist state in North Korea is attributed to his 
leadership. The role of the United States in defeating Japan in World War II is 
never mentioned. Scarcely more credit is given to the Soviet Union, which 
accepted the surrender of Japanese troops in the northern half of the Korean 
Peninsula and set Kim up as the leader of a Communist government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Followed Stalinist Model 
</P>
<P>
Under the rule of Kim and the Workers' Party of Korea -- the official name of 
the Communist Party that Kim set up in October, 1945 -- the country has 
followed the Stalinist model of economic development. The economy functions 
under state ownership and central control. Resources are squeezed from the 
countryside to support the development of heavy industry and other specified 
projects, such as the construction of Pyongyang and the maintenance of a large 
army. A personality cult bordering on worship of Kim, plus police-state 
controls, combine to ensure the obedience of the population. 
</P>
<P>
The system achieves some results, and it has its supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"After liberation, the respected and beloved leader appealed to all the Korean 
people to gather everything together to build a new Korea on this land," said 
Kang Yong Hwa, 68, a longtime Workers' Party member who is a designer and 
technical expert at a clothing factory. "Everyone who has strength must give 
their strength. If you have money, you must give your money to the country. If 
you have technical skills, you must give your skills. If you have bare hands, 
you must give your bare hands." 
</P>
<P>
The egalitarianism, however, does not encompass the ruling elite. Located near 
the center of the city, southwest of the Grand Peoples' Study House, as the 
national library is known, a stretch of roughly one mile of Chang Gwang Street 
is fenced off to pedestrian traffic, with a pair of soldiers carrying 
semiautomatic rifles warning away any who approach too closely. Drivers know 
they must not enter this street, which is lined with apartment blocks and 
offices used by North Korea's rulers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scores of Mercedes 
</P>
<P>
Little detail is available about life in this area. But the preferred vehicle 
of many of these families is the Mercedes-Benz. Scores of the German luxury 
cars could be seen carrying their passengers to major festival events. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors also are generally limited to only fleeting glimpses of the North 
Korean countryside, primarily the view from a limited number of rail routes and 
highways. The train from Pyongyang to Panmunjom, on the border with South 
Korea, and a four-lane highway, stretching from the capital to the east coast 
resort town of Wonsan, both pass by rich farmland and villages of tile-roofed 
houses, with dirt roads, bullock carts and occasional tractors. The general 
level of prosperity seems similar to that of China. Foreigners who have been to 
the country's more remote villages in mountainous regions say that life remains 
very simple and poor. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-day Festival of Youth and Students, which ended Saturday, has been 
Pyongyang's greatest effort yet to show off its accomplishments. About 20,000 
delegates and tourists from various countries attended the festival, which 
featured sports competitions, various types of cultural performances and 
leftist political gatherings with titles such as "Anti-Imperialist Tribunal." 
</P>
<P>
Among the most important visitors have been about 3,000 Korean residents of 
Japan, most of them born in Japan but maintaining North Korean citizenship. 
They are part of Japan's large Korean community, which has never been fully 
integrated into Japanese life, due to discrimination, historical antipathy 
between the two nations and a variety of political problems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Key Overseas Link 
</P>
<P>
One goal of Pyongyang's elaborate efforts to put only its best face forward to 
the world is to solidify support from this group, which forms North Korea's 
most important overseas link. In this, it is largely successful. Most Koreans 
from Japan are inclined to see primarily the good side of life in Pyongyang, 
and to feel great pride in their fatherland's accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so overwhelmed; I wanted to cry," Kim Hwa Ja, a Japanese-born North Korean 
national who lives in a suburb of Tokyo, said after viewing a "Mass Games" 
childrens' performance of precision gymnastics and bleacher card-section art at 
Kim Il Sung Stadium. "Everything is done so perfectly. . . . The childrens' 
actions show they are protected by Kim Il Sung. It cannot be forced action. 
This is their real feeling, and it reflects Kim Il Sung's feeling toward them." 
</P>
<P>
Those Korean visitors from Japan who are aware of the intense attempt to hide 
reality do not necessarily find this very objectionable. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to have the image of a new socialist society," explained one such 
visitor. "But many things don't fit this idealized image. So they are 
embarrassed to let foreigners see. They do this out of patriotism." 
</P>
<P>
The Koreans from Japan are also part of the show. As their contribution to the 
success of the festival, they ran hundreds of nighttime food stalls along 
Kwangbok Street, in the Sports Village section where lodging was provided for 
most of the festival visitors. The food was delicious and the service 
excellent. Very few delegates ever realized that the stalls were not run by 
local Koreans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Welcome Diversion 
</P>
<P>
For Pyongyang's tiny foreign community, consisting primarily of diplomats and a 
scattering of capitalist businessmen, the festival has been a welcome 
diversion. 
</P>
<P>
About 90 countries have diplomatic representation in Pyongyang, although for 
many, this is accomplished through officials primarily stationed at embassies 
in Beijing. Among those with representation here are Norway, Denmark, Sweden, 
Finland, Austria, Iceland, Switzerland, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Egypt, 
Syria, Algeria, Nigeria, Nicaragua and Cuba. Pyongyang passed a joint venture 
law in 1984, and while not too much has yet come of it, there are about two 
dozen businessmen living in Pyongyang from West Germany, France, Belgium and 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
All these foreigners are severely isolated from Korean society, and social life 
is primarily within their own circles. For those interested in night life, the 
high point is disco dancing every Saturday night at the Changgwang San Hotel. 
Others prefer the pool and sauna at the Changgwang Health Complex, which is 
closed to foreigners six days a week and holds a foreigners-only day on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
While resident foreigners and visiting journalists find themselves confronting 
the severe restrictions of North Korean society, most festival visitors appear 
to have had a grand time. The physical appearance of Pyongyang alone is enough 
to win some respect from most visitors. 
</P>
<P>
"I am amazed by the economic and industrial growth they have achieved," said a 
South Korean immigrant to the United States who was part of a delegation of 
visiting Korean Americans. "At the same time, I'm a little discontented that 
the tour guides are only taking us to what they want us to see."

President Bush, preparing a package of economic assistance "for the sake of a 
stable and prosperous Poland," is expected to propose the creation of a 
$100-million fund to invigorate the struggling Polish economy's private sector, 
White House officials said Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
The President, who arrived in Warsaw on Sunday evening, greeted a Poland in the 
midst of political upheaval and struggling to achieve economic reform, and 
pressed ahead with his call for a Europe that is "whole and free." 
</P>
<P>
With U.S. support for budding economic and political reform as his central 
theme, the President is expected in a speech today to the Polish Parliament to 
unveil a number of steps, including the $100-million fund, to demonstrate 
Western support for the new signs of openness in Polish life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Congressional OK Required 
</P>
<P>
White House officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the 
$100-million fund would need congressional approval. They said Bush would 
encourage other major industrialized democracies, meeting next weekend in 
Paris, to offer similar contributions. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the President is expected to: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Encourage the World Bank to move ahead with loans already under 
consideration and believed to be worth $325 million. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ask other major lenders to consider rescheduling a portion of Poland's 
crushing $39-billion foreign debt -- 65% of which is owed to Western lenders. 
Under his proposal, about $5 billion in debt payments would be deferred, for an 
unspecified period. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Propose a joint U.S.-Polish effort, worth $15 million, to attack air and 
water pollution in the Krakow area and establish a cultural and information 
center. 
</P>
<P>
The President also planned to pledge that he would seek "concerted action" by 
the West to assist Poland and Hungary, the second stop on his four-nation 
European tour. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Details Upcoming 
</P>
<P>
White House officials said that although the broad outline of the proposal was 
prepared in time for today's speech, specific details are yet to be drawn up 
for broad international action, and that it is uncertain whether the 
$100-million fund that Bush plans to unveil will be in the form of loans or 
grants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Greeted by Jaruzelski 
</P>
<P>
As Bush stepped from Air Force One at Warsaw's Okecie Airport on a warm, humid 
evening, he was greeted by Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the Communist Party 
leader. Also in the welcoming party was Andrzej Wielowieyski, deputy Speaker of 
Poland's new freely elected Senate and an adviser to Solidarity leader Lech 
Walesa. It was the first time a Solidarity representative has been included at 
an official Polish state welcome. 
</P>
<P>
Upbeat as he embarked on his second trip as President to the changing Communist 
world, Bush referred to the political reforms that have shaken Poland in the 
past three months, declaring at the welcoming ceremony: 
</P>
<P>
"These are great days for Poland. Solidarity is again legal. The beginnings of 
a free press now exist. A new Parliament is in place. The Polish Senate has 
been restored through free and fair elections. 
</P>
<P>
"Poland is making its own history," he said. "And America, and the whole world, 
is watching." 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski, whose once-sure shot at the Polish presidency is now up in the air 
as a result of the political turmoil, told Bush: "You are arriving in a country 
in which a process of basic change is at work. You are going to see a Poland 
that is following with determination profound socio-political and economic 
reforms." 
</P>
<P>
Describing democratization and reconciliation as an "indispensable promise," 
Jaruzelski said that "our Polish transformations are aided by positive trends 
of detente in the international arena." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Call for 'Working Together' 
</P>
<P>
And, he said, Poland subscribed to the idea that "the philosophy of enmity 
should be replaced by that of rapprochement and working together." 
</P>
<P>
For Bush, who was accompanied by First Lady Barbara Bush, the two-day visit to 
Poland offers a sharp contrast to his previous journey here, in September, 
1987. At that time, Solidarity was outlawed, and the then-vice president of the 
United States irked his Polish government hosts with public displays of support 
for the opposition movement. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the sudden shifts in the political climate here -- parliamentary 
elections produced an overwhelming victory for Solidarity, which took 98 of the 
100 seats in the newly constituted Senate -- the President is still treading a 
narrow line. His goal is to avoid pressing the Communist leadership too hard 
and avoid unleashing pent-up enmity for the government and producing a backlash 
that would undo recent progress. 
</P>
<P>
"It's got to be handled in a subtle fashion -- the fine line you walk -- so 
that the things you do and say are helpful to the process of greater freedom," 
a senior White House official said. 
</P>
<P>
Some senior government analysts have expressed at least limited concern that 
Bush's visit could produce the same sort of incendiary impact that Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's journey to Beijing contributed to the 
now-crushed pro-democracy movement in China. But one White House official said 
Bush "knows what are the effective, prudent things to do." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'You Want to Inspire' 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want to incite; you want to inspire. That's the goal. And you want 
to congratulate a government when it is making positive steps, and show that 
positive steps will be complemented by positive steps on our part," said 
another senior Bush aide. 
</P>
<P>
Bush will meet with Jaruzelski today and with Walesa on Tuesday in the Baltic 
port city of Gdansk. He address to Parliament is scheduled this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after two days in Poland and a visit to Hungary, he will attend the 15th 
annual economic summit conference in Paris of the world's leading 
industrialized democracies, which is expected to work toward an overall 
approach by the West to help boost the Polish economy. 
</P>
<P>
Linking political and economic reforms, Bush referred to the West's demands 
that any economic assistance must be met by reforms in the Polish economy that 
could risk an increase in unemployment if the inflation rate of nearly 100% is 
to be curbed. 
</P>
<P>
He said: 
</P>
<P>
"Poland has started along an ascending path of democratic change. This climb is 
exhilarating, but not always easy, and will require further sacrifices. But, if 
followed, it will lead to a renaissance for this remarkable nation." 
</P>
<P>
White House officials maintained that the size of assistance package Bush will 
offer is less important than the fact that such a package is being offered, as 
a reaction to the reforms taking place here. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, said one, referring to the large Polish-American community in the 
United States, "I doubt the Poles in Chicago have an eye for what the aid 
package will be, but they do have an eye for the fact that the President of the 
United States" would visit Poland. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Care 'Not To Over Promise' 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Bush told reporters aboard Air Force One that he wanted to be careful 
not "to overpromise, do too little or do too much." 
</P>
<P>
Suggesting that the real import of the trip was simply in his presence, he 
said: "Remember Woody Allen -- 90% of life is just showing up." 
</P>
<P>
Much as he did during his first overseas trip as President, when he visited 
China in February, Bush is focusing on the political and economic reforms 
occurring in the Communist world -- in this case, in Poland and Hungary. He is 
also calling for an end to the ideological, political, and economic barriers 
that have divided the European Continent for four decades. 
</P>
<P>
"Here in the heart of Europe, the American people have a fervent wish: that 
Europe be whole and free," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with four Hungarian reporters before he left the United States, 
Bush, however, reflected the sensitivity of appearing too demanding. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not a President's Role 
</P>
<P>
"It is not an American President's role to say to those in another county, 'you 
have to have your system this way, matching our system, or else we can't do 
business with you.' That is not my role," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be inappropriate for the President of the United States," he said, 
"to try to fine-tune for the people of Hungary how they ought to eat -- how the 
cow ought to eat the cabbage, as we say in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's visit to Hungary will be the first by an American president. His visit 
to Poland is the third, following one by Richard M. Nixon in 1972 and another 
by Jimmy Carter in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
It was on Carter's arrival that a State Department interpreter, in a mistaken 
translation, said in Polish as he worked through Carter's speech: "I have come 
not only to express our own views to the people of Poland but also to learn 
your opinion and the understanding of your lusts."

Searing heat across most of the nation was punctuated by thunderstorms along 
the Gulf Coast, from Lake Michigan to the central Appalachians and over part of 
the Rockies, where temperatures hit record highs along the eastern edge. High 
winds downed trees and power lines west of Philadelphia, Miss., and damaged 
several farm buildings. South Bend, Ind., got 3.65 inches of rain, enough to 
cause street flooding. Houston got a half-inch of rain in 20 minutes. Readings 
were above 100 degrees over southeastern South Dakota, southwestern Nebraska 
and the desert Southwest. Denver posted a record high of 98 and Cheyenne, Wyo., 
had a record high of 96.

A Vietnamese immigrant who offered $5,000 in a Thai newspaper for the return of 
his teen-age daughter abducted by pirates five years ago said he "has a good 
feeling" his child is still alive. Tang Bao Can, 44, and his wife, Thai Thi 
Loan, 45, of Santa Ana, placed an ad in the Bangkok Post offering the reward 
for information leading to the return of their daughter, Tang Bich Hang, 18. 
Can, manager of an auto parts store, said his daughter was taken from his arms 
in the Gulf of Thailand by suspected Thai pirates, who boarded the refugee boat 
in which Can's family and about 100 others were adrift. Can said he believes 
his daughter may have survived because the kidnapers seemed "more human" than 
other pirates who had tried to waylay the boat previously.

The explosion last month of a major pipeline along the Trans-Siberian Railroad 
in the Ural Mountains decreased the Soviet Union's gas supply by 20%, forcing 
cuts in gas exports and supplies to domestic factories and consumers, a 
government official said. Gas Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin also said Soviet 
consumers should conserve gas used in kitchen stoves and brace for shortages of 
rubber and plastic goods made from the petroleum products the pipeline carried. 
A 1,153-mile pipeline carrying a mixture of benzine, propane and butane from 
western Siberia burst June 4 as two passenger trains were passing. A spark from 
one of the trains touched off an explosion, killing more than 600 passengers.

President Francesco Cossiga gave Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti a mandate to 
create Italy's 49th post-World War II government. Italy has been without a 
government since May 19, when Prime Minister Ciriaco De Mita resigned after 
criticism of his leadership by the No. 2 party in the governing coalition, the 
Socialists. Andreotti, like De Mita, belongs to the Christian Democrats, who 
have dominated Italian politics since World War II. The De Mita coalition 
apparently fell because of jockeying by the Socialists, led by former Prime 
Minister Bettino Craxi.

Florida Gov. Bob Martinez, who favors calling a special session of the state's 
Legislature to enact new restrictions on abortions, said he expects "very 
aggressive" lobbying by both sides but hopes there will be no use of violent 
tactics. The Republican governor, appearing on ABC's "This Week With David 
Brinkley," said areas of possible compromise "between the rights of the unborn 
and the rights of women" include permitting abortions in cases of rape, incest 
or where the mother's health is threatened. Also interviewed was Vermont's 
Democratic Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin, who criticized the Supreme Court's decision 
upholding a Missouri statute restricting abortions.

A major Afghan government arms warehouse exploded and burst into flames near 
Kabul's airport, destroying a large quantity of ammunition and weaponry, 
witnesses said. The explosion in eastern Kabul occurred close to midnight and 
shook buildings up to five miles away. It was not immediately known what caused 
the blast, but the city has been the target of repeated rocket attacks by 
Muslim guerrillas in the last week. The extent of damage, and the type and 
quantity of weaponry destroyed, was not immediately known.

CHINA HARDENS CRACKDOWN

China's new hard-line leadership, consolidating its crackdown on pro-democracy 
activists, has issued sweeping orders adding political crimes to legal 
violations and specifying punishments from imprisonment to execution. The 
orders, in a circular issued over the weekend by the Communist Party Politburo 
and the State Council, China's Cabinet, are seen as preparation for tough legal 
action against thousands of people being rounded up nationwide by security 
forces. Meanwhile, an editorial in the People's Daily, the official party 
newspaper, accused the United States and other foreign forces of harboring a 
"wild ambition" to subvert communism and using political and economic weapons 
to support that goal.

Iran's powerful Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani will face former Cabinet 
minister Abbas Sheibani in the July 28 presidential election, the official news 
agency IRNA reported. It said the two men were chosen by the Council of 
Guardians from among 80 people who had registered as candidates. "There is no 
serious challenger," one Iranian analyst said. "The only thing is how many 
millions they can get to vote to give Rafsanjani a strong political hand." 
Meanwhile, a radical deputy who had mounted a one-man challenge to Iran's 
leaders, accusing them of turning soft, quit Parliament. Iranian newspapers 
said last week that Abdolmajid Sharpasand had charged that a few leaders are 
monopolizing power and, because liberals with foreign affiliations are in the 
ascendancy, Iran is drifting away from its Islamic ideals.

20 YEARS LATER, SOME FOLLOWERS OF GURU STILL KEEP THE FAITH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MILES CORWIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SANTA BARBARA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Norman Paulsen has shown a remarkable ability during his 20-year career as a 
guru to preach asceticism and live in comfort. 
</P>
<P>
While most of his followers live in Utah and work long hours for low pay in one 
of the commune's small businesses, Paulsen lives in a waterfront Oxnard 
condominium a short walk from the group's 78-foot schooner, where he can sail 
every day and ponder cosmic issues without distraction. 
</P>
<P>
Paulsen has also persuaded his followers that he must be free from the 
constraints of daily labor, so members help support him, some tithing their 
income. 
</P>
<P>
While many former members of his Brotherhood of the Sun commune -- once based 
in Santa Barbara -- claimed in a lawsuit that they were hornswoggled by 
Paulsen, his current followers draw from a seemingly limitless reservoir of 
faith in Paulsen's claims of knowing the secret to the "tunnel to eternity" and 
"cosmic consciousness." 
</P>
<P>
At one time the Brotherhood owned a 3,000-acre ranch in Santa Barbara and was 
one of the nation's most prosperous communes. Commune members called their 
businesses Sunburst Farms, and they were the largest shippers of organic 
produce in the country. 
</P>
<P>
But by the late 1970s, the commune, beset by controversy and problems, began to 
collapse. Some members were frightened by Paulsen's decision to stockpile 
weapons and conduct military training drills at the commune. Others were 
disillusioned when Paulsen, who preached abstinence, became addicted to drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds defected; some sued. By 1980, the Brotherhood could no longer make the 
payments on its ranch and lost the property. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the tribulations and a move from California, the Brotherhood has 
survived. There are about 35 members still with the group, the last of the true 
believers, men and women approaching middle age who joined almost 20 years ago 
and have persevered, working in the commune's small businesses in Utah and 
Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
"All religions have been started by someone who has had a breakthrough in 
cosmic awareness," said Jonathan King, 39, a portly, gray-haired man who bears 
little resemblance to the ethereal seekers once associated with the group. "Men 
like Jesus and Mohammed had that breakthrough. And so has Norm. He still has a 
lot to teach us." 
</P>
<P>
In 1963, Norman Paulsen's visions landed him in the psychiatric ward of Santa 
Barbara County Hospital. A few years later, his visions made him a guru. 
</P>
<P>
The man and the era had met. 
</P>
<P>
Paulsen was working as a bricklayer in Santa Barbara in the early 1960s when he 
says he passed out after taking a few sleeping pills before retiring for the 
evening. At the hospital, while surgeons performed a tracheotomy, Paulsen said 
he had a "near-death" experience. He later told followers that he watched his 
body float above the room, saw three "ethereal men in robes" hovering about and 
was confronted with a "swirling vortex of light . . . the tunnel to eternity." 
</P>
<P>
The doctors "thought I was wacko," Paulsen says now, and he awoke in leather 
restraints in the psychiatric ward. He was transferred to Camarillo State 
Hospital for psychiatric observation and released after 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
In the years afterward, he began talking about this experience and others. But 
this time, instead of staring into the arms of a straitjacket he found a 
receptive audience of young seekers open to bizarre ideas, mystical experiences 
and Eastern religion. 
</P>
<P>
Melanie Arcudi was 19 years old, had just moved to Santa Barbara from the East 
Coast and wanted to learn how to meditate. She heard that Paulsen was leading 
meditation sessions at his home, a converted ice cream warehouse in downtown 
Santa Barbara. Arcudi, like many of the hippies, surfers and students who 
gathered at Paulsen's house in the late 1960s, was seeking a direction in life. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people were coming out of the turmoil of the 1960s," Arcudi said. 
"Many of us came from broken homes and were searching for the security we never 
had in our own families. At that time, Norm was a very strong father figure for 
all of us." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spiritual Seeker 
</P>
<P>
Paulsen commanded respect, Arcudi said, because he was older than the others 
(40 when he started the group); bigger (6-foot-4 and 275 pounds), and had 
greater experience as a spiritual seeker. He had been a disciple for a few 
years in the Los Angeles ashram of an Indian guru. Paulsen learned a meditation 
technique from the guru, Arcudi said, and enough Eastern religion to sound 
authoritative to a group of American teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
Arcudi, Paulsen and a few of the regular meditators decided they wanted to live 
communally, grow their own food and form their own alternative society. They 
purchased 160 acres in the Santa Barbara mountains, using as a down payment, 
Paulsen said in an interview, a $6,000 worker's compensation settlement he had 
received. But Arcudi says her mother contributed $50,000 toward the down 
payment. 
</P>
<P>
The early years, Arcudi said, were a glorious time. 
</P>
<P>
"For a while, it was like Camelot," said Arcudi, who left the group in 1979 and 
now works as an acupuncturist in Santa Barbara. "We were successful in 
everything we tried. We'd open a store and it would succeed so we'd open 
another one. We lived on a beautiful piece of land. More and more people were 
joining. It was a very exciting time." 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, the group purchased a spectacular 3,000-acre ranch, adjacent to 
spreads owned by Ronald Reagan and John Travolta, and turned it into the 
largest organic farm in the country. The commune eventually owned four markets 
in the Santa Barbara area, two restaurants, a bakery and had more than 300 
members. 
</P>
<P>
But as they expanded, Arcudi said, Paulsen changed. Eventually, she asserted, 
he came to represent everything the Brotherhood opposed. 
</P>
<P>
Although no alcohol, drugs or even cigarettes were permitted on the group's 
property, it was well known in the late 1970s, former members said, that 
Paulsen had a serious drinking and drug problem. 
</P>
<P>
Paulsen's addiction was cited numerous times in a lawsuit filed in 1981 by 
about 100 former members who sought a portion of the commune's assets. (They 
eventually dropped the suit.) According to the lawsuit, Paulsen was the subject 
of a Drug Enforcement Agency investigation in 1982 and acknowledged to DEA 
agents that he spent $60,000 on narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
But former members who were involved in handling the group's finances say 
Paulsen spent more than $200,000 of community funds during the late 1970s and 
early 1980s. They say he injected Demerol, Dilaudid, cocaine and other drugs 
obtained fraudulently from doctors or purchased on the street. 
</P>
<P>
Paulsen discussed his drug problems during a recent interview, which took weeks 
to arrange because he would only meet on the day when his astrological 
alignment appeared most propitious. "I was trying to catch a moon that was 
decent," he explained." 
</P>
<P>
Although his rhetoric may sound antiquated, Paulsen has a deep, mellifluous 
voice and a lyrical manner of speech. When he leans back in a chair in the 
living room of his wood-paneled condominium, clasps his hands over his great 
stomach and stares into the distance with heavy-lidded, liquid brown eyes, he 
resembles Buddha in repose. 
</P>
<P>
Paulsen acknowledged that he had been addicted to drugs, but said he has been 
completely clean for years. His addictions, he said, stemmed from medication 
prescribed by doctors for migraines and a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Same Explanation 
</P>
<P>
Paulsen still clings to the same explanation he gave his followers a decade ago 
when it was discovered that he had drug and alcohol problems. 
</P>
<P>
He blamed them. 
</P>
<P>
By counseling troubled members at the commune, Paulsen claims, he absorbed all 
their "bad karma." 
</P>
<P>
"You can't sit down and talk to someone without exchanging energy with them," 
Paulsen said earnestly. "If that person has negative thoughts, that leaves a 
residue of negative energy on the one who's trying to help. All that took its 
toll on me." 
</P>
<P>
The current followers in Utah and Nevada have accepted his curious explanation, 
and they now compare Paulsen's plight with the travails endured by Jesus. 
Because both Jesus and Paulsen gave too much to others and absorbed all their 
bad karma, they say, both men had to suffer. 
</P>
<P>
Jesus died on the cross. Paulsen abused drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Ableman was working on a farm in British Columbia in the mid-1970s when 
friends told him about the Brotherhood. He was tired of the Northwest's gloomy 
weather and was "longing for more of an extended family," so he and a friend 
hitchhiked to Santa Barbara and joined the group. 
</P>
<P>
Ableman began managing the apple and pear orchards and enjoyed living 
communally and having the opportunity to learn about organic farming. But soon 
he began having doubts about the Brotherhood. 
</P>
<P>
Ableman recalls working 12 hours a day and struggling for funds to keep the 
orchard going, while Paulsen siphoned off money for drugs and drove a Lincoln 
Continental. Other members recall how Paulsen spent extravagantly on quarter 
horses, silver saddles and sailboats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Houses, Fancy Cars' 
</P>
<P>
"I was sleeping on a wooden pallet in a sleeping bag while Paulsen and some of 
the leaders who didn't seem to do any work had houses and fancy cars," Ableman 
said. "A small clique began making all the decisions." 
</P>
<P>
While Paulsen initially espoused nonviolence, he grew increasingly paranoid 
through the 1970s. The group stockpiled thousands of rounds of ammunition and 
dozens of weapons, including Belgian assault rifles and M-14 military rifles. 
Under Paulsen's direction, a former Green Beret who lived at the commune began 
training members in military tactics in preparation for the collapse of 
society. 
</P>
<P>
One night, after Paulsen was stopped by a sheriff's deputy for drunk driving, a 
group of male members gathered at the ranch office and brought out the guns, 
recalled former member George Sessions. 
</P>
<P>
"Norm started yelling: 'Let's shoot up the Sheriff's Department,' " Sessions 
said. "It was close enough to Jonestown that some of us were pretty scared. 
Energy was running very high, and I don't know what could have happened. Norm 
finally stopped yelling because he was pretty drunk and fortunately, things 
fizzled out." 
</P>
<P>
Although several other former members agreed with Sessions' account, Paulsen 
rolled his eyes when asked about the incident and muttered, "That's a joke, an 
absolute joke." He declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
During the late 1970s, as Paulsen grew increasingly incapacitated by substance 
abuse, a handful of the commune's leaders stepped in to perpetuate the 
oligarchy, former members said. They drove luxury cars, lived in better housing 
than other members and made all the business decisions. 
</P>
<P>
By 1980, dozens of members had been purged from the ranks and others left in 
anger. Ableman recalls the day he was exiled. 
</P>
<P>
"Norm was sitting in his house, in a very dark room, with his shirt off, and he 
was quite drunk," Ableman said. "He said to me: 'I am the man they call Jesus 
of Nazareth. If you believe me you can stay. If not, get out.' I was told to be 
out of there by the next day." 
</P>
<P>
For many, their departure was traumatic. Some had lived in the commune for 
almost a decade, had worked 12-hour days building the businesses and had given 
every thing they owned to the group. 
</P>
<P>
"It was worse than a divorce," said Ableman, 34, who now manages an organic 
farm in Goleta. "If you leave a marriage you still have friends, neighbors and 
community. But when we were forced out we had to leave our entire world 
behind." 
</P>
<P>
After the first wave of defections, many of the commune's businesses, which had 
benefited from an abundance of free labor, could not survive, said Donna 
Belton, a former head bookkeeper for the Brotherhood. By 1980, the commune was 
unable to make payments on the ranch and had to sell it. Paulsen eventually 
discovered a 500,000-acre cattle ranch in eastern Nevada that he was able to 
purchase with a small down payment. 
</P>
<P>
Those who stayed with the community and made the move to Nevada were faced with 
great hardship, Belton said. The winters were brutal, the cattle they had 
purchased were sick and the growing season was so short that they could not 
raise enough crops to sustain themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Many returned to California. The remaining members struggled to keep the ranch, 
but, eventually, lost most of the property. On the remaining acres, they 
created a roadside gas station, a mini-market and a coffee shop. But these 
small businesses could support only a handful of members, so the others moved 
to the Salt Lake City area and opened two health food markets and, later, a 
demolition business. 
</P>
<P>
Paulsen's drug abuse worsened during this period and the group paid for his 
stay at treatment programs in Salt Lake City and Las Vegas, Belton said. 
Paulsen ended up staying in Las Vegas for several years, until he moved back to 
California eight months ago. 
</P>
<P>
While the current members in Utah and Nevada seem like anachronisms, still 
following a guru and spouting cliches from the 1960s, the group, in many ways, 
has adapted to the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Many have families and live in the suburbs. They have their own apartments in a 
slightly ramshackle four-story apartment house near Salt Lake City with 
barbecues on the patios and children's bicycles chained to the stairwells. 
</P>
<P>
The men who run the commune's businesses no longer have the luxury of devoting 
all their energy to meditation and the search for higher consciousness. The 
exigencies of meeting a payroll and turning a profit take up much of their time 
now. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Formal Board Meetings 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan King, general manager of the group's businesses in Salt Lake City, 
attends business seminars titled "How to Collect Accounts Receivable More 
Effectively," holds formal board meetings and plans to institute a 
performance-appraisal system for employees at the health food stores. 
</P>
<P>
Recently King, Paulsen and a few others in the group advocated abandoning the 
central element of the Aquarius Age commune -- the sharing of resources -- in 
favor of the prevailing ethos of the 1980s: the bottom line. So temporarily, 
until the group's next move, all members receive a salary and manage their own 
finances. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're single and 23 years old, it's easy to get by," King said. "But if 
you're 40 and have three kids and can't afford a winter coat for them, you're 
going to be less inclined to share what you eat with others." 
</P>
<P>
Although members no longer pool their resources, their life style still is 
communal in many ways: Members in Nevada live in the same trailer park, and 
those in Salt Lake City live in the group-owned apartment building; they still 
gather every day in one of the designated "meditation rooms"; most work for one 
of the group's businesses, and they all share the belief that Paulsen is their 
spiritual leader, a man who has met with God. 
</P>
<P>
While King has the mien and manner of the sober businessman, he is transformed 
when he discusses Paulsen. Eyes shining and smiling beatifically, King quoted 
Paulsen 11 times during a recent two-hour interview and described him as "a 
conduit hooked up to The Light . . . an instrument of divine will." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Long, Rambling Story 
</P>
<P>
When asked for evidence of Paulsen's cosmic powers, King launched into a long, 
rambling story of how he had a headache one day, had two aspirin in his hand 
and was just about to take them when Paulsen walked into the room. Suddenly, 
King said, in the fervored tones of a television evangelist, he felt a 
"transfer of energy coming from Norm right into my eyeballs." King fixed his 
visitor with a steady gaze and snapped his fingers. The headache, he said, 
simply disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Hansen, 40, joined the commune in his early 20s after dropping out of 
college. Today Hansen, a gaunt, balding man, works the night shift in the 
group's road-stop coffee shop, is paid $600 a month and sends Paulsen a $60 
check every month. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hansen and the other followers operate and manage the group's 
businesses, Paulsen's son, who lives in Oregon and never was an official member 
of the commune, is listed as president and head of the Board of Directors of 
all the group's businesses, according to records filed with the Utah secretary 
of state. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen said he has no interest in financial matters and he trusts Paulsen 
implicitly. He supported Paulsen's decision to rename the group the Builders, 
even though their primary business is a demolition company. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen and other followers say they are now waiting for Paulsen to find a plot 
of land in the desert where he can begin another commune, a model New Age 
community that they are convinced will spawn others just like it, until the 
satellite communities will give the Builders a membership and prominence far 
greater than the Brotherhood had in its glory days. 
</P>
<P>
Paulsen's stay in California is only temporary, he said, and he will rejoin his 
followers when the group makes their move -- probably to rural Arizona -- 
within the next few years. There, he said, members will grow their own food and 
build a "full-spectrum healing center" and meditation retreat. 
</P>
<P>
"I envision a place where all those who were once with us, and new ones as 
well, will gather and teach and learn . . . a place for those who are getting 
up in years to retire to."

BOLIVIAN 'RED ZONES' -- HAVENS FOR DRUGS

LA PAZ, Bolivia

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cocaine traffickers are trying to establish "red zones" in rural Bolivia where 
hostile crowds keep out anti-narcotics police, Bolivian officials say. 
</P>
<P>
In two recent incidents, hundreds of Bolivian farmers and townspeople turned 
against police who were hunting for drug traffickers. Several similar incidents 
over the past two years add up to a troubling trend, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The most successful "red zones" have been in the Chapare River Valley, a 
lowland area 200 miles east of La Paz that produces 80% of Bolivia's cocaine. 
Bolivia is the world's No. 2 source of raw cocaine after neighboring Peru. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Nicolas Anaya, a leading anti-narcotics police official in Bolivia, said 
"red zones" apparently yield the bulk of the raw cocaine that comes out of the 
Chapare. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 'red zones,' only people known by the residents get in," Anaya told a 
Bolivian newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Genaro Marquez, the undersecretary of the interior in charge of narcotics 
police, also expressed concern. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an evident intention to create free zones for narcotics trafficking," 
Marquez said. He added that traffickers are infiltrating civic groups and 
unions "to interfere with the frontal battle against drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities accused a farmer's union leader of encouraging between 1,500 and 
2,000 peasants to surround an anti-drug police patrol on June 28 at a Chaparean 
village named Puerto San Francisco. The farmer's union, however, said the 
peasants turned against the nine-man patrol only after it tried to arrest the 
union leader, Evo Morales. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the police officers, known as the Leopards, escaped into the jungle. An 
official of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in La Paz said the other 
five Leopards were beaten by peasants before they were rescued. 
</P>
<P>
The peasants burned the police truck that the Leopards were using. Authorities 
said 30 farmers were arrested, but the crowd helped union leader Morales and a 
drug trafficker known as "the Priest" to escape. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all farmers in the Chapare cultivate coca leaves, the raw material 
for cocaine. Last Tuesday, an estimated 15,000 of them gathered in a peaceful 
protest at Villa Tunari, where the Leopards have their main base in the 
Chapare. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration marked the first anniversary of an attempt by peasants to 
invade the Leopard base. One peasant was shot to death in the 1988 incident, 
and 11 others died after running in panic over a cliff into a river behind the 
base, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
On June 22, the Leopards ran into more trouble when they raided a drug 
trafficker's house in the town of Santa Ana de Yacuma, in the Beni district 
northeast of La Paz. Much of the cocaine from the Chapare is refined in Beni, 
and Santa Ana is a longtime trafficking stronghold. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a completely lawless town," the DEA agent said. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 Leopards were taken by helicopter to the outskirts in Santa Ana for 
the pre-dawn raid on the house of Hugo Rivero Villavicencia. Rivero has been 
sentenced in absentia to 10 years in prison for drug trafficking, but he has 
been living openly in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The Leopards sneaked into town and surrounded Rivero's house. 
</P>
<P>
"They were met by very heavy armed resistance almost immediately by 
bodyguards," said a DEA agent who received a full report from the Leopards. 
</P>
<P>
The Leopards killed four or five men, "all bad guys," the DEA agent said. They 
arrested five people, including two wounded men identified as bodyguards. 
</P>
<P>
The others arrested were a suspected Colombian drug trafficker, a 16-year-old 
boy who said he was a Rivero bodyguard and Fernando Roca Ali, a cocaine buyer 
for his half-brother, Jorge Roca Suarez, perhaps Bolivia's leading trafficker. 
</P>
<P>
But Rivero escaped arrest. He happened to be out playing a late game of pool, 
according to the DEA agent. He said the Leopards did not have time to find 
Rivero because the gun battle brought out a hostile and armed crowd of as many 
as 300 people. 
</P>
<P>
The Leopards sent up flares to call in the waiting helicopters for evacuation. 
As they evacuated, the crowd began shooting, and they were joined by several 
local marines assigned to a Bolivian naval garrison near town, the DEA agent 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that bullets from the marines' automatic rifles damaged two of the 
operation's five UH-1H "Huey" helicopters, which are on loan from the United 
States. The navy has started an investigation.

ISRAEL CRITICAL OF U.S. REACTION TO ATTACK ON BUS 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Israel's foreign minister complained Sunday to the U.S. ambassador about 
Washington's evident unwillingness to use the word terrorism to describe last 
week's attack on a bus that left 14 Israelis dead. 
</P>
<P>
Israel's government as a whole expressed concern that its allies in the United 
States as well as friendly governments in Europe displayed a lack of 
"sensitivity" toward the incident, which has left intense bitterness in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Moshe Arens told U.S. Ambassador William Brown that the bus 
crash, which was caused by a Palestinian who seized the steering wheel and 
plunged the vehicle off a busy highway, was reason enough for Washington to end 
its seven-month-old dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
"The foreign minister summoned the ambassador of the United States and told him 
Israel is unable to understand how the State Department could evade defining 
the murder of 14 civilians on the bus to Jerusalem as an act of terror," a 
Foreign Ministry spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"The minister drew the ambassador's attention to the fact that the PLO has long 
violated the conditions set by the United States government when starting the 
dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
Arens told Brown that the PLO tacitly approved of the bus assault because its 
leaders said that they could "understand" how someone might be provoked to take 
such a step by the ongoing violence between Israel and Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Brown last week described the bus incident as "loathsome." Neither 
Britain nor France commented directly. By way of contrast, the Soviet Union 
described the assault as "terrorism" on a Hebrew-language broadcast of Radio 
Moscow, Israeli Foreign Ministry officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan Administration began talks with the PLO last December after its 
chairman, Yasser Arafat, professed to abandon terrorism. The Bush 
Administration has deepened the contacts as it has sought a formula to end the 
Israeli-Arab conflict. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Embassy officials declined to comment on Arens' meeting with Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries have been strained in recent months. The 
Bush Administration has pressed Israel to come up with ways to talk peace with 
Palestinians in revolt against Israeli rule in the occupied West Bank and Gaza 
Strip. Over the weekend, Secretary of State James A. Baker III was reported to 
be growing impatient with the unsteady outline of Israel's plan to allow 
elections in the West Bank and Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's continued conversations with the PLO irritate Israel. Israeli 
officials contend that the talks undermine its own efforts to find local 
Palestinians willing to accept Israeli conditions for limited self-rule in the 
territories. 
</P>
<P>
Israel defines almost any attack on its citizens and soldiers as terrorism, a 
usage that has lost favor abroad during the past 19 months of the Arab 
uprising. More than 500 Palestinians have been killed during the unrest, mostly 
at the hands of Israeli troops. At least 35 Israelis have been victims of the 
unrest, including the 14 bus passengers last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Since the bus crash, a volatile mood of despair and anger has overtaken Israel. 
On Sunday, government leaders urged an end to mob attacks on Arabs that have 
taken place during the past three days. 
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet issued a statement that expressed empathy with the emotions raised 
by the crash and the deaths but called for vigilante violence to stop. "The 
government deplores irresponsible acts by Jews out of bitterness. Such things 
must not occur. They are harmful, not beneficial," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
"The people in Israel have been exposed to provocations and challenges for a 
long time, and this exposure is leaving its mark. The leaders and the people 
must maintain their composure and judgment in order to overcome our troubles," 
the message concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Police Minister Chaim Bar-Lev described Israeli assailants as "inciters, many 
of whom are primitive." 
</P>
<P>
One Arab has been killed during three days of attacks by Israelis on Arab 
neighborhoods and automobiles. The attacks began after news of the bus crash 
spread throughout the country. Besides the 14 dead, 27 passengers were injured 
in the single worst assault by an Arab on Israeli civilians in more than a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
The site of the crash along the busy Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway has become a 
way-stop for curiosity seekers and sympathizers who pull their cars over to 
stare, lay wreaths or pray. 
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, nationalist demonstrators took to the streets Sunday, chanted 
"Death to the Arabs!" and threw stones at cars bearing blue license plates that 
indicate Arab ownership. Police broke up the protest and arrested 12 people. 
Some of the protests have been spearheaded by the anti-Arab Kach movement 
headed by American-born Rabbi Meir Kahane. 
</P>
<P>
For the second day in a row, a government representative at a funeral of one of 
the victims was shouted down by mourners. This one, Ehud Olmert, is a member of 
the rightist Likud Party headed by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. Olmert was 
greeted with the heated question, "For an Arab, is it allowed to kill Jews?" 
</P>
<P>
The municipal council of Shaarei Tikva, an Israeli settlement on the West Bank, 
imposed a ban on Arabs entering the enclave. One of the 14 dead on the bus had 
lived there. "We took this step . . . to express our protest against the number 
of incidents in the recent past, . . . to prevent an outburst of accumulated 
anger of residents against Arabs and . . . to reconsider our security setup," a 
settlement spokesman told Israel government radio. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arab Unrest Hits Home 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the tension of the Arab uprising has deeply shaken the 
detached life of Tel Aviv and other Israeli cities that considered themselves 
remote from Arab-Israeli violence. Said a visitor to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv: 
"Suddenly, we are waking out of a dream. We too live this problem. The bus 
disaster made us realize that." 
</P>
<P>
The one-man assault on the bus occurred on one of the most popular routes in 
Israel and on its most crowded highway. The assailant, identified as Abdel Hadi 
Suleiman Ghanem, 25, had no previous police record, thus defying identification 
by security agents at the border crossing from the Gaza Strip where he lives 
and where Palestinians must show new identification cards. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, soldiers demolished Ghanem's house in the Nusseirat refugee camp in 
the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators told Israeli newspapers that the primary motive for the attack on 
the bus appeared to be vengeance for the beating of a brother of Ghanem's by 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
The political repercussions of the bus crash are still being played out. At 
Sunday's Cabinet meeting, Avner Shaki of the National Religious Party called 
for imposition of the death penalty, but no decision was taken. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Labor Party are scheduled to meet today to reconsider their 
participation in the coalition government with Likud. Labor has taken a dovish 
stand on the issue of peace talks and was shaken by Likud's recent decision to 
tighten conditions for holding elections in the West Bank and Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
However, political observers said that the deaths of Israelis last week may 
inhibit Labor from pulling out of the ruling partnership. "They do not want to 
appear to be soft on Arabs at this particular time," said one analyst.

MANDELA MEETING DRAWS MIXED REACTION;

KEY S. AFRICA BLACKS SHOW ANGER, PRAISE FOR VISIT WITH BOTHA

President Pieter W. Botha's surprise "courtesy visit" with jailed nationalist 
leader Nelson R. Mandela drew widely divergent reaction Sunday, with 
anti-apartheid leaders calling it a "cheap government scheme" to raise false 
hopes for Mandela's release and others applauding it as a first step toward a 
peaceful settlement of South Africa's problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The supposed meeting does not constitute any dramatic event in the history of 
this country, as the South African government would like the world to believe," 
said the Rev. Frank Chikane, secretary general of the South African Council of 
Churches, reading a statement from Mandela's family and other black leaders. 
</P>
<P>
To suggest otherwise, when Mandela is unable to freely consult with his people, 
"is nothing short of political mischief . . . designed to sow confusion in the 
minds of our people and of the outside world," said Chikane, flanked by 
Mandela's wife, Winnie, at a news conference in Soweto. 
</P>
<P>
"As Mandela himself has said, 'Prisoners cannot enter into contracts. Only free 
men can negotiate,' " Chikane added. 
</P>
<P>
The 45-minute meeting Wednesday between Botha and Mandela at the presidential 
mansion in Cape Town, disclosed by the government Saturday, was an informal 
chat over tea, and Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee said that possible 
negotiations and policy matters were not discussed. Botha's white minority-led 
government has over the years repeatedly refused to negotiate with Mandela's 
banned guerrilla group, the African National Congress, saying that it does not 
"negotiate with terrorists." 
</P>
<P>
Anglican Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize winner, said he 
was encouraged that Botha "has, at long last, heeded the calls of those who are 
interested in negotiations." But he said he was puzzled by the timing of the 
meeting, coming amid the ruling National Party's campaign for the Sept. 6 
general elections. 
</P>
<P>
Winnie Mandela said Sunday that she intends to visit her husband this week to 
find out why he had agreed to meet Botha. 
</P>
<P>
Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, the moderate leader of the 2-million-member Zulu 
nation, said the meeting meant that the 70-year-old Mandela's release from 
prison, where he has been held for 26 years of a life sentence for sabotage and 
attempting to overthrow the state, "is now only a question of time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'One of Last Great Gestures' 
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the first publicly known face-to-face encounter between the two 
men, "is certainly one of the last great gestures for which Mr. Botha will 
always be remembered by black South Africa," Buthelezi said. 
</P>
<P>
Although government officials described the meeting as important, and likely to 
improve South Africa's image overseas, many political analysts here said they 
considered the unusual get-together little more than the rogue act of an 
outgoing president with no authority to negotiate the country's future. 
</P>
<P>
Botha, 73, will step down after the parliamentary elections, after losing a 
bitter power struggle within his own National Party. He resigned in February as 
party leader and recently refused to attend the party convention or a farewell 
dinner that the party had planned for him. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts think Botha arranged the meeting with Mandela either to confound 
his party, to take credit for beginning the process toward peace or simply to 
meet the man whose incarceration has caused the government so many headaches. 
The two men did not discuss or plan further meetings, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'President's Prerogative' 
</P>
<P>
If the National Party wins the parliamentary elections as is widely expected, 
the new party leader, Frederik W. de Klerk, will become president, and 
government sources have suggested that a wide array of reform measures, 
including Mandela's release, would then be possible. De Klerk has declined to 
comment, except to say "it is the president's prerogative" to meet whom he 
wishes. 
</P>
<P>
The right-wing Conservative Party, the National Party's chief opponent in the 
elections, said it was "astounded by the fact that our head of state cordially 
entertains a convicted criminal in the presidency." Conservative Party 
information officer Koos van der Merwe said he was demanding "some straight 
answers from the government." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela's African National Congress and leaders of other anti-apartheid groups 
have said that meaningful negotiations about the nation's future cannot begin 
until Mandela and all political prisoners are released, the three-year-old 
state of emergency is lifted, the bans on the ANC and other groups are lifted 
and exiles are allowed to return home. Hundreds of white South Africans have 
made pilgrimages to ANC headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia, in recent months, 
however, to talk with the outlawed group and, in almost every case, have urged 
the government to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, considered by millions of South Africa's voteless blacks as their true 
leader, is being held on a prison farm about 60 miles from Cape Town. He has, 
over the years, refused many conditional offers of release, declining, for 
example, to accept exile or to renounce violence in exchange for his freedom.

PINNING DOWN THE REAL PRICE OF THAT MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
You've snared that big promotion and you are on your way to the big city. How 
do you determine whether your pay raise will buy a better standard of living? 
</P>
<P>
Often with great difficulty, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
The main problem is that consumer prices are hard to pin down: There often are 
wide variations within a city, especially on big-ticket items such as homes, 
health care and cars. 
</P>
<P>
"Costs are going to depend on what the family life style is. That's why we use 
as our (hypothetical) base, a family of four making $55,000" with a house and 
two cars, said Wallace McDonough, an executive vice president at the consulting 
firm Runzheimer International. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One of Few Surveys 
</P>
<P>
Runzheimer, which has gathered cost of living data since 1933, has one of the 
few surveys that takes into account after-tax income and life style (in its 
case, an essentially suburban family life style), along with the cost of goods 
and services. As such, it is widely regarded as providing the best cost of 
living analysis for corporate relocations. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble for many transferred workers, however, is that Runzheimer publishes 
the cost of living for only 10 cities. Consequently, workers must depend on 
their own judgment or a variety of less comprehensive studies to determine what 
impact a move will have on their personal finances. 
</P>
<P>
The most extensive source of basic price information is the U.S. Department of 
Labor, which publishes the consumer price index. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Comparisons Lacking 
</P>
<P>
The department's statistics indicate the rate of inflation for goods and 
service within individual cities, but they do not show how the cities stack up 
against each other in living costs. 
</P>
<P>
A 234-page study by the American Chamber of Commerce Researchers Assn. suffers 
from different kinds of shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
While consumers can make cost of living comparisons among the more than 250 
cities listed in the report, even the association admits readers cannot make 
fully accurate comparisons "because of the small number of items (59) priced." 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, Runzheimer takes into account more than 150 items. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMPARING THE COST OF LIVING 
</P>
<P>
The following table is based on a family of four residing in "Standard City, 
U.S.A." in a 2,400-square-foot home and incurring all normal home ownership and 
maintenance costs while having an annual income of $55,000. They also own two 
cars: a late model driven 14,000 miles per year and a 4-year-old model driven 
6,000 miles yearly. Other expenses include taxes, typical purchases for a 
family of four and investments. The index figures are the percentage variations 
from city to city. For example, the same family residing in Standard City 
would, in a move to New York City, require an income of $74,239, or 135% of 
their original income.

President Bush's minority policies bode well for blacks, but the legacy of 
Ronald Reagan lives on in recent unfavorable Supreme Court rulings, the 
executive director of the NAACP said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"This Supreme Court is dangerous to the well-being of black people, women and 
other minorities," said Benjamin L. Hooks. 
</P>
<P>
Minority group leaders may need to revive the civil disobedience of decades 
past if the Bush Administration and Congress fail to counter the anti-civil 
rights sentiment fostered by the high court, Hooks said. 
</P>
<P>
Hooks said the unfavorable rulings concerned affirmative action and civil 
rights.

May Call Demonstrations

"If Congress does not act, we must call upon our citizenry to mount such 
powerful demonstrations that the group gathered in China not long ago will look 
like a few compared with the millions that we mobilize," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hooks issued copies of the speech he gave Sunday night during an afternoon news 
conference on the first day of the National Assn. for the Advancement of 
Colored People's annual convention.

About 200 people who fled their homes because of a vapor cloud formed by a 
spill of nitric acid were allowed to return home early Sunday, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The leak at a Briggs &amp; Stratton plant, which manufactures lawn mower 
engines and other machinery, was stopped and the spill was neutralized with 
agricultural lime, a police spokeswoman said. She said a security guard who 
checked on the Saturday leak was overcome by the vapor and held overnight for 
observation at a hospital.

SURF, SAND STILL LURE LONGTIME LIFEGUARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BECHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Claude Panis drove a red rescue Jeep over freshly raked sand in Huntington 
Beach, smiling despite the stiff, chilling breeze that whipped in from the 
ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll clear up by noon," Panis said. "I know." 
</P>
<P>
There is no place Panis, a career lifeguard, would rather be. He has not left 
this beach for more than a few days in years. 
</P>
<P>
For Panis this summer, with its crowds and its crises, will be the 12th as a 
lifeguard in Huntington Beach. He will see hundreds of thousands of residents 
and visitors flock to the sand, and he will see at least a few thousand of them 
suddenly in trouble in the surf. 
</P>
<P>
Panis is a marine safety officer, a supervisor patrolling the three-mile 
stretch of city-operated beach year-round, ready to back up lifeguards who keep 
watch in the summer from the beach's 27 blue-and-red towers. 
</P>
<P>
But please, just call him a lifeguard. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't sit in an office from 9 to 5," Panis said. "I have this aversion to 
paper." 
</P>
<P>
Panis is a lifer, a veteran at just 27. The beach, and lifeguarding, have been 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since I've been a kid, I've had this attraction to the beach," Panis 
said. "I get 
</P>
<P>
nervous when I go inland. The ocean is like a second home to me." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Hawaii, Panis swam competitively as a child and joined the Huntington 
Beach Junior Lifeguard program at age 10. He later spent time in lifeguard 
towers, getting a peek at a job that would become his lifelong profession. 
</P>
<P>
"I stuck it out," he said. "I knew I had to wait for my calling. My dad kept 
asking, 'When are you going to get a real job?' He said I can't keep messing 
around on the beach all day." 
</P>
<P>
To become a lifeguard, candidates must compete in three swims, held in late 
winter in chilly water. Once hired, they may return each summer as long as they 
pass an annual test swim of 1,000 yards in less than 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"They're definitely a unique breed," Panis said. "I always looked up to 
lifeguards. They were my heroes. They were strong and physically sharp. I was 
impressed with the image they portrayed." 
</P>
<P>
In his second year of lifeguarding, Panis rescued three girls with a single 
buoy after they got caught in a rip current amid lashing waves, sending them on 
a crash course toward the pier. Panis said they grabbed at each other's hair. 
</P>
<P>
"I had my doubts that I would get them in," he said. "I kept thinking, 'I don't 
want to see anyone die here.' I knew how to handle myself, but you still have a 
lot of respect for the power of the waves." 
</P>
<P>
If this summer is like the last in Huntington Beach, more than 6 million people 
will flock to the beach. Nearly 3,000 will need to be rescued from the surf. 
Lifeguards, Panis said, are trained to anticipate those moments. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't wait for a big, dramatic situation," he said. "We don't wait until a 
guy is thrashing his arms and going down. We don't have lifeguards saying, 'Oh, 
a drowning. Time for me to work.' " 
</P>
<P>
Usually, lifeguards watch for danger signs and yell warnings before drownings 
begin, he said. 
</P>
<P>
People most likely to need rescuing, Panis said, are drunk or wear shirts that 
weigh them down or play on inner tubes, which can send swimmers on a one-way 
ride to open water. 
</P>
<P>
"And you get guys who want to impress their girlfriends," he said. "We rescue 
more guys than we do girls. They always want to show their girlfriends how 
macho they are. The girls have enough sense to stay out." 
</P>
<P>
Working in life-or-death situations has led to high rates of burnout. "We've 
had people working here who couldn't handle it," Panis said. "They checked 
out." 
</P>
<P>
In the water, Panis has been fortunate. He has never failed at a rescue, but 
there have been many close calls. 
</P>
<P>
"I've accepted that I've put myself in a job where I'm going to have to deal 
with those things," said Panis, a licensed emergency medical technician. "As 
long as I'm doing the best I can, I can walk away knowing that I've done 
everything I could." 
</P>
<P>
Lifeguard Mike Gifford, 29, has known Panis since they were boyhood friends in 
the Junior Lifeguard program. 
</P>
<P>
"He loves this job," said Gifford, who, unlike Panis, plans eventually to leave 
lifeguarding. "He doesn't try to make it an intellectual thing. Instead, he 
puts his heart and soul into it." 
</P>
<P>
Panis, who lives with his wife and two children in Orange, plans to avoid being 
a full-time administrator as long as he can. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to teach (others) how to be good lifeguards," he said. "I always 
tell them that without us, the beach would be a deathtrap."

ALL-STAR GAME: MEDIA; 
</P>
<P>
BROADCAST ARMADA SAILS INTO ANAHEIM -- EVEN FAN REAGAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When broadcast giant Red Barber called his first All-Star game more than half a 
century ago, featuring the likes of Lou (the Iron Horse) Gehrig and Jimmie 
(Double X) Foxx, he had little in the way of high-tech gadgetry or armies of 
assistants to aid him. 
</P>
<P>
"There wasn't anything terribly exciting or dramatic about it," the now-retired 
Barber -- longtime voice of the Brooklyn Dodgers -- recalled in a recent 
interview from his Florida home. "You went into a cramped little (radio) booth 
with a single sound engineer, and you broadcast the game. It was that simple." 
</P>
<P>
Today, more than the score card has changed. 
</P>
<P>
When the national spotlight shines Tuesday on Anaheim for the 60th playing of 
baseball's annual All-Star game, a staggering array of nearly a thousand print 
and broadcast media representatives will be on hand to relay the balls and 
strikes, the highlights and trivia notes, to millions of fans around the world 
in words, pictures and sounds. 
</P>
<P>
NBC -- the media outlet for an estimated 51 million people who will watch the 
game live -- is spending $8 million to import 90 production people, a Goodyear 
blimp camera, 12 stationary cameras, two hand-held minicams, 13 videotape 
replay machines, 3 1/2 miles of audio cable and more. 
</P>
<P>
The "and more" in this case includes ex-Chicago Cubs announcer Ronald Reagan, 
who will be making what NBC officials say is a broadcast first when the former 
President gives a special on-the-air appearance in the booth. 
</P>
<P>
Posing potential problems for the network, however, are late-afternoon shadows 
-- a result of the 5:35 p.m. game time necessary to capture the East Coast 
prime-time viewing audience. 
</P>
<P>
"Those aren't ideal conditions to televise a game in or to watch it in, but 
there's not much we could do," said Kevin Monoghan, sports information director 
for NBC. 
</P>
<P>
Shadows or not, the extravaganza marks a chance for Angels planners to show the 
viewing world that there is a place called Orange County that is distinct from 
Los Angeles and Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
Team information director Tim Meade, coordinating press coverage, said that 
with the eyes of the baseball world generally focused on Los Angeles and the 
Dodgers, "a lot of people forget about the California Angels and this part of 
the Southland. This is our chance to make them remember, and we're not going to 
waste that opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Toward that end, the team brought in Johnny Grant, the Emmy-winning producer 
who oversees the Hollywood Walk of Fame, to orchestrate a weeklong series of 
parades, tributes and other events at Anaheim Stadium that will culminate in 
Tuesday's game. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to make this into a kind of jubilee in celebration of this whole 
area and what it has to offer," Grant said. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't measure what this attention means to Orange County," added Steve 
Bailey, who has announced baseball games locally for KMPC since 1951. "It 
further establishes the area as a home to major league baseball and a growing 
urban center in its own right. Just think of all the stories that will be 
coming out of here with an Anaheim dateline on them." 
</P>
<P>
Among the destinations for those stories, baseball officials said, will be 
Japan, Latin America, and -- for the first time for an All-Star game -- the 
Soviet Union, which has reporters from its Tass news agency in town to cover 
the event. 
</P>
<P>
The media rush on Anaheim began in earnest Sunday, as dozens of reporters, 
cameramen and others in the industry filtered into the Anaheim Hilton to 
collect their press credentials for the game. Major league baseball expects to 
give out more than 700 credentials, in addition to those taken by NBC. 
</P>
<P>
Among them are representatives of local newspapers and broadcast stations 
around the United States and Canada who are in Anaheim to keep a close eye on 
the performances of their hometown players and to gather quotes from those 
players afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Also on hand are special-interest media representatives, such as: Curt Clemons, 
who will do pre- and post-game interviews with black All-Stars for New York 
radio station WWRL and 107 other black-oriented stations across the country; 
Ismael G. Reyes of Houston, who will give Spanish-speaking listeners around the 
United States and Latin America a close look at the Latino ballplayers, and 
Kenneth V. Allan of Burbank, who will report back to U.S. troops around the 
world through Armed Forces radio and TV. 
</P>
<P>
"My job," said Clemons, "is to see that the black players -- the guys who might 
not get on the air otherwise -- are heard and seen by our listeners." 
</P>
<P>
While the task of getting hundreds of media people to their accommodations 
promptly, getting them credentials and helping them set up might seem a 
logistical nightmare, team officials and others involved in the processed say 
preparations are going smoothly so far. 
</P>
<P>
"You always report back on how you're treated by the host city," said Reyes of 
the Spanish-language network, "and so far everyone's been very courteous and 
helpful. It's been terrific, and I've really been impressed with the whole 
area."

FANS OF THE '80S STILL GO BANANAS OVER THE MONKEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hey, hey, they're the Monkees. And, believe it or not, they've still got a lot 
of fans. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three years after television gave birth to the group, the Monkees 
managed to attract several hundred fans -- some reportedly from as far away as 
Japan -- to a three-day convention and nostalgia-fest in Universal City. 
</P>
<P>
And in what is certainly a tribute to (or indictment of) the power of 
television, many of these fans were too young to have been alive when the show 
originally aired. They have come to know the goofy quartet, whose members 
specialized as much in slapstick as in music, through MTV, reruns and a much 
ballyhooed reunion and tour that began in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
At Sunday's session, in a ballroom of the Sheraton Universal, the crowd watched 
Monkee videotapes. They squealed as each Monkee appeared on the big-screen TV 
and sang along to the group's theme song. Most wore Monkees T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the Monkees -- Mickey Dolenz, Peter Tork and Davy Jones -- reunited in 
1986 and have been touring. Michael Nesmith has stayed away from the fun but 
joined the others in concert at the Universal Amphitheatre on Sunday night, an 
event that organizer Marla Martinez called "historic." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Once-in-a-Lifetime' 
</P>
<P>
Dana Porter, 15, said she and her mother, who live in North Muskegon, Mich., 
have traveled nationwide to Monkees events. They came here this week because 
the Monkees are being honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing," the high school student said. 
</P>
<P>
Dana says she learned about the Monkees from her mother. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother tapes them (reruns) and we watch them together," Dana said. "They're 
a real great group of guys. They're spunky and energetic. They make the show 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Monkees Over Beatles 
</P>
<P>
Michael Macaluso, 39, a Woodland Hills T-shirt merchandiser, confided that the 
Monkees aren't his favorites; he grew up a Beatles' fan. But he has collected 
enough Monkee memorabilia to work conventions in five cities in the last two 
years. The Monkees' following is small, he said, but dedicated. 
</P>
<P>
Macaluso's children, however, would take the Monkees over the Beatles any day. 
The Beatles, 7-year-old Leah said, are "so stupid. They don't even have a (TV) 
show!" 
</P>
<P>
For Monkee memorabilia collectors, the convention had a lot to offer: For $8 
you could buy a T-shirt, with the trademark MONKEES in psychedelic letters 
shaped into a guitar; the "official" Monkees jigsaw puzzle (some pieces 
missing) for $30; old albums ranging in price from $8 to $25; a Monkees Thermos 
for $40, and for just $185, an original, 1967 box of Monkees bubble gum cards. 
</P>
<P>
For a really special souvenir, however, you could buy a dollar raffle ticket 
for a piece of Monkees clothing: Dolenz's silver silk trousers, for example, or 
Nesmith's embroidered cowboy shirt. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Diltz, 50, has been photographing the Monkees since 1967, and he says 
their old pictures are still his biggest sellers. He displayed some from the 
late '60s, with the Monkees in love beads and long hair, and more recent photos 
that showed them on the Pat Sajak show or playing polo. 
</P>
<P>
Diltz, like others, attributed the Monkees' longevity to television. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a 4-year-old son who watches the shows," Diltz said. "He loves it. He 
doesn't know they're reruns. He doesn't know it's 20 years old." 
</P>

REFUGEE HAS HOPE HIS DAUGHTER IS STILL ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The last time Tang Bao Can saw his daughter was during the family's painful 
escape from Vietnam five years ago when she was snatched from his arms by 
pirates. 
</P>
<P>
But Tang, 44, who now lives in Santa Ana with his wife, Thai Thi Loan, 45, 
remains optimistic that his daughter, Tang Bich Hang, is still alive. 
</P>
<P>
The couple placed an advertisement in Sunday's Bangkok Post, offering a $7,500 
reward for information leading to her return. Tang also offered $2,500 just for 
proof that his daughter is still alive. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a good feeling that my daughter is still alive somewhere in Thailand," 
Tang said in a telephone interview from his home Sunday. "I am under the 
impression that the pirates that kidnaped her are not too bad, that they are 
better than others." 
</P>
<P>
Tang said he "has worked hard to make and save money" and has friends in 
Bangkok ready to offer the reward on a moment's notice. 
</P>
<P>
"I must wait to become American (U.S.) citizen to visit Bangkok myself. But I 
have friends there who are ready to reward anyone who can bring my daughter 
safely to the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok," Tang said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Might Have Been Sold 
</P>
<P>
"She might have been sold to someone, she might be a wife in Bangkok." 
</P>
<P>
Tang said his daughter was taken by Thai pirates who boarded their drifting 
boat loaded with refugees on Oct. 26, 1984, in the Gulf of Thailand off 
southern Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
"They robbed everything and were throwing young men in the sea," Tang said. 
</P>
<P>
When Tang tried to stop the rape of one of three women attacked by the pirates, 
they seized his daughter, then only 13, and took her away with the three women. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to stop them, but they beat me very badly," Tang said. 
</P>
<P>
The pirates were apparently scared away when a helicopter flew overhead. The 
boat, which originally carried 110 people, drifted to Malaysia. Tang, his wife 
and their son, now 22, eventually reached the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Tang, who is a manager of an auto parts store, said he reported the abduction 
to the United Nations and the Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
"I reported it in Bangkok, in America, everywhere," he said. "They did send me 
reports that they were still looking for my daughter, but no results. The last 
report I got was two years ago. Since then I have heard nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County and other Southern California Vietnamese community leaders have 
claimed that about 3,500 women have been abducted by pirates and sold into 
prostitution or as slave labor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Embassy Advice 
</P>
<P>
During a 1987 visit to Orange County by Steven J. Kraus, coordinator of the 
Boat Rescue Program at the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, Kraus suggested that 
Vietnamese community leaders request that U.S. dollars be earmarked to help 
find missing women. 
</P>
<P>
While Kraus advised families to do all they could to gain information about 
kidnaped relatives, he warned against Vietnamese families spending great sums 
of money to hire investigators to search for missing relatives, especially 
women. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Kraus said that he had heard of Vietnamese families spending 
thousands of dollars but that "not one woman" was found. 
</P>
<P>
Tang's daughter was abducted at a time when fierce attacks by Thai fishing 
vessels often ended in rape, torture and murder. In 1981, for example, 80% of 
all refugee boats arriving in southern Thailand reported being stopped by 
pirates. In the same year, 455 deaths were reported from such attacks, and 360 
people were reported missing and presumed dead, according to the U.S. State 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, the United States joined 11 other countries to fund an anti-piracy 
effort. The percentage of refugee boats that were attacked by pirates dropped 
from 69% that year to 44% in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Tang said he believes his daughter may have survived because the pirates who 
boarded their boat that day seemed "more human" than others who had tried to 
waylay the refugee boat three times before. 
</P>
<P>
"The young man who took my daughter, he treated her very nice," he said. "If 
they were going to kill us, they could have done it right away, but they just 
threw some men out to sea. They only beat me because I tried to hold on to her. 
They seemed more human than the other pirates." 
</P>
<P>
Tang said he worked for U.S. Army intelligence during the Vietnam War and spent 
five years in "re-education camp" after the Communist takeover in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
"We came here with nothing, with zero," Tang said. "My friends and relatives in 
America and Thailand are helping me with this. Whoever brings her to the U.S. 
Embassy in Bangkok or can confirm to me that she is alive, they will be paid 
immediately."

<P>
TODDLER KILLED WHEN HIT BY RELATIVE'S TRUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Fullerton toddler was struck and killed by his uncle's truck outside a 
relative's Norwalk home in what officials said Sunday was a tragic accident. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan Anthony Moss, 22 months, died less than an hour after he was hit Saturday 
night by his uncle's 1985 Ram Charger, said Los Angeles Sheriff's Sgt. Matthew 
McDannel. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Vincent Simmons, the baby's 29-year-old uncle, was not cited. 
</P>
<P>
"From what we can tell," McDannel said, "it was just a tragic accident, and the 
uncle was not held in custody." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Ryan was apparently being watched by an aunt, Judy Gaysford, 
at the home in the 12600 block of Longworth Ave. when the accident occurred. 
Neither the boy's father, James Moss, nor the mother was present. 
</P>
<P>
There had been a party at the house, and several people had gathered about 8 
p.m. at the curb outside to bid farewell, McDannel said. 
</P>
<P>
As Simmons kissed his sister goodby, Ryan was in the front yard playing with 
other youngsters but evidently stepped off the curb into the street, McDannel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Because Simmons' truck "sits pretty high, he just didn't see him," McDannel 
said. Ryan was struck by the truck's right front wheel. Ryan was rushed to 
nearby Coast Plaza Medical Center in Norwalk, where he was declared dead.

POSTSCRIPT: NEW LAW FORCES HARBOR BLVD.'S STREETWALKERS TO TAKE A HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A little traffic enforcement apparently has succeeded where all else had 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
For years, despite the efforts of Santa Ana Police, prostitutes in search of 
customers had paraded along Harbor Boulevard, hailing motorists and openly 
soliciting. 
</P>
<P>
At its worst, police estimate, there would be 30 to 40 prostitutes at a time 
soliciting business from passing motorists. In all there were hundreds of the 
women, many of them traveling a circuit from city to city and congregating on 
busy thoroughfares to solicit. 
</P>
<P>
But Robert Fitz, a designer at Harbor Flower World, 100 N. Harbor Boulevard, 
has noticed a difference where he works near 1st Street and near his home 
farther north. 
</P>
<P>
"I live up by 17th (Street) and Harbor on the border of Garden Grove and Santa 
Ana," Fitz said. "Lately I haven't noticed that many (prostitutes). I have 
noticed the signs that make it illegal to stop along Harbor after certain 
hours. They've got to find another place to roam." 
</P>
<P>
"There are still some, but not many," Fitz said. 
</P>
<P>
In March, Santa Ana officials initiated a ban on the parking and stopping of 
cars along Harbor from 4 p.m. to 9 a.m., the period when streetwalkers 
generally solicit business. The tactic followed a clash in court with the 
American Civil Liberties Union over an earlier attempt by police to combat the 
streetwalkers. 
</P>
<P>
In February, an Orange County Superior Court judge rejected the city's plan to 
declare more than a hundred suspected prostitutes to be public nuisances and to 
bar them from Harbor Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"The city tried to get an order declaring 350 named and 1,000 unnamed 
defendants declared public nuisances," said ACLU attorney Rebecca Jurado. "We 
argued that was in violation of . . . due process. The court found the city's 
efforts were not within its authority." 
</P>
<P>
The judge agreed with the ACLU that the proposed action would infringe on 
constitutional rights. Under the rejected ban, women suspected of repeated 
prostitution were to be barred from appearing within 100 yards of problem spots 
along the boulevard. The penalty for violating the court order would be fines 
of up to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
But in agreeing with the ACLU, the judge noted that the all-out ban was 
tantamount to asserting that "every attractive woman on Harbor Boulevard is 
assumed to be a hooker." 
</P>
<P>
City officials turned quickly to another approach. On March 6, the City Council 
voted to impose the no-stopping, no-parking restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, there have been no legal challenges, according to Santa Ana City 
Atty. Edward J. Cooper. "No complaints whatsoever," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The parking ban also worked immediately in reducing the solicitation activity 
along Harbor, said Santa Ana Police Lt. Jim Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"It decreased the number of girls hailing passing motorists, but it displaced 
them to private property . . . shopping centers, convenience stores, fast-food 
places, doughnut shops; places they can duck into if they see a police officer 
coming," Davis said. "To counter that, we've assigned two teams of officers." 
</P>
<P>
The uniformed officers, working in pairs, patrol the boulevard and operate what 
police call "a tag-along program," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
"When we have those officers working the street and the girl is on the 
boulevard, if there is nothing we are going to arrest them for, the officer 
stays right there with them," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
"No john's going to pick them up with a cop standing right there." 
</P>
<P>
Arrests along Harbor Boulevard have declined as prostitutes have left the area, 
Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
"Initially we had arrests, but girls got the message real quick, and that's 
when they started moving to the private property." 
</P>
<P>
The suspected prostitutes would "run on to private property when they saw us," 
Davis said. "We anticipated that that might be a byproduct, so we got all the 
merchants to post their property: 'No Loitering.' " 
</P>
<P>
With the cooperation of property owners, police began arresting and citing 
suspected prostitutes for trespassing during the daytime and for prowling at 
night when they were caught loitering on private property. There were dozens of 
arrests for a variety of other offenses, including narcotics violations and 
solicitation of prostitution, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of the parking ban and the tag-along patrol officers "has 
really curtailed the problem," Davis said. "I've received probably half a dozen 
phone calls from merchants along Harbor and people who use Harbor Boulevard . . 
. with very positive comments about the lack of prostitutes." 
</P>
<P>
Davis acknowledges that ultimately, however, Santa Ana's success in ridding 
Harbor Boulevard of streetwalkers may contribute to a problem elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"When we started this push, I got a call from Hollywood vice (division of Los 
Angeles Police Department) asking me what we were doing because of the sudden 
increase of girls up there," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU's Jurado said she has heard no complaints about the police enforcement 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's totally within their police power to declare a particular area a 
non-stopping area," she said. "They are within their authority to enforce the 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as they stay within the bounds of that authority, there shouldn't be a 
complaint."

SAN CLEMENTE DEDICATES NEW PARK TO SLAIN PATROLMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dispatcher Pat Petri had just asked a young patrolman to investigate a medical 
emergency when she got the call that still haunts her -- and San Clemente's 
police force -- nearly 11 years later: 
</P>
<P>
"Officer down." 
</P>
<P>
Richard T. Steed, 30, an amiable young officer who had been on the job for 
nearly three years, had responded to the report that a man was injured. And in 
an alley near the downtown business district, he got out of his car and was 
shot, twice. 
</P>
<P>
An hour later, at San Clemente General Hospital, he was pronounced dead, 
becoming the first -- and still only -- San Clemente police officer to die in 
the line of duty. 
</P>
<P>
Petri, now a community services officer, remembered Steed on Sunday as she, his 
fellow officers, members of his family and some 100 spectators joined San 
Clemente officials in dedicating a new city park in his name. 
</P>
<P>
Carved out of the brown hills east of downtown San Clemente, the 40-acre 
facility is to be called the Richard T. Steed Memorial Park and World Class 
Softball Complex. So far it has four grassy ball diamonds, but more play areas 
are planned, according to South Coast Sports Enterprise, which developed the 
park jointly with the city. 
</P>
<P>
At the entrance to the complex is a bronze plaque explaining that Steed was 
killed while on duty on Nov. 29, 1978. "Blessed are the peacemakers," it says. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested a suspect in Steed's death, 23-year-old transient James Richard 
Hoffer, who was suffering an apparently self-inflicted stab wound. Hoffer was 
charged with murder, but in 1981 he was found not guilty by reason of insanity 
and was committed to Atascadero State Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's ceremonies were marked by a rifle salute and dozens of red, white and 
blue balloons, as well as speeches that mixed joy over the opening of the park 
with brief, sometimes sorrow-tinged remembrances of Steed. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though Rick was the first peace officer to die in the history of San 
Clemente, let's pray he's the last," said the slain officer's father, Henry C. 
Steed, a retired engineer from Whispering Pines, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the senior Steed was delighted over the testimonial to his son. 
</P>
<P>
"He would have loved this," Steed said. "He loved ball. He liked to play 
baseball" and even hurried through his wedding so he could get to a game. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Steed, the officer's widow, called the dedication "wonderful. He would 
have wanted to be the first one to hit a ball," she said. Later, she strode out 
to the pitcher's mound and formally opened the park with a ceremonial first 
pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Again and again, dedication speakers said they believe Steed would have wanted 
an upbeat affair -- not a solemn one. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want this to be a somber affair in terms of testimonials and tears 
that were many years ago," explained Gary E. Brown, who was police chief when 
Steed was killed and who is now deputy city manager of Visalia. But, he said, 
"by doing this you are showing that you do care, that you do remember." 
</P>
<P>
For police officers like the current chief of police, Albert C. Ehlow, Sunday's 
ceremonies were "a dream come true." Soon after Steed's death, officers started 
a campaign to name a park after him, Ehlow said. There were several proposals, 
including one attempt by the council to name a rose garden after Steed -- which 
police officers considered inappropriate. But until now, "it just didn't 
happen," Ehlow said. 
</P>
<P>
Like dispatcher Petri, Ehlow said he still recalls the night Steed was killed. 
Then working as station commander, he got a call at home that one of his 
officers had been hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Ehlow said he sped to the hospital, where "I found out it was Rick." One bullet 
had grazed Steed's arm, and the other had hit his upper left chest, apparently 
"through his (bulletproof) vest." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Ehlow said, a Los Angeles police officer who specialized in police 
shootings studied how the bullet could have bypassed Steed's vest. 
</P>
<P>
"He theorized that Rick saw the gun at the last moment. He drew." But as he did 
so, Steed apparently "dipped his shoulder" and leaned forward, and the bullet 
went inside the top of the vest, entering his left side, the police chief said. 
</P>
<P>
Ehlow called Steed a good officer who didn't have much of a chance again the 
man who shot him. His luck as a cop was up, Ehlow said. "It was his time." 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Bill Trudeau, who in 1978 was the first officer to respond to Steed's 
shooting, agreed. But he also said, "I use this (incident) to tell the guys 
about safety" -- that even when they're responding to a medical aid call, they 
should be cautious. 
</P>
<P>
Trudeau said he tells officers: "Remember, you walk out that back door, you 
might not come back."

<P>
A review of the 200 years of research on the relationship between high 
temperatures and aggressive behavior supports what police officials have long 
suspected: Heat waves and crime waves are related. 
</P>
<P>
Writing in the July issue of Psychological Bulletin, Craig Anderson of the 
University of Missouri at Columbia reported that hot weather and violent crime 
are intertwined. Anderson reviewed about 100 studies dating to the late 1700s. 
</P>
<P>
"Each data source had its limitations, but if they all tell the same story, you 
start to believe the results," Anderson said. Poring over crime data and field 
studies, Anderson saw that "hotter years, quarters of years, seasons, months 
and days all yield relatively more aggressive behaviors such as murders, rapes, 
assaults, riots and wife beatings, among others." 
</P>
<P>
"Temperature is specific to aggression," Anderson said. Now, he said, he and 
other psychologists want to know why this is true.

SCIENTISTS WORK AGAINST TIME TO UNRAVEL MYSTERY OF VANISHED CIVILIZATION IN 
CHACO CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH E. BROWN, Brown is a free-lance science writer in Coronado. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deep within a barren, rocky, half-mile-wide canyon in northwestern New Mexico, 
a small army of scientists is working against time to solve the mystery of a 
long-vanished pre-Columbian civilization. There, multistoried buildings, 
elaborate waterworks and far-ranging road networks have challenged 
archeologists for more than a century. 
</P>
<P>
The site is Chaco Canyon, 120 miles west of Santa Fe in the heart of the arid, 
desolate, 30,000-square-mile San Juan Basin of the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
For about two centuries, a civilization of up to 20,000 people demonstrated 
highly advanced engineering skills, building massive homes, roads and other 
facilities before vanishing. They left no written history and few skeletal 
remains. 
</P>
<P>
But they did leave behind a major, puzzling question: How could a people so 
primitive in many ways be so advanced in others? 
</P>
<P>
Between about AD 900 and 1115, even without the wheel or metal tools, Anasazi 
Indians built a community rivaling the pyramids of Egypt or the Great Wall of 
China in size and complexity. By one estimate, their nine massive stone "Great 
Houses" alone could have housed 50,000 people. The largest, the five-story 
Pueblo Bonito, covered three acres at the base of a 100-foot-high mesa and had 
walls three feet thick and more than 650 rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Each house contained one or more kivas -- covered, circular underground 
ceremony rooms. These obviously served religious needs. Yet there is evidence 
that only a few of the other rooms in each house were ever used for living 
purposes such as cooking and sleeping, leading some scientists to speculate 
that the primary purpose of the elaborate ancient Pueblo community was more 
religious than utilitarian. 
</P>
<P>
The size of the Great Houses suggests that a lot of people were needed to build 
and occupy them. Yet while a few scattered skeletons have been found in Chaco 
Canyon, a century of searching has unearthed not a single formal burial ground. 
Archeologists ponder: What happened to the remaining dead of the two-century 
civilization? 
</P>
<P>
The Chacoans also built -- or overbuilt, as some scientists put it -- more than 
400 miles of graded, curbed outlying roads, some wider than a modern two-lane 
road. Yet their builders did not have wheeled carts, so a narrow footpath would 
seem to have served as well. Nor did some of the roads seem to link important 
parts of the Chaco community. The most famous one, the Great North Road, for 
instance, runs north-south for 35 miles, over small hills rather than taking an 
easier route around them, ending at the edge of a wild, uninhabited canyon. It 
is, in the description of one scientist, a "road to nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
The Chacoans had no writing, no metallurgy and no plow -- three factors without 
which a culture generally is considered "primitive." Yet in many ways, suggests 
David Hurst Thomas, curator of anthropology at the American Museum of Natural 
History in New York, "the Chacoans were surprisingly advanced." 
</P>
<P>
They were, for example, accomplished astronomers. On Fajada Butte, for example, 
near one end of the canyon, "they carved a rock calendar so accurate the sun 
lights its center like a dagger at the summer solstice. And both their houses 
and their irrigation system displayed a superb knowledge of engineering." 
</P>
<P>
For a little more than two centuries, the Chacoans gathered in this remote 
place, tending their crops of corn, beans and squash with wooden sticks in 
meager, marginally productive soil. Then, inexplicably, they abandoned 
everything around AD 1115, never to return. Why they left is just one of the 
many puzzles left unsolved. 
</P>
<P>
The ruins were discovered in 1849 by a U.S. Army expedition led by Lt. James 
Harvey Simpson. In 1895, Richard Wetherill, an archeologist with the then-new 
Smithsonian Institution, led the first of many archeological expeditions. By 
far the biggest effort was the Chaco Project, an interdisciplinary study that 
began in 1972 under co-sponsorship of the National Park Service, which has 
administered the site as a national historic park since 1907, and the 
University of New Mexico. Before the project ended 10 years later, scientists 
had inventoried more than 2,500 sites in the canyon and outlying area, 
excavated 27 of them and recovered more than 300,000 artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
The artifacts furnish many pieces in the Chaco jigsaw puzzle. Carved wooden 
figures of birds, horns, hoops and prayer sticks found in just one of the Great 
Houses, Chetro Ketl, underscore the religious nature of the settlement, for 
instance. Turquoise from the Santa Fe area and shells from the West Coast 
suggest its far-flung regional nature. And items such as Mexican copper bells 
strengthen the belief that the Chacoans had strong cultural and trade ties with 
their pre-Columbian neighbors to the south. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists, trying to sort out what it all means, are still poring over 10,000 
pages of research into Project Chaco, which ended in 1972. Meanwhile, new 
research is being conducted into specific parts of the Chaco story. "One thing 
is certain," says Bonnie Wilson, National Park Service interpretive officer at 
Chaco Culture National Historic Park. "For every question that's been answered, 
there seem to be two more waiting to be asked." 
</P>
<P>
There's a sense of urgency for the latest research. Time is taking its toll at 
Chaco Canyon. Many of the buildings and artifacts are fading after a millennium 
of wind and rain. 
</P>
<P>
Later this summer, Dr. Robert Vallier of the University of Tennessee will lead 
a team of researchers to study and catalogue rock art ("picked" or painted 
designs) at about 100 sites in the canyon. A specialist in semiotics -- the 
science of symbols -- Vallier notes that rock art is the closest thing to a 
written history left behind by the Chacoans. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't Cezanne or Picasso but it tells us a lot about any people," he says. 
"And after about 1,000 years, some of the best examples here are fading fast." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the canyon's wood, too, is deteriorating. There is a lot of it; by one 
estimate, the Chacoans cut more than 215,000 trees for roofs, beams and floors. 
"A lot of what's left must be preserved for study," says Dabne Ford, who is 
directing a Wood Preservation Project funded by the NPS. "Tree-ring dating is 
one of the best methods of pinpointing important dates and events in the 
Chacoan period. Once that wood is gone, we'll lose the most valuable clues to 
such questions as where the trees were cut and how far they were hauled. Most 
important is when it was cut; we've been able to pinpoint some cuttings down to 
not only the year, but the year and month." 
</P>
<P>
Ford's preservation project is now in its fourth year. So far, more than 6,000 
samples of wood have been removed from their sites. Some were sent to a 
laboratory for tree-ring analysis; tree rings not only are used to date trees, 
they also provide clues to long-term weather cycles such as prolonged droughts 
-- valuable in determining possible reasons why the Chacoans abandoned their 
ancient pueblos. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Anna Sofaer is as concerned with the religious and ceremonial 
aspects of Chacoan life. An artist and photographer, she is president of the 
Solstice Project, a privately funded, nonprofit group formed in 1978 to study, 
document and preserve the remarkable Chaco sun dagger discovered atop Fajada 
Butte at the summer solstice a year earlier. The dagger represents a celestial 
calendar of the ancient Chacoans -- ancestors of today's Pueblo Indians -- and 
marks, in addition to both winter and summer solstices, the 19-year cycle of 
the moon as well. 
</P>
<P>
Since finding the dagger, Sofaer's group has widened its study to other facets 
of the Chaco complex that suggest that religion played a far greater role in 
its establishment than was once believed. Thousands of remote imaging 
photographs from both airplanes and satellite, for instance, have accurately 
defined the linear design of many of the buildings and roads in the canyon and 
beyond. This information suggests how the ancient Indians relied on lunar and 
solar phenomena and, in turn, how the sun and moon figured into Anasazi 
religion. Even among their descendant Pueblo Indians of today the sun is 
considered the source of life itself. 
</P>
<P>
How many people lived permanently in Chaco Canyon? Although figures ranging 
from 6,000 to 20,000 have been suggested, a maximum of 2,000 may be closer to 
the truth. That is the figure offered by Stephen H. Lekson, a visiting scholar 
at the Arizona State Museum in Tucson who was a principal investigator in the 
Chaco Project. 
</P>
<P>
But as continuing research scales down the population estimate, it has enlarged 
the view of the canyon as a vast regional religious center and the physical 
size of the Chaco complex in general. 
</P>
<P>
"Given a dramatic increase in the scale of the Chacoan system," Lekson 
concluded in a paper delivered last year, "we must reevaluate our hypothesis. . 
. . It is clear that the picture now emerging signals the beginning of a new 
generation of Chacoan studies."

SWEEPS TARGET GANGS, DRUNKS AND 'JOHNS'

Los Angeles law enforcement agencies conducted three crime sweeps this weekend 
targeting gang members, drunk drivers and men who solicit acts of prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
Gang-related shootings continued, despite more than 285 arrests by the police 
task force called "Operation Hammer." Although 216 suspected gang members were 
arrested, four separate gang shootings accounted for six gunshot wound victims 
this weekend, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The task force, introduced by police Chief Daryl F. Gates last year, has been 
conducting periodic sweeps on weekends in areas where gangs have been most 
active. The latest shooting occurred early Sunday just hours after the 
Operation Hammer task force ceased its operation. 
</P>
<P>
An unidentified man was wounded in the head in a gang-related drive-by shooting 
in the El Sereno area east of downtown, Hollenbeck Division Sgt. George Spitzer 
said. The victim was standing near Edison Street and Monterey Road at about 
5:30 a.m. when he was hit, Spitzer said. The man, whose name was not released, 
was treated at the scene by paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
Anonymous witnesses reported the gunman's license plate number and about an 
hour later police arrested a suspect at Mission Road and Valley Boulevard and 
recovered the gun allegedly used in the shooting, Spitzer said. The suspect's 
name was not available, police said. 
</P>
<P>
In another weekend sweep, about 70 Los Angeles police and California Highway 
Patrol officers arrested more than 200 suspected drunk drivers in the downtown 
area and surrounding streets, Central Traffic Division Lt. Dan Hills said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Arrestees were processed through the Police Department's Immediate Booking and 
Release System, which allows officers to quickly return to patrol duties after 
detaining suspects. Arrestees with no outstanding warrants are held in two 
mobile buses that serve as temporary holding tanks until they are picked up by 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
In a third task force effort, 24 men were arrested Friday night and early 
Saturday for soliciting acts of prostitution on 7th Street between San Pedro 
Street and Central Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The Newton Division "Trick" Task Force concentrated on arresting the male 
customers of prostitutes. The sting operation included six female police 
officers who stood on the sidewalk and -- without provocation, police said -- 
got solicitations from men in cars and pedestrians, authorities said.

AS HIS POWER CONTINUES TO SURGE, MITCHELL HAS SHORTAGE OF PRIVACY

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He has just been knocked off the cover of Sports Illustrated by a golfer, a 
newspaper photographer is chomping at the bit to get a shot of him in black 
leather and a television camera crew is looking for new and exciting ways to 
record him putting on his socks. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, the King of the Wiffle Ball is not happy. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Mitchell, San Francisco Giants outfielder, National League All-Star and 
latest challenger to Roger Maris' record (that record), is a nice enough guy. 
For all of his menacing physical features -- Popeye chest and forearms, the 
scar from a shotgun blast on his back, reminder of a tough upbringing in San 
Diego -- he goes by the cute and cuddly nickname of Boogie-Bear. He has a ready 
grin, topped by a gold front tooth, and he's quick to thank his grandmother and 
a plastic bat and ball for his current success in major league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
But people have been known to change according to circumstance. In this case, 
Mitchell seems to be experiencing the initial pangs of adjustment due to the 
fact that he's hitting the holy circumstance out of the ball this season. 
</P>
<P>
His 31 home runs and 81 RBIs through 87 games lead the major leagues and 
already have surpassed the statistics of last season's National League most 
valuable player, Kirk Gibson (25 homers, 76 RBIs). Maris hit 61 home runs in 
1961; he got No. 35 in the Yankees' 86th game. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Melvin, a Baltimore Orioles catcher who played with the Giants in 1988, 
summed up Mitchell's first half of 1989 when he said: "Kevin has already had my 
dream season." 
</P>
<P>
Which, of course, means that the weight of national attention has dropped on 
Mitchell. For the most part, he has handled it well. But on this particular 
day, winding down to the All-Star game, he's not feeling particularly chatty. 
</P>
<P>
Dusty Baker, Giant hitting coach, has told Mitchell there would be days like 
this. Baker was a teammate of Henry Aaron's when the Hammer chased the all-time 
home run record in 1974 and would like to see Mitchell become a little less 
accessible. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember Hank would take two rooms in every hotel we stayed," Baker said. 
"One room was just to take phone calls, the other was in another part of the 
hotel and it was for sleep. 
</P>
<P>
"Your game has got to come before interviews. You have to escape, mental rest 
is just as important as physical rest. I'd like to see Kevin get away from all 
this a little more." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, his teammate and roommate, outfielder Donell Nixon, has had the 
phone number at their house changed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting ridiculous," Nixon said. "It never stops. I don't know how these 
people are getting our phone number, we're not giving it out." 
</P>
<P>
It was just 1987 and across the bay that Oakland rookie Mark McGwire had hit 33 
home runs by the All-Star break and endured the same kind of attention Mitchell 
is getting. McGwire tried to accommodate all and eventually found it too much. 
He slumped during the second half of the season and hit 16 homers. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the attention hasn't got to Mitchell. Nor has a chronic inflammation of 
his right knee, which sometimes makes it painful to run. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1982 there have been 39 instances where hitters have hit 20 or more home 
runs by the All-Star break. But only two players, Andre Dawson in 1987 and Tony 
Armas in 1984, have hit 20 or more in the second half of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Fast starts mean a lot of attention and something is bound to give. 
</P>
<P>
Baker says that when Kevin Mitchell is your friend, "He's the best friend you 
can have. But if he's your enemy, he's your worst nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell is usually the first player to arrive in the Giants' clubhouse before 
a game. It's not unusual for him to show up five hours before game time. 
</P>
<P>
But on this day, Mitchell is late. The Giants are scheduled to stretch at 4:30 
p.m. for their 7:30 game against the Houston Astros, but when 4:30 comes and 
goes, Mitchell is nowhere to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows where he is, not Manager Roger Craig, not Nixon, not Matt Fischer, 
the Giants' director of media relations who's trying to soothe the frayed 
nerves of two fashion reporters and one photographer. 
</P>
<P>
Because Mitchell is not around, Fischer offers the trio first baseman Will 
Clark as a substitute model. Clark is hitting .332, 14 homers and 64 RBIs and 
is generally regarded as the best first baseman in the National League. 
</P>
<P>
"Who? Which one is he?" one of the reporters asks. 
</P>
<P>
Will Clark might as well be Roy Clark. The trio wants Kevin Mitchell and will 
accept no substitute. 
</P>
<P>
When Mitchell does show up, at 4:50, he sees the fashion reporters, the 
photographer, a television crew and a reporter from Los Angeles, all there to 
capture the real him and greets them with hostile indifference, utters an 
expletive and walks to his cubicle. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting there, he gives off near-tangible vibrations that he does not want to 
talk. In this case, when Kevin Mitchell doesn't talk, people listen. 
</P>
<P>
His mood is dark because he has been holed up in an Oakland television studio 
for a couple of hours doing an interview. He's late, and he hates to be late to 
the park. 
</P>
<P>
But what he's most angry at is the news that he was knocked off the cover of 
Sports Illustrated by Curtis Strange, who had won his second consecutive U.S. 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell says he had been promised the cover and to such ends had been tied up 
last weekend taking pictures and doing interviews. His family, including his 
grandmother, Jesse Whitfield, whom Mitchell credits with just about everything 
that's right in his life ("A great woman, she's everything to me."), had been 
in town for that same weekend but the demands of the magazine had meant he 
could spend very little time with them. 
</P>
<P>
"This really hurts," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's accomplishments this season are all the more stunning because he has 
never hit more than 19 home runs in his professional baseball career. Not with 
Tidewater (nine) or Kingsport (seven) or Lynchburg (one). 
</P>
<P>
There's the possibility that he will hit more home runs this season than he hit 
his first three years in the major leagues (53). 
</P>
<P>
At 5-foot-11 and an oil tanker-solid 210 pounds, Mitchell definitely has the 
body to hit home runs. During the off-season he conferred with Willie Mays and 
Tony Gwynn. Mitchell was told he needed to stay on his back foot more on his 
swing and that he needed to be more patient on breaking pitches, which he has 
done. 
</P>
<P>
"He's letting pitchers come to him," Baker said. "He's sitting back in that 
chair." 
</P>
<P>
But the practical application of such things destined to have such profound 
effects on his career came via a plastic ball costing about 89 cents at better 
toy stores everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Wiffle Ball made Kevin Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
"It gave me the quick bat speed and taught me to wait for the breaking pitch," 
Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
During the off-season he and Nixon played in the driveway with such players as 
Chicago White Sox third baseman Eddie Williams and Boston Red Sox designated 
hitter Sam Horn. 
</P>
<P>
"I get so pumped up to play Wiffle Ball, I don't know which I like better, 
Wiffle Ball or baseball," Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
Considering that baseball pays a smidgen more, he might want to stick with the 
national pastime. Anyway, Mitchell's contract with the Giants ends at the end 
of this season, which means he'll probably have the financial stability to 
build his own Wiffle-ing process plant by next year. 
</P>
<P>
As good a year as Mitchell is having on the field, Nixon finds Mitchell's feats 
on the driveway just as impressive. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the King of the Wiffle Ball," Nixon said. "Oh my goodness, he hits some 
incredible shots. Across the street is routine for him. He hits the kind of 
balls that you have to go searching for in the neighbor's bushes. I'm telling 
you, he's the King of the Wiffle ball." 
</P>
<P>
Nixon is asked if he has ever beaten Mitchell at the game. There's a long pause 
accompanied by an incredulous stare. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the King of the Wiffle Ball." 
</P>
<P>
Right. 
</P>
<P>
Other, more conventional reasons for Mitchell's season: He's wearing contact 
lenses at the suggestion of Jesse Whitfield. 
</P>
<P>
When Whitfield talks, Mitchell listens. He credits her with saving him from the 
mean streets of San Diego, where he grew up and ran with a gang called 
Pierules. She offers advice on hitting, life style, etc. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to have a statue made of her and put it in my house," Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's his general obsession with hitting. 
</P>
<P>
"If you let him, he'll talk about hitting all night and some of the morning," 
Nixon said. 
</P>
<P>
He swings bats in pools, he sits in his room the night before a game and 
reviews what the next day's opposing pitcher has done against him, he dreams 
about what he'll do the next day. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like I have a fatal attraction," he said. "I'm crazy about the game." 
</P>
<P>
His teammates would agree, especially after a recent and particularly quirky 
episode involving a bat. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell used pitcher Rick Reuschel's bat -- a thick piece of lumber 
reminiscent of a table leg -- to hit a home run. Mitchell liked the bat so much 
that he ordered a dozen for himself. 
</P>
<P>
The bats were shipped to him with his name, instead of Reuschel's, burned into 
the barrel. Mitchell claimed that the change in signature messed up the bats' 
aerodynamics and refused to use them. 
</P>
<P>
Such attention to detail might seem surprising considering Mitchell's major 
league resume and reputation. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Mets, with whom he hit .277 with 12 homers and 43 RBIs in 1986, 
the team's World Series championship year, traded him to the San Diego Padres 
in 1987. After the trade, mention was made that Mets officials feared Mitchell 
might be a bad influence on Dwight Gooden or Darryl Strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's background of gang violence in San Diego had made him hard-headed 
and untrusting as a young player. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the way I grew up, I was a bit protective of myself," he said. "I 
thought I always had to watch my back." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Mitchell has never been arrested for drugs or picked a fight with a 
teammate while team pictures were being snapped, as have those he was 
apparently going to spoil. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard the talk after I left (New York)," Mitchell said. "I never understood 
it. Maybe they rated me as a bad guy from the start and I never got rid of that 
tag." 
</P>
<P>
The tag was just as difficult to shed in San Diego, where those friends from 
gang days started coming around again. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Whitfield tried to shield Mitchell from it, but he started to slide. He 
was hitting only .245 after 62 games with seven home runs and 26 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through the 1987 season, the Padres traded him to the Giants. With his 
third team in less than two seasons, Mitchell was feeling like so much lost 
luggage. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't understand why people couldn't see the Kevin Mitchell who played 
every game like it was the last game of his life," Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
A television camera is focused on Mitchell as he gets dressed. It's incredible 
how many angles there are of a man putting on his clothes. Kevin Mitchell may 
put his pants on one leg at a time, but he gets national exposure when he does 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell pretends he doesn't notice the camera as he dressed, but it's hard to 
ignore instructions such as, "let's get a tight shot of him buttoning." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell is still smarting from the Sports Illustrated snub and is refusing to 
acknowledge any media-types presence, let along speak to them. As he tells one 
reporter who requests five minutes for a story he's working on: "I'm tired of 
stories." 
</P>
<P>
Once dressed, he heads out on the field, talks with teammates and then takes 
some batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
It's a very windy day in Candlestick -- which is redundant -- and the wind is 
blowing in toward home plate, kicking dirt into the Giants dugout and 
prohibiting every hit ball from going over the fence. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell steps in and hits a few wicked line drives, then launches a couple of 
shots that clear the fence with room to spare. The wind is still blowing hard, 
but it makes no difference. The ball is flying off his bat. 
</P>
<P>
He bounds out of the cage and walks through the tunnel back to the clubhouse 
screaming, "I feel good. I feel too good." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell goes on to say that he prefers to have a headache, an ingrown toenail, 
anything to make him a bit angry while he's playing. Still, the the crack of 
the bat has transformed him. He's ready to talk. He's ready to be photographed, 
he tells the fashion people he'll make a special trip to Candlestick at 9 a.m. 
tomorrow and put on the leather. 
</P>
<P>
While talking to a reporter he is absolutely charming, bristling only at the 
suggestion that his present performance might be a fluke. Mitchell believes he 
can continue this type of hitting, and more. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I can do better than I'm doing now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon agrees, saying nothing Mitchell does surprises him except, the 
bare-handed, over-the-shoulder, crossing-into-foul-territory catch he made 
against the Cardinals in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that was unbelievable," Nixon said. "But nothing amazes me about him. Guys 
think that he's having one awesome season. I tell them this is the real Kevin 
Mitchell and that he can do this every year." 
</P>
<P>
Which may mean that the King of the Wiffle Ball may just end up as the King of 
the '90s, but there's still 80 or so games and 1989 to traverse. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, a big man in a San Francisco Giants uniform did make on to the cover 
of Sports Illustrated. But it was Rick Reuschel, not Kevin Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell hit five home runs last week. Apparently, the King wasn't feeling too 
good.

Twenty-two years have passed and so, apparently, has major league baseball's 
statute of limitations. The Angels and the city of Anaheim have been given the 
chance to put on another All-Star game.

<P>
Some people never learn.

On the evening of July 11, 1967, the Angels played host to an All-Star game not 
unlike their own history. For a long time, nothing happened. It lasted nearly 
four hours, required 15 innings, produced 30 strikeouts and made a local folk 
hero out of Tony Perez, who finally ended the thing with his merciful home run 
off Catfish Hunter in the top of the 15th. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, the American and National Leaguers were bogged down in a hopeless, 
go-nowhere 1-1 tie, transforming the Big A into the Big Zzzz. And until the 
All-Stars played 12 scoreless innings in Oakland in 1987, Anaheim '67 was held 
up as the most striking example of how not to throw an All-Star bash. 
</P>
<P>
Rule One: Do not start the game at dusk. 
</P>
<P>
This was the big mistake of 1967 -- the decision to schedule the first pitch 
for 4:15 p.m. PDT. Good for national television, horrible for All-Star hitters. 
And, worse still for the All-Star fan, who has come to expect such things as 
hits and runs and a little fun in return for his attention. 
</P>
<P>
The '67 All-Star game promised a great time for all. The National League lineup 
featured Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, Lou Brock, Ernie Banks and Roberto Clemente. 
The American League had Carl Yastrzemski, Mickey Mantle, Harmon Killebrew, Tony 
Oliva, Tony Conigliaro and Rod Carew. These were hitters of real appeal. 
</P>
<P>
They shouldn't have spent the better part of the evening squinting into a 
setting sun, trying to pick up that white blur coming out of hands of Juan 
Marichal and Dean Chance. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two years later, the Angels have been trying to plug the 1989 event by 
flashing "highlights" from the 1967 game on the Anaheim Stadium scoreboard. Oh 
boy. Here's some footage of Clemente striking out four times. There's Jim 
Fregosi fielding a ground ball. And how would you like to see that Perez home 
run for the 493rd time? 
</P>
<P>
Things will be different this time, the All-Star organizers say. Times have 
changed -- specifically, the starting time, which has been pushed back to 5:30. 
Now, the hitters might actually have a fighting chance. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Stadium also has changed, for better or for worse. In 1967, when a 
hitter stepped to the plate, he could look beyond the outfield fences and 
survey the lay of the land. He could see freeways and trees and, if the winds 
shifted the smog just right, mountains. He really could watch the sun set. 
</P>
<P>
But before Anaheim was able to lure the Rams from Los Angeles in 1980, the city 
had to agree to enclose the stadium, thus wiping out that view in the pursuit 
of more seats between the 20-yard lines. 
</P>
<P>
There goes the sun. 
</P>
<P>
If that makes for a better All-Star show on Tuesday, fine. But in the name of 
progress -- and expanded seating capacity -- charm is often lost, and the 
setting of the 1989 game bears only a passing resemblance to the site of the 
1967 marathon. 
</P>
<P>
American League All-Star Nolan Ryan, architect of four no-hitters during his 
eight-year career with the Angels in the 1970s, hadn't seen the place since 
1979. Last week, stopping by with the Texas Rangers, Ryan took a look around 
and had to pan the revisions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's disappointing to see the stadium the way it is now, all closed in," he 
says. "It wasn't like that when I was here. I always thought it was one of the 
best in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, it's just another big stadium." 
</P>
<P>
Some other concessions to the passage of 22 years: 
</P>
<P>
THE BIG A 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1967: The most distinct baseball scoreboard in the majors used to stand 
behind the left-field fence inside Anaheim Stadium. A gargantuan replica of the 
capital A that now adorns the Angels' caps, the Big A featured a halo that used 
to glow after Angel victories (A favorite Dick Enberg exhortation during those 
days: "And the halo shines tonight!") as well as the message board made famous 
during the Ryan years. The mind's eye has forever frozen the image: Ryan 
grunting and grinding on the Anaheim Stadium mound, silhouetted by a giant 
flashing "K" on the Big A scoreboard. It is perhaps the happiest memory an 
Angel fan can own. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1989: There's no Big A in the Big A anymore. To enclose the stadium, they 
had to remove the old scoreboard, which now stands adjacent to the Orange 
Freeway, no longer functional, a burned-out Orange County landmark. In 1980, 
the Big A was replaced by a smaller board, surrounded by six advertising 
panels. 
</P>
<P>
JUMBOTRON 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1967: The old message board was black and white, usually informative but 
graphically limited. Clapping cartoon hands and huge block letters flashing 
CHARGE! and GO! were about as creative as things got. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1989: Jumbotron, installed before the 1988 season, gives the Anaheim 
Stadium spectator instant replays, baseball bloopers, player mugs and, of 
course, commercials -- all rendered in vibrant, living color. Sometimes, 
pertinent statistics are also squeezed in between the Dot Race and the 
Guess-the-Attendance quiz. 
</P>
<P>
CONCESSIONS 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1967: Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack? At Anaheim's first All-Star 
game, you could do that and maybe grab a hot dog, some popcorn, a beer and even 
some ice cream if you were so moved. With 15 innings, you probably were able to 
sample them all. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1989: Along with everything else in Orange County, the menu has gone 
yuppie. Chicken tacos, broccoli-stuffed potatoes, discus-sized cinnamon rolls, 
Evian bottled water, strawberry daiquiris, "gourmet" hamburgers -- this is 
nouveau cuisine, Anaheim Stadium style. 
</P>
<P>
THE PUNCHING BAG 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1967: Two decades ago, American League All-Stars had to take out their 
frustrations the old-fashioned way -- by breaking their bats or bones in their 
hands by pounding the dugout walls. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1989: The '89 AL All-Stars will find a huge padded punching bag dangling in 
the runway next to their dugout. Cookie Rojas, the Angels' manager during the 
1988 season, had it installed when his players began hitting more walls than 
curveballs. Could come in handy Tuesday for any pitchers required to face Kevin 
Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
So, is this any place to hold an All-Star game? 
</P>
<P>
Well, they've held them on plastic grass and under fiberglass roofs, so Anaheim 
shouldn't be any worse than most. 
</P>
<P>
And, here's some good news for fans of offense: Since the enclosure of the 
stadium, the ball tends to carry better, with the added decks of seats serving 
as a windbreak. With Bo Jackson, Mark McGwire, Eric Davis and Kevin Mitchell on 
hand, the home-run derby should be interesting, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
It is also a stadium overdue for a memorable moment or two. Reggie Jackson hit 
his 500th home run and Rod Carew got his 3,000th hit here, but ever since 
Donnie Moore served up that playoff home run to Dave Henderson, the Big A has 
seemed locked in a hangover that only recently has shown signs of breaking. 
</P>
<P>
And already, the 1989 All-Star game portends certain promise. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Schmidt, retired but voted into the NL starting lineup nonetheless, will 
be introduced before the game and will trot out to the first-base line, to tip 
his cap to the crowd one last time. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, once the ultimate Angel and now the ageless Ranger, will get to pitch for 
the home team one last time. 
</P>
<P>
And, for the first time, a new wave of young talent -- Mitchell, Jackson, Ruben 
Sierra, Benito Santiago, Devon White -- will be ushered in, providing a sneak 
preview for the All-Star meetings of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
The final meeting of the 1980s has a chance to be a good one. Twenty-two years 
after boring everyone to tears, Anaheim and the Angels are hoping this second 
go-round will bowl us all over. 
</P>
<P>
So let us raise a plastic cup of Evian in a toast. 
</P>
<P>
Here's to a 10-9 final.

TIME HELPS THE ANGER SUBSIDE FROM ALL-STAR ARGUMENT LEFT UNSETTLED

<P>
In the summer of '67, Roger and I were ready to let our hair grow and 
experience the country. 
</P>
<P>
We had just graduated from one of those snooty Eastern prep schools with a 
button-down dress code and an academic environment that made everyone who 
scored below 1,500 on his SATs feel like an underachieving nincompoop. 
</P>
<P>
After four years of underachieving, we'd had enough of our 40 classmates for a 
while and decided to head west. 
</P>
<P>
Mind you, Roger and I were very close friends. We played football, basketball 
and baseball together. We swiped our mothers' credit cards and went shopping 
for blazers, regimental ties and Weejuns every weekend. We liked the same music 
(Motown) though neither of us could dance a lick, and had the same taste in 
girls (anyone who would speak to us was acceptable). 
</P>
<P>
We were clones. Except in one area. Roger could never accept the simple fact 
that Mickey Mantle was the most talented baseball player of all time. He 
thought Roberto Clemente was better. He was clueless. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody could ever hit the ball as hard as The Mick," I'd say. "And if he only 
had a good pair of knees . . . " 
</P>
<P>
That one really sent Roger off. "You want knees, I gotta knee for you, you 
idiot," he say. Then he'd start doing something like quoting statistics, which 
we all know lie. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, with this one difference of opinion, we packed up Roger's Volkswagen 
Bug early that summer and pointed the nose toward the West Coast. We had all 
the usual things on the agenda -- check out the arch in St. Louis, spit into 
the Grand Canyon, take a picture at Hollywood and Vine. And get to Anaheim by 
July 11 for the All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
Through a friend of my mother's, we got great tickets to the game. Right behind 
home plate. But it wasn't long after we settled in to watch this stinker of a 
game that the old Clemente-Mantle bugaboo took over. Before we had served the 
full 15-inning sentence, Roger and I had managed to so irritate each other that 
we would barely speak to each other for the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't simply that the game was boring, 30 strikeouts in a 2-1 National 
League victory. Heck, we had grown up in Washington, where the Senators had 
spent generations refining boredom into an art form. It was just that Roger and 
I hadn't been out of each other's sight in three weeks. All I wanted out of 
this game was for Roberto Clemente to fall on his face; all Roger wanted was 
for Mickey Mantle to trip over the first-base line. 
</P>
<P>
Well, we both got our wish. Mantle was called out on a third strike by home 
plate umpire Ed Runge as a pinch-hitter in the fifth inning. Roger enjoyed that 
very much. I was so angry that Runge had the gall to do such a thing that I 
spit my Coke on Roger's knee. Roger enjoyed that very little. 
</P>
<P>
Clemente, who struck out four times, didn't help his mood, either, though I 
suspect I had something to do with that. After Clemente's fourth strikeout and 
the needling from me that went along with it, Roger had had enough. "That's 
it," he shouted. "Shut up, shut up. We have had our last conversation." 
</P>
<P>
We drove back to my aunt's home in Los Angeles without saying much that night, 
then began the long, quiet ride back to the East Coast a few days later. We had 
scheduled a visit to the World's Fair in Montreal before the trip had begun, 
and because we weren't communicating enough to change plans at that point, we 
found ourselves there about a week later. 
</P>
<P>
Some fair. Not even a damn roller coaster. I guess we didn't need one; we'd 
been riding one ever since the game. 
</P>
<P>
We got back to Washington a few days later, and that fall went our separate 
ways to college. We got together occasionally during vacations after that; I 
moved to New England after college and Roger and I lost touch entirely for 
years. When I moved to Orange County four years ago, there was another couple 
thousand miles between us. 
</P>
<P>
Then two years ago, Roger and I found ourselves together again at our 20th high 
school reunion. He seemed like someone I might like to get to know. Not too 
long after that, my wife and I with our two kids stayed with Roger, his wife 
and two kids for a few days when we were visiting Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The two visits were wonderful. We talked about growing up in Washington, 
raising kids on either coast, mortgages, playing golf and anything else that 
came up. Almost anything, that is. I never brought up The Mick, and he didn't 
mention Roberto Clemente.

PAGEANT REVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
A CELEBRATION OF THE HUMAN ELEMENT IN ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KNIGHT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Laguna Beach's Pageant of the Masters has always taken the long view, 
delighting its adherents and annoying those who decry the event's lack of 
contemporary relevance. 
</P>
<P>
In the pageant's 56th year, the grounds for the debate were never so clear as 
during the narration for the showing of "Spirits of the Chinese Pagoda," 
sculptures of legendary beings that watch over the rooftops of Chinese 
villages. 
</P>
<P>
No mention is made of the current repression in China, in which the Communist 
leadership is carrying out mass arrests of artists and film makers along with 
the usual political suspects. Instead, the Chinese art is presented in nearly 
timeless fashion, with narrator Thurl Ravenscroft noting, "As this Eastern land 
opens its doors to the West," the spirit-statues "bid welcome and offer their 
blessings to all." 
</P>
<P>
The brief historical reference is to China's previous opening to the West at 
the turn of the century. But given current events, the irony of that hopeful 
view is inescapable. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the pageant has either avoided the temptation to comment or -- 
as detractors have charged -- lacked the courage or imagination to do so. Its 
milieu is human diversity as recorded by the Monets; the Van Goghs; the 
Renoirs; the ancient Greek, Roman and Hindu sculptors, the "masters" whose 
works outlived the immediate. The thrust seems to be of eternal consequences, 
the things of the soul. The thread connecting all these, we are told by the 
narrator, is beauty, which requires of the viewer the ability to appreciate. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the pageant's nature -- the posing of live models for a minute or so 
in re-creations of artworks -- people are essential to the enterprise. You will 
not see a modern work on the order of "White Dot on Black Background" because 
it does not meet the pageant's twin criteria: It does not have people in it, 
nor is it beautiful to more than a handful of people who must explain why it is 
beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
In this sense, the pageant is a bald-faced thumb of the nose at the current art 
world, and at current philosophies that, in ratchet-like fashion, relegate 
human beings a notch lower every year in the cosmic scheme of things. 
</P>
<P>
Within the context of the pageant's history and mission, one would have to 
conclude that director Glen Eytchison succeeded this year as well as in any in 
conveying an appreciation of human diversity and beauty -- without controversy, 
or at least current controversy. 
</P>
<P>
The pageant opens with a nostalgic look at Laguna Beach's founding through a 
series of sepia-toned photos tracing the city's beginnings from a patchwork 
collection of shacks by the seaside in the 1880s to an artists' colony 
confident enough to put on its first Festival of Arts in the summer of 1933. 
The first pageant artwork ever presented was "Girl of the Golden West," in 
which Josie Durkem Rice, the original model for the 1914 Louis Betts painting, 
reprised her role. This was re-enacted this year, as were James McNeil 
Whistler's "My Mother," followed by Sir Thomas Lawrence's "Pinkie" and Sir 
Thomas Gainsborough's "Blue Boy," also mainstays of the early pageants. 
</P>
<P>
Then it is on to the current offerings, starting with Donna Schuster's 
sunshine-dappled "On the Veranda," followed by the guardian Chinese spirits, 
the Currier &amp; Ives' skating-pond paean "Winter Pastime," Maxfield Parrish's 
lush "Garden of Allah," Gaston Doin's lively "Carnival" and several other works 
before the first-act finale, a multiscene presentation and history of Hopi 
kachina dolls. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd-pleasing Hopi exhibit, which takes place on several spots on the 
hillsides around the Irvine Bowl as well as on the stage, employs a historical 
narrative and sound and lighting effects simulating a thunderstorm to tell the 
story of how the kachina dolls are used as spirit surrogates to ward off evil 
and to chastise wayward children. It all hangs together nicely. 
</P>
<P>
Other works presented range from an Etruscan fresco circa 480 BC to an ancient 
Egyptian necklace to Ken Auster's "Pier Shot," a 1988 watercolor depicting two 
surfers approaching the moment of truth in front of pilings at the Huntington 
Beach Pier. This last was not quite as well received as some of the others, 
perhaps because it lacks the detail characteristic of the early masters' works. 
It doesn't look as if it was as hard to bring off, and difficulty of execution 
is a criterion for eliciting oohs and ahs. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the pageant's overall lightness of mood, some of the works conceivably 
could be controversial, or thought-provoking, depending on the viewer's 
ideology. Louis Maurer's 1895 oil, "Great Royal Buffalo Hunt," depicts an 
Indian slaying a buffalo as Buffalo Bill Cody looks on as a co-conspirator. 
Animal-rights activists can't be happy about such a work presented in 
nonjudgmental or even approving fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Women are sent a mixed message at one point in the program. A Nepalese bronze, 
"Durga Slaying the Demon," recounts the epic battle when the Hindu goddess 
drives out an evil demon lord by magically changing her shape. In the 
incarnation at hand, she sports 18 arms. It is a stirring sight, and it could 
be a fitting symbol for the modern woman who is supposed to -- and often does 
-- do it all. But just as the females in the audience might be starting to hum 
"I am woman, hear me roar," the next work presented is "Conversation Plaisir," 
a 19th-Century painting by Victor Gabriel Gilbert that depicts a group of women 
quietly enjoying a day by the river -- doing laundry. 
</P>
<P>
Well, at least women are anything but under-represented in the pageant's works. 
And women get a break two presentations later with a male nude under glass, 
George Thompson and Tom Vincent's 1961 "Orpheus." This acts as a counterbalance 
for Robert Krantz's "Fantasy of Wings" earlier in the program, which features a 
naked young woman surrounded, but not obscured, by sea gulls. 
</P>
<P>
During the entire pageant, an orchestra fronted by music 
director-composer-conductor Richard Henn showed sprightly versatility in as 
eclectic a program of accompaniment as one could imagine. 
</P>
<P>
Also adding to the mood -- or, more appropriately, moods -- were anecdotes and 
quotes in the narration from commentators as disparate as Mark Twain ("I don't 
like work -- even if someone else does it"), James McNeil Whistler (who, when 
confronted by a student who had announced "I paint what I see," answered, "Yes, 
but the tragedy of this is when you see what you have painted") and current 
humorist Dave Barry (New York "is the only city in the country with an official 
arm gesture"). 
</P>
<P>
Lighthearted moments in the program were provided by the Tiffany Circus 
Collection, a colorful group of figurines of circus performers, and by the 
Victorian Valentines, a series of lacy, ornate paper cutouts that celebrate 
romantic love. 
</P>
<P>
Oops, there they go, trumpeting traditional values again. No wonder the cynics 
hate this pageant. Chaste romantic love is so uncool, don't you know, in an age 
of herpes, AIDS and palimony suits. And, of course, unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
Well, they haven't seen anything yet. 
</P>
<P>
The pageant delivers a coup de grace to cynicism in a finale that, while 
infused with Christian symbolism, transcends religious doctrines through a 
careful narrative. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1936, every pageant but one has ended with Leonardo da Vinci's "Last 
Supper." This year, the presentation is preceded by a quote from da Vinci, who 
explained his quest in painting Jesus' disciples this way: "There could be no 
greater challenge than to reflect the intent of a man's soul." 
</P>
<P>
At this point, confirmed cynics might be advised to close not only their eyes 
but also their ears, for the narration ends with the words of Saint Paul, who 
declared that the way of the righteous is to cling to "faith, hope and love." 
</P>
<P>
No, the pageant will probably never include "White Dot on Black Background," or 
"Keg O' Plastic Inner Tubes." 
</P>
<P>
But then, that's not what it's all about. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pageant of the Masters continues through Aug. 27 at the Irvine Bowl, 650 
Laguna Canyon Road, Laguna Beach. Show time: 8:30 nightly. Tickets: $9 to $35, 
including admission to the Laguna Beach Festival of Arts, an exhibition by 
local artists and crafts people that is running concurrently on the festival 
grounds. Admission to the festival only is $1 to $2. Information: (714) 
494-1145.

2 BAR BANDS BRING INTIMATE SUBSTANCE TO IRVINE MEADOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANISS GARZA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Great White and Tesla are basically bar bands with a little extra sparkle that 
they parlay into arena-status popularity. When the two rock bands played Irvine 
Meadows Amphitheatre on Saturday, they brought an intimate, party-down feel 
with them. 
</P>
<P>
The show was sold out, proving that the groups' teen-age audience knows the 
difference between substance and empty flash. 
</P>
<P>
The more experienced Great White, which has released three albums on Capitol 
and several independent LPs, received first billing. Singer Jack Russell 
provided the oomph to the hourlong set with his masculine strutting and 
blatantly sexual patter. While the L.A.-based quintet kept the energy fairly 
low key by hard-rock standards, the band exuded a warmth that drew in the 
enthusiastic crowd. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until the middle of the set, with its cover of Angel City's "Face 
the Day" that preceded such older numbers as "Rock Me," that Great White tapped 
the combination of smoky sexuality and brute force that is lacking in much of 
its current album, "Twice Shy." However, certain new songs -- notably the 
lewd-and-rude "Mista Bone" -- have an earthy appeal.

<P>
Co-headliner Tesla does not have the most scintillating presence either, but 
its musicianship and songwriting skills were solidly entertaining. The bluesy 
tunes give this Sacramento band an added edge. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Hannon provided wicked slide work on "No Way Out" from the quintet's 
current album, "The Great Radio Controversy." Tesla's other lead guitarist, 
Tommy Skeoch, threw some whirling hair and wild solos into the show. The 
smooth-moving Jeff Keith has the lanky appeal of a Steven Tyler and slightly 
ragged vocals that shine on numbers such as "Hang Tough" and "Little Suzi." 
</P>
<P>
Perpetual openers Kix started the show. With the punch and panache of its hard 
rock -- and an electric, irreverent vocalist in Steve Whiteman -- it's a 
mystery why this quintet cannot pull itself above third billing. 
</P>
<P>
The same bill was scheduled to play San Diego's Open Air Theatre on Sunday.

WEAR YOUR IMAGINARY DADA HAT FOR THIS SHOW

Yes, it's the painting from outer space -- the canvas that struck people dumb! 
When asked how he created it, the artist -- born on Mars and brought to Earth 
as a small child -- exclaimed, "It came to me in a blinding flash of light!" 
</P>
<P>
The sampling of Donald Bradford's mixed-media paintings at the Laguna Art 
Museum (through July 23) sometimes seems strange enough to inspire National 
Enquirer-type copy. Sure, you can easily identify the individual subjects in 
his works -- the people and objects. But that's not exactly the same thing as 
getting a handle on what is going on -- or why the artist uses a different 
style in each panel of his triptychs. 
</P>
<P>
Bradford, who was born in 1949 (in Yuma, Ariz.) and lives in San Francisco, 
seems to view the world with the deadpan humor of the TV generation. He has 
worked in video and performance art; the temporal distortions and bizarre 
imagery often present in those art forms are an integral part of his paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Most of them are based on biblical narratives (such as Jacob and the ladder) or 
the works of well-known artists (such as the Italian 17th-Century master 
Guercino or 20th-Century French painter Yves Klein). But Bradford does a number 
on his source material, transforming it into a slippery, disjunctive set of 
images pieced together rather like successive frames of a comic strip. 
</P>
<P>
All of which means that viewers of his work are expected to possess a degree of 
cultural literacy -- as well as the ability to make imaginative leaps. 
</P>
<P>
Several of Bradford's pieces come from his "Waiting for Godot" series, based on 
the Samuel Beckett play. Written in 1952, it has two main characters, hobos 
Vladimir and Estragon, who wait for someone named Godot. Although a boy appears 
at the end of each of the two acts to announce Godot's imminent appearance, he 
never shows up. 
</P>
<P>
The tramps' spare dialogue -- often quarrelsome, repetitious and disjointed -- 
is broken by odd bits of stage business, mostly having to do with the speakers' 
own boots and hats. The only other speaking characters are the whip-brandishing 
Pozzo and his slave, Lucky. 
</P>
<P>
"Godot" introduced a new, nonlinear kind of theater, mirroring the struggle to 
find meaning in the postwar world, a phenomenon closely identified with the 
existential philosophy of Jean-Paul Sartre. The play also incorporated the kind 
of rough-and-ready body language associated with vaudeville acts, locating 
essential truths within its amiable routines. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir and Estragon appear in the first panel of Bradford's "The Hat Makes 
the Man (After Max Ernst)," rendered in a precise, linear style and outfitted 
according to the artist's whim in mini-masks with fake cheeks and noses. 
Actually, the pair appear twice, as if observed at different moments during the 
bizarre exchange of hats in the second act of the play. 
</P>
<P>
Each pair of men has three hats -- Vladimir has also swiped Lucky's hat -- 
which makes their actions look especially ridiculous. There is a vaudeville 
quality about this silly activity, which goes on for several minutes. 
Essentially meaningless -- just a way of passing time -- the hat exchange also 
seems to have something to do with the notion of trying on another man's 
identity. 
</P>
<P>
The next panel of the painting is a borrowed image: a portion of a collage from 
1920 by the Dada artist Max Ernst, "It's the Hat That Makes the Man" -- a group 
of hats sandwiched between vertical abstract forms in higgledy-piggledy 
columns. The effect is almost like a molecular diagram, with hats absurdly 
replacing the molecules. Once again, the hat is viewed, absurdly, as the 
equivalent of the person who wears it. 
</P>
<P>
Born during World War I, the spirit of artistic Dada clowning was calculated to 
set a rigid and bellicose bourgeois society on its ear. In one of the most 
memorable Dada films, "Ghosts Before Breakfast" by German artist Hans Richter, 
there is an utterly delightful sequence about a wayward hat that leaves its 
fussy gentleman owner to go on a series of silly adventures. 
</P>
<P>
The third panel in Bradford's painting zeroes in on the three bowler hats -- 
now broadly painted, with exaggerated shadows -- stacked up on top of each 
other. The image does not appear to reflect any specific moment from "Godot." 
Instead, the pile-up of hats looks like a close-up from the end of a real 
vaudeville act -- like the expertly timed, harmonious resolution of a string of 
madcap confusions on a music hall stage. 
</P>
<P>
It is tempting to add that in vaudeville, there are neat, happy conclusions; in 
life, there usually aren't. We know that hats do not make the man, but we are 
hard-pressed to say what does. Whether Bradford intended viewers to draw such 
metaphysical conclusions from this painting, however, is difficult to say. 
</P>
<P>
But his stylistic shifts are all of a piece with the eclecticism of his vision, 
the way he glides from the vaudeville aspects in the play to the borrowed Dada 
image, then to a melding of Dada playfulness with the vaudeville image. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the incorporation of three distinctively different ways of 
portraying imagery deliberately calls attention to the way the painting is 
constructed. Bradford's ideal viewer is not a passive spectator, someone who 
enters the world of a painting in the same trusting way you curl up with an 
old-fashioned novel. Instead, he keeps you at a skeptical arm's length, never 
forgetting that you are looking at how someone's mind works and are obliged to 
cope with the parts that do not fit neatly together. 
</P>
<P>
You might say his paintings are like a succession of brief moments from a 
performance, separated by blackouts, or like clues in a mystery for which you 
have to provide the motivation and the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
"Donald Bradford: Selected Works" remains on view through July 23 at the Laguna 
Art Museum, 307 Cliff Drive, Laguna Beach. Hours are 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday 
through Sunday. Admission is $2 general, $1 for students and seniors.

PROSECUTORS SET TO THROW AWAY KEY ON SEX CRIMINAL

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five times Warren James Bland has been released from prison. Fives times he has 
been rearrested for terrorizing women and children in a series of sexual 
assaults in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
He last walked out of prison three years ago, but was soon back behind bars, 
charged with the torture-murder of a 7-year-old South Pasadena girl and held as 
a prime suspect in the slayings of a 14-year-old Placentia girl and an 
81-year-old San Diego woman. 
</P>
<P>
Now, after crimes that have spanned the last three decades, the government is 
saying "enough." 
</P>
<P>
The 53-year-old Bland was convicted this spring under the Armed Career Criminal 
Act, a relatively new federal statute that targets incorrigible offenders and 
removes them from society. Next month, if prosecutors are successful, Bland 
will become the first person in California and the fourth nationwide to receive 
the federal government's harshest punishment under the act. 
</P>
<P>
The government is asking that Bland spend the rest of his life in prison, with 
no chance of parole. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got gray hair," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Larry Burns in San Diego, 
describing the Jekyll-and-Hyde demeanor of Bland, who adapts well to prison 
life but repeatedly has attacked women and children. "He's got a Cherub-like 
face. He wears glasses. He looks like somebody's grandfather or uncle. He 
doesn't look menacing at all. He looks like any other John Doe you'd pass on 
the street." 
</P>
<P>
Bland has spent 23 of the last 28 years in prison. During those few years out, 
he has repeatedly been unable to resist the urge to hurt others. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he belongs in prison," said Jack Osborn of Placentia, whose only 
daughter was murdered at the age of 14 in a case in which Bland was a prime 
suspect, but never formally charged. 
</P>
<P>
Bland declined a request to be interviewed inside the Metropolitan Correctional 
Center here. 
</P>
<P>
His attorney, Judy Clarke, also declined to discuss the case. In legal papers 
filed with the court, she contended that the case is "selective and vindictive 
prosecution." 
</P>
<P>
"It is inconceivable that Mr. Bland is the first such individual in the 
Southern District of California whose prior record meets the elements for a 
prosecution under the Armed Career Criminal statute," she said in the court 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
Under the act, adopted by Congress in 1986, a defendant faces from 15 years to 
life in prison, with the maximum sentence including the proviso that "such 
person shall not be eligible for parole." 
</P>
<P>
The aim of the law is to remove from society those hard-core, repeat offenders 
who spend a lifetime committing crimes and reap the benefits of a judicial 
system that opens the door again and again. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Criminals Described 
</P>
<P>
In testimony before a House subcommittee on crime, Assistant Atty. Gen. Stephen 
Trott described the kind of people the law was designed to put away. 
</P>
<P>
"These are people who have demonstrated by virtue of their definition that 
locking them up and letting them go doesn't do any good," Trott said. "They go 
on again, you lock them up, you let them go, it doesn't do any good, they are 
back for a third time. 
</P>
<P>
"At that juncture, we should say, 'That's it, time out, it is all over. We as 
responsible people will never give you the opportunity to do this again.' " 
</P>
<P>
Burns, the federal prosecutor who is requesting the sentence for Bland, cited 
the three other cases in the country that have drawn the harshest penalty of 
life sentence with no parole. He said none of the other cases involved such a 
high degree of violence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Others Convicted 
</P>
<P>
Another 300 defendants convicted under the statute have received more than 
4,500 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
But Burns contends that the past cases appear relatively minor when placed next 
to Bland's criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
"By any measure," he said, "Warren Bland is a worse criminal." 
</P>
<P>
Bland grew up in Culver City, the second of two children of a maintenance man 
and a cleaning woman. He would have completed high school but dropped out weeks 
before graduation. 
</P>
<P>
He once told a probation officer that his father, Carl O'Dell Bland, beat him 
"excessively as a youngster," and then was closer to him as a teen-ager and 
young adult. 
</P>
<P>
About his mother, Hava K. Bland, and his string of problems with the law, Bland 
told a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge: 
</P>
<P>
"It was nothing more than really rebellion and against what I call a mother 
image. I was a very confused young man, very aggressive, and I had no pattern 
of life whatsoever to really base myself on." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tossed Out of Marines 
</P>
<P>
Bland grew to manhood, six feet and 190 pounds with blond hair and blue eyes. 
He joined the Marine Corps, but was tossed out for bad conduct after going 
AWOL. He worked as a painter and a machinist. He married three times, his last 
wife leaving him to move to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
He first answered for doing harm to others in 1958 when he was convicted of 
felony assault in Los Angeles for stabbing a man in the stomach. The man was 
drunk and talking to Bland's wife, and Bland took offense. 
</P>
<P>
He was given no prison time, and instead was granted five years' probation, a 
break that for Bland would keep repeating itself in the years to come. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the interest of justice, or society's interest, would be served 
by sending you to jail on this case," Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge 
Leroy Dawson told the defendant. "So you have a chance to stay out of jail." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sent to State Hospital 
</P>
<P>
That chance was short-lived. In 1960, he was convicted of rape and kidnaping in 
a series of sexual assaults on women in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Bland was sent to a state hospital, where he was examined and psychoanalyzed 
and deemed a "sexual psychopath." The hospital warned that if Bland "was 
released to society, he would be assaultive and/or homicidal toward women." 
</P>
<P>
But Bland assured a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge in 1966 that if 
released, "I don't feel I would have any further trouble." A 1967 probation 
report recommended he be given another chance, "in view of the defendant's 
complete change and attitude toward his problem." 
</P>
<P>
After seven years of treatment, he was back on the streets of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another Series of Attacks 
</P>
<P>
Less than a year later, another series of sexual attacks occurred. A 
schoolteacher was raped at knifepoint. A 31-year-old woman was awakened when a 
man's gloved hand reached through her bedroom window and covered her mouth. She 
was dragged out the window, into the back yard and was raped. 
</P>
<P>
Bland was once again before the bar of justice for the two crimes. He was 
convicted of rape, kidnaping and burglary. At his sentencing, a probation 
report was filed that said: "The defendant is clearly a dangerous individual 
who warrants segregation from society for the longest time that is possible 
under existing laws." 
</P>
<P>
He served seven years. He was paroled. And he struck again. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was an 11-year-old girl and her mother, who were accosted while 
walking down the street of a Los Angeles suburb. Both were molested; the girl 
was tortured. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Served Three Years 
</P>
<P>
Bland pleaded guilty to kidnaping and assault with intent to commit rape. He 
was sentenced to an indeterminate term in state prison. He served three years, 
then was paroled back into the community. 
</P>
<P>
The crimes continued, and Bland was back in jail within eight months, this time 
convicted of sexually assaulting an 11-year-old Torrance boy. The boy had been 
tortured with wire, clothespins, pliers and vice grips. Bland pleaded guilty 
and was sentenced to nine years. 
</P>
<P>
A 1981 California Department of Corrections summary on Bland noted his problems 
while free, as opposed to his congenial attitude while in prison. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Locked in Mortal Combat' 
</P>
<P>
"While in free society, Bland is always locked in mortal combat with his id, 
and the id invariably emerges victorious," the summary said. "While 
incarcerated, he no longer has to contend and he leaves the supervision of the 
id to others." 
</P>
<P>
Bland accumulated good-time and work-time credits in prison, which reduced the 
length of the sentence. After serving less than five of the nine years, he was 
paroled in January, 1986. And now the crimes in which he would be implicated 
got worse than ever. 
</P>
<P>
Phoebe Ho, 7, of South Pasadena disappeared while walking to school in 
December, 1986. Her body was later found in a Riverside County ditch. Wendy 
Osborn, 14, of Placentia in Orange County was found dead in the Chino Hills in 
February, 1987. Both girls had been sexually assaulted and apparently tortured 
with pliers or some other kind of clamp. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Potential Suspect 
</P>
<P>
Bland's probation officer, John Blum, listed Bland as a potential suspect 
because he "has an extensive sex-crimes background, which includes the 
molestation of children." 
</P>
<P>
A statewide manhunt was organized. Bland was found in San Diego, using an alias 
of James Sterling and working at a McDonald's restaurant in Pacific Beach. He 
was cornered by a San Diego police officer and was shot in the buttocks when he 
attempted to flee. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors in Riverside say they will seek the death penalty if Bland is 
convicted of Phoebe Ho's murder. Police in San Diego, meanwhile, consider him 
the prime suspect in the murder of 81-year-old Ruth M. Ost, found nude and 
strangled with her hands bound. However, no charges have been filed in that or 
the Osborn case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Extra Insurance' 
</P>
<P>
Even if Bland gets life with no parole in San Diego, Brian McCarville, a deputy 
Riverside County prosecutor, said he will still try Bland on the Phoebe Ho 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an extra insurance policy to keep him in prison," McCarville said. 
</P>
<P>
Burns, the federal prosecutor in San Diego, won an indictment against Bland 
under the Armed Career Criminal Act. That was last September, when it became 
obvious that the Riverside County case was moving slowly and that Bland might 
not be tried for years for the Phoebe Ho murder. 
</P>
<P>
A federal jury in San Diego last March weighed the evidence of whether Bland 
was indeed a career criminal. Burns said the jury deliberated 30 minutes and 
found Bland guilty. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving scheduled Aug. 9 as the day 
to announce whether the prison door will slam for good on Bland. 
</P>
<P>
In his sentencing memorandum asking the judge to order Bland to prison for the 
rest of his life, Burns noted that the U.S. Probation Department concurred in 
that recommendation. The prosecutor wrote that "Bland has been like a plague on 
our free society for too long."

President Bush announced a U.S. aid plan for Poland today, telling Poles their 
democratic reforms could usher in an era of stability in Europe and had 
Washington's full support. 
</P>
<P>
"Poland is where the Cold War began -- and now the people of Poland can help 
bring the division of Europe to an end," he said in an address to the newly 
elected Polish Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
He said he would ask the U.S. Congress for $100 million to promote private 
enterprise in Poland and $15 million for a joint U.S.-Poland environmental 
project, and seek World Bank approval for $325 million in loans for Poland. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Postpone Debt Payments 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said he would ask other industrial countries to postpone Polish 
debt payments of $5 billion this year. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Polish Foreign Minister 
Tadeusz Olechowski signed agreements deferring repayments of $1 billion in 
overdue debt to U.S. government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Payments that were due in 1985 and over a three-year period beginning in 1986 
will be deferred for five years. The bulk of the money is owed to the Commodity 
Credit Corp. and the Export-Import Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who was greeted by a two-minute standing ovation, said the world was 
watching with admiration the reforms taking place in Poland and its Warsaw Pact 
ally Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
"By creating political structures legitimized by popular will, your reforms can 
be the foundation of stability, security and prosperity -- not just here, but 
in all of Europe," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Huge Economic Problems 
</P>
<P>
He noted that Poland, burdened by a $39-billion foreign debt, faced huge 
economic problems whose solution will require sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
"But I want to stress to you today that Poland is not alone. Given the enormity 
of this moment, the United States stands ready to help you as you help 
yourselves," he said.

The B-2 stealth bomber moved under its own power for the first time today, 
emerging from its super-secret research hangar and rolling out onto a desert 
runway. 
</P>
<P>
The sleek, bat-like bomber, the most advanced in the Pentagon's arsenal and 
capable of penetrating enemy radar defenses without being detected, taxied onto 
the runway shortly after sunrise and began a series of engine tests at various 
power settings. As the tests began, the engines changed in pitch from an eerie 
whistle to a low roar. The aircraft then moved from a station near its secure 
hangar at about 10 m.p.h. for about two miles down the runway at Air Force 
Plant 42. 
</P>
<P>
For about two hours the sinister-looking bomber was put through its engine 
tests, then moved to the far end of the runway adjacent to Sierra Highway, 
where it was visible to passing traffic. 
</P>
<P>
After the low-speed taxi tests, the plane will make high-speed taxi tests and 
then make its maiden flight sometime within the next two weeks.

10 HURT, 7 BUILDINGS LOST IN BANNING JAIL RIOT, FIRE

<P>
A riot that injured 10 people and engulfed a rural Riverside County jail 
compound in flames erupted after Latino inmates taunted and hurled rocks at a 
group of black prisoners assembled outside a dormitory, a sheriff's spokesman 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
Guards attempting to quell the fracas at the Banning Rehabilitation and 
Counseling Center were overwhelmed as the fighting quickly spread throughout 
the facility and were forced to retreat until reinforcements arrived. 
</P>
<P>
The rioting, which involved hundreds of screaming inmates who broke windows, 
set fires and threw rocks and other debris at guards and each other, lasted 
several hours. It was declared under control shortly after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the violence, county firefighters were prevented for 30 minutes from 
tackling several blazes at the 40-acre facility. There were no reported 
escapes. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears the inmates just seized an opportunity," sheriff's Lt. Kim 
Garthwaite said. "After the initial confrontation, things just escalated." 
</P>
<P>
Eight inmates suffered minor injuries and smoke inhalation during the melee, 
but none required hospitalization. Two correctional officers also were injured 
and treated at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Flames destroyed seven buildings, including the facility's kitchen, commissary 
and an administration unit where some inmate records were kept. Several 
vehicles also were burned or damaged by rocks and other debris. 
</P>
<P>
Garthwaite called the riot, which erupted shortly after 9 p.m. and drew large 
crowds of onlookers, the worst in the county's history. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby residents agreed. "It was bad," said Beverly Feyer, whose home is about 
100 yards from the jail entrance. "We heard screaming, cheering, windows 
breaking. Then we saw the flames. You start to get a little nervous with them 
right in your backyard." 
</P>
<P>
The low-security center, located just south of Interstate 10 off the road to 
Idyllwild, houses minimum- and medium-security inmates. It has 784 beds and had 
a population of 766 monitored by 12 guards Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Garthwaite said racial conflicts have occurred previously at the facility, but 
there were no confrontations earlier Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
To defuse tensions while clean-up efforts continue, officials today transferred 
about half of the jail's inmates to other facilities in Riverside and San 
Bernardino counties.

PERES THREAT TO BOLT ISRAEL CABINET TOUCHES OFF CRISIS; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR HITS SHAMIR ON PLO PEACE

<P>
Israel's government was thrown into crisis today when senior leaders of the 
left-leaning Labor Party voted to recommend leaving the coalition Cabinet, a 
move that could force new national elections. 
</P>
<P>
Labor's Leadership Bureau adopted a proposal, which now goes to the party's 
decision-making Central Committee, that accuses Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir 
of derailing efforts to end the Palestinian uprising with tough, new conditions 
set by his Likud Party, Labor's coalition partner. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no room under these circumstances for the continuation of the 
government," said Finance Minister Shimon Peres, the Labor chairman, as he 
recommended pulling out of the Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
His colleagues applauded loudly and passed his proposal 45 to 2, with six 
abstentions. 
</P>
<P>
Labor legislators underscored their anger at Likud by resolving to walk out 
later today when Parliament votes on five motions of no-confidence in the 
government by left-wing parties. 
</P>
<P>
It was the most serious crisis since the government was formed in December 
after weeks of negotiations with small religious parties. The Tel Aviv stock 
market dropped 4% in value on news of the decision. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Room to Maneuver 
</P>
<P>
But Labor leaders gave themselves room to maneuver, hinting they might not 
withdraw if real progress is made in efforts to arrange peace negotiations with 
Palestinians before the meeting of the 1,350-member Central Committee in the 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
Labor and Likud, which have ruled jointly since the 1984 elections ended in 
virtual deadlock, have survived a number of crises over ideological issues. 
</P>
<P>
In Warsaw, U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III, traveling with President 
Bush, today said he will send an emissary to the Middle East to test Israel's 
commitment to holding elections among Palestinian Arabs on the West Bank and in 
Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
The emissary, Baker said, will "determine the extent to which the Israeli 
government is still committed to their election proposals in the aftermath of 
the Likud Party convention." 
</P>
<P>
Baker did not say whom he would send to Israel next week, but added that 
reports that it would be Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger could 
be mistaken. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sparks Likud Anger 
</P>
<P>
The Labor leadership's decision to recommend leaving the coalition sparked 
anger in Likud. Shamir called Labor's vote "a mistaken decision" and said 
dissolving the Cabinet will leave "no choice than to hold early elections which 
are not needed by the country at this moment." 
</P>
<P>
The statement also accused Labor of "playing into the hands of the Arabs . . . 
and relieving the Arabs of any need to respond to the peace initiative." The 
PLO has so far rejected the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Peres, the government's vice premier, argued in a fiery 35-minute speech that 
Likud's stance torpedoes the peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
Peres especially criticized Likud's demand that the proposed elections be 
postponed until the Palestinian uprising is ended. 
</P>
<P>
"What does that mean? Granting veto power to all the extremists in the 
territories. We shouldn't block negotiations just because the terrorists don't 
want them," Peres shouted.

HALF-CENT SALES TAX HIKE TO GO ON NOV. 7 O.C. BALLOT; 
</P>
<P>
$3.1 BILLION SOUGHT FOR TRAFFIC PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing an unprecedented traffic crisis, the Orange County Transportation 
Commission voted 6 to 0 today to place a countywide half-cent sales tax for 
highway and transit projects on the Nov. 7 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The tax would raise $3.1 billion for a far-reaching, $11.6-billion plan to 
speed traffic with wider freeways, additional car-pool lanes, "super streets" 
and commuter rail service. About $8.4 billion for the 20-year plan would come 
from existing sources, such as the state and federal governments. 
</P>
<P>
The tax would cost each Orange County consumer an estimated $50 to $75 per 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Today's decision came a day after The Times Orange County Poll showed that 
public support for the sales tax hike -- from the current 6% to 6 1/2% -- has 
slipped to 48% from 54% about 11 months ago, with 46% now against the measure 
and the rest undecided. The margin of error was 4%. 
</P>
<P>
Still, commissioners said that they want a Nov. 7 special election to avoid 
confusing voters with Gov. George Deukmejian's proposed state gasoline tax 
increase, scheduled for the June, 1990, ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the people of Orange County are willing to wait any longer," 
said Commission member Dana W. Reed, referring to the 20-year plan. "The wheels 
of government turn too slowly as it is." 
</P>
<P>
Commission Vice Chairman Richard B. Edgar added: "Some may say this is not 
perfect. . . . But we've reached a consensus. Let's put our shoulders to the 
wheel and get this thing done." 
</P>
<P>
Several members of the audience rose to criticize the 20-year plan's partial 
reliance on additional car-pool lanes, prompting Commission Chairman Thomas F. 
Riley to respond sarcastically at one point: "Thanks for your vote of 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Frustrated by Complaints 
</P>
<P>
Later, Riley said he is frustrated by various constituencies focusing so much 
on specific complaints without seeing the "whole regional picture." 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, the commission must vote again in two weeks to approve the 
Nov. 7 election date. The Board of Supervisors has until Aug. 8 to ask 
Registrar of Voters Don Tanney to include the sales tax measure in the printing 
of the ballots. 
</P>
<P>
The sales tax plan will occupy 23 pages of a voter information booklet, 
according to Tanney. 
</P>
<P>
Without the extra $3.1 billion, officials say, there will be sufficient money 
for only 80% of the $1.5-billion Santa Ana Freeway widening project, 60% of 
planned local street projects and maintenance of existing transit service at 
current ridership levels. Construction of three planned tollways in eastern and 
southern Orange County would be paid for with developer fees and bond sales. 
</P>
<P>
Tanney estimated that it will cost up to $1.2 million to hold the special sales 
tax election. He said that nine school districts and eight special service 
districts will have elections the same day, involving 50% to 60% of the 
county's eligible voters. 
</P>
<P>
Turnout, said Tanney, probably would be only 12% to 20% in the special 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, the Transportation Commission would pay the cost of a 
successful election. County government would pay the cost of a failed election.

One firefighter battling an arson blaze near Big Sur died instantly when a tree

of Forestry officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred Sunday night when a 7-member crew from the California 
Department of Corrections was building a fire line, said CDF spokeswoman Lynda 
Parks. The victims were evacuated by ambulance and two military helicopters, 
she said.

The Food and Drug Administration said today that a series of products sold as 
aphrodisiacs did nothing to help sexual desire or performance and banned them 
from the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
The ingredients claimed to be aphrodisiacs and affected by the agency ban 
include cantharides, also known as "Spanish fly," a chemical derived from the 
dried bodies of beetles; zinc, a metal; estrogens, a female hormone; 
strychnine, a poisonous white powder, and yohimbine, a poison obtained from the 
bark of a West African tree. 
</P>
<P>
Other ingredients claimed to arouse sexual desire or improve performance that 
fall under the FDA ban are fennel, mandrake and ginseng, which are plants, the 
agency said. 
</P>
<P>
The ban will take effect Jan. 8, 1990. The FDA said relatively few of these 
products are now being marketed.

New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, reopening a door that he closed last year, said 
today that as a public servant he is "obliged to be open to the possibility" of 
running for President. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, you have to be open," said Cuomo in an appearance before the New 
York State Broadcasters Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the New York Democrat said all such talk about his political 
future is speculative. Cuomo was widely expected to run for President in 1988 
but decided against it. 
</P>
<P>
Cuomo has said that he expects to run for reelection as governor next year. In 
his speech today, he reiterated that he does not believe that a person can run 
for President while serving as governor. Cuomo also said, as he did in 1987, 
that the Democratic Party will be able to find excellent candidates for the 
presidency in 1992 without turning to him.

President Bush stumbled today when he tried to pronounce a tongue-twisting 
Polish surname, but linguists rated his attempt superior to former President 
Ronald Reagan's efforts in Russian. 
</P>
<P>
Before delivering a speech at the Polish Parliament, Bush turned to greet 
Senate Speaker Andrzej Stelmachowski. He pronounced the third syllable of the 
name chow, as if it rhymed with now. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, in Polish the syllable is pronounced hoff. 
</P>
<P>
Poles watching Bush on live television noticed the slip but said it was a 
forgivable error and Bush's meaning was clear. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan, Bush's predecessor, delighted in reciting Russian proverbs to Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev when they met at summits. However, Reagan's 
pronunciation was so thick that neither Gorbachev nor his wife, Raisa, ever 
seemed to understand. 
</P>
<P>
Poland proved embarrassing linguistic territory for former President Jimmy 
Carter in a 1977 visit to Warsaw when his interpreter mistranslated several 
bland presidential remarks. Among other gaffes, he had Carter saying that he 
wanted to learn of the carnal desires of Poles and that he had just abandoned 
the United States.

Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp promised today that an 
investigation into abuses in HUD programs won't be used as an excuse to gut 
housing subsidies for low- and moderate-income Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp, in a speech to the annual convention of the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People, also praised the role of the NAACP in extending 
the American dream to blacks. 
</P>
<P>
The NAACP, he said, has been the central mover in a two-step process to win 
equality for minorities. He said the process is half finished. 
</P>
<P>
"Chapter One is a proud part of our country's history," the housing secretary 
said. But he said the United States cannot effectively promote its system as a 
model for the world until it finishes the next stage -- achieving equal 
economic opportunity as well. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp received three standing ovations from the audience of 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
He vowed to root out all corruption from every level of his scandal-ridden 
agency and make its programs "work for the people in need, not those motivated 
by greed." 
</P>
<P>
He said he is committed to ending all housing bias and red-lining by lenders, 
and to work for revitalization of inner city neighborhoods, higher earned 
income tax credit for the poor and accelerated economic development in the 
black community. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Reform Top to Bottom' 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to reform HUD from top to bottom," Kemp said. "We are going to 
make our programs work for the people in need, not those motivated by greed. 
I'm not going to allow it to be used as an excuse to close down the programs. 
It's not going to prevent us from doing the thing we need to do, provide 
housing." 
</P>
<P>
Congress is investigating accusations of HUD fraud, mismanagement and 
favoritism. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp used the meeting in Detroit, where a Detroit Free Press series has 
spotlighted more than 15,000 abandoned buildings, to announce planning for a 
massive new urban cleanup campaign suggested by NAACP Executive Director 
Benjamin L. Hooks. 
</P>
<P>
"Take those 15,000 homes and bring them back into the housing stock of 
Detroit," Kemp said. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp said Hooks came to his office several days ago to talk about a national 
version of the "clean-up, paint-up, fix-up" programs common to many 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I agreed that we should start working with Ben Hooks to make this a 
national project, and right now, I am announcing that the planning for this 
program will start immediately," Kemp said.

A group led by U.S. corporate financiers Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co. said 
today it has made a friendly $3.48-billion cash offer for Gateway Corp. PLC in 
what would be Europe's largest leveraged buyout. 
</P>
<P>
The group, which also includes Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. and is 
known as Newgateway PLC, said it had gained control of 30.04% of the British 
food retailer following a market raid on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Gateway also is the target of a hostile $3.32-billion cash bid from Isosceles 
PLC, a company formed by disgruntled institutional shareholders in Gateway. 
Isosceles last reported controlling about 41% of Gateway's shares. 
</P>
<P>
Newgateway said it acquired a 19.66% stake on the open market, raising the 
total number of shares under its control to 267.8 million. Friday's purchases 
were made at $3.92 a share. 
</P>
<P>
This afternoon, Gateway shares were unchanged at $3.89 on London's Stock 
Exchange.

McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. said today it had lowered its bid for LIN 
Broadcasting Corp. to $110 from $120 a share after a court decision that 
rejected LIN's claim it had the right to buy cellular telephone interests in 
two key markets. 
</P>
<P>
The current bid would value LIN at just under $6 billion, about $500 million 
lower than its earlier $6.5-billion offer. 
</P>
<P>
McCaw, the country's largest cellular telephone service company, also said its 
tender offer for New York-based LIN had been extended one day to midnight July 
21. All other terms and conditions of the offer remain unchanged, it said.

UAL Corp.'s stock jumped today, extending a string of recent gains on 
persistent Wall Street speculation the owner of United Airlines may become a 
takeover target. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said traders are betting a raider like Texas billionaire 
Robert Bass or Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis may be interested in UAL, 
which owns valuable air routes across the Pacific and other assets not fully 
reflected in its stock price. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago-based UAL's stock rose $4.50 to $170.50 on heavy volume of over 713,000 
shares by 1 p.m. The stock rose $19 in active trading Thursday and Friday.

The Knicks hired Stu Jackson as head coach of the team today, ignoring 
questions about his inexperience. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, 33, a Knicks assistant under Rick Pitino the last two years, has not 
had a previous head coaching job at any level. He is now the youngest coach in 
the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's inexperience will be offset by two assistants with acknowledged 
skills in dealing with players -- Paul Silas and Ernie Grunfeld. Silas is a 
former coach of the San Diego Clippers and a star forward for the Hawks, 
Celtics and SuperSonics. Grunfeld was the team's radio analyst the last two 
seasons after retiring as a Knicks player.

LEMOND STILL OUT FRONT IN CYCLING RACE

<P>
Greg LeMond of the United States held his lead today after the first tough 
mountain stage of the Tour de France cycling race, sticking with the other 
leaders in a roller-coaster ride. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond finished eighth for the day, almost two minutes behind Miguel Indurain 
of Spain, who won the stage in 4 hours, 32 minutes and 36 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
But he was right on the wheel of two-time winner Laurent Fignon of France, who 
finished seventh in the same time as LeMond and remained in second place 
overall, five seconds back. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's winner, Pedro Delgado of Spain, finished third in today's 91-mile 
course over four steep mountain climbs but picked up only 29 seconds on LeMond, 
not nearly enough to catch him. 
</P>
<P>
Several other serious contenders also ended today's stage in a tight group 
around LeMond, including Sean Kelly of Ireland, Stephen Rooks of the 
Netherlands and Charly Mottet of France, all within seconds of one another. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Hampsten of the United States was 14th, 2:28 back of Indurain, and lost 
half a minute to LeMond in the overall standings. 
</P>
<P>
Another rugged mountain ride awaits the cyclists Tuesday, taking them 85 miles 
from Cauterets to Luchon-Superbagneres.

YUGOLAVS WANT DEFECTIONS TO NBA STOPPED

<TEXT>
<P>
Yugoslavia's basketball officials appealed to clubs to stop allowing their top 
players to sign contracts in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the state Tanjug news agency today, the Basketball 
Union of Yugoslavia called on the local clubs to be more selective when 
allowing their players to join the NBA, "or our basketball is faced with 
irreparable loss." 
</P>
<P>
The statement by the basketball authorities said the National Basketball Assn. 
must respect contracts between players and their Yugoslav clubs so the "further 
progress of the Yugoslav basketball is ensured." 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a catastrophe for our basketball if the Yugoslav federation does 
not urgently adopt a ruling that would prevent players younger than 26 from 
signing with the NBA teams," Bozidar Maljkovic, who coaches the leading 
Yugoplastika club, said recently. 
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav players, who recently won the European basketball championships and 
lost to the Soviet Union in last year's Olympic finals, have been a constant 
target for recruitment by several NBA teams in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
There is no current ruling by the Yugoslav sports authorities that would 
prevent them from turning pro in the United States, although most of them have 
signed contracts with Yugoslav teams. 
</P>
<P>
Vlade Divac, 21, a center on Yugoslavia's national selection squad who was 
drafted this season by the Lakers, said he is going to sign with the NBA team 
this summer because his Yugoslav club, Partizan, has given him permission to 
go.
