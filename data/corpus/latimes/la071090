CRACKDOWN ON EMPLOYERS OF MIGRANTS BEGINS IN ENCINITAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A team of U.S. Border Patrol agents Monday began a monthlong surveillance of 
migrant-related hiring on the streets of Encinitas to ensure that would-be 
employers follow federal law by checking a laborer's immigration status before 
putting him to work. 
</P>
<P>
The operation is part of a larger crackdown of the living and working 
conditions of local migrant laborers from Mexico and Central America that will 
also involve the county Sheriff's Department, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Later this week, sheriff's deputies will begin a sweep of migrant campsites and 
popular hiring spots, looking for such infractions as trespassing, littering, 
urinating in public and illegal camping, Sheriff's Capt. Bob Apostoles said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials applauded the stepped-up patrols, and said the crackdown is not 
intended to circumvent a federal judge's ruling last month against a curbside 
hiring ban the city approved in May. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, officials said Monday, Encinitas is prepared to drop its defense 
of the hiring ban in court and eventually repeal the law. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, U.S. District Judge John S. Rhoades issued a temporary restraining 
order against the ban, which would have outlawed all curbside hiring on city 
streets, saying it is probably unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
Rhoades has set a review hearing for Friday in federal court for the city and 
lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union and a migrants group, which 
have filed suit over the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"This is by no means an attempt to pull the rug out from a judge's order," 
Mayor Pam Slater said of the new crackdown. "The curbside ban would have made 
it illegal for all hiring on city streets. This enforcement is saying to 
employers, 'You can hire workers here, but you better be playing by the rules.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
The patrols, she said, are merely a response by the federal government and 
local law enforcement officials to the city's appeals for help with its migrant 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been saying all along that our city is in a state of emergency with all 
these indigent migrant workers, and that the federal government wasn't doing 
its part to help us with our problem," she said. "These patrols are a response 
to that, and we welcome them with open arms." 
</P>
<P>
But, although they've been successful in soliciting federal help for the 
migrant crisis, city officials will have to go back to the drawing board to 
devise an ordinance to stem the spread of what they call the "bothersome" 
curbside hiring. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Roger Krauel said Monday that he will meet privately with City 
Council members before Wednesday's meeting and advise them to scrap the ban. 
</P>
<P>
"My recommendation will be that they repeal the law based on the thoroughness 
of the judge's evaluation of the ordinance," he said. "I'm not happy with the 
way he analyzed it. But it was certainly instructive." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the apparent defeat of the ban, which would have imposed fines on 
employers who solicited day labor in public, the ordinance seemed like a good 
idea when approved by the council in May, Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew the law wasn't bulletproof, but we figured we were following federal 
laws by targeting the employer," she said. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, however, the focus of the Encinitas migrant debate was out of the 
courtroom and council chambers and back on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning shortly after 6 a.m., three uniformed Border Patrol agents driving 
marked patrol cars talked with 35 would-be employers, handing out pamphlets 
detailing what immigration laws require of them when soliciting migrant 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
Of those, 10 were given warnings for not properly inspecting worker 
documentation, resulting in the arrest of 20 undocumented laborers who were in 
the country illegally, said Dutch Steenbakker, special agent in charge of the 
Border Patrol's North County patrols. 
</P>
<P>
Officials stressed Monday that neither the crackdown nor the teaming up of the 
two agencies is anything new, but rather the continuation of an occasional 
practice last put into effect last summer. 
</P>
<P>
The operation came in response to a letter sent to the Border Patrol by 
Encinitas officials last week. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd met with them in the past and asked for more patrols," said City Manager 
Warren Shafer. "The letter was just a way to put our request in writing." 
</P>
<P>
Steenbakker said he also became concerned last month while personally watching 
hiring activities in Encinitas over a two-week period in which he found less 
than half of employers checking for worker documentation. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked with some employers who were pretty candid once they realized I 
wasn't going to ticket them," he said. "When I told them about the hiring hall, 
they said they didn't go there because they didn't want to pay minimum wage, or 
had jobs where they didn't want to follow OSHA requirements, so they went 
curbside to avoid all that. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard some real horror stories, including one worker who worked an 
eight-hour day for just $8. There's a lot of abuse going on out there." 
</P>
<P>
The target of the sweep, Steenbakker said, is not the "casual hirers," 
homeowners who solicit migrant laborers for a one-day job, but companies and 
others who use the workers for more than eight hours without first checking 
documentation and filing the required paper work. 
</P>
<P>
However, Border Patrol agents in the past have lectured day-job employers of 
their responsibilities when soliciting migrant workers, said Claudia Smith, an 
attorney for California Rural Legal Assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Smith sent Border Patrol officials in San Diego a letter reminding 
them that federal employer sanctions regarding migrant workers do not apply to 
casual employment on an occasional basis in a domestic situation such as 
baby-sitting or gardening. 
</P>
<P>
Teddy Hampton, assistant special agent in charge of the Border Patrol's North 
County operation, said Monday's enforcement approach was simple. 
</P>
<P>
"We sit in patrol cars in plain sight and just watch what happens," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If an employer asks for documentation, he's got no problem with us. If he 
doesn't, we have a talk with him. Repeat offenders could risk a fine and 
seizure of their vehicle."

COSMETIC SURGERIES ILLEGAL, MILITARY LAWYER SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: GUIDELINES EXPECTED TO BE TIGHTENED IN WAKE OF OPERATIONS BY DOCTORS 
AT SAN DIEGO NAVAL HOSPITAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A high-ranking Pentagon lawyer has concluded that military hospitals that 
perform elective cosmetic surgeries are violating a 1979 law prohibiting 
operations that are medically unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported last month that military doctors worldwide were performing 
hundreds of cosmetic surgeries at taxpayer's expense, even though such 
surgeries are rarely covered by private health insurance or military health 
insurance, called CHAMPUS. 
</P>
<P>
Military officials say they expect regulations will be tightened as a result of 
the Pentagon legal review, significantly reducing the numbers of cosmetic 
surgeries, including liposuctions and nose jobs, that are performed. 
</P>
<P>
Although acknowledging that the language of a 1979 law is not entirely clear, 
Department of Defense Assistant General Counsel Robert L. Gilliat said, "The 
law prohibits the general provision of elective cosmetic surgery -- there is 
some interpretation." 
</P>
<P>
In a memo dated July 5, Gilliat wrote that the "better interpretation of the 
current statutory restriction would exclude many of the cosmetic surgeries now 
being performed." 
</P>
<P>
This memo, prompted by newspaper reports of the cosmetic surgeries, is being 
reviewed by the Department of Defense's Health Affairs Office, which will 
determine whether to change existing regulations. Another Washington official, 
who declined to be named, said a decision was expected this week. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego alone, 544 cosmetic surgeries were performed at the Naval Hospital 
during the past two years. Hospital officials have defended these operations, 
saying that they enable plastic surgeons to hone and maintain their skills. And 
they say, such surgeries allow young doctors to pass their certification 
examinations and are conducted only when more pressing medical cases have been 
tended. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, cosmetic surgeries represent 12% of all plastic surgeries 
performed and 6% of all surgeries performed by the hospital's ophthalmologist 
and ear, nose and throat doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, 2,354 breast augmentations, nose jobs, tummy tucks and other 
surgeries were performed in 1989, according to statistics recently released 
from the Navy. But spokeswoman Liz Noland said only 210 were conducted for 
purely cosmetic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I still feel cosmetic surgery has a valid role to play in our teaching 
hospital," said Rear Adm. Robert Halder, commanding officer of the hospital, 
which has three plastic surgeons on its staff. Halder said he was unaware of 
any new policy but added: "I will await further guidance. I don't want to 
speculate on what they are going to say. When my boss gives me orders, I follow 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The Army's 22 plastic surgeons and the Air Force's eight also do aesthetic 
operations. In an effort to evaluate the cosmetic surgery programs, Dr. Enrique 
Mendez, assistant defense secretary for health affairs, recently held meetings 
with top-ranking medical officers from the Army, Navy and Air Force, sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The surgeries are performed on active duty and retired military personnel and 
their families. In San Diego, active duty personnel are given priority over 
other individuals, Halder said. These surgeries, however, are specifically 
prohibited by Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
In the civilian world, face lifts can cost as much as $6,000; hair replacements 
and tummy tucks can cost up to $5,000; and breast augmentation goes for about 
$2,500, according to the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive 
Surgeons. 
</P>
<P>
Some military personnel say cost is a factor when they opt for surgery. One San 
Diego banker, whose husband is in the Navy, said she had her breasts enlarged 
because the operation was free. "Otherwise, I wouldn't have done it," said the 
30-year-old woman, who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the elective cosmetic surgery say taxpayers should not pay for 
military personnel to improve their faces and physiques at a time when the 
government is trying to decrease military spending. 
</P>
<P>
"It's inappropriate to spend taxpayers' dollars on medical operations that 
essentially are designed to allow people to be more stylish rather than to 
provide real substantive medical benefits," Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Coronado) had 
told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
And some in the military said they are angry that active-duty personnel 
sometimes stay out of work from several days to several weeks as they 
recuperate from beauty-enhancing surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"Is this truly a valid reason to miss work? I don't think so," said one 
official, who requested anonymity and added that he had lost a staff member for 
seven weeks while the woman recuperated from an aesthetic jaw surgery. 
</P>
<P>
But patients who have undergone cosmetic surgery defend the practice, saying it 
is small compensation for the rigors and poor pay of military life. 
</P>
<P>
Former Lt. Cmdr. Merlin Bitzer, who left the military in January after 15 years 
of service, had bags removed from his eyes. And, two years ago, his son, Chad, 
had his ears operated on so they would not stick out. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't expect plastic surgeons to just be there for the real bad stuff. You 
are paying the guy to be there, but when they have extra time, they need to 
keep up their skills," Bitzer said. "The more work they do, the better they 
become."

ANTI-SEMITISM TARGET GOES TO COURT TO MAKE VANDALS PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the morning of Nov. 13, 1988, Adele Goldberg got up and walked outside, only 
to find, spray-painted on the door of her garage, a large, crude, anti-Semitic 
graffito framed by swastikas. 
</P>
<P>
In the year and a half since, Goldberg, 31, said, life just hasn't been the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
"The fear has been the worst," she said Monday. "And I've kind of condemned 
myself for being Jewish. I've had to work hard . . . not to blame myself for 
being Jewish." 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg's San Carlos residence was vandalized in the same attack that did 
$5,000 worth of damage to the Tifereth Israel Synagogue, the walls of which 
were covered with such slogans as "Adolph (sic) Hitler Lives," "America Befor 
(sic) Israel" and "Love Skinheads." 
</P>
<P>
About a year after the attack, Goldberg filed a $4-million lawsuit against the 
six minors who perpetrated the act -- including the 16-year-old from Los 
Angeles who guided them -- and the parents or guardians of all of those 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
One of the six and her parents recently settled out of court, paying Goldberg 
$35,000, according to court documents. But no settlement has been reached with 
the other five, and Goldberg's attorney, Jeffrey S. Schwartz, said he and his 
client are determined to take the matter to trial, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have to take it to a jury, we will," Schwartz said. "It's in the 
interests of all of the parties to resolve it without that. Adele doesn't want 
to relive it, but, if we have to go to trial, we will. Justice will be done." 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz labeled as "insufficient and inadequate" the punishment meted out by 
the Juvenile Court, which asked the five San Diego minors to perform "a few 
hours of community service" and pay restitution ranging from $20 to $25 per 
defendant. The 16-year-old ringleader from the San Fernando Valley community of 
Chatsworth was ordered to perform 200 hours of community service and pay $135 
in restitution. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg said that "just doesn't cover" the damage she suffered, not just to 
her home but to her mind as well. 
</P>
<P>
In court documents filed a month ago, she listed medical expenses related to 
the incident at $7,118. She said she has seen a therapist at least once a week 
since November, 1988, and is taking a prescribed medication of 
anti-depressants. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz said the lawsuit is noteworthy in terms of what it symbolizes. He said 
that, in other areas of the nation as well, the targets of anti-Semitic attacks 
and other so-called "hate" crimes, are turning in ever-increasing numbers to 
civil courts as the method of fighting back. 
</P>
<P>
He conceded that part of the motive in the Goldberg case is "to set an example, 
to show that such acts will not be tolerated." 
</P>
<P>
Morris Casuto, local head of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, said 
victims of hate crimes are turning to civil courts as a way "of seeking 
appropriate redress," given what he said are the shortcomings of the penal 
system in addressing such matters, particularly when it pertains to juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
Casuto said the trend is having an impact nationally in curbing the incidence 
of hate crimes and dampening the activities of Skinheads in general. 
</P>
<P>
Casuto said the Anti-Defamation League is one of several plaintiffs 
representing the estate of an Ethiopian immigrant allegedly beaten to death by 
Skinheads in Portland, Ore., in 1988. The defendants in that case include Tom 
Metzger, the Fallbrook TV repairman who heads the White Aryan Resistance, and 
his son, John Metzger, widely regarded as a Skinhead leader nationally. 
</P>
<P>
Casuto said a new report by the ADL on Skinheads notes a distinct "flattening 
out" in membership, as well as a "slight diminution of violent acts." 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz said he had yet to establish a link between the defendants in 
Goldberg's case to Tom Metzger, John Metzger or the White Aryan Resistance. 
However, Schwartz pointed out that several defendants dressed and wore their 
hair in a manner befitting Skinheads -- that is, with shaved heads, "burr" or 
spiked haircuts, and black, heavily bejeweled clothing. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Liker, the attorney for the female defendant who recently settled with 
Goldberg, said one of the six involved in the incident, the only member of the 
group not from San Diego, was a Skinhead, in ideology as well as clothing. 
</P>
<P>
"My client was not involved with the Skinhead movement at all," Liker said. "As 
for the other female defendants, I would call theirs more a case of 
youth-rebellion fashion than a statement of ideology, or racism. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to find a scapegoat, but, if I did, it would have to be the member of 
the group who came from Los Angeles. He was definitely a part of the Aryan 
Skinhead movement." 
</P>
<P>
Liker said his client "had run into" the other defendants at a party, and, 
several hours later, the group was spray-painting the synagogue, roughly a 
block and a half from Goldberg's home. He said his client never left the car 
during the time Goldberg's house was being "hit." 
</P>
<P>
"My client is very remorseful of the whole incident," Liker said. "She 
attempted to apologize to the synagogue and to Adele Goldberg. She felt really 
bad about it." 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg said she never received a direct apology from any of the six 
defendants. 
</P>
<P>
She equated the crime to a rape or a street mugging, in which, ultimately, the 
victim blames herself. She said her life since the attack has been "a 
nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
She said she stopped lighting candles Friday evenings in honor of the Jewish 
Shabbos. And, at night, she sleeps restlessly, if at all, she said, fearful 
that someone, once again, is lurking outside. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg said she took away and stored in her garage front-yard planters in the 
shape of the Star of David. She believes her home was targeted because of the 
planters, which pinpointed hers as a Jewish home. 
</P>
<P>
A neighbor's Cadillac was also defaced. Schwartz said the defendants admitted 
in depositions that they assumed the Cadillac was Goldberg's, because, as 
Goldberg said, "They thought a Jew would drive a Cadillac." Goldberg drives a 
pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg, who lived alone at the time of the incident, was recently married. 
Even with her husband by her side, she said she can no longer watch 
documentaries about World War II that mention Adolf Hitler or the Holocaust. 
And, she finds it "next to impossible" to observe Judaism, which felt 
reassuring -- as opposed to threatening -- before the attack. 
</P>
<P>
She said she first sought the help of a therapist when she found she couldn't 
make it through a High Holy Days service without crying to the point of 
trembling. 
</P>
<P>
"In many ways, my home has become a torture chamber," she said. "But, at the 
same time, I refuse to give in, I refuse to leave. People ask me that all the 
time: 'Why don't you leave?' But I won't. As bad as it's been, that really 
would be admitting defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not fair. It's my house, and I shouldn't have to feel this way. I didn't 
do anything to anybody. I just don't deserve this."

CARLSBAD PONDERS DEVELOPER TAX; 
</P>
<P>
REVENUE: THE CREATION OF A SPECIAL DISTRICT WOULD ALLOW BUILDERS TO BE ASSESSED 
BEFORE ANY BUILDINGS ARE ERECTED, PERMITTING THE CITY TO PLAN FOR GROWTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The city of Carlsbad, population 62,000 and possibly heading for 135,000, is 
considering a special tax on developers to raise $109 million in seed money for 
a new city hall, library and other projects. 
</P>
<P>
Top city officials have proposed that the City Council put 10,261 acres into an 
assessment district, in which developers would pay yearly taxes -- even before 
buildings are put on the land -- so the city can set aside money to prepare for 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
"This lets you issue bonds to build things up front, before the people are 
here, not after they arrive," city finance director Jim Elliott said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
According to a staff report, putting the acreage in a so-called Mello-Roos 
Community Facilities District would generate $109 million to finance 
construction of public buildings, street improvements and interchanges. 
</P>
<P>
Among the earmarked funds is $23 million for a new city hall, $14 million for a 
280-acre Macario Canyon Park, $11 million for a new library in south Carlsbad 
and $4 million to remodel the existing library on Elm Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Construction is scheduled to occur from 1991, the first year the taxes would be 
collected, through 2010. 
</P>
<P>
Carlsbad's growth plan already requires developer fees expected to raise $290 
million between now and the time the city is built out around the year 2020, 
when its population is expected to be about 135,000. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott said the Mello-Roos district would let the city immediately begin 
setting aside revenue to pay for infrastructure, rather than waiting until 
homes or businesses are actually built. A Mello-Roos district, named for the 
state legislators whose bill established it in 1982, is an assessment district 
that allows developers to be taxed on raw land. 
</P>
<P>
"Under the pay-as-you-go concept . . . projects cannot be funded until 
sufficient developer fees are available," according to Elliott's report to the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally, fees do not become available until the developer builds a building 
or home. The city must wait for development to occur before infrastructure 
improvements can be funded," he said. 
</P>
<P>
All property with an existing house or other building on it would be excluded 
from the district, and no assessment, lien or tax would be placed on that land. 
Also, once a home is constructed in a Mello-Roos district, the buyer is not 
required to continue paying the special tax to the city. 
</P>
<P>
The council will hold a public hearing tonight to vote on forming the district. 
So far, developers appear to support the idea and are working with city 
officials to fine-tune the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe this is the way to go," said Doug Buie, chief financial officer of 
Carlsbad Highlands, which seeks to build 740 units on 264 acres in northeast 
Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said developers and the city must work out the details to make sure 
the tax district isn't too great a financial drain on developers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're burdening our land with a tax with no ability to pay for itself," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
If council members approve the resolution, another meeting will be held in 60 
days to hear protests. If fewer than half the property owners, based on 
acreage, oppose the district, the matter will be put before all the affected 
property owners for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
A two-thirds vote of the affected property owners, based on a one-acre, 
one-vote procedure, is required to form a Mello-Roos district.

CHP OFFICER GULPS, TALKS WOMAN OFF BRIDGE PERCH 
</P>

<P>
A California Highway Patrol officer who is afraid of heights sat atop a bridge 
that spans a deep gorge near Pine Valley for nearly two hours early Monday and 
talked a distraught woman out of jumping 260 feet to a nearly certain death. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Tracy Van Emmerik, 26, said she "just tried to keep my mind off" her 
fear of heights, which she said give her "the willies," because the woman 
"needed somebody, and if we had given up on her, she probably would have 
jumped." 
</P>
<P>
Robin Lynn West, 44, of Los Angeles initially refused to leave her perch on a 
six-inch railing and, at one point, threw her legs over the edge and tossed her 
stuffed bear and car keys back to officers, Van Emmerik said. 
</P>
<P>
But West finally relented after conceding that she was hungry, and officers 
agreed to take her for a burrito at an El Cajon restaurant, Van Emmerik said. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept telling her I was afraid, and I was cold and would she please get 
down," Van Emmerik said. "Maybe she felt sorry for me." 
</P>
<P>
Van Emmerik, a five-year CHP veteran, and her partner, Officer Ruben Lazo, were 
called at 1:50 a.m. Monday to the Pine Valley bridge on Interstate 8, about 45 
miles east of downtown San Diego, according to CHP records. 
</P>
<P>
The two officers found a woman, later identified as West, balancing on the 
bridge's northern railing in the center of the span, Van Emmerik said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, who at first told officers only that her name was "Robbi," told Van 
Emmerik she was on the railing because she had "a lot of emotional problems and 
relationship problems and wanted to end it kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
Van Emmerik, her back to the railing to avoid looking down, crawled to within 
10 or 15 feet of the woman. West became agitated, however, as Lazo drew closer 
and, later, as other male officers arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"She made it clear she didn't want men around," Van Emmerik said. "We struck a 
deal: that if they backed off, she would sit down on the railing and talk to 
me, which she did, finally." 
</P>
<P>
For the next two hours, the two women talked. "We talked about movies and books 
and shopping and family and, gosh, it was like I was talking to one of my 
girlfriends or something," Van Emmerik said. 
</P>
<P>
West stepped back down onto the bridge about 4 a.m., after officers promised 
her a meal, Van Emmerik said. Before taking West to the San Diego County 
Psychiatric Hospital on Rosecrans Street, she and Lazo treated her to a 
burrito, Van Emmerik said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just totally relieved that nothing serious happened," Van Emmerik said. 
</P>
<P>
It could not be learned late Monday night whether West was still at the county 
facility.

JURORS RECOMMEND LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE FOR NADDI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A jury recommended Monday that an El Cajon man who killed his wife and four 
other relatives in 1985 be sentenced to life in prison without possibility of 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
After three days of deliberations, the San Diego Superior Court jury rejected 
the death penalty for Toufic Naddi, 49. 
</P>
<P>
Naddi showed no reaction to the verdict, in contrast to his reaction to the 
same jury's finding June 21 that he was sane during the crimes. At that time, 
he exploded in anger and struck one of his attorneys, Beverly Barrett, and was 
subdued by deputy marshals -- all in front of the jury that was to recommend 
his sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Jury foreman Edward Brewer said afterward that the jury disregarded Naddi's 
conduct in court upon hearing the sanity finding. 
</P>
<P>
The foreman said the jury would have voted for the death penalty had the life 
term included parole. Brewer called the decision "pretty difficult" and said 
the death penalty was not quickly dismissed in discussions. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Raymond Edwards set formal sentencing for Sept. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Naddi has admitted shooting all five victims repeatedly in the head in the El 
Cajon home owned by his in-laws on June 1, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Naddi claimed that his father-in-law, Habib Sabbagh, 73, was having an affair 
with his daughter, Naddi's wife, Aida, 26. Also killed were Lillian Sabbagh, 
58; a cousin, Michael Sabbagh, 38, and Aida Naddi's brother-in-law, Osama 
Mashini, 38. 
</P>
<P>
The Sabbagh family was well-known in Amman, Jordan, and Mashini was an actor 
and comedian there. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Bob Boles, who urged jurors in his final argument to "show 
him the same mercy he showed the victims," said he wasn't completely surprised 
by their recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
This is Naddi's fourth trial. He was first convicted June 8, 1988, of five 
first-degree murders, but that jury deadlocked 11 to 1 in favor of finding him 
sane, causing a mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
The second mistrial occurred in 1989, after Boles compared the thinking 
processes of terrorists who killed an American hostage in Beirut to the 
Lebanese-born Naddi. The third mistrial was declared in February after jurors 
admitted reading newspaper stories about Naddi's marriage in jail.

HEALTH CLINIC CELEBRATES NEW LEASE ON LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY BALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nine-year-old Sergio Montoya wasn't quite sure why so many people were 
celebrating Monday afternoon at the Samuel Dixon Family Health Center in Val 
Verde. 
</P>
<P>
Holding a yellow balloon and listening to music blaring from outdoor speakers, 
he said he knew his mother had brought him to the health center for a party. 
The reason for the gathering, he figured, was that "they're going to take out 
the clinic." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the 175 people milling about the medical clinic and its parking lot 
were celebrating the facility's continued life, rather than its demise. But 
Sergio, an occasional patient at the clinic, could be forgiven for assuming the 
worst. 
</P>
<P>
Until July 1, when it was incorporated under a new board of directors composed 
of local residents, even top officials of the health center feared the 
financially troubled facility would be forced to close. For the past 10 years, 
the center had provided health care to the area's predominantly low-income 
residents, many of whom would otherwise have to travel at least 12 miles to the 
nearest hospital. 
</P>
<P>
But the transfer of control of the clinic from two area hospitals to the 
community group qualified it for federal funding. The announcement that the 
county had awarded the health center $120,000 of the funds it receives under 
the federal Community Development Block Grant program came just weeks after 
Michael Gales, a physician's assistant who has helped staff the clinic for the 
past six years, sent letters to his patients advising them to seek medical 
attention elsewhere. "It was that close," Gales said. 
</P>
<P>
The federal money, combined with donations from private citizens, local service 
organizations and area businesses, will fund the clinic until July, 1991. The 
board of directors already has begun applying for grants and soliciting 
donations to support the medical center beyond that date, said Edwin Brown, 
president of the Val Verde Community Assn. and a board member. 
</P>
<P>
Val Verde residents attending the afternoon party expressed relief that they 
would continue to receive affordable quality medical care within walking 
distance of their houses. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time one of the kids got sick, I would just run across the street," said 
Juana Ruelas, who lives just feet from the clinic with her three children, ages 
8, 14 and 16. "I was pretty sure it was going to close down." 
</P>
<P>
The clinic's central location in Val Verde is more than a convenience for those 
who live in the rural Santa Clarita Valley community. Many residents do not own 
a car, and thus find it difficult to travel the 12 miles to Henry Mayo Newhall 
Memorial Hospital in Valencia or to drive the 17 miles to Olive View Hospital 
in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of wealthy people moving in," 18-year-old Mary Gudino, a 
resident of Val Verde for the past four years, said of her community. "But all 
the poor people are still here, and they need the help." 
</P>
<P>
The facility provides health care to 2,400 patients annually, collecting fees 
on a sliding scale based on a patient's ability to pay, Gales said. Ninety-four 
percent of the center's patients receive some reduction in fees, he said, and 
20% pay no fee at all. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic was established in 1980 in honor of Samuel Dixon, pastor of the 
Macedonia Church of God in Christ from 1961 to 1974, when he was killed in an 
automobile accident. The health center, which includes three examining rooms, a 
lobby and two administrative offices, sits on the site of the church's former 
Sunday school.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LANDFILL FOES MARCH ON ANTONOVICH'S OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A small band of north San Fernando Valley residents, carrying bags of garbage, 
marched Monday to the office of County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, urging that 
he oppose expansion of Sunshine Canyon Landfill above Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Although they had planned to dump their plastic bags of trash at the doorstep 
of Antonovich's office, the dozen adults in the group quietly obeyed security 
officers who ordered them to leave the bags outside as they entered the County 
Hall of Administration to present their demands to Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
Dawson Oppenheimer, Antonovich's press secretary, told the group that 
Antonovich wants to hear the county Regional Planning Commission's 
recommendation before reaching a decision on the controversial expansion of the 
privately owned landfill. 
</P>
<P>
No date has been set for the commission to rule on a plan by the landfill 
owner, Browning-Ferris Industries, to more than double the size of the existing 
230-acre landfill north of Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Rona Berger, a Granada Hills resident and leader of the group, said the 
homeowners would return July 16 to hear Antonovich's position on the dump.

PRODUCER OF L-TRYPTOPHAN NAMED IN $30-MILLION SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Burbank couple filed a $30-million lawsuit Monday against a manufacturer of 
the dietary supplement L-tryptophan, alleging that impurities in the product 
severely disabled the woman. 
</P>
<P>
Mike and Cecile Gracy filed the suit in Burbank Superior Court, claiming that 
Showa Denko of Tokyo produced impure batches of tryptophan in late 1988 and 
early 1989 that caused Cecile Gracy to develop eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, a 
potentially fatal muscle and blood ailment. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old woman was hospitalized last October for back pain, muscle 
atrophy, partial paralysis and skin thickening, among other problems, after 
taking the supplement for about six months, Mike Gracy said. She has since been 
released but has not recovered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not noticed anything else in her medical records that would seem to 
indicate that this was caused by anything other than L-tryptophan," said Robert 
R. Star, an Encino attorney representing the Gracys. "We're dealing strictly 
with a product created and distributed in a negligent manner." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Schwadron, a spokesman for Showa Denko in New York, declined to comment on 
the lawsuit. He acknowledged that other lawsuits had been filed against the 
company, the largest of six tryptophan suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration last November ordered a total recall of 
L-tryptophan, after federal and state health officials concluded there was a 
link between a U.S. epidemic of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome and the 
supplement. 
</P>
<P>
As of last Friday, 1,531 cases, including 27 deaths, had been reported to the 
Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. Of those, 275 were reported from 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, researchers presented the strongest evidence to date linking the 
epidemic to batches of the supplement manufactured in late 1988 and early 1989 
by Showa Denko. 
</P>
<P>
Health officials from Minnesota, Oregon, New Mexico and New York presented data 
at a medical meeting in New Mexico showing that about 95% of the cases they had 
studied extensively could be traced to Showa Denko. Minnesota researchers said 
they had identified specific changes in Showa Denko's manufacturing techniques 
that seemed to be related to increased amounts of an impurity in the company's 
tryptophan. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was organized by Dr. Phillip Hertzman, a Los Alamos, N.M., family 
practitioner who helped discover the syndrome last October.

FRUIT FLY TRAPPED IN LA MESA, BUT NO SPRAYING IS PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County agricultural officials reported Monday that they had trapped an Oriental 
fruit fly and four gypsy moths in recent days but said that they had no 
immediate plans for aerial spraying to eradicate the pests. 
</P>
<P>
Without the discovery of other Oriental fruit flies, the discovery of just one, 
found July 3 in La Mesa, does not warrant the sort of spraying administered in 
May and June over El Cajon to combat the Mexican fruit fly, assistant 
agricultural commissioner Bill Snodgrass said. 
</P>
<P>
Even if other Oriental flies are found, the county would be much more likely to 
put out baited traps than to spray, because it's a better plan for that kind of 
fly, Snodgrass said. 
</P>
<P>
The moths, "voracious eaters" of trees and shrubs but no threat to valuable 
citrus crops, have been found in La Mesa and in Vista, Snodgrass said. If more 
are found, he said, agricultural officials intend only to set traps. 
</P>
<P>
The sole Oriental fly, a sexually mature male, was found in a trap set in an 
orange tree, Snodgrass said. It was the first Oriental fly found in San Diego 
County since 1987 and prompted officials to set more traps to see if there are 
additional sexually mature flies buzzing about, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Oriental fruit flies, predominantly yellow with dark markings, deposit eggs 
under the skin of 150 kinds of fruit, including citrus. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, when three Oriental flies were found, the county successfully used the 
baited traps, which are lined with a chemical that attracts the flies to a 
lurking insecticide, Snodgrass said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the four moths, with which the county is "not nearly as concerned about," 
three were found in La Mesa and one in Vista, Snodgrass said. Trapping in the 
immediate areas around each find has been increased, he said.

DOCTOR CHARGED WITH SELLING NARCOTICS PRESCRIPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BLAKE FONTENAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Clairemont physician will face a preliminary hearing Aug. 7 on charges that 
he sold customers prescriptions for an assortment of narcotic drugs, including 
some as potent as heroin, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Thomas Dosumu-Johnson, 43, pleaded innocent Monday in Municipal Court to 
charges he used his medical practice as a front to sell prescriptions for 
powerful narcotic drugs to patients who did not need such medication, said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. George Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
Dosumu-Johnson was arrested last Friday after a 2 1/2-month investigation by 
the state's Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement and other agencies, said Philip 
Donohue, a special agent in the bureau's San Diego office. 
</P>
<P>
"We have encountered this kind of thing before," Donohue said. "There are 
members of the medical profession who don't play by the rules. . . . But his 
crimes were as blatant as any that we've uncovered." 
</P>
<P>
Dosumu-Johnson is charged with 12 counts of improperly prescribing narcotics 
and could face five years in prison for each count, Donohue said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said Dosumu-Johnson was born in Liberia and earned his medical 
degree in Guadalajara, Mexico. He had been practicing in Southern California 
for about seven years, Donohue added. 
</P>
<P>
Undercover agents allegedly visited Dosumu-Johnson six times, and during those 
visits the doctor offered to sell them prescriptions for several types of 
painkillers and stimulant drugs, Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the drugs Dosumu-Johnson reportedly prescribed were Valium, amphetamines, 
methadone and Dilaudid, Donohue said. 
</P>
<P>
Methadone is a drug commonly used to treat heroin addicts, and Dilaudid is a 
painkiller known colloquially as "drugstore heroin," Donohue said. 
</P>
<P>
"If given a choice, a heroin addict would take Dilaudid over heroin," Donohue 
said. "It's just as potent, and it's purer." 
</P>
<P>
A single tablet of Dilaudid sells on the street for $20 to $25, Bennett said, 
saying that Dosumu-Johnson allegedly offered to sell prescriptions for more 
than 4,200 pills to the undercover agents. 
</P>
<P>
Besides being accused of prescribing specific drugs, Dosumu-Johnson also sold 
blank prescriptions for as much as $200, Donohue said. Such blank 
prescriptions, which must be filled out in triplicate for more powerful drugs, 
can fetch a street value of up to $350, Donohue said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the criminal charges, Dosumu-Johnson could also lose his medical 
license. Linda McCerady, a spokeswoman for the state medical board, said 
Dosumu-Johnson would probably face a disciplinary hearing if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
"We can take the license away for a criminal conviction," McCerady said. "If 
he's convicted, his chances of keeping his license are pretty slim."

NATO SENDS SUMMIT SIGNALS; 
</P>
<P>
REASSURES SOVIETS, CHALLENGES WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most of what Western leaders said in London last week was meant to reassure 
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev -- and perhaps more important, his generals 
-- that his borders are secure. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, they 
said, in several different ways, is a defensive body with no "aggressive 
intentions." Thus the final NATO summit communique was a political document, 
nowhere more so than in the final paragraph: "Today, our Alliance begins a 
major transformation." But the "major transformation" also carried a message 
for NATO's own generals. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the message was that NATO troops no longer will crowd against the 
border between East and West Germany in a more or less unbroken line ready to 
block a Soviet attack toward the English Channel. They will give way to a 
thinner line of troops, mobile enough to move into blocking positions in a 
crisis. But creating what the communique called more versatile and flexible 
forces may be the easy part of the transformation. NATO forces now line the 
border in national units whose troops speak the same language and respond to 
orders based on the same training in tactics. Now NATO will field multinational 
units, a move that means intensive retraining so that orders will mean the same 
thing to all troops. 
</P>
<P>
The NATO communique promised smaller standing forces with an increased reliance 
on reserves. It proposes eventually to withdraw all nuclear artillery shells 
from Europe, provided that the Soviet Union does the same. 
</P>
<P>
The communique's emphasis on smaller and fewer presents a major challenge to 
the line commanders who must prepare the new units to tackle what is left of 
NATO's peacekeeping job now that the threat of a Soviet blitz across Europe has 
dwindled almost to the vanishing point. But the bigger challenge will be for 
strategic planners and for political leaders, particularly in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
For the Pentagon, the order to transform NATO adds pressure to produce more 
realistic assessments of the need for military power over the next couple of 
decades than it has managed to come up with so far. The NATO communique will 
make it even harder for military planners to plead for new weapons systems to 
meet threats that seem ever less likely to materialize. 
</P>
<P>
For political leaders, rummaging through defense spending in search of a peace 
dividend, the trick will be to avoid budget cuts that will also hurt national 
security. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations in Vienna on the numbers of tanks, infantry, tactical aircraft and 
other conventional forces that NATO and the Warsaw Pact will keep to oversee 
the winding down of the Cold War seem likely to lead to cuts of perhaps 60% in 
the strength of Soviet and East European forces. This probably is inevitable. 
But peace can come to Europe only one step at a time and a conventional forces 
treaty at Vienna is the obligatory next step.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California is in its second week without a state budget. Gov. George Deukmejian 
insists that the $3.6-billion deficit must be eliminated without a tax 
increase. Democratic legislators resist any solution that relies solely on 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a fiscal crisis that deepens with each passing day. 
</P>
<P>
California also is in the second month of a gubernatorial campaign. Republican 
Pete Wilson and Democrat Dianne Feinstein both decline to take specific 
positions on the budget question. 
</P>
<P>
It would be more than helpful, though, to know what their inclinations are on 
so fundamental a problem of governance, since it almost certainly will reoccur.

As John Vasconcellos, the obviously frustrated chairman of the Assembly Ways 
and Means Committee put it, "If you're going to govern, you ought to tell 
people how you're going to govern." 
</P>
<P>
Since Walter Mondale's disastrous experiment with candor in 1984, candidates 
have been reluctant to be specific about taxation. California voters, however, 
need to know where the candidates stand on taxes, the growth of entitlements 
and where their priorities are in an era of fiscal limits. 
</P>
<P>
Both Feinstein and Wilson are instinctual moderates with pragmatic rather than 
ideological attitudes toward public policy. Since they are inclined to decide 
issues on a case-by-case basis, voters ought to judge them on the same basis. 
The budget crisis is as good a place as any to start.

LOUISIANA'S LOUSY ABORTION BILL; 
</P>
<P>
MORE FALLOUT FROM CONFUSED HIGH COURT DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What a creative bunch those Louisiana state legislators are. Instead of 
spending their time shoring up a sagging state economy or increasing literacy, 
a single-minded faction of the Legislature has fixated on laying down the law 
on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Why go after issues that require complex thought and planning when the 
political equivalent of a fistfight will do? 
</P>
<P>
The proposed Louisiana law would outlaw abortion except in the cases of rape, 
incest or when the pregnant woman's life is in danger, and would institute an 
unprecedented penalty on doctors of up to 10 years in prison and a $100,000 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
It would be easy to disparage Louisiana for its backwardness. But actually, 
this bill is merely the most radical example of the continuing fallout from 
last year's confused Supreme Court decision on abortion. An indecisive high 
court was not quite willing to overturn the landmark Roe vs. Wade case 
legalizing abortion, but it was willing to throw it back to the states to renew 
debate on abortion restrictions. So the attempts to restrict abortions keep 
coming -- from Idaho, where a stricter law failed, to Pennsylvania, where one 
succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
The Louisiana law now is in the hands of Gov. Buddy Roemer, who said he favored 
an anti-abortion law but who now questions the constitutionality of this one. 
That's because the anti-abortion bill was transformed, whole cloth, from a bill 
that would have allowed a maximum $25 fine for beating someone who burned the 
flag. 
</P>
<P>
"Only in Louisiana could you have a flag burning bill become an abortion bill," 
said one abortion-rights activist. Not so. Not anymore.

CUTBACKS IN PROBATION PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Politicians and government officials do not want to appear soft on crime. 
Behind the scenes, however, they occasionally make decisions that run counter 
to their public posturing on law and order and the war on drugs. A case in 
point is at hand. 
</P>
<P>
Hidden in this year's deliberations over a budget for Los Angeles County lies a 
recommendation from Chief Administrative Officer Richard Dixon that, if 
adopted, will have major impact on the criminal justice system. He is 
recommending the elimination of active supervision for 80,000 adult offenders 
currently on probation. They would be placed on a computerized caseload and 
would not receive any ongoing contact from a probation officer. For all 
practical purposes, probation supervision for 80,000 adults convicted of a wide 
range of offenses, many of which are felonies, will be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a plea for the increased use of probation. Rather, if probation is 
ordered let it mean something. Offenders should receive the monitoring and 
enforcement of court orders that judges and the public expect. 
</P>
<P>
Probation is a viable sentencing alternative for certain offenders and when 
combined with the threat of incarceration and enforceable court orders can 
effectively inhibit further law violations. But not in Los Angeles County if 
Dixon's recommendation is accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Make no mistake, the word will spread quickly. After all the effort, expense 
and danger of arrest, trial and conviction, not much is really going to happen 
to the majority of offenders. 
</P>
<P>
Because of severe overcrowding, time spent in jail or prison has been shortened 
tremendously to accommodate a growing backlog of criminals waiting to serve 
their sentences. The revolving door spins at frightening speed. With the 
elimination of probation, there will be no real consequences for those people 
who do not serve even these limited sentences. 
</P>
<P>
These are critical issues that receive little or no attention from the general 
public. What you hear is often far different from what you get when it comes to 
the so-called justice system. In the next few weeks that difference could 
become even greater.

<P>
'SELF-HELP' JUST WON'T DO IT ALL; 
</P>
<P>
AS LONG AS THE EFFECTS OF WHITE OPPRESSION EXIST AND AS LONG AS RACISM LINGERS, 
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION WILL BE NECESSARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Benjamin L. Hooks, Benjamin L. Hooks is the executive director of the 
National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Weary of colonial rule, the angry activists stood on the banks of Boston Harbor 
on a cold December evening, lugged about 340 crates to the river's edge and 
pitched more than $10,000 worth of tea into the brisk, bustling waters. 
</P>
<P>
The action of American patriots at the Boston Tea Party -- which helped launch 
the American Revolution -- was, incredibly, a pitch for affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
America's 18th-Century revolutionaries were affirming their right to 
self-determination and equal opportunity. Surely, we have not forgotten their 
rallying call, "No taxation without representation." Or Patrick Henry's 
impassioned, noble cry, "Give me liberty or give me death." 
</P>
<P>
This is why we bristle at the current "controversy" over the value and benefits 
of modern-day affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
Affirmative-action critics suggest that such policies have not benefited poor 
blacks, have impeded the development of coalitions for social programs and have 
inhibited black Americans through a deep sense of inferiority. 
</P>
<P>
These notions would be comical if they weren't so dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
The irony is that these well-trained -- if misguided -- academicians have the 
opportunity to espouse such nonsense is itself due to affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
Would they have been trained at some of the nation's leading colleges without 
it? Would they be professors at predominantly white universities? Would they 
not feel the racist sting of Jim Crow's piercing whip? Would they be published 
in some of America's most influential periodicals? 
</P>
<P>
They fail to realize that affirmative action is simply any action taken to 
ensure, or affirm, equal opportunity for oppressed or previously disadvantaged 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
What's wrong with that? If a society discriminates against a people for 
centuries -- enslaves them, lynches them, oppresses them, denies them access to 
jobs, homes, a good education, the political process, etc. -- the just way to 
offer remedy is to give that people an equal opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
The affirmative-action debate often gets mired in the issue of numerical goals 
and timetables, which are often disparagingly called quotas by critics and 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
The NAACP has never promoted the concept of so-called quotas. In fact, goals 
and timetables would never have been necessary if corporate and municipal 
leaders had been willing to follow the letter and spirit of the law. 
</P>
<P>
Goals and timetables came about because of the failure of parties to be sincere 
in their efforts to provide equal opportunity. They were built in by judges who 
tired of the stances of interposition and nullification. The "we can't find 
any" argument was most often an attempt by corporate and municipal leaders to 
skirt the law. So judges had to construct goals and timetables to keep parties 
from making a mockery of the federal court. Critics who negate or ignore white 
America's duty to help solve black America's problems misrepresent the issue, 
mislead the public and subvert the struggle. 
</P>
<P>
While we recognize that heightened "self-help" efforts among blacks will lessen 
our plight -- and we at the NAACP promote such efforts -- we believe what the 
Kerner Commission said more than 20 years ago still rings true: 
</P>
<P>
"What white Americans have never fully understood -- but what the Negro can 
never forget -- is that white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto. White 
institutions created it, white institutions maintain it and white society 
condones it." 
</P>
<P>
In their near-exclusive focus on what blacks should do, critics largely 
overlook the responsibility of government, big business and the courts in what 
is purported to be a fair and democratic society. 
</P>
<P>
When blacks have done all they can to save themselves, white society must still 
do the right thing. If racism, discrimination and unequal opportunity pervade, 
lone efforts by blacks will remain virtually ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, critics who suggest that black Americans need to develop their 
individual skills and must not eternally regard themselves as victims are not 
totally wrong. Neither are they wrong when they urge young blacks to study, be 
disciplined and conscientious, and to reject the notion that achievement 
somehow diminishes blackness. 
</P>
<P>
But they are totally wrong when they suggest, implicitly or otherwise, that 
acknowledged black leaders are not pushing these concepts as well. We are. So, 
at best, these critics are doing no more than parroting our views. 
</P>
<P>
I make hundreds of speeches a year in which I preach the gospel of hard work, 
discipline and achievement. Other leaders do the same. To suggest otherwise is 
a gross distortion and disservice. 
</P>
<P>
While self-responsibility and self-determination must play heightened roles in 
our communities, we believe government cannot shirk its role. 
</P>
<P>
I hasten to add that I am curious as to how this issue evolved as a controversy 
in the first place. Goals and timetables are as American as apple pie. 
</P>
<P>
You must pay your taxes by April 15. You must not drive more than the posted 
speed limit. You must register to vote or apply for a passport by certain 
dates. Car manufacturers must ensure their cars meet certain emissions 
standards by certain times. 
</P>
<P>
America operates by goals and timetables -- and we all acknowledge and accept 
that. It is only when it comes to human resources that we bristle at this 
concept. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, we at the NAACP promote the concept of self-help. And the fact is 
that blacks have committed to self-help since the slave ships first docked on 
America's shores. 
</P>
<P>
In 1990 America, we see the benefits of that self-help concept and affirmative 
action efforts. We have black mayors, elected officials, police officers, 
firefighters, journalists, judges, doctors, lawyers, captains of industry and 
thousands of other professionals. 
</P>
<P>
More importantly, we have office clerks, secretaries, laborers, court employees 
and literally millions of everyday working people whose jobs are indirectly and 
directly linked to affirmative action and self-help. 
</P>
<P>
These would have been the people mired inextricably in poverty and despair were 
it not for coalition-building and affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
The critics who benefited from but oppose affirmative action obscure the legacy 
of exclusion and discrimination that prompted such remedial efforts. They 
should be ashamed. 
</P>
<P>
As the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights once noted, just as medical treatment is 
based on the diagnosis of an illness, affirmative action stems from diagnosis 
of a social sickness. 
</P>
<P>
The remedy cannot be divorced from the illness. Critics write much about some 
"corrosive effect" of affirmative action but very little about the racism, 
oppression and discrimination that necessitates it -- and which is much more 
corrosive and destructive. 
</P>
<P>
We shall at the NAACP always promote self-help, but will never waver in our 
push to insist that government play its role and do its part. For how long? For 
as long as necessary.

THE POLITICAL VETERANO OF MELROSE AVENUE; 
</P>
<P>
FRANK CASADO: LONG BEFORE HOLLYWOOD 'DISCOVERED' HIM, HE WAS A POLITICAL 
ACTIVIST BOTH ON THE EASTSIDE AND NATIONALLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK del OLMO, Frank del Olmo is deputy editor of the editorial pages. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The tributes are pouring in, as well they should, for Frank Casado, who died 
last week at the age of 66. He was well-known -- and not only in Los Angeles -- 
as the co-owner, maitre d' and resident philosopher at Lucy's El Adobe, a 
popular Mexican restaurant on a rather seedy stretch of trendy Melrose Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Because Lucy's is a hangout for folks from Paramount Studios, right across the 
street, and several nearby TV stations and recording studios, the tributes are 
playing up the Hollywood angle, focusing on the movie stars who ate there and 
especially the young rock musicians that Frank and his wife Lucy helped and 
encouraged with many a free meal and margarita. 
</P>
<P>
That's fine, and I must admit that even a jaded, native Angeleno like me 
sometimes enjoyed stopping by Lucy's to stargaze. But the Frank Casado I want 
to remember had a harder edge to him -- an edge that pushed him and his wife to 
become political leaders in the Mexican-American community long before it was 
fashionable, or easy. 
</P>
<P>
I'm referring to that almost-forgotten period between 1945 and 1960. Back then 
the Casados (because you really can't talk about Frank without including Lucy, 
the two were that close) were among a handful of Eastside activists who 
circulated petitions and got out the vote to help elect a young social worker 
named Edward R. Roybal to the City Council in 1949, making him the first Latino 
on that body in this century. In the 1950s, the Casados helped found the 
statewide Mexican-American Political Assn. to promote the candidacy of other 
Latino politicians. They remained active in MAPA until it began to fade in the 
1970s, when Chicano politics got too sophisticated for any one organization to 
speak for a growing and complex community. 
</P>
<P>
Late into many an evening I enjoyed listening to Casado reminisce about the 
early days. He gave a young political reporter many insights into what Latino 
politics was like before TV, radio, specialized mailers and high-paid 
consultants turned it into a vaguely picante version of modern mass-media 
politics everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
I learned from those conversations that the successful restaurateur never 
completely forgot the resentment he felt as a Latino growing up in Boyle 
Heights, being regularly harassed by the cops for no particular reason. In 
current terms, Frank would be referred to as a wanna-be pachuco. But before he 
could become a genuine gang member, World War II broke out, and he joined the 
Navy to fight in the Pacific. The Eastside, indeed the entire city, are better 
places for that happenstance. Like many Chicano veterans, he returned from the 
war matured and eager to exercise his rights as an American. 
</P>
<P>
As noted, Lucy Casado had a great deal of influence on her husband. She grew up 
in Texas, where anti-Mexican prejudice has historically been more overt (if not 
more pervasive) than in California. Frank, whose father had immigrated to the 
United States from Spain, often spoke angrily of the discrimination Lucy had 
experienced. That also influenced them both to become active in politics on a 
national scale. 
</P>
<P>
Their close friendship with former California Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. brought 
them some notoriety in the 1970s. But long before they adopted Jerry Brown, 
they worked for various nationally known politicians like Robert F. Kennedy, 
who was a special favorite. But for all the big-name Democratic and Republican 
politicians who dined at their restaurant -- making it as much a journalistic 
and political hangout as a Hollywood one -- they never lost touch with their 
roots in the politics of the Eastside. 
</P>
<P>
One of the Casados' proudest memories, one I find especially illustrative, is 
of the intense 1968 presidential campaign. The soon-to-be-assassinated Kennedy 
was trying to win the Democratic nomination with a strong showing in the 
California primary. Yet Frank and Lucy persuaded him to take time off from a 
hectic schedule to meet privately at El Adobe with a group of Chicano college. 
</P>
<P>
The young people who met Kennedy included some of student leaders who, earlier 
that same year, had gotten into lots of legal and personal trouble for helping 
organize walkouts at several local high schools that are still remembered as 
the "East L.A. Blowouts." Historians now consider those 1968 protests as a 
turning point in the political development of the nation's Mexican-American 
community. If they were, there must have been a symbolic passing of the torch 
that day from old veterano Frank Casado to the young Blowout leaders, many of 
whom still play important roles in local Chicano politics. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's taking time to pay attention to those young Chicanos -- most of whom 
could not yet vote and who probably didn't tell the senator anything he 
couldn't already figure out about the shortcomings of public education in the 
nation's barrios -- is just one more vignette that explains why Kennedy is 
still revered by many Chicano activists. 
</P>
<P>
The Casados, going to the trouble of helping set that session up -- in the 
hopes of enlightening a powerful politician to the needs of their community and 
to convince some angry young activists that they would be listened to even by a 
quintessentially Establishment figure -- illustrates why Frank Casado will be 
missed by many more people than the denizens of the wonderful restaurant he 
ran.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: NO PRO BASKETBALL, REFUNDS ON WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sports Arena operator Harry Cooper said Monday he has no certain prospects of 
landing a professional basketball team in San Diego and is ready to refund 
deposits on season tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said efforts to launch a new National Basketball Assn. team or acquire 
an existing franchise, a cornerstone of his plans to build a deluxe Sports 
Arena, have stalled, largely because of intense competition for franchises and 
a lack of support from city officials. 
</P>
<P>
With little hope left of bringing an NBA team to San Diego before the new 
arena's targeted opening of August 1994, Cooper said he is now focusing on 
entering the National Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
"Just like you can't build a shopping center without an anchor tenant, you 
can't build a sports arena without an anchor tenant. It either has to be an NHL 
team or an NBA team," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A letter will soon go out to the 3,000 San Diegans who put up a $50 deposit on 
season tickets to an NBA team. They can either choose a refund with interest or 
a comparable deposit on an IHL or NHL season ticket, Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
HIRINGS 
</P>
<P>
The University of San Diego has hired Regina Sullivan as assistant athletic 
director, USD athletic director Tom Iannacone announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, 29, will serve as the operations director, the primary administrator 
for specific sports and as the coordinator of special projects. She had been 
working as a graduate assistant in the University of Tennessee's athletic 
department. 
</P>
<P>
A 1983 graduate of Yale, Sullivan was a four-year letter winner for the women's 
varsity basketball team and an All-Ivy League performer in 1980 and 1983.

MORNING BRIEFING: WHEN HE GETS IN RING, HE SHOWS TRUE COLORS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Johnston of Denver will fight Ronald Wright of St. Petersburg, Fla., in 
Wednesday night's light-welterweight title fight at the Olympic Festival in St. 
Paul, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
"I told my grandmother and mother that I ain't losing no more fights," Johnston 
said. 
</P>
<P>
His grandmother and mother have been following his fight career -- inside and 
outside the ring. 
</P>
<P>
Said Johnston: "In my neighborhood a little while back, I was wearing red, 
which is the Bloods' color, and the Crips didn't like it. But I said, 'You 
can't tell me what to wear,' and I fought them. 
</P>
<P>
"The next day, I'm wearing blue, the Crips' color, and I fought the Bloods in 
the city park. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important not to back down . . . but I do get tired of it sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
Add Festival: Princeton's Pete Carril, coach of the East basketball team, 
favors keeping NBA players off the U.S. Olympic team. But he told Chuck 
Schoffner of the Associated Press that he'd just as soon not debate the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Said Carril: "The world of sport is very insignificant. I don't think losing to 
a foreign country in the sport of basketball is a sign of decadence. I think 
greater signs of decadence are present in other factors, such as the low 
productivity of our industry, the quality of our water, our increasing debt, 
the fact that we can't walk in many of our cities, the fact we've got a 
tremendous drug problem. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at it from that standpoint, how important can it be that you 
beat everybody in basketball at the Olympics?" 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Who was the oldest player to appear in an All-Star game? 
</P>
<P>
Gone fishin': John Nelson of Associated Press notes that of the 10 highest-paid 
major league players, only two -- Jose Canseco and Will Clark -- will be in the 
All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Stewart and Nolan Ryan could have made the American League team but needed 
the rest. The other six are Joe Carter, Eric Davis, Mark Davis, Mark Langston, 
Don Mattingly and Robin Yount. 
</P>

Mutterers' row: Fifty-six years ago today, in the 1934 All-Star game, New York 
Giant pitcher Carl Hubbell struck out the heart of the AL lineup -- Babe Ruth, 
Lou Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx, Al Simmons, and Joe Cronin -- in succession. But the 
AL came back to beat the National League, 9-7, at the Polo Grounds in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Who's counting: According to the Associated Press, "The American League is 
trying for its first three-game winning streak in the All-Star game since 
1946-49." 
</P>
<P>
Check local listings: The Cleveland Indians probably wouldn't mind if ESPN 
blacked them out for the remainder of the 1990 season. This year, the Indians, 
six games out of first place, are 0-7 on ESPN, with a rainout and a snowout. 
</P>
<P>
Tabloid trivia time: Joe Gergen of Newsday, writing from Wimbledon last week, 
noted that when England's soccer team qualified for the World Cup semifinals, 
the London Daily Mail asked this question: 
</P>
<P>
"What do England's three semifinal rivals have in common? They have all won the 
World Cup, but they all lost to us in wars." 
</P>
<P>
High hopes: Randy Johnson's Seattle Mariner teammates have nicknamed the 
6-foot-10 pitcher "Big Unit." When asked why he wears a coat and tie on the 
road, he said, "You never know when you might meet Mrs. Unit." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Satchel Paige. In the 1953 All-Star game at Cincinnati, Paige, 
47 years 7 days old, pitched the eighth inning for the AL, giving up two runs. 
The NL won, 5-1.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Allan Malamud

<TEXT>
<P>
What separates the baseball All-Star game from the rest is that people actually 
care who wins. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I mean, do you remember who won the last Pro Bowl? How about the last NBA 
All-Star game? And you deserve a medal if you can name the teams that play in 
the NHL All-Star game. But you probably are aware that the Americans beat the 
Nationals last year. And the year before, too, after losing 22 of 25. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Another thing that distinguishes this game is that the players never get to 
compete against each other during the regular season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The downside is that the game has become pretty much of a bore. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Blame it on the domination of the pitchers over the hitters. The most anyone 
pitches is three innings. No need to pace yourself. Just rear back and fire. 
Even the best hitters are going to be overmatched most of the time. . . . 
</P>
<P>
An All-Star game should be full of home runs, stolen bases, great fielding 
plays -- and an occasional well-pitched inning. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Will the friendly confines of Wrigley Field make for more excitement tonight? 
In the 1962 All-Star game at Wrigley, 13 runs were scored. But in 1947, only 
three were scored. And the wind is supposed to be blowing in tonight. . . . 
</P>
<P>
All-Star break awards: American League MVP -- Rickey Henderson; NL -- Ryne 
Sandberg. AL manager of the year -- Jeff Torborg; NL -- Lou Piniella. AL Cy 
Young -- Bob Welch; NL -- Frank Viola. AL rookie of the year -- Sandy Alomar; 
NL -- Delino DeShields. . . . 
</P>
<P>
And then there are Don Mattingly, who is batting .253; Mike Greenwell, who has 
hit two home runs; Mark Davis, who has a 5.40 earned-run average, and Mark 
Langston, who is 4-9. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The best divisional races will be in the East. Oakland should begin to pull 
away from Chicago in the AL West soon, and nobody is a threat to catch 
Cincinnati in the NL West. But Pittsburgh should stay with New York all season, 
and there might be a photo finish between Boston and Toronto. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Athletics play their next 14 games at home, the White Sox their next 11 on 
the road. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Worst All-Star idea ever was having two games in each of the seasons from 1959 
through 1962. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The fourth pick in the June draft, pitcher Alex Fernandez, got $350,000 from 
the Chicago White Sox. The first pick, shortstop Chipper Jones, got only 
$275,000 from the Atlanta Braves. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Reuss signed to pitch in the Pittsburgh Pirates' farm system after 
turning down an invitation to play in the Dodgers' old-timers' game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Look-alikes: David Stern and Marvin Hamlisch. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Cheapest seats for the Virgil Hill-Tyrone Frazier fight Saturday in Bismarck, 
N.D., and the Jack Johnson-Jim Jeffries fight on July 4, 1910, in Reno were 
both $10. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Where do the hooligans hang out after soccer season ends? . . . 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Long Beach's George Allen, who was the only major college football 
coach without an air-conditioner in his office, is having one installed today. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Look for an upswing in the USC track and field program, once the nation's best, 
now that Jim Bush has been named head coach. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Jorge Paez's draw with Troy Dorsey Sunday must have been one of the toughest 
fights to score in years. Judge Dalby Shirley had Dorsey ahead, 116-112. 
Associated Press reporter Tim Dahlberg had Paez ahead, 118-110. . . . 
</P>
<P>
George Foreman says he couldn't run more than three miles in 1974 when he was 
heavyweight champion, but now he can go as far as 16 if he stops for water a 
few times along the way. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles -- endowed with Southern 
California's share of the surplus from the 1984 Olympic Games -- is offering 
free clinics to 1,500 high school soccer coaches in the area. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Pity the promoters of this week's Swedish Open. Stefan Edberg isn't entered. 
However, the Wimbledon champion will return to the site of his victory in the 
1984 Olympic Games when he plays in the Volvo Tennis/Los Angeles tournament 
July 28-Aug. 5. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse wide receiver Robb Moore is the plum of the NFL supplementary draft 
today, but is he worth a 1991 first-round draft choice? The Dallas Cowboys 
would have drafted first overall this year if they hadn't taken Steve Walsh 
last year. And the Phoenix Cardinals would have drafted third if they hadn't 
taken Timm Rosenbach. But Bobby Humphrey was a bargain for the Denver Broncos, 
who would have drafted 25th. . . . 
</P>
<P>
News item: Diego Maradona says Argentina lost to West Germany in the World Cup 
final because of a Mafioso plot. Reaction: At least, he didn't blame Zola Budd.

'Monday Night Live' Downtown-Bound: Those infamous star-studded Monday night 
jam sessions at the China Club in Hollywood are no more. 
</P>
<P>
The house band for the jams, Jim Ehinger and the Nasty Survivors, has moved its 
base to Vertigo in downtown Los Angeles. While not specifically knocking the 
accommodations at the China Club, band publicists said that the move will 
provide "musicians and guests easier access, a larger room in which to listen 
and play" and "a courteous approach at the front door." They added that the 
sound and light system at Vertigo was superior to the China Club. Elton John 
and Sting have played in previous China Club jams. GREG BRAXTON

Days of Thunderous Hype: Tom Cruise isn't slowing down in his quest to pump 
some box-office gas into his "Days of Thunder" film. He appeared Sunday on 
"Hangin' With Hollywood," a national teen radio show on KIIS-FM (102.7) hosted 
by Hollywood Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
Cruise, who reportedly had not done many radio interviews in hyping his 
previous films, is turning to the medium more and more to publicize the film, 
which is receiving a less-than-thunderous reception from audiences and critics. 
The star talked extensively with Hamilton, but refused to discuss his breakup 
with wife Mimi Rogers or his current involvement with "Days" co-star Nicole 
Kidman. Cruise told how he deals with fans who follow him around while he's 
driving in his black Porsche: "I either pull over and give them the autograph, 
or I lose them." GREG BRAXTON

Clean Bill of Health for Hackman: Gene Hackman checked out of a Portland, Ore. 
hospital over the weekend after a five-day stay, during which doctors cleared a 
narrowed artery to his heart, barely averting a heart attack, officials said. 
Hackman, 60, was released Saturday from St. Vincent Hospital and Medical 
Center, but hospital officials agreed not to make his departure public for 24 
hours, apparently so he could slip away quietly. 
</P>
<P>
Hackman was spending a few days on vacation at the Oregon coast last week when 
chest pains that eventually spread to his arm prompted him to drive to Portland 
and check himself into the hospital. The next day, after a series of tests, 
doctors used a balloon catheter to clear the narrowing artery, a relatively new 
but routine procedure called angioplasty.GREG BRAXTON

CHICAGO CURRENCY TRADERS FREED OF MAJOR CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CHICAGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government's attack on corruption in Chicago's big commodities markets 
appeared to suffer a significant setback Monday when a jury in federal court 
here failed to convict three currency traders on any of the main racketeering 
or fraud charges against them. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the three Swiss franc traders were found guilty on lesser charges of 
violating federal commodities trading regulations, mainly involving illegal 
commodities trades they made directly with an undercover FBI agent who posed as 
a crooked trader. The third trader was found not guilty on any charges. 
</P>
<P>
But the jury of nine women and three men was unable to reach verdicts on most 
of the 117 counts brought against the three, and so a partial mistrial was 
declared on the remaining charges. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors said after the verdict was announced that they plan to 
retry all three traders on the remaining counts involved in the mistrial -- 
including the key racketeering charges. 
</P>
<P>
But defense attorneys said they would move to have the remaining charges 
dismissed and argued that the verdict showed that the government had been 
heavy-handed in its attempt to wield the racketeering statute -- originally 
designed to fight the Mob -- as a weapon against white-collar crime in the pits 
of Chicago's commodities exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a lesson there for the government," said defense attorney 
Alan Blumenthal. 
</P>
<P>
The jury found Robert Mosky, a broker in the Swiss franc pit of the Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange, guilty on seven counts of commodities law violations, and 
acquitted him on 20 other counts. Mosky, the key figure in the trial, had been 
charged with a total of 97 counts. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Daniel Scheck, an independent trader in Swiss francs, was found 
guilty on one count, while David Zatz, another trader, was found not guilty on 
two of the 14 counts with which he was charged; verdicts were not returned on 
the others. The convictions carry a maximum of five years in prison and a 
$100,000 fine for each count. 
</P>
<P>
The partial verdict followed more than six weeks of testimony and 11 days of 
deliberations by the jury -- the longest deliberations in recent memory in 
Chicago's federal courts. The jurors apparently struggled not only with the 
complexities of the commodities trading business, but also with the 
prosecution's attempts to prove that there was a broad conspiracy to defraud 
customers on the trading floor. 
</P>
<P>
The trial of the three traders from the Swiss franc pit at the Merc was the 
first to result from the federal government's undercover probe into fraud and 
corruption on Chicago's two major commodities exchanges, which was first 
revealed in January, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
With at least four FBI agents posing as traders on the floors of both the 
Chicago Board of Trade and the Merc, the investigation resulted in indictments 
against 47 brokers, traders and a clerk on charges of fraud, conspiracy and 
racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
The trial before U.S. District Judge Ann C. Williams represented a major test 
of the ability of federal prosecutors to successfully use the Racketeer 
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, against defendants in 
white-collar criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
The government has already reached plea-bargain agreements with 18 of those 
indicted, including Mark Fuhrman and William Walsh, two traders from the Swiss 
franc pit who testified against Mosky, Scheck and Zatz. 
</P>
<P>
After this case against the three currency traders, trials against traders from 
the Japanese yen pit at the Merc and the soybean pit at the Board of Trade are 
scheduled to open in September. 
</P>
<P>
The key to the government's case against Mosky, Scheck and Zatz was the 
testimony of FBI Agent Randall Jannett, who for 10 months in 1988 worked 
undercover in the Swiss franc pit, posing as a trader named Randy Jackson. 
Jannett, who was given a seat on the exchange that was worth more than $300,000 
by the FBI in order to establish his cover as a "local trader," traded with 
Mosky and others, often tape recording their conversations. Jannett told other 
traders on the floor that he was a newcomer to Chicago who was being bankrolled 
by a "rich uncle" in South America. 
</P>
<P>
While Jannett testified in detail about trade after trade, jurors heard 130 
tapes recorded by Jannett of conversations with Mosky, Scheck, Zatz and other 
traders on the floor of the exchange. On many of the tapes, the traders could 
be heard talking quietly among themselves about trades in the midst of the 
clamor in the trading pit. 
</P>
<P>
Jannett testified that many of the conversations, dominated by the shorthand 
jargon of traders and nearly inaudible because of the background noise from the 
pit, represented the quiet talk of conspirators who were attempting to make 
non-competitive trades among themselves, bilking their customers by skimming 
their profits. Often, the traders used these illegal trades to cover their 
personal losses, Jannett said. 
</P>
<P>
In the government's opening arguments, Assistant U.S. Atty. Mark Pollack asked 
jurors to try to filter out the background noise from the Merc and "listen to 
the quieter, softer conversations that Jannett was listening to, in which the 
defendants were arranging secret, non-competitive trades." 
</P>
<P>
While the tapes were difficult to decipher, jurors were allowed to read written 
transcripts while they listened through headphones. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the illegal trades documented on the tapes and by Jannett's testimony 
were relatively small, however, and the profits were often only a few hundred 
dollars for each trade. But prosecutors argued that they were really just the 
tip of the iceberg and provided evidence that fraud was pervasive on Chicago's 
exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
In the government's closing arguments, Assistant U.S. Atty. Daniel Gillogly 
charged that fraud was "very much entrenched" in the commodities markets and 
that the brokers and traders who schemed among themselves relied on the complex 
nature of their business to hide their crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a shadow world down there (on the floor of the exchange) of brokers 
and traders who for years have relied on the fact that people didn't understand 
what was going on," Gillogly said. "There was a scheme to defraud in place down 
there that was very much entrenched, and very much systemic. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody knew how it worked," he added. "In prearranged trade after 
prearranged trade, there was a pattern of racketeering." 
</P>
<P>
But defense attorneys argued that Jannett simply didn't understand the 
complexities of the trading activity going on around him, and so didn't know 
that the quiet conversations taking place underneath the hum of activity in the 
pit really just represented traders double-checking with each other on earlier 
trades they had conducted. Blumenthal, who represented Zatz, charged that 
Jannett had been an inept trader and also had conducted an inept investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The defense also sought to dismiss the testimony of Fuhrman and Walsh by 
arguing that the government's case was built on witnesses who had already 
admitted their guilt. 
</P>
<P>
The audio tapes of the trades recorded by Jannett don't appear to clearly 
resolve the issue of whether the traders were double-checking earlier deals or 
were bilking their customers. In the midst of the fast-paced trading going on 
around them, the conversations are difficult to decipher, and much of what is 
on the tapes is left up to interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
In a few instances, in fact, the defense and prosecution provided the jury with 
conflicting transcripts of the tapes, presenting very different versions of 
what was being said.

SOVIET OFFICIALS SPLIT ON IDEA OF AID FROM WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Could Western billions bail out the beleaguered regime of Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev? 
</P>
<P>
"This is not Poland or Hungary, this is 300 million people," one skeptical 
Soviet economist said Monday, shaking his head at the daunting size of the 
task. 
</P>
<P>
What will probably be a prominent topic at the Houston summit of industrialized 
democracies -- Gorbachev's reported appeal to the West to give a boost to the 
reeling and shortage-plagued Soviet economy -- evokes conflicting feelings 
among Soviet movers and shakers, with some even recommending against accepting 
cash aid. 
</P>
<P>
"Economic help in the form of money to the Soviet Union is not needed," said 
Anatoly A. Sobchak, the progressive mayor of Leningrad. "If this money is put 
into the hands of government bureaucrats, it will not be used in the right way. 
. . . In no way should money be put into the hands of the bureaucrats." 
</P>
<P>
Though many Kremlin officials spoke squeamishly about even the concept of "aid" 
from the West, there was little dispute about the dire straits that the 
country's economy has fallen into after five years of Gorbachev's perestroika 
reforms, defined by one current Moscow joke as "when you're finally allowed to 
open your mouth but there's nothing to put in it." 
</P>
<P>
Panic buying recently caused salt and macaroni to disappear from Soviet stores. 
The Kremlin spent the equivalent of $500 million on food imports as shortages 
-- in the words of Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov -- left the market 
"destitute" and the citizenry increasingly disgruntled. 
</P>
<P>
The vastness of the rescue job needed and the relative modesty of the means 
under study are shown by simple arithmetic. West Germany is pushing for a 
Western aid package of more than $15 billion. Such "massive" aid would be only 
about $50 for each Soviet citizen. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials who spoke to reporters during the Communist Party congress 
inside the Kremlin said they would accept help from the West -- but only if no 
strings are attached. 
</P>
<P>
"To dictate conditions to such a country as the Soviet Union, a great power, is 
embarrassing," said Georgy K. Shakhnazarov, an aide to Gorbachev. "We aren't 
taking orders." 
</P>
<P>
Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev, in charge of the poorly performing 
agricultural sector, objected vehemently to assistance if it is predicated on 
Western-style economic changes "such as the move toward a free-market economy 
or private property," concepts that the orthodox Marxist has consistently 
opposed. 
</P>
<P>
But Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the foreign minister, seemed to be willing to offer 
guarantees that the Kremlin's reform course would continue, though he brushed 
off the U.S. demand for an end to the Soviet underwriting of Fidel Castro's 
Cuba as being a matter for negotiations with Havana alone. 
</P>
<P>
Help from abroad, Shevardnadze said Monday, "will undoubtedly help perestroika, 
democratization and modernization in our society." He said donor nations would 
also benefit from increased commercial contacts. 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, while chatting with journalists, Shevardnadze said he disliked 
the word pomoshch, or "aid," to describe what the West is considering. He 
referred instead to "credit, technical cooperation, personnel training, joint 
ventures and joint projects." 
</P>
<P>
For many people of Shevardnadze's generation, who were told when young that 
their country would overtake the United States in general prosperity within 
their lifetimes, even the slightest suggestion that they might appear to be 
going to the West hat-in-hand must be galling. 
</P>
<P>
"For 70 years, people were told that no cooperation was possible with 
foreigners, that every foreigner was a spy or an enemy," Leningrad Mayor 
Sobchak said. 
</P>
<P>
According to White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, Gorbachev made a 
plea for help from the Group of Seven countries now meeting in Houston in a 
letter received by President Bush last week. But "Vremya," state-run 
television's main news program, told viewers Monday only that the letter 
mentioned a "widening of economic cooperation" and made aid sound like an idea 
thought up by the West. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials interviewed gave varying wish lists for how to use Western 
help. 
</P>
<P>
Pavel G. Bunich, the economist who reminded reporters in the Kremlin that his 
country is much bigger and more populous than Poland or Hungary, said what the 
Soviet Union really needs is technical and management training, rather than 
imports of consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
Shakhnazarov, who presumably was relaying Gorbachev's thinking, said Western 
technology is wanted for the rapid construction of small-scale businesses to 
manufacture consumer products and food, as well as help in carrying out 
market-style reforms in banking, finance and management. 
</P>
<P>
The government official charged with finding a way out of the economic crisis, 
Deputy Prime Minister Leonid I. Abalkin, said the country needs to 
"immediately" buy consumer goods, develop food-processing plants and light 
industry and court foreign investment in industry. 
</P>
<P>
He said credits from the West would buy the Kremlin time to implement its plan 
for the transition to a "regulated market," a proposal that touched off a 
near-panic when it was made public in May and officials disclosed that it would 
mean an average doubling of food prices. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about credit to stabilize conditions; that's what we need," 
Abalkin said. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the Western leaders' decisions turn out to be, the magnitude of the 
steps needed to revitalize the Soviet economy were sketched by Sobchak. 
</P>
<P>
Farming and food-processing sectors in the Soviet Union now function so poorly 
that in the Leningrad region, a staggering 50% to 75% of the crops harvested 
never make it to market, rotting or disappearing somewhere in the food chain. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union's second-largest city, where more than 4 million people live, 
doesn't have a single drugstore where "a person can come in and buy any drug," 
the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
What are needed now are "real projects" for Soviet-foreign economic 
cooperation, like the construction of such a drugstore or a factory to make 
bricks, Sobchak said.

<P>
SUMMIT: AGREEMENTS ON SOVIET AID, GLOBAL WARMING AND TRADE ARE LIKELY TO SHAPE

<P>
Faced with the threat of divisive conflicts, President Bush and West German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl forged a series of tentative compromises Monday on the 
major issues facing the economic summit: aid to the Soviet Union, global 
warming and trade. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting privately in advance of the formal opening of the summit, the two 
leaders engaged in a high-stakes round of horse-trading that appears likely to 
shape the final declaration that the seven summit nations will issue at the 
conclusion of their meetings here Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The agreements are the most tangible result to date of the "special 
relationship" that aides to both men say Bush and Kohl have forged in recent 
months. 
</P>
<P>
The overall shape of the deal appears to give Kohl most of what he wanted on 
financial aid to the Soviets, which he has favored and Bush has opposed. In 
return, West Germany made concessions to the United States on trade and the 
environment, including a major pullback on global warming that deeply 
disappointed environmental activists here. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the Bush-Kohl special relationship aided by Germany's victory in the 
World Cup," said one senior Administration official, referring to the 
quadrennial soccer championship won Sunday by the West German national team 
over Argentina. "It never hurts to catch people when they're up." 
</P>
<P>
After formal welcoming ceremonies featuring 21-gun salutes and Army drill teams 
in colonial uniforms marching under a blazingly hot and humid Texas sky, the 
leaders of Britain, France, Italy, Japan, Canada, West Germany and the United 
States began their first summit sessions behind closed doors on the campus of 
Rice University. 
</P>
<P>
They followed the afternoon session with an elegant dinner and returned to work 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the proposed compromise worked out by Bush and Kohl, aid to 
the Soviet Union -- unpopular in the United States, especially with Bush's 
conservative supporters -- would be linked with the more politically palatable 
idea of aid to the new non-Communist governments of Eastern Europe, U.S. and 
West German officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The allies would create an umbrella aid program for nominally collective 
action, but each of the Western nations and Japan would be free to choose for 
itself which nations to help. Bush, an Administration official said, planned to 
present the idea formally to the full summit at the dinner meeting Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
On global warming, West Germany had been pushing for a summit declaration that 
would have committed the seven nations to "clear reductions" in emissions of 
carbon dioxide and other "greenhouse gases" that are considered the chief 
causes of a slow but ominous warming of the Earth's climate. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has opposed any such declaration, and, in the strongest public statement 
yet of the Administration's opposition, White House Chief of Staff John H. 
Sununu in the morning denounced as a threat to economic growth the efforts to 
mandate reduced carbon dioxide levels. 
</P>
<P>
"Any growth at all, then, would not be permitted," Sununu said. 
</P>
<P>
West German officials rejected that argument. Kohl had told Bush in their 
meeting that "there is no contradiction between global environmental protection 
and growth," West German Finance Minister Theodor Waigel told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
But in Monday's meeting, Bonn agreed to back away from the declaration that it 
had sought, settling instead for a joint plan by the industrial world to help 
Brazil preserve its Amazon rain forest. The vast rain forest ecosystem plays a 
major role in stabilizing carbon dioxide levels worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
West German officials provided the outline of the new arrangement to reporters, 
and American officials later confirmed it. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists, who had been counting on German support for a major effort 
to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, denounced the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a gross disappointment," said Daniel Becker, a spokesman here for 
the Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
Although preserving the Brazilian rain forest has been a major priority for 
environmentalists, the trade-off of strong measures to reduce carbon dioxide 
emissions in the industrial world is too high a price to pay, environmental 
activists here said, especially since it is not clear how significant the 
preservation effort would turn out to be. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and West German officials were meeting late Monday night in efforts to 
flesh out the details of the rain forest proposal and final compromise language 
on the overall issue of global warming. 
</P>
<P>
On trade, West Germany also made a concession, agreeing on a framework for 
negotiating reductions in agricultural subsidies that U.S. officials had 
favored. Agricultural subsidies have been the chief problem for negotiators in 
the current round of international talks aimed at reducing global trade 
barriers. 
</P>
<P>
To the Administration, farm subsidies and related programs have stood as a 
major barrier to the exporting of agricultural products to Europe and Japan by 
less-developed nations -- and by American farmers. Unless the industrialized 
nations are willing to open their agricultural markets to producers in other 
countries, it is argued, the poorer nations will be unable to buy the 
industrial products produced in Europe and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, failure to make progress on agriculture could set off protectionist 
retaliation among the less-developed nations. No less important to the 
Administration, such protectionism would prove costly to American farmers, who 
are among the world's most efficient producers and thus can profit from free 
markets for agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Aid to the Soviets dominated the Bush-Kohl meeting, as it has the public 
discussion before the summit, according to German officials. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl, said one official, emphasized to Bush that in the past "we spent 
tremendous sums to protect the world against Soviet expansion." Now, for "just 
a tiny fraction" of those sums, the Western nations can ensure a Soviet 
transition to democracy, the official quoted Kohl as adding. 
</P>
<P>
Under those conditions, aid "lies in our common interest," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
The West German proposal to link Soviet and Eastern European aid has grown out 
of West Germany's experience in the last few months of incorporating the East 
German economy, West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said. The 
economies are so intertwined that "you can't do it in Central Europe without 
aiding the Soviets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the proposal provides substantial political benefits. By 
linking aid to the Soviet Union with aid to Eastern and Central Europe, as the 
Germans are understood to have proposed, the summit would preserve the 
appearance of unity among the major industrial powers while giving Bush 
protection from conservatives who oppose any assistance to the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
On the environment, the summit had been heading for a major confrontation in 
which the United States would have been alone in opposing measures being sought 
by Kohl and other European leaders. 
</P>
<P>
At last year's summit, the leaders of the seven major industrial powers 
announced that they "strongly advocate common efforts" to limit emissions of 
carbon dioxide and other gases that are believed responsible for an apparent 
slow but ominous warming of the Earth's climate. 
</P>
<P>
Carbon dioxide is released whenever anything is burned. The use of oil, coal 
and wood for energy, coupled with the cutting of tropical forests, are believed 
to be the chief man-made causes of an increase in carbon dioxide production 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Kohl had been urging that the summit go much further. In a letter to 
the other six summit participants late last month, the text of which was 
released Monday, Kohl called for "internationally binding regulations" to limit 
carbon dioxide emissions "at the earliest possible date." 
</P>
<P>
The West German government, he noted, has pledged that by 2005 it will reduce 
Germany's production of carbon dioxide to a level 25% lower than current 
amounts. Britain, which has largely aligned itself with Germany on the issue, 
has made a somewhat less dramatic pledge, to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions 
at the 1990 level. 
</P>
<P>
But while the European sense of urgency on the issue has increased over the 
last year, the Bush Administration has headed in the other direction. Bush's 
major advisers, led by Sununu, insist that scientific evidence of the causes 
and effects of global warming are too sketchy to justify potentially costly 
actions to reduce the use of fossil fuels. 
</P>
<P>
Sununu and Richard G. Darman, the Administration's budget director, have both 
made public statements in recent weeks harshly critical of environmentalists 
for advocating positions that, they say, would stifle economic growth. The 
European emphasis on global warming is a result of "emotional responses" and 
the strength of environmentalist political parties, Sununu said in a Cable News 
Network interview Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, before the Bush-Kohl meeting, Sununu told reporters that "the words 
that people are seeking" for the final summit communique would damage both the 
United States and the developing nations of the Third World. "Any growth at all 
would not be permitted." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Sununu insisted, efforts to combat global climate change by focusing 
on human activities are misguided because "96% of the carbon dioxide that flows 
into the atmosphere comes from natural sources." 
</P>
<P>
Environmental activists were quick to denounce Sununu's statement, likening it 
to former President Ronald Reagan's well-known 1980 campaign remark about air 
pollution being caused by trees. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Sununu's statistics are technically correct: The vast bulk of carbon 
dioxide emitted into the atmosphere does come from natural processes, 
everything from the breath exhaled by every animal to the decaying of leaves on 
a forest floor. 
</P>
<P>
But over the ages, those natural emissions have been balanced by other natural 
processes that absorb carbon dioxide. What has changed has been a rapid 
increase in human activities that add to the carbon dioxide put into the 
atmosphere, along with a parallel reduction in nature's ability to 
counterbalance the increase. 
</P>
<P>
Trees and other green plants absorb carbon dioxide and give off oxygen, but 
worldwide deforestation has reduced the Earth's capacity to absorb carbon 
dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
The 4% of carbon dioxide coming from man-made sources that Sununu referred to 
has been enough to cause a noticeable increase in the levels of the gas in the 
atmosphere. Many scientific studies indicate that because carbon dioxide tends 
to trap heat, the result has been to warm the Earth, a process that eventually 
could cause dramatically damaging changes in sea levels, agriculture and 
weather patterns.

THE ICE MAN; 
</P>
<P>
HIS WORK HAS GRACED PARTIES, MOVIE SETS, WEDDING RECEPTIONS

As the mercury crept into the 80s one day last week, James Luff bundled up in a 
heavy jacket, rain pants, two pairs of gloves and insulated boots to go to what 
may be Orange County's coolest summer job: ice sculpting. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely a way to escape the heat," said Luff, who has been a 
professional ice sculptor for the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
While others flocked to the beaches to bask in the summer sun, Luff closed 
himself inside his freezer-studio in Costa Mesa and went to work on a 300-pound 
ice cube. 
</P>
<P>
As the temperature hovered at 16 degrees, Luff first took a lightweight chain 
saw to gently outline the figure he wanted to sculpt. 
</P>
<P>
"I can look and see what I want to carve inside it," Luff said. 
</P>
<P>
Then with sweeping strokes of the saw, he chopped away large chunks of ice and 
a pair of wings and the long neck of a swan began to emerge. Gradually, the 
swipes of the saw gave way to precision strokes as Luff defined the slope of 
the breast, the curve of neck. 
</P>
<P>
For the final touches, Luff used a pruning saw and a large fork to smooth away 
the rough edges and detail the feathers of his three-foot-tall swan. 
</P>
<P>
After several hours of work -- and one or two breaks outdoors to warm his hands 
and feet -- Luff's latest creation was ready to stand as a sparkling 
centerpiece for a party, where it would immediately begin to melt. 
</P>
<P>
Luff professes not to mind the ephemeral nature of his art. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel bad seeing it melt. I enjoy watching the people's reactions, the 
oooohs and ahhhhhs. . . ," he said. "It's like cooking a good meal for someone. 
They enjoy it. Then it's gone." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Luff has been dabbling in wood carving recently. "It would be nice 
to have something a little more permanent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Luff, 37, is one of few ice sculptors to make his own ice. 
</P>
<P>
Most carvers buy their ice from manufacturers who typically use a freezing 
system that circulates air through the water as it hardens. 
</P>
<P>
As the block freezes from the outside in, imperfections form, most noticeably a 
cloudy white core. 
</P>
<P>
Luff uses six specially designed freezers that circulate water though the block 
as it freezes, causing it to harden from the bottom. Without the air bubbles, 
the finished blocks of ice are as clear as crystal. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes three days to make a block of ice, but it's worth the wait," said 
Luff, who also sells his 40- by 20- by 10-inch blocks to other ice sculptors. 
</P>
<P>
Luff said he got hooked on ice carving while working as a cook in Vancouver, 
Wash., and saw a chef carving a block of ice for a buffet table centerpiece. 
</P>
<P>
"He showed me the tools . . . how to use them and told me to go to it. That was 
my first lesson. After that, I knew ice carving was what I wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
His works have graced the tables of parties, movie sets, business functions and 
wedding receptions. 
</P>
<P>
He created the swan centerpiece in "Beverly Hills Cop" and the mermaid in 
"Dragnet." 
</P>
<P>
He even sculpted a pair of lungs that were featured on the cover of a medical 
journal. 
</P>
<P>
By far the largest sculpture he did was a replica of the Egyptian Sphinx that 
used 90 blocks. The entire project cost about $18,000. 
</P>
<P>
In an average month, Luff carves between 30 and 40 sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
Most sell for a couple hundred dollars to several thousand dollars depending on 
their complexity and size. 
</P>
<P>
After completing his swan last week, Luff looked outside at the midday sun and 
admitted that the frigid environs of his studio are not always the place to be 
in summer. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting away from the heat is nice, but it also would be nice to enjoy the 
sunny days sometimes," he said with a smile.

LEGISLATURE: FAILURE TO AGREE ON A STATE BUDGET IS CHOKING FINANCIAL PIPELINE 
TO LOCAL LEVEL. NO PROGRESS IS REPORTED IN BREAKING THE STALEMATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The political impasse that has held up a new state budget has already hit with 
painful effect at the local level, but officials say things will get worse this 
week if welfare checks are held up. 
</P>
<P>
The worst is yet to come, for Gov. George Deukmejian and the Legislature are 
considering budget reductions in the range of $1 billion to $3.6 billion -- 
lasting cuts that will hit counties and human service programs the hardest. 
</P>
<P>
County officials from throughout the state have had big pieces of the state 
budget problem dumped squarely in their laps because of the bitter political 
fight between Deukmejian and Democratic leaders over a new $50-billion-plus 
state budget. Monday marked the ninth day that the state operated without a 
budget, thus lacking the authority to pay its bills. That means that the 
financial pipeline that counties rely on for some of their largest operating 
revenues has been shut off. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Controller Gray Davis announced Monday that he was ordering the 
immediate payment of $115 million in state bills to doctors, hospitals and 
others who contract with the state to provide medical services to the poor, 
those bills date back to June 8. Two subsequent payments have been held up, 
including a $176-million payment that should have been made Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The budget stalemate continued Monday with little progress. Although both the 
Senate and Assembly held floor sessions, neither considered tax or budget 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
A $198-million payment to cities and counties as their share of motor vehicle 
license fees will not go out today, as scheduled, because of the budget 
impasse. If there is no agreement by Thursday, the controller will not be able 
to distribute $330 million in sales tax money to local governments, or make a 
$119-million payment to Medi-Cal program providers, or a $139-million payout to 
counties for welfare grants to people on the Aid to Families With Dependent 
Children program. A day later, counties are owed $109 million from the state to 
help defray the cost of trial courts. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility exists that legal aid lawyers, and attorneys for counties 
themselves, will go to court in an effort to force the state to go ahead with 
at least the welfare payments. 
</P>
<P>
Davis seemed to invite such a suit: "In 1983, counties brought suit against the 
state and at least won a temporary restraining order. Clearly, that is an 
option available to them in 1990." 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties said they have enough 
county funds to cover this month's AFDC payments. 
</P>
<P>
But Tulare, Siskiyou and Yuba counties have already warned thousands of welfare 
recipients that they may not get their checks because the counties do not have 
the money. 
</P>
<P>
That is not to say they are the only ones complaining. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Chief Administrative Officer Richard B. Dixon said that 
"problems mount" each day the state fails to adopt a budget. "We have the 
cash," Dixon said. "But when we use our cash, we are losing interest income. As 
the year goes on, we will have less money to spend to meet our health and 
social service obligations." 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura County, the Board of Supervisors today is to consider a $2.5-million 
emergency loan to permit payments to about 8,000 welfare families. 
</P>
<P>
The budget crisis began to be felt locally July 1, when the controller held up 
paychecks for people providing in-home support care to ill and elderly shut-ins 
who qualify for state aid. People providing this service get around $4.25 an 
hour, the minimum wage, and are said to be ill-prepared to be able to cope with 
even a week's delay in their pay. The state sends checks directly to them. 
</P>
<P>
Lee D. Kemper, a lobbyist for the County Welfare Directors Assn., said that 
initially about 3,500 people were affected by the holdup of checks for in-home 
support service workers. If the impasse continues until Friday, paychecks for 
130,000 more people will be held up, Kemper said. 
</P>
<P>
Vaughn Jeffery, a spokesman for the San Diego County Department of Social 
Services, said: "San Diego County has 8,000 individual providers who care for 
10,000 disabled adults and senior citizens through In-Home Supportive Service. 
For some of these people it's a primary income and it's a direct hardship on 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Leaman, Orange County's director of social services, said he fears the 
state's failure to pay its bills may force many of the county's 5,000 IHSS 
workers out of business. 
</P>
<P>
"We're concerned about how long the providers are going to be willing to wait 
before they decide they'll have to eat and go out and get a job pumping gas," 
Leaman said. "It could force institutionalization of some elderly and disabled, 
which is a social tragedy, first, and also a more costly approach to service." 
</P>
<P>
On top of the IHSS payments, the state has delayed two major payments to 
doctors, hospitals and nursing homes that contract with the state to provide 
medical services to the poor under the Medi-Cal program. 
</P>
<P>
Lori Aldrete, a spokeswoman for the California Hospital Assn., said the state 
last Friday missed a payment of $176 million to Medi-Cal providers and owes for 
bills to have been paid June 22. 
</P>
<P>
John Henning, administrator at Continana Convalescent Hospital in San Diego 
County's National City, said the payments going out now for June's bills are 
coming just in the nick of time. 
</P>

In Orange County, Leaman said the holdup of checks comes at a time when fewer 
and fewer doctors are treating Medi-Cal patients. "They've been gradually 
dropping out and another black eye -- late payments -- is going to exacerbate 
the shortage," Leaman said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, county officials were worrying aloud about the day when the budget 
finally passes. 
</P>
<P>
Kemper said at least $700 million is in jeopardy, including specific cuts 
targeted to trim 42,000 people cared for under the IHSS program, reduce or 
eliminate child-abuse prevention and children's welfare services, roll back on 
funds going into mental health and hospital programs, and cut funds for family 
day-care licensing. 
</P>
<P>
On top of that, Deukmejian wants to cut counties $150 million across-the-board, 
and take another $25 million out of a specially created program designed for 
the poor who do not qualify for Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
In San Bernardino County, Supervisor Larry Walker was steaming. "This may well 
be the year that counties say to the state, 'OK, if we don't get the money to 
run these programs, then we'll shut them down,' " Walker said.

AVALON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have a friend who has come to Avalon at least once each summer since he was 
7. His parents brought him in the beginning, and the family stayed at the old 
Atwater Hotel, all five of them in one room. They rode around town in a 
squadron of bicycles-built-for-two, everyone sucking on saltwater taffy. 
</P>
<P>
He still comes here each summer, with his own family now, as a gesture to the 
old days. The great thing about Avalon, he says, is its total failure to become 
a clone of places like Newport Beach or Malibu. Avalon has somehow retained the 
genteel shabbiness of a tropical backwater. A Cartier store would be 
unthinkable in Avalon, and in all his years coming here, my friend says, he has 
yet to spot anyone driving a Mercedes. 
</P>
<P>
There are a number of reasons why Avalon never made it to the big time, but 
let's skip to the big one. It's water. There was never enough in Avalon. For 
years, boats hauled it over from the mainland, and then a small reservoir was 
built in the hills. But the perpetual shortage continued, and the last three 
years of drought only turned a bad problem into something worse. 
</P>
<P>
Without water, the big money didn't come to the island. This year alone, some 
80 building projects have been placed on hold because there is no water to 
supply them. When a fire breaks out in the city, it is fought with a mixture 
that is half brine. In every hotel room and every restaurant there are 
reminders not to waste. Avalon is now, and always has been, a captive of its 
minuscule water supply. 
</P>
<P>
And that is why the upcoming completion of a desalination plant in Avalon is a 
very big deal here. Going up at Pebbly Beach on the outskirts of the city, the 
plant is scheduled to open in December. It will be the first of its kind of 
California but certainly not the last. Santa Barbara is planning its own 
project and even Los Angeles is playing with the idea. 
</P>
<P>
The dream of converting sea water to drinking water is a very old one, of 
course, especially on dry islands. It has all the lure of alchemy. Here on 
Avalon, the desalination plant promises to break the yoke that has burdened the 
city for so long. With enough water, anything becomes possible. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the Pebbly Beach plant will not totally fulfill that dream. Its 
capacity is small. But already the Catalina Island Co., an arm of the Wrigley 
family that owns most of Avalon, has announced plans to build a second, larger 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, there is no limit to the promise offered by desalination. The only 
constraint is money. The Pebbly Beach plant will produce fresh water at a cost 
that is roughly nine times that of water on the mainland, meaning it will be 
very expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Is that price too high? The Pebbly Beach plant is proof that it is not. The 
people paying for the plant are the developers of a new condominium complex 
known as Hamilton Cove. Faced with the prospect that they would not be allowed 
to complete their project because of Avalon's chronic water shortage, the 
developers offered to pay for the plant and donate any excess production to the 
city. So the deal was struck. 
</P>
<P>
The people of Avalon have not missed its significance. Donna Harrison, a member 
of the city's planning commission, says the town regards the plant with "a 
certain underlying fear." 
</P>
<P>
"When we no longer have nature to provide the constraints, will the city be 
able to withstand the wave of greed?" she asked. Harrison is not sure about the 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
Already, the Catalina Island Co. says it wants to build three new hotels and 
more than 500,000 square feet of commercial space within the city over the next 
15 years. You could regard this plan as a long-overdue rehab of Avalon's 
seedier blocks. You could also regard it as the beginning of the end of Avalon 
as we know it. 
</P>
<P>
The truth is, no one knows which way it will go. Avalon people, as Harrison 
points out, like their city very much just the way it is. They will fight to 
keep it. These are people, after all, she says, who are willing to give up 
their cars to live here and putt-putt around in golf carts instead. 
</P>
<P>
The histories of small towns trying to stop or even slow down the arrival of 
the big money runs toward dismal failure. But I suspect there are a huge number 
of people rooting for Avalon. There's something consoling about a place where 
most hotel rooms still don't have phones. Where no one seems to have heard of 
California cuisine. And where you can still get some fine saltwater taffy.

REGIONAL REPORT THE DROUGHT; 
</P>
<P>
MANY CITIES SAVE WATER WITHOUT PENALTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
As the Los Angeles City Council prepares to vote Friday on a mandatory 
water-rationing ordinance, many Southern California cities already are 
conserving an average of 12% by using less stringent water-saving approaches, 
according to the giant Metropolitan Water District. 
</P>
<P>
From San Diego to Glendale, water officials reported that usage has dropped by 
8% to 16% under largely voluntary programs since officials asked residents four 
months ago to conserve water in the face of a fourth year of drought 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Even without rationing, Los Angeles' current program is one of the most 
successful, with consumption down 15.5% during June compared to the same month 
in 1986, according to the city Department of Water and Power. 
</P>
<P>
The success of voluntary programs -- and limited mandatory restrictions such as 
bans on daytime lawn watering and hosing down driveways -- has convinced the 
largest water agencies in the Southland that rationing is not necessary this 
year, according to interviews Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to use the carrot before the stick," said Carl Boronkay, general 
manager of the MWD, which serves 27 agencies stretching from Ventura to the 
Mexican border. "Save the stick if you think we can accomplish this without it 
. . . and I think we will." 
</P>
<P>
The MWD has asked water agencies to cut water use 10% this year to make up for 
a projected shortage in supplies. 
</P>
<P>
But water agencies have been using about 12% less, according to a MWD study 
obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, where water conservation is calculated and reported daily, the 
City Council voted in May to give voluntary methods a chance before seeking 
rationing. If residents citywide failed to achieve a 10% savings in a 60-day 
trial period, the city planned to adopt a penalty-based rationing system. 
</P>
<P>
In the first five weeks of that two-month period, residents have cut 
consumption by 15.8% compared to a five-year average of use that is adjusted to 
reflect population growth, according the city water department. 
</P>
<P>
"With a voluntary program we've gotten a lot of community support," said Chris 
Cameron, a spokesman for San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor. "If it was just 
another law, people would be a lot more negative about it." 
</P>
<P>
In Long Beach, city water department general manager Dan Davis said residents 
are conserving at about the 10% level, when figures are adjusted for population 
growth and weather changes. In addition, the city gets about 7% of its water 
supply from reclaimed sewage. 
</P>
<P>
"We're encouraged that the water conservation ethic is here," said Davis. "Long 
Beach has certainly done its part. . . . If everyone else does, we'll get 
through this year." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, like most other Southern California water officials interviewed, said he 
believes they can get through the year without rationing. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley has called on the MWD to follow his lead and encourage its members 
agencies to adopt rationing programs, but even Los Angeles' eight 
representatives on the MWD board of directors have ignored the mayor's call. 
</P>
<P>
So far, in this fourth year of drought, rationing has been implemented in only 
a few hard-hit areas of Southern California that have special water supply 
problems, such as Santa Barbara and San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
Many Central Coast cities not connected to the state water project have adopted 
rationing, and in the north, San Francisco implemented rationing several months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles would be the first city in the south with an ample supply of water 
for this year to adopt rationing. Initially, Bradley warned residents that if 
they did not cut use by 10%, they would face rationing. 
</P>
<P>
Since that first call in April, city residents have responded, according to 
figures complied by the DWP. Besides the 15.5% cut in June, water use dropped 
11.7% in May and 12.2% in April, compared to the same months in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But Bradley has pressed for rationing, arguing that residents will backslide 
once the issue drops off the front pages and evening news programs. "It will be 
impossible to keep up the steady drumbeat of publicity," said Mark Fabiani, 
Bradley's chief of staff. Besides, he said, if saving 10% is so easy, only 
those who are not cooperating will be snared by the program's surcharges. 
</P>
<P>
Under Bradley's proposal, residents would be limited to using 90% of the water 
they used in comparable periods of 1986 -- before the drought and 
city-sponsored conservation efforts began. 
</P>
<P>
Residents and businesses using more than their allotment would face a surcharge 
of $3 per billing unit of excess use, plus 15% of the water bill on the first 
violation. A second violation would cost $3 dollars per billing unit, plus 25% 
of the bill, and a third violation would boost the surcharge to $4 per excess 
billing unit and 75% of the bill. A billing unit is 748 gallons; the average 
family uses between 300 and 500 gallons a day. 
</P>
<P>
Implementation of rationing would cost more than $1 million and all residents 
would face a 9-cents per billing unit increase -- about $2 to the average 
residential bill -- to cover the costs of the program and the reduced water 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
With rationing, Fabiani said, Los Angeles will be better prepared than the rest 
of the Southland should the drought drag on into a fifth year. A 10% cut this 
year, he said, may keep the city from having to adopt a 25% rationing plan next 
year if the drought continues. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of rationing has kept the issue in front of residents and 
contributed to the high rate of conservation, Fabiani said. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the two largest Southland cities -- San Diego and Los Angeles -- 
have the highest rates of conservation and have achieved them through opposite 
approaches. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, Mayor O'Connor vowed not to allow rationing, arguing that 
residents would respond to a voluntary call. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles has carried the banner for mandatory rationing, arguing that it 
will be necessary in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
Boronkay of the MWD, which wholesales water to both agencies, said Monday, "We 
just want the goal accomplished. However that is done is OK with us." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
VOLUNTARY WATER CONSERVATION 
</P>
<P>
A Metropolitan Water District survey of 24 of its member agencies, including 
the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, found that voluntary water 
conservation has been running 12% below 1989 levels since the MWD first asked 
for cutbacks in March. 
</P>
<P>
The survey covers agencies that provide 50% of the water consumed in the 
Southern California region. 
</P>
<P>
Among the cities served are Los Angeles, Long Beach, San Diego, Irvine, Santa 
Ana, Anaheim, Pasadena, Glendale, Burbank, Riverside, Ontario, Thousand Oaks 
and Simi Valley. 
</P>

REPORT FAULTS OFFICIALS' RELIANCE ON FBI PLANES; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE DEPT.: THORNBURGH, SESSIONS TAKE THE AIRCRAFT FOR OFFICIAL TRIPS. THE 
GAO SAYS THEY COULD BE BETTER UTILIZED IN INQUIRIES; QUESTIONS COST.

<P>
Congressional investigators, in a report to be released today, question Atty. 
Gen. Dick Thornburgh's heavy reliance on FBI aircraft and pilots to transport 
him to official speaking engagements, meetings and field office visits around 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
The report by the General Accounting Office, Congress' watchdog unit, also 
suggests that FBI planes would be more effectively used in investigations 
rather than for carrying FBI Director William S. Sessions on official travel. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Bob Wise (D-W.Va.), who asked for the report, and the GAO agreed with the 
Justice Department-FBI contention that regularly scheduled airliners cannot 
satisfy the security requirements of the officials, both of whom have had 
threats made on their lives. 
</P>
<P>
But the GAO report, a copy of which was made available to The Times, faulted 
the Justice Department for not making a cost analysis of using private aircraft 
charters to transport the officials, and for instead concluding "intuitively" 
that government aircraft would be cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
"GAO's analysis also indicates that private aircraft services can meet the 
executives' requirements better than regularly scheduled airlines," the report 
said. "Thus, justice officials responsible for the executives' security should 
determine whether (private charters or leased aircraft) are satisfactory. If 
they are, private aircraft services should be used" under Office of Management 
and Budget requirements, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Dan Eramian, a department spokesman, said that a cost analysis by the 
department after the GAO completed its study found that Thornburgh's and 
Sessions' use of three FBI aircraft, all of which were seized in narcotics 
investigations, saved taxpayers $500,000 a year. Eramian declined comment when 
asked why the department had waited until the GAO study was completed before 
running its cost analysis. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Thornburgh and Sessions accompanying the report, Wise noted that 
the three aircraft they used were intended, under FBI policy, for law 
enforcement missions, including narcotics control and counterterrorism efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Wise added that the GAO found that the aircraft are used for executive 
transportation 53% of the time, 23% for investigative flights and 24% for pilot 
training and maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
In commenting on GAO's findings, Eramian responded as if the agency had 
questioned the frequency of Thornburgh's travel and not his reliance on FBI 
aircraft and pilots who are also trained as investigators. 
</P>
<P>
"The Department of Justice is a field agency, not centered in the District of 
Columbia," he said. "There are 93 U.S. attorneys' offices all across the 
country. The attorney general feels it's good policy for the general to visit 
the troops and see what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
During the period studied by the GAO -- August, 1988, through July, 1989 -- 
Thornburgh took 39 trips using government aircraft, usually accompanied by at 
least one staff member and an FBI security detail.

RESTAURATEUR 4TH TO TESTIFY HE SAW BARRY USE COCAINE;

An Iranian-born restaurateur testified Monday that Mayor Marion Barry 
repeatedly used cocaine over a period of years, starting in 1985 on the night 
that his Georgetown restaurant opened. 
</P>
<P>
The businessman, Hassan Mohammadi, was the fourth witness to say that he saw 
Barry use cocaine. He said that he furnished the drug to the mayor, in powdered 
form, on about 30 occasions. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling a dollar bill into the shape of a straw, Mohammadi showed jurors in 
federal court how he said Barry would sniff lines of cocaine while blocking off 
one nostril with his left forefinger. 
</P>
<P>
"He bent over the coke and he snorted," the witness said, as Barry's drug-use 
and perjury trial entered its fifth week. 
</P>
<P>
Barry, sitting at the defense table, grinned at jurors and spectators in the 
crowded courtroom during Mohammadi's demonstration with the dollar bill. 
</P>
<P>
Barry smiled again when Mohammadi testified that after using cocaine with 
another man in a private room above his restaurant, Barry had given a 10-minute 
speech to diners attending the grand opening of the restaurant, Pardi's. 
"Everybody had a good time," the owner told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by prosecutor Richard W. Roberts, Mohammadi acknowledged that 
in May he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess drugs and was testifying as 
part of his plea agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"Who was it you conspired with to possess cocaine?" Roberts asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Mayor," the witness replied. He said that based upon his cooperation, the 
government has agreed to recommend leniency at the time of his sentencing later 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
According to Mohammadi, another Iranian-born businessman, Samad Arshadi, 
provided the cocaine for Barry to use on at least two occasions in Mohammadi's 
restaurant and home. Arshadi, a former nightclub owner, will testify later for 
the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi testified that he and Barry both used cocaine several times on a trip 
to the Bahamas in November, 1987, shortly after he had delivered a small amount 
of the drug to the mayor in his City Hall office. He said that in February, 
1989, he lied to District of Columbia police investigators by telling them that 
he had no history of drug involvement with the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 14 charges on which Barry is being tried are three counts of perjury 
alleging that the mayor lied to grand jurors in denying under oath that he ever 
had used drugs with another former associate, Charles Lewis. Lewis testified 
earlier in the trial that he used cocaine with Barry and that both men had 
discussed how they could cover it up. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, a small-time drug dealer testified that federal investigators 
apparently have lacked interest in any of her customers except Barry. Lydia 
Pearson, a prosecution witness, gave this assessment under cross-examination by 
Barry's defense lawyer, R. Kenneth Mundy. 
</P>
<P>
"Did the FBI or the prosecutors ever ask about any other customers besides Mr. 
Barry?" Mundy wanted to know. 
</P>
<P>
"No, they did not," Pearson replied. 
</P>
<P>
The question seemed aimed at bolstering a defense contention that Barry has 
been singled out for prosecution by a largely white governmental power 
structure.

BATON ROUGE, La. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This state's Legislature may be on the wildest ride in its history. 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana, one of the most backward and depressed states in the country, now 
finds itself at center stage, due almost completely to the bills introduced in 
the Legislature during the last several months. 
</P>
<P>
First, there is the much-talked-about anti-abortion bill, which was passed by 
both houses of the Legislature, vetoed by Gov. Buddy Roemer, then passed again 
in revised form. The measure is the stiffest in the country and calls for a 
prison sentence of up to 10 years for anyone performing an abortion, except in 
the case of pregnancies caused by rape or incest, or to save the mother's life. 
</P>
<P>
As an example of how wild things have been, Rep. Carl Gunter -- during debate 
on the abortion bill -- went so far as to argue that there may be some merit to 
incest. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got to thinking, the way we get thoroughbred horses and thoroughbred 
dogs is through inbreeding," he said. "Maybe we would get a super-sharp kid." 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the matter of the flag burning measure. This one sought to change 
the law so that anyone found guilty of beating up a flag burner could be fined 
no more than $25. It was dropped at the last minute as the Legislature raced 
the abortion bill through. 
</P>
<P>
A third piece of legislation was a bill introduced by 
klansman-turned-legislator David Duke that would have weakened the state's 
affirmative action statutes. Another bill, passed last week, created the 
strictist anti-obscenity record-labeling law in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Constitution, in a recent editorial, suggested the state "appears 
to be doing just about everything possible to cultivate a reputation for being 
racist, sexist, backward and oppressive." 
</P>
<P>
Not the best of images for this state, already crippled by the oil bust and 
known as a place that has for generations tolerated corruption as a way of 
life. The Legislature's actions have brought on threats of boycotts and 
convention cancellations from a number of quarters and has apparently damaged 
New Orleans' chances of wooing the 1992 Democratic National Convention. 
</P>
<P>
There may, however, be a plausible explanation for this chaotic scene. Some 
observers here argue that the state's lawmaking body is merely in the midst of 
growing pains. "We are in the process of transition from a banana republic to 
an infant democracy," said political analyst and publisher John Maginnis. "I 
would take a situation like this over one in which the governor controls 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
For decades, Louisiana's governor ran the state like a feudal lord, passing out 
favors in exchange for loyalty. All that changed with the election of the 
reform-minded Roemer, whose no-nonsense personality grated on legislators 
accustomed to the backslapping ways of the past. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Roemer tried to order them around when he had little by way of 
patronage to hand out. As a result, lawmakers long accustomed to doing what 
they were told began striking back, sometimes in ways that seemed odd to 
outsiders. Add to that mixture the election of Duke last year from a white New 
Orleans suburb. 
</P>
<P>
"Some crazy things started to happen," said state Rep. Mitch Landrieux. Some of 
them, however, are not as peculiar as they might first appear. 
</P>
<P>
In the abortion issue, Landrieux and others contend that Louisiana, with its 
large Roman Catholic population, is a natural place for the passage of such a 
strict measure. 
</P>
<P>
Duke's affirmative action bill passed the House only because the vote came 
immediately after a bloc of black representatives withdrew their support for a 
state lottery, thus enraging white lawmakers. The bill was dead on arrival in 
the Senate. Despite the attention accorded him, Duke has yet to have a bill he 
introduced signed into law. 
</P>
<P>
Maginnis makes the case that while things may still be bad in Louisiana, they 
are not nearly as bad as they were before Roemer took office nearly three years 
ago. While legislators may look somewhat foolish at times, the word "corrupt" 
is no longer the adjective of choice to describe the state. 
</P>
<P>
"At least now when our politicians make the national news, it's for something 
they did wide out in the open," he said.

THE WHITE HOUSE / HEADHUNTER;

BUSH'S 'GATEKEEPER' STARTING OVER

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles G. Untermeyer has seen his White House office staff cut in half. The 
once unending telephone calls have been reduced to a relative trickle. He is no 
longer spending both weekend days in his office. 
</P>
<P>
In a city where a ringing telephone and stacked-up messages are signs of power, 
Untermeyer counts their absence as evidence that he has successfully fulfilled 
the initial mandate of his job. 
</P>
<P>
As assistant to the President and director of presidential personnel, 
Untermeyer -- known by his nickname "Chase" -- is the gatekeeper to the upper 
levels of the Bush Administration. If you want to work for the President of the 
United States, he's the guy to see. 
</P>
<P>
Don't let the bureaucratic nameplate or his formal and intense demeanor fool 
you. This is a man who just for the heck of it made his way from Asia to Africa 
and up the Nile to the no-man's land of southern Sudan in the midst of a civil 
war. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that life has finally quieted down in his suite of offices in the 
White House West Wing means that he has finally carried out the arduous task of 
filling the top 650 jobs in the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
NEW BEGINNING: Now that he's gotten the upper reaches of the government down to 
a vacancy rate of approximately 2%, he's about to start the job all over again. 
</P>
<P>
It's time for the Second Year Blues -- the time when his colleagues in the 
White House and in the senior positions of the Cabinet departments decide there 
must be life outside the rarefied atmosphere at the center of a young 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Some decide to give up the 12- and 14-hour days, the chauffeured cars, the 
constant feeling of being right in the middle of Something Very Important in 
Washington, D.C. However, the itch never becomes epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
"Two percent is about as low as it would ever get. People resign, die, get 
promoted to other jobs," said Untermeyer, a longtime aide to Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Already, a senior presidential aide -- Cabinet Secretary David Bates -- has 
left the White House for the relatively calmer existence of a lawyer in private 
practice in Washington. In addition, a mid-level White House aide -- Tim 
McBride, Bush's personal assistant -- is on his way out, nominated to be an 
assistant secretary of commerce. And a senior member of the National Security 
Council staff who has been a close presidential adviser on Soviet affairs is 
returning to Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
NEW TALENT: By one estimate before Bush took office, the new Administration 
would retain no more than 20% of the Ronald Reagan appointees. 
</P>
<P>
The new President, Untermeyer said in a recent interview, "wanted to make clear 
this was a new Administration, not Ronald Reagan's third term but George Bush's 
first." 
</P>
<P>
The marching orders, he said, were "to use the talent at hand but to create the 
freshness that comes from having new people in new places, new faces in old 
places, and old faces in new places." 
</P>
<P>
"The guidance I received was, the person who kept his job would be the 
exception rather than the rule," Untermeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
The result was that he came very close to hitting the original goal of keeping 
no more than 20% of the Reaganites. Of the Reagan Administration's political 
appointees who were in office when the 40th President left Washington on Jan. 
20, 1989, approximately 22% were retained in some capacity. 
</P>
<P>
EARLY CRITICISM: Untermeyer came under sharp criticism as the months of 1989 
dragged on and vacancies went unfilled. The problem in naming new people to 
take over the government offices, he has said, stemmed from the delays in 
checking out potential appointees -- examining their backgrounds for potential 
conflicts of interest or personal behavior that could prove embarrassing if 
brought to light in a confirmation hearing. 
</P>
<P>
If he could make one major change in the current approach to finding candidates 
for the myriad of assistant secretary positions, government commission jobs, or 
agency posts that he filled, it would be to begin the search before the 
presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
"The most logical thing to do would be to do personnel work a lot earlier. But 
that makes no political sense. It gives the opposition the opportunity to 
accuse you of being presumptuous," he said.

SUMMIT AN APPETIZING TASK FOR PRESS

<P>
As the economic summit has evolved over the last few days, a central theme of 
the occasion seems to have come down to this: What else is there to eat? 
</P>
<P>
This city, hoping to overcome the tarnished image brought on by the oil-bust 
years, is doing it up right in the gastronomic department, offering the 
visiting world press everything from seafood gumbo to barbecue. But perhaps the 
most impressive example of a desire to please began Monday at the dining area 
of the Brown Convention Center, which is serving as the press center. 
</P>
<P>
There, eight Japanese chefs imported from California are keeping a buffet going 
around the clock. The purpose was to satisfy the palates of Japanese 
journalists at the summit, but it was clearly the most popular buffet line. 
</P>
<P>
On another food note, there is already a long list of people who want to buy 
the china, crystal and silver supplied by Tiffany &amp; Co. for the state 
dinner at the end of the summit. 
</P>
<P>
The slogan here is "Houston's Hot," and it certainly is. But it didn't appear 
to faze the seven leaders of the summit nations. The temperature was running 
well into the 90s on Monday; the humidity was at equally stratospheric levels. 
While others wilted, though, the heads of government and their spouses managed 
to appear unfazed during the colorful opening ceremonies at Rice University. 
</P>
<P>
They had a secret. 
</P>
<P>
The reviewing stand on which they sat benefited from a bank of air conditioners 
hidden beneath it and blasting cold air up at them. Everyone else, of course, 
had to cope as best they could. 
</P>
<P>
The lights went out Monday when White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu was 
delivering a briefing. Sununu couldn't resist this query to the reporters when 
the lights went back on. 
</P>
<P>
"How many of you noticed?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
One thing people have difficulty fathoming about Houston is the lack of traffic 
in the downtown area, particularly after dark, when the sight of a car becomes 
a rarity because of the non-existent night life. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of like they dropped a neutron bomb," said a Washington journalist 
who had to drive for miles Sunday before he found an open drugstore. An Italian 
journalist was also puzzled. 
</P>
<P>
"Why are there no people on the street?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Still smarting over President Bush's declaration some time ago that he hates 
broccoli, the broccoli growers dumped 40 tons of the green vegetable near the 
site of the summit last Friday as a form of protest. Then some of Houston's 
most prominent chefs prepared broccoli dishes. 
</P>
<P>
And on Monday, a woman identifying herself as Miss Broccoli stood outside the 
convention center handing out reading material about its benefits.

KOHL BREAKS RANKS ON AGRICULTURAL SUBSIDIES; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE: THE WEST GERMAN LEADER GOES AGAINST THE REST OF EUROPE TO END THE 
IMPASSE ON PRICE SUPPORTS.

<P>
The crack in the longstanding impasse between the United States and Europe over 
farm subsidies Monday came when West Germany broke ranks with its European 
partners to support President Bush in his campaign to move the current round of 
trade expansion talks off dead center. 
</P>
<P>
For West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the desire to support the U.S. position 
on the politically sensitive agriculture issue appeared motivated by a desire 
to repay Bush for backing German unification earlier than any other leader and 
for Washington's willingness not to block Germany's move to provide massive 
support for the Soviet economy. 
</P>
<P>
While France is likely to continue to drag its feet when the trade talks resume 
later this month, the United States and Germany found common ground in a new 
paper by a negotiating group in Geneva that is now expected to serve as the 
starting point for a compromise between the major food exporters and the 
Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
"If we add some little things to this report and put some of the weights into 
different positions," a senior German official said, "this could be the basis 
to come to an agreement." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter also hinted at support for the 
document. 
</P>
<P>
"There are elements of the paper that we find objectionable," Yeutter told 
reporters. "But we see it as a very sound and sensible effort." 
</P>
<P>
That agreement is expected to enable the summit leaders to provide the impetus 
needed to spur their own trade negotiators to work out a settlement in the key 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has long emphasized that a breakthrough on the issue of 
subsidies for food production is necessary to prevent the collapse of the 
wide-ranging, multilateral trade negotiations that are due to reach a climax at 
the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Agriculture is the key to the overall success of the negotiations," Yeutter 
said. Bush is "making the point very forcefully. . . . This is the most 
important economic action the world will confront" this year. 
</P>
<P>
Echoing the U.S. position, the communique that the seven summit leaders will 
issue Wednesday is expected to declare that successful completion of the trade 
talks is the "highest priority on the international economic agenda" and is 
"essential for providing a framework for the economic integration of Eastern 
Europe and developing countries into the global economy." 
</P>
<P>
Still unsettled are the specific instructions that the leaders will give 
negotiators on the farm issue. The language preferred by the United States 
would call on all countries to make "specific policy commitments" to reduce 
farm subsidies in all three areas under discussion -- domestic farm supports, 
import barriers and export subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
The Europeans were seeking broader language calling only for commitments 
"encompassing all measures that affect directly or indirectly import access and 
export competition." 
</P>
<P>
What now seems likely is that the seven leaders will order negotiators to take 
the Geneva paper as a starting point. It proposes especially rapid reduction of 
export subsidies, conversion of import quotas to tariffs, which are easier to 
reduce, and a cap on overall domestic support. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, which stands to gain from knocking down export barriers to 
farm products and is backed by most other trading nations, still faces stiff 
resistance from the European Community over details of an overall agricultural 
agreement. Any significant change would mean difficult political and social 
problems for Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Europe have generally argued that any significant reduction in 
support for agriculture could unravel their nations' tightly knit social 
fabric, ruining many of Europe's small farmers and wreaking havoc in rural 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot apply free trade in agriculture," insisted Guy Legras, a top trade 
negotiator for the EC, the Brussels-based organization that unites 12 Western 
European nations. 
</P>
<P>
While the farm dispute was at the top of the agenda Monday, negotiators for the 
heads of government were working behind the scenes to forge agreements on 
environmental issues and on how to handle the issue of providing significant 
aid to the Soviet Union and the emerging democracies in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Economic summits, held annually since 1975, bring together leaders from the 
seven largest non-Communist industrial powers -- the United States, Japan, West 
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- to discuss a wide range of 
political and economic issues. 
</P>
<P>
In the high-stakes clash over agriculture, Bush was determined to find a way to 
have a successful summit without any major disagreements, while also firmly 
supporting U.S. negotiators in achieving a breakthrough as the trade talks go 
down to the wire this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Could the United States . . . be less stubborn and succeed?" asked U.S. Trade 
Representative Carla Anderson Hills. "The answer is no. Were we to make a 
concession and not get fundamental reform in agriculture . . . we would have 40 
nations get up and leave these negotiations."

SHAMIR'S CABINET EASILY SURVIVES 1ST NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE

Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Cabinet easily survived its 
first test of no confidence Monday when Parliament rejected five motions over a 
housing shortage and new Jewish settler guard units in the occupied West Bank 
and Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
A close vote had been anticipated in the 120-member Knesset, where a coalition 
headed by Shamir's right-wing Likud Party has a narrow majority of 62 seats. 
</P>
<P>
But following a five-hour debate, the five motions of no confidence were 
defeated, 60 to 51. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's motions focused on a housing shortage at a time when thousands of 
Soviets are emigrating to Israel. In the past month, hundreds of homeless 
Israelis have pitched tents in public parks to dramatize the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the agenda were motions against the government's recent decision to set 
up civil guard units in the occupied territories.

Thousands of anti-government demonstrators built barricades of paving stones 
and lighted bonfires in the capital Monday in defiance of a threatened police 
crackdown on a strike called by pro-Sandinista unions. 
</P>
<P>
A Sandinista union official and witnesses reported at least one person was 
killed by gunfire in clashes between government supporters and Sandinista 
sympathizers. The reports could not be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Managua's main streets were blocked, bringing the capital to a virtual 
standstill. The scene was reminiscent of the height of the 1979 revolution when 
the Sandinistas built roadblocks in their struggle to overthrow former dictator 
Anastasio Somoza. 
</P>
<P>
Police were dispatched Monday morning to restore order. The police force is 
still dominated by Sandinistas, and it was unclear how decisively it would 
intervene. 
</P>
<P>
A warning was broadcast every 30 minutes on state Radio Nicaragua saying police 
would act harshly against those causing disorder. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the labor unrest caused widespread disruptions throughout Managua. 
Electricity and water service were cut off to most of the city of about 1 
million residents. The capital's airport was closed by an air traffic 
controllers' strike. 
</P>
<P>
Mail service and operator-assisted phone calls have been suspended since last 
week due to the strike. 
</P>
<P>
Strike leaders claim that more than 80,000 public and private sector workers 
have joined the gradually spreading week-old walkout. 
</P>
<P>
The strike was called in part to protest what the unions say are massive 
firings by the government of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro. Workers are 
also demanding a greater voice in setting economic policy. 
</P>
<P>
Hopes that ran high when Chamorro took office 10 weeks ago have faded as 
Nicaraguans realized that the economic crisis and bitter political divisions 
would not disappear quickly. 
</P>
<P>
The government has said tough measures are needed to rescue the crumbling 
economy, including cuts in government subsidies, higher utility rates, 
privatizing state enterprises and the return of land confiscated under the 
Sandinistas.

KHASHOGGI ENDS CLAIM TO REAL ESTATE, ART; 
</P>

PHILIPPINES: IN EXCHANGE, RACKETEERING CHARGES STILL PENDING WILL BE DROPPED.

<P>
Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi, who was acquitted of fraud charges last week 
along with Imelda Marcos, has agreed to waive all personal claims to millions 
of dollars in art and real estate acquired from Mrs. Marcos and her late 
husband, former Philippine dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos, it was learned Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, federal racketeering charges still pending against him will be 
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
"My client is tired of being in our country's courts," attorney James P. Linn 
said, explaining the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement, reached Monday after negotiations between Linn and Assistant 
U.S. Atty. Charles LaBella, clears the way for proceeds from a sale of the 
property to go to the Philippine government. The costs of prosecuting Khashoggi 
and Imelda Marcos, an estimated $150,000, according to U.S. officials, also 
will be deducted. 
</P>
<P>
Khashoggi agreed to terms of the deal before jetting off to Houston, where he 
said he will be meeting friends attending the economic summit. He had delayed a 
return to Saudi Arabia until the last of his lingering legal problems here 
could be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Khashoggi called the settlement "another victory for us." However, it also 
represented a victory of sorts for the Justice Department, which had sought to 
seize the same properties under forfeiture rules in its unsuccessful 
racketeering prosecution of Imelda Marcos, who was Khashoggi's co-defendant. 
</P>
<P>
Both won acquittals last week, ending a three-month trial. Marcos was cleared 
of all four fraud, racketeering and conspiracy counts. 
</P>
<P>
Khashoggi was acquitted of two mail fraud and obstruction of justice counts. He 
was not prosecuted at that time on racketeering and conspiracy charges under 
terms of a limited extradition agreement with Switzerland that allowed 
Khashoggi to stand trial in the United States. Those charges could have been 
reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecution attorneys contended that the Marcoses had acquired art and real 
estate with funds looted from their nation's treasury. They also charged that 
Khashoggi aided their attempts to conceal that ownership and to evade court 
orders freezing the assets. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers argued that the Marcoses bought paintings and property either 
with their own private funds or as investments for the nation and that it was 
properly sold to Khashoggi. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Monday's settlement seemed to give a belated boost to the 
prosecution's view of the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the agreement was Khashoggi's claim to ownership of four Manhattan 
skyscrapers with a value estimated from $5 million to more than $30 million. He 
agreed to assert no personal claims on the buildings that were at the center of 
the criminal case against him and Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
Other claims to ownership of the buildings, including one by a fugitive 
business associate of Khashoggi, still are being contested. 
</P>
<P>
Khashoggi also renounced his claims to 28 paintings, some of them by old 
masters, estimated to be worth more than $6 million. That agreement apparently 
clears the way for the paintings to be auctioned soon. 
</P>
<P>
The financier also signed over his personal claims on a $2-million house in 
Beverly Hills formerly owned by actor George Hamilton. Philippine officials 
contend that Hamilton was a front for Imelda Marcos and that the house was 
secretly purchased with government funds. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Khashoggi never claimed any rights to that property," attorney Linn said. 
"But he was willing to sign a quit claim for the Empire State Building if it 
made everybody happy."

reporter serving a six-month jail term for refusing to disclose the name of a 
confidential source. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, by a 7-2 vote, rejected an emergency request by reporter Brian 
Karem of KMOL-TV in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
Justices William J. Brennan Jr. and Thurgood Marshall voted to grant Karem's 
request that he be freed pending his appeal of the judge's contempt order that 
led to his jailing. 
</P>
<P>
Karem was jailed on June 27 after refusing to disclose the identity of a source 
who helped arrange his telephone interview last year with a jailed murder 
suspect, Henry Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez is charged with fatally shooting San Antonio Police Officer Gary 
Williams in March, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys in the murder trial of Hernandez and his brother, Julian, have said 
that they need to know who arranged the interview to assure a fair trial and 
determine whether the interview should be admitted as evidence. A law 
enforcement official has said that he has identified the source as a cousin of 
Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Society of Professional Journalists called Sunday for Karem's 
release and commended the reporter and his station "for their dedication and 
willingness to stand by the principles in which we believe . . . ."

SIMPLE TEST WOULD HAVE FOUND FLAW IN HUBBLE TELESCOPE; 
</P>
<P>
SPACE: NASA CHIEF SAYS THE RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE CHECK WAS NEVER PERFORMED. IT 
MAY HAVE BEEN A VICTIM OF COST OVERRUNS.

<P>
A routine, relatively inexpensive test would have caught the error that has 
crippled the $1.5-billion Hubble Space Telescope, but the test was never 
conducted, the head of the nation's space agency said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
If the test had been carried out, the telescope would not have been launched 
into orbit 381 miles above the Earth with an optical system that is no better 
than ground-based telescopes. "But, in fact, we never did such a test," Rear 
Adm. Richard H. Truly, administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration, said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
The test, involving the reflection of light off the telescope's mirror, would 
have been far simpler than an ambitious effort to test the Hubble as a total 
optical system before launch -- an effort that other NASA officials have said 
would have cost more than $100 million. Truly said there is little doubt that 
the smaller test, costing no more than "several million dollars," would have 
found the flaw. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is not known why the test was never conducted, Truly suggested that 
the manufacturer of the Hubble's optics may have been more concerned about 
building a mirror that was perfectly smooth than one that was perfectly shaped. 
NASA could have ordered such a test, but the telescope was running hundreds of 
millions of dollars over budget, and the agency has conceded it cut back on 
some testing to save money. 
</P>
<P>
The flaw in the Hubble's optical system is known as "spherical aberration." It 
occurs whenever a mirror in a telescope is not ground to the right shape. 
Experts believe the Hubble's 94-inch primary mirror is slightly flattened near 
the outer edge, causing light that hits that region to bounce back at a 
different angle from the rest of the mirror, blurring the image. 
</P>
<P>
The mirrors were built by Perkin-Elmer Corp., now Hughes Danbury Optical 
Systems of Danbury, Conn. Company officials, who have refused all requests for 
interviews, declined to comment on Truly's statements. 
</P>
<P>
In discussing the failure to perform the test, Truly acknowledged that what is 
clear today may not have been so clear nearly a decade ago when the mirrors 
were built. Although the test almost certainly would have detected the flaw, 
Truly said that if he had been the NASA administrator a decade ago, "I'm not 
sure that I would have decided to do it" either. 
</P>
<P>
Truly indicated that the test may not have been considered essential at the 
time because engineers were more concerned about achieving the correct 
smoothness of the mirror than grinding it to the right curvature. Shaping a 
mirror is routine compared to the challenge of manufacturing a mirror that is 
smoother than any ever built. 
</P>
<P>
"They must have believed the curvature was proper and it was the smoothness 
that was the tougher requirement to make," Truly said. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of smoothness, the eight-foot mirror had to be nearly perfect. There 
is every indication that the builders achieved that level of performance. The 
mirror is so smooth that if it could be magnified to the diameter of the Earth, 
its highest peak would be no more than five inches tall. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that degree of smoothness, the Hubble's optical system is virtually 
useless because the mirror is not shaped right and the images the telescope 
produces are fuzzy. Why that happened no one knows for certain, and there are 
at least two committees, one headed by Lew Allen, director of the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory, trying to determine what went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Truly said the flaw could have been caught with a fairly simple test. 
</P>
<P>
He said the test would have required the construction of "some sort of test 
optics" that would bounce light off the completed mirror. 
</P>
<P>
"The reflection of that light would have come back depending on the curvature 
of the mirror," he said, and the kind of flaw that has caused Hubble's present 
problems would have clearly shown up. 
</P>
<P>
Truly said he was basing his comments on casual discussions with some of the 
experts involved in various investigations, rather than on a formal conclusion 
by the investigating panels. The embattled space agency has been rattled by a 
rash of recent problems with various programs, especially the Hubble Space 
Telescope, advertised as the most revolutionary astronomical instrument in four 
centuries. 
</P>
<P>
"This is turning into a criminal witch hunt instead of a technical probe," he 
said of news reports concerning the telescope. He was particularly miffed by 
reports concerning the failure of NASA to use existing military facilities to 
test the Hubble as a complete optical system. 
</P>
<P>
"Just a molecule of dust would have been severely detrimental" to the 
telescope, which is designed to study the universe at shorter, ultraviolet 
wavelengths in addition to visible light. Because of its shorter wavelength, 
ultraviolet light is particularly sensitive to contamination. 
</P>
<P>
Other experts have contended that it was not necessary to test the telescope as 
a complete unit, because if the proper tests had been done on its many 
components, flaws like the one that has crippled the Hubble should have been 
detected. 
</P>
<P>
"In principle, you could test the telescope without putting the mirrors 
together," said Harland Epps of UC Santa Cruz, one of the nation's leading 
telescope designers. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't fault (NASA)" for testing the components separately instead of as a 
unit, Epps added. 
</P>
<P>
However, somewhere along the way, someone working on the Hubble made what Truly 
described Monday as "a simple mistake," and either got a measurement wrong or 
failed to follow directions. Until Monday, only a handful knew that a test that 
would have caught the mistake had never been carried out. 
</P>
<P>
Who dropped the ball? 
</P>
<P>
The manufacturer was required to build the mirrors to certain specifications, 
and that performance required adequate testing. NASA was required to certify 
that adequate testing had been carried out before accepting the mirrors from 
the manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
"The (investigative) teams really have not gotten to the bottom of this," Truly 
said.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS GOVERNOR; 
</P>
<P>
WILSON EXPLAINS SHIFT ON POT PENALTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Pete Wilson on Monday received an apt reminder of the dangers of resuscitating 
an age-old issue to rally new generations of campaign troops: Voting records 
don't always play along. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, for example, the Republican gubernatorial candidate renewed his call 
for California to recriminalize marijuana, turning simple possession of small 
amounts of marijuana back into a felony. Since 1976, marijuana possession has 
been a misdemeanor punishable by a $100 fine. 
</P>
<P>
But in that attempt to ride the substantial anti-drug sentiment of the 
electorate, Wilson had to answer one touchy question -- why he, as a state 
assemblyman in 1968, voted to give judges the discretion to impose misdemeanor 
penalties on those convicted of marijuana possession, rather than being 
required to invoke tougher felony strictures. 
</P>
<P>
The vote, Wilson said Monday, "has proved to be a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
The senator said he voted for the 1968 bill because he was concerned at the 
time that young and casual marijuana users might have their lives ruined by a 
felony drug conviction. 
</P>
<P>
"The rationale at the time, which I think was commonly accepted, was that 
marijuana is not in the same category with the dangerous controlled substances 
-- which it is not, no one is disputing that. And that we are not eager to 
blight anybody's life and will leave it to the discretion of the judge," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were trying to achieve a sobering penalty for a young user without creating 
the kind of criminal record that would be a serious problem for him on through 
life," Wilson added. 
</P>
<P>
But that was then; this is now. Now, the Republican nominee said, he believes 
that such a law sends a mixed message to youngsters who may be tempted to 
indulge in drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson also noted that pharmacologists and police agencies have in the 
intervening two decades seen stronger marijuana introduced and have come to see 
the drug as a first step for people who become addicted to more dangerous 
substances. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at the history of most drug users, most of them began with pot. It 
is the gateway drug," he said. "It is itself far less dangerous -- no question, 
no dispute about that." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's change of heart on the issue of how to handle drug convictions is 
hardly isolated. The bill he supported two decades ago was sponsored by another 
Republican and signed into law by then-Gov. Ronald Reagan, whose wife, Nancy, 
was later to personify the "just say no" approach to preventing drug abuse. The 
bill also toughened the law on possession of LSD, making it a felony. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the discretionary elements of the bill were backed by police 
officers and district attorneys, who argued that the mandatory felony 
conviction was such a strict sentence that judges and juries were acquitting 
first-time users rather than convicting them. The ability to convict on a 
misdemeanor level, they argued, would actually raise the number of convictions. 
</P>
<P>
Drug abuse and the tightening of state laws hammering drug sellers have been 
strong elements of Wilson's general election campaign for governor, as he seeks 
the support of California voters concerned about crime.

STALLED BUDGET HINDERS CARE FOR DISABLED;

<P>
While lawmakers squabbled Monday over a new state budget, Lolly Birlin went 
grocery shopping with money she borrowed from a friend. 
</P>
<P>
Things are always tight, said Birlin, a 42-year-old Ventura woman. But the last 
nine days have been especially trying. 
</P>
<P>
She receives $1,150 at the beginning of each month to take care of her severely 
disabled daughter, Jalina, 14. This month, the state check never came. 
</P>
<P>
"The cupboard was definitely bare," Birlin said Monday after spending the $50 
she borrowed. "What I got will last us about a week." 
</P>
<P>
For Birlin and hundreds of other Ventura County residents, the state's budget 
stalemate can only be measured in such terms. Each day that a compromise eludes 
the Democratic Legislature and Republican Gov. George Deukmejian brings more 
hardship and uncertainty, county social workers say. 
</P>
<P>
Paychecks to people who provide in-home care for 1,350 disabled county 
residents -- often their friends and family -- have been delayed. And, if the 
state budget is not pared and balanced this week, 8,000 local families on 
welfare may also miss their mid-July checks. 
</P>
<P>
The county Board of Supervisors will decide today whether to approve a 
$2.5-million emergency loan to make those Aid to Families With Dependent 
Children payments July 15. 
</P>
<P>
Other hardships created by the state's delay are seen mostly by city and county 
budget analysts. Hundreds of thousands of dollars collected by the state in 
sales taxes and motor vehicle fees are overdue. At the county Public Social 
Services Agency alone, about $700,000 to pay for administration of state 
programs has not arrived, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The human face of the budget crisis is best seen in the In-Home Supportive 
Services Program, which Birlin depends on. She and hundreds of others earn 
subsistence wages by helping disabled people stay in their homes, said program 
coordinator Shirley Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"At $4.25 an hour, these people are pretty much living hand-to-mouth anyway," 
Bush said. "It's very unfortunate they have to go this long without their 
money." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said she knows of no disabled person who has been left without care. "But 
we are starting to run into hardship cases, where people have quit their jobs 
to take care of family members, and this is their sole source of income." 
</P>
<P>
Calls for help began last week, Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
"At first they were satisfied that the budget would be signed soon, but now 
they're angry," she said. "And there isn't much we can tell them. They can't 
understand why the government is picking on the poor and the elderly. The 
governor's office should realize that these people need their money." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said her office began referring complaints to the governor last week. "But 
most 
</P>
<P>
of them don't have the money for a phone call," she said. 
</P>
<P>
An outraged Birlin said she called anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Birlin, whose $1,150 state check makes up the bulk of her income, said she 
called county officials and state Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) a week 
ago Monday. The next day she phoned Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them, 'I can't believe the governor would let his people live like 
this,' " she said. "I told them, 'I have two children I have to feed, my 
husband just died.' The man in the governor's office said, 'Unfortunately, it's 
people like you that suffer the most, but there aren't any emergency funds.' He 
told me to call David Roberti and Willie Brown." 
</P>
<P>
It was futile, she decided, to try to reach Roberti or Brown, majority leaders 
of the state Senate and the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really angry," Birlin said. "The next day was the Fourth of July, and all 
these lawmakers were going home with their families and planning big picnics of 
fun and games. But I don't have anything. The people who can't defend 
themselves are the ones that get cut off." 
</P>
<P>
A college-educated family counselor, Birlin has personally cared for her 
quadriplegic and mentally retarded daughter for years, but her situation turned 
desperate last August when her psychologist husband, Jerry, died suddenly. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, she has raised Jalina and a second daughter, 16-year-old Jennifer, 
by herself. 
</P>
<P>
Now her rent is overdue, her phone may be disconnected and she has enough food 
to last a week. "I can't understand how this could happen."

SUIT CHALLENGES DEVELOPERS' ROLE IN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICKI TORRES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The practice of allowing developers to pick their own consultants to prepare 
environmental impact reports could be abolished statewide if a lawsuit brought 
by opponents of an Altadena housing project succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
The Friends of La Vina, a group opposed to the 272-unit housing project in the 
San Gabriel Valley that has won county approval, filed a lawsuit in January 
charging that the county policy of allowing developers to hire those who 
prepare the environmental reports constitutes a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
The case is the first legal challenge to a practice in place since the 
California Environmental Quality Act was passed in 1970, say land-use 
attorneys, environmentalists and planners familiar with the law's regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting a growing concern about the issue raised in the lawsuit, many 
California cities and counties already have changed their policies and no 
longer allow developers to select the consultants for environmental impact 
reports, according to an official with the American Planning Assn. The City of 
Los Angeles, meanwhile, is considering making such a change in its procedures. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit sparked by the La Vina project is the second recent legal challenge 
focusing on the county's handling of environmental impact reports. Opponents of 
the Paramount Ranch development in Agoura filed suit claiming that the county, 
in approving the project, relied too heavily on environmental reports submitted 
by developers and failed to conduct an independent review. A judge Friday 
rejected those arguments and ruled against the foes of the Agoura project. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles attorney Deborah Bucksbaum, who filed the La Vina lawsuit, makes 
similar complaints about the county review process, but also contends that 
county planning officials violate the Environmental Quality Act at the very 
start of the report process by allowing developers to contract with consultants 
for the environmental studies. 
</P>
<P>
"No one's challenged them and no court's ever told them they can't, but they're 
really not allowed to do that" under the law, Bucksbaum said of county 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Bucksbaum intends to argue in Los Angeles Superior Court later this month that 
the state's Environmental Quality Act requires cities and counties to ensure 
the objectivity of environmental impact reports by preparing them with their 
own staff or hiring consultants to do them. In both cases, developers would pay 
for the report. 
</P>
<P>
County officials reject Bucksbaum's interpretation of the environmental act and 
stand by their practice of accepting reports directly from developers. They 
contend that past court rulings and the environmental act's guidelines clearly 
allow developers the right to submit information to public agencies -- 
including environmental impact reports by consultants they have picked and paid 
for. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the procedure we use and we believe it is in full compliance" with the 
law, said Richard Weiss, senior deputy county counsel. 
</P>
<P>
Pam Holt, the county's supervising regional planner, acknowledged that under 
the procedure the county sometimes receives environmental impact reports that 
have obvious bias. "I won't lie to you, we have received EIRs that sound like a 
sales brochure for the project," he said. "We say, 'Nice try but that won't 
work.' " 
</P>
<P>
But Holt said the county relies on a review process by county planners and 
staff from other departments to ensure objectivity for the final version of the 
reports. The review process and public hearings eliminate bias from the 
developers' environmental impact reports, Holt said, because "there are just 
too many people who get their shots at it . . . there are so many checks and 
balances." 
</P>
<P>
Darlene Phillips, a private attorney representing the county in the La Vina 
case, agrees. "The issue is not so much who prepares the environmental impact 
report as the adequacy," Phillips said. "The court has said as long as there is 
an existing independent review, it is satisfactory." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the outcome of the lawsuit over the La Vina project, many cities 
and counties have grown sensitive in recent years to the appearance of conflict 
of interest when developers chose their own consultants, said Al Herson, vice 
president of the California Chapter of the American Planning Assn. in 
Sacramento. Because of this sensitivity, Herson said, the trend has been for 
cities and counties to take control of the selection process. 
</P>
<P>
Of 515 cities and counties statewide, about two-thirds in Northern California 
and half in Southern California now select and contract directly with the 
consultants, ending the developers' choice in the matter, Herson said. 
Developers simply reimburse cities and counties for the completed reports, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an appearance problem," Herson said. "The consultant is supposed to be 
objective and it constitutes an appearance of conflict of interest if he's 
working for the applicant." 
</P>
<P>
City of Los Angeles planning officials are contemplating such a change out of 
concern that developer-issued environmental documents are not trusted by 
environmentalists and homeowners and that the review process takes too long. A 
report analyzing practices used in 30 other California cities is due soon.

ACTION PLAN TAKES AIM AT CALIFORNIA'S BEACH TRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Concerned that California's beaches are being ruined by rubbish, a group of 
environmentalists, educators, business leaders and government officials called 
Monday for mandatory education courses on the environment and broadened powers 
for the state Coastal Commission to clean up storm drains. 
</P>
<P>
"California's trashy coastal areas have become a death trap for wildlife, a 
danger to human health and safety and an economic burden for coastal 
communities," said Jill Kauffman, Pacific Coast regional director for the 
Washington, D.C.-based Center for Marine Conservation. "We are tired of this 
needless destruction of California's resources." 
</P>
<P>
The recommendations were included in an 89-page "action plan" released Monday 
at press conferences in Los Angeles and San Francisco by the California Marine 
Debris Steering Committee. The group was formed last year by the nonprofit 
conservation center to further review the scope of marine pollution documented 
in a nationwide study. 
</P>
<P>
The study analyzed 3 million pieces of debris collected and recorded by 65,000 
volunteers in 25 states and territories as well as portions of Mexico and 
Canada. It concluded that garbage, particularly plastic and plastic foam, is 
killing marine life at an alarming rate. 
</P>
<P>
Plastic foam cups, for example, are often mistaken for food by sea gulls and 
other birds that ingest them and choke on the particles. Grocery and vegetable 
bags are confused with jellyfish and transparent plankton by a variety of sea 
animals, including whales, dolphins and turtles. The creatures eat the bags and 
are unable to digest them. 
</P>
<P>
The plan released Monday came as the city of Los Angeles' Board of Public Works 
recommended a proposal to tax homeowners and commercial property owners for 
improvements to city storm drains that empty into Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed tax would cost the average homeowner in Los Angeles about $2 this 
year to pay for a $4.2-million pilot program at the Thornton Avenue drain in 
Venice and the Ballona Creek Treatment Facility near Marina del Rey, where city 
engineers would collect storm-drain runoff for filtration. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which the board voted to send to the City Council and Mayor Tom 
Bradley for approval, would serve as an interim program until the council and 
mayor agree on a comprehensive effort to control storm-water pollution 
citywide, said Philip Richardson, an engineer with the Department of Public 
Works. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a nominal charge, and hopefully it will be palatable to the council," 
Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Pacific Palisades, supporters and authors of the 
marine debris action plan sought to dramatize their cause by littering table 
tops and floors with plastic foam cups, soda cans, plastic straws, potato chip 
bags, hamburger wrappers and plastic grocery bags. Kauffman said the debris was 
collected Sunday during a 15-minute stroll on Santa Monica beach. 
</P>
<P>
"A coffee cup from a fast-food place in Glendale thrown on the ground is very 
likely to enter the marine environment at some point in time because presently 
the storm-drain system has no checks other than some grates at the entryway," 
said David Lederer, who represented the environmental group Heal the Bay on the 
steering committee. 
</P>
<P>
Among the recommendations, the plan calls for:

* Stricter enforcement of state litter laws on beaches and new legislation 
requiring more trash bins. 
</P>
<P>
* Economic incentives for manufacturers to reduce product packaging and produce 
environmentally safe and recyclable products. 
</P>
<P>
* Questions about the environment on state achievement tests in addition to 
environmental courses as a graduation requirement in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
* A statewide public campaign to discourage littering and encourage compliance 
with the Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act, which bans the 
dumping of plastics at sea.

"Maybe the kids can pull it out," said Coastal Commissioner Gary Giacomini, 
referring to the plan's emphasis on education in schools. "We hope this spreads 
like wildfire. We are convinced it will." 
</P>
<P>
Kauffman and others acknowledged that the recommendations will need support in 
Sacramento to have any significant effect on the state's marine debris problem. 
She said the center has been in touch with several legislators, but has put off 
its major lobbying effort until after the November election.

John Glidden, chief of staff for state Sen. Becky Morgan (R-Los Altos Hills), 
who was represented on the steering committee, said the senator intends to 
introduce legislation early next year to enact "the best ideas" in the action 
plan.

UNION CRITICIZES CONTRACT OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A union representative for about 200 employees of the Ventura County Community 
College District, who have been working without a contract since July 1, said 
Monday that union leaders are unhappy with the district's latest contract 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Cross, field representative for the local chapter of the Service 
Employees International Union, said the union is dissatisfied with salary 
increases and benefits offered by the district. 
</P>
<P>
The union represents secretaries, librarians, laboratory technicians, 
maintenance workers and other classified employees. The three-year contract 
currently under negotiation would affect more than 400 employees at Moorpark, 
Oxnard and Ventura colleges, although only half of those workers are 
dues-paying union members. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Pauley, the district's associate vice chancellor for personnel and one of 
the district's chief negotiators, declined to comment Monday on details of the 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
But Cross said the offer includes a 3% raise, effective immediately, another 3% 
raise next January, and a 4% salary increase next July. However, he said, the 
union is seeking a 4% raise immediately, a 3% increase next February and a 
negotiable increase in July, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Another sticking point is a district proposal to put a $445.70-a-month cap on 
health insurance premiums, Cross said. If premiums increase beyond that amount, 
employees would have to pay the difference. "People are not happy about that," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two other college district employee groups, the 390-member teachers group and a 
supervisors group, have also been working without contracts since July 1, 
Pauley said. The district is also negotiating with those groups. ADRIANNE 
GOODMAN

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FRUSTACIS SETTLE SUIT AGAINST INFERTILITY 
CLINIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Against the wishes of the doctor accused of malpractice, Patti Frustaci, a 
Riverside woman who gave birth to the nation's first septuplets in 1985, and 
her husband, Sam, have agreed to settle their suit against the infertility 
clinic that treated her, representatives for both sides said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the settlement will not be revealed until it is made final and 
recorded in Santa Monica Superior Court today. 
</P>
<P>
The Frustacis allege infertility specialist Dr. Jaroslav Marik did not properly 
monitor a powerful fertility drug, leading to physical and developmental 
impairment of the septuplets. Only three survive. 
</P>
<P>
Marik denies the allegations and has strenuously objected to any settlement 
discussions, which went on without his consent, a highly unusual occurrence in 
malpractice cases. Browne Greene, the Frustacis' attorney, said Marik will be 
dismissed as a defendant, the only way Tyler Medical Clinic could settle the 
case.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUPLE SUE L-TRYPTOPHAN MAKER FOR $30 
MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Burbank couple on Monday filed a $30-million lawsuit against a Japanese 
manufacturer of the dietary supplement L-tryptophan, alleging that impurities 
in the product severely disabled the woman. 
</P>
<P>
Mike and Cecile Gracy filed suit in Burbank Superior Court, claiming that Showa 
Denko of Tokyo produced impure batches of the supplement in late 1988 and early 
1989 that caused Cecile Gracy to develop eosinophilia-myaglia syndrome, a 
potentially fatal muscle and blood ailment. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Schwadron, a spokesman for Showa Denko in New York, declined to comment on 
the lawsuit. But he acknowledged that other suits had been filed against the 
company, the largest of six tryptophan suppliers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers last month presented the strongest evidence to date linking the 
company's batches of the amino acid supplement to a U.S. epidemic last fall of 
eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: YOUTH CHARGED IN MURDERS 'NOT HARDENED,' 
COURT TOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 16-year-old Long Beach youth was "an accident waiting to happen" from 
emotional problems caused by the murder of his sister, a psychiatrist testified 
Monday at a hearing to determine whether the teen-ager will be tried as a 
juvenile or as an adult for shooting two deaf brothers, one fatally. 
</P>
<P>
But Dr. William Vicary said that Joey Paul Bellinger is "not a hardened 
anti-social individual" and could be rehabilitated by the California Youth 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
Bellinger is charged with murdering Cesar Vieira, 30, and attempting to murder 
Edward Vieira, 25, with a .25-caliber pistol during a confrontation in Granada 
Hills after the Palmdale brothers traded insults with five teen-agers, 
including Bellinger. 
</P>
<P>
"This kid is falling apart," Vicary -- called by Bellinger's attorney -- 
testified in the fitness hearing in Pasadena Juvenile Court. "That is why you 
see him doing something so stupid -- something really out of character for 
him."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BOARD TO DISCUSS GOALS FOR STUDENT 
ACHIEVEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles school board will hold a special meeting at 2 p.m. next Monday 
to discuss setting specific goals to improve the academic achievement of 
students at all the district's 600 schools. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Britton has proposed that each school try each year to increase by 7% 
the number of students achieving above the 40th percentile on national 
standardized tests, until schools meet state targets and national norms for 
student achievement. 
</P>
<P>
His plan also calls for a 10% increase in the number of ninth-graders enrolled 
in algebra, and a 15% increase in the number who pass the course. At next 
Monday's meeting the board will discuss whether the goals are appropriate, how 
strategies for meeting them will be devised, what consequences will be attached 
to the plan and how to fund it.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PUBLIC'S HELP SOUGHT IN FINDING BOY, 8 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police turned to the public Monday for help in finding an 8-year-old Los 
Angeles boy missing since the weekend when his mother's boyfriend took the 
child on a purported errand to borrow money from his boss, authorities said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
When Manuel Morales, 25, failed to return with Carlos Pineda on Sunday, the 
boy's mother, Adela Pineda, 35, called police, Lt. Marlin (Doc) Warkentin said. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives located Morales around midnight Sunday in a trailer parked at the 
roofing company where he works, Warkentin said. After questioning, police 
arrested Morales for investigtion of child-stealing. Warkentin told reporters 
that Morales claimed three men had abducted the boy at Olympic Boulevard and 
Highland Avenue on Saturday after robbing him of $1,500 he had borrowed. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos has black hair and brown eyes, weighs about 60 pounds and is 3-feet, 
5-inches tall. Warkentin asked that anyone who may have seen the boy call 
police at 485-4062 or 485-2919.

SUSPECT IN DEATH OF BABY HAS BACKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA KLEIN LERNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Reseda mother and PTA president, charged with murdering an infant she cared 
for in her home and also under investigation in the death of another baby, was 
described Monday as a "caring and sweet" baby-sitter who is loved by children 
and still trusted by their parents. 
</P>
<P>
About two dozen parents, friends and relatives came to a bail review hearing to 
show support for Debra Suzanne Cummings, 32, who is charged with murdering 
Kevin Young, a 9-month-old whom Cummings had cared for almost daily for six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
He died on June 16 of skull fractures suffered in Cummings' home. 
</P>
<P>
Cummings told police the baby fell against a coffee table but a coroner's 
report said that the injuries "were inconsistent with" that explanation and 
that the baby appeared to have been hit with a hand or fist. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County coroner's office concluded that Kevin died of 
blunt-force trauma to the head, resulting in two fractures to the back of his 
skull. 
</P>
<P>
Cummings sat quietly with her hands folded as half a dozen parents testified 
that they would not hesitate to leave their children with Cummings despite the 
murder charge she faces. She began to cry quietly as friends and relatives 
stood to recite their names for the court record. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a child 3 years old who will not be left with anybody but Debbie," said 
Cathy Clebanoff, a mother of three. 
</P>
<P>
"My children request to be with her," said another parent, Monica Marcial, who 
said she has left her three children with Cummings on about 15 occasions. 
</P>
<P>
"She's very caring. Very caring and sweet," testified Doris Apperson, who said 
Cummings has been caring for her 5-year-old son, Jason, since he was 18 months 
old. "He never wanted to come home," Apperson said. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Municipal Judge Leslie Ann Dunn set Cummings' bail at $100,000 and 
scheduled a preliminary hearing for Aug. 8. Cummings had been held without bail 
since she turned herself in last Tuesday after learning that she faced a murder 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
Cummings' attorney, Joe Ingber, had asked that bail be set at "a reasonable 
amount" and denounced the charge as "a vendetta" by the Los Angeles police 
detective investigating the case. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Ann Korban scoffed at Ingber's accusation, countering, "It 
seems just a teeny bit coincidental that within three months, two little boys 
in this woman's care have died." Korban asked that Cummings remain in Sybil 
Brand Institute without bail. 
</P>
<P>
Cummings is also under investigation in connection with the March 15 death of a 
14-month-old baby in her charge. 
</P>
<P>
Matthew Cooley of Reseda lost consciousness while at a park with Cummings. The 
boy's doctor ruled the cause of death as a seizure resulting from an organic 
medical problem of undetermined origin. 
</P>
<P>
But Matthew's mother, Lynn Cooley, testified Monday as a prosecution witness 
that the baby had had seizures only in Cummings' presence. Cooley said that 
Cummings began caring for Matthew in June, 1989, and that she was called to 
hospital emergency rooms on Sept. 14 and Jan. 29 when her son suffered what 
Cummings described as seizures. 
</P>
<P>
In March, Cummings told paramedics that the boy "turned blue" while taking a 
nap in the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area after she took him there to play. He 
was rushed by ambulance to Valley Presbyterian Medical Center, where he was 
pronounced dead shortly after arriving. 
</P>
<P>
The coroner's office, which investigates all unnatural deaths in the county, 
did not perform an autopsy because the boy's doctor attributed the death to 
natural causes, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Cummings' husband, Michael, a truck driver, testified that because of the 
seizures, his wife asked Matthew Cooley's mother "not to bring him anymore and 
she had asked very desperately that we continue baby-sitting." Cummings said he 
then asked the boy's mother to write a letter stating "that should there be an 
injury, we would not be held liable for it." He presented the letter to the 
judge.

CRIES OF FOUL GREET PLAN FOR WILD TURKEY RELEASE; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: PLAN TO PUT BIRDS IN NATIONAL FOREST DRAWS FIRE FROM 
ENVIRONMENTALISTS. THEY SAY NATURAL BALANCE COULD BE UPSET.

<P>
A plan to release wild turkeys into the Los Padres National Forest in Ventura 
County has upset a flock of opponents from local environmental groups who say 
it could upset the ecological balance of the forest. 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Club and the Audubon Society object to plans by the state Department 
of Fish and Game and U.S. Forest Service to plant a species of the American 
wild turkey, called Merriams, in wilderness deep within the forest. 
</P>
<P>
"They could introduce zebras and giraffes, too, but I don't think wanting to 
make this outside area a zoo is a function of the Forest Service," said Sally 
Reid, wilderness chairwoman of the Southern California region of the Sierra 
Club. "Their business is to maintain the natural environment of the natural 
species." 
</P>
<P>
Reid said she is concerned that the introduction of turkeys would push other 
fowl out of existence, including the endangered California condor, because some 
hunters might mistake condors for turkeys. The turkeys could also become a 
feast for predators such as coyotes and mountain lions. 
</P>
<P>
State game officials, however, say the prolific wild turkeys do a good job of 
taking care of themselves in the wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
Wild turkeys already roam California's wilderness preserves, including parts of 
the nearly 2-million-acre Los Padres forest north of Ventura County, including 
Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo and Monterey counties. There are about 100,000 
wild turkeys in parks and national forests statewide, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are seeing those turkeys doing quite well, and we aren't seeing an impact 
on native species," said John Massie, an assistant game coordinator for the 
state Department of Fish and Game, the agency responsible for releasing turkeys 
into the wilderness. "We don't have any kind of an ongoing problem." 
</P>
<P>
Fish and game officials say efforts to relocate wild turkeys have increased the 
population of one of America's favorite game birds. 
</P>
<P>
"Turkeys have been expanding their range for the past 25 years," Massie said. 
"This is no Noah's Ark situation. There are turkeys in all but one state." 
</P>
<P>
If the turkeys do come to Ventura County, they would be brought next winter, 
after the hunting season ends, Massie said. 
</P>
<P>
State fish and game officials would be responsible for releasing the turkeys, 
but U.S. Forest Service rangers would maintain the natural resources, such as 
water, needed to keep them alive. 
</P>
<P>
Forest Service biologists in Ojai and in Frazier Park in Kern County are 
studying areas of the national forest where the wild turkey could survive. 
</P>
<P>
Nine new areas proposed for the release of the wild turkeys straddle the Kern 
and Ventura county lines. They include four Ventura County sites: Mt. Pinos, 
Frazier Mountain, Sawmill Mountain and Alamo Mountain. Another five areas in 
Kern County are slated for release of the turkeys. 
</P>
<P>
"We've identified a suitable habitat in our district," said George Garcia, a 
biologist in the Ojai district office of the Los Padres National Forest. 
"There's available food, there's water." 
</P>
<P>
Water might have to be provided in some areas of the forest to keep the wild 
turkeys alive, Garcia said, adding, "but we would have to do that anyway as a 
management measure."

In addition to an environmental impact report of the areas where turkeys may be 
released, biologists are studying the economic impact the birds will have as 
hunters and bird-watchers flock to the area. The report will be ready by 
mid-August for public comment, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Hunters and state fish and game officials said the turkeys are probably already 
in Ventura County. Last year about 60 turkeys were imported into the Tejon 
Ranch in Kern County, and many of them may have flown the coop to parts of the 
forest closer to Ventura County, Massie said. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the vast Los Padres National Forest lies in Ventura County, but 
it also stretches into Kern, Monterey, Santa Barbara, San Benito and San Luis 
Obispo counties. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, wild turkeys have had little effect on native species, according 
to U.S. Forest Service environmental reports prepared for previous releases of 
the wild turkeys into national forest preserves. 
</P>
<P>
But local environmental and anti-hunting groups disagree. About 40 have written 
letters urging Los Padres National Forest officials to quit the project cold 
turkey, said wildlife biologist Patty Bates. 
</P>
<P>
One representative of the Audubon Society said wild turkeys raise little 
interest among local bird-watchers. He said he fears that other birds would be 
killed by hunters stalking wild turkeys. 
</P>
<P>
"Our concern would be that other game would be taken by accident," said Art 
Marshall, president of the Ventura chapter of the Audubon Society. "Other birds 
that are not turkeys would be killed." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of hunting groups, including a member of a local quail club, 
said there is plenty of room in the forest for other birds. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think quail and turkey would compete. If biologists say there's enough 
food up there for quail and turkey, I feel I can fully accept that," said Bill 
Cullen, vice president of the Ventura group, Quail Unlimited. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the people who are getting excited about this don't realize it's been 
done several times in other places," Cullen said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the drought, some parts of the Los Padres National Forest have 
become hostile to wildlife, Cullen said. Quail Unlimited, a 50-member group 
that includes hunters and conservationists, provides food and water supplies to 
feed game animals during winter and summer. 
</P>
<P>
"Man has got to help them along because we've crowded out the most desirable 
habitat because we're living in it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other hunters said they are not likely to confuse turkeys with an endangered 
species, such as the condor. 
</P>
<P>
"It's totally false when they think there will be a case of mistaken identity 
between a condor and a turkey," said Will Whitaker, a hunter who sits on the 
Ventura County Fish and Game Commission, an advisory panel to the Ventura 
County Board of Supervisors.

GANG IS SUSPECTED OF FIRING ON OFFICERS; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: ONE IS INJURED AS BULLET RICOCHETS OFF HIS PATROL CAR. RETALIATION FOR 
THE DEATH OF A GANG MEMBER MAY BE THE MOTIVE.

A Los Angeles police officer was grazed by a gunshot outside a Wilmington 
housing project over the weekend in apparent retaliation for the death hours 
earlier of a gang member who was fleeing police, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor Division Officer Don Linfield was only bruised in the Sunday morning 
shooting, which is still under investigation. Police and community activists, 
meanwhile, sought Monday to prevent further violence that might stem from the 
death early Saturday of John Santos, 21, of Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
"Things could get out of hand if we don't do something quickly," said Dee 
Wiggington, president of Mothers Against Gangs, a Wilmington community group 
that planned an emergency meeting Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Linfield was wounded about 2 a.m. Sunday outside Dana Strand Village, a 
384-unit housing project that was the scene about 24 hours earlier of the 
incident that ended in Santos' death. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Santos was walking through the housing project about 3 a.m. 
Saturday when he saw officers on patrol and fled, apparently ingesting 
narcotics as he ran. After running a short distance, Santos collapsed and began 
choking, police said. The officers, who had chased him, used the Heimlich 
maneuver in a vain attempt to clear the man's windpipe, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A small group of bystanders demanded that officers use cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation to revive Santos, police said. But the officers and an ambulance 
attendant continued their efforts, insisting that it was useless to use CPR 
while Santos' windpipe was blocked. The young man was finally taken by 
ambulance to Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Harbor City, where he was pronounced 
dead at 4:05 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Monday it was unclear whether Santos died from choking or from 
ingesting narcotics, believed to be cocaine. A coroner's spokesman said the 
cause of death was tentatively listed as choking pending an autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
Hours after Santos' death, police said, fellow gang members held a wake, 
promised retaliation for his death and spray-painted death threats against 
police on the housing project's walls. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday morning, Linfield and his partner, Officer Pete Vasquez, were shot at as 
they patrolled Dana Strand in their police car. A bullet ricocheted off the car 
and struck Linfield, who was driving. A search failed to turn up the gunman, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
"Gang members always make threats after one of their own is killed. But for 
them to write on walls and then actually shoot at police is serious. They're 
not playing games," Wiggington said. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor Division Capt. Joe DeLadurantey said he hopes to meet today with Dana 
Strand residents to explain that his officers did all they could to save 
Santos. "We want to make sure that everyone understands the facts," he said.

ASSESSOR'S SHORTCOMINGS COST $11.5 MILLION A YEAR, AUDIT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARISSE JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Failure of the assessor's office to fully implement recommendations made two 
years ago could cost Los Angeles County more than $9 million annually in lost 
interest, according to an audit report issued Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Conducted by the public accounting firm of Ernst &amp; Young, the audit 
determined that the county could lose an estimated $9.1 million in annual net 
interest because of processing delays and problem billings, and an additional 
$2.4 million in uncollected tax revenue because of problem billings -- problems 
that were addressed in recommendations made by the county grand jury in fiscal 
1987-88. 
</P>
<P>
The review, completed in April at the request of the 1989-90 county grand jury, 
comes as Assessor John J. Lynch is facing a November runoff against Kenneth P. 
Hahn, a mid-level manager in the assessor's office, to head the department that 
determines tax bills for 2.2 million properties throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
Besides advising the assessor's office to begin or continue the implemention of 
seven recommendations by the grand jury, the report offered 11 new suggestions 
for improving the office's efficiency, including the development of procedures 
to better deal with the public's confusion over tax matters. 
</P>
<P>
Although Lynch has been criticized for not getting tax bills out on time and, 
therefore, costing the county revenue, the assessor said that many of the 
problems raised in the audit are being addressed and that the estimated losses 
are largely speculative. 
</P>
<P>
"The grand jury auditors can only do so much in a given time," Lynch said. 
"While they're doing their very audit, improvements are locking into place." 
</P>
<P>
Saying many problem bills have been reprocessed since the office review was 
completed in April, reducing interest losses, Assistant Assessor Roy Sharman 
said an Ernst &amp; Young auditor has already reduced the $9.1-million estimate 
of lost annual interest to $6.3 million, and cut the $2.4-million figure in 
half. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of this is supposition," said Sharman, referring to the report's 
estimates of lost revenue. "They're supposing this will happen and projecting 
years into the future." 
</P>
<P>
Ernst &amp; Young could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Assessor's spokesman Robert Knowles said a written response to the report will 
be issued through the county Board of Supervisors.

S&amp;L SALES SYSTEM RECORD-KEEPING LACKS SAFEGUARDS; 
</P>
<P>
BAILOUT: THRIFT REGULATORS MAY BE HANDICAPPED IN DETECTING POTENTIAL 
FAVORITISM, FRAUD OR IMPROPER PRICING.

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The federal agency responsible for selling billions of dollars in real estate 
from failed savings and loan associations lacks a central record-keeping system 
to keep track of the properties sold, the prices paid or the names of the 
buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Without such a system, the Washington headquarters of Resolution Trust Corp. 
may be handicapped in detecting potential favoritism, fraud or improper pricing 
in the sales of thousands of pieces of property. 
</P>
<P>
The agency's local offices are expected eventually to sell more than $100 
billion in real estate from failed thrift institutions, including single-family 
homes, condominiums, office buildings, shopping centers and land. The 
corporation's four regional offices are independent in deciding the types of 
records to keep on purchasers of real estate, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
RTC officials questioned the importance of a central mechanism to identify 
buyers but added that such a system eventually will be installed. 
</P>
<P>
The agency is not particularly interested in the identity of buyers, said Kevin 
Shields, spokesman for the Denver regional office, which includes California. 
"If they have the money and paid in cash, it doesn't matter," he said. "What's 
the difference to the taxpayer; who cares who buys it?" 
</P>
<P>
He said that agency procedures will prevent fraud and protect taxpayers. "We 
have policies and guidelines that do not allow us to sell below market value." 
</P>
<P>
However, local RTC officials have considerable autonomy, with the authority to 
cut the price of a property 20% if it hasn't sold in six months. 
</P>
<P>
The agency has 35,000 properties for sale. Buyers can be identified only if the 
specific address of the property is known. Even then, on sales of specific 
pieces of property by the 247 thrifts currently operating under Resolution 
Trust conservatorship, it is usually necessary to go to the S&amp;L involved to 
search for information. 
</P>
<P>
The agency's 14 local offices should have files on the sales of properties held 
by S&amp;Ls that have been shut down. However, on a regional level, the 
compilation of local figures varies. 
</P>
<P>
The Western region in Denver, for example, has no central listing of buyers of 
real estate assets throughout California, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, Alaska 
and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
In the Dallas region, officials began a complete computer record system in 
June, insisting that they be notified of the identification of buyers on a 
routine basis. 
</P>
<P>
Previously in Dallas, RTC regional reports identified buyers only a third of 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
"The system was spotty at best in tracking buyers," said Teresa McUsic, public 
affairs officer for the region, which includes Texas and Oklahoma. "The focus 
at first was on the number of assets and the dollar amount sold," she added. 
"The focus was not on tracking the buyers." 
</P>
<P>
There is an elaborate set of RTC rules, forbidding officials involved in the 
cleanup of hundreds of S&amp;Ls to do business with persons who have caused a 
loss to a thrift institution. The government does not want people who might 
have contributed to the collapse of an S&amp;L to be able to buy foreclosed 
properties at bargain prices. 
</P>
<P>
But the lack of a central system makes it difficult for officials in Washington 
to know precisely who is buying government-owned real estate. 
</P>
<P>
"Washington has decentralized," said Thomas Hamberger, special assistant to 
Lamar Kelly, director of asset and real estate management. "We in Washington do 
not keep files on the specific properties." 
</P>
<P>
"The regional directors are in charge of their property, having their people 
dealing with the purchasers, doing appraisals and selling property," he said. 
He argued that, because sales take place at a local level, it is unnecessary to 
have sales records at Washington headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult for us in Washington to travel to Los Angeles and show a 
property," Hamberger noted. "We don't have a specific computer base at this 
time to have the capacity, for example, to keep track of single-family home 
sales in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
The RTC makes available a list of properties for sale through both printed 
volumes and computer discs. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is no accompanying list of the properties that have already sold 
by the agency, which has been in existence since last August. 
</P>
<P>
"They know at the local level who they are selling property to," said Stephen 
Katsanos, the agency's director of communications. "As far as us in Washington 
needing to have a five-foot stack of paper listing everyone who bought 
property, I am not sure how useful that would be." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "If I wanted to go to an S&amp;L and find out everything that S&amp;L 
has sold, they have the records at the S&amp;L, so I can look at each 
transaction." And, he said, at local offices of the agency "I can look at what 
has been sold" from defunct S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
Katsanos said that his agency eventually will have a central system for 
identifying asset sales and buyers. "I can't tell you (when) at this time," he 
said.

BLAZE THREATENS THE AVAILABILITY OF SOME KINDS OF GAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fire and explosion at the Arco Chemical Co. plant in Channelview, Tex., 
last week is threatening to reduce the availability of some types of gasoline, 
industry officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion that killed 17 workers Thursday forced Arco to cease production 
there of methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE, a component used to make 
lower-emissions and premium gasolines. Arco Chemical is 83% owned by Los 
Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield Co. 
</P>
<P>
Industry sources said Arco Chemical, the nation's largest maker of MTBE, will 
be able to supply oil-company customers with only 70% of its contractual MTBE 
commitments. 
</P>
<P>
Because there are few alternatives to the Channelview plant's MTBE production, 
industry officials fear shortages of certain gasolines. 
</P>
<P>
"(MTBE) was tight before the accident happened, and it's not readily available" 
elsewhere, said E. J. (Gene) Bohny, vice president of Texas Petrochemicals 
Corp., the second-largest maker of MTBE. "It will be short now." 
</P>
<P>
The fuels most likely to be affected: 
</P>
<P>
* Premium unleaded gasolines that use MTBE to boost octane. Refiners could use 
other additives as a substitute, but that could affect costs. 
</P>
<P>
* Gasolines delivered to cities such as Denver and Phoenix that require oxygen 
additives such as MTBE in the winter to reduce hydrocarbon air pollutants. 
Unocal Corp., which buys MTBE from Arco Chemical to put in gasoline it sells in 
Nevada and Arizona, said it will have to reduce the amount of oxygenate in 
fuels it delivers to those states. 
</P>
<P>
* Gasolines -- slated for introduction in the next few months -- that use MTBE 
to reduce hydrocarbon emissions. Such introductions could be delayed, depending 
on the length of the Arco Chemical plant's shutdown. 
</P>
<P>
It is too soon to say how drastic the effects will be. But one thing is 
certain: Prices for MTBE, now about $1.10 a gallon, will go up sharply. And 
that could affect the wholesale price of products made with it.

OFFICIALS INVOLVED IN S&amp;L DEAL SNUB PANEL; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: M. DANNY WALL AND OTHERS FAIL TO APPEAR AT A SENATE PROBE OF WHETHER 
FAVORITISM WAS INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF 15 TEXAS S&amp;LS.

<P>
Government officials involved in selling a group of failed Texas thrifts to an 
Arizona insurance executive failed to appear Monday before a Senate panel 
investigating the controversial transaction. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Judiciary antitrust, monopolies and business rights subcommittee is 
investigating whether favoritism was involved in a deal in which James M. Fail 
was permitted to buy 15 savings and loans with $70 million in borrowed funds 
and a personal payment of only $1,000 -- a deal in which $1.8 billion in 
federal subsidies was promised. Those thrifts have since been consolidated into 
one S&amp;L that last year was among the most profitable in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the most abominable deal that I've ever come across in all of my public 
or private life," said subcommittee Chairman Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) in a 
television interview Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The government officials who ignored the subcommittee's invitation -- including 
M. Danny Wall, former chairman of the now-defunct Federal Home Loan Bank Board 
-- deny wrongdoing but have declined to discuss the case in public. Others who 
spurned the subcommittee's request were Stuart Root, former executive director 
of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., and Thomas Lykos, a former 
FSLIC official with jurisdiction over the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Metzenbaum said the panel may use its subpoena power to compel testimony from 
Wall and the others at subsequent hearings. "We have an obligation to determine 
whether this massive infusion of funds into the savings and loan industry will 
enhance our nation's economy or simply add to the crushing burden of our 
government's deficit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Businessmen involved in the deal, including Fail, also declined to appear 
before the subcommittee. But in a statement submitted to the panel, Fail said 
his ability to handle difficult business problems "has benefited the public, 
the policyholders and the employees of my companies." 
</P>
<P>
The other businessmen asked to appear were Robert T. Shaw, chairman of Garden 
City, N.Y.-based Bankers Life &amp; Casualty, who loaned money to Fail, and 
Fail's lobbyist, Robert Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1988, Fail acquired the 15 Texas thrifts and then used the assets 
to form his Dallas-based Bluebonnet Savings Bank, an institution that last year 
enjoyed a 62% return on investments -- the highest in the industry. Solvent 
S&amp;Ls generally have a rate of return of about 7%. 
</P>
<P>
The Bluebonnet deal went through despite a warning from the New York branch of 
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board that Fail's proposed capital investment -- 
including borrowed funds -- "exceeds Mr. Fail's net worth." 
</P>
<P>
In a series of pointed questions, Metzenbaum charged that Fail received special 
consideration from federal regulators after Thompson interceded on his behalf 
with the bank board chairman. Thompson was an executive assistant to then-Vice 
President George Bush and a former special assistant to former President Ronald 
Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Metzenbaum charged, federal officials overlooked evidence that 
Fail lacked the $70 million he claimed he had available for the deal. 
</P>
<P>
The regulators also ignored the fact that Fail's insurance companies in Arizona 
pleaded guilty to securities fraud charges in 1976. And, the senator said, 
other bidders for the group of thrifts were inexplicably excluded from 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
"Why was Mr. Fail . . . chosen by FSLIC to acquire Bluebonnet when his offer 
was $97 million more costly to the federal government than a competing bidder?" 
Metzenbaum asked. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its profits, Bluebonnet still receives millions of dollars in federal 
subsidies, Metzenbaum charged. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. taxpayer, compliments of the deal makers at FSLIC, send Mr. Fail a 
check for what amounts to an average $23 million every month," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, federal regulators were eager to sell insolvent institutions to buyers 
willing to inject their own funds into the thrifts. As the year drew to a 
close, many purchasers hurried to take advantage of a tax break that was 
sharply curtailed on Dec. 31, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Critics charge that in the rush, the government sold the thrifts for less than 
they were worth. Some of them, like Bluebonnet, have since become quite 
profitable. 
</P>
<P>
But although he gained favorable terms from federal regulators, Fail did not 
live up to his obligations, Metzenbaum said, and engaged in questionable 
business practices. 
</P>
<P>
To pay the $70 million he pledged the government, Fail borrowed funds from his 
insurance companies, a transaction that may have put his policyholders at risk, 
Metzenbaum said.

NORTHROP WILL LAY OFF 1,400 AT B-2 FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Northrop will lay off about 1,400 workers at its B-2 bomber plant in Pico 
Rivera, starting this month and continuing through September, the Los Angeles 
aerospace firm said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop also said it will transfer production of the center fuselage section 
of the B-2 bomber from Pico Rivera to its facility in Palmdale to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop is preparing a consolidation plan, in which it may close some 
facilities in Hawthorne, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
The layoffs are part of a 3,000-worker cutback this year that was announced in 
May, Northrop spokesman Tony Cantafio said. Last month, Northrop notified 
workers at its aircraft division in Hawthorne that 1,350 jobs would be cut this 
year through retirements, voluntary leaves, contract labor terminations and 
layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
When Northrop announced its plan to cut 3,000 jobs this year, it had 41,000 
workers, about 75% of whom were in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually every major defense contractor in Southern California is trimming its 
work force, making for one of the most bleak industry outlooks since the early 
1970s. McDonnell Douglas is cutting nearly 10,000 workers this year, and 
Lockheed may eliminate as many as 7,000. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop's layoffs are being driven by a Pentagon decision to trim B-2 orders, 
by an internal effort to cut costs and by a change in the skills needed for B-2 
production as the program matures. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,400 jobs to be eliminated at Pico Rivera plant will be partly offset by 
hiring of hourly production workers in Palmdale, Cantafio said. The Palmdale 
plant employs 2,200 and will grow to 3,000 by year-end.

NEIL BUSH DEFENDS ACTIONS AT S&amp;L

An angry, embattled Neil Bush on Monday defended his conduct as a director of a 
failed Denver savings and loan as well as his acceptance of what he conceded 
was "an incredibly sweet deal" in the form of a $100,000 loan from a Denver 
investor that he did not have to repay. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush's 35-year-old son, who faces a disciplinary hearing this fall 
before federal thrift regulators, decided this weekend to launch a one-man 
public relations campaign in connection with his role as a director of the 
defunct Silverado Savings &amp; Loan, whose collapse is expected to cost 
taxpayers about $1 billion. He issued a combative eight-page response to the 
charges against him and began inviting reporters to his spartan office here to 
hear his version of the events that have made him a figure in the largest 
financial scandal in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
Chewing gum and digging through stacks of papers on the office floor, Bush 
acknowledged in an interview Monday that he got "an incredibly sweet deal" in 
1984 when Denver investor Kenneth Good lent him $100,000 and then forgave the 
debt. Bush also revealed that he has decided to report that 6-year-old payment 
as income on his 1990 tax return. 
</P>
<P>
But that loan, Bush insisted, was "totally unrelated" to his work as a director 
of Silverado. 
</P>
<P>
Other charges against him, Bush complained, stem from political "opportunism" 
and "press sensationalism." 
</P>
<P>
In January, the federal Office of Thrift Supervision proposed a decree banning 
Neil Bush from the banking business because of his actions as a director of the 
bankrupt thrift. He refused to accede, despite pressure from White House aides 
urging him to put a quick end to the embarrassing case. He is now battling a 
reduced charge brought by the same agency. 
</P>
<P>
Describing himself as "stubborn," Bush said Monday that "it would have been 
much easier to sign it (the decree), move on in terms of just the quality of my 
life." Since then, he said, "This negative publicity has just, you know, taken 
over, dominated my life for six months." In addition, Bush noted, his position 
in the S&amp;L investigation may help Democrats turn the scandal to their 
political advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Bush said he decided to fight "because I know I haven't done anything 
wrong." The regulators have scheduled a public hearing for September, alleging 
that Bush violated conflict-of-interest rules by voting to approve Silverado 
loans to individuals with whom he had a business relationship. 
</P>
<P>
After keeping his own counsel for months, he has now decided to take his case 
to the public. "I've been kind of like a little caged-in animal in an 
unsanitary zoo," the President's son said. "Now my cage is open and I'm telling 
people . . . what my side of the story is. And I feel good about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm a better person for it," the slender, sandy-haired Bush went on. "I 
am stronger. . . . I'm eating better, drinking fruit juice. I feel like I'm 
warming for a fight." 
</P>
<P>
The eight-page document that Bush issued argues that the current disciplinary 
proceeding against him "is unprecedented." In the document, he noted that 
thrift regulators have not previously pursued such charges against a person who 
is no longer involved in banking. Bush quit the Silverado board in the summer 
of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's response also challenges the regulators' contention that he violated 
regulations by voting to approve Silverado loans to Bill Walters, a Denver 
developer who had invested in Bush's oil company. Bush said there was no 
conflict of interest in his votes because other bank officials knew of his ties 
to Walters. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure there was a disclosure made . . . that was looked at by legal 
counsel," Bush said. However, he did not mention his business connection with 
Walters on required conflict-of-interest forms, records show. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's long response also discusses dealings between Silverado and Good, the 
investor who had forgiven a $100,000 loan to Bush a year before he joined the 
bank board. "Bush abstained from voting on this matter and all transactions 
relating to Ken Good," according to the written response. 
</P>
<P>
Bank records show that Bush did not vote when Silverado's board approved loans 
to Good. But thrift regulators charge that Bush personally proposed to his 
fellow board members that they grant Good a $900,000 line of credit, which they 
did. 
</P>
<P>
In another instance, regulators charge, Bush failed to tell the other directors 
that Good agreed to invest up to $3 million in Bush's oil company -- even while 
Good told Silverado that he lacked the money to pay back his loans from the 
thrift. 
</P>
<P>
Bush on Monday offered further explanation of the $100,000 payment he received 
from Good in 1984. Under the arrangement, Bush was not expected to repay the 
loan unless the invested money returned a profit. Bush said that Good offered 
such loans to several Denver business people to pay for commodity speculation. 
The investment "went bad," Bush said, so Good forgave the loans to all 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
Another local businessman received a $350,000 payment from Good under the same 
circumstances, Bush noted. "But, of course, that won't be of any kind of 
interest," he added caustically, "because his name doesn't relate to somebody 
famous."

Saudi Arabia Signs Tank Deal: Saudi Arabia has signed a $3.1-billion deal to 
buy 315 M-1A2 tanks and support equipment from General Dynamics Corp. The 
Pentagon said the deal, which was approved by Congress last year but has been 
awaiting a final Saudi go-ahead, was signed Sunday. It will provide a major 
financial boost for the big U.S. defense firm. The U.S. Army decided last year 
not to buy any more M-1 tanks, and officials at General Dynamics said the Saudi 
deal would allow the firm to keep open at least one of its two plants -- the 
one at Lima, Ohio -- and perhaps its second plant at Warren, Mich.

Girard Seeks Financing for Pic 'N' Save Bid: Girard Partners said it still is 
seeking financing to make a bid for the Pic 'N' Save retail chain. Girard, led 
by La Jolla financier David H. Batchelder, also reaffirmed that it expects to 
resume its proxy fight for control of Pic 'N' Save if the Dominguez-based 
company fails to arrange a buyout with it or another bidder by a Sunday 
deadline. Shares of Pic 'N' Save , which specializes in close-out and other 
discount merchandise, fell 25 cents Monday to close at $11.75.

Post Office to Contract Out Work: The Postal Service said it plans to contract 
out some automated letter sorting, a plan that could result in as many as 
12,000 jobs moving from the post office to private companies by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Hiring private companies to do letter sorting could save $10 to $12 per work 
hour, compared to the costs of postal employees, the Postal Service said. The 
change could save as much as $4.3 billion over 10 years. Moe Biller, president 
of the American Postal Workers Union, quickly denounced the announcement as a 
"disgrace."

Wall Street, the underdog in a turf battle with the futures industry over 
control of a new type of financial product, hopes hearings this week persuade 
enough senators to support its position. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady will testify Thursday before the Senate 
Banking Committee on the Bush Administration's proposal to transfer the 
stock-index contracts to the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"If we get a strong measure of support out of Senate Banking, we could move for 
a vote in 10 days," said Joseph Hardiman, president of the National Assn. of 
Securities Dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Brady will become the highest-ranking member of the Administration to go on 
record as pressing for passage of legislation to strip stock-index futures from 
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Stock-index futures, contracts based 
on baskets of stocks, are popular in program trading strategies. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying a day ahead of Brady in support of the proposal will be American 
Stock Exchange Chairman Jim Jones and Options Clearing Corp. Chairman Wayne 
Luthringshausen. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the measure need the boost. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a very big lead to overcome," said SEC Commissioner Mary Schapiro. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities groups have lobbied for four months against any move that would 
diminish CFTC powers to regulate the futures markets -- and with success. 
</P>
<P>
"If it came to a vote today, I think it would be defeated," Bill Seale, 
president of the National Assn. of Futures Traders, said of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
The commodities industry has been chafing for a Senate vote since introduction 
of the legislation in early June. Efforts so far have been blocked. And the 
commodities industry is blaming the Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"Brady is stalling for time. He doesn't have the votes yet," said Alan Sobba of 
the National Cattlemen's Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Hardiman conceded that the securities industry needs more time to educate 
senators on the arcane issue of stock-index futures. Work in the House has not 
even begun. 
</P>
<P>
The securities industry argues that all equity products form one economic 
market. Thus, it contends, there should be one regulatory agency that can 
harmonize the interaction of futures and cash markets. 
</P>
<P>
The industry says split jurisdiction can lead to dangerous market volatility, 
such as occurred in the plunges of October, 1987, and October, 1989. The 
plunges scare away the average investor, it maintains. 
</P>
<P>
CFTC supporters respond that a change in the regulatory structure could stifle 
innovation. It adds that the CFTC is best-qualified to regulate all types of 
futures products because it understands their unique workings.

The dollar finished mixed in light domestic trading as currency traders kept a 
close watch on the economic summit in Houston but had little news to act upon. 
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said trading in the British pound was the most active feature 
of the foreign exchange markets Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling was boosted by continued expectation that Great Britain soon will join 
Europe's exchange rate mechanism. The mechanism limits exchange rate movements, 
and the markets expect it would strengthen the currency. 
</P>
<P>
The pound also was supported by comments from British Chancellor of the 
Exchequer John Major that the recent strength of the pound was no fluke but 
reflected the currency's true value. Major spoke at the Houston meeting of 
finance ministers from the seven leading industrial nations. 
</P>
<P>
"Sterling remains extremely strong across the board," said Robert Hatcher, a 
corporate currency dealer for Barclays Bank PLC in New York. 
</P>
<P>
In London, a pound was quoted at $1.8055, up strongly from late Friday's 
$1.7865. The pound had not been above $1.8000 in London since Jan. 4, 1989. 
Later, in New York trading, a pound cost $1.8080, more expensive than $1.7865 
late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese yen was boosted in domestic trading by comments from a U.S. 
Treasury official that the currency was considered low in value compared with 
other currencies, said Lorenzo Troni, vice president of foreign exchange at 
Paine Webber International Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 150.70 yen, down 0.25 yen from Friday's close. 
Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 151.10 yen. In New York, a dollar 
bought 151.15 yen, down from 151.70 yen late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices fell. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current 
delivery slipped $2.90 from late Friday to settle at $358.20 an ounce. Republic 
National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $357.40, off $2.80.

OPEC MOVES CLOSER TO PLAN TO END GLUT;

ENERGY: KEY MEMBERS OF THE OIL CARTEL REPORT PROGRESS IN STRATEGY TALKS AIMED 
AT CURBING PRODUCTION TO BOOST PRICES.

<P>
OPEC appears to be edging toward a price and production accord that may begin 
to erase a glut that has slashed world oil prices by a third this year. 
</P>
<P>
Key ministers report progress in strategy sessions ahead of a conference of the 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Geneva on July 25. 
</P>
<P>
They say the goal is a pact to restore average spot prices to OPEC's declared 
target of $18 per barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Benchmark prices in Europe are around $14, down from $21 at the start of the 
year. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, which normally sells at a 
premium, is trading at $16 a barrel, down from around $22 at the beginning of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a better chance now," Indonesian minister Ginandjar 
Kartasasmita said after talks in Algiers last week with OPEC President Sadek 
Boussena of Algeria and Kuwait's Rasheed Salem al Ameeri. 
</P>
<P>
More preparatory talks, this time among Persian Gulf producers, are scheduled 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
The 13-nation cartel's internal crisis arises from the ambitions of three big 
gulf producers -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates -- to sell 
more of their oil. Their demands for bigger production quotas have stymied 
several recent OPEC conferences. 
</P>
<P>
The gulf trio's quota-busting earlier this year was the chief cause of the glut 
in the market. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Saudis, the biggest exporters, cut their excess production under a 
stopgap agreement negotiated May 3, Kuwait and the UAE were slow to follow 
suit, and prices have stayed weak. 
</P>
<P>
OPEC sources say a compromise that ministers are examining would extend the 
stopgap accord to the end of September. After that, the gulf states would get 
new, bigger quotas -- provided that in the interim they curb excess output and 
prices climb back to $18 per barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Demand usually picks up in the winter, so, in theory, it would be possible to 
set a higher ceiling on total OPEC volume and raise individual quotas from 
October onward.

PHILIP MORRIS ADS TO WARN OFF TRADEMARK VIOLATORS

Marlboro Country is off limits to the makers of children's products. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Morris U.S.A. said Monday that it would spend $500,000 for an 
advertising campaign warning manufacturers that they will face "legal action" 
if they use any of the cigarette company's trademarks on children's products 
ranging from candy cigarettes to toy water pistols. 
</P>
<P>
"We have nothing to do with these products," said John R. Nelson, vice 
president of corporate affairs. "But we are continually being criticized for 
them. We don't want kids to smoke, and we don't want our logos on kids' 
products." 
</P>

One of the upcoming ads shows the familiar Marlboro and Virginia Slims 
trademarks and warns, "If you use these trademarks, we'll see you in court." 
</P>
<P>
The cigarette giant said it has been reluctant to sue the companies that have 
misused its trademarks -- on about 1,100 products -- over the past 10 years. 
"We're mostly dealing with small manufacturers here," said Nelson. "If we tried 
to drive them out of business by suing, it would look pretty bad for us." 
</P>
<P>
But one tobacco industry critic says the timing of the announcement is hardly 
coincidental. Congress continues to study the issue of proposed restrictions on 
cigarette advertising. "Philip Morris is just trying to counter all the bad 
publicity they're getting from that," said Phil Wilbur, a spokesman for 
Advocacy Group, a Washington-based anti-smoking organization. "This gives them 
the ability to claim that they're on the good side of this issue all of a 
sudden. It is a very good PR tactic."

END TO 'LIFO' IN ACCOUNTING URGED; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCE: MANY U.S. FIRMS PREFER THE 'LAST IN, FIRST OUT' METHOD OF VALUING 
INVENTORY. BUT AN INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE CALLS IT MISLEADING.

<TEXT>
<P>
The road to a global economy can be rocky even in the best of times. But as far 
as the U.S. accounting profession is concerned, a little-known international 
committee just rolled a boulder into the middle of a crucial turn. 
</P>
<P>
The London-based International Accounting Standard Committee, a group formed by 
13 industrialized countries in 1975 to formulate accounting principles that 
could be used worldwide, voted recently to recommend that LIFO -- short for 
"last in, first out" -- be eliminated as a method for valuing inventory. 
</P>
<P>
The idea makes sense outside of the United States. Many countries consider LIFO 
a bad accounting practice because it inflates the value of inventory on a 
company's balance sheet. 
</P>
<P>
But Americans bridle at the recommendation. Many U.S. companies prefer LIFO 
over its counterpart, FIFO, or "first in, first out," because it results in a 
lower tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
Also, federal tax laws require U.S. companies to use LIFO in certain 
circumstances. The laws have been on the Internal Revenue Service books since 
1937, and eliminating LIFO in the United States would take an act of Congress, 
said Arthur Wyatt, a senior partner with the Chicago accounting firm of Arthur 
Andersen &amp; Co. and one of two U.S. delegates to the IASC. Congress "might 
be persuaded to do it if it seemed to be in the national interest, but that 
would be a battle to be fought in Washington and nowhere else," he said. 
</P>
<P>
LIFO and FIFO are among the more arcane categories in accounting terminology, 
but the methods they describe are relatively simple. 
</P>
<P>
In order to compute its earnings for the year, a company must put a value on 
the goods that remain in its inventory at year's end. With LIFO, all goods 
remaining in inventory are valued at the price last paid for them. With FIFO, 
the goods are valued at the price originally paid for them. 
</P>
<P>
The difference in the methods is most apparent in an inflationary economy. 
</P>
<P>
Under LIFO, the value of the inventory, and thus the amount of earnings, is 
lower. With FIFO the two figures are higher. The higher its earnings, the more 
taxes a company has to pay -- and vice versa. If a company uses LIFO in 
computing its taxes, the Internal Revenue Service requires it to use LIFO in 
financial statements it prepares for investors, auditors and such federal 
agencies as the Securities and Exchange Commission. A company that uses FIFO 
for taxes can use either method for financial statements. 
</P>
<P>
Many U.S. companies routinely elect LIFO over FIFO. Of 600 companies surveyed 
by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the leading trade 
association for the accounting profession in the United States, more than 400 
use LIFO for both tax and financial reporting. Ninety percent of U.S. petroleum 
companies value their inventory with LIFO, as do 93% of the U.S. chemical 
companies, the survey reported. 
</P>
<P>
Also, as the U.S. economy has become increasingly inflationary, LIFO has become 
the method of choice. 
</P>
<P>
FIFO, its counterpart, "gives you the most profit in the good times and the 
most loss in the bad times," said Edward P. Brunner, vice president and chief 
financial officer of Baltimore Life Insurance Co. 
</P>
<P>
In the past 20 years, the United States has "had several dips in the economy, 
and people who used FIFO got whipsawed. Companies changed to LIFO because they 
didn't want to get hit again," said Brunner.

OFFICIALS SOLD PLAYERS STOCK BEFORE QUICK DOWNTURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Several officials of Players International in Agoura Hills sold about $2.5 
million worth of stock in the company almost two weeks before the stock took a 
sudden drop in over-the-counter trading, according to filings with the federal 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Edward Fishman, Vice Chairman David Fishman, President Stanley 
Harfenist, Vice President John Quiroga and Director Stanley Fishman together 
sold 405,300 shares of Players stock on May 31 and June 31 for between $6.10 
and $6.125 per share. 
</P>
<P>
Harfenist sold another 10,000 shares that he holds for his son on June 6, for 
$6.125 per share. 
</P>
<P>
The stock rose to a 52-week high of $8.50 on June 4. Investors were apparently 
intrigued by Players' announcement that it would soon test-market a telephone 
call-in version of the popular television game show "Jeopardy!" by using a 
900-number service. 
</P>
<P>
After the New York Daily News reported on June 13 that a Tennessee congressman 
had asked the U.S. attorney general in May to investigate a different 
900-number game, Players' stock fell 31% in two days to close at $5.25 on June 
14. 
</P>
<P>
Players' stock closed Monday at $4.75 per share, down 37.5 cents. 
</P>
<P>
David Fishman denied that the officials' stock sales were related to the 
congressman's announcement, which he said the company only learned about 
through the June 13 Daily News article. The reasons for the sales were 
"personal," David Fishman said. "I don't want to get into their personal 
reasons or mine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to a separate filing with the SEC, the company officials planned to 
sell another 1 million shares. But David Fishman said that filing was made by 
mistake by the officials' brokers. The officials don't plan to sell more stock, 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Bart Gordon, D-Tenn., claimed that the other 900-number contest, which is 
called "The Game," constitutes a form of gambling. But David Fishman said 
Players' "Jeopardy!" game isn't gambling. 
</P>
<P>
Players operates a club that offers discounts to "middle-roller" gamblers at 
casino resorts in places such as Las Vegas and Atlantic City.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: SOFTWARE TOOLWORKS SCALES DOWN FISCAL 1990 RESULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Software Toolworks revised its fiscal 1990 financial results slightly lower 
after adopting an accounting change on certain accounts receivable, which is 
money owed the Chatsworth company by its customers. 
</P>
<P>
Software Toolworks, which makes software for the Nintendo home video system and 
personal computers, said the change lowered its revenue for the year that ended 
March 31 by $624,000 and shaved its net income by $221,000. Restated, Software 
Toolworks earned $2.37 million in fiscal 1990 on revenue of $68.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Les Crane, the company's chairman, said the change "has no material effect on 
our historical results, and we expect no material effect upon anticipated 
results."

JACK SMITH: THOMAS JEFFERSON DECLARED UNDER THE INFLUENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have received a complimentary copy of a magazine called Heads Up, a 
publication of the Beer Drinkers of America. 
</P>
<P>
If all the beer drinkers in America are members of that organization, it must 
be very large indeed, and very powerful politically. It is more likely, I 
suspect, that its members are in the brewing industry. 
</P>
<P>
I do not qualify, by habit, for membership (I generally drink wine), but I am 
amused by the industry's pretensions to patriotism. The cover shows three men 
in Colonial costume examining a document written on parchment. They are in a 
tavern before a great fireplace. Their table holds two full beer mugs and one 
lighted candle. In the table of contents it is noted that this scene was 
"re-created" in Gulliver's restaurant in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
I am always glad to learn some previously unknown tidbit of American history, 
so I was surprised but not displeased to learn in an article called "Ye Old 
Public Taverns Were a Source of Inspiration, Warmth . . . and American Liberty" 
that Thomas Jefferson actually wrote one of his drafts of the Declaration of 
Independence in a tavern. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was he in a tavern, he was drinking ale. I quote: 
</P>
<P>
"Thomas Jefferson sat at the Indian Queen Tavern in Philadelphia facing a blank 
sheet of parchment. Taking a long drink of his freshly poured ale, he touched 
his pen to paper and scratched, 'When in the course of human events . . . . ' " 
</P>
<P>
It is fascinating to think that Jefferson may have been a little tipsy when he 
wrote that most cherished of American documents. Perhaps the ale accounts for 
his misspelling of "inalienable" as "unalienable," an error that has been 
perpetuated in copies of the declaration to the present day. It is said that 
Jefferson in his other writings spelled the word "inalienable." 
</P>
<P>
We may also wonder whether it was the ale, and the tavern setting, that caused 
Jefferson to omit women from his phrase, "We hold these truths to be 
self-evident; that all men are created equal. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
In his biography, "Jefferson the Virginian," Dumas Malone notes that in his 
original draft Jefferson had written "We hold these truths to be sacred and 
undeniable," but this rhetorical flare-up was toned down later, either by 
Jefferson himself or by Benjamin Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, though Jefferson may have been under the influence of ale when he 
composed it, his declaration has stood the test of time. As Malone says, "No 
other American document has been read so often or listened to by so many weary 
and perspiring audiences. Yet, despite interminable repetition, those well-worn 
phrases have never lost their potency and charm." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly a close second to the declaration would be Lincoln's "Gettysburg 
Address," which he wrote on one sheet of paper before leaving the White House 
for the cemetery. He made some revisions the night before the talk. Oddly, the 
phrase "under God," in "this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of 
freedom," did not appear in his original copies. He ad libbed them. But they 
appear in all subsequent copies. One thing I doubt seriously, is that Lincoln 
had drunk any beer or spiritous liquor while he was composing it. 
</P>
<P>
Heads Up also notes that the flag that inspired Francis Scott Key to write "The 
Star-Spangled Banner" in 1814 was sewn by Mary Young Pickersgill on the floor 
of a Baltimore brewery. 
</P>
<P>
In an article on "America's No. 1 Song" (Atlantic, July, 1986) Daniel Mark 
Epstein explains that Mary's sewing room was too small for the flag, which was 
30 feet high and 42 feet wide, so she and her little daughter worked on their 
hands and knees on the malt-house floor of Claggett's Brewery. They finished 
just as the British fleet was approaching Baltimore Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Key was a prisoner of the British during that night of rockets red glare and 
bombs bursting in air, and at dawn, when he saw the flag still flying, he wrote 
his poem on an envelope. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was the flag sewn on a brewery floor, but the poem was set to the tune 
of an English drinking song, "To Anacreon in Heaven," a hymn to the ancient 
Greek poet Anacreon, who loved wine and lovemaking above all else. London 
gentlemen spent nights of alcoholic singing and revelry in his memory. 
</P>
<P>
According to Heads Up, Key's words were published on a handbill the next day 
and were soon "being sung in Baltimore taverns." 
</P>
<P>
So "The Star-Spangled Banner" is a dubious national anthem, not only because of 
its libertine origin, but also because of its notoriously out-of-reach high 
notes and low notes, on which the best voices -- pop, operatic and rock -- 
routinely founder; also, it can not be marched to. 
</P>
<P>
I don't drink beer when I write. If I did, I'd probably write phrases like "We 
hold these truths to be sacred and undeniable."

Old Story: The Library of Congress will display personal mail between members 
of Congress and their wives over the last 200 years, some of which suggests 
Washington sex scandals are not new. Rep. Job Pierson of New York wrote to his 
wife, Clarissa, on Dec. 17, 1834, that her brother, a U.S. senator, seduced a 
maid the first week of her employment and "cohabitated with her during the 
whole session . . . . The other boarders were angry at this monopoly," he 
wrote. "They enticed some four or five girls from a house of ill-fame . . . who 
came there every night."

Space Rights: A physicist urged a UFO symposium to accept a bill of rights to

future global authorities and prohibits alien bases on other planets' 
satellites. Brandenburg ended his talk with the monologue from the "Star Trek"

There are tides in the affairs of science that reflect and at times even 
predict the greater tides in society at large. Optimism about our biological 
and psychological potential for salvation may be the theme of the 1990s. 
Experienced science writers Morton Hunt and Alfie Kohn have produced, 
independently, popular books about the human capacity for empathy, altruism, 
and what they define as "pro-social" behavior. In other words, we have two 
volumes demonstrating that people can be good, and with some encouragement, can 
be even better. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt's "The Compassionate Beast" and Kohn's "The Brighter Side of Human Nature" 
refer, on the whole, to the same cluster of psychological and sociological 
studies that affirm the existence of altruism as an integral part of human 
behavior. Why do people dive into rushing water, give blood anonymously or risk 
their lives and those of their families to protect strangers? There is no quid 
pro quo for these acts, and like the rescuers who drowned in the Sierras this 
winter trying to save the young campers who fell through the ice, there were no 
familial ties between the victims and their would-be saviors. The answer seems 
to be that they felt the threat as if threatened themselves and acted to ease 
the pain. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt's book is less ambitious than Kohn's and a great deal more accessible. By 
dramatizing not only the heroics of memorable altruists but also the lives and 
motivations of the investigators who set up experiments or surveys to test 
their hypotheses, he leaves indelible impressions of his subjects. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt notes that good deeds, like the rescue of three car passengers from the 
frigid Potomac in 1982 by Arland Williams Jr., who died during the ordeal, are 
less understandable to most of us than those selfish, aggressive or brutal acts 
that benefit the actor. We tend to doubt the motives of heroes, suspecting that 
underneath it all there must be a lust for praise, for public approval. But 
whether or not there is such motivation, we cannot deny that heroic acts occur, 
acts in which "behavior is carried out to benefit another without anticipation 
of rewards from external sources." 
</P>
<P>
Hunt seems to accept the human capacity for evil without dwelling on its 
causes. Kohn, who is equally convinced that people are capable of generosity 
and kindness, does not seem to accept the explanation that man's inhumanity to 
man is part of the package. He attributes the contemporary acceptance of 
selfishness and brutality as facts of life to a mistaken general belief in 
heredity over environment. He implies that many people believe that our 
nastiness is biologically "hard-wired," and that non-negotiable factors such as 
excess testosterone in men or right-brainedness lead to aggression and 
insensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
While Hunt explores the personal motivations of the researchers whose work he 
describes, Kohn focuses on what he sees as the enemy -- sociobiology and 
scientific reductionism. Neither author pays much attention to animal models, 
but Hunt finds some work with animals worth describing. Rather than excoriate 
certain evolutionary biologists, he dismisses the idea that a single gene could 
be responsible for such complex human drives as ambition or romantic love. Hunt 
does not accuse scientists who use terms like "the altruistic gene" of serving 
an authoritarian political agenda. Rather he calls the phrase a scientific 
"shorthand: it refers to those built-in neural and visceral reactions to 
distress in others that are the substructure of altruistic behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Both authors build on the work of the late Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget, who 
discovered that infants and children develop in specific stages. Piaget's work 
implies that at a certain stage, usually about the age of 7, children are able 
to put themselves in someone else's shoes, to imagine someone else's pain, and 
act to soothe and comfort as they would like to be comforted. Both authors also 
refer frequently to the remarkable work of Holocaust survivor Saul Oliner, a 
Humboldt State University sociologist. Oliner mapped the motives, explanations 
and backgrounds of European Gentiles who risked their lives to save Jews during 
World War II. Contrary to expectation, he found that these altruists included 
both self-confident and insecure people, the deeply religious as well as 
atheists. The single trait these heroes shared was an upbringing free from 
corporal punishment where, instead, their parents reasoned with them. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt's approach is rich in anecdote and narrative. He includes a test so the 
reader can measure his or her own sensibilities. Kohn tends to emphasize the 
psychological and philosophical ramifications of what it takes to have a humane 
society. 
</P>
<P>
Besides style, a major difference in the way these authors document altruistic 
behavior is the way each suggests change be effected. Hunt seems, almost 
naively, to take for granted that most people want their children to be kind 
and generous and good. Kohn believes our selfishness is the product of a 
society dominated by people committed to competition and individualism. In 
fact, Kohn indicts individualism for the widespread appeal of belief systems 
that promise transcendence. He suggests that "our detachment from others has 
turned us into hitchhikers, anxious to escape the self in the first vehicle 
that comes down the road -- even one that propels us right past humanity." 
</P>
<P>
Their conclusions reveal their agendas. Hunt sums up: "Perhaps it is time for 
another call to arms. . . . to serve in a Helping Corps or a Samaritan Service 
would bring us to our feet cheering, sensing that our inner desire to do good 
to our fellow human beings can transform and ennoble us, and that when we ask 
not how we can be served but how we can serve, we ourselves are well serviced." 
And Kohn, clearly impressed by the feminist idea of Carol Gilligan that women 
speak "in a different voice," declares: "Very roughly, my intention here is to 
contrast an individual morality with a relational one, a cognitive morality 
with an affective one, a principle- or rule-based morality with one grounded in 
care or empathy." 
</P>
<P>
Although both authors downplay the evidence of altruism in other social 
mammals, those studies, together with the experiments they describe in their 
books, add weight to the argument that we are biologically as well as 
psychologically primed to act kindly toward one another. These tendencies can 
be cultivated by encouraging pro-social behavior in school and cooperative 
learning, as well as by example at home. Whatever the power of heredity, these 
authors are eager for the pendulum to swing toward the efficacy of a good 
environment and they intend, with their books, to give the pendulum a good 
push. Would that they are right, that human beings are kinder and more generous 
than it sometimes seems and that by cultivating empathy in our children we can 
achieve a more peaceable kingdom.

RE-CREATIONS: LAGUNA BEACH'S ANNUAL PAGEANT OF THE MASTERS IS A SURREAL, 
SOMETIMES QUIRKY BUT UNDENIABLY MESMERIZING TRIBUTE TO GREAT ARTWORKS.

LAGUNA BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Smeared with blue-green greasepaint, a naked young woman stands posed on stage 
while Tony the Tiger tells an audience that the "uninhibited freedom" of her 
orgiastic cult is "pure and radiant." 
</P>
<P>
Has some kind of smutty pagan/cornflake performance art taken over Laguna 
Beach's Irvine Bowl? Nope, it's just the Pageant of the Masters in a 
neoclassical moment, waxing idyllic about a bronze sculpture of a maenad that 
once decorated a private fountain. 
</P>
<P>
With Thurl Ravenscroft, the voice of the cereal-pitching tiger, providing 
narration, the 57th annual edition of the "living pictures" show unfolded 
Saturday, a surreal melange of art and stagecraft, pretentious, kitschy, 
sometimes cloying and -- undeniably -- mesmerizing. 
</P>
<P>
Using live models to pose in blown-up, brilliant copies of paintings, sculpture 
and decorative arts, the pageant inevitably produces a spectacle. The 
re-creations are like a television screen or a train wreck: It's nearly 
impossible to take one's eyes off them. 
</P>
<P>
They display a virtuosity in almost every theatrical craft. In fact, the 
pageant is a theater technician's fantasy land: It is perhaps the only 
production in which the skills of set painters, costumers, makeup experts and 
lighting technicians literally take center stage, free from the shackles of a 
playwright's script or an actor's ego. 
</P>
<P>
However, since it lacks any dramatic content, the pageant's impact is as 
ephemeral as a fireworks display. 
</P>
<P>
In choosing their repertoire, pageant directors carefully sift the artistic 
heritage of the world to remove anything remotely disturbing or challenging, 
leaving little but a collection of pleasant decorations. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the pageant's 23-piece program leans heavily on sentimental paintings 
by obscure 19th- and 20th-Century artists, along with a smattering of 
historical artifacts and more familiar works. This year's survey of famous art 
includes a Monet, a Matisse and Emanuel Leutze's "Washington Crossing the 
Delaware." 
</P>
<P>
Pop art is represented by Jules Cheret's fin de siecle posters for a Parisian 
ice skating rink. Tex-Mex sculptor Luis Jimenez is the token modern artist 
included, while exotica is handled with a display of antique Japanese festival 
dolls. The affair closes with the pageant's traditional finale, Leonardo da 
Vinci's "The Last Supper." 
</P>
<P>
The program moves more briskly than would be seemly in any museum; a few 
minutes of Ravenscroft's reading Dan Duling's reasonably informative script, a 
few minutes of eye strain to see if the models are breathing, and on to the 
next piece. No time here to contemplate the eternal verities of the muses. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, one does have two hours to contemplate how they make a 
three-dimensional reality look like a two-dimensional painting trying to look 
like a three-dimensional reality. There's room in the world for at least one 
Pageant of the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pageant of the Masters runs through Aug. 26 at the Irvine Bowl, 650 Laguna 
Canyon Road, Laguna Beach. Information: (714) 494-1145.

A FRESH AND WITTY 'FORUM'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A funny thing happened on the way to the La Jolla Playhouse: "A Funny Thing 
Happened on the Way to the Forum" became high class entertainment. That's 
Entertainment with a capital E, not a capital H, as in high-brow, which "Forum" 
could/should never be. 
</P>
<P>
It simply means that director Des McAnuff, choreographer Wayne Cilento, 
designers John Arnone (playful sets), Brenda Berry (jocular lights) and Susan 
Hilferty (tongue-in-cheek costumes) have taken the 1962 Burt Shevelove and 
Larry Gelbart book based on those immortal low-brow Roman gags of Plautus and 
added new fun and visual wit of their own. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't have to do anything to the gorgeous Stephen Sondheim music or 
lyrics (how do you improve on "I squeak, I squawk/Today I woke too weak to walk 
. . . ."?) except restore a couple of hitherto deleted songs. "The House of 
Marcus Lycus" is back to its original length and the exquisite love duet, "The 
Echo Song," uncharitably excised in the past, is happily back where it belongs. 
</P>
<P>
Orchestrator Bruce Coughlin has spiced things up with some embellishments a la 
Spike Jones, and musical director Ted Sperling and Steven A. Freeman have 
injected some strategic but noninvasive incidental music. All to the good. 
</P>
<P>
The results are a truly funny thing: a vivid, fast-moving, new-vision "Forum" 
for the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
McAnuff has called it a New Vaudeville "Forum," but never mind the semantics. 
What it comes down to is that, without hampering the old plot (the oldest of 
them all: the convoluted machinations of the slave Pseudolus to attain his 
freedom) or altering any of the sexist-chauvinist jokes and stereotypes (the 
harridan Domina, the hen-pecked Senex, the bevy of courtesans with such 
indiscreet names as Vibrata, Gymnasia and Panacea), McAnuff has breathed robust 
new life into them. 
</P>
<P>
He's given the women equal smarts, made them undiminished rebels instead of 
bimbo chattel, placed the show's emphasis squarely on everyone's unquenchable 
thirst for freedom (from slavery, from marriage, from parents, from contracts) 
and let it rip. 
</P>
<P>
This "Forum" moves like the wind, part Barnum &amp; Bailey, part Abbott and 
Costello (Ralph Bruneau's Hysterium rightfully gets just about equal billing 
with Ernie Sabella's Pseudolus), and is redolent with sight gags, word gags 
("Oh, Philia . . ."), chases, revolving houses that make comic statements of 
their own -- everything, in fact, except the kind of Las Vegas sleaze that has 
beset this appealing musical through the years, making it too often just 
appalling. 
</P>
<P>
Sabella, a Gorbachev look-alike, is a great dumpling of a Pseudolus -- a savvy 
jangle of loose nerves in a terminal snarl of self-defense. Given this show's 
affection for puns it's amazing he didn't end up being called Pandemonium. 
</P>
<P>
Without doing an imitation, Paul Keith's lech of a Senex is reminiscent of the 
late-great Phil Silvers in the role, while Liz Torres as his wife Domina, plays 
the virago aspects of the role with a surprisingly sympathetic subtext (it 
can't be all fun being married to Senex). 
</P>
<P>
Hero, their son, is a lovesick puppy at the proper hands of Jeff Blumenkrantz, 
while Pamela Winslow's Philia, the object of Hero's adoration, eschews the 
usual dumb-blond interpretation for the classier uneducated-but-not-stupid. It 
makes her instantly more interesting. As for George McDaniel as her smug, 
cock-o'-the-walk betrothed Roman general, Miles Gloriosus ("I am my own 
ideal"), he looks like a young William F. Buckley -- a coincidence that rather 
enhances the performance. 
</P>
<P>
But the overriding virtue of this co-presentation with the Orange County Center 
for the Performing Arts (where the show will play Aug. 17-21) is the director's 
regard for the dignity of comedy. McAnuff has respect for the material and a 
field day clowning it up -- up, mind you, not down. Cilento's choreography is 
never cheap; suggestive yes, in bad taste no. There's not a smidgen of 
vulgarity in this show, with a splendid pit band of 14 that keeps things at a 
frenzied pitch. 
</P>
<P>
It's a vibrant, unclean, saucy romp, filled with cleverness and wit, in which 
all elements come together to make it the summer's great Roman caper. Something 
for everyone. They don't make them much more entertaining than that. 
</P>
<P>
"Forum" may just be headed for Orange County next, but watch it go a lot 
farther. 
</P>
<P>

PHILHARMONIC INSTITUTE ORCHESTRA OPENS SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They've done it again. As in previous years, the pool of young instrumental 
talent gathered by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Institute has quickly coalesced 
into a remarkably fine-sounding orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
On the evidence of its first concert, Sunday evening in friendly, flattering 
Royce Hall, the 1990 edition of the Institute Orchestra has all the eager 
energy of its predecessors, plus an already developed idiosyncratic sonic 
sheen. 
</P>
<P>
As conducted by Heiichiro Ohyama, the big piece for the orchestra -- Brahms' 
First Symphony -- proved big indeed. Powerful, highly contrasted and almost 
exaggeratedly outsize, Ohyama's Brahms exerted a strong, often ponderous 
presence. Within the context of this monumental approach, fussy detailing and 
tempo fluctuations sometimes sapped momentum, but in cumulative impact seemed 
Mahlerian, both for better and for worse. 
</P>
<P>
The players met Brahms' -- and Ohyama's -- demands honorably. Their sound was 
never strident, and generally evenly balanced, although the strings could be 
easily submerged in the climaxes. There were moments of unsettled intonation in 
the woodwinds, and Ohyama's finicky tailoring could challenge brass 
articulation, but the overwhelming impression was one of controlled ardor. 
</P>
<P>
Equal poise and greater ensemble refinement were apparent in the orchestra's 
efforts on Elgar's Cello Concerto. Led by Stefan Sanderling, son of frequent 
Philharmonic guest Kurt Sanderling, the accompaniment proved worthy of the 
soloist. 
</P>
<P>
Which was no small achievement. Lynn Harrell, artistic director of the 
institute, may well be the most eloquent and expressive of instrumentalists in 
music of haunted and sublime lyricism. He brought an operatic concern for 
nuance of phrase and timbral variety to the concerto, effortlessly delivering 
the full measure of bravura while wringing all the yearning pathos from it. 
</P>
<P>
The evening began with a shimmering account of Mendelssohn's "Ruy Blas" 
Overture, deftly delineated by institute fellow Lan Shui, although at speeds 
that left some of the winds inarticulate. JOHN HENKEN

CHORAL SOCIETY OFFERS PROGRAM OF RARE WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY McQUILKIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nick Strimple, conductor of the Choral Society of Southern California, has long 
kept an eye open for unfamiliar works, and the programs given by the 7-year-old 
ensemble have usually reflected that. At Beverly Hills Presbyterian Church 
Sunday afternoon, listeners were introduced to no fewer than 10 works falling 
outside the pale of the standard repertory. 
</P>
<P>
How satisfying it was to discover the contrapuntal craftsmanship of Krystof 
Harant's six-part motet, "Qui Confidunt in Domino" written in 1598; the simple, 
unpretentious lyricism of William Billings' "David's Lamentation," and the 
spirited buoyancy of Carl Theodor Pachelbel's "Magnificat" (his only known 
work). 
</P>
<P>
Each performance reflected the virtues of musicianship and good taste: Musical 
lines flowed artfully, releases were clean and dynamics carefully observed. 
Because of sectional inequities within the 50-member chorus, however, Strimple 
was not able to perfect balances. 
</P>
<P>
Least satisfying were three choruses from Mozart's "Thamos, King of Egypt," K. 
345, which opened the program; the choristers brought insufficient clarity to 
the German text and insufficient confidence to some of their entrances. Soprano 
Barbara Hancock sang her solo lines handsomely; four other soloists performed 
acceptably. Pianist Timothy Steele provided effective accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
Midway though the program, organist Joyce Jones offered engaging readings of 
two contemporary Czech works, a brilliant, colorful piece by Jiri Dvoracek and 
a neatly constructed, less interesting one by Petr Eben. The Texas-based 
musician then skillfully exploited the wit in Ives' Variations on "America." 
</P>
<P>
The program closed with Louis Vierne's "Messe Solennelle," a typical, French 
Romantic expression of faith in a style not unlike Franck's. The singers gave a 
disciplined yet ebullient performance, and dual organists Jones and Steele 
added to the excitement. TERRY McQUILKIN

THE PUSH AND PANT OF VIRTUE'S NORTHERN ENGLAND LANDSCAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a week of walking through fields and small towns in Northern England last 
May, I finally began to understand why John Virtue's works look the way they 
do. After a while, the look of the landscape and the action of climbing and 
striding through it begin to merge, as if you couldn't visualize the view from 
a hill without recalling the pant and push to get there. 
</P>
<P>
On first glance, Virtue's large, shellac-stiffened black-and-white charcoal 
drawings appear to be regularly rising and falling abstract designs organized 
into grid formats. Closer inspection reveals a series of shadowy views of 
huddled villages, undulating hills, meandering fences, tipsy chimneys and 
shrouded Jane Eyre-ish houses. Puddles and lashings of black ink and drifts of 
white gouache envelop hill and dale in an elemental fury of wind, snow and 
rain. 
</P>
<P>
Virtue once worked as a postman in his native Lancashire, which obliged him 
constantly to walk around his own village. A decade ago, organizing the sheaves 
of small drawings he made into grid formats provided him a way out of his early 
impasse as a painter. 
</P>
<P>
In recent compositions he adeptly varies rhythm and mood by increasing or 
decreasing the amount of blackness, the size of the individual scene and the 
massing of images -- albeit always within a distinctly minor key. 
</P>
<P>
The pieces that don't work are the tiny single drawings. They're too flatly 
naturalistic and too sweetly miniaturized. Most disappointingly, they lack the 
insistent rhythmic effects of Virtue's vast patchworks of dark and light. 
Conversely, "Landscape No. 88," which contains 180 images, is the densest and 
richest piece in the show. A fine-grained all-over pattern, like an overgrowth 
of bracken, separates the imagery from the viewer much as tangled tree limbs 
screen the courtiers who've slept through 100 years in Act III of the ballet 
"Sleeping Beauty." 
</P>
<P>
Were Virtue a different kind of artist, one might see a social program here: a 
fond commentary on small towns slumbering through late 20th-Century upheaval. 
But he seems more preoccupied by the history of possibilities within the world 
of art: ways of expressing fidelity to what the eye sees, emotional attachment, 
and the coolly rational workings of the mind. 
</P>
<P>
His work is related in various ways to the dense, small-scale landscape 
etchings of his 18th-Century countryman Samuel Palmer, the art of his 
20th-Century countrymen and fellow walkers Richard Long and Hamish Fulton, the 
organizational strategies of Minimalism and the nervous, highly personal 
"handwriting" that came into its own with Abstract Expressionism. 
</P>
<P>
"Subversive Classicism Subverted" is the title for a miscellany of work by 
veteran Los Angeles painter Llyn Foulkes, Austrian artist Arnulf Rainer and 
Yasumasa Morimura, a young Japanese artist. 
</P>
<P>
Foulkes' line-up of small portraits of men is disfigured by Elephant Man 
swellings, dried blood and various collaged elements: cartoon eyes, a 
Dada-esque mask, a TV screen. They seem to be ordinary guys in drip-dry shirts 
who got mixed up in some nasty business -- got their faces bashed in, their 
brains rearranged -- by the same faceless enemy, the callousness of modern 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Rainer, who first came to avant-garde prominence in the '50s and '60s, when he 
covered paintings by various artists with monochromatic coats of paint, is 
probably best known for drawings on photographs of his own face and body. 
</P>
<P>
In the '70s he began using photographs of works by other artists. "Eight 
Paintings Over Works by F.X. Messerschmidt," from 1976-77, consists of large 
photographs of blandly classical sculptures of men's heads that Rainer defaced 
with a drizzle of black doodles. A darkly antic gesture, it suggests a primal 
rage against figures of perfection or authority, a need to make one's mark by 
cutting the other guy down to size. 
</P>
<P>
Morimura is the most genuinely "subversive" artist in the show. Although he 
belongs to the vast ranks of those who find sport in reworking paintings by 
icons of Western art, his elaborately rigged, posed and over-painted color 
photographs deal freshly and mischievously with cross-cultural and transsexual 
notions. 
</P>
<P>
In "Portrait (Fugato)," his largest set-piece, he inserts his own, 
incongruously blonde-wigged head and torso on Edouard Manet's nude prostitute, 
Olympia. Various subsidiary elements in the famous painting of that name are 
spruced up with Japanese textiles, flashy ornaments and anachronistic 
brushwork. Most obviously, the piece mocks the longstanding passion among 
Japanese for tasteful French art, which has reached a crescendo in recent 
big-ticket Impressionist auctions. "Olympia," on the other hand, cuts too close 
to the bone. Olympia's blatant stare and the pride of place devoted to the 
black servant call into question some ticklish issues for the Japanese: the 
still-lagging emancipation of women, the role of sex in a prudish society and a 
homogeneous society's unwitting acceptance of black stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
The imagery also plays on specifically Japanese artistic traditions. Posing as 
a woman has time-honored roots in Kabuki theater, in which certain male actors 
(onnagata) specialize in women's roles. The chief figures portrayed in Ukiyo-e 
woodblock prints, too, were either idle, sensuous woman, elaborately dressed, 
or actors who played women's roles. By slipping into the role of the onnagata, 
Morimura becomes the perfect commentator, at once embracing and unmasking his 
culture.

Modern Classics: Alfred Stieglitz and Diane Arbus are the odd couple in G. Ray 
Hawkins' inaugural show at his gallery's new Santa Monica location. But both 
photographers are represented with what have come to be considered classic 
images. In Arbus' case, it shows how little time it takes to become a classic 
these days, and how quickly our eyes adapt to what was once widely thought 
downright peculiar if not repellent. 
</P>
<P>
The Stieglitz photogravures from the first decade of the 20th-Century are 
vintage prints originally published in Stieglitz's famous modern art magazine, 
Camera Work, and suffused with the foggy grays beloved of the "pictorial" 
photographers. 
</P>
<P>
The familiar views of New York City are here: the uncluttered skyline of "Lower 
Manhattan," with a steamer puffing smoke against billowing clouds, a huge 
construction scaffolding looming over quaint mansard roofs and a streetcar in 
"Old and New New York." Other old friends include "The Steerage," the 
much-reproduced image of anxious-looking immigrants waiting to dock. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 Arbus prints -- all but two printed by an assistant but signed by the 
artist -- date from 1962 to 1970, a year before she died. Her most identifiable 
subjects were the kind of people children are taught not to stare at on the 
street, people who don't look "normal" either physically or mentally, or both. 
And yet it is the fidgeting, shouting boy -- identified in the accompanying 
description as retarded -- who shows the only spark of life in a portrait of a 
zombie-like Brooklyn family out for a Sunday stroll. 
</P>
<P>
But this particular selection of photographs is largely composed of images more 
broadly about the rituals and relationships of contemporary middle-class life 
-- the way women chose to deck themselves out in makeup and teased hair, the 
cheesy plastic, fringe and tinsel-bedecked splendor of a Levittown living room 
at Christmas, or the way each member of a suburban family relaxed in a private, 
touch-me-not cocoon on their spacious lawn. With a distance of two decades, 
Arbus seems to be more about style as a projection of the undercurrents of a 
culture.

STAGE BEAT: CONTROLLING INFLUENCES AT THEATRE OF NOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Theatre of Note is glancing back to its heyday in this evening of one-acts. The 
second, and most interesting of the two plays, was originally produced by the 
group in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The opener, a light comedy, just barely misses sitcom through its clever 
premise. Max is cooking dinner for his fiancee Doris, but his labors are 
interrupted by hack writer Ernie Penman. The twist is that, unknown to Max, his 
life follows a scenario written by Penman before Max was born, but his editor 
has mistakenly inserted eight blank pages in the saga, which leave it "Subject 
to Rewrites." 
</P>
<P>
Under Ed de'Leal's energetic direction, John Storey and D.C. Douglas have a 
wonderful time as the hero and his author, and Stacey Havener, who looks like 
Marilyn Monroe while sounding like Jean Hagen, is delightful as the ditzy, 
undecided fiancee. It's fluff but funny. 
</P>
<P>
Much stronger and more arresting is the revival, "Waiting for the Rain," by 
Stewart Skelton. The intense direction by Phil Ward and Dyanne DiRosario brings 
strong focus to a character study of a young man who has a habit of dragging 
home runaways from a neighboring park to alleviate his loneliness. 
</P>
<P>
Mark McPherson gives an intricate, touching performance as the reclusive 
country boy Eric, but his running chatter (his visitor doesn't speak) can't 
seem to break down the emotional wall surrounding the woman he rescued from the 
rain. Esther Ives Williams has a good quirky edge as the silent lost soul who 
has her own ideas about how the evening will end. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1705 N. Kenmore Ave., Hollywood; Fridays &amp; Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays,

YOUR BODY: THERE'S HELP IN QUELLING QUEASY RIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It is one of the most common medical problems associated with traveling. It can 
strike in the middle of an airplane ride, a roller-coaster ride, a cruise, even 
the briefest car trip. 
</P>
<P>
It is motion sickness. And whether it's just a slight queasiness or a 
gut-wrenching bout of nausea and vomiting, it can ruin a trip. 
</P>
<P>
Creative and physically fit people are among the most likely victims, two 
recent research studies suggest. But a local expert, Dr. Fred Linthicum, a 
researcher at the House Ear Institute, believes more research is needed. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to predict who will suffer motion sickness, he said, and hard 
to say which mode of transportation will cause the upset. People who get 
airsick don't necessarily get carsick, he said, and vice versa. "Different 
motions affect people differently. We don't know why." 
</P>
<P>
There are two theories currently enjoying popularity among motion sickness 
researchers, said Linthicum. According to one theory, the nervous system 
becomes overloaded with signals traveling simultaneously to the eyes and the 
ears. Another theory suggests that the brain's balance centers are close to the 
areas of the brain that receive vomit-reflex messages and the signals just get 
mixed up. 
</P>
<P>
"This last (theory) is more recent and makes the most sense to me," Linthicum 
said, "but it is still not proven." 
</P>
<P>
The afflicted are, understandably, more interested in prevention and remedies 
than causes. For help, Linthicum suggests over-the-counter medications like 
Dramamine. Or ask your doctor to prescribe a scopolamine patch, which can be 
placed behind the ear several hours before you embark. 
</P>
<P>
"Be sure not to use two patches," Linthicum warned, noting that many people 
overdose themselves with the patch. The patch can cause its own discomforts, he 
said. "It can blur the vision and give you a dry mouth." 
</P>
<P>
Low on Linthicum's list of preferred treatments is a wrist band designed to 
stimulate the acupressure point some believe is associated with nausea. 
"There's never been a controlled study (to prove) that this works," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Once you are on board ship, in a car or on a plane, try lying down and closing 
your eyes, said Linthicum. Travelers prone to motion sickness should not read 
while in motion, according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology -- Head 
and Neck Surgery. And don't sit in a seat that faces backward, says the 
academy. Queasy riders should also avoid strong odors and spicy foods before 
setting out on a trip. 
</P>
<P>
The motion-sick may take comfort in Linthicum's belief that the affliction is 
not psychologically based. "It's definitely not all in the head." 
</P>
<P>
For more information on motion sickness remedies, send a self-addressed, 
stamped envelope to the American Academy of Otolaryngology -- Head and Neck 
Surgery, 1 Prince St., Alexandria, Va. 22314.

Porter Shimer has the zeal of the recently reformed. Yes, he says, he once 
bought it all. The pavement pounding, the sweat-until-you-drop mentality, the 
endless rides to nowhere on a stationary bike. He used to carry 10-pound hand 
weights during his daily run -- in, he swears, a rubber suit in the middle of 
July. He was a fanatic about fitness. 
</P>
<P>
And what did it get him? 
</P>
<P>
Well, he says, he was lean, all right. 
</P>
<P>
And when he went to his doctor a few years back, the doctor thought Shimer had 
some kind of a heart defect because his resting pulse rate clocked in at 34 -- 
about half the average. 
</P>
<P>
But was Shimer fit? According to some definitions, he was. Was he healthy? 
Probably not, he now believes. And was he happy? Well, the answer to that is a 
resounding no. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a prisoner to it," the former editor of Rodale Press' "Executive Fitness 
Newsletter" says of his old workout schedule. "My exercise needs began to eat 
into my work hours. I didn't feel comfortable without it (working out)." 
</P>
<P>
Now Shimer no longer suffers from workout-aholism. He says he has jumped off 
the exercise treadmill -- at least compared to the old days. And he wants the 
rest of us to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
"The principles are that you don't need to exercise within the target heart 
rate to be healthy," he said of his new philosophy, outlined in a newly 
published book he co-wrote with exercise physiologist Bryant Stamford. 
</P>
<P>
The book is called "Fitness Without Exercise: The Scientifically Proven 
Strategy for Achieving Maximum Health with Minimum Effort." And while the title 
is something of a misnomer, Shimer insists that the book's premise is sound. 
</P>
<P>
"We look at 'exercise' as a magic bullet, but it's not," Shimer said recently 
at his home outside Limeport, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
According to Shimer, the reason most people don't exercise is that they think 
that to do any good, they've got to exercise their hearts out. For the last 10 
or 20 years, he said, people have been hearing fitness instructors and running 
gurus preaching that to get fit, people need to get their heart rate up to 60% 
to 80% of maximum capacity and keep it there, at minimum, for 20 minutes three 
times a week. 
</P>
<P>
For many, that idea was just too daunting, he said, so they stayed on the 
couch. And those who did try to meet the goal often ended up suffering from 
boredom, injuries or burnout. 
</P>
<P>
Shimer proposes that the idea of aerobic fitness isn't a true measure of 
health. People who do a lot of aerobic exercise may strengthen their hearts and 
be considered "fit," as he was, he says, and they may keep their weight down 
because aerobic exercise does burn fat. 
</P>
<P>
But, he says, all that may lead people to believe that if they do enough 
aerobic exercise, they can eat whatever they want -- including many fatty foods 
that ultimately contribute to disease. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, you can be aerobically fit but in rotten health. 
</P>
<P>
"You may look lean," Shimer said, "but your arteries can be a mess." So, 
leaping on new research that documents the benefits of "moderate" exercise, 
Shimer believes we need to redefine exercise to include any kind of physical 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
In his view, energy spent mowing the lawn counts as much as that used on a 
three-mile run. And the exertion you use playing a fun game of softball or 
volleyball with the guys after work is just as good as that spent on the rowing 
machine -- even if your heart doesn't pound the whole time. 
</P>
<P>
Spent the weekend cleaning the house? It counts. So does digging in the garden, 
raking leaves, grocery shopping, walking the dog, playing badminton with the 
kids, fixing the car or dancing. 
</P>
<P>
Even activity on the job -- moving stock, fixing pipes, climbing utility poles, 
chasing after 3-year-olds -- counts. 
</P>
<P>
"Aerobic exercise -- it burns a lot of calories. But you can burn those same 
calories and get something done," Shimer said, noting how silly it sounds to 
say that you're putting off household chores because you're too tired from 
working out. 
</P>
<P>
In place of aerobic training, Shimer and Stamford prescribe what they call 
"lipo-fitness." 
</P>
<P>
To achieve it, the two recommend any kind of activity that burns 2,000 calories 
a week -- combined with controlling the amount of fat in the diet. 
</P>
<P>
"The best way to keep fat out of your arteries is by keeping it out of the 
mouth," Shimer said. 
</P>
<P>
The book recommends that 20% of a person's calories come from fat -- less than 
the 30% the American Heart Assn. recommends. 
</P>
<P>
Stamford said that since following the dietary guidelines, he has been able to 
tone down his running workouts and still lose weight. 
</P>
<P>
The book lists recipes, fat counts and foods to be avoided, as well as 
activities that count as exercise and the calories they burn. 
</P>
<P>
"What our book is trying to do is open up the whole fitness concept to people 
who can't get into that torture."

FIRST PERSON: DESPITE TECHNOLOGY, TELEPHONE GADGETS STILL HAVE HANG-UPS

Aman I know was arguing with his car phone the other day. Considering the chaos 
that can ensue from even a minor malfunction in our technology-dependent lives, 
this was not so unusual. 
</P>
<P>
What was incredible was the way the telephone was arguing back. 
</P>
<P>
"Digit," it kept commanding in a firm, female voice. 
</P>
<P>
"End!" the man kept yelling. 
</P>
<P>
"Digit," it insisted. 
</P>
<P>
"No! End! End!" he retorted. 
</P>
<P>
And so on. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I've always found a car to be an excellent venue for an argument. There's 
something about the hum of the engine and the closeness of the environment that 
heightens one's combativeness while trivializing one's issues. Add traffic or 
an elusive destination to the mix and it's amazing how quickly you find 
yourself threatening divorce over the placement of a wad of gum in the ashtray. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, today's voice-activated phones are not unlike the more common 
car-based sparring partners, spouses in particular. They misinterpret things. 
They don't listen. They go charging off on their own little tangents, whence it 
is virtually impossible to retrieve them. 
</P>
<P>
The one big difference is that when you start the ignition, the phone says 
"hello" in a vaguely pleasant voice. 
</P>
<P>
My friend's car phone has been known to take erroneous cues from the radio, the 
tape deck, passing tractor-trailer trucks, toll collectors and the like. 
</P>
<P>
A blast of Madonna, say, and the thing announces it's "Ready." An ambulance 
sounds its siren and suddenly the office is on the line. A dog barks and the 
phone is hungry for another "Digit." 
</P>
<P>
I don't know what set it off the other day. Perhaps it was the way I was 
guffawing at the absurdity of a grown man getting into his car and exchanging 
verbal greetings with a little blinking box. When the two of them started their 
bizarre bickering, I suppose my shrieking didn't help any. 
</P>
<P>
I happen to have a grudge against phone gadgetry, thanks to the new cordless 
phone in my kitchen, the one that rings here whenever my neighbor's rings 
there, and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
At first I thought it was a godsend of ease, convenience and freedom. I could 
chase the kids around the house, change a diaper, take a walk on the front 
lawn, lock myself in a closet and never stop yakking. 
</P>
<P>
Now I am hounded, incessantly hounded by electronic wizardry gone haywire. In 
addition to its relentless ringing, the darned thing frequently cuts out in 
mid-conversation, overwhelmed by static whenever a nursery monitor is switched 
on in the near vicinity. 
</P>
<P>
It also often brings in uninvited parties and disrupts my routine repartee. The 
other day, in the middle of a business call, I suddenly heard my neighbor 
telling someone about a "massage" that "relieves tension." My ears burned; my 
conscience made me hang up. 
</P>
<P>
I will say one thing in defense of my cordless: It doesn't talk back. 
</P>
<P>
My sister recently answered her phone and heard a strange, computerized voice 
announcing that someone was calling collect. The voice paused to allow the 
caller to fill in his name, then asked my sister if she'd accept the charges. 
Since her hysterical laughter was neither a "yes" nor a "no," the voice became 
confused. Its revenge was to begin its script all over again, demanding -- and 
ultimately getting -- conformity. 
</P>
<P>
I suppose none of this is quite as frigidly high-tech as a machine calling a 
machine, a now commonplace point of contact between computerized telemarketing 
and home message recorders. 
</P>
<P>
But could there be a more potent symbol of modern alienation -- of the 
miscommunications, bad cues, scripted conversations that plague us all -- than 
this new verbal give-and-take between human and microchip? 
</P>
<P>
It seems to me we're having enough trouble communicating with each other as it 
is. 
</P>
<P>
The man with the talking car phone says he's grown rather attached to his 
little box, especially when he's driving too fast, which he often is. Instead 
of taking his hands off the steering wheel, he says it's a lot safer to simply 
put the pedal to the metal and yell, "Dial!" 
</P>
<P>
If he's lucky -- and the radio isn't too loud -- his phone won't argue.

A SHOWCASE FOR CONTROVERSIAL ART IN MARINA DEL REY; 
</P>
<P>
ART: THE LANNAN FOUNDATION'S GERHARD RICHTER EXHIBIT IS AN EXAMPLE OF A SHOW 
THAT IS DEEMED TOO POLITICAL TO ATTRACT CORPORATE SPONSORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Lannan Foundation has gone public. 
</P>
<P>
Formerly known mainly in art and literary circles as a $100-million foundation 
that quietly spends about $5 million annually in support of contemporary art 
and writing, Lannan will soon be recognized by a larger audience as a place to 
see the best of contemporary art. An elegant new exhibition space opens today 
at the foundation's headquarters in Marina del Rey with a politically charged 
show of paintings by German artist Gerhard Richter and a captivating outdoor 
installation by New York sculptor Tom Otterness. 
</P>
<P>
The Lannan Foundation has taken over a former air systems assembly plant, at 
5401 McConnell Ave. (one block north of Jefferson Boulevard) in a well groomed 
industrial area of Marina del Rey. The two-story building -- originally 
designed by Los Angeles architect William Kriesel and now remodeled by Kriesel 
with the help of Miami architect Mark Hampton -- includes 4,500 square feet of 
indoor gallery space and a 3,000-square-foot, walled garden for sculpture. Free 
exhibitions are open Tuesday through Saturday, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Most future shows will feature works from the foundation's own collection, 
established by the late financier and collector J. Patrick Lannan, but the 
inaugural exhibitions are loans. One of the shows, Richter's critically 
acclaimed suite of paintings called "18. Oktober 1977," was deemed so urgently 
deserving of a West Coast venue that the foundation rushed its remodeling 
project and opened the galleries several months ahead of schedule in order to 
book the show. 
</P>
<P>
"These are some of the best paintings I've seen in 10 years," said Lisa Lyons, 
the foundation's director of art programs, as she surveyed 15 black and white 
paintings based on the imprisonment and death of leaders of the German 
terrorist Red Army Faction group known as the Baader-Meinhof gang. "I've 
noticed that there's a lot of chatter in the galleries where photographs and 
documentation of the gang are displayed, but when people see the paintings, 
there is total silence. These paintings are just overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
Formed during the student anti-Vietnam War movement in West Berlin, the leftist 
Baader-Meinhof group wanted nothing less than to overthrow capitalism. Gang 
members perpetrated violent crimes during the 1970s and some of them were 
caught and imprisoned. Richter's chilling paintings, mostly based on press 
photographs, are named for the date when three gang members were found dead in 
their cells at Stuttgart's Stammheim Prison. Though the deaths were officially 
declared suicide, the affair is still a matter of intense debate in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Lyons said she learned that the St. Louis Art Museum was organizing a traveling 
exhibition of Richter's paintings when the museum asked the foundation for 
financial support. Lannan not only provided a grant but a showcase. After 
leaving Los Angeles, on Sept. 1, the paintings will be loaned for 10 years to 
the new Museum of Modern Art in Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
Lannan's ability to grab the Richter show during the only period when it was 
available provides an example of how foundations can respond quickly to 
opportunities, in contrast to museums that are booked up years in advance, 
Lyons said. Another function of the foundation will be to exhibit art that is 
deemed too political or controversial to attract corporate sponsors, as well as 
unwieldly work that is extremely difficult to display. 
</P>
<P>
Take Tom Otterness's 40-foot-long, 4-ton work, "The Tables," installed in the 
foundation's garden. The piece is composed of three Cor-Ten steel picnic tables 
that are covered with a fantastic array of miniature people, animals and 
monsters. One table represents "Nature," the second addresses "Urban Reality" 
and the third offers a view of "Industry." Meant to portray human follies and 
absurdities through the ages, the apocalyptic table-top scenes offer such 
horrific delights as a "whale bomb" that threatens an agrarian community, a 
"Humpty Dumpty/Nero" who fiddles while his house is undermined, and a voracious 
family of spiders who are about to consume a military-industrial complex. 
Visitors are invited to sit on benches attached to the tables and observe the 
comic spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
Otterness has only shown "The Tables" twice before, first at the Brooke 
Alexander Gallery in New York and then at the Museum of Modern Art. "The 
Tables," which has been in storage since the MOMA show in 1987, will be at the 
Lannan Foundation through Jan. 1, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Lyons views Richter's and Otterness' work as "complex meditations on history," 
but that will not be the constant theme of Lannan exhibitions. The gallery 
program will have a three-part focus, alternating selections from the 
foundation's collection with loan shows and one-person exhibitions 
predominantly drawn from the collection. The first solo show will feature the 
work of Nicholas Africano. 
</P>
<P>
"We get so many proposals for really worthy projects. It's heartbreaking to 
turn them down, but we can't be all things to all people. Quality is the first 
criterion, but it's a little like marriage. You pick your spouse carefully" 
when giving grants or launching exhibitions, said Lyons who was a curator at 
the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis from 1977 to 1983. She resigned to help 
found a private art consulting organization, The Museum Fund, and joined the 
Lannan staff last year. 
</P>
<P>
In her work with The Museum Fund, Lyons had hoped to develop a new approach to 
corporate philanthropy, but she found that most corporations were more 
interested in putting art on their own walls than in helping museums. Now at 
the Lannan Foundation, she directs a program that "supports, purchases and 
presents high-quality contemporary art, some of which is controversial," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't seek controversy, but we don't shy away from it either," Lyons said, 
noting that the foundation underwrote "Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment" 
at the Washington Project for the Arts in Washington last year after the 
Corcoran Gallery cancelled the show. 
</P>
<P>
Applications for Lannan grants have increased markedly during the subsequent 
controversy over government funding of art that may be deemed offensive. There 
is a mood of "desperation," she said, and "it is increasingly difficult for the 
foundation to carry out its work when the demand is so acute." 
</P>
<P>
J. Patrick Lannan, a longtime director of International Telephone and 
Telegraph, established the nonprofit Lannan Foundation in 1960 "to support and 
present high-quality, innovative and sometimes controversial forms of 
contemporary art and literature." Formerly based in Florida, where Lannan 
lived, the foundation moved to Los Angeles in 1986, three years after his 
death. Lannan's son, J. Patrick Lannan, Jr., became foundation president in 
1985, and he has said that the California move had much less to do with his 
longtime residence in Los Angeles than with the city's stature as an art 
center. 
</P>
<P>
Under his direction, the foundation has developed a program that aims "to 
further the careers of emerging and under-recognized artists and writers, to 
foster serious criticism and discussion of contemporary art and literature, and 
to bring new, experimental and provocative art and literature to a wider 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
The foundation owned and operated a museum in Lake Worth, Fla. from 1981 to 
1988, when the building and a collection of more than 1,000 American craft 
works and 20 pieces of kinetic art were donated to the Palm Beach Community 
College. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, when a program of visual arts grants was established, the 
foundation has given 95 grants ranging in value from "a few thousand dollars to 
several hundred times that," Lyons said. The awards include grants to major 
museums, such as the Museum of Modern Art's "Project Series," Los Angeles' 
Museum of Contemporary Art's recent retrospective of John Baldessari's work and 
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's current exhibition, "The Primal Spirit: 
Ten Contemporary Japanese Sculptors." Among smaller institutions to receive 
grants is Appalshop in Whiteburg, Ken., for an exhibition of Builder Levy's 
photographs of Appalachian coal miners. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to supporting exhibitions, the foundation buys art for its own 
collection and occasionally gives grants for acquisitions or to catalogue 
unusual collections and document projects. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation's literary programs, directed by Meghan A. Ferrill, include 
$35,000 Lannan Literary Awards, which have been granted to writers John Berger, 
Cid Corman and Wendell Berry.

CRITIC AT LARGE: DEAR GENA AND BEN: WE LOVED YOU IN 'LOVE LETTERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is nothing like an authentic phenomenon to pep up the idea of 
theatergoing, and A. R. Gurney's "Love Letters" is an authentic, 
no-question-about-it phenomenon and hit. It reaches its 100th performance this 
week at the Canon Theatre in Beverly Hills, with Michael Tucker and Jill 
Eikenberry as the latest in a long procession of couples who have read Gurney's 
mail. 
</P>
<P>
Last week it was Gena Rowlands and her old comrade-in-craft from her late 
husband John Cassavetes' films, Ben Gazzara, playing Melissa and Andy. Their 
performances concluded Sunday night. Rowlands, who has Academy Award 
nominations under her belt for "A Woman Under the Influence" and "Gloria" and 
almost every other acting honor you can think of, foreign and domestic, had 
done the Gurney play once before, a single offering aboard a cruise ship. 
</P>
<P>
After Friday night's sold-out performance, Gazzara said, "I read the text for 
the first time last Sunday night on the plane flying back from Rome so I could 
do it with this great lady." Gazzara has an arm's-long list of stage and screen 
credits from "End as a Man" and "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" to "A Letter to Three 
Wives" and Cassavetes' "Husbands." He was mastering the character of Matt while 
performing him, and his portrayal at week's end was strong and sure. 
</P>
<P>
The staged reading is not unprecedented. You think of Paul Gregory's touring 
productions of Stephen Vincent Benet's "John Brown's Body" and Shaw's "Don Juan 
in Hell" with Charles Laughton and other stars. Two-character plays are not 
unprecedented either, and "Two for the Seesaw" shines in memory. 
</P>
<P>
But the novelty of a fast-rotating cast is unprecedented, so far as I know, and 
the sight of two actors reading from three-ring notebooks at an inlaid 
refectory table on an otherwise bare stage will look unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
For the actor and actress, the nature of the play is a real and testing 
challenge. They are denied the use of body language, which is like playing 
quarterback with your ankles lashed together or trying to zip up a zipper with 
one hand. The acting has to be all voice and eyes -- and the uses of silence. 
</P>
<P>
Gurney's silences -- the letters not answered -- are as eloquent as anything 
this side of Harold Pinter. "Love Letters," as must by now be known by everyone 
who cares about the stage at all, follows the relationship of Andrew Makepeace 
Ladd III and Melissa Gardner from grade school through the next half-century of 
their lives: their lives apart, rather more than together, so that we hear 
their letters, which are childish, petulant, funny, snappish, pleading, 
apologetic, concealing, revealing, sexy, defensive, eloquent and, in the end, 
very affecting indeed in the pain and disappointment they disclose. 
</P>
<P>
Gurney's structure is clever, but his success with it is magical. Having 
laughed a very great deal in the course of the evening, you are first 
astonished and then moved to realize how much you have learned about these two 
people, and how much you care. 
</P>
<P>
They come out of a world that John O'Hara knew and wrote about, the 
Manhattan-Connecticut-Ivy League-Seven Sisters-Wall Street world of the quite 
rich and the even richer. The riches lead in Andy's case to a kind of driving 
ambition that seems motivated equally by noblesse oblige, conformity and a 
liking for power for its own sake. 
</P>
<P>
In Melissa's case, the riches lead to rebellion against and resignation to the 
expectations of class (both responses equally unsatisfactory). The ultimate 
perception is that money is an inadequate consolation prize for whatever you 
really wanted and didn't get. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the poor-little-rich-girl and poor-little-rich-boy romances, comedic and 
otherwise, of the Broadway-Hollywood past, Gurney's boy/man and girl/woman are 
too real and individual to be enjoyed and then dismissed as merely fictional 
types. In "Love Letters," one sees the hurt beneath his stuffiness and her 
caustic impudence. Their autumnal awareness that things have not worked out 
quite as they imagined and that time has slipped away from them is much closer 
to Chekhov than to Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
These characters don't float out of mind as you leave the foyer -- not as Ben 
Gazzara and Gena Rowlands delineated them, and not, I'm sure, as the other 
castings have enacted them, either. 
</P>
<P>
It's true, of course, that there are as many Hamlets as there are actors (and, 
indeed, actresses) who have played him. I suspect, having seen only the 
Gazzara-Rowlands casting, that Andy and Melissa change subtly but interestingly 
with each new team. It is a tribute to the text's powers of implication, and to 
the powers of the performers. 
</P>
<P>
As is also well-known to the faithful, Gurney himself played Andy, with Pamela 
Hammond as Melissa, in the first trying of "Love Letters" at the Long Wharf in 
New Haven. John Rubinstein and Kathleen Turner were the initial Manhattan 
teaming in February of 1989. Since then, in productions here and elsewhere 
around the country, Andy and Melissa have been played by a Who's Who of 
American stage and screen. Given the SRO business at the Canon, it seems likely 
there will be dozens more castings to come. 
</P>
<P>
Film actors particularly must relish the in-and-out short runs, ideal for brief 
hiatuses. But, at any length of run, the chance to speak A. R. Gurney's 
wonderful lines (and be eloquent sitting motionless) is a challenge no actor 
can really resist. 
</P>
<P>
One day there will surely be an entry in the Guinness Book of Records for 
whoever can prove they have seen the most changes of cast. I'm off to a slow 
start, and I can't imagine being more moved by a Melissa than Miss Rowlands', 
but I also can't imagine seeing "Love Letters" only once.

AIDS INFORMATION WITH AN ARTSY SPIN; 
</P>
<P>
PERFORMANCE ART: COSMETOLOGIST USES VIDEO AND MUSICAL SKITS TO GET A SAFE-SEX 
MESSAGE ACROSS TO HER MIDDLE-CLASS BLACK CLIENTELE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS SADOWNICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The term "only your hairdresser knows for sure," has taken on a whole new 
meaning in Columbia, S.C., where cosmetologist DiAna DiAna offers AIDS 
education to clients who routinely turn simple dye-jobs into confessions of 
sexual exploits and dreaded fears. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, what began in 1986 as DiAna's modest attempt to educate her 
"middle-class black clientele that black folks get AIDS," has evolved into a 
community-based, nonprofit organization with an artsy spin: the South Carolina 
AIDS Education Network. 
</P>
<P>
Run by the soft-spoken DiAna and Bambi Sumpter, who has a Ph.D. in public 
health, the network differs from most AIDS organizations because it operates 
out of a beauty shop and offers video screenings, performances, and musical 
skits to get its message across to clients trapped beneath dryers and 
misinformation. 
</P>
<P>
The unorthodox approach appealed to LACE's newly appointed video coordinator, 
Adriene Jenik, who says she brought the dynamic duo to L.A. to "inaugurate a 
new period where LACE begins working more actively with artists of color." 
</P>
<P>
"LACE is committed to redefining its art community and challenging old 
perceptions about LACE being too white and inaccessible," says Jenik. "That 
will necessitate showing work outside of LACE." 
</P>
<P>
As part of what executive director Roberto Bedoya sees as LACE's "new 
direction," LACE will screen Ellen Spiro's "DiAna's Hair Ego" tonight at 8:30 
at Jewel's Catch One -- a disco in L.A.'s black community. (L.A.'s 
International Gay &amp; Lesbian Film &amp; Video Festival also sponsors the 
event.) Proceeds benefit the network and Rue's House, a South Central AIDS 
hospice. 
</P>
<P>
Spiro, a New York City media artist, provides an intimate portrait of DiAna's 
beauty shop where a condom display is as natural as a basket of curlers. 
Afterwards, DiAna and Sumpter plan to stage a performance to encourage the 
club's gay and straight, black and Latino habitues to talk about safe sex. 
</P>
<P>
"Video is an important component for artists trying to adopt a more activist 
role in their communities," Jenik says. "It isn't site specific yet is 
reproduceable; it can enter people's homes yet it can also travel to diverse 
venues, crossing ethnic boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
"Video democratizes art so that people like DiAna who feel a burning need to 
make a statement can be effective and discover their artistic power outside of 
institutions." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the network receives no government funding and is supported by DiAna's 
business. DiAna says that last year she acted in an advisory role to Columbia's 
Health Department, but resigned when she saw that the "officials adopted tame 
AIDS education my community couldn't relate to." 
</P>
<P>
"The most challenging issue in AIDS is how to speak in people's own idioms," 
Sumpter adds. 
</P>
<P>
"We've made parents realize that if they wish to avoid talking to their 
children about straight or gay sex, their children could die. Now churches 
invite us to speak and demonstrate our safe-sex kits to the teen-agers." 
</P>
<P>
While DiAna scoffs at being called the media artist of the future, she admits 
that she would use any strategy to get her point across. " 'Just Say No' " 
speeches do little to alter clients' behavior," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"Blacks are one of the fastest growing AIDS populations in the nation," she 
adds. "Most women with AIDS in America are black. I tell the couples who see me 
that just because they are married doesn't mean that they should be so trusting 
to abandon safe sex." 
</P>
<P>
Sumpter says that there are few places in South Carolina besides the beauty 
shop to go for candid AIDS education. "There is no anonymous testing in the 
whole state and people are routinely quarantined," she adds. "Yet (the network) 
is attacked by politicians who say we are promoting promiscuity." 
</P>
<P>
Phill Wilson, training director for the National Task Force on AIDS Prevention, 
who is based in L.A., argues that Los Angeles County has "similarly failed to 
address the specific education needs of people of color." He offers safe sex 
seminars throughout L.A., and adds that SCAEN's creative model can be 
inspirational. 
</P>
<P>
Where did DiAna acquire her fascination with AIDS and art? 
</P>
<P>
"It just happened," she says, nonchalantly. "I found out that it's not so hard 
to try and keep a few people from dying while you're trying to get through your 
own life. If you do it with style, you might actually make a lasting impact."

RICK DU BROW: TIME IS NOW FOR NBC'S RATINGS MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
TV or not TV. . . . 
</P>
<P>
LEAP OF FAITH: Those five straight nights of "Quantum Leap" -- a success in 
last week's ratings -- weren't just an NBC publicity stunt. 
</P>
<P>
The time-travel series with Scott Bakula may be critical to keeping NBC No. 1, 
so getting 60 million viewers to sample the show during the weeklong exposure 
was shrewd. 
</P>
<P>
Here's why: 
</P>
<P>
With NBC's backbone series -- "The Cosby Show," "Cheers" and "The Golden Girls" 
-- all aging, the network is putting on a full-court press every night in the 
new fall season to shore itself up for the future. 
</P>
<P>
"Quantum Leap" is being switched from Wednesdays to lead off Fridays, where NBC 
has been weak since the heyday of "Miami Vice." 
</P>
<P>
Last season's Friday NBC schedule was another ratings flop with "Baywatch," 
"Hardball" and "Mancuso, F.B.I." 
</P>
<P>
But even competitors are praising NBC's lineup to win back Fridays this fall: 
"Quantum Leap," "Night Court," "Wings" and "Midnight Caller." 
</P>
<P>
The idea is to knock off ABC's winning Friday lineup that includes "Full 
House," "Family Matters," "Perfect Strangers" and "20/20." 
</P>
<P>
NBC entertainment boss Brandon Tartikoff is indicating the new season is 
crucial to his network, and he's not kidding. 
</P>
<P>
It could set NBC up in business for the '90s, or hasten the end of its 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
STAYING POWER: Carol Burnett's been around a long time, but her "Carol &amp; 
Company" series beat everyone with the young 18-to-49 audience -- including her 
strong lead-in tandem on NBC, "The Golden Girls" and "Empty Nest." 
</P>
<P>
EYE FOR TALENT: "60 Minutes" producer Don Hewitt says that when Barbara Walters 
worked behind the scenes with NBC's "Today," she visited him at CBS: "She said, 
'I want to be a broadcaster.' I said, 'Barbara, dear, ain't nobody ever gonna 
hire you to broadcast . . . not with your voice.' " Hewitt's two-part interview 
on NBC's "Later with Bob Costas," which began Monday night, resumes tonight. 
</P>
<P>
TROUBLE: "NBC Nightly News" got hammered by "ABC's World News Tonight" by a 
huge margin -- 2.4 rating points -- the week of June 25-29. That's a gap of 
more than 2 million TV homes. Peter Jennings' ABC newscast now has won 25 
consecutive weeks and 38 of the last 39 in the competition with the nightly 
roundups of CBS' Dan Rather and NBC's Tom Brokaw. 
</P>
<P>
INSIDE MOVES: Brokaw &amp; Co. are taking steps to halt his program's ratings 
slump. This week, "NBC Nightly News" has a series called "America: Are We Still 
Number One?" And July 19, Brokaw anchors the program from the Richard Nixon 
presidential library in Yorba Linda on the day it's dedicated. Meaty 
possibilities now that it's been disclosed that there is a controversy among 
scholars because the library will screen papers to be stored there and may also 
screen researchers. 
</P>
<P>
STILL PITCHING: Never saw a better sports interview on TV than Roy Firestone's 
talk with long-ago Dodger hurler Carl Erskine on ESPN. Now the president of a 
bank in Indiana, the 64-year-old Erskine, trim, white-haired and leading-man 
handsome, was wonderfully human and intelligent. As for the point that he was 
the guy you looked to in a high-stakes game -- fair enough. But let's not 
forget Johnny Podres. 
</P>
<P>
LATE-WATCH: Among the guest hosts on CBS' "Nightwatch" as it seeks a 
replacement for Charlie Rose: Elvis Mitchell, film critic for California 
magazine, former film critic for the L.A. Weekly and, before that, TV critic of 
the Herald Examiner. Caught him last week exchanging zingers with one of his 
interview subjects, Bill Murray. 
</P>
<P>
FAST COPY: Strong casting in CBS' new fall drama series "WIOU," about a failing 
local TV news operation -- John Shea, Helen Shaver, Mariette Hartley, Harris 
Yulin and Dick Van Patten. And this exchange, too, between an aspiring young 
woman anchor and a producer: Anchor: "I just want to be good." Producer: "And 
they (management) just want you to be good-looking." 
</P>
<P>
DATE BOOK: Jane Pauley visits Dave Letterman's show Friday night. Enough said. 
</P>
<P>
ROOTS: We have in hand an article from Motion Picture magazine of October, 
1931. There is a terrifying headline: "Will Television Mean the End of Garbo?" 
TV, you see, "will be bad news for blondes" because they "do not 'screen' 
well." And "redheads are colorless in television broadcasts," so Clara Bow and 
Mary Astor "will have to become brunettes." Panic, Hollywood-style (pre-Lucy). 
</P>
<P>
BATTLE STATIONS: It won't be tea and crumpets for PBS this fall. Faced with 
cable competition, PBS is getting in there and fighting for its audience with 
"Showcase Week" Sept. 30-Oct. 5, previewing public TV's new season. What's 
more, PBS will step up its "stripping" of series -- that is, show them on 
consecutive nights -- starting with "The Civil War," an 11-hour documentary 
that runs from Sept. 23-27. Voices for "The Civil War" include Julie Harris, 
Kurt Vonnegut, Arthur Miller, Studs Terkel and Garrison Keillor. 
</P>
<P>
COMEBACK TRAIL: CBS has made it official -- the Western series "Paradise," 
bumped from this fall's schedule, has won renewal nonetheless as a midseason 
replacement. Eight-episode commitment with Lee Horsley back as the 
gunman-turned-father, says the network. 
</P>
<P>
FASHION NOTE: What wonderful overcoats Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce wore in 
those "Sherlock Holmes" films that pop up on TV. You can almost feel the fog as 
they walk into a room. 
</P>
<P>
BEING THERE: "You're never too old to do goofy stuff," observed good old dad 
Ward Cleaver (Hugh Beaumont) on "Leave It to Beaver." 
</P>
<P>
Say good night, Gracie. . . .

'BIG STANTON' SWEEP NETS SUSPECT IN APRIL MURDER

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police swept through the "Big Stanton" neighborhood at dawn Monday, searching 
homes of several suspected gang members and arresting a 15-year-old boy on 
suspicion of murdering Rosendo Ibarra, a 17-year-old who was shot in the head 
in April while talking to his girlfriend at a pay phone. 
</P>
<P>
Police have arrest warrants for two other suspects in the murder: Martin Rene 
Rodriguez, 21, the man suspected of pulling the trigger, and Joseph David 
Kehler, who was arrested in the slaying in May but who was never charged and 
was subsequently released. Neither was in custody as of Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old suspect, who as a minor was not identified, is accused of 
helping plan the attack and standing next to the gunman during the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
The Ibarra murder is the latest spasm in a three-generation rivalry between 
residents of Big Stanton and the La Colonia Independencia neighborhood, where 
Ibarra lived. Despite the bad blood, police say they've had to work the case 
with little help from either neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Even Ibarra's friends are enforcing the rule of silence. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's testifying against nobody on this side," said one of them, a burly 
man who stood in the dusty yard of a small wooden house in La Colonia, a few 
doors down from where Ibarra had lived. His arms and neck were covered with La 
Colonia tattoos, which he said were a souvenir from San Quentin. "What 
happened, happened. But there ain't no informants here." 
</P>
<P>
"Luckily, our case isn't based upon those people anyway," Garden Grove Police 
Detective Mike Handfield said. "Our case is based on ballistic evidence, and 
evidence from other people that are outside the gang." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Anaheim police and the Orange County Sheriff's Department reported 
three drive-by attacks on young men in the two neighborhoods in the past week. 
Authorities could not say Monday whether the shootings are related to the 
Colonia-Stanton feud, chiefly because the victims have declined to tell police 
who shot them. 
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, 18-year-old Cesar Navarro was shot in the leg on Flower Street 
in Stanton, in the heart of Big Stanton territory, Orange County Sheriff's Lt. 
Bob Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, according to neighbors, Navarro's younger brother went to visit 
him at Humana Hospital-West Anaheim and was shot in the hospital parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"A vehicle pulled up and asked 'who he claimed,' (meaning) what his territory 
was or his gang affiliation," said Anaheim Police Sgt. Chet Berry. "He replied, 
'Big Stanton,' and somebody in the car pulled out a gun and shot him in the 
left wrist." 
</P>
<P>
Both brothers gave only the vaguest accounts of their attackers, Berry and 
Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
A 17-year-old shot through the shoulder early Saturday morning in a drive-by 
attack on Berry Street, in La Colonia turf, was similarly unhelpful, Rivas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"When people are shot, they're uncooperative," Rivas said. "They don't even 
want to give a description. A lot of these people want to settle things on 
their own." 
</P>
<P>
The hunt for Ibarra's killers has taken two months and made several hairpin 
turns. 
</P>
<P>
Police say Ibarra was a member of the Colonia gang. Relatives deny it. The 
father of a 1-year-old daughter, Ibarra had dropped out of Magnolia High School 
in his junior year and had been living with an aunt on Berry Street, an 
unincorporated area tucked amid Stanton, Anaheim and Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
Ibarra was often seen at a telephone booth in a shopping mall in Garden Grove, 
about a block away, because he had a girlfriend in Los Angeles, and his aunt 
did not have a telephone, relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
About 11 p.m. on April 30, Ibarra was shot in the head. A cousin rushed out of 
the house and cradled him in her arms as he died. 
</P>
<P>
About 11:30 p.m., Cypress police arrested Joe David Kehler, 23, at a loud party 
in a motel room, about three miles west of the murder scene. While police were 
arresting Kehler and a friend on drug charges, they stumbled onto a link to the 
Ibarra shooting. Investigators also found a .38-caliber revolver that they 
believe to be the murder weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Kehler and a second man, David Alan Davis, 22, were later arrested on suspicion 
of murder, but evidence from the preliminary investigation was insufficient to 
charge them with the killing, Garden Grove Detective Handfield said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis was released, while Kehler remained in custody on a drug charge. 
</P>
<P>
"But they let (Kehler) out for whatever reason, and now we can't find him," 
Handfield added. 
</P>
<P>
Kehler said in a newspaper interview that he was at the murder scene but denied 
taking part. 
</P>
<P>
According to Handfield, Kehler, Davis, Rodgriguez, the 15-year-old and possibly 
another person were in the car that drove up to Ibarra. Rodriguez and the 
15-year-old got out of the car and walked up to the victim, and Rodriguez shot 
him, the detective alleged. 
</P>
<P>
Davis was not charged and is considered a witness, Handfield said. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old was charged with homicide and is to appear at a detention 
hearing today in Juvenile Court, according to Orange County Senior Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Dennis Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez's father, Robert S. Rodriguez, sat on his porch Monday outside the 
Rose Street home that sheriff's deputies had searched for nearly an hour. His 
son, known as Rene, no longer lives there, the father said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even know where he lives," Rodriguez said. "As soon as he sees me, he 
takes off." 
</P>
<P>
But Rodriguez said he does not believe his son is guilty of murder. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think so. He doesn't want to work, but to me, he's not a bad guy." But 
he added, "If he comes (home), I'm gonna call the cops for sure. I don't want 
him in the street." 
</P>
<P>
Cars often drive by the house and shoot, said Rodriguez's 9-year-old daughter, 
Jessica. When they come, "I just lay down on the floor. My friend (two houses 
down) almost got shot," she said, holding her small hands about six inches 
apart. "It came that close." 
</P>
<P>
Across the street, a man who identified himself as Rene Rodriguez's cousin had 
a tattoo across his back that read "Stanton," elaborate blue drawings on both 
arms, a foot-long scar down the center of his chest, and "Orange County" 
engraved on his stomach -- the only tattoo, he said, that had really hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the conflict with Colonia, the man, who said he had quit the gang 
10 years ago, pointed at the Rodriguez home: "They built that house in 1936, 
and there was stuff going on then. . . . It's been going on for years. It's 
going to keep on going. They probably don't even remember what it started 
over." 
</P>
<P>
A mile away in La Colonia, Ibarra's friend's markings were nearly identical -- 
down to the gang initials tattooed on the left side of each man's neck, so as 
to be clearly visible above the T-shirt line. They read "L.C." instead of 
"STN." 
</P>
<P>
And his sentiments were nearly identical. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our barrio here, this is not a gang," said the man, who, like his 
rival, refused to give his name. "From one generation to another, it's just 
going to keep going on. I was born here, you know, and that's the way it is. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody here knows what happened (to Ibarra,)" he added. "Nobody's seen 
nothing. See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil, all that stuff. Nobody's 
testifying against nobody."

REGIONAL REPORT THE DROUGHT; 
</P>
<P>
MANY CITIES SAVE WATER WITHOUT PENALTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
As the Los Angeles City Council prepares to vote Friday on a mandatory 
water-rationing ordinance, many Southern California cities already are 
conserving an average of 12% by using less stringent water-saving approaches, 
according to the giant Metropolitan Water District. 
</P>
<P>
From San Diego to Glendale, water officials reported that usage has dropped by 
8% to 16% under largely voluntary programs since officials asked residents four 
months ago to conserve water in the face of a fourth year of drought 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, consumption was down 5% to 8% during June, compared to the 
same month last year and following adjustments for population growth and 
temperature differences, according to the Municipal Water District of Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Even without rationing, Los Angeles' current program is one of the most 
successful, with consumption down 15.5% during June compared to the same month 
in 1986, according to the city Department of Water and Power. 
</P>
<P>
The success of voluntary programs -- and limited mandatory restrictions such as 
bans on daytime lawn watering and hosing down driveways -- has convinced the 
largest water agencies in the Southland that rationing is not necessary this 
year, according to interviews Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to use the carrot before the stick," said Carl Boronkay, general 
manager of the MWD, which serves 27 agencies stretching from Ventura to the 
Mexican border. "Save the stick if you think we can accomplish this without it 
. . . and I think we will." 
</P>
<P>
The MWD has asked water agencies to cut water use 10% this year to make up for 
a projected shortage in supplies. 
</P>
<P>
But water agencies have been using about 12% less, according to an MWD study 
obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, several water agencies report that customers are heeding the 
call for voluntary conservation. The Moulton Niguel Water District in Laguna 
Niguel, for example, reported that it has experienced a 10% reduction in usage 
for both the months of May and June. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be deaf, dumb and blind not to realize there is a water problem," 
said Jim Smith, director of operations for the district that covers much of 
South Orange County. "I think people are being very conscious how they use 
water." 
</P>
<P>
At the Irvine Ranch Water District in Irvine, officials say the public's 
response to voluntary conservation is evidenced by the fact that customers have 
snapped up about 1,000 water awareness kits in recent weeks. Many more 
customers are also asking for water audits to see how they can better conserve, 
said Joyce Gwidt, public relations manager for the district. 
</P>
<P>
In Long Beach, Water Department General Manager Dan Davis said residents are 
conserving at about the 10% level, when figures are adjusted for population 
growth and weather changes. In addition, the city gets about 7% of its water 
supply from reclaimed sewage. 
</P>
<P>
"We're encouraged that the water conservation ethic is here," said Davis. "Long 
Beach has certainly done its part. . . . If everyone else does, we'll get 
through this year." 
</P>
<P>
And Davis, like most other Southern California water officials interviewed, 
said he believes they can get through the year without rationing. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley has called on the MWD to follow his lead and encourage its members 
agencies to adopt rationing programs, but even Los Angeles' eight 
representatives on the MWD board of directors have ignored the mayor's call. 
</P>
<P>
Some Los Angeles directors have approached Boronkay informally about the 
rationing idea, but they dropped it in the face of apparent strong opposition 
from the other member agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"We just know it would never pass," said Marilyn Garcia, a Bradley appointee to 
the board. 
</P>
<P>
So far, in this fourth year of drought, rationing has been implemented in only 
a few hard-hit areas of Southern California that have special water supply 
problems, such as Santa Barbara and San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
Many central Coast cities not connected to the state water project have adopted 
rationing, and in the north, San Francisco implemented rationing several months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles would be the first city in the south with a ample supply of water 
for this year to adopt rationing. Initially, Bradley warned residents that if 
they did not cut use by 10%, they would face rationing. 
</P>
<P>
Since that first call in April, city residents have responded, according to 
figures complied by the DWP. Besides the 15.5% cut in June, water use dropped 
11.7% in May and 12.2% in April, compared to the same months in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But Bradley has pressed for rationing, arguing that residents will backslide 
once the issue drops off the front pages and evening news programs. "It will be 
impossible to keep up the steady drum beat of publicity," said Mark Fabiani, 
Bradley's chief of staff. And besides, he said, if saving 10% is so easy, only 
those who are not cooperating will be snared by the program's surcharges. 
</P>
<P>
Under Bradley's proposal, residents would be limited to using 90% of the water 
they used in comparable periods of 1986 -- before the drought and 
city-sponsored conservation efforts began. 
</P>
<P>
Residents and businesses using more than their allotment would face a surcharge 
of $3 per billing unit of excess use, plus 15% of the water bill on the first 
violation. A second violation would cost $3 dollars per billing unit, plus 25% 
of the bill, and a third violation would boost the surcharge to $4 per excess 
billing unit and 75% of the bill. A billing unit is 748 gallons; the average 
family uses between 300 and 500 gallons a day. 
</P>
<P>
Implementation of rationing would cost more than $1 million dollars and all 
residents would face a 9-cent per billing unit increase -- about $2 to the 
average residential bill -- to cover the costs of the program and the reduced 
water sales. 
</P>
<P>
With rationing, Fabiani said, Los Angeles will be better prepared than the rest 
of the Southland should the drought drag on into a fifth year. A 10% cut this 
year, he said, may keep the city from having to adopt a 25% rationing plan next 
year if the drought continues. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of rationing has kept the issue in front of residents and 
contributed to the high rate of conservation, Fabiani said. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the two largest Southland cities -- San Diego and Los Angeles -- 
have the highest rates of conservation and have achieved them through opposite 
approaches. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles has carried the banner for mandatory rationing, arguing that it 
will be necessary in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
Boronkay of the MWD, which wholesales water to both agencies, said Monday, "We 
just want the goal accomplished. However that is done is OK with us."

OCTC SETS STAGE FOR RESURRECTION OF MEASURE M 
</P>

<P>
Despite lingering questions of whether the timing is right, the Orange County 
Transportation Commission took its first steps Monday toward putting Measure M, 
a half-cent sales tax hike for freeway and rail improvements, on the ballot 
just one year after it was defeated by voters. 
</P>
<P>
After a rambling, hourlong discussion at the county's Hall of Administration, 
the commission voted unanimously to hold a pair of public forums in the next 
two weeks, setting the stage for a decision by the end of the month on whether 
to test the measure in November or wait until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Commission Chairman Dana W. Reed and other supporters are pushing for the 
earlier vote on the half-cent tax, which was defeated 53% to 47% by Orange 
County voters in November, 1989. They argue that any delay threatens to strip 
the county of the money it needs to tackle the region's daunting traffic 
troubles. 
</P>
<P>
"We can solve the transportation problem in Orange County," Reed declared in an 
impassioned, 10-minute address during the commission meeting. "This is 
something absolutely critical to the future of Orange County. It's critical for 
us and our children." 
</P>
<P>
But Supervisors Roger R. Stanton and Harriett M. Wieder, who also sit on the 
commission, expressed concern Monday that the proposition, which is expected to 
again be called Measure M, would only end up failing if it is rushed again onto 
the ballot. The pair noted that Orange County voters were roundly opposed to 
Proposition 111, the state gas-tax increase that was approved in June. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you have to factor in what happened with Proposition 111 in Orange 
County," Wieder said. "I perceive that voters will say, 'You already passed 
111. Don't you have enough money?' " 
</P>
<P>
Stanton said he would rather see an advisory measure placed on the November 
ballot offering county voters a menu of options for spending the more than 
estimated $3 billion that could be raised over a 20-year period by a half-cent 
sales tax increase. The results of the advisory measure could then be 
incorporated in a ballot measure sometime in 1992, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Past opponents of the tax have also promised to renew their fight against the 
half-cent tax hike proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne King, a director of Drivers for Highway Safety, an Orange County-based 
group opposed to car-pool lanes, called Measure M "a boondoggle that must stop" 
and complained that "fundamental change is needed" in the county's plans for 
spending the money generated by the sales tax. King said he would like to see 
the money go toward construction of new, general-use freeway lanes, not 
car-pool lanes and rail improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Rogers, an Orange County slow-growth advocate and leader of the Proposition 
111 opposition, believes that plans for the half-cent tax hike "need an 
overhaul" and suggested that many voters have it in the "backs of their minds 
that this is going to help developers." 
</P>
<P>
But supporters of putting the measure on the ballot in November contend that 
time is of the essence. 
</P>
<P>
Reed and others argue that sales-tax money is needed not only to help directly 
finance road and rail projects in the county, but to also attract matching 
federal and state dollars. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, they argue, the county is hurting for the matching money, putting it 
in a troublesome position in competing for the dollars that will be generated 
by Proposition 111 and other transportation measures approved by state voters 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
If the sales tax is not approved in November, the county could lose upwards of 
$200 million in state and federal money by 1992, officials with the 
Transportation Commission predict. 
</P>
<P>
While the sums that would be generated by Measure M are huge, Reed said the 
impact on a consumer's pocket book would be relatively minimal, amounting to 
about $5 a month for a family with an annual income between $55,000 and 
$60,000. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a saying that there is no free lunch. But in this case, lunch is not 
very expensive," Reed said, adding that $5 is "less than the cost of a movie. . 
. . I don't think this is a boondoggle." 
</P>
<P>
A poll conducted for the commission between June 15 and 20 found that residents 
favor a half-cent tax increase by a 52%-39% margin. The poll was conducted by 
Sacramento-based J. Moore Methods and surveyed a random sample of 600 county 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
The resurrected Measure M would allocate $1.3 billion to freeway construction, 
$1 billion to regional and local street and road projects and $775 million to 
transit improvements.

MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO DEFRAUDING 3 OF SAVINGS;

CRIME: A FORMER INSURANCE BROKER STOLE MORE THAN $600,000 FROM THREE ELDERLY 
PEOPLE. HE FACES UP TO 30 YEARS IN PRISON.

<P>
A former insurance broker from Mission Viejo who befriended three elderly 
investors, including a 102-year-old man, pleaded guilty in federal court Monday 
of defrauding them of more than $600,000 in a sophisticated investment scheme, 
federal prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Jacques (Jack) Doigny, 43, who also owned a failed wholesale soccer supply 
business in Anaheim, faces up to 30 years in federal prison for masterminding a 
plot to bilk the victims of their life savings, Assistant U.S. Atty. John Walsh 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Atwater, Calif., residents Peter Ross, 102, and wife Esther, 83, gave Doigny 
$230,000 in early 1988 to invest in annuities and relied on him to perform a 
variety of secretarial chores, including filing their income tax returns for 
them, the victims said. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Aldridge, 75, of Hollywood, a close friend of the Rosses, invested $394,000 
with Doigny, Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
Doigny used the money to support an extravagant lifestyle that included several 
European vacations, a motor home and a new house in Mission Viejo, and also to 
bolster the Soccer Warehouse, his financially ailing company, Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
Doigny, a native of Italy who has lived all over Europe and Israel, is being 
held without bail at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles. He is to 
be sentenced by U.S. District Judge James M. Ideman on Sept. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Doigny had been a fugitive for four months when he was arrested in Tucson in 
April. He was using several aliases and had a forged passport at the time, 
Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
In an agreement with prosecutors, Doigny pleaded guilty to three counts of 
securities fraud and three counts of mail fraud in exchange for the dropping of 
14 other counts, Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so sorry for him," Esther Ross said in a telephone interview. "He really 
had a good heart. It was just one of those things that happens to people who 
have a love for money. He wanted everything, and he wanted to be the best. That 
led to his downfall." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the Rosses recovered all but a few thousand dollars of their 
money, Peter Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
Aldridge was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
According to Walsh and the Rosses, here is how the scheme worked: 
</P>
<P>
In early 1988, as an agent with Mutual of Omaha in Los Angeles, Doigny 
persuaded the three to invest in annuities. The money from the three was 
actually invested a money-market account under their names but with Doigny's 
home address. Using Mutual of Omaha letterhead and a software program stolen 
from the company, Doigny sent the three fake computerized statements purporting 
to show that they were earning interest on their nonexistent annuities. 
</P>
<P>
"They certainly looked like the real thing," Peter Ross said, "but he fooled us 
and Roy too." 
</P>
<P>
Doigny, by forging his clients' signatures, repeatedly dipped into the money 
market account, using it like a checking account to write checks to himself and 
for his troubled business, Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
"These people he defrauded were particularly vulnerable people," Walsh said. 
"Their primary vulnerability was their age. They trusted him." 
</P>
<P>
Soon after he began the scheme, Doigny was fired from Mutual of Omaha on 
unrelated allegations involving fraud and theft, Walsh said. Doigny was never 
charged with any crime as a result of those allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Doigny did not tell his clients that he had been terminated, continuing his 
relationship with them. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Ross later became suspicious, however. He discovered that he and his wife 
were victims of fraud when he asked the insurance company about the state of 
his annuities. Mutual of Omaha later repaid most of the Rosses' money because 
their account had been bonded, Peter Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
After they learned of Doigny's scheme, Mutual of Omaha officials asked Postal 
Service inspectors and the U.S. attorney's office to investigate, Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators contacted Doigny in November, 1989, but he ignored their order to 
appear before them and went to Europe for a month. He returned in December, 
took his motor home and fled to Arizona. He was later arrested there and 
extradited to California, Walsh said.

<P>
WOODWORKER PUT HIS STAMP ON CITY

<P>
Artist Mogens Abel literally carved a name for himself in Laguna Beach, his 
home for 46 years. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Denmark who moved to Laguna Beach in 1937, Abel established a 
reputation as a woodcarver and was commissioned by the City Council to sculpt 
wooden welcome signs for all three entrances to the city. 
</P>
<P>
He also carved the sign on Laguna Canyon Road that welcomes thousands of 
visitors at the entrance to the city's Festival of Arts and Pageant of the 
Masters. 
</P>
<P>
"His wooden signs and carvings are all over this city," said Sally Reeve, 
public relations director of the pageant, who has an Abel woodcarving inset on 
the door of her office. 
</P>
<P>
Abel was remembered Friday at a private memorial service at Heisler Park in 
Laguna Beach. He died July 1 after suffering an aneurysm at his home in Leisure 
World. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
Abel was a fixture at the festival and pageant in several capacities. He 
exhibited his artwork for more than 30 years, served on its board of directors 
and then acted as grounds manager for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Abel also portrayed Judas in the pageant's traditional final act, "The Last 
Supper." 
</P>
<P>
"Mogens was the type of man we always thought would be here," Reeve said. "His 
brother told me he didn't have an enemy in the world, and I believe it." 
</P>
<P>
Abel's brother, Christian Abel, is an internationally known architect who lives 
and works in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Mogens Abel also is survived by his wife, Shirley, of Leisure World; two 
sisters, Bierte Abel of San Juan Capistrano and Jane Duree of Escondido; one 
daughter, Sharon Daly of Austin, Tex.; two stepdaughters, Susan Kish and Nadine 
Jones, both of Dana Point; one granddaughter and one step-granddaughter.LEN

EVACUATION FORCED BY CHEMICAL SPILL

<TEXT>
<P>
A chemical spill at a plating company on Monday forced the evacuation of about 
50 people working in the plant and other nearby businesses, fire officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 pounds of sodium hydrosulfite spilled at Platecorp, 1223 N. Batavia 
St., about 5:30 p.m., authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Hazardous material teams from Santa Ana and Anaheim assisted Orange 
firefighters in containing the spill that had the "potential to be highly toxic 
when mixed with water," Orange County fire dispatcher John Shope said. 
</P>
<P>
"People from the plant and adjacent businesses were evacuated as a precaution," 
Shope said. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured during the incident, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials closed North Batavia Street between Katella Avenue and Struck 
Avenue for several hours while fire crews mopped up the chemical. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Orange County Health Care and Environmental Management 
agencies and the Southern California Air Quality Management District were 
notified of the spill. MATT LAIT

ZONING PANEL REJECTS HIGHER-DENSITY PLAN

<P>
The Planning Commission on Monday unanimously rejected a developer's request to 
rezone a recently annexed parcel. 
</P>
<P>
The rezoning would have paved the way for the development of up to 25 
condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
When the 2.3-acre area at Holt and Warren avenues was annexed in 1989, some 
North Tustin residents opposed it, saying Tustin would rezone it to allow 
multifamily dwellings instead of the five houses that are there now. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty North Tustin residents spoke against the proposal Monday, saying the 
zoning change would hurt the open character of their neighborhood and increase 
traffic congestion and noise. "We asked the city of Tustin not to increase the 
density," said Stephen Johnson of Foothill Communities Assn. in a presentation 
that drew loud applause. 
</P>
<P>
The city planning staff recommended denial of the zoning change. Planning 
commissioners said the zoning change could hurt the city's credibility and 
future efforts to annex North Tustin properties. 
</P>
<P>
"The city gave its word. I do not believe it is appropriate at this time to 
make the change," Commissioner Alven Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
The zoning change was proposed by Dennis Paquette, who has said he would buy 
three parcels in the area to build condominiums.SHANNON SANDS

DISPUTE OVER TREES MAY GO TO COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of people living along and near historical Broadway, angry that no 
decision appears near to save several dozen trees threatened by proposed street 
improvements, vowed Monday to appeal to the City Council to resolve the long 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The group, Broadway and Area Residents, has rejected the city's three options 
for the neighborhood and instead offered a fourth proposal. 
</P>
<P>
They suggest saving all trees on the south side of Broadway and replacing trees 
lost on either the north or south sides with trees larger than those the city 
has offered. Members say they will appeal to the council if no acceptable 
agreement is reached this week. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be really surprised" if the city accepts the new proposal, said Michael 
Kowalski, spokesman for the group. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the city razed trees along several blocks -- some of them more than 
50 years old -- to make room for a nearly $1-million street improvement project 
that includes adding curbs and replacing sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
After outraged residents voiced their concern for the remaining trees, the 
project was put on hold until a solution could be reached. Despite several 
meetings, there still is no agreement in the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
"The three options given to us were not overwhelmingly accepted -- in fact, 
none of it was," said Sally White, a longtime Broadway resident and a member of 
the group. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Manager Arthur Daw, who has been meeting with group members, said 
he would listen to their latest offer, but could make no guarantees. "We'll 
certainly be open," he said. LISA MASCARO

7-YEAR-OLD TWISTS WAY TO AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hair is important, even to a 7-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
That's why Stefani Green created "Stefani's Curler Kit for Kids," an invention 
that earned the Rossmoor Elementary School pupil top statewide honors in the 
"1990 Invent America" competition. 
</P>
<P>
Stefani, who enters the second grade this fall, was selected as first-grade 
winner, beating out about 100,000 California entries. She received a $200 U.S. 
savings bond for her efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"She was the best first-grade entry that we got from the entire state," said 
Diane George, spokeswoman for Invent America, a national program launched in 
1987 by then-Vice President George Bush, who now serves as honorary chairman. 
"When you consider the 26,000 entries we got from the greater Los Angeles area 
alone, her achievement is all the more remarkable." 
</P>
<P>
The Invent America program is more than just a chance to compete and have fun. 
It is designed to get children to think creatively at an early age, George 
said. 
</P>
<P>
When Stefani's science teacher, Claudia Ross, announced last spring that the 
school would be holding an "invention convention" instead of the annual science 
fair, the blond-haired, brown-eyed youngster's mind began to race. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking about what I could invent, then I thought about how I like to 
curl my bangs but always burn my forehead," Stefani said. "That's when I got my 
idea." 
</P>
<P>
Stefani's invention is a fan-shaped device made of heat-resistant plastic that 
is fastened to the curling iron. The device prevents the hot parts of the 
curling iron from touching the forehead or neck -- two areas Stefani said are 
particularly at risk when curling hair. 
</P>
<P>
Like other entrants in the contest, Stefani built a model of the device from 
cardboard. 
</P>
<P>
Although her first journey into the territory of Thomas Edison and Alexander 
Graham Bell was a success, Stefani said she doesn't plan on doing much 
inventing in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"It was sort of aggravating and took a lot of concentration," she said. "It's 
exciting I guess, but what I really want to be is a dolphin trainer." GREG 
HERNANDEZ

PUBLIC'S HELP SOUGHT IN INFANT-DEATH CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police investigators, stymied in their efforts to identify a baby found dead in 
a garbage can last week, are turning to the public for help. 
</P>
<P>
Police need information from anyone who may have known or noticed a pregnant 
woman who was recently nearing delivery but is now without a newborn. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators have already checked one such tip but it proved false, said Lt. 
Phillip Satterfield, who is heading the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"A child is dead, and we don't have clue one right now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The body of the newborn girl was found in a garbage can about 6:15 a.m. last 
Friday by a groundskeeper at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, at the northern edge of 
Cypress. Police are still awaiting autopsy results, but early indications point 
to exposure as the cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information on the case should call the Cypress Police Department 
at (714) 229-6600.

TREES HAVE ROOTS IN PLACENTIA GRASS EATERS CULT

<P>
On the surface, its an unpretentious neighborhood. Nothing to write home about. 
It's mostly an area of tract homes, a few small apartment complexes and a 
private community thrown in for good measure. 
</P>
<P>
It's the kind of neighborhood where Norman Rockwell would have set up his 
canvas to capture towheaded boys charging down the streets on their bicycles, 
or a group of teen-age girls giggling and chatting as they walk home from 
school. It is an unaffected middle-class neighborhood where backboards sit 
precariously perched over garages, motor homes intermittently dot the streets 
and lawns are clipped weekly or biweekly by working families as time permits. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't always that way. The only telltale sign of secrets past stands 
inconspicuously on the neatly trimmed greenbelt of a private residential 
street. 
</P>
<P>
Sandwiched unceremoniously between the pool and tennis court are two macadamia 
nut trees documented by a bronze plaque embedded in a brick platform. They are 
the only living testimony of a bygone era and the existence of a colorful, 
mysterious cult known as the Placentia Grass Eaters. 
</P>
<P>
In 1837, Spain granted 35,790 acres to Juan Pacifico Ontiveros. Through a 
series of transactions, the property ended up in the hands of a real estate 
firm, the Robinson Trust. In 1872, the trust gave one of its agents, Col. J.K. 
Tuffree, 662 acres as a wedding present. 
</P>
<P>
Four years later, the colonel sold 24 acres of his land to George R. Hinde, the 
found of a religious colony which ate only raw vegetables and fruits on the 
theory that cooking destroys the spiritual essence of food, which they believed 
to be the clothing of the soul. 
</P>
<P>
Legend has it that Hinde, a transplanted New Yorker, promptly set about 
erecting a huge, $10,000, two-story mansion in which all the members of the 
colony cohabited, but did not commingle. Of particular interest to lookers-on 
was the hulking, round turret tower. Rumor had it that all the rooms in the 
mansion were round, because round rooms supposedly would ward off evil spirits 
lurking in corners. So when Dr. Louis Schlesinger arrived from England to 
become president of the colony, he began to conjure up those spirits regularly 
and engage the group in seances and other strange spiritualist rites. It was 
little wonder that while they called themselves Sociatas Fraterna, the 
surrounding community dubbed them the Placentia Grass Eaters, and referred to 
them as freaks, faddists and spooks. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever the townspeople thought of them in a religious context, they 
respected their green thumb and came from miles away to purchase their excess 
crops. In 1883, Walter (Thales) Lockwood, a former Shaker minister, took over 
both the cult and the property, and together with Hinde, began experimenting 
with grafting fruit and nut trees. It was Hinde who is credited with developing 
the Placentia perfection walnut, and the Hinde and Thales loquat also thrived 
in the sect's orchards. 
</P>
<P>
Those two famous macadamias, which stand as a historical landmark, were the 
first such trees brought to California (circa 1884 by Hinde), along with litchi 
nut trees, so the colony could sell its produce to the Chinese community 
working in nearby celery fields and on the Pacific Railroad line. 
</P>
<P>
Irrespective of the cult's historical savvy, the villagers still sensed there 
were strange goings-on within the cloistered community. And when a child in the 
colony died, chaos ensued. 
</P>
<P>
A lawsuit was filed claiming the child had died of starvation, and rumors ran 
rampant that the cult surreptitiously buried its deceased members in unmarked 
graves by wrapping the body in a sheet, lowering it into a hole, dumping 100 
pounds of quicklime over it along with some water and topping it off with fill 
dirt. A second suit was filed when the society not only failed to officially 
report births and deaths locally, but also refused to furnish pertinent 
information to federal census-takers. 
</P>
<P>
In the final analysis, though, the townspeople could have simply sat back and 
let cultural evolution run its course. After all, a cult that doesn't commingle 
will eventually cease to mingle at all. When Thales died in 1921, the property 
was deeded to a woman who ran the colony with her son. However, the cult didn't 
prosper during the 1920's, and S. James Tuffree, an heir of the colonel's, 
bought the property back and demolished every one of the society's buildings in 
1933. Alas, in doing so, he wiped out virtually every trace, memory or remnant 
of the Placentia Grass Eaters. 
</P>
<P>
But life goes on. Today the neighborhood is a docile setting full of Kodak 
moments and Rockwellian images. But few would have ever known the folklore of 
the venturous vegetarians were it not for two macadamia nut trees swaying 
nonchalantly in the gentle Placentia breezes -- as if nothing has ever 
happened.

EL TORO AIR BASE ON COUNCIL AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM McQUEENEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council tonight will consider writing letters to the U.S. Defense 
Department and congressional delegates to oppose any civilian use of the El 
Toro Marine Corps Air Station, where federal inspectors are due Wednesday to 
explore that idea. 
</P>
<P>
The letters, proposed by outgoing Mayor Larry Agran, were prompted by the 
scheduled visit by representatives of the General Accounting Office to the El 
Toro base. The GAO will evaluate the base for possible joint military-civilian 
use at the request of U.S. Sen. Wendell Ford (D-Ky.). 
</P>
<P>
Possible civilian use of El Toro has been discussed for several years and has 
been strongly backed by Federal Express and other air cargo companies that want 
to base overnight package delivery operations there. 
</P>
<P>
But opening the airfield to civilian flights is unlikely, Agran said, because a 
law introduced last year by Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) prohibits 
commercial use and because the military opposes the idea. But he wants the 
outgoing council to go on record in opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's meeting will probably be the last for Agran and council allies 
Cameron Cosgrove and Edward A. Dornan. Agran and Cosgrove lost their June 5 
reelection bids and Dornan did not run for another term. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to make sure we got our views on the public record," Agran said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to writing letters to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and the Orange 
County congressional delegation regarding El Toro, Agran proposed that the 
council write a separate letter to Cheney asking him to stop helicopter 
operations at the Tustin Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
Although the first letter is mostly symbolic, Agran said, ridding the Tustin 
base of its helicopters and ultimately closing the base has a better chance of 
succeeding. 
</P>
<P>
"As world conditions are improving and base closings are being undertaken as 
part of a program of Pentagon cutbacks, we ought to capitalize on this new 
reality and express our eagerness to see this particular base closed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine estimates that 1,980 helicopter flights pass over the city each month. 
The helicopters jeopardize the safety of Irvine residents every day, Agran 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Marine Corps officials have stressed that helicopter flights at Tustin have 
hurt no civilians in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, as the open space disappears around the Tustin base, the threat to 
residents increases, Agran said. 
</P>
<P>
The Marine Corps uses several air routes to helicopter training fields outside 
the city. Most of the noise complaints come from residents of Woodbridge and 
other neighborhoods underneath a flight path linking the Tustin base with the 
ocean. TOM McQUEENEY

FRUSTACIS TO SETTLE FERTILITY-TREATMENT SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Against the wishes of a doctor accused of malpractice, Patti Frustaci, a 
Riverside woman who gave birth to the nation's first septuplets in 1985, and 
her husband, Sam, have agreed to settle their suit against the infertility 
clinic that treated her, representatives for both sides said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the settlement will not be revealed until it is made final and 
recorded in Santa Monica Superior Court today. 
</P>
<P>
The Frustacis, whose babies were born at St. Joseph Hospital in Orange, allege 
that infertility specialist Dr. Jaroslav Marik did not properly monitor a 
powerful fertility drug, leading to physical and developmental impairment of 
the septuplets. Only three survive. 
</P>
<P>
Marik denies the allegations and has strenuously objected to any settlement 
discussions, which went on without his consent, an unusual occurrence in 
malpractice cases. 
</P>
<P>
Browne Greene, the Frustacis' attorney, said Marik will be dismissed as a 
defendant, the only way Tyler Medical Clinic could settle the case.

AIRPORT COMMISSION OKS TAKEOVER OF FIRM;

<P>
CONTROVERSY: DESPITE SMALL-AIRCRAFT OWNERS' FEARS OF A FUEL MONOPOLY AT JOHN 
WAYNE AIRPORT, WILLIAM LYON'S MARTIN AVIATION WILL BE ALLOWED TO ACQUIRE 
MILLION AIR.

<TEXT>
<P>
Representatives of several hundred small-airplane owners on Monday evening took 
their arguments against what they fear would be an aircraft-fuel monopoly at 
John Wayne Airport to the Orange County Airport Commission, but were shot down 
on a 5-0 vote. 
</P>
<P>
"General aviation is in decay at John Wayne Airport," said Michael Church, 
owner of Sunrise Aviation, a flight school based at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Airport Commission at its meeting in Santa Ana, Church added: 
"This is now perceived to be an air-carrier airport. . . . We're on our way 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Church, who is also president of the Orange County Airport Assn., a private 
pilots group, urged the commissioners to "recognize how much you owe general 
aviation your protection." 
</P>
<P>
Don Miller, the association's vice president, said that the organization was 
not opposed to one firm taking over another at the airport but that 
commissioners should realize that none of the flight schools can operate 
"unless they can get fuel and get it right now." 
</P>
<P>
The debate was the result of several recent changes affecting aircraft service 
firms based at John Wayne, which is home to about 900 privately owned planes 
ranging from piston-engine Cessnas to big Gulfstream corporate jets. 
</P>
<P>
First, Tallmantz Aviation, one of the airport's three providers of 
general-aviation fuel, has been in financial difficulty, with the county 
attempting to evict the firm for non-payment of rent. 
</P>
<P>
Second, developer-aviator William Lyon and partners have purchased Martin 
Aviation, and Lyon proposes to take over the airport land lease and assets held 
by Pel-Aire Partners, which is known publicly as Million Air. Martin and 
Million Air are the only other providers of general-aviation fuel at the 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
Airport commissioners were provided with a study, financed by Martin Aviation 
and conducted by the Peat Marwick accounting firm, that purports to show no 
correlation between the number of fuel providers at an airport and the price 
per gallon. 
</P>
<P>
The study surveyed 56 fuel providers at 22 different airports. 
</P>
<P>
"The survey demonstrates that Martin Aviation's acquisition of Million Air's 
assets should have no adverse impact on fuel prices," David Banmiller, chairman 
of Martin's board, wrote to the commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
About 59% of all airports offering low-lead aviation fuel have only one or two 
suppliers, according to the Peat Marwick report. 
</P>
<P>
Airport officials said that if Tallmantz Aviation is successfully evicted, its 
fueling business will be taken over by a new airport business operator, so that 
fuel would continue to be provided by a second source. 
</P>
<P>
Panel members decided during the meeting that it was better to have Martin 
Aviation assume control of Million Air than to let Million Air, which has been 
losing money, stop operating altogether. 
</P>
<P>
In other action, the Airport Commission approved a plan to allow a second 
airport contractor to finish work on a new garage and elevated roadway, a job 
that Taylor Woodrow California Construction Ltd. was fired from in May. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, proposed by the airport staff, the Irvine-based McCarthy 
Brothers firm will complete the work at a price not to exceed $1.634 million, 
four times the amount for which Taylor Woodrow has offered to do it.

THE SPECTACLE FAR OUTSHINED WORLD CUP'S STYLE OF SOCCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

ROME 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bread and circuses. That's what the Roman patricians used to rely on to keep 
the plebeian masses in order. 
</P>
<P>
Things haven't changed much in 2,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
The bread is still bread, but the circus is now called calcio, or soccer. 
Italians have taken to the sport like no other people on earth. It has become 
part of the fabric of society, as vital a component as its literature, art and 
music, its fine food and even finer wine. 
</P>
<P>
For the past month, Italy has lived and breathed soccer, following the World 
Cup with a passion bordering on obsession. The 52 matches that ended with West 
Germany's 1-0 victory over Argentina Sunday night have dominated newspaper 
columns and radio and television programs from one end of the Italian boot to 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
Now it is over. 
</P>
<P>
What will the world make of Italia '90? What is the verdict on this World Cup 
as compared to the previous 13 dating to 1930? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it is too early to render a judgment. A lot will depend on whether the 
lessons of the tournament have been learned. 
</P>
<P>
If soccer's powers-that-be, namely the Federation International of Football 
Association, can find a way to increase the goal-scoring; if the cynical, 
don't-lose-at-any-cost approach can be driven out of the game; if the 
tournament can be restructured in such a way as to take up less time and 
provide more entertainment, then, maybe, Italia '90 will have been a success. 
</P>
<P>
Its value will have been in pointing the way to a better World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 tournament did not produce any great matches or even any soccer of a 
memorable quality. Apart from rare flashes of brilliance by a Dragan Stojkovic 
here or a Giuseppe Giannini there, it seldom lived up to its billing. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, it was an unqualified financial success; yes, organizationally everything 
worked reasonably smoothly; yes, the stadiums were magnificent; yes, the 
atmosphere was tremendous, especially while Italy was still in the running. 
</P>
<P>
But no, the World Cup as a whole was not perfect. Instead, it was rather like 
an average play being performed in a sumptuous setting. The scenery was 
tremendous, the acting, for the most part, mediocre. 
</P>
<P>
Final figures showed that a record 2,515,168 tickets were sold to the games. 
But even that figure is deceptive. Many were sold in blocks to tour operators 
overseas or to national soccer associations. When these were unable to resell 
the tickets, it meant that a stadium could be 97% "sold out" but only half to 
three-quarters full. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole system and strategy of ticket sales by FIFA must be fundamentally 
revised," Luca di Montezemolo, head of the Italian World Cup Organizing 
Committee, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The soccer statistics, too, were bleak. The tournament produced only 115 goals, 
the fewest since the World Cup was expanded to 24 teams in 1982 and the lowest 
average -- 2.2 goals -- in World Cup history. 
</P>
<P>
Various reasons have been given, ranging from the packed midfields and defenses 
that make it all but impossible to score, to the theory that today's strikers 
simply are not as good as those of yesteryear. 
</P>
<P>
"Defensive systems are getting stronger," FIFA spokesman Guido Tognoni said. 
"Teams are working like computers on defense. Mistakes produce goals, and we 
have seen teams making very few mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Paolo Rossi, who led Italy to its 1982 World Cup victory in 
Spain, believes that it is the strikers who are to blame. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no great forwards anymore, like there were three or four years ago," 
he said. "I don't particularly like the phase of football we are going through. 
It's all too defensive, too kick and rush. It has got to change." 
</P>
<P>
To its credit, FIFA is at least making an attempt. During the World Cup, it was 
announced that the offside rule will be changed starting with the coming 
season, so that a forward will not be offside if he is in line with the last 
defender -- not including the goalkeeper, naturally -- when the ball is passed. 
Previously, the attacking player had to have two defensive players between him 
and the goal at the time of the pass. 
</P>
<P>
It is a small step, but one in the right direction. Other changes, too, might 
be needed, mostly in the attitude of the coaches toward the sport. So much 
money is involved now -- for example, Italian midfielder Roberto Baggio was 
sold by Fiorentina of Florence to Juventus of Turin for a world-record $13 
million this year -- that coaches and players are afraid of losing rather than 
being motivated to win. 
</P>
<P>
The result is defensive soccer, with fewer goals and less entertainment. 
Admittedly, a 0-0 match can be as enthralling as a 3-2 game, but only if it is 
played in the correct spirit. With the exception of Cameroon, that spirit was 
missing from Italia '90. 
</P>
<P>
FIFA's upper echelons are slowly coming to recognize this, and there were 
encouraging words during the tournament that changes might be made before the 
World Cup comes to the United States in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Deploring what he termed a return to the "old European safety-first football," 
Joseph (Sepp) Blatter, FIFA's secretary-general and the second-most powerful 
figure in world soccer behind Joao Havelange, the organization's president, 
suggested some extensive rethinking. 
</P>
<P>
The monthlong, 24-team tournament is too long, Blatter said, adding that he 
would prefer to see the field reduced to 16, its original number. Political 
considerations make this unlikely, however, especially with Havelange having 
promised Africa a third spot among the 24 in 1994. Another idea might be to 
increase the field to 32 and make it an elimination tournament from the start. 
</P>
<P>
Soccer is a very tradition-bound sport, however, and radical change is 
unlikely. Some observers were appalled to learn that the U.S.A. '94 Organizing 
Committee has obtained permission from FIFA to play in domed stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
Another suggestion bearing some merit was made by French Coach Michel Platini, 
who said the World Cup should be played in the fall when the players are fresh 
and the weather is cooler, rather than in summer when the players are coming 
off a long season. Argentina's Diego Maradona said he supports the idea. 
</P>
<P>
But these are ideas for the future. There still is time to savor the 
all-too-few highlights from the 1990 tournament. Here, then, is a sampling of 
snapshots from the World Cup album: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The kaleidoscope of color at the opening ceremony in Milan June 8, as fans 
from all nations gathered to celebrate the sport they love in an atmosphere of 
tremendous good will. What a pity it did not last. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The planeloads of Irish fans, faces painted green, white and orange, 
singing their heads off in Genoa as Ireland, playing in its first World Cup, 
made it to the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The astonishing caldron that is Rome's Olympic Stadium, filled to 
overflowing with Italian fans, each with a more piercing whistle than the next; 
a forest of flags, and the chant of 73,000 voices. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Salvatore Schillaci, the tournament's leading scorer with six goals, 
swerving away from the net, wide-eyed, arms outstretched, mouth agape, 
celebrating another score for Italy like a kid in a pickup game. Soccer is 
still a joy for the man Italians know simply as Toto. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Roger Milla, Cameroon's 38-year-old wonder, doing a hip-swaying dance at 
the corner flag after taking his country into the quarterfinals, the furthest 
any African country had ever gone in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 -- United States fans in Florence entering the spirit of the sport with a 
rousing, flag-waving welcome for the U.S. team when it arrives to play its 
first World Cup match in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A battered van parked near the train station in Bologna, proudly flying a 
large Romanian flag while its occupants, a young couple, play the guitar to 
earn a few lire. Often, their only audience is the mongrel dog that traveled 
with them. Hundreds of Romanians applied for asylum while in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Joyous West German players kissing the gold World Cup trophy during the 
award ceremony Sunday night, surrounded by toga-clad young women in white with 
ludicrous headdresses representing the Forum, the Colosseum, the Circus Maximus 
and other Roman landmarks. The more things change . . . 
</P>
<P>
 -- Maradona keeping Argentine President Carlos Menem and a roomful of 
reporters waiting for half an hour and then accepting a passport from Menem 
naming him "ambassador for sport." The same Maradona, in tears after the loss 
to West Germany, accepting the second-place medal. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Scott LeTellier, head of the U.S. World Cup Organizing Committee, 
delivering an excellent, off-the-cuff address to a hostile audience in Rome, 
explaining why the 1994 World Cup will be a success despite the loudly 
expressed doubts of many. 
</P>
<P>
 -- High-rise apartment buildings across the length and breadth of Italy with 
an Italian flag flying amid the laundry from almost every balcony or window. 
</P>
<P>
 -- English hooligans turning red in the sun in Bologna under the watchful eye 
of enough heavily armed security personnel to dissuade them from misbehavior. 
Fortunately, apart from some incidents with the English in Rimini and Cagliari 
and with the Germans in Milan, the World Cup was relatively free of serious 
hooligan trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ciao, the red, white and green stick figure that served as the World Cup 
mascot, on everything, everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the one image that matters most is missing -- that of a 
brilliant save or a marvelous goal or a sparkling run. 
</P>
<P>
The missing piece in the 1990 World Cup jigsaw puzzle was the soccer itself.

Steve Bauer of Canada retained his lead in the Tour de France Monday, but the 
first of the mountain stages on a warm day bothered him. 
</P>
<P>
"The heat was a problem," said Bauer, who holds a 17-second lead over Ronan 
Pensec of France after nine stages. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not expect such a hard stage. I hope it will be cooler up in the 
mountains. 
</P>
<P>
"To keep the yellow jersey more than one week, it's probably the best of my 
career. But it's a stress. In the race you have to watch out for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Italy's Massimo Ghirotto won the ninth stage, a 122-mile stretch from Besancon 
to Geneva, breaking away with Spain's Eduardo Chozas in the first of the 
mountain passes. They were timed in 4 hours 46 minutes 7 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Bauer has held the top position in the overall standings since the first stage 
a week ago Sunday.

Defending champion Greg LeMond is sixth, 10:09 behind.

NEWSWIRE: DON KING'S POST-FIGHT COMMENTS HEARD AT TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An audiotape of boxing promoter Don King's comments after Buster Douglas 
knocked out Mike Tyson to win the heavyweight championship was played during 
the trial of King's breach-of-contract suit against Douglas Monday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"All I'm looking for is justice and fair play -- for one side or another," King 
said on Feb. 11 in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a grave injustice here. It's an injustice if it holds that Mike Tyson 
was knocked out." 
</P>
<P>
King is scheduled to testify today. 
</P>
<P>
King is suing Douglas and his manager, John Johnson, for allegedly breaching 
King's promotional contract by signing a contract with the Mirage hotel in Las 
Vegas for a bout against Evander Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Sulaiman, president of the World Boxing Council, who was called as a 
witness for King, testified that King did not ask him to stop the fight after 
Douglas was knocked down in the eighth round. Douglas was apparently down for 
13 seconds because the referee failed to pick up the count of the timekeeper 
and instead started his own count.

SANDBERG IS RIGHT AT HOME, HITS 3 AS NL WINS HOME RUN CONTEST, 4-1

"Well," Ryne Sandberg said with something of a straight face, "I was definitely 
looking to hit a home run in that situation." 
</P>
<P>
That was the name of the game Monday as Sandberg, the Chicago Cubs' second 
baseman, lifted the National League to a 4-1 victory over the American League 
in the home run hitting contest that featured the workout day activities 
preceding tonight's All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
Sandberg, who hit 30 home runs last season and leads the National League with 
24 this year, was the last batter with the score tied, 1-1, and delivered three 
home runs to the delight of a capacity crowd at Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a good swing right now, and I've learned to look for a pitch I can 
drive in certain situations, but I don't fit in with guys like (Jose) Canseco 
and (Cecil) Fielder as far as power (goes)," Sandberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe not, but Fielder and Canseco were unable to hit homers for the AL, and 
Darryl Strawberry and Bobby Bonilla could not connect for the NL. 
</P>
<P>
Only Matt Williams of the San Francisco Giants and Mark McGwire of the Oakland 
Athletics hit home runs before Sandberg, who later smiled and said, "The home 
run is the biggest thrill in baseball for me." ROSS NEWHAN

TOP MONEY-MAKERS BOTTOM OUT IN 1ST HALF; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: EIGHT OF THE MAJOR LEAGUES' 10-BIGGEST CONTRACTS BELONG TO PLAYERS 
WHO DIDN'T MAKE 1990 ALL-STAR TEAM.

<P>
The big money takes a break at All-Star time. At least this year. 
</P>
<P>
Eight of baseball's 10 biggest contracts belong to players who didn't make the 
1990 All-Star team, including Don Mattingly and three pitchers who threw 
no-hitters this season -- Dave Stewart, Nolan Ryan and Mark Langston (with an 
assist from Mike Witt). 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the only two Big Ten players who made it to Chicago for tonight's game 
were Oakland's Jose Canseco, baseball's biggest earner at $4.7 million a year, 
and San Francisco's Will Clark, who pulls down a more modest $3.75 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it a question of whether I'm an All-Star or not?" asked Stewart, who has 
won 20 games in each of the last three seasons for Oakland. "I'm not on the 
team, but that doesn't mean that I'm not deserving. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Stewart is, in fact, deserving enough to have negotiated a two-year contract 
last year that will begin paying him $3.5 million a year in 1991. At 11-7, he 
probably was deserving enough to be on the All-Star team this year too. 
</P>
<P>
But Stewart's own Tony La Russa, AL manager by virtue of the A's World Series 
victory last year, said he discussed the situation with Stewart, and the 
decision was mutual. La Russa already had two Oakland pitchers on the staff -- 
Dennis Eckersley and Bob Welch -- and Stewart wanted to make his regular start 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, who will make $3.3 million next year, goes into the All-Star break at 8-4 
with a 3.79 ERA and 116 strikeouts after leading the majors with 301 strikeouts 
last year. La Russa, however, assumed Ryan would like the break to rest an 
ailing back. 
</P>
<P>
Langston, whose five-year contract averages $3.2 million, has a lower ERA than 
Ryan, 3.71, but a 4-9 record. His pain has been a little lower this year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not as if I'm going out there and getting beat up," Langston said. At one 
point this spring, he lost four consecutive decisions, giving up two runs in 
each. Shouldn't that be good enough to win? "In some instances it is," Langston 
said. "For me, it hasn't been." 
</P>
<P>
The other Big Ten pitcher, Kansas City's Mark Davis, can barely make a case for 
staying in the major leagues after winning the Cy Young last year with 44 saves 
and a 1.85 ERA for San Diego. With a $3.25 million contract at Kansas City this 
year, he has five saves and a 5.66 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals are so desperately seeking solutions that they gave Davis his first 
start in three years Sunday, to no avail. He gave up four runs in 3 1/3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
Mattingly and Robin Yount are having years so ugly they would make Quasimodo 
shudder. 
</P>
<P>
Mattingly's problem, too, has been in his back. Earning $3.86 million a year 
from the Yankees, he's batting .253 with five homers and 33 RBIs -- his worst 
start ever. He hasn't homered since May 20. Last year, Mattingly earned the big 
contract with a .303 average, 23 homers and 113 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Yount, who makes $3.2 million a year, had one of the worst slumps of his career 
this year and, after hitting .318 with 21 homers and 103 RBIs in 1989, just 
can't get over the hump in '90. He's hitting .239 with seven homers and 36 RBIs 
at the halfway point this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I may end up with a few more toys," Yount said when he became baseball's first 
$3 million man. "But other than that, I don't think it will have any effect." 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati's Eric Davis and San Diego's Joe Carter have the ninth- and 
10th-biggest contracts at $3.1 million and $3,066,667 per year, and neither is 
on the All-Star team. 
</P>
<P>
Davis is hitting .233 with 11 homers and 35 RBIs, although he missed nearly a 
month with a sprained right knee. But Davis also missed time because of 
injuries last year and wound up with 101 RBIs and 34 homers in 462 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Carter had 105 RBIs and 35 homers with a .243 average for Cleveland last year 
before being traded to San Diego in the deal that sent Sandy Alomar Jr. to the 
Indians. This season, he has 13 homers and 59 RBIs but is hitting .220. 
</P>
<P>
For some of the guys whose teams are struggling -- such as Carter, Mark Davis, 
Yount and Mattingly -- the No-Star break is a welcome change of pace. Three 
blissful days without baseball, without the pressure of questions such as: What 
did you do to earn your pay today? 
</P>
<P>
"We need not to think about all that stuff during the break," Mattingly said. 
"We need to get away from this for a few days. We need to make a fresh start."

PUTTING UP THEIR DUKES FOR UCI BENEFIT;

<P>
TEAM TENNIS: NEWPORT BEACH DUKES MAKE THEIR DEBUT TONIGHT AGAINST AN ANTEATER 
ALUMNI TEAM AT JOHN WAYNE TENNIS CLUB.

Team Tennis returns to Orange County for the first time in seven years tonight, 
but it's just for practice. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Beach Dukes debut with an exhibition match against a UC Irvine 
alumni team at 7 p.m. at John Wayne Tennis Club. 
</P>
<P>
The UCI alumni team features former All-American Mike Briggs and Bruce Man Song 
Hing. All-American Trevor Kronemann was originally scheduled to play but was a 
late selection of the Charlotte Heat. 
</P>
<P>
The Dukes' season begins for real against the Raleigh Edge, another new 
franchise, Thursday at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Dukes will play 13 additional matches -- six at home, seven on the road -- 
before the regular season ends Aug. 5. If they avoid last place in the 
four-team West Division, the Dukes will qualify for the Team Tennis playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The real task for the Dukes, however, may be survival. 
</P>
<P>
Two other county-based Team Tennis franchises folded quickly -- the Anaheim 
Oranges in 1978 and the California Oranges in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Neither was successful, financially or otherwise. The Anaheim Oranges lasted 
just one season. The California Oranges lasted just three, and their best 
record was 8-5 in 1983. Their final match, a 30-27 victory over the Dallas 
Stars, drew only 636 to the Newport Beach Tennis Club on July 29, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The Dukes begin their first season with high expectations, on the court and at 
the box office. 
</P>
<P>
Marty Davis, a former Davis Cup player; Roger Smith, the top-ranked player in 
the Bahamas; Sophie Amiach, who played with league runner-up Sacramento last 
season, and 17-year-old Amy Frazier make up the Dukes' roster. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Patton, men's tennis coach at UCI for 11 seasons, will serve as their 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be a new experience for me," Patton said. "I want to have a 
dialogue with the men. Mostly, I'll be working with the women and the doubles. 
I'll treat them like they've been through it all before." 
</P>
<P>
Ticket sales have been brisk, particularly for tonight's exhibition, a benefit 
for UCI's athletic department. But even Fred Lieberman, the Dukes' 
owner/promoter, said he isn't sure how many people will want to watch Team 
Tennis.

IN SPORT OF TEAM HANDBALL, THERE'S A TEAM . . . BUT NO HANDBALL; 
</P>
<P>
OLYMPIC FESTIVAL: OBSCURITY OF SPORT IN UNITED STATES ALLOWS INEXPERIENCED LISA 
BASSI TO TEAM WITH VETERAN RHONDA WEYER ON WEST TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It is one of Europe's favorite team games. In most countries, it is second in 
popularity only to soccer. European boys and girls play this contact sport 
daily in the schools. Yet, in the United States, team handball is virtually 
nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, that is good news for Fullerton College softball Coach Lisa Bassi. 
Team handball's obscurity here has helped Bassi, 28, make the U.S. Olympic 
Sports Festival West team -- despite having virtually no experience playing the 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
She joins the West's most experienced veteran, Rhonda Weyer, 27, a Katella High 
School softball coach who has played the sport for six years. 
</P>
<P>
Team handball competition begins Wednesday in Minneapolis, with the gold-medal 
game Sunday. Until then, the North, South, East and West teams will practice 
and scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
The scrimmaging is a must, especially for Bassi, who has been playing the sport 
only since April when she went to the Sports Festival tryouts in Calabasas, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she is going to pick up the game very quickly because she is used to 
playing ball and she wants to learn," said Henriette Hansen, the West's coach. 
"She is like, 'Can we play? Can we play?' She can't get enough, and that is 
very important when you are not young anymore and you want to learn a new 
sport." 
</P>
<P>
Practice time was limited before the West squad headed to Minneapolis. "We have 
had one practice as a team before coming out here," Bassi said. "The coach 
said, 'What position do you play?' and I laughed. That's exactly what I did. I 
said, 'Whatever you want to me to play.' " 
</P>
<P>
Team handball is nothing like handball, where two people use their hands to hit 
a racquetball-sized sphere against a wall. 
</P>
<P>
"It is incredibly physical," said Bassi, who lives in Huntington Beach. "They 
say it is water polo without the water, soccer without the kicking and hockey 
without the sticks. So you can imagine the aggressiveness of the sport." 
</P>
<P>
Don't think that a beginner such as Bassi made the team just because there are 
so few experienced handball players in the country. Though she is a novice, her 
athletic credentials are impeccable. 
</P>
<P>
She played on Sports Festival softball teams for five years. She played club 
volleyball, and basketball and softball during her high school years at 
Chaffey. She attended Cal Poly Pomona, where she competed in softball and 
cross-country. 
</P>
<P>
Bassi has the kind of background that coaches look for in a team handball 
player. 
</P>
<P>
"They are looking for people who have athletic ability, period, which is unlike 
all the other sports because the athletes are highly trained specifically for 
their sport," Bassi said. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen, who lives in Newport Beach, got the job as West coach only a month ago 
after the original coach accepted an offer to play professional basketball in 
Japan. Hansen is a native of Denmark, the origin of team handball. 
</P>
<P>
"I always say that if you are a good basketball player but not good enough to 
make it on a big league team, then team handball is a good thing because you 
have a (better) chance to be on the national team," Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
Bassi dreamed of playing basketball, her first love, in the Olympics, but her 
5-5 height made that difficult. The contact in team handball never intimidated 
her; in fact, she requested to play one of the more physical positions -- 
circle runner. 
</P>
<P>
The circle runner sets picks against defenders along a half circle that 
protects a net or goal. The picks are designed to free teammates for shots. 
"You have to be strong to play the circle because you are fighting with the 
defensive players," Hansen said. "You are the only one who is in contact with 
them all the time. You can't be scared of hurting your knees, because the team 
you're going to play against is going to throw you around." 
</P>
<P>
Bassi has no such fear. "I don't think I enjoy abuse, but I enjoy contact," she 
said. "I was raised with my older brother. He was very athletic and liked to 
roughhouse, and I was his little brother, so to speak. I just developed that 
aggressive behavior along the way." 
</P>
<P>
It comes in handy for team handball, but players who get too physical are 
penalized by temporarily being removed from play. 
</P>
<P>
Team handball is most often played on a wooden surface a bit wider and longer 
than a basketball court. As in basketball, one can dribble and pass. 
</P>
<P>
At either end of the court is a goal about 10 feet wide and 6 feet tall, 
protected by a goalie. Six court players attempt to throw a volleyball-sized 
ball past the goalie to score a single point in the course of two 30-minute 
halves. There are no timeouts. 
</P>
<P>
The goal is surrounded by a half-circle, where most of the action takes place. 
Defensive players line up along it. 
</P>
<P>
"The half-circle represents the goalie area," Weyer explained. "Nobody is 
allowed in that area except the goalie, unless you're going to shoot. That is 
where the diving comes in. You must shoot the ball before you hit the floor in 
the circle area." 
</P>
<P>
Diving is Weyer's specialty. She earned a reputation as a flopper during her 
basketball days at Cal State Fullerton from 1981-85, when she hit the hardwood 
as regularly as a dust mop. 
</P>
<P>
She became involved with team handball after college. She played for the West 
basketball team at the 1981 Sports Festival. She first saw team handball at Cal 
State Fullerton, where there was a club team. She also worked as a supervisor 
for the 1984 Olympics at the team handball venue at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The contact in the game didn't intimidate her, she said. "It is a much quicker 
game than basketball. It was something different. I had never seen it before 
and it was an eye-catcher for me . . . being able to make shots against a 
goalie, diving and the different passes, the finesse of the games. It was like 
watching the Lakers and Magic Johnson with all these fantastic passes and 
shots." 
</P>
<P>
Weyer was hooked. She has been on the national team for the past 2 1/2 years 
and played for the West in the 1985, '86, '87 and '89 Sports Festivals, which 
are held in non-Olympic years. 
</P>
<P>
She trained with the national team at Marquette, Mich., and at the Olympic 
Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colo., for almost two years. She missed an 
opportunity to play in the 1988 Olympics after spraining her right thumb in the 
summer of 1987 and had to have her hand placed in a cast. The cast came off six 
weeks later, but in the interim, there had been a coaching change and Weyer 
said she was lost in the shuffle. 
</P>
<P>
Weyer decided to return to Cal State Fullerton for her final year and her 
degree. 
</P>
<P>
Weyer plays one of the primary shooting positions. "Her strength is that she 
makes only a few errors in the game, she knows what she is doing and she is 
strong," Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
Weyer is weighing whether she will try again to make the Olympic team, that is 
if the United States qualifies for Olympic competition in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"They have asked me back to Colorado Springs quite a few times, but I have been 
committed to other things, like coaching softball at Katella, and I would like 
to get my teacher's credential," Weyer said. "I possibly might. It is something 
I need to think about a little bit more." 
</P>
<P>
Bassi, on the other hand, knows her niche is at Fullerton College, where she 
teaches physical education and coaches the softball team. 
</P>
<P>
"My motivation for playing team handball is really twofold," Bassi said. "What 
I would like to do, obviously, is compete. And No. 2, what I would like to do 
is teach a class, develop a team handball class for Fullerton College and teach 
and promote the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"We really need to get developmental programs going at the high school level to 
make this a sport to stay in America."

ANAHEIM FIRM TO START COPY SHOP CHAIN IN EUROPE

Kaiser International Inc., the master franchiser of American Speedy Printing 
Centers in California, announced Monday that it has purchased European 
franchising rights from the Michigan quick-printing company and will invest at 
least $6 million to start a chain of copy shops in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The European deal is part of Kaiser's aggressive overseas expansion strategy. 
Two months ago, the Anaheim-based firm signed a 50-year joint venture pact with 
Canon Sales Inc. and Mauzen Co. Ltd. of Japan to establish about 900 quick 
printers in that country. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser also said Monday that it is negotiating an agreement with an Indian 
conglomerate to establish pilot printing stores in Bombay and New Delhi by the 
end of the year. William Culp, Kaiser president, added that the company is 
negotiating a similar pact to open stores in Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
Culp said that Kaiser, through its new Speedy International Europe unit, will 
open European headquarters in Frankfurt in January and "will begin searching 
for joint venture partners in Eastern and Western Europe." He expects that 70% 
of the European centers will be in Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
He said the company plans to open pilot stores in Germany and France by the end 
of 1991. The European deal comes after a successful two-year test of 18 pilot 
stores in the United Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 800 Speedy print shops in the United States, with most in the 
Midwest, the East and California. There are 116 Speedy stores in this state, 
Culp said. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser sees much opportunity to expand printing services in Europe with the 
economic unification planned for Western Europe and the shifts to market 
economies in Eastern Europe, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the Eastern European nations, Kaiser believes that Hungary offers the best 
opportunity for franchise operations because it has a relatively advanced 
economy and printing industry, said Stephan Metz, sales development vice 
president for Kaiser and president of Speedy International Europe.

POWERS DESIGN COMPLETES ITS WORK ON SPACE STATION MODULES

<P>
On a quiet street in West Newport on Monday, two huge white capsules lay on 
their sides like something from a science fiction movie. 
</P>
<P>
The two modules, 43 feet long and more than 14 feet wide, are full-size 
mock-ups of the living quarters and scientific laboratory for the manned space 
station Freedom, which NASA hopes to have operational by the year 1999. 
</P>
<P>
The space station mock-ups were designed and built by Powers Design 
International, 828 Production Place, for McDonnell Douglas, one of four 
companies that have been awarded work packages for the space station. The other 
companies -- Boeing Aerospace, Rocketdyne and General Electric -- will be 
building similar mock-ups of various parts of the space station to be used in 
their design and manufacturing work. 
</P>
<P>
The $16-billion space station would orbit Earth at 1,700 m.p.h., more than 100 
miles up. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, as the final touches were being put on the structures in a parking 
lot at Powers Design, company President Robert Powers said his small team of 
designers, along with engineers from McDonnell Douglas, has been working 12- 
and 14-hour days, seven days a week, to meet the contract deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Lining the inner walls of the capsules are stenciled patterns of computer 
screens and drawers, soon to be covered with yellow stick-up notes from 
engineers and designers with ideas for the real modules. Every inch of space 
around the walls, ceiling and floors will be used for hatches and compartments 
for the eight people who will inhabit the station. 
</P>
<P>
The modules were to be loaded onto trucks Monday evening and taken to McDonnell 
Douglas' Huntington Beach facility, where they will be reviewed by McDonnell 
Douglas and NASA engineers, and where the public will have an opportunity to 
walk through them. The mock-ups are used by engineers who determine how the 
computer, power and operational systems should be arranged for the space 
station. 
</P>
<P>
The final modules, which will be just long enough to fit inside the cargo bay 
of the space shuttle, will weigh nearly 70,000 pounds each, and will be 
assembled in space. 
</P>
<P>
The first pieces for assembly of the space station are due to be launched in 
1995. The station will be used to determine the long-term effects of living 
with zero gravity.

A court-appointed referee will conduct a hearing Sept. 25 in Detroit to decide 
how interest owed to heiress Joan Irvine Smith and her mother for their 
$149-million stake in the Irvine Co. should be calculated. 
</P>
<P>
Referee Robert B. Webster also will consider arguments on the payment of costs 
associated with the 7-year-old dispute between Smith and the company. In 
addition, he will hear arguments from Smith's attorneys that he made clerical 
errors and oversights that lowered the amount he awarded Smith and her mother 
for their stock. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of money at stake," said Donald Morrow, an attorney for Paul 
Hastings, Janofsky &amp; Walker, the law firm representing the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
The method of calculating the interest that has accrued during the legal battle 
is considered important. Assuming that the interest would be figured on a 
simple or compound basis and range between 6% and 12%, it could total $59.7 
million to $168.8 million, Morrow noted. 
</P>
<P>
The case goes back to 1983, when Smith and her mother, Athalie Clarke, refused 
to accept the $114 million that Irvine Co. Chairman Donald L. Bren offered for 
their stock. They claimed that their 11% stake was worth $330 million. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute forced the firm to file a lawsuit in Michigan, where it is 
incorporated, to have the court determine a fair market price for the stock. 
</P>
<P>
On June 25, Webster ruled that Smith should be paid $35 million more than she 
was offered seven years earlier. Both sides claimed that the decision was a 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
The question of the interest due and who will pay about $30 million in legal 
costs stemming from the court hearings will center on an October, 1989, change 
in a Michigan law. Under the old statute, the court would have broad discretion 
to determine an "equitable" interest rate, while the new law specifies that it 
should be calculated using a formula tied to a company's average corporate 
borrowing rate. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Friedman, Smith's attorney, will argue that the new statute was not 
intended to apply retroactively. William Campbell, lead attorney for the Irvine 
Co., said the firm will maintain that the new statute should be used to 
determine the interest. 
</P>
<P>
Morrow said that while the company is still refining its calculations, the 
average interest it paid its bank lenders during the period of the lawsuit was 
about 9.5%. Applied to Smith's award, that would yield about $94 million in 
simple interest and $124.2 million in compounded interest. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman said that while he does not believe that the statute chosen to govern 
the shareholder lawsuit will have much impact on the amount of interest that 
will be paid, he believes that it could have an important influence on the 
awarding of court costs. 
</P>
<P>
Each side is trying to get the other to pay its legal bills, estimated at about 
$15 million each. The Irvine Co. believes that it would be favored more by the 
new statute, while Friedman agrees that the old statute is advantageous to 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman said Webster has also agreed to hear arguments about allegedly 
"inadvertent" mistakes made in determining Smith's award. "We think there are 
some arithmetic and clerical errors," he said. "Also, we think there are some 
assets (of the Irvine Co.) that he hasn't seen." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Campbell said that at the Sept. 25 hearing the Irvine Co. will 
demand compensation from Smith for costs associated with a 60-day delay in the 
trial that occurred when her lawyers ordered some studies of the company's 
value to be redone. He said the extra work involved in analyzing the new 
studies cost the company about $700,000.

Hughes Accuser: Michael C. Denlinger, the former Hughes Aircraft Co. staff 
engineer who filed a $9.6-billion "whistle-blower" lawsuit against his former 
employer, is back in court. 
</P>
<P>
Denlinger's original suit, filed in June, 1989, charged that Hughes covered up 
flaws in 4.75 million microchips produced in its defense systems since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department, after conducting its own investigation, decided in 
March that it would not join the suit. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was dismissed April 9 for lack of evidence. At the time, Denlinger's 
attorney, William Humphreys of Santa Ana, said the dismissal was a procedural 
matter, and he vowed that he would file an amended suit. 
</P>
<P>
An amended suit, with what Humphreys said are basically the same charges, was 
filed June 6. Richard Dore, a Hughes spokesman, said the company filed its 
answer denying all charges on June 28.

KEEPING FIT: MOTHER PUT HERSELF AHEAD IN 10K RACE AND THEN IN LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HOFMANN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mickie Shapiro of Costa Mesa was brought up to be a typical '50s woman, setting 
aside her career in favor of her family, focusing her energy on husband and 
children instead of herself. 
</P>
<P>
So when her 5-year-old daughter expressed an interest in becoming a runner 17 
years ago, it was only natural for Shapiro to stand behind her, hobbling around 
the sidelines at track meets in her platform high heels -- the height of 
mid-70s fashion. ("My daughter ran, but I could hardly walk," she says.) 
</P>
<P>
Then one day Shapiro decided she could be even more supportive if she traded 
the platform shoes for running shoes. She started training with another mom, 
running a little, walking until she caught her breath, then running a little 
more. Day by day, her stamina increased and she soon found herself pounding the 
pavement alongside her daughter, then 9, in her first 10K race. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through the race, daughter complained to mother as they ran through 
Beverly Hills in the pouring rain; she had a cramp. And Shapiro's response was 
something neither of them expected: "I told her, 'You're on your own.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, Shapiro says, "she passed me." But by then Shapiro had gone through 
an important change: She had stopped putting herself last. 
</P>
<P>
Fast-forward to fall, 1989, Kona, Hawaii. This time, daughter Deborah was the 
supportive spectator as her mom -- now a successful marriage, family and child 
counselor, sports therapist, instructor in exercise psychology at UC Irvine, 
and triathlete -- competed in the grueling Ironman Triathlon, the most famous 
and prestigious event in the field. 
</P>
<P>
By now, just about anybody with any interest in fitness knows that exercise can 
make you feel good. Most have heard about such things as endorphins, the 
natural, morphine-like brain chemicals released during a sustained workout or 
other activity that can leave you feeling strong, alert and even euphoric for 
hours afterward. 
</P>
<P>
But that's just one of the many emotional and social fringe benefits of 
exercise, says Shapiro, 54, who has incorporated exercise -- running, swimming, 
biking, weightlifting and more -- into all aspects of her life, including the 
career she resumed during the awakening she underwent in the 70s. 
</P>
<P>
She sometimes exercises with the clients who come to her for counseling, 
individually and in groups, even though only about 20% are there primarily to 
concentrate on fitness. The other 80%, she says, "are people reacting to the 
turmoil that change has created in their lives." Most all of them benefit from 
getting in touch with their own physical strength along with their emotions, 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to stimulate and motivate people to get in touch with their bodies," she 
says. "We are a composite of mind and body. If we're mentally imbalanced, we're 
often physically imbalanced, too." 
</P>
<P>
A dancer since she was a young girl, Shapiro taught exercises based on modern 
dance back in the early '60s when her children, now 31, 29, 25 and 22, were 
small. Even then, she recognized that "the women who came got more out of the 
experience mentally than they did physically." She kept that in mind when she 
went back to school, earning a master's degree in counseling and guidance and 
another in dance therapy. Later, working at a state mental facility in Los 
Angeles, she used her training in both fields to develop exercise therapy 
programs, including running, for mental patients. 
</P>
<P>
"Exercise opened all kinds of 'I can do it' attitudes for me," Shapiro says. 
"It showed me I could compete equally with men." And competition, she learned, 
is not a dirty word. 
</P>
<P>
"Most are afraid of success," she says. "We're not programmed to feel good with 
it. But the victories we experience by accomplishing exercise goals help to 
counter that. And a regular, daily goal, even if it's only to spend 20 minutes 
walking, can help us organize other aspects of our lives as well." 
</P>
<P>
The best way to ensure success is to make those goals small and reachable at 
first, rather than programming yourself for frustration and failure by setting 
unrealistic goals. Start, as Shapiro did, by running around the block, not by 
signing up for a marathon. 
</P>
<P>
Each of those small goals comes with its own reward, a sense of accomplishment, 
success and pride. "False pride is very negative," Shapiro says. "But if you 
can truly feel proud about your body, that's very positive. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can count on our bodies, we have more security. We're not as dependent 
emotionally on other people," she says. 
</P>
<P>
As we become more flexible physically, we also tend to be more flexible and 
resilient emotionally, Shapiro says. "The whole essence of mental health is not 
to be defensive and feel threatened." 
</P>
<P>
Exercise, she points out, is also a good way to relieve the tensions that build 
up from work or other areas of life. 
</P>
<P>
And becoming fit "increases your sense of uniqueness. Getting to know your own 
body, its strengths and weaknesses, is an important part of getting to know 
yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Shapiro has collected enough books on running and exercise to 
fill two shelves in her office. But she says too many beginners think they have 
to read and study and know a lot about their sport before getting started. 
"People think they have to know so much, but they can do as I did and learn as 
they go along." 
</P>
<P>
Nor do you need a lot of expensive equipment, she says. "For running, all you 
need are good shoes. You don't need a lot of technology to keep yourself in 
shape." 
</P>
<P>
And even though she began her own fitness quest out of concern for her 
daughter, not herself, Shapiro says that ultimately, it won't work if you're 
doing it for someone else. "You can't be motivated by your children, your 
spouse, your boss or whoever. People have got to want to feel better for 
themselves." 
</P>

YOUTHS OFTEN ENDANGERED FROM SITUATIONS IN WHICH DRINKING AND DRIVING MIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY JO KOCHAKIAN, THE HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's not just bad youngsters who are going to find themselves in danger from 
drinking and driving. Good youngsters are, too. Anybody's children. 
</P>
<P>
Parents don't know how often their children are exposed to dangerous situations 
that mix driving and drinking, says Dr. James Farrow, who has studied the 
issue. And parents aren't doing enough, says Farrow, director of the division 
of adolescent medicine at the University of Washington in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
His research, conducted in 1987 and 1988, surveyed 192 young drivers in 
Seattle-area public high schools. It found a high degree of alcohol and drug 
use with driving among teen-agers. The findings, he says, apply to "virtually 
any suburban area of any city in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Among his findings: 
</P>
<P>
 -- After using alcohol and drugs, youngsters drive even though they know they 
are impaired. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Driving while intoxicated is seen as a normal part of social life among 
teen-agers. Driving around with friends is a social event in itself. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dangerous driving incidents are characterized by reckless intent, driving 
late at night and having friends in the car, with alcohol or drugs being used. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The most dangerous driving takes place after a party, followed by driving 
after spending time with friends at one's home, or theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Highest rates of driving after drinking are among teen-agers who have had 
their licenses less than six months. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Many teen-agers think beer is less intoxicating than other kinds of 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Boys are more at risk for driving dangerously than girls, who are more 
often passengers in dangerous driving incidents. 
</P>
<P>
Teen-agers can be well aware of the dangers, Farrow says, but often don't 
believe that it can happen to them. Many passengers in dangerous driving 
situations later told him that though they were scared at the time, they would 
ride again with the same driver under the same circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the issue that's special to the adolescent driving problem -- they feel 
invulnerable," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Farrow, who recently spoke about his research at a meeting of the American 
Academy of Pediatrics in Seattle, says the problem needs to be fought in 
several ways, including such student efforts as the "contract for life" and 
Students Against Drunk Drivers campaigns, legal deterrents and education. 
</P>
<P>
An educational program Farrow and colleagues developed, conducted in the 
Seattle area, tells parents what situations and personality characteristics 
most put teen-agers at risk. In brainstorming sessions, parents then try to 
come up with strategies to reduce danger for their own children. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents try to do the same thing some state legislators try to do -- make 
driving provisional," he says. "They try to restrict how late (teen-agers) stay 
out, how many kids they're allowed to take in the car. They have sanctions if 
they find out (teen-agers) are not wearing seat belts." 
</P>
<P>
Because research has shown teen-agers are more likely to be in dangerous 
driving situations Fridays and Saturdays after 10 p.m. and in the summer, 
parents can consider curfews accordingly. Because having friends in the car is 
a risk, they can set limits about who or how many passengers will be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
A teen-ager's personality also has to be considered. Research suggests that 
youths who are more likely to be involved in drunk-driving incidents are more 
likely to have troubles with anger or hostility or a feeling of powerlessness 
and have recently dealt with a stressful change (such as moving to a new home 
or failing a grade). Other risk factors are a lack of responsibility, thinking 
of the car as a status symbol and having a poor relationship with the family. 
</P>
<P>
Farrow also found that teen-agers were less likely to be involved in dangerous 
driving when using their own cars, rather than the family car. 
</P>
<P>
Farrow advises parents to have a "contract for life" agreement with teen-agers, 
in which parents pledge to provide a ride home with no harassment when their 
children are intoxicated, or would otherwise drive home with a friend who has 
been drinking. "If used properly, it promotes communication," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Eleven of 15 Cuban diplomats accredited in Panama face a Friday deadline to 
leave the country, expelled because of Havana's refusal to recognize the 
government of President Guillermo Endara, installed during the U.S. invasion 
that toppled Gen. Manuel A. Noriega last Dec. 20. 
</P>
<P>
The expulsions underline what analysts describe as the growing isolation in the 
region of Cuban President Fidel Castro, who supported Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Cuba's ambassador to Panama City was shown the door last March, and Panamanian 
Foreign Minister Julio Linares has warned that his country will sever relations 
with Havana completely unless it ceases its "hostile conduct" toward Endara.

It will be the first such attempt since three of the four feuding Cambodian

EASTERN EUROPE SEEKS A GOOD CONNECTION; 
</P>
<P>
NEW TECHNOLOGY AND JOINT VENTURES CAN HELP RESCUE PHONE SYSTEMS THAT ARE 30 
YEARS BEHIND THE WEST, BUT IT WILL BE COSTLY.

BUDAPEST, Hungary 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since the Iron Curtain lifted last year, East Europeans have discovered that it 
will take a lot more than democracy to get them in touch with the West. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts estimate that the telecommunications network from the Baltic 
to the Balkans is 30 years behind Western Europe and the United States -- a gap 
that Britain's Telecommunications Research Center estimates will cost $350 
billion over 15 years to close. 
</P>
<P>
West German telecommunications minister Christian Schwarz-Schilling said late 
last month that it will cost $33 billion and take six years just to bring East 
Germany's system up to Western standards. 
</P>
<P>
While the outlook thus remains bleak for the average, long-suffering East 
European, technological innovations and the call of an open market may mean 
more rapid change for well-heeled Westerners doing business in the bloc. 
</P>
<P>
The busy signal between East and West is too costly for the emerging 
democracies to tolerate. Western diplomats say entire skyscraper projects have 
been scrapped because of the uncertainty of telephones for them. 
</P>
<P>
It can take 10 years to get a phone installed in Czechoslovakia. The wait in 
Poland is twice that long. In Hungary, the Post Ministry monopoly refuses even 
to discuss the possibility of new hookups. 
</P>
<P>
For decades, Communist rulers channeled state resources into industrial output 
instead of social welfare, lumping communication into the category of luxury 
that citizens would have to wait years for. 
</P>
<P>
That created networks that are shoddy and unreliable -- an economic reality 
that will be harder to overcome than the political deterrents. "Multi-party" 
has always been the rule in telephone lines, if not in politics. Dial tones can 
take hours to click in. Service failures are frequent, and repairs are 
agonizingly slow. 
</P>
<P>
Technology is coming to the rescue, at least for those who can afford it. 
</P>
<P>
Motorola Inc. has announced plans for a $2-billion network of orbiting 
satellites to provide cellular telephone service to remote areas of the planet, 
including Eastern Europe. The company estimates that its new Iridium system 
will expand the worldwide cellular market from about 7 million subscribers 
today to 100 million by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy-seven low-orbiting satellites will direct cellular radio signals from 
one caller's handset to another's, without the need for new switching towers, 
relay stations or pole networks on which the currently exhausted services 
depend. 
</P>
<P>
A flurry of new contracts between state-owned telecommunications departments 
and Western companies reflect the growing belief that the best way to improve 
the existing wire system is to work around it. 
</P>
<P>
* US West Inc. has formed a joint venture with Hungarian Telecommunications 
Co., an offshoot of the Post Ministry, to create a cellular network for 
Budapest this fall and nationwide within three years. Motorola and Sweden's 
Ericksson electronics firms will provide the equipment. 
</P>
<P>
* Atlanta-based Contel has joined a new, private Hungarian firm descended from 
the giant BHG state telecommunications manufacturer to provide radio-telephone 
service beginning early next year. 
</P>
<P>
* Bell Atlantic Corp. and US West have won the right to form a joint-venture 
company with the Czechoslovak Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to 
modernize that nation's phone system. 
</P>
<P>
* Poland has announced plans to break the monopolies of its Post, Telegraph and 
Telephone companies and is currently negotiating with Siemens of West Germany, 
Sweden's Ericksson and Alcatel of France in hopes of establishing a cellular 
network for 200,000 users within the next couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
* West Germany's Bundespost was able to lead the cellular push into Eastern 
Europe virtually overnight last fall by taking advantage of its island of 
proximity in West Berlin. The mobile telephone is already a fixture in the 
briefcases of Western business people in East Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Those working to get the new projects off the ground admit that they are aiming 
for the hard-currency customer. 
</P>
<P>
"The demand for new phones is very big, but the number of people who can pay 
for them is very small," observed Tamas Ligeti, commercial manager of the 
Contel-Hungaria venture that expects to serve 20,000 cellular cellular users 
next year. Vast areas of Budapest are currently without phone service, Ligeti 
noted, thereby blocking new commercial ventures there. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the new mobile phones will exclude the average East European. The 
access fee alone -- about 80,000 forints -- is a year's pay for many Hungarians 
and doesn't include the price of buying or using the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
The dearth of reliable service in Eastern Europe would seem to guarantee 
success for the new ventures. But they are far from risk-free. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland have little cash to contribute to the 
overhaul. The onus will be on Western investors and potential subscribers to 
put up starting capital. 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian ventures depend on advance payments from their clientele to 
provide capital for building new digital switching stations. 
</P>
<P>
Contel-Hungaria promises 21% interest on the deposits if no service is provided 
within a year -- a worrisome reminder of the region's difficulty with 
deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
And the future is uncertain. Both Contel and US West are involved in joint 
ventures in which the Hungarian partners won exclusive license to their radio 
frequencies because of contacts in government agencies -- a holdover advantage 
from monopoly days that may not endure as competition strengthens. 
</P>
<P>
One positive impetus to the new projects was the decision by the Coordinating 
Committee on Multilateral Export Controls -- Cocom -- in early June to relax 
restrictions on technology transfers to nations no longer considered a threat 
to Western security. 
</P>
<P>
However, Cocom has been less willing to clear exports for the Soviet Union, the 
biggest market for telecommunications contracts. US West was denied export 
authorization to lay a fiber optic cable across the Soviet Union on the grounds 
that the technology has military applications.

IT'S THE SPORTSWRITERS' CUP THAT RUNNETH OVER;

<P>
Mamas, let your babies grow up to be sportswriters. 
</P>
<P>
For a month now, 5,000 sportswriters, editors, photographers, radio and TV 
announcers from 80 countries, together with technical wizards enough to repair 
the Hubble, have ricocheted through a dozen Italian cities in the name of 
soccer. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the world's press revels in the World Cup as that once-every-four-year 
extravaganza when the news turns upside down -- when sports fare normally 
relegated to the "back-of-the-book" suddenly dominates front pages and 
television screens from Siberia to Patagonia; Yaounde to the Yalu. More than 
sporting success, at stake is a priceless trophy: national pride. 
</P>
<P>
Well, the party's over. The 52-game, 24-nation tournament ended Sunday night in 
one last full-throated catharsis at Olympic Stadium here. More's the pity. It 
is possible to conclude in the waning blizzard of glamour and adjectives that 
the toughest thing about the Cup for visiting sportswriters is to leave it. 
</P>
<P>
The players are infinitely better paid, but in World Cup times at least, the 
men -- and a few women -- whose journalistic careers are wed to the caprice of 
the bouncing ball, are soccer's royal family. For thousands of them on every 
continent, assignment to a World Cup is among the most coveted of journalism's 
awards. 
</P>
<P>
For the uninitiated, including a sprinkling of foreign correspondents 
masquerading as sportswriters, World Cup journalism in Italy proved a dazzling, 
almost fantasy world where -- what's this? -- there was never any need to chase 
the news. 
</P>
<P>
No traipsing under the broiling sun for a quote at the World Cup. For a month, 
facts and figures came booming in, elegantly prepackaged and practically 
endless. Did you know . . . that Mexican referee is really a gynecologist, and 
really from Uruguay. . . .? 
</P>
<P>
There is a lesson here, for most of the same journalistic cast will be on an 
American stage four summers hence, flitting around the United States which is 
the improbable host for the next Cup. In person, in print and on the tube, the 
world's international sportswriters will be comparing U.S.A. 94's performance 
to Italia 90 memories. 
</P>
<P>
A tough act to follow, too. In Italy, the sportswriters were nursed and 
nourished, flattered and cosseted with an abandon normally reserved for 
conquering heroes. 
</P>
<P>
They repaid public devotion with singular dedication. Never have so many 
written, talked, photographed, filmed, analyzed, debated, so much. About so 
little? 
</P>
<P>
All Italian newspapers, like many counterparts around the world, published a 
special Mondiale section every day. Sports reporters rated every player in each 
game. They produced elaborate play diagrams that looked like intestinal maps. 
All 52 games were minutely dissected in merciless, often repetitive, public 
glare. 
</P>
<P>
Every night, one glamorous Italian TV personality, who boasted about her 
ignorance of the game, perched in a short skirt on a spidery stool to interview 
actors, players, singers, fashion designers, politicians and clerics about all 
aspects of the unfolding soccer drama. 
</P>
<P>
A proceeding both fulsome and fickle, to be sure. 
</P>
<P>
For a month, Italy was filled with journalists for whom each match was a 
passion play; wordsmiths who could transform what might have looked like a 
ho-hum 1-0 game into a ringing exposition on the magnificence of the victors 
and the ineptness of the losers. 
</P>
<P>
When defending champion Argentina lost the opening game, commentators broadly 
denounced its coach as incompetent. When Argentina rallied to reach the finals, 
he was lionized again. By then, the journalistic roof had fallen on the Italian 
coach, whose team yielded only a single goal in six games but was nevertheless 
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Where did we go wrong? the Italian press demanded, switching, one edition to 
the next, from praise to scorn. Fifty-seven million Italians knew the answer. 
All different. And most of them, it seemed, wrote or broadcast their opinions. 
</P>
<P>
One of Italy's two national sports newspapers has a daily circulation of more 
than a million. Both of them routinely process huge quantities of stories and 
pictures with skilled elan in the shadow of late-night deadlines that would 
dumbfound most American newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign correspondents dragooned into writing about the Cup were scarcely more 
at sea than Cup sportswriters writing about the world. One eminent European 
soccer columnist managed in consecutive paragraphs to put Colombia in Central 
America and Costa Rica on an island. But he did correctly pick most of the 
second-round winners. 
</P>
<P>
In Italy, the arcane expertise of the world's soccer soothsayers could hardly 
have been more appropriate. To say that Italy is soccer crazy is like observing 
that the Pope is still Catholic: 95% of all Italian television sets were tuned 
to Italy's heartbreak semi-final loss. 
</P>
<P>
On the tournament eve, Cup-hungry newspapers warned that Italy seemed on the 
verge of a logistics collapse. When the curtain went up, though, seamless 
organization proved more durable than national dreams of a Cup championship. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its run-of-the-mill lovely weather and marvelous food, Italy 
mobilized perks for journalists ranging from freebies and discounts to the use 
of information-laden computer terminals and next-century telecommunications. 
The Cup had five times as many viewers as there are people on the globe, all of 
their sets fed simultaneously from a specially-built television center that may 
be the planet's most modern. 
</P>
<P>
At all game cities, sportswriters found new, cool, spacious, round-the-clock 
press centers built for the Cup and staffed not only by their own myriad 
communications technicians, but also battalions of beautiful, polyglot Italian 
hostesses who served as interpreters and information specialists. Each press 
center, linked to Rome by a sophisticated computer network, boasted its own 
doctors, firemen, bankers, travel agents, free newspapers, coffee bars and 
plainclothes security force. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Rome, there was even a restaurant, and a boutique selling Cup 
souvenirs. Sportswriters who felt cramped on free press buses could cheaply 
rent motorbikes. An obliging sportswear company stood by with trunks and towels 
to lend to sportswriters with time to lounge by the sparkling pool that was a 
venue of the 1960 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Stadium facilities were equally impressive. Every sportswriter got his own desk 
with a television monitor to share with his neighbor for the replays. Computers 
assigned the press box seats, and in the international babel, inevitably made 
strange bedfellows. At one game, an American soccer neophyte, terrorized at the 
prospect of having to expound on a 0-0 draw, found himself sandwiched between a 
German from Hamburg who said he was a sportswriter but couldn't keep track of 
the time, the play or the (lack of) score, and an Egyptian who said he spoke 
both English and Italian but knew neither. 
</P>
<P>
For venturesome sportswriters, those Italian cities where England played 
offered games of a different sort. The British Embassy gave daily hooligan 
press briefings on the maraudings of English zealots who had sallied south for 
the Cup -- that day's count of injured, arrested, deported. 
</P>
<P>
One snooty English financial paper deplored tabloid colleagues who, in 
beer-bellied truculence, resembled the hooligans they had come to cover. "I 
watched in horror today as English fans charged Italian police . . . ," one 
tabloid reporter wrote, describing a footnote encounter between police and 
English hooligans in Sardinia. "World War," read the page-one headline of 
another London tabloid recording the skirmish. 
</P>
<P>
In and out of the stadiums, Italia 90 was great world fun. So much so, that as 
the sportswriting legions head home, it must be with some premonition that they 
have already savored the good old days. Given the consuming disinterest of 
Americans for the sport, U.S.A. 94 may turn out to be a world happening that 
soccer's assiduous chroniclers celebrate to the sound of one hand clapping.

MOVE OVER LONDON, PARIS, ROME: NEW CITIES WANT THE SPOTLIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
CENTRAL EUROPEAN CAPITALS BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE MORE ATTUNED TO THE CHANGES 
TAKING PLACE ON THE CONTINENT AND THAT LOCATION, HISTORY AND CULTURE GIVE THEM 
AN EDGE.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Traditionally, the European capitals recognized as the major centers of 
political, economic and cultural power were automatically taken to be London, 
Paris and Rome. 
</P>
<P>
Big Ben still tolls over the Mother of Parliaments, the Eiffel Tower overlooks 
the City of Light and the Colosseum has not crumbled in the Eternal City. 
</P>
<P>
But nowadays other cities aspire to super-capital status in the new Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Yesterday it was Brussels mushrooming as the center of the European Economic 
Community; today it is Vienna that wants to be the Gateway to Eastern Europe; 
and tomorrow, perhaps, it will be a united Berlin demanding recognition as 
Europe's powerhouse capital. 
</P>
<P>
But cities like Budapest and Prague, too, are attempting to upgrade their 
status as something more than national capitals. 
</P>
<P>
Their aspirations are fueled by a changing Europe that is becoming more 
interdependent -- leading to the rise of regional capitals -- while at the same 
time shifting its center of gravity eastward. 
</P>
<P>
Central European capitals believe themselves to be more closely attuned to the 
rapid and remarkable changes taking place on the Continent -- both political 
and economic -- with vast potential markets opening in Eastern Europe from the 
Baltic to the Adriatic and Black Seas. 
</P>
<P>
These cities plan to take advantage of their geographical and cultural 
relationships with a Europe that is increasingly coming closer, attracting the 
former Communist countries into its orbit. 
</P>
<P>
These emerging capitals believe that London, Paris and Rome have been slow to 
realize the potential of the new political architecture of Europe -- an 
architecture that, whatever final shape it takes, will surely be more canted to 
the East. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the British, French and Italians are belatedly waking up to 
the fact that they could be somewhat eclipsed in the new Europe. 
</P>
<P>
London, for instance, is making a major pitch for the site of the new 
International Bank for Eastern Europe. Paris offers itself as the venue for 
pan-European conferences and is playing political hardball on behalf of 
Strasbourg to ensure that the European Parliament does not shift to Brussels. 
Rome and Milan, relying on Italy's former close ties with Yugoslavia and 
Austria-Hungary, are sending their salespeople east with their order books. 
</P>
<P>
In short, everyone wants a piece of the new European action. 
</P>
<P>
Unquestionably, the potential of new opportunities among the hundreds of 
millions of potential customers in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union is 
staggering. 
</P>
<P>
And the eventual adhesion of more European countries to the 12-member European 
Community could make it the most powerful economic force in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, Vienna is perhaps the European city most involved in capitalizing on 
the shift of balance to the East -- and may serve as a prototype for others. 
</P>
<P>
Vienna proudly points to its history as the capital of the Austro-Hungarian 
Empire, a vast domain that once stretched from the North Sea almost to the 
Black Sea, its bloodstream the mighty Danube, Western Europe's longest river. 
</P>
<P>
As the Hapsburg monarchy's capital, Vienna ruled many peoples, East and West: 
Germans, Belgians, Dutch, Spaniards, Italians, Hungarians, Croats, Serbs, 
Poles, Romanians, Slovaks, Slovenes. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat of the Austro-Hungarians in World War II turned Vienna into a 
provincial Middle European capital. But after decades of slumbering, the city 
of Mozart, Metternich, the Strausses and Freud has reawakened. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Vienna has become an international center with a U.N. complex, 
the International Atomic Energy Agency, and the long-running meeting of the 
35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). Today its 
handsome streets are crowded, its stores a cornucopia of fancy goods, its 
turn-of-the-century coffee houses restored to operetta elegance and its focus 
on the East. 
</P>
<P>
According to one estimate, 700 Western firms now cover Eastern Europe from 
regional offices in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
The list of new arrivals includes Coca-Cola (Pepsico was already there), 
Hewlett-Packard, American Express, Bosch, Daimler-Benz, Honeywell and Miele. 
Dozens of East European firms, too, are locating in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
"Austria has the advantage of intimacy, mutual affinity and personal contacts 
developed over decades," explains William Hedricks, president of an Austrian 
trade association in Vienna. "East Europeans often prefer to do business with 
the Austrian branches of foreign firms." 
</P>
<P>
The new World Trade Center at Vienna Airport will serve as a meeting place for 
business people from East and West; the city is beefing up flights to Eastern 
Europe, and high-speed rail lines are planned to bring Budapest in Hungary and 
Bratislava in Czechoslovakia within commuting distance. 
</P>
<P>
The Austrian capital intends to attract millions of visitors to the 
six-month-long World's Fair in 1995, fittingly called "Bridges to the Future," 
jointly sponsored by Vienna and Budapest -- the first twin-city, world-class 
exposition ever held. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no city in Europe which has so much to offer the new European order 
as Vienna," said Andreas Khol, an executive secretary of the European 
Democratic Union, a conservative political group. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the historic link between Western and Eastern Europe. We speak the 
languages, we know the people and we know how they work. We have a key role to 
play in the making of the new Europe and we intend to make the most of it." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, looking westward, Austria has applied for membership in the 
European Community and hopes to be the next country admitted to that exclusive 
club. Vienna, then, hopes to repeat the transformation that turned the 
once-sleepy capital of Belgium into a major European center. 
</P>
<P>
Brussels emerged from obscurity with the basing there of the European Community 
and the headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, both of which 
increased exponentially in importance over recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Now cranes swing ceaselessly over the gray skyline as the city creates offices 
for the business people, diplomats and consultants who envisage the capital 
moving from strength to strength with the coming of the Single Market at the 
end of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
And Brussels' role is expected to become even greater as the European 
Commission, the EC's executive arm, assumes more power. 
</P>
<P>
In foreign eyes, at least, European Commission President Jacques Delors has a 
higher political profile in Brussels than Belgian King Baudouin I or Prime 
Minister Wilfried Martens. 
</P>
<P>
Both Brussels and Vienna look uneasily toward Berlin, which as the capital of a 
united Germany would be an irresistible magnet for agencies and businesses 
involved in shaping the new Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"Power attracts," commented a West German banker recently. "And when Berlin 
becomes the capital, you will see it attract businesses, agencies and 
diplomatic missions of all sorts. 
</P>
<P>
"While there are many who think the Germans will retain ministries in Bonn, I 
believe it is only a matter of time before Berlin becomes the capital -- with 
all that signifies for a nation of 80 million people in the heart of Europe." 
</P>
<P>
A united Berlin would combine the glitter of the Western sector with the former 
imperial buildings of the Eastern side into metropolis of 3 million people that 
could be the most important political, economic and cultural capital in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In Vienna, residents recall that the old Hapsburg emblem has particular 
significance today. It was the famed Double Eagle, a symbol dating from the 
Roman Emperor Constantine who divided the realm between Rome and 
Constantinople. One head of the eagle gazed fiercely eastward, the other to the 
west. 
</P>
<P>
The Double Eagle's modern equivalent, the Viennese say, has one eye on the 
European Community and the other on the emerging states of the fallen Communist 
empire.

ODD BITS OF AMERICANA HAVE PENETRATED THE COUNTRY'S ISOLATIONIST SCREEN, GIVING

SARANDA, Albania 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five residents surround an American visitor on a beach here on the Albanian 
Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
He is the first American they've met, and the topics for conversation are many. 
For one thing, an Albanian navy patrol boat is buzzing the beach: Occasionally 
a swimmer escapes from this tiny Communist corner of Europe by swimming to the 
Greek island of Corfu, only a few miles away. 
</P>
<P>
But the young Albanians have something else in mind. "How much does a 
Harley-Davidson cost?" asks an English-speaker among them. 
</P>
<P>
In an Albanian textile factory the manager explains to the same visitor his 
rush order for ski parkas for West Germany. An Albanian guide, Ilir Gjoni, is 
translating, but abruptly he stops and stares at the American. "Has anyone ever 
told you that you look like the actor Michael Gross in 'Family Ties'?" 
</P>
<P>
Albania, the last Stalinist regime in Eastern Europe, has long followed its own 
xenophobic path. For decades the government has closed off travel outside the 
country. Only 14,000 foreign tourists were admitted last year. Probably fewer 
than 1,000 were Americans and virtually all of those have relatives among the 
country's 3.3 million people. 
</P>
<P>
The national press, radio and television are strictly controlled, and it has 
been about 50 years since Albania had any trade or diplomatic relations with 
the United States. Yet a visitor finds that odd bits of Americana have somehow 
penetrated this isolationist screen, giving Albanians a strangely selective 
picture of life in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Albanians know that Earvin is Magic Johnson's first name, for example, and that 
Madonna is really Louise Ciccone. It is possible to find Coca-Cola, Apple 
computers, Levi's, even a Cadillac in Albania. But they also believe that 
professional wrestling is a genuinely competitive sport. 
</P>
<P>
About one-third of Albanian high school students study English, which is the 
most common second language. But studying America is still a little like gazing 
at Mars for most Albanians. They can get an impression mostly from radio, 
television, and films, but America remains so distant that their knowledge is 
spotty at best. 
</P>
<P>
A foreign diplomat in Tirana, Albania's capital, describes young Albanians as 
"infected" by capitalism. Students there proudly wear blue jeans and T-shirts 
advertising Pepsi, Alaska, San Francisco, Levi's and Sheraton Hotels. 
</P>
<P>
One young engineer said his most valued possession is a "Manwalk" -- not a Sony 
Walkman but a copy made in China that he bought for $20 at one of a chain of 
foreign goods stores the government has opened within the last year. 
</P>
<P>
Where did he get $20? "In the street in front of the store," the engineer 
explained. The official exchange rate is 7 Albanian leks per $1, but the 
engineer paid 30 leks per dollar on the black market, so his Chinese toy cost 
him nearly a month's pay. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the dollars and other foreign currencies come into Albania from 
relatives living abroad, although Albanians also sell gold at the national bank 
so they can buy goods at the luxury stores. The stores -- similar to chains 
long established in the Soviet Union and the one-time Soviet satellite states 
of Eastern Europe -- are one way the government gets hard currency while 
simultaneously providing a safety valve for some of the frustration that 
otherwise can build up in societies deprived of consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
The Tirana shop, measuring only about 15 feet by 50 feet, is dusty and dark. 
One recent morning people were crowded three deep around the counters. There 
were blue jeans from Turkey ($15), Juicy Fruit chewing gum (50 cents a pack), 
Czech motorcycles ($2,000) and Dutch color TVs ($330). Most are major purchases 
in a country where the average income is $930 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The questions an American visitor hears reflect a fascination with Western 
lifestyles and the cost of supporting them. 
</P>
<P>
"How much does it cost to buy a house?" 
</P>
<P>
"How much is a color TV?" 
</P>
<P>
"How much do you make?" 
</P>
<P>
"What kind of car do you have?" 
</P>
<P>
When an American responds that he owns a Honda, it sometimes causes surprise. 
"Honda makes cars too?" one resident exclaimed. Most Albanians know Honda only 
for its motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
The most prestigious thing an Albanian can own is a motorcycle -- thus the 
beachcombers' question about Harley-Davidson. The lucky few are are most likely 
to buy Czech or East German machines, although Japanese motorcycles are 
considered more fashionable and a few can be seen in Tirana's streets. 
</P>
<P>
Owning a car is impossibly expensive. The few on the road are all 
government-owned. Most are East European models or green Chinese jeeps. 
</P>
<P>
But at Tirana's Kino movie studio, the boss, Viktor Gjika, offers his American 
guest the use of a 1956 robin's-egg-blue Cadillac convertible with electric 
windows and wide whitewall tires. The car was a gift from some 
Albanian-Americans to the late Communist dictator Enver Hoxha. Hoxha liked 
luxuries, but American capitalism was the wrong image, so he gave the Cadillac 
to the government, and now itis used in an occasional film. 
</P>
<P>
The few images of America that come through the official media are carefully 
controlled. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally an American film is telecast in English with Albanian subtitles. 
But the movie must meet the Albanian government's approval, which means any 
nudity is cut and usually the story deals with the darker side of American life 
or with imperialism. 
</P>
<P>
Some recent samples: "Under Fire," the Gene Hackman film about a newsman killed 
in Nicaragua; "Missing," the Jack Lemmon movie set in Chile around the time of 
the Allende coup, and "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" the Jane Fonda character 
study set at a Depression-era marathon dance. 
</P>
<P>
Albania has been making films for about 30 years, but movie directors still use 
American films as an educational tool. Kino Studio produces 14 feature films, 
18 documentaries and 16 cartoons a year on a 14-million lek budget (about $2 
million), according to studio chief Gjika. He says the old Marlon Brando film 
"Viva Zapata" is required viewing. "Our filmmakers grow up on this film. Brando 
controls himself so well." 
</P>
<P>
The average Albanian feature film costs about $90,000, and it shows: Gjika says 
his directors use East German color film and concedes that the "quality is 
desiring." Occasionally the studio uses Kodak film bought in France "for scenes 
with special lighting. But it's expensive." 
</P>
<P>
Enver Derhemi, head of the cartoon department, says he tapes Walt Disney, Bugs 
Bunny and Tom and Jerry cartoons from Italian TV. The Albanians have been 
producing cartoons since 1975, and "Walt Disney is like a school for us," he 
says. "We've learned the language of animation from him." 
</P>
<P>
Many residents listen to short-wave radio broadcasts by the Voice of America, 
British Broadcasting Corp. and other stations. 
</P>
<P>
Young people love rock and roll but they don't get it from Albanian radio. The 
occasional American song heard on Albanian stations, such as "When a Man Loves 
a Woman," are instrumentals and sound like Muzak, so the young tune in foreign 
stations and can talk at length about Tina Turner, Stevie Wonder, Michael 
Jackson and Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
Because original cassettes or phonograph records of Western rock music are not 
for sale in Albania, friends get together with a dual-cassette recorder (price: 
3,500 leks, or about half a year's salary), and blank tape cassettes (100 leks 
on the black market) to record their own from foreign broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
The government's skimpy TV offerings also drive Albanians to search for Western 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Homemade Albanian antennas pull in Italian and Yugoslav TV. In the south, 
Albanians can pick up Cable News Network from Corfu. 
</P>
<P>
Gjoni, the Albanian guide, used to spend weekends in Kruje, a medieval castle 
city 2,000 feet up in the mountains near the Adriatic Sea, where it's possible 
to receive clear signals from 10 Italian TV stations, including several pay 
channels, and two Yugoslavian stations. "I stayed 24 hours a day watching 
films," Gjoni said. 
</P>
<P>
He talked about Bruce Willis, Charles Bronson and Paul Newman and asked, "Is 
Elizabeth Taylor all right?" Gjoni is one of the few Albanians with access to a 
VCR; he has both a Betamax and a VHS in his office. 
</P>
<P>
The rock music channel MTV, broadcast from Yugoslavia, is popular with young 
people. Basketball is another favorite American export. Italian television 
broadcasts NBA games, and one Albanian said authoritatively: "Magic Johnson is 
No. 1. Michael Jordan is No. 2." Another basketball aficionado insisted, "The 
Harlem Globetrotters are the best." 
</P>
<P>
The Albanian Establishment is not entirely pleased with all these uncontrolled 
foreign images. Hamit Beqja, psychology professor at the lone Albanian 
university, says foreign TV is "light, sugary, with not much substance, like 
lemonade" and adds, "Foreign TV has violence and sex. These are contradictions 
with our traditions." 
</P>
<P>
Albanians see Italian commercials for Jacuzzis while most cannot even buy 
toilet paper. They see Madonna dancing in black underwear while few Albanian 
women even use makeup, couples avoid kissing in public and many women are 
virgins when they are engaged. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the trauma of Hulk Hogan and "catch," as the Albanian 
beachcombers call professional wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
When their American visitor explained that most of his countrymen consider pro 
wrestling to be about as free-form as a three-act play, one of the Albanians 
slapped a hand to his head. "This is very upsetting!" he said. "How can there 
be a winner and a loser?" 
</P>

$6 MILLION FOR SEPTUPLETS; 
</P>
<P>
INFERTILITY CLINIC WILL PAY FAMILY 
</P>

<P>
The family of Sam and Patti Frustaci, a 35-year-old Riverside woman who gave 
birth to the nation's first septuplets in 1985, today received a $6.2-million 
settlement from a Westwood infertility clinic. The parents had sued charging 
the treatment led to conception of the children, three of whom died shortly 
after birth. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of the settlement from Tyler Medical Clinic in Westwood was 
announced this afternoon in Santa Monica Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
The Frustacis have charged that infertility specialist Dr. Jaroslav Marik 
failed to properly monitor the mother's use of the powerful fertility drug that 
led to her pregnancy. The result, they said, was the death of three of the 
sextuplets and the severe physical and devlopmental impairment of the three 
survivors. 
</P>
<P>
The Frustacis contended that the surviving children suffer profound lifelong 
disabilities, including cerebral palsy and serious eye problems. They said 
Marik failed to conduct a key test before artificially inseminating Patti 
Frustaci, a test that might have warned of problems to come. 
</P>
<P>
Marik denied the allegations and objected strenuously to the settlement 
discussions, which went on without his consent. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Marik said Patti Frustaci was obsessed with getting pregnant and 
took a higher dose of the fertility drug than was prescribed. The defense also 
presented a far cheerier picture of the surviving children, saying that "if you 
saw them, you wouldn't be able to see anything wrong with them." 
</P>
<P>
When the sevenfold pregnancy lessened the likelihood of full-term, healthy 
babaies and threatened the mother's health as well, doctors recommended a full 
abortion or "selective reduction" that would leave one or two embryoes with a 
good chance to thrive. 
</P>
<P>
The Frustacis, both members of the Mormon faith, said the taking of lives in 
such fashion was contrary to the will of God and the teachings of their church. 
</P>
<P>
Patti Frustaci was referred to the Tyler clinic after repeated attempts at 
pregnancy had failed. After treatment with the fertility drug Pergonal, she 
became pregnant, and the septuplets' older brother was born in March, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1984, she returned to the clinic for another attempt. Pergonal was 
used again, and this time, septuplets were conceived. 
</P>
<P>
Marik explained that multiple pregnancies are always possible when fertility 
drugs are used. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the chance you take," he told a reporter. "It's rather simplistic to 
think you can control the situation." 
</P>
<P>
When her obstetrician, Dr. Martin Feldman, learned of the multiple pregnancy, 
he advised either a full or partial abortion, but Patti Frustaci refused. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is that it is murder," she said. "I can't take Baby A and keep C 
and kill B and keep D. I'm not God." 
</P>
<P>
The septuplets were born more than 10 weeks early at St. Joseph's Hospital in 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
One died at birth. Four others died within the next three weeks.

Karem was jailed June 27 for refusing to say who arranged a telephone interview 
with jailed capital murder suspect Henry Hernandez. Hernandez and his brother, 
Julian, are charged in the March, 1989, shooting death of a San Antonio police 
officer, Gary Williams.

Karem today identified the source as Deborah Ledesma, a cousin of the Hernandez

He said he decided to reveal the name after Ledesma, who now lives in

The owner of a Radio Shack electronics store was ordered today to stand trial

The three former part-time employees told Allegan District Judge Harry Beach 
that their boss, Howard DeYoung, gave them keys to the store and told them they 
were free to use the television room any time after closing.

<P>
Beach bound DeYoung, 38, over for trial after rejecting defense lawyer Larry 
Woods' claim there was no evidence to suggest the tapes were made for 
commercial purposes. 
</P>

The three young women were asked to identify who appeared on the tapes and when 
they might have been made. All three said they had no idea they were being 
taped and that DeYoung had told them a security camera in the room could be

Former West Virginia Gov. Arch Moore was sentenced today to five years and 10 
months in prison and fined $170,000 on his pleas of guilty to five counts of 
public corruption. 
</P>
<P>
The sentence was handed down by Special Judge Walter Hoffman less than 24 hours 
after an unsuccessful bid by Moore to withdraw his guilty pleas to five federal 
corruption charges. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman ordered Moore to report to the minimum-security federal prison in 
Petersburg, Va., by July 31. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-month sentence for obstruction of justice was added on to four 
concurrent five-year terms for mail fraud, extortion and two income tax 
charges. Moore, a Republican and the state's only three-term governor, could 
have received maximum sentences of 36 years in prison and $1.25 million in 
fines. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Joe Savage told the judge that Moore has refused to accept 
full responsibility for his actions by failure to give the government complete 
information on $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions used in the 1984 
campaign. Savage said Moore has only given information concerning $20,000 and 
has refused to say where the rest of the monies came from.

Bob Hawke, who once held a world record for beer drinking, today celebrated 
becoming Australia's second-longest-serving prime minister with a cup of tea 
and reflection on his firm grip on power. 
</P>
<P>
Hawke, 60, sipped tea to celebrate 2,678 days in office during which he has 
been transformed from a brash trade union leader into a presidential-style 
leader who weeps openly and regards Australia's 17 million people as "mates." 
</P>
<P>
Hawke, Labor prime minister since March, 1983, agreed he had once been 
loudmouthed, aggressive and prone to heavy drinking. In 1989 he tearfully 
apologized on television to his wife of 33 years for being unfaithful. 
</P>
<P>
"There were all those things but there was a constancy. I was always a very, 
very hard worker," he said on television. 
</P>
<P>
While in college in the 1950s, Hawke won an entry in the Guinness Book of 
Records for drinking 2 1/2 pints of beer in 12 seconds. He says he gave up 
drinking in 1980.

Harvard University said today it has set up a scholarship fund that converts 
Ecuadorean national debt into grants for students from the Latin American 
country to study at the prestigious institution. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard said it will devote $5 million to acquire Ecuadorean debt currently 
worth about 15% of its face value and donate it to Fundacion Capacitar, an 
educational foundation in Ecuador. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation will then exchange the debt obligations in Ecuador's Central 
Bank for government bonds worth 50% of the debt's face value. 
</P>
<P>
The program is expected to provide scholarships and grants for more than 70 
students and professors over the next decade. It will also provide research and 
study grants and internships in Ecuador for Harvard scholars. 
</P>
<P>
Debt conversion has been used throughout Central and Latin America for such 
projects as the protection of natural resources in so-called "debt for nature" 
swaps. Harvard said its program is the first "debt for education" swap. 
</P>
<P>
Ecuador currently has $11.2 billion of outstanding foreign debt. Of this, 58% 
is owed to commercial banks, 22% to international financial institutions and 
20% to foreign governments.

IRS: FOREIGN FIRMS IN U.S. PAY LOWER TAX THAN TYPICAL FAMILY

<P>
Foreign companies operating in the United States chalked up $686 billion in 
U.S. sales in 1987 but paid a far lower federal income tax rate than did the 
average middle-income family, the Internal Revenue Service said today. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. subsidiaries together paid $5.6 billion in tax, a rate of less than 1% of 
their income. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the typical $35,000-a-year family paid at the rate of about 10% 
during the same period, according to IRS estimates. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS submitted the new information to the House Ways and Means oversight 
subcommittee, which for nine months has been investigating the extent of tax 
dodging by some of the nearly 45,000 foreign companies that operate 
subsidiaries in this country. 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee zeroed in on 36 U.S. distributors of foreign cars, motorcycles 
and electronics, which accounted for a combined $35 billion in retail sales in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the companies investigated have been operating in the United States 
for years and have never sent a check to Uncle Sam for one thin dime in 
corporate income taxes," said Rep. J. J. Pickle (D-Tex.), chairman of the 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
"They have failed to pay taxes despite the fact they have profited from selling 
billions of dollars of cars, motorcycles, stereos, televisions, VCRs, 
microwaves and other products to the American consumer," Pickle said. 
</P>
<P>
Subcommittee investigators said the main factor in the companies' ability to 
avoid taxes was "transfer pricing" -- a practice in which a subsidiary 
typically pays an artificially inflated price for goods purchased from its 
overseas parent. The result is a lower taxable profit in the United States.

BUSH'S SON LASHES OUT AT ACCUSERS, DEFENDS COLORADO S&amp;L DEALINGS

President Bush's son Neil says it would have "been much easier" to sign a civil 
decree sought by savings and loan regulators over his bank dealings and "move 
on in terms of just the quality of my life." 
</P>
<P>
In the consent decree, sought several months ago, Bush would have agreed to 
abstain from further banking activities -- without acknowledging any 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview published in today's editions of the Washington Post, the 
35-year-old Bush said his decision to seek full exoneration rather than sign 
the decree has resulted in negative publicity that has "dominated my life for 
six months" and also may help Democrats gain political advantage against his 
father. 
</P>
<P>
In an eight-page statement issued over the weekend and in a series of 
interviews, Bush contends he has done nothing wrong in connection with the 
failure of Silverado Savings &amp; Loan and maintains he has become a 
"political football" -- a victim of political "opportunism" and "press 
sensationalism." 
</P>
<P>
He said he is fed up with sitting on the sideline while being publicly attacked 
for his savings and loan dealings and is coming out of his "cage" to defend 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he decided to fight "because I know I haven't done anything wrong." 
</P>
<P>
He said he is looking forward to a public hearing on his case in September 
before an administrative law judge in Denver that he says will offer an 
unbiased, quasi-legal forum for his defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been kind of like a little caged-in animal in an unsanitary zoo," Bush 
told the Post in an interview in his Denver office. "Now my cage is open and 
I'm telling people . . . what my side of the story is. And I feel good about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Bush conceded in the Post interview that he got "an incredibly sweet deal" in 
the form of a $100,000 loan from a Denver investor; Bush wasn't required to 
repay the loan if the oil business it was intended to benefit did not turn a 
profit. But he said the loan was "totally unrelated" to his work as a director 
of Silverado, even though the investor who made the investment loan later was 
granted a line of credit from Silverado.

FORMER BOESKY ALLY FOUND GUILTY OF 4 TRADE FRAUD COUNTS

<P>
Former high-flying stock speculator John Mulheren Jr. was found guilty today on 
four counts of securities fraud for helping Ivan Boesky break a long list of 
securities laws in exchange for inside information. 
</P>
<P>
But the jury remained deadlocked on 26 other charges. U.S. District Judge 
Miriam Cedarbaum accepted the partial verdict from the jury and sent them back 
to continue deliberations on the other charges. 
</P>
<P>
The maximum sentence is five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on each of the 
counts. 
</P>
<P>
Mulheren, 40, formerly a chief trader at now-defunct investment firm Jamie 
Securities, had been charged with 30 counts of conspiracy, securities and mail 
fraud and keeping false records. 
</P>
<P>
Although the government objected to the partial verdict, the judge said she 
would accept it. 
</P>
<P>
"My experience is that it is wise to take from the jury the verdicts they have 
reached and to allow them to continue on those they have not reached," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After accepting the partial verdict, she told the jury that she did not believe 
that it had spent an inordinate amount of time deliberating the charges. 
</P>
<P>
The jury began deliberating June 29 after a seven-week trial. 
</P>
<P>
The charges stem from several schemes in which Mulheren allegedly helped Boesky 
cheat on his income tax, manipulate stock prices and avoid rules dictating how 
much money trading firms must have on hand to cover losses. 
</P>
<P>
The trial was closely watched because Boesky, who was at the heart of the 
government's long-running probe of insider trading on Wall Street, took the 
stand for the first time as a key prosecution witness. 
</P>
<P>
Boesky, once one of Wall Street's most powerful speculators, was sentenced to 
prison for three years and paid $100 million in fines and repayment of 
ill-gotten funds. Boesky was released from a Brooklyn halfway house in April. 
</P>
<P>
Although Boesky and Mulheren had been close friends at one time, their 
relationship soured after Boesky began cooperating with prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Mulheren, a manic depressive who takes lithium to control his condition, 
threatened to kill Boesky in 1988. When police arrested Mulheren in front of 
his New Jersey home, they found several firearms in his car. 
</P>
<P>
Mulheren's defense attorney attempted to discredit Boesky during 
cross-examination and final arguments. At the close of the trial, Mulheren's 
attorney called Boesky a liar and a "pile of human garbage." 
</P>
<P>
Mulheren, who always dressed casually at the trial, had taken the stand on his 
own behalf. He usually wore sports shirts, no tie or jacket and frequently no 
socks. 
</P>
<P>
Among the charges were that Mulheren manipulated the price of Gulf and Western, 
now Paramount Communications Inc., to help Boesky make a greater profit when he 
sold a large stake in the company.

Sen. Jesse Helms probably doesn't appreciate it, but he has something in common 
with a dead skunk -- both are featured in the works of a North Carolina 
songwriter. 
</P>
<P>
The Charlotte Observer reported today that Helms (R-N.C.) is featured in the 
offbeat lyrics of songwriter Loudon Wainwright III, whose recording "Jesse 
Don't Like It" is scheduled for release July 23. 
</P>
<P>
Wainwright, who hails from Durham, N.C., hasn't had a hit since 1973, when his 
song "Dead Skunk," about a dead skunk in the middle of a road, made the Top 20 
charts. 
</P>
<P>
"Jesse Don't Like It" rails against Helms for his conservatism, especially his 
opposition to the use of taxpayer-supported National Endowment for the Arts 
funds for what the senator considers obscene works. The song goes: 
</P>
<P>
 If Jesse says it's dirty, it don't get any funds. 
</P>
<P>
 They use that taxpayers' money on tobacco and guns. 
</P>
<P>
 And your freedom of expression is being denied. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you're not sure what you like, just let Jesse decide. 
</P>
<P>
 Helms could not be reached for comment, and his campaign spokeswoman, Beth 
Burris, said she has not yet heard the record.

TOP-RATED 'CHEERS' PULLS NBC TO NIELSEN VICTORY

NBC's "Cheers" is not only the most popular show on television these days, but 
it also served as a magnet to attract viewers to a couple of new programs that 
cracked the top 10 this week and bounced some favorites down the ladder. 
</P>
<P>
"Cheers" ranked No. 1 in the Nielsen ratings for the third consecutive week and 
is now the top-rated show to date for the traditional 42-week season. 
</P>
<P>
"The Cosby Show," also on NBC, jumped from seventh place last week to the No. 2 
position, its best ranking since the week of March 19. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the continuing reign of "Cheers," some real surprises surfaced in 
the ratings for the week ending July 8. ABC's "Roseanne" dropped from a tie for 
third-place last week to a tie for 10th place with another blue-collar sitcom, 
Fox's "Married . . . With Children." 
</P>
<P>
"Blossom," an NBC pilot that is being considered a possible midseason 
replacement, preceded "Cheers" in the 8:30 p.m. Thursday time slot and captured 
third place, the best performance for an NBC pilot so far this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Starring Mayim Bialyk, "Blossom" is described as a comedic coming-of-age story 
seen through the eyes of a 13-year-old living in Los Angeles. The series also 
stars Richard Masur and Barrie Youngfellow. 
</P>
<P>
A rebroadcast of the "Seinfeld" pilot held onto the "Cheers" lead-in and 
finished fourth in the weekly ratings. 
</P>
<P>
CBS's "Murphy Brown," which has popped up in the top 10 a number of times, tied 
for eighth place with NBC's "Golden Girls." CBS's "Designing Women" slipped 
slightly from a tie for No. 3 last week to fifth place. 
</P>
<P>
NBC had six shows in the top 10, including the top four shows on the Nielsen 
scoreboard, CBS had three and ABC and Fox had one each (counting the tie for 
10th place). For the week, NBC won Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday night; ABC 
took Monday, Tuesday and Friday, while Sunday belonged to CBS. 
</P>
<P>
In the stakes race for Sunday night movies, NBC again had the top-rated show, 
"A Stoning in Fulham County," which finished 18th, followed by ABC's Part 1 of 
"The Bourne Identity," which finished 34th, and CBS's "The Woman He Loved" in 
49th place. 
</P>
<P>
NBC was in first place for the week ending July 8 with a 9.0 rating and a 19 
share. Close behind was ABC with an 8.9 rating and a 19 share and CBS posted a 
7.6 rating and a 16 share. 
</P>
<P>
For the 42-week year-to-date race, NBC is on top with a 13.6 rating and a 23 
share, ABC has a 12.2 rating and a 21 share and CBS has an 11.5 rating and a 20 
share. 
</P>
<P>
In the nightly news race, ABC kept its top spot. "World News Tonight" with 
Peter Jennings scored an 8.4 rating and a 20 share, the "CBS Evening News" with 
Dan Rather was second with an 7.4 rating and an 18 share, while "NBC Nightly 
News" with Tom Brokaw posted a 6.9 rating and a 17 share. 
</P>
<P>
Each ratings point represents about 921,000 households. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

Actress Blair Brown balks at the notion that all single women are looking for a 
man. Brown, a non-married, working mother, says, "I don't think women are 
waiting for that key piece any longer." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that they don't want that closeness," Brown said in an interview in 
the August issue of McCall's magazine, "but we're more like men now. Women 
don't have to settle, and they don't anymore." 
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old actress, who stars in cable television's "The Days and Nights 
of Molly Dodd," says her time is divided between long workweeks and weekends in 
the country with her 8-year-old son, the product of her nine-year relationship 
with actor Richard Jordan. Although the couple split up about five years ago, 
Brown says they remain close. 
</P>
<P>
As for why she never married, Brown says: 
</P>
<P>
"When I was younger, it was certainly about breaking the rules, but I think now 
it's just a question of following your own heart and finding you're just not in 
sync with whatever the norms are."

MAPPLETHORPE EXHIBITOR DOUBTS LEGAL ACTIONS

The director of the Boston gallery that will host a controversial touring 
exhibit of Robert Mapplethorpe photographs next month says he expects some 
protests but no legal challenges to the show. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not anticipating any legal challenges at the moment," David Ross, 
director of the Institute of Contemporary Arts, told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit, "Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment," consists of about 160 
Mapplethorpe photographs, mainly of flowers, nudes and faces. But it includes 
five works depicting homoerotic acts and two of nude children from 
Mapplethorpe's "Z" portfolio, which some politicians and religious groups have 
branded obscene. 
</P>
<P>
The National Endowment for the Arts came under fire for helping fund the show 
in Washington last summer, sparking a national debate on obscenity in the arts 
and fueling a congressional battle over the NEA's grant process. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit appeared in several cities without incident and drawing 
record-breaking crowds until it reached Cincinnati, where a gallery and its 
director face a jury trial on obscenity charges for exhibiting Mapplethorpe's 
works. Record numbers also saw the show in Cincinnati, where it was closed for 
only one day while officials photographed the works. 
</P>
<P>
Ross told reporters that several groups, which he refused to name, have vowed 
to mount protests against the show and that he has been asked privately not to 
exhibit the "Z" portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
But Ross, a friend of the late Mapplethorpe who died in Boston last year, said 
there is "no chance, no way that this exhibit will be edited." 
</P>
<P>
Ross said the small gallery in Boston's Back Bay expected up to 70,000 people 
to see the exhibit, about as many as ordinarily visit the museum in an entire 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Membership in the institute, which will be the last gallery to host the 
exhibition, has in recent weeks increased 50%, he said.

Charlton Heston says he hates to see epics such as "Ben-Hur" relegated to 
videotape and television screens. 
</P>
<P>
"Any film originally made for theaters suffers a great deal in the transfer to 
videotape," he said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"When someone says, 'Oh, I just got a video of "The Ten Commandments" or of 
"Ben-Hur," for my birthday,' I have to tell them, 'Sorry, but you haven't seen 
it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Heston was in Detroit to mark the big-screen reopening of his 1959 movie 
"Ben-Hur" at the Fox Theater. 
</P>
<P>
"Here (at a theater), the moving-image arts are seen as they are meant to be 
seen, in all their glory." 
</P>
<P>
Heston, 64, won an Academy Award for his role as Judah Ben-Hur. The film, about 
Roman rivalries in Jesus' day, is known for an 11-minute chariot race that 
Heston says remains the greatest action sequence ever filmed.

Dr. Thomas Starzl was expected to be back seeing patients this week after 
undergoing coronary surgery in the hospital he helped make famous for 
innovative transplants. 
</P>
<P>
The 64-year-old surgeon was released today from Presbyterian-University 
Hospital, where doctors removed a blockage from his right coronary artery. 
</P>
<P>
Starzl, who performed the world's first successful liver transplant at the 
University of Colorado in 1967, was admitted to the hospital Sunday with chest 
pains. 
</P>
<P>
Starzl's physician, Dr. Bruce Wilson, ordered an angioplasty, in which a 
catheter was put into the artery and used to inflate a tiny balloon to clear a 
blockage. 
</P>
<P>
"He's doing quite well," Wilson, director of the University of Pittsburgh's 
Heart Institute, said at a news conference. "We expect a speedy recovery." 
</P>
<P>
Starzl has worked since 1981 at the University of Pittsburgh hospital, which 
last year performed 463 liver transplants and 210 kidney transplants.

architect. He said he'll spend about $100,000 to restore the five-bedroom home 
as a tribute to Wright.

The purchase price wasn't disclosed. Monaghan, who owns Domino's Pizza Inc. and 
the Detroit Tigers, had been trying to sell the 4,000-square-foot house for 
more than a year. He had dropped the price several times to about $215,000.

Jim McMahon agreed to a one-year deal today with the Philadelphia Eagles, who 
expect to use him as a backup to starting quarterback Randall Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Buddy Ryan said McMahon understands the Eagles' plans for him. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no problem. He was interested, he wanted to be an Eagle," Ryan said at 
a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Terms were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
The deal reunites the quarterback and defensive coordinator from the 1986 Super 
Bowl champion Chicago Bears. The Bears traded him last August to San Diego, 
where he started 11 games for the Chargers, including a 20-17 victory over the 
Eagles. He became a free agent after the season. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon's agent, Steve Zucker, said his client was ready to play second string 
to Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
Zucker wouldn't say whether McMahon was taking a big cut in salary to join the 
Eagles.

Rob Moore, the Syracuse wide receiver, was chosen today by his hometown team, 
the New York Jets, in the NFL's supplemental draft. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, who grew up five minutes from the Jets' training camp in Hempstead, 
N.Y., was taken in the first round of the weighted lottery. 
</P>
<P>
The league would not say if he was taken with the first pick, but he was chosen 
in the first tier, made up of the teams with the poorest records. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, who had one year of eligibility remaining at Syracuse, graduated in June 
after catching 106 passes in three years and setting school records with 2,122 
yards and 22 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Two other players are available for the supplemental draft: tight end Willie 
Williams of LSU, who caught 13 passes for 183 yards and one TD in three years, 
and Ricky Martin of Grambling, who filed as a defensive back but did not play 
college football. The draft was continuing through later rounds to determine if 
they would be selected. 
</P>
<P>
By drafting a player, a team forfeits a 1991 regular draft selection.

COMMENTARY: CONFERENCE SHUFFLE MAY RESHAPE COLLEGE FOOTBALL, TV PAYOUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK MASKE, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To the rules that govern the motions of terrestrial bodies must be added a new 
concept: conferential drift, the tendency of a large college sports league to 
try to engulf smaller ones when motivated by the pursuit of revenue. And when 
the NCAA's major football conferences begin acting in earnest upon what has 
been stirring for months, they promise to gobble up everything in their paths 
with a race toward Manifest Destiny that could reshape the face of 
intercollegiate athletics. 
</P>
<P>
This summer may see the groundwork laid for rampant additions, defections and 
mergers that could test the structural boundaries of Division I-A, as the 
nation's elite schools and conferences scurry to establish regional 
strangleholds in anticipation of megabucks television contracts. The eventual 
result could be the disintegration of several existing conferences, the 
affiliation of most independents and, by the mid-1990s, the emergence of three 
or four "superconferences" with two divisions and 12 to 16 schools apiece -- a 
transformation many see as the first step toward creating a college football 
playoff system. 
</P>
<P>
"Where it all leads, I don't think anyone is sure right now," said Navy 
Athletic Director Jack Lengyel, who just completed his term as president of the 
National Assn. of Collegiate Directors of Athletics. "But it does seem clear to 
me that there will be some sort of realignment in the very near future. . . . 
The kind of money you're talking about makes that inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
The possibilities are intriguing. What finally could emerge are an Atlantic 
Coast Conference stretching from the Northeast to Florida; a Big Ten, which 
recently added Penn State, that might have further holdings in the Northeast or 
from the current Big Eight (Nebraska, most prominently); a Southeastern 
Conference sprawling westward into Texas and including South Carolina and one 
or two more Florida teams among its Atlantic entries, and a revised Pacific-10 
picking up what it can in the West (Colorado, Brigham Young and Air Force, 
among others). 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma has entertained notions about jumping from the Big Eight to the 
Southwest Conference -- a move that could become moot if, as some close to this 
process insist, the Big Eight and SWC eventually are left with no choice but to 
combine. An on-again, off-again Eastern Seaboard Conference for football 
composed of independents and Big East schools needing a football-only league 
may yet arise. 
</P>
<P>
By the middle of the decade, most observers agree, there will be considerable 
movement involving college football's six major conferences and the 20 or so 
significant independents. Of those presently unaffiliated, only Notre Dame -- 
essentially a conference unto itself, owing to its personal network TV contract 
-- appears likely to remain that way. 
</P>
<P>
The process began in December with Penn State's move to the Big Ten and was 
accelerated in February when Notre Dame bucked the College Football Assn.'s 
freshly negotiated TV deals with ABC and ESPN to sign instead with NBC. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame's individual network deal stems from a 1983 Supreme Court decision 
that opened the marketplace, finding the NCAA's monopoly on football television 
rights to be a violation of federal antitrust laws. The CFA has since been the 
negotiator for the members of every major conference except the Big Ten and 
Pac-10, plus 20 independents, with participation voluntary -- a stipulation 
that allowed for Notre Dame's pullout. 
</P>
<P>
(Another catalyst to the realignment fever is the Federal Trade Commission's 
investigation of the CFA package, which covers 63 teams. The FTC could find the 
CFA's deal to be an illegal monopoly, which would enable individual conferences 
to negotiate their own TV contracts earlier than anticipated. CFA officials, 
however, seem confident Notre Dame's defection helps ensure the arrangement 
will not be found to violate antitrust laws.) 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath, the nation's other powerful football leagues were left 
wondering whether they might be better served by negotiating their own network 
contracts next time around. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Schultz, executive director of the NCAA, has said he envisions a future of 
superconferences; his predecessor, Walter Byers, once predicted the same. "What 
you have now is more talk than movement," Schultz said at a recent meeting of 
the Knight Commission. But "I think it's probable you'll see the talk translate 
into movement." 
</P>
<P>
The floodgates haven't opened yet, but they may soon -- especially with 
Arkansas having agreed to begin formal discussions with the SEC about joining 
its existing 10 teams. If the Razorbacks -- with the prospect of doubling their 
intake from conference revenue-sharing -- end their 76-year membership in the 
SWC, the SEC (like the Big Ten) would be one school short of the magic number: 
NCAA rules allow a league with 12 teams or more to match division winners in a 
one-game playoff to determine a champion. 
</P>
<P>
Such a setup, most officials in major conferences believe, would produce a TV 
revenue bonanza. "It's hard even to venture a guess at the dollars that might 
be involved in that," said Virginia Athletic Director Jim Copeland. "The 
numbers are so big already." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the CFA's contracts with ABC and ESPN will bring a combined $300 
million over five years, beginning in 1991. The Big Ten and Pac-10 have their 
own deals with ABC, while Notre Dame's agreement with NBC reportedly is valued 
at $30 million over five years. Yet those figures don't even match the NCAA's 
network TV intake before the 1983 ruling; realignment can be viewed most 
basically as a struggle to create more lucrative packages for TV. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm told the '90s will be a move toward three or four superconferences," 
Arkansas Athletic Director Frank Broyles said. "Well, there are three or four 
networks to broadcast college football, if you count ESPN. It's reasonable to 
assume, I guess, that each conference could have its own network tie-in." 
</P>
<P>
But that's not all. A break into two six- or eight-team divisions would allow a 
conference to have a network deal, plus perhaps two syndicated television 
arrangements, a conference championship game and the foundation for a national 
playoff that would have the networks salivating. 
</P>
<P>
"Most conferences would increase their TV revenue by up to 50%," an SEC 
official said. "Some might come close to doubling it. . . . And, in most cases, 
you're only talking about adding two to four teams." 
</P>
<P>
Said CFA Executive Director Chuck Neinas: "Change is inevitable, and the time 
for it has come. It will come, and it will come soon. The only question is in 
what form."

MCC HIGH-TECH CONSORTIUM TAPS FIELDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA K. H. WALTERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again, Microelectronics &amp; Computer Technology Corp., the 
high-technology research consortium better known as MCC, is in the spotlight. 
This time, it's because of Craig Fields, who on Monday joined MCC as its 
president and heir-in-waiting to Chief Executive Grant Dove. 
</P>
<P>
Fields is the former head of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency 
whose dismissal from that Pentagon post in April has become a symbol of the 
Bush Administration's antipathy for a national industrial policy. 
</P>
<P>
Fields is somewhat perturbed by his role as an icon, and said on Monday after a 
day of news conferences and interviews that he was most uncomfortable with 
questions dealing with his controversial ouster and what lies ahead for DARPA. 
</P>
<P>
But by the same token, the public scrutiny that Fields engenders may be a 
blessing to MCC. 
</P>
<P>
The spotlight, Fields said, will help him in "recruiting new people and new 
members" for MCC -- a task that seems to be never-ending for the 7-year-old 
research consortium. 
</P>
<P>
Fields comes to MCC with proper credentials, having long been a proponent of 
research consortia and being a solid supporter of Pentagon funding for 
Sematech, now a neighbor of MCC in Austin, Tex. Fields said on Monday that he 
would like to foster cooperation between the two research groups. 
</P>
<P>
At the time it was founded, MCC was a bold move -- the kind that Fields and 
DARPA encouraged -- and its creation was due in large measure to the publicity 
stirred by the deft hands of Bobby Ray Inman, the retired admiral and former 
"super-spy" of the Central Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency. 
But member companies, many of them restless and several disgruntled enough to 
leave MCC within five years of its founding, seemed relieved to slip out of 
national attention after Inman left and Dove, a veteran manager from Texas 
Instruments, succeeded him as chief executive in early 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Dove spent his first two years at MCC, he said on Monday, rebuilding member 
support for the consortium and speeding technological gains out the door. MCC 
now boasts contributions to several major product advances and 47 patents. 
</P>
<P>
But now, Dove and Fields said Monday, is the time to redefine MCC's goals. 
Fields will be intimately involved in that process, Dove said. Fields also is 
in line to replace Dove as chief executive sometime next year, conditioned on 
the board's approval, as Dove retreats to a less-involved role as part-time 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the new vision for MCC may exclude the so-called Fifth-Generation 
computer project, a counterpart to Japan's much-touted drive to build computers 
using artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fifth-Generation technology," Dove said, "was an important driving force 
to start MCC . . . but it's not the clarion call that it was seven or eight 
years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Now, he said, "We need two or three major thrust areas that are as simple to 
explain as Fifth Generation was." DONNA K. H. WALTERS

JIM MURRAY: HE SUCCEEDED BY THE SEATS OF FANS' PANTS

<P>
Time was in this country when all you needed to hype a heavyweight title fight 
was a remote training camp with primitive communication facilities, a lively 
imagination and friends on the city's sports desks. 
</P>
<P>
You had the heavyweight champ saving somebody from drowning, preferably an 
orphan, or stopping a runaway team of horses with the mayor's daughter 
screaming and trapped in the carriage. It might help if he were instrumental in 
putting out a convent fire or carrying nuns to safety. 
</P>
<P>
Boxing needs hype. All sports need hype. A guy who wouldn't raise the kitchen 
shade to look at a ballgame in the lot next door will mortgage the house and 
pay scalpers' prices to go see a game if he knows Jose Canseco or some other 
guy whose picture has been in all the papers and on TV is in it. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows this better than Irving Rudd, whose business it has been to put 
bottoms in chairs for sports promotions ranging from Ebbets Field in Brooklyn, 
to Yonkers Raceway to the Caesars Palace parking lot in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
No one does it any better than Irving Rudd, who has written a book on his life 
and times, "The Sporting Life, or The Duke and Jackie, Pee Wee, Razor Phil, 
Ali, Mushky Jackson and Me." The book, like its author, is pixieish, 
fun-loving, occasionally irascible, but full of the wonder of a guy who still 
can't believe his good luck over the years. 
</P>
<P>
If you've never seen Irving Rudd, just picture a chipmunk with glasses. Or Bugs 
Bunny. That's Irving. The fighters used to call him the Happy Rabbit. You look 
at Irving and you want to ask him what he did with the carrot. 
</P>
<P>
Life is not so simple for the sports flak anymore. Irving can't have the champ 
saving damsels from drowning because the sports desk will check the police 
reports and TV will want to interview the drowning "victim." 
</P>
<P>
But Irving is not without his resources. When he signed on as press agent for 
the trotting track, Yonkers Raceway, and he saw the track's sign go up, a light 
went on in his head as he watched the letters being lowered into place. He 
asked the workmen to transpose the A and the Y to make the sign come out: 
"Yonkers Racewya." 
</P>
<P>
Big mistake, right? Hah! Irving got the picture on every sports page and 11 
o'clock news in the country. You go spell. Leave Irving alone. 
</P>
<P>
Not that Irving didn't make mistakes. One of them was getting General Douglas 
MacArthur to go to the Brooklyn Dodgers' ballgames. It was the year Irving was 
the Dodger press agent. He read in the paper where the general, a big baseball 
fan, visited Yankee Stadium and the Polo Grounds. Irving is miffed. He phones 
the general. What about the Dodgers? 
</P>
<P>
The general's aide agrees. The general shows up at a Dodger game. And another 
Dodger game. And another Dodger game. The general -- God help us! -- is a fan. 
He sees 13 games. The Dodgers lose all 13. 
</P>
<P>
Alas! It is the year the Dodgers blow a 13-game lead in August and lose the 
pennant to the Giants in a playoff. Irving does some fast figuring. Anyway he 
adds it up, the Dodgers blow a 13-game lead. The general shows up for 13 losing 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Who do you think lost the pennant? Historians may point to breakdowns in 
defense, the Ralph Branca pitch to Bobby Thomson, the manager's strategy. But 
Irving Rudd knows who lost the 1951 pennant: General Douglas MacArthur. The 
hero of Inchon is no use at all at the Little Miracle of Coogan's Bluff. Irving 
wishes he'd go jinx the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
You always know when a major fight is coming along. You get this upbeat call 
from Irving Rudd. What they do with Irving is not waste him on the favorite. 
Muhammad Ali is fighting Earnie Shavers? Irving goes to Shavers' camp. Anyone 
can get Muhammad Ali's name in the paper, reasons Rudd. But when Ali stops 
speaking to the press -- on the eve of the first Leon Spinks fight -- Rudd is 
rushed into the breach. Pretty soon, Ali is speaking again. So is Irving. 
</P>
<P>
Irving works for Sugar Ray Leonard only once -- the Marvin Hagler fight. It is 
enough. He doesn't care for the sensation. He doesn't care for Sugar Ray 
Leonard. "Enough incidents have occurred to make me think this chapter (on 
Sugar Ray Leonard) should be titled, 'The Boy Next Door Is a Deleted.' " Irving 
writes. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he loves Thomas Hearns. "A mensch," he says of Hearns. It is 
Irving's highest compliment. Thomas gives interviews, Thomas makes appearances, 
Thomas hypes the gate. For the first time in his life, Irving roots for a 
fighter when Hearns fights Leonard the second time. "If you didn't have a good 
view of the fight, you could tell how it was going by observing Irving Rudd," 
Bert Sugar of Boxing Illustrated says. "How did the fight come out?" someone 
asked Irving after the match. "I got a draw," Irving answered. "I wuz robbed." 
</P>
<P>
Says Irving: "If nothing else, Hearns differs from Leonard in his sincerity. He 
proves to me he is a very good, kind guy and he certainly makes my job easier." 
</P>
<P>
The plight of the press agent is, he must serve two masters -- the client and 
the media. Irving Rudd's strength was, he remained steadfastly loyal -- and 
truthful -- to his pals in the sports departments. When Irving went to work for 
Off Track Betting in New York, he acknowledged to reporters, "They haven't got 
anybody in the place who would know Secretariat from a mule. It takes them six 
minutes to book a bet." When they let him go, he thanked them. "It is like 
getting off the Titanic," he tells the media. When a New York Giant assistant 
press agent once wouldn't give Grantland Rice a seat in the main press box, 
Irving got up and gave him his. 
</P>
<P>
Irving never got out of Brooklyn, really. Someone once said, "When he talks, if 
you close your eyes, you can hear the beer cans rippling in the old Gowanus 
Canal." 
</P>
<P>
Irving is probably only a little over 5 feet, but about 4 feet 9 of it is 
heart. Once, when he walked into the barber shop of the Fontainebleau Hotel in 
Miami, he sees a familiar figure. It is Beau Jack (ne Sidney Walker), the 
famous old pugilist whose fights he once publicized. 
</P>
<P>
Beau is in an unfamiliar pose. He has a rag and a can of polish in his hands. 
The man who made millions in the ring is shining other peoples' shoes for a 
living. He smiles when he sees Irving. "Why, Mr. Rudd! Can I shine your shoes 
-- for nothing?" Rudd looks at him. "No, Sidney, you can't shine my shoes," 
Irving says. "Why not?" Beau Jack says. "Because," says Irving Rudd, "you were 
the lightweight champion of the world."

<P>
The second baseman of the Chicago Cubs is known as Mr. Excitement to the media 
of this city. It is not -- though it could be -- a description of Ryne 
Sandberg's brilliance on the field but rather a facetious reference to his 
mellow manner off it, the absence of substantive quotes and his seeming quest 
for privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Display an empty notebook while grumbling about these traits to Tom Lasorda, 
the Dodger manager, and he asks a logical question, "What do you want, an 
orator or a ballplayer?" 
</P>
<P>
What you get in the case of Ryne Dee Sandberg is a blue collar ballplayer who 
someday will stand on the steps of the Hall of Fame and be forced to become an 
orator. 
</P>
<P>
It seems certain that Sandberg's appearance in tonight's 61st All-Star game at 
Wrigley Field -- he was the leading vote-getter in the National League -- is 
simply another steppingstone on the way to Cooperstown. 
</P>
<P>
Mention that possibility to Sandberg and he smiles, shakes his head and says, 
"I think of Cooperstown in terms of retirement, and that's a long way off -- at 
least, I hope it is." 
</P>
<P>
Sandberg is 30 and in his ninth season with the Cubs. He was the National 
League's most valuable player in 1984, and is having an even better year this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
He may be the best of the best now. Top Gun among the aces gathered here for 
tonight's game. The quintessential proof that silence is golden. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, it would be tough to pick a better one," said Cub Manager Don 
Zimmer, when asked if Sandberg had become baseball's best player. "There's 
nothing he can't do. I mean, I've seen him have some awfully good streaks, but 
from Day 1 of this season I don't know how you could be better. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just the best I've seen at that position in my 42 years, and I've been 
around guys like Jackie Robinson, Joe Morgan, Red Schoendienst and Bill 
Mazeroski." 
</P>
<P>
During a June in which the headlines were going to Darryl Strawberry, Sandberg 
merely batted .377 with 14 homers and 25 runs batted in. He entered the 
All-Star break leading the league in hits, runs, total bases, slugging 
percentage, extra-base hits and home runs. He has 24 homers this year and a 
major league leading 43 since last year's All-Star break. If he hits 30 this 
year he will become the first second baseman to do so in consecutive years. In 
addition, he is third in the league with a .335 batting average and sixth in 
runs batted in with 57. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, Sandberg's glove might be his principal weapon. In pursuit of his 
eighth consecutive Gold Glove, he has made only three errors. Said Zimmer: 
"I've never really seen Sandberg angry, but when he does make an error it's 
like the end of the world." 
</P>
<P>
An errant throw on May 19 ended an errorless streak of 123 games and 584 
chances, the longest ever by an infielder, excluding first basemen. A bobbled 
grounder on June 23 represented his first misplay with the glove in 156 games 
and 753 chances. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a time when I just went through the motions," Sandberg said, 
referring to his early years as a minor league shortstop and third baseman. 
"I've since learned that I have to kick myself, that concentration is the key 
to good defense." 
</P>
<P>
Concentration and practice. No one works harder, according to Cub third base 
coach Chuck Cottier, who hits Sandberg pregame grounders whether he is in the 
lineup or not. 
</P>
<P>
"Right, left, straight at him," Cottier said of the daily regimen. "He even 
practices back-handing the ball behind second base and one-hopping his throw to 
first. He came to me in spring training and said that he was concerned about 
getting ready with the short camp and wondered if I'd come out with him early 
each morning so that he could take extra infield. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the best I've seen, and there's a reason for it. He works at it." 
</P>
<P>
Of Sandberg's ethic -- work and otherwise -- Cub General Manager Jim Frey said: 
</P>
<P>
"Never in my seven years here have I heard or seen him make an excuse or look 
for an out. He plays sick, he plays hurt, he plays hard. 
</P>
<P>
"There's never been one incident here where his approach or integrity was 
questioned. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, we've got guys who've been in the big leagues all of four days 
bitching about buses, hotel rooms and everything else. God forbid they ever get 
a hit." 
</P>
<P>
Or hit 30 home runs as Sandberg did last season, Frey added. 
</P>
<P>
"In that case they'd be on every talk show in the city saying they invented the 
game," Frey said. "I call 'em celebrity-athletes. Ryno would just as soon put 
on a mask when he leaves the park and be left alone. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the way he is, the way he's most comfortable. I once said to him that he 
was probably the best athlete in this city and if he forced himself to be more 
outgoing it would be a tremendous benefit to him financially, but he hasn't 
changed in the seven years I've been here, and probably never will. Which is 
why I say that beyond the stats, when you see how he goes about it every day, 
when you see him play hurt and seldom miss a game, he hasn't received enough 
recognition for his approach alone, especially compared to others." 
</P>
<P>
Cub pitcher Rick Sutcliffe, who frequently drives to and from Wrigley with 
Sandberg, laughed and said they have had some real quiet trips. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just a very private person," Sutcliffe said of Sandberg. "I do know he 
loves golf and hates losing. 
</P>
<P>
"Even with the great year he's having, the losing bothers him a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Sandberg is the latest athlete to have a candy bar named after him, but he has 
obviously never pursued the spotlight, it has always found him. He was an 
All-American high school quarterback in Spokane, but rejected two-sport offers 
from Oklahoma and Nebraska to accept a similar invitation from Washington State 
-- less glamorous but closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
He told the baseball scouts not to bother, but the Philadelphia Phillies didn't 
listen. They drafted him in the 20th round, offered third-round money, and he 
elected to sign, deciding that he could be seriously injured in football and to 
heed the advice of his brother, Del, who played at Washington State and told 
Sandberg that he might get lost in college, that the scouts might never see 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"That was before ESPN," Sandberg said with a wink. 
</P>
<P>
That was 1978, and Sandberg went on to have four solid seasons in the Phillies' 
minor league system at a time when the varsity was top-heavy with high priced 
superstars and had Mike Schmidt at third base, Larry Bowa at short and Manny 
Trillo at second. 
</P>
<P>
That was also the period in which Dallas Green, the Phillies' farm director, 
became manager, then moved to the Cubs as club president after the '81 season 
and immediately pulled off one of the all-time heists, persuading his former 
team to include Sandberg as a throw-in in a deal that sent Bowa to the Cubs for 
Ivan DeJesus. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard various explanations," Sandberg said of his inclusion in that deal. 
"I guess the Phillies didn't believe those good seasons I had in the minors 
were for real. I don't know what they think now." 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't matter, of course. Sandberg scored 103 runs as a 1982 rookie third 
baseman and moved to second in 1983, becoming the first player to win a Gold 
Glove in his first season at a new position. 
</P>
<P>
In the spring of '84, Frey, then the Cub manager, had a talk with Sandberg, 
attempting to convince him that he had home run potential. 
</P>
<P>
"It had nothing to do with his swing or his mechanics," Frey said. "I felt he 
had the size and athleticism to be a more productive hitter, but he was 
satisfied, as he is socially off the field, to be in the background. The image 
he had of himself as a No. 2 hitter was to be a setup man for the big guys. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him that I wanted him to start thinking of himself as one of those big 
guys, to think of himself as the guy who could win a game in the late innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him, 'Did you ever think about being the most valuable player in the 
National League?' " 
</P>
<P>
Sandberg hadn't, but he immediately began to perform like one. He hit 19 
homers, drove in 84 runs and batted .314 as the Cubs won the 1984 Eastern 
Division title and Sandberg was voted MVP. 
</P>
<P>
In his office at Wrigley Field, Frey smiled and said: "Nothing he does 
dramatically surprises me. He's a pure athlete. You could hand him a tennis 
racket and he'd be a top player in 15 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Sandberg still bats second and represents the best of all worlds to the Cubs, a 
contact hitter who can hit behind the runner and do all the little things 
required of that position in the batting order, as well as recognizing his 
ability to drive the ball when the count and situation permit. 
</P>
<P>
He is legitimately a Baby Ruth, as former St. Louis Cardinal Manager Whitey 
Herzog called him after he hit two home runs off Bruce Sutter in a pivotal game 
during the 1984 race. Herzog added that Sandberg might be the best player he 
had ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
Sandberg, of course, has already surpassed his home run statistics of that MVP 
year and is an even better all-around hitter and player, though Strawberry's 
resurgence may make it difficult for Sandberg to repeat the feat of teammate 
Andre Dawson, who won the 1987 MVP while the Cubs finished last. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger catcher Rick Dempsey was talking about Sandberg's development the other 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way, you have to pitch around him and go to the next guy, even if it's 
Andre Dawson," Dempsey said. "You have to respect the hotter of the two 
hitters. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to hope you can pick at (Sandberg) enough to make him hit a bad pitch 
to where it will least hurt you, which is the opposite field, though he has 
good power that way, too." 
</P>
<P>
There are players who would be satisfied to finish the 1990 season with the 
statistics Sandberg has compiled in the first half. Some of it, he said, is a 
carryover from the confidence gained by 30 home runs last year, some from his 
ongoing maturation and physical development. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still learning how to hit and improving at it," he said. "I would be 
disappointed if I wasn't a better hitter now than I was in '84. I think the 
statistics show that I am, that I'm having a better year, and that's all you 
can look at, really." 
</P>
<P>
People magazine may have been using different criteria when it recently 
selected Sandberg as one of the world's fifty most beautiful people, which may 
not have surprised Sandberg's wife, Cindy, but did, he insisted, surprise the 
honoree. 
</P>
<P>
"I only expected to be in the top 55," he said with a grin, a rare display of 
emotion by the ballplayer known as Mr. Excitement.

Howard Duff, whose resonant, cynical growl was the radio voice of detective Sam 
Spade and whose virile, well-traveled features became known later to two 
generations of filmgoers and TV viewers, died early Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Duff, most recently on television as Sheriff Titus Semple on "Flamingo Road" 
and Sen. Henry Harrison O'Dell on "Dallas," was stricken at his Santa Barbara 
home. He was taken to St. Francis Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. He 
was 76. 
</P>
<P>
His wife of 17 years, Judy, said he had suffered a heart attack late Sunday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Duff died a day after taking part in a local telethon to raise money for 
victims of last month's devastating Santa Barbara fire, which left hundreds 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
With former wife Ida Lupino, Duff became a favorite on the Hollywood scene, 
appearing opposite her in a short-lived TV situation comedy series in 1956-57 
entitled "Mr. Adams and Eve." It was a classic case of life imitating art as he 
portrayed half of a husband and wife film-star team battling with studios, 
agents and themselves. 
</P>
<P>
He also was a regular on such television series as "Dante" (as an international 
adventurer), "Felony Squad" (as a police detective) and the anthology "Science 
Fiction Theater." His nearly two dozen movies included "Kramer vs. Kramer," 
"The Naked City," "The Late Show," "While the City Sleeps" and "A Wedding." 
</P>
<P>
He was a frequent guest on such TV shows as "The Golden Girls," "Falcon Crest," 
"Midnight Caller" and "Knots Landing," appearing on the last as Paul Galveston. 
</P>
<P>
He also appeared in the miniseries "War and Remembrance." 
</P>
<P>
But none of them ever seemed to recapture the Duff mystique as did Sam Spade, 
first heard over the nation's airwaves in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
The radio show, sponsored by Wildroot Cream Oil and adapted from Dashiell 
Hammett's 1930 crime classic "The Maltese Falcon," showcased Duff as Spade, a 
mildly alcoholic, mostly down-and-out private detective whose first question of 
prospective clients was, "How much money you got on you?" 
</P>
<P>
After leaving the show Duff married Lupino. That was in 1951, four years after 
making his motion picture debut in "Brute Force." They divorced in the early 
1970s after having a daughter, Bridget, who was born in 1952. Along with his 
wife, she survives him as does a brother, Doug.
