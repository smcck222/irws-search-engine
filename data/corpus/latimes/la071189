CIGARETTE MAY HAVE SET FIRE ON MT. LAGUNA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

A "carelessly discarded" cigarette may have been the cause of a fire on Mt. 
Laguna that burned to within 200 yards of campgrounds and homes Monday morning 
and has scorched more than 4,000 acres, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze, which began Sunday morning, has forced scores of campers and 
residents to flee, said California Department of Forestry Capt. Dan Frias. The 
blaze was still out of control Monday night and may take several days to 
control. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a convict firefighter was killed and six others were injured in Big 
Sur as they battled one of more than 40 major wildfires that continued to burn 
out of control Monday in the hot, dry West. 
</P>
<P>
At Mt. Laguna, cabins and a one-time Air Force base have escaped damage from 
the fire, which started about 8:30 a.m. Sunday on U. S. Forest Service land 
just south of the Cuyapaipe Indian reservation, where fire investigators found 
a cigarette they believe started the fire, Frias said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reservation Land Scorched 
</P>
<P>
About one-third to half of the reservation land, home of the Southern Diegueno 
tribe, was destroyed, said Rosalinda Ewen, a spokeswoman for the U. S. Forest 
Service. No structures on the reservation were burned, Ewen said. 
</P>
<P>
Five firefighters have suffered minor injuries, said forestry department 
spokeswoman Cele Cundari. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighting operations were complicated Monday when one of the tanker planes 
being used to drop fire retardant was damaged in a "wheels up" landing at an 
airstrip in Ramona. No one was injured, but the plane blocked the runway, 
stranding two other tanker planes on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
The fire traveled quickly north through the reservation Sunday night and early 
Monday, Frias said. About 11:15 a.m. Monday, the fire roared west through a 
canyon and threatened the Burnt Rancheria campgrounds and landmark Laguna 
Mountain Lodge and Trading Post. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a run for our money," Frias said. The fire, he said, "made a good run 
at homes." 
</P>
<P>
The fire burned through a fire retardant line that crews had set up by hand at 
the top of the canyon, Frias said. 
</P>
<P>
But firefighters from the forestry department, the Forest Service and several 
rural departments built another fire line that stopped the blaze about 200 
yards from the campgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Seda, owner of Laguna Mountain Lodge and Trading Post, could see smoke 
from his business as it rose through the trees across Sunrise Highway. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It Was Boiling Up' 
</P>
<P>
"It was boiling up, and that's when (authorities) told us to leave," Seda said. 
</P>
<P>
But Seda, who said he was in no danger, decided to stay. "The building, that 
was the only thing I was concerned about," Seda said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the lodge's occupants had left Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Down the road, Pat Huntington also decided to stay in her home. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the homestead -- you just don't bail," Huntington said. Her wooden 
house was built by her great-grandfather in the mid-1800s, Huntington said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not dumb. We got everything ready just in case (we had to leave," 
Huntington said. 
</P>
<P>
The rocky terrain and steep canyons made it difficult for crews to reach 
sections of the blaze, Frias said. The terrain also created fire pockets that 
endangered crews, Frias said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just hoping to get through till the evening," said Frias, when cooler 
temperatures made it easier to fight the blaze. "There's still a potential 
danger until we get a secure line," Frias said of the hazard to homes. 
</P>
<P>
Four air tankers, three helicopters and 1,050 firefighters battled the blaze 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze, dubbed "The Thing" by firefighters because of its location in Thing 
Valley, caused authorities to close four to five campgrounds on Mt. Laguna. 
</P>
<P>
Sunrise Highway north of Interstate 8 was also closed to non-residents through 
late Monday night, Cundari said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities ask that anyone with information about the cause of the fire call 
445-5587 or 588-0364. 
</P>
<P>
Across the West, more than 11,500 firefighters were on lines in California, 
Oregon, Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado and Nebraska, among 
them personnel shipped in from Alaska where they were freed up by rains that 
had quenched several weekend blazes there. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Finklestein, a spokeswoman at the federal Interagency Fire Center in Boise, 
Ida., said fires burning since the weekend began had charred more than 167,000 
acres by nightfall Monday. At Big Sur, gusting winds, rugged terrain, heavy 
brush and a lack of access roads hampered the more than 700 firefighters 
deployed around an arson blaze in and around Molera State Park about 20 miles 
south of Carmel. Officials said at least 2,600 acres had been blackened by 
nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said Antonio Hernandez, 26, who was serving time on a 
narcotics-possession conviction in San Diego County last November, was killed 
Sunday night when a fire-weakened tree fell on him and other members of a state 
Department of Corrections crew from the Galiban Conservation Camp near Soledad. 
The injuries suffered by six others were said to range from minor scrapes to 
broken bones. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Sanders, a state corrections officer, said that, despite the tragedy, the 
convicts want to continue battling the fire. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all shook up, but they want to keep fighting," Sanders said. "All this 
time, they've been losers -- druggers, dopers. But when they see a wall of fire 
and cut the line that stops it, they know they are doing something positive." 
</P>
<P>
In Northern California, almost 1,150 fire personnel continued to work the lines 
around a blaze that had charred more than 4,600 acres of timberland in the 
Sierra west of Honey Lake in Lassen County. 
</P>
<P>
In nearby Plumas County, gusting winds continued to harass about 600 
firefighters working in heavily forested terrain south of Prattville. There 
were no reports of injury or damaged structures, but more than 4,000 acres had 
burned since the fire broke out Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The West's most devastating blaze, in property damage, was the 1,760-acre 
Sugarloaf Mountain fire west of Denver, where 42 homes and seven other 
structures burned Sunday afternoon as flames raced through Boulder Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
In Nebraska, a fire continued to spread after charring more than 60,000 acres 
and destroying an undetermined number of ranch and farm buildings near the town 
of Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
In Utah, fire crews reported they were close to containing a 15,500-acre fire 
in remote brushland about 20 miles west of the Colorado state line and three 
other blazes that had blackened a total of about 10,000 acres.

INMATES MAY FUEL RECYCLING PLANT; 
</P>
<P>
STATE HAS $97-MILLION VISION OF TURNING TRASH TO ENERGY ON OTAY 
</P>

<P>
State prison officials hope to build a $97-million trash-to-energy plant at the 
new prison on Otay Mesa, where 800 inmates could be put to work sorting through 
tons of garbage by hand each day. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, proposed by the Prison Industry Authority after two years of quiet 
study, would be the first in the country to use cheap prison labor to promote 
recycling, produce electricity and ease the garbage crisis that threatens to 
overwhelm landfills in San Diego County and the rest of the country. 
</P>
<P>
The county's shrinking landfill capacity was one reason why prison officials 
settled on the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in Otay Mesa for the 
proposed trash-to-energy plant, said a consultant hired by the state Department 
of Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'The Have Plenty of Garbage' 
</P>
<P>
"They have plenty of garbage, . . . and they are aware they have a problem," 
said Peter Stasis, project manager with Stone &amp; Webster Engineering Corp. 
in Denver, of San Diego. "We realized we could handle some of that for them." 
</P>
<P>
The plan is still in its conceptual stages, and prison officials concede it 
could face significant environmental hurdles and community opposition. But 
proponents and at least one county supervisor Monday expressed guarded optimism 
that the trash-to-energy plant could be built by the 1993 target date. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say it has at least a 50-50 chance," said Larry Harrison, chief of the 
prison authority's new-industries implementation division. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, discussed in a voluminous preliminary report, the prison plant 
would cover 40 of the 774 acres at the Otay prison and cost $94 million to $97 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Using cheap inmate labor, it would be the state's largest and most lucrative 
prison industry, making $26 million a year, according to projections. 
</P>
<P>
"We came up with the ability to move 98% of the material back into the economic 
system," Harrison said of the garbage. "We feel with the inmate labor, which is 
a cheap labor force, we could economically do that and make a profit at the 
same time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1,000-Bed Addition May Be Proposed 
</P>
<P>
The plan may also call for building a 1,000-bed addition to the medium-security 
prison to house a wing for minimum-security prisoners allowed to work in the 
trash plant, Harrison said. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter dated June 26, prison officials asked the county to consider 
signing a 20-year contract to commit 1,000 tons a day of residential garbage to 
the prison that would otherwise go to county's Otay Mesa landfill, about 3 
miles from the prison. 
</P>
<P>
The amount, equal to the garbage generated by 500,000 people, is about half of 
what is already dumped daily at the Otay landfill, which is expected to reach 
its capacity by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
In return for easing the pressure on the Otay landfill, the prison would take 
90% of the "tipping fees" paid by private haulers to unload their trash. The 
private haulers now pay the county $10.50 a ton, but that fee will increase to 
$13.50 in October. 
</P>
<P>
The garbage would be hand-sorted by 800 inmates, who would be paid an average 
of 50 cents an hour to pick out such materials as newspapers, glass and 
plastic. Those materials would either be sold to private companies or used in 
other prison enterprises, Harrison said. 
</P>
<P>
Left behind in the waste stream would be organic materials, such as grass 
clippings and food scraps. That would be mixed with sewage from the prison and 
deposited into closed "digester" tanks, where microorganisms would help 
decompose the mixture and create methane gas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gas Would Make Electricity 
</P>
<P>
The gas, in turn, would be used to power generators and make 28 megawatts of 
electricity, which could then be used to run the Otay prison and other state 
facilities or be sold to the local utility. The water used to cool the 
generators would be circulated through pipes at the prison for hot showers and 
heating, Harrison said, adding that even the estimated 96,000 tons of residue 
left in the digester tanks could be sold as compost. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison said the prison trash-to-energy plant would be the first in the 
country to use the digester system, which is popular in European trash-recovery 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
Digester tanks should not cause the kind of community uproar that repulsed 
other trash-to-energy plant proposals based on burning the refuse, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Harrison conceded, the plan faces considerable hurdles. State law now 
prohibits the sale of prison-made articles to anyone except governmental 
agencies or a foreign firm. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison said the prison authority is seeking a change in state law so the 
plant could sell its recyclable materials to domestic firms such as Reynolds 
Aluminum, even though the operation could be profitable without such a change. 
</P>
<P>
He said the plant would have to win approval from local air- and 
water-pollution officials, who would have to be assured that the enterprise 
would not pose an environmental hazard. 
</P>
<P>
Others on Monday raised objections to the sketchy plan, which will be the 
subject of a more-detailed prison authority feasibility study. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Labeled 'Exploitation' 
</P>
<P>
Joe Francis, head of the San Diego-Imperial Counties Labor Council, said the 
plan smacked of "exploitation" because the prisoners would only be earning 25 
cents to 90 cents an hour. The plant would be taking jobs away from other 
workers, and labor would oppose any law change sought by the prison authority, 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Takvorian, executive director for the Environmental Health Coalition, 
also said the inmates may face safety hazards from the toxics found in 
household cleaners, paints and other chemicals thrown into the trash. 
</P>
<P>
"Have they got protective clothing on?" Takvorian asked about the inmates. 
"Have they got respirators? Have they got something that is protecting their 
eyes and their breathing passages?" 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County Supervisor Brian Bilbray, however, said he was "guardedly 
optimistic" about the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to see the prison in our neighborhood to start with, and, if we 
can get the benefit, fine," said Bilbray, who represents the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
As long as the prison uses refuse otherwise destined for the Otay landfill, 
which serves the South Bay, there will be no complaint from his constituents, 
Bilbray said. 
</P>
<P>
But all that will change if the prison trash-to-energy plant takes garbage from 
other areas of the county. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have one trash can coming from north of Division Street, the South Bay 
will go to war over it," Bilbray said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ASBESTOS FOUND AT CITY YARD SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Preliminary test results of siding taken from buildings that were torn down at 
the former Lawndale city yard indicate the material contains asbestos, an Air 
Quality Management District air pollution specialist said. 
</P>
<P>
Samples of the siding, which were tested by chemists at the AQMD laboratory, 
will be sent this week to a private laboratory to confirm the agency's 
findings, said specialist Michael Haynes. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the city of Lawndale is cited or fined will depend on a number of 
factors, including the results of the independent laboratory's test, the amount 
of asbestos in the material and the size of the buildings that were demolished, 
Haynes said. 
</P>
<P>
The testing was done amid complaints by neighbors who warned of possible 
asbestos contamination from dust from the demolition site drifting into their 
yards and homes. 
</P>
<P>
The three old houses on the lot, which had been used by the city as storage 
space, were being torn down after residents complained that they had fallen 
into disrepair.

POLICEMAN EXONERATED IN SHOOTING OF BOY, 14 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego police officer was legally justified in shooting the teen-age 
passenger in a stolen car because the officer "had a right to stand his ground" 
and not retreat from the fleeing vehicle, the San Diego County district 
attorney has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
In a report written by the district attorney's office and released by police 
Monday, the prosecutors said that, when Osefel Bey, the driver of the car, 
attempted to flee in the stolen car, "it was reasonable for Officer Daniel Vega 
to conclude" that he was going to be hit. 
</P>
<P>
Vega, a four-year police veteran, fired four rounds, and one bullet wounded 
14-year-old Leonard Tippins in the base of the skull. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Duty to Retreat' 
</P>
<P>
"Officer Vega had no duty to retreat from Bey's backing car," the report said. 
"An officer threatened with an attack that justifies self-defense need not 
retreat. He may stand his ground and defend himself with reasonable force. 
</P>
<P>
"Had Officer Vega held his fire and continued retreating, Bey might have 
followed him and hit him with the Colt," the report continued. "Officer Vega 
was not required to submit to this risk. He had a right to stand his ground and 
use whatever force was necessary to eliminate it." 
</P>
<P>
Along with the report detailing the April 19 shooting in Southeast San Diego, 
police released two other reports from the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Those reports covered San Diego police shootings earlier this year. In both 
cases, officers involved in the shootings were also absolved of any criminal 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
The Vega shooting drew an outcry from many in the Southeast community, 
particularly because the victim was so young and the crime of auto theft did 
not appear to many to justify shooting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Near Fatality Scene 
</P>
<P>
The incident also occurred near the site of a fatal shooting about the same 
time, in which an officer entered a man's home and, during a drug arrest, shot 
him six times. 
</P>
<P>
That case, involving the killing of Stanley Buchanan by Officer Timothy Fay, is 
still under review by the district attorney's office. Police spokesman Bill 
Robinson said Monday that the district attorney's office has told police that 
the Fay report will probably not be issued until next month. 
</P>
<P>
One of the groups to sharply criticize the shootings of both Buchanan and 
Tippins was the Urban League of San Diego. Leah Goodwin-Carter, an Urban League 
spokeswoman, said Monday that she will review the report today and that her 
organization will respond. 
</P>
<P>
"We were concerned about the deadly force used in that incident," she said. 
"And we continue to be concerned about the amount of deadly force used." 
</P>
<P>
According to the district attorney, Vega cornered the stolen car in a parking 
lot near the 4900 block of Logan Avenue. The car was driven by the 15-year-old 
Bey. Tippins was sitting in the front passenger seat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drew Service Revolver 
</P>
<P>
Vega drew his service revolver and began approaching the vehicle when "it 
suddenly started up and began backing up directly toward him," the report said. 
Vega stepped back, but the Colt, traveling 12 to 15 miles an hour, eventually 
forced him back "until his buttocks struck the left rear of the patrol car." 
</P>
<P>
To avoid being crushed, Vega moved to his left and backwards again, the report 
said, fired four shots, and the Colt smashed into the patrol car. 
</P>
<P>
"Had I waited one or two more seconds, it would have hit me," Vega later told a 
sergeant about the stolen car. "I didn't know if it was going to follow me. 
Fearing for my life, I fired three or four rounds." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Case in Juvenile Court 
</P>
<P>
Vega was not injured by the car, and Bey was not hit by any of the bullets. Bey 
was charged with auto theft and assault on a peace officer, and the case is 
pending in Juvenile Court. Tippins, who was shot once, was not charged with any 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
The report said officials were unable to contact Tippins or his family, either 
at the hospital or later at home when he was released, and were unable to 
determine his current medical condition. The day after the shooting, a 
detective tried to interview the youth at Mercy Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"Tippins nodded his head and said 'uh, huh,' " the report said. "He then closed 
his eyes and did not respond to further comments." 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses gave conflicting accounts of the shooting. One witness said the 
officer was not in danger, and that he "came across the street and started 
shooting." Another said no warnings were given to Bey before Vega opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
However, Officer Paul Wayne told investigators that both he and Vega yelled for 
the Colt to stop before it hit the police car. Wayne did not fire his weapon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Shootings Justified 
</P>
<P>
In the other police-shooting cases, the district attorney ruled that the 
officers' actions were justified and in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
Officer James Kremer was legally exonerated in the Feb. 21 death of Wayde 
Pratt. According to the report, Pratt grabbed a piece of wood, held it over his 
shoulder "like a baseball bat" and ran at Kremer. The officer fired one shot, 
hit Pratt in the chest and killed him instantly. 
</P>
<P>
In the third case, Officer Alphonso Dobynes wounded Vincent Taylor on May 4. 
While arresting the drug suspect, the officer "lost sight of Taylor's hands" 
and then thought that the man was reaching for a gun in his waistband. Taylor, 
who was unarmed, was shot in the left side.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego City Council voted unanimously Monday to allow Caltrans to start 
working on 78 acres in Mission Trails Regional Park to compensate for 
anticipated damage to the least Bell's vireo habitat from construction of 
California 52. 
</P>
<P>
The council also authorized city staffers to negotiate with users of the 
Hollins Lake Senior Recreation Facility to find a way to avoid closing the 
campground and fishing area. Under plans for construction of the Caltrans 
mitigation site, heavy equipment needed to move earth is to be routed through 
the recreation area, closing it indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
The council directed Caltrans, city officials and park users to return next 
week with a settlement of the issue, which Monday brought elderly protesters to 
City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans, which has offered $1.2 million for the land, wants to begin work on 
the site soon so it can have it prepared for the birds' nesting season this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the highway, from Santo Road in San Diego to California 67 in 
Santee, cannot begin until a nesting ground has been established in the 
mitigation area, said Gary Klein, project studies engineer for Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
The council also voted unanimously to accept an alignment of California 52 
approved by Santee, the San Diego Assn. of Governments and the U. S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service, which would have the least effect on the bird habitat.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SPRING VALLEY

<P>
The body of a woman was found Monday morning in Spring Valley, authorities 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Two area residents found the body, which has not been identified, at the bottom 
of an embankment in the 9400 block of Edgewood Drive, a Sheriff's Department 
spokesman said.

RAPE CONVICTION PRESENTED IN LUCAS' PENALTY PHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The prosecution opened the penalty phase of David Lucas' murder trial Monday 
and then promptly rested after introducing evidence of his 1973 rape 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
No witnesses were called by prosecutors, but the defense put on a daylong 
parade of witnesses to try to persuade the same jury that convicted Lucas of 
three throat-slashing murders to spare his life. 
</P>
<P>
The only choices the San Diego Superior Court jury has is to recommend whether 
Lucas, 34, of Spring Valley should die in the gas chamber or spend the rest of 
his life in prison without the possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. George Clarke introduced the evidence of the 1973 conviction 
for raping a 22-year-old waitress at knifepoint when he was 18 years old. 
</P>
<P>
The defense attorneys and prosecution agreed to a stipulation that Lucas had 
been found guilty on Aug. 16, 1973, of rape. 
</P>
<P>
The defense put on testimony by Lucas' sister and brother, who described their 
father as a cold man who was cruel to Lucas and sometimes hit him. 
</P>
<P>
Many family friends testified, all urging the jury to choose life without 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
Catherine McEvoy, Lucas' sister, pleaded with the jury to spare her brother. 
</P>
<P>
"If you put him to death, we can't write him any more or see him any more. I'm 
pleading. Save him," McEvoy said. She began crying and Superior Court Judge 
Laura Hammes called a recess. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas was convicted June 21 of first-degree murder for killing University of 
San Diego student Anne Swanke, 22, on Nov. 20, 1984, and Suzanne Jacobs, 31, 
and her 3-year-old son, Colin, on May 4, 1979, in their Normal Heights home. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors acquitted Lucas of one murder and deadlocked after voting 11-1 for 
guilty in two other slayings. 
</P>
<P>
He was also convicted of the kidnaping and attempted murder of Jodie Santiago 
Robertson, 34, as she left an El Cajon restaurant June 8, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The trial continues today.

D.A. WARNS RESTAURANT IN PROBE OF HIT-RUN DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura County district attorney's office has warned a restaurant chain 
that it may prosecute the chain's security manager for interfering with the 
investigation of an employee charged with manslaughter after she allegedly got 
drunk at work and drove into a highway laborer. 
</P>
<P>
But an attorney for the firm, Restaurant Enterprises Group of Irvine, said 
security manager Chuck Collins has cooperated fully with the investigation of 
Lyzah Trost, a cook at Reuben's Restaurant on Moorpark Road in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Trost, 29, of Malibu has been charged with one count of felony vehicular 
manslaughter and one count of felony hit-and-run driving in connection with the 
April 5 death of David Ewing, a 27-year-old highway worker. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint against Trost alleges that she consumed "a number of drinks" at 
the restaurant and drove away soon after midnight "despite the protestations" 
of fellow workers that she was too drunk to drive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Closing Off Lanes 
</P>
<P>
Ewing, one of two workers closing off lanes for construction crews on the 
eastbound Ventura Freeway, was run over soon after midnight near Moorpark Road 
by a driver who fled the scene. Trost was arrested the next day after Reuben's 
employees told authorities that she had admitted over the telephone to them 
that she had killed the highway worker. She has since been freed on $10,000 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, who was out of town Monday and could not be 
reached, said in a June 29 letter to Restaurant Enterprises executives that 
Collins "in an apparent concern over corporate liability has lied to 
investigators, manipulated employees and blatantly obstructed the 
investigation" of Trost. He said Collins could be charged with obstructing 
justice, which carries a maximum term of three years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury said his office had to subpoena the telephone numbers and addresses of 
Reuben's employees to interview them because Collins was uncooperative. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Instructions to Employees 
</P>
<P>
He said Collins lied to investigators by telling them that he had provided the 
information to officers from the California Highway Patrol. Bradbury also 
stated that Collins told employees "not to talk with anyone" regarding the 
incident and that at least one employee felt that his job would be in jeopardy 
if he did not follow Collins' instructions. 
</P>
<P>
Robert E. Weiner, an attorney for Restaurant Enterprises, said Collins and 
other company representatives have cooperated fully with Bradbury's staff. He 
said Collins told employees not to discuss the case among themselves or with 
the press, but to cooperate with authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Weiner said the district attorney's investigators have "an ax to grind" with 
Collins. He would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Joe Buckalew said prosecutors will decide whether to charge 
Collins by the end of the month.

hose down the wood-shingle roof of their home to keep the fire from spreading. 
The blaze caused approximately $11,000 in damage to the house in the 16400

BUSINESSMEN PROPOSE TAKEOVER OF TROUBLED L.A. EQUESTRIAN CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of businessmen headed by a semi-retired Burbank banker has offered to 
purchase the lease on the financially troubled Los Angeles Equestrian Center in 
Griffith Park from Gibraltar Savings of Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The banker, Gene Harmon, and officials from Gibraltar said the deal had not 
been completed and they refused to disclose details. But spokesmen for 
Gibraltar said the offer was less than the $10 million Gibraltar was seeking 
for a 50-year lease. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hopeful that the transaction will take place, and I'm even optimistic 
about it, but no deal has been made with them yet," said Dean Harrison, general 
counsel for Gibraltar. "What we have now is a letter of intent. They could walk 
or we could walk." 
</P>
<P>
Even if a deal is worked out, participation by Harmon and his group would have 
to be approved by the Los Angeles Board of Recreation and Parks and the Los 
Angeles City Council. The center was built on Los Angeles city parkland. Most 
of the 73-acre complex is in Los Angeles, although the entrance is in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison said he hopes to have an agreement ironed out in time to present to 
the Recreation and Parks Board at their meeting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$2 Million in Debt 
</P>
<P>
The center has been run by Gibraltar, the center's largest creditor, since 
April, 1988, when Gibraltar foreclosed on J. Albert Garcia, the facility's 
previous operator. The center is more than $2 million in debt. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison has said the center is losing from $80,000 to $100,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon, 60, who said he has been involved in corporate banking for the last 
several years, said he has formed a group called Western Equestrian Centers. 
"We hope to continue it as the finest equestrian center in the United States," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon said he plans to streamline the organization of the center, and that the 
group intends to make capital improvements. "We feel that we'll be able to 
break even in a month or so," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The center has been controversial for several years. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia and his financial backers filed a $200-million lawsuit, still pending, 
against the Los Angeles parks board, the city of Los Angeles and other Los 
Angeles officials, accusing the city of ruining Garcia's plans to make the 
center profitable. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Department of Animal Regulation earlier this year investigated 
the deaths of two ponies during a polo match in March. 
</P>
<P>
Although center officials and polo players were cleared of wrongdoing, 
department officials said at least three injured polo ponies in the past year 
were inhumanely transported from the center to the Wildlife Waystation animal 
preserve in Little Tujunga Canyon, slaughtered and fed to bears, lions and 
tigers.

HILLSIDE GROWTH PLAN SPARKS HOT DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Homeowners, developers and business owners on Monday angrily debated the 
effects of a proposed ordinance which would restrict development on 
Sunland-Tujunga hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
More than 800 people crowded into the Verdugo Hills High School auditorium for 
a public hearing called by the city of Los Angeles on the proposed ordinance, 
which would reduce the density of future residential construction on hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
Many speakers told Charles Rausch, a hearing examiner for the Department of 
City Planning, that the ordinance was essential to preserve the hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
"When I moved here 15 years ago, we had clean air and there was no traffic," 
said Rob Rosen, a broker. "But then the freeway came in and developers pounced 
on this area like vultures. Now the streets are choked and the infrastructure 
can't take it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
But many others said the ordinance would unfairly prevent them from improving 
their properties. "This law has the effect of denying landowners the right to 
build their dream house," said Robert Gordon, who owns 11 lots in the area. 
"This would effectively make our property worthless." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Loye, of the Coalition to Preserve the Foothills, complained that "the 
city is arbitrarily trying to enforce something that will not allow anything to 
be built here." 
</P>
<P>
At issue is an amendment to a community district plan for the 
Sunland-Tujunga-Lake View Terrace-Shadow Hills area, establishing new building 
standards for hillside land. The plan was adopted by the Los Angeles City 
Council in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Arline De Sanctis, chief deputy to Los Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs, 
sponsor of the ordinance, said several hillsides in the Sunland-Tujunga area 
were erroneously zoned for low or very low density. Low density zoning requires 
from 5,000 to 9,000 square feet for each residential lot, and very low density 
requires 11,000 to 20,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
De Sanctis said the area should have been zoned for minimum density, which 
would allow one residence per one to five acres. An acre is 43,560 square feet. 
In extremely mountainous areas, only one lot per 20 acres would be allowed, 
depending on the slope, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The first hearing on the amendment three weeks ago was cut short when the 
audience overflowed the Sunland-Tujunga Municipal Building and Fire Department 
officials declared the building too crowded. 
</P>
<P>
Rausch will present a report to the Planning Commission, which will conduct a 
public hearing and submit recommendations to the City Council, which will make 
the final vote.

NEW PACKAGING, VIGOROUS PROMOTION AND A TV DEAL IS PAYING OFF IN A BIG WAY FOR 
BEACH VOLLEYBALL'S NEW GENERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE HALL, Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jay Hanseth got dinner and a trophy for winning the prestigious Laguna Beach 
Open volleyball tournament in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
"That was pretty good for then," says Jim Menges, who dominated the beach game 
from the mid-1970s through the early 1980s. Menges' payday for winning the 
Hermosa Beach Open with partner Matt Gage in 1980 was yogurt and a pitcher of 
beer. 
</P>
<P>
How things have changed. 
</P>
<P>
Today's "King of the Beach," Sinjin Smith, is well on his way to becoming the 
first millionaire in beach volleyball -- a sport in which prize money for top 
players has increased more than 400% since 1985. Six players won more than 
$100,000 on the tour last season. 
</P>
<P>
That's a lot of frozen yogurt. 
</P>
<P>
Smith and partner Randy Stoklos won $134,185 apiece last summer to top the 
Assn. of Volleyball Professionals money standings. But Smith's growing wealth 
has as much to do with diversity as it does athletic prowess. The winningest 
player in beach volleyball history has a lucrative deal with a clothing 
manufacturer, a coming book and instructional video, and an anticipated part in 
a feature film. 
</P>
<P>
Coming soon is a video game featuring the likenesses of Smith and Stoklos 
called, naturally, "Kings of the Beach." 
</P>
<P>
So how is this portfolio received by the local media when the AVP tour rolls 
into Chicago, Cleveland and Rochester, N.Y. -- cities where the stars of a 
quirky California sport might be expected to have amassed some fame, but 
certainly not a fortune? 
</P>
<P>
Smith laughs. "They just can't believe guys who grew up on the beach, play in 
the sand, get tan and run around with no shirts on can get paid $150,000 or 
$200,000 to do it." 
</P>
<P>
But some do. And things aren't bad on the lower rungs of the money ladder, 
either. After 16 years of playing for trophies and (sometimes) dinner, the game 
has finally begun to pay off for Hanseth, at 36 the elder statesman of 
professional beach volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
Hanseth won $35,002 on the tour last season, good for 12th place in the money 
standings. To earn what many deem a good living, he managed just one 
third-place finish and twice came in fourth, but more often took fifth, 
seventh, ninth, even 13th. 
</P>
<P>
For Menges, who is just two years older than Hanseth but quit the beach game in 
1982, the timing of volleyball's new professionalism was not so fortuitous. 
Menges was there when the money arrived, winning beach volleyball's first two 
World Championship events -- in 1976 with Greg Lee and in 1977 with Chris 
Marlowe -- for a total of $2,500 in prize money. In one five-year stretch, he 
failed to finish third or better in just one tournament, and in that one he was 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"I would never have had to work again," said Menges, who recently entered the 
real estate field in Orange County after years of going from one job to the 
next. "But that's just how things progressed. Now, you get seventh place every 
weekend and make $35,000." 
</P>
<P>
Menges could have added to that sponsorship and endorsement packages from 
beachwear manufacturers that cover a player's travel expenses and sometimes pay 
him a base salary -- contracts that can double or even triple a top player's 
income. 
</P>
<P>
"All I ever got was free trunks," Menges said. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Smith got part ownership of a beachwear company. 
</P>
<P>
It's more than a little symbolic that the guru of beach volleyball can no 
longer be found on the sand courts south of Manhattan Beach pier or north of 
Santa Monica, but instead occupies a law office on the 12th floor of a Century 
City high rise. Leonard Armato, attorney for the likes of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 
and Phoenix Suns guard Kevin Johnson, is credited with taking the game uptown. 
</P>
<P>
And, he says, there's no reason to stop at the city limits. 
</P>
<P>
"Beach volleyball can go as far as just about any sport out there," says 
Armato, the organizer and executive director of the AVP, whose latest coup was 
obtaining nationwide cable television coverage of all 29 tournaments on this 
year's schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"When you keep in mind that volleyball is the second most popular sport in the 
world, you know the beach game will continue to grow by leaps and bounds. It's 
a good spectator sport and, with the exposure it's getting this year on 
television, I think you're going to see it explode." 
</P>
<P>
Armato's enthusiasm for the sport appears to go beyond the standard hype of an 
agent or promoter. A former top-rated volleyball player himself, he graduated 
from Mira Costa High in Manhattan Beach and played on the sand courts at the 
foot of Marine Avenue. The same information can be found in the AVP bios of 
veteran beach stars Mike Dodd and Jon Stevenson, among others. 
</P>
<P>
So it's not surprising that the players came to Armato, 36, six years ago when 
they became dissatisfied with their original promoter, Event Concepts. 
</P>
<P>
Money, at the time, was still new to beach volleyball. According to former 
player Jon Lee, now a volleyball writer and historian, prize money was 
introduced to the game in a manner reminiscent of pro wrestling or 
turn-of-the-century boxing. In the early 1970s, Jim Bartlett, a young publisher 
and entrepreneur with a taste for beach volleyball, decided to make things more 
interesting by placing a "bounty" on the top teams, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
"Each team would enter the tournament with bounties on their heads and, if you 
beat them, you would win the bounty," said Lee, who coaches volleyball at San 
Marcos High in Santa Barbara. "If the team won, they would retain their 
bounty." 
</P>
<P>
But it was Event Concepts that recognized the promotional power of beach 
volleyball and introduced a more sophisticated method of compensating the 
players. In 1976, the firm persuaded a corporate sponsor to put up a $5,000 
purse for the first World Championship tournament and "professional" beach 
volleyball was born. 
</P>
<P>
For eight years Event Concepts promoted the beach tour, expanding corporate 
sponsorship, modestly increasing the prize money and attracting the first cable 
television coverage. But all was not well. The players, Dodd said at the time, 
were "tired of being treated like nets and poles." They wanted more control and 
more money. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Armato. Under the direction of the attorney, the players formed the AVP 
and, thus, became a single bargaining unit, one unified voice. And when Event 
Concepts failed to meet the AVP's demands in the summer of 1984, the players 
went on strike. 
</P>
<P>
The aftermath of the AVP's boycott of the 1984 World Championship tournament in 
Hermosa Beach brought total victory to the players. Event Concepts was out, the 
corporate sponsors were persuaded to stay and the players had control of beach 
volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
"Essentially, (Event Concepts) was doomed from the start," Hanseth said. "They 
saw the potential first; they saw thousands of people (attending tournaments) 
and no money being made, and they brought in the sponsors. But eventually we 
asked, 'What are they really offering us? Why not start a players' union, hire 
our own promoter and give him a salary?' " 
</P>
<P>
According to Armato, the AVP did just that for the next three years, hiring 
another promoter, Group Dynamics Inc., and expanding the tour to 25 events with 
$600,000 in prize money. But after the 1987 season, the players decided to cut 
out the middle man and promote the tour themselves, dealing directly with the 
sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
"The AVP felt it could maximize the visibility of the sponsor and maximize the 
benefit to the players without having the money diluted by a third party," 
Armato said. "And the prize money went from several hundred thousand dollars to 
over a million overnight." 
</P>
<P>
These results -- coupled with the AVP's corporate expansion into areas such as 
merchandising, publishing and concessions -- have increased the players' 
loyalty to Armato and their faith in his leadership, according to Stevenson. 
</P>
<P>
"He's made all the right moves," Stevenson said. "He's made good decisions, 
just about all of them have paid off and we're looking forward to what the 
future may hold." 
</P>
<P>
So is Armato, who predicts that television will allow volleyball to overcome 
the limitations a beach sport might anticipate in a world that is largely 
landlocked. 
</P>
<P>
"Hockey is not as transmittable to television as volleyball is," said Armato, 
who has already introduced the beach game to the shores of Lake Michigan and, 
by bringing truckloads of sand to city parks, to places where there is no beach 
of any kind. "And if television can do what it did for golf -- the most boring 
sport in the history of the world -- imagine what it can do for us." 
</P>
<P>
Jon Stevenson calls them the "thirtysomething guys." Smith, Dodd, Tim Hovland, 
Pat Powers, Steve Obradovich, Hanseth and Stevenson himself. They are all 30 
years old or older and dominate what is still perceived by many as a young 
man's game -- meant to be played by teen-agers during those long summer days 
before they must confront the realities of life. 
</P>
<P>
The "thirtysomething guys" still play, Stevenson says, because they still win. 
"It was just a generation of really good volleyball players," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he allows that their continued presence also has a lot to do with 
perspective. The older players remember when a "career" in beach volleyball 
meant sacrificing other real career opportunities. Some of life's realities 
might not have been so bad, and casting them aside for a game that offered no 
real future seemed unwise. 
</P>
<P>
"People can't believe we're making this kind of money," said Stevenson, 31, 
another $100,000 winner last season. "But for five years, I wasn't making more 
than $10,000 or $20,000. Since college (at UC Santa Barbara), I always 
considered going into the mainstream. I even did my first year of a master's 
program in business. But I stuck with volleyball and it finally paid off." 
</P>
<P>
"You just had to make a decision in life," said Dodd, Stevenson's teammate at 
Mira Costa High who also survived the lean years to become a $100,000 player. 
"If you were a young guy, you would scratch out a living at a job that allowed 
you to go to the beach in the daytime. A lot of people worked in restaurants or 
did real estate." 
</P>
<P>
Those who remain from those days are the lucky ones, Stevenson says. "We're the 
first guys who really made money at it. We're the ones who put our asses on the 
line and went on strike, who gave up all those career opportunities to play 
volleyball. We don't want to give it up yet. We want to go as long as we can." 
</P>
<P>
But has the game changed along with the prize money? 
</P>
<P>
"I think just about everything has changed," Stevenson said. "The only thing 
that hasn't is that you still hit the ball three times." 
</P>
<P>
Though he agrees with Smith, who stresses that "once you step onto the court, 
it's the same game," Stevenson is as wistful for volleyball's past as he is 
enthusiastic about its prosperous present. 
</P>
<P>
"The spirit is just not there any more," he said. "It used to be more tied up 
with the subculture of the beach. It used to be tied in with going to the 
beach, surfing and having fun. Now, people are playing for different reasons. I 
don't think many guys out there are not playing for the money. 
</P>
<P>
"You can tell things have changed just by the conversation amongst the players. 
It used to be, 'Where's the party?' Now, it's about permits for retaining 
walls, remodeling houses, stocks going up or down. It's an entirely different 
set of topics." 
</P>
<P>
The results of the increased money, however, go well beyond court-side 
conversation. "The big difference," Smith says, "is that it's much more 
competitive out there. It used to be, 10 years ago or so, you could skate 
through Saturday's games (before the final rounds Sunday). Now, you can't take 
anyone lightly." 
</P>
<P>
Stevenson agrees. "The depth of competition has really increased," he said. 
"There are about 20 top-quality teams right now. All the way down to the 
40th-ranked teams, you find players who are real serious about making it a 
career. They're doing the little things -- diet, jump-training, lifting weights 
-- to try to improve their game." 
</P>
<P>
And if they make it, the "little things" will include negotiating with sponsors 
over contract clauses, modeling beachwear for photo shoots and catching long 
commercial airline flights. AVP events, sponsored by beer and tequila 
companies, are now held in target marketing regions for those products rather 
than traditional volleyball beaches like Laguna, State (north of Santa Monica) 
and Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the whole transition," Stevenson says. "Guys like Jim Menges and Matt 
Gage were every bit as good as the top players today, and it's amazing they 
could sacrifice as much as they did and get nothing back except personal 
prestige." 
</P>
<P>
For Jon Lee, who played more than 10 years but was never as successful as 
brother Greg, money would have been nice, but the "esprit de corps" of the old 
volleyball circuit may have been worth more. 
</P>
<P>
"There was less material benefit," he said. "It was all pride and position in 
the subculture that motivated you. It was just the respect of your peers and 
love of the sport that you were playing for." 
</P>

CORN BELT HERO REAPS CITY'S GRATITUDE;

WALL STREET INVESTMENT BANKER ADOPTS SMALL IOWA TOWN

FAYETTE, Iowa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's a Bolger Drive in town. A smiling Bolger portrait in City Hall. And, 
unlikely as it seems, a Bolger beach amid the cornfields. 
</P>
<P>
But the name doesn't belong to a founding father or local hero. Bolger wasn't 
born here. He has never even lived here. 
</P>
<P>
So who is he? 
</P>
<P>
In Wall Street circles, David Bolger is a wealthy investment banker. In 
Fayette, Iowa, he's a guardian angel. 
</P>
<P>
"He kind of feels we're his adopted community. And we've adopted him," says 
former Mayor Roy Karlson. 
</P>
<P>
Bolger and some friends and clients have donated to Fayette the ownership of 
part or virtually all of some 20 properties, ranging from a can factory to a 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement has brought Fayette hundreds of thousands of dollars that have 
helped build a new city hall, expand utilities and buy a street sweeper, 
lights, two ambulances and two police cars. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cares for Them 
</P>
<P>
"He really understands a small town in the middle of nowhere has needs," 
Karlson says. 
</P>
<P>
"Fayette exemplifies the best of middle America," the New Jersey financier 
says, by way of explanation. "People are hard-working, relatively quiet and 
reserved. The city is of people and by people. . . . They care for each other." 
</P>
<P>
And he cares for them, through a friendship that belongs in a Frank Capra 
movie: big-time businessman embraces speck-on-the-map town, spreads greenbacks 
and good cheer. 
</P>
<P>
No strings attached. 
</P>
<P>
When Fayette got new Main Street lights, thanks to Bolger, flip-of-the-switch 
honors went to his wife, Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
A sandy fun-in-the-sun spot in corn country? Bolger paid to bulldoze a 
riverbank area, and Bernard "Scorch" Pattison, the grain and feed mill owner, 
hauled white silica sand from his company's underground mine to create a beach 
named after -- guess who? 
</P>
<P>
"He gets a kick out of seeing many things happen because of what he's 
contributed," says Mayor Denny Dumermuth, noting that taxes would have to be 
raised or services cut without Bolger. 
</P>
<P>
Fayette needs help: many streets have potholes, houses are in disrepair. 
</P>
<P>
To Bolger, good deeds are "what my parents taught me to do -- put back in the 
community what you take out." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Adopted Home 
</P>
<P>
Bolger, whose Fayette link goes back 25 years, visits occasionally -- sometimes 
by private jet. He eats at Lucy's Garden of Eatin' cafe, chats with Kenny, the 
hardware store owner, and is on a first-name basis with other shopkeepers. 
</P>
<P>
No corporate pinstripes, no stuffy meetings. Bolger goes fishing or antique 
hunting and sometimes brings back his wife's favorite -- Iowa smoked pork 
chops. 
</P>
<P>
"He works with Wall Street people 350 days a year," explains city attorney 
Charles Hurley. "It's a cutthroat world. He loves to come out here where the 
pace is slower. I think he's doing some good things with his generosity, not 
squandering it on wine, women and song." 
</P>
<P>
Fayette, population 1,500, has made Bolger honorary mayor. His wife is honorary 
police chief. 
</P>
<P>
This spring, Bolger received an award from Upper Iowa University. In the early 
1960s when Bolger worked at a Wall Street securities firm, he arranged 
financing for a dormitory-food service center there. 
</P>
<P>
Years later, the school's lenders called on him when the university was $3 
million in debt. Bolger arranged a refinancing plan, secured loans and canceled 
$1.8 million in long-term mortgages he held on the school. 
</P>
<P>
Starting then, and continuing through the '70s and '80s, Bolger, business 
partners and some clients arranged to donate some 20 commercial properties 
they'd owned and leased to corporations. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the offer created "a lot of suspicion" and liability concerns, 
Karlson says. "Small town, big millionaire. Is this real or not?" 
</P>
<P>
But manna from heaven it was. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he was looking for someone to give a charitable gift to," Karlson 
adds. "Thank God it was us." 
</P>
<P>
This year, Fayette received checks including $247,500 for the sale of a 
Michigan retail store and $30,000 for its share in an Ohio shopping center that 
was sold. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, Fayette owns the land, in others, the building, too. Bolger 
maintains some ownership of all properties, which include an Illinois can 
factory, a Texas cold storage house and several Cleveland supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say giving property to a municipality is a tax savings -- the donor 
deducts the entire fair market value when the gift is given. But the money 
saved is less than if the property is sold and taxes are paid. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows exactly how much money Fayette has received, though Karlson 
estimates that it's more than half a million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
A committee determines how to spend the "Bolger fund," which in mid-June 
totaled $366,000. The council recently approved a committee recommendation to 
use most of the cash for street renovation, for razing an old sewer plant, for 
an ambulance and for a loan to the local development group. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a feeling of responsibility," Hurley says. "We want to put it to good 
use. We want to have a nice town in 50 to 100 years." 
</P>
<P>
Bolger doesn't participate, saying: "I think it's appropriate the community 
decides what they want. Once I get something together, I pull back." 
</P>
<P>
Bolger, however, did provide $140,000 in long-term financing for Blessing 
Industries, a fast-growing metal fabricating firm. 
</P>
<P>
"What he leaves behind to Fayette is something he's been a part of," says 
Blaine Blessing, the firm's owner. "He wants to . . . make it better for the 
people who are here."

'PUTTING A FILM PROTEST IN FOCUS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the continuing flap over George Cunningham's "Animal Attraction," Del Olmo 
criticizes the lack of minority, and particularly Latino, students and faculty 
in prestigious film schools. He suggests that had there been a minority adviser 
guiding Cunningham, that the film might be more sensitive to Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
As a Latino and a film student at UCLA, I support "Animal Attraction" because 
it has something to say not only about American perception and exploitation of 
countries such as Mexico, but also about minority hypersensitivity. At a 
preliminary screening last year, a Latina protester demanded that the film be 
burned. Censorship is a dangerous business, whether it be the destruction of a 
work or the prevention of its creation. 
</P>
<P>
Minority faculty won't necessarily make for more "sensitive" student films 
because at UCLA students have final say as to the content of their work. As a 
Latino film maker, I would have it no other way.

MERGER PLAN FOR SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Weary of "zoning for dollars" -- manipulating land-use controls to compete for 
taxpaying commercial development -- and wary of movements under way to fragment 
government, the city and county of Sacramento are studying a creative plan for 
merging into a consolidated municipality with a population of about 1.3 
million. The plan of the Ad Hoc Charter Commission is a sound one and the city 
and county should be encouraged to approve it and present it to local voters. 
</P>
<P>
The new government would have an 11-member legislative body called the Council 
of Supervisors and a strong independently elected mayor with veto power over 
council decisions. This structure is similar to consolidated county governments 
in a number of states. But the Sacramento government would have a unique 
feature in the creation of 20 local councils with authority to make land-use 
decisions in their areas, consistent with the city's general plan. The 11 
countywide council members would be full-time elected officials. The five 
members of each local council would be elected, but serve on a part-time basis. 
</P>
<P>
Growth management was a major impetus behind the proposed merger charter, 
drafted over the last 10 months. There has been explosive growth along 
Sacramento's northern and eastern borders and the wealthy unincorporated suburb 
of Citrus Heights had launched a cityhood campaign. Charter Commission 
officials say both the city and county were tired of competing for business and 
commercial development that would generate new tax dollars -- a pattern that 
creates haphazard development throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The most controversial feature of the proposed charter is the strong mayor. One 
City Council member said that was too much power for a single official. But the 
office would be no more powerful than mayoralties in most large cities in 
California and county executive positions elsewhere. The mayor's vetoes could 
be overridden by the council. The greater danger would be a collective 
executive, or one who was too weak. 
</P>
<P>
The charter commission will conduct public hearings on the proposal this summer 
and go to the City Council and Board of Supervisors in the fall for a decision 
to put the plan before voters in 1990. Approval of the state Legislature also 
is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The city-county decision to explore a merger was, in a sense, a defensive 
action. But it also is a bold step forward that other cities and counties in 
California should watch with interest.

Del Olmo states that he was "at first reluctant to weigh in on the side of the 
many Latinos who are angry about a recent UCLA film." He also goes on to state 
that as long as the Latinos activists stick to the issue, he is with us. 
</P>
<P>
What a gutless wimp. This is a film that insults him and our people and he is 
worried about some moron's right of freedom of speech. Any real man when 
insulted gets fighting mad but apparently Del Olmo has to think about it. Who 
needs him. 
</P>
<P>
Thank God we had some Chicanas at UCLA who protested against the film.

NO QUALITY OF MERCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is possible that Cuban Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez will be spared from a 
firing squad by the his old friend and leader, Fidel Castro, but it would be 
out of character for the Cuban dictator. Castro has decided that his island's 
future lies in the most rigid and unforgiving Stalinist Communism, including 
purges and show trials for those unfortunate apparatchiks who stray from the 
party line. 
</P>
<P>
Straying from the line may well be what doomed Ochoa and three other Cuban army 
officers who were convicted in televised trials last week of smuggling drugs 
and other crimes. In publicly admitting that high-level government officials 
were involved in drug smuggling, the Castro regime contradicts a long-standing 
denial of drug shipments through Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
Few ever believed that, and some of his fiercest critics, including officials 
in the U.S. government, are convinced not only that Cuban officials are 
involved in drug trade, but that Castro himself has a hand in it. There is no 
real evidence that Castro is directly involved, but it strains credulity that 
high-ranking Cuban military officers could engage in illegal activities without 
the jefe maximo of that tightly controlled island knowing something about it. 
So there must be more to this case than a sudden decision by Castro to punish 
drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
The Ochoa trial may be as much political as criminal. Ochoa is not just any 
general. He is a veteran of the Cuban revolution and commanded troops for 
Castro in Ethiopia, Angola and Nicaragua. Ochoa may have been Cuba's most 
popular man in uniform next to Castro. And that may have been why Castro and 
his heir-apparent, brother Raul Castro, saw Ochoa as a threat. 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa was educated in the Soviet Union, and has close ties there. He was one of 
the few Cubans with enough prestige and power to disagree with Castro on the 
merits of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms and the need for 
similar experiments in Cuba. Castro has made it very clear he wants no 
perestroika and glasnost on his island, and putting a popular and respected 
leader like Ochoa up against the wall may be one way of reminding everybody in 
Cuba who's in charge. That's the way Josef Stalin did it during the darkest 
days of Soviet history.

CHILLING A QUARTER CENTURY OF CIVIL-RIGHTS PROGRESS IS NO MERE TECHNICALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AUGUSTUS F. HAWKINS, Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Los Angeles) is chairman of 
the House Education and Labor Committee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty-five years ago I was a freshman member of Congress learning the ropes 
after an earlier career as a California assemblyman. I was involved in the 
House debate on the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and as the first black 
representative elected from the West, I was keenly interested in the direction 
of this debate. 
</P>
<P>
I will never forget the hours of harsh discussion in committee and on the House 
floor, and the parliamentary maneuvers used by opponents to bottle up the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Senate finagling was even worse, with a 75-day filibuster and the introduction 
of 119 weakening amendments. 
</P>
<P>
It was the shock of President John F. Kennedy's assassination that provided the 
catalyst we needed to force congressional action. 
</P>
<P>
We have just celebrated the 25th anniversary of the signing of the landmark 
Civil Rights Act of 1964, which guarantees the rights of equal access to 
employment, education, public facilities, housing and public accommodations to 
all Americans, regardless of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. 
</P>
<P>
In light of the commemoration, I find myself reflecting on the monumental 
struggles we as a country have endured. 
</P>
<P>
When I was born in Shreveport, La., in the first decade of this century, 
virtually every aspect of my family's life, from employment, to housing, to use 
of public places was restricted by segregation. Because of this, my father 
packed up my mother, my sister, brothers and me and moved the family to Los 
Angeles. Here we hoped to escape the grip of legally mandated racial 
discrimination and improve our educational prospects. 
</P>
<P>
While the ruthlessness and ugliness of segregation was most apparent in the 
South, various degrees of discrimination were in existence throughout the our 
country, including, unfortunately, California. It took lynchings, riots, two 
world wars and years of massive civil disobedience and millions of individual 
acts of courage to bring us to the 1960s. Only when the national political, 
economic and social agenda merged did we produce the final push needed to enact 
legislation to abolish the vestiges of legal segregation. 
</P>
<P>
The last 25 years have seen many improvements in the practical implementation 
of equal opportunity in education, employment, housing and public 
accommodations and facilities. But fine-tuning continues to be needed. Under 
both Republican and Democratic administrations, we have clarified the intent 
and strengthened the enforcement mechanisms of equal- opportunity law. Case law 
over most of the last 25 years also has strengthened the law. 
</P>
<P>
How ironic it is, then, that within days of the 25-year celebration of this 
watershed law, the Supreme Court handed down devastating decisions that rock 
the very foundation of the guarantee of civil rights in this country. Yet 
President Bush dismissed these decisions as "technical subjects -- we're 
talking burdens of proof and statutes of limitations." 
</P>
<P>
While guarantees to equal opportunity to a job, quality education and business 
development may be interesting breakfast conversation to our Chief Executive, 
they are a matter of basic economic survival to millions of Americans. Burdens 
of proof and statutes of limitations are the important legal means minorities, 
women, senior citizens and others have used in our legal system to make the 
legislative promise of human equality a practical reality. 
</P>
<P>
We must not accept the status quo when it comes to these very fundamental 
tenets of our entire democratic system. We must affirmatively move to ensure 
equal opportunity and review possible legislative remedies. 
</P>
<P>
As President Lyndon B. Johnson said of civil rights in 1964: ". . . this not 
merely an economic issue -- or a social, political or international issue. It 
is a moral issue." 
</P>
<P>
Blatant and concealed discrimination unfortunately continue to survive in 1989 
America, despite the great strides we have made. We have not yet completed our 
journey to a color-blind society. As my father acted more than 70 years ago to 
provide an atmosphere of equal opportunity for his family, so too must we act 
today to guarantee civil-rights protections for our future generations.

IN SOVIET STRATEGY, POWER STILL COUNTS

<P>
Four years after Mikhail S. Gorbachev began transforming Soviet foreign policy, 
a clear picture of his grand strategy is finally emerging. 
</P>
<P>
Much of it is comforting to the West and represents a victory for America's 
postwar containment of Soviet power. Most important, Gorbachev has recognized 
that nuclear competition has yielded the Soviets more risks than results and he 
has joined U.S. efforts to eliminate the threat of nuclear war. But Moscow also 
is mounting challenges in areas of strategic importance to the West that the 
United States is ill-prepared to counter. 
</P>
<P>
Judging by his actions, the Soviet president has divided the world into three 
broad spheres of policy. Beyond the periphery of the Soviet Union, he has been 
ending involvements that either proved unprofitable or that brought marginal 
gains -- in strategic terms, he is shortening his lines of action. Two 
developments stand out. In Africa, Gorbachev has supported U.S. efforts to 
secure independence for Namibia, to remove Cuban troops from Angola and to move 
the Angolan civil war to the bargaining table. In Central America, he has 
announced a halt to military aid to Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
In both cases, Gorbachev has gained something in return. In Africa, Moscow has 
an improved image. In Central America, the Soviets have increased confidence 
that the Sandinistas will remain in power now that President Bush's agreement 
with Congress has acknowledged the failure of the Contras. In both places, 
Moscow is reducing the drain on its resources caused by unproductive Cuban 
adventures. Gorbachev also must have recognized that Soviet communism has lost 
its appeal virtually everywhere. Indeed, Moscow is more likely to increase its 
influence in Third World countries by embracing a Western liberal agenda than 
by continuing to play a visible role as spoiler -- while it retains both 
considerable capacity to project naval power and key bases in countries like 
Cuba and Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the United States benefits from any Soviet retreat from distant 
regions. But the West's gains must be kept in perspective. In many areas, the 
United States has exaggerated the significance of the Soviet challenge. Even 
without Moscow's involvement in the Third World, Washington would still face 
staggering difficulties, especially in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
Far more important in judging the future of East-West relations will be what 
happens in regions close to Soviet borders. Here, Gorbachev has drawn up two 
spheres -- the stable and the unstable. In Europe, Gorbachev has recognized 
that the Soviet Union has more to gain by formally recognizing that neither 
side can prevail in war than by trying, through massive military deployments, 
to intimidate the West and to separate the United States from the Continent. It 
is not for nothing that he is the most popular political figure in Western 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Again, the West also profits from Gorbachev's diplomacy. Only leaders who lack 
vision or self-confidence can mourn the reduction of military threat to Western 
Europe. If and when a more temperate Soviet Union becomes commonplace, it will 
be required to compete in terms of economic and political life, where it has 
little to offer. China offers a different example. Moscow has ratified several 
years of stable relations with Beijing by abandoning the albatross of direct 
military engagement in Afghanistan, thinning out forces in Mongolia and 
disciplining Vietnam in Cambodia. Thus Gorbachev has reduced, if not 
eliminated, the U.S. strategic advantage -- the China card -- that derived from 
the renewal of Sino-American relations. This act of competing with the United 
States is less serious than it might have been a decade ago. For some time, 
U.S. ties to China have been important more because of developments within the 
region -- and thus worthy of preserving, even after recent events -- than 
because of a three-cornered great-power game. 
</P>
<P>
This comparison of relative benefits does not apply to basically unstable areas 
close to the Soviet Union that are more in contention between the superpowers 
than China. The Soviet Union has been vigorously seeking primacy in southwest 
Asia. In Afghanistan, it is bent on winning through knowledge, craft, diplomacy 
and patience what military involvement did not avail. And in the past few 
weeks, the Soviets have come closer to realizing their ambitions in Iran -- 
critical to Afghanistan, the Persian Gulf, Western oil supplies and the Indian 
subcontinent -- than at any other time since the Great Game in the region 
between Russia and the West began two centuries ago. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the Bush Administration has reacted with more bewilderment than 
insight. The Administration clucked that arms sales to Iran would not be 
consistent with joining what the President has called the global 
"neighborhood," and it seemed surprised that Gorbachev sent condolences when 
the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini died. 
</P>
<P>
It may be understandable that a young Administration has not yet marshaled the 
resources to match the Soviets in Afghanistan or surmounted domestic political 
inhibitions against competing in Iran. But it must realize the consequences of 
failure to master all parts of Gorbachev's grand strategy -- the negative as 
well as the positive. The President and his team must learn to compete and 
cooperate with the Soviet Union at different places at the same time, and they 
must explain this dichotomy to the American people. At best, the alternative 
will be dashed expectations -- which a decade ago killed detente -- when it 
becomes clear that the Soviets have not abandoned the pursuit of power.

O'CONNOR SEEKS A PEACE THAT ISN'T THERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

In the aftermath of the abortion decision, when the Supreme Court opinions had 
deteriorated into talk-show shouting matches, I began to have a strange feeling 
that I had missed something. Or someone. Where was Sandra Day O'Connor in all 
this? 
</P>
<P>
For months, it was widely assumed that the lone female justice on the bench 
would be pivotal in the Webster case. More than one brief was written directly 
to her ambivalence. More than one argument was pitched on her wavelength. 
</P>
<P>
In the final count, she was indeed a formidable fifth. She went with one 
majority in favor of restrictive regulations against abortion. She went with 
another majority that refrained from overturning Roe vs. Wade. But if her vote 
was powerful, her voice could barely be heard. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Blackmun wrote a stunning, emotional opinion that he read from the bench. 
Silent Sandra wrote a dry, highly specific, unmemorable, unquotable opinion, 
and then skipped court the day the case was handed down. 
</P>
<P>
What happened to the one soprano in the chorus of eight baritones? The only 
justice who had ever actually been pregnant? It is entirely possible that 
O'Connor went low-key on the abortion decision precisely because she is the 
only woman. Any "only woman" knows what it's like to be in the room when a 
"woman's issue" comes up and every man turns to her. If she took a step back, 
if she deliberately chose to opt out of this high-decibel exchange, there is a 
lot of precedent for that. 
</P>
<P>
But when I went back to search for the shade of O'Connor, and reread the 
opinion, I found another odd and perhaps highly female caste to it. O'Connor 
comes across in this opinion as the court's mediating figure, in search of the 
middle. She is the justice of the peace, trying to reduce conflict between her 
colleagues and, perhaps, the opposing forces in the country. Even when it means 
denying conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Does this remind you of anyone you know? Mom, perhaps? 
</P>
<P>
The Webster case came at the end of a remarkably contentious session. If the 
justices are ever to have a cup of coffee together, they may need a mediator. 
Justice O'Connor begins as if she is talking directly to her warring 
colleagues. Says Harvard Law School's Martha Minow: "She uses every possible 
gesture to say, 'Hey, you guys don't really disagree,' and 'Hey, there really 
isn't a problem here.' " 
</P>
<P>
Non-problem 1: The preamble to the Missouri law states that life begins at 
conception. But O'Connor agreed to uphold this piece of the law because, she 
said, it's "too hypothetical" to have any real-life effect. No conflict, no 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Non-problem 2:. The state of Missouri requires doctors to perform tests on 
20-week-old fetuses to prove their viability. But O'Connor said the state 
didn't really mean that doctors should do such tests if they were unnecessary. 
No conflict. No problem. 
</P>
<P>
Non-problem 3: What about using this case to overturn Roe? O'Connor said that 
the Webster decision didn't actually, really, truly, absolutely challenge Roe. 
No conflict and no problem. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Antonin Scalia, no slouch in the confrontation department, countered 
with two full pages calling O'Connor a hypocrite. He said that her efforts to 
write away conflict between the court rulings of 1973 and those of 1989 "cannot 
be taken seriously." (Dear Antonin, there must be another way to put that. 
Can't a woman ever be taken seriously, even on the Supreme Court?) 
</P>
<P>
I would hate O'Connor to drop her conciliatory role and join the anti-abortion 
quartet. But the tone that infuses this and other O'Connor decisions raises 
some interesting questions about women and judgments -- in and out of the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
Many who talk about the need for a "female" perspective in law or government or 
business value women as peacemakers, mediators, compromisers. It is women who 
frequently translate their children -- uh, colleagues -- to each other. 
</P>
<P>
But there can be a downside to this value. It's the other model of mom standing 
over the fighting kids, insisting, "I don't care who's right, I just want peace 
and quiet." Prof. Minow describes this downside as "a reluctance to face up to 
conflicts that are there, to use a strategy of avoidance. And it's a failure to 
state in clear and certain terms the large governing principles for the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
In a series of decisions, Justice O'Connor has tried to stake out common 
ground, a valuable piece of turf in this society. But you can't always find it. 
And you can't always create it. 
</P>
<P>
On the statues that grace our courtrooms, the image of Justice is a woman. But 
not necessarily a mom.

MORNING BRIEFING: THE DAY BEFORE DYING, FATHER HELPED SON CURE BASEBALL WOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The year 1983 was a traumatic one for Steve Sax, the Dodger second baseman who 
suddenly couldn't throw straight. It was the worst fielding slump of his 
career, and in the midst of it, his father died of a heart attack in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Sax, now an All-Star with the New York Yankees, told Michael Martinez of the 
New York Times: "We talked on the phone the night before he died. He told me, 
'One day, you'll wake up and this whole thing will be gone. I did the same 
thing when I was in high school.' And he was right. One day, I got up and it 
was all over. 
</P>
<P>
"But about two years later, I was talking to my mom about it, and she said, 
'You know, your dad never had that problem. He was just trying to help you get 
out of it.' At the shame of his own pride, he told me that to help me get out 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
Add Martinez: While conceding that former Yankee Willie Randolph has helped the 
Dodgers become the National League leader in double plays, he noted that the 
Yankees, with Sax, have recorded six more double plays than the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Fairy tales?: From Joe Strauss of the Atlanta Journal and Constitution: "Some 
former teammates are beginning to publicly question the mean-street accounts of 
his childhood given by Kevin Mitchell. Mitchell speaks freely of his gang 
involvement growing up in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"New York Mets pitcher Ron Darling called Mitchell a pathological liar. Wally 
Backman, when he was with the Mets, once told him, 'Mitch, if you got shot as 
many times as you say, you'd look like a Chinese checkerboard.' 
</P>
<P>
"Mitchell has long maintained that he was a high school football star for three 
different high schools. The San Francisco Chronicle recently ran a story in 
which it was reported he never played for two of the three schools." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What do Jim Finks and Nancy Lopez have in common? 
</P>
<P>
Giant intellects: Hall of Fame fullback Jim Brown, at a Browns-NFL Alumni 
charity golf tournament in Cleveland, said he has completed a new book titled 
"Out of Bounds" that will be out in September. 
</P>
<P>
"It starts out in Yankee Stadium," Brown told the Cleveland Plain Dealer. "Yes, 
Sam Huff is in the book. I'll say this, Sam was as smart as anybody who played 
the game. His New York Giants were 50% brighter than anyone else. They were big 
and tough but also smart." 
</P>
<P>
Add Brown: Said Cleveland receiver Brian Brennan, admittedly awed after getting 
his first up-close look at Brown: "I wanted to go up and introduce myself, but 
he just looked too intimidating." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing to it: From Bob Ford of the Philadelphia Inquirer: "Dr. Norman Scott 
said the arthroscopic surgery on Patrick Ewing's knee was minor. 'Take a turkey 
leg, break it open and then gouge out the white, shiny stuff with a fork. 
Basically, that's what Patrick had,' Scott said." 
</P>
<P>
Ford: "It is not known if the knee was then stuffed and baked at 350 degrees 
for three hours." 
</P>
<P>
Add surgery: Bill Walton once said, "I learned a long time ago that minor 
surgery is when they do the operation on someone else, not you." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: They both went to the University of Tulsa. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Baltimore pitcher Dave Schmidt, asked about the pressure of leading 
the American League East: "How tough is it to be in first place? How tough is 
it to be in last, 80 games out, like last year? That's a better question."

Delta Forms ESOP: Delta Air Lines took steps to place nearly 20% of its stock 
in friendly hands, in what appeared to be a corporate takeover defense. The 
Atlanta-based airline said a newly formed employee stock ownership plan would 
control 14% of its shares and that Swissair, a foreign airline, would acquire 
5%. At the same time, Delta said it would acquire 5% of Swissair, and 
repurchase 19% of its own shares on the open market. In March, Delta and 
Swissair formed a marketing alliance.

T-Bill Rates Fall Again: The treasury sold $6.6 billion of new three-month 
bills at an average discount rate of 7.76%, down from 7.96% last week. Another 
$6.6 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount rate of 
7.50% down from 7.63% last week. The rates were the lowest since three-month 
bills sold for 7.54% last Nov. 7 and six-month bills averaged 7.48% last Oct. 
31. The discount rates understate the actual return to investors -- 8.03% for 
three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,620.80. The discount rate 
reflects the price discount received when government securities are purchased 
at less than face value.

On-Time Performance by Airlines Fell: The on-time performance of the 13 major 
U.S. airlines fell in May to 79.5% of flights operated from 83.4% in April, the 
Transportation Department said. The department's monthly Air Travel Consumer 
Report said America West Airlines led with an on-time record of 91.7% and 
Eastern Airlines was second at 87.2%. Pan American World Airways was at the 
bottom of the list, with 69.6% of its flights on time. A flight is considered 
on time if it operates within 15 minutes of schedule, not counting mechanical 
problems.

Home Prices Still Rising: Despite a slowing economy, there is no end in sight 
for California's skyrocketing home prices, according to a Bank of America 
report. The median price of a single-family home in the state is expected to 
rise 24% this year to $205,000, compared to $165,602 in 1988, according to the 
bank's report. In Orange County and San Francisco, the median home price will 
break the $300,000 mark by the end of next year, and in Los Angeles it will top 
$250,000, according to the report. A slower economy and higher interest rates 
will cool the demand for housing somewhat in 1990, but the median price will 
still rise 7% to $220,000, the report said.

Marcus Schloss Guilty of Fraud: Marcus Schloss &amp; Co. was found guilty of 
buying American Brands Inc. stock based on non-public tips -- marking the first 
time a New York Stock Exchange specialist firm has been convicted of insider 
trading. However, D. Ronald Yagoda, the former head of Marcus Schloss' 
arbitrage department, was acquitted for his alleged role in the scheme. A 
Schloss spokesman said the verdict would be appealed. The charges grew out of 
the 1986 "Yuppie Five" insider trading case involving five young professionals 
all under the age of 30. The defendants in that case all pleaded guilty to 
insider trading.

PEOPLE: CONTROL DATA OFFICER STARTING OWN FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carl Ledbetter, former president and chief executive of the Control Data Corp. 
supercomputer subsidiary that was closed in April, has left Control Data to 
form another company. 
</P>
<P>
Ledbetter, who headed ETA Systems in St. Paul, Minn., said he briefly explored 
the possibility of purchasing ETA's assets from Control Data. But he and former 
ETA executive Al Moschner decided to start a new Twin Cities company, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The new company will make special-purpose, high-performance computers, 
Ledbetter said, adding that its product line will not resemble a 
general-purpose supercomputer, which was the ETA product. 
</P>
<P>
Ledbetter, who presided over Control Data's effort to challenge 
Minneapolis-based Cray Research in the world supercomputer market, was removed 
from the helm of ETA last October in a restructuring that folded ETA into the 
parent company. 
</P>
<P>
He was reinstated at ETA in February, when Control Data reversed its earlier 
plan. That prompted speculation that ETA was for sale or seeking an investor 
and that Ledbetter was a key ingredient in that strategy. ETA was closed after 
losses of more than $100 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
While ETA fell victim to its own technological delays and to Control Data's 
worsening financial problems, Ledbetter became well-known in the supercomputer 
industry and was credited with having fought an uphill battle to make ETA a 
competitor.

It may not be the challenge of the century, but Peter Churm has thrown down the 
gauntlet: As chairman of Fluorocarbon Inc. in Laguna Niguel, he is daring the 
public to engage its imagination and come up with a new moniker to replace his 
company's nettlesome name. 
</P>
<P>
The deadline: Aug. 31. The reward: 100 shares of company stock, valued at 
around $14 per share. 
</P>
<P>
OK, so it's not a million dollars, but Churm's already gotten some 70 
suggestions since the company's annual meeting on June 6, when he announced 
that Fluorocarbon was planning a name change. 
</P>
<P>
"They come in on scraps of paper, in formal letters, by fax," Churm said 
Monday, the contest's first official day. "A lot of them involve the word 
polymer. Some involve the word Teflon. Others involve taking our name and 
breaking it into initials. Some are really off the wall." 
</P>
<P>
Polymer? Teflon? How snappy an appellation can you dream up for a company 
that's spent some three decades fashioning fixtures from fluorocarbon, the main 
ingredient in Teflon? Churm is well aware of the difficulties of the task 
ahead, but it's worth it, he says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Business Lost 
</P>
<P>
Fluorocarbon has been beset with an image problem caused by its not-so-harmless 
handle. To Churm, the name sounds too much like chlorofluorocarbons -- the 
gases that are blamed for burning holes in the Earth's ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
While the company has lost no business because of its name, Churm said that in 
the past six months he has been told by several stockbrokers that they will no 
longer pitch his stock to clients. 
</P>
<P>
These brokers contend that it takes too much effort to explain to prospective 
shareholders that fluorocarbons are harmless solids, not destructive gases, and 
that Fluorocarbon is a good company, not a bad guy, Churm said. Hence the name 
change. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had our preference we would like to have a name that more closely 
describes what we do," Churm said. "We make industrial components . . . that go 
into other peoples' machinery." 
</P>
<P>
Now, let's face it, you can't call the company Industrial Components, he says, 
because it's so long and clumsy. But he's not willing to give up on the idea of 
a name that describes what the company makes. 
</P>
<P>
"Industrial components out of high performance polymers, plastic and rubber," 
Churm said with a sigh. "All those are big words. We have to boil all that big 
wordage into something snappy and short and eye-catching. You see why we're 
having a contest?" 
</P>
<P>
Well, yes.

RTD FUELS UP FOR NEW HAPPY RIDER ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lots of people like to gripe about the RTD. But if you happen to be a fan of 
the Southern California Rapid Transit District, here's your chance to appear in 
one of their advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
For several months, RTD has been running an ad campaign, "Your Neighborhood 
Bus," which features various riders who praise the city's public transportation 
system. Now, the Los Angeles ad firm that created that campaign, Pool/Sarraille 
Advertising, is about to begin hunting up people for yet another batch of 
riders-who-love-RTD ads. 
</P>
<P>
Where do they look for the stars of their ads? Many of the people who appear in 
the current campaign were suggested by bus drivers or by RTD board members. 
Also, some RTD staff members randomly interviewed RTD passengers for the 
king-sized bus sideboards, billboards and print ads. And Anthony Fortuno, 
marketing director at the RTD, said people can call to volunteer if they're 
interested. 
</P>
<P>
But aside from the publicity, there's not much in it for those featured in the 
ads. "We didn't pay them any money," said Fortuno. But RTD did give each of 
them several months' worth of bus passes. Those are worth about $42 apiece.

BRUCE HOROVITZ: HYBRID FIRM HELPS SIMPLIFY AD WORLD BY 'PACKAGING' DIRECTORS, 
STARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mariel Hemingway isn't too keen on appearing in commercials. When she was a 
teen-ager, she flaunted her high cheekbones in a Noxema skin cream ad. And four 
years ago, she cooed over coffee in commercial for Maxwell House. But since 
then, the actress has been routinely turning down commercial offers. 
</P>
<P>
Then, six months ago, she got a call from Chaos Ltd. Despite what its name 
might suggest, Chaos attempts to bring some order to the world of advertising. 
The 9-month-old Pasadena company links celebrities with top-name directors and 
"packages" commercials for major advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
"I could go sponsor some product and look really silly doing it," said 
Hemingway in a telephone interview from her home in Ketchum, Ida. "But here's 
this company that comes along and looks out for the talent that's behind the 
ad. I don't know of anyone else doing that." 
</P>
<P>
Chaos placed Hemingway, granddaughter of writer Ernest Hemingway, in a 
celebrity-filled TV commercial for Revlon that aired during this year's Academy 
Awards. Besides Hemingway, Chaos signed up 26 other celebrities -- from Grace 
Jones to Joan Rivers -- to appear in these Revlon ads. In one ad, which poses 
the question, "What makes a woman unforgettable?" Hemingway responds, "Great 
cheekbones." Besides the celebrities in the Revlon ads, Chaos also brought in 
the director of the hit film "Big," Penny Marshall, to direct the commercials. 
</P>
<P>
What exactly is Chaos? Well, it is not an ad agency, a casting agency or a 
production company. But it combines elements of all three. Unlike agencies, 
however, which strictly represent the advertisers, Chaos is a middleman of 
sorts that represents -- and brings together -- directors and commercial stars. 
</P>
<P>
Chaos is a division of the New York production company Independent Artists. The 
company is run by a husband-and-wife team, Elvier and Stephen Diehl, two former 
fashion models who met in Europe. "We can put anything together," said Elvier 
Diehl, who began to establish contacts with top rock stars when she booked 
concert tours in London years ago and more recently helped produce music 
videos. "When ad agencies call us with requests," she said, "they'll know 
within 24 hours if the talent they want is available and how much it will 
cost." 
</P>
<P>
But besides matching celebrities with top directors, they must also constantly 
massage over-sized egos along the way. "Our main concern is that the talent and 
directors are happy," said Stephen Diehl. "If they're not happy, no one is." 
</P>
<P>
The company matched rock star George Michael with the director of the film 
"Dangerous Liaisons" for a recent Diet Coke commercial. But the ad, which 
intermixes scenes of Michael in concert along with flashes of a matador in a 
bullring, did not come together easily. 
</P>
<P>
"George Michael had to be sold on the director," said Stephen Diehl. So 
Stephen's wife, Elvier -- who had known the rock star since he was a singer in 
the group Wham! -- flew to London to introduce him to director Stephen Frears. 
She even arranged a private screening for Michael of "Dangerous Liaisons." 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, Chaos brought together Bill Cosby and jazz singer Betty Carter 
in a yet-to-be aired TV commercial for Coke. And when Cosby requested a black 
director, Chaos brought in Mustapha Khan, best-known for directing several 
Levi's 501 jeans ads. 
</P>
<P>
For years, a number of companies in the film and television industry have 
linked stars with top directors and then "sold" these packages to production 
studios. But until very recently, this has been generally unheard of in the 
advertising business. Just as the style of many commercials tends to mimic what 
appears on the screen, the advertising industry is now beginning to copy the 
way the TV moguls and film makers do business. 
</P>
<P>
Not that several other companies aren't doing something similar. The New York 
company Rockbill, which matches singing stars with advertisers, played a role 
in bringing Michael Jackson together with Pepsi several years ago. And the Los 
Angeles production company Propaganda Films helped develop a package that 
placed singer Sheena Easton in both music videos and advertisements for Holiday 
Health Spas. But few companies specialize in digging up top celebrities and 
directors then handing them to advertisers on a silver platter. 
</P>
<P>
"This may be the start of a trend," said Gerald McGee, managing director of the 
Los Angeles office of the ad firm, Ogilvy &amp; Mather. "They're sort of agents 
with a twist -- a twist of creativity." 
</P>
<P>
That creativity does come at a price. Some agencies have paid Chaos six-digit 
figures to pull together commercial packages that feature top name singers and 
big name directors. And that, of course, is separate from the 
multimillion-dollar fees commanded by superstars themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"That's probably the one big negative in this whole thing," said Ogilvy's 
McGee, whose agency has yet to work with any commercial matchmakers. "It could 
get very, very expensive." 
</P>
<P>
That didn't stop New York ad agency BBDO and its client, Pepsi, from turning to 
Chaos earlier this year. Chaos put together a package for a commercial that not 
only included singer Robert Palmer but also the director of his music video, 
Terence Donovan. 
</P>
<P>
"They are uncompromising in their dedication to get you top talent," said Tony 
Frere, vice president and executive producer at BBDO. "It's the only service of 
its kind that I know of. They're sort of a directory to hipness." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ogilvy &amp; Mather on a Roll With Hilton 
</P>
<P>
Ogilvy &amp; Mather has hit the jackpot -- for the second time. The agency's 
Los Angeles office last week won the estimated $2-million business for Reno's 
Flamingo Hilton. Ogilvy already handles advertising for the Las Vegas Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Ogilvy's Los Angeles and Hawaii offices jointly won the 
estimated $4-million ad business for Pan Pacific Hotels &amp; Resorts, a chain 
of 18 Pacific Rim hotels that operates the Emerald of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
With two of Hilton's biggest hotels in its hip pocket, is Ogilvy hoping to 
eventually pick up even bigger chunks of the huge Hilton ad business? "I 
suppose you could look at it that way," said Gerald McGee, managing director of 
Ogilvy's Los Angeles office. "Any job done well runs the chance of being 
successful on a larger scale." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Abert Newhoff &amp; Burr Buys High-Tech Shop 
</P>
<P>
What do you do when you're an agency that creates ads for all kinds of consumer 
products but you also want to latch on to some high-tech clients? 
</P>
<P>
Well, if you're Abert Newhoff &amp; Burr, you go out and buy the small, 
high-tech ad firm Brantley &amp; Pawluk. With that purchase -- for an 
undisclosed amount -- the Los Angeles ad firm picked up, among other clients, 
the Seattle software publisher, Microrim Inc. The agency also named Hal Pawluk 
senior vice president. Pawluk helped create the first four years of ads for the 
software firm Ashton-Tate. 
</P>
<P>
Mel Newhoff said his agency, which creates ads for Yamaha Motor Corp., plans to 
purchase yet another small ad firm soon. "We intend to continue the trend and 
maybe we'll own Warner Bros., Paramount and Time Inc. by the year 2050," he 
said. "We could call ourselves Omniglom, except that it sounds like an oil 
spill." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In-N-Out Cooks Up Agency Review Plan 
</P>
<P>
In-N-Out Burger is looking in-n-out for a new advertising agency. Last week, 
the Baldwin Park hamburger chain placed its estimated $4-million ad business up 
for review. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Los Angeles agency Gumpertz/Bentley/Fried is still in the running, 
said Susan Grear, director of advertising at In-N-Out. She said the review is 
something the chain intends to do every three years -- regardless of which 
agency wins its business. 
</P>
<P>
And for those who are kind of stuck on the chain's familiar theme song -- 
"In-N-Out, that's what hamburgers are all about" -- fear not. Said Grear: 
"That's not going to change."

HOME FEDERAL SUES AGENCY OVER SHIFT TO FDIC SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Home Federal Savings &amp; Loan sued the Federal Home Loan Bank Board on Monday 
in an attempt to force the regulator to allow Home Federal to escape from the 
ailing Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego-based Home Federal, which is seeking to become a California-licensed 
commercial bank, wants to join the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and believes 
that it is exempt from a federal moratorium on such conversions because it 
filed its applications before the ban. 
</P>
<P>
"The bank board believes it has the authority to determine if an institution 
can exit the FSLIC in connection with converting from an S&amp;L to a bank," 
said Kim Fletcher, chairman and chief executive of Home Federal. "We believe 
the bank board has exceeded its jurisdiction because there is no statutory 
basis for such regulation. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a responsibility to our shareholders to take necessary steps to 
complete this conversion -- even if that means taking our regulator to court," 
Fletcher said. 
</P>
<P>
A bank board spokesman declined to comment on the suit, adding that the agency 
had not seen the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
The bank board has been anxious to keep healthy institutions like Home Federal 
within the FSLIC system, which is insolvent. Both the FSLIC and the FDIC 
systems protect deposits up to $100,000, but FSLIC charges its member 
institutions more for the same protection. 
</P>
<P>
Home Federal had filed applications for the move with various state and federal 
regulatory bodies more than two years ago but did not apply to the bank board 
until June 9. And then it did so under protest because it contends that the 
agency does not have the right to approve or disapprove the switch. On Friday, 
the bank board asked for more information, prompting Home Federal's lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"We could have gone back and forth looking for more information for several 
months," Home Federal spokeswoman Sheree Zizzi said. 
</P>
<P>
The bank board last month rejected a request by Great Western Bank in Beverly 
Hills to merge with an FDIC-insured subsidiary and switch all its deposits from 
the FSLIC insurance system to the FDIC. Great Western, the nation's 
second-largest thrift, plans to appeal a court ruling that backed the bank 
board's decision. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-based Home Savings of America, the nation's largest S&amp;L, also 
has applied to join the FDIC. 
</P>
<P>
Home Federal said its case is different from Great Western's -- and is exempt 
from bank board scrutiny -- because it does not involve the sale or transfer of 
assets.

THE PACE EASES BUT COST OF HOMES IS STILL RISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, San Diego County Business Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The average cost of San Diego housing is still heading ever-upward but the rate 
of increase has leveled off from last year's frenzied pace, according to new 
market surveys released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The average sales price of an existing house in the San Diego metropolitan area 
was $217,228 in June, up 24% from the $175,416 average price in June 1988, 
according to the San Diego Board of Realtors. The June average was also up 
nearly $10,000 from the $207,478 average in May. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Costlier Homes Set Tone 
</P>
<P>
But the overall average was skewed somewhat by the disproportionate increase in 
prices and unit sales of higher-priced homes, San Diego board president Chuck 
Hoffman said Monday. An indication of how the high-priced dwellings are leading 
the way was that homes priced over $200,000 accounted for 38% of all resales in 
June, up from 24% of all sales in June, 1988, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, prices of lower-priced or so-called entry-level houses in San Diego 
remained relatively flat in June. Noting that less than 20% of San Diego 
families can afford the median-priced home in the county, brokers said that 
first-time buyers seemed to have stretched their budgets to the breaking point 
to qualify for home loans. 
</P>
<P>
An indication of the flatness was that the median price of San Diego resales, 
or the price at which half of all houses sold for more and the rest for less, 
was $177,000, unchanged from the median price in April and May. 
</P>
<P>
"We finally have priced property to the point where it will not sell 
instantaneously," said Ray Baker, owner-broker of Century 21-Golden Circle, a 
brokerage that specializes in housing in the Mira Mesa area. "We're coming back 
to reality. We are seeing houses languishing, not selling. We are now getting 
price reductions." 
</P>
<P>
A survey of new housing sold at county subdivisions also found a slowdown of 
the near-panic buying and price escalation that characterized last year's 
market. According to a survey by Meyers Group, the average price of new 
single-family houses sold countywide during the three months ended in June was 
$230,000, up 40% from the $163,990 average a year ago but just $3,000 more than 
the average price during first quarter 1989. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Decreases Noted 
</P>
<P>
According to Meyers Group vice president Peter Reeb, average prices of new 
houses in some areas of the county, notably the Carlsbad-Oceanside sub-market, 
decreased from this year's first quarter. However, areas including Escondido 
and San Diego showed price increases. 
</P>
<P>
Another sign of market cooling is that unit sales were down both in new and 
resold houses. Reeb of Meyers Group said total units sold at subdivisions over 
the quarter were 2,153, down from 3,190 units sold over the same three-month 
period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Board of Realtors, whose members handle transactions in San 
Diego, Chula Vista, El Cajon and La Mesa, reported sales transactions totaling 
1,328 houses and condominiums in June, down 12% from the 1,494 units sold in 
June 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Russell Valone, president of Market Profiles of San Diego, a firm that tracks 
subdivision sales, said the slowdown in activity shows that the San Diego 
housing market is "normalizing" after last year's extraordinary pressures. 
Those pressures included the threat of slow-growth ballot measures that were 
defeated at the polls last November. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enthusiasm Tempered 
</P>
<P>
Keith Johnson, a principal at Fieldstone Co., a San Diego home builder with 
four projects in the county, said his staff has noticed a slowdown in buyer 
traffic and reduced buyer enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is that there has been a substantial run-up in prices and that the 
market is having a hard time digesting that," Johnson said. "It's not that 
houses aren't selling. It's just that the market, from a builder's point of 
view has gone from great to good."

NEW KOLL CENTER FINDS FUN COMES NATURALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
People on their lunch hour walk by the new office and residential complex 
called Koll Center at 501 West Broadway and stop to look into the 30-foot-high 
window. Many of them are surprised when they discover that the huge glass cage 
houses 70 exotic birds and 12 varieties of plants. 
</P>
<P>
But it is not just the aviary that makes the newly opened structure 
unconventional. The pale pink and green marble lobby also houses two 
5,000-gallon aquariums next to the elevators and six 40-foot royal palm trees 
flanking the main entrance. 
</P>
<P>
The aquariums "give people who are waiting for the elevator something to do 
instead of look at each other and wonder what to say or not to say," said Bob 
Wade, a contractor with Koll Co., the Newport Beach-based developer of the 
365,000-square-foot structure, which opened July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Most people who work in the building or who just come to look at it agree that 
the 60-foot-high, glass-vaulted lobby is relaxing and innovative. 
</P>
<P>
"It has flair, it has real class," said Carolyn Barg, who works at Centre City 
Development Corp. in a building nearby. "It is not the standard office 
intention." 
</P>
<P>
When the $160-million project was conceived, the goal was to create a unique 
building, said Biff Porter, vice president of Koll Co. A design company came up 
with a "fun list" to make the complex bright and lively, and Koll Co. 
implemented the ideas, including the $125,000 aviary and the $100,000 
aquariums. 
</P>
<P>
The $82-million first phase of the project has a 21-story tower with 18 floors 
of office space, a 2,000-square-foot space for two stores, a flower shop and an 
international newspaper stand, a 5,000-square-foot restaurant and a 
10,000-square-foot health club. 
</P>
<P>
Work on the second of the project is scheduled to begin next July and will open 
in January, 1992. Phase 2 will be connected to the original lobby by a series 
of escalators that will be decorated with a waterfall, Porter said.

PUSH IS ON TO ATTRACT LATINOS;

ADVERTISERS FIND A MARKET UNDER THEIR NOSES

When Cox Cable San Diego initiated a campaign earlier this year to net more 
cable television viewers, the company attacked on a new front -- it pitched 
cable TV to the county's fast-growing Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
Cox Cable executives handed the marketing assignment to Brenda Lovitt, the 
chief customer recruiter, who greeted the task with trepidation. The cause of 
Lovitt's concern: she's an Anglo. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't speak Spanish. I don't understand the culture," Lovitt said. "How can 
I put myself in the position of a Spanish-speaking customer?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Outside Help 
</P>
<P>
So Lovitt and Cox turned to Cohen Advertising Group, a 3-year-old San 
Diego-based agency that specializes in advertising directed to Latino 
consumers. Since March, Cohen has developed two Cox Cable campaigns, for both 
TV and radio. A third campaign, expected to air soon, will also feature a 
direct-mail effort. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen, whose other clients include Skippy, Farmer's Market, Del Taco and 
Seagrams, decided to use the Spanish catchword conectate for the Cox campaign, 
which means literally to connect or hook up, perfect for a cable TV company, 
Lovitt said. 
</P>
<P>
"But even better, conectate also has another meaning -- to join or to become 
part of," Lovitt said, adding that the word has become a centerpiece of Cox's 
Latino marketing strategy. "We used it to send a message to the Hispanic viewer 
that says you're missing out unless you become part of the Cox Cable family. It 
was really clever." 
</P>
<P>
Cox's experience with Cohen illustrate's corporate America's increasing desire 
to sell goods and services to an ever-increasing Latino market and has spurred 
the start-up of agencies that focus primarily, if not exclusively, on creating 
Spanish-language advertising. 
</P>
<P>
The growing attention paid to the Latino market can be observed in several 
regions across the nation, but such activity is most apparent in Southwestern 
cities with high concentrations of Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County, with a Latino population of 473,800, or 17.7% of the overall 
2.6 million, is a prime example. Companies are drawn not only to San Diego's 
substantial Latino population but also to the potential of reaching 1.5 million 
more Latinos just south of the border in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
"We were never familiar with the Hispanic market, so we never really tried to 
penetrate it," said Lovitt of Cox Cable. "Besides, in the past we were busy 
just trying to penetrate the general or Anglo market. Since we've successfully 
done that, we started looking at other markets where we could expand. The 
Hispanic market was staring us in the face." 
</P>
<P>
Although Cox Cable has been serving San Diego viewers for 25 years, the company 
only began advertising in Spanish five months ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eatery Interested, Too 
</P>
<P>
Even Rubio's Restaurants, operator of the San Diego-based Mexican eateries, had 
until recently overlooked the Latino market. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ironic," said Ralph Rubio, president of the restaurant chain. "We serve 
Mexican food, but our success has been built on our ability to draw the 
college-educated Anglo customer. But we want Hispanics to come to our 
restaurants, too. 
</P>
<P>
"Just like every other businessman out there, I've been seeing statistics about 
the growing U.S. Hispanic population," Rubio said. "You just can't ignore those 
numbers anymore." Rubio, who has teamed with Cohen, is in the midst of 
preparing an advertising campaign directed at Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
As impressive as the size of the county's Latino population is the rate of its 
growth. From 1970 to 1980, the county's Latino population grew 126.5%, 
according to a study just completed by the Strategy Research Corp., Miami-based 
marketing and research firm that has conducted nearly 30 market studies of the 
Hispanic market. The study was commissioned by a coalition of local Latino 
radio and television stations and agencies. 
</P>
<P>
During the last nine years, the number of Latinos has increased by 72.2%. But 
even more important is the Latino buying power -- total spendable dollars 
generated by Latinos in San Diego is projected to be $2.8 billion in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Although Southern California has always had a sizable Latino population, 
companies have until recently failed to penetrate or recognize that market, 
said Patricia Cohen, president of Cohen Advertising Group. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Why-Bother Attitude 
</P>
<P>
"Most companies said, 'Why bother advertising in Spanish?' " Cohen said. "They 
believed that eventually the Hispanic immigrant would become assimilated, 
become an American. They believed, then, that they could be reached with 
regular English campaigns." 
</P>
<P>
But Cohen cites recent market studies that show that nearly half of all Latinos 
in the United States never become assimilated. "They never really have to learn 
English . . . . It's becoming increasingly apparent that a large group can be 
reached by Latino advertising, whereas an English campaign targeted at the same 
group would be ineffective," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
Companies' reluctance to enter an unfamiliar market left the Latino market 
untapped, said Gerry Stefanko, president and CEO of San Diego-based Stefanko 
&amp; Hetz Advertising and Design. A year ago, Stefanko established Salsa 
Advertising &amp; Marketing, a division of Stefanko &amp; Hetz, to exclusively 
handle Latino campaigns. Allie's Restaurants and XEWT-TV, the Tijuana-based 
television station, are among Salsa's clients. 
</P>
<P>
"There's the stereotype of the sleepy Mexican who has no money to spend," 
Stefanko said. "Such false perceptions have prevented American companies from 
truly recognizing how lucrative the Hispanic market can be." 
</P>
<P>
Cohen has encountered such ignorance as well. 
</P>
<P>
"I've run into the American marketer who is used to sitting in his office and 
occasionally makes a trip into Tijuana," Cohen said. "He sees people and the 
way they live, and because they look different or look like they don't have 
money, he decides it's a waste of time to advertise to them. 
</P>
<P>
"What he doesn't recognize is that there are different class levels, that there 
are many Mexicans who come across the border because they prefer American 
products," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
General agencies, as well as companies' in-house marketing units, will testify 
that advertising to Latinos takes more than being bilingual; an agency must be 
bicultural. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Learning the Hard Way 
</P>
<P>
Companies that have rushed ill-prepared into the Latino market have learned 
that lesson the hard way. One embarrassing example: Braniff airlines attempted 
to pitch their English campaign about "the luxury of riding on leather," which 
was translated into "sientese en cuero." 
</P>
<P>
"The translation in Spanish meant something like 'ride around naked in our 
wonderful airplane,' " Cohen said with a chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
"Marketing to the Hispanic community is not as simple as taking the Anglo 
message and running it in Spanish," said Dick Brooks, general manager of 
Phillips-Ramsey, one of San Diego's largest advertising agencies. Although 
Phillips-Ramsey runs Latino advertising for a handful of its clients, it often 
consults with specialized agencies for help. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel that we have the expertise on staff to market to the Hispanic 
community for all of our clients," Brooks said. "When we believe it's 
appropriate, we'll turn to outside resources." 
</P>
<P>
When Rubio opened his sixth and most recent Rubio's Deli-Mex restaurant in 
Chula Vista, he noticed that many of the patrons were Latino. Before 
advertising to lure more Latinos, Rubio says, it is critical to know which 
Latino subgroup to address. 
</P>
<P>
"A big agency is likely to treat Hispanics as the same," Rubio said. "But, in 
reality, you could have an assimilated Mexican who's been educated here, speaks 
English and holds a middle-management job. Or you can have a blue-collar worker 
who's been here for five or six years and speaks English at work, but speaks 
Spanish at home. Or you could have a Mexican who's been here just six months 
and doesn't speak any English. There are subtle differences among them. And you 
might have to create your advertising accordingly." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looking for Help 
</P>
<P>
Family Bargain Center, the off-price San Diego-based clothing retailer, has 
always had a large Latino customer base. But, until last May, the clothing 
chain, which now has 54 stores in California and Arizona (seven in San Diego 
County), lacked an effective, unified advertising campaign. Each district 
manager created his own advertising. 
</P>
<P>
"Considering that advertising was not their area of expertise, the district 
managers did a good job," said Andrew Rosenberg, who was hired a year ago as 
the advertising director to unify the chain's marketing campaign. "Each 
district manager was doing his own thing. Our effort, you could say, was 
roughshod." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg immediately set out to hire an agency familiar with Latino 
advertising. He chose Salsa Advertising &amp; Marketing. 
</P>
<P>
So, how's business been since hiring Salsa? 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is, sales have gone up." (The closely held company declined to 
release sales figures.) 
</P>
<P>
Lovitt, the senior product manager for Cox Cable, reports similar success with 
Cohen Advertising Group. 
</P>
<P>
"What we found out was that the local Hispanic viewer knew very little about 
cable," Lovitt said. "They didn't understand that we offered a variety of 
programs. So, before we did anything, we had to teach them from the ground up 
that we offered a wide range of entertainment at their fingertips." 
</P>
<P>
The first Cox campaign created by Cohen -- primarily an "awareness" commercial 
that featured the word conectate -- ran for about six weeks and ended June 10. 
Lovitt declared the campaign a hit. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as we started running the campaign, we started getting phone calls," 
Lovitt said. "I've never seen our customer service reps so busy." Cox netted 
800 new Latino customers because of the ads. 
</P>
<P>
And, according to Cohen, opportunities to capitalize on the Latino market 
should come in waves.

PRC OF GLENDALE OKS ACQUISITION BY BRITISH FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Products Research &amp; Chemical Corp. in Glendale said Monday it agreed to be 
acquired by Courtaulds PLC, a British company, for about $260 million. 
</P>
<P>
PRC makes coatings, sealants, adhesives and other specialty chemicals, and it 
earned $8 million on sales of $100.3 million in 1988. Courtaulds, a chemicals, 
textiles and industrial products concern, had bought 10.5% of PRC in May for 
$25 a share, or $21.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached Friday, Courtaulds has begun a tender offer to buy 
the remaining 8.1 million PRC common shares outstanding for $32 a share. 
</P>
<P>
The offer is scheduled to expire at midnight Aug. 4, unless it is extended. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement sent PRC's stock soaring on the New York Stock Exchange. The 
stock closed Monday at $31.625 a share, up $6.50, after jumping $2.625 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
PRC's top two executives -- chairman George Gregory, 72, and chief executive 
Dean Willard, 42 -- said in a joint telephone interview that they would retain 
those positions when the company becomes a Courtaulds subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
The executives said PRC's directors approved the deal because the offer price 
is attractive and because it would benefit PRC to be part of Courtaulds as the 
British company continues its aggressive effort to expand in the U.S. adhesives 
and coatings market. 
</P>
<P>
Courtaulds wants to spend $500 million acquiring U.S. companies to increase its 
share of the market, "and this is not the sort of thing we could afford to do 
ourselves," Gregory said. The British company hopes to generate sales of $500 
million to $1 billion in adhesives and sealants "by further acquisitions to be 
folded into PRC," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Courtaulds' initial investment in PRC called for the companies to exchange 
marketing and technical expertise. But had PRC stayed independent while 
Courtaulds continued buying PRC's competitors, "there could be some conflicts," 
Willard said. 
</P>
<P>
"It just simply made sense to really take a hard look" at merging instead, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Used by Military 
</P>
<P>
PRC's products are used by the military and a variety of commercial industries. 
They protect aircraft parts against corrosion and leakage, provide non-skid and 
anti-fire coating for the decks of aircraft carriers, and bond dual-paned 
windows used in skyscrapers, to name a few applications. 
</P>
<P>
The company evolved from being a small distributor of chemicals into a 
manufacturer with its own proprietary technology under the leadership of 
Gregory, a Russian immigrant who joined the company in 1948 after earning a 
bachelor's degree in chemistry from UCLA.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: OWNER OF SOLLEY'S SELLS 2 OF HIS 4 RESTAURANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The owner of the four Solley's restaurants/delicatessens in the San Fernando 
Valley has sold two of his outlets for an undisclosed amount. 
</P>
<P>
Sol Zide said last week that he sold the Solley's in Northridge to his brother, 
Abe, who had spent 16 years working with him. That restaurant is expected to be 
renamed Abe's. Zide said he also sold his Encino restaurant to a group led by 
the owners of Jerry's Famous Deli in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
Zide, 46, will retain ownership of his original outlet in Woodland Hills, which 
he opened 18 years ago, and his other restaurant in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Zide said he decided to sell the two restaurants because running all four had 
become too burdensome. "I found myself stressed out and not happy," he said. 
"I'm once again talking to the customers, which I missed sorely over the past 
few years."

The evening newscasts drew more viewers during the second quarter of 1989 than 
in the comparable period a year ago, according to the quarterly ratings from 
the A.C. Nielsen Co. "ABC World News Tonight" had a 9.7 rating and 20 share to 
barely top "CBS Evening News," which had a 9.6 and 20. "NBC Nightly News" had 
an 8.8 and 19 share. During the same three-month period in 1988, ABC had a 9.6 
rating, CBS 9.4 and NBC 8.6. The rating is a percentage of all U.S. homes with 
televisions, which currently is estimated to be 90.4 million. The share is a 
percentage of sets in use. ALEENE MacMINN

Hot on the heels of receiving an Emmy Award as outstanding talk/service show 
host, Sally Jessy Raphael is moving her syndicated talk show into New York 
City. Raphael started the program in St. Louis in 1983, moved to New Haven, 
Conn., in 1987 and will be located in the Big Apple starting next month. 
Executive producer Burt Dubrow said Monday from New Haven that "we're moving 
for the betterment of the show. The kind of guests we need are in New York for 
a limited amount of time, and they often can't make the two-hour commute to 
Connecticut." However, he added, "We couldn't make the move if we didn't have a 
little success under our belt." Raphael's show is now seen in 170 markets 
representing 94% of the country. ALEENE MacMINN

BILL FRISELL OFFERS OWN BRAND OF NEW MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Frisell is definitely on to something. The New York City-based guitarist 
(actually, he lives across the Hudson in Hoboken) has been touted for years by 
critics and musicians as one of the most gifted players to arrive on the scene 
in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday night at At My Place, in the Los Angeles debut of his quartet, Frisell 
left little doubt that his good notices have been more than justified. 
</P>
<P>
The music was a turbulent mixture of sounds in which solos and composed 
sections were constantly bouncing and spinning around each other. Frisell 
seemed to be posing the question of whether it was possible to fragment, then 
reconstruct -- in a kind of musically Cubist fashion -- various kinds of 
contemporary forms, from pop and country to blues and Western swing. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, it recalled a similar question posed by Ornette Coleman 30 years 
ago, when he attempted to restructure jazz by tearing apart traditional 
improvisational styles and then putting them back together in ways that 
reflected his own disjunct musical perspectives. 
</P>
<P>
In Frisell's case, the new slant worked -- but not all the time. The evening's 
major composition, "Hard Plains Drifter," was a case in point. Arranged by John 
Zorn from a collection of Frisell themes, the long, multisectional piece 
randomly presented a series of melodies and solos (running the gamut from jazz 
to country), then shuffled, trimmed, varied and altered the segments until they 
were totally transformed. The effect was like watching a series of fast-moving 
clouds coalesce and change into ever-altering but always somewhat recognizable 
images. 
</P>
<P>
But the virtually chance-like, disconnected juxtaposition of elements, 
startling as it sometimes was, failed to sustain interest for the full run of 
the piece. Structure, after all, can have its own value. 
</P>
<P>
The shorter works were far more effective, in part because of the quirky appeal 
provided by the almost cinematic quick cuts between little fragments of style 
-- a minor blues here, a jaunty Western rhythm there. 
</P>
<P>
Cellist Hank Roberts, sharing the solos with Frisell, was a major factor in the 
music's success. His phrasing -- via bow and pizzicato -- exploded with a rush 
and drive rarely heard from the other jazz/pop/fusion practitioners of his 
instrument. 
</P>
<P>
Drummer Joey Baron and bassist Kermit Driscoll functioned as equal partners, 
their contributions absolutely vital to a collection of works in which there 
were no "back-up" parts.

Caveats aside, Frisell's music -- both as guitarist and composer -- demanded 
the kind of attention that must be given an artist with serious intentions. If 
this performance was any indication, he may well become one of the most 
provocative voices of the '90s. DON HECKMAN

HARPSICHORDIST LENDS FRENCH BAROQUE LIFE -- UP TO ITS DEATH

Scholars may debate the influence that the French Revolution exerted on musical 
history, but harpsichordist Jennifer Paul had no particular thesis to 
promulgate in her recital Sunday night at the La Jolla Congregational Church. 
She merely used the upcoming bicentennial of the Revolution as an excuse to 
play a two-hour survey of French harpsichord music written from the middle of 
the 17th Century up to the eve of the Revolution. Her sole "revolutionary" link 
was a 1792 composition by Claude Balbastre based on "La Marseillaise," which 
she performed as the program's finale. 
</P>
<P>
From a listener's point of view, there are many reasons not to play a program 
devoted exclusively to French Baroque music. In musical structure, these 
composers suffered from arrested development, and, after a while, their overly 
precious suites sound tediously repetitive. Nor is this musical tradition 
profound or probing. To place these French suites next to the preludes and 
fugues of J. S. Bach is like comparing "Gilligan's Island" to the comedies of 
Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
Realizing these problems, Paul anchored her recital with a determined and 
solidly sculpted performance of Antoine Forqueray's Fifth Suite. Although the 
suite's finale is an exercise in unabashed pictorialism -- the Roman God 
Jupiter hurling thunderbolts to earth -- the other movements eschew frivolity 
and excessive ornamentation. 
</P>
<P>
The abstract character of this Forqueray suite acted as the perfect foil for a 
set of fiery, flamboyant movements by Joseph Royer. Paul has made this late 
18th-Century composer one of her specialties, and her sense of timing and 
clever juxtaposition made Royer's careening musical melodramas sizzle. 
</P>
<P>
In this set, with its wild arpeggios and chordal pummeling, Paul demonstrated 
that she had virtuosity to burn and humor to spare. 
</P>
<P>
Three opening works by members of the Couperin family, however, sounded 
uncharacteristically placid and uninspired. Paul meandered through the 
"Passacaille" by Louis Couperin, but in a suite on the program's second half by 
Armand-Louis Couperin, she displayed much more conviction, direction, and sense 
of style. 
</P>
<P>
Balbastre's "Marche des Marseillois" is actually a "battle piece," a 
programmatic type favored by late 18th-Century composers of many nationalities. 
(From America's Revolution, there is one such battle piece called "The Battle 
of Trenton.") With great relish, Paul shouted out the descriptive titles -- 
e.g., "Charge," "Cannon Firing" -- of each section of the Balbastre battle 
piece, which brought the longish evening to an upbeat conclusion.

NESMITH GOES OUT ON A LIMB FOR THE MONKEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the one hand, it's been easy to sympathize over the years with Michael 
Nesmith's refusal to take part in any Monkees reunions. Here he is, trying to 
establish a serious film-making career and pass through middle age with a few 
shreds of dignity, while his three erstwhile comrades in simianism head toward 
their golden years on the state-fair circuit, making funny faces and singing 
tunes about how "baby, you'll soon be 16." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, those with the slightest traces of mid-'60s nostalgia may 
have occasionally felt the urge to shake Nesmith by the lapels and demand: 
"What's your problem, anyway, buddy? Ungrateful for all those royalties? Too 
artistic now to acknowledge your past and have a little fun, for criminy's 
sake? Loosen up, pal!" 
</P>
<P>
Nesmith finally did just that on Sunday before a sold-out Universal 
Amphitheatre crowd, gamely joining Davy Jones, Micky Dolenz and Peter Tork for 
the last 45 minutes of the Monkees' set for a one-time-only complete reunion. 
He playfully made a show out of his initial reluctance to join in all their 
Monkee games, but clearly seemed to get a kick out of finally participating in 
the silliest of charades -- up to and including a rap version of the Monkees' 
theme, and the climactic TV-show Foreign Legion Monkee walk. 
</P>
<P>
Between goofiness, the other three backed Nesmith up on two songs from his solo 
career, "Cruisin' " and the 1970 country-rockish hit "Joanne," as well as a 
couple of numbers he sang lead on during the group's heyday. In return, he was 
good sport enough to take a backing role (on acoustic guitar and vocals) on 
some of the better pop confections of the '60s, most memorably "Last Train to 
Clarksville," "Daydream Believer" and "I'm a Believer." 
</P>
<P>
Davy: "Where've you been?" 
</P>
<P>
Michael: "I've been looking for my hat!" 
</P>
<P>
That sort of exchange was barely a step above all the scripted Monkeeshtick 
that preceded Nesmith's arrival on stage ("We've had a request," "But we're 
going to go right on singing," et al.). Nevertheless, it was a shamefully 
nostalgic kick to see Nesmith -- even with hands plunged into the pockets of 
his pleated pants -- get down and monkey around. As Devo would attest, 
de-evolution has its charms.

'CLEARING' ROUGH AROUND EDGES, BUT DEBUT SHOWS MUCH PROMISE

<TEXT>
<P>
Three's Company's summer Lo-Tec series has become a popular proving ground for 
out-of-town artists over the years. And why not? The intimate studio setting 
provides a safe harbor for testing new techniques and polishing raw dance 
designs before they are presented on a formal concert stage. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside-based Stephanie Gilliland, a veteran dance maker with choreographic 
roots in musical theater, television, and opera -- as well as modern concert 
dance -- was the latest visitor to try out a brand new piece at the local, 
experimental venue. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliland premiered "Clearing," her first attempt at a full-length dance work, 
during two performances over the weekend. Although she started setting the 
piece on her dancers well before they arrived in San Diego for their weeklong 
residency, it did not take shape for its first complete run-through until about 
three hours before curtain Saturday night. Little wonder that the dance sagged 
in spots and lacked the crisp patina of professional polish. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-movement dance work ran well over an hour, without intermission. And the 
three women who performed it (Laurie Burnaby, Elaine Nakashima, and Gilliland 
herself) were on stage the entire time. That made it something of an endurance 
test for the dancers -- who were obviously spent by its conclusion -- and a bit 
of an ordeal for the lo-tec audience, considering the low comfort level in the 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
There was much to savor in the movement, however, and in the sculptural set 
pieces by Mick Gronek. And, if Gilliland had allotted some time off stage for 
costume changes, it might have added considerably to the work's visual 
interest. As it was, the dancers wore the same layered-look rehearsal togs 
throughout the shifting sections of the dance. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliland is an abstractionist, so there was no clear-cut story line in 
"Clearing," but the overall theme of women in nature kept cropping up as the 
dance evolved. It began with "Sticks and Fall," a ritualistic romp with a 
strong sense of the primordial. 
</P>
<P>
"Sticks" sent an entranced Gilliland in circular patterns around the odd-shaped 
sculptures placed helter-skelter throughout the performing space. At one point, 
the lone dancer seemed to be carried along on a wave of religious fervor. 
</P>
<P>
Gronek's artworks, titled "Gradual Rise," took on the mysterious quality of 
Stonehenge, particularly when the musical motifs evoked ancient chants, 
primitive wails or loud, repetitive drones. 
</P>
<P>
If the sculptures had been artfully lighted to allow more shadow play on the 
backdrop, they would have been very powerful props indeed. As it was, they were 
often lost in the background. That could be the price you have to pay to see 
this highly theatrical work in a bare-bones arena. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the piece, in a short interlude titled, "Shifting," the dancers 
interacted with the art in fascinating ways that suggest endless metaphors for 
these rising monoliths. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliland used animal imagery to excellent effect in a couple of duets and 
trios. Early, in "Sport," she made playful sport with Nakashima and Burnaby, 
when they teamed up for some tricky entanglements. 
</P>
<P>
"Undercurrent," a floor-bound section for all three dancers, used an interplay 
of jungle-inspired icons danced in lightning-quick time. And "Fledgling" gave 
impish Nakashima the limelight for a cat-like solo that melted into the 
throbbing percussives of the finale. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliland painted her most impressive stage pictures in "Imprints," the final 
section of the dance. The trio sliced through space with animal intensity, but 
it looked as if its designer still wasn't quite sure how to end it. 
</P>
<P>
Guest dancer Sheryl Freeman appeared in one brief interlude, titled "Ingress," 
a softly flowing solo that used borrowed images from Indian dance. And all 
three principals recited a spoken text in "Three Stories," a section that 
summed up what the performers were saying in dance during the rest of the piece 
-- "We are girls . . . women in nature." 
</P>
<P>
"Clearing" needs more shaping and control before it bows in as a finished 
product, but the raw materials are there. And the three diverse dancers who 
bring it to life have an obvious zest for their subject.

A PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE OF 'THE STRUGGLE FOR DEMOCRACY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Democracy is a universal word with no universal meaning. More than anything, 
Patrick Watson's series, "The Struggle for Democracy," initially reminds us of 
that. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-part journey through history and 30 nations begins at 9 tonight on 
Channels 28 and 15 and at 10 on Channel 50. 
</P>
<P>
And what about democracy? Watson, a long-time Canadian journalist and 
television personality, boils it down and finds a common denominator among many 
definitions: power! 
</P>
<P>
Watson doesn't explore that very deeply on the premiere, much of which is very 
fragmented, denying you the freedom to dwell on many of the areas that he 
touches. 
</P>
<P>
His search for contemporary definitions of democracy leads him to East Los 
Angeles and its voices of raw pragmatism ("It all depends on what kind of money 
you have"), and to the streets of New York and echoes of raw idealism ("Nobody 
to tell you what to do, how to do it, when to do it, y'know?"). 
</P>
<P>
And in the different-strokes-for-different-folks category: Is democracy -- 
however it's defined -- universally revered? In Argentina, we hear from 
citizens who say they feel adrift and less secure in their present, relatively 
free society than they did inside the tight cocoon of autocracy. 
</P>
<P>
This series is very much Watson's own perspective ("Throughout most of my life 
. . . "). He's a superb, refreshingly unpretentious on-camera host and 
narrator, infusing his material with a contagious energy and enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
That Watson's series has been clearly outflanked by history, however, has been 
acknowledged by him in interviews and is evident from its omissions. 
</P>
<P>
There is no mention of China's best and brightest fleetingly speaking out for 
democratic reforms before being crushed. Even more significantly, there is no 
mention of glasnost, the astounding democratization under way in the Soviet 
Union and the Soviet Bloc, as dramatically emphasized this week during 
President Bush's TV-lit trip to Poland. 
</P>
<P>
In a wider context, however, the above are merely historical footnotes to a 
timeless, ageless, ever-evolving concept. That is indirectly emphasized as 
Watson travels to Athens for extensive ruminations on the cradle of democracy 
and its shining symbolism. 
</P>
<P>
Watching this, it may strike you how often free societies tend to confuse the 
symbols of democracy with democracy itself, not understanding that true 
democracy includes the freedom to attack the symbol as a right of expression. 
And with this in mind, it may strike you also that the key word in the title of 
this series is struggle. HOWARD ROSENBERG

Fifteen South Pacific nations alarmed at the depletion of tuna stocks by 
drift-net fishing asked help to force Japan and Taiwan to end the practice. The 
Pacific leaders, meeting in Tarawa, Kiribati, for their two-day annual South 
Pacific forum, are alarmed that the practice -- also called gill-net fishing -- 
threatens the Pacific's economic future, said Cook Islands Prime Minister 
Geoffrey Henry. The technique uses nets up to 30 miles long and has been 
likened to strip mining the ocean.

Japan's leaders agreed to provisionally budget for hefty increases in defense 
spending and overseas aid for the next fiscal year, government officials said. 
They said defense outlays will increase as much as 6.35% in the year that 
begins April 1, 1990, and overseas aid by up to 9.4% over the current fiscal 
year. Japan has been under pressure from the United States to recycle some of 
its huge trade surplus back to the Third World by increasing its spending on 
overseas aid, and this year Japan passed the United States in total overseas 
aid expenditures. Washington has also been pressing Tokyo to take up a greater 
share of the burden of defending itself.

Former U.S. Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III testified in New York that his longtime 
friend and former lawyer E. Robert Wallach never sought preferential treatment 
for the Wedtech Corp. Meese also testified at Wallach's racketeering trial that 
Wallach never asked him to intervene in the investigation of the now-defunct 
military contractor. Wedtech, once a small machine shop in New York City's 
South Bronx, grew into a $100-million government contractor through a Small 
Business Administration program that set aside no-bid contracts for 
minority-controlled companies. Wallach; W. Franklyn Chinn, 47, a former Wedtech 
board member and one-time Meese financial adviser; and an associate of theirs, 
R. Kent London, are charged with extracting almost $2 million in illegal 
payoffs and payments from Wedtech to influence Meese and other government 
officials.

The Air Force has approved the use of soft contact lenses by pilots and air 
crew members, acknowledging eyeglasses have some drawbacks when worn in today's 
high-technology fighter cockpits. Soft contacts have been "proven to provide an 
operational advantage over the wear of spectacles in missions which require 
maneuvering flight, the use of night vision goggles, the constant wear of an 
oxygen mask, and the ability to quickly look to the far limits of lateral 
gaze," the Air Force surgeon general's office said. As before, new pilots are 
required to prove that they have perfect, or 20-20, vision, said Patti Turner, 
a spokeswoman for the Air Force surgeon general. But if a pilot or crew 
member's vision worsens after completion of training, and it can be corrected 
to 20-20, he or she will be allowed to use either spectacles or the soft 
contact lenses, Turner said. Up to now spectacles have been permitted.

A Filipino banker told the Philippine House of Representatives that ousted 
President Ferdinand E. Marcos at one time had $7.5 billion in Swiss bank 
accounts. At a committee hearing in Manila, Michael de Guzman testified that he 
learned of the amount while acting as an agent of the Presidential Commission 
on Good Government. Under a commission plan to track down the allegedly 
ill-gotten wealth of Marcos, De Guzman said, he got Marcos on March, 1986, to 
authorize him to withdraw deposits from Swiss banks for transfer to an Austrian 
bank. In the process, Swiss authorities identified 10 banks holding Marcos' 
money and 11 Marcos foundations. The plan was later called off by the 
commission, and the money was never transferred, he added.

Muslim guerrillas rained more than 50 rockets on Kabul, killing at least 20 
people and wounding 51 in what appeared to be the most savage shelling of the 
Afghan capital this year, according to government officials and hospital 
workers. Among the facilities hit was an ammunition depot near Kabul's airport, 
where witnesses had reported explosions and fire. Afghanistan's Supreme Defense 
Council held emergency meetings to evaluate the attacks on Kabul, which has 
come under increased shelling in the last week from the Muslim rebels fighting 
to overthrow the pro-Soviet Afghan government.

Pakistan will rejoin the British Commonwealth within the next three months, 17 
years after Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's father took the country out of the 
group, Pakistan's ambassador to London said. Shaharyar Khan said the 
Commonwealth secretary general, Shridath Ramphal, told Bhutto during talks in 
London that there is unanimous agreement within the group that Pakistan should 
rejoin. Pakistan is expected to take up the issue before the Commonwealth 
summit in Malaysia in October. "Except for the formalities, we are members," 
Khan said. Bhutto's father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, broke with the Commonwealth in 
1972 after leading members recognized the breakaway state of Bangladesh, 
formerly East Pakistan.

At least one person in Connecticut died as tornadoes slammed into four 
northeastern states. Scores were injured, dozens of homes and businesses were 
damaged, thousands were left without power and at least 200 were believed 
homeless. The victim, a 13-year-old girl, was killed by a falling tree in Black 
Rock State Park in Watertown in west central Connecticut. The twisters struck 
two Upstate New York towns and a Long Island village, hit three central 
Massachusetts communities and roared into northwestern and coastal Connecticut. 
Unusual in the Northeast, tornadoes were also reported in northern New Jersey. 
The New York twisters cut a narrow path through the Putnam County towns of 
Carmel and Brewster 30 to 40 miles north of New York City. A separate tornado

POLICE FAIL TO FIND SUPPORT FOR CHARGES OF GUN PART THEFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Allegations that Los Angeles police officers stole parts from hundreds of 
confiscated guns and sold them at swap meets and gun shows have not been 
substantiated by an internal investigation that is near completion, a police 
official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Cmdr. George Morrison, speaking for Police Chief Daryl F. Gates at a meeting of 
the City Council's Police, Fire and Public Safety Committee, characterized the 
allegations as "a rehash" of old charges that the Police Department has looked 
into before and found to be untrue. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison acknowledged that two previous audits of the department's firearms and 
explosives section had found numerous "deficiencies," including violations of 
procedures, inadequate space for and improper storage of weapons and personnel 
shortages. But, he added, "there is no evidence of criminal activity." 
</P>
<P>
"We have problem areas, and we've got to clean them up," Morrison told 
reporters after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The internal investigation, he said, could be over by the end of next month. A 
third audit, begun by his office last summer, is still under way, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Contacted later by phone, the police officer whose complaints sparked the 
department's investigation accused police administrators of trying to cover up 
the situation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cover-Up Charged 
</P>
<P>
"It's been an ongoing cover-up since it was first brought out," said Lt. Jimmie 
J. Finn, a 23-year police veteran and former commander of the firearms and 
explosives section. "The mayor, the City Council and the Police Commission have 
not been able to cause this department to conduct a thorough investigation of 
these charges. 
</P>
<P>
"If the City Council really wanted to become actively involved, I'm certainly 
available to talk to them, and there are other officers who are available," 
Finn continued. "Instead, the City Council allows a member of the chief's 
personal staff to come over to refute it. I don't call that an adequate 
airing." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Richard Alatorre, chairman of committee and the only member present 
Monday, said after the meeting that he did not believe that police were 
covering up anything. He saw nothing improper in the Police Department being 
allowed to investigate itself, he said. He will recommend that the full City 
Council put the matter aside until both the audit and the investigation are 
complete, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police sources last month told The Times that Finn's allegations centered on a 
handful of officers and detectives, including a nationally known firearms 
expert, who reportedly stripped the parts from guns destined for destruction. 
Neither Alatorre nor Morrison would answer questions Monday about the details 
of the internal investigation, citing the privacy rights of the accused 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Section Audit 
</P>
<P>
Finn said Monday he first began complaining to his commanding officers about 
the activity in February, 1987. Those complaints led to an audit of the section 
by Gates' office but not an investigation into criminality. Action was taken on 
the gun-stripping allegations, Finn said, only after he took them to a police 
commissioner last November. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council asked for a response to the allegations from Gates last month 
after a Times story about the investigation.

JUDGE SLASHES $5.74-MILLION AWARD AGAINST W. COVINA POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG QUINTANA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saying a jury's $5.74-million verdict against West Covina police in the 
kidnaping and murder of a 10-year-old boy was clouded by emotion, a judge 
Monday slashed the award to $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona Superior Court Judge Robert A. Dukes ruled in the city's request that he 
throw out the May verdict. Dukes said the boy's father, Ronald Allan Tolleson, 
could either take the lower judgment or have a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
Tolleson said he would appeal the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Tolleson had sued the San Gabriel Valley city, claiming that police were 
negligent in their handling of the 1980 abduction of his son, Ronnie. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the case hinged on when Ronnie was strangled. Danny Jerome Young, a 
neighbor of the Tollesons, was convicted of second-degree murder and kidnaping 
after Ronnie's body was found in Young's garage. 
</P>
<P>
Police had searched the home of Young, a parolee from the California Youth 
Authority, the day of the abduction. Young testified for the city that he 
killed the boy immediately after abducting him. 
</P>
<P>
But the Tolleson suit contended that a more thorough search of the Young home 
might have found Ronnie alive. 
</P>
<P>
Tolleson and his lawyer, Peter M. Wucetich, said Monday's ruling was startling, 
especially since Dukes did not overturn the jury's finding of fault. 
</P>
<P>
"The judge said he agreed with their (the jury's) verdict," Tolleson said. "We 
thought it would be reduced, but nothing like this. I was very shocked by what 
(Dukes) did; I think my son has a higher value than that." 
</P>
<P>
Tolleson also argued that inexperienced police officers botched the 
investigation, allowing a potential suspect to escape from a ransom drop that 
police had under surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
Juror Bill Herbert said the panel was not swayed by the emotions of the case or 
Wucetich's passionate closing argument. 
</P>
<P>
"It's impossible to place value on the (life) of a child, and it's pointless to 
dwell on that," the juror said. But, he added, the large award was intended to 
send a message. 
</P>
<P>
"A reasonable figure would awake a lot of cities and towns and their government 
bodies that this was serious business," Herbert said. 
</P>
<P>
In justifying the jury's original award, Wucetich cited a 1985 Los Angeles case 
in which the parents of a 9-year-old child struck by a car in a crosswalk 
received a $3.4-million judgment on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"I find it so unbelievable," Wucetich said. Dukes "essentially totally 
disregarded the jury's verdict. I'm outraged. What happened to the right for a 
jury trial?" 
</P>
<P>
West Covina Police Chief Craig Meacham, who had pushed for the city to appeal, 
said he agreed with Dukes' characterization that the court was bound by "bad 
law" concerning police liability. A past president of the California Police 
Chiefs Assn., Meacham said he would lobby for legislation that would reduce 
police liability in such cases.

GOLDBERG ELECTED TO HEAD SCHOOL BOARD ON A 6-1 VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON, Times Education Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite predictions of more peaceful times for the nation's second-largest 
school district, Jackie Goldberg was elected president of the Los Angeles Board 
of Education in a 6-1 vote Monday that showed some scars from the May teachers' 
strike still remain. 
</P>
<P>
At first, a celebratory mood marked the board's annual reorganization meeting 
and inauguration for two reelected members and one newcomer, Mark Slavkin. But 
the mood quickly turned tense as Rita Walters sharply criticized Goldberg and 
refused to join the rest of the board in naming Goldberg president for the next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Walters denounced a plan pushed by Goldberg to restructure salaries so that 
teachers could earn as much as administrators with similar qualifications. That 
would "punish" administrators, Walters charged. A task force is supposed to 
study the issue later this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Out of that concern for the total morale of this district, I cannot support 
Miss Goldberg this morning," said Walters, who represents South-Central Los 
Angeles and, as a result of last month's elections, is now part of a minority 
faction on the board viewed as unfriendly to the teachers union. 
</P>
<P>
A recent move by some principals to unionize shows that the district pays too 
much attention to the teachers union, Walters said. She reiterated her 
opposition to budget cuts made to help finance the 24% pay raises for teachers 
called for in the three-year contract that ended the nine-day strike. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg later told reporters that Walters' comments represented "an enormous 
misunderstanding of what I'm about" but said she and Walters could still work 
together. Goldberg also said she would fight United Teachers-Los Angeles if a 
union action hurt students but added that such an event was unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, principals were given the same pay increases as teachers, but the 
board argued bitterly before giving a 16% raise over two years to top 
administrators. Goldberg favored raises for principals but not administrators. 
</P>
<P>
The board presidency, which carries few special powers, usually is rotated 
among senior board members, and election is often unanimous. Goldberg, who 
considers herself the most liberal member of the seven-member board, is in her 
second term representing Hollywood, downtown and the Wilshire corridor area. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg, 44, once taught in the Compton school district and now works for a 
literacy program in Los Angeles. Her 14-year-old son attends a Los Angeles 
district high school. 
</P>
<P>
In a formal speech made Monday with her mother, a retired teacher, at her side, 
Goldberg said she will push the district to become "more student centered." 
</P>
<P>
She said she would like the board to concentrate on improvements in bilingual 
education and programs for students in the first four years of schooling, along 
with cutting the drop-out rate and creating "shared decision-making" councils 
at all district schools. The councils -- composed of teachers, administrators 
and parents -- will have a say over scheduling and discipline, among other 
things, and their formation was a key issue in the strike. 
</P>
<P>
As president, Goldberg succeeds Roberta Weintraub, the East San Fernando Valley 
incumbent who gained a high profile during the strike. On the board for 10 
years, Weintraub was sworn in Monday for a new four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Excuses 
</P>
<P>
"There are no more excuses for any of us . . . ," Weintraub said. "This year, 
we've got to see changes in the (student test) scores and changes in the 
schools." 
</P>
<P>
Also sworn in Monday were Julie Korenstein, the West San Fernando Valley 
representative who won her first four-year term last month after serving on the 
board for two years, and Slavkin, who defeated Westside incumbent Alan Gershman 
in a bitterly fought race. The teachers union, trying to gain a friendly 
majority on the board, had strongly supported Slavkin and Korenstein. 
</P>
<P>
State Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) led Weintraub and Korenstein 
through their oaths. Weintraub then gave the assemblywoman a large plaque, 
bearing a school bell, in appreciation for Waters' help in mediating an end to 
the teachers' strike. After he was sworn in by the board clerk, Slavkin said he 
hoped for "a less acrimonious" environment on the board, although Walters 
subsequent comments about Goldberg soon belied Slavkin's wishes. 
</P>
<P>
At an outdoor reception afterward, teachers union Vice President Helen 
Bernstein called Walters "a sad person and her comments made me sad." 
</P>
<P>
At the board's first business meeting later in the day, further signs of 
discord appeared. A central overseer panel for the school governing councils is 
supposed to be formed by the end of the month, with half of its 24 members 
appointed by the teachers union and the other half by the board. Monday's 
agenda included a proposal to allow each board member to appoint a parent or 
community member and the superintendent to appoint five other people. 
</P>
<P>
The issue was postponed a week after Slavkin said he feared that the matter was 
being moved too quickly and without enough discussion, and Walters said she 
thought the proposed formula shortchanged parents.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TWO AUSTRALIANS JAILED IN TEA SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two men have been sentenced in Los Angeles to terms in County Jail after 
pleading no contest Friday to trying to market a tea they falsely claimed would 
lower cholesterol and prevent heart attacks, prosecutors said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Clarence Foster, 26, an Australian citizen, was ordered jailed by 
Municipal Court Commissioner Ralph Amado for four months after pleading no 
contest to two misdemeanor counts each of false advertising and falsely 
representing a drug to have medicinal qualities. 
</P>
<P>
Foster also was ordered to pay $228,000 to 46 newspapers in California and 
other states which had published advertisements for the tea, but which were 
never paid for the ads. 
</P>
<P>
Foster, who fled England after being charged in a similar tea swindle, was 
further ordered to spend an additional three months working on a Caltrans crew 
cleaning up Southern California freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Trevor Brine, 42, also an Australian citizen, was sentenced to three months in 
jail after pleading no contest to one count each of false advertising and 
falsely representing a drug to have medicinal qualities.

A woman standing with a group of people in the parking lot of a South-Central 
Los Angeles hamburger stand was fatally shot Monday by a man who fired several 
times from a nearby alley, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"She was standing in a parking lot adjacent to a fast-food restaurant at 100 E. 
Florence Ave. and a male suspect approached the parking lot from a rear alley," 
Sgt. John Lack said. "He fired several shots into the group she was standing 
with." Lashaunda Brooks, 19, was wounded in the upper body in the 1:30 a.m. 
attack and died at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center half an hour 
later.

No motive was determined for the shooting and no arrests have been made, Lack 
said.

Two Long Beach lifeguards failed to use proper procedure when they taped the 
mouth of an apparently drunk, profanity-spouting transient and left him bound 
on the beach for several minutes, the chief lifeguard said Monday. 
</P>

City lifeguard officials were reviewing the apprehension Sunday of Don Peterson 
for possible disciplinary action against the two veteran lifeguards, said 
Lifeguard Chief Jim Rae. He refused to release the names of the lifeguards. 
</P>

"The officers just got frustrated at the time because the guy was verbally 
swearing at the general public," Rae said. "It was a judgment call that

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY, L.A. RECEIVE STATE TAX REVENUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles has received $17.2 million as its share of 
state-collected cigarette taxes, highway-user taxes and motor vehicle license 
fees for the month of June, the state controller's office has announced. Los 
Angeles County received $31.6 million as its share. 
</P>
<P>
The $5.8 million the city received from the highway tax will be used for street 
maintenance and construction, said Louis Lee, a spokesman for Los Angeles' 
chief administrative office. 
</P>
<P>
The city expects to receive $47.3 million in highway-user taxes during fiscal 
year 1989-90. Nearly 75% of that money is budgeted for street maintenance, Lee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The county received $10.3 million for the month of June in highway-user taxes, 
and expects to generate about $18.5 billion over the next 10 years from the 
tax, according to a memo from county official Mas Fukai. 
</P>
<P>
The motor vehicle license fees contributed $10.4 million in a monthly 
disbursement to the city's general fund, while the cigarette tax added $972,493 
to the fund, according to the controller's office. The county received $21.2 
million and $972,493, respectively, from each tax.

7TH WOMAN DRIVER ACCOSTED BY MAN POSING AS POLICEMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman motorist driving alone near the Pomona Freeway escaped unhurt after she 
was pulled over early Monday by a man posing as a police officer, bringing to 
seven the number of similar incidents reported recently in the eastern San 
Gabriel Valley and Pico Rivera, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Six of the incidents occurred in the last two days, with the earliest known 
episode in the string of attacks taking place July 1, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent incident occurred in Pico Rivera about 4:45 a.m. Monday, 
capping a weekend in which an impostor either robbed, battered or attempted to 
sexually assault five other women motorists. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest incident, as in the others, the assailant wore a security 
guard-type uniform and used a white spotlight to stop a 33-year-old woman 
driving on the San Gabriel River Parkway near Rose Hills Memorial Park. He 
fled, however, when she questioned him about his car, which has been described 
as a dark, possibly rust-colored, Pinto or Datsun. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Question Him' 
</P>
<P>
"That's the thing to do -- question him," Sheriff's Deputy Hal Grant said. 
"Don't submit." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, deputies reported an assault on July 1 that they believe is 
connected to the string of other attacks. In that case, a 22-year-old Hacienda 
Heights woman was pulled over in Pico Rivera and was punched in the face by a 
man wearing what appeared to be a police uniform. 
</P>
<P>
Officers advised women drivers not to stop in dark, remote areas if they are 
uncertain who is signaling them to pull over -- even if the pursuer is a peace 
officer. The motorist should continue "at a reasonable speed for a reasonable 
distance to a well-lighted, populated area," Sheriff's Deputy Pat Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be no ramifications about continuing on for a short distance," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Motorists were also cautioned not to stop for anyone signaling with a white 
spotlight. Most law enforcement agencies use either a solid red or flashing red 
light, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's got to be a red light, not yellow or blue or white," Cmdr. John 
Distelrath of the West Covina Police Department said. "For God's sake, don't 
stop for anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Police said the assailant in all the incidents has been dressed in a dark 
uniform, with a dark cap and a jacket bearing a badge-like emblem. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Composite Drawing 
</P>
<P>
A composite sketch prepared Monday from descriptions given by the victims 
showed a white man in his 20s, about 6 feet tall, 165 pounds, with 
light-colored, curly, shoulder-length hair and a sparse mustache. 
</P>
<P>
In all the assaults, the impostor has followed the victims until he was sure 
they were driving alone, officers said. Then, using a white spotlight mounted 
on his car, the assailant has signaled the women to pull over, after which he 
demanded to see their driver's licenses. 
</P>
<P>
The weekend incidents occurred near the Pomona Freeway in Hacienda Heights, 
Rowland Heights and West Covina. The assailant attempted to rape two of the 
women and pushed one of them down a 30-foot embankment. But he fled when the 
women fought back. Another woman was robbed at knifepoint of the $100 she said 
was in her wallet. 
</P>
<P>
The impostor aimed tear gas spray at another of the women. In addition, another 
victim was struck four times in the face with a flashlight. She required 
medical treatment but was not hospitalized, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A suspect who matched the description and worked as a security guard was 
detained briefly on Sunday by sheriff's deputies and West Covina police but was 
released when none of the victims could positively identify a photo of him, 
officers said.

A day at the beach proved too taxing for two escaped inmates who called their 
jailer collect and asked if they could return, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Allen Fox and Charles F. Rohn, both 19, were back at the Michigan 
Reformatory at Ionia on Monday, facing possible escape charges, Warden Pamela 
Withrow said. 
</P>
<P>
"They said they spent the day at the beach, they were a little scared and 
hungry," said state trooper Larry Medendorp of the pair's trip to an unknown 
lake beach. The two, along with a third inmate who remained at large Monday, 
escaped Sunday from the prison's minimum-security dormitory unit.

ALL-STAR GAME; 
</P>
<P>
A REAL STAR; 
</P>
<P>
NAMED ONE OF NL'S BEST, BURKE IS SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT TO ONE BOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tonight, in a game of heroes, he will play the position of hero. In baseball's 
60th All-Star game at Anaheim Stadium, Montreal's Tim Burke will be one of the 
National League's four relief pitchers, a guy who could be called to make a 
pitch to win a game. At 30, making his first All-Star appearance, it is a call 
he has long awaited. 
</P>
<P>
So it's interesting that, when Burke is called, he might not be there. If the 
game goes late, Burke has already said he's leaving early. At midnight, he has 
to be aboard a jet at Los Angeles International Airport on a flight bound for 
Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if I leave the game . . . even if I have to steal a helicopter to get 
there, I will not miss that flight," Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
Waiting in Guatemala City is a 2-year-old boy. He was abandoned in front of an 
orphanage at birth. Because of a thyroid problem, his arms and legs aren't 
quite big enough for his body, and he may have suffered some mental 
retardation. Doctors have recommended against bringing him into this country. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Burke arrives Wednesday morning, the boy will become his son. 
</P>
<P>
"My son. Think about that -- I'm going to see my son for the first time," said 
Burke, who will sign adoption papers with wife Christine. "You put it that way, 
and this game isn't so important." 
</P>
<P>
The boy, to be named Ryan, will be their second adopted child. The first, a 
girl they named Stephanie, was taken two years ago from an orphanage in South 
Korea. In both cases, they worked through Holt Children's Services 
International out of Eugene, Ore., and their request was simple. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted some child, somewhere, who was unwanted," Burke said. "Maybe a child 
with a problem, a child nobody else would take." 
</P>
<P>
Why? It may have something to do with the very tag Burke may be denying himself 
tonight, something about being a hero. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of us are heroes whether we like it or not," Burke said of his 
baseball peers. "But a lot of people don't think being a hero comes with 
responsibility. I do." 
</P>
<P>
And so tonight, he said, will be bittersweet. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many emotions going through my head," Burke said. "I've always 
dreamed of being here, but it's hard to be here. There's some disappointment at 
not being with my son. There's heartache and at the same time it's a thrill. I 
know I may never have this chance in an All-Star game again. The whole thing is 
just very emotional for me." 
</P>
<P>
Burke actually became so excited by the adoption, which they have been working 
on since Christmas, that he announced to his wife last week that he would not 
attend the All-Star game if selected. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her no way, our son is more important than any game," Burke said. "But 
then she talked me out of it. She told me, you go through with it because 
you've worked so hard for it." 
</P>
<P>
Good for baseball, and good for the Expos, who need all the recognition they 
can get, despite being 49-38 and leading the National League East by 1 1/2 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"People in the other league think we are in the frozen north," said Expo 
Manager Buck Rodgers, who will coach third base for the National League. "They 
think we are in a foreign country." 
</P>
<P>
Well, uh, Buck, hate to tell you but. . . geography aside, the most unknown 
hero of this unknown team is the right-handed Burke, who has a 5-1 record, a 
2.82 ERA and 17 saves. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that not many people in baseball know me, they know all the other guys 
in this room," said Burke, gesturing to his teammates after Monday's workout. 
"But that's OK. I'm not into that." 
</P>
<P>
Burke has been more into other things ever since 1985. That's when he and his 
wife learned that medically, their chances of having a child weren't great. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife immediately talked about adoption, but I didn't want anything to do 
with it," Burke said. "I never thought I could love another child. I told my 
wife, 'I'm sorry, I just can't.' 
</P>
<P>
"She said fine. And then she started praying behind my back." 
</P>
<P>
A few months later, one winter day, Burke and his wife were driving around when 
he felt something. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden I saw a little Korean girl in my mind, and I wanted to adopt 
her," Burke said. "It was crazy, because I had never seen Koreans before, and I 
didn't even know if you could adopt them. But I told my wife this and she 
nearly fell out of the car. She then told me that's what she had been praying 
for." 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie was sent to them two years ago as an infant, and quickly became a 
favorite member of the Expos extended family. 
</P>
<P>
Said Rodgers: "I remember his wife got on a bus in Puerto Rico during one 
spring training, and on the baby's head was a little gold seal that read, "Made 
In Korea." We all thought it was great." 
</P>
<P>
Last winter the Burkes decided to adopt another child, only this time one with 
less chance of being adopted than an infant. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted an older unwanted child," Burke said. "We thought maybe that would 
help more." 
</P>
<P>
The adoption agency gave them a thick book with children's photos, and after 30 
minutes, Burke and his wife found the future Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw all these children with no chance to be loved, any one of them we could 
have taken . . . and then we saw Ryan and that was it. He was the one." 
</P>
<P>
Upon learning of his medical problems, Burke took the boy's file to two 
doctors. Both of them recommended against adoption. 
</P>
<P>
"But we still had him in our heart and we decided, no matter what happened, we 
wanted him," Burke said. "And you know what happened? He got better. The more 
we've seen of him in pictures, the more it looks like his arms and legs are 
growing into his body, and the more he is doing normal things. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been like a miracle." 
</P>
<P>
One day, perhaps, when he is old enough to understand, Burke's son will think 
of his parents like that. 
</P>
<P>
"I just know that as ballplayers, we influence a lot of people," Burke said. 
"They see us do something, they want to do it. When I was a kid, I saw Don 
Drysdale wind up, I wanted to have a windup like that. If today's kid see you 
out partying and going wild, then they want to do the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I just want to lead somebody the right way."

ALL-STAR GAME;

<P>
BO'S SHOW GETS A GO AT LEADOFF; 
</P>
<P>
MANAGER LA RUSSA SAVES HIS BEST FOR FIRST IN AL LINEUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
You know Bo. He hits home runs. He scores touchdowns. And in a new television 
commercial, he trades body checks with Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
But in tonight's 60th baseball All-Star game at Anaheim Stadium, you'll get to 
know Bo as you've never known Bo before. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, Bo Jackson bats leadoff. 
</P>
<P>
Tony La Russa, manager of the American League All-Stars, made this revelation 
during a pre-workout news conference on Monday and by the time word drifted 
back to the AL clubhouse, the AL All-Stars could scarcely believe their 
All-Star ears. 
</P>
<P>
"No," said a shocked Kirby Puckett. "Oh my God . . . I don't know what to say 
to that. . . . I guess Tony La Russa wants to throw him in there and give the 
people their money's worth." 
</P>
<P>
Doug Rader, the AL third base coach, smiled broadly when told the news. 
</P>
<P>
"Sweeeet," was Rader's first response. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Rader's face went blank. If this had been a cartoon, a light bulb would 
have blinked above Rader's head. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I have to ask myself is: If Bo's batting leadoff, who the 
hell's batting fourth?" 
</P>
<P>
Bo is someone who, in the words of Angel coach Jimmie Reese, "can hit a ball 
eight miles." Bo is a 225-pound outfielder who moonlights as a fullback and, in 
the words of National League outfielder Tony Gwynn, "looks like he's been cut 
out of rock." 
</P>
<P>
Bo Jackson leads the American League in home runs. But leading off? Even for 
the multidimensional Bo, that's breaking new ground. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, this is what All-Star games are for. And if La Russa wouldn't give 
the people everything they wanted -- he had the chance to name Nolan Ryan, the 
old Angel Express, as his starting pitcher, but went instead with Dave Stewart 
-- he could at least give them something to buzz about. 
</P>
<P>
The rationale behind the move, La Russa explained, came from personal 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's one great example -- well, it wasn't so great for me," said La Russa, 
manager of the Oakland Athletics. "We were playing Kansas City last week, we 
were up by one run in the ninth and Bo leads off. 
</P>
<P>
"He chops a ball into the hole and beats it out easily. Then, we caught him 
leaning off first base and he beats the throw to second base. He ended scoring 
to tie it. 
</P>
<P>
"Then he led off in the 11th with a single to right field, promptly stole 
second against a left-hander with the best move to first on our club, and 
scored the winning run. A couple days before that, he hit a three-run home run 
in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I think with him batting leadoff, it gives us a great chance to get on the 
board fast -- and, hopefully, often." 
</P>
<P>
So, someone asked La Russa, does this mean Kansas City Manager John Wathan has 
been batting Bo in the wrong spot all along? 
</P>
<P>
La Russa smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"If John had the eight guys I have batting behind Bo, he'd consider it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Then La Russa looked across the dais and spotted San Francisco's Rick Reuschel, 
the National League's starting pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to make that starting pitcher uncomfortable right away," La Russa 
said. "And if you have to face Bo Jackson and Wade Boggs and Kirby Puckett in 
the first inning, I don't think Rick's going to be that comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City pitcher Mark Gubicza, the other half of the Royals' All-Star 
contingent, thinks it's a great idea. 
</P>
<P>
"Amazing," Gubicza said. "That gives him an extra at-bat and makes him that 
much more dangerous. Any time you can combine that power and that speed . . . 
he's like a Rickey Henderson. Once he gets moving, no one is as quick as him." 
</P>
<P>
And what does Bo think about it? 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter," he said, dismissing the commotion in typical Bo style. "I 
think you guys make more of an issue out of it than anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Not that Bo doesn't think he's up to the task. 
</P>
<P>
Bo Jackson, as Bo Jackson likes to call himself, is capable of many things. 
</P>
<P>
"People in general, they don't know Bo," Bo said. "I've been knowin' Bo for 26 
years. I know what Bo can do. I know what Bo can't do. 
</P>
<P>
"Bo can play football. Bo can play baseball. Bo don't know a damn thing about 
basketball." 
</P>
<P>
And about hockey, the sport he recently took up for the benefit of a sportswear 
company? 
</P>
<P>
"Bo knows how to skate," he confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Monday was an interesting day for Bo. He began it at the morning press 
conference, where NL president Bill White introduced him as "Bo Jackson of the 
Los Angeles Raiders." Then, as the AL's featured attraction in the home run 
hitting competition, he managed only one run in six swings of the bats, which 
drew some heavy teasing from Puckett. 
</P>
<P>
"One home run, Bo," Puckett said. "I can't believe that. One home run. 
</P>
<P>
But what a home run it was -- a blast over the wall in left-center field 
estimated at 450 feet, the longest of the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
He also hit a ball off the left-field wall that nearly penetrated the wall, a 
line drive that ultimately did nothing to help the AL's cause in the 
all-or-nothing home run derby. The National Leaguers, led by Cincinnati's Eric 
Davis, won the exhibition, 9-5. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Mitchell of the San Francisco Giants, the major leagues' home run leader 
with 31, watched this display and could only shake his head. 
</P>
<P>
"He's incredible," Mitchell said. "It's unbelievable how hard he hits the ball. 
I wish I could talk to him, just to communicate. I think we would have things 
to say. Maybe I could have my picture with him." 
</P>
<P>
Back to Rader's question: If no Bo, who is going to bat cleanup for the 
American League? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Harold Baines of the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
This is noteworthy for one other reason. Baines, along with St. Louis' Pedro 
Guerrero, will be the first designated hitter ever deployed in the All-Star 
game. Before 1989, pitchers always had to hit for themselves in these things. 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda, who had taken a lot of heat for some of his reserve selections -- 
Dodger Willie Randolph over San Francisco's Robby Thompson or Houston's Bill 
Doran -- had his starting-pitcher decision simplified by Mike Scott's hamstring 
injury. With Scott, the only 14-game winner in baseball unavailable tonight, 
Lasorda handed the assignment to Reuschel, who's 12-3 with a 2.12 earned-run 
average. 
</P>
<P>
More speculation surrounded La Russa's selection. When it came down to the 
final cut, La Russa said he considered three names -- Texas' Ryan, who had some 
of his finest moments in Anaheim Stadium; the Angels' Chuck Finley, another 
hometown favorite; and Oakland's Stewart, the AL leader in wins at 13-4. 
</P>
<P>
Finley was asked what it meant to have made the Final Three? 
</P>
<P>
"It means Dave's starting," he said followed by a grin. 
</P>
<P>
La Russa said there was more to the decision than simply the time-honored 
practice of going with your own guy. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely thought long and hard about Nolan," La Russa said. "Considering 
his career, he would've been a real good choice. But I feel good about going 
with Stew." 
</P>
<P>
So does Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
"I just happen to be selected starting pitcher by my own manager," Stewart 
said. "That's not fishy. That's real. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"They can criticize, but when you look at the numbers, there aren't many guys 
who've led the league in wins who haven't started." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, when asked about it, was diplomatic. 
</P>
<P>
"You know," he drawled, "I think they made the right choice. . . . Every 
pitcher here would like to start. No one's more deserving than Stewart." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Ryan said, his moment in the Anaheim sun came last Thursday, when he 
shut out his old team in his first Anaheim Stadium appearance since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"That game was the really special one," Ryan said. "(Tonight's crowd) is more 
of a national crowd. That one was an Angel crowd. That game was one of the 
highlights of my career." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart has one more thing going in his favor as tonight's AL starter. 
</P>
<P>
He's pumped. 
</P>
<P>
The motivation came during Monday's press conference, when Lasorda was 
rhapsodizing about the many virtues of his National League lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"I know one thing," Lasorda said. "When (Stewart) went to sleep last night, 
thinking about the National League hitters he'll be facing, I'm sure he tossed 
and turned." 
</P>
<P>
The comment drew laughter from the assembled media, but only a forced smile 
from Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
"Lasorda has a way of saying things," Stewart said later. "Somehow, he brings 
stuff out of you. He makes that statement about me dreaming about his lineup, 
like I'm the only one (worrying) and they're going to knock me all over the 
park. That's the way I interpreted that. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me tell you, they've got some things to think about over there, too." 
</P>
<P>
And Stewart considers himself one of them. Another goes by the name Bo Jackson, 
who, for one night, will go by the title leadoff hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Reuschel, the next move is yours.

SCOTT OSTLER: ALL-STAR GAME; 
</P>
<P>
YOU CAN BE SURE THEY'LL HAVE ONE GOOD OLD TIME TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
They're both way too old to do what they do, but there they were Monday 
afternoon, in center field at Anaheim Stadium. It was the American League 
All-Star workout, under a scorching sun, and they were playing a game with a 
bat and a ball. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan Ryan, age 42, baseball's power pitcher laureate, was darting around a 
small area in deep center field, shagging sharply hit baseballs. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmie Reese, age 83, baseball's all-time fungo king, was 10 paces in front of 
Ryan, swinging his skinny bat like a weapon, working Ryan back and forth across 
the grass like Boris Becker working Stefan Edberg. 
</P>
<P>
It was like old times, when they were on the same team and when they became 
lifetime friends. They both came to the Angels in 1972, Ryan from the Mets and 
Reese from a minor league coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
The first day of spring training, someone instructed Ryan to go shag in the 
outfield. Reese was waiting with his trusty toothpick of a bat, and he fungoed 
Ryan around the outfield for a solid half hour without so much as a 10-second 
break. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hitting 'em all over the park," Reese said Monday, smiling. "We finished 
and Nolan asked someone, 'Who the hell is that fella? He's going to kill me the 
first day.' " 
</P>
<P>
By the time the season started, the two were in the habit of grabbing a cab 
together to get to the ballpark early, before the rest of the team, to have 
time for extra outfield work. Even on days Ryan was to pitch, Reese would run 
him for five or 10 minutes in the outfield, to help him loosen up. 
</P>
<P>
They ate a lot of meals together, caught a lot of movies, talked a lot, 
developed a solid friendship. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan called Reese "Dunk," which is an offshoot of Donk, short for Donkey, and 
pretty soon that was Reese's only name in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
What did the two men have in common? 
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea," Reese said. "I can't imagine why we became friends. I'm about 
100 years older than Nolan." 
</P>
<P>
Simple, says Ryan, a man with a reputation as one of the game's true gentlemen. 
"Dunk's just a good person. I just gravitated to him." 
</P>
<P>
In '77, Ryan and his wife, Ruth, had their second son and they named him Reese. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, the Angels let Ryan slip away. Dunk stayed on and is still an 
Angel coach. 
</P>
<P>
They remained friends. Ryan still phones Reese frequently, and they get 
together for lunch when they're both in Los Angeles. When Ryan pitched his 
fifth no-hitter, he shipped the game ball to Dunk. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan rejoined the American League this season, and when his Texas Rangers came 
to Anaheim last week, he worked for 20 minutes in the outfield, chasing Dunk's 
fungoes. Joining Ryan in the workout was his 12-year-old son, Reese. 
</P>
<P>
Monday and today, Dunk and Nolan are teammates again, their dressing cubicles 
side-by-side in the American League All-Star team's locker room. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan is having a remarkable season for the Rangers and was edged out for the 
All-Star starting nod by Oakland's Dave Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
Reese is having another remarkable season, too, running Angel pitchers and 
outfielders nearly to death with his bat. His pet project -- "My new bobo" -- 
is a quiet, young, bullet-throwing pitcher named Jim Abbott. 
</P>
<P>
In honor of Reese's seven decades in a baseball uniform, he was asked to throw 
out the ceremonial first ball at tonight's All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
The request took him by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Giamatti (Commissioner Bart Giamatti) phoned me and asked me if I would do 
him a favor, if I would throw out the first ball," Reese said. "I thought it 
was a joke." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' clubhouse this season, remember, is hotfoot heaven, prankster 
paradise. So Reese said to the caller, "What's the gag?" 
</P>
<P>
And Giamatti said, "No, this is serious." 
</P>
<P>
Reese hung up and phoned an Angel official, who assured Jimmie that the 
invitation was legit. Who better for the first-ball honors? Reese broke into 
baseball in 1917 as a batboy for the L.A. Angels of the triple-A Pacific Coast 
League, a team managed by Frank (Tinkers-to-Evers-to-) Chance. Seventy-two 
years later, Reese is still an Angel, still playing a kid's game, making 
friends, epitomizing the spirit of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't a bad player in his day, either. Reese was a fine infielder, working 
his way to the major leagues, playing for the Yankees in 1930 and '31 and for 
the Cardinals in '32. 
</P>
<P>
He also played 13 seasons in the Pacific Coast League. When the all-time PCL 
All-Star team was selected, Reese was the second baseman. 
</P>
<P>
At New York, Jimmie was Babe Ruth's roommate and occasional running mate, and 
he was also befriended by Lou Gehrig. Those were two vastly different 
personalities, Ruth and Gehrig, but Reese hasn't run into anybody in 72 years 
that he doesn't get along with. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, though, holds a special place. 
</P>
<P>
"He's probably my best friend in the game," Reese said. 
</P>
<P>
Reese was sad when Ryan left the Angels in a dispute over money, and even 
sadder when Buzzie Bavasi, then the general manager, dismissed Ryan as a common 
.500 pitcher. Reese is very proud that Ryan has proven otherwise, that he has 
become one of the marvels of sport. 
</P>
<P>
"He's done baseball proud, that man," Reese says. 
</P>
<P>
For 17 years, Reese has been applauding the accomplishments of his great 
friend. Tonight, for a moment before the game, it will be Jimmie Reese taking 
the bow, and his proud friend applauding from the dugout steps.

WALSH REPLACES OLSEN AS NBC FOOTBALL ANALYST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Merlin Olsen is out as NBC's top football commentator and Bill Walsh, who has 
no broadcasting experience, will replace him. 
</P>
<P>
NBC made the surprising announcement Monday night after word came out of San 
Francisco that Walsh would resign as executive vice president of the San 
Francisco 49ers to take the NBC job. 
</P>
<P>
Friends of Olsen have said recently that the former Ram was tired of his 
commentating job and was looking to devote more time to an acting career. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Terry O'Neil, the new executive producer of NBC Sports, had been critical 
of Olsen in the past, when O'Neil was at CBS. 
</P>
<P>
What is most surprising about NBC's announcement is that the inexperienced 
Walsh, who last season coached the 49ers to a Super Bowl title, would 
immediately become NBC's No. 1 analyst. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh will be teamed with Dick Enberg. 
</P>
<P>
NBC had planned to announce the change at a news conference Saturday in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, 57, led the 49ers to three Super Bowl championships before quitting as 
head coach last January. 
</P>
<P>
He moved into the front office and was replaced as coach by George Seifert. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh's business manager, Stefan Kay, in an interview with San Francisco TV 
station KGO Monday, said: "Bill needs a challenge and missed coaching." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh's relationship with 49er owner Ed DeBartolo Jr. began to sour in 1987 
when Walsh was stripped of his title of team president after the 49ers lost in 
the first round of the playoffs for the third consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh's record with the 49ers was 102-63-1. He also was head coach at Stanford 
and an assistant with the Cincinnati Bengals, Oakland Raiders and San Diego 
Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, DeBartolo and Olsen were unavailable for comment Monday night.

TOUR DE FRANCE;

IN THE PYRENEES, LEMOND REMAINS IN FIRST PLACE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Greg LeMond of Minneapolis retained the lead in the Tour de France Monday after 
the first mountain stage of the 23-day cycling race. 
</P>
<P>
He stuck to the leaders along a route that went up and down four mountains. The 
riders finished at an elevation of 4,330 feet along the French-Spanish 
frontier. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond finished eighth in the stage, almost two minutes behind Miguel Indurain 
of Spain, who won the stage in 4 hours 32 minutes 36 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond wasn't concerned when Indurain went ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't for me to ride behind Indurain," he said. "He is more than seven 
minutes behind in the standings." 
</P>
<P>
LeMond was more concerned with how his body would hold up through the difficult 
mountain passes. At last month's Tour of Italy, he faltered in the steep 
stages. 
</P>
<P>
"Today's stage shows that I am in better form than the Tour of Italy," LeMond 
said. "I had a good day, reassuring for me. But that doesn't say that the next 
stage is going to go as well. Now it is a problem of recuperation, for me and 
the others, too." 
</P>
<P>
LeMond tailed 1983 and 1984 winner Laurent Fignon of France, who finished 
seventh in the same time as LeMond and remained in second place overall, five 
seconds back. 
</P>
<P>
Fignon, who many regarded as the favorite in this year's race, thought LeMond 
was taking it easy by sticking close to him and not helping the other cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not for me to push, it's for Laurent," LeMond said. "I have to protect 
the lead I have on him." 
</P>
<P>
Last year's winner, Pedro Delgado of Spain, finished third in Monday's 91-mile 
course over four steep mountain climbs, but gained only 29 seconds on LeMond. 
</P>
<P>
Sill, Delgado has made a charge through the standings after starting the race 
10 days ago almost three minutes behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
He was last in the standings going into the first leg and lost another three 
minutes in the team time trial when he faltered. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Hampsten of Boulder, Colo., was 14th, 2:28 back of Indurain, and lost half 
a minute to LeMond in the overall standings. 
</P>
<P>
Today's second stage in the Pyrenees is 82 miles from Cauterets to 
Luchon-Superbagneres.

BLACK ENTREPRENEURS BUY NUGGETS FOR $65 MILLION 
</P>

<P>
The Denver Nuggets of the National Basketball Assn. became the first 
black-owned major professional sports franchise when they were purchased Monday 
by Boston investor Bertram M. Lee and Illinois sports facilities manager Peter 
C.B. Bynoe for a reported $65 million. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Denver, Lee announced that David Checketts, former 
executive with the Utah Jazz, will become the Nuggets' president and oversee 
the daily business operation of the club. Checketts, 38, also becomes a 
minority owner. But most of the franchise will be held by Bynoe, an executive 
director of the Illinois Sports Facility Authority, and Lee, who in May, 1988, 
was part of a group that sought unsuccessfully to buy the San Antonio Spurs for 
a reported $50 million. Both are black. 
</P>
<P>
"We look on this as a business proposition, but we're also sports fans -- we 
see this as a challenge," Lee said of the franchise that Sidney Shlenker, the 
current Nugget owner, bought in 1985 for $19 million. 
</P>
<P>
Lee is president of BML Associates Inc., a Boston telecommunications firm, and 
a former president and shareholder of WNEV-TV in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Business associates said Lee, 50, earned about $17 million when he joined with 
a group of WNEV shareholders that sold about 40% of the station for $100 
million at the end of 1986. BML Associates, which ranks 27th on Black 
Enterprise magazine's list of the nation's largest black-owned companies, also 
owns radio stations in Nebraska and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
"Lee is an expert at investing other people's money," said Toye Brown, a 
longtime acquaintance who is president of the nonprofit social service agency 
Freedom House in Boston, which Lee once headed. "But he keeps his business very 
much to himself." 
</P>
<P>
"Peter and I are the largest shareholders," Lee said. "There will be some other 
people involved, but I don't think it's appropriate to give the ownership 
breakdown."

STRUGGLING GUIDRY AGREES TO RETIRE, NEWSPAPER REPORTS

New York Yankee pitcher Ron Guidry has agreed to retire and will formally 
announce his decision at a news conference Wednesday at Yankee Stadium, the New 
York Times reported in Tuesday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
Guidry, who turns 39 next month, has been plagued by shoulder and elbow 
problems in recent years. He began the season on the disabled list after 
undergoing surgery March 17 to have a bone chip removed from his elbow. He 
pitched in seven games this season with Columbus, Ohio, the Yankees' triple-A 
team. He was 1-5 with a 4.18 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
Citing a source close to the team, the newspaper said Guidry was told by Yankee 
officials that he would not be brought back to the major league roster. 
</P>
<P>
Guidry has a 170-91 record and a 3.29 ERA in 14 seasons, all with the Yankees, 
but is 16-23 since he went 22-6 in 1985. He won 20 or more games three times, 
including a 25-3 record in 1978 when he won the American League Cy Young Award. 
He had a 2-1 record in three American League playoffs and was 3-1 in World 
Series play.

<P>
With the leaders arriving in the 2,225-mile Los Angeles-to-Honolulu Transpac 
yacht race, crews are awaiting adjusted results with handicap times taken into 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Although Silver Bullet was first to finish in the Class A fleet, her handicap 
lead was short-lived as Taxi Dancer, third to finish, saved time allowance and 
took over first in Class A and in fleet. 
</P>
<P>
As of the 8 a.m. Monday roll call, the Class C yacht Medicine Man, still 334 
miles from the finish at Diamond Head, has a chance to beat Taxi Dancer for the 
overall corrected time victory. The results depend largely on the wind. 
</P>
<P>
By late Monday, only 24 of the 46 starters had finished; final results may not 
be known before Wednesday. ALMON LOCKABEY

PAPER MILL FIGHTS EPA CONTROLS; 
</P>
<P>
JOBS VS. POLLUTION: 2 STATES CLASH OVER RIVER CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
HARTFORD, Tenn. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was a time when the 75-mile-long Pigeon River was an ideal spot for 
catching trout, taking a swim, drawing drinking water and performing church 
baptisms. 
</P>
<P>
Rising in the majestic Great Smoky Mountains of western North Carolina, the 
stream flowed crisp and clean over a pebbly bed in a northwesterly direction 
until it joined the French Broad River near Knoxville in eastern Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
But all that was before the Champion paper company built a pulp mill in the 
early 1900s in the North Carolina community of Canton, about 20 miles 
downstream from the Pigeon's headwaters. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as a result of eight decades of pollution, beyond Canton the once-pristine 
river has become a fetid sewer that Tennesseans say looks like Coca-Cola, 
smells like rotten eggs and is laced with potent carcinogenic dioxins. 
</P>
<P>
Tennesseans have been trying for decades to get Champion to clean up its 
operations, claiming that the mill -- now a major producer of paper for juice 
and milk cartons and for envelopes -- is responsible for the pollution and a 
hazard to their health and economic well-being. 
</P>
<P>
In Hartford, a river hamlet of about 780 residents five miles west of the North 
Carolina border, townspeople blame the poisons in the stream for a rash of 
cancer deaths in recent decades. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had 167 deaths from cancer in the past 20 to 30 years," said Mary Woody, 
postmaster of the town that local residents have grimly dubbed "Widowville." 
</P>
<P>
Added 81-year-old Margaret Jenkins: "My husband died from cancer on his 71st 
birthday in 1977, and I can look out my kitchen window and see half a dozen 
other homes where there's been cancer deaths. There's been so many died with 
it, it's a tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
In Newport, a town of 7,580 residents about 15 miles farther downstream, 
environmental activists say fish taken from the river show high levels of 
dioxin, often have missing eyes and fins and are covered with unsightly sores. 
The town long ago stopped using the Pigeon for its municipal water. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, prodded by Tennessee, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
stepped into the dispute and attempted to impose more stringent waste-water 
discharge requirements on the Champion plant. 
</P>
<P>
But the agency's action set off a classic jobs vs. environment controversy that 
has since turned into a diminutive War Between the States. 
</P>
<P>
Champion, whose Canton mill is the largest single employer in hard-pressed 
western North Carolina, contends that the only way it can meet the EPA's 
proposed standards is to reduce its operations and cut its nearly 2,000-person 
work force in half. 
</P>
<P>
To North Carolinians, that spells economic disaster. Champion pumps almost $210 
million into the regional economy, including more than $96 million in employee 
wages and benefits. About $600,000 of Canton's $3.75-million annual operating 
budget comes from Champion's city taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"This town would be dead without Champion," said Roy Lee McCord, 53, of Canton. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Governors Clash 
</P>
<P>
In the dispute, the governors of Tennessee and North Carolina have traded harsh 
words, North Carolina legislators have attempted to ban the sale of Tennessee 
sippin' whiskey within their state's borders and environmental activists have 
become the objects of death threats. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than 175,000 letters have been sent to the EPA's regional 
office in Atlanta from partisans on both sides of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The battle has been fought in federal courts and has even raged in the halls of 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"In all my experience, there's never been an issue quite like this," said Fritz 
Wagener, regional EPA water quality standards coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
The feud erupted in May, 1985. North Carolina had routinely approved the 
renewal of Champion's waste-water discharge permit. But after complaints by 
environmental activists and state officials in Tennessee, the EPA vetoed the 
permit -- the first time in its history that the agency had ever overridden a 
state's authority to issue such permits. 
</P>
<P>
Champion filed a federal lawsuit challenging the EPA veto. In December, 1986, 
U.S. District Judge David Sentelle in Asheville, N.C., upheld the agency and, 
in the spring of the following year, the EPA wrote a draft permit that Champion 
said would have forced the mill out of business. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA proposal called for the water at the end of the mill's discharge pipes 
to contain no more than 50 color units instead of the 85 color units the state 
of North Carolina had allowed. 
</P>
<P>
The difference in color between water with 50 color units and water with 85 
color units, EPA officials say, is like the difference in color between ginger 
ale and tea. 
</P>
<P>
Hearings on the EPA's proposed guidelines were set for May but were later 
postponed to January, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protest Movement 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a protest movement against the EPA and Tennessee was formed in 
Canton, which has a population of 4,700. Blue-and-white signs saying "We 
Support Champion" blossomed throughout the town in shop windows, neighborhood 
lawns and school buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"The way that draft permit was written . . . we'd have had to turn the lights 
out and walk away," Oliver Blackwell, a Champion vice president and manager of 
the Canton operation, said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
Dissenting voices were stifled. Rebecca Allen, a former Canton elementary 
school teacher, says that she was given her first unfavorable evaluation in her 
then 17 years of teaching and was transferred to a less challenging assignment 
after she attempted to have her fifth- and sixth-graders study both sides of 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Posters Torn Down 
</P>
<P>
In one clash with school administrators, she recalled, six small posters that 
she had put up in her classroom along with newspaper clippings of the story 
were torn down by the school district superintendent. The posters, which Allen 
had made by hand, bore such slogans as: "Don't Muddy the Waters With Emotion" 
and "Don't Cloud the Issue." 
</P>
<P>
"He took them down right in front of me and the kids," she said. "I was afraid 
those kids were going to think that's how it is -- when you stand up for 
something you believe, somebody's going to come and get you." 
</P>
<P>
She resigned from the Canton school system in 1988 and now is an eighth-grade 
teacher in Andrews, a North Carolina town about 70 miles southwest of Canton. 
</P>
<P>
In the face of such controversy, the EPA consulted with environmental officials 
from both North Carolina and Tennessee and drew up a new draft permit that 
called for a standard of 85 color units in the river at the border between the 
two states. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Canoe Trip 
</P>
<P>
After public hearings on the new proposal, North Carolina officials gave their 
approval, but Tennessee Gov. Ned McWherter gave it a thumbs down. McWherter's 
rejection, which he announced on Christmas Eve, came after he made a canoe trip 
down the Pigeon, from above the Canton mill, where he found a "Class A trout 
stream," to downstream, where the pollution is thickest. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not doing us right," he said, referring to North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina Gov. James G. Martin was livid. "North Carolina is being injured 
by an irrational attitude by the Tennessee government," he said, adding: "We 
don't like it." 
</P>
<P>
Tensions grew; neighborly feelings evaporated. North Carolinians stopped 
shopping in Tennessee and Tennesseans stopped shopping in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
Ronnie Sprinkle, owner of a downtown Canton dry cleaning shop, says he stopped 
using the two Tennesseans who were among his business supply vendors. "Anybody 
who has a governor that acts the way theirs does doesn't deserve my money," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Two North Carolina state senators proposed prohibiting Jack Daniels whiskey 
from crossing the border into their state. In response, Sam Venable, a 
Knoxville News-Sentinel columnist, said that such a ban would be fine with him 
and urged his fellow Tennesseans to join him in drinking North Carolina's 
share. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Mullinix, a retired engineer and president of the North Carolina-based 
Pigeon River Action Group, which was formed in 1983 to protect the river, says 
that he was forced to leave his home in Waynesville, near Canton, after a rash 
of threatening phone calls. He took refuge for the rest of the winter at his 
vacation retreat in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
He says that one anonymous caller told his wife: "You know that husband of 
yours who loves the Pigeon River. You're gonna find him floating down that 
river face down one of these days." 
</P>
<P>
Once again, the EPA decided to redraft Champion's permit. Among other things, 
this latest version calls for a standard of 50 color units in the Pigeon by the 
time the river reaches Tennessee, and for the first time calls for dioxin 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hearings Set 
</P>
<P>
Public hearings on the proposal have been scheduled for August in Knoxville and 
Asheville. Meanwhile, Champion continues to operate under the permit that it 
has held from the state since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Champion officials say they can live with the proposed requirements, although 
it will require a cutback in production and the layoff of about 1,000 workers 
-- about 50% of the work force. It also will require expenditures of about $175 
million in new anti-pollution equipment. 
</P>
<P>
But few residents in Canton and the surrounding area of North Carolina are 
pleased at the prospect of so many permanent layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Some merchants are already feeling the pinch as Champion workers and others who 
make their livelihood from the firm -- such as loggers and truckers -- hold 
back on purchasing big-ticket items. 
</P>
<P>
"Our sales are off about 30% and have been for about seven months," said Hugh 
Yarborough, general manager of a Canton car dealership. 
</P>
<P>
At Canton's municipal building, City Manager Bill Stamey says that local and 
county officials are working on a plan to recruit a manufacturing concern that 
would absorb any workers Champion lays off. 
</P>
<P>
He says the mood in Canton is one of anxiety and despair over the future. 
</P>
<P>
"People with young children are saying: 'How am I going to educate my kids.' 
It's very traumatic," he said. "I've never known a federal agency that's done 
more to heap misery on people than EPA." 
</P>
<P>
Across the border in Tennessee, residents are sympathetic with Canton's plight 
but say that Tennesseans have long suffered while Champion and North 
Carolinians prospered. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Moore, chief administrative officer of Cocke County, through which the 
Pigeon flows in Tennessee, says a study done by Walters State College shows 
Cocke County is losing between $7 million and $10 million a year in tourism 
revenues alone because of the river pollution. 
</P>
<P>
How soon the issue is resolved remains to be seen. Environmental groups in 
Tennessee say that, at the August public hearings, they intend to challenge 
several important provisions in the latest proposed permit -- including one 
that would give Champion the authority to perform the required dioxin testing. 
</P>
<P>
"That's like putting the fox in charge of the chicken coop," said Fran 
Ketterman of Newport, secretary of the Tennessee-based Dead Pigeon River 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides in the dispute would like a speedy resolution. North Carolinians say 
too much damage already has been done in the protracted arguments. 
</P>
<P>
For different reasons, Tennesseans agree. "I would like to see that river clean 
just once before I join my husband," said widowed Margaret Jenkins, who was 
born in the same year that Champion built the mill. 
</P>

LABOR'S LEADERS VOTE TO BOLT ISRAELI COALITION; 
</P>
<P>
ACTION STEMS FROM DISPUTE OVER PEACE PLAN; WOULD BRING DOWN GOVERNMENT IF

<P>
Leaders of Israel's Labor Party proposed Monday to withdraw from the ruling 
coalition and bring down the government in protest against a toughened stand on 
Palestinian elections taken by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud Party. 
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Shimon Peres, Labor's party chief, also clarified his own 
stand on elections on the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, outlining 
positions that directly counter limits set by Shamir. Foremost among his views 
is the insistence that Israel be prepared to give up land in exchange for peace 
with the Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Political Storm 
</P>
<P>
If the threat to break up the coalition is carried out, necessitating new 
elections, it would create a political storm here less than nine months after 
bitterly fought elections and delicate negotiations gave rise to an uneasy 
partnership between rightist Likud and center-left Labor. 
</P>
<P>
A rump session of the Labor Party advisory bureau voted 45 to 2 to leave the 
coalition. The bureau is made up of 120 party leaders, most of whom stayed 
away, so it is not clear just how united Labor is in its willingness to break 
with Likud. Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who voted with the majority, called 
for the party to establish its own criteria for Arab elections but to delay for 
three weeks any decision on pulling out of the government. 
</P>
<P>
The final decision will rest with Labor's 1,200-member Central Committee. No 
date was set for a meeting, leaving time for the back-room compromises 
characteristic of Israeli parliamentary crises. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, statements by Peres and other leaders were the fullest expression 
of dissatisfaction with Labor's junior role in the Shamir-led government. Since 
the coalition was forged last December, numerous members on Labor's left wing 
have lobbied to pull out, saying that the stands of the two parties over Middle 
East policy are incompatible. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Likud imposed strict limits on Shamir's plan for elections in the 
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, bringing the contradictions to a head. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not be a fig leaf for Likud. We will not be a fig leaf for a tragedy," 
said Peres, who invoked a Jewish funeral prayer to add: "We will not say 'God 
full of mercy' over the grave of this peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
"In view of the latest events, which seriously harmed the government's peace 
initiative, it would be proper to . . . dismantle the present government," 
Peres added in a letter that will be sent to Shamir if the Labor Party decides 
to pull out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Decision Is Final' 
</P>
<P>
"If there is no peace initiative, the decision is final," Peres warned on a 
later news broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir stunned Labor Party leaders by giving in to demands from Likud's right 
wing to alter his election plan. Under the original proposal, agreed to by the 
coalition government, Arab voters would select delegates to work out a period 
of limited autonomy for Palestinians; final disposition of the territories 
would be left to later talks. 
</P>
<P>
Under prodding from Ariel Sharon, the hawkish trade and industry minister, 
Shamir added several specific conditions: no territorial concessions by Israel, 
no participation in the vote by Arabs who live in annexed East Jerusalem, no 
talks at all until the Arab uprising ends and yes to more Israeli settlements 
on the disputed land. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Likud decision, Shamir has played down the action by portraying it as 
a mere confirmation of previously held positions. But Labor Party officials 
objected, as did U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who termed the 
conditions "not helpful." 
</P>
<P>
Peres unveiled his own, more liberal conditions Monday. Israel should give up 
the occupied land, home to 1.7 million Palestinians, in order to ensure that 
the boundaries of Israel would encompass a Jewish majority, he said. "We are in 
favor of territorial compromise if it brings peace," Peres stated flatly. 
</P>
<P>
East Jerusalem Arabs could participate in the election, Peres said, although 
the vote should not physically take place in the city. The Arab uprising need 
not end before talks with Arabs get under way because such a condition would 
"transmit a veto into the hands of extremists." 
</P>
<P>
Peres called for a halt to construction of five new settlements that Labor and 
Likud had agreed to build when they signed the coalition agreement. "We must 
decide that there is no room for the five settlements at this time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Peres, who also holds the title of deputy prime minister, rebuked Shamir for 
trying to put limits on topics that elected Palestinians could discuss -- 
including the desire for an independent state. "The elections must be 
political, with completely free speech," he asserted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Independent Government' 
</P>
<P>
He spoke in hazy terms of an "independent government" that would emerge from 
the Arab vote. It was not clear whether he was going beyond Shamir's concept of 
limited self-rule for the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
Under Peres' election scheme, foreign observers would be welcome to scrutinize 
the election. Likud had said there was no need for formal oversight. 
</P>
<P>
Rabin, who first broached the subject of Arab elections, had hoped to delay a 
showdown with Likud over details until talks with Arabs were well under way. 
But as Labor rose up against the Likud proposals, he too spoke out. 
</P>
<P>
"The Likud decisions damaged severely the chances of carrying on the peace 
initiative," he said Monday, challenging Likud to find an Arab partner for 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
"If they can succeed in convincing Arabs to come to negotiate when they are 
telling them that (the West Bank and Gaza Strip) will never have foreign 
sovereignty, that we will impose our sovereignty upon all the territory, they 
are welcome to try," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rabin tentatively outlined his own view of how to create an environment for 
Arab elections: a halt to new Israeli settlement of the occupied land, a 
commitment to exchange some occupied land for peace with the Arabs and an 
agreement to later include Palestinians from abroad in negotiations on a final 
settlement -- a condition that could open the way for participation of the 
Palestine Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Likud leaders immediately cautioned Labor against bringing down the government. 
Shamir's top aide, Yosef Ben-Aharon, said that Labor should stay on for "the 
benefit of the nation." Political observers viewed the statement as a means of 
reminding Labor that it could bear the blame for toppling the government in a 
time of crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Housing Minister David Levy said that Labor had done the Arabs a favor by 
creating a ruckus; now, he said, the Palestinians do not have to respond to the 
peace plan in any form. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual departure, the Bush Administration openly intervened by advising 
Rabin and Peres not to be too hasty in pulling out of the coalition, 
government-run Israel Radio reported. Washington has been trying to find common 
ground between the Israeli government and the PLO on settling the Israeli-Arab 
conflict. U.S. envoys have attempted to persuade the PLO to endorse some 
variation of the election plan in order to get peace talks off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
In turn, Washington has pushed for Israel to be prepared to give up at least 
some of the occupied land. The stand put the Administration on Labor's side in 
the ultimate test of the peace proposal. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Secretary of State Baker said that he will send an envoy to 
Jerusalem later this month to ascertain whether the Jerusalem government is 
still "serious" about seeking peace through Palestinian elections. Baker spoke 
to reporters in Poland, where he is part of President Bush's visiting 
delegation. 
</P>
<P>
Political analyst Shlomo Avineri foresaw a double-edged dilemma for Labor: 
Leaving the government opens the party to an unpredictable electoral test, he 
said, but staying in would mean submission to its direct ideological opposite, 
the right wing of Likud. 
</P>
<P>
"My guess is that Labor wants to pressure Shamir to come back to a middle 
position," Avineri observed. 
</P>
<P>
The mood of the country is considered to have shifted toward a hard-line 
position on treatment of the Arabs, at least in the short run. Emotions were 
heightened last week when a Palestinian steered a bus off a highway, killing 14 
Israeli passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Columnist Aryeh Naor argued that Labor's move presents Shamir with a challenge 
to put his party's program into effect or back off once and for all. "He cannot 
keep using the Labor Party to legitimize his program," Naor said. 
</P>
<P>
Both analysts viewed the strain in the coalition as the logical conclusion to 
an untenable partnership. They pointed out that the previous Labor-Likud 
government, formed in 1984, was based on a consensus on dealing with two main 
issues confronting the country: disengagement from the war in Lebanon and 
reducing runaway inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The present coalition, on the other hand, papered over differences on the main 
issue of the day: how to end the 19-month-old Arab uprising and bring peace 
between Israel and its Arab neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"The chickens are coming home to roost," said Avineri. "As long as no one got 
into details, the parties could pretend to go along with each other. But once 
specifics were raised, the government was absolutely bound to fall apart."

DRUG AGENT'S FAKE PASSPORT AIDED HIS ESCAPE TO EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Elusive former narcotics agent Darnell Garcia, an international fugitive for 
seven months until he was arrested in Luxembourg last week, used a fake Mexican 
passport to flee through South America to Europe, a prosecutor in the tiny 
nation said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor, George Heisbourg, said the former Drug Enforcement 
Administration agent, apprehended July 3 by Luxembourg police, was attempting 
to purchase air tickets for himself and his wife, who was waiting in a Paris 
hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
"He admitted the (passport) offense," Heisbourg said. 
</P>
<P>
The bogus Mexican passport Garcia was carrying was in addition to a genuine 
United States one also found on his person in Luxembourg, Heisbourg said in a 
telephone interview. Garcia's wife, Adaline, was believed to still be in Paris 
on Monday, but could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, 42, of Rancho Palos Verdes, along with two other former DEA agents and 
two others, was indicted in December on charges of narcotics trafficking and 
money laundering. The defendants are scheduled to stand trial in federal court 
in Los Angeles in November. 
</P>
<P>
Details of Garcia's seven months on the lam are still sketchy. "Even DEA 
investigators don't know all the countries he was in in the last seven months," 
a knowledgeable source said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, a picture of the chase is beginning to emerge from interviews with law 
enforcement and government officials here and abroad, many of whom asked for 
anonymity. For months, knowledgeable sources said, Garcia's trail was at least 
30 days cold, as he slipped in and out of countries, sometimes changing hotels 
three and four times in a single city. 
</P>
<P>
But stepped-up pursuit over the last two months, particularly by DEA agents 
abroad, closed the net even as Garcia accelerated his travel pace, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"When it concerns one of your own, you become much more aggressive," said a 
Europe-based source who participated in the hunt. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, intelligence that Garcia was taking a train from Paris to Luxembourg 
last week led to DEA agents tipping Luxembourg police of his expected 
whereabouts. He was quietly arrested in a travel agency in the central district 
of the City of Luxembourg just before noon. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia was considered a macho character who had a black belt in karate and 
wrote two books on the subject. At the same time, as court records show, he was 
a frequent international traveler, both on official and unofficial business, 
and knew his way around Europe's major financial centers such as Zurich, 
Frankfurt and Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, 42, of Rancho Palos Verdes; John Jackson, 39, of Claremont, and Wayne 
Countryman, 45, of Walnut, along with Jackson's wife, Barbara, and Sherman Lair 
of Alta Loma are accused in a 36-count indictment of conspiring to set up a 
drug network from Los Angeles to New York. Profits from the drug operation are 
alleged to have been laundered through domestic and foreign banks. 
</P>
<P>
The government is also investigating the theft of more than five pounds of 
Asian heroin with a street value of $7.5 million from the DEA's Los Angeles 
office in 1984 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg was not an unfamiliar country to Garcia, according to federal court 
records. In March, 1988, records disclose that Garcia deposited $320,000 in a 
Luxembourg bank. Then, according to a prosecution summary of his itinerary 
between 1984 and 1988, he personally visited the country the following May, 
about nine months after he left the DEA. 
</P>
<P>
"We are searching for that money," prosecutor Heisbourg said. But he emphasized 
that the task was difficult. "We have more than 120 banks in the City of 
Luxembourg," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One of Garcia's attorneys, Francois Beissel, said Adaline Garcia was permitted 
to visit her husband in prison last week, and then returned to Paris. Garcia is 
being held in solitary confinement. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Heisbourg said that the fake Mexican passport was issued last 
February, and was used by the fugitive to flee from South America to Europe. 
Then, last March, Heisbourg said, Garcia turned up at the French Consulate in 
Luxembourg to obtain a visa to travel in France. "I suppose he got the visa," 
Heisbourg said. 
</P>
<P>
Carrying a fake passport is an offense carrying a penalty up to two years in 
jail, according to Luxembourg law. 
</P>
<P>
Beissel said that his client assured his local attorneys that he left the 
United States "quite normally." Moreover, Beissel said, Garcia emphasized that 
he was not a drug dealer. According to the attorney, Garcia told him that he 
had been a DEA agent, but that "he had nothing to do with drug trafficking." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Beissel said, Garcia asserted he was traveling in Luxembourg on 
legitimate business involving "gold trading." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, Beissel said, charged that he was being "persecuted by the DEA" and 
that he had fled the United States as a result of the "feud between him and his 
former employers." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia successfully challenged a DEA move to transfer him to Detroit and then 
to fire him, defeating the agency in a legal fight that was resolved in 1986 by 
a federal appeals court. Some of his supporters have alleged that the DEA is 
seeking revenge stemming from Garcia's victory, a charge agency officials 
heatedly deny. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Garcia's counsel said, the former DEA agent offerred that "he was 
involved in tax litigation" in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Among the charges against Garcia and the other co-defendants are that he filed 
fraudulently understated income taxes, concealing profits from drug sales. Last 
month, the DEA moved to seize Garcia's Rancho Palos Verdes house. 
</P>
<P>
Separately on Monday, a Luxembourg tribunal rejected Garcia's request for bail. 
Whether he will appeal the decision could be decided today, according to 
Beissel. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Embassy officials in Luxembourg have told local authorities that 
Washington has started diplomatic machinery in motion to extradite Garcia to 
the United States, a process that could take at least a month.

EZELL BOWS OUT IN FAVORED ARENA -- THE MEDIA EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harold Ezell put in his last appearance Monday as the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service's Western regional commissioner in a final news 
conference that played like the hundreds of others he had conducted over the 
last 6 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
Ezell was notified Monday morning by the U.S. attorney general's office that 
his pro forma resignation -- made earlier this year to President George Bush -- 
had been accepted as of the close of the business day. The action by Edward S. 
G. Dennis Jr., the acting deputy attorney general, followed last week's ouster 
of INS Commissioner Alan Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
During his last public appearance for the INS, the high-profile, former 
fast-food executive preached his usual hard-boiled gospel of immigration 
control. But Ezell, 52, also had to fight back tears. 
</P>
<P>
"We are really committed to the people of the INS because they've been 
terrific," Ezell said in a quavering voice that trailed off. "And, uh, that's 
about it. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Quickly regaining his composure, Ezell introduced his temporary successor, 
Robert M. Moschorak, who had been his top aide in charge of the day-to-day 
operations in the region, which includes California, Hawaii, Arizona, Nevada 
and Guam. 
</P>
<P>
Ezell wanted to stay in his post until November, 1990, the end of the second 
phase of the landmark amnesty program. But David Runkel, the chief spokesman 
for the Justice Department, confirmed in mid-May what many were saying 
privately within the Bush Administration: Ezell's days were numbered. 
</P>
<P>
Several ranking officials within the Justice Department -- of which the INS is 
part -- said Ezell's attendance last July at a Honolulu party hosted by 
Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos and accounts of his dancing and praying at the 
affair did not help his chances. 
</P>
<P>
But while Monday's action was not unexpected, staff members said Ezell was 
nevertheless hurt by it. "Somber is the way the office was when he found out 
about it," one INS official said. 
</P>
<P>
Ezell nevertheless went before the reporters and tried to put the situation in 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"You never come into a deal like this thinking you've been appointed to a 
lifetime on the federal bench," he said. "We've got lots of things to be proud 
of. We have served our country well. I've never worked so hard, made so little 
money and had so much fun." 
</P>
<P>
He did not miss the opportunity to reiterate his favorite theme -- control of 
the nation's borders. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have proposed immigration reform in 1982 instead of '86 (when the 
amnesty proposal became law)," he said. "I think that span of time gave us 
nothing more but more illegal immigration without any help to regain control of 
the border. We don't control them now." 
</P>
<P>
The news conference became Ezell's favorite tool after his appointment in 
March, 1983. He used the conferences -- sometimes as many as half a dozen a 
week -- to promote the agency and the amnesty provision of the 1986 Immigration 
Reform and Control Act. He was not afraid to sing Mexican ranchera songs, even 
though he does not speak Spanish, to ballyhoo the immigration service. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, his publicity schemes fell flat. Several off-the-cuff remarks about 
illegal aliens angered Latino activists. A plan to appear in Las Vegas with a 
trained orangutan went awry when the ape failed to show. But Ezell, ever the 
showman, quickly recovered and recruited an Elvis Presley impersonator to 
promote amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Ezell said he had suffered "great pain" from accusations that he was 
anti-Latino. "If you speak out strongly, the cheapest shot they can use is to 
say a person is anti-one group or another," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His temporary replacement, Moschorak, 48, of Anaheim, would like to be Ezell's 
permanent successor. Moschorak praised his former boss for his "progressive 
leadership" of the INS Western region. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Ezell's guidance is one (thing) I certainly personally and professionally 
will remember for a long time," said Moschorak, who has been in the INS for 
nearly 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Word of Ezell's ouster upstaged what was to have been the day's main topic 
within INS -- the retirement of Ernest Gustafson, the INS district director in 
Los Angeles. Gustafson, who also praised Ezell, said he will retire from his 
post Sept. 16 but declined to discuss his plans. 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of the news conference, Ezell seemed to back away his previous 
disavowal of any plans to seek elective office. "I'm open for public service in 
the future," he said in response to a question. 
</P>
<P>
"Elective office?" a reporter asked. 
</P>
<P>
"If that's the opportunity that's right," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
Then, with a "God bless all of you and thanks a lot," his final news conference 
was over.

JAIL RIOT HAD RACIAL START, OFFICIAL SAYS

BANNING 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A riot that engulfed a rural Riverside County jail in flames and left 20 people 
injured was sparked by a handful of Latino inmates who taunted and hurled rocks 
at a group of black prisoners assembled outside a dormitory, a sheriff's 
spokesman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Although guards moved quickly to quell the fracas at the Banning Rehabilitation 
and Counseling Center on Sunday night, the fighting soon overwhelmed them, 
spreading through the compound and forcing authorities to retreat until 
reinforcements arrived. 
</P>
<P>
At its peak, the riot involved hundreds of inmates who broke windows, set 
fires, assaulted each other with makeshift weapons and threw rocks at guards 
and patrol cars parked just outside the perimeter fence. The fighting broke out 
in the minimum-security area of the medium- and minimum-security facility. It 
lasted about three hours and was declared under control by midnight. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears the inmates just seized an opportunity," said Riverside Sheriff's 
Lt. Kim Garthwaite. "After the initial confrontation, things just escalated." 
</P>
<P>
At first, the rampage prevented county firefighters from tackling several 
blazes at the 40-acre facility south of Interstate 10 near the Panoramic 
Highway to Idyllwild. Because of the delay, seven of the compound's buildings 
-- including the kitchen, a medical unit and an office containing some inmate 
records -- were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen inmates suffered minor injuries and smoke inhalation but none required 
hospitalization. Five correctional officers were injured and received treatment 
at the scene, mostly for cuts and sprains. 
</P>
<P>
Despite reports from jittery residents who said they spotted inmates scaling 
walls, authorities said there were no escapes. Nonetheless, many families kept 
a nervous watch through the night. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a gun, but we have protection," said Paulette Kile, 39, as she 
nodded toward a Great Dane in her back yard less than a block from the jail. 
The Kiles sent their five children to stay with a relative outside the area, 
while other families rented motel rooms or bunked with friends. 
</P>
<P>
Garthwaite called the riot the worst of its kind at a Riverside County 
detention facility. A similar episode, also spurred by racial conflict, 
occurred at the jail in the mid-1970s, but there were fewer injuries and no 
fires during that disturbance, Garthwaite said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the worst one anyone can remember," he said, noting that 150 sheriff's 
deputies and police officers were summoned, largely to display a show of force 
designed to deter further fighting. "It's a real mess out here." 
</P>
<P>
As flames lit up the sky and law enforcement officers -- many clad in riot gear 
-- streamed toward the jail, residents gathered on side streets Sunday night to 
watch events unfold. 
</P>
<P>
With helicopters circling overhead, police dogs barking and a hot wind churning 
up ash and dust, the scene took on a surreal look, contrasting dramatically 
with the pastoral surroundings of Banning. From just outside the facility, some 
inmates not involved in the fighting could be seen through the towering 
chain-link fences, milling around recreational fields beneath huge spotlights. 
</P>
<P>
"At first we heard yelling and cheering, and we thought they were playing a 
softball game, like they do on the weekends," said Aaron Enriquez, 29, who 
lives two blocks from the jail on Hargrave Street. "Then we heard glass 
breaking and screaming, and all these (squad) cars started racing by." 
</P>
<P>
"It was frightening," said Beverly Feyer, whose Wesley Street home is about 100 
yards from the jail entrance. "We heard screaming, cheering, windows breaking. 
Then we saw the flames. You start to get a little nervous with them right in 
your back yard." 
</P>
<P>
Although numerous residents said they heard gunshots, officials said no weapons 
were used to control the riot. Garthwaite said sounds resembling gunfire may 
have been caused by exploding gas tanks or pressurized canisters. 
</P>
<P>
The low-security center, which was built in 1929 and was for decades a 
camp-like facility for work crews, houses inmates serving misdemeanor 
sentences. It has 784 beds and had a population of 653 men and 113 women 
monitored by 12 civilian guards on Sunday. Officials said hundreds took part in 
the riot. They said it was not known if women were among the rioters. 
</P>
<P>
Garthwaite said felony charges including arson, assault and inciting a riot 
would be filed against instigators if they could be found. 
</P>
<P>
He said skirmishes between Latinos and blacks increased earlier in the year at 
the jail and prompted authorities to relocate about two dozen inmates. But 
there were no apparent problems leading up to Sunday's riot. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you get large numbers of people in a custody situation, you get 
trouble," Garthwaite said. "But because of the (population) profile of this 
facility, it has been mellower than many of our jails." 
</P>
<P>
Longtime residents, however, view their neighborhood as anything but mellow and 
say problems at the jail have increased since it was expanded two years ago to 
house an additional 384 people including, for the first time, medium-security 
inmates. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't worry when it was like a camp, for drunks and people who don't pay 
their tickets," said Lloyd Neubauer, who has lived in the neighborhood since 
1961. "But now it seems like they have a lot of hard-core guys, and the 
security system isn't what it should be." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Neubauer and others said friends who work inside the jail have 
told them that high-risk inmates have been housed there, a claim the Sheriff's 
Department denies. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not built for that," Capt. Jake Bowser said. "There has been talk about 
placing some maximum-security people there, but it has not occurred." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, sheriff's officials transferred about half of the jail's inmates to 
other detention facilities in Riverside and San Bernardino counties. The move 
was designed to defuse tensions and ease the burden on staff as they clean up 
and rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the lock-down declared when the riot broke out remained in effect, 
with inmates confined to their dormitories.

What to do about Oakland? Here is a city with a serious case of unrequited 
love. Seven years after the Raiders walked out and abandoned the city for L.A., 
Oakland refuses to forget. The sad evidence is everywhere: 
</P>
<P>
* This spring, when the errant Raiders announced that they would come home to 
the Oakland Coliseum for one game only, every seat in the stadium was sold in 2 
1/2 hours. Mind you, this rush to the stadium was produced by a meaningless 
exhibition match to be played in the heat of August. 
</P>
<P>
* The hottest newspaper in town is a little rag known as the Sportspage News. 
Perhaps unique in all journalism, the News covers every game, every player 
trade, every nuance of one team only: the jilting Raiders. With virtually no 
promotion and no support from the team itself, the News now has a paid 
circulation of 23,000. 
</P>
<P>
* Earlier this year, when the Oakland Coliseum board proved reluctant to make 
an offer for the Raiders' return, a coalition of furious fans threatened to put 
the issue on the city ballot and collected 48,000 signatures just to show they 
meant it. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe poor Oakland is telling us something. Other cities, after all, give up 
pretty quick when their sports teams take a walk. Their ardor cools and soon 
turns to scorn or, worse yet, mere indifference. Does New Orleans remember the 
Jazz? Does Baltimore root for the Colts? Does anyone even know where the NBA's 
Kings played before Sacramento? 
</P>
<P>
But Oakland is different, and most likely for good reason. Some teams simply 
belong to one city; they flourish there and the whole thing works like a good 
marriage. There are not many of these matches, just like there are not that 
many good marriages, so when you have one it is best to hang on. And that, I 
think, is the situation we have here. 
</P>
<P>
Just consider Oakland. This is a city that has always lived in the shadow of 
San Francisco. Oakland never got the glamour jobs or the big money. While San 
Franciscans shuffled paper in their skyscrapers, Oakland was left with the 
heavy lifting, the railroad jobs and merchant shipping jobs. After World War 
II, its downtown fell into squalor and Oakland seemed headed for a future as 
bleak as Detroit's. 
</P>
<P>
But that didn't happen. In 1963, the Raiders showed up and they were outsiders, 
too. The Raiders were a bunch of big bruisers with no finesse whatsoever, just 
like Oakland. Even the team colors seemed right; silver and black matched the 
Oakland grime. 
</P>
<P>
And the Raiders won and won. By the end of the Oakland period, the Raiders had 
become the most successful team in NFL history on the field and one of the most 
successful financially. They sold out 156 consecutive games, about 11 years 
worth. And Oakland, slowly, began to recover as a city. It became an 
identifiable place, something other than the back door of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Now I'm not claiming that the two are necessarily linked. But let's compare 
that history with the Raiders' Los Angeles epoch. Last year on opening day, the 
Raiders played the Chargers and drew 39,000 fans. That means that the Los 
Angeles Coliseum was not quite half full. And over the last three seasons, the 
Raiders have become just another loser in the NFL. In those three years they 
have won nine games at home. 
</P>
<P>
I use the term "home" here advisedly. Because Los Angeles isn't, and never has 
been, a home to the Raiders. The match didn't work here for the same reasons it 
did work in Oakland. Los Angeles simply doesn't have the heart for a 
blue-collar, outlaw team like the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, in fact, seems to pour out its affections for teams that are quite 
the opposite of the Raiders. Finesse teams, nice-guy teams. It's easier to keep 
your cool with teams like this, easier to keep your distance, and Los Angeles 
likes to keep its distance. Is anyone more polite than Magic? And has there 
ever been a team as easy to like, and as hard to love, as the Dodgers? 
</P>
<P>
As for the Raiders, most likely it's naive to think that they might return to 
Oakland simply because they belong there. Al Davis, the Raiders' owner, still 
may settle his differences with the L.A. Coliseum or, God help us, with 
Irwindale. And there's always Sacramento, hungry to prove itself in the big 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
But the deal reportedly being offered by Oakland is not so bad. The Raiders 
would get an enlarged Coliseum, new training facilities and millions in cash or 
even some waterfront land. That's far more than anyone produced for the Raiders 
in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
And there would be dramatic justice. Oakland, which has scratched and clawed 
its way back to respectability, would be the first city ever to win its team 
back. The Black Sundays would return, and just maybe the Raiders would find the 
wherewithal to be Raiders once again.

13 CARIBBEAN STATES OK PROPOSAL FOR ECONOMIC UNION 
</P>

ST. GEORGES, Grenada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After decades of disharmony and jealous squabbling, leaders of the 13 countries 
of the English-speaking Caribbean -- mostly microstates smaller than the 
average American county -- have adopted an ambitious plan for economic union 
that will brace their economies against the damaging side effects they expect 
when trade barriers go down in Europe in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Until their just-concluded summit meeting in Grenada, the pace toward unity 
among the members of the Caribbean Community and Common Market (Caricom) had 
been slower than the migration of sea turtles that breed on some of their 
beaches. 
</P>
<P>
"But now, we are looking at what is happening in Europe and realizing that we 
are foolish to think that we as small countries can go along on our own when 
even large countries are realizing that they have to get together much closer," 
said Prime Minister Mary Eugenia Charles of Dominica, a banana-growing island 
of 82,000 in the Windwards chain. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Historically Languorous 
</P>
<P>
According to Charles and other Caricom heads of state who concluded a week of 
anxious summit talks here last week, the threat of what will happen to their 
own tiny and fragile economies when Western Europe forms a single trading 
market in 1992 has finally forced the historically languorous Caribbean 
countries to accelerate their pace toward economic integration. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to get down to the nitty-gritty now," said Prime Minister Michael 
Manley of Jamaica, Caricom's largest member, "because 1992 is just around the 
corner." 
</P>
<P>
The free European market could have disastrous consequences for the former 
colonial possessions, which have enjoyed special trade protection on many 
exports -- mainly bananas, sugar and rum. 
</P>
<P>
England, for example, buys two-thirds of its bananas from Caricom producers who 
could not otherwise compete with cheaper and better-looking fruit from Central 
America and elsewhere. Unless special exceptions are made for them, the 
Caribbean countries will lose in free market competition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vulnerable Economy 
</P>
<P>
"If the market 'went' suddenly in bananas, Dominica simply wouldn't be," 
lamented Charles, who has been one of the leading proponents of both economic 
and political integration in the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
To forestall such a piecemeal battering of the tiny states -- whose populations 
range from only 11,000 in the smallest, Montserrat, to a city-sized 2.3 million 
in the largest, Jamaica -- the Caricom heads of state agreed upon a series of 
steps toward economic integration that they hope will allow them to speak in a 
single strong voice. 
</P>
<P>
"With the single market in Europe coming into effect, with the United 
States-Canada single market arrangement and ultimately the Pacific Rim," said 
Deputy Prime Minister Lester Bird of Antigua, "I think it came clear to the 
heads of government that unless the Caribbean integrates its market and becomes 
a single market, then we are going to be marginalized and pushed aside." 
</P>
<P>
Among other moves, the leaders agreed to level their varied and often 
restrictive import tariffs, move quickly toward customs cooperation and 
eventual union and remove all other existing barriers to trade by July, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unifying Stock Markets 
</P>
<P>
They also adopted a plan to unify the region's three stock exchanges -- in 
Jamaica, Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago -- with the eventual hope of creating 
a single Caricom stock market and a free flow of capital among the 13 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
Air and sea transportation among the hard-to-reach countries -- all but two of 
them islands dotted across tens of thousands of square miles -- would be 
coordinated by 1992, and the requirement for passports and work permits among 
Caricom citizens would be dropped. 
</P>
<P>
The heads of government also agreed to establish an assembly of Caricom members 
of parliament as a small step toward creating a sense of cultural and political 
unity among their historically insular peoples. But they are wary of taking any 
direct steps, such as a call for an island-by-island referendum, toward 
political union. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still very early days for that," said Manley, the only survivor among the 
four heads of government -- from Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados and 
Guyana -- who founded Caricom on Aug. 1, 1973. The four founding countries were 
later jointed by Antigua, the Bahamas, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, 
St. Kitts-Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. 
</P>
<P>
Manley spearheaded several initiatives in the Grenada summit, including a 
unanimous call for a U.N.-supervised international organization to combat drugs 
and an international criminal court to prosecute major drug offenders. He said 
he was elated that the leaders moved as far as they did toward economic 
integration. 
</P>
<P>
"For the last 10 years, the idea just collapsed," Manley said. "Everybody was 
so crisis-ridden by the debt problem, the oil-price problem, the terrible 
recession of the early 1980s, that all of the intellectual energy was absorbed 
in individual questions like 'Can the (U.S.) Caribbean Basin Initiative save 
us?' " 
</P>
<P>
"It will take a long time before political unity," agreed Charles, the region's 
only female head of state. "But at last there's a real desire to get economic 
unity going."

BAKER SENDING AN ENVOY TO DETERMINE ISRAEL'S PEACE INTENTIONS

<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Monday that he is sending an envoy 
to Jerusalem to discover whether the Israeli government is still "serious" 
about seeking peace through Palestinian elections. 
</P>
<P>
"We really want to make certain that they are as committed to this proposal as 
they have been," Baker told reporters accompanying President Bush on his visit 
to Poland. 
</P>
<P>
In a new escalation of U.S. pressure on Israel over the issue, Baker suggested 
that the Bush Administration will hold Jerusalem responsible if the peace plan 
falters. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has supported a peace plan first advanced in May by the 
government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, centering on a proposal for free 
elections among the Palestinian Arabs of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, however, Shamir's Likud Party added four tough conditions to the 
election plan, including a total halt to the Palestinian uprising before any 
vote can be held. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Intending to Kill Plan 
</P>
<P>
Baker and other U.S. officials are said to believe privately that the new 
conditions may have been devised expressly to kill the plan by making it 
unacceptable to most Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
They have sought to put gentle but increasing pressure on the Israeli 
government to ignore some or all of Likud's amendments and return to the plan 
as it was originally proposed. 
</P>
<P>
"The four elements that were outlined in the (Likud) party meeting give rise, 
at least in our minds, to a question about the seriousness of purpose" in 
Israel, Baker said. "We've already characterized those (amendments in the plan) 
as unhelpful, so we really want to make certain that they are as committed to 
this proposal as we have been if we're going to continue to strongly support 
it." 
</P>
<P>
He said the Administration had not yet decided whom to send as its envoy to 
Jerusalem. He said that the decision will probably be made this week and that 
the envoy will travel to the Middle East "around the middle of July." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Change in Position 
</P>
<P>
Baker also said that the United States has not changed its position to support 
an international peace conference on the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, an official traveling on Baker's airplane in Asia suggested that 
Likud's move to harden Israel's stand on the elections might push the United 
States toward the alternative approach of an international conference -- a move 
Israel has long opposed. 
</P>
<P>
"Our policy is as it has been -- that an international conference might be 
appropriate at the right time. The right time is not now," Baker said. "We 
think we should continue to pursue the Israeli government's election proposal. 
We have felt for some time that it had a great deal of promise. We think it's 
important to determine what changes, if any, have been accomplished in the 
official Israeli government position by virtue of the Likud Party conference."

PRESIDENTIAL LUNCHEON -- 'AMAZING EVENT' FULL OF SURPRISES FOR ITS GUESTS

"This is pretty strange," whispered Jana Onyszkiewicz. "Some of these people 
had us arrested -- now we're eating with them." 
</P>
<P>
Onyszkiewicz, the wife of the Solidarity spokesman, Janusz, was not alone in 
her amazement at the guest list and seating arrangement for lunch at the Warsaw 
home of U.S. Ambassador John R. Davis Jr. Invited by President Bush were 80 
guests, including Communist Party leader Wojciech Jaruzelski and the top levels 
of both the Communist Party and opposition Solidarity leadership. 
</P>
<P>
In the view of at least one American official present, it was "an amazing 
event," and one that revealed the layers of complexity and strong emotions 
bound up in the Polish political world. 
</P>
<P>
The feelings were evident in off-the-cuff (and unexpected) responses to a toast 
by President Bush from Jaruzelski and Bronislaw Geremek, Solidarity's senior 
strategist. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's toast, touching on a theme repeated throughout the first day of his trip 
to Poland, saluted not just Solidarity and the government leadership but the 
reform process in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Toast 'to People of Poland' 
</P>
<P>
"We are aware," Bush said, "of the many difficulties and the economic pressures 
that lie ahead. And your challenge is to rise above the mistrust, to bring the 
Polish people together for a common purpose. The United States will stand with 
Poland; we will support Poland's hopeful mission, unparalleled in your 
history." Bush's toast was to "the people of Poland." 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski then responded, noting that he had been "taken by surprise" by the 
invitation to the ambassador's residence. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider as a significant fact," he said, "that it is here at the residence 
of the U.S. ambassador we could meet in such a pluralistic company. What is 
more, we were able to meet in a friendly atmosphere. And I believe we have felt 
well together. 
</P>
<P>
"One other personal reflection for me: I have lived perhaps 50 or 80 meters 
away from here for 16 years, and it is for the first time that I have come to 
this building and this residence. I think it is also a sign of the times." 
</P>
<P>
Geremek, his response similarly a surprise to White House staffers, then 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
"Poland is still divided," he said, "but it is possible that what is taking 
place right now is actually taking place, that together we have the 
representatives of Solidarity, the opposition and the authorities. We feel that 
what is taking place now, the political and economic reform . . . is in the 
interest of all Poland and not just one particular side." 
</P>
<P>
The words of President Bush, Geremek said, "that the United States will support 
the reforms taking place in Poland, are the words that we were hoping for." 
</P>
<P>
"And for that, let me propose a toast to the President of the United States and 
the United States of America."

NEW ACCORD ALLOWS SOVIET, U.S. GEOLOGISTS TO WORK TOGETHER 
</P>

<P>
Soviet and U.S. scientists reached final agreement Monday on an accord that 
will allow geologists from both countries to work together on a wide range of 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
"Our geologists are eager to get started," Dallas Peck, director of the U.S. 
Geological Survey, said in a brief ceremony during the International Geological 
Congress, which is meeting here through July 19. 
</P>
<P>
Y. A. Kozlovsky, who negotiated the agreement for the Soviets while he was 
serving as minister of geology, accepted the memorandum of understanding on 
behalf of the Soviet Union. The documents actually were signed May 6 but Monday 
was the first opportunity for the scientists to exchange documents and sit down 
together and talk about future projects. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, U.S. scientists will get core samples from the Earth's 
deepest well, which is now more than seven miles deep, on the Soviet Union's 
Kola Peninsula. The Soviets are drilling 11 deep wells, and scientists in this 
country are anxious to study samples from several miles below the surface. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the deepest research well in the United States is scarcely two 
miles deep. It is in the Cajon Pass east of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Peck said that the Soviets have learned a lot from their deep wells, including 
the fact that much of their understanding about the geophysics of the area was 
wrong. Soviet scientists had expected to find the Earth highly stratified at 
such depths, he said, but the well proved that expectation wrong. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Three Projects Approved 
</P>
<P>
Paul Hearn of the Geological Survey's international division said that three 
U.S.-Soviet projects already have been approved. They include geological 
studies of the area between Siberia and Alaska and the exchanging of 
ophiolites, rocks formed at spreading centers where two tectonic plates are 
being pushed apart. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. scientists also plan to study a spreading center in Siberia, and Soviet 
scientists want to look at a similar area in the Southwest's Rio Grande Valley.

PRESSURE RENEWED FOR CAPITAL GAINS CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The House Ways and Means Committee starts working on a tax bill today, with the 
Bush Administration and a number of lawmakers seeking to revive the on-again, 
off-again plan for a capital gains tax cut in hopes of preserving a number of 
popular tax provisions scheduled to expire this year. 
</P>
<P>
The bill is supposed to raise only $5.3 billion in new revenues to meet deficit 
reduction goals, but it promises to set off fireworks over the next couple of 
weeks as the panel members take aim at mostly obscure tax provisions that are 
highly valued by big banks, military contractors, high-tech firms and other 
powerful interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), the panel's chairman, is expected to present a 
bare-bones proposal of his own today that would, among other provisions, modify 
the tax rules on company health care programs, exclude 50% of the interest 
deduction on loans for employee stock ownership plans, extend the airport tax, 
eliminate the remaining vestiges of a beneficial accounting method for defense 
companies and allow withdrawal of excess pension funds to pay for retiree 
health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
But Rostenkowski's plan probably will not generate enough money to ensure 
renewal of popular tax breaks for corporate research and development, job 
development and mortgage revenue bonds, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite strong opposition from a majority of House Democrats that forced 
Rostenkowski to back off from his plan to recommend a one-year cut in the 
capital gains tax, a number of lawmakers are planning to push for such a 
reduction in an effort to raise enough funds to retain the tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
Cutting capital gains taxes is supposed to raise substantial revenues by 
encouraging investors to sell their assets to take advantage of the lower rate. 
</P>
<P>
". . . There's still tremendous pressure on us to go to capital gains as a 
relatively painless revenue raiser," said Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento). 
"I think there are much better ways to go, and that's why I oppose it. But you 
can't count it out yet." 
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski, who first opened the door to the possibility of a capital gains 
tax cut last month and then moved to close it in the face of complaints by 
Democrats, may be wavering again. Although he backed away from proposing a 
capital gains cut in his own revenue package, he has not necessarily ruled out 
going along with the idea, congressional sources said. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush proposed that the capital gains tax -- under which profits from 
the sale of stocks, bonds and other assets currently are treated like ordinary 
income and taxed at a rate as high as 33% -- be reduced to no more than 15%. 
Treasury officials are continuing to fight for the plan, which they contend 
would benefit the economy by spurring additional investment, but most Democrats 
oppose it as a giveaway to the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
On another controversial issue, Rostenkowski is faced with a revolt among 
lawmakers over higher taxes to pay for the new Medicare program that covers 
catastrophic illness. 
</P>
<P>
Under the law, which was approved by Congress and signed by former President 
Ronald Reagan last year, retirees who pay income taxes will begin paying an 
annual surtax this year of up to $800 to expand Medicare coverage. The surtax, 
which requires those with higher incomes to pay more, will first show up on tax 
bills due next April 15. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Rostenkowski so far have resisted pressure from angry elderly voters, 
but Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) has emerged as a 
leader in the struggle to reduce the tax on more affluent retirees. 
</P>
<P>
Tax panel members are starting to look at alternatives to imposing the full new 
surtax on the elderly, aides said. These range from making the new coverage 
voluntary to raising additional revenues from state and local government 
employees by requiring them to pay the hospital insurance part of Medicare 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Such possible compromises are aimed at heading off demands by some lawmakers to 
delay the surtax, which would cost $2.6 billion in lost federal revenues next 
year and much more if it is killed for future years.

PLEDGE OF 'NO NEW TAXES' HURTS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, REPORT SAYS

The "no new taxes" promise of federal and state politicians is a fine campaign 
slogan but it has put many cities in bad shape, the National League of Cities 
reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said that, in the end, local governments are the ones stuck with 
raising taxes and fees to pay their bills. 
</P>
<P>
"The ledgers of local government show the reality of what happens when others 
say 'no new taxes,' " Alan Beals, executive director of the league, said. "The 
burden is shifted, the taxes are shifted and the cities get clobbered." 
</P>
<P>
He said local governments not only have to carry out their traditional 
responsibilities but they have to cope with a growing list "of crisis issues or 
unfunded mandates" from state or federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The league's report showed that half of the 362 cities surveyed are spending 
more than they expect to take in in 1989, and 57% said their income is not 
keeping up with inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-nine percent of the cities increased fees and charges for municipal 
services last year, 41% raised property taxes, 36% reported imposing new fees 
and charges and 10% instituted new taxes, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Beals pointed to new drinking water regulations expected to be issued by the 
Environmental Protection Agency that would cost $3 billion for plants and 
equipment and $500 million a year to operate them, saying the cities will have 
to foot the bills. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas D. Peterson, senior policy analyst for the league, said that, of the 
362 surveyed communities, only 108 reported that they are ahead financially. He 
cited Sunnyvale, Calif., as taking in 10% more than it is spending; 
Winston-Salem and Raleigh, N.C., 3%; Virginia Beach, Va., 2.4%, and Kansas 
City, Dallas and Minneapolis, 0.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Beals called drug abuse and affordable housing the top problems facing 
communities but said they have gone begging for federal money. 
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, we see a massive $285-billion bailout of the scandal-ridden 
savings and loan industry sailing through Congress without much anxiety, even 
though it represents the largest federal outlay since the cost of fighting 
World War II," Beals said.

New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, reopening a door that he had closed last year, 
said Monday that as a public servant he is "obliged to be open to the 
possibility" of running for President. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course you have to be open," said Cuomo in an appearance before the New 
York State Broadcasters Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Cuomo, a Democrat, said all such talk about his political future 
was speculative. Cuomo was widely expected to run for President in 1988, but he 
decided against it. 
</P>
<P>
Cuomo has said that he expects to run for reelection as governor next year. In 
his speech Monday he reiterated that he doesn't believe a person can run for 
President while serving as governor. 
</P>
<P>
Cuomo also said, as he did in 1987, that the Democratic Party would be able to 
find excellent candidates for the presidency in 1992 without turning to him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll think about it . . . but I won't think too much," he said jokingly.

SECURITY GUARD HELD IN POLICE-IMPOSTOR INCIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A security guard suspected of posing as a police officer in order to rob or 
assault at least seven lone female drivers along or near the Pomona Freeway was 
arrested Monday, 12 hours after the most recent incident, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
David MacGregor, 18, who worked as a security guard in the City of Industry, 
was arrested for investigation of robbery, attempted rape, assault with a 
deadly weapon and assault with a caustic chemical, Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Sgt. Terry Judge said. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives began an investigation of MacGregor on Sunday and arrested him 
shortly before 6 p.m. after a brief surveillance, Judge said. He declined to 
provide any details of evidence developed against the suspect, who was being 
held at the sheriff's Walnut substation in lieu of $100,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
A woman motorist driving alone near the Pomona Freeway escaped unhurt after she 
was pulled over early Monday by a man investigators believe was MacGregor 
posing as a police officer, bringing to seven the number of similar incidents 
reported recently in the eastern San Gabriel Valley and Pico Rivera, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Six of the incidents occurred in the last two days, with the earliest known 
episode in the string of attacks taking place July 1, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent incident occurred in Pico Rivera about 4:45 a.m. Monday, 
capping a weekend in which an impostor either robbed, battered or attempted to 
sexually assault five other women motorists. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest incident, as in the others, the assailant wore a security 
guard-type uniform and used a white spotlight to stop a 33-year-old woman 
driving on the San Gabriel River Parkway near Rose Hills Memorial Park. He 
fled, however, when she questioned him about his car, which has been described 
as a dark, possibly rust-colored, Pinto or Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, deputies reported an assault on July 1 that they believe is 
connected to the string of other attacks. In that case, a 22-year-old Hacienda 
Heights woman was pulled over in Pico Rivera and was punched in the face by a 
man wearing what appeared to be a police uniform. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the assailant in all the incidents was dressed in a dark uniform, 
with a dark cap and a jacket with a badge-like emblem. 
</P>
<P>
The weekend incidents occurred near the Pomona Freeway in Hacienda Heights, 
Rowland Heights and West Covina. The assailant attempted to rape two of the 
women and pushed one of them down a 30-foot embankment. But he fled when the 
women fought back. Another woman was robbed at knifepoint of $100. 
</P>
<P>
The impostor aimed tear gas spray at another of the women. In addition, another 
victim was struck four times in the face with a flashlight.

2 POLICE OFFICERS ON PATROL IN WATTS HIT BY SHOTGUN BLASTS 
</P>

<P>
Two Los Angeles police officers, driving their patrol car through a Watts 
housing project, were wounded early Monday morning when they were struck by 
shotgun blasts fired by an unknown assailant, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers Michael Flanagan, 25, and Brad Shea, 30, were treated at St. Francis 
Medical Center in Lynwood and released in good condition shortly after they 
were wounded while on routine patrol in the Jordan Downs housing project, 
Officer Don Lawrence said. 
</P>
<P>
The two Southeast Division officers were driving east on 102nd Street, shortly 
before 1 a.m., when they were fired upon, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"As they drove, an unknown suspect or suspects, shot at them several times with 
a shotgun," Lawrence said. 
</P>
<P>
One round struck the door on the driver's side, sending pellets through an open 
window, police said. The driver, Flanagan, a four-year veteran of the Police 
Department, was struck in the forearm and both hands. Shea, a one-year-veteran, 
was hit in the thigh and calf. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drives to Hospital 
</P>
<P>
Despite his wounds, Flanagan never lost control of the car and drove to the 
hospital, police Lt. Charles Massey said. Neither officer saw the assailant or 
attempted to fire back, the lieutenant said. 
</P>
<P>
After the shooting, police spent several hours searching the low-income housing 
development and the neighborhood surrounding it. However, officers were unable 
to find a weapon or suspects, Massey said. There was no known motive for the 
shooting.

MARVIN DAVIS, J. H. SNYDER JOIN ON HUGE PROJECT 
</P>

Billionaire Marvin Davis, through a real estate development company he 
controls, has become a partner in the $450-million Water Garden office complex 
now under development in Santa Monica, its developer said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Miller-Klutznick-Davis-Gray Co. has become an equal partner with J. H. Snyder 
Co. in Water Garden. The Davis involvement has been crucial in the financing of 
the 1.26-million-square-foot complex, which is located on a 17-acre site at 
Olympic Boulevard and 26th Street. 
</P>
<P>
"Through his efforts, we have been able to get a $230-million construction loan 
with Citicorp (Real Estate Inc.) and Bank of America on phase one" of the 
four-building project, Jerome H. Snyder, founding partner of J. H. Snyder Co., 
said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Talk Over Breakfast 
</P>
<P>
Snyder said he began talking to Davis, who he has known "many years," about the 
Water Garden over breakfast one morning at the Tamarsk Country Club near Palm 
Springs. "This is the largest development in West Los Angeles. It is too big 
for any one person, as far as I'm concerned. We got to talking, (and) we'd 
thought we do this one together." 
</P>
<P>
Excavation for the first phase of the Water Garden, which was begun before 
construction financing was in place, was completed recently. Snyder had elected 
to secure the funds before leasing space in the building. Builders typically 
pre-lease space in a building prior to construction to secure construction 
financing. 
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to get this amount of financing in place prior to having 
leased the place," he explained. "We wanted to build the project prior to 
pre-leasing." Snyder said if potential tenants know they are needed to secure 
financing, they push for better leasing terms. He said the $230-million loan 
now "positions us nicely to go forward with the project." 
</P>
<P>
Miller-Klutznick-Davis-Gray Co. will be responsible for marketing and leasing 
of Water Garden, while J. H. Snyder Co. will oversee construction activities. 
The first phase of the project includes two office buildings, or 700,000 square 
feet of office space, plus 2,500 parking spaces. It is scheduled to open in 
spring of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
J. H. Snyder Co. developed the Wilshire Courtyard in the Miracle Mile area. 
Miller-Klutznick-Davis-Gray Co. built the Fox Plaza in Century City. Davis is 
one of two general partners of the firm; the other is longtime Davis business 
associate Gerald S. Gray.

<P>
AREA'S BIGGEST PRIVATE FIRMS TRIMMING JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Most of the big private companies in the San Fernando and Conejo valleys have 
been trimming their employment over the past year in an effort to streamline 
their operations or simply cut costs, a Times survey has found. 
</P>
<P>
Reports from the 10 largest employers show that eight of the companies, 
including the area's biggest employer, Lockheed, have fewer workers than at 
this time last year. But the cutbacks have not been dramatic; most were less 
than 5%. Only two companies, Walt Disney and Rockwell International, reported 
higher employment at their local operations. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest percentage decline came at GTE, a major telecommunications and 
long-distance telephone company whose California operations are based in 
Thousand Oaks. The company said its work force fell 12% to 4,112 from 4,690 a 
year ago, and it attributed the drop to GTE's ongoing effort to pare its costs 
in the face of strong competition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defense Cuts 
</P>
<P>
Several other big employers are involved in defense-related work and said their 
smaller payrolls reflect the industrywide cuts in employment stemming from the 
recent slowdown in government defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, employment at Hughes Missile Systems Group in Canoga Park fell 
12% to 2,739 from 3,100 a year ago, largely because of "a slackening of 
contracts and a reduction of business volume," said spokesman Hal Watkins. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes is part of Hughes Aircraft, which is owned by General Motors. And the 
drop at Hughes Missile Systems contributed to an overall 8% decline in GM's 
local employment to 7,299 from 7,965 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of GM's employment cut came mostly at the company's car assembly plant 
in Van Nuys, where the work force fell to 4,314 employees from 4,619. GM 
attributed the drop to normal attrition and its unwillingness to replace those 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
The plant builds the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird, sales of which have 
been slumping in recent months. Indeed, GM has announced plans to indefinitely 
lay off about 400 workers next month because it will be slowing production of 
the cars. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lockheed Cuts 
</P>
<P>
Another aerospace concern, Lockheed, reported a 3% cutback to 13,560 workers 
from 13,906. Lockheed is headquartered in Calabasas and has several plants in 
the area, including aircraft facilities in Burbank and Rye Canyon near 
Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed's employment has dropped largely because the company has completed 
work on some airplane contracts for the military, such as production of the 
C-5B cargo plane for the U.S. Air Force, without having replaced those 
contracts with enough new ones. 
</P>
<P>
"We have some encouraging prospects for increasing our production, but that's 
not going to come about until the early 1990s," said James Ragsdale, spokesman 
for Lockheed's aircraft group. Lockheed has won a Navy contract to develop an 
anti-submarine patrol airplane and is vying to build an advanced jet fighter 
for the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
Litton Industries, which has facilities in Woodland Hills and Moorpark, also 
reported a 3% decline, to about 6,400 workers from 6,600. But spokesman John 
Thom said the drop occurred mostly at another Litton site, in Agoura Hills, 
where its Data Command Systems unit is located. The group is finishing a 
10-year-old contract from Saudi Arabia to build electronics products for an 
air-defense system and likely will cease to exist once the program is 
completed, Thom said. 
</P>
<P>
ITT, which also does defense work locally through its ITT Gilfillan unit, a Van 
Nuys maker of radar systems, also reported a 3% decline in employment, to 2,913 
from 3,013. 
</P>
<P>
"We've completed work on some contracts, so we're allowing attrition to slim us 
down until we bring in the next series of contracts," said ITT spokesman Brian 
Eden. "Like all aerospace companies, we're trying to streamline." 
</P>
<P>
ITT's holdings in the area also include the Sheraton Universal Hotel in North 
Hollywood and two divisions that make aerospace-related control systems in 
Glendale and Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
But at Rockwell, whose Rocketdyne rocket-building division has a major facility 
in Canoga Park, employment rose 9% over the past year to 8,855 from 8,100, and 
spokeswoman Joyce Lincoln said the company will look to hire several hundred 
more engineers and other workers. "We need them right now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell is busy with several contracts, including one to build rocket engines 
for a proposed advanced launch system for satellites and other spacecraft, one 
to continue building engines for the existing Delta and Atlas rockets, and 
experimental work on a space station and a proposed aerospace plane that would 
fly at speeds many times the speed of sound, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disney Additions 
</P>
<P>
Burbank-based Disney also added to its work force, reporting a 10% increase to 
4,263 from 3,880. Spokesman Mike Ferguson attributed the gains to several 
expanding Disney ventures, including its chain of retail stores that sell 
Disney merchandise, its new movie division called Hollywood Pictures, and the 
Disney Channel cable-television unit. 
</P>
<P>
Blue Cross of California, based in Woodland Hills, said its employment in the 
local valleys slipped 3%, to 2,782 from 2,875. St. Joseph Medical Center in 
Burbank also reported a 3% drop, to 2,558 from 2,640. 
</P>
<P>
Teledyne, a major producer of aviation, electronic and industrial products that 
has plants in Northridge, Newbury Park and Moorpark, said its employment 
slipped 4% to about 2,600 from 2,700.

A HIGH-CALIBER DANNY GLOVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAT H. BROESKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It should come as no surprise that at the end of "Lethal Weapon 2," which 
opened to blockbuster business over the weekend, the film makers have left open 
the possibility for "Lethal Weapon 3." If it comes to that, Danny Glover has a 
subtext scenario ready for his character, police Detective Roger Murtaugh. 
</P>
<P>
Glover, Mel Gibson's co-star on the first two "Lethal" buddy-cop movies, says 
he sees Murtaugh leaving his wife and his family for a dalliance with a sweet 
young thing -- then coming to his senses, and returning home, before the final 
reel. Meanwhile, of course, he and Gibson's Martin Riggs will slam-dunk the bad 
guys. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you think? Doesn't that make Murtaugh sound just a little more 
interesting, a little more human?" Glover asked, during a recent interview at a 
restaurant in the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, more interesting, and more sexual, a quality of Murtaugh that Glover says 
he feels has been "subconsciously" deleted from the first two films. What's the 
point in casting the voluptuous Darlene Love as his wife, for instance, if 
there is no on-screen attraction between their characters? 
</P>
<P>
"You get a sense, in watching these movies, that these two people do everything 
but sleep together," Glover said, "You know, he could at least be seen kissing 
her. Or holding her. I think that in real life I probably bore my own daughter, 
the way I'm always hugging and kissing her mama. 
</P>
<P>
"But on the screen, well, I get neutralized," Glover says, inadvertently 
agreeing with those critics who have compared the Murtaughs' home life to that 
of a '50s sitcom. "It's an interesting dilemma. It happens to (a lot of black 
actors) in films." 
</P>
<P>
Glover acknowledged that there are built-in parameters to the action genre. In 
the case of "Lethal Weapon 2," a sequel to the 1987 film that emerged from a 
traditionally sleepy spring to gross $70 million, the essential dictate is that 
Gibson's Riggs remain romantically unattached -- and therefore, attainable for 
dreamy female moviegoers. 
</P>
<P>
In interview after interview, said Glover, the question that comes up is: What 
is it like to work with Gibson? It's an easy question to answer -- "A dream; 
He's a great guy." 
</P>
<P>
But to Glover, who towers over his on-screen partner, the question occurs: 
"Who's to say some women don't come to the movie and think about sleeping with 
me?" 
</P>
<P>
With a broad smile, the handsome 41-year-old actor -- who's made up to look 10 
years older for the role of Murtaugh -- added: "I'm not saying that I'm some 
kind of sexy star. I'm saying, think about the way Mel's character and my 
character are treated. Think about the subtleties that happen within film." 
</P>
<P>
Glover said he mentioned his concerns to director Richard Donner, but didn't 
press it. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't go on about it, and I don't think that what happened on the screen 
happened on purpose," he said. "And you know, there are other aspects of the 
movie that I do like. The story embraces the issues (of apartheid in) South 
Africa. And Murtaugh's being a devoted father is very harmonious to me. And I 
like the family's middle-class aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess what I'm saying is that the film could have been elevated to another 
level if it had made the choice to be a little more courageous with Murtaugh 
and his wife." 
</P>
<P>
Glover, a native of San Francisco, lives with wife Asake (the name, in African, 
means "favorite one") and their 13-year-old daughter, Mandisa ("sweet"), in 
Haight-Ashbury. The family home is just eight blocks from where Glover grew up, 
and just 10 minutes from the beach where the 6-foot-4, 220-pound actor does his 
jogging. 
</P>
<P>
"Since we're part water, I feel right about running there." 
</P>
<P>
When he isn't acting, Glover often talks to -- and about -- kids. He is among 
the participants at the NAACP national conference, which is being held in 
Detroit through Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be there to talk about kids, the hazards of drugs and the 
importance of education," he said. "I've always been interested in kids -- in 
working with them in one way or another." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, recalled Glover, when he was 17, and helping to care for a much 
younger brother, "I used to pretend that I was his father." 
</P>
<P>
Glover was tutoring kids when he first discovered acting. It happened in the 
summer of 1966 when Glover, then a student at San Francisco City College, was 
washing dishes at night at a San Francisco hospital, and spending his days 
working with kids in a program at San Francisco State University. 
</P>
<P>
"There was this little room that I had to pass by. Inside, there would be local 
black poets reading their works, and carrying on different political arguments. 
I'd poke my head in, and watch -- and listen. And that was a new kind of 
experience for me." 
</P>
<P>
Several years later, as a member of the governing party of the university's 
Black Student Union, Glover was involved in the student strike that led to the 
formation of the ethnic studies department. He had also begun to appear in 
plays in San Francisco and Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
He went on to train at the Black Actors' Workshop of the American Conservatory 
Theater, and later appeared in a string of stage productions on the East and 
West coasts. Then came bit parts in films ("Escape From Alcatraz") and TV 
series ("Hill Street Blues"). 
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough role came in 1984's "Places in the Heart." Glover played Moze, 
the sharecropper who talked his way into a job on Sally Field's cotton farm and 
then helped her save it. In quick succession came major roles in "Witness" and 
"Silverado," then the pivotal role of Mister, the oppressive husband to Whoopi 
Goldberg's Celie, in Steven Spielberg's "The Color Purple." 
</P>
<P>
Spielberg's adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel was 
criticized by many critics for patronizing blacks and trivializing the story's 
racial issues, but Glover said he was happy with the film. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad Steven directed it," he said. "I think the film represented an 
opportunity for dialogue about the story, which I see as the story of men and 
women who learn to love themselves. Mister's liberation is tied to Celie's in 
the same way that the real liberation -- as human beings -- of white South 
Africans is inseparable from the liberation of black South Africans." 
</P>
<P>
More recently, Glover co-starred with Gene Hackman in "BAT-21," an action film 
set against the Vietnam War. He has also been in several major TV projects, 
playing the title role in HBO's "Mandela" and key roles in PBS' "A Raisin in 
the Sun," the CBS miniseries "Lonesome Dove" and HBO's critically acclaimed 
"Dead Man Out." 
</P>
<P>
Glover just signed with Edward Pressman Productions to star in and serve as 
executive producer on the feature film "To Sleep With Anger," a contemporary 
drama about a middle-class family in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
If his schedule seems busy, it is partly illusion, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"To be frank, I haven't had a lot of offers. And those that I have had, well . 
. . I'm working with my agents to choose roles that are in line with things I 
want to express, as an actor and a concerned human being," said Glover. 
"Hopefully, I'll translate some of my feelings to my daughter, so she'll one 
day step out and say, 'This, or that, is wrong.' You know? So that she'll want 
to have something other than a Porsche and money." 
</P>
<P>
The point he said he wants to get across is that it is the responsibility of 
art -- "all the arts, not just film" -- to change people's perceptions, not 
merely reinforce them. 
</P>
<P>
"The choice," he said, "is whether we exercise that ability."

CRITIC AT LARGE: CATCHING UP WITH THE 'PHANTOM': A NIGHT OF OPERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, Times Arts Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the pitfalls of the critic's life, I discovered early, was having to 
review a premiere or an opening night. 
</P>
<P>
The film critics have it easier. They attend screenings and the review is 
usually tucked safely away before the searchlights rake the Hollywood skies and 
the limos roll up. 
</P>
<P>
For the drama critic, loping off to a theatrical opening night, the tumults and 
the shoutings, the elegance and the noisy enthusiasms are, if nothing else, 
distracting. The level of hypocritical acclaim can be very high and has to be 
weighed since it cannot ignored. 
</P>
<P>
Drama critics increasingly prefer late previews, both for deadline reasons and 
to avoid the glitter and the inquisitive, accusing stares of the first night. 
("Terrific, isn't it, Chuck?" stated with something like menace.) 
</P>
<P>
For reasons not wholly unrelated to the above, I didn't see "The Phantom of the 
Opera" until last week. I went, as I had gone to "My Fair Lady" years ago, in 
the uneasy conviction that it could not possibly be as spectacular as all the 
huzzahs, rapt murmurs and advance sales made it out to be. 
</P>
<P>
But Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews and the Loewe-Lerner score proved to be even 
more wondrous than I could have hoped. And "Phantom" as a piece of theatrical 
showmanship is in a class by itself. 
</P>
<P>
I think that that's the key. Andrew Lloyd Webber, director Harold Prince and 
their accomplices have created a theatrical class of their own, an extravagant 
popular musical theater that is both an extension of but not quite like 
anything we've seen before. 
</P>
<P>
It is opera for those who hate opera and wouldn't be caught dead at 
"Rigoletto." Spectacle is all. "Phantom" is less a book show than a blueprint 
show. The impact of the presentation derives in considerable part from the 
feeling that we're seeing -- live -- the kind of gee-whiz effects only the 
movies are supposed to do. 
</P>
<P>
That damned chandelier does sit above your head with a Damocletian foreboding 
and then does indeed fall, even if with a relieving grace. Those myriad tapers 
do rise from the porous stage; the Phantom climbs around the proscenium and 
bodies disappear on cue. It is majestic razzle-dazzle. 
</P>
<P>
Not a fragment of melody nor a piece of lyric stays with me. Yet there were 
gasps of excitement and thunderous applause when Michael Crawford and Dale 
Kristien reached the rousing climax of their duet, "Music of the Night," in Act 
I. Lloyd Webber obviously has access to the emotional responses of a wide 
audience, even if his skill has more to do with his handling of dynamics than 
with the creation of fresh and invigorating song. 
</P>
<P>
"What it's all about, then?" a friend asked at intermission. Well, it's about 
spectacle, and yet, in "Phantom" Webber has found some particularly congenial 
material -- a love story operatic in every sense, with a central figure who is 
hateful, pitiable and fascinating, a beast with nastier claws than most, and a 
beauty who has more substance and a harder choice to make than the fairy-tale 
norm. 
</P>
<P>
It is not exactly a universal human dilemma to be fretted about on the way 
home. The innocent man hounded by a malevolent cop, and the plight of the 
dispossessed, as in "Les Miserables," catches universality better, although the 
story's emotional force was dissipated by the continuous legerdemain of the 
production, splendidly distracting, and by the banality of the music. 
</P>
<P>
Intention, form and content are about as well met in "The Phantom of the Opera" 
as they can be. It is a crowd pleaser, and our subsequent-night audience leaped 
to its feet, cheering, even as at a premiere.

AROUSING ART; 
</P>
<P>
IN THE FACE OF HOUSE VOTE, MUSEUMS ARE PUZZLED BY UPROAR OVER EROTIC WORKS

In a display case in a room off the Inner Peristyle Garden at the J. Paul Getty 
Museum in Malibu, there is a small statue of a satyr, an ancient Greek 
half-man, half-beast figure that, when closely scrutinized, is obviously 
aroused. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, a vase from about 510 B.C. -- attributed to Euthymides, a contemporary 
of the famed Greek vase maker Euphronios -- is vividly illustrated with a scene 
depicting a couple engaged in what is clearly steamy foreplay. 
</P>
<P>
And in the next room, another vase, discreetly titled "Drunken Singing Reveler 
and His Young Attendant," shows a pretty-faced teen-age boy holding a pitcher 
into which his older male companion is urinating. 
</P>
<P>
Across town, at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, a tall, phallic structure 
by Robert Graham includes numerous explicit scenes of sexual intercourse. Two 
or three rooms away, a couple makes love in the back seat of a 1938 Dodge. 
</P>
<P>
In still another room, Jean-Simon Berthelemy's 1778 painting, "Death of a 
Gladiator," shows its subject complete with pubic hair. Philip Conisbee, the 
museum's curator of European painting and sculpture, points out that the work 
probably was completed by Berthelemy while he was in Rome, studying under a 
French government grant. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the '38 Dodge scene -- by Edward Kienholz, which caused a scandal 
over its content after it was completed in 1964 -- none of these anatomically 
explicit or sexually suggestive artworks has precipitated a single complaint by 
the millions of people who have viewed them in the last five years or so, the 
two museums say. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the Kienholz, said Pamela Jenkinson, public information officer at 
the county museum, "we haven't heard squat since we opened the building." 
</P>
<P>
Among curators at the Getty and at LACMA, this is a source of puzzlement. Why, 
when a single room at the Getty contains a dozen pieces of sexually explicit 
art, has similar subject matter in contemporary art caused such a fuss? Witness 
the ruckus surrounding the late photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, whose 
homoerotic and sadomasochistic work -- except for its medium -- focuses on many 
of the same things the ancient Greeks did. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the single most controversial image in a disputed show of 
Mapplethorpe's work is a self-portrait in which he appears nude, with a 
bullwhip protruding from his buttocks in a fashion reminiscent of the bestial 
detail of Greek satyrs. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, then, it is Mapplethorpe -- whose work received partial 
federal financial support -- who has become such a large part of the arts 
funding crisis unfolding in Washington this week. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute, fomented by conservative congressmen, may reach a preliminary 
climax Wednesday with a budget vote in the House of Representatives that could 
strip millions of dollars from the National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
After all, said Marion True, curator of antiquities at the Getty, 
homosexuality, explicit nudity and a variety of sex acts have been legitimately 
a part of artistic expression since at least Greek times. Tina Oldknow, 
associate curator of ancient and Islamic art at LACMA, agreed, noting that, 
while the Getty may have the explicit statue of the satyr on display, LACMA has 
in its collection a Greek vase that goes even further: It shows two satyrs -- 
masturbating. 
</P>
<P>
Little is known about the personal life styles of Greek artists, said True and 
Oldknow. At that time, said True, artists lacked the social stature they enjoy 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Chances are good, however, that Greek artists -- working in a society in which 
homosexuality, for instance, was accepted behavior -- were people not unlike 
Mapplethorpe. 
</P>
<P>
The battle against government support for controversial art has been led by 
Sens. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and Alfonse D'Amato (R-N.Y.) and Rep. Dick Armey 
(R-Tex.). With assistance from fundamentalist religious groups, the 
conservative congressmen have challenged the National Endowment for the Arts to 
devise ways to control subject matter to prevent funding of art that Armey has 
described as "blatantly offensive to the vast majority of the American people." 
</P>
<P>
The conservatives contend that the national endowment has no business financing 
art whose subject matter may be perceived as sacrilegious or pornographic. 
D'Amato and Armey have said they are not trying to limit artistic freedom of 
expression -- only to ensure that public money doesn't pay for anything the 
most conservative members of art's audience don't like. 
</P>
<P>
"If we take the representations of life that they (Greek artists) have left for 
us," said True, "one has to assume they were familiar with all kinds of things. 
Group sex was nothing new to the Greeks. 
</P>
<P>
"There are certainly representations of people being spanked with slippers and 
sandals. There are people with whips in their hands. I'm not suggesting they 
are equivalent (to Mapplethorpe's photographic images), but I don't think there 
is much that goes on in the contemporary world that would shock a Greek." 
</P>
<P>
"In Greek art, nudity shouldn't just be seen as nudity. It denotes something," 
said Oldknow. "It means as much about something as a person wearing clothes. It 
tells us a lot of things about the figure being represented. Ideal youths and 
their nudity is thought by some people to denote their spiritual excellence and 
their power in their physical perfection. 
</P>
<P>
"The ideal qualities of a male in the 6th Century B.C. would be that he would 
be athletically developed, physically powerful, courageous and honorable. So 
you would have the male figure nude. You don't have nude female figures because 
the ideal qualities were that they would wear fashionable clothes and be very 
demure." 
</P>
<P>
Two centuries later, said Oldknow, the direction of Greek art shifted enough so 
that the female nude is frequently seen. In that era, state support of art was 
virtually unknown, said True and Oldknow. Many vases, in particular, featuring 
the most explicit subject matter, were private commissions. "You would have 
dinner parties where men would gather together and drink and discuss things," 
said Oldknow. "Women who would accompany the men would be prostitutes, not 
their wives. It was also acceptable for a man to be married and have a male 
lover. It really wasn't an issue." 
</P>
<P>
The acceptability of such subject matter has gone through permutations over 
time. In the Victorian age, it became commonplace for a wide variety of nude 
sculptures, for instance, to be draped or for their genitals to be covered with 
fig leaves. Michelangelo's famed fresco on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in 
Rome, completed in 1512, has from time to time aroused controversy because it 
depicts garland-bearing nude youths. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1920s and '30s in the United States, said True, the racy subject matter 
of Greek vases became such an issue that some museums painted over the genitals 
of figures depicted on them. 
</P>
<P>
While the function of nudity and explicit sexual conduct in art has changed 
through history, True contended that the contemporary controversy is 
characteristic of cyclical clashes between fundamentalist religious beliefs and 
artistic freedom that have recurred over many centuries. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's predictable," she said. "I think the problem is that, whenever 
you have a very conservative period politically and socially -- which we have 
right now -- and great interest in fundamental religious ideals, people tend to 
impose them on other people. 
</P>
<P>
"(They seem to say), 'Not only do I not want this, but I don't want money going 
to support anybody else doing this.' It is one of the problems with art today." 
</P>
<P>
To True, such a climate demands courage from museum directors and others in the 
arts community, whose function in such cycles may well be to try to hold out 
against the running of the political tide. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that any museum that is receiving (government) funding should refuse 
to be intimidated by the threat that the funding is going to be taken away if 
government officials who are supporting the national endowment say they don't 
approve of the art," she said. 
</P>
<P>
If this week they don't approve of Mapplethorpe and photographer Andres 
Serrano, whose image of a crucifix immersed in urine also played a major role 
in the current controversy, she added, "next week they won't approve of 
Euphronios and Exekias and the Greeks. 
</P>
<P>
"We have explicit representations of couples copulating. Are we supposed to 
take them off exhibit because someone doesn't approve of them being on display? 
Thank you, I won't do it. When an institution is intimidated by that kind of 
thing, there's no way of defining the limits of it. It is not going to stop at 
modern art." 
</P>
<P>
At least indirectly, True was criticizing Washington's Corcoran Gallery of Art, 
which last month canceled a Mapplethorpe show due to open at the beginning of 
this month. In announcing the cancellation, the Corcoran said it was attempting 
to defuse the political controversy, but the decision itself caused such 
disagreement that the gallery succeeded in potentiating it. Subsequently, the 
Washington Project for the Arts, another private agency that receives national 
endowment support, announced that it would host the Mapplethorpe exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
To LACMA's Conisbee, the current crisis -- which observers of the national 
endowment say is the first in the agency's nearly 25 years of existence 
provoked by the visual arts -- has been intensified by the fact that 
photography is a medium unknown in any previous period of history. 
</P>
<P>
"We tend to associate photography with life," Conisbee said. "A photographer 
has as much control (over subject matter) as any sculptor or painter, but 
nevertheless, (photography) has a kind of immediacy or presence. It seems to us 
not to deal so much with the idea as painting and sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that, if you can imagine some of the Mapplethorpes done as paintings, 
it would take some of the immediacy away. You know that, in the photograph, 
you're seeing exactly what Mapplethorpe saw in his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"I find Mapplethorpe in a way not easy to look at. It takes you into a kind of 
sexual underworld. They are disturbing images." 
</P>
<P>
But having said that, Conisbee strides through a gallery at LACMA, stopping at 
Rodin's "Iris, Messenger of the Gods," executed in 1890 and 1891. It is a 
headless -- but otherwise anatomically explicit -- depiction of a woman, 
standing, legs spread, with one knee thrust into the air. 
</P>
<P>
"Rodin was deliberately playing the slightly sensational romantic artist's 
role," Conisbee said. "He knew perfectly well he was going to shock people. A 
lot of his work has a very autoerotic strain. There were drawings by him that 
were completely explicit. He also acted out the role with his models. He was 
famous for it." 
</P>
<P>
To George Goldner, curator of drawings and acting curator of paintings at the 
Getty, the history of art in terms of subject matter is a meandering stream of 
sorts. "Each period defines what is sexually explicit a little bit 
differently," he said. "There are periods when (sexual content) is rare, if 
existing at all . . . periods when religious sentiment was preeminent. In the 
15th Century, there were very few or no sexually explicit themes. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say that there has necessarily always been sexually explicit 
subject matter, but I think for hundreds of years, there has been. We tend 
probably today, in the 20th Century, to have more of that than was true in the 
16th Century. There are complicated reasons for that that have to do with the 
social role of an artist. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 16th Century, painting was an essential medium of communication. Today, 
artists are a bit more functionally out of the center of society, so there's a 
tendency for the people who practice it to be a bit more unconventionally, but 
I think one can easily exaggerate that. 
</P>
<P>
"Going back to the 16th Century, there were artists who were unconventional. 
There were homosexual artists in the Renaissance. There is no way of telling 
whether the proportion is greater or less now than it was then. 
</P>
<P>
"Mapplethorpe is more provocative than most artists have been. But we've all 
been numbed by provocation, so you have to go pretty far to provoke."

USHERING IN THE 68TH BOWL SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAUNA SNOW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At times, the Hollywood Bowl -- which begins its 68th season tonight with a 
gala opening concert featuring Soviet conductor Yuri Temirkanov and 
Soviet-emigre pianist Vladimir Feltsman -- is a summer haven in which to enjoy 
Beethoven, Mozart and Tchaikovsky. At other times, it is a raucous party when 
patrons are out to have a good time -- even when the music is playing. 
</P>
<P>
But it is the sometimes difficult job of the 175 Bowl ushers to ensure that the 
audience's enjoyment of the music goes undisturbed. Over the course of 60 
concerts this season, more than 750,000 patrons are expected. 
</P>
<P>
"I always tell (the house staff) to do anything to help and serve the patron -- 
as long as it's not illegal or immoral," said Bowl House Manager Raoul Pinno, 
who supervises the ushers. 
</P>
<P>
"This place is quiet whether there's 5,000 people or 18,000," said Pinno, who 
has held his job for 15 years. "Because it's an open-air theater, it looks like 
a place to smoke and drink -- to party. And (the patrons) do, but when it's 
time, the presence of the ushers and the house staff quiets them down. . . . 
Sometimes we have to be a little harsh, but we remind patrons, as politely as 
possible that there's something going on on stage that is wonderful and that 
they must respect that." 
</P>
<P>
But while Pinno said that some ugly incidents have occurred when patrons 
obviously didn't care to be "reminded" to be quiet during performances, he said 
those incidents are not worth remembering, but are only good to "remind ushers 
how careful we have to be." 
</P>
<P>
As house manager, Pinno is responsible for selecting and training the ushers 
(80 to 150 work each night) whose job it is to ensure that no patron leaves the 
Bowl without having fully enjoyed the experience. 
</P>
<P>
When selecting ushers -- who are paid "more than minimum (wage)" and include 
everyone from young teen-agers to senior citizens -- Pinno said he looks for 
qualities such as dedication, responsibility, honesty, an interest in music, 
and appearance. 
</P>
<P>
And beginning this season, their appearance will be enhanced by brand-new 
uniforms -- consisting of blue Oxford button-down shirts, beige slacks and 
button-down sweaters, a navy belt and a red striped tie -- which were a 
donation from Chaps by Ralph Lauren. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past (when ushers wore black and white) it was a very theatrical look," 
Pinno said. "This is more an outdoors look to go with the outdoors atmosphere 
(of the Bowl)." 
</P>
<P>
Pinno, who wears a tux or suit at concerts, added that the ushers are vital to 
the image that the Bowl maintains with the public. 
</P>
<P>
"The ushers are the PRs for the Bowl -- they take care of any need that the 
patron has," said Pinno, who insisted that ushers are trained to treat all 
customers -- from the movie stars in the front boxes to the ordinary 
concert-goers in the very top row -- as equals. 
</P>
<P>
But although Pinno said that the Bowl has "no celebrities," he reminisced about 
Prince Albert's visit to the Bowl during the 1984 Summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was saying, 'Ooooh that's the prince,' and suddenly they all had 
work to do in his area," Pinno said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
While Pinno said that none of his staff fainted from the excitement of being 
around royalty, he does remember a time when many fainted during a heat wave 
that caused both ushers and patrons to drop like flies. 
</P>
<P>
"I had ice water in the tower and . . . wet towels for the ushers. But it was 
so hot that you'd be standing next to someone and they just dropped off -- that 
was weird. We had to carry both other ushers and audience members who were 
fainting down to the nurse." 
</P>
<P>
Pinno said that the Bowl always has at least one nurse and an assistant on duty 
and that he and his supervisors (one for each promenade -- all supervisors are 
required to know CPR) keep in contact with the nurses via walkie-talkie so that 
any medical problems can be handled as quickly and smoothly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the system is so efficient that when a patron sitting in one of the 
front boxes had a heart attack a few seasons ago, "he was carried out and no 
one even noticed what was going on," Pinno said. 
</P>
<P>
While Pinno said the nurses' services have been used many times, he fondly 
remembered one occasion, in which a patron who later had twins went into labor 
while sitting in the Bowl's audience. 
</P>
<P>
"She was that interested in the music, that she didn't care if she had her 
babies here," Pinno said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the strangest experience that he has had in his efforts to keep the 
Bowl's patrons happy, Pinno said, was when a man was leaving the parking lot 
and instead of backing his car out of its spot, drove it forward and hung over 
edge of a large drop. "He was so shocked that he couldn't drive," Pinno said. 
"I had to drive all the way to Malibu to get him home." 
</P>
<P>
Pinno said that the Bowl has grown from a house where 6,500 was considered a 
tremendously busy night, to a stage where an audience of 16,000 "is not that 
big." 
</P>
<P>
"It's grown enormously," Pinno said. "We always have 7,500 people (in 
attendance) minimum -- and that's two nights at the Music Center." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout his reminiscences of his 15 years as Bowl house manager, Pinno 
stressed that he looked upon his position as more than just a job. 
</P>
<P>
"Really it's a privilege to be part of the L.A. Philharmonic," he said. 
"Wherever you go, people know the L.A. Philharmonic; you get royal treatment 
all over the world."

O.C. ROAD, TRANSIT TAX VOTE GAINS; 
</P>
<P>
PANEL MOVES TO PUT HALF-CENT TAX HIKE ON NOV. 7 BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing an unprecedented traffic crisis, the Orange County Transportation 
Commission voted Monday to place a countywide, half-cent sales tax for highway 
and transit projects on the Nov. 7 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The tax would raise $3.1 billion for a far-reaching, $11.6-billion plan to 
speed traffic with wider freeways, additional car-pool lanes, streamlined 
streets and commuter rail service. About $8.4 billion for the 20-year plan 
would come from existing sources, such as the state and federal governments. 
</P>
<P>
The tax would cost each Orange County consumer an estimated $50 to $75 per 
year. It would increase the sales tax from 6% to 6 1/2%. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's decision came a day after The Times Orange County Poll showed that 
public support for the sales tax hike has slipped to 48% from 54% about 11 
months ago, with 46% now against the measure and the rest undecided. The poll's 
margin of error is 4%. 
</P>
<P>
Another survey conducted by pollster Jim Moore for sales tax advocates showed 
Monday that support has slipped from 67% to 61% since March but that the 
opposition is "very soft," officials said. Moore's poll introduced the measure 
as funding "needed" improvements that would help reduce congestion, while The 
Times Orange County poll did not. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners voted 6 to 0 for a Nov. 7 special election to avoid confusing 
voters with Gov. George Deukmejian's proposed state gasoline tax increase, now 
scheduled for the June, 1990, ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the people of Orange County are willing to wait any longer," 
said commission member Dana W. Reed, referring to the 20-year plan. "The wheels 
of government turn too slowly as it is," added Reed, a Costa Mesa lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin Councilman and Commission Vice Chairman Richard B. Edgar said: "Some may 
say this is not perfect . . . but we've reached a consensus. Let's put our 
shoulders to the wheel and get this thing done." 
</P>
<P>
Several members of the audience rose to criticize the 20-year plan's partial 
reliance on additional car-pool lanes, prompting Commission Chairman Thomas F. 
Riley to respond sarcastically at one point: "Thanks for your vote of 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Riley, who was reelected as OCTC chairman on Monday and is also Board of 
Supervisors chairman, said he was frustrated by some critics who focused on 
complaints about separate elements within the plan without seeing the "whole, 
regional picture." 
</P>
<P>
Keith McKean, Caltrans' Orange County director, warned that without the 
additional revenue from the proposed half-cent tax, there is little than can be 
done to prevent the congestion from getting much worse. Orange County 
motorists, as a group, spend more hours in traffic delays than drivers in Los 
Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties, according to a 
regional planning agency. 
</P>
<P>
Without the extra $3.1 billion, transportation officials say, there will be 
sufficient money for only 80% of the $1.5-billion Santa Ana Freeway-widening 
project, 60% of planned local street projects, and maintenance of existing 
transit service at current ridership levels. Construction of three planned 
tollways in eastern and southern Orange County would be paid for with developer 
fees and bond sales. 
</P>
<P>
Officials generally were upbeat, however, since the 20-year sales tax plan has 
now survived a gauntlet of citizens' advisory groups and public hearings over 
an 18-month period. Riley and others said they believe that traffic has 
worsened to the point where most motorists are willing to pay to try to solve 
the problem. Officials have avoided some mistakes made in 1984, when a 1-cent 
tax measure was hurriedly assembled and went down in defeat, 70% to 30%, Riley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The ink was not even dry on OCTC's sales tax ordinance last week when a small 
group of civic activists and business leaders began talking to potential 
campaign managers, such as Sacramento-based consultant David Townsend. One 
possibility, participants in those discussions said, was that former Orange 
County Republican Party leader Lois Lundberg might handle phone-bank operations 
from which voters would be contacted individually. 
</P>
<P>
However, leaders of the group favoring the tax said that no contracts had yet 
been offered and that many more consultants were under consideration, based 
partly on whether they are available for an election as near as Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
The only opposition to have surfaced so far includes Russ Burkett of San Juan 
Capistrano, who said Monday that the growth-control regulations contained in 
OCTC's 20-year plan "are meaningless words," and members of Drivers for Highway 
Safety, a grass-roots organization that intends to turn the election into a 
referendum on car-pool lanes, which the group argues are dangerous and 
ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
County and Caltrans officials argue that not only do car-pool lanes improve 
traffic flow, they are also a necessary element in current efforts to meet 
tough anti-smog regulations and in competing with other counties and states for 
federal highway grants. They also say that OCTC's 20-year plan earmarks far 
more money for other highway and transit projects than it does for car-pool 
lanes. 
</P>
<P>
Under the 20-year plan, about 43% of the sales-tax proceeds would go for 
freeway-widening projects, 32% for regional street and road-improvement 
projects, and 25% would fund transit projects, including additional rail 
service and planning for monorails or other advanced-technology, light-rail 
projects linking various communities. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, the commission must give final approval in two weeks to the 
Nov. 7 election date. The Board of Supervisors has until Aug. 8 to ask 
Registrar of Voters Don Tanney to include the sales-tax measure in the printing 
of the ballots. 
</P>
<P>
The sales-tax plan will occupy 23 pages of a voter-information booklet, 
according to Tanney. 
</P>

Tanney estimated that it will cost up to $1.2 million to hold the special 
sales-tax election. He said that nine school districts and eight special 
service districts will have elections on that same day, involving 50% to 60% of 
the county's eligible voters. 
</P>
<P>
Turnout, Tanney said, probably would be only 12% to 20% in the special 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, the OCTC would pay the cost if the measure passes. County 
government would pay the cost should voters reject the tax.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Westminster City Council has awarded the Vietnamese Community of Orange 
County Inc. a grant of $30,000 to build its Asian Senior Acculturation Center. 
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to begin this month and open in early 1990. It will be 
designed for a daily attendance of 70 to 80 senior citizens. The center will be 
at 1618 W. 1st St. in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Total project costs are near $1 million, which includes $450,000 from the 
Senior Center Bond Act funds, $270,000 from two grants awarded by Santa Ana and 
more than $100,000 from fund-raising proceeds and donations from foundations, 
private corporations and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of our most cherished projects to help our disadvantaged seniors," 
said Mai Cong, president of the board of directors of the Vietnamese community 
group.

ALL-TIME COUNTY HIGH IN MAY; 
</P>
<P>
CHILD-ABUSE REPORTS CONTINUE STEADY RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN O'LEARY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reports of child abuse in Orange County have climbed steadily since the start 
of 1988 and reached an all-time monthly high in May, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In May, there were 1,912 reports of child abuse in the county, while in June 
the number fell back to 1,671. But authorities believe that the recent rise is 
largely a result of greater public awareness of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think more people are abusing their children, we're just more aware of 
the abuse that occurs," said Robert Malmberg, director of the Orange County 
Child Abuse Registry. 
</P>
<P>
"May and October are consistently high peaks for us." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Is a Big Month 
</P>
<P>
Helen Grohman-Collins, a senior social worker added: "May is a real strong 
month because schools are real sensitive to the fact that the kids may not get 
the same supervision over the summer." 
</P>
<P>
The total number of child-abuse reports in 1988 zoomed to 18,844 after the 
number hovered slightly above 15,000 between 1985 and 1987. The figures for 
1989 are keeping pace with 1988. 
</P>
<P>
While the numbers are up, social workers say they believe that they are finding 
out about child abuse earlier than before. "We are usually intervening at an 
earlier level, getting at the first or second incident instead of when it's an 
on-going pattern," Grohman-Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
"Many parents don't intend to abuse their children," she said. "Many were 
victims themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Malmberg added: "Parents often repeat the type of corporal punishment they 
received, whether it's belts or electric cords or ironing apparatus or 
cigarette burns." 
</P>
<P>
He said that in 1988, physical abuse accounted for about 39% of child-abuse 
reports in the county, sexual abuse another 25%, emotional abuse 4%, neglect 
29%, and 3% unspecified. Of the 18,844 reports, 150 turned out to be unfounded 
-- either false or the injuries accidental, Malmberg said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Shaken Infant Syndrome' 
</P>
<P>
In discussing child-abuse problems in Orange County, Malmberg pointed out 
"shaken infant syndrome," which he described as a type of physical abuse that 
is not widely recognized but which can cause serious harm. It occurs when 
infants and young children are violently shaken back and forth, often by 
frustrated parents. 
</P>
<P>
"Shaken infant syndrome . . . is like a major whiplash," Malmberg said, and can 
result in blindness, brain damage and even death. He cited the case of a 
7-month-old child left in the care of his father while his mother was at the 
doctor's. 
</P>
<P>
When she returned, the child was listless, lying in the playpen awake and eyes 
open but unresponsive to his mother's voice. At the hospital, the baby was 
diagnosed as having suffered detached retinas and a brain hemorrhage. Later, it 
was discovered that his father had shaken the baby in an effort to make the 
infant stop crying. 
</P>
<P>
In sexual abuse, up to 70% of the cases are prompted "by some form of substance 
abuse which takes away inhibitions," Malmberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Many child-abuse incidents are one-time episodes involving adolescents and 
frustrated parents, Grohman-Collins noted.

MISSION VIEJO CO. JOINS DRIVE TO HALT TRABUCO STADIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA NEWMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Plans for a long-awaited stadium for Mission Viejo's Trabuco Hills High School 
-- which now shares a football stadium with three other high schools -- may 
again be delayed because the Mission Viejo Co. has joined forces with neighbors 
who do not want the complex near their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Despite objections from a number of residents, trustees for the Saddleback 
Valley Unified School District approved plans in February to build a 5,000-seat 
stadium at the southwestern edge of the high school campus on Cordova Road near 
Los Alisos Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors complained that the visitors' bleachers would be 28 feet from 
back-yard fences of some homes, District Supt. Peter Hartman said, and that the 
games would generate too much noise and traffic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Impact Report Requested 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Mission Viejo Co. took a legal step to try to halt the plans. 
The company filed a writ of mandate in Orange County Superior Court, asking for 
a court order that would force the district to file an environmental impact 
report on a stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The stadium is part of a larger sports complex for the high school that will 
include tennis courts, an all-weather track, a swimming pool and an auxiliary 
gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills High now plays its home football games at Mission Viejo High 
School, about five miles away; that facility serves all four district high 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Because the school district is its own legal entity, it is not required to 
obtain approval from the city for its stadium plans, Mission Viejo city planner 
Chuck Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
The district filed a declaration with the state that the proposed project did 
not require an environmental report because it would not greatly disrupt the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
But residents and the Mission Viejo Co. disagreed, contending that the new 
stadium will create traffic jams and parking problems in the neighborhood and 
that the lights and noise during night games will disrupt the area's quiet. 
</P>
<P>
The district's plans originally called for adding just 38 stadium parking 
spaces to the school's current 405 slots. Bill Bonsall, one of the residents 
who is leading opposition to the stadium site, said that number is not nearly 
enough to handle game crowds. 
</P>
<P>
The district at one point had proposed asking students to ride shuttle buses 
from other locations to the games. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a dream," Bonsall said. 
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that neighbors are not opposed to the idea of a stadium and they 
just want to make sure that the district provides adequate parking, or that it 
builds the stadium somewhere else, even on another part of the campus. 
</P>
<P>
The deadline to file a protest to the district's declaration was July 8, 
Mission Viejo Co. spokeswoman Wendy Wetzel said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not opposed to the stadium," Wetzel said. "We just wanted to stop the 
clock. 
</P>
<P>
"We are saying there have been some violations of (environmental impact) 
guidelines. We are saying, let's go back and do it right." 
</P>
<P>
She added that the lawsuit is unrelated to a Mission Viejo Co. proposal to 
build a movie complex in the same neighborhood, which will go before the city 
Planning Commission soon for approval. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Hartman said he is surprised by the Mission Viejo Co.'s move, because it 
was the company that built and designed the city, even determining where the 
high school would be located. The company also graded the existing football 
field -- the site for the proposed stadium. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Being Considered for Years 
</P>
<P>
Hartman said he is also irked by residents coming around only in the last few 
months to complain about a plan that has been under consideration for years. 
</P>
<P>
"For these people to be claiming they didn't know about it is just absurd, 
absurd," he said.

SURF 'S UP AND DANGEROUS, KEEPING LIFEGUARDS WET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Heavy surf generated by a Pacific storm pounded county shores Monday, keeping 
lifeguards busy making rescues and prompting San Clemente marine safety 
officials to issue a red-flag warning to keep average swimmers out of the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
"At first," San Clemente lifeguard supervisor Richard Chew said, "we had the 
yellow flags out, cautioning people with average swimming ability to use care. 
But we changed that to a red flag about 12:30 p.m. (Monday), when the surf 
increased. A red flag for the average swimmer means that if they go out, 
they're going to get rescued." 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time this summer that the county has had larger-than-average 
surf. On June 23, beaches were lashed by swells three to six feet high, with 
occasional sets of almost 10 feet at Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's unusual southwest swell was generated by a storm in the Southern 
Hemisphere, possibly off New Zealand or Australia, said Rick Dittmann, a 
spokesman for WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times Orange 
County Edition. 
</P>
<P>
Lifeguards at the county's south-facing beaches spent most of the day warning 
swimmers of lateral rip currents and the large waves, which are expected to 
subside to three to five feet by today. Water temperatures averaged 64 degrees 
at Seal Beach to a warm 71 degrees at Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the high waves, Dittmann said no damage is expected because no 
unusually high tides are predicted along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason high-surf advisories were issued," he said, "is for people who walk 
along jetties or go fishing and fail to pay attention. If you don't know about 
surf conditions, you're vulnerable to being swept away." 
</P>
<P>
About 35 people were rescued Monday in San Clemente, Chew said, after an 
"extremely exhausting" weekend, when lifeguards made 114 rescues, with large 
beach crowds drawn by the weekend San Clemente Festival. 
</P>
<P>
In Huntington Beach, just nine rescues were reported, despite surf that 
averaged five feet, with occasional sets to eight feet. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach Marine Safety Officer Marc Panis said rescues were light 
because many people who entered the ocean on such floating devices as belly 
boards were unable to get past the heavy breakers. 
</P>
<P>
"They would get past smaller waves, and then the big waves would push them back 
towards the shore," Panis said. 
</P>
<P>
Seal Beach lifeguards said they made about 20 rescues Monday. And in Newport 
Beach, where waves to 10 feet were expected but failed to materialize, about 40 
to 50 rescues were reported, down considerably from Sunday's tally. 
</P>
<P>
"We had three-to-five-foot waves (Sunday) and almost 150 rescues," Newport 
Beach lifeguard Robert Wyatt said. "The crowd was the big difference. On 
Monday, we had under 50,000 people, compared to about 90,000 on Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
A combination of large waves and shorter intervals between the breakers, 
meaning consistent repetitive sets of waves, contributed to the dangerous 
conditions Monday. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente's Chew said: "A lot of people will look out to sea during a lull 
and see that nothing is happening, so they go in. Then, as soon as they get out 
over their head, here comes a series of eight waves. You hold your breath and 
go underneath them, but average swimmers lose their breath going down so 
often." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day, lifeguards at Huntington Beach used loudspeakers on 
emergency vehicles and at the city pier to announce the heavy wave activity. 
</P>
<P>
"We always try to tell normal swimmers to swim near a lifeguard," Panis said, 
"and if a lifeguard station is open, they should ask about the prevailing 
conditions. If it's dangerous they should try to avoid swimming."

ROBBER'S GUN GOES OFF IN CYSTAL COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A robber's gun accidentally discharged at the J.W. Robinson Co. department 
store in Costa Mesa's Crystal Court before the thief fled with at least $17,000 
on Monday, authorities said. No one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa Police Sgt. James Watson said the lone gunman forced a female 
employee from a credit office to a rear cashier room. After he encountered 
other employees, he took cash estimated at between $17,000 and $25,000, 
stuffing it into a trash can. 
</P>
<P>
"In his excitement," Watson said, the gunman dropped his gun, which went off.

MINOR LEAGUE NOTEBOOK: KIEFER IS HOPING FOR BETTER BREAKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Reilley 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Kiefer sits in his Columbus, Ohio, home, his left leg in a cast from his 
ankle to his knee, and faithfully listens to the Columbus Clippers' 
International League baseball games on the radio. 
</P>
<P>
It's hardly the way Kiefer wants to spend the summer, but he hasn't had much of 
a choice thanks to the cast. 
</P>
<P>
And he just can't stand to see the Clippers play in person. At least not until 
he can play third base for the New York Yankees' triple-A franchise again. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like going there," said Kiefer, who played at Garden Grove High School 
and Fullerton College. "It makes me mad to see everyone playing. So I just sit 
at home and listen to the games." 
</P>
<P>
One can't blame Kiefer, 28, for being bitter. He was hitting .294 with five 
triples and five home runs, and had hopes of moving up to the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping to get the cast off sometime in the next week," Kiefer said. "It's 
ready to come off. I'm not in any pain." 
</P>
<P>
Kiefer didn't deal with much pain for six of his seven years in pro baseball. 
He battled only minor injuries -- sore muscles and ankles -- after signing with 
Oakland in 1981. He never sat out more than a week when he split time between 
the major and minor leagues with Oakland and later with Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
But nothing has prepared Kiefer for the rash of injuries and setbacks he has 
suffered in the last 16 months. 
</P>
<P>
In March 1988, he missed a week of spring training with the Brewers after he 
was struck in the head with a beer bottle in a Mesa, Ariz., bar. He had cuts on 
his neck and face that required several stitches. 
</P>
<P>
Kiefer, 6-foot-1 and 185 pounds, said the scuffle "was a case of mistaken 
identity." 
</P>
<P>
"Some guy was in a fight with someone who looked like me," he said. "He just 
came up behind me and hit me with the bottle." 
</P>
<P>
He had other problems away from the field. His wife, Karyn, had a miscarriage 
that summer. 
</P>
<P>
"This all hit me at the wrong time," he said. "I had a great year in 1987 with 
30 homers and 90 RBIs (in the minors) and then this happened." 
</P>
<P>
Kiefer's problems continued after he left Milwaukee and signed with the Yankees 
as a free agent in November. In his first week of spring training, he popped a 
tendon in his right bicep while batting in a practice game. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, bad timing. Kiefer said he was challenging for a spot with the 
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
"I was having a good spring training until that happened," he said. "But the 
shoulder kept me out three weeks." 
</P>
<P>
But his most crushing blow, the one he's still bitter about, came on June 1. He 
tripled in the sixth inning of a game against Oklahoma City, and, after 
rounding third base, caught his ankle on the edge of the artificial turf. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel anything snap," he said. "It was a little sore and I thought I 
had a slight sprain. I got it taped and finished the game." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors X-rayed his ankle the next day and found no break. 
</P>
<P>
Kiefer kept playing, but his batting average dipped from .310 to .294. 
</P>
<P>
Ten days after he first injured the ankle, doctors X-rayed it again, this time 
applying pressure to the area. That's when they discovered the stress fracture. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking to be called up (to the Yankees)," Kiefer said. "It seemed like 
everything hit when I got to the major leagues to stay. I never had anything 
that kept me out more than a week." 
</P>
<P>
Kiefer tries to think positively. He hobbles to his stationary bike, which he 
rides every day. He lifts weights and plays catch. But he wishes he could do 
more. 
</P>
<P>
"This hasn't been much fun," he said. "I (haven't) been able to do anything." 
</P>
<P>
Although the cast limits his movement, Kiefer has found plenty to keep him busy 
during his unplanned summer vacation. He goes fishing and plays with daughters 
Jackie, 7, and Ashley, 4. 
</P>
<P>
He also stays in constant contact with his brother, Mark, who's pitching with 
Milwaukee's Class-A franchise in Beloit, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
Kiefer often jokes with friends and family about his injury. He says his cast 
was uncomfortable at first, but he has grown used to it. 
</P>
<P>
"There's only one bad thing about it," he said. "It smells bad." 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Helm of the Bend (Ore.) Bucks pitched his first professional no-hitter in 
a 10-0 victory against Everett (Wash.) July 2. Helm, a right-hander from Laguna 
Hills, struck out 14 and walked none to raise his record to 2-0 in his first 
season with the Angels' Class-A franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Helm, who played at Pepperdine, also leads the Northwest League with 42 
strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
The Iowa Cubs have placed former Cal State Fullerton pitcher Mike Harkey on the 
disabled list for the second time this season. 
</P>
<P>
Harkey, a 6-foot-5 right-hander, has missed his last two starts with the 
Chicago Cubs' triple-A franchise because of a cyst on his left knee. He twisted 
his knee in the second inning against Syracuse on June 25.

EX-CHAPMAN COLLEGE STUDENT SHOWED BASEBALL HOW TO MARKET SOUVENIRS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A decade ago, Rick White wrote a master's thesis on the business of baseball. 
Today he is one of baseball's most successful businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
For four years, the former Southern Californian has presided over soaring sales 
of official baseball memorabilia -- everything from traditional caps, pennants 
and baseball cards to more exotic orange Orioles beaks and Angels air 
mattresses. 
</P>
<P>
White is president of Major League Baseball Properties, which licenses 
souvenirs and apparel bearing major league team insignia. The former Chapman 
College student returned to Orange County on Friday for an annual convention of 
350 memorabilia makers, culminating with today's All-Star game at Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
According to sports business observers and competitors, White deserves much of 
the credit for transforming the memorabilia business from a marginal operation 
to a major source of revenue and improving Major League Baseball's financial 
fortunes in the process. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been phenomenal growth in the sale of baseball souvenirs, and Rick 
White has been the main reason," said Brent Diamond, publisher and editor of 
Team Licensing magazine, which monitors sale of paraphernalia sponsored by 
professional sports teams. "He's the marketing force that's driven almost all 
of their recent success." 
</P>
<P>
Major League Baseball turned a profit for the first time in decades in 1986 and 
has remained in the black ever since. From 1986 to 1988, league attendance 
jumped 11.5%, and radio and television revenue increased 33.5%. 
</P>
<P>
But the gains in attendance and broadcast revenues are dwarfed by growth in 
sales of official baseball merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, retail sales of Major League licensed goods totaled $225 million. The 
figure soared to $700 million in 1988 and is expected to top $1 billion this 
year. Major League Baseball, including the 26 teams and the commissioner's 
office, gets about 4% of that total and then divides it based on an undisclosed 
formula. 
</P>
<P>
This year's expanded sales put baseball ahead of the National Football League, 
which has long dominated the memorabilia market, according to White. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Vuono, senior director of licensing for the NFL, said it is unclear 
whether Major League Baseball is now the leader. The NFL declines to disclose 
its souvenir royalty revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"That sort of thing is hard to measure, and we don't release any figures," said 
Vuono. "But Rick has done a tremendous job in centralizing and developing their 
business . . . and most retailers say we're about even." 
</P>
<P>
White, 36, began his career with Major League Baseball after completing a 
"regression analysis" of baseball salaries for his master's thesis at Purdue 
University. 
</P>
<P>
"We figured out that Hank Aaron should earn the most, and he did," said White, 
who had been an all-star catcher at La Mirada High School and student body 
president at Chapman College in Orange. "Sometimes you have to prove the 
obvious." 
</P>
<P>
After a short stint as a public relations officer for baseball's umbrella 
organization and then as an assistant branch manager with Carnation Co., White 
went back to work for Major League Baseball in 1979. He was assigned to Major 
League Promotions, the forerunner of Major League Baseball Properties. 
</P>
<P>
"Things were somewhat sloppily run then," said White. "Commissions varied 
radically, and the league, the teams and everybody else marketed the goods. 
(Then baseball commissioner) Bowie Kuhn didn't want to clog up the game with a 
lot of commercialism." 
</P>
<P>
When Peter Ueberroth took over as commissioner in 1984, however, things 
changed. Under pressure from both players and owners, Ueberroth centralized 
souvenir sales within Major League Baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Paraphernalia sales had been paired with an unprofitable media operation, which 
was spun off as Phoenix Communications in 1985. A former Time Inc. executive, 
Charlie Bear, was hired as a consultant for the new souvenir sales group, and 
an overall marketing plan was adopted. 
</P>
<P>
"We found the money teams were making (on memorabilia), even after a World 
Series, wouldn't even pay for a utility infielder," White said. "Peter allowed 
us to make a change. He didn't tell us how to do anything but said we had to 
create some sort of strategy." 
</P>
<P>
Bear and White worked together to forge a marketing plan, which was designed to 
follow the NFL strategy of centralized sales, publicity and trademark 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
"They got a late start and learned from the NFL's mistakes," said Diamond at 
Team Licensing magazine. "They've seen by far the most growth, largely because 
Rick put together a good marketing program." 
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan, Major League Baseball assumed responsibility for stopping 
counterfeit goods. When the program began back in 1986, shipments of unlicensed 
foreign-made baseball products were turned back at the borders, and retailers 
were assured that they would not be undersold by makers of inferior products 
who cut separate deals with team owners. 
</P>
<P>
Around the same time, Major League Baseball also dumped 25% of its former 
licensees and began seeking more established producers. 
</P>
<P>
In the last 2 1/2 years, the organization has spent more than $6 million to 
police and prosecute counterfeiters. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to establish ourselves as an upper-end producer," White said. "So we 
are opening our own stores and are working with major department stores." 
</P>
<P>
As part of that move, the league last year began sponsoring the Diamond 
collection of authentic major league style apparel and the Cooperstown 
collection of historically accurate uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the league opened five Major League souvenir and apparel stores, in 
San Diego, Oakland, New York, Pittsburgh and Milwaukee. It plans to open two 
more by the end of 1989 -- one in Brea and one in Boston. The stores sell 
parkas, towels, sheets and even wallpaper, as well as more traditional items. 
</P>
<P>
In the future, White said, Major League Baseball Properties will begin more 
joint ventures with players and increased marketing of such collectibles as 
baseball cards and old jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if anything could dampen demand for Major League-sponsored goods, White 
mentioned counterfeiting, over-saturation of the market, and, of course, a 
players' strike. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't play baseball, we don't make money," he said. "It's that simple."

RESALE OF PRIVATE OFFERINGS; 
</P>
<P>
SEC MAY LOOSEN SECURITIES TRADING RULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WASHINGTON

<TEXT>
<P>
The Securities and Exchange Commission voted Monday to seek public comment on a 
rule allowing large institutional investors to trade certain privately issued 
securities among themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The move is seen as a way to attract more funds to the American capital 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
Current rules severely limit resales of private offerings to prevent small 
investors who lack the sophistication to analyze the merits of these offerings 
from buying the securities. 
</P>
<P>
But in the past decade, the private debt and equity market in the United States 
has tripled in size to about $80 billion. The rules today limit buyers, 
depressing prices, and that has led to pressure for change. 
</P>
<P>
The rules approved by the SEC for public comment before the commission takes a 
final vote would allow institutional investors with $100 million in securities 
to buy and sell to each other. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Stock Exchange and the Securities Industry Assn. had objected that 
a flourishing private market would create a dual system, undermining the public 
exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
Bowing to these concerns, the revised rule would apply only to resale of debt 
in U.S. companies, not to stock. However for foreign companies, both debt and 
equity could exchange hands as long as their issues are not already listed on 
U.S. exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
Although the SEC voted unanimously for the proposed rule, Commissioner Charles 
Cox urged broadening the group of institutional investors it covers. 
</P>
<P>
"One-hundred-and-two qualified broker-dealers only are covered in this proposal 
out of about 9,000 listed broker-dealers," Cox said. He proposed allowing 
institutions with $25 million to $50 million invested in securities to join the 
club. 
</P>
<P>
But Linda Quinn, director of the SEC's division of corporate finance, suggested 
waiting for public comments before tampering with the definition. 
</P>
<P>
An earlier SEC proposal last fall suggested allowing institutions with $100 
million in total assets, not securities, to trade among themselves. This 
provoked criticism that a tiny rural bank without investment experience would 
be eligible. 
</P>
<P>
In other action, the SEC voted to seek public comment on relaxing public 
disclosure requirements for Canadian companies that trade securities in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
The reciprocal plan would allow all Canadian companies listed on the Toronto, 
Montreal or U.S. exchanges to file documents with the SEC that meet their 
nation's disclosure standards. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is the first in an SEC plan to make U.S. markets more attractive 
to foreign companies by easing stringent reporting standards. 
</P>
<P>
Both proposals will be published in the Federal Register, and the SEC expects 
to take final votes in the fall.

SHAREHOLDER GROUP TARGETS FLUOR, GREAT WESTERN FOR REFORM CAMPAIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Fluor Corp. in Irvine and Great Western Financial Corp. in Beverly Hills 
have been targeted for reform by the Los Angeles chapter of a national 
shareholder rights organization. 
</P>
<P>
United Shareholders Assn., an organization founded in 1986 by corporate raider 
T. Boone Pickens Jr., said Monday that Fluor and Great Western are among 50 
firms nationwide that have been singled out for shareholder rights campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Association official Ralph Whitworth said the group will encourage large 
institutional shareholders who hold stock in Fluor and Great Western to 
campaign for passage of reform proposals at the companies' annual meetings next 
spring. The effort will be pushed by the Los Angeles chapter of the 
association, which will provide free legal and technical support. 
</P>
<P>
The association, based in Washington, conducted a pilot reform program last 
year with 12 companies and claims to have negotiated agreements with two of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Fluor, a large construction and engineering firm, and Great Western, a 
diversified financial services company, were both criticized by the group for 
adopting "poison pill" provisions intended to discourage corporate takeovers 
that might be beneficial to shareholders but would oust management. 
</P>
<P>
United Shareholders Assn. also criticized the companies for providing corporate 
officers with "golden parachute" severance agreements that take effect in 
special circumstances, such as a corporate takeover, and staggering the terms 
of their directors, thus making it impossible for shareholders to remove an 
entire board of directors in one vote. 
</P>
<P>
The companies, both of which are incorporated in Delaware, were further 
criticized for taking advantage of that state's "anti-shareholder statutes." 
</P>
<P>
Fluor also was given black marks for failing to provide confidential balloting 
for its shareholders. Whitworth said the association's first priority at Fluor 
will be to institute secret balloting to protect Fluor employees and other 
shareholders from the threat of intimidation by management. 
</P>
<P>
Fluor spokeswoman Deborah Land said the company's policies have been designed 
to protect and enhance shareholder values. 
</P>
<P>
She said Fluor's poison pill gives shareholders the authority to decide whether 
to accept a takeover bid. On the subject of confidential voting, she said that 
more than half of Fluor's stock is voted in the name of the brokers who sold it 
and that thus the real shareholders cannot be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Taylor, spokeswoman for Great Western, contended that the corporation, 
whose largest subsidiary, Great Western Bank, operates 280 savings and loan 
branches in five states, "is held in very high regard" by its institutional 
investors "because of our record of building value for our shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
Both Taylor and Land complained that they had not been directly contacted by 
United Shareholders. United Shareholders Assn. said it mailed letters to the 
chief executives at both companies Monday detailing its concerns.

PRINCETON-NEWPORT CHIEF DENIES WRONGDOING; 
</P>
<P>
REGAN SAYS HE BELIEVED STOCK TRADES MADE TO CUT FIRM'S TAXES WERE LEGAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The chief partner in a defunct New Jersey brokerage testified Monday that he 
believed that a series of 1984 and 1985 stock trades designed to reduce the 
firm's taxes were "100% legal." 
</P>
<P>
"I did not commit a crime. I did not cheat on my taxes. I did not engage in a 
conspiracy. I am totally, 100% innocent," said James Sutton Regan, the former 
managing partner of Princeton-Newport Partners LP. 
</P>
<P>
Regan took the stand as the defense opened its arguments in the first-ever 
securities fraud racketeering case. 
</P>
<P>
Regan, one of six defendants in the case, testified that Princeton-Newport 
engaged in a series of "tax trades" in 1984 and 1985 to generate short-term 
capital losses it could claim as tax deductions. He said the trades were 
necessitated in part by changes in federal laws. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my belief that the transactions were entirely legal, 100% legal," Regan 
testified under questioning from his attorney, Theodore Wells. 
</P>
<P>
Regan, 47, speaking calmly and evenly as he explained various complex tax 
arrangements, described deals in which Princeton-Newport sold blocks of 
securities to other investment firms temporarily to claim losses for tax 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The government alleges that the deals were engineered to create false long-term 
capital gains and short-term capital losses for Princeton-Newport in violation 
of federal tax laws. The indictment last year alleged millions of dollars in 
bogus tax losses. 
</P>
<P>
But Regan testified that he was aware of federal laws when he ordered the firm 
to conduct so-called "day trades" in 1984 in which it sold blocks of warrants 
to buy stock in ICI Finance N.V. and bought them back the same day. He said all 
the trades were recorded in the company's books. 
</P>
<P>
He said the deals, which were conducted through Ackroyd &amp; Smithers 
Securities, were subject to market fluctuation and that no prearranged buyback 
price had been set. 
</P>
<P>
The government alleges the transactions were "parking" arrangements, in which 
securities owned by one party are sold to another with an agreement to 
repurchase them usually at a preset time and price. The government maintains 
that such deals are illegal if designed to skirt federal tax or disclosure 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
Regan said he had studied federal tax law for more than 10 years and considered 
himself an expert in the field. He also said he had filed more than 15 
supporting legal briefs about sham tax trades in cases involving federal tax 
laws since the mid-1970s and believed that the 1984 and 1985 trades were legal. 
</P>
<P>
He said he told Princeton-Newport general partner Paul A. Berkman to conduct 
other trades in early 1985 through Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and Drexel Burnham 
Lambert Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those trades involved asking Merrill and Drexel to hold stock in 
various companies for at least 31 days before Princeton-Newport could 
repurchase it, in accordance with federal laws, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him the transactions had to be done within the context of the market," 
he said. "I never told him what the repurchase price had to be." 
</P>
<P>
Regan added: "This kind of tax planning was common all the time. People would 
do anything possible to avoid long-term losses, anything legally possible." 
</P>
<P>
He testified that Princeton-Newport made about $300,000 from the 1985 transfers 
because its payment to other firms for holding the securities was lower than 
its return on investments it made with the cash it obtained for them. 
</P>

Regan denied any involvement in a deal cited by the government that former 
Drexel trader Bruce Lee Newberg told Princeton-Newport to sell blocks of stock 
in COMB Co. to try to drive down its share price in 1985 before a large Drexel 
bond offering to the firm. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Regan, Berkman and Newberg, on trial are Princeton-Newport 
general partners Charles Zarzecki and Jack Z. Rabinowitz, and the firm's 
controller, Steven B. Smotrich. 
</P>
<P>
The case overlaps the government's 98-count fraud and racketeering indictment 
of former Drexel junk bond financier Michael Milken. Much of the same evidence 
is expected to be introduced at Milken's trial, scheduled to begin next March. 
</P>
<P>
Princeton-Newport, a small securities firm with offices in Princeton, N.J., and 
Newport Beach, Calif., went out of business after the indictment was brought 
last August.

<P>
Laurence Olivier, acclaimed as the greatest actor of his generation and the 
20th-Century giant of the Shakespearean theater, died today. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
The triple Oscar winner died "peacefully in his sleep," surrounded by friends 
and relatives at his home south of London, said his agent, Laurence Evans. The 
cause of death was not given. 
</P>
<P>
"His last few days were very peaceful," said Richard Olivier, the actor's 
27-year-old son. "He died in his sleep at noon." 
</P>
<P>
The son spoke from the family home near the village of Ashurst, 50 miles south 
of London. He said a private funeral is planned, followed by a public memorial 
service in London. 
</P>
<P>
Both Queen Elizabeth II and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher sent condolences 
to Olivier's family, praising his "extraordinary talents." 
</P>
<P>
'It's hard to think of a world without Laurence Olivier, and now it's happened, 
and it's hard to believe," said Rosemary Harris, who appeared with Olivier in 
the National Theater production of "Hamlet" in 1963 and in the film "The Boys 
from Brazil." 
</P>
<P>
"He was the greatest actor of this century," said actor Anthony Hopkins, who 
worked with Olivier in two films, "A Bridge Too Far" and "The Bounty." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Tremendous Daring' 
</P>
<P>
"He would hurl himself into the role, and that can be quite dangerous to limb 
and body. He had tremendous athletic daring," said Hopkins. 
</P>
<P>
Charlton Heston, a friend of Olivier who worked with him in the 1966 film 
"Khartoum," said from his Los Angeles home that Olivier "dared to go where few 
others venture." 
</P>
<P>
Flags at the National Theater were lowered to half-staff and West End theaters 
ordered their lights doused for an hour but did not shut down. "That would have 
been the last thing he would have wanted," said a theater spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Olivier's last professional appearance was in the 1988 movie "War Requiem," 
based on the oratorio by composer Benjamin Britten. 
</P>
<P>
Knighted, ennobled and revered by the film and theater world, he was Lord 
Olivier when he died, one of the very few Britons to be given a seat in the 
House of Lords for his acting prowess. 
</P>
<P>
Olivier's first Academy Award was a special Oscar in 1946 for "Henry V," 
awarded "for his outstanding achievement as actor, producer and director," and 
the second was for his starring role in "Hamlet" in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Entire Career Remembered 
</P>
<P>
In 1979 he was given an honorary Oscar "for the full body of his work, for the 
unique achievements of his entire career and his lifetime of contribution to 
the art of film." 
</P>
<P>
Olivier was nominated for Oscars for numerous other films including "Wuthering 
Heights" in 1939, "Rebecca" in 1940, "Richard III" in 1956, "The Entertainer" 
in 1960, "Othello" in 1965 and "Sleuth" in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
With ferocious will, Olivier fought cancer, pleurisy and a muscular disease 
that made even handshakes agony. He endured two miserable marriages and years 
of paralyzing stage fright, contemplated murder and suicide and battled his own 
rages, guilts and drinking. 
</P>
<P>
On his 80th birthday, tributes flowed during a ceremony at the National 
Theater, which he founded in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
"Awe and wonder, you gave us awe and wonder," actress Dame Peggy Ashcroft told 
him at the time. Director Peter Hall called him "the genius performer." 
</P>
<P>
For Olivier, life and acting were inseparable. "I have to act to breathe," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
By turns, he loved and hated his craft -- but never would contemplate retiring 
from it. Acting simply consumed him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quest for Perfection 
</P>
<P>
He was forever searching for new ways to broaden his range and reach the hearts 
of his audience. For instance, seeking to conjure up Oedipus' abject cry of 
despair, he would imagine the cry of the arctic ermine when it licks the salt 
laid down by its hunters and its tongue sticks to the ice. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever sex drive he had, Olivier wrote in his 1982 autobiography "Confessions 
of an Actor," went into his acting. "You can't be more than one kind of athlete 
at a time. A sexual athlete is not likely to find sufficient energy for work of 
another athletic kind." 
</P>
<P>
Born May 22, 1907, in the town of Dorking southwest of London, Laurence Kerr 
Olivier was the third child of an Anglican clergyman who encouraged him to try 
acting. 
</P>
<P>
At age 10, he was Brutus in a school performance. At 15, he donned women's 
clothes to play Katherine in a Stratford Festival boys' production of "The 
Taming of the Shrew." 
</P>
<P>
After studying acting in Birmingham, his first professional role was in 1922 in 
a sketch in a small touring company. In his first London role, in Alice Law's 
1924 "Byron," he tripped over a doorsill and fell on his face. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alternates With Gielgud 
</P>
<P>
His first marriage, to actress Jill Esmond in 1930, produced a son but ended in 
divorce. Meanwhile, his career was soaring through Noel Coward's "Private 
Lives" in London and New York, and Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet," in which 
he and John Gielgud alternated playing Romeo and Mercutio. 
</P>
<P>
With Gielgud and Ralph Richardson, fellow knights-to-be, he formed a 
partnership that re-made English theater. 
</P>
<P>
Olivier played a dazzling succession of Shakespearean triumphs -- "Hamlet," 
"Henry V," "Macbeth." Movie stardom came in 1939 when he moved to Hollywood and 
made "Wuthering Heights." 
</P>
<P>
In that same year, Olivier appeared with Vivien Leigh in a New York production 
of "Romeo and Juliet." After nearly two years of clandestine love, he obtained 
a divorce and the two were wed. 
</P>
<P>
That marriage, glamorous in public, was another debacle. Leigh soon fell out of 
love, had a series of affairs and descended into manic depression that 
tormented Olivier. He had crippling bouts of stage fright and contemplated 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
They were divorced in 1961, and Olivier wed actress Joan Plowright, with whom 
he finally found happiness. They had a son, Richard, and two daughters, Tamsin 
and Julie-Kate. All three are either studying or working in the theater. 
</P>
<P>
During World War II, he made the three films that sealed his reputation as the 
finest Shakespearean actor in film: "Henry V," "Hamlet," for which he won a 
best-actor Oscar in 1949, and "Richard III." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Played Fading Comic 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s and 1970s he had scores of memorable roles, from the fading comic 
Archie Rice in John Osborne's "The Entertainer" to Astrov in Chekhov's "Uncle 
Vanya" to the Nazi who tortures Dustin Hoffman in the film "Marathon Man." 
</P>
<P>
Olivier was proudest of his founding of Britain's National Theater. "Only a man 
of his titanic standing and relentless energy could have brought the project to 
fruition," wrote Alan Hamilton in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
He was among a group of actors knighted for their work, but in 1971 was 
elevated to a peerage as Baron Olivier of Brighton. 
</P>
<P>
His last public performance was a tape-recorded speech with extracts from 
"Henry V," his contribution to a campaign to prevent developers covering up the 
ruins of the Rose Theater in London, where Shakespeare is thought to have 
acted.

Residual oil inside the hull of the crippled tanker Exxon Valdez, washed loose 
by seawater, was the likely source of a 10-mile oil sheen off the coast of San 
Diego, a Coast Guard official said today. 
</P>
<P>
Concern about the offshore oil slick and the discovery of five flaps of steel 
hanging from the bottom of the tanker will delay the disabled tanker's entry 
into San Diego Bay at least several days.

A 12-year-old boy driving a stolen car led sheriff's deputies on a 15-minute 
chase early today that ended in Pasadena when he tried to run over a deputy, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies found a stolen, unloaded AK-47 assault rifle in the car after they 
arrested the 12-year-old El Monte boy, Deputy Pat Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies tried to stop the stolen car in Altadena at about 12:45 a.m., Hunter 
said. The boy, however, refused to stop and led deputies on a chase through 
Pasadena and Altadena at speeds of 35 to 65 m.p.h. "After the 15-minute pursuit 
the youth drove the car onto an embankment as he attempted to enter the 
eastbound Foothill Freeway," Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
As deputies approached the car on foot, the youth suddenly accelerated the 
vehicle at the deputies, Hunter said. One deputy suffered a slight injury to a 
knee as he jumped to avoid being struck. The boy was arrested without further 
incident.

Magda Wilson's Baby is home again. The 80-year-old Santa Monica woman who 
suffered a heart-wrenching loss July 1 when the outspoken parrot she had owned 
for nearly 40 years was apparently stolen outside her apartment was reunited 
with her pet late Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
"He just ate and ate and ate, and when he was done, he said, 'You wanna go to 
bed? You wanna go to bed?' He was so tired," Wilson said today. "I'm very happy 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson got Baby back after a young woman identified only as "Blanca" put her in 
touch with a man who had apparently purchased the bird on the Santa Monica 
Pier, police said. After a weekend of negotiations, the parties met Monday 
night in front of a house on Pacific Coast Highway where the man, who remains 
unidentified, gave Wilson her parrot in exchange for a reimbursement of the 
$100 purchase price.

China today refused to rule out a trial and further punishment for Zhao Ziyang, 
who was ousted as Communist Party chief for opposing the military crackdown 
that crushed pro-democracy demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
"His problem is still being investigated," government spokesman Yuan Mu said at 
the first news conference by a high-ranking official since troops on June 3-4 
marched on Tian An Men Square and attacked unarmed demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
When the party Central Committee ousted him as secretary general on June 24, it 
accused Zhao of supporting the protesters and splitting the party, and said his 
case would be dealt with internally. Since then, however, official criticism 
has escalated, fueling speculation Zhao may stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Collaboration Alleged 
</P>
<P>
One major government report last week accused Zhao's aides of collaborating 
with protest leaders accused of trying to overthrow the government. It stopped 
short of also accusing Zhao of plotting a coup. 
</P>
<P>
Yuan stressed that the party charges and decision to treat Zhao's case as an 
internal disciplinary matter are not final. 
</P>
<P>
"How the problem will finally be dealt with will be decided according to the 
findings of the investigation," he told more than 100 Chinese and foreign 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Also today, authorities deported two reporters -- one American and one 
Taiwanese -- and gave a second Taiwanese reporter 48 hours to leave. All are 
accused of violating martial law bans on reporting activity. They bring to nine 
the number of reporters ordered to leave China since June 4. 
</P>
<P>
The deported American is Mark Hopkins, a reporter for the U.S. government-run 
Voice of America.

Women won equal rights in the restroom under a law signed today by Gov. Mario 
M. Cuomo. 
</P>
<P>
The law, dubbed the "Potty Parity" proposal, requires new buildings to have as 
many toilets for women as they do for men. The measure, subject of sometimes 
silly debate, passed the Legislature in June on a 140-1 vote. 
</P>
<P>
The lone dissenter, Assemblyman Kemp Hannon, said women should have more 
toilets than men because women take longer in the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
The law applies to any new building designed for public assembly and built 
after June 1, 1990. The number of toilets in a women's room would have to equal 
the number of urinals and toilet stalls in men's rooms.

A girl born with a bullet in her chest after her mother was shot was in 
satisfactory condition today after surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"What should I name her? Miracle Baby, or what?" asked Evelyn Page, 31, who 
gave birth Saturday, 8 1/2 months into her pregnancy, after being shot with a 
small-caliber firearm. Page, who also was in satisfactory condition, said she 
was shot by a man who accosted her on the street and demanded that she get into 
his car. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew my baby had been shot, the way my baby started moving in me," Page 
said. "My baby started moving real fast. She kicked the whole time." 
</P>
<P>
The infant, delivered by Cesarean section, underwent surgery to remove the 
bullet shortly after birth. The bullet broke a rib but did not damage internal 
organs.

A company featuring artists from the New York Metropolitan Opera arrived today 
in Beijing for the first prominent American cultural event since the bloody 
military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators last month. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened in China is tragic for all concerned," Joann Grillo, managing 
director of Ambassadors of Opera and Concert Worldwide, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"However, China is a reality. The world must deal with her," she said, 
explaining the company's decision to proceed with its three performances in 
Beijing despite the May 20 imposition of martial law and the June 4 military 
crackdown in which hundreds or perhaps thousands of protesters were killed.

<P>
The Ambassadors of Opera and Concert Worldwide is an independent company that 
features performers from the New York Metropolitan Opera. Since 1983, it has 
staged operas and musicals throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to sound presumptuous, but if our concerts can bring some beauty 
into the lives of the people in Beijing, then we will have served our purpose," 
Grillo said.

the country can't "go it alone" technologically.

"If we protect U.S. industries from foreign competition, we reduce the

deprive ourselves of access to advances in technology being achieved in foreign

General Motors Corp.'s auto market share woes continued in the first half of 
1989 and Chrysler Corp.'s effort stalled, but Ford Motor Co. added more gains 
to its stake, statistics from the companies show. 
</P>
<P>
Sales figures for the year to date also reflected market share gains by 
Japanese auto makers Honda Motor Co., Toyota Motor Co., and Nissan Motor Corp. 
European auto makers, however, continued to show a diminished presence with 
only Volkswagen AG holding more than a 1% share. 
</P>
<P>
Total sales of all vehicles were 7.67 million in the first half, down 6.6% from 
8.21 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Market Shares Slide 
</P>
<P>
Two of the major U.S. companies saw their market shares slide by more than a 
full point in the first half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
GM, the largest U.S. auto maker, saw its first-half share of the market drop to 
36% from 37.2% last year, despite concerted efforts by the company to reverse 
its slide. GM as recently as 1984 held a 46% share of U.S. auto sales. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler's share dropped to 10.7% from 11.7% last year. The drop was due in 
part to an unfavorable mix of products at the start of the year, when Chrysler 
discontinued a number of aging models, and limited availability of its new 
Dodge Spirit and Plymouth Acclaim mid-sized cars. 
</P>
<P>
Ford was the only market share gainer among U.S.-based companies in the first 
half. Its auto market share rose to 22.7% from 21.9%, a continuation of its 
growth from a low of 16% in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Among Japanese companies, Honda's share grew to 7.5% from 6.7% a year ago, due 
both to improved sales of imported models and a sales gain by the Honda Civic, 
now built at Marysville, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Toyota, which last year opened a new plant in Georgetown, Ky., ended the first 
half with a 6.1% market share, up from 5.3% a year ago. Strong sales of the 
Nissan Maxima helped Nissan's share of the market climb to 5.2% from 4.3% last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
European companies barely made a dent in the market. VW's share was 1.4%, down 
from 1.7% a year ago, while Swedish automaker Volvo saw its share grow slightly 
to 1% from 0.9% last year.

MARRIOTT CORP. TO SELL AIRLINE CATERING DIVISION

<P>
Hotel and food service company Marriott Corp. said today it has agreed to sell 
its airline catering division, Marriott In-Flite Services, to a group of 
private investors for an undisclosed price. 
</P>
<P>
The group, Caterair International, is led by Daniel Altobello, a Marriott 
executive vice president, Frederic Malek, a Washington merchant banker and 
former Marriott executive, and several members of the division's senior 
management, the Washington-based company said. 
</P>
<P>
Marriott said it will have an undisclosed financial interest in the business, 
which had 1988 revenues of $800 million. It will continue to operate under the 
Marriott In-Flite Services name. 
</P>
<P>
The company said proceeds of the sale, which is expected to be completed by the 
end of the year, will be used to repay debt. 
</P>
<P>
Marriott said assets involved in the sale include an airline catering kitchen 
owned by its Host International division. But it added that it "has no plans to 
sell Host." 
</P>
<P>
Later this summer, Marriott said, Host will move its headquarters from Santa 
Monica, Calif., to Marriott's headquarters in suburban Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts say the airline catering division has suffered from thin 
profit margins and has been vulnerable to uncertainties in the airline 
business.

<P>
Minicomputer maker MAI Basic Four Inc. of Tustin said today that it has 
extended its hostile $1.2-billion tender offer for Prime Computer. 
</P>
<P>
MAI Basic Four's cash offer of $19.50 a share has been extended until midnight 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Prime, based in Natick, Mass., has been fighting off MAI Basic Four's offers 
for the last nine months. On June 23, it agreed to a $1.4-billion merger with 
DR Holdings Inc., a company organized by J. H. Whitney. The deal called for a 
$21.50-a-share cash tender offer for 79% of Prime, with shares not purchased 
converted into $22 principal in 15.5% senior subordinated debt due 2001. 
</P>
<P>
MAI Basic Four, which had initially offered $20 a share, has said it will 
increase its bid but has not done so since the merger deal was announced.

Juan Jose Estrada of Mexico retained his World Boxing Assn. junior 
featherweight title here Monday night with a unanimous 12-round decision over 
Colombian Luis Mendoza. 
</P>
<P>
Estrada was always in control, despite a dangerous opponent who was quick and 
showed that he had a powerful punch. But Estrada was in better physical shape 
and took the fight to the Colombian. 
</P>
<P>
Mendoza landed punches repeatedly to the face of the champion, but the 
difference between them was reflected in the verdict. The three judges all 
scored it 117-112 to Estrada. 
</P>
<P>
This was Estrada's third successful defense of the title he won on May 2, 1988, 
when he beat Bernardo Pinango of Venezuela.

Graciano Rocchigiani, the International Boxing Federation super middleweight 
champion, has been arrested on suspicion of white slavery, procuring and 
extortion. 
</P>
<P>
West Berlin police said today that the 25-year-old champion was arrested Monday 
night after a West Berlin woman filed a complaint against him. 
</P>
<P>
He was arrested along with 25-year-old Adnan Karakul, a Turkish friend and a 
former boxer. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, whom police did not name, alleged that Rocchigiani and Karakul 
forced her to engage in prostitution during a trip last month to Italy. 
</P>
<P>
She also alleged that the two pressured her to continue as a prostitute later 
when she returned to West Berlin.

Outfielder Eric Davis will receive a $55,000 bonus for appearing in tonight's 
All-Star game, Reds General Manager Murray Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
There had been some doubt about the bonus because Davis' contract calls for the 
bonus if he was elected by fans. Davis was not elected but selected by the 
National League to play. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is that if a player is on the All-Star team, he receives the 
bonus," Cook said. "It doesn't matter if he is elected or selected to the 
team."

Canadian Vicki Keith became the first swimmer ever to cross the English Channel

Officials at the channel rescue center at Gris-Nez said the 28-year-old 
completed the 17-mile swim at 4:36 a.m. on the French coast near Calais. She 
had left Dover the previous evening. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said the boat accompanying Keith radioed, "The swimmer has 
arrived without problems." She immediately returned to England by boat. 
</P>
<P>
Three previous efforts by other swimmers to cross the channel using the fast 
but exhausting butterfly stroke had failed short of the goal.

HAWAIIAN CHALLENGE FOR AMERICA'S CUP PLANNED

<P>
A world-class yachtsman plans to challenge for the America's Cup under the 
banner of the Waikiki Yacht Club, boosting hopes that Hawaii may one day play 
host to the prestigious race. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Isler, who sailed with Dennis Conner in the last two America's Cup 
campaigns, and Waikiki Yacht Club Commodore Rick Jaep made the announcement at 
a news conference Monday. 
</P>
<P>
If a New York appeals court upholds a lower court decision that gave the cup 
away to a New Zealand club, American syndicates will have the right to 
challenge in 1992, Isler and Jaep said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
San Diego Would Host 
</P>
<P>
If the ruling is voided, the San Diego Yacht Club will host the defense and 
Isler's agreement with Waikiki Yacht Club will be canceled, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. John Waihee, who wants Hawaii to become a sailing mecca, said the 
agreement will be a boost for the islands. 
</P>
<P>
Isler, 34, served as navigator aboard Stars &amp; Stripes when Conner won the 
America's Cup back from the Australians in 1987. He was also navigator aboard 
the high-tech Stars &amp; Stripes catamaran when it defended the cup against a 
New Zealand yacht last year. 
</P>
<P>
He is the top-ranked match racing skipper in the United States, a former winner 
of the Hawaii Transpac race and coach of the 1984 U.S. Olympic sailing team. 
</P>
<P>
Isler was most recently vice president of Dennis Conner Sports Inc. but broke 
ties with Conner to pursue the cup on his own. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'U.S. Falling Behind' 
</P>
<P>
"I saw teams from foreign nations moving forward and the U.S. falling behind 
over uncertainty" about the outcome of the court case, Isler said. "Waiting for 
a court decision would put us way behind the foreign teams." 
</P>
<P>
Isler, who was born in Honolulu and lives in San Diego, said he decided to sail 
for the Waikiki Yacht Club because Hawaii has shown a significant interest in 
yacht racing by its 1987 attempt to lure the America's Cup race to island 
waters. 
</P>
<P>
State officials have said the races could pump $1 billion into Hawaii's 
economy.

Offensive tackle Tony Mandarich, the Green Bay Packers' No. 1 draft pick, says 
he wants to play for the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
Mandarich was chosen with the second pick in the 1989 draft behind the Cowboys' 
Troy Aikman. Rated the top player in the draft by several scouting services, 
Mandarich is asking the Packers for a contract approaching Aikman's six-year 
$11.037-million deal. He isn't close to signing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd sit out at Green Bay, but I'd rather go to Dallas and crush people," 
Mandarich said. "They'd like my style there." Mandarich told the Dallas Morning 
News that he'd rather play in Dallas because of Coach Jimmy Johnson's 
aggressive style, the talent in the offensive backfield and because owner Jerry 
Jones "pays his people a lot of money. And I'm worth a lot of money."
