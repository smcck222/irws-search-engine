DANCERS CORNER THE MARKET ON GOOD TIMES

One night in Iran, Marion Wetter received a telephone call asking him to join 
the Tehran Tangle Feet. That was in 1966, and the Vista resident has been 
square-dancing ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I wasn't surprised at most anything over there," Wetter, 64, said 
about finding a little bit of Americana in the stronghold of the shah. 
</P>
<P>
Wetter and his wife, Betty, publish Palostar, the official magazine of the 
Palomar Square Dance Assn., which has about 1,500 members in 22 affiliated 
North County clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Every night of the week, square dancers in costumes of orange, green, violet 
and magenta weave the complicated dance steps with military precision. The 
official California state folk dance is touted by participants for the 
friendship and camaraderie they find at the events, which are often held in 
space rented from public schools and women's clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"An English cousin was visiting, so I took him to observe the square dancers," 
Betty Wetter said. "He told me, 'I've never seen so many people so pleased with 
themselves.' " 
</P>
<P>
Kittie Rountree, president of the Ramona Hi Country Ho Downers, is among them. 
"It's the cleanest, friendliest activity I've ever been a part of," she said. 
</P>
<P>
People refrain from drinking before or during an event so as not to injure a 
partner during the precise dancing, Rountree said. "Of course, what they do 
after is up to them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Square dancing can be a family affair, and the ages of participants in the 
North County clubs range from those in their 30s to those in their 80s, 
although the majority of dancers are in their 50s, 60s and 70s. Although most 
of the clubs are couples-oriented, some welcome dancers without partners. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Spears, 32, began square-dancing at age 18. His wife, Linda, started when 
she was about 16. The couple, who met at a square dance, serve as Palomar 
Square Dance Assn. presidents this year. 
</P>
<P>
The couples out on the dance floor are quickly identified by the coordinated 
outfits they wear. The costumes are either sewn at home or purchased at one of 
a few stores in the area that cater to the square dancer. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Wetter, who calls herself a "clothes horse," has more than 50 outfits, 
most of which she made herself. She dons a red costume with white fur for the 
December holiday season, an orange and black outfit during Halloween. Other 
times, a gray skirt with hand-painted butterflies is just right. 
</P>
<P>
She stores the outfits on wooden rods she operates with a pulley system her 
husband designed in the garage of their home. Showing off a sequined costume 
from Mexico and one with a Latin touch that she made herself, she explained 
that her outfits are matched to shirts and ties she sews for her spouse. 
</P>
<P>
"I dream up all this crazy stuff," Wetter said, displaying a skirt sewn from 
gold upholstery fabric. "Most women can't have this many outfits. Where would 
they put them?" 
</P>
<P>
Jim Randall is a square dancer, caller and owner of a clothing shop 
specializing in outfits for aficionados. 
</P>
<P>
The racks of his store, Petticoat Junction in Escondido, overflow with ruffled 
undergarments (necessary to maintain decorum when twirling), skirts with 
matching blouses, dresses and flat or high-heeled shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Women, usually attired in skirts with ruffled petticoats and pettipants, can 
purchase a dance outfit for about $130, including all-leather shoes made 
especially for square dancing, Randall said. 
</P>
<P>
Most men wear Western pants, with wide loops for decorative belts and scalloped 
pockets; long-sleeved shirts; dancing shoes, and a scarf tie, Randall said. 
Some men wear cowboy hats and carry a towel that clips to their belts, because 
the dancing can be strenuous exercise. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know of any other group that dresses (for the activity) except 
golfers," Randall said. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing their distinctive attire, the dancers step onto the floor and wait for 
the music and the showmanship of the caller. 
</P>
<P>
Callers step up to the microphone and direct the dancers with "patter" and 
calls while records play. About a dozen callers cater to the North County 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"You're a showman, an entertainer. As a caller, if I walk in and am calling a 
dance, I like to feel I'm in the square with them. The look on their faces when 
they're having fun melts your heart," said Randall, a former airline pilot. 
</P>
<P>
Most callers begin as square dancers, but seminars and classes are offered so 
they can perfect their techniques. Callers sound the "patter," a series of 
rhythmic beats set to music, or sing the call to the hit parades of country, 
Western, pop and standard songs. 
</P>
<P>
"There are 16 to 20 record companies that produce square dance records 
exclusively," Randall said. 
</P>
<P>
Callers record under the Eureka, Shakedown or BRS labels in California, and on 
other labels in Tennessee, North Carolina and Missouri, states where square 
dancing is especially popular. 
</P>
<P>
The square dance itself has roots in the French quadrilles and in English 
country dances. Couples gather in squares of eight and proceed to dance a 
"tip," a series of two dances called or sung. 
</P>
<P>
The dances are not memorized, but the steps are, and the dancer responds to the 
caller's signals of "allemande left," "do-si-do" and "promenade single file." 
The atmosphere at a square dance can be surprisingly quiet as dancers listen 
for the caller's next direction. Of course, when they're having fun, "yahoos" 
and hand claps punctuate the air. 
</P>
<P>
Many square dancing clubs also offer round dancing. Round dancers, in a spinoff 
of ballroom dancing, display their skills by circling the floor in pairs to 
waltzes, tangos and two-steps. A cuer, much like a caller, choreographs the 
dance so all couples dip and sway in unison. 
</P>
<P>
The precision and artistry of square dancing is complicated enough that 
newcomers usually take about six months of lessons before they are ready to 
join a square. Experienced dancers, called "angels," assist the neophytes with 
the Basic Level, a series of about 32 movements. As the dancers become more 
proficient, they move to Mainstream, Plus, Advance 1 and Advance 2 levels. The 
top level is Challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Club dues range from $6 to $12 a year. The additional fee of $3 or $4 per 
person per night includes refreshments, usually coffee and pastries. Sometimes 
hardier fare, such as fried chicken or cowboy stew, is served. 
</P>
<P>
Callers and dancers can participate in more than 50 countries around the world, 
including Canada, South Africa, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Italy and Great 
Britain. The Wetters danced recently in Australia and New Zealand, and Jim 
Randall is sponsoring a 1991 square dancing tour of Scandinavia. In every 
country around the world, English is the official square dance language. 
</P>
<P>
"We dance on boats, on planes," Randall said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Hartshorn, a sheriff's lieutenant from Encinitas, added: "Club members 
become like extended family. You can go anywhere in the world and dance." 
</P>
<P>
How to Learn Square Dancing 
</P>
<P>
Most North County square dance clubs offer beginner classes in the fall. Call 
the club for additional information. In late summer, two free lessons will be 
held to acquaint newcomers with the dance. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, Aug. 12: Free lesson at 7 p.m., the Gazebo in the Vineyard Shopping 
Center, 1511 E. Valley Parkway, Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, Sept. 9: First-time dancers can participate at 7 p.m. at Grant 
Elementary School, 939 E. Mission Avenue, Escondido.

PROTECTING TOTS AROUND POOLS; 
</P>
<P>
DROWNING IS THE NO. 1 CAUSE OF CHILD DEATHS UNDER AGE 5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jason Pocock's mother was on the telephone. It was only for a moment, but it 
gave the 2-year-old Vista toddler time to slip out of the house, climb over 
two, 3-foot high gates, lift the cover of the family hot tub and fall in. 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Pocock does not remember how long she was on the phone before she 
noticed Jason wasn't where he was supposed to be that evening last December, 
but she said she can never forgot how she found him. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the hot tub cover was half open. I didn't even want to admit he could be 
in there," Pocock recalled. "When I found him, he was unconscious, he was blue, 
he was choking because he aspirated water, and I couldn't find a pulse." 
</P>
<P>
Pocock immediately began performing infant cardiopulmonary resuscitation on 
Jason, a procedure she had learned at Tri-City Medical Center when her son was 
born with respiratory problems. She simultaneously reached for the portable 
phone she always kept pool-side and dialed 911. 
</P>
<P>
Those two things -- Pocock's knowledge of CPR, and the quick access to a 
telephone -- saved Jason's life. Within a couple of breaths, Pocock had her son 
breathing on his own, and the paramedics arrived soon after, whisking Jason 
away to be taken by Life Flight to Children's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Jason spent two days and two nights in Children's before doctors pronounced him 
well enough to return home to his parents. He is one of the lucky ones. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the danger hasn't really passed. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as Jason came home from the hospital, he wanted to go back in the 
water. Doctors told Pocock that many near drowning victims are repeat 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
"I have always watched Jason, but now I watch him like a hawk," Pocock said. "I 
have a vision of my son so close to death, and to me, I don't need anymore 
warning. That image will always be with me." 
</P>
<P>
Drowning is the leading cause of death for children under the age of 5. It also 
is 100% preventable. 
</P>
<P>
However, since the beginning of this year, 11 children under the age of 14 have 
already died in pool and spa accidents around the county. Drowning deaths last 
year totaled 37, according to the county coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
Drownings are also very age- and sex-specific, said Bob Olander, a member of 
the National Drowning Prevention Network and general manager of Protect A Child 
Pool Fence Co. More than 90% of child drowning victims are between 1 and 5 
years old, and 70% of those are 2-to 3-year-old males. 
</P>
<P>
Drownings can occur in less than two minutes and in less than a puddle. 
Recently, in San Diego County, a child drowned in a bucket of cleaning 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
"It only takes 2 inches of water and a few moments for that tragedy to happen," 
said Linda Gilstrap, community education coordinator for the Water Safety 
Coalition in San Diego. "If I hear one thing from these parents, I hear, 'I 
only left for a minute,' 'I just went to answer the door.' " 
</P>
<P>
"It can't be emphasized enough, never ever leave your child alone," Gilstrap 
said. "That one second you leave them alone, you could be left with a lifetime 
of tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
Safety advocates often disagree on what drowning prevention measures work best, 
but they do agree that not just one, but several layers of protection are 
needed. The most important one is always close supervision. 
</P>
<P>
"Fences, covers, alarms, locks on sliding glass doors, these are things that 
can buy you precious moments in a recovery of a child who has gotten into a 
pool," Gilstrap said. "But, even if you have them, don't be overconfident. You 
still have to maintain the attitude that this is only going to help, but it 
will not prevent an accident." 
</P>
<P>
Olander said families who are considering installing a pool should wait until 
their children are over 5 years old. Gilstrap said education and public 
awareness are the only line of defense. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FENCING 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego County, all pool owners who live on less than an acre of land are 
required to have a fence surrounding their property but not necessarily around 
their pool. However, considering that most drowning victims are children who 
die in their own pool or spa, a fence around the property offers no real 
protection except for neighborhood children. 
</P>
<P>
There are many types of fencing materials on the market, but some are 
definitely not appropriate where child safety is concerned. Chain-link and wood 
fences are not considered safe because they can be easily climbed, even by a 
5-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
Wrought iron is a popular choice for safety fencing, but it should meet some 
specific requirements. Slats should be vertical and at least 5 feet high. 
Because the head of an average 5-year-old is about 4 inches wide, slats should 
be placed less than 3 3/4 inches apart to prevent a child from squeezing his 
head through. Slats should also be free of any ornamentation that a child might 
be able to climb. 
</P>
<P>
A wrought iron fence, which can be installed in less than a day, averages about 
$12 per foot, with gates starting at about $75. 
</P>
<P>
Another type of fence that was designed strictly with toddler safety in mind is 
the nylon mesh fence. The tightly woven nylon looks like a screen door -- it is 
transparent -- but is a thousand times thicker. 
</P>
<P>
Packaged in 12-foot sections that are wound like a bolt of cloth, the mesh 
fence comes 3 1/2 or 4 feet high. The sections are stretched over aluminum 
poles that are placed at 3-foot intervals around the pool and drilled 3 inches 
into the ground. This prevents anything or anyone from slipping or crawling 
underneath the mesh. 
</P>
<P>
The fence has no gate to contend with because each 12-foot section is chained 
together with safety latches. Two hands are required to unfasten these latches, 
and then a panel of the fence is simply folded back to allow access to the 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
The fence is set back 18 inches from the pool edge. 
</P>
<P>
The mesh fence has the added benefits of being weather-resistant, impervious to 
rips and snags and easy to dismantle. It can be taken down in less than 10 
minutes to accommodate pool parties where children aren't present. Its smooth, 
tight weave doesn't provide a foothold for tiny feet, and it is soft enough not 
to injure a small child who might fall against it. 
</P>
<P>
The average cost of a nylon mesh fence, which can be installed in one day, 
ranges from $1,000 to $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
The safest fence is the fence that encloses the pool entirely. To minimize 
traffic in a pool area, fencing should be as close as 24 inches off the edge of 
the pool. A fence should also have a gate that opens outward so a child pushing 
against it will close it. However, it is not wise to assume that a child will 
push instead of pull. The safest gate is one that requires an adult to 
physically lock and unlock it each time it is used. Any latching mechanism 
should be on top of the gate out of a child's reach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
POOL AND SPA COVERS 
</P>
<P>
There are no state or federal laws regulating the safety specifications of pool 
and spa covers. In fact, there are many types of solar and manual covers that 
don't attach to the sides of a pool and can actually be death traps. Not only 
is a child who slips underneath a cover unseen by a potential rescuer, the 
cover prevents the child from being able to climb out of the water. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Consumer Product and Safety Commission established criteria for 
a safety cover. A true safety cover must be able to support the weight of two 
adults and one child, and be able to attach to the perimeter of the pool to 
prevent anyone from slipping underneath. Safety covers must also be equipped 
with an automatic pump that drains off any rainwater that may collect on top. 
</P>
<P>
Most safety covers fit regular and irregular-shaped pools and operate manually 
or automatically. A motorized cover operates on a two-track system and extends 
the length and width of the pool when closed and recedes almost completely when 
open. Because an automatic cover is activated by just the turn of a key or the 
push of a button, people tend to use them more often. With a manual system, the 
cover is both opened and closed by a hand crank or is snapped on and off. 
</P>
<P>
Safety covers are made of many materials, but the strongest and most popular is 
vinyl laminated over a polyester mesh. 
</P>
<P>
A fully automatic safety cover ranges in price from $5,000 to $6,000 and can be 
installed in a day. A manual cover ranges from $2,000 to $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
For spas and hot tubs, safety advocates suggest a hard cover that physically 
clips to the ground and is equipped with child-proof locks. The Admiral 
Aluminum spa cover can support up to 300 pounds, locks with a special key, and 
is a popular model sold by most spa dealers. A custom-made cover costs $400 to 
$600. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ALARMS 
</P>
<P>
There are three types of pool alarms on the market, but safety advocates 
recommend their use only as a backup to other layers of protection. Pool alarms 
float on top of the water and sound a loud signal when they detect movement on 
the water's surface. This kind of alarm is extremely sensitive, however, and 
one of its drawbacks is that it is frequently triggered by wind or leaves 
falling into the pool. 
</P>
<P>
A new alarm on the market is one that detects movement below the water's 
surface. These do not sound every time the wind blows, but sometimes they don't 
sound at all, even when a relatively heavy object, such as a child, falls into 
the water. 
</P>
<P>
A third kind of alarm is a water-sensitive bracelet that is worn by the child. 
When the bracelet gets wet, an alarm goes off. Safety advocates say there have 
been some manufacturing problems with these aquatic sensors, and they should 
not be considered reliable protection. 
</P>
<P>
Pool alarms range from $80 to $150 and can be installed in one day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LOCKS 
</P>
<P>
More than 80% of all drownings occur after the child was last seen in the house 
and where the window of opportunity was less than 10 minutes, said Bob Olander 
of Protect A Child Pool Fence Co. 
</P>
<P>
"Typically what happens is a child will slip out of the house through a door 
that the parent or guardian assumes is locked, get into the back yard and head 
straight for the pool," he said. 
</P>
<P>
All exits leading to the pool or spa -- sliding glass doors and windows 
included -- should be secured with a deadbolt or child-proof locks. These locks 
should be up high and out of reach of a child. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SWIMMING LESSONS 
</P>
<P>
Parents are lulling themselves into a false sense of security if they think 
swimming lessons are a measure of safety for their children under 3 years old, 
said Linda Gilstrap of the Water Safety Coalition. When young children fall 
into a pool or spa, they are stunned and have little if any ability to deal 
with a crisis like that, she said. However, children over 3 years old do 
benefit from swimming lessons and are more likely to retain the information, 
Gilstrap said.

TIME SAVERS 
</P>
<P>
Even under the best conditions -- with all the barriers in place -- the worst 
scenario can and sometimes does happen. But there are still some added measures 
that can be taken to save a child once he or she has fallen into the water. 
</P>
<P>
A phone installed near the pool area can save precious seconds in calling for 
help. The time saved could mean the difference between life and death or severe 
brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
All members of the family should know cardiopulmonary resuscitation. One parent 
knowing CPR is not enough, as Cheryl Pocock attests. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband knows adult CPR and is very comfortable with it, but he wasn't home 
when Jason fell in the hot tub," Pocock said. "If one adult knows CPR, it's 
still not enough. Anybody who watches kids should have to know it." 
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross and many local hospitals offer CPR classes for little or no fee. 
Depending on the age of the children in the home, parents should learn infant 
or child CPR because the technique vastly differs from adult CPR. Infant CPR is 
for children ages 0-3 years, and child CPR specifically covers children ages 
3-9 years. Most classes take eight hours and, once trained, parents should take 
a refresher course every year.

Drowning-Prevention Tips for Families With Pools 
</P>
<P>
Kid-proofing your pool means constructing several layers of protection 
</P>
<P>
SAFETY COVERS 
</P>
<P>
1. A child can slip unnoticed under a normal solar cover. A safety cover, on 
the other hand, attaches in some way around the perimeter of the pool. The 
cover should be strong enough to support the weight of at least two adults. 
Since a child can drown in as little as two inches of water, some kind of 
pumping device is needed to remove rain or sprinkler water that collects on the 
cover's surface. 
</P>
<P>
2. Enclose the pool completely -- most drownings occur when children wander out 
of the back door of their own house. The fencing should be made if plain 
wrought iron -- children can use embellishments for climbing. Fencing should be 
at least five feet high; bars should be no less than four inches apart. Gap 
where fence meets garden wall should not be wider than four inches. Include as 
little as possible within the fencing. Access to bar-becue pit, pool supplies, 
etc. increase adult traffic, thereby increasing the odds of the gate being 
accidently left open. 
</P>
<P>
3. Gates should open outward and should be self-closing and self-latching 
beyond a child's reach. 
</P>
<P>
AUXILIARY SAFETY 
</P>
<P>
4. Secure all doors leading to the pool area with childproof locks and latches. 
Inexpensive sound alters, available at hardware stores, give off an alarm when 
a door is opened. 
</P>
<P>
5. A telephone extension in the patio area can save precious seconds during an 
emergency. 
</P>
<P>
6. Learn CPR.

DAVID NELSON / ON RESTAURANTS: SOUTHWEST IN EVERY DIRECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 16th-Century Spanish adventurers who vainly searched the American Southwest 
for the fabled lost cities of gold may have been inspired by a 
misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
There certainly was a language barrier between these guys and the locals who 
gave them directions, and what they may actually have been told about was not 
cities of gold, but of golden caviar. 
</P>
<P>
You might reach that conclusion, at any rate, by reading the menu at 
Cilantro's, which offers an appetizer of chile corn crab cakes with golden 
caviar and sour cream. Golden caviar -- and crab, too -- certainly was beyond 
the reach of the Indians who developed the original Southwest cuisine. But the 
point of the new Southwest cuisine, handled very well by this immensely popular 
restaurant on the eastern edge of Del Mar, is to achieve a Southwest-style 
effect by jumbling almost any ingredients with one or a few traditional 
staples. 
</P>
<P>
The menu is, by and large, as striking as the dining room, in which wood, stone 
and metal surfaces are cleverly woven into a sophisticated environment. 
Appetizers are listed as tapas (snacks), and two or three could be ordered as 
an alternative to a formal entree. In addition to the crab cakes (which were 
tasty enough, but not very different from the classic Maryland version), the 
starter list offers oysters baked under cilantro pesto; blue corn nachos with 
black beans, salsa and cheese; grilled skewers of shrimp or chicken first 
soaked in a spicy marinade, and a most unusual queso fundido. 
</P>
<P>
This last varies considerably from the typical Mexican dish, and bakes a round 
creamy goat cheese in a sharp puree of Romaine lettuce, pungent herbs and pine 
nuts. 
</P>
<P>
Baskets of hot, homemade tortillas arrive throughout the meal; oversized and 
light, these might be greeted critically by aficionados of the genuine Mexican 
product, but they are quite good. Many other extras are available at a price, 
including jalapeno relish, a basket of blue corn tortilla chips, sweet potato 
chips with fruit salsa, a relish of black beans and papaya and a pile of onion 
rings hotly seasoned with red chile. 
</P>
<P>
The entree list is relatively brief but by no means lightweight. It opens with 
grilled salmon seasoned with chipotle chilies, garlic, oregano and cilantro 
vinaigrette, and moves along to a spit-roasted chicken rubbed with hot peppers, 
a grilled rib-eye steak doused with a sauce of roasted tomatoes and poblano 
chilies, and fajitas of beef, chicken or shark. 
</P>
<P>
The roast duck with a slurry-like sauce of pureed dried cherries and chilies 
takes the duck-with-fruit sauce theme in a delicious new direction. There is 
great subtlety to the hot-sweet sauce, and the bird itself is roasted carefully 
to an extremely juicy finish. 
</P>
<P>
The "Rio Grande" lamb chops similarly undergo a careful grilling; these gain a 
slight edge from a cilantro-based "pesto" and are garnished with a suave, 
slightly creamy succotash that adds chopped bell peppers and onions to the 
usual corn-lima bean combination. 
</P>
<P>
A chile relleno stuffed with smoked chicken, oyster mushrooms, spinach and 
cheese looked to have been sprinkled with confetti, thanks to the relish of 
corn and minced peppers; the effect was teasingly hot and rather savory. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen prepares a selection of desserts daily and serves them in generous 
portions -- these tend to be very sweet, probably as an antidote to the 
spiciness that characterizes so many of the dishes. The choice recently 
included white chocolate cheesecake, profiteroles drenched with both caramel 
and chocolate sauces, and a flavorful cherry-apple crisp garnished with scoops 
of excellent homemade ice cream.

BEACH RESIDENTS ASSAIL REMOVAL OF GAME COURTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL WATSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State officials served residents of Ventura's pricey Pierpont area with an 
unwelcome surprise Wednesday by knocking down privately constructed volleyball 
courts on San Buenaventura State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Without warning, the state Parks and Recreation Department decided to uproot 
the volleyball poles after a resident complained that the courts were 
attracting unsavory people who caroused on the beach and had "sex in the sand," 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The move netted an irate response from other residents of the beachfront 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a nightmare," said Karen Biedebach, 25, who helped her parents build 
a court at the end of Waterbury Lane 10 years ago. "I am very, very, very 
angry." 
</P>
<P>
Biedebach said she had invited several friends to a volleyball party planned 
for Wednesday night -- unaware that the state was going to demolish the wooden 
volleyball posts early that day. 
</P>
<P>
Four people from the state Parks and Recreation Department and the city of 
Ventura cruised the public beach in a tractor, knocking down illegal structures 
along the two-mile stretch between Ventura Harbor and Ventura Pier, said Jeff 
Price, chief ranger for the state's Channel Coast District. 
</P>
<P>
Price said no need was seen to notify residents of the action because the 
structures were illegally built on public land. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he said, the agencies would like to find the owners and bill them for 
the $100 cleanup operation. 
</P>
<P>
Four volleyball courts, a piece of pipe probably used for tetherball and some 
makeshift wooden forts were removed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, the city of Ventura cleared away some of the volleyball courts 
on a 40-foot-wide city right-of-way that runs parallel to the state-owned 
beach, said Ann Prinz, code enforcement officer for the city. Three complaints 
had been lodged, Prinz said. 
</P>
<P>
But some people wouldn't give up. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, city and state crews for the third time removed a court near 
Weymouth Lane, Price said. 
</P>
<P>
They also recorded identification numbers on four catamarans that the state 
plans to remove from the beach, Price said. He said an attempt would be made to 
trace the owners and notify them first. 
</P>
<P>
Price said private structures on the public beach have proliferated in recent 
months. A resident's phone call brought the situation to the attention of park 
rangers four weeks ago, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The caller said the volleyball courts attracted people who littered, drank beer 
and bothered residents, sometimes using areas near the courts for illegal 
camping, Price said. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody called and said, 'You know, there's sex in the sand. There's illegal 
camping, and the volleyball courts are at the core of all problems.' " 
</P>
<P>
Price said he does not agree that volleyball is the root of the evil, but he 
said clearing away dunes to build courts makes the sand unstable and can cause 
it to blow into back yards and houses. The dunes also provide a barrier in the 
winter from high tides, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, he said, people should not monopolize state land for private structures. 
He encouraged volleyball players to use the 18 courts the state has built in 
the two-mile stretch. 
</P>
<P>
"The state beach is for the enjoyment of everyone in California and not for the 
exclusive enjoyment of anyone," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
Tanya Beers, 24, who lives on Belfast Lane, said the removal of a court near 
her house was "too restrictive." 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons we live here and pay such high prices is to live on the 
beach and enjoy ourselves," Beers said. 
</P>
<P>
Biedebach said she had played games on her court with tourists from throughout 
Southern California and questioned the wisdom of removing any recreational 
area. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe," she said, "they want to make Ventura like Bakersfield by the sea."

SILBERMAN'S REQUEST FOR 'ELECTRONIC LEASH' DENIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rejecting Richard T. Silberman's request to be put on a so-called "electronic 
leash," a federal judge said Wednesday that the San Diego financier had to 
remain in jail without bail to await sentencing for a conviction linked to an 
alleged money-laundering scheme. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving said Silberman, a one-time governor's 
aide, will have to remain at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center in 
downtown San Diego to await sentencing Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
In a terse, two-page order, Irving, who presided over Silberman's recently 
concluded trial, did not directly explain why electronic monitoring was not a 
suitable alternative. Defense attorneys had asked Irving to place Silberman 
under house arrest and to fit his ankle with an electronic transmitter that 
would notify authorities if he left his La Jolla residence. 
</P>
<P>
Reiterating only his reason for ordering Silberman to jail immediately after 
conviction on one of several counts, Irving said the prominent businessman had 
not proven that he is not a flight risk. The judge did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, 61, a one-time top aide to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., was 
convicted June 28 of violating a federal currency law in what prosecutors 
contend was a scheme to launder $300,000 that an undercover FBI agent allegedly 
portrayed as the proceeds of Colombian drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Irving declared a mistrial on June 29 on five other charges after the jury 
reported it was deadlocked, heavily in favor of conviction, on those counts. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors immediately announced that they would try Silberman, who is married 
to San Diego County Supervisor Susan Golding, a second time on the unresolved 
counts. The second trial is scheduled to begin Sept. 25, the same day Silberman 
is scheduled to be sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
Although Silberman could draw as much as 10 years in prison, new federal 
sentencing guidelines indicate that a term of one to five years is likely. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after Silberman's conviction June 28 on the sole count, Irving sent 
him to jail, saying that was what the law required unless Silberman could 
clearly prove that he would not flee. 
</P>
<P>
Because Silberman disappeared from San Diego last February, Irving said he had 
no choice but to send him to jail. 
</P>
<P>
Two days after he disappeared, Silberman was found in a Las Vegas hotel, 
unconscious, where -- prompted by an adverse pretrial ruling from Irving -- he 
purportedly had tried to kill himself with an overdose of sleeping pills. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman's defense attorneys, who had asked Irving to consider the so-called 
"electronic leash" as an alternative to jail pending sentencing, could not be 
reached Wednesday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The "leash" is really a transmitter about the size of a cigarette pack that is 
banded to the ankle and sends a continuous signal from a radius of 150 feet to 
a receiver, which is attached to a telephone in the house. The phone is linked 
to computers in Ohio, which monitor the signal for disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers had said at a special June 29 hearing that Silberman would even 
be willing to pay for the system himself, saving taxpayers the $40 a day it 
would cost to keep him in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder Jr., the lead prosecutor in the case, 
declined to comment on Irving's order. 
</P>
<P>
At the June 29 hearing, Gorder argued that proximity to the international 
border could enable Silberman to be in Mexico before authorities could respond 
to his absence.

ENCINITAS REPEALS CURBSIDE HIRING BAN AS SUIT LOOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Encinitas City Council on Wednesday voted unanimously and without comment 
to repeal its curbside hiring ban, two days before a hearing in U.S. District 
Court to consider a suit filed against the city over the ban. 
</P>
<P>
The council's action follows U.S. District Judge John Rhoades' issuance two 
weeks ago of a temporary restraining order against enforcement of the ban. 
Migrant advocates had brought suit against the city, claiming the ban infringed 
on both migrant and employer rights to free speech. 
</P>
<P>
The council had approved the never-enforced ban in May to curtail the 
street-corner gathering of migrants seeking employment. 
</P>
<P>
The council also voted Wednesday to pay $18,000 for attorney's fees incurred by 
the plaintiffs in the case. 
</P>
<P>
In issuing the restraining order, Rhoades wrote that the ordinance would "pose 
unconstitutional restriction on free speech, so as to violate on its face the 
First Amendment and California's liberty-of-speech clause." 
</P>
<P>
"We're sorry that the court didn't feel that the solution that the City Council 
had selected was a legally viable one," City Atty. Roger Krauel said. "We still 
are faced with a very big problem, and the solution and approach that we had 
embarked upon is not the only solution and approach, and we are going to 
continue to look for solutions." 
</P>
<P>
Among the preferred solutions is more help from the federal government in 
enforcing migrant law. Encinitas got some of that help this week as U.S. Border 
Patrol agents began a monthlong surveillance of curbside hiring to see that 
would-be employers check a laborer's immigration status. 
</P>
<P>
"The cooperation that we're currently getting from the Border Patrol is what we 
needed, and that's all we actually ever wanted," Mayor Pam Slater said before 
Wednesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
However, the concentrated presence of Border Patrol agents is only temporary, 
and the problems posed by curbside hiring may continue after the surveillance 
ends, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Gail Hano said that, after the Border Patrol finishes its 
monthlong stint, the city may seek help from the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
"If it means calling them on a daily basis, that's what we're going to have to 
do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Hano is especially frustrated with the federal government, which she says is 
relegating the task of dealing with the migrant population to the city. 
</P>
<P>
"We might actually send (the federal government) the bills that the city of 
Encinitas has incurred due to this problem," Hano said. 
</P>
<P>
Some feel that the fate of Encinitas' 8-month-old hiring hall may be tied to 
the demise of the curbside hiring ban. 
</P>
<P>
"The City Council in general felt that the success of the hiring hall was 
dependent on the success of the hiring ban," said Gloria Carranza, the city's 
transient-issues coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
With the termination of the ordinance, Carranza fears, the hiring hall may be 
next on the chopping block. 
</P>
<P>
The hiring hall's performance will be evaluated in August when the council 
considers its budget. 
</P>
<P>
Hano believes that, although the hall has placed about 60% of the people who 
have come to it in search of work, it has not been effective in addressing 
curbside hiring.

OXNARD PANEL OKS 30-YEAR GROWTH PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After more than a year of public hearings and deliberation, the Oxnard Planning 
Commission approved a controversial growth plan that would permit a 32% 
population increase in the city over the next 30 years, making way for final 
City Council action next month. 
</P>
<P>
The council unanimously agreed Wednesday to postpone hearings on the General 
Plan until the final week in August, when the council will schedule five full 
days of deliberation. 
</P>
<P>
During its consideration of the two-inch-thick document, the Planning 
Commission heard numerous objections from a wide variety of groups, including 
the U.S. Navy, slow-growth advocates, the County Board of Supervisors and the 
city of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the objections focused on the amount of development permitted under the 
plan. As drafted, the plan would permit a population increase of 41,000 over 
the city's current estimated population of 127,721 and a 135% increase in 
commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
It would also allow the number of housing units in the city to increase by 32% 
-- from 41,857 units today to 55,319 in the year 2020. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said the changes made by the commission in response to the 
objections do not significantly alter the plan that was drafted last year by 
the General Plan Advisory Committee, a 22-member citizens panel that spent 2 
1/2 years writing the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The most significant change the commission made was to reject a proposal in the 
plan to expand the city's "sphere of influence" -- land outside the city that 
is governed by the plan -- by about 3,500 acres. Instead, the commission 
decided to expand the sphere of influence by 86 acres near Pleasant Valley Road 
and the Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Nao Takasugi agreed Wednesday with the commission's decision, saying the 
amount of development permitted in the plan can be accommodated within the 
city's current boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's necessary to go outside our sphere of influence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's decision last week not to extend Oxnard's sphere of influence 
past Arnold Road on the city's southwest border put into serious jeopardy a 
proposal by the Baldwin Co. of Irvine to build a 2,700-acre, marina-based 
residential development at Ormond Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The beach, where heavy industry, wetlands and agriculture have coexisted 
uneasily for years, is near the Pacific Missile Test Center in Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
The decision not to expand the boundaries reduces from 10,500 to 3,500 the 
number of housing units that the Baldwin Co. can build in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Takasugi and Councilman Manuel Lopez agreed with that decision, saying the 
project as originally proposed was too massive. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first heard of it I said 'Wow,' " Takasugi said. But after reviewing 
the proposal and listening to public debate on the matter, the mayor said he 
believes that the project would severely cut into the wetlands and "destroy the 
beauty of the beach." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Navy have opposed the development, saying it would be 
incompatible with aircraft operations and weapons system tests performed at the 
missile test facility. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Dorothy Maron said Wednesday that the plan does not adequately 
balance the increasing number of houses with the number of jobs permitted in 
the city during the next 30 years. She said the plan would permit more job 
opportunities -- 115,896, up from 42,128 last year -- than housing units. "The 
numbers don't correlate," she said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Community Development Director Richard Maggio said the numbers would 
eventually balance because the city is now "job poor and worker rich."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CSU REPORTS SHARP RISE IN MINORITY 
ENROLLMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The number of ethnic minorities enrolling in the state university system has 
risen dramatically in recent years and there has been a steady increase in the 
hiring of women and minorities as faculty members, CSU studies released 
Wednesday in Long Beach showed. Between 1984 and 1989, freshmen enrollment 
increased at CSU campuses by 22.6%, while the increases in enrollments of 
under-represented minority groups ranged from 21% to 73%, according to one of 
two reports presented to the CSU Board of Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
School officials said the most dramatic freshmen enrollment gains over the last 
five years were made by Latinos and Asians. Latino enrollment increased 73.2%, 
from 2,666 to 4,617. Asian enrollment increases were almost as dramatic, 
showing a 71.4% jump, from 3,663 to 6,277 in the freshman class. Other 
increases among freshmen included: blacks, 21.6%, or 1,558 to 1,895, and 
Indians, 45.8% or 179 to 261.

AGREEMENT ON FRYMAN CANYON NEAR, WOO SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
An agreement was reported to be near Wednesday that would end the controversy 
over development in Studio City's Fryman Canyon by turning the canyon into 
parkland. In a separate development, the state attorney general's office warned 
that it may sue the city for failing to secure half the canyon for park use 
four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Michael Woo and the head of the Santa Monica 
Mountains Conservancy, a state park agency, said long-stalled talks with a 
luxury home developer to buy the canyon from him for a park now are progressing 
favorably. 
</P>
<P>
Public agencies, led by the conservancy, are very close to an agreement to buy 
the entire 63-acre canyon, Woo said. 
</P>
<P>
Purchase of the land would end the developer's plan to build houses there, 
which is intensely opposed by neighbors and environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Los Angeles City Council received a letter Wednesday from the 
state attorney general's office, warning that the state is considering a 
lawsuit against the city to secure 31 acres of the canyon for the conservancy. 
The conservancy had been promised that the developer would donate the land to 
the state in return for city permits, but the city issued the permits even 
though the donation was never made, the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
Sales negotiations between the conservancy and developer Fred Sahadi have long 
been stalled over price. 
</P>
<P>
"The developer's come down in price in recent days, but he's still not met our 
appraisal price," conservancy President Carole Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy's state appraiser has said the property is worth $8.7 million. 
But Sahadi had the land appraised at $13.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
According to a source with knowledge of the negotiations, the parties are now 
talking about a price tag of about $12 million, which would make the parcel 
among the most expensive per acre of any purchased by the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Woo said the councilman is exploring the use of city park 
funds to help the conservancy pay for the site. The conservancy cannot pay more 
than the state-appraised value. 
</P>
<P>
News of the movement in negotiations emerged after Woo persuaded the council 
Wednesday to postpone until July 25 its consideration of a plan to declare part 
of Fryman Canyon a cultural-historic landmark. 
</P>
<P>
"The threat of making the site a landmark has succeeded in bringing the 
negotiations to this point," Woo said in an interview. "It's created the right 
frame of mind on the developer's part to talk," but action should be delayed 
while sales negotiations continue, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the council took up the question of declaring the land a 
cultural historic landmark, which would prevent development of the property for 
up to a year. 
</P>
<P>
It also ordered city Planning Department officials to investigate how the 
department granted final approval to Sahadi's project in 1986 without first 
requiring him to deed 31 acres of the property to the conservancy. The 
conservancy maintains that the developer was required to donate the land as a 
condition for obtaining city permits. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general's letter received Wednesday warned that the state is 
looking into a lawsuit against the city to enforce that position. 
</P>
<P>
The 31 acres is important because Sahadi's plans call for construction of a 
temporary haul road across this land to ease the building of 28 luxury houses 
on the other 32 acres. Without the haul road, it would be difficult or 
impossible for Sahadi to develop his property. 
</P>
<P>
Sahadi's attorneys have complained that state agencies have been collaborating 
to make it more difficult for Sahadi to develop the land in order to force him 
to sell to the conservancy at a lower price. City and state officials deny 
this. 
</P>
<P>
In its six-page letter, the state attorney general's office wrote that the 
"manner in which the haul road was approved was fundamentally flawed," leaving 
"the approval of the haul road's location vulnerable to legal challenge." 
</P>
<P>
Sahadi refused to discuss the negotiations with the conservancy. He called the 
attorney general's letter an exercise in "sword rattling." 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a game of intimidation from day one, and this is no different," 
he said, denying that he wrongly secured his approvals. 
</P>
<P>
In another development, Stevens announced that the conservancy plans to hold a 
public meeting July 23 on the possibility of buying Fryman Canyon, at which the 
developer has been asked to offer his final price. 
</P>
<P>
"I've dragged the staff and our advisory agency and the public through this 
long enough -- now, let's have hearing and get this over with," said Stevens, 
president of the conservancy. "In my head, the 23rd is a deadline." 
</P>
<P>
The city Cultural Heritage Commission put Sahadi's grading plans on hold in 
March so it could determine if Fryman Canyon merited cultural-historic landmark 
status. 
</P>
<P>
The commission finally recommended that 31 acres of the canyon -- on which 
Sahadi had no plans to build houses anyway -- be declared a landmark, citing 
the unique natural features of the area, including stands of oak and walnut 
trees and a stream. 
</P>
<P>
It was that recommendation that was before the council Tuesday and postponed 
until July 25.

EX-BOYFRIEND HELD IN DOUBLE KILLING; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: TWO SISTERS ARE SHOT TO DEATH IN THEIR SEPULVEDA DUPLEX. A GUNMAN CHASES 
DOWN A MAN RUNNING FOR HELP AND WOUNDS HIM IN THE BACK.

Two sisters were shot to death and a man was wounded when an ex-boyfriend of 
one of the women allegedly invaded her Sepulveda home early Wednesday and began 
firing a shotgun, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Dean Roger McGrath, 29, was arrested on suspicion of murder about 
12 hours after the shootings, which took place at a duplex in the 8500 block of 
Orion Avenue. Police said domestic problems motivated the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
Sisters Marleene Evelyn Taylor, 32, and Kathleen Taylor Fien, 30, were hit with 
shotgun blasts at 1:30 a.m. inside the small, two-bedroom house, Detective 
Michael Brandt said. Anthony Deluca, 28, ran from the house calling for help, 
but the gunman chased him down about six houses away and shot him in the back, 
police said. He collapsed on a neighbor's front porch after he had knocked on 
the door and called for help. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Taylor's two young sons -- Tony, a 4-year-old fathered by Deluca, 
and Jake, a 2-year-old 
</P>
<P>
fathered by McGrath -- were asleep in the house when McGrath allegedly entered 
through an unlocked door and began shooting, but they were unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the boys awoke to find their mother dead in another room. They were 
later taken into custody by juvenile authorities who were looking for relatives 
they could stay with. 
</P>
<P>
Two neighbors called police when shots and screams were heard in the 
neighborhood of mostly single-family houses that back up to the San Diego 
Freeway -- one block south of an area where streets were barricaded by police 
this year in an effort to reduce drug dealing and related crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard muffled shots and then shooting outside. Someone was screaming for 
help," said Sonya Stanchfield, who lives in the duplex next to where the 
shootings began. "It was pretty wild for this neighborhood. We've had problems 
around here, but nothing like this before." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor was dead when police arrived and Fien died while being transported to 
Panorama Community Hospital in Panorama City. Deluca was in critical but stable 
condition in an undisclosed hospital. Police said Deluca identified McGrath as 
their attacker. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath was arrested without a struggle at a house in North Hollywood after 
police checked other locations where the suspect was known to have stayed. A 
shotgun believed to be the murder weapon was found in the house. 
</P>
<P>
Brandt said the shootings were apparently motivated by problems involving 
McGrath, Taylor and Deluca. 
</P>
<P>
Police and neighbors said McGrath and Taylor and her two sons moved into the 
duplex four months ago along with Fien and her husband, David Fien. On April 
21, McGrath was arrested at the duplex on a drunk driving warrant and served 66 
days in the County Jail before being released June 29, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
While McGrath was in jail, Deluca either began visiting often or moved into the 
small duplex, police and neighbors said. Since his release from jail, it was 
not known if McGrath had contacted Taylor or visited the duplex before his 
arrival early Wednesday. David Fien was not at the duplex at the time of the 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
"The motivation was domestic problems, but we are still trying to figure out 
what the relationships were," Brandt said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors knew little about the people living in the small, beige duplex, 
surrounded by a neatly trimmed lawn and chain-link fence. "They were very quiet 
and stayed totally to themselves," said John Stanchfield, who lives next door. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said the two sisters and the two children were seen playing on the 
lawn early Tuesday evening and later Taylor sat on the front porch with Deluca. 
"There was no sign that anything was coming," Stanchfield said. 
</P>
<P>
According to police and court records, Taylor had not reported any previous 
problem with McGrath and had not sought a restraining order to keep him away. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor worked as a clerk at a Northridge department store and wore the same 
steel-gray dress so often that neighbors said they thought it was a uniform. 
The dark-haired Taylor was described as "very tall, very thin, very beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said Deluca worked in an auto-related business. Last week, he 
approached a neighbor and offered to buy her car. 
</P>
<P>
It was unknown by police and neighbors if Kathleen Fien and McGrath had been 
employed. Some neighbors said Fien spent much of her time watching her sister's 
children, rarely left the house and spoke to no one. Former neighbors said 
McGrath spent a lot of time working on cars. 
</P>
<P>
Before moving to the duplex, McGrath, the sisters and the two boys lived in a 
two-bedroom apartment a few blocks away on Parthenia Avenue but were evicted 
Feb. 6 for not paying their rent, the manager said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of that complex, many of whom declined to give their names because 
they feared McGrath, said he was a burly man who drank heavily and lost his 
temper frequently. 
</P>
<P>
"He was susceptible to blowing his top," said one neighbor. He said McGrath and 
Taylor argued frequently. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, many said, he doted on his 2-year-old son. "He was crazy about him," one 
resident said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to serving a jail sentence for drunk driving, court records show 
that McGrath was arrested Sept. 21, 1988, in Los Angeles on suspicion of 
possession and sale of 28.5 grams of cocaine. On Jan. 16, 1990, Van Nuys 
Superior Court Judge Alan B. Haber dismissed the charge at the request of 
prosecutors. The people's motion said it was "in the interests of justice" 
because the defendant is "factually innocent."

CRASH, DISCOVERY OF BODY TIE UP FREEWAY 
</P>

Traffic was disrupted on the Golden State Freeway in Pacoima Wednesday morning 
by a three-car crash and the coincidental discovery of a body from an unrelated 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
The body of an unidentified Latino woman, age 25 to 30, was discovered in brush 
beside the southbound lanes at 9:20 a.m. by a Caltrans worker inspecting a 
guardrail bent by a one-car accident Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Police investigating that accident found no driver and had the auto towed, said 
California Highway Patrol spokesman Dave Padgett. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of dense brush and the body was lying underneath," Padgett said. 
He said the woman may have been ejected when the car hit a guardrail. 
</P>
<P>
CHP officers blocked the Osborne Street on-ramp to the southbound lanes to 
investigate. Shortly afterward, a unrelated accident occurred in the northbound 
lanes when a vehicle rear-ended another, went out of control and collided with 
a third vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Officers described the injuries in the second accident as minor.

OFFICIALS WARN OF FIRE DANGER DUE TO HUGE BUILDUP OF BRUSH; 
</P>
<P>
PENINSULA: THREE BLAZES IN A WEEK HAVE MADE RESIDENTS FEARFUL. THE DENSE BRUSH 
IN INACCESSIBLE CANYONS HAS SPARKED THE GREATEST CONCERN.

<P>
In the wake of three brush fires on the Palos Verdes Peninsula in less than a 
week -- including one Wednesday -- city and fire officials are warning that a 
massive brush buildup in the past few years poses a serious threat to houses, 
though they are hundreds of feet from wooded areas. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent fire charred about two acres of grassy hillside in the gated 
community of Rolling Hills on a hot but windless morning. It caused about 
$3,000 in damage to a barn and resulted in a minor injury to a horse named 
Lucky. Firefighters surrounded the blaze just as it was heading into a deep 
canyon filled with years of accumulated, highly incendiary sage brush. 
</P>
<P>
"If there were wind, God knows what could have happened," said Councilwoman 
Gordana Swanson. 
</P>
<P>
Swanson added that the three fires -- and the Santa Barbara fires that 
destroyed hundreds of homes -- have raised fears among her neighbors that the 
Palos Verdes Peninsula might be the next hot spot. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Fire Battalion Chief Rene Rigaud urged homeowners in the 
exclusive peninsula communities to clear brush beyond the 100- or 130-feet 
perimeter required by city ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
"We are informing people that they may need 200 feet of clearance," Rigaud 
said. "We find that cooperation has increased since the Santa Barbara fire and 
the three fires in the area. We are getting phone calls from people for us to 
come out and inspect." 
</P>
<P>
Citing a recently completed Fire Department survey of brush conditions on the 
peninsula, he said that brush is now so high and dense that a fire "can develop 
flame lengths of 70 feet when it is going up slope. With wind, from 70 to 100 
feet." 
</P>
<P>
Typical winds can carry flying embers much farther, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"Last month, we had a fire on the Palos Verdes Estates golf course, in a small 
canyon in some heavy brush, with just a little bit of wind, the ocean breeze. 
We had five (fire) starts on a wood roof 600 feet away. That is what worries 
us." 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, 13 homes in Rolling Hills were destroyed in the worst fire on the 
Palos Verdes Peninsula within memory. 
</P>
<P>
The Wednesday morning fire was caused when live wires from an exploding 
transformer landed in dry grass, Rigaud said. Fire investigators suspect 
firecrackers as the cause of a Saturday blaze that burned about four acres in 
Rancho Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
The largest fire on the peninsula this season, which burned 10 acres near the 
Palos Verdes Golf Course last Thursday, was started by children playing with 
matches, Rigaud said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been able to hit them hard and heavy with a lot of manpower and 
surround them," Rigaud said. About 120 firefighters responded to the most 
recent blaze. Two helicopters hovered overhead but were not used. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes Estates Councilwoman Ruth Gralow said that the ability of the 
county Fire Department to overwhelm a fire with heavy concentrations of 
personnel and equipment was a major reason the seaside municipality switched 
from its own Fire Department to the larger county unit four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
She said the county department's success during the last week shows that the 
city made the right choice. 
</P>
<P>
But, despite success in battling the fires so far, Rigaud said he worries about 
sage brush -- 20 tons per acre -- lying in inaccessible canyons that might form 
a route for fire between neighborhoods. Sage is particularly combustible 
because of its high oil content. "The brush gets to seven to eight feet high" 
in some canyons, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills Councilwoman Ginny Leeuwenburgh, who observed the Wednesday fire, 
said that canyon is a particular concern because it is loaded with brush and 
runs from land-locked Rolling Hills Estates clear to the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials are conducting a detailed survey of the property lines and brush 
concentrations in an effort to work out an abatement program with the peninsula 
municipalities, which pride themselves on a natural, rustic look. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Warriner, Rancho Palos Verdes superintendent of parks and Palos Verdes 
Estates city forester, said officials are putting fire safety above preserving 
the pristine conditions in undeveloped areas. 
</P>
<P>
"We do have natural parkland areas in Rancho Palos Verdes and Palos Verdes 
Estates," he said. "However, we do have a very aggressive weed abatement 
program. We respond to any and all requests from the Fire Department." 
</P>
<P>
"In our city, where a quarter of our area is parkland," said Gralow, "our 
maintenance guys are working all the time to keep the brush down to Fire 
Department standards." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to brush concentrations, Rigaud said that many houses with wood 
shake roofs pose an extreme risk in a fire. The houses that were lost in the 
1973 fire all had shake roofs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the four peninsula municipalities, only Rolling Hills now requires 
non-combustible roofs, such as ceramic or concrete tile. The ordinance, which 
was passed last year, applies to new construction and renovations but permits 
residents to maintain existing roofs. 
</P>
<P>
"The concern for all of us today is, where are the shake roofs?" said 
Leeuwenburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills Estates requires highly fire-resistant roofs -- which include 
treated shakes -- on new construction and roofs with lesser fire resistance for 
replacements of buildings built before 1980. 
</P>
<P>
In Rancho Palos Verdes and Palos Verdes Estates, roof regulations vary from 
neighborhood to neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Gralow said she raised the question of shake roofs in the Valmonte area of 
Palos Verdes Estates at the Tuesday night council meeting. "We could consider 
banning them in the future," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Palos Verdes Councilman Bob Ryan said it might be a good idea to require 
all residents to replace shake roofs, perhaps during a four- to five-year grace 
period. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been very lucky we haven't had one of these fires. We are going to 
have (to) do something," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I live on a canyon myself, and I have a shake roof," he said, adding that he 
would put a tile roof on his house in conjunction with an upcoming building 
addition. "The shake makes it look 'foresty,' but they scare me."

MAN'S DEATH HEIGHTENS ANTI-POLICE TENSIONS 
</P>

<P>
When John Santos collapsed in a courtyard at Dana Strand Village last weekend, 
the stage was set for a new kind of gang war in Wilmington -- this one against 
Los Angeles police. 
</P>
<P>
The housing project long has been under siege by gang members and drug dealers. 
Police sweeps are common and unpopular. And because of a recent wave of 
pay-back shootings throughout Wilmington, tensions in the project were already 
high when Santos died last Saturday morning, choking on a tiny plastic bag he 
apparently swallowed as he ran from two officers. 
</P>
<P>
So those who know Dana Strand will tell you it was no surprise that gang 
members swore revenge on police. What was a surprise, though, were the direct 
threats painted on the project's walls. And when shots rang out from the 
projects early Sunday morning, grazing one of two officers patrolling the area 
in a squad car, those who know Dana Strand knew they had trouble on their 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a matter of time before something like this happened," said Dee 
Wiggington, president of the Harbor area's Mothers Against Gangs Support 
Services. "Some gang members were looking for someone to die so they could say, 
'See. See. See what the cops do to us.' " 
</P>
<P>
Added Harbor Division Detective Kim Wierman: "This wasn't just one big step. 
The gang violence has been escalating for the last year." 
</P>
<P>
Rumors that Santos had been the victim of police brutality immediately spread 
through the project after his death. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, however, the coroner's office confirmed the initial police 
reports -- that Santos choked on a baggy containing a still-undetermined white 
substance. Further tests will be done to determine the substance. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope this puts things to rest," Harbor Division Cmdr. Joe DeLadurantey 
said late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But neither he nor others could say for sure that it will. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been dirty rough lately," one senior citizen said this week as he slowly 
walked away from the project, just east of the Harbor Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Rough enough that Harbor Division's officers were warned during this week's 
roll calls to be especially careful. Rough enough that community activists have 
descended on Dana Strand, urging gang members to keep cool. And rough enough 
that Capt. DeLadurantey was persuaded by the mothers against gangs group and 
others to postpone a visit to Dana Strand. 
</P>
<P>
"We know he wants to do right, but we're afraid things are too hot right now," 
said Wiggington. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not they are overreacting, DeLadurantey has honored their request. 
"They may know better than I do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to police and Dana Strand residents, it was just after 3 a.m. 
Saturday when "Big John" Santos, a stocky 21-year-old who lived a block away 
from the project, walked toward its nerve center -- a circular driveway where 
sundown brings out gang members and some of Los Angeles' most active drug 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
Some homeboys from Hawthorne were there that night, partying with the regulars. 
By the time Santos arrived, the police were already there. And he, like other 
gang members, began running when officers began making arrests, according to 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
"Some gang members ran because they were carrying drugs. And when one runs, 
they all run," explained one mother of a gang member. 
</P>
<P>
As Santos ran west through the project, he began to move almost in slow motion, 
according to Sylvia Hernandez, a longtime resident of Dana Strand. 
</P>
<P>
"He was running so slow, he looked like he was almost limping," she said. "And 
then he fell." 
</P>
<P>
At that point, according to police and witnesses, it was clear that Santos was 
choking. "He kept saying, 'I can't breathe. I can't breathe," said Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents said that moments before they had heard a young man yelling as 
if he was being hit. But police insist that no officers touched Santos until 
after he had collapsed. According to police, the two officers closest to Santos 
were 20 feet away when he fell. 
</P>
<P>
As the 5-foot-11, 220-pound Santos lay choking, a small crowd of bystanders 
demanded that the officers use cardiopulmonary resuscitation. But that was 
useless, the officers explained, because Santos' windpipe was blocked. 
</P>
<P>
For several minutes, the officers unsuccessfully attempted to clear Santos' 
throat by using the Heimlich Maneuver. When that failed, paramedics also tried 
in vain to clear Santos' windpipe before rushing him to nearby Kaiser 
Permanente Hospital in Harbor City. 
</P>
<P>
There, at 4:05 a.m. Saturday, Santos was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
By Saturday night, word had spread through the projects that the officers were 
to blame for Santos' death -- that they had beaten him and didn't take the 
right steps to save him. The gang members held a wake, promising revenge, and 
aired that threat with graffiti that covered several walls of the project. The 
threats, such as "LAPD Wanted 1 Dead," were painted over Monday morning by city 
work crews. 
</P>
<P>
Before the graffiti was removed, however, two officers driving past Dana Strand 
at 2 a.m. Sunday were fired on by someone in the projects. A bullet ricocheted 
off the patrol car, grazing Officer Don Linfield's arm. 
</P>
<P>
Even as community activists, gang specialists and Santos' family pleaded for 
calm in the aftermath of the shooting, some gang members continued to make 
threats. 
</P>
<P>
"It's bad, really bad," Christina Luna, a longtime Wilmington resident said 
Wednesday after she visited Dana Strand as part of the effort to calm tensions. 
"They keep saying they want to take out an officer. And that's crazy. We don't 
need any more of this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the threats, police response to the gang threats so far has been 
measured. DeLadurantey has declined offers from LAPD headquarters to 
temporarily provide the Harbor Division with more officers. For the time being, 
he said, he wants the tensions eased by his own officers. And the community. 
</P>
<P>
"We just want everyone to know the truth of what happened. This is not somebody 
who died at the hands of a police officer. This is someone who, we believe, 
died by his own hands," DeLadurantey said. "And we believe he died because of a 
disease that this community has to rise above. Drugs and gangs are not just 
police issues."

JOHN PHILIP CLARK; TEACHER, MUSICIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Philip Clark, a longtime Harvard School science teacher who played 
Renaissance music with a four-piece ensemble, has died in Burbank. He was 53. 
</P>
<P>
Clark had taught at the private school in Studio City since 1961 and was 
responsible for helping the students achieve higher test scores in science, 
said Steve Shaw, a spokesman for the school. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, a resident of North Hollywood, died Monday of respiratory complications, 
Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
Born Jan. 21, 1937, in Merced, he was raised in Mountain View and attended Cal 
Poly San Luis Obispo, for two years before receiving a bachelor's degree in 
science from UC Riverside. He later received a teaching credential at the 
University of Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
He taught science at Burbank High School from 1959 to 1961 before starting at 
Harvard School, where he taught electricity and magnetism, engineering 
principals, physics and physical science. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 24 years, Clark was chairman of the science department. He also 
coached a student on the 1987 U.S. team in the International Physics Olympiad. 
Last year, Stanford University awarded him the Fredrick Emmons Terman 
Scholastic Award for teaching excellence. 
</P>
<P>
Clark also played Renaissance and baroque music with a group called the 
Renaissance Revival for 25 years and established a recorder club at Harvard 
School. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by a brother, Charles Clark of Mountlake Terrace, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service is scheduled for Aug. 26 at St. Saviour's Chapel at Harvard 
School, 3700 Coldwater Canyon Ave., Studio City. Burial will be private. 
Donations can be made in Clark's name to the John Clark Science Fund at Harvard 
School. The Valley Funeral Home in Burbank handled the arrangements.

2 MEN ARRESTED IN SHOOTING FOUND WITH LOAD OF WEAPONS

Two men are being held in County Jail after police arrested them and seized 
several weapons, including a homemade pipe bomb, a fully loaded AK-47 rifle and 
a couple of handguns, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Dan Latil, 29, of La Costa and John Scott Blake, 36, of San Diego are 
being held on $300,000 bail each at County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after midnight Wednesday, San Diego police answered a call that someone 
was pointing a gun at a man in the 5000 block of Biltmore Street in Clairemont. 
Alan Goddu, 39, told police that two men had threatened him with the gun, then 
driven away. While he tried to get the license number, the men fired four shots 
at him, said Detective Carlos Garcia of the Metro Arson Strike Team, which was 
brought in because of the explosives found. 
</P>
<P>
No one was hurt, and police are not sure of the motive for the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
About two hours later, San Diego Police Officers Bob Lopez and Paul Peregud saw 
the car on Moraga Drive in Clairemont and pulled it over at Idlewild Way, 
Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
A search of the car turned up a .45-caliber handgun, a .25-caliber handgun, a 
small homemade bomb, a homemade pipe bomb, an AK-47 rifle, a hand-held 
spotlight and a small quantity of a substance believed to be methamphetamine, 
Garcia said. All the firearms were loaded. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia said he doesn't know why the pair were carrying so many weapons. 
</P>
<P>
According to a spokeswoman at the jail, Latil and Blake are both being held on 
suspicion of assault with a gun, possession of a destructive device and 
transportation of a destructive device. 
</P>
<P>
They are also being held on suspicion of selling a destructive device, carrying 
a loaded gun, carrying a concealed weapon in a vehicle without a license, 
possessing a controlled substance, being under the influence of a controlled 
substance and threatening a person with a firearm. 
</P>
<P>
Latil is also being held on suspicion of driving under the influence of drugs.

Two police cars collided Wednesday while responding to a call from an officer 
chasing a suspected car thief on foot, a police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers Bradley Phelps and James Dossett were treated at Mercy Hospital, a 
hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The other officer, Freddie Thornton, was being kept overnight for observation 
because he lost consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
Thornton and Phelps were in one car and Dossett in the other, when they hit on 
Gamma Street between 38th and 39th streets, police spokesman David Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
The three were responding to a call for help from Officer Constantine Markes, 
who was pursuing a man he suspected was driving a stolen car. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested Luis Morales Martinez, 19, who is being held in County Jail on 
$5,000 bail on suspicion of car theft. A jail spokeswoman also said there was 
an immigration hold on Morales.

150 DOGS, CATS REMOVED FROM LANCASTER HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County animal control officers removed more than 150 dogs and cats 
Wednesday night from a house in a rural Lancaster neighborhood after a woman 
trying to return a lost dog to its owner reported "atrocious conditions" there. 
</P>
<P>
Animal Control Officer Alex Flores said Roger Wooten, owner of the Bar Mae 
Kennel, located in the 3200 block of West Avenue N, would be cited for cruelty 
to animals. 
</P>
<P>
More than 153 dogs and cats of various breeds were removed from the chain-link 
runs behind Wooten's house, Flores said. He said he believed most of the 
animals belonged to Wooten. 
</P>
<P>
Officials were alerted to the problem by a woman who had advertised in a local 
paper to find the owner of a lost dog that she found. After receiving a call, 
she went to the kennel to return the dog, and saw animals in crowded and 
unsanitary conditions, Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
Flores said the animals' health would be checked and they would be taken to 
county animal shelters.

A 58-year-old man died early Wednesday when he was hit by a car while 
jaywalking, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Francis Little, who lived in the 600 block of F Street in San Diego, 
died at the scene shortly after 2 a.m., said a spokesman for the medical 
examiner's office. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Little was crossing 10th Avenue, between E and F streets, when he 
was hit, said Police Sgt. Michael Healey. 
</P>
<P>
Healey said the driver, 62-year-old Alex Acosta of Mira Mesa, was not cited 
because Little was at fault. 
</P>
<P>
"The driver had just left a green light and didn't even have time to react," 
Healey said.

A $600,000 payment has been made to the San Diego Unified Port District by an 
auto-parts manufacturer as a settlement for money lost in an illegal purchasing 
scheme involving port and company personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The purchasing scam led to convictions of several Port District employees and a 
manager for a Genuine/Napa parts store on 12th Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The scam involved billing the port for parts and service it never received. The 
bills were used to cover up the purchase of items such as computers and 
television sets that were given to some Port District employees and their 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the scheme went on several years and may have cost the 
Port District more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
'Without admitting any liability, Genuine Parts has paid the Port District 
$600,000 as settlement in full of all claims which the Port District might have 
against Genuine Parts or any related entities," a statement released by the 
Board of Port Commissioners said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Port District and Genuine Parts have agreed to this settlement to avoid 
burdensome and expensive litigation which would tie up their employees and 
resources, as well as the resources of the courts, for several years." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Genuine Parts declined comment.

ON A ONCE QUIET STREET VIOLENCE REACHES A COUPLE'S FRONT DOOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY and AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Early Wednesday morning, a man who had been chased by an attacker through a 
Sepulveda neighborhood and shot in the back desperately pounded on the door at 
Bill and Ruth Smith's home and then collapsed on the front porch. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Smith called police and then watched through closed windows until officers 
and paramedics arrived. The retired couple has lived in the 8500 block of Orion 
Avenue for 20 years. In recent years they have watched crime problems increase. 
</P>
<P>
But the shots and screams and terror were far from anything that the Smiths 
ever expected would happen so close. Likewise, residents on Orion expressed 
shock over Wednesday's shooting, which left two sisters dead and a man in 
critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
Although Wednesday's shooting was motivated by an apparent domestic dispute, 
which many neighbors said could happen anyplace, they said they were left 
wondering if it was one more step in the decline of their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"The violence is getting closer all the time," Ruth Smith said. "We had been 
wondering how far things could go. We have considered moving, but we haven't 
made up our mind. This certainly makes you think again." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police said the shooting was rooted in domestic problems between 
the gunman and two of the victims, who lived five houses from the Smiths. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Dean Roger McGrath, 29, entered a duplex and fatally shot sisters 
Marleene Evelyn Taylor, 32, and Kathleen Taylor Fien, 30. Anthony Deluca, 28, 
ran from the house calling for help, but the gunman chased him down and shot 
him in the back, police said. He collapsed on the Smiths' front porch and was 
in critical condition at an undisclosed hospital. McGrath was arrested about 12 
hours after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood of small, neatly kept houses and a few small businesses runs 
alongside the San Diego Freeway and is just one block south of a neighborhood 
where streets were barricaded by police this year in an effort to curtail drug 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
Most houses are surrounded by fences, and there are many "Beware of Dog" signs. 
The noise of the freeway is tamed by a concrete sound barrier that rises behind 
the homes. But some residents said little has stopped crime from creeping into 
the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, residents signed petitions and got the city to close a 
pedestrian tunnel under the freeway because it was being used by drug dealers. 
But residents such as Frances Beals said she still sees drugs and prostitution 
making inroads on the street. 
</P>
<P>
"I can look out my windows and see them doing their thing -- they're still 
around," said Beals, who runs an auto towing business from her house. 
</P>
<P>
Beals said she believes many of the problems might be the result of the 
barricades across streets in the neighborhood to the north. Police acknowledge 
that the roadblocks have displaced some of the crime, but officers said no 
single neighborhood has borne the brunt of that migration. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Ventrella has owned a nursery on the block for five years. During that 
time, she has seen the neighborhood change gradually from a friendly place 
where young families established their first homes to one where residents are 
more and more on edge. 
</P>
<P>
"It's scary," she said. Many families have moved away in the last few years 
because crime on neighboring streets has crept closer, she said.

PALOS VERDES NAMES NEW SCHOOLS SUPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET RAE-DUPREE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former South Bay resident who heads the Covina school district was named 
superintendent of the Palos Verdes Unified School District on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Michael W. Caston, 42, is to join the 8,900-student district Aug. 1. He 
replaces Jack Price, who resigned last October in the wake of public scrutiny 
stemming from a school board vote to close Miraleste High School. A lawsuit 
prevented the closure. 
</P>
<P>
Retired Supt. Wayne Butterbaugh has been acting head of the district for the 
past nine months. 
</P>
<P>
Caston was raised in the South Bay and graduated from Torrance's South High 
School in 1967. He began his teaching career in 1971 at Miraleste High School, 
and he said Wednesday he has long wished to return to Palos Verdes as its 
school superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a long-term professional goal," he said at a reception attended 
by district staff members and community leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Caston said he will be paid $115,000 a year -- $26,000 more than his salary at 
Charter Oak Unified School District in Covina, and $33,000 more than Price was 
earning when he resigned from the Palos Verdes district. 
</P>
<P>
"The salary is a reflection of the housing costs here and what it will take to 
move here," Caston said. 
</P>
<P>
Caston, who is married and has two sons, has a bachelor's degree in biology and 
education from Northern Arizona University, and a master's degree and a 
doctorate from USC, where he specialized in curriculum, instruction and 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving his teaching post at Miraleste, Caston served as an elementary 
school principal in the Westminster Elementary District. He later moved to the 
Capistrano Unified School District, where he was an intermediate school 
assistant principal and principal. 
</P>
<P>
He joined the Charter Oak district in 1980 as director of personnel. He quickly 
became an assistant superintendent and, in 1985, was named superintendent of 
the 6,000-student district. 
</P>
<P>
Caston said he is aware of the Palos Verdes district's turmoil, which placed 
Price at the center of a bitter two-year battle between the school board and a 
parents group that has fought to keep Miraleste High School open. Critics of 
the district also have questioned a number of management practices. 
</P>
<P>
Caston said he intends to institute open-door policies that he hopes will help 
resolve the disputes. "It's going to be difficult and it's going to take time, 
but with strong communication I think it can be done," he said.

UC SYSTEM ADMISSIONS POLICIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a 1990 graduate of UCLA I felt compelled to respond to the University of 
California admissions policy articles ("Should UC Admissions Set Ethnic and 
Racial Goals?" Opinion, July 1). John H. Bunzel ("Standards Must Remain High") 
is right on target while Raymond Paredes ("UC Diversity Critical Goal") 
perpetuates the ever-growing cycle of reverse discrimination prevalent at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
As Bunzel states, the minority students are exactly those who drop out despite 
special enrollment and tutoring privileges. 
</P>
<P>
These students who are clearly less academically qualified and often prove 
themselves scholastically incompetent at the university level are being chosen 
over white and Asian students with 4.0 grade point averages who are exactly the 
people who graduate due to their drive to succeed. It is a crime that qualified 
students are being turned away due to their race. 
</P>
<P>
Paredes assumes all whites are rich and privileged while all Latinos are poor 
and deserving of special treatment. This is blatantly false. People of all 
races span the gamut of wealth. The admissions system should help students of 
poverty overcome their hardship regardless of race. Excellent students of all 
racial and economic backgrounds should be sought. UC admission should be a 
search for those motivated to succeed and be the future leaders. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA has become a racial battleground due to the UC system's pandering to 
minorities. They get special treatment on entry, while enrolled and on entry to 
graduate school. When does it stop? When is the UC system going to strive for 
excellence and stop lowering academic standards in order to obtain the 
so-called correct proportion of minorities? What happened to our values of 
individualism and self-determination or are these too destroyed in the name of 
diversity?

COUNTY'S REDISTRICTING CASE AND EDELMAN'S APPROACH TO POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In describing the unconscionable and arrogant conduct of Supervisors Deane 
Dana, Pete Schabarum and Michael Antonovich, Domanick's article is a lucid 
illustration of why the voters of Malibu on June 6 overwhelmingly voted to 
become a city. 
</P>
<P>
And, his statement is correct that everyone even vaguely familiar with the 
workings of the Board of Supervisors is either choking with outrage or shaking 
their heads in bemusement. 
</P>
<P>
Our voters undoubtedly felt outrage. It took these three supervisors to get the 
voters in Malibu finally to approve cityhood -- something they had rejected 
three times in past years. Although it is hard to envision right now, maybe 
history will show through their abusive excesses they were Malibu's best 
friends, after all.

Sure, it's a dangerous question to ask in a region that calls its highways 
freeways. But consider some cost-benefit facts. Californians pay about a penny 
a mile in gas tax. Society pays, one way or another, half again that much per 
mile just for the trail of air pollution that automobiles leave. 
</P>
<P>
None of this pollution mathematics is new to theoretical economists. But it was 
largely overlooked until environmentalists and smog and transportation planners 
realized that solving the congestion problem would help reduce smog. Idling 
cars and ones that go slow cause more air problems than vehicles that are 
moving efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
So now the experts are dusting off the notion that the same kind of pricing 
mechanism that rightly discourages companies from selling $5 products for $1 
might serve to persuade commuters to double up, triple up or even delay a 
commute in ways that traditional regulations may not. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the statistics that underpin the concept of market forces in 
transportation seem solid enough. Others largely result from random curiosity 
among economists and transportation buffs -- and from the understandable desire 
to see if there isn't some viable alternative to the regulatory approach to the 
air quality problem. 
</P>
<P>
Some people are attracted to price mechanisms because they put market forces in 
the driver's seat instead of impersonal -- and sometimes imperfect -- 
regulatory bureaucracies. Some business leaders are interested in pricing 
mechanisms because it is a world they are familiar with. They understand that 
no company can stay in business spending $5 to build a product it can sell for 
only $1. Government can get away with this sort of behavior longer than a 
manufacturer who is held by the invisible hand of market economics. But not 
even government can do it forever. 
</P>
<P>
But even if all the pricing statistics were beyond dispute, the approach -- 
which perhaps unavoidably gets reduced to "commuter fees" -- needs testing to 
verify that it is not just another way to make life even more difficult for the 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
These studies and tests may well be the most important task before the region's 
big transportation and smog control regions -- the Southern California Assn. of 
Governments and the South Coast Air Quality Management District. They should 
get on with it. If not, the Legislature, which has been looking for ways to 
move Southern California toward regional government, should direct the agencies 
to do a joint study of market-oriented approaches and find the funds for them. 
</P>
<P>
As a bonus, the effort might even provide something of a real-life starter test 
of a regional government approach to air quality.

CLARIFYING POINT ON TORRANCE'S PAY ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The excellent reporting (Times, June 21) of the recommendation of the League of 
Women Voters of Torrance for charter review included a quote from Councilman 
Dan Walker -- "I don't want a raise. I don't want to ask for a raise. 
</P>
<P>
You serve as an elected official because you like it." His statement is a 
moving tribute to public service, but he misses our point. 
</P>
<P>
The league is not supporting increased or decreased compensation for council 
members. We support removing a specific figure of compensation from the 
charter. Such mention is inappropriate and unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
The Torrance City Council deals with this issue by resolution. Council members 
can receive more than $800 per month, of which only $250 is for reimbursable 
expenses. The city charter states that compensation is $100 per month. The 
league believes this discrepancy is misleading. 
</P>
<P>
The charter is overdue for review by a broad-based citizen's committee. That is 
our main recommendation to the Torrance City Council, based on several 
obsolete, confusing and illegal sections of the charter. Councilman Walker's 
comments frame the issue as one of council compensation. We feel this is too 
narrow an interpretation of our recommendation.

UC SYSTEM ADMISSIONS POLICIES

<P>
This letter is to point out what may be a faulty assumption in Bunzel's 
criticism of AB 462. He assumes that standard tests are excellent measures of 
intelligence, which is questionable. 
</P>
<P>
What they seem to measure are memorization and test-taking ability. 
Unfortunately for our society, this ability does not seem to generalize to the 
real world, where problems need to be solved, rather than exams passed. The 
street-wise student with lower grades depicted in Paredes' case study is more 
likely to have real intelligence than the other student with higher grades. 
Perhaps a cultural diversity law would be a blessing in disguise for the higher 
education system, jolting it into reforming its ineffective selection and 
teaching practices.

COUNTY'S REDISTRICTING CASE AND EDELMAN'S APPROACH TO POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joe Domanick's column ("Save for His Seat, the Passion Was Missing," 
Commentary, July 3) may have made a good polemic, but it falls woefully short 
on making its case. 
</P>
<P>
There's no denying that with the passage of Prop. 13 in 1978, which sharply cut 
property taxes -- at one time, the county's principal revenue source -- and the 
election of a new conservative board majority in 1980, funding for social 
services in Los Angeles County has taken a severe beating. 
</P>
<P>
For the last decade, Supervisor Kenneth Hahn and myself have been fighting a 
rear-guard action to preserve what we must, and improve where we can in a true 
"era of limits." 
</P>
<P>
I chose to work patiently and persistently to assemble working coalitions, 
issue by issue and one-on-one with my colleagues, to achieve our aims. 
</P>
<P>
Admittedly, this approach offers less political drama than Domanick would like. 
But in the last few years alone, my efforts have averted potentially crippling 
strikes by county nurses, and by caseworkers in the Department of Children's 
Services; kept open county health and mental-health clinics slated for closure; 
increased AIDS funding; led to this year's groundbreaking for a new Children's 
Court facility for cases involving abused and neglected youngsters; improved 
hazardous materials management; kept intact the Community Youth Gang Services 
anti-gang violence program; initiated a county government recycling program, 
and created an agency to help retrain displaced aerospace workers, to name only 
some of the areas we have addressed successfully.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN GETS 8 YEARS IN DRUG-RELATED KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Palmdale man was sentenced Wednesday to eight years in prison for shooting a 
man to death in the desert east of Palmdale during a dispute over drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Millward, 32, was sentenced as part of an agreement in which the defendant 
pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in the July 5, 1987, killing of Bruce 
Gruber, 28, of Yucca Valley. 
</P>
<P>
In return, prosecutors agreed not to proceed with the first-degree murder 
charge originally filed against Millward. 
</P>
<P>
Millward was acquitted of murder in the death of a second man, Albert Dulyea, 
37, of Norwalk, whose body was found in Millward's garage the same day Gruber 
was shot. In an earlier trial for the two slayings last October, jurors 
deadlocked over whether Millward murdered Gruber. Millward was facing a retrial 
in the Gruber slaying when prosecutors offered him the plea bargain last month. 
</P>
<P>
Millward's attorney, Alex R. Kessel, contended Wednesday that another man 
actually shot Gruber. He said Gruber and Danny Lucero, 22, of Palmdale had ties 
to a methamphetamine lab next to Millward's property and wanted to "pay back" 
Millward for reportedly telling law enforcement officials about the drug lab. 
Lucero was aiming a rifle at Millward when he accidentally shot Gruber, Kessel 
contended. 
</P>
<P>
But Lucero, who testified as a prosecution witness at the trial, said he was 
driving in the area with his family when he saw Millward shoot Gruber in the 
head. Lucero said he contacted sheriff's deputies, who arrested Millward after 
a search of the crime scene, near 240th Street East and Avenue P. 
</P>
<P>
A second suspect allegedly fled and has not been found by police.

2 CAL STATE UNIVERSITIES TO OFFER COLLEGE COURSES IN THE ANTELOPE VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Education-hungry Antelope Valley residents got good news Wednesday as both Cal 
State Los Angeles and Cal State Bakersfield announced plans to offer college 
courses in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
Educators said the two universities will broaden the limited college course 
offerings in the area. They also said they hope that interest in the courses 
will demonstrate their belief that the area can support a four-year public 
university. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pleased to see the increased interest in the Antelope Valley by the CSU 
system," said Allan Kurki, president of Antelope Valley College. The two-year 
community college is the only public institution of higher learning for the 
valley and its 200,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
Starting in September, plans call for Cal State Los Angeles to offer nine 
junior- and senior-level business and computer courses a year, officials said. 
And in January, plans call for Cal State Bakersfield to offer three graduate 
classes for public school teachers and administrators. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal State Los Angeles courses will be held mostly at Antelope Valley 
College on Friday nights and Saturdays, officials said. Cal State Bakersfield 
courses will probably be held at an area high school at similar times. None of 
those classes can be offered by the community college. 
</P>
<P>
Neither university has offered classes in the Antelope Valley before. 
University officials said their entry stems from local interest and the absence 
of offerings from Cal State Northridge, the state university that is supposed 
to serve the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN has offered only sporadic classes in the Antelope Valley and none in the 
past year, officials said. Northridge officials said Wednesday that the 
university could not afford programs in the Antelope Valley without 
shortchanging the university's main or Ventura campuses. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Suzuki, CSUN's vice president for academic affairs, said the university 
already has too many students and is having to turn many away. But Cal State 
Los Angeles is experiencing declining enrollment and is looking for new 
students and the money they bring, Suzuki said. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal State Los Angeles business and computer classes in the Antelope Valley 
will count toward bachelor degrees in those fields, but students would have to 
attend a four-year institution to complete their degree requirements. The 
university chose business classes because they are the most popular among 
students, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The only other four-year college courses now offered in the Antelope Valley are 
for an undergraduate nursing program offered through Cal State Dominguez Hills, 
and a series of undergraduate and graduate degree programs offered at a center 
run by the private, Orange County-based Chapman College.

COUNCIL HEARS AIRPORT EXPANSION PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
HAWTHORNE: RECEPTION TO PROPOSAL IS LUKEWARM. MORE HEARINGS ARE REQUIRED BEFORE 
CONDEMNATION OF HOMES CAN OCCUR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A renovation and expansion plan for the Hawthorne Municipal Airport, which 
could lead to the removal of about 170 homes, received a lukewarm reception 
from some City Council members and homeowners at a public hearing earlier this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
The Monday hearing came three years after Hawthorne airport officials first 
proposed the building plan for the tiny airport to make room for more aircraft 
and businesses. By law, more hearings must be held before any homes could be 
acquired for the general aviation airport's expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Airport Manager Robert Trimborn, who opened the 1 1/2-hour hearing with a 
20-minute video about the growing use and importance of private planes, told 
the standing-room-only audience that the expansion and renovation are needed to 
attract businesses to the city and to handle overflow traffic from Los Angeles 
International. 
</P>
<P>
Although about 250 aircraft are now parked at the airport, airport officials 
estimate they will need space for a total of 467 hangars by 1996 to keep up 
with rising demand, according to a report compiled by Franzoy-Corey airport 
consultants. At the same time, the number of takeoffs and landings at the 
airport is expected to rise from 101,758 in 1989 to 198,900 in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
"As freeway and surface transportation becomes more and more congested, more 
companies in the region will look to the air to move their employees and 
executives, saving valuable staff time and frustration," Trimborn said. "By 
improving and upgrading the Hawthorne Municipal Airport, hopefully more 
corporations will locate near the airport to take advantage (of) the access it 
provides to the area." 
</P>
<P>
Although the council has not yet agreed to expand the airport, state law 
requires that it adopt a blueprint for future airport development decisions. At 
the end of the hearing Monday night, the council voted unanimously to have the 
city attorney draft a resolution to adopt such a blueprint, known as a master 
plan. The council is expected to vote on it next month. 
</P>
<P>
The council would not be obligated to develop the airport according to the 
plan. But opponents of the expansion used the hearing to air fears of losing 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
All of the 170 homes that could be affected, if the council decides to expand 
the airport to the full extent outlined in the plan, are north of the airport, 
between Prairie Avenue and the Century Freeway. Most of the homes lie along 
119th and 120th Streets in an area where property values have been depressed by 
nearby construction of the Century Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the homeowners, who narrowly escaped having their homes condemned 
several years ago to make room for the freeway, said it wouldn't be fair to 
remove homes and relocate families for the benefit of a privileged elite who 
use the airport for business and recreation. 
</P>
<P>
"To ask people to give up their hard-earned real estate interests for someone 
else's recreation puts a different color on what's being asked for here," said 
Joe Moshe, 37, a Westchester pilot whose parents own a residence that they rent 
out near the Hawthorne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Read, who has lived near the airport since the early 1960s, agreed, 
telling the council that he and other homeowners fear they would not be justly 
compensated for their homes. 
</P>
<P>
"It is nice to have an airport in town, but we're all very concerned over 
there, and we want you to think very seriously about us because we've had a lot 
of buffeting over the (Century) freeway," Read said. "We've been unable to sell 
our property for the amount we should receive because we've had (the freeway) 
hanging over our heads." 
</P>
<P>
The council members, however, took turns assuring residents that no portion of 
the four-phase plan would be adopted without public hearings and that voting 
for the master plan does not keep the council from modifying it. 
</P>
<P>
"This is nothing more than merely a plan," Councilman David M. York said. "It 
doesn't guarantee that anything is going to be done." 
</P>
<P>
Added Councilman Steven Andersen: "This is not an authorization to fire up the 
bulldozers and start taking people's homes." 
</P>
<P>
Airport officials began improving the airport grounds in 1984 by installing new 
runway lights, adding hangars and areas where planes can be tied down, and 
repaving inner roads. 
</P>
<P>
In the next two years, they are planning to spend $1.3 million -- 90% in 
federal funds -- to revamp taxiway lights, improve the drainage system and 
paint hangars. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed plan, which identifies those improvements as the airport's first 
renovation phase, outlines three more possible development phases, all of which 
call for expanding the airport grounds into a largely residential area. 
</P>
<P>
The plan also drew criticism from some whose homes would not be threatened. 
Hawthorne community activist Martha Bails, who lives outside the proposed 
expansion area, said Monday she opposes enlarging the airport because of the 
noise that additional airplanes would generate. 
</P>
<P>
An environmental impact report and noise compatibility report said the number 
of homes affected by airport noise would more than triple -- from about 50 to 
170 -- if all phases of the building plan are adopted.

SOCIETY: MERCY HOSPITAL HOLDS GALA CENTENNIAL BASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The biggest brouhaha of the weekend was given, not inappropriately, in a 
brewery. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Mercy Hospital and Medical Center rolled out a red carpet on the 
same sidewalk where workers at the old Mission Brewery used to roll out the 
barrel. 
</P>
<P>
The renovated building near Old Town, now called Mission Brewery Plaza, was 
built in 1913 and recently gained an entry on the National Register of Historic 
Places. The complex is scheduled to be turned into a collection of shops and 
eateries. 
</P>
<P>
Mercy deemed the brick structure sufficiently dignified by age to be the site 
of the gala celebration that marked the hospital's centennial. Mercy's actual 
100th birthday followed two days later on July 9. 
</P>
<P>
None of the event's organizers had an exact tally of the crowd -- all the 
public areas were, relatively speaking, jammed to the rafters -- but most 
agreed that upward of 700 guests showed up to salute the dowager among San 
Diego health care providers. 
</P>
<P>
And the guest list was an unusually inclusive one, since the party was -- most 
surprisingly for these times -- simply a party, rather than a fund-raiser. 
Chief among the invited (some of whom were among the more than 200,000 
graduates of the hospital's nursery who collectively are known as "Babes of 
Mercy") were representatives of local institutions, municipalities and 
businesses whose founding predated Mercy's 1890 opening. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, one of the oldest organizations represented (by Executive 
Director James Vaughan) was the San Diego Historical Society, which was founded 
in 1850, a time when the population of Old Town included not a single 
slow-growth advocate. The society's founding, in fact, preceded the 
organization of both the San Diego police and fire departments by 39 years. 
Both departments also sent representatives to the gala. 
</P>
<P>
In 1850, the most venerable institution memorialized by the historical society 
was Mission San Diego de Alcala. Founded in 1769 by Father Junipero Serra, the 
mission was the cornerstone of what has become the country's sixth largest 
city. The mission parish remains an active force today and was represented at 
the gala by Msgr. I. Brent Eagen. 
</P>
<P>
Among other honorees whose centennials already have passed were Coronado and 
National City; the law firm of Luce, Forward, Hamilton &amp; Scripps; the San 
Diego Yacht Club and the San Diego Rowing Club; the Sweetwater Authority; the 
San Diego Center for Children and Pacific Beach Presbyterian Church. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital used the brewery's weathered bricks as a stage setting for a 
series of historical vignettes that attempted to recapture the flavor of early 
days in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
At the entrance, a scene titled "The Territories" emphasized the frontier towns 
of San Pasqual, Ramona and Lakeside that flourished after the 1869 discovery of 
gold in Julian. A country-Western band called Greasewood completed the effect. 
</P>
<P>
In the brewery plaza, the Mercy Marimba Band and the Solera Flamenco Dance 
Company helped guests to digest the guacamole dip while they examined a scene 
called "The Early Californios." The scene dealt with the remote past; from the 
founding of the mission until Alonzo Horton built his New Town in 1867. 
</P>
<P>
Hazlett's Dixie Hasslers provided slightly more contemporary entertainment in a 
tribute to the beaches, the ocean and the famed "tent city" erected for decades 
as a summer encampment just to the north of Hotel del Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
Invitations urged guests to dress in the style of a favorite period. By 
evening's end, a good many Victorian ladies and gentlemen (these get-ups are 
the most easily found at local costume shops) had managed to anoint their 
rented duds with splatters of oil from the tempura-fried vegetable station. 
</P>
<P>
There were also many vaqueros and a few fetching senoritas, but, surprisingly 
enough, there wasn't a single surfer dude in the pack. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most vigorously Victorian was Richard Keyser, Mercy's president and 
chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
"The neatest thing about turning 100 is that you made it," he said. "You have 
to be doing something good for the community to last a century." 
</P>
<P>
Keyser added that he expects the institution to continue in the traditions 
established by Mother Mary Michael and Sister Mary Alphonsus, the Sisters of 
Mercy who in 1890 opened St. Joseph's Dispensary, forerunner of Mercy Hospital, 
at the corner of 6th Avenue and Market Street. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the values Mercy was founded on will last us at least another 
century," he said. "Changes in society will continue at an accelerated pace, 
and I think the value system that is the foundation of the hospital will smooth 
that change, because we believe deeply in the dignity of the human person." 
</P>
<P>
Sister Mary Jo Anderson, the hospital's vice president for community relations 
and long-term care, said Mercy's ongoing salute to the past is accompanied by 
an eye to the future. 
</P>
<P>
"The centennial marks a brand new beginning for us," she said. "We're really 
looking forward to the next 100 years. Being tied into your 'rooted-ness' is 
fine, but you can't live in the past. 'Caring for your future' is the motto for 
our centennial, after all." 
</P>
<P>
The hospital's attention to the future will not preclude further parties, 
according to Mercy Foundation Executive Paulette Gibson, who said the 
Centennial Mercy Ball will be held Oct. 27 at Hotel del Coronado. According to 
a committee member who attended Saturday's gala, "50 yuppies" have been 
dispatched through the county to seek out donations for the auction to be held 
at the ball. 
</P>
<P>
The gala proceeded through the evening with a minimum of speechifying and 
rather more entertainment than is the rule at such gatherings. In addition to 
strolling magicians and singers, the old brewing room was set up as a sort of 
brick temple of Big Bandism by the Benny Hollman Orchestra, which mounted a 
cabaret that kept the room packed. 
</P>
<P>
The guest list included Tom and Donna Sefton, Charles Hellerich, Bill Sauls, 
Dick and Vangie Burt, the Bruce Moores, the Mark Brandons, the Frank Alessios, 
Jim and Ruth Mulvaney, Bill and Kay Rippee, Yolanda Walther-Meade, Ken and Anne 
Brown, Dolly Ragan, Terry and Alice Churchill, Ed Navarro, the Harold Sisks, 
the Frank Radfords, Lawrence and Christine Garcia, and Sister Patricia Ryan of 
Burlingame, president of the Sisters of Mercy.

Job Hunting?: Vice President Dan Quayle did some manual labor Tuesday, helping 
plant sea grass at a renovated park in Tampa, Fla. "I was told as I was 
planting grass that I did an OK job," Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a job after the vice presidency." 
</P>
<P>
* Disclosure: Marvin Liebman, a founder of the modern conservative movement, 
announced his homosexuality Tuesday, hoping to counter what he calls the 
homophobia in right-wing politics. Liebman, 67, made the announcement in 
William F. Buckley's conservative National Review and in the Advocate, a gay 
magazine. Liebman helped found the National Review and the Young Americans for 
Freedom and worked for the American Conservative Union. 
</P>
<P>
* Miles to Go: Gov. John Ashcroft signed legislation Tuesday in Springfield, 
Mo., that made his state the first to give nostalgic Route 66 historic status. 
U.S. 66 was made famous by the 1960s television show "Route 66" and by a song 
performed by the Rolling Stones. The narrow road carried thousands of 
Midwestern job-seekers to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
* Higher Calling: Watergate conspirator Jeb Stuart Magruder has been 
recommended for senior pastor at the First Presbyterian Church in Lexington, 
Ky. Magruder is a pastor in Columbus, Ohio. "I would be able to preach more and 
play the principal leadership role," he said. Magruder served a prison term for 
directing the wiretapping of the Democratic headquarters in the Watergate 
building and other crimes.

ART BUCHWALD: GOLDEN CHANCE FOR SOFT LANDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART BUCHWALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The dream of every good executive is to have a golden parachute, so that if his 
company is ever sold or merged, he can bail out for a soft landing. 
</P>
<P>
The finest golden parachute company is located in Wilmington, Del. A visit 
there gave me an insight into the American business safety net system. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Bradford, the manager of the plant, took me on a tour. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a time when most upper-level executives were satisfied to work just 
for their salaries and pensions. But ever since the hot trading of the '80s, 
everyone wants a golden parachute to protect No. 1. We're backed up on orders." 
</P>
<P>
I walked through the brightly lit, immaculately clean room where people in 
white smocks were bent over sewing machines. 
</P>
<P>
Norman stopped at one and showed me a sample. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a parachute for the CEO of a book publishing house. He heard he was 
being raided by a razor blade company, so he ordered the parachute before the 
raider made a bid." 
</P>
<P>
"Is he worried?" 
</P>
<P>
"He couldn't care less because no matter who buys his publishing house, this 
parachute will guarantee him $30 million." 
</P>
<P>
"What about the shareholders? Do they know he has a golden parachute?" 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt it. There was a time when CEOs worried about the shareholders, but 
they got no thanks for it. So they decided they had to look out for themselves. 
That's why they come here." 
</P>
<P>
"How much does a golden parachute cost?" 
</P>
<P>
"They can run anywhere from $1 million for one year to $100 million for a 
lifetime. When a raider is after another company, he will pay for a 
top-of-the-line parachute so the executive won't fight the buyout. Over here, 
we have a golden parachute of the president of an investment banking company. 
The company lost $800 million last year, but when the firm goes bankrupt, the 
president won't even wind up with a sprained wrist." 
</P>
<P>
"It's remarkable what silk and strings will do for someone who has run his 
company into the ground." 
</P>
<P>
Norman said: "I wish you had put it some other way. With our golden parachutes, 
we are making it possible for the average executive to have a little security 
in an age where sharks are eating dolphins and Wall Street yuppies are tearing 
the heads off chickens. Without parachutes, the American landscape would be 
littered with the bodies of executives who lost their life's savings in junk 
bonds." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying you don't provide a service," I told Norman. "But it seems to 
me that many executives are more interested in getting fitted for a golden 
parachute than they are in running their companies." 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps, but that isn't our worry. We don't ask what the condition of their 
business is. We might assume that anyone ordering a golden parachute is not as 
secure about his business as he would like to be. At the same time, we believe 
such a parachute is as important to the financial health of this country as a 
sushi bar is to Rockefeller Center." 
</P>
<P>
"There's a glass-enclosed booth over there with a gorgeous parachute inside. 
Who is that for?" 
</P>
<P>
Norman whispered, "That's for our chairman of the board." 
</P>
<P>
"He's having one made for himself?" 
</P>
<P>
"Of course. The RJR-Nabisco people have been sniffing around for the past week, 
and our chairman isn't taking any chances."

MAGAZINES: THE TALE OF A DOUBLE STANDARD; 
</P>
<P>
MAGAZINES: HOW THE MEDIA COVER -- AND FAIL TO COVER -- THE BLACK COMMUNITY IS 
THE SUBJECT OF AN EXCELLENT ARTICLE IN THE AMERICAN ENTERPRISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At least three times recently, young black people have attacked news reporters, 
photographers or cameramen covering events in predominantly black communities. 
Black politicians -- including Washington, D.C., Mayor Marion Barry and Jesse 
Jackson -- lash out at the media for an alleged double standard. Polls show 
black mayors think papers do a lousy job of covering the black community, and 
many black media professionals agree. 
</P>
<P>
So what has happened since the days of the Civil Rights struggle, when the 
media and the black community were "de facto allies against Jim Crow?" In the 
July/August The American Enterprise, National Public Radio reporter and UC 
Berkeley journalism professor William J. Drummond presents a number of 
interesting explanations for the "complete about-face of prevailing sentiment" 
toward the media. 
</P>
<P>
Black politicians, he writes, "no longer enjoy the shield of moral leadership 
once accorded them by the civil rights movement. They must take their lumps 
from the press like other politicians, and they find this an unwelcome 
surprise." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, though, Drummond suggests, there is a tendency for the media 
to ignore black politicians on issues other than those directly related to 
their race. All of which is complicated by the fact that minority journalists 
assert their rights as professionals to cover any issue they choose. As a 
result, the reporters who presumably have the greatest insight into and empathy 
for the black community don't want to be pigeonholed into covering it -- not 
that the number of black journalists is even remotely representative of the 
population. 
</P>
<P>
So, where does that leave us? 
</P>
<P>
About where we were after the race riots of the mid-to-late '60s, when 
President Johnson's Kerner Commission warned that the media "have not 
communicated to whites a feeling for the difficulties and frustrations of being 
a Negro in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
If Drummond's excellent analysis has a weakness, it's in his inability to 
reconcile two conflicting matters. On the one hand, he cites the growing demand 
that the white-dominated media stop focusing so intently on the misleading 
stereotypes of "black pathology": drug addiction, crime and the like. On the 
other hand, he and others complain about the unwillingness of the media to shed 
light on the problems faced by black America. Hence the frustrating 
observation: "There is black pathology, but it is given more attention than 
white pathology, and it is less understood." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem may simply be, as he writes, that "some of the black anger 
at the media must be anger at the news itself. The news for black America is 
not good." 
</P>
<P>
The underlying criticism in his piece, never explicitly stated, seems to be 
that the media do a lousy job of covering almost any historically and 
culturally complex issue or community, regardless of race, creed or color. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
REQUIRED READING 
</P>
<P>
* Japan may be the world's leading joho shakai ("information society"), and its 
johoshi ("information magazines") are one way the Japanese get their 
minute-by-minute information fix. The August Egg examines Trendy, Box, Quark, 
Pumpkin, Lettuce Club, McSister, and others that fill Japanese newsstands, 
offering "an extended, open-ended set of instructions for life." More than a 
look at magazines, this is an excellent study of where Japanese and American 
culture coincides and collides. 
</P>
<P>
* First there was the "Mommy Track." Then the "Daddy Track." Now, the July 16 
Newsweek tells us there's the "Daughter Track." Readers who can overcome their 
natural aversion to overly catchy news weekly trend labels will find an 
important examination of women's demanding role as double caretakers, first of 
their kids and then of their ill and aging parents. 
</P>
<P>
* Next year, construction begins on the Westside for a bicycle freeway. If the 
folks at Bicycle Magazine had their way, the city would turn that two-mile 
stretch over to automobiles and reserve the rest of L.A.'s hundreds of miles of 
freeway for bicycles. The August issue offers dozens of suggestions on how to 
make bicycle commuting more appealing until that freeway shift happens. The 
piece is aptly titled: "How the Bike Can Save L.A." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEW ON NEWSSTANDS 
</P>
<P>
* In the old days, Rolling Stone was the cream of the rock rag crop and Creem 
was a sort of low-fat imitator. Now Creem is back as a large format bimonthly, 
looking a lot hipper than today's Stone -- which means it devotes itself to the 
surviving stars of the late '70s and early '80s rather than those of the '60s 
and Hollywood celebrities. (Judging from the first issue, it completely skips 
the socially redeeming stuff Stone still does so well.) 
</P>
<P>
With big pictures and -- for the most part -- mere snatches of prose, the 
magazine seems to be catering to the shortened attention-span syndrome. But 
enough of the pictures are striking and enough of the prose is fun that it 
works. (Creem, $12, P.O. Box 3795, Jacksonville, FL 32206).

ERMA BOMBECK: IF OUR KIDS WERE IN CHARGE, WE'D BE UP A TREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years, it's been a standard greeting: "Hi, Honey, I'm home." Only nowadays, 
a kid answers. 
</P>
<P>
According to national real-estate marketing research, children of the 
two-income, two-career family have inherited the role of prime occupants of the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't pick out the house or design it. They don't even pay for it, but 
most of them spend more time in it than their parents. The obvious question is: 
Why don't children have more input into where they live than they do? The 
obvious answer is: Have you seen the way kids live when there are no adults 
around? 
</P>
<P>
First, their choice of a house would be one humongous room built in a tree with 
a rope ladder. Anyone wanting to enter would have to have the secret code word. 
The entire house would have only two appliances: a television covering one 
wall, and a microwave covering the other wall (replacing Phyllis Diller's 
fantasy: an oven that flushes). Basketball hoops would be positioned over 
wastebaskets, clothes hampers, the kitchen sink, towel racks and clothes hooks. 
There would be no beds -- only pillows on the floor in front of the Nintendo 
library. 
</P>
<P>
The bathroom would be self-cleaning, with a water heater the size of an active 
crater. Every child would have a plug implant so that wherever he is in the 
house, he could plug in a stereo, a radio or a hair dryer. 
</P>
<P>
They would live in a disposable world. Disposable underwear, disposable towels, 
disposable clothes, disposable dishes and containers. The center of the floor 
would have a campfire so their friends could sit around and play with matches 
and toast marshmallows. 
</P>
<P>
Off on one small tree branch would be a separate room the size of a broom 
closet. This would be for Mom and Dad. When they didn't pay attention or messed 
up, they would be made to go there without television, dinner or human sounds. 
The tree house would have a small patch of grass at the bottom of the tree, 
which the parents would be required to cut with scissors every two days. 
</P>
<P>
Parents wouldn't spend a lot of time in their room, as they would have chores 
and be sent on errands to pick up videocassettes every night. Yet, they would 
have to clean it every 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Pure fantasy, you say with a laugh. Don't be too sure. I have just described my 
son's apartment.

YOUR WHEELS: MULTIWEIGHT OILS: MORE PROTECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: You recently recommended multiweight oils as being superior to 
straight weight oils. I believe in a mild climate, a multiweight oil is 
inferior because it does not have the stable viscosity characteristics of a 
single-weight oil. -- P.C.R. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Why not carry the argument one step further and run your engine on 
unrefined crude? The simple answer is that without additives, an engine would 
be a wreck in only 1,000 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Many purists disdain multiweight oils for their cars, believing in the 
simplicity of a single-weight oil. For the layman, a multiweight oil has 
additives that prevent it from thinning out as the engine heats up. 
</P>
<P>
Multiweight oils are given a numerical rating by the Society of Automotive 
Engineers or SAE. An SAE 10W-30 oil, for example, exhibits the characteristics 
of a light 10-weight winter oil when the engine is cold and a heavy 30-weight 
oil when the engine is hot. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called viscosity improvers that refiners add to oil to achieve this 
performance once degraded over time, so that the oil eventually failed to 
perform as a multiweight. More recent improvements have made them sheer stable, 
meaning the improvers are not "sheered" apart by the rotating machinery of the 
engine. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, the petroleum base of a motor oil will typically break down long 
before the additives. Most oil experts believe that a multiweight oil provides 
a large measure of protection to an engine beyond that of a single-weight oil. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I recently replaced the timing chain and gear on my 1984 Ford Crown 
Victoria. Twice, I had the timing set by a Ford dealer and twice it jumped out 
of correct time. The Ford garage said it can't find anything wrong. Would you 
please tell me what is causing this problem? -- L.B. 
</P>
<P>
A: If the valve timing has jumped twice, then the chain and gear were not 
properly installed. The timing chain transmits the motion needed to open and 
close the cylinder valves. The chain runs between two gears, one mounted on the 
crankshaft and one mounted on the camshaft. 
</P>
<P>
The two gears, which are roughly five inches in diameter and two inches in 
diameter, are only about two inches apart. So, the chain is relatively short 
for the size gears that it drives. If the chain is actually slipping, it must 
have far too much free play. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a slip in the valve timing could cause very serious damage to the 
engine. It could bend a valve or damage a piston, requiring a major engine 
tear-down and rebuild. Perhaps the mechanics who worked on your engine are 
inadequately trained or poorly motivated.

TRAINING PROGRAMS OFFER DEALS THAT TAKE THE CAKE

Customers entering the West Valley Occupational Center bakery are immediately 
enveloped in the aroma of freshly baked cinnamon rolls, cookies, cakes and 
breads. And the prices are just as enticing. 
</P>
<P>
French bread, 85 cents; giant cinnamon rolls, 80 cents; a large coffee cake, 
$2.25; a frosted and decorated sheet cake measuring 24 by 16 inches, $37.50. 
It's like a walk back in time. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, this bakery in Woodland Hills is a classroom, and the products in 
the sales cases are the result of student efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Bakery instructor Bruno Heck, 56, complete with white hat and apron, is in the 
back room teaching his students how to knead bread, how to sprinkle just the 
right amount of cinnamon on rolls and how to keep a four-tier wedding cake from 
toppling over. 
</P>
<P>
The bakery is one of half a dozen courses at the San Fernando Valley's two 
occupational centers, where consumers can buy bread or potted plants, get 
haircuts or have their cars repaired -- at considerable savings contrasted with 
similar commercial outlets. But there are limitations. The West Valley center 
and its counterpart, North Valley Occupational Center in Mission Hills, set the 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have friction from retail operations because we make it clear that 
these are training programs," said James Wall, West Valley principal. "We don't 
advertise, and we won't compete with the outside." 
</P>
<P>
Rather, he says, all the centers -- there are five in the Los Angeles Unified 
School District -- work closely with industry advisory committees to make sure 
students are learning current techniques. 
</P>
<P>
"The public is our student body," Wall said. "In the automotive department 
alone, for us to stay current we would need many cars on hand. We couldn't even 
begin to approach that kind of financing, so repairing privately owned 
automobiles with parts customers pay for not only reduces our operating costs 
but allows the public to get something done less expensively." 
</P>
<P>
Only a handful of the center's 65 or so courses provide services to the public, 
however. Administrators say that if the centers can train students without 
having to enlist the public, they do so. "We've been approached by people 
wanting to know if our carpentry class can build a room for them," said Wesley 
M. Balbuena, 67, principal at North Valley Occupational Center. "Sure we can do 
it; but no, we won't. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want anyone to profit from these services. The purpose of this school 
is training. It's to benefit the students in giving them hands-on experience." 
</P>
<P>
The classes that offer services to the community are varied. 
</P>
<P>
Cosmetology: West Valley and North Valley offer extensive cosmetology classes 
in which the public can get haircuts, perms, tints, coloring, manicures, 
pedicures and even an occasional punk hairdo. West Valley's facility is on 
campus, and North Valley does its training at the Modern Beauty Academy on Van 
Nuys Boulevard in Panorama City. 
</P>
<P>
There are no appointments; it's strictly first-come, first-served. But clients 
such as Ellen White, 85, of Reseda, have been coming to West Valley every week 
for the past year to get a shampoo, set, manicure and pedicure. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather come here than anywhere else," White said. "They're personable; 
they do nice work and nobody hurries you. Besides," she said with a wink, "when 
I come out of here, I look 55." 
</P>
<P>
The busiest days, West Valley instructors say, are Tuesdays and Wednesdays when 
the regular prices -- $3.50 for a haircut and shampoo, $12.40 for a salon perm 
and $2.50 for a manicure -- are halved for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives us a chance to work with real customers," said West Valley student 
Tanja Schimmang, 20, of Chatsworth. "You're apprehensive at first, but after a 
while you get self-confidence in working with the public." No children under 10 
are allowed. 
</P>
<P>
North Valley offers day classes Tuesday through Saturday from 8 a.m. to 2:30 
p.m. West Valley offers classes Monday through Friday from 9:15 a.m. to 1:30 
p.m. and from 4:30 to 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Bakery: At West Valley only. "We bake exactly like a retail bakery," said Heck, 
"and do everything from cookies to cakes, Danish pastry, puff rolls, some hotel 
baking, all the miniature pastries, bread, as well as various European 
pastries." 
</P>
<P>
Prices are about half those of retail bakeries, he says, emphasizing that the 
center bakery does not promote the business and won't cater to organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not here to hustle business away from commercial bakeries," he said. "If 
you come in and say you want 200 of a certain type of pastry, I might say no 
because it doesn't fit into the program this week." But when his students have 
the time, the bakery will accept cake orders. 
</P>
<P>
For a three-layer wedding cake, running about $65, Heck recommends calling well 
in advance. Before his students can start working, the customer will have to go 
to the bakery and pay for everything in cash -- nothing is finalized on the 
telephone. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to have an outlet for what we do," he said, "and this makes the bakery 
self-sustaining. If we're doing it, the public is welcome to take advantage of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Landscaping: Both schools offer tree and plant sales through their landscaping 
occupations courses, monthly at West Valley and once a semester at North 
Valley. Call the schools for exact dates and times. 
</P>
<P>
TV and VCR Repair: Both schools offer these classes, but only West Valley will 
accept a limited number of outside VCRs and color televisions for students to 
work on, depending on where the instructor is in the course. 
</P>
<P>
Child-Care Training: The North Valley Occupational Center has a child-care 
training program that includes a day-care center for children ages 2 to 5, with 
half the enrollment reserved for children who live in the community. 
</P>
<P>
Maximum daily payment for the 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. day is $21.60, which includes 
breakfast, lunch and a snack. Children's Center site coordinator Marianne 
Agbayani, 41, said, "This is a complete training program, not baby-sitting. 
There will be certified teachers watching at all times." 
</P>
<P>
Auto Repair: Available at both centers. An appointment is required, and if a 
car is accepted, payment for parts and materials, plus a $5 shop charge must 
precede any work. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything we do here is for the learning process only," said West Valley 
automotive instructor Jim Kohnen, 63. 
</P>
<P>
He says his students can do all types of repairs, from car computers and 
carburetors to electric windows and power seats. With customers paying only for 
parts, he estimates that an $800 valve job, for instance, can be done by 
students for $60. The schools are even equipped with state-of-the-art emissions 
testing equipment, and although a smog certificate will not be issued, students 
can tell if a car will pass the test. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, Kohnen said, he will do an engine overhaul, but only "if a 
customer will give me about a month with the car." 
</P>
<P>
He said, "It has to be a learning process. No junk, please, I have enough 
problems." North Valley will not accept engine overhauls. 
</P>
<P>
Auto Body Shop: Available at both centers. 
</P>
<P>
"We offer body work and painting to the general public," said West Valley 
instructor Michael McLouth, 38, "but they must go to an outside body shop first 
to get an estimate. Then we evaluate the car and see if it's a good project." 
</P>
<P>
If it's not, McLouth said he will pass, explaining that he will only accept 
cars his students can learn from. If he approves the work, the customer must 
pay for all parts up front. "We don't want anyone to be surprised," he said, 
adding that the main reason for getting an outside estimate is to make the 
customer aware of the price of parts. 
</P>
<P>
"If a grill is going to cost $100 outside, it costs $100 here." 
</P>
<P>
Usually the cars approved for work must be no older than a 1980 model. McLouth 
said that if the car is an old clunker or a rare classic, he'll probably say 
no. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have a newer vehicle, it gives our students the experience they'll need 
in the field. We don't restore 1964 Falcons." Neither are cars with heavy frame 
damage accepted. Expect repairs to average two or three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Brakes and Front-End Alignments: Brake jobs and front-end work, said West 
Valley instructor Kevin Valentino, 31, can take as little as a day and half, 
including seal replacement and complete brake and front-end certification. It 
is also the one area of occupational center auto repair that will accept an old 
car. 
</P>
<P>
"The brakes on a 1958 Nash are, in theory, exactly the same as a 1965 Chevy," 
he said. "As long as parts are commercially available and it's a car you'll see 
on the streets, no problem." 
</P>
<P>
There is also a motorcycle repair course at West Valley that will accept a 
limited number of bikes. 
</P>

FOR THOSE WHO FEAR FRIDAY; 
</P>
<P>
SUPERSTITION: FRIDAY THE 13TH IS TOMORROW, BUT FEAR NOT. A NORTHRIDGE CLASS 
TEACHES THAT 13'S BAD REPUTATION IS UNFOUNDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Thirteen is one of the scariest numbers, but when it lands on a Friday it is 
considered the unluckiest of days and is enough to keep people home. But a 
Northridge numerologist is trying to ease fears about the odd number by 
teaching a class just after this month's Friday the 13th. 
</P>
<P>
"The number 13 is my favorite number," said Freda Amsel, wearing a necklace 
with the number 13. "It always turns up in my life and has always meant good 
things for me." 
</P>
<P>
She was born on the 13th, and often flies on that date, requesting row 13 on 
the plane. The names of her three sons -- whom she had well before she 
discovered numerology -- all add up to 13 when translated into numerological 
terms. The addresses of homes significant in her life -- her house of birth, 
first homes in New York and California, the home of her divorce and her present 
home -- all add up to 13. And this year is significant because Amsel turns 58 
(5 + 8 = 13). 
</P>
<P>
"Even if the 13 denotes a negative connotation I hope people will see its 
positive side," Amsel said. 
</P>
<P>
But the superstitious may be delighted to know that this month's Friday the 
13th is the last one until September, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Northridge professor Eloise Klein Healy, an expert and author about 
mythology and legends, said the fear of 13 has always been associated with the 
unknown. 
</P>
<P>
"Historically, it has been considered an extremely dangerous number," said 
Healy, an English professor. "There are 13 witches in a coven, so it is 
associated with witches. It is affiliated with an outside religion and the 
magic of numbers. In history, people were afraid of the number 13 because they 
feared anything magical -- like black magic. Look was happened to witches." 
</P>
<P>
Numerology is the study of positive and negative vibrations of numbers, made up 
by names and birth dates; a person choses to follow the vibrations for good or 
evil, Amsel said. 
</P>
<P>
Amsel teaches her class at the Cosmic Connection Metaphysical Bookstore and 
Academy in Northridge, where owner Charlene Whitaker has read Tarot cards and 
astrology charts for nine years. 
</P>
<P>
"The number 13 got a bad reputation because of this," Whitaker said, flipping 
out the "Death Card" from her Tarot deck -- cards used as an ancient form of 
fortune telling. The number 13 is on the card with a grotesque skeleton and a 
rising sun in the background. "This was never meant to be death as we know it, 
but transformation. It's about destroying the old and making room for the new." 
That, coupled with the death of Jesus Christ on a Friday made the combination 
ominous. He was the 13th one at the dinner table, Amsel pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
"If we wake up thinking it is Friday the 13th and bad things are going to 
happen, then we look for bad things to happen," Whitaker said. "Thought creates 
form." 
</P>
<P>
But 13 was very lucky for 13 bank employees in Clearwater, Fla., who bet $13 in 
the lottery on the Friday the 13th in April and won $9.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Other significant 13s: 
</P>
<P>
* The "baker's dozen" in Europe means if you order a dozen, you get 13. 
Historically, it relates to 12 months of growing and harvesting crops and the 
13th is a new beginning of sharing. 
</P>
<P>
* The New York Stock Exchange and many hotels and office buildings have no 13th 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
* At 13, Jewish children become adults in bar mitzvahs or bas mitzvahs, another 
transformation, Amsel said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many misconceptions about 13 and the fears are passed on from 
generation to generation," Whitaker said. "People consider it fatalistic, until 
they learn more about it." 
</P>
<P>
The New Age philosophy of the late 1980s has peaked and people put the 
metaphysical stuff they learned to everyday practice, said Whitaker, who has 
classes at her bookstore in tea-leaf readings, crystals, self-healing, 
spiritual development and meditation. Her brightly lighted, incense-scented 
store doesn't carry materials about voodoo, black magic, satanism or 
witchcraft. 
</P>
<P>
"A good psychic reminds you of who you are and what your values and priorities 
should be, thereby releasing you of fear and worry," Amsel said. "Freed from 
your anxieties, you will be open-minded to directing your own course of 
action." 
</P>
<P>
Her classes are a bit of a history lesson. "In my class everyone is curious 
about the number 13 and even the most skeptical is fascinated by the 
information on the dollar bill," Amsel said. 
</P>
<P>
She pulls out a dollar bill and points to the 13 rows of bricks on the pyramid, 
a symbol from the secret group of Freemasons that included George Washington, 
Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, as cited in "The Seal of the United 
States" by Paul Foster Case. The phrases "Annuit Coeptis" (He favors our 
undertaking) and "E pluribus unum" (From many, one) have 13 letters, the eagle 
carries 13 arrows in his left talon and the peace branch has 13 leaves and 13 
olives, according to Case's book. Although the country had 13 colonies to begin 
with, Amsel said the symbols are for a more spiritual purpose. 
</P>
<P>
(Amsel's next class on "The Mystery of Numbers" is scheduled at 7 p.m. July 25 
at the Cosmic Connection, 9250 Reseda Blvd. Admission is $10.) 
</P>
<P>
"The number is all or nothing at all," Amsel said. "You can make it have 
enormous potential for attainment or complete destruction, but it is up to 
you." 
</P>
<P>
"Friday the 13th should be thought of like any other day," Whitaker added.

Purple One plans to open a shop in the Minneapolis warehouse district in 
September, and a line of official Prince merchandise -- T-shirts, sweat shirts, 
jewelry, buttons, calendars and posters -- also will be sold through other 
retail outlets. The apparel will be designed by his wardrobe department. GREG

'Bernadette' Not Blessed in London: "Bernadette," which broke with London 
traditions by being written and produced by people unknown in the theater 
world, will close Saturday, less than a month after it opened. 
</P>
<P>
The musical, about a French girl who saw a vision of the Virgin Mary at 
Lourdes, won a blessing from Pope John Paul II, and producer William Fonfe 
mortgaged his home to help fund the $2.25-million production. But dwindling 
audiences and scathing reviews forced him to to bring down the final curtain. 
Fonfe still hopes to negotiate a possible tour in Italy. GREG BRAXTON

An Egyptian Record: A small 3,500-year-old pottery hippopotamus has sold for 
$955,600, a record auction price for an Egyptian antiquity. 
</P>
<P>
London dealer Robin Symes bought the artifact on Tuesday at Sotheby's of 
London. The 4.25-inch-long hippo is glazed in turquoise and has lotus blossoms 
and a grasshopper painted on its back. The previous top price for an Egyptian 
antiquity was $742,500 for a granite figure of the goddess Sekhmet auctioned in 
1986. GREG BRAXTON

'Dick Tracy' Not a Video Star Yet: Disputing a report that "Dick Tracy" may 
appear in video stores as early as November, the Walt Disney Co. said Wednesday 
that the film's video debut has not been set. 
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal, citing industry sources, said in its Wednesday edition 
that "Dick Tracy" could arrive in video stores for the Christmas season. But 
officials for Disney's home video arm said that while the company has discussed 
"Dick Tracy's" video release with retailers, no firm decision has been made. 
Disney also has not decided the suggested retail price for the video. GREG

POP BEAT: CELLO SETS TONE OF RICHARD BARONE SHOW; 
</P>
<P>
HIS ROCK BAND EXPERIMENTED WITH SONIC SYNTHESIS IN A HIGHLY MELODIC, DYNAMIC 
PERFORMANCE AT THE COACH HOUSE.

<P>
You don't typically see "cellist wanted" listings in the classified sections of 
rock magazines, but perhaps Richard Barone and his band can start a new trend. 
</P>
<P>
With Jane Scarpantoni wielding the bow, Barone's show Tuesday night at the 
Coach House benefited from shadings and textures seldom encountered on a rock 
concert stage. 
</P>
<P>
This was not the sort of rock-meets-the-classics gimmick listeners learned to 
expect from the Electric Light Orchestra, which massed cellos and violins for 
the sake of pomp and flash. Scarpantoni, seated just to the side of bandleader 
Barone, didn't come to the ball to dress it up in a little high culture. She 
came as a fully engaged rock musician, ready to serve as an integral part of a 
band. Scarpantoni hardly ever stopped playing, and her playing never stopped 
making sense. 
</P>
<P>
She was central to the band from the show's very first driving riff, in which 
the cello doubled the electric bass. Scarpantoni was often "it" in games of 
interactive tag in which the cello would spin and twine in response to Barone's 
twisting electric lead guitar parts. But she was no less a presence when 
jumping into the rhythm section in a supporting role that lent both power and 
nuance. When the situation called for a delicate change of pace, Scarpantoni 
was ready with the sort of thing one expects from a cello: a broad, classic 
tone full of warmth and grace. 
</P>
<P>
With bass, drums and acoustic guitar laying down basic rhythms, Barone, 
Scarpantoni and percussionist Valerie Naranjo dabbed in the sonic colors in an 
exceptionally melodic 70-minute show that included 11 of the 12 songs from 
Barone's new album, "Primal Dream," plus quiet covers from the Beatles ("Cry 
Baby Cry") and the Velvet Underground ("I'll Be Your Mirror"). 
</P>
<P>
Barone's voice was consistently appealing with its reedy quality offset by a 
husky grain, although he occasionally strained for a note. His guitar work, 
emphasizing distortion effects that didn't part with melody, was the main 
driving force in the six-piece ensemble, which kicked in tightly after a few 
rough spots early on. 
</P>
<P>
Stormy music predominated, but Barone inserted several interludes in which 
drums and bass sat out, leaving a chamber-pop quartet. One song, "Flew a 
Falcon," had it both ways. Naranjo, a vibrant performer given to dramatic 
flourishes, would bang out crashing kettle drum rolls with her mallets, then 
stop and let the cello answer in a quieter, more understated way that built 
tension until the next dynamic drum surge. 
</P>
<P>
Barone did play a spirited rocker, "Barbarella," for sheer dumb fun (it was a 
number from his old band, the Bongos). But most of the show took on an attitude 
of earnest searching and striving -- a sense of wavering warmth amid darkness 
that had its emotional echo in the tonality of the cello itself. 
</P>
<P>
The performance got the response it deserved from a small but fully 
appreciative audience that was delighted to hear a pop-rock band deliver more 
than the usual thing. 
</P>
<P>
THE BEAT GOES ON: The Vandals have a new drummer, Josh Freeze, who at 17 is a 
veteran of touring with Stacey Q and Michael Damian. The Orange County 
teen-ager also recently played on sessions for Dweezil Zappa's next album. As a 
result, Dweezil and his sister, Moon Zappa, plan to appear on the Vandals' next 
album. Bob Casale of Devo is producing the record, which is tentatively 
entitled "Fear of a Punk Planet."

A BLOODLESS 'GHOSTS'; CUT-RATE 'CHORUS LINE'

<P>
Are there a few new spirits flying out of Henrik Ibsen's "Ghosts"? 
</P>
<P>
This 1881 drama has, at least on paper, acquired fresh relevance. Or so wrote 
Jack Shouse, head of Pacific Conservatory of the Performing Arts Theaterfest, 
in program notes about the new season, which shuttles shows between an indoor 
theater at Santa Maria and an outdoor stage in Solvang. 
</P>
<P>
"Ghosts" is about a man whose terrible venereal disease is apparently a product 
of his now-dead father's philandering -- and his mother's reluctance to defy 
convention by leaving the rake before conceiving a child with him. In the 
program, Shouse connected the play to such current issues as "the social stigma 
faced by those suffering from a deadly disease." 
</P>
<P>
He also noted that "Ghosts" was "once banned because it presented situations 
and ideas which were considered scandalous . . . In an era when censorship in 
the arts is hotly debated," the example of Ibsen's play supports "freedom of 
artistic expression . . . regardless of our feeling about one artist's specific 
subject or approach." 
</P>
<P>
In other, more explicit words, Shouse is suggesting that thoughts of AIDS and 
the National Endowment for the Arts and even 2 Live Crew might flit through the 
minds of audiences watching "Ghosts." 
</P>
<P>
This effort to create a little controversy out of "Ghosts" is encouraging, in a 
PCPA season that otherwise sticks to the tried and true: "A Chorus Line," 
"Little Shop of Horrors," "The Importance of Being Earnest," "Guys and Dolls" 
and yet another "Much Ado About Nothing." 
</P>
<P>
But the controversy doesn't go very far in Roger DeLaurier's staging. Perhaps 
it's just as well, regarding the tenuous parallel to AIDS. The fact is that any 
"social stigma" suffered by the syphilitic son Oswald is a very minor concern 
in "Ghosts." His real problem is that he's going insane. 
</P>
<P>
It's too bad, though, that this revival couldn't generate enough heat to evoke 
the current censorship battle, without the prompting of Shouse's program notes. 
Watching this generally bloodless production, it's difficult to imagine Ibsen 
as the Karen Finley of his day. 
</P>
<P>
The language in the new translation by Jerry Turner is no more raw than that of 
previous translations; the text still doesn't even mention the name of Oswald's 
disease (Shouse followed suit in his program notes by not specifying AIDS as 
today's "deadly disease"). 
</P>
<P>
There is no sexual chemistry between Frederic Barbour's Oswald and Lisa 
Paulsen's Regina, the maid whom Oswald later discovers is his half-sister. Nor 
is it easy to understand how Dee Maaske's Mrs. Alving could have been attracted 
to a younger version of Philip Stockton's wan, nattering Pastor Manders. 
</P>
<P>
We do sense the blood flowing beneath the skin of Maaske's Mrs. Alving. She 
speaks in dark, tart cadences that ring with authority, and her eyes reveal 
even more. In fact, she's so strong that it's hard to believe that Mrs. Alving 
was a self-destructive doormat during her marriage. But this is Ibsen's problem 
more than Maaske's. 
</P>
<P>
Paulsen is a vibrant Regina, and Carl Palmer has amusing moments as Regina's 
purported father -- though his wild-man wig and beard make him look too 
eccentric to be such a successful con man. But Barbour's Oswald is nothing more 
than a wounded kid. 
</P>
<P>
D Martyn Bookwalter's set, Jerald R. Enos' lights and David C. Eakin's score 
add a touch of tragic grandeur to the more predictable gloom and doom. 
</P>
<P>
The scenic and lighting design and orchestral prowess of the Theaterfest's "A 
Chorus Line," which opened in Solvang while "Ghosts" opened in Santa Maria, 
were not nearly so accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
The mirrors, which almost serve as a separate character in "A Chorus Line," 
looked cheap and pasted-on -- and they didn't move from the rear of the stage 
during Cassie's "Music and the Mirror" number, when they're supposed to give us 
five views of her at once. The number seemed long-winded, despite the 
professional efforts of Colette Bernal as Cassie. Nor could we see the 
footlights or the audience in these mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra needs to work on intonation, particularly during the staccato 
chords that punctuate the scene in which the dancers thrust their glossies at 
the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the actors are pretty good. Despite a few weak singers, the show 
still casts a spell. Veteran "Chorus Line" watchers may wonder why the 
character of Connie is no longer Chinese-American, but it's a nice touch to see 
the cast singing "point me toward tomorrow" in a formation that uses the 
Theaterfest's thrust stages to point out at the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 The shows run in rotating repertory; information: (800) 221-9469.

STAGE WATCH: LACLO'S TWO NEW PRODUCERS PROMISE HOME-GROWN MUSICALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Civic Light Opera may be about to take the first two words of its 
name seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Wiviott and Keith Stava, the recently resigned producers of the Long 
Beach Civic Light Opera, will become the producers of Los Angeles Civic Light 
Opera next month -- and they pledge to begin producing musicals in Los Angeles, 
for Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Most of LACLO's shows in recent years have been imported. Since the Nederlander 
Companies took over the management of LACLO in 1981 (through their nonprofit 
American Corp. of the Arts), the organization hasn't been much more than a stop 
for pre- or post-Broadway tours. 
</P>
<P>
In the last year, however, a couple of LACLO offerings were derived from 
productions that originated a lot closer than New York -- at Wiviott's and 
Stava's company in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"The Unsinkable Molly Brown," with Debbie Reynolds, was a Long Beach Civic 
Light Opera co-production (with a Houston company and with Reynolds' own 
company) that played in Long Beach in May, 1989, then arrived at the Pantages 
for the LACLO audience in September (the tour was solely under the banner of 
Reynolds' company). And while the Cathy Rigby "Peter Pan" which played the 
Pantages for LACLO audiences last month was a different production from the one 
which played Long Beach in 1986, they both used Rigby and Stava, who was 
associate producer in Long Beach and co-producer of the "Peter Pan" tour. 
</P>
<P>
The Nederlanders are not relinquishing the LACLO; they are employing Wiviott 
and Stava. In the past, the Nederlanders' West Coast staff's other 
responsibilities -- the Greek Theatre, the Pacific Amphitheatre, and the 
management of the Pantages, Wilshire and Fonda theaters used by the LACLO -- 
prevented them from devoting their full time to LACLO. Wiviott and Stava's sole 
responsibility will be to produce the LACLO, operating out of the Nederlanders' 
Hollywood offices. 
</P>
<P>
The New York-based James Nederlander, chairman of the company, will continue to 
make the final decisions, said Stan Seiden, Nederlander West Coast president. 
"But to hire two men like this and then try to hold them down," he added, 
"would be ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
"Our main goal is to bring visibility and continuity to the organization," said 
Wiviott. "It has been submerged within the Nederlander company." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, he added, "the pattern (of LACLO productions) hasn't been 
consistent because they had to depend on the tours. They didn't have the staff 
to mount a major musical here in L.A. Now we have that option. We won't have to 
worry about tours canceling (before playing Los Angeles)." 
</P>
<P>
But won't local productions require more money from the Nederlanders? 
</P>
<P>
"We're willing to back it in seed money to whatever extent it needs," said the 
company's Seiden. "We want to bring the CLO back to the glory it once enjoyed." 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping the local productions will be less expensive," said Wiviott. The 
new producers have begun discussions with officials of Actors' Equity in an 
attempt to arrive at lower pay scales for LACLO's locally produced shows, in 
contrast with the tours. 
</P>
<P>
George Ives, the incoming Western regional director of Equity, said no proposal 
is on the table but confirmed that Wiviott and Stava intend to ask to work 
under a League of Resident Theatres contract -- the model used by such 
nonprofit institutions as the Mark Taper Forum -- rather than the standard 
contract used by most commercial productions. "It's a question of whether they 
qualify, and they probably will," said Ives. 
</P>
<P>
Besides cutting costs, Wiviott and Stava intend to raise more money from 
sources other than the Nederlanders and the box office. "We can devote a lot of 
attention to unearned income, such as grants and corporate underwriting," said 
Wiviott. He and Stava hope to begin children's programming and minority 
outreach programs that might help attract such income. 
</P>
<P>
Before all that begins, though, "obviously we'll have to deal with the 
subscribers first." Wiviott promised to take the time to deal with subscriber 
complaints and to survey subscribers about shows and stars they would like to 
see -- a tactic he employed in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"My likes have to come second to what the audience wants to see," he said. His 
theory is that a happier, larger subscriber base will eventually provide the 
financial stability that can "make more daring productions feasible." 
</P>
<P>
Wiviott said he doesn't know how many subscribers LACLO now has, but "I think 
it's around 30,000" -- which would be comparable to the Long Beach numbers. "I 
would be happy in a year or two to have 50,000," he said. "They once had the 
largest subscription in the country -- there's no reason it can't be up there 
again." 
</P>
<P>
The number of offerings will increase from three to four per season, according 
to Wiviott. Not all will be locally produced -- LACLO will still try to book 
the sporadic hit touring companies. Asked if any bookings will be non-musicals, 
which LACLO resorted to last season ("Steel Magnolias" and "Driving Miss 
Daisy"), Wiviott replied, "Our discussions have been only about musicals. A 
civic light opera is what the title says it is." 
</P>
<P>
Wiviott and Stava will share the same title, unlike their positions in Long 
Beach, where Wiviott was in charge. "We work well together," said Wiviott. "We 
don't say 'This is yours; this is mine.' Keith is more technical-minded than I 
am. Of course we sometimes disagree, but then a discussion follows -- and then 
we agree." 
</P>
<P>
It's too late for Wiviott and Stava to have much say about the coming season, 
said Wiviott. An announcement of what's planned for that season is expected 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
TAPER WATCH: Artistic director Gordon Davidson has finally announced the Mark 
Taper Forum's coming season, and it confirms the season projected in a June 14 
Stage Watch column. 
</P>
<P>
To recap: 
</P>
<P>
* "Hope of the Heart" (Sept. 27-Nov. 11). 
</P>
<P>
* "The Lisbon Traviata" (Nov. 29-Dec. 30). Richard Thomas and Nathan Lane will 
star. 
</P>
<P>
* "The Wash" (Jan. 17-Feb. 16). Unconfirmed speculation is that Sab Shimono and 
Nobu McCarthy will star. 
</P>
<P>
* "Mr. Jellylord" (March 7-April 21). 
</P>
<P>
* "Julius Caesar" (May 9-June 23). The Taper's resident director Oskar Eustis 
will re-create the concept that he used at Trinity Repertory Company in 
Providence, R.I., in February: visual imagery that suggests Rome of 44 B.C. and 
Washington of the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
* "Widows" (July 25-Sept. 28). Tony Kushner, author of "Millennium Approaches," 
recently seen at Taper Too, and adapter of Los Angeles Theatre Center's "The 
Illusion," has collaborated with Ariel Dorfman on the dramatization of 
Dorfman's novel.

GOOD COOKING; 
</P>
<P>
THE SECRET TO EASY VEGETABLES: IT'S ALL IN THE SKILLET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABBY MANDEL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Some people think that cooking fresh vegetables requires culinary experience 
and time-involved preparation. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
</P>
<P>
Now is the best time to discover the real truth about vegetables. The stores 
are brimming with summer's bounty, and truly fresh vegetables need little 
embellishment to bring out their great flavor. 
</P>
<P>
The microwave is not the ideal tool in which to quickly cook vegetables; a 
skillet, which can be just as fast, has other advantages. The wide base of a 
12-inch non-stick skillet allows you to cook a large quantity of vegetables 
quickly over fairly high heat using little oil or butter. And skillet-cooking 
enhances and deepens every nuance of flavor. It also gives you instant control 
of the heat so the vegetables are not overcooked. This is not to mention the 
sensual satisfaction of being involved with the bright and lively vegetables as 
they cook under your watchful eye. 
</P>
<P>
As with all fresh foods, it's important to resist any impulse to overload on 
vegetables. Buy vegetables with the intention of cooking them as quickly as 
possible. Many cooks buy fresh vegetables on the weekends, prepare them at once 
and reheat them during the week; this is a task that the microwave performs 
with undeniable success. 
</P>
<P>
To refrigerate fresh vegetables for a few days, keep them unwrapped in the 
produce drawer -- or stored in paper bags (rather than plastic). Two big 
exceptions are greens and herbs, which do far better in plastic. 
</P>
<P>
Here are three skillet vegetable recipes; each is flavorful, serves at least 
four people -- and cooks in less than 10 minutes. All can be served either hot 
or at room temperature. And each is so versatile that the slicing, shredding 
and dicing can be done ahead so that all that is left until the last minute is 
the cooking. Other vegetables can be cooked in similar fashion; just be sure to 
experiment with the best-quality vegetables you can find. 
</P>
<P>
 When corn is fresh, sweet and tender, it tastes great raw. In fact, that's the 
ultimate test. For those who want their corn cooked, here's a Southwestern 
recipe for corn cut off the cob and combined with jalapeno pepper, green onions 
and jicama in an unusually quick saute. The barely cooked jicama adds a sweet 
crunch. If you have left-over cooked corn, it can be substituted for the raw 
corn. 
</P>
<P>
 ALBUQUERQUE CORN 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons safflower oil 
</P>
<P>
2 cups corn, cut from 4 large ears 
</P>
<P>
1/2 jalapeno chile, seeded and minced 
</P>
<P>
10 ounces jicama, cut into 1/3-inch dice 
</P>
<P>
8 large green onions, thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
Heat oil in 12-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. When hot, add corn 
and chile. Cook until hot, about 2 minutes, stirring often. 
</P>
<P>
Add jicama, green onions, cumin and salt. Heat thoroughly, about 2 more 
minutes, stirring occasionally. Adjust seasonings. Serve hot or at room 
temperature. Makes 4 to 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, eggplant and mushrooms are treated Mediterranean-style with the robust 
flavors of garlic, onion, Kalamata olives, basil and cheese. Good-quality 
cheese gives the distinctive edge; Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese can be 
substituted for the pecorino Romano cheese, a sheep's milk cheese with a 
sharper, saltier taste than the Parmesan. 
</P>
<P>
 MEDITERRANEAN EGGPLANT AND MUSHROOMS 
</P>
<P>
1 large eggplant, unpeeled and cut into 3/4-inch dice 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons light olive oil 
</P>
<P>
1 (3-ounce) wedge red onion, cut into 1/4-inch dice 
</P>
<P>
12 medium mushrooms, trimmed and cut in half 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 
</P>
<P>
6 Kalamata olives, pitted 
</P>
<P>
2 large cloves garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup basil leaves, finely julienned 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons ground pecorino Romano cheese 
</P>
<P>
Red pepper flakes 
</P>
<P>
Place eggplant in colander. Sprinkle with salt. Let drain 30 minutes. Rinse 
with cold water. Pat as dry as possible with paper towels. 
</P>
<P>
Heat oil in 12-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Add 
onion, mushrooms and eggplant. Cook until eggplant is barely tender and lightly 
seared, about 4 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
Add vinegar, olives and garlic. Combine well. Cook 30 seconds. Add basil, 
cheese and salt and red pepper flakes to taste. Toss gently to combine. Adjust 
seasoning. Serve hot or at room temperature. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrots are one vegetable that is taken for granted; most people forget how 
much color, good taste and nutrition they contribute to a meal. Here they are 
simmered in orange juice and water, gently sweetened with maple syrup and 
spiced with nutmeg. Simply great. Because the butter is added at the conclusion 
of the cooking, a small amount imparts a significant buttery taste, a neat 
trick for those concerned about cholesterol and fat. 
</P>
<P>
 SPICED ORANGE CARROTS 
</P>
<P>
2 cups water 
</P>
<P>
1 cup orange juice 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons maple syrup 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 pounds carrots, shredded 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
Bring 1 3/4 cups water, orange juice, maple syrup and carrots to boil in 
12-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Boil, covered, 3 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Uncover and boil, adding remaining water only as necessary, until carrots are 
tender, about 4 more minutes. There should be about 1 tablespoon liquid left in 
pan. 
</P>
<P>
Add nutmeg, salt and butter, stirring until butter is melted. Adjust seasoning. 
Serve hot or at room temperature. Makes 4 to 6 servings.

PARSLEY: THE FAIL-SAFE HERB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABBY MANDEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vegetable dishes seem even fresher and livelier when sprinkled with fresh 
herbs. Most fresh herbs are expensive and highly perishable once cut; parsley 
is the big exception -- and it is often overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
Don't take parsley for granted just because it is hardy, always in the market 
and inexpensive. It is an appealing fail-safe herb, always on my refrigerator 
shelf and consistently useful for enhancing flavors and adding visual freshness 
to many a savory dish or salad. More than that, if time is a problem you can 
mince it on the weekend; parsley will hold up extraordinarily well throughout 
the week. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how: 
</P>
<P>
* Start with parsley that's fresh and crisp. 
</P>
<P>
* Wash the parsley, letting it air-dry completely on paper towels on the 
kitchen counter (the drying is the key to it lasting several days). Use your 
hands to twist off the curly tops, saving the thick stems for soups or stocks. 
Remove any remaining thick stems from the parsley leaves (a kitchen shears does 
this quickly) because the stems will be far coarser than the leaves when 
chopped. 
</P>
<P>
* Put the air-dried parsley leaves into a dry food processor work bowl fitted 
with a metal blade. Process until minced. Contrary to other guidelines for 
effective processor mincing, a large quantity of parsley (in fact, a full work 
bowl) can be minced as perfectly as a small amount. 
</P>
<P>
* Store in a plastic food bag, kept airtight with a twist-tie. Sprinkle on 
varied savory dishes throughout the week. ABBY MANDEL

Abby's Strawberry Sherbet can be made days, even a week, ahead and then be kept 
securely in the freezer. The Italian Custard Sandwich can be made the day 
before and then needs only to be baked and browned before serving. 
</P>
<P>
In its prior life, the Italian Custard Sandwich was known as strada or cheese 
pudding. It was wildly popular during the '40s because it was easy and 
inexpensive to make, besides lending itself to many variations. This is a sort 
of spinoff from the casserole days, when I ate some surprising mixtures that 
are best forgotten. In any case, mushrooms, onions and cheese would work well 
for this dish, as would bacon crumbled with peppers and cheese. Cheese does 
seem to be a basic to the sandwich, but I'm sure even that could be changed. 
</P>
<P>
To appreciate Abby's sherbet, you will have to make it. It is outstanding. It 
can also be made with other fruits -- pears, peaches, apricots and mango. The 
key to this sherbet is to freeze pieces about the size of half a strawberry 
until rock hard. It is best to let the fruit stay overnight in the freezer. The 
other critical step is to process the mixture until it tastes creamy. 
</P>
<P>
ITALIAN CUSTARD SANDWICH 
</P>
<P>
8 slices white bread, crusts removed 
</P>
<P>
2 cups shredded Fontina cheese 
</P>
<P>
6 eggs 
</P>
<P>
l 1/2 cups milk 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon black pepper 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup butter 
</P>
<P>
Place 4 slices bread in bottom of buttered shallow (about 2 inches deep) baking 
dish. Sprinkle Fontina cheese evenly over bread. Place remaining 4 bread slices 
on top. 
</P>
<P>
Beat eggs lightly in large bowl. Stir in milk, salt and pepper until well 
blended. Pour milk mixture over sandwiches. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over top. 
Refrigerate 1/2 hour before baking or cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Bake custard sandwiches at 350 degrees 20 to 25 minutes, or until center is 
barely set. Remove from oven. 
</P>
<P>
Melt butter in large skillet over medium-low heat. Using spatula, remove each 
sandwich and place in skillet. 
</P>
<P>
Heat until lightly browned, about 2 minutes on each side. Cut in half 
diagonally. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Serve with prosciutto, olives, sliced tomatoes and Italian parsley, or 
melon slices and fresh fruit. 
</P>
<P>
ABBY'S FRESH STRAWBERRY SHERBET 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups strawberries, hulled and halved 
</P>
<P>
2 to 6 tablespoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon egg white or 2 tablespoons plain yogurt 
</P>
<P>
Spread strawberries in single layer on baking sheet. Freeze until solid or rock 
hard, preferably overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Place berries in food processor with sugar to taste. Pulse machine on and off 
until berries are minced into tiny pieces. Scrape down sides of processor with 
spatula once or twice. 
</P>
<P>
Add egg white or yogurt and process at least 2 minutes or longer, until sherbet 
is completely smooth, creamy in texture and lighter in color. Serve 
immediately, or freeze well-covered until needed. Makes 1 pint. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Although many recipes call for uncooked eggs, the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture has found them to be a potential carrier of food-borne illness and 
recommends that diners avoid eating raw eggs. Commercial egg substitutes may be 
used in place of raw eggs in certain circumstances. Check egg substitute 
package for applications.

Those who prefer meatless meals have a tough time adapting summer barbecue 
menus to their taste. Most commercial soy dogs are full of fat, and the old 
picnic standby -- avocado, cheese and sprout sandwich -- just isn't fun enough. 
Here's an option -- a menu built around burger-shaped falafel that can be 
cooked over coals or in a conventional oven. 
</P>

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: ALLERGIES ARE NOT TO BE SNEEZED AT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All of us can recall hearing someone turn down food with this catch-phrase: "No 
thanks. I'm allergic." 
</P>
<P>
But are they? Studies show that true food allergies, triggered by reactions of 
the immune system, are far rarer than generally thought. 
</P>
<P>
Babies and young children are most often affected. Prevalence for this group is 
estimated at between 0.3% and 7.5%. The incidence is believed to decline with 
age, down to less than 2% for American adults. Some adults develop an allergy 
to food after eating it for years, however. 
</P>
<P>
One problem in determining the extent of food allergies lies in defining terms. 
"Food allergy" is often used loosely. It covers not only reactions of 
intolerance to foods and food additives but also conditions that produce 
symptoms similar to food allergies but aren't food-related. 
</P>
<P>
Symptoms are varied, commonly affecting the skin, gastrointestinal tract or 
respiratory system. They range from mild itching or headache through hives or 
stomach upset to a violent asthma attack or the threat of imminent asphyxiation 
from anaphylaxis (the swelling of membranes lining the nose, mouth and 
esophagus). Symptoms may come on shortly after eating or up to three days 
later, and they can vary in intensity in the same individual depending on how 
much of the offending food is eaten, whether it's taken on an empty stomach or 
whether the person exercises right after eating. 
</P>
<P>
Diagnosis of food allergies is difficult and time-consuming. Most health 
professionals agree that food reactions fall into four categories. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Food intolerance. An unusual, generalized reaction to a food component or 
additive. Lactose intolerance is an example. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Food toxicity. Caused by a toxic component in the food, as in poisonous 
mushrooms, or by contaminating microorganisms, such as Salmonella. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Food idiosyncrasy. An individualized, strong response to a small amount of 
a food substance or additive that would have no effect on most people (such as 
caffeine, monosodium glutamate or sulfites). The response is unrelated to 
metabolic, pharmacologic or immune reactions. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Food allergy. Strictly defined as a reaction involving the body's immune 
system. The food substances (antigens) most likely to trigger an immediate 
allergic reaction are glycoproteins (a compound of protein and carbohydrate). 
Foods most commonly implicated include eggs, milk, white fish, shellfish, nuts 
and peanuts. 
</P>
<P>
In diagnosing allergies, the first step is a complete physical examination with 
a detailed history of the illness and any possible connection between symptoms 
and exposure to certain foods. Occasionally that's enough to pin down a 
culprit, but usually it's just the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
An "elimination diet" may be tried as a preliminary step. The patient may also 
be asked to keep a food and symptom diary, which might finger a few prime 
suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Skin tests are the most usual method. An extract of a specific food is applied 
under the surface of the skin. Reddening and swelling within 15 to 20 minutes 
indicates an immediate reaction, produced by a specific hemoglobin (usually 
IgE). The tests are done in a clinic or hospital, in case of serious reactions. 
</P>
<P>
Skin tests are useful for screening possible offenders, but they can't produce 
a firm diagnosis. The same is true of the blood test known as RAST, or 
"radioallergosorbent test." 
</P>
<P>
Elimination-challenge testing is the most precise way to confirm a 
cause-and-effect relationship. Once previous testing has focused on a likely 
candidate, the suspect food is removed from the diet. If there is no 
significant improvement after two weeks, either the suspect is cleared or a 
stricter diet must be tried, eliminating other factors. 
</P>
<P>
If there is a decided improvement, the challenge phase begins -- very 
carefully. This means double-checking by reintroducing the probable offender. 
The challenge is done under supervision, in facilities equipped to cope with 
severe reactions. The patient should be in good health, experiencing minimal 
symptoms and taking little or no allergy medication. For older children and 
adults, it's done with the food and a placebo, and the patient does not know 
which he's getting. 
</P>
<P>
Once the offender has been identified, the simplest remedy is avoidance. For 
people who are violently allergic, the food must be shunned forever. With some 
allergies, it may be necessary to avoid other similar foods. Shellfish, for 
example, are particularly cross-reactive. 
</P>
<P>
Some people will need substitute foods. Milk-sensitive infants are given soy 
formulas. Patients may need lists of prepared foods that contain the offending 
substance as an ingredient and special recipes that do not. They are shown how 
to spot similar substances on food labels. Whey and casein, for instance, are 
milk derivatives; ovalbumin and ovomucoid come from eggs. 
</P>
<P>
It's true that people whose allergy is moderate may eat the food occasionally 
or in small amounts without severe reaction. But once a true food allergy has 
been diagnosed, it's probably safest to avoid the offender altogether, at least 
until rigorous retesting clears the path. 
</P>
<P>
Question: I know that Vitamin D is the sunshine vitamin and that the only other 
major source is milk that's been fortified with the vitamin. But do any other 
foods contribute any at all? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Only a few foods, all of animal origin, contain significant amounts of 
Vitamin D. And we don't eat most of those often enough or in large enough 
amounts to have much impact. Furthermore, the amount present in any given food 
varies, depending on what the animal ate and the extent to which it was exposed 
to sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
Let's take some examples. Three-and-a-half ounces of fatty fish, such as 
herring or salmon, provide 300 international units (IUs) of Vitamin D, or 150% 
of the adult Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA). If you eat these fish 
regularly, they represent a potentially good source. A piece of liver, weighing 
3 1/2 ounces before cooking, would contain between 15 and 40 IU; a medium egg, 
25 IU; and a tablespoon of butter, 15 IU. By comparison, you can depend on a 
cup of milk to give you 100 IU -- half the amount recommended for non-pregnant 
and non-lactating adults. So except for people who consistently eat fatty fish, 
the source of choice (other than sunlight) is Vitamin D fortified milk. 
</P>
<P>
Q: A friend recently served lobster at a dinner party. When I separated the 
tail from the body, I was startled to see a greenish-black, oily, sticky 
material on the tail meat that looked most unappetizing. Two of the five guests 
at the party had the same thing. Since this experience was new to us, we were 
concerned about whether the meat was safe to eat. However, we rinsed it before 
eating, and no problems occurred. Did we do the right thing? What is that 
greenish slime? 
</P>
<P>
A: Don't worry. The meat was safe, even though it looked unattractive. The 
phenomenon you observed is related to an imbalance between a lobster's ovarian 
cycle and its molting cycle. Normally, female lobsters carry their eggs in the 
tail section for nine or 10 months. In the molting cycle, the lobster sheds its 
shell for a larger one. But if this cycle is not properly synchronized with the 
ovarian cycle, the eggs are not released. The greenish-black, viscous material, 
which gets its color from a protein called lipovitellin, is simply the 
unreleased eggs. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What is the difference between white bread flour, all-purpose flour and cake 
flour? 
</P>
<P>
A: These types of flour vary in three different ways. The first has to do with 
how much of the starchy endosperm of the wheat kernel is used in each. The term 
to describe this is "patent." So-called "long-patent" flour contains a higher 
percentage of the endosperm, including the more crush-resistant portion, which 
is higher in protein than the other parts. Thus, long-patent bread flour has 
slightly more protein than all-purpose or cake flour. "Short-patent" cake flour 
contains the smallest amount of the endosperm and is lowest in protein. 
All-purpose flour falls in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
In this country, with its rich protein supply, the difference in protein 
content among these flours is nutritionally insignificant, but it's of great 
importance to the baking process. The higher amount of protein in bread flour 
leads to the development of a gluten that has the strong, elastic quality 
necessary to hold bread together. In all-purpose flour, the gluten is less 
strong and elastic. And in the starchy cake flour, the gluten is sufficiently 
weak to allow for the delicate texture of cakes. 
</P>
<P>
A second difference among this trio of flours has to do with the size of 
particles. Not only are particles largest in bread flour, they're also coarser 
and grittier than fine, powdery cake flour. Again, all-purpose flour lies in 
the middle. 
</P>
<P>
The last difference relates to the type of wheat used. Bread flour is made 
primarily from hard wheat. Cake flour is produced from soft wheat. And 
all-purpose flour is usually made from a blend of wheats mixed together to 
achieve an appropriate protein content.

YOU ASKED ABOUT: ALMONDS COME IN VARIETY OF FORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Question: I would like you to address the subject of almonds -- beginning to 
end. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The beginning poses a challenge since no one knows exactly where 
almonds originated or who first cultivated them for use as food. According to 
information from the Almond Board of California, however, records do show that 
the nuts were growing in Greece 300 years before the time of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
The Romans introduced almonds to Egypt and some Western European countries; the 
Moors planted almond trees in Portugal and Spain. New World explorers 
transported almonds to Mexico, and from there Franciscan Padres brought them to 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Today California is the only area in North America where almonds are grown 
commercially. The five major varieties cultivated in a 400-mile stretch from 
Red Bluff to Bakersfield account for more than half of the world's supply. 
</P>
<P>
One ounce (20 to 25 nuts) of whole shelled almonds contains 170 calories, six 
grams protein, five grams carbohydrates, 14 grams fat and four milligrams 
sodium. The following percentage of USRDA for minerals is also present: 15% 
phosphorus; 15% copper; 20% magnesium; 8% iron; 8% calcium. 
</P>
<P>
Almonds are sold in a variety of forms: 
</P>
<P>
Whole natural almonds -- shells removed, brown skins still present. 
</P>
<P>
Whole blanched almonds -- shells and skins removed. 
</P>
<P>
Sliced natural almonds -- thinly sliced lengthwise; contain thin band of brown 
skin. 
</P>
<P>
Sliced blanced almonds -- blanched and skins removed; thinly sliced lengthwise. 
</P>
<P>
Blanched slivered almonds -- blanched and skins removed; halved, then cut 
lengthwise in pieces about the thickness of a match stick. 
</P>
<P>
Roasted blanched slivered almonds -- blanched and skins removed; slivered and 
roasted to golden brown. 
</P>
<P>
Chopped natural almonds -- brown-skinned almonds that have been coarsely 
chopped. 
</P>
<P>
Diced roasted salted almonds -- finely diced, salted and roasted. 
</P>
<P>
TO BLANCH WHOLE NATURAL ALMONDS: 
</P>
<P>
Cover with boiling water. Let stand three minutes, then test to see if skins 
slip off easily. Remove almonds from water one at a time, slip off skins and 
let dry on paper towel several hours. 
</P>
<P>
TO TOAST ALMONDS: 
</P>
<P>
Conventional Oven: Spread almonds in a single layer in a shallow pan. Place in 
a cold oven and toast at 350 degrees 10 minutes, stirring once or twice. Cool. 
</P>
<P>
Microwave Oven: Spread almonds in a single layer in a shallow glass baking 
dish. Microwave on HIGH (100% power) four to five minutes, stirring halfway 
through. Cool. 
</P>
<P>
Skillet: Spread almonds in a single layer in large skillet over medium heat. 
Cook about 12 to 14 minutes, stirring constantly. 
</P>
<P>
TO CHOP ALMONDS: 
</P>
<P>
Food Processor or Blender: Place in food processor or blender and process 
continuously until chopped. 
</P>
<P>
Knife: Warm almonds slightly before chopping to reduce shattering. 
</P>
<P>
TO GRIND ALMONDS: 
</P>
<P>
Food Processor or Blender: Place in food processor or blender and process 
continuously until ground. 
</P>
<P>
One cup sliced almonds equals 3 1/4 ounces 
</P>
<P>
One cup slivered almonds equals 4 1/2 ounces 
</P>
<P>
One cup whole almonds (shelled) equals five ounces and will yield approximately 
1 1/4 cups when ground in a blender or food processor. 
</P>
<P>
Almonds stored in tightly sealed containers in a cool dry place, such as the 
refrigerator, will stay fresh for months. They may be frozen for even longer 
periods.

HINTS FROM HELOISE: SIMPLE LUNCH IS SIMPLY DELICIOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Since we have a microwave oven at work, I bake potatoes for my 
lunch and have been experimenting with different toppings. 
</P>
<P>
One of my favorites is to put spaghetti sauce, a sprinkle of oregano and some 
grated mozzarella cheese in the potato and then microwave it for the required 
time. It is simply delicious. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MARTHA, Albuquerque 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I love to make homemade puddings, but cleaning up is a chore. The 
pan is awful, requiring scrubbing and plenty of elbow grease. What can I do? 
</P>
<P>
 -- A Reader, Salt Lake City 
</P>
<P>
DEAR READER: Try greasing the bottom of the pan with butter or margarine to 
keep the pudding from sticking. Clean-up will be a snap. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks for writing and good luck with your next batch of pudding. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I have found a great use for yogurt containers. Each morning I 
pack lunches for my three children, and since the bags often get squashed, I 
hadn't been putting potato chips or other crushable treats in them. 
</P>
<P>
But now I put chips, cookies and other crumbly goodies in an empty, clean 
yogurt container, put on the lid and the treats stay in one piece until lunch 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Mothers will appreciate this idea and children will enjoy their crunchier 
lunches. 
</P>
<P>
 -- KATHI, San Francisco 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: We love tacos, but do the kids make a mess -- meat, lettuce, 
tomatoes, cheese and sauce everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Now I place a taco in a coffee filter and hand one to each kid. All the falling 
food lands in the filter and the kids eat all the taco. Clean-up is a snap too. 
</P>
<P>
 -- J. O., El Paso, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: My brother and I have a special way of saving candy. We take a 
small jar and label it "rainy day savings" and put all of the extra candy in 
it. Later, when we are cooped up in the house because it's either too wet or 
too cold to go outside, we take out the jar and have a snack. 
</P>
<P>
It's neat, easy and it makes staying inside more fun. 
</P>
<P>
 -- KATIE and BRANDON, Great Falls, Va. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: When I take a cold coffee mug out of the cupboard in the morning, 
I set it on top of the drip coffee-maker when it starts brewing. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the coffee is ready, the mug is warm and that first drink stays hot 
a lot longer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- DOTTI, Woodstock, Va. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: As a new mother, I am happy to see that many grocery stores now 
have baby seats as well as child safety restraints in their shopping carts. 
However, I was appalled when I found the major children's department stores in 
our area have no restraints whatsoever in their shopping carts. 
</P>
<P>
You would think stores that cater to the needs of babies and children would be 
more safety-conscious. Since they are not, I have been forced to purchase a 
safety restraint to use in these shopping carts or in highchairs in 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Stores and restaurants that do have restraints in their shopping carts and 
highchairs should pay more attention to their condition. Many times they have 
parts missing so that using the highchair or cart may imperil a child.

If safety starts at home, businesses should not cause the practice to end the 
minute you step in their front door.

DEAR HELOISE: When I make rice-cereal/marshmallow treats for my grandson, I 
save the inner wax paper from the cereal box. I butter it a little, pour the 
mixture on it and shape the treats with my hands. Saves messing up a dish.

STREET FOOD OF SINGAPORE -- AN OPEN-AIR BUFFET; 
</P>
<P>
CUISINE: BESIDES THE TRADITIONAL SOUPS AND SATAYS, EACH HAWKER MAKES A FEW 
REGIONAL SPECIALTIES.

<P>
Singapore is a foodie's dream. You can nibble and nosh. You can savor satays 
and slurp soups. Any reticence to indulge in native foods can be abandoned, and 
without hesitation one can lose his street-food innocence. 
</P>
<P>
The street-food vendors are called hawkers, and rather than pushing their carts 
along the narrow, uneven, cobblestone streets of Chinatown or the broad, modern 
avenues of the financial district, they are now gathered into food centers, 
each of which has its own character. 
</P>
<P>
The center at Rasa Singapura, near the handicraft center on the outskirts of 
the downtown Orchard Road shopping district, is like an outdoor food festival, 
with open stalls set in a park. The Satay Club center, with vendors offering 
grilled skewers of chicken or beef accompanied by fiery peanut sauces, is on a 
river walk similar to the one in San Antonio. It is next to the statue of the 
Merlion (the city's symbol, a fantasy creature with the head of a lion and the 
body of a fish). And the center at Cuppage Road is above a fragrant and 
colorful fruit and vegetable market. 
</P>
<P>
While these are some of the more visually aesthetic centers visited as part of 
a canvassing of the island's outdoor offerings, my mind drifts back to my first 
hawker adventure at a typical city food center. This one is located on the 
second and third levels of a parking garage behind the Funan Center near 
Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
It was an eerie sight at 7 a.m., as workers filed in with their jackets over 
their arms, since Singapore's climate year-round is like a Louisiana day in 
August, with heat and concomitant humidity heavily blanketing the city. 
</P>
<P>
In the glow of dawn, the food shops were emitting a blue cold light, like an 
Edward Hopper painting. Each hawker stall is about five feet wide, crowned with 
photos of its offerings on lighted boards advertising the local lager, Tiger 
beer, the way our sandwich shops' menu boards tout Coca Cola. Beneath the signs 
were pots of steaming broth and huge black iron woks in which food was being 
quickly stir-fried with angular twists of the cook's wrist. 
</P>
<P>
Graceful Arabic script was juxtaposed to vertical rows of Chinese characters, 
interspersed with occasional Hindu lettering. Between the food vendors were 
fruit stalls featuring spears of bright red papaya, wedges of odd-smelling 
durian fruit with porcupine spikes covering the skin, or bags of sweet yet 
refreshingly light-green sugar cane juice, pressed by rolling unwieldly stalks 
through rollers like dough through a pasta machine. 
</P>
<P>
In order to make the best choices, I thought of the food center as a huge 
buffet table, and I followed my philosophy that the best strategy is to scout 
the options before choosing, otherwise you risk filling your plate with salad 
before sighting the smoked salmon. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, while the dish of bee hoon (thin noodles with assorted stir-fried 
vegetables and beef swimming in a rich aromatic broth), may be sensuously 
delicious, it should be chosen only after you have considered the beef kway 
teow, which are broad noodles like Italian pappardelle coated with a thick 
brown sauce dotted with chopped green onions and punctuated with slices of 
beef. 
</P>
<P>
Each hawker makes a few specialties, with noodles the predominent offerings of 
Chinese and Nonya cuisine (the amalgam of Chinese and Malay dishes native to 
Singapore). 
</P>
<P>
After much deliberation, I selected mee Siam, a Nonya specialty of silky rice 
noodles similar to vermicelli with toothsome boiled egg, crunchy bean sprouts 
and tender prawns in a sweet and sour broth scented with chiles. My host 
decided on bakwan kepiting, another local specialty, which has pork and shrimp 
balls floating in a rich broth and chili paste served on the side for the brave 
of palate at that early hour. 
</P>
<P>
Filling the space between the rows of stalls on the concrete floor, unadorned 
except for the vendor's signs, were low, round plastic pedestal tables with 
eight stools bolted around them like flower petals. We sat down, and the cook's 
grandson brought an alcohol stove topped by a kettle of boiling water. On his 
next trip a teapot, cups, chopsticks, soy sauce and tiny condiment cups 
appeared. 
</P>
<P>
My host filled the teapot and our cups with water, and after a moment poured 
the still steaming liquid from the vessels into a tin bowl intended for that 
purpose. He then placed tea in the pot and allowed it to seep for a few moments 
before pouring it into our heated cups. 
</P>
<P>
At that moment, our food arrived ceremoniously at the table and the same young 
boy changed his demeanor from that of a frenzied busboy to an elegant French 
captain. 
</P>
<P>
The aroma filled my nose, and I started pulling bits of egg and prawn out with 
my chopsticks. There was a panoply of taste and textures. Then I sipped the 
satiny broth from the bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Around me were old men arguing about stories in the newspaper, young couples 
sharing a bowl of breakfast noodles, and teen-age girls dressed in the blue 
jumpers and white blouses of school uniforms. For them, this was the Egg 
McMuffin to fuel their bodies for the day. 
</P>
<P>

POLICE OFFICERS GET 10% RAISE IN PASADENA; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: THE NEW CONTRACT BOOSTS THE COMPENSATION FROM 13TH TO FIFTH AMONG 14 
COMPARABLE CITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

PASADENA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police officers are working under a new contract with pay and benefit increases 
that boost their compensation to fifth-highest among 14 comparable cities. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the city ranked 13th among cities surveyed by the Pasadena Police 
Officers Assn. and the city, association President Dennis Diaz said. 
</P>
<P>
Diaz said the Board of Directors, which on Tuesday unanimously approved the new 
contract, played a crucial role in breaking a three-month impasse in 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The contract provides a 10% pay increase and 4.7% increase in health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-month agreement runs retroactively from July 2 through October, 1991. 
Police officers had overwhelmingly approved the labor agreement last week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big improvement, a generous pay and benefit package," Diaz said. "I 
think the board had looked at it, saw that we were low and decided to get us 
back up to being competitive, and that's what they did." 
</P>
<P>
The 170 police officers were not the only city employees to benefit Tuesday. 
About 255 non-union employees in clerical, technical and administrative posts 
received a 5% pay increase under a salary resolution amendment also unanimously 
approved Tuesday by the board. 
</P>
<P>
For non-union employees, a provision was added for the continuation of health 
and dental coverage during unpaid maternity leave. Clerical employees who have 
worked for the city five years or less also will receive two additional days of 
sick time each year. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the board also approved a new labor contract with the city's 300 
clerical workers, represented by the Pasadena Assn. of Clerical and Technical 
Employees union. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-month contract for the city's unionized clerical workers contains wage 
increases ranging from 5% to 15.7% depending on job classification, plus 
additional health insurance benefits, said PACTE President Linda Cox. 
</P>
<P>
The contract expired July 1, and a settlement was reached the next day. Cox 
attributed the speedy resolution to the impasse with the police union and a 
desire by city negotiators to avoid creating the impression that under newly 
hired City Manager Philip Hawkey the city would have a fractious relationship 
with its labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time in the history of our union that we've settled on 
time," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
The new benefits awarded to police will cost the city almost $1.3 million 
annually, while benefits given to the non-unionized employees will come to $1.2 
million annually. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiations over the police labor contract had been the rockiest in recent 
years, Diaz said. Negotiations began in January but reached an impasse in 
April, when the contract expired. A state negotiator was called in but was 
unable to make progress. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the officers picketed outside City Hall for more than four hours 
during a June 14 board meeting and sent letters pleading their cause to more 
than 125 neighborhood groups. 
</P>
<P>
The action prompted the City Directors to provide new directions to the city's 
negotiators during a closed session that day. Improvements in the city's offer 
were made shortly thereafter, Diaz said. 
</P>
<P>
City Director Rick Cole agreed that the board played a role in moving city 
negotiators forward. He added, "We were never very far apart, yet it took a 
long time to get a contract." 
</P>
<P>
The board has always been committed to keeping its police officers at the top 
of the pay scale for law enforcement agencies and was willing to approve 
substantial increases, Cole said. It was negotiations over more than 40 other 
issues that took time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers at the top of Pasadena's pay scale will now receive $4,054 monthly in 
pay and health benefits, Diaz said. A $75-a-month bonus for bilingual officers 
was also approved. 
</P>
<P>
The age of eligibility for retirement was lowered from 55 to 50, and, as 
received by the non-union clerical employees, police officers who have been 
with the city for five years or less received two extra sick days, Diaz said. 
</P>
<P>
Changes were also made in the city's anti-drug and alcohol abuse policy. The 
police association succeeded in adding criteria to determine when an employee 
should be tested for drug abuse and in prohibiting supervisors from arbitrarily 
searching desks and lockers for drugs. Under the new language, supervisors can 
conduct the searches only when they suspect employee drug use, Diaz said.

COASTAL PANEL REJECTS CHANGES IN MARINA PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Coastal Commission has refused to accept major changes in Los 
Angeles County's plans for Marina del Rey, forcing the county to postpone its 
efforts to proceed with extensive redevelopment of the area. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioners, meeting in Long Beach, unanimously decided Tuesday to delay 
consideration of the marina issue until September to allow more time to settle 
significant differences with the county. 
</P>
<P>
"They feel, and we agree, that a postponement would be beneficial," Executive 
Director Peter Douglas told commissioners. "We do have some major problems with 
this submittal at this time." 
</P>
<P>
Douglas said the county's effort to change elements of its long-range land-use 
plan for the marina area poses serious legal problems. "I just don't see the 
way out at this point," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, adopted in 1986, had called for construction of a bypass road from 
the Marina Expressway over Lincoln Boulevard and around the north side of the 
marina before any redevelopment of residential or commercial properties could 
occur. 
</P>
<P>
But intense opposition from residents in the Oxford Triangle area of Venice -- 
a neighborhood of Los Angeles just across the boundary from the county-owned 
marina -- has blocked the bypass. 
</P>
<P>
Last February, the county Board of Supervisors amended the land-use plan to 
allow redevelopment to proceed without the bypass and without specific 
agreement on alternative transportation improvements. 
</P>
<P>
But the Coastal Commission, which shares jurisdiction with local governments 
over development anywhere in the state coastal zone, must approve any change in 
the marina land-use plan and its implementation. And the commission's staff 
recommended that the county's changes be rejected as inadequate and 
inconsistent with the original plan. 
</P>
<P>
The county, lacking the votes to overcome the staff's objections, asked for a 
two-month delay on the eve of Tuesday's commission meeting, and the coastal 
panel assented. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Reed, director of the county Department of Beaches and Harbors, which 
oversees the marina, said in an interview that the delay would give both sides 
a chance to work out their differences. 
</P>
<P>
Reed acknowledged that building the bypass would be "a monumental task." 
However, he said he does not know what the alternative to the bypass will be. 
</P>
<P>
The county recently launched a six-month study of traffic problems in and 
around the marina. The study, scheduled to be completed in late November, may 
offer alternatives to the bypass, such as shuttle buses, car pools, 
improvements to streets and intersections, and changes in traffic signals. 
</P>
<P>
County officials are worried that massive developments planned for the Lincoln 
Boulevard corridor outside the marina could preempt redevelopment of the harbor 
by using up the remaining traffic capacity in the area. 
</P>
<P>
A vigorous fight over development in the corridor is under way among Culver 
City, Los Angeles and the county. 
</P>
<P>
A massive $160-million regional shopping center called Marina Place already has 
been approved by Culver City. The $400-million Channel Gateway residential and 
office complex on the edge of the marina is about to receive final approval 
from the Los Angeles City Council. And a project that dwarfs everything else in 
the area -- the multibillion-dollar Playa Vista office, residential, retail, 
hotel and marina development -- is being planned for a vast area immediately 
south of the marina. 
</P>
<P>
Reed complained that the Coastal Commission was holding the marina hostage. "We 
think we should be allowed to go ahead with our limited redevelopment before 
these massive development issues are sorted out." 
</P>
<P>
The so-called second phase of the marina development calls for 200,000 square 
feet of new office space, 1,500 residential units, 734 new hotel rooms, plus 
additional restaurants, retail shops and boat slips.

GLASSELL PARK: A RESIDENT WORKS TO PRESERVE THE AREA'S NETWORK OF INFORMAL FOOT 
PATHS BEFORE HOUSES ARE BUILT ON TOP OF THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETSY BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Visitors to the Glassell Park home of Andy Montealegre dare not whisper the 
word "walk" unless they really intend to take one with Rita, his 3-year-old dog 
of uncertain parentage. 
</P>
<P>
She can barely contain herself at the mere mention of a race down the dirt 
paths that traverse Glassell Park's scenic hillsides. And Montealegre, 37, 
admits that he has grown nearly as fond of their daily romps as Rita. 
</P>
<P>
With an eye toward the real estate signs sprouting from Glassell Park's grassy 
fields and slopes, Montealegre says he hopes to preserve forever the area's 
informal walking trails before houses are built over them. 
</P>
<P>
He has mapped the lacework pattern of dirt trails on the neighborhood's 
hillsides, bordering rows of new houses at places, forging through 
wildflower-covered meadows and up steep, wooded hills at others. 
</P>
<P>
He hopes to have the map and language protecting the trails included in the 
area's growth plan. Property owners would be required to dedicate easements to 
the trails that cross their properties as a condition of obtaining development 
permits. 
</P>
<P>
Montealegre concedes that the odds are against him. Footings for new houses 
already encroach on some of the trails. And Montealegre, who works as a Los 
Angeles city planner on projects in other parts of the city, anticipates heated 
opposition from landowners who may bristle at the notion of giving up property 
for trail easements. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Montealegre presses ahead, firmly believing that a well-thought-out trail 
system is necessary to protect the natural ambience that attracted him to the 
neighborhood two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I lived in Hollywood before this, where people don't walk at all," Montealegre 
said. "It was a pretty rough neighborhood. When I started looking at houses up 
here, the thing that pushed it over the top was the trails. You could come home 
and walk at night, even though you live in the city." 
</P>
<P>
Evening hikes through the neighborhood introduced Montealegre to many of the 
residents who shared his fondness for the foot paths. Older folks hike the 
trails for exercise, he said. New parents carry babies along the paths in 
backpacks. Kids blaze new trails for adventure. 
</P>
<P>
"People on the trails know each other," Montealegre said, "especially the 
dog-walkers." 
</P>
<P>
He concluded that the neighborhood camaraderie fostered by the trails could 
only be protected through some sort of permanent planning mechanism, because 
many of the streets in Glassell Park are too narrow to safely accommodate 
walkers and there are few sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, a citizens advisory committee appointed by Los Angeles City 
Council members Gloria Molina and Richard Alatorre was already working on a 
plan for future development of Mt. Washington and Glassell Park. If adopted, 
the Mt. Washington/Glassell Park Neighborhood Specific Plan would establish the 
rules for future development of the area. Among the issues it addresses are 
house size, scenic corridors, parking and native plants. 
</P>
<P>
Using his planning expertise, Montealegre presented the citizens advisory 
committee with the proposal to require dedication of easements for existing 
trails upon the issuance of tract or parcel maps or building permits. 
</P>
<P>
Provisions would make the city responsible for drainage, slope cuts and 
landscaping of the trails to protect the rights and privacy of property owners 
as well as those of the people who use the trails, Montealegre said. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't do this without being concerned about security and privacy," he 
said. "I strongly believe you can do it, but when you bring it up, it scares 
people because of those issues." 
</P>
<P>
Although the citizens advisory group agreed to insert Montealegre's proposal 
into the Mt. Washington/Glassell Park Neighborhood Specific Plan, the prospects 
for designated walking trails still don't look good. The citizens group itself 
is at bitter odds with the Los Angeles Planning Department over other subjects, 
such as house sizes on hillsides, making the future of the entire plan 
uncertain. Molina has expressed her opposition to forced trail dedications on 
private property. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, there is no working prototype in Los Angeles for the kind of trail 
system Montealegre envisions: permanent, but maintained only enough to 
guarantee its preservation, without being overly landscaped or paved. 
</P>
<P>
A similar proposal to preserve and create walking trails along Mulholland Drive 
as part of a Mulholland Scenic Parkway has proven so controversial that it is 
unresolved after 17 years of debate, said Violet Moyer, former chief city 
planner for the corridor. Nearby residents fear trails would bring crime, trash 
and graffiti, Moyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Montealegre considers Glassell Park residents more resolute. The walking 
community already keeps an eye on security and makes sure the trails remain 
free of trash, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Montealegre tries to be realistic. 
</P>
<P>
"The opportunity may be lost," he said, listening as the whine of power saws 
drowned out the screeches of hawks along one of the trails on a recent weekday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
An answer could come this month, when a public hearing is held on the 
neighborhood specific plan. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Rollie, a prominent Mt. Washington realtor, predicts opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"If you asked the community as a whole, everyone would say, 'Oh, how nice!' But 
if you say, 'Will you give us two feet of your property?', no way are people 
going to do that," Rollie said. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, those in Montealegre's camp should prove more lyrical. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons we moved here was the fact that it was off the beaten 
path," said Paul Logan, a Glassell Park resident since 1974. "There was almost 
a rural sensitivity." 
</P>
<P>
As time passed, Logan said, "Camelot got discovered." 
</P>
<P>
Today, he said, "A lot of people are just looking for real estate values, and 
they don't have the sensitivity to notice an owl sitting out there on a pole, 
looking for food."

POMONA TRIES TO CLINCH DEAL FOR REGIONAL MALL 
</P>

<P>
Wary of competition from proposed shopping malls in neighboring San Bernardino 
County, city officials are scrambling to clinch a deal for their own mall 
project, in limbo since the discovery of contaminated soil on the site last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Officials consider development of the regional mall a key to Pomona's economic 
revitalization. 
</P>
<P>
City Administrator Julio Fuentes met Tuesday with representatives from May 
Centers Inc. to try to revive their interest in the project, proposed for the 
northwest corner of the Pomona Freeway and the Corona Expressway. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the best site, the freeway location and visibility," Fuentes said. "We 
own all of our land. We have the zoning and we have a plan in place." 
</P>
<P>
Officials of May Centers Inc., partly owned by May Department Stores, signed a 
preliminary agreement with Pomona in 1988 to build a mall with 100 stores, 
including at least three department stores. The project would have provided 
Pomona with more than $2.7 million a year in tax revenue and created 2,200 
jobs. But the preliminary agreement expired in March, 1989, without the signing 
of a disposition and development agreement that would have carried the project 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement lapsed after the discovery of contaminated soil on the proposed 
site, a former hog farm and dump. Fuentes met Tuesday with officials from May 
Centers to report progress in dealing with the contaminated soil and to invite 
renewed participation. "They seemed to be very interested," Fuentes said. A 
spokeswoman for the company, which is based in St. Louis, would say only that 
officials are "still exploring the Pomona-Chino market." 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Dunlap, deputy executive director of Pomona's redevelopment agency, 
said May Centers officials were initially concerned that the contamination 
might be so pervasive that cleanup for mall construction would be prohibitively 
expensive. 
</P>
<P>
But, Dunlap said, preliminary tests indicate that the contamination consists 
mainly of glass and metals confined to two of the 74 acres and that the problem 
can be solved at a cost of $750,000 to $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Dunlap said the city has spent $300,000 so far analyzing the contamination. It 
has hired consultants to prepare a cleanup plan and to develop a plan for 
determining responsibility for the cleanup costs. Those who hauled trash to the 
dump could be liable, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fuentes said the contamination problem is "extremely manageable" and should not 
retard development. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials said, the city is considering two other developers' 
proposals for the site, which the redevelopment agency acquired for $8 million 
about eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Dunlap said the city is reviewing proposals from Alexander Haagen Inc. of 
Manhattan Beach and Forest City Commercial Development of Los Angeles, both 
experienced builders of shopping centers. Forest City's projects include the 
Galleria at South Bay in Redondo Beach, Laurel Plaza in North Hollywood and the 
Mall of Victor Valley in Victorville. Haagen's projects include the Baldwin 
Hills Crenshaw Plaza in Los Angeles and the Chino Town Center. 
</P>
<P>
Fuentes said the city hopes to complete an agreement with one of the three 
developers in four to six months. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, less than 2 1/2 miles away in Chino, Homart Development Co., 
affiliated with Sears, is moving to build an 88-acre regional mall with five 
department stores at a site along the Corona Expressway. 
</P>
<P>
And between the Chino and Pomona sites is a third location in the Chino Hills 
where Bramalea California Inc. has declared its intention to develop a regional 
mall. 
</P>
<P>
All of which points to a shopping mall showdown somewhere down the road. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Moses, a Homart vice president, said that the Pomona-Chino market will 
support only one regional mall and that his project is the most advanced. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had conversations with several department stores," he said. "We have 
strong interest from two and we're talking to two others." He declined to name 
the companies. Plans call for starting mall construction in 1993 and opening 
the first phase, with at least three department stores, in 1994. Plans for the 
project have been submitted to the city of Chino for approval. 
</P>
<P>
David Wheeler, ownership representative for Majestic Realty, a partner in the 
deal, said the project is timed to coincide with the upgrading of the Corona 
Expressway, which is now only a two-lane road as it passes the shopping center 
site at Grand Avenue. A stretch of the expressway is scheduled to become a 
full-fledged freeway by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Dunlap said the Pomona mall site is superior because it would have access from 
both the Pomona Freeway and the Corona Expressway. But Wheeler said that 
advantage is offset by the fact that the Pomona site is closer to the competing 
Montclair Plaza and Puente Hills shopping centers. It would be easier for the 
Chino site to establish its own market area, he said. 
</P>
<P>
While Pomona struggles to build its regional shopping center, it also is facing 
difficulties in reviving its moribund downtown commercial area. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council last fall approved a preliminary agreement with CSA Real 
Estate Development Inc. of Anaheim to create a $50-million commercial complex 
that would have included a new home for Buffums department store. But Dunlap 
said the developer was unable to move forward and the preliminary agreement 
expired last month. 
</P>
<P>
Four other developers have offered to undertake downtown projects, he said, and 
the city has begun evaluating their qualifications.

INITIATIVE TO ALLOT COUNCIL DISTRICTS FAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A citizens group has failed to obtain enough signatures for a ballot initiative 
that would force Glendale City Council members to be elected by districts 
instead of at large, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But backers of the measure vowed this week to pursue the campaign and said they 
may ask a judge to give them time to gather more signatures. 
</P>
<P>
"If the city doesn't grant us an extension, we're definitely going to court on 
it," Richard Seeley, a spokesman for the Coalition for Electoral Reform, said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday the Los Angeles County registrar of voters' staff gave Glendale 
City Clerk Aileen Boyle the results of its verification of the 11,033 
signatures submitted June 11 by the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Boyle said the petitions contained 8,446 valid signatures from residents 
registered to vote in Glendale, nearly 2,000 fewer than required. The group 
needed 10,427 signatures, or 15% of the city's registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
When they turned in their petitions, coalition members believed they only 
needed 10% -- about 7,000 signatures -- and the verification results showed 
they met that goal. 
</P>
<P>
But after they submitted the petitions, city officials learned that an obscure 
state law requires the signatures of 15% of the voters for an initiative that 
would change a city's charter. Coalition members said they erred because they 
received incorrect advice from city staff members and from their own attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale City Atty. Scott H. Howard said the shortage of signatures was reason 
enough to disqualify the initiative. Had the group obtained 15%, Howard said he 
could have recommended it be disqualified for technical flaws that he refused 
to reveal. 
</P>
<P>
"There were other grounds for rejecting it," Howard said. "At this time, it's 
unnecessary to discuss it." 
</P>
<P>
The initiative was aimed at changing the way the Glendale council members are 
elected by switching to the district system used by cities such as Los Angeles 
and Pasadena. Glendale voters would vote for a single council member serving 
their district. Voters currently cast ballots for all five council seats. 
</P>
<P>
Backers of the initiative said it would bring greater representation to 
sections of Glendale they say are neglected, including the southern part of the 
city and the Montrose community. They pointed out that three of the current 
council members live in the affluent Chevy Chase Canyon area. 
</P>
<P>
The current council members have strongly opposed the measure, saying it would 
curtail a resident's ability to influence City Hall and would lead to back-room 
political deals in which council members would trade votes for projects in one 
another's districts. 
</P>
<P>
Howard said the coalition cannot now add to the valid signatures they've 
submitted. He said state law requires them to start over to qualify the measure 
for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
But coalition spokesman Seeley said the group is looking at other options. On 
Tuesday he and coalition Chairman Arthur Segien were reviewing the petitions 
for signatures they believe were incorrectly disallowed. 
</P>
<P>
The initial inspection, however, turned up only a handful of errors, Seeley 
said. He said the next step will be to ask city officials for time to gather 
more names because the group turned in its petitions almost four weeks before 
the deadline provided under state law. 
</P>
<P>
If city officials refuse, Seeley and Segien said they are both committed to 
seeking an extension in court, using a new legal adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've already talked to an attorney, and he says we have a pretty good case," 
Segien said.

WOMEN'S SHELTER MAY GET HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By URSULA WILJANEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale YWCA's shelter for battered women, formerly known as Phoenix 
House, once again appears to be rising from the ashes of adversity. 
</P>
<P>
The shelter closed down last week after it lost its county funding, which made 
up more than a third of its $150,000 budget. But Peter Whittingham, a deputy to 
Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich who oversees domestic violence 
programs, said a $5,000 check that could enable the shelter to reopen 
temporarily should be issued in a matter of days. The money is left over from 
last year in Antonovich's discretionary account, Whittingham said. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisor, who represents Glendale, also will ask at a July 16 budget 
hearing for permission to spend $55,000 from his discretionary fund for this 
year, which totals about $500,000. That amount would partially fund the shelter 
for the next 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Glendale Police Officers Assn. on Monday pledged to raise 
$60,000 for the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors must approve the allocation from Antonovich's funds, 
but the board generally does not prevent supervisors from using discretionary 
funds for projects within their districts, Whittingham said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thrilled," Pax Adair, executive director of the YWCA, said Tuesday. "I'd 
always hoped, from the beginning, that the community in one way or another 
would rally. I almost wish we were still called Phoenix House. In a sense, this 
is like the phoenix rising from the ashes." 
</P>
<P>
This isn't the first time the 11-year-old shelter has gone down. Six years ago 
its facility was destroyed in a devastating fire. Two years ago, an earthquake 
forced it to close for extensive repairs. 
</P>
<P>
This time, it was the County Board of Supervisors that dealt the shelter a 
crippling blow. The board voted 3 to 2 on July 3 to cut off county funding -- 
the only public money received by the shelter -- retroactively as of July 1. 
Antonovich, who proposed an alternative that would have allowed the shelter to 
continue operating, opposed the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Now the shelter could get more than the $60,000 it lost, money Adair said is 
sorely needed. "We never have more than we need. Running it on $150,000 is like 
running it on a shoestring," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale Police Officer Jim Lowrey, treasurer of the police officers' 
association, said the group's annual fund-raising campaign would kick off next 
week with phone calls to businesses and flyers distributed to residents. All of 
the money raised will go to the shelter, he said. County supervisors made the 
cuts in domestic violence programs after the county's Department of Community 
and Senior Citizens Services last month found a $320,000 shortfall in revenues 
to pay for the programs, said Larry Johnson, department assistant director. 
</P>
<P>
Funding for domestic violence programs comes from a $19 surcharge on each 
marriage license issued in the county, and fewer people than anticipated are 
getting married, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The county's Domestic Violence Council, an advisory board made up of 
representatives from various public and private agencies, including shelters 
for battered women, met June 6 to try to find a way to minimize cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
The council's recommendation to the Board of Supervisors, much to Adair's 
dismay, was to cut all funding for the county's two transitional shelters -- 
the Glendale YWCA's shelter and one in the South Bay -- and thus reduce the 
amount cut from the budgets for the remaining 16 shelters, which are crisis 
shelters. 
</P>
<P>
Crisis shelters house abused women and their children for up to 45 days. 
Transitional shelters house women for up to six months and provide services in 
addition to counseling, such as job training, Adair said. All transitional 
shelter residents have been in crisis shelters, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the Glendale shelter was a crisis shelter, called Phoenix House, 
until it closed for earthquake repairs in 1988, Adair said. The shelter 
reopened that year with a new name and a new purpose -- to help abused women 
make the transition back into normal life and work, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the main reasons we changed over, and I will stand by this, is that 45 
days is often not long enough for a battered woman to rebuild her life," said 
Adair, who was a resident of the shelter eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Grants to the 16 crisis shelters were cut from $80,000 to $71,000 and grants to 
the two transitional shelters were cut entirely. 
</P>
<P>
Domestic Violence Council Chairwoman Cheryl Ward said Monday that the state 
legislation allowing counties to fund shelter programs uses the term "emergency 
shelter" and does not mention transitional housing. 
</P>
<P>
Ward, a senior assistant Los Angeles city attorney, said she would have liked 
to see the transitional shelters converted into crisis shelters rather than 
excluded altogether. "We need the beds," she said, referring to a 1988-89 
county grand jury report, which showed that fewer than 10% of the battered 
women needing shelter can find it. 
</P>
<P>
"This is only another reminder that there are not enough resources for domestic 
violence programs," Ward said.

<P>
WASTE-MANAGEMENT PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South Pasadena has joined more than a dozen other San Gabriel Valley cities in 
a collective agreement to meet a state-mandated reduction of solid waste. 
</P>
<P>
The 14-city authority will be responsible for hiring a consultant to oversee 
the waste-management project. Under California's 1989 Waste Management Act, 
cities must reduce landfill disposal 25% by 1995 and 50% by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
City officials estimate South Pasadena's participation in the joint authority 
will cut estimated costs to $40,000 to $50,000, a savings of about $50,000.

HEARING ON PARK LABREA FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A hearing has been set for Sept. 28 on an appeal by Park Labrea management of 
the city's rejection of a proposed charge of more than $3 million to tenants 
for the cost of fencing and gating the 10,000-resident apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
"The appellant has claimed that there was departmental error, abuse of 
discretion, and that there is new evidence or information to present which was 
not previously available," said a notice sent by the Rent Stabilization 
Division of the city's Community Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing will be held at 9 a.m. at the Rent Adjustment Commission's 
eighth-floor hearing room, at 215 W. 6th St. 
</P>
<P>
The Rent Stabilization Division, in its decision handed down in May, found that 
Forest City Management Co. did not provide enough information to justify the 
proposed rent increases, and that the fencing and gating system was not yet 
operating when the application was filed. 
</P>
<P>
Forest City, which operates Park Labrea and owns a half-interest in the 
4,200-unit complex, submitted its application for a rent hike on Sept. 25 of 
last year, hoping to be allowed to charge tenants $12.09 a month in perpetuity 
to defray the cost of the $3,054,588 security system.

PRIVATE SCHOOL GETS PERMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite opposition from some residents, the City Council unanimously granted a 
conditional-use permit for a private school in Arcadia to relocate to a church 
property on Bradbourne Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Anita Oaks School, formerly Anoakia School, will be the first private school in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
It will have an estimated 350 students from preschool to eighth grade and will 
operate out of the First Assembly of God Church, 822 Bradbourne Ave. 
</P>
<P>
The council's decision Tuesday night came after a three-hour public hearing. 
Parents, school officials and students spoke in favor of granting the permit, 
saying that Duarte needs an alternative school system. Neighboring residents, 
especially senior citizens living in the adjacent Treelane Mobile Home Park, 
said they are against the noise and increased traffic they expect the school to 
bring. 
</P>
<P>
Among conditions set by the council for operation of the school are a 
noise-level study and an eight-foot wall between the school and the mobile home 
park.

VOTE ON VIEW LAW DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Monday delayed voting on a law designed to protect 
residential views, after several council members voiced concerns that the 
proposed ordinance might infringe on the rights of property owners. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance would prohibit construction from blocking neighbors' window 
views. 
</P>
<P>
It would apply to two-story structures, additions of more than 75% of an 
existing building and to multifamily residences with three or more units. Under 
the law, each homeowner could designate one window's view for protection. 
</P>
<P>
"This could absolutely deny a neighbor the right to build on their side," 
Councilwoman Marie T. Purvis said. Councilman Samuel Kiang said the city is 
venturing into "uncharted legal waters" and could be sued by angry homeowners 
who could be denied the right to develop their property. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Judy Chu, who supports the concept of a view ordinance, agreed that the 
city must proceed cautiously. 
</P>
<P>
If the ordinance passes, Monterey Park would become the only city in the San 
Gabriel Valley with such a law, city officials said. No date was set for 
reconsideration. Currently, the cities of Rancho Palos Verdes and Rolling Hills 
Estates have view ordinances.

GARBAGE FEES INCREASED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council last week approved a trash fee increase of 5.64% for the 
fiscal year 1990-1991. 
</P>
<P>
This means that single-family homes using 90-gallon garbage containers will pay 
$8.87 per month, up from $8.45. 
</P>
<P>
The new fees, based on rising costs for residential refuse service, are 
effective this month. Residents who use 60-gallon containers will pay $7.34 a 
month, and each additional 60- or 90-gallon container will cost $2.11 a month.

COUNCIL OKS FENCE FUNDS

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council voted unanimously to pay for half the cost of erecting a 
chain-link fence atop a portion of the block wall surrounding Zamora Park. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining half of the estimated $4,000 cost will be paid by El Monte 
resident Patrick Quan, who owns a 24-unit apartment complex next to the park 
and west of Maxson Road. Quan requested the fence to prevent broken windows, 
wall and roof damage and burglary and vandalism that he said resulted from 
activity in the park.

<P>
Hersher Construction of Glendora will refurbish the historic two-story 
California bungalow-style house that will be the La Fetra Center in Glendora, 
the City Council decided Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Hersher, the lowest of five bidders, agreed to restore the soon-to-be senior 
center at the northwest corner of Foothill Boulevard and Minnesota Avenue for 
$263,900, about $75,000 less than the next lowest bidder. 
</P>
<P>
Glendora City Manager Art Cook said seniors should be able to start using the 
center this fall. He said the building was donated to the city by the La Fetra 
family, which developed Rain Bird Sprinkler Manufacturing Corp. of Glendora.

CITY FEES INCREASING

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cost of attending city recreation programs, freeing impounded animals, 
obtaining paramedic ambulance service, buying a bicycle license and receiving 
many other city services will increase under a fee schedule approved Tuesday by 
the Board of Directors. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the 1,154 separate fees charged by the city were raised 6.5% to reflect 
an increased in the consumer price index, said John Ostrowski, the city's 
management audit administrator. However, certain library and health department 
fees will stay the same. 
</P>
<P>
City directors delayed for a week a decision on imposing a new fee to be paid 
every time a newly surfaced street is dug into for a utility or cable 
television company. Objections were raised by gas company officials.

Tom Kendall has been on the fast track since he began racing automobiles at age 
18. 
</P>
<P>
But after a year without a victory on the Sports Club Car of America Trans-Am 
circuit, Kendall, a La Canada resident, is back in the winner's circle. 
</P>
<P>
Kendall, 23, moved into first place in the series with a victory Saturday at 
Cleveland. He averaged 111.96 m.p.h. in his Chevrolet Beretta over the 42-lap, 
99-mile circuit at Burke Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Kendall, who also won the Trans-Am event at Detroit a few weeks ago, has 135 
Trans-Am points.

of Lewisville, Tex., 5 and 4, Tuesday in first-round match play of the 64th 
Women's Western Golf Assn. Junior Invitational at Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Klein, the California state amateur champion, fired a 6-over-par 78 on Monday, 
one shot better than Kemper on the 6,098-yard, par-72 Live Oak course at 
Lakeway Country Club. Klein is 16.

Bound to be a Badger: Hoover High's Creighton Harris has signed a letter of

Basketball finale: There may have been a shortage of players, but enthusiasm 
was abundant at last week's Camp Fire Stars and Stripes All-Star basketball

SENATE PASSES COMMUNITY COLLEGE ELECTION BILL; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: MEASURE SEEKS TO BOOST MINORITY REPRESENTATION ON BOARD BY ELECTING 
TRUSTEES BY DISTRICT. A VETO IS THREATENED.

<P>
The state Senate this week gave final passage to a bill supporters say is aimed 
at boosting minority representation on the Los Angeles Community College 
governing board by forcing trustees to run for election by district. 
</P>
<P>
The seven trustees now run for election at large, meaning all registered voters 
within the sprawling community college system are eligible to cast ballots in 
the races. 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 23 to 11 Monday, the Senate sent the measure by Assemblyman 
Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) to Gov. George Deukmejian. The governor vetoed 
the same proposal last year and has indicated he plans to do so again this 
year, a Polanco aide said. 
</P>
<P>
The community college system encompasses the city of Los Angeles and several 
surrounding communities. It is composed of nine campuses, including West Los 
Angeles College in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
Polanco and those backing his bill argue that elections by district would 
increase the chances of minorities winning more seats on the governing board 
because several districts would contain large percentages of minority voters. 
</P>
<P>
Polanco said he initially pressed to change the voting system "to allow for 
more racial minority representation . . . because that's what true democracy is 
all about." 
</P>
<P>
The current board is made up of one black, one Latino, one Asian and four 
Anglos. 
</P>
<P>
In vetoing the same bill last year, Deukmejian said the state should not 
interfere in local issues. "Local government election matters have 
traditionally been placed in the hands of local citizens and should remain 
there," the governor said. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Ortiz, an aide to Polanco, said the governor's office recently restated 
its opposition in a letter to the assemblyman. "We're likely to get a veto 
again," Ortiz said. 
</P>
<P>
But Polanco said, in an effort to change Deukmejian's mind, he intends to 
appeal to the governor's reputation as a fiscal conservative and stress the 
cost savings that could be realized by district elections. A state Senate 
analysis of the proposal estimated that district elections for board seats 
could cut balloting costs for the community college system by as much as 50%. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Lindsay Conner acknowledged that district elections could save 
the system $350,000 to $500,000 annually. But he said a majority of the current 
board opposes such a change because it would lead to "a highly politicized, 
log-rolling board, and a paralyzed central administration." 
</P>
<P>
Conner said district elections eventually would force trustees to represent the 
special interests of individual campuses, rather than all nine schools, and 
would create "a much more intensely political system." 
</P>
<P>
He also disputed the claim that changing to district elections would increase 
minority representation on the board. To support his argument, he noted that 
the board's current makeup is the same as that for the Los Angeles Board of 
Education, which elects its members by district.

STATE SENATE OKS AIRPORT LAW EXEMPTION

The state Senate has approved on a 22-8 vote a bill by Sen. Robert G. Beverly 
(R-Manhattan Beach) to exempt Los Angeles County from a tough new airport 
land-use law. 
</P>
<P>
The bill now goes to the Assembly for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Under the current law, the Los Angeles County Regional Planning Commission is 
required to develop comprehensive land-use plans to ensure that proposed 
building projects are compatible with development patterns around the county's 
17 airports. Earlier this year, the Legislature extended the deadline for 
county compliance with the law by six months, to Jan. 1, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly's bill seeks to exempt the county from the law. The bill's supporters 
say the law's required review of all developments near airports will place an 
unfair burden on county planners. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly said his proposal may be modified to establish a new commission that 
would be charged with reviewing airport-related planning issues in Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), who authored the current law, opposes 
Beverly's measure. She has criticized the bill as inappropriate because it 
would make Los Angeles the only county in the state without a plan for dealing 
with construction around airports. 
</P>
<P>
Among the bill's supporters are Los Angeles County and the cities of Torrance, 
Long Beach and Culver City. It is opposed by the city of Los Angeles.

PASADENA: EXECUTIVE FITNESS CLUB OWNER BLAMES CLOSURE ON DIFFICULTIES WITH 
BUILDING OWNERS.

<P>
The Executive Fitness Club, beleaguered by financial problems since its shaky 
opening last year, has closed its doors, leaving members seeking new places to 
"go for the burn." 
</P>
<P>
Club owner Tony DeMaio, according to his attorney Hal Long, blames the demise 
on longstanding difficulties with Arroyo Seco Building Ltd., owner of the 
building in which the club was located. DeMaio could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
"To the last day of operation, the club was never fully completed," Long said. 
"By (the landlord's) not doing what he said he was going to do, that resulted 
in eventually killing the club." 
</P>
<P>
But Michael J. Melton, attorney for the partnership that owns the building at 
117 E. Colorado Blvd., said he interpreted the closure as DeMaio's way of 
avoiding an eviction trial Tuesday. Because DeMaio moved out, Melton said, the 
proceedings scheduled for Pasadena Municipal Court were canceled. 
</P>
<P>
Executive Fitness had filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of federal 
bankruptcy laws in December. DeMaio, who initially targeted an upscale 
clientele, has filed a $9.4-million suit against the building's owners. DeMaio 
has claimed that Gene Buchanan, a developer and a general partner in the 
company that owns the building, failed to make improvements necessary for 
completion of the club. 
</P>
<P>
"Baloney," Melton said to charges that Buchanan or the building's other owners 
were to blame for the club's downfall. 
</P>
<P>
Closure signs went up last weekend. It was the only notice given to members, 
who showed up this week to work out. 
</P>
<P>
At midday Tuesday, unsuspecting club members still were arriving. Marco Coello, 
a 21-year-old from Pasadena who was dressed in a sleeveless sweat shirt and 
shorts, said he found it frustrating to discover the club was closed. 
</P>
<P>
But Carole Fawcett, a sales counselor for Nautilus Aerobics Plus, was there to 
hand Coello a leaflet, describing her club's benefits and an introductory offer 
for Executive members. 
</P>
<P>
Nautilus Aerobics Plus plans a mid-August opening of its cavernous new facility 
in a restored building on Arroyo Parkway, just down the street from where 
Executive was located. 
</P>
<P>
Besides trying to attract new members, Fawcett was maintaining a vigil outside 
the closed doors of Executive to help Nautilus members who had been working out 
at Executive while waiting for the new facility to open. 
</P>
<P>
Fawcett said she had been there periodically since Friday night, when signs 
first went up announcing the closing. "Friday night was hysterical and Monday 
was a zoo," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of club members showed up to exercise, she said. 
</P>
<P>
A sign advised them to pick up locker contents at 99 E. Colorado Blvd. on 
Saturday from 10 a.m. to noon. 
</P>
<P>
While Fawcett handed out brochures, another nearby gym was also trying to sign 
up some of the displaced exercisers. A spokeswoman for the Brignole Fitness 
Training Club said the DeLacey Avenue facility was making a special offer to 
Executive's cardholders, temporarily reducing by $125 its $450 annual rate.

FISHING;

ANGLER HAS SUCCESSFUL NINE-DAY TRIP TO BAJA

<P>
A recent long-range fishing trip to Baja was a dream come true for Marc Larson 
of San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
Larson, 22, started fishing with his father in the surf off Long Beach at 5 and 
has been hooked ever since. He spends all his free time fishing from barges, 
day boats and float tubes in the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Larson left for a nine-day trip aboard the 125-foot Royal Polairs. 
After traveling for two days, the first stop was Thetis bank. 
</P>
<P>
Larson said yellowtail blanketed the water. 
</P>
<P>
When word came over the speaker to cast the lines, Larson tossed a jig at the 
yellowtail and came up with a 50-pound fish on his first hook-up. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the 33 anglers aboard the Royal Polairs caught a fish weighing more 
than 35 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
After two days at Thetis bank, the boat headed to Cedrus where Larson said he 
caught some of the largest calico bass he had ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
Although he failed to win any jackpots, he did manage to net his first dorado, 
which he brought home to have stuffed. 
</P>
<P>
Royal Polairs' total catch for the trip was 890 yellowtail, 300 calico bass and 
a few dorado and amberjack. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Larson has fulfilled one of his childhood dreams, he has set a new 
goal -- tuna fishing on a 15-day trip. 
</P>
<P>

FORMER PALISADES STANDOUT CATCHES THE SPIRIT OF 76ERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN HERBERT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Derek Strong's four years of hard work at Xavier University were rewarded when 
the Philadelphia 76ers chose the former Palisades High standout in the second 
round of the NBA draft, the 47th selection overall. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for a player who was considered a "sleeper" coming out of high school 
and missed his freshman season after failing to meet the NCAA's Proposition 48 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a workaholic and puts a lot of time working on his game, in the weight 
room, and does the same with his studies," Xavier Coach Pete Gillen said. "He's 
a very determined person." 
</P>
<P>
That determination also paid off in the classroom, as Strong received a 
communication arts degree this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Strong's top basketball moment came in the NCAA Midwest Regionals, when he 
teamed with 6-9 Tyrone Hill (the Golden State Warriors' first-round draft 
choice) to outplay the much-heralded Georgetown duo of 7-2 Dikembe Mutombo and 
6-10 Alonzo Mourning in Xavier's 74-71 upset. Strong led the Musketeers with 19 
points and 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"He took the ball right to their big guys," Gillen said. "He was aggressive and 
attacked the basket against Mourning and Mutombo. He really rises to the 
occasion in big games." 
</P>
<P>
The victory put the Cincinnati school into the NCAA's Sweet 16 for the first 
time. Strong continued his fine postseason play with a season-high 27 points in 
Xavier's next game, a 102-89 loss to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Strong's .839 free throw percentage led the 28-5 Musketeers this past season. 
The 6-7 1/2 center was also designated to shoot free throws when opponents were 
called for technical fouls, an honor traditionally bestowed on guards. 
</P>
<P>
"When he first came to Xavier, Derek didn't shoot the ball well from the 
free-throw line, but the summer after his sophomore season he put a lot of time 
in and got better and better," Gillen said. 
</P>
<P>
Strong's ability to make free throws was a key in the 76ers' decision to draft 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"The two things that impressed me the most about Derek is that he rebounds the 
ball in traffic and is an excellent foul shooter, something almost impossible 
to find today in a big player," said Bob Weinhauer, the 76ers' director of 
player personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Strong concluded his Xavier career as the school's sixth leading rebounder and 
11th scorer. His .573 career field goal percentage was second in school history 
to Hill. 
</P>
<P>
This past season, Strong averaged 14.2 points and was a second team 
All-Midwestern Collegiate Conference selection. His other honors included being 
named to the 1990 All-MCC Tournament team and the MCC All-Newcomer team after 
his 1987-88 sophomore season. 
</P>
<P>
"He plays physically, but also has good finesse moves in the post area," Gillen 
said. "He has a terrific shooting touch for a big man. He can really shoot the 
ball from 17, 18 feet out." 
</P>
<P>
The 76ers project Strong to be a backup to power forward Rick Mahorn. He also 
might get playing time at center. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to a good team for him," Gillen said. "It will take Derek time to 
adjust to the NBA, but by his second year, he'll be a solid contributor. He'll 
be one of the 76ers' seven or eight top players." 
</P>
<P>
Strong was a two-time varsity letter winner at Palisades. As a senior in 
1985-86, he averaged 17 points, 10 rebounds and nine blocks per game to lead 
the Dolphins to a 17-7 record.

Algerian Prime Minister Mouloud Hamrouche and four of his Cabinet ministers 
were dropped from the politburo of the ruling National Liberation Front in a 
reshuffle prompted by its crushing electoral defeat last month. The shake-up 
capped a three-day meeting of the 268-member central committee of the ruling 
party after the upset victory by the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front in 
the June 12 elections.

NAACP CALLS FOR END TO EMPLOYER SANCTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite opposition from a vocal minority who briefly disrupted the NAACP's 
national convention, the civil rights group Wednesday approved a resolution 
calling for a repeal of penalties against employers who hire illegal immigrant 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
The vote gives a major boost to the drive to abolish employer sanctions and 
helps salve wounds that have developed in the relationship between the NAACP 
and Latino groups. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Latino groups had threatened to withdraw from a key civil 
rights coalition if the NAACP did not back repeal of the sanctions, a key 
provision of the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act. 
</P>
<P>
Some blacks argue that illegal immigration contributes to high unemployment 
among blacks. The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and other 
Latino groups argue, however, that the sanctions provision has fostered 
widespread discrimination against all Latino workers, regardless of their 
immigration status. 
</P>
<P>
The NAACP's move came after an angry debate at the Los Angeles Convention 
Center. Most of the opposition was voiced by delegates from Southern 
California, where the impact of illegal immigration has been strongly felt. 
</P>
<P>
One San Fernando Valley delegate moved that the resolution be tabled until a 
study of "the high unemployment among black Americans" could be completed. 
</P>
<P>
That motion was defeated 279 to 175. Larry Steele, the NAACP official presiding 
over the meeting, then called a vote on the employer sanctions resolution. "No 
discussion against," he announced, hurriedly calling for a vote on the 
resolution. "Motion carries, resolution adopted," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Feeling that they had been denied a chance to debate the issue, several 
delegates began shouting "No!" Their cries soon grew into a loud chant. After 
more than a minute, Steele agreed to allow discussion. 
</P>
<P>
"We used (the sanctions) to keep undocumented aliens from taking the food from 
black children," said Charles B. Johnson of the Pasadena NAACP branch. "If you 
withdraw those sanctions, then you open the door and you flood this state with 
a multitude of undocumented aliens who will take the jobs of blacks and other 
minorities." 
</P>
<P>
About half a dozen speakers came out against the resolution, while only one -- 
Joseph Duff, president of the Los Angeles branch of the NAACP -- publicly 
defended it. 
</P>
<P>
With passage of the resolution in doubt, NAACP Executive Director Benjamin 
Hooks, who had given personal assurances to Latino leaders that it would be 
adopted, stepped to the microphone to address the delegates. 
</P>
<P>
"I urge you to vote for this resolution," Hooks said. Because a recent General 
Accounting Office report had shown that the employer sanctions had contributed 
to workplace discrimination, Hooks said, the civil rights organization had 
little choice but to call for their repeal. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution was then approved by about a 3-1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
Raul Yzaguirre, president of the National Council of La Raza, one of two Latino 
organizations leading the fight against employer sanctions, said he was 
"elated" to hear of the NAACP vote. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a commitment from the NAACP leadership that this was going to happen," 
Yzaguirre said. "This means we can have real solidarity with the NAACP on civil 
rights issues. It will initiate a new era of mutual cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
Antonia Hernandez of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund 
said her organization would work to dispel the "misconception that Latino 
immigration causes job displacement." 
</P>
<P>
In other developments at the convention, which ends today, Rev. Jesse Jackson 
called on President Bush to host a summit meeting with U.S. civil rights 
leaders aimed at hammering out a domestic economic aid policy.

JEWS CALL FOR DIALOGUE ON RACISM CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID J. FOX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jewish leaders Wednesday called for a dialogue between blacks and members of 
the entertainment industry to respond to charges of Jewish racism raised at a 
panel discussion at the NAACP convention in Los Angeles on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
At a discussion on "Blacks in the Entertainment Industry," some panelists 
voiced anger at what they said was the influence of Jewish and other white 
executives over film and music distribution and how that prevents blacks from 
advancing in the business and improving their media image. 
</P>
<P>
The strongest criticism came from Legrand Clegg, chairman of the national 
Coalition Against Black Exploitation and the city attorney of Compton, who is 
not affiliated with the entertainment industry. He said Tuesday that black 
leaders should raise the "issue of the century-old problem of Jewish racism in 
Hollywood" in the same way that Jewish leaders complain about anti-Semitic 
remarks made by black leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Marla Gibbs, another panelist, star and producer of the TV sitcom "227," 
disputed partially quoted remarks attributed to her in a Times story Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Her remarks, in their entirety, concerning how blacks could adopt a positive 
approach to solving problems they face in the industry, were: "I think we're 
all talking about film and distribution and marketing based on how the Jewish 
people and the other people set it up. It was not set up for us. So we have a 
problem. We have to learn to use what we have." 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs urged black entrepreneurs to use other ways of financing their ventures 
by going to churches and local NAACP chapters to generate support outside the 
industry for black projects. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Laura Geller, director of the Pacific Southwest Region of the American 
Jewish Congress, said her group "is deeply troubled by the allegations and 
apparent perception of Jewish racism in the entertainment industry." She said 
her organization would like to hold a meeting with Clegg, other blacks and 
members of the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
"To characterize the entertainment industry as controlled by Jews is an 
inaccurate and dangerous stereotype," said Rabbi Gary Greenebaum, executive 
director of the Los Angeles chapter of the American Jewish Committee. 
Greenebaum called for "open and honest" discussion of the issues. "Attacks of 
this kind do nothing to solve problems." 
</P>
<P>
Various groups have criticized Hollywood over the years. Women's rights 
organizations, as well as black, Latino, Asian, Italian and religious groups, 
have complained about the lack of access to the decision-making structure of 
entertainment companies and about images presented in films, recordings and 
television. 
</P>
<P>
What made this round of criticism different, said one studio spokesman who did 
not wish to be named, was that it focused on Jewish film executives. The film 
business was founded by Jewish immigrants and many Jews still occupy key 
executive positions, but entertainment companies today are diversified in 
ownership and most are publicly held corporations. Attempts to reach other 
executives for comment were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin L. Hooks, executive director of the the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People, said Wednesday that the views expressed by 
panelists "are not necessarily" the views of the national civil rights 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
The panel remarks followed release of a survey by the Beverly Hills/Hollywood 
chapter of the NAACP which reports that blacks have fewer opportunities in 
Hollywood executive suites than they did 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
David Lehrer, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, 
acknowledged that "perhaps many blacks haven't gone into the entertainment 
industry." But he called Clegg's remarks "outrageous anti-Semitism and patent 
nonsense. . . . The Sony Corp., MGM, Universal and all the other studios do not 
have religious affiliations," Lehrer said. "They choose to produce films 
because of what they think will sell."

ANOTHER MEDFLY IN MUCH-SPRAYED ROSEMEAD; 
</P>
<P>
INFESTATION: DISCOVERY TRIGGERS FEARS OF A SUMMER POPULATION EXPLOSION. A NEW 
ROUND OF MALATHION APPLICATIONS IS LIKELY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ASHLEY DUNN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Agriculture officials reported Wednesday that another Mediterranean fruit fly 
has been trapped in Rosemead, virtually assuring a new round of aerial 
malathion applications in what was one of the most heavily sprayed sectors in a 
yearlong eradication effort across Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery reinforced fears among scientists and community activists that 
the state's strategy in fighting the pest has failed. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second fly trapped in Rosemead in a week. Moreover, officials 
announced late Wednesday that what was tentatively identified as a Medfly had 
been discovered in Central Los Angeles. Entomologists hypothesize that every 
Medfly trapped signals the presence of hundreds more of the insects. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the state's scientific advisers said that the latest Rosemead discovery 
is a distressing sign that the pest may be on the verge of a summer population 
boom. A similar explosion last summer eventually led to widespread spraying 
across the region. 
</P>
<P>
James R. Carey, one of five members of the state's Medfly Science Advisory 
Panel, has said that over the last 15 years the vast majority of Medflies found 
in California were trapped in August, September and October, when warm 
temperatures and an abundance of ripe fruit offer ideal breeding conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"We're only in the foothills," Carey said Wednesday. "The peak is in September 
and October. It's very possible this could grow as large as before." 
</P>
<P>
Carey and the four other members of the state's advisory panel, which oversees 
the eradication effort, participated Wednesday in a telephone conference to 
discuss a new battle plan to combat the pest. They were unavailable for comment 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
But state Department of Food and Agriculture Director Henry J. Voss said the 
panel recommended that the Rosemead neighborhood be sprayed twice and then 
treated with the release of sterile flies intended to breed the pest out of 
existence. 
</P>
<P>
Voss said plans already were being laid to spray malathion in the area on 
Monday, although he said his final decision will come today after a related 
court hearing in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Our concern is that with the hot weather and with these flies popping up now, 
we need to be right on them," Voss said. "It's not a very satisfying situation, 
that's for sure." 
</P>
<P>
Carey said: "This is the beginning of Round 2." 
</P>
<P>
Just hours after announcement of the Rosemead discovery, state officials said 
they had found yet another Medfly about three miles north of where a single fly 
was in Echo Park two weeks ago. Officials said identification of the fly was 
not completely certain, so no decision has yet been made on what action to 
take. 
</P>
<P>
In Rosemead, the single mated female Medfly was trapped in a nectarine tree 
just north of Interstate 10, three blocks from where a fly was trapped last 
week. The first Medfly normally would have prompted an order for spraying, but 
a decision was delayed because scientists were unable to make a complete 
identification of the specimen. 
</P>
<P>
Complicating the Rosemead situation is an ongoing attempt by the city of Los 
Angeles to obtain a court order to block spraying over a 14-square-mile sector 
of downtown, including Echo Park, Silver Lake, Chinatown, Bunker Hill and Skid 
Row. That spraying is scheduled to begin tonight and continue every Thursday 
night for at least three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The city has asked a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge to block the 
spraying. It contends that recent laboratory tests have shown excessive 
quantities of lead, nickel and chromium in the sticky mixture of malathion and 
fly bait sprayed by state-chartered helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
State health officials say the amounts are minor and pose no significant health 
risks. 
</P>
<P>
Voss said that a ruling by Superior Court Judge John Zebrowski could influence 
his decision on what to do in the Rosemead outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
The new discoveries came just as it appeared Southern California was on verge 
of victory over the stubborn infestation. At the height of the yearlong siege, 
helicopters rumbled over 536 square miles of Los Angeles, Orange, San 
Bernardino and Riverside counties. The malathion treatment zone had shrunk to 
nothing over the last two weeks, after spraying was completed in San Bernardino 
and Riverside counties on June 26. 
</P>
<P>
For residents of Los Angeles and Rosemead living near the latest discoveries, 
the possibility of more spraying brought frustration. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood near Dodger Stadium where a Medfly was found June 27 was the 
first one sprayed when the infestation began last year. 
</P>

Rosemead -- along with parts of Pasadena, El Monte and Arcadia -- was sprayed 
10 times from November through May -- still a record in the current 
infestation. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question now that this program doesn't work," said Patty Prickett, 
who chairs a community group called Residents Against Spraying Pesticides. "All 
it's done is taken millions of dollars of taxpayers' money and exposed people 
to a toxic chemical. It's a disaster."

Carrol Calkins, a federal entomologist who serves on the advisory panel, said 
scientists had expected to find more flies this summer, but the hope was that 
they would be limited to new areas.

Two Mediterranean fruit flies have been discovered in the past two weeks in 
Rosemead. The Medflies were trapped within the old Rosemead spray zone, which 
was sprayed 10 times from November, 1989, to May. Spraying was halted in the 
zone on May 9 after the pest was supposedly eradicated from the area.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: YOUTH, 16, TO STAND TRIAL AS ADULT IN 
SHOOTINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 16-year-old Long Beach youth charged with shooting two deaf brothers -- 
killing one -- in a fight that began with a "stare-down" at a traffic light 
must stand trial as an adult because of the seriousness of the crime, a judge 
ruled Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena Juvenile Court Judge Sandy Kriegler ruled at the conclusion of a 
three-day fitness hearing during which defense attorney Gerald L. Fogelman 
attempted to prove that Joey Paul Bellinger acted in self-defense when he 
killed Cesar Vieira, 30, and wounded his brother, Edward Vieira, 25, both of 
Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
Teen-agers who were with Bellinger in a Granada Hills parking lot testified 
that he fired the shots as one of the brothers was within striking distance of 
him and the other was charging toward him. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors argued that Bellinger's friends changed their stories to protect 
him. Kriegler concurred after reviewing police interviews with the witnesses.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOL PARCEL TAX FAILS BY 4 VOTES IN 
RECOUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A tax to benefit Beverly Hills schools fell four votes shy of passage, 
according to results of a recount announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The parcel tax measure in the June 5 election collected 6,862 votes, or 66.63%, 
elections officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Votes against the proposal numbered 3,436, or 33.36%. The levy needed approval 
by two-thirds of the voters -- or 6,866 -- to pass. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the tax requested the recount, done by hand, after a computer 
tally last month showed the measure fell five votes shy. 
</P>
<P>
The assessment on each residential and commercial parcel of land in the city 
would have raised $4.5 million a year for the Beverly Hills Unified School 
District. Its failure means teachers lose a 3% pay raise for the coming school 
year, which was negotiated during the teachers' strike last fall but made 
contingent on the tax's passage.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRUSH FIRE CHARS 2 ACRES, INJURES HORSE IN 
BARN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A menacing brush fire charred two acres of grassy hillside in the gated 
community of Rolling Hills Wednesday morning, causing about $3,000 in damage to 
a barn and resulting in a minor injury to a horse. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters surrounded the three-alarm fire just as it was heading toward a 
deep canyon filled with years of dry sagebrush. "If there were wind, God knows 
what could have happened," said Rolling Hills Councilwoman Gordana Swanson. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze was the third fire on the Palos Verdes Peninsula in less than a week, 
and it raised fears among neighbors, Swanson said. Fire officials warned 
homeowners to clear brush up to 200 feet away from their homes.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RTD MAY OFFER 2 WEEKS OF FREE RIDES ON BLUE 
LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Transit officials, eager to attract customers to try the Blue Line light-rail 
system, are considering offering two weeks of free rides when the new trains 
start running Saturday between Long Beach and downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
RTD Board President Nick Patsaouras, who will present the proposal to the 
11-member board today, said suspending the $1.10 fare will encourage ridership. 
</P>
<P>
He said that while the Blue Line could lose up to $100,000 by offering free 
rides for two weeks, it was well worth the investment to promote the rail 
system. 
</P>
<P>
"We have billions riding on this line," Patsaouras said. "We must take extra 
steps to make it safe, keep it graffiti-clean and . . . get people hooked into 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the board had planned to offer free rides for the first two days of 
the Blue Line's operation. Officials have projected between 5,000 and 7,000 
people a day will ride the Blue Line in its initial weeks.

TODAY'S TERMS OF CONFUSION; 
</P>
<P>
HOW CAN THE CITIZENRY BE INFORMED IF JOURNALISTS CAN'T DESCRIBE THE WORLD 
PROPERLY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEXANDER COCKBURN, Alexander Cockburn writes for the Nation and other 
publications. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maybe the reason why the nation's young people are profoundly indifferent to, 
and ignorant about, world affairs -- a finding announced in a recent Times 
Mirror poll -- is because they can't figure out what on Earth anyone's talking 
about. I can't say I blame them. 
</P>
<P>
Take one of the big issues in the world today, namely the future direction of 
the Soviet Union and its Communist Party. Now figure the confusion of the 
aforementioned young people as they furrow their brows over the news reports. 
</P>
<P>
They'll come across the word "radicals" somewhere in the first few paragraphs 
of any story datelined Moscow. Now, in this country the word radical usually 
denotes someone or something on the left, unless carefully glossed with the 
qualifier "right-wing." 
</P>
<P>
But the people this word radical is applied to in the Soviet Union wouldn't 
look out of place on the Republican National Committee. They believe profoundly 
in the teachings of Milton Friedman, laureate of tooth-and-claw capitalism. 
They believe that the market will fix anything. When you tell them that there 
are anywhere from 75,000 to 100,000 homeless in the streets of New York, they 
refuse to believe you. 
</P>
<P>
Not so long ago Bill Keller of the New York Times quoted Pyotr S. Filipov of 
"the boisterously reformist Leningrad City Council." Filipov announced that he 
agreed "with those who say we must hurry quickly away from Marxism-Leninism, 
through socialism, to Reaganism." Call this sort of posture "conservative" or 
call it "neo-liberal." But don't call it "radical" or "reformist" because it 
isn't. Would Keller have called the Reagan gang, when it took over at the start 
of the '80s, "boisterously reformist?" 
</P>
<P>
In those news dispatches from Moscow you also find people called 
"conservatives." On closer inspection, these "conservatives," turn out to favor 
common ownership of the means of production, proletarian internationalism 
abroad and egalitarianism at home. Such characteristics used to belong to 
people known as "socialists" or "revolutionaries." People in the United States 
calling for a planned economy, revolution in the Third World and a lift in the 
top marginal income tax bracket to 80% are not called "conservative." 
</P>
<P>
Moving on through our typical report from Moscow, we usually find the 
description "pro-democracy." This is applied to the privileged elite of 
Friedmanites around Mikhail S. Gorbachev who want capitalism to be imposed on 
the Soviet Union by administrative fiat. They want authoritarian capitalism or 
what Russian socialists (see description of "conservatives" above) called 
"market Stalinism." Call it the South Korean model. Don't call it 
"pro-democracy." 
</P>
<P>
Small wonder that the younger crowd throws the newspaper aside and punches up 
"Entertainment Tonight" on the channel changer. How can you hope for an 
informed citizenry if journalists can't describe the world properly? 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the journalists themselves get confused, which is not surprising when 
they describe policies designed to throw millions of people out of work (the 
Polish "solution") as "market freedoms." In more sensible times, this "freedom" 
was called "market discipline," which is how capitalism thrives, since 
capitalists use the discipline of unemployment or the threat of a runaway shop 
to lower wages and hence raise profits. And of course the Russians themselves 
are absolutely confused since they have adopted the descriptive terminology of 
Western journalists. The other day Pravda, now the house organ of Soviet 
Friedmanite would-be capitalists, hopefully described the country as "moving to 
the left." 
</P>
<P>
Journalists like simple models. The basic battle in reports from the Soviet 
Union is between "radicals" or "reformers" and "Stalinists." As we've seen, the 
former aren't radical and no one in the Soviet Union wants to go back to 
Stalin. In fact almost all the Soviet bureaucratic elite want to inject a 
measure of capitalist relations into the economy. What this elite fears is not 
some mythical "conservative-Stalinist opposition" but Soviet workers who don't 
relish the prospect of a Polish solution. They want full employment. So far as 
I can recall, the authors of the Hawkins-Humphrey bill in this country, seeking 
to legislate full employment as national policy, were not called "conservative" 
or Stalinist. 
</P>
<P>
In this country the journalistic model is of "pragmatists" against 
"ideologues." Pragmatists are people who swear not to raise taxes and then do 
so. Such people used to be called "liars," but that's another story . . . .

KIDS IN WORKPLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Hair stylist SANDRA BEAL rents a booth from the operator of a Long Beach 
salon and keeps her 3-year-old son at work with her for a few hours each day. 
She commented on child care in the workplace: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If I wasn't able to bring my boy here, I would have to find someone to care for 
him. My husband starts work at 3 (p.m.) and my daughter starts her job at 4 
(p.m.), so there is no one at home to take care of him for that period at the 
end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
You can afford to pay for your living arrangements and other things you need, 
but it is hard to squeeze in that money for child care, usually its $50 or $60 
a week. 
</P>
<P>
People do complain. Sometimes the owner complains, because kids get into 
things. But I think all jobs should have a place where kids can be. A lot of 
mothers and fathers and single people just can't afford child care. 
</P>
<P>
I don't think an office should be turned into a nursery: (a landlord who has 
complained about children in an Orange County law office) is right in a way. 
But mostly he's wrong because (those women) are doing what they have to do. If 
they can't do it that way, how can they make a living to take care of the 
child?

ATTITUDES.

<TEXT>
<P>
The progress of individual liberty in the United States has been the progress 
of replacing skin color, ethnicity or gender with accomplishment as the 
touchstone for political or professional success. The nation is now 
retrogressing on that laudatory historical path and promoting community 
enmities. 
</P>
<P>
California's Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Dianne Feinstein, has pledged 
administrative, executive and judicial appointments according to gender, racial 
and ethnic quotas reflecting population percentages: 50% women, 25% Latino, 7% 
black and 7% Asian and other minorities. Feinstein's pledge echoes the voice of 
President Jimmy Carter, who championed the appointment of federal judges based 
on comparable nationwide gender and minority quotas. The Democratic Party rules 
for selecting delegates to national conventions similarly insists on female and 
minority quotas. 
</P>
<P>
The assumptions behind the quotas are both false and pernicious: that women and 
minority groups consist of fungible individuals whose interests, aspirations 
and sympathies are unique and permanently divide them from non-group members; 
that female and minority groups can be satisfactorily represented politically 
only by individuals who share their gender, race or ethnicity, and that such 
ascriptive characteristics are and should be decisive in the electoral process, 
the administration of justice and qualification for government office. 
</P>
<P>
But the diversity of aspirations, interests and viewpoints within female or 
minority groups is enormous and overlaps those of non-group members. For 
instance, women sharply divide over abortion, as do men; the most fervent 
champion of abortion rights on the Supreme Court is Justice Harry Blackmun, 
whereas a strong critic is Justice Sandra Day O'Conner. Sens. Edward M. Kennedy 
(D-Mass.) and Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) are enthusiasts for gender and 
minority preferences in employment or contracting; opposing views are held by 
scholars Thomas Sowell and Walter Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Blacks and whites divide over desegregation of traditionally black colleges, 
court-ordered busing, drug legalization, the lyrics of 2 Live Crew and 
countless other issues. 
</P>
<P>
The happenstance of a shared sex, racial, or ethnic status is neither necessary 
nor sufficient to the fair representation of individuals within those groups. 
Indeed, the contrary notion is absurd. Are whites not fairly represented in Los 
Angeles because Tom Bradley is the mayor? Are female judges incapable of fairly 
presiding over a criminal trial of a male defendant? Would the election of 
Dianne Feinstein leave California's males unfairly under-represented? It 
denigrates and stunts every individual's distinct personality, hopes and 
attitudes to suggest that all are the inevitable proxy of the congenital 
accident of sex, race or ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
To reduce invidious stereotyping and prejudices, laws and practices should 
teach that such characteristics are no more important in appraising individuals 
than are their shoe sizes. Thus, laws should strictly proscribe the use of 
race, ethnicity or gender in political, economic or educational 
decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
No ascriptive characteristics deserve any consideration in medicine, law, 
teaching, professional sports or other lines of employment. That is a major 
reason why the Supreme Court in 1964 held unconstitutional racial designations 
of candidates on ballots. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Voting Rights Act now encourages racial bloc voting and demands that 
district boundary lines be drawn to ensure a proportional representation of 
minorities in legislative bodies and elected judgeships. Scores of states and 
municipalities dictate racial and gender quotas in public employment and 
contracting that shower advantages on individuals never victimized by 
discrimination. Federal civil-rights laws smile on racial and gender 
preferences in both employment and education and, at present, Congress is 
edging toward employment quotas. Also, the Supreme Court fueled racial 
stereotyping last month by endorsing minority preferences in broadcasting to 
promote "minority viewpoints," a concept that degrades minorities as fungible 
and defies definition. 
</P>
<P>
Racist and sexist enmities are never alleviated by practicing racism or sexism. 
Indeed, the practices foster antagonisms and the types of interracial crimes 
recently witnessed in Howard Beach, Bensonhurst and New York's Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
The animosities scourging nations split by gender and ethnic prejudices -- 
South Africa or Romania, for example -- should daunt the United States from its 
wrongheaded civil-rights course.

LANGSTON FALLS, 2-1, AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SEATTLE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He has seized the word baffled as though it were a life preserver, a connection 
to a rational world in which good efforts bring good results. 
</P>
<P>
Still, when he analyzed his performance Wednesday, Mark Langston knew he 
couldn't blame a lack of support for his 2-1 loss to the Mariners in the 
Kingdome. Nor could he point to the unfairness of the Angels having to travel 
to Seattle three times to make up three games lost to the spring-training 
lockout, an injustice Seattle Manager Jim Lefebvre acknowledged after his club 
had swept the spread-out series. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, those were factors, but Wednesday's game came down to Langston's own 
faltering in the seventh inning. That's when the Mariners scored the 
game-winning run on two walks, a hit batsman and a fielder's choice grounder to 
spoil the 29-year-old left-hander's return to the stadium he once called home 
in the city in which he still owns a home. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to look to myself," Langston said after his record fell to 4-10, 
including three losses by 2-1 scores. "I'm frustrated with the results. All I 
can do is go out and give my best. I'm very positive going into the second 
half. I'm not going to let the first half get to me. Obviously, tonight I 
couldn't turn it around." 
</P>
<P>
His loss Wednesday was an echo of so many he absorbed in the first half. In 
addition to his three 2-1 defeats, he also took a 2-0 loss and started a game 
the Angels lost, 2-1, although the score was 1-1 when he left. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the results aren't what I want. I'm a little baffled," he said 
after losing for the seventh time in his past 11 starts. 
</P>
<P>
Again, Manager Doug Rader maintained that Langston "pitched well enough to 
win," and a four-walk, four-strikeout, five-hit effort over eight innings 
should be sufficient. Lefebvre agreed. "He pitched a heck of a game coming back 
here, so this is a good win for us," said Lefebvre, whose club has won nine of 
its last 12 games. "Mark's a great pitcher, but our guy (Erik Hanson) was just 
a little bit better." 
</P>
<P>
That little bit meant the difference. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson (10-6) held the Angels to four hits and struck out eight in 7 1/3 
innings, yielding their only run in the second inning on a walk to Chili Davis, 
a single by Lance Parrish and Dante Bichette's sacrifice fly. "It was a 
pitching duel tonight and we came up short," Bichette said. "Sure, it's not 
easy to come up here three times, but you've got to do it. You've got to lock 
in and get ready to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Parrish, who had an even tougher road because he played in Tuesday's All-Star 
Game at Chicago, didn't use travel as an excuse. "It actually isn't that tough, 
just a little inconvenient," he said. "Mark has pitched very well. We can't 
seem to score runs for him. The bottom line is that we're not a very good 
offensive ballclub, and Mark's just getting stuck with our worst performances. 
Until we start doing better, the whole team is going to suffer, and that's just 
the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
Seattle scored its first run in the third inning on Harold Reynolds' single and 
stolen base and Ken Griffey Jr.'s double to right-center. "That one run was a 
pitch I shouldn't have thrown him, good young hitter that he is," said 
Langston, who had intended to get the pitch farther inside. 
</P>
<P>
And Langston knew he shouldn't have fallen behind in the seventh inning to Pete 
O'Brien, whom he walked; or hit David Valle when Valle squared to bunt. Omar 
Vizquel sacrificed to put both runners in scoring position, and, after Reynolds 
walked, O'Brien scored when Henry Cotto's grounder to the right side became a 
force play and not a double play. Second baseman Johnny Ray played the ball and 
flipped it to shortstop Dick Schofield, who slipped before Reynolds came in. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Cotto) didn't hit it hard and he runs pretty good, so you don't know if 
there's a way to get the double play," Schofield said. "It's just too bad. Mark 
has pitched too good for whatever his record is. There's about seven or eight 
games we scored a total of 10 runs and his record could easily be reversed. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming up here is tough, but you've got to do it. There's no sense groaning 
and moaning. This one, more than any of them, could have been (made up as) a 
doubleheader in July. If we would have won, it would have been great. When you 
lose, you try to make excuses, and there aren't any." 
</P>
<P>
Langston offered reasons, not excuses: "Omar laid down a good bunt. Then, I was 
looking for a ground ball and got it (by Cotto), but he hit it off the end of 
the bat and Henry can run. They don't call him 'Turbo' for nothing. . . 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is wins. The results are still not there, but I'm not going to 
let it get to me. I'm still going to work hard and stay as positive as I can." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Angel catcher Lance Parrish was still running on adrenaline Wednesday after 
scoring the second run in the AL All-Stars' 2-0 victory over the NL. Parrish 
caught an early flight to Seattle and was in the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really that tired. I do feel like I just took this stuff (his uniform 
and equipment) off a little while ago," said Parrish, who singled and scored on 
Julio Franco's double. "It was fun and I really enjoyed it. I'm sure the fans 
were looking for a little more excitement, and it wasn't fun to watch on TV, 
but it was fun to be part of it." 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Finley, who pitched the eighth inning Tuesday, skipped Wednesday's game 
and flew from Chicago to California. Kirk McCaskill also was excused Wednesday. 
He's scheduled to pitch tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Bryan Harvey was back after going to North Carolina to be with his 
father, Stan, who had a heart attack July 5. . . . Infielder Rick Schu, who was 
hampered by a muscle strain in his upper back before the break, is healthy 
again. Infielder Mark McLemore continues to receive therapy for his sprained 
right wrist and is hitting and throwing on alternate days. However, he's not 
close to returning. . . . Pitcher Bob McClure (sore left elbow) is long-tossing 
but no timetable has been established for his return.

<TEXT>
<P>
Greg LeMond's strength in the mountains was evident in the 11th stage of the 
Tour de France Wednesday, but most attention was focused on his Z teammate, 
Ronan Pensec of France. 
</P>
<P>
Pensec's surprising performance in the most difficult of the Tour's 21 stages 
might be enough to lead him to his first championship. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond finished second to Gianni Bugno of Italy in a dramatic sprint at the 
summit of l'Alpe d'Huez. Both riders finished the 114-mile stage in 5 hours 37 
minutes 51 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
But Pensec, who became the race's overall leader Tuesday, lost only 48 seconds 
to LeMond by finishing 10th. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if such a finish will lead to victory, Pensec said: "Maybe. But there's 
still the time trial tomorrow. After that we will see." 
</P>
<P>
LeMond, who moved into third place overall, 9:04 behind Pensec, hoped to narrow 
the deficit by much more. 
</P>
<P>
Today's 21-mile individual time trial in the mountains from Fontaine to 
Villard-de-Lans could determine LeMond's fate. 
</P>
<P>
"If Pensec doesn't lose much time in the trial, then it will be too much for 
LeMond to make up," said George Taylor, a New York cycling expert. "LeMond has 
to wait until Pensec falls apart, which is very unlikely. Since both are on the 
same team, LeMond would not be given the permission to attack on his own." 
</P>
<P>
LeMond admitted his chances have been lessened. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very surprised by Pensec," he said. "I didn't think he would be so 
close. I will just be helping him win the Tour from now on. I'm the backup if 
things go wrong." 
</P>
<P>
LeMond launched into the final sprint and appeared to have it won until Bugno 
counterattacked in the final yards. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond, who hurt his wrist when he fell at a food station earlier in the day, 
had difficulty preparing for the final sprint. 
</P>
<P>
"I had trouble braking and I went wide around the final curve," said LeMond, 
who won the Tour in 1986 and 1989. "That may have cost me the stage." 
</P>
<P>
LeMond was leading when he almost went into a barrier going into the final 
straightaway. Although he stayed ahead of Bugno for the moment, he lost 
momentum and Bugno came on at the finish. 
</P>
<P>
The hopes of one race favorite -- Raul Alcala of Mexico -- were dashed when he 
lost 5:41 on the leaders to drop to eighth overall, 11:55 behind. 
</P>
<P>
Pensec's closest challenger is Claudio Chiapucci of Italy, 1:28 behind. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Bauer of Canada, Tour leader for the first 10 days, dropped to 32nd 
overall, 22:18 back. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Hampsten of Boulder, Colo., moved from 26th to ninth overall by finishing 
seventh.

The Lakers want Akeem Olajuwon. If Patrick Ewing or David Robinson isn't the 
best center in basketball, then Olajuwon is. And he isn't enamored of Houston. 
But the Rockets, who have been made offers by other teams, apparently would 
settle for nothing less from the Lakers than a big package including James 
Worthy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
With Olajuwon at center and Magic Johnson at guard, would it really matter that 
much who played the other positions? . . . 
</P>
<P>
I enjoyed "Rescue 911" on CBS Tuesday night, but the fill-in programming before 
and after left me cold. . . . 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the American League's recent dominance in the All-Star game is 
that it has had a bigger talent pool than the National since expanding to 14 
teams in 1977. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Jose Canseco packs more excitement into a strikeout than any batter since 
Reggie Jackson. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Forget the raindrops. It was the lights that didn't seem right at Wrigley 
Field. . . . 
</P>
<P>
That game face must be pasted onto Tony LaRussa. . . . 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis' gain will be California's loss if Joe Torre leaves the Angel 
broadcasting booth to become Cardinal manager. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Mike Scott, who has grown stale in Houston, would be a terrific pickup for some 
pennant contender. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Look for more than a couple of NFL rookies to hold out now that linebacker 
Keith McCants, the fourth player taken in the draft, has signed a five-year, 
$7.4-million contract with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. And just imagine how much 
money McCants would have gotten if he hadn't lifted weights like a 258-pound 
weakling at the NFL combine's camp. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The New York Jets are being second-guessed for picking Rob Moore in the 
supplemental draft and giving up a first-round choice next year. The wide 
receiver from Syracuse is not a great runner with the ball after he catches it 
and doesn't return kicks. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Among those expected to go high in the 1991 draft are Miami defensive tackle 
Russell Maryland, LSU running back Harvey Williams, Colorado running back Eric 
Bieniemy, Florida linebacker Huey Richardson and Michigan defensive back Tripp 
Welbourne. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Look-alikes: Wade Boggs and Robin Williams. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Nevada Las Vegas center David Butler, who had been contacted by eight teams -- 
including the Lakers -- after not being drafted, has reported to the Seattle 
SuperSonics' rookie camp. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Mike Ornstein, who spent 14 years in the Raider organization before leaving 
last year, has been named director of club marketing by NFL Properties. 
Ornstein is best known to national television audiences as the guy who pushed 
CBS' Irv Cross out of the way on the sidelines during Super Bowl XVIII in 
Tampa. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers, who have had nearly as many publicists as coaches, are looking 
for another following the departure of Bill Kreifeldt. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I'm rooting for a nice lady named Nancy Lopez to win her first U.S. Women's 
Open. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Maybe people don't remember All-Star baseball game results as well as I thought 
they did. Twice on TV, Jack Armstrong, the National League starting pitcher, 
said the NL had lost three consecutive times before Tuesday night. It was only 
two, but nobody bothered to correct him. . . . 
</P>
<P>
You would think Trader Phil Esposito was still on the job, the way General 
Manager Neil Smith of the New York Rangers has been making deals lately. . . . 
</P>
<P>
News item: Mario Lemieux undergoes "successful" surgery on his back. Reaction: 
That extends the streak of successful surgeries performed on athletes to 
12,345. . . .

Has Maradona scored yet? . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Jim Murray Handicap, to be run for the first time Friday night at Hollywood 
Park, will replace one of the track's traditional graded stakes next year and 
become a fixture of the summer meeting. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The three Friday night cards in Inglewood have averaged 23,000 in attendance, 
nearly double the 12,000 average for eight Friday afternoon cards. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Highest weight assigned by Hollywood Park racing secretary Eual Wyatt all 
meeting is the 128 pounds that Bayakoa, a 5-year-old mare, will carry in the 
Vanity Handicap Sunday. The 1989 Kentucky Derby winner, Sunday Silence, was 
assigned two pounds less in the Gold Cup. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Olympic team now has an official pain relief sponsor. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Estel Johnson, who died Sunday at 77, was head track and field coach at 
Jefferson High School during the glory days of the sport in the Los Angeles 
school system. One reason the Coliseum Relays used to draw huge crowds was that 
it was held in conjunction with the City meet. And no matter how prestigious 
the open events, the kids' eight-man mile relay always stole the show. "And 
here come the Jefferson Democrats!" the public address announcer would scream.

<P>
Team Joyner-Kersee held a news conference Wednesday. That's Jackie Joyner and 
Bob Kersee. Wife and husband. Athlete and coach. Business and manager. Left 
hand and right hand. 
</P>
<P>
What's in a hyphen? With Joyner and Kersee, almost too much. When Jackie 
Joyner-Kersee talks, Bob Kersee not only listens, he interrupts, interjects, 
interprets, extrapolates, underscores and, often, overrides. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Olympic Festival was the reason for this latest exercise in 
point-counterpoint. Consider it Jackie's personal Goodwill Games. Starved for 
name athletes because Ted Turner's millions have lured most of them to Seattle 
later this month, the festival was looking none too festive before Jackie 
agreed to drop by and run a few relays, which Jackie ordinarily doesn't run. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, she's here doing charity work. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm here not so much to compete in an event as to lend my name and notoriety 
to the Olympic Festival," Jackie said, not immodestly. "I was in the 1981, '85 
and '86 festivals and I received a lot of publicity when I was considered a 
nobody. I think it's important to uplight the Olympic Festival. That's why I'm 
here. 
</P>
<P>
"It is developmental. If it needs help, and if I can help it, I'm here." 
</P>
<P>
Bob, as always, had something to say about this. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of athletes would rather go to Europe than come to the festival," he 
said. "If Jackie was in Europe, she'd be making a pretty penny, too. 
</P>
<P>
"But if you're going to support track and field, it's not based on money all 
the time. . . . It doesn't matter who you are -- men or women athletes can find 
a way to support the Olympic Festival." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, support comes easier when you're bound to a McDonald's endorsement 
contract and McDonald's has just poured loads of money into the Olympic 
Festival. McDonald's to Jackie: Minneapolis is your kind of place . . . isn't 
it? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure they did want her here," Bob said with a laugh. "But McDonald's 
didn't put any pressure on her." 
</P>
<P>
No. Just the golden arches logo on her back as Jackie took a lap inside the 
Metrodome and lit the Olympic Festival flame during last Friday's opening 
ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie, the world record-holder in the heptathlon, isn't competing in that 
event here. But she will in two weeks in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good tuneup meet," Bob said. Jackie instead will run in the 
100-meter and 400-meter relays and is entered in the high jump and javelin 
throw -- but only as an "exhibition" entrant. 
</P>
<P>
"If I want to go for 7,300 (heptathlon points) at the Goodwill Games, I'm going 
to need the high jump and the javelin to be on." 
</P>
<P>
And Jackie is going for 7,300. Bob has decided so. Jackie currently holds the 
world record at 7,291 points, but Bob said: "If we're going to break it, I 
don't want to break it with 7,292. We're shooting for 7,300 points. That's the 
ultimate goal. I'd like to see her break that barrier." 
</P>
<P>
Bob has placed 7,300 points upon the pedestal because he's been dissatisfied 
with Jackie's efforts in recent meets. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it was around February that Jackie began to get a little spoiled," he 
said. "She'd be getting six second(-place finishes), seven thirds, collecting 
her money -- and not giving me my coaching fee." 
</P>
<P>
Jackie laughed. 
</P>
<P>
"The last couple of months, I've been doing most of the cooking at home," Bob 
continued. "Jackie's been mad because I've been on her pretty hard. 
</P>
<P>
"Jackie needs motivation. Back in '88, she had goals. She wanted to set the 
world record, she wanted to win the gold medal. Now, we've accomplished those 
goals, and she's chasing her own record. You look at 7,300 points and think how 
difficult 7,100 was and how difficult 7,200 was, but once those goals are 
achieved, you have to redo them. 
</P>
<P>
"Jackie's motivated and wants to stay in the sport, but at times she complains 
at practice how the coaches and everybody else is bringing her down. All I know 
is that in '86 and '87, she'd never take off to go to the Miss USA Pageant." 
</P>
<P>
Jackie reached over and punched Bob in the arm. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Bobby is right about 50% of the time," Jackie said. 
</P>
<P>
Bob pressed onward, if not his luck. 
</P>
<P>
"Coaching Jackie, nothing surprises me," he said. "She can look shabby one week 
and still come out OK. . . . At Azusa this year, Jackie played around and still 
scored 6,700 points. She was ready to high jump well -- and she pulled up. She 
was ready for a fast 200 (meters) -- and she came out of the curve looking like 
me. 
</P>
<P>
"I watched her long-jump at the nationals, running into a headwind on a poor 
surface, and she did seven meters three times. If half of that wind had been 
behind her, she'd have gone 7.30, 7.40, easy. 
</P>
<P>
"If she worked on the long jump as hard as she does the heptathlon, she could 
be the first woman to go 25 feet. I'd hate to see her retire from the 
heptathlon, but if she focused on the long jump and maybe two hurdles, Lord 
knows what she'd be capable of." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, a reporter was able to get a word in edgewise. 
</P>
<P>
Question: How many more years does Jackie want to compete? 
</P>
<P>
Jackie: "All my life . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Bob: "That's probably true." 
</P>
<P>
Jackie: "Actually, at one time, we were talking about going through '92, early 
'93. But for now I'm leaving it open." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, what would Bob ever do if Jackie retired?

Scott Schulte's ninth U.S. Olympic Festival ended just like the other eight -- 
without a gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
Schulte, a water polo player from Mahwah, N.J., came away with a silver medal 
Wednesday when the West beat the East, 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
He has now attended nine festivals without winning it all. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably now I'm coming back," said Schulte, an investment broker who has five 
silver medals and four bronze medals. "Right now I'd say yes. If you ask me in 
three months, the answer might be different."

In boxing, U.S. champion Steve Johnston of Denver lost a 4-1 decision to Ronald 
Wright of St. Petersburg, Fla., in the 139-pound match. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, who has only been fighting for two years -- nine fewer than Johnston -- 
had lost to Johnston in the semifinals of this past winter's championships. 
</P>
<P>
"I came down with the flu (at the championships) and didn't dance around like I 
did tonight," Wright said. "I told him I'd get him back." 
</P>
<P>
Two controversial 3-2 decisions elicited boos from the crowd at the St. Paul 
Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
Jaime Lerma of Waco, Tex., lost to Patrick Byrd of Flint, Mich., at 147 pounds 
even though he dominated the third round. And at 112 pounds, 16-year-old Juan 
Delgado of Ft. Worth, Tex., appeared to have the upper hand but lost to Marcel 
Brown of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Delgado, whose uncle, Ricardo Delgado, won the 112-pound gold medal at the 1968 
Olympics in Mexico City, was so upset that tears welled up in his eyes and he 
could barely speak.

<P>
Heavyweight James Johnson of Lawrence, Mass., beat Randal Crippen of Stanford,

Promoter Don King's credibility was attacked in a New York federal court

<P>
King contends he was in the process of setting up a rematch when he called for 
justice after Buster Douglas upset undisputed heavyweight champion Mike Tyson 
in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
If he was setting up a rematch, why did he did deny it at a Feb. 13 news 
conference in New York, King was asked.

<P>
"That was something I told the press," King said. 
</P>

"You lied to the press?" asked Stanley Hunterton, attorney for Douglas and 
manager John Johnson.

"Yes," replied King, who is suing Douglas and Johnson for breach of contract 
and the Mirage hotel in Las Vegas for allegedly inducing Douglas to break his 
promotional contract with King.

"On today, the 11th, you're telling the truth," Hunterton asked.

NEWSWIRE: BUCCANEERS SIGN MCCANTS TO $7.4-MILLION DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Keith McCants, the fourth player selected in this year's college football 
draft, signed a five-year contract Wednesday with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
Terms were not disclosed, but the Mobile (Ala.) 
</P>
<P>
Press-Register reported that the former Alabama star will receive $7.4 million, 
including a $2.5-million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Luchnick, McCants' attorney, described the deal as "fair and equitable 
for both sides." He said talks with Buccaneer administrator Phil Krueger 
escalated this week after McCants told him he wouldn't be satisfied to merely 
sign before the Tampa Bay open training camp on July 20. 
</P>
<P>
McCants, who left Alabama after his junior year, was considered the top 
prospect in the draft before some teams raised questions about the soundness of 
his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
He underwent arthroscopic surgery two days after the draft and has been working 
out in Tampa the past two months.

tickets and a job while he was playing for the Miners in 1989, the El Paso 
Times reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney McKoy told the newspaper that the booster, Mike Daeuble, owner of a 
downtown El Paso restaurant, gave him a round-trip ticket to Philadelphia in 
March 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The ticket cost $338, McKoy said. The gift would be a violation of NCAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
McKoy and former players Chris Perez and Terry Stallworth also say they often 
received free food at a fast-food restaurant near the university owned by 
booster Ruben Montelongo. 
</P>
<P>
McKoy, 22, was among 75 people interviewed during the NCAA's seven-month 
investigation into possible rule violations by the UTEP basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
McKoy's allegations come just two weeks after former UTEP recruit John Staggers 
said he received free housing, meals and transportation from UTEP coaches in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Neither UTEP Coach Don Haskins nor Athletic Director Brad Hovious could be 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
McKoy also claims he worked in Daeuble's home garden for cash during the 
basketball season.

The NCAA is investigating allegations that a University of Missouri basketball 
coach "provided false and misleading information" during an ongoing 
investigation at the school, that a representative of the school's athletic 
interests on two occasions paid for lodging of the mother of a Missouri 
basketball player, and that members of the coaching staff provided local 
transportation for her, Chancellor Haskell Monroe said.

YANKEE FAN'S LAMENT: OWNER'S IDENTITY SUPERSEDES THE CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Being a Yankee fan these days, it seems, means always having to say you're 
sorry. 
</P>
<P>
Damn sorry. 
</P>
<P>
The once-proud franchise's descent into the cellar of the American League East 
is, of course, only the latest chapter in this long saga of shipbuilder George 
Steinbrenner's misguided navigation. 
</P>
<P>
Stump Merrill's sentencing as manager-of-the-month proves only that fans need a 
scorecard to tell who's in charge in the dugout. Will Bucky Dent return? Do we 
really care? The Yankee manager's office produces more sequels than Hollywood 
-- and with even less redeeming value. 
</P>
<P>
"Who Killed the Yankees?" can hardly compete with Laura Palmer's demise as a 
national mystery. General George's San Andreas-like faults were evident from 
Day 1. Even though he initially brought winning back to the stadium -- along 
with Reggie Jackson, Catfish Hunter and Tommy John -- it was hard to avert our 
eyes. 
</P>
<P>
But now, going on nine years without so much as a division championship, and 
with no prospect of participation in a pennant race in the foreseeable future, 
his team's futility on the field matches his offensiveness off it. 
</P>
<P>
No buck-passing by the boss can take his fingerprints off a mind-boggling 
series of giveaways that have robbed the team of its competitiveness and its 
fans of the annual arrival of spring's hope. 
</P>
<P>
Remember Rickey Henderson for Luis Polonia, Greg Cadaret and Eric Plunk? Or 
Jack Clark for Jimmy Jones, Lance McCullers and Stanley Jefferson? Half of 
these guys are already gone, and the rest would hardly be missed. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner's nautical empire for a run? This club doesn't have the firepower 
to launch a dinghy. 
</P>
<P>
As a veteran of 26 years following the team's peaks and Death Valley -- from 
outposts as far removed as Los Angeles, no less -- I suspect I speak for 
legions of Yankee loyalists who have finally turned the corner into 
no-fans-land this year. 
</P>
<P>
Can it be, we ask ourselves, that we have begun to take private delight in the 
team's demise? That each daily failure of the best that George's revolving door 
can field is a source of secret satisfaction rather than despair? 
</P>
<P>
How many of us deny engaging, at least occasionally, in a Sunday ritual of 
checking the statistics of high-flying former pinstripers? Show him, Dave 
Winfield. Even Ron Kittle is flourishing elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
It used to be depressing; we felt as though we'd let these players get away. 
Now, however, their success prompts gloating. 
</P>
<P>
These Bronx castaways would be lifesavers compared to the current crew of 
retreads and untrieds. 
</P>
<P>
Remember when Steinbrenner apologized to New York for the Yankees' failure to 
beat the Dodgers in the 1981 World Series? Since then, he's had nothing 
comparable for which to say he's sorry. Will he apologize for blowing the 
chance even to apologize? 
</P>
<P>
Don't hold your breath. The man is as likely to accept responsibility as he is 
to employ one manager for an entire season. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line -- beyond the club's place in the standings -- is that the 
Yankees are no longer a team of 24 athletes whose daily triumphs and travails 
are cause for comfort or concern through the days of summer. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from Don Mattingly, Dave Righetti and Steve Sax (each of whom deserves 
better), how many of the current crew can most fans relate to as more than a 
name and a disappointment? 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, they might as well call the club the New York Steinbrenners, so much 
has its identity fused with that of its bigger-than-life owner. 
</P>
<P>
That is the way the franchise is viewed by much-desired free agents, who 
negotiate with George only to increase their market value. What a reversal from 
the days when players wanted to be part of the Yankees, whether for love of the 
lore or for the lure of the money. 
</P>
<P>
A friend and fellow Yankee sufferer recently found himself walking beside 
Steinbrenner in a building with steep ledges. He confesses that he was tempted 
to execute a different kind of hit-and-run. 
</P>
<P>
I did it for the good of the team, he might have alibied. He wasn't delivering. 
The chemistry wasn't right. We couldn't fire the players, he could have pleaded 
in perfect sports cliche. 
</P>
<P>
Is this what it has come down to as a Yankee fan? From reveries of Mantle's 
glory and Reggie's heroics and Guidry's brilliance to vengeful fantasies of 
ejecting an owner whose identity has virtually swallowed that of the team? 
</P>
<P>
Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio, indeed? 
</P>
<P>
I never thought I'd bring my fingers to bang out these words: Let's go Brewers. 
And Blue Jays. And even Bosox. Steinbrenners be damned.

An organ grinder and his monkey made their rounds through Comiskey Park in 
Chicago. A barbershop quartet harmonized in the corridor. 
</P>
<P>
Popcorn sold for a nickel and general admission seats were 50 cents. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago White Sox, who are leaving venerable Comiskey Park after this 
season for a newer model across the street, turned back the clock on Wednesday 
in a 12-9, 13-inning setback to the Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the White Sox probably could have used Ed Cicotte and 
"Shoeless Joe" Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Darryl Hamilton singled home the tiebreaking run in the 13th and Jim Gantner 
singled home two insurance runs as the Brewers, who trailed, 9-3, after seven 
innings, notched their first extra-inning victory in seven games. It was the 
third consecutive defeat for the White Sox, who fell two games behind Oakland 
in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 11, Minnesota 7 -- Jose Canseco had three hits, including his 23rd home 
run, and drove in three runs as the Athletics downed the Twins at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco, who has had back and wrist injuries, doubled to drive in a run in the 
first inning, singled in the third and hit a 435-foot, two-run homer to center 
in the A's five-run fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Sanderson (10-5) pitched 5 1/3 innings and Dennis Eckersley got the last 
out for his 26th save after the Twins scored four runs in the ninth against 
Rick Honeycutt and Todd Burns. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 7, Kansas City 5 -- Joe Orsulak singled home the tie-breaking run in 
the seventh inning as the Orioles rallied to beat the Royals at Baltimore for 
their third consecutive victory. 
</P>

The Orioles, who trailed, 5-2, after three innings, hadn't won three in a row 
since June 6-9.

<P>
The World Series champion Athletics are considering a plan to leave Oakland if 
the city succeeds in wooing the Raiders back to the San Francisco Bay area. 
</P>
<P>
The A's want the right to leave after the 1995 season if the city gets the 
Raiders back, according to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
The A's also requested a package of rent concessions and loan deferrals that 
would cost the city and Alameda County about $1.5 million per year if Oakland's 
latest return-the-Raiders plan works. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed changes in the lease would be in addition to a series of lease 
improvements, valued at about another $1 million per year, that the A's 
obtained from the city in May. 
</P>
<P>
A's President Wally Haas said Tuesday that the team wanted the new package 
because the club could suffer considerable financial losses competing for fans 
with the Raiders.

KINGS ADD A NEW MINOR LEAGUE TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Kings announced Wednesday that they will have a full working agreement next 
season with the Phoenix Roadrunners of the International Hockey League, but 
still will keep their American Hockey League affiliate in New Haven, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings recently signed a three-year extension with New Haven after plans to 
sell the Knighthawks to a Connecticut businessman fell through. 
</P>
<P>
"We will operate two full minor league teams this year," General Manager Rogie 
Vachon said. "It's unusual, but we think we can do it." 
</P>
<P>
"We feel Phoenix is perfect for the Kings. We're only an hour away if we need a 
player. It takes almost a day to recall a player from New Haven. It would be 
very easy to bring up a guy from Phoenix and he could play for you that night." 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix, an IHL expansion team operating as an independent last season, had 
partial NHL affiliations with the Kings, Edmonton Oilers and Buffalo Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
In another move, the Kings named former NHL defenseman Nick Beverley assistant 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Beverley, who played with the Boston Bruins, New York Rangers, Minnesota North 
Stars and Kings in the 1970s, was the club's director of player personnel the 
last two years. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings also signed forwards Mike Allison and Chris Kontos, and goaltender 
Mario Gosselin to termination contracts, meaning they will become free agents 
after next season.

<P>
DIPLOMACY: BUSH WINS AGREEMENT TO PUSH FOR AN END TO THE STALEMATE ON 
AGRICULTURE. THE PRESIDENT ALSO ATTACKS ENVIRONMENTAL CRITICS AS 'EXTREMISTS.'

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush on Wednesday won a pledge from leaders of the major industrial 
democracies to end a longstanding deadlock on trade negotiations that U.S. 
officials had feared could plunge the world economy into chaos and recession. 
</P>
<P>
In a final communique ending the three-day economic summit, the leaders 
declared that the successful outcome of the current trade talks, known as the 
Uruguay Round, "has the highest priority on the international economic agenda." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials concede that reaching agreement on the specific elements of the 
broad trade pact remains a towering challenge, but they insisted it would have 
been hopeless without the priority-setting summit declaration. 
</P>
<P>
"We had an impasse," U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hills said. But with 
the summit statement, she said, trade officials are now under orders to deal 
with issues that the Europeans previously "were not willing to touch with a 
10-foot pole." 
</P>
<P>
The key to breaking the overall stalemate on removing trade barriers is getting 
agreement on reducing the array of subsidies and protective measures enjoyed by 
farmers throughout the world. Although European and Japanese leaders were -- 
and remain -- reluctant to deal with the issue, Bush argued successfully that 
the subject must be addressed if world trade is to grow and an economic crisis 
avoided. 
</P>
<P>
"The world looks to these summits for a lead on the larger issues," British 
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said. "I believe we have once again provided 
that lead." 
</P>
<P>
On the sensitive environmental issue of global warming, meanwhile, the Bush 
Administration succeeded in deflecting a bid by European leaders to commit the 
seven major industrial nations to making substantial cutbacks in emissions of 
the so-called greenhouse gases believed responsible for the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they made only a bland commitment on environmental issues, proposing a 
new program suggested by West German Helmut Kohl to support Brazil and other 
tropical nations in saving rain forests and beginning efforts to draft a new 
international treaty to protect forests worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration contended that stronger action now could endanger economic 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
Aware, however, that his action would draw a torrent of criticism from 
environmental groups, Bush used a news conference after release of the final 
summit communique to deliver a scathing attack on such critics. 
</P>
<P>
"Extremists" in the environmental movement, he said, "don't want this country 
to grow. . . . They don't want to look at the human consequences" of the 
protections they seek. 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Club, the Wilderness Society, the Environmental Defense Fund and the 
Audubon Society were among the prominent environmental groups that accused Bush 
and other summit leaders of not coming to grips with the global warming 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Club charged that Bush and Kohl, who sided with the President, made 
a "back-room . . . dirty deal" by agreeing to downplay the need for immediate 
action. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental activists had hoped the summit would produce a strong statement 
pledging the seven countries to specific reductions in emissions of carbon 
dioxide and other greenhouse gases. They argue that such reductions can be 
achieved largely by improving energy efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
The emissions are blamed for an apparent slow but ominous warming of the global 
climate that has been found by several scientific studies. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush and his aides, led by Chief of Staff John H. Sununu, came here 
dead-set against any such pledge. The main source of man-made carbon dioxide 
emissions is the burning of coal, oil, natural gas, wood and other carbon-based 
fuels for energy. Any limits on emissions would stifle U.S. economic growth, 
Bush and Sununu believe. 
</P>
<P>
Bush aides called the new proposal the President's chief environmental 
initiative for the summit, and several environmental activists here initially 
called it a hopeful sign. But at his news conference, Bush quickly dampened 
their enthusiasm for the idea, saying that his commitment to negotiate 
international forest protections would not affect his policies toward forests 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has deferred action on protecting the remaining virgin 
forests in the Pacific Northwest out of concern for jobs in the timber 
industry, and Bush said he has no plans to change that policy. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why environmentalists are so opposed to some of his policies despite his 
campaign pledge to be an "environmental President," Bush said: "We cannot 
govern by listening to the loudest voice on the extreme. I'm not going to be 
persuaded that I can get some brownie point by appealing to one of these 
groups. . . . And the attacks that they made on some of my summit partners -- I 
resent them, too." 
</P>
<P>
The economic summit annually brings together leaders from the seven largest 
industrial democracies -- the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, 
Britain, Italy and Canada -- and also now includes the head of the 12-nation 
European Community. They plan to meet next year in London. 
</P>
<P>
Bush singled out West Germany's Kohl for special thanks in helping to forge 
compromises on several key areas, but he downplayed suggestions the two of them 
had cut any sort of private deal. 
</P>
<P>
"The Germans appreciate the fact that we have stood at their side on this 
question of German reunification," Bush said. "But there isn't any quid pro 
quo." 
</P>
<P>
On the politically charged trade issue, the seven leaders agreed Wednesday to 
provide stronger support from the top for the current talks in Geneva, which 
had threatened to break down as a result of the nasty dispute between the 
United States and Europe over agricultural subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
The summit leaders issued specific instructions to their bargainers aimed at 
achieving a successful conclusion to the talks by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"We all know that agriculture has been a major stumbling block," Bush told 
reporters. "What we're trying to do is move the whole thing forward." 
</P>
<P>
Bush acknowledged that any agreement to cut agricultural subsidies would 
involve some sacrifice on the part of U.S. farmers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a two-way street," Bush said. "I expect there would be some political 
opposition because, like many of these countries, we protect. But I am 
convinced . . . if we all reduce barriers and we all make a freer trading 
system, that the United States can compete." 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture was the most contentious issue that the summit leaders discussed at 
Rice University, with the final compromise achieved after hours of predawn 
bargaining among lower-level negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
Although U.S. officials embraced the final statement as a significant step 
forward in their effort to achieve fundamental reforms in agricultural trade, 
their main accomplishment was to heighten public awareness of the costly farm 
subsidy programs of the Group of Seven nations. 
</P>
<P>
The objection to subsidies is that they encourage worldwide surpluses and, 
combined with other measures, make the home-grown products artificially 
competitive in price, at home and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
European officials defended the subsidies as necessary to preserve the 
livelihood of 12 million small farmers against the future onslaught of 
commodities produced more efficiently in the United States, Canada, Australia 
and a host of less-developed countries such as Chile, Argentina and India. 
</P>
<P>
Unless the Europeans accept sharp cuts in farm subsidies, U.S. trade officials 
fear that dozens of nations dependent on agricultural exports will walk away 
from the world trade negotiations in Geneva. The talks are aimed at opening the 
door to greater trade not only in agriculture but in sophisticated services, 
investments, computer software, entertainment and other products that are 
crucial to the economic growth of the advanced nations. 
</P>
<P>
A failure in the trade talks could lead to greater protectionism, spurring a 
possible breakdown of the world economy into rival trading blocs that would 
undermine advances in global prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the final communique orders trade negotiators to "reduce not only 
internal support but also export subsidies and import protection." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said this marks the first time that European leaders have 
accepted an express statement about the need to cut export subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
Some Europeans argued that the United States failed to achieve the breakthrough 
on trade it had sought coming into the summit. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no substantial new elements in the text," said Nico Wegter, chief 
spokesman on trade for the European Community, which had been particularly 
opposed to action in Houston on the subsidies issue. He also insisted that the 
communique does not single out export subsidies for special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
But the European Community's president, Jacques Delors, suggested that the 
Europeans may finally stop dragging their feet on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot keep saying, 'No, no, no,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hills acknowledged that the United States and Europe remain far apart on many 
of the key farm disputes. But the summit statement represents at least an 
evolution in the European position, she argued. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's not a breakthrough, it's progress," Hills said. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting in Bush's adopted hometown, the leaders wrapped up their final session 
earlier than scheduled by adopting a wide-ranging final declaration. 
</P>
<P>
The communique also provided an opening for West Germany and other nations to 
extend large amounts of aid to the Soviet Union. However, it cautioned that the 
Soviets must introduce a market economy and substantially curb their military 
threat to ensure "meaningful and sustained economic assistance" from the 
Western allies. 
</P>
<P>
It welcomed the impending reunification of Germany, called for aid to Eastern 
Europe in moving toward democracy and free markets and adopted a modest new 
initiative to aid certain Third World debtors.

COUNTY-USC HOSPITAL PUT ON ACCREDITATION PROBATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT STEINBROOK, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing a wide range of deficiencies in fire safety and the ability to monitor 
the quality of medical care, the nation's major hospital review organization 
has placed Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center on conditional accreditation. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second major county hospital to be placed on conditional 
accreditation. Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center was placed on the 
same probationary status earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Among public hospitals, it is not uncommon to see this degree of difficulty in 
meeting the accreditation standards," said Dr. William Jessee, the 
organization's vice president for accreditation surveys. "It is a sad 
commentary on the decaying infrastructure of public medical care in large 
cities." 
</P>
<P>
In a related action, the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare 
Organizations also put Queen of Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, a 
private, nonprofit hospital, on conditional accreditation. 
</P>
<P>
Conditional accreditation is reserved for hospitals with significant problems 
in meeting the commission's quality of care and safety standards. Such 
facilities typically have problems with their quality assurance programs and 
medical staff monitoring systems, which are designed to minimize the risk that 
patients will be harmed in the hospital or cared for by unqualified 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
A hospital that loses its accreditation jeopardizes its participation in the 
Medicare and Medi-Cal programs. In addition, a teaching hospital jeopardizes 
the status of its residency programs. 
</P>
<P>
During a weeklong inspection last September, Joint Commission officials found 
the behemoth County-USC deficient in 19 of the 54 key areas it rates. The 
medical center has 2,045 licensed beds but only 1,398 are in use. 
</P>
<P>
The actions were taken last month by the Oakwood Terrace, Ill.-based 
organization. Both County-USC and Queen of Angels have been asked to submit 
plans of correction. 
</P>
<P>
Queen of Angels officials have submitted their plan and County-USC officials 
expect to submit theirs in about a week. Each hospital will undergo another 
inspection in about six months. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Kern, a special assistant to County-USC's executive director, 
acknowledged serious fire hazards, particularly in the main General Hospital 
building which dates to 1932. There is no sprinkler system. 
</P>
<P>
Kern said the hospital, under pressure from federal health officials and city 
and county fire officials, is spending $500,000 a year for a 24-hour fire watch 
in which employees walk the halls of the 19-story main building looking for 
fires and potentially hazardous conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Stopgap repairs may be overtaken by other actions. In mid-September, county 
health officials expect to submit a master plan to the Board of Supervisors for 
replacing County-USC entirely, Kern said. Independent of the Joint Commission 
report, replacement is being seriously considered as an alternative to bringing 
the aging facility into full compliance with modern fire safety standards. 
Retrofitting the four hospitals that make up the County-USC medical complex 
with fire alarms and sprinklers could cost up to $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
Kern said County-USC would also request $2.6 million from the county to correct 
deficiencies in other areas, including physician evaluation, the organization 
of the medical staff, surgical case review and medical records. 
</P>
<P>
During an inspection of Queen of Angels last November, the Joint Commission 
found problems with medical records and maintenance procedures, according to 
Ron Dahlgren, the hospital's president. 
</P>
<P>
The 433-bed Queen of Angels facility has had financial difficulties since it 
merged with Hollywood Presbyterian in January, 1989. The hospital serves a 
disproportionate number of poor and minority patients, many of whom lack health 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
County officials are exploring the purchase of the the merged facility as a 
part of a plan for replacing County-USC Medical Center. But Dahlgren said the 
hospital's financial condition had improved in recent months and there was no 
interest in selling. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the impression that (the joint commission) wanted more months of 
experience as a merged institution before they gave us a non-conditional 
accreditation," Dahlgren said. "Everything we were told indicated that they 
were happy with the progress we had made since the merger." 
</P>
<P>
Since the Joint Commission began releasing the names of conditionally 
accredited facilities last year, 15 California facilities have been so 
designated. The other California hospitals conditionally accredited in June are 
the Veterans Affairs medical centers in Fresno, Livermore and Palo Alto, and 
Pacific Coast Hospital in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
There are now 10 VA hospitals in the West on conditional accreditation, 
including the VA medical centers in Long Beach and Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,800 hospitals inspected by the organization each year, only 5% to 8% 
are conditionally accredited, according to commission officials. Between 1% and 
2% of hospitals are not accredited and the others are fully accredited for a 
three-year period. County-USC was last fully accredited in 1986.

GORBACHEV ALLY WINS PARTY POST OVER HARD-LINER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev secured the election Wednesday of his nominee as 
the Soviet Communist Party's deputy general secretary, winning a showdown with 
the party's resurgent conservative wing. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir A. Ivashko, a moderate party leader from the Ukraine, defeated Yegor 
K. Ligachev, the foremost conservative within the party's powerful Politburo, 
for the post as Gorbachev's deputy, according to the official Soviet news 
agency Tass. 
</P>
<P>
Ivashko's election by delegates to the current party congress was an important 
victory for Gorbachev. It not only gave him a like-minded deputy to manage the 
party's affairs on a daily basis, but it should help stem the conservative tide 
that has seemed to threaten his political and economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The contest between Ivashko and Ligachev was, in many respects, the climax to 
the struggle between those party officials wanting to accelerate and broaden 
perestroika, as Gorbachev's reforms are known, and those concerned about the 
party's virtual abandonment of many long-held positions. 
</P>
<P>
A vote for Ivashko, 58, was portrayed throughout the debate as a vote for 
perestroika, a vote for Gorbachev, a vote for faster, more fundamental changes. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, a vote for Ligachev, 69, was presented as a vote to consolidate the 
party around its traditional Marxist positions and to reinforce the discipline 
that has enabled it to lead the country for 73 years. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the election results will be available this morning, editors at Tass 
said, and the relative balance of forces within the party will become clear 
only then. A third candidate, Leningrad professor Anatoly Dudyrev, 45, who 
nominated himself, was also on the ballot but not thought to be a real 
contender. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate ballot, delegates reelected Boris Pugo as the chairman of the 
party's Central Control Commission in charge of discipline, Tass said. Pugo had 
only nominal opposition. 
</P>
<P>
The contest for deputy general secretary, a new post created as part of a broad 
reorganization of the party, was fought without compromise. Ligachev declared 
that he was running as the "Marxist-Leninist" candidate, and Ivashko stressed 
his unquestioning support of Gorbachev and his reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe there is an overwhelming majority who support the principles of 
Marxism-Leninism," Ligachev said, calling for the party to pursue "a union of 
democratic forces supporting socialism" to press ahead with careful reforms but 
without losing its orientation. 
</P>
<P>
Radicals rushed to the microphones in the Kremlin's Palace of Congresses to 
protest. If Ligachev won, they warned, tens of thousands of people, probably 
more, would quit the party. Ligachev, who has sought such a "self-purge" of the 
party, seemed unperturbed. 
</P>
<P>
Amid this uproar, Gorbachev intervened in the debate to cite obscure Central 
Committee rules, prepared more than two years ago, that candidates could go 
onto the ballot only if there were no objections against them. Radicals quickly 
restated their criticism of Ligachev as objections to his candidacy, and 
Gorbachev called for a vote on whether Ligachev could be a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Ligachev was voted off the ballot, 2,293 to 1,916, stunning even 
radical reformers. Whether Gorbachev had engineered this was unclear, but he 
and his supporters did not disavow the result. 
</P>
<P>
Ligachev's supporters, caught by surprise, were not prepared to mount a similar 
challenge -- even if they had the votes. 
</P>
<P>
Again, there were protests, including direct criticism of Gorbachev for the 
"shabbiness" with which Ligachev, a veteran leader, was being treated. 
</P>
<P>
And then another vote, 2,349 to 1,816, reversed the earlier decision on the 
grounds that the party congress could overrule the procedures of the Central 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"Americans have a lot of bad jokes about 'who's on first?' " a Communist Party 
official said after watching the congress turn into a political and procedural 
shambles Wednesday afternoon. "But that question is so painfully relevant right 
now. Up or down, in or out, we have little idea of who is being elected to 
choose our fate, and that is what reduces even the most cultured among us to 
ranting and raving." 
</P>
<P>
In this confusing seesaw, Gorbachev appeared distressed and uncertain about how 
to proceed. What might have been a clear political victory for his forces was 
now complicated by procedural errors. 
</P>
<P>
And the strength of his own position clearly rested on his appeal to the 
delegates for their support rather than on a fully accepted political vision. 
</P>
<P>
The elections came as the 4,700 delegates to the congress, which opened July 2, 
slowly began to conclude their debates over the party's new platform, its 
statutes and other declarations and prepared to elect a new, policy-making 
Central Committee before closing on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev had told delegates to the congress that the two people at the top of 
the party hierarchy should hold similar views to ensure the implementation of 
perestroika, the smooth functioning of the 18-million-member party and the 
consolidation of the country's increasingly disparate political forces. 
</P>
<P>
"It is important that these two people be close," Gorbachev said, making it 
clear that he wanted Ivashko -- and no one else. 
</P>
<P>
Ivashko, who had been the leader of the Ukrainian party, has hewed close to 
Gorbachev's reformist line over the past five years, and he has moved rapidly 
from a local party secretary's post in Kharkov in 1986 into the top levels of 
the Soviet political hierarchy under Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
"As much as I have before, no matter what my job, I will be working for 
perestroika," Ivashko pledged. "We have to do everything to renew the party and 
change its priorities. . . . "We have to understand, too, that without us, 
without the party, nothing will be left of perestroika." 
</P>
<P>
But Ivashko, quite suddenly, seemed a very flawed candidate rather than a man 
who could, in the manner of the U.S. vice president, ensure support for the 
national leadership from a critical region. 
</P>
<P>
Summoned back to Kiev, where the Ukrainian Parliament is in emergency session 
to debate the republic's sovereignty and discuss a political strike by coal 
miners, Ivashko, along with other members of the Ukrainian delegation here, 
refused to go -- and quit his post as president of the Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
Accused of showing greater loyalty to the Soviet party than to the Ukrainian 
nation and the government that he headed, Ivashko resigned abruptly on 
Wednesday, saying that he could not continue in the face of the deputies' 
opposition, particularly that of Communist Party members of the Ukrainian 
parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Even a party spokesman said he was unable to explain, however, why Gorbachev 
would nominate to the No. 2 party position a politician who had just 
acknowledged in a formal letter of resignation that he did not have the support 
of Communist Party members from his own republic.

U.S. TELLS OF '40S RADIATION IN NORTHWEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Residents of the Pacific Northwest were exposed to large doses of radioactive 
iodine released at the Hanford, Wash., nuclear weapons plant during the 1940s, 
the Department of Energy acknowledged Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The radiation exposure, which will be detailed today in a report to be released 
in Richland, Wash., by an independent panel of scientists, was sufficient to 
cause illness among people living in parts of Washington, Oregon and Idaho, the 
department said. 
</P>
<P>
While the government has previously confirmed the release of radioactive iodine 
from the plant, the statement Wednesday by Energy Secretary James D. Watkins is 
the first official acknowledgment that the radiation could have affected the 
health of people living in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Watkins said he had conferred with John Till, a nuclear engineer leading the 
scientific study, and conceded that it will show "significantly high" doses of 
iodine were released from 1944 to 1947 at the site. "The implications of the 
report are serious," Watkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Watkins said the total radioactivity released during a single episode at 
Hanford in 1945 was between 350,000 and 400,000 curies. A curie is the amount 
of radiation emitted in one second by 1,400 pounds of enriched uranium. 
</P>
<P>
Watkins said the scientific report would estimate that some residents had been 
exposed over this period to as much as 3,000 rads. A rad is a measure of 
radiation equal to what is absorbed in about a dozen chest X-rays. By 
comparison, nuclear plant workers are limited by the government to an annual 
radiation exposure of five rads. 
</P>
<P>
Watkins said it was unclear what the exact health effects of the releases were. 
"We don't know who was at the right spot at the wrong time," he said. "We're 
primarily interested, of course, in the infants," who are substantially more 
vulnerable than adults to such radiation. 
</P>
<P>
A separate study by the federal Centers for Disease Control is addressing the 
actual cases of illness that may have resulted. 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating today's new disclosures about nuclear waste problems at the 
Hanford weapons complex, the department Wednesday shook up management of the 
sprawling plutonium production facility. It also announced it will sign an 
agreement today giving the Army Corps of Engineers a major role in the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
Watkins said Hanford's future will be devoted to waste management and 
environmental restoration rather than production of fuel for nuclear warheads. 
He added that its new director and three deputies will report directly to the 
chief of the multibillion-dollar cleanup of the department's contaminated 
weapons facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Hanford now has some 600,000 cubic yards of radioactive waste in storage, 
including 2,100 tons of spent fuel rods from plutonium production reactors and 
149 contaminated underground tanks that once held liquid wastes. So far, some 
1,100 sites on the 560-square-mile reservation have been identified as 
requiring remediation. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators from Energy Department headquarters are now completing another 
seven-week assessment and will shortly be reporting details of the cleanup 
requirements, Watkins said. 
</P>
<P>
In the management shake-up announced Wednesday, Watkins chose John Wagoner, a 
veteran of both civilian and military nuclear power programs, to replace 
Michael Lawrence, who will leave the department at the end of July. 
</P>
<P>
While he praised Lawrence as a "wonderful person," Watkins acknowledged that he 
wanted a more aggressive management organization to tackle the cleanup, whose 
cost is still a subject of widely varying estimates. 
</P>
<P>
A former admiral in the nuclear Navy, Watkins said he was shocked when he took 
over the nation's nuclear weapons complex to find that it lagged far behind the 
civilian nuclear industry in dealing with waste problems. 
</P>
<P>
"When we start rattling the trees here, we get a lot more rotten apples down 
than we expected," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The memorandum of understanding to be signed with the Army Corps of Engineers 
will lay out national guidelines for the corps' participation in the cleanup of 
weapons installations across the country.

MAN CHARGED WITH BILKING MEDI-CAL CAN'T BE PROSECUTED; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTIGATION: A BUSINESSMAN ACCUSED OF STEALING $22 MILLION RETURNS TO SPAIN, 
WHICH DOES NOT EXTRADITE ITS CITIZENS TO THE U.S. 
</P>

<P>
A Spanish businessman accused of stealing $22 million from the state's Medi-Cal 
program cannot be prosecuted here because he fled to his country before 
authorities raided his Diamond Bar home, government fraud investigators said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Faustino Pascual Crespo flew to Spain, which does not extradite its citizens to 
the United States, after fraudulently billing Medi-Cal for hundreds of 
thousands of medical items for incontinent patients, authorities said. The 
state attorney general charged him with grand theft last week in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the money represents the biggest theft by an individual in 
the history of Medi-Cal, which pays for medical care for poor Californians. 
</P>
<P>
Crespo, 47, was investigated as part of a statewide probe of unscrupulous 
medical suppliers suspected of stealing at least $200 million from Medi-Cal 
through fraudulent bills for adult diapers, rubber bedsheets and similar items. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have filed charges against about 100 people and closed 60 medical 
supply firms in an effort to stop the practice, which is concentrated in the 
Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities charge that Crespo, using a series of temporary business visas, 
flew to California from Spain at least six times during three years to commit 
the fraud. During his visits, Crespo allegedly filed fraudulent claims and 
returned later to cash the state checks he received, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Medi-Cal investigators, Crespo set up four medical supply 
companies in Los Angeles and Orange counties from 1987 to 1989. The firms 
billed Medi-Cal a total of $24.4 million, virtually all of it for incontinence 
supplies, investigators said. The firms were identified as Neighborhood Medical 
Supply in Cypress; Argus Enterprises in Santa Fe Springs; Lahke Home Care Inc. 
in Pomona and Meditech Technology Corp. in Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of the supplies never were delivered, said Dennis Cowan, the 
state's chief Medi-Cal fraud investigator in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Crespo's attorney, Dennis Warren, said state authorities "exaggerated the 
$22-million figure" for the purposes of getting a higher bail on Crespo. 
</P>
<P>
"They have substantial evidence of deliveries of millions of dollars of 
products to individual beneficiaries," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Crespo purchased Medi-Cal stickers from independent "sticker bandits" who get 
them from Medi-Cal recipients at nursing homes, mobile home parks and 
government-subsidized housing projects, Cowan said. 
</P>
<P>
Medi-Cal recipients are issued five stickers a month, which they exchange for 
doctor's visits and other medical services. The stickers must be attached to 
bills sent to Medi-Cal for payment. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, bandits give Medi-Cal recipients small bags of toiletries in 
exchange for the stickers, which cannot legally be sold or traded. In other 
instances, bandits impersonate Medi-Cal officials and steal stickers, Cowan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators raided Crespo's businesses and Diamond Bar townhouse March 2 but 
were told by his 21-year-old son that Crespo had left for the airport the night 
before, court papers said. Crespo lives in Marbella, on the Spanish Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
As long as Crespo remains in Spain, U.S. authorities cannot seize him and bring 
him to trial, said Assistant Atty. Gen. Steven V. Adler, who heads state 
investigations of Medi-Cal fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Crespo may have decided to flee after he was notified that Medi-Cal was 
auditing him, said M. Teresa Franco, a supervising Medi-Cal fraud investigator 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But Warren said Crespo left the United States not to escape authorities but to 
take a "pre-planned business trip" to Europe, where he owns several companies 
that manufacture or sell medical supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Since Crespo's departure, authorities have seized $2.7 million in cash and 
property belonging to him in California, including an 11-unit condominium 
complex under construction in Pomona. But Crespo managed to transfer more than 
$6.6 million to Spain from bank accounts in California, court documents said. 
</P>
<P>
Crespo also is the target of a $250,000 fraud investigation by officials of the 
federal Medicare health program for the elderly, according to court records.

FIRE PROMPTS SANTA BARBARA TO LIFT LAWN-WATERING BAN 
</P>

<P>
The fire danger from dry grass and withered vegetation spurred the Santa 
Barbara City Council to lift a ban on lawn watering that had been in effect for 
almost five months. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of the disastrous wildfire that destroyed more than 400 homes 
near Santa Barbara and blackened 4,500 acres, the City Council unanimously 
voted Tuesday to lift the watering ban, said Mayor Sheila Lodge. The resolution 
is expected to go into effect next week. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to increase the moisture level of lawns and shrubs, so if there's 
another fire it could provide a buffer zone," Lodge said. "Brown lawns and dry 
shrubs could provide fuel to any fire that breaks out." 
</P>
<P>
In late February, the council declared a "drought emergency," banning lawn 
watering and prohibiting residents from using hoses to water trees and shrubs. 
They were only permitted to keep vegetation alive with hand-held buckets or 
drip irrigation systems. 
</P>
<P>
These restrictions will be eliminated, but sharply higher water rates that went 
into effect during the drought emergency remain unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
No homes in Santa Barbara -- where the watering ban was in effect -- were 
damaged in the fire. Most of those that burned were in an unincorporated area 
of the county between Santa Barbara and Goleta. But because of the drought and 
higher water prices, many homeowners in the fire-damaged areas had brown lawns 
and dry vegetation, said Charlie Johnson, spokesman for the county Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, I saw entire lawns that were completely burned . . . and 
that will just fuel a fire," Johnson said. "That allows the fire to carry and 
jump to the next thing, like a domino effect." 
</P>
<P>
A well-irrigated landscape could limit damage if another fire sweeps through 
the city, said T. G. Tomberg, a battalion chief for the Santa Barbara Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
"The greener your landscaping is and the more moisture it has . . . the better 
chance it has in stopping a fire from spreading," Tomberg said. "Healthy green 
trees, shrubs or lawns are one part of a defense mechanism that could prevent a 
house from catching fire." 
</P>
<P>
City officials said the watering ban was lifted to reduce potential fire 
hazards, and because conservation efforts have been successful and emergency 
water supplies are expected soon. Since the drought emergency was declared, the 
city had hoped to conserve by about 45%, but during the last few months 
residents have exceeded expectations and cut water use by about half. 
</P>
<P>
Council members acknowledged that the decision to prohibit lawn watering was 
highly unpopular and that many residents had been pressuring city officials for 
months to end the ban. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a strong feeling among the public that it wasn't fair to have to cut 
back on their water use, and then be told where to cut back," said Councilman 
David Landecker. " . . . Residents showed more concern over this issue than any 
other I've been involved with in the City Council." 
</P>
<P>
Residents will be able to water their lawns as long as the city continues to 
conserve water by about 45%. But if water use rises sharply, council members 
say, the watering ban could be reinstated.

CAMARENA PROSECUTOR SAYS DRUG RING RAN GUADALAJARA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Corrupt Mexican law enforcement officials aided the growth of a 
multibillion-dollar narcotics cartel and created an atmosphere of lawlessness 
where the drug traffickers believed they could murder U.S. drug agent Enrique 
Camarena and get away with it, a federal prosecutor said Wednesday in Los 
Angeles federal court. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Manuel Medrano's remarks came during closing arguments in 
the trial of four men accused of involvement in the February, 1985, kidnaping 
and murder of Camarena in Guadalajara, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Medrano said the traffickers "did whatever they wanted because they thought 
they were beyond the reach of the law, and in Mexico they were." 
</P>
<P>
He described the drug cartel in Guadalajara as a "multi-headed monster" run by 
men who were "powerful . . . immensely wealthy and profoundly violent." 
</P>
<P>
"They were supported and facilitated by corrupt Mexican law enforcement 
officials," Medrano said. "In Guadalajara, virtually every law enforcement 
agency was corrupt." 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor specifically cited Mexico's Federal Security Directorate, the 
Social and Political Investigations Agency, the Federal Judicial Police and 
"even the army" as institutions that were corrupt in Guadalajara in the 
mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"But the tentacles of this corruption extended far beyond Guadalajara," said 
the prosecutor. "The tentacles extended to the heart of the government, to the 
capital Mexico City." 
</P>
<P>
The tenacious investigation by the U.S Drug Enforcement Administration of 
Camarena's murder, and two federal trials that have resulted from it, have 
generated considerable friction between the United States and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, seven current and former Mexican law enforcement officials are among 
the 22 people who have been indicted in Los Angeles on charges stemming from 
Camarena's murder. None of the major officials, however, have been brought to 
trial here. 
</P>
<P>
Medrano specifically lambasted several prominent Mexican law enforcement 
individuals by name, including Javier Garcia Paniagua, Mexico City's current 
police chief, who has not been indicted in the Camarena case. He said Garcia 
had attended two of the five meetings where Camarena's kidnaping was planned in 
late 1984 and early 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, he said, Miguel Ibarra Herrera, director of the Mexican Federal 
Judicial Police from 1982 to 1985, and Manuel Aldana Ibarra, director of 
Interpol in Mexico, the international police agency, from 1982 to 1985, 
participated in meetings planning Camarena's kidnaping. Both men have been 
indicted in Los Angeles, but they have not been extradited. 
</P>
<P>
After describing the narcotics cartel's rise, Medrano declared: "Into this den 
of wolves came the DEA." He said that the DEA's Guadalajara office was staffed 
by "four brave men," and characterized Camarena as "the star agent" in the 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Camarena was abducted off a Guadalajara street on Feb. 7, 1985, as he was on 
his way to a lunch date with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Medrano said Camarena and his fellow agents in Guadalajara had done impressive 
work in Mexico, despite the handicaps of being unarmed and being unable to 
arrest people. 
</P>
<P>
But a more important problem encountered by the agents, Medrano said, was the 
way they were impeded in their work by corrupt Mexican law enforcement 
officials who, on at least one occasion, warned drug traffickers so they could 
flee before a major raid. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the method of operation, the 'M.O.,' of corrupt officials," Medrano 
said. "On the one hand, they appear to be cooperating. On the other hand, they 
tip off drug traffickers because they are in cahoots with them." 
</P>
<P>
A representative of the Mexican Consulate in Los Angeles, Fernando Viveros 
Castaneda, sat in the packed courtroom listening attentively. At a recess, he 
said that nothing in Medrano's remarks surprised him, but he added that U.S. 
and Mexican law enforcement officials are meeting in Mexico this week to 
improve joint efforts against drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
The four men on trial include Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros, a convicted 
Honduran drug lord, and three Mexican men, including a former state police 
officer, Juan Jose Bernabe Ramirez. The other defendants are Ruben Zuno Arce, a 
prominent Mexican businessman, and Javier Vasquez Velasco. All the defendants 
face life imprisonment if convicted of the charges against them. 
</P>
<P>
Medrano said the drug traffickers' motive for kidnaping Camarena was that the 
DEA had inflicted heavy losses on them in a series of major raids in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor reviewed at length the evidence presented against each defendant 
during the eight-week trial. 
</P>
<P>
Medrano said that Zuno played a unique role in the drug cartel's operations 
because he was a politically powerful man -- the brother-in-law of former 
Mexican President Luis Echeverria Alvarez. In this regard, he said that Zuno 
had on two occasions provided official credentials from the Federal Security 
Directorate to drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor accused Zuno of being a "drug trafficker in his own right," and 
said testimony had been presented that Zuno participated in three of the five 
meetings where Camarena's kidnaping was planned. He said that Matta had 
attended two of the meetings and that Bernabe and Vasquez had served as 
bodyguards outside some of the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that an FBI forensics expert testified that hair matching 
Matta's had been found at the Guadalajara house where Camarena was tortured. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie, who has presided over the trial, agreed to 
consolidate the Camarena case and the killing of two other Americans in 
Guadalajara after finding that there was a significant connection between the 
crimes.

STALEMATE OVER STATE BUDGET CONTINUES; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCES: LAWMAKERS TRADE INSULTS. DEUKMEJIAN INSISTS NO TAX INCREASE IS 
NEEDED. THE STATE IS LEFT WITHOUT A BUDGET FOR THE 11TH DAY.

Progress toward a state budget agreement seemed to break down further 
Wednesday, with lawmakers trading insults, Gov. George Deukmejian expressing 
displeasure at a Senate-passed $50-billion state budget and one key lawmaker 
saying further negotiations with other legislators seemed pointless. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm ready to go home," said Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara), 
chairman of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, as fruitless deliberations 
left California without a budget for the 11th day. 
</P>
<P>
The absence of progress brought the machinery of state government ever closer 
to the point when checks will stop going out to welfare recipients, state 
employees and contractors who work for the state. 
</P>
<P>
Until a budget is approved, the state controller's office lacks the legal 
authority to issue checks. And state Treasurer Tom Hayes warned the governor 
and lawmakers Wednesday that unless a budget is signed by July 17, delays will 
begin costing the state more because of higher interest costs. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers in the Senate had hoped that by passing a budget late Tuesday night, 
they would -- as one put it -- "get the ball rolling" toward an agreement. 
Instead, feelings just seemed to harden. 
</P>
<P>
Representative of the mood in the Assembly were remarks, reported by the San 
Francisco Chronicle, between Assemblyman William P. Baker (R-Danville) and 
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) over the Senate-approved 
budget: 
</P>
<P>
"They left us with a bag of dog doo on our doorstep, lit it on fire, rang the 
doorbell and ran away," Baker said. Brown replied, "And we will not take it out 
of the bag. We will simply return it to its owners in its original form." 
</P>
<P>
Those and other comments left Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los 
Angeles) in a funk, and he lashed out at Deukmejian, state Supt. of Public 
Instruction Bill Honig and his critics in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti said Deukmejian, with his intractable stance against tax increases, is 
ignoring the financial strains created by waves of immigrants whose children 
are crowding into classrooms and whose family needs are straining public health 
and social services. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't see the change in California," Roberti said of Deukmejian, adding 
that if the governor took a close look at Hollywood he would find that "it's 
not a recording-film center; it's Ellis Island." 
</P>
<P>
As for Honig, Roberti accused him of being an ingrate for criticizing the 
Senate budget after Democrats fought off efforts by Deukmejian and Republicans 
to cut deeply into school funding. In the Roberti-backed budget, spending on 
just about everything but public schools was reduced. 
</P>
<P>
In his own news conference, Honig said that the Senate budget went "too far" by 
cutting back $1.7 billion in proposed spending. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti, saying he was "a little bit ticked," declared: "They are not living on 
the same planet that the rest of us are. . . . If they are not happy with what 
we did, what in the world do they want? Do we have to close the county 
hospitals and put the money in schools? Do we have to close all the trauma 
centers and put (the money) in teachers' salaries?" 
</P>
<P>
Regarding his critics in the Assembly, Roberti challenged them to, in effect, 
put a budget where their mouths are. "Now is the time for compromise, not 
rhetoric," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles) said the bitter exchanges, 
coming at a point when talks should be progressing toward a solution, made the 
current budget crisis the worst he's seen in his 13 years in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"It shows how desperate the situation is and how deadlocked things truly are," 
Roos said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as of today, the state has missed $627 million in payments to local 
governments, in-home care workers and doctors, hospitals and others who care 
for the poor under the Medi-Cal program. Also today, an additional $588 million 
in checks are to be held up including a $139-million payment to counties to 
meet obligations to welfare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Max Boot contributed to this story. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SENATE BUDGET-BALANCING PLAN 
</P>
<P>
 The budget-balancing plan passed by the state Senate includes $1.3 billion in 
new taxes and fees and $1.73 billion in program cuts. Under the plan, now being 
considered by the Assembly, Gov. George Deukmejian would be expected to cut an 
additional $550 million to provide a 3% emergency reserve. Here are the 
highlights: 
</P>
<P>
NEW TAXES: $1.193 BILLION 
</P>
<P>

federal law from 1987 to 1989, mostly applying to business and investment 
income. 
</P>
<P>
Capital gains on real estate purchases -- $43 million. Require buyers to 
withhold capital gains taxes when they purchase California real estate from 
out-of-state owners. Would not apply to sale of a home used as a primary 
residence. 
</P>
<P>
Withholding of taxes from independent contractors -- $220 million. Require 
businesses to withhold California income tax when they pay independent 
contractors more than $600 a year for personal services. 
</P>
<P>
Out-of-state vehicles -- $100 million. Establish a $300 fee on out-of-state 
vehicles registered for the first time in California. 
</P>
<P>
Extend the 6% sales tax -- $207 million. Apply the sales tax to candy and snack 
food, the rental of motion pictures to theaters and television stations, 
newspapers and periodicals, and printed advertising, such as catalogues and 
Yellow Pages directories. 
</P>
<P>
FEES: $93 MILLION 
</P>
<P>
University of California and California State University -- $21.7 million. 
Raise annual resident student fees by $148 at UC and $72 at Cal State and

40%. 
</P>
<P>
Fire protection -- $22 million. Charge a fee of $25 per residence on homes 
protected by the California Department of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
Child care -- $4.3 million. Charge a $25-per-year licensing fee on family 
child-care operations and a $300 annual fee on professional day-care centers to 
offset the cost of regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Other miscellaneous fee increases, $29 million. 
</P>
<P>
PROGRAM CUTS: $1.73 BILLION 
</P>
<P>
Suspend cost-of-living increases -- $326 million. Freeze welfare grants, 
Medi-Cal rates and grants to the aged, blind and disabled at current levels. 
</P>
<P>
Health programs -- $147 million. Cut Medi-Cal and local health programs and 
shift some drug and alcohol programs to federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
Local government -- $277 million. Freeze at current level payments to support 
trial courts and remove state requirements for counties and cities to perform 
certain functions. 
</P>
<P>
Higher education -- $150 million. Cut California State University funding $73 
million and the University of California $70 million and replace $7 million in 
state funding for the Maritime Academy with fees on the shipping industry. 
</P>
<P>
Social services -- $103 million. Cut the workfare program by $95 million and 
the homeless assistance program by $5 million and shift the Job Service Center 
to federal funding. 
</P>
<P>
Public safety -- $166 million. Increase inmate-to-guard ratios in state 
prisons, require an unspecified cut of $20 million in the prison program and 
cut the youth and adult corrections agency. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Program delays and funding shifts -- $287 million. Includes delaying final 
Medi-Cal payments of the current fiscal year until the following year.

AFFAIR CLOUDS CAREER OF ANTI-APARTHEID LEADER BOESAK; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTH AFRICA: HE RESIGNS HIS PULPIT OVER A TRYST WITH A MARRIED WOMAN. BUT 
ACTIVISTS DO NOT EXPECT IT TO HURT THE BLACK LIBERATION STRUGGLE.

<TEXT>
<P>
With only the clerical cloth and his international stature as protection, the 
Rev. Allan Boesak has endured a decade of arrests, detentions, charges, death 
threats and tear gas in a defiant fight against apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
But today, one of South Africa's most widely known anti-apartheid figures has 
become deeply embroiled in personal problems of his own making, and his 
political and professional ascension have been seriously undermined. 
</P>
<P>
The bespectacled pastor -- the dynamic leader of South Africa's mixed-race 
population and patron of the giant United Democratic Front anti-apartheid 
coalition -- took to the pulpit of his Cape Town church this week to tearfully 
announce his resignation as minister. 
</P>
<P>
The reason: revelations that he was having an affair. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the darkest days of my life," he told parishioners Sunday, some 
of whom began to weep. He apologized "for all the pain I have caused" and said 
he spoke "with deep regret of the high price" he would have to pay. 
</P>
<P>
Boesak, a 44-year-old father of four, denied that anything "immoral" had taken 
place between him and Elna Botha, a 30-year-old executive with the state-run 
television network. Botha, who is married to a TV news reader, is the niece of 
a former government Cabinet minister who once took away Boesak's passport. 
</P>
<P>
A day before Boesak's announcement, he and Botha were confronted at a Cape Town 
hotel by a reporter for a government-supporting newspaper, Die Burger, which 
said it had been tipped off by a maid at the hotel. The maid also had called 
Boesak's wife, Dorothy. Boesak told his congregation that his marriage had been 
breaking up before he met Botha. 
</P>
<P>
Boesak has made no public comments since that emotional church meeting. Church 
officials say they are awaiting Boesak's formal letter of resignation before 
deciding whether to accept it. 
</P>
<P>
Still in limbo are Boesak's prestigious positions as president of the World 
Alliance of Reformed Churches, to which he won unprecedented reelection last 
year, and as moderator of the 800,000-member Dutch Reformed Mission Church, the 
racially segregated Calvinist denomination for people of mixed race, who are 
officially classified in South Africa as Colored. 
</P>
<P>
Boesak's political credibility is bound to suffer, anti-apartheid activists 
say, but they foresee no permanent damage to the black liberation struggle, 
which has been largely taken over by returning political exiles and freed 
prisoners such as Nelson Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
Boesak's role in the struggle, like that of his friend, Anglican Archbishop 
Desmond M. Tutu, was created in the early 1980s by the disappearance of 
anti-apartheid leaders, thousands of whom were arrested or fled the country. 
</P>
<P>
Tutu and Boesak, shielded from the most serious government action by their 
growing international reputations and their clerical collars, filled in the gap 
by defying the authorities and speaking for those who could not. 
</P>
<P>
But those days have gone. The then-banned African National Congress now is a 
legal political organization inside South Africa. Mandela and dozens of other 
ANC and United Democratic Front leaders are free, political exiles are 
beginning to return and the government has lifted most of the curbs on 
political expression that Boesak and Tutu fought. 
</P>
<P>
"Boesak was a churchman with a public conscience but . . . always more 
politically important outside of South Africa than inside," said Mark Phillips, 
a researcher at the Center for Policy Studies in Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Boesak has been showered with international honors, including the 
Martin Luther King Jr. International Award, bestowed by the Los Angeles chapter 
of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in 1987. Two years earlier, he 
received the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Human Rights award, but his wife and 
8-year-old son had to accept it for him because the South African home affairs 
minister, Stoffel Botha, had confiscated his passport. 
</P>
<P>
"Since political organizations have been legalized, the 'political priests' 
have been largely returned to their priestly role," Phillips added, "and his 
political significance had waned before this scandal." 
</P>
<P>
Other political and church leaders say it is too early to count Boesak out. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a matter of great sadness," said Tutu, the 1984 Nobel Peace laureate. But 
"people should not think this is the worst kind of sin, and we hope that Allan 
will work through this crisis and be rehabilitated so that his tremendous gifts 
are not lost to the church and the country." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy Morobe, publicity secretary for the United Democratic Front, said he 
doubted that "this would be the death knell" for Boesak, who seven years ago 
helped found the coalition of more than 700 anti-apartheid groups. 
</P>
<P>
Boesak's illustrious political and church career has been marred once before by 
a similar scandal. In 1985, security police tape-recorded reported romantic 
liaisons between the cleric and a female church worker, who was white. Boesak 
admitted only that "a unique relationship" existed between them. 
</P>
<P>
Boesak came to world attention in 1982 when he led a successful campaign to 
have apartheid declared a heresy by the World Alliance of Reformed Churches. 
The alliance then suspended two white branches of the South African church for 
supporting apartheid and elected Boesak president.

President Bush's kinder, and more accommodating, style of personal diplomacy 
brought him no end of grief from critics in Congress and elsewhere during his 
first 18 months in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
But it is finally beginning to pay off in America's relations with its economic 
allies. 
</P>
<P>
That is the message emerging from the annual seven-nation economic summit 
conference that ended Wednesday: After 2 1/2 days of hard bargaining among the 
allied leaders, Bush achieved virtually all his goals. And he did it without 
stirring rancor or resentment. 
</P>
<P>
Bush spent much of his first year and a half in office accommodating the 
allies, especially the two most important ones, West Germany and Japan, on key 
issues. He also worked tirelessly to build personal relationships with Western 
leaders that increased the harmony among the major powers and left many of them 
in the President's debt. 
</P>
<P>
"What Bush did at Houston was to begin calling in his IOUs" from the six other 
heads of government, says J. Paul Horne, the European-based international 
economic analyst for the New York brokerage, Smith Barney, Harris Upham. "The 
guy has a very high credit rating abroad." 
</P>
<P>
Albert Bressand, director of Promethee, a Paris-based think tank, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a deep appreciation here in Europe because Bush was willing to pay the 
price for allied solidarity before," Bressand says. "As a result, none of the 
other leaders wants to make things difficult for him now." 
</P>
<P>
The chronology is plain enough: 
</P>
<P>
Bush was the first to support West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the drive 
for German reunification -- and, in the process, to boost Kohl's chances for 
election as the first leader of a unified Germany. 
</P>
<P>
He skillfully helped Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu avoid a serious 
scrap with Congress that might have resulted in the imposition of U.S. trade 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
He quickly acceded to Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's plea to begin a joint 
U.S.-Canadian effort to reduce acid rain, reversing the intransigence of the 
Reagan Administration and ending years of mounting friction between the two 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
And he encouraged European leaders to expand the portfolio of the 
Brussels-based European Community to include some diplomatic as well as 
economic powers -- part of the "new architecture" of the post-Cold War Europe. 
Last year, the United States let the community take the lead in coordinating 
international aid to Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Painfully for Bush, however, the reaction in Congress has been lukewarm, at 
best. Democratic lawmakers frequently have charged that the soft-treading 
President has been too lackluster in pressing America's interests and has 
failed to exert enough leadership around the world. 
</P>
<P>
But the White House may be getting the last laugh as it begins to reap the 
benefits of the President's more collegial strategy. 
</P>
<P>
"Bush may have seemed to be old-fashioned, but he actually has been playing a 
critical role," Smith Barney's Horne asserts. "He has been protecting the 
Western Alliance from losing what it has accomplished" in previous years as 
Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand begin producing ambitious new 
proposals in their competition for the leadership of post-Cold War Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's ability to cash in IOUs has been especially apparent here in Houston, 
where the summit leaders acceded to U.S. wishes on agricultural trade, breaking 
an impasse that could have stymied the current round of global 
trade-liberalization talks. 
</P>
<P>
They agreed to back away from establishing a $15-billion fund to aid the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
They scrapped a measure that Bush had opposed for setting long-range targets on 
reducing carbon dioxide emissions worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
And they confined any changes in the Third World debt strategy to limited 
reductions in debts owed to Western governments. 
</P>
<P>
In no small measure, the Administration's more accommodating posture in its 
early months helped lay the groundwork for those successes. The U.S. victory on 
the farm trade issue, for example, came largely because a grateful Kohl broke 
ranks with his fellow Europeans to support Bush on what he knows is an 
important issue to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
And Kohl, Kaifu and Mulroney took political risks of their own to help 
Washington on other issues, from the Soviet aid question to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, even the European Community was less insistent on holding to its 
established positions than had been expected. 
</P>
<P>
Bush virtually acknowledged those crosscurrents during his press conference 
Wednesday. Asked whether the fact that Kohl supported him on trade, even though 
he faces a pan-German election in early December, constituted a pay-back to 
Washington, the President was candid, to a point. 
</P>
<P>
"I do think that the Germans appreciate the fact that we have stood at their 
side on this question of German reunification," he said, and then mused, "The 
relationship . . . is hard to explain." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, not all the U.S. successes at the Houston summit stemmed from 
Bush's new personal diplomacy. As might be expected, in each case, the other 
leaders acted as a result of domestic pressures as well. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Kohl backed the U.S. stand on farm subsidies partly to repay Bush 
for having supported him on unification. But he also was wary about having to 
support East Germany's inefficient farmers if the existing European Community 
subsidy program were to continue. 
</P>
<P>
And much of Kaifu's opposition to lending to the Soviets stems from Moscow's 
refusal to return four islands in the southern Kuriles that it took from Japan 
after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
To some extent, Bush's "success" in fending off more sweeping proposals by the 
summit leaders was made easier by the fact that the allies were divided. As a 
result, many of the leaders' differences were resolved by agreeing only on a 
broad framework that allowed each country to go its own way on specifics. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the United States achieved virtually all of its objectives in 
Houston, and it did so without rancor or bitterness. That came partly because 
the allied leaders read Bush's lips -- and usually saw a smile.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush won a significant victory Wednesday when leaders at the 
seven-nation economic summit broke the impasse over farm subsidies that had 
stalled global trade talks in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
Resounding as his triumph in Houston was, however, that was the easy part. 
Negotiating the actual trade accord and selling it, both abroad and at home, 
will make Wednesday's achievement seem simple. 
</P>
<P>
What the leaders did in Houston was essentially jump-start the Geneva 
negotiations, which had bogged down over the issue of agricultural subsidies. 
Until now, there was virtually no chance that the talks could end by December, 
as Administration strategists had hoped. Now, there is hope. 
</P>
<P>
But, as U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hills conceded to reporters, there 
is still a long way to go in hammering out the details of the complex trade 
accord. 
</P>
<P>
The communique that the seven leaders issued Wednesday is basically "a 
political statement," Hills said. "We are meeting at the table to negotiate. 
We'll see how far we get." 
</P>
<P>
Hills' caution is understandable. The Geneva negotiations, the most sweeping 
talks ever held on removing barriers to trade, are designed to revamp the world 
trading system. 
</P>
<P>
Besides writing new rules covering agricultural trade, the new system would 
impose new regulations for trade in services, investment and intellectual 
property, such as patents, trademarks and copyrights. In all, it would affect 
about 15 major trade categories. About 105 countries are taking part in the 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
With trade tensions already mounting, the stakes are high. William E. Brock 
III, who held Hills' job in the early 1980s, warns that if the talks don't 
succeed, the failure would throw the world economy into turmoil. Financial 
markets would gyrate. Trade would slow sharply. And recession could quickly 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
Worse yet, Congress, already on edge over what it perceives as unfairness on 
the part of America's trading partners, seems likely to become even more 
protectionist if the Geneva talks fail. That, in turn, would help push the 
world into competitive trading blocs designed to shut out all competition. 
Economically, Europe, Japan and the United States would be at war. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first big test of whether the big industrial countries can work 
out our differences in this new post-Cold War world," says C. Fred Bergsten, 
director of the Institute for International Economics, a Washington think tank. 
"If the negotiations fail, the impact will go far beyond economics." 
</P>
<P>
What makes the talks especially difficult is that all of the 15 
"mini-negotiations" -- on agriculture, services and the like -- are linked to 
one another. 
</P>
<P>
Unless the rich countries agree to lower barriers on agriculture and textiles, 
which are important products in the less-developed countries, Third World 
nations won't accept rules safeguarding Western patents, trademarks and 
copyrights. Failure to guarantee free access for service industries would make 
any new accord impossible to sell in richer countries. 
</P>
<P>
"The question now is, can the momentum that the summit leaders generated in 
Houston be translated to the lower-level negotiators in Geneva?" says Michael 
Aho, trade analyst for the Council on Foreign Relations, the New York-based 
foreign policy group. 
</P>
<P>
The complex negotiations, which are expected to move into high gear now, will 
continue in Geneva until early December, when Cabinet-level trade officials are 
scheduled to meet in Brussels for a final week of bargaining. Most of the 
serious horse-trading is expected to occur in those final days. Until then, 
everything will be up in the air. 
</P>
<P>
Even more uncertain is whether Hills -- and eventually Bush -- will be able to 
sell any new accord to Congress. Hills is well aware that the lawmakers won't 
even consider the pact seriously unless it contains firm rules for reducing 
barriers in agriculture, services and intellectual property. 
</P>
<P>
But if the United States gets its way on these, it almost certainly will have 
to give up import quotas and tariffs that now protect powerful domestic 
industries, such as textiles, sugar and steel. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of these industries already have begun lobbying intensely 
against the Geneva talks. Now, even the environmentalists have joined them, 
protesting efforts to prohibit countries from using what U.S. officials see as 
bogus health standards to keep out foreign goods. 
</P>
<P>
The result is almost certain to be a major political brouhaha next January and 
February, when the lawmakers, bombarded with narrow-interest political 
pressures, begin work on ratifying any new accord. 
</P>
<P>
For now, that time still seems relatively far away. In between, there is much 
real work to be done. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have further disagreements, further all-night sessions," said 
Julius L. Katz, Hills' chief deputy for trade negotiations. The United States 
and its trading partners are still far apart. 
</P>
<P>
But the Houston communique is a start. It is aimed at providing the same sort 
of political impetus that the summit leaders did in 1977 and 1978, when they 
jump-started the previous round of trade-liberalization talks, known formally 
as the Tokyo Round. 
</P>
<P>
Those talks, completed in 1979, helped bring about a sizable expansion in world 
trade and thus contributed significantly to the expansion that is continuing 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The hope of the seven leaders here was that Wednesday's action might do the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AGRICULTURAL SUBSIDIES 
</P>
<P>
Subsidies include cash payments, value of tariffs and tax benefits and other 
forms of producer supports. In billions of dollars.

SUMMITRY: UNDER THE GLARE OF WORLD ATTENTION, THE SEVEN LEADERS FELT COMPELLED

<TEXT>
<P>
Hours before the start of the 16th annual economic summit Monday, British 
spokesman Bernard Ingham was asked how the heads of the world's major 
industrial powers could possibly reach agreement on the intractable problem of 
cutting back farm subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
"Ah," Ingham replied, "therein lies the miracle of summits." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's final results seemed to prove him correct. 
</P>
<P>
Summits defy the wisdom of management theory, with its belief in clear-cut, 
decisive action and its abhorrence of evasion and inefficient half-steps. And 
critics were quick to point out that the Houston summit dealt with several 
issues by reaching agreement on broad goals while leaving individual countries 
free to do largely as they pleased. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, in politics, half a loaf is often a lot of bread. And in international 
negotiations, "progress is not a straight line, it's a sawtooth" moving in zigs 
and zags, said one senior U.S. official. 
</P>
<P>
Even in this era of almost nonstop consultation, therefore, the bringing 
together of heads of state for large, set-piece meetings seems to play a vital 
role in keeping their governments zigging and zagging ahead. 
</P>
<P>
The reason, experts say, is simple. By assembling national leaders in the full 
glare of world attention, summits force them and their aides to confront 
difficult issues they might otherwise push aside. 
</P>
<P>
While they still may disagree and refuse to take decisive action, leaders find 
it difficult to ignore a pressing issue entirely and often cannot avoid taking 
first one half-step, then another. Once all the national delegations have 
arrived and negotiations are under way, no one leader wants to be tagged as the 
person who blocked accord and caused the summit to "fail." 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't work . . . to march in lock-step on all these questions," President 
Bush said during his post-summit news conference Wednesday. At the same time, 
summit participants feel a strong pressure not to get too far out of step. 
</P>
<P>
The prime example at the latest summit came in agriculture, in which the heads 
of state agreed, some of them reluctantly, to break a logjam that had stalled 
world trade negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Bush arrived in Houston determined to get a deal that would move the trade 
talks forward. West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl used the summit as an 
occasion to break ranks with fellow European leaders and support Bush on the 
key agricultural issue. In the end, that forced a deal. 
</P>
<P>
On the environment, the summit played a similar role, although in the opposite 
direction. For months, the major industrial nations have been locked in debate 
on reducing carbon dioxide and other gases that are believed to cause global 
warming. Some want aggressive action to reduce the gases; others favor 
postponing action. 
</P>
<P>
At the summit, the no-action side, led by the United States, won decisively -- 
for better or worse -- putting at least a temporary end to the debate. 
</P>
<P>
Summit meetings do have their limits. 
</P>
<P>
"Informality is not possible," noted W. Allen Wallis of the American Enterprise 
Institute think tank, who was President Reagan's chief negotiator at several 
economic summits. And the meetings typically cost taxpayers of the nations 
involved millions of dollars, probably nearly $20 million this time around. 
</P>
<P>
But the role of summits in grabbing the attention of world leaders may be even 
more important now than in the past. In earlier years, noted Robert D. Hormats, 
former assistant secretary of state, the pressures of the Cold War helped force 
the major industrial democracies together. Now, by contrast, the chief job 
facing leaders of the industrial nations is to prevent economic tensions from 
pulling them apart, Hormats said. 
</P>
<P>
And economic disputes are the sort of matters that most world leaders prefer to 
avoid. They almost always involve complicated, technical matters in fields that 
few politicians feel comfortable discussing in detail. 
</P>
<P>
The annual economic summits force the leaders of the participating countries to 
focus on those issues, at least for a few days each year. Moreover, for 
lower-level officials, the summits pose a deadline, forcing action to avoid 
confrontations when the heads of state meet. 
</P>
<P>
The international agreement reached late last month on new protection for the 
ozone layer illustrates that point. Officials from the United States and its 
European allies, knowing that this week's summit might face a split over 
another environmental issue, global warming, were eager to get the ozone issue 
out of the way before the summit leaders arrived. 
</P>
<P>
The pressure paid off with a quick agreement on ozone protections, and a summit 
confrontation was avoided. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, of course, regardless of what the experts and the scholars say, there 
is one inescapable fact: So long as world leaders enjoy attention, they will 
schedule summits. One line in Wednesday's final summit declaration took no 
negotiation to work out. 
</P>
<P>
"We have accepted the invitation of Prime Minister Thatcher to meet next July 
in London," it declared.

Mayor Marion Barry collapsed from an apparent cocaine overdose during a 1987 
trip to the Super Bowl in Southern California and had to be hospitalized, a 
lawyer said at Barry's cocaine and perjury trial Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Lloyd Moore, a friend of Barry's who said that he had used cocaine 
repeatedly with the mayor, testified that he learned of Barry's collapse in a 
phone call from another Barry associate, Arthur (Jeff) Mitchell. Mitchell had 
accompanied Barry to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell "indicated that they had smoked . . . cocaine laced with something," 
Moore said of the January, 1987, phone call. "Mr. Barry was very sick. They 
thought he was going to die." 
</P>
<P>
Moore said that Barry's office put out a cover story that the mayor had been 
hospitalized at the Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in Inglewood for a hiatal 
hernia. The Super Bowl that year was played in Pasadena's Rose Bowl. Moore did 
not specify where Barry had experienced his illness. 
</P>
<P>
He testified, however, that Mitchell told him he would not allow hospital 
employees to take a blood sample from the mayor, apparently out of fear that 
his drug use would be discovered. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, whom Barry appointed to two low-level city commissions, and a woman 
friend of Barry's gave jurors new firsthand accusations involving Barry's 
alleged long-term drug use. Moore said that beginning in 1986 he invited the 
mayor repeatedly to use his home to snort cocaine and that the two men did so. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Theresa Southerland, 27, testified that she twice vacationed with 
Barry in the Bahamas and used cocaine with him in his beachfront Nassau hotel 
room in 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Southerland, the second woman to testify that she was the mayor's girlfriend 
and used drugs with him, said that Barry would scoop up the powdered drug with 
a business card and inhale it. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the trial, former model Rasheeda Moore testified that she had a love 
affair with Barry and had used cocaine, marijuana and opium with him more than 
100 times. Moore cooperated with the FBI last January in a "sting" operation in 
which Barry was arrested after being secretly videotaped in a hotel room 
smoking crack cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors are seeking to pile up evidence of Barry's alleged long-term drug 
use to counter defense arguments that the FBI entrapped Barry. Proof that a 
defendant was predisposed to commit a crime by virtue of his past conduct is 
the best defense against charges that he was entrapped, according to federal 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Robert Mance did not try to challenge Southerland's testimony 
about Barry's drug use or her statement that they had had "an intimate 
relationship" for nearly two years. But Mance brought out that Southerland had 
been using cocaine for about a year before she met Barry at a local nightclub 
in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Both Southerland and Moore have said that they expect to avoid prosecution on 
drug charges themselves by cooperating with federal officials in the Barry 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Barry, 54, who announced last month that he will not seek an unprecedented 
fourth term as mayor, is facing 10 misdemeanor drug-possession charges, a 
misdemeanor charge of conspiracy to possess drugs and -- more seriously -- 
three felony charges of lying under oath for telling a federal grand jury that 
he did not use drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Southerland was asked to describe the first time she was alone with Barry at a 
friend's house in November, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I came over," she said. "We had a couple of drinks. We talked. We listened to 
music. I went to the bathroom. I came back and cocaine was on the table." 
</P>
<P>
She said that she and Barry snorted the powdered drug and that thereafter she 
usually supplied the cocaine herself at get-togethers in private homes, 
apartments, on pleasure boats and in the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by associate prosecutor Judith Retchin, Southerland said: "I 
used my own money" to buy the cocaine and that Barry never reimbursed her.

FDA ASKED TO ORDER WARNINGS TO HEART VALVE USERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A consumer group on Wednesday asked the Food and Drug Administration to order 
an Orange County company to warn users of its mechanical heart valves that the 
devices might be defective. 
</P>
<P>
Public Citizen, a Washington-based organization affiliated with Ralph Nader, 
estimated that warning notices should go to about 56,000 people with heart 
valves manufactured by Shiley Inc. of Irvine, a subsidiary of the Pfizer Inc. 
pharmaceuticals firm. 
</P>
<P>
The group filed a civil lawsuit against Shiley in Los Angeles seeking a court 
order requiring the notification. The suit was dismissed in May after a judge 
found that the FDA had sole authority to issue such an order. 
</P>
<P>
Shiley voluntarily stopped making the controversial valves in 1986, after 
defective welds were blamed for deaths around the world. The FDA attributed 246 
deaths to defective Shiley valves, but other estimates are far higher. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 82,000 valves were implanted before the devices were withdrawn from the 
market. The consumer group said that at least 56,000 people who still have 
Shiley valves should be warned so they can consider having surgery to replace 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The group said the warning notices also should describe the signs of imminent 
valve failure and the emergency steps that should be taken to minimize the risk 
of a malfunction causing death or serious injury. The notices also should 
identify hospitals where open-heart surgery can be performed to replace a 
defective valve in an emergency, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
"All available evidence indicates that lives will be saved if more patients are 
notified directly with truthful and accurate information," said Dr. Sidney M. 
Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's health research group. 
</P>
<P>
FDA guidelines call for sensitive medical information to be conveyed to 
patients through their doctors. A spokesman for Shiley said the company has 
followed that policy in connection with the heart valves and will continue to 
do so unless instructed otherwise by the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Cruzan of the FDA said the agency was reviewing its notification policy 
for patients with heart valves. She said that the Public Citizen petition would 
be considered as a part of that process.

SENATE BLOCKS BAN ON FOOD HANDLERS WITH AIDS VIRUS; 
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATION: SEN. HELMS HAD SOUGHT TO MAKE THE EXCLUSION PART OF THE 
DISABILITIES ACT. LAWMAKERS SUPPORT LISTING OF DISEASES THAT COULD POSE A 
THREAT.

<P>
The Senate, facing a second showdown on an emotion-laden issue, reversed itself 
Wednesday and rejected an attempt by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) to bar persons 
infected with the AIDS virus from working as food handlers. The vote was 61 to 
39. 
</P>
<P>
While Helms warned that the result might force some restaurants into 
bankruptcy, his opponents countered that there was no evidence that AIDS, or 
the human immunodeficiency virus that causes it, could be transmitted through 
food. 
</P>
<P>
On a 99-0 vote, however, the Senate decided to require the federal government 
to draw up a list of diseases that could be spread by food handlers and also 
decided that pending anti-discrimination legislation would not override state 
or local laws dealing with public health regulations for restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
A Senate-House conference is completing final revisions to the landmark 
Americans with Disabilities Act, which would guarantee access to jobs and 
public facilities for 43 million disabled persons, and the votes Wednesday were 
on measures that would instruct Senate conferees. 
</P>
<P>
Helms argued that restaurant owners and other employers should be allowed to 
transfer workers who have AIDS or are HIV-infected from food-handling jobs 
because of public perceptions about the disease. 
</P>
<P>
"Call it hysteria or whatever you want, but the vast majority of people who eat 
in restaurants don't want their food prepared or handled by someone who has 
AIDS or HIV," Helms argued. "They'll stay away in droves. It's a matter of 
survival for many, many restaurant operations." 
</P>
<P>
Then, simulating a cook cutting lettuce, Helms said: "A chef with AIDS is 
chopping up a salad and he cuts his finger. Do you want to eat that salad? I'd 
like to poll the members of the Senate to see who would." 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), a conservative who often sides with Helms, 
argued that there is now no scientific evidence to show that AIDS can be 
transmitted through food. 
</P>
<P>
"Let science govern," Hatch urged the Senate. "Do what is right. . . . Should a 
homosexual be discriminated against? The answer to that is no." 
</P>
<P>
Helms, however, countered: "Science doesn't know the full story." 
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Whip Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) charged that Helms' proposal was 
"based on ignorance, prejudice, myth and fear" that would legitimize 
discrimination against persons with AIDS or the HIV virus. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome was a reversal of an earlier Senate vote on the issue. On that 
occasion, the Senate went on record 53 to 40 in support of a move by Helms to 
instruct Senate negotiators to accept a similar House-passed provision 
concerning food handlers. 
</P>
<P>
Another obstacle to final approval of the disability bill was overcome when the 
Senate decided to apply the bill's provisions to the Senate itself, while 
requiring those complaining of discrimination to use an internal system rather 
than filing lawsuits in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
Some senators had argued that they should be subject to the same court 
processes as state and local governments and private businesses. A strong 
majority disagreed, maintaining that lawmakers could be subject to harassment 
by federal judges if such a provision were adopted. 
</P>
<P>
The House also decided to use an internal dispute-settlement board to resolve 
complaints of discrimination by disabled employees. By congressional tradition, 
each chamber decides for itself on such questions.

DRUG CURBS OSTEOPOROSIS FRACTURES; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE AND WIDELY AVAILABLE, IT HALVED THE RATE OF 
VERTEBRA BREAKS IN A TEST GROUP OF WOMEN WITH BRITTLE BONES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A relatively inexpensive and widely available drug can halve the rate of 
vertebral fractures in women with osteoporosis, according to a study that may 
offer a new treatment option for some of the 24 million Americans who suffer 
from brittle bones. 
</P>
<P>
The drug, called etidronate, is used to treat Paget's disease, a bone disorder 
among middle-aged and elderly people. It is not approved for use against 
osteoporosis, but the manufacturer intends to apply for federal permission. 
</P>
<P>
"The important message is that here is another therapeutic option that is 
probably as effective as estrogen and calcitonin and that has a low incidence 
of side-effects," said Dr. B. Lawrence Riggs, an osteoporosis specialist at the 
Mayo Clinic and Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Estrogen therapy is one of several methods of preventing bone loss in 
post-menopausal women. But it is less effective against more advanced 
osteoporosis, has some undesirable side effects and cannot be used by women 
with a high breast-cancer risk. 
</P>
<P>
Calcitonin, another hormone, is often used by women who cannot take estrogen. 
But in the United States, it must be given by injection. It is also relatively 
expensive -- about 10 times the annual cost of etidronate, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
The new study, published today in the New England Journal of Medicine, found 
that two years of etidronate therapy not only halved the vertebral-fracture 
rate in post-menopausal women but also increased their spinal bone density by 
an average of 4% or 5%. 
</P>
<P>
The lessening of the fracture rate was especially striking in women who had the 
weakest bones when the 429-patient study began. In their case, the 
vertebral-fracture rate was reduced by two-thirds compared to women not taking 
the drug. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is the demonstration of a reduced rate of fractures," 
said Dr. Nelson B. Watts, the study's principal author. "It doesn't matter to a 
patient whether the bones are more dense or not; what matters to them is 
whether they have a fracture and hurt." 
</P>
<P>
The study focused specifically on vertebral fractures, the most common 
fractures in people with osteoporosis. Watts said the number of non-vertebral 
fractures, such as hip fractures, in the women he studied was too small to show 
any significant differences between women on and off the drug. 
</P>
<P>
Others cautioned that the drug needs further study to explore, for example, its 
long-term effects on bone strength and bone-cell activity. They also called for 
studies comparing the effectiveness of etidronate to that of other osteoporosis 
treatments. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now we see it as part of that arsenal (of osteoporosis drugs)," said 
Sandra C. Raymond, executive director of the National Osteoporosis Foundation. 
"We can't answer the question, is it more or less effective than anything 
else?" 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to emphasize that this is still viewed as experimental 
therapy," said Dr. Steven T. Harris of UC San Francisco, a co-author of the 
study. "It is intriguing, it's exciting, but it's experimental." 
</P>
<P>
Osteoporosis -- which can cause fractures of the spine, hip and wrist -- 
affects about 24 million Americans, most of them elderly women. About 5 million 
of them suffer from spinal osteoporosis and run the risk of painful vertebral 
fractures. 
</P>
<P>
Such fractures can cause the bones to compress, resulting in a progressive loss 
of height or in pain from compression of the spinal nerve. Osteoporosis is 
estimated to cause 1.5 million fractures in the United States each year. 
</P>
<P>
Etidronate works by interfering with so-called bone remodeling, the process by 
which bones are constantly broken down and rebuilt. The drug inhibits the 
metabolic activity of cells responsible for breaking down, or resorbing, bone. 
</P>
<P>
Watts estimated the drug's cost, if used to treat osteoporosis, at $200 to $300 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted at seven academic medical centers nationwide, involved 
women who had already had from one to four vertebral fractures. Some of the 
women received etidronate while others did not; they all took calcium, a widely 
used osteoporosis treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The drug was administered by tablet intermittently over two years. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the women who took etidronate had a vertebral fracture rate of 29.5 
per 1,000 patient years -- compared to a rate of 62.9 in the non-drug group. 
The women with the lowest spinal bone density had a rate of 42.3 fractures 
compared to 132.7. 
</P>
<P>
The findings expand upon those of a much smaller study published two months ago 
in the journal. That study, involving fewer but sicker patients, found a 
similar increase in bone mass, absence of side effects and a reduction in 
fractures. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly can't claim that this cures osteoporosis," said Watts, associate 
professor at Emory University School of Medicine. "There may be people with 
such severe disease that we can't restore them to health. But this certainly 
improves their lot." 
</P>
<P>
Etidronate has been available in the United States since 1978 for treatment of 
Paget's disease and a bone disorder in cancer patients. It is sold under the 
brand name Didronel by its manufacturer, Norwich Eaton Pharmaceuticals Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Norwich Eaton helped fund the new study. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Dietrich, a company spokeswoman, said this week that the firm intends to 
apply soon to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to make osteoporosis 
treatment an "approved use" for etidronate. One researcher estimated that an 
FDA decision could take at least six months. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the law does not prevent physicians from prescribing the drug 
for so-called "off-label" uses such as treating osteoporosis. But physicians 
may be leery of risking liability for any unintended consequences of 
prescribing it for an unapproved use.

JUDGE ORDERS MONTOYA TO ENTER PRISON NEXT WEEK

<P>
A federal judge on Tuesday ordered former state Sen. Joseph Montoya to 
surrender in one week to begin serving his 6 1/2-year prison sentence for 
corruption. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Milton Schwartz set a deadline of noon next Tuesday after a 
federal appeals court earlier this week denied Montoya's motion to remain free 
while he seeks to overturn his conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya, a Whittier Democrat, has been free without bail since his indictment 
in May, 1989. He resigned from office under pressure from Senate leaders in 
February, when he was convicted on seven counts of racketeering, extortion and 
money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said Montoya, 51, can either turn himself in at the U.S. marshal's 
office in Sacramento or go directly to the prison designated by the federal 
Bureau of Prisons. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Bureau of Prisons said the prison to which convicts are 
designated is confidential. However, the judge, at the urging of Montoya's 
lawyer, recommended that the former senator serve his time at the 
minimum-security camp at Lompoc. 
</P>
<P>
Lompoc is being converted from a low-security camp to a somewhat more secure 
facility that will house some medium-security prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Kris Southard, bureau spokesman in Sacramento, said prison authorities give 
considerable weight to a judge's recommendation but also consider a convict's 
record of violence, escapes and prior convictions. He said they also try to 
place prisoners close to their families. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya, who has never been convicted of a crime before, also could be sent to 
the low-security camp at Boron, in the desert near Edwards Air Force Base.

Water Resources Department had shut down a quarter-mile section of the aqueduct 
May 1 about 50 miles south of Stockton to fix a chronic leak. The 
state-operated aqueduct delivers water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River

BOARD FAILS TO OK STADIUM LIGHT DEAL 
</P>

<P>
Hillside homeowners in Ventura expressed surprise and anger Tuesday when the 
Ventura Unified Board of Education failed to approve a compromise regarding the 
height of new lights at Ventura High School's Larabee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Although the compromise was on the board's agenda, the board, without 
explanation, decided not to take action. 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners, who last fall sued the district, contending that the lights 
reduced property values and blocked their view of the ocean, said they are 
again considering legal action. "I guess we'll just have to go to court," 
homeowner Paul Lortie said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the possible legal action against the district, trustees and 
district staff members refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise involved lowering the four light poles to 70 feet from their 
current heights of 80 feet on the stadium's south side and from 110 feet on the 
north side. 
</P>
<P>
In a report to the board, Gary Mortimer, district maintenance director, said 
lowering the lights would increase glare for players on the field. 
</P>
<P>
He said a lower height also would shine more light onto residences directly 
behind the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the hillside homeowners had their attorney officially revoke the 
lawsuit just hours before the board meeting because they believed an acceptable 
compromise had been reached, homeowner Art Tidey said. 
</P>
<P>
In return, the homeowners agreed to help raise money to pay off the $125,000 
the district borrowed from the city of Ventura to pay for the lights. 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners also offered to help raise money to pay for the refurbishing or 
replacement of aging locker rooms, upgrade landscaping and install an 
all-weather track. 
</P>
<P>
The district decided last year to replace the lights because storm damage made 
the old ones unsafe. KAREN McKEAN

<P>
This compares with response rates of 68% in Santa Barbara County, and 52% to 
65% in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
"People who live in Ventura County will directly benefit from their excellent 
response," Williams said. "Many federal appropriations, such as those that 
assist education, senior citizens and day care, are based on population 
reported by the census." 
</P>
<P>
Williams explained the county's high response by saying, "The people are simply 
more conscientious here than in other places." 
</P>
<P>
As of last Friday, 175,873 households in the county had responded to 233,013 
questionnaires. For every resident who is not counted, the county loses about 
$100 in government funding, Williams noted. 
</P>
<P>
She said the bureau's "Were You Counted?" campaign will seek out uncounted 
residents through July 27. Telephone responses can be made by calling 1 (800) 
999-1990 between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. weekdays. Those wishing to be counted in 
person may visit the Census Bureau office at 255 W. Stanley Ave., Ventura, from 
8 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays. JACK SEARLES

POLICE SEARCHING FOR SUSPECT IN SLAYING

<P>
Police were continuing to search Wednesday for a man suspected of killing one 
man and wounding another in an argument in Santa Paula on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives identified Enrique Aceves, 25, as the man they were seeking in the 
shooting death of Gary Ramirez, 25, of Ventura, and the wounding of Robert 
Ortiz, 23, of Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
They later learned that Aceves was the suspect's alias, Santa Paula Police 
Cmdr. Bob Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
"We know who the suspect is on sight; however, we do not know his real 
identity," Gonzalez said. "We're having difficulty actually identifying him by 
name." 
</P>
<P>
Police believe that the suspect may have fled to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"He's from Mexico and there was some discussion about him going back there," he 
said. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ

WATER DISTRICT TO ASK PUBLIC FOR COMMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Casitas Municipal Water District decided Wednesday to hear public comment 
before voting whether to charge customers $500 and other fees to be placed on a 
waiting list for new hookups or additional water allotments. 
</P>
<P>
The district's board of directors will hold a public hearing on the proposal in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, a $500 application fee would be required along with an 
annual fee of $50 per acre-foot of water requested. Failure to pay the annual 
fee would result in the applicant being dropped from the list. 
</P>
<P>
Casitas General Manager John Johnson said fees are necessary to cover 
administrative costs for keeping track of the applications and for 
investigating if applicants meet the new service criteria. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the drought and increasing demands on the Lake Casitas 
reservoir, the board declared a water shortage emergency April 11 and ordered 
at least a one-year delay on approving new or additional water service 
requests. 
</P>
<P>
The water company serves 2,800 customers and sells water wholesale to 14 other 
agencies, serving a total of 55,000 residents in the northern county. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the board will decide how to allocate any new supplies of water, should 
they become available. The board's water resources subcommittee has proposed 
that 44% of any new supplies be allocated for agricultural use. The remaining 
56% would go for residential and industrial use. Also, no one applicant would 
receive an allocation of more than 10% of the total available new supply. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, applicants would have to prove that they have installed low-flow 
plumbing fixtures or have had a water audit of their irrigation methods before 
they could receive additional water. THIA BELL

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The body of a woman who police believe was slain was found Wednesday in Scripps 
Ranch, authorities reported. 
</P>
<P>
The body of the unidentified woman was found 20 feet down the side of an 
embankment in the 10300 block of Scripps Ranch Boulevard early Wednesday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
At 7:30 a.m., a woman on her way to work saw a coil of yellow nylon rope near 
the sidewalk and glanced over the embankment, where she saw the body, Detective 
Lt. Paul Ybarrondo said. 
</P>
<P>
Ybarrondo said the dead woman, who is possibly Latino or Asian, was in her 30s 
and was wearing a dark blouse, bright green pants and white sandals. 
</P>
<P>
There is evidence that, sometime during the night, the woman's body was dragged 
from a vehicle parked at the curb, across the sidewalk and then either thrown 
or taken down the embankment, Ybarrondo said. He said the rope on the sidewalk 
led down to the body. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy has not been done. 
</P>
<P>
The stretch of Scripps Ranch Boulevard where the woman's body was found is an 
isolated industrial area not heavily traveled at night, Ybarrondo said. 
</P>
<P>
Police have no suspects and know no motive. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police are handling the case, but Ybarrondo said the Metropolitan 
Homicide Task Force was called to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Ybarrondo said Wednesday he had no reason to believe there is a connection with 
this death and the series of prostitute killings over the past few years that 
the task force has been investigating.

LOFTY VISIONS FOR VENTURA STOP SOMEWHERE SHORT OF GOALS; 
</P>
<P>
CITY COUNCIL: A STUDY SESSION PRODUCES PARADOXES AND DREAMS -- AND THE DISMAY 
OF ONE MEMBER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
If Ventura City Councilman Gary Tuttle's vision comes true, in 20 years the 
city will be practically unrecognizable. 
</P>
<P>
Public transportation would be composed of buses that would arrive at 
residents' doorsteps as easily as home-delivered pizzas. Bicycle lanes would 
take up half the city streets and replace the car as the preferred mode of 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
As do Saudi Arabians, Venturans would drink purified seawater instead of the 
fresh water preferred by the rest of the world. Thanks to environmental 
conservation programs, the California condor would be just as common a sight in 
Ventura as the California sea gull. Ventura County would be home not only to a 
four-year university, but to a Tuttle-coached track team that would win the 
national championship. 
</P>
<P>
Such a scenario may seem far-fetched, but Tuttle told fellow council members 
that it can be accomplished with careful planning, during this council's first 
Visions for Ventura study session held Tuesday at the Clocktower Inn. 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle's vision failed to provoke much of a reaction. Councilwoman Cathy Bean 
noted that "counting on technology to solve all of our problems is a cop-out." 
</P>
<P>
With that, the council members moved on to the next subject: the age-old 
paradox of how to stop growth when slow-growth policies make cities attractive 
to prospective newcomers. Nobody could come up with an answer. 
</P>
<P>
So it went at the Visions session -- government officials outlined paradoxes 
and spelled out dreams but not much else was accomplished. City Manager John 
Baker -- who organized the session to have a better idea of what the council 
members wanted to accomplish during their tenure in office -- said that unless 
the council begins refining visions into goals, there is no real point in 
continuing the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Although a previous council held a similar meeting, it was the first time for 
this group of members, and Baker declared the exercise a success. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of it might be pie-in-the-sky," he said, "but you have to start 
somewhere. Most of the council members said 'there may be no solution to this, 
but at least I can do some dreaming.' " 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Jim Monahan decided that he had better things to do Tuesday 
evening than dream: He skipped the Visions session and attended a St. Patrick's 
Day parade meeting instead. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we should get our heads in the real world and start worrying about the 
issues facing us today," Monahan said. "I think sharing visions is useful if we 
keep it in the realm of reality and plan for the short term where we can have 
an influence." 
</P>
<P>
Monahan didn't seem too impressed with Tuttle's vision for Ventura's future. "I 
don't know what Gary was smoking," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle responded that he doesn't necessarily believe all of his dreams will be 
realized, but that "if good things do happen, it's going to be thanks to people 
with vision, not with closed minds." 
</P>
<P>
The council agreed to hold another Visions session in the fall, with possibly 
more sessions to follow.

MCKEON MAKES ROOM FOR RIDDOCH; 
</P>
<P>
PADRES: MOMENTS AFTER HE HAD TURNED OVER THE MANAGER'S JOB TO GREG RIDDOCH, 
TRADER JACK WAS ON THE PHONE IN HIS OTHER JOB SWINGING A DEAL AND PROMISING 
MORE TO COME.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Padre press conference -- announcing that coach Greg Riddoch was replacing 
Jack McKeon immediately as manager -- had barely concluded Wednesday when 
McKeon quietly disappeared through a side door. 
</P>
<P>
Surely, he was looking for a place to be alone, right? Perhaps in this 
emotional time he was leaving to be with his wife, Carol. Maybe he was calling 
his family. 
</P>
<P>
So much for sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
Just 15 minutes later, McKeon was sitting behind his desk as vice 
president/baseball operations, holding a cigar with one hand and a telephone 
receiver with the other, talking trade with any general manager who would 
listen. 
</P>
<P>
It took less than an hour for him to make his first deal since returning 
upstairs -- sending triple-A center fielder Alex Cole to Cleveland for 
left-handed hitting catcher Tom Lampkin -- and he promised at least one major 
trade before his cigar box runs empty. 
</P>
<P>
And he never wants to put on another uniform as long as he lives. 
</P>
<P>
"This is where I belong, this is where I always wanted to be," McKeon said. 
"This is where I can best help the team. I'm sorry I had to go out with the 
record (37-43) we did, but we just didn't produce, and I don't know why. I beat 
my head up against the wall night after night wondering why. 
</P>
<P>
"But I take full blame. I take full responsibility. I'm not going to hide. We 
just didn't play like I thought we would, and I'm responsible for that. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to apologize for anything, but I never wanted to be a long-term 
manager. I just wanted to bring continuity to the team. But I was worn out, 
believe me. I was cheating myself, and I was cheating the organization. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe a change like this will shake things up." 
</P>
<P>
Said Carol, his wife of 36 years: "It's still hard for me to believe. I was in 
shock when he called last night, and I'm still in shock. I was at one of those 
stop-smoking places when he called the house, and as soon as I heard the news, 
what do I do, I picked up a cigarette and started smoking again. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"You know, we never wanted him to go down (to manage) in the first place, but 
once he did, I think we all wanted him to go out winning a pennant. That's 
where I'm disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon became manager May 28, 1988, after firing Larry Bowa. He was 193-164 
during his two-plus seasons, a .541 winning percentage, the best in Padre 
history. Managing in parts of eight major league seasons in Kansas City, 
Oakland and San Diego, he was 479-474 and never won a division title. 
</P>
<P>
Padre chairman Tom Werner, who began contemplating a change this past weekend, 
telephoned McKeon on Monday and asked who should be his successor. McKeon 
didn't hesitate, telling him Riddoch was the best candidate on his staff. 
</P>
<P>
Werner telephoned Riddoch at his Greeley, Colo., home, where he was spending 
the All-Star break, and asked him to fly to his Los Angeles home for dinner. 
Riddoch was interviewed during dinner and returned to Greeley that night. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday morning, Werner decided Riddoch was the man. He arranged for Riddoch to 
fly into Los Angeles again and this time requested the presence of McKeon, who 
skipped the All-Star Game and took a 4 p.m. flight from Chicago. The job was 
offered, and Riddoch, who had not managed since 1981 and never at a higher 
level than the Class A Northwest League, became the 13th manager in Padre 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Riddoch, 44, was provided a new contract for the remainder of the season, and 
the Padres have an option for him in 1991. He was earning about $60,000 as a 
coach but will receive a raise of about $100,000, sources said. Although the 
job is not on an interim basis, it was made clear to Riddoch that he will be 
evaluated at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the manager, not the interim manager," Riddoch said, "and I'm going to 
make it as hard on these people as conceivably can be for them to get rid of 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Riddoch, a popular choice among the players, made it clear in his first minutes 
on the job that it would be his team. He fired hitting coach Amos Otis and 
replaced him with Jack Maloof, the Padres' minor league hitting instructor. He 
also hired Rob Picciolo, their minor league fielding instructor, to replace 
himself on the coaching staff at first. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this was a good move," right fielder Tony Gwynn said. "I think 
everybody knows what he's done for me, and he's done a whole lot for a lot of 
guys in here. I respect the man." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Padres' disappointing first half certainly helped trigger the 
move, it was McKeon's feelings, more than anything else, that led Werner to the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon, in a private July 2 meeting with Werner, requested that he leave the 
field as quickly as possible and assume the sole role of general manager. 
Werner said he would take the request under advisement but did not plan an 
immediate change. 
</P>
<P>
But when McKeon's request was reported in a story in The Times on July 3, it 
accelerated the process. McKeon addressed his team in a meeting before that 
day's home game against Pittsburgh to squelch the report, telling the players 
he would remain the rest of the season. But it was too late. The damage had 
been done. Werner had to make a move. 
</P>
<P>
"From the standpoint on what was happening in the clubhouse, everybody was 
expecting a change," said Pat Dobson, Padre pitching coach. "And when that 
didn't happen right away -- I'm not saying it was a disappointment, but it left 
everybody in limbo." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres kept losing, dropping nine of 11 games before the All-Star break, 
and more and more players were expressing their dissatisfaction by the day. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to make a change," one player said, "because we weren't going anywhere 
under Jack. It was a circus, an absolute circus. It was a country club 
atmosphere. Guys didn't even care any more. 
</P>
<P>
"Our batting practice was a joke. And infield, whenever we took it, was a 
joke." 
</P>
<P>
But the player demanded anonymity, saying, "They don't call him Trader Jack for 
nothing. He may not be down here any more, but that doesn't stop him from 
trading us." 
</P>
<P>
Several players, also expressing an anonymous viewpoint for the same reason, 
said problems were also caused by a June, 1989, team meeting, at which McKeon 
publicly chastised catcher Benito Santiago, and Santiago responded angrily and 
obscenely. 
</P>
<P>
"We just kept sitting there, waiting for Jack to do something, but he didn't do 
a thing," one player said. "We couldn't believe Benny could say that to a 
manager and get away with it. I mean, he wasn't even benched. Nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"After that happened, I think a lot of guys around here knew they could get 
away with whatever they wished, and believe me, a few guys did." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon -- who did not receive a contract extension but will continue being paid 
$400,000 this season and $400,000 through the 1991 season -- was well aware of 
this constant criticism that he was too lenient. He said he didn't understand 
this need for motivating $3-million players, that being in a major league 
uniform should be enough inducement. 
</P>
<P>
Riddoch, a former psychology teacher who also has a master's degree in 
education administration, is not promising miracles but says he does understand 
the wants and needs of today's major league players. 
</P>
<P>
"Today's player wants to know the advantage of doing it your way, or the way 
you are suggesting," Riddoch said. "You better be able to sell them. . . . We 
need to play baseball like we did as kids, for the love of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Riddoch was the only man interviewed for the job, Werner said, although Dobson 
also was considered a viable candidate. But Dobson has a close relationship 
with Riddoch, and showed no bitterness. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I'm not disappointed," Dobson said. "It's obvious a change had to be made, 
and when you've been through the wars like Greg, he's very qualified to do the 
job. I told Greg all along that I thought he'd get the job before I did. It's a 
lot more sensible for him to do the job than for me to do it and also try to 
handle my pitching staff." 
</P>
<P>
Dobson, 48, still would like to be a major league manager and will continue to 
manage once again in the Senior League this winter. He secretly signed a 
contract extension in December, according to sources in the Major League 
Players Assn., that will pay him $75,000 in 1990 and 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Otis, meanwhile, said that he immediately will begin looking for a job in 
another organization. He has been the Padres' batting coach the past three 
seasons and said that his dismissal was not a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"When guys start bringing in their old batting coaches to help them," Otis 
said, referring to Joe Carter summoning Bobby Bonds for help, "you know 
something's up. I'm not bitter. This is part of business. A new manager wants 
his own people, and I'm an easy target." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Padres will purchase the contract of third baseman Eddie Williams today 
from triple-A Las Vegas and are expected to make room for him by optioning 
backup catcher Ronn Reynolds to triple-A Las Vegas. The Padres acquired catcher 
Tom Lampkin from the Cleveland Indians' triple-A roster Wednesday afternoon, 
and he's expected to be Mark Parent's backup while All-Star Benito Santiago 
recovers from his broken left arm. Utility infielder Joey Cora was optioned to 
Las Vegas to make room for Lampkin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE NEW PADRE COACHES 
</P>
<P>
Jack Maloof, hitting -- He moves up from minor league hitting instructor to 
replace Amos Otis, who was fired Wednesday. Maloof was in his fifth year 
helping hitters throughout the minor league system. Before that, he managed as 
high as the double-A level for the Padres and won a Texas League championship 
with Wichita in 1983. He never played in the majors despite a lifetime 
professional average of .302. After being drafted out of LaVerne College in 
1971, he batted .402 with Auburn of the New York-Penn League and was named 
Topps minor league player of the year. He finished his playing career with the 
Seibu Lions in Japan in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Picciolo, first base -- Was in his third year as minor league fielding 
instructor after two seasons as manager of the Padres' Spokane affiliate. In 
his second year at Spokane, he was named Northwest League manager of the year 
after the Indians won the championship with a 54-22 record. His major league 
playing career spanned nine seasons, including a full rookie year of 148 games 
at shortstop for Oakland in 1977. He also played for Milwaukee and California, 
then returned to Oakland for the 1985 season before retiring. Picciolo is a 
graduate of Pepperdine.

ALEMANY CHOOSES KELLER TO LEAD BOYS' BASKETBALL TEAM

<TEXT>
<P>
Kurt Keller has been named to replace Rocky Moore as boys' varsity basketball 
coach at Alemany High, said Alemany Athletic Director Dudley Rooney. 
</P>
<P>
Keller, a former standout basketball player at Paso Robles High and Portland 
State, recently completed a four-year playing career in an Australian 
professional basketball league. 
</P>
<P>
"We're real confident with his knowledge of the game and we think he'll adapt 
well," Rooney said. "We need somebody who is a strong motivator and is 
disciplined." 
</P>
<P>
After posting a 12-35 record during two seasons at Alemany, Moore announced his 
resignation in May. He will coach at Muir next season. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney said Keller will need time to turn the Alemany program around. 
</P>
<P>
"He's seen our players play and he has confidence that he's going to improve 
our team," Rooney said. "We're not looking for miracles the first year. We're 
looking for someone who's going to make a long-term commitment to improve our 
program." 
</P>
<P>
The position was initially offered to former Pius X Coach Mike Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
"I really wanted to take it and they were super to me," said Murphy, who said 
he would take the job but then reconsidered. "I decided I wanted to spend some 
time with my two sons." SAM FARMER

EAGLES SOAR IN NATIONAL MEET WITHOUT BENEFIT OF A TOP SPRINTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Unlike previous years' squads, the West Valley Eagles track club has no 
standout sprinter. But that has not prevented the Canoga Park-based team from 
excelling at the national level. 
</P>
<P>
There is no Quincy Watts (the USC standout is too old to compete with the 
Eagles) and no Marion Jones (the Rio Mesa High star is injured) on this year's 
team. Yet last weekend the Eagles sent 13 athletes to The Athletics Congress 
Youth Athletic Championships in Spokane, Wash., and won 39 medals. 
</P>
<P>
Despite winning only one event, the Eagles were the top team in the midget 
boys' and girls' divisions (for 10- and 11-year-olds) in Spokane. 
</P>
<P>
West Valley's lone victory came in the midget boys' 400-meter relay, where 
Larry Phillips, Armone Lochard, Steve Webber and Jalal Milby clocked 49.65 
seconds, only .09 seconds off the national record, according to Coach Roger 
Lipkis. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Granville and Akira Kennett, both 11, were standouts for West Valley. 
Granville placed second in the midget boys' 100 (12.41 seconds), 200 (25.29) 
and 400 (55.22), while Kennett finished second in the midget girls' 80-meter 
low hurdles (13.47), long jump (14 feet 8 inches) and pentathlon (2,568 
points). 
</P>
<P>
Kennett also ran the third leg on the Eagles' 400 relay team, which placed 
third in 51.7. 
</P>
<P>
Granville's performances were doubly impressive, considering that Lipkis had 
recruited him off the baseball diamond only two weeks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw him playing baseball and he looked like he was pretty fast," Lipkis 
said. "So I got him to come out. . . . He's going to be a good one." 
</P>
<P>
West Valley will compete in The Track City International Classic in Eugene, 
Ore., July 20-22, before finishing the season at the TAC Junior Olympics in 
Lincoln, Neb., July 24-29. 
</P>
<P>
Rebuilding: Glendale College, the Western State Conference cross-country 
champion in 1987 and '88, finished second behind Ventura last fall. 
</P>
<P>
However, with four of their top seven runners returning, the addition of one 
prized recruit and the possible addition of another, the Vaqueros could have 
enough firepower to reclaim the WSC title. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ed Lopez, the Glendale coach, Obed Aguirre and Robert Nelson will 
be running for his team in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Both runners have been working out with the team this summer but Aguirre said 
last week that he wouldn't decide between Glendale and Pasadena City College 
until the end of the month. Aguirre, who graduated from San Fernando High last 
month, placed fourth in the 3,200 meters (9 minutes 1.11 seconds) at the state 
track championships in the spring and finished seventh in the state Division I 
cross-country championships last November. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, who attended Pasadena last season, placed 10th in the 1989 Southern 
California junior college regional cross-country championships. 
</P>
<P>
As a senior at Muir High in Pasadena in 1988, Nelson was the runner-up in the 
Southern Section 4-A Division cross-country championships and placed sixth in 
the 3,200 (9:09.20) at the state track meet the following spring. 
</P>
<P>
"With those two coming in and with the runners we have coming back, I think we 
are looking pretty good," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What do Crissy Mills of USC and Campbell Hall High, Walt Stewart 
of Cal State Northridge and Melanie Clarke of Valley College have in common? 
</P>
<P>
Break time: Cindy Byrne, the Southern Section 4-A Division champion in the 
300-meter low hurdles as a Canyon High junior in 1988, withdrew from CSUN last 
fall and has no intentions of returning any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
"I went (to CSUN) for a couple of months and I just wasn't into it like I 
should have been," Byrne said. "I was training well, but I just felt like I 
needed a break." 
</P>
<P>
After clocking 43.47 to win the 4-A title, Byrne appeared capable of 
successfully defending her title as a senior but was declared academically 
ineligible prior to the Southern Section prelims. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when I first felt like I might need a break," Byrne said. "But once the 
summer started, I was back training again. It was like I didn't really have a 
summer last year." 
</P>
<P>
Currently working as a waitress and auditioning for acting roles, Byrne said 
she misses track but doesn't plan to compete again in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually, I'd like to get back into it," she said. "But right now, I'm 
pretty happy doing what I'm doing." 
</P>
<P>
Time passages: Statistically, this has been the best season of Darcy Arreola's 
career. But unless she lowers her personal best in the 1,500 meters at the 
Sports Festival in Minneapolis tonight, it could also be her most frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
Arreola, who redshirted at CSUN in the spring while running for the Nike Coast 
track club, has posted personal bests at 800 meters (2:04.05), the mile 
(4:33.91) and 3,000 meters (9:12.77). She also has run her fastest 5,000 
(16:39) on the roads, but her year-old 1,500 best (4:14.15) has proved elusive. 
</P>
<P>
She ran 4:15 -- the second-fastest time of her career -- off a slow early pace 
to win the Modesto Invitational on May 5. But that remains her season best. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Each has won at least one significant championship in recent 
years while being coached by Charlie DiMarco of the Advantage Athletics Track 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
Mills, who missed her senior season in high school with a knee injury, won the 
girls' high jump at the 1988 and '89 state championships. Stewart won the 1989 
NCAA Division II title in the men's high jump, and Clarke, who also trains with 
Valley Coach James Harvey, won the heptathlon at the state junior college 
championships in May and at The Athletics Congress Junior meet in June.

LEFT-HANDED COMPLIMENTS FADE AS TURNER RECEIVES HIS LONG-DUE RECOGNITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH TOSCHES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Left-handers on a golf course always have evoked certain reactions from other 
golfers. Diving behind the shelter of a golf cart while shrieking in terror is 
a common one. Covering the mouth and smirking is popular. And more than once a 
startled golfer has watched a lefty stand on the first tee and -- not realizing 
he was a lefty -- bellowed, "No, not at the clubhouse!" as the man apparently 
began to launch his drive backwards. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Turner of Woodland Hills, who has a one-stroke lead halfway through the 
Los Angeles City Golf Championships, has had the same feeling watching 
left-handers flail away at a golf ball. 
</P>
<P>
"When I see a lefty, it looks real funny to me," he said. "You see so few 
left-handers out there. Maybe it looks even stranger to me than it does to the 
rest of you. Remember, I see one less lefty playing golf than you do." 
</P>
<P>
Turner, you see, is a lefty. 
</P>
<P>
When he won the L. A. City championship in 1987, it was the first time in the 
tournament's 70-year history that a left-hander had claimed the title. 
Reporters, Southern California Golf Assn. officials, even Turner's friends 
treated the victory no differently than if it had been accomplished by a man 
using gardening tools as clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, however, people have stopped gawking at Turner. Most now see him 
not as a man playing golf backwards, but as a man playing much better than they 
would ever dream of playing. 
</P>
<P>
"It would bother me if that's all people ever talked about," Turner, 33, said. 
"But most of that has subsided now. It used to be that's all I ever heard. 
Things like, 'He's pretty good. For a left-hander.' But now I get some 
recognition just for my golf game." 
</P>
<P>
As he should. 
</P>
<P>
He shot a blistering four-under-par 68 in the opening round of the L. A. City 
championships on Saturday at Griffith Park to tie Ken Cruz of Yorba Linda for 
the lead. A second-round 71 gave him a 139 and a one-stroke lead over Cruz 
heading into the final two rounds Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Another shot back at 141 is Sepulveda's Bob Burns, who shot rounds of 70 and 
71. 
</P>
<P>
Other Valley-area players still within medium-iron distance of Turner include 
Jim Lundstrom of Sepulveda and Bob Riggins of Valencia (145), and Les Johnson 
of Valencia and Jim Jordan of Simi Valley (147). 
</P>
<P>
Turner is a 1981 graduate of Cal State Northridge. He was one of the school's 
top two golfers for three years. The man with whom he alternated as CSUN's No. 
1 player was Vic Wilk, another left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
A victory brings a big trophy. But, as Turner points out, not a trophy of him. 
</P>
<P>
"That's another thing about being a lefty," he said. "All the trophies have 
right-handed golfers standing on top." 
</P>
<P>
Another dance?: Defending champion Paul Stankowski of Oxnard and newly crowned 
state amateur champion Charlie Wi of Thousand Oaks will head the field in the 
91st Southern California Golf Assn. Amateur Championship. 
</P>
<P>
Qualifying begins at 10 courses Monday with the finals to be held July 20-22 at 
Wilshire Country Club in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Stankowski, 20, was knocked out of the 79th state amateur at Pebble Beach two 
weeks ago in the semifinals by Wi, 18. 
</P>
<P>
Wi has a chance to become only the ninth player to win both the state amateur 
title and the Southern California amateur championship and only the second to 
win both in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,100 golfers will begin qualifying play, with just 64 advancing to 
three days of championship play at Wilshire. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two others, including Stankowski, Wi, and Van Nuys' Craig Steinberg -- 
also beaten by Wi in the state amateur -- have earned exemptions into the 
finals. Others who earned exemptions are Thousand Oaks' Lee Davis, the 1989 
SCGA Mid-Amateur champion; Sherman Oaks' David Olsen, who finished in the top 
five in last year's SCGA Amateur championship; Santa Barbara's John Pate, 
brother of PGA Tour player Steve Pate of Simi Valley; Simi Valley's Mitch 
Voges, who finished in the top five of the SCGA Mid-Amateur last year; and 
Thousand Oaks' Chris Zambri, who made it to match play of this year's state 
amateur tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Not even close: Stankowski blasted past the field in last week's Oxnard City 
Championships. The senior at Texas El Paso had rounds of 68 and 72 at the River 
Ridge Golf Club in Oxnard to win by eight strokes over Jeff Knight of 
Camarillo. Brad Halfon of Van Nuys was third at 149.

AMERICAN LEGION ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
WOODLAND HILLS EAST MAINTAINS LEAD WITH WIN IN FINAL AT-BAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second consecutive game, Woodland Hills East, leader of American Legion 
District 20's Western Division, won in its final at-bat. The latest example was 
Wednesday's 3-2 win over Valley Encino-Tarzana at Taft High. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Glen Nahmias provided the key blow, a two-run home run in the bottom of 
the seventh, to make a winner of pitcher Chris Brown (7-3) and preserve East's 
half-game lead over Woodland Hills West. 
</P>
<P>
Nahmias' home run proved especially pleasing for East (17-4) after it was held 
scoreless despite loading the bases with none out in the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Nahmias drove in all three of East's runs with three hits. Jason Mansfield took 
the loss for Valley ET (9-11). 
</P>
<P>
In other District 20 games: 
</P>
<P>
Woodland Hills West 7, Eagle Rock 4 -- Bobby Kim struck a two-run double to 
highlight a four-run seventh inning as West (16-4) came from behind to win at 
Occidental College and remain a half-game behind East. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Treend pitched the seventh inning to earn his second save and preserve the 
win for starter Sean Boldt (5-1). 
</P>
<P>
Kim, Del Marine and Jeff Marks had two hits each for West, which has won 13 in 
a row and 15 of its last 16. Eagle Rock fell to 9-11. 
</P>
<P>
Quartz Hill 8, North Hollywood 4 -- Kendial Armstrong went two for four with a 
triple and a single to lead Quartz Hill (16-5) to victory at North Hollywood 
High. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong drove in two runs and scored twice to support the pitching of Dan 
Bennett (2-0), who threw the final two innings to earn the decision. Jason 
Haner also scored two runs. 
</P>
<P>
For North Hollywood (1-21), Mike Salas had three hits, while Duane Braxton and 
Sammy Ciaramilaro had two hits apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Encino-Crespi 7, Verdugo Hills 3 -- Jeff Suppan allowed just two earned runs 
and scattered seven hits in a game at Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
Suppan (3-4) walked two and struck out six for Encino-Crespi (5-14). Mark 
Hollenbeck went two for three and drove in a run while Casey Snow had two hits 
and scored twice for the winners. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura-Oak Park 7, Newhall-Saugus 5 -- Jason Kane's two-run double in the first 
inning sparked a four-run rally to support the winning pitching of Jeff Gibbons 
(6-2) in a game at Saugus High. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbons (6-2), scattered eight hits for Agoura-Oak Park (10-10). Joey Medaglia 
had three hits for the winners. Dave Bildner had three hits for Newhall-Saugus 
(13-9). 
</P>
<P>
Sun Valley 9, Chatsworth 8 -- Sun Valley, the leader in the Eastern Division, 
took a 6-1 lead in the third inning, then held on in a game at Poly High. 
</P>
<P>
Raul Torres relieved in the sixth inning and pitched shutout ball for his first 
save, preserving starter Robert Flores' win. 
</P>
<P>
Sun Valley (18-2) was helped by multiple-hit days from Wil Molina (two hits, 
two runs, two RBIs); Marlon McKinney (two hits, two runs, one RBI); Roy Lozano 
(two hits, one run, two RBIs) and Torres (two hits). 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth fell to 9-11. 
</P>
<P>
Las Virgenes 7, Studio City 6 -- Las Virgenes (11-10) rallied from a 5-2 
deficit after two innings at Calabasas High. 
</P>
<P>
Right-hander Harold Turk (3-1) allowed two earned runs through 5 1/3 innings, 
striking out one and walking three. Paul Johnson pitched the final 1 1/3 
innings to earn his second save. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 5-2, Las Virgenes scored three runs in the fifth to take the lead for 
good. 
</P>
<P>
Brett Resnick walked with one out and Geordie Wimmer reached base on an error. 
Paul Shaffer drove home Resnick with a sacrifice fly and Sam Voita doubled in 
Wimmer. 
</P>
<P>
Voita then scored when Tom Hoover reached base on a throwing error. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Alvarenga was two for three and Tony Gonzales was three for four for 
Studio City. Hoover was two for three for Las Virgenes. 
</P>
<P>
Studio City fell to 5-16.

ALTERNATE-ENERGY SEARCH POWERS BUSINESS BOOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE YASUDA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The effort by utilities to find new methods of generating electricity -- 
coupled with the public's increasing environmental awareness -- is causing a 
boom for local alternative energy producers and manufacturers of equipment that 
use wind, sun or water to produce electricity. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers such as San Diego-based Kyocera America, which makes solar 
panels, and SeaWest, a local company that develops wind turbine projects, are 
counting on a grass-roots energy awareness movement to boost sales. 
</P>
<P>
Past energy crises have spurred utilities to rely less on fossil fuels and to 
seek new ways of generating electricity, alternative energy advocates say. They 
add that, as consumers become more energy-conscious, they'll become receptive 
to alternative energy products, such as solar-powered recreational vehicles and 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
Utilities are already buying electricity from independent power producers, who 
use wind, solar or hydro power to generate electricity. 
</P>
<P>
"Social responsibility is a major factor these days," said Karen Bernt, 
marketing coordinator for SeaWest, which employs 36 workers in a 
3,000-square-foot leased facility in Mission Valley. "There's a lot of pressure 
on utilities to produce electricity in a cleaner way." 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1981, the closely held wind turbine company produces 260 megawatts 
of electricity annually -- enough to power 60,000 homes -- for Southern 
California Edison and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric. Bernt declined to release 
SeaWest's revenue figures and earnings, but said the company is profitable. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Higgins, a power contract administrator at SDG&amp;E, said the local 
utility is exploring ways to use renewable energy -- sun, wind or water -- but 
added that extensive use of such resources is often limited by what nature 
provides. 
</P>
<P>
"Hydroelectric turbines would be terrific, but we just don't happen to be 
blessed with running water resources that we could tap," Higgins said. "A 
windmill doesn't work for us either, because we don't have areas here that 
produce consistent wind. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a lot of interest already (to produce electricity with 
renewable resources), but in some cases, like solar technology, it isn't 
cost-effective -- yet," Higgins said. 
</P>
<P>
But cost reductions from technological advances and increasing pressure to 
reduce pollution should make solar equipment, for example, attractive to 
utilities in the near future, Higgins said. 
</P>
<P>
"Utilities are being required to put on pollution control equipment," Higgins 
said. "With those additional costs, combined with the cost of solar dropping in 
the future, utilities are going to be moving in their direction." 
</P>
<P>
According to Al Panton, Kyocera's solar sales manager, utilities won't be the 
only ones turning to photovoltaic (PV) modules -- panels that convert sunlight 
to electricity. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of producing solar panels has already dropped to the point that it is 
cost-efficient for houses in remote areas to use solar technology rather than 
conventional generators, Panton said. 
</P>
<P>
"Typically, someone on a utility grid can buy a kilowatt hour of electricity 
for 8 to 10 cents," Panton said. "But it will cost you between 25 cents and up 
to $1 per kilowatt hour if you're using a standard gasoline generator. With a 
PV module, it'll cost you 50 cents per kilowatt hour. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides the cost savings, you don't have to worry about fueling and 
maintenance, either," Panton said. "Solar panels are maintenance-free. There's 
no moving parts." 
</P>
<P>
Such convenience and reduced costs have already helped increase Kyocera's solar 
panel sales. In 1989, Kyocera posted revenues of $10 million, doubling 1988 
revenue. Panton said the company expects to hit $20 million in revenues this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Kyocera America is the San Diego-based subsidiary of Kyocera Corp. of Kyoto, a 
$3-billion multinational company specializing in high-technology ceramics. 
</P>
<P>
Kyocera America, founded in 1969 in Silicon Valley and moved to San Diego two 
years later, also manufactures ceramic packages that house computer chips used 
for computers and electronic equipment. Kyocera America employs 1,200 employees 
at its 300,000-square-foot facility in Kearny Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Kyocera's photovoltaic modules are made of silicon cells coated with special 
chemicals that, when struck by sunlight, activate electrons that move along the 
wires, generating electricity. Kyocera's standard model is a 51-watt panel, 18 
inches by 39 inches, that produces 220 watt hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
Although the cost of the panel has dropped to $350 from a $650 in 1983, Panton 
concedes that it is still not economical for the typical resident to convert 
his house to solar power. 
</P>
<P>
According to an SDG&amp;E study, a typical home in San Diego uses 450 kilowatt 
hours per month, Panton said. "That would require 60 panels . . . at an 
installed cost of $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why we're currently focusing on people who live off the utility grid," 
Panton said. "But it's already applicable for boats and RVs." 
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, however, Panton said solar panels will be producing 
electricity at a rate equivalent to utilities. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point, we're hoping developers will begin putting PV modules in their 
new homes," Panton said.

HOMEFED IS STILL SLIPPING, STOCK DROPS 47% IN MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HomeFed Corp. stock continued to slide Wednesday, losing $.50 to close at 
$17.50 in New York Stock Exchange trading. HomeFed stock has now lost 47% of 
its value since June 14, when it closed at $33 a share. 
</P>
<P>
A HomeFed spokeswoman said the company, which is the parent of 211-branch 
HomeFed Bank savings and loan, said it knows of no recent news or events that 
could have triggered the stock's fall in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
However, HomeFed announced last month an increase in nonperforming assets, and 
the spokeswoman said the stock market may be anticipating a negative earnings 
impact of the increase in bad loans. HomeFed expects to release its 
second-quarter earnings statement July 18. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street has turned increasingly skittish about S&amp;L stocks in general 
because of fears about possible deflation in California real estate. Dropping 
real estate values generally lower the security of home loans and make its 
harder for lenders to recoup their loans. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed, with $18.2 billion in assets, reported an $81-million increase in its 
nonperforming loans during May. An increase in nonperforming loans -- those in 
foreclosure or delinquent 90 days or more -- often cause an S&amp;L to set 
aside additional loan-loss reserves, which reduce earnings.

The addition of May's bad loans brought HomeFed's total nonperformers to $579 
million, or 3.12% of assets, as of May 31.

The S&amp;L parent company also said last month that it was reviewing its 
entire loan portfolio to ascertain whether its under-performing loans had been

S.D.'S BIGGEST DEFENSE CONTRACTORS SPARED STING OF CUTS; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: THE KEY TO RESILIENCY IS THE HIGH-TECH NATURE OF THE WORK, SUCH AS 
COMPUTERS AND SPACE SYSTEMS.

The "peace dividend" is a double-edged sword that has already begun cutting a 
wide swath through many companies dependent on defense contracts. But San Diego 
County's largest defense companies, including General Dynamics and Cubic Corp., 
so far have been spared substantial cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see any near-term (contract cuts)," said General Dynamics spokesman 
Jack Isabel. "It is unclear what the long term will look like." 
</P>
<P>
General Dynamics, San Diego's largest defense contractor with 17,500 local 
employees, has laid off only 114 workers in the last six months, or less than 
1% of its local work force, Isabel said. Those layoffs include all local pink 
slips issued to General Dynamics employees, including non-defense-related 
contracts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The defense giant makes Tomahawk cruise missiles, Atlas rocket boosters and 
electronic weapons systems in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Cubic Corp. has laid off about 50 of its 1,100 defense-related employees in the 
last six months because of cuts in small contracts, spokesman Jerry Ringer 
said. Cubic last week received a $34-million contract from the Army for a 
Combat Maneuvering Training Center, a training program that tracks and analyzes 
troop movements in the field, but the contract will not necessarily generate 
jobs, Ringer said. 
</P>
<P>
Ringer said about 42% of Cubic's revenues are defense-related, and that figure 
is expected to remain about the same. 
</P>
<P>
However, Teledyne Ryan Aeronautical appears to be an unlucky casualty in the 
thawing of the Cold War. The 1,500-employee division of Los Angeles-based 
Teledyne may soon suffer a 60% slash in its defense-related revenue because its 
contract with the Army to build Apache helicopter frames, a mainstay of the 
company since 1983, expires in 1993, spokesman Ken Carson said. 
</P>
<P>
The local Teledyne division depends almost exclusively on defense contracts, 
Carson said. 
</P>
<P>
The company has laid off 125 people in the last few months as production of the 
helicopter frames has slowed from a peak of 12 frames per month to six per 
month, Carson said. The prospects for a replacement contract to stave off huge 
layoffs look grim. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at commercial contracting, but that's a pretty tough arena," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Carson said it is difficult to say for sure that the layoffs are a result of 
the peace dividend, since Teledyne's helicopter contract with the Army was to 
have run out in 1993 anyway. But the company had hoped for an extension of the 
contract. Instead, the number was scaled back last year, and renewal of the 
contract is not expected, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were hoping that the Apache would go on until the year 2000," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Teledyne Ryan's other major defense contract, the Firebee jet-powered pilotless 
practice target, appears safe for at least the next five years, Carson said. 
</P>
<P>
A significant downturn in U.S. defense spending seems inevitable with the 
lessening of tension between the United States and the Soviet Union, and many 
major defense contractors including Northrop and Lockheed are scrambling to 
compensate for the loss of government dollars. 
</P>
<P>
But both Ringer and Isabel said their companies have no plans for major shifts 
away from defense contracts into the private sector, and they expect their 
companies to survive the military belt-tightening with little pain. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that we will get through OK," Ringer said. "We are probably in the 
right businesses in our defense subsidiary." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, growth in local defense spending has already begun to slow 
noticeably. 
</P>
<P>
A recent report by the San Diego Chamber of Commerce shows that defense-related 
expenditures in the county increased by only 0.7% in 1989 to $9.7 billion, 
significantly lower than the double-digit growth earlier in the decade, said 
Kelly Cunningham, senior research analyst for the Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Defense spending, which last year accounted for nearly one-fifth of the 
county's gross regional product, or the sum total of goods and services 
produced, is still the second largest component in the local economy behind the 
$13-billion manufacturing segment, Cunningham said. The county led the nation 
in Defense Department wages during fiscal year 1989 and was eighth in defense 
procurement contracts, the report states. 
</P>
<P>
The key to San Diego's resilience to defense cuts is the high-technology nature 
of many of the defense contracts being worked on here, Cunningham said. 
Contracts for computers, communication equipment, space systems, electronics 
and training equipment have largely dodged the defense budget ax, Cunningham 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in San Diego in April, Defense Secretary Richard Cheney 
said the county may have to brace for some future cuts, but the bottom will not 
fall out of the defense dollars coming in. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego has been, is now, and will continue to be an absolutely crucial part 
of U.S. naval posture and our military establishment, and that's not going to 
change," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego's favor is that virtually all of the military personnel stationed 
in the area are Navy-related, the branch of the armed forces the Defense 
Department seems most reluctant to cut. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Navy and Marine Corps personnel levels nationwide are reduced, San 
Diego may not be affected because the bases here are high military priorities, 
Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
"They're likely to close the marginal bases, but at the major ones, like in San 
Diego, they might even increase personnel," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials say that so far, there have not been any major, permanent 
personnel cuts in the county but some minor reductions have already occurred, 
with more scheduled to come. 
</P>
<P>
The aircraft carrier Constellation, with 2,500 uniformed personnel and one of 
three aircraft carriers stationed here, left for Philadelphia in March for a 
two-year major overhaul, said Bob Howard, assistant public affairs officer for 
the Command Naval Air Force Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
About 760 Navy personnel will leave San Diego in the fall when the destroyer 
Hoel is decommissioned and the dock landing ship Alamo leaves for Brazil, said 
Mike McLellan, assistant public affairs officer for the Command Naval Surface 
Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
McLellan hinted that it is possible that some of the 61 other surface ships 
based in San Diego could leave, but he would release no further information. 
</P>
<P>
The military is the county's largest single employer, with 170,000 active duty 
and civilian people receiving $4.1 billion in wages in 1989, according to the 
Chamber of Commerce report. 
</P>
<P>
Overall unemployment in the county has been shrinking steadily from a high of 
9.3% in 1982, said Jack Nowell, labor market analyst for the state employment 
development department. Last year's 3.9% unemployment rate was one of the best 
in the state, he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, for the last four years the electronics industry -- much of it 
defense-related -- has been the most noticeable exception to the employment 
boom in the county, he said. The loss of 800 electronics-related jobs in May of 
this year "may be indicative of a trend," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nowell said he did not know if the job losses are connected to the peace 
dividend, and "probably have more to do with national trends in the industry."

BEST BETS: KEEPING NEW MOMS FIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In this day and age of stress awareness and physical fitness, employers are 
spending big bucks to help workers alleviate stress in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
But what if you are a new mom and your work is home, sweet, home? 
</P>
<P>
Beginning July 19, Port Hueneme's Recreation Department will offer the first of 
four weekly classes for mothers and children designed to address women's 
physical and emotional needs as well as their practical needs. The 1 1/2-hour 
class will meet Thursdays at 11 a.m. at the Port Hueneme Cultural Center. 
</P>
<P>
After a brisk walk along the beach or through the park, the group will return 
to the center for an informal rap session. Among the topics will be coping with 
daily stress, how to set up a baby-sitting exchange and places to go for 
discount children's clothing. 
</P>
<P>
"Each week, there will be a different speaker, such as a child psychologist or 
pediatrician, to share information. But the main focus of the group will be on 
fitness," said Brady Cherry, director of recreation and community services in 
Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
"Many mothers are very concerned about getting back into shape after childbirth 
and also about proper nutrition. The idea was to get some kind of a program 
going that would get them on the right track." 
</P>
<P>
Cost for the four-week session is $16 and can be paid at the first class. 
Children are welcome to attend. For information, call 986-6584 or 986-6592.

WHAT'S FRESH: BUYING OPPORTUNITIES; 
</P>
<P>
IN FINE FUNGUS; 
</P>
<P>
MUSHROOMS ADD A CULTURED TOUCH TO BANQUETS AND BARBECUES AND CAN BE HAD ON 
HARVEST DAY.

Mild tasting and Vitamin-B rich, fungi are grown aplenty right here in Ventura 
County and are available the day of harvest. 
</P>
<P>
Sold under the better-known mushroom title, the whitish-capped, stout-stalked 
fungus makes its way into a plethora of recipes -- from sauces to shish kebab 
skewers. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent tour of Ventura Mushrooms, Agricultural Manager Manuel Castro 
outlined its process of growing mushrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all you need horse manure. We truck all of ours in daily from the 
Santa Anita and Hollywood race tracks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
To be useful for mushroom culture, Castro said, manure must be composted for 
about 19 days. 
</P>
<P>
Composted manure is moved indoors and heaped onto wood-framed beds that are 
stacked to the ceiling of a two-story building. Ventura Mushrooms -- a 
subsidiary of United Foods -- uses 84 temperature-controlled sheds to produce 
mushrooms year-round. 
</P>
<P>
"The rooms are heated to 140 degrees for two hours in order to kill any 
competing molds," Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
Next, air-conditioning cools the beds to room temperature (75 degrees to 80 
degrees) and specially processed millet is tilled into the manure, providing 
the catalyst for an extensive network of threadlike mold growth -- from which 
the mushrooms are born. Covered with plastic to retain moisture, enhancing the 
growth of mold, the beds are kept at a constant temperature of 64 degrees for 
15 days. 
</P>
<P>
The plastic is removed and an inch of peat moss is strewn across the top. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, tiny "pin" mushrooms appear. 
</P>
<P>
At this stage, it will be one week before mushrooms bloat sufficiently for 
harvesting. 
</P>
<P>
Workers climb the series of bunk-bed-like structures, slicing the mushrooms at 
the stem one-by-one, 350,000 pounds a week. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura Mushrooms sells them the same day at its small market on the production 
site at 4440 Olivas Park Road, Ventura. Mushrooms are selling for about $2 a 
pound. 
</P>
<P>
Roadside stand patrons may be interested to know that two more have recently 
joined the ranks. 
</P>
<P>
The K.B. Hall Ranch fruit stand, 11999 Ojai Santa Paula Road in the upper Ojai 
Valley, has been around for decades, but used to be open only for its organic 
apricot season. "It used to be opened for just three weeks a year, and we've 
just opened year-round," said Russ Delando, a farmer and manager of the stand. 
All organic fruits and vegetables are now featured. He offered this tip for his 
Italian red garlic: 
</P>
<P>
Take a third of a cup of olive oil and add three to four crushed cloves. Let it 
sit for 15 minutes. Pour oil over greens and toss for a light coating. Sprinkle 
salt, pepper, vinegar and lemon juice to taste. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Carpenter and four other farmers opened a stand three weeks ago at 
Telephone Road and Olivas Park Drive in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt there was a need and a market in the area to provide people with a 
choice," Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
The stand offers a wide selection of all-organic fruits and vegetables. RODNEY

<P>
LESSONS: SOME INSTRUCTORS BELIEVE YOU'RE ALMOST NEVER TOO YOUNG FOR YOUR FIRST 
DIP.

Hello, beautiful! Got any plans for the summer? Just going to lie there and 
bask in the adulation of family and friends? Aren't you tired of that yet? You 
must be at least a month old by now. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's time you thought about swimming lessons. I mean, getting out there 
and earning some of that praise. 
</P>
<P>
Let me tell you what's available. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, for the very young, there's Marjean's Swimland. It's nothing 
fancy. Just a T-shaped pool in the back of a Santa Paula home. The pool-side 
atmosphere is similar in atmosphere to a family reunion. Everyone's wide-eyed 
and smiling. It's as if they feel they are participating in some kind of 
miracle. Proud parents hoist their minicams. Children of all ages splash, swim 
and play games. Sometimes their grandmothers, who have just learned themselves, 
swim with them. 
</P>
<P>
And standing in the middle of all this activity, shoulder-deep in water is 
Marjean Tinoco. 
</P>
<P>
Marjean -- forget the Tinoco, she's one of those one-name people, like Cher -- 
has a gift for teaching people how to swim. She's known for teaching the 
unteachable -- the disabled, the epileptics, the 90-year-old grandmothers. 
</P>
<P>
But most of all she's known for successfully teaching infants. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Marjean has four young students and their mothers in the pool with her. 
Dylan is 11 weeks old, Raquel 10 weeks, Jeanette 7 weeks, Chelsea 5 weeks. 
Laura is the old pro of the group at 5 months. 
</P>
<P>
They're not the only ones in the pool. Two preschool boys splash in the shallow 
end. A nervous 2-year-old girl hangs on Marjean's back. Marjean moves from 
child to child, holding, chiding, calling bluffs. She has an eagle eye, knows 
exactly what's going on at every moment with each child, what they need, when 
they're ready. She's part traffic cop, part water guru. Screaming, fearful 
babies and children whose parents cannot calm them come to Marjean's broad and 
suntanned shoulder and stop their screaming. And then she gives them her gift. 
</P>
<P>
With each child it's different. She takes the infants one by one, puts them on 
her shoulder, talks to them, calms and reassures them, then gives them a gentle 
push toward their waiting mothers. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe in going slow and lots of praise," says Marjean, who spends 12 to 13 
hours in her pool, six days a week. 
</P>
<P>
"She's an excellent teacher," says Dr. Geoffrey Loman, a family practitioner in 
Ventura. His daughter Rebecca, now 6, began swimming with Marjean at 8 months. 
His twin sons Hailey and Daniel, now 2, began swimming at about 5 months. 
</P>
<P>
Denise Lukens of Somis has three daughters who learned to swim with Marjean. "I 
put them in as soon as their belly buttons fall off," Lukens says. "Whatever 
Marjean's doing, she's doing it right. My kids never cry in the pool, except 
when they have to get out." 
</P>
<P>
Marjean has been teaching for 37 years, 20 of them in Ventura County. She had 
polio as a child, wore braces until she was 10 and began swimming to regain the 
use of her muscles. She started teaching when she was 16, using the Red Cross 
method for a few years, gradually developing her own style. 
</P>
<P>
She taught her children, Cindy and Joe, to swim when each was 4 days old and 
Marjean discovered her calling. 
</P>
<P>
Why start a child swimming so early? 
</P>
<P>
"They learn breath control and are never afraid of the water," Marjean says. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Garrett, who has been teaching at the Pierpont Racquet Club in Ventura 
for 12 summers, says the ideal water temperature for infants is as close to 
body temperature as possible. That eliminates most pools for infants right off 
the bat. The pool at Marjean's Swimland is 95 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The pool at Pierpont Racquet Club is heated to about 85 degrees. According to 
Garrett, a child needs about four months to build up the necessary body fat for 
that temperature. So Garrett's classes begin at four months. 
</P>
<P>
In all swim classes for children 2 and under, parental participation is 
required by law. "Non-swimming parents can do it, too," Garrett says. "You 
never have to go into deep water. You just have to be comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
Garrett also stresses two important prerequisites for parents before enrolling 
their children in any swimming class. 
</P>
<P>
"Be sure the instructor has a Red Cross Water Safety Instructor certificate and 
has taught children before," Garrett says. "And talk to your doctor first."

DOCTORS WARN OF RISKS IN LESSONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEO SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though taking children younger than 2 out for a swim can be great recreation 
and fun, local pediatricians agree that there are risks, even for those who 
have had lessons. 
</P>
<P>
Most dangerous is the false sense of security some parents experience after a 
young child has undergone instruction. 
</P>
<P>
"Lessons shouldn't take the place of vigilance," said Dr. Mark Freedenberg, who 
practices in Oxnard and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents think that if there's an accident, they can relax and the child will 
dog paddle to the side. Some children have a natural diving reflex when they 
get submerged, but not all of them hold their breath." 
</P>
<P>
Though Freedenberg enrolled his two children in swimming classes at 1 year old, 
he questions whether any learning actually takes place. 
</P>
<P>
"They may, in a supervised environment, go from one adult to another adult, but 
if they fall in the water and it's a surprise, it may be different. And they 
may fall in head-first or backward." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Harris, a pediatrician in Ventura, said even infants and toddlers who 
learn to handle themselves in the water have no sense of safety. 
</P>
<P>
"They may have some experience, but they don't have judgment," he said.

My first job out of school was with the government. So it was no surprise to me 
to hear recently that the biggest "export" of the District of Columbia is waste 
paper. We used to refer to the trash basket as "the circular file," always 
hankering to move things in that direction and out of our harried lives. Now, 
it turns out, what we were putting into that container was one of the valuable 
commodities in the office. 
</P>
<P>
This is a column about the virtues of recycling at your place of business, so 
let's get to the bottom line right away. If you collect your used computer 
paper you can sell it for over $100 a ton (and the buyer picks it up). For your 
copy and letterhead grades, it's $30. If you can do something to cut trash in 
half -- say, from two dumpsters down to one -- that's $75 or more a month that 
stays in the bank. And if you're thinking that all of this is something for 
your boss to worry about then consider this: As a taxpayer, if you start using 
separate bins for the recyclables at work, you can keep down future garbage 
fees and the threat of new landfills. 
</P>
<P>
Waste paper accounts for nearly 40% of what's choking our landfills. America is 
making progress intercepting the newsprint part of the flow and getting it 
recycled. We'll be up to 50% with old corrugated boxes and computer paper. 
So-called "mixed paper" is the next target. Not only should we be keeping it 
out of our landfills, we will need it as a resource. The paper industry is 
gearing up to fill orders for ever more paper -- up from 14 million tons to 25 
million in one decade. That's not counting newsprint, by the way. To fill the 
need, industry (for raw material reasons) and government (for landfill reasons) 
are trying to get us to recycle 40% of our mixed papers by the middle of this 
decade. That means office recycling, folks. 
</P>
<P>
This summer several communities in the county are going to start intercepting 
what is usually passed from the desk to the dump. Last week the city of 
Thousand Oaks decided to promote a "business recycling starter kit," and to set 
an example it began recycling throughout City Hall. In a spirit of what you 
could call "doctor heal thyself," the city is providing special recycling boxes 
for each employee's desk and also placing labeled collection containers 
throughout the building. 
</P>
<P>
Grahame Watts, the city's recycling coordinator, provided me (and his 
co-workers) with a really nifty turn of phrase for figuring out how to get 
thinking about this sort of thing. "No Stickies" is written on one group of 
containers, the ones on the desk. "Stickies" is on another, elsewhere in the 
office. He wants you to get up from your desk if you have a burger container, 
wad of gummed labels or sugary coffee cup to toss, and walk over to "stickies." 
</P>
<P>
Anything containing dampness or glue or grease is a "sticky" and unrecyclable. 
The container on your desk is for letters, copy paper, even junk mail -- all 
recyclable. I already mentioned the aristocrats of waste paper (computer 
print-outs) and they have their own bin. There are also bins for redemption 
cans and bottles. There's a bin for newspapers but Watts said it doesn't get 
much business. At night, the custodians transfer all this stuff -- now 
designated "clean load," another nifty phrase -- to storage bins. A contractor 
(Simi Valley Recycling) takes it to the Ventura City Intermediate Processing 
Center. This fall, Watts says, his City Hall will begin buying paper supplies 
only if they are made from recycled fiber. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the county there are examples of business involvement already up 
and running. Taking the no-stickies thing a step farther, Ventura's high 
profile, environmentally oriented manufacturer Patagonia last year simply 
stopped using most stickies -- i.e., it got rid of its disposables. The company 
no longer carries paper cups and plates (or plastic) in the cafeteria, using 
regular plates, glasses and tableware instead. And in its child-care center, 
cloth diapers. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, its program is similar to the Thousand Oaks effort, especially the 
part about having each employee sort his own stuff at the source, rather than 
hiring people to sort somewhere down the line. If this sounds like lots of 
trouble, consider the results. Patagonia claims to have cut its trash by 60%. 
Sure, that company's workers were probably already candidates for Heros of 
Recycling medals when they started working there. But hey, a good example at 
this time in the garbage crisis is an inspiration to us civilians. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, Watts' Business Recycling Starter Kits are intended only for Conejo 
Valley firms. But by August, the city of Ventura will have a similar program of 
its own. Oxnard is already working with businesses to generate "clean loads." 
But county businesses will be well served if they contact their municipalities 
now (see Details). And I mean well served in the strictest sense. The recycling 
people being brought on by local municipalities are, I have discovered, "no 
stickies" themselves. They do not gum you up or dampen your enthusiasm. I wish 
there had been more of them around when I was in government. 
</P>

LOBERO THEATRE'S 'TRIAL BY JURY' IS GILBERT AND SULLIVAN AT THEIR EARLIEST AND 
PERHAPS FUNNIEST.

History definitely tends to repeat itself. It may take some time, but it 
eventually gets around to it. 
</P>
<P>
Back in 1875 lyricist William Gilbert and songwriter Arthur Sullivan introduced 
the comic operetta "Trial by Jury" at the Royalty Theatre in London. About two 
years later the show made an appearance at the Jose Lobero Theatre in Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
In the 115 years since then, the Lobero has dropped the Jose from its name, but 
not the operetta from its stage. On Saturday and Sunday the Gilbert and 
Sullivan Company of Santa Barbara will do its version of the first published 
work by the two men. 
</P>
<P>
The group is made up of about 60 performers, some with professional experience, 
who have put on two Gilbert and Sullivan operettas each year since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
When it debuted, the 40-minute "Trial by Jury" was the opening act to a main 
show. As luck would have it, it got spectacular reviews, better than those 
received by the main attraction. Theater owner Richard D'Oyly Carte, knowing a 
good money-making opportunity when he saw it, signed Gilbert and Sullivan to a 
contract to produce a certain number of shows. 
</P>
<P>
The rest is history. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Trial by Jury' is kind of a spoof on the whole legal system of Victorian 
England," said Bill Budd, who plays the judge in the operetta and is the 
founder of the Santa Barbara theater group. "It's a court scene with a breach 
of promise suit going on in the courtroom -- the guy agreed to marry the girl 
and then decides not to. The jury is supposed to be unbiased but it's 
definitely not, because of the loveliness of our plaintiff." 
</P>
<P>
The comedy, which has no spoken dialogue, just music and song, involves a 
courtroom tussle between defendant and plaintiff that is so messy the judge 
decides to settle things by marrying the woman himself. 
</P>
<P>
"The jokes are as current today as they were when they wrote them more than 100 
years ago," Budd said. 
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old Budd has been doing Gilbert and Sullivan since he was a 
teen-ager in New York. It would be safe to say he's a fanatic of the duo. 
</P>
<P>
"They are a unique combination. Gilbert has some of the funniest writing, and 
Sullivan's music is beautiful," he said. "The fact that it has lasted over a 
century makes it unique. People who are into Gilbert and Sullivan are kind of 
nutsy in a way. They'll go anywhere to see a show. We've got a regular who's 
coming in from Phoenix." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to "Trial by Jury," the cast will present an original piece titled 
"Gilbert's Dream." 
</P>
<P>
Co-written by Budd and Anne Anderson, the group's orchestra conductor, it's a 
fictional discussion between Gilbert and theater owner Carte. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of fights between Gilbert and Sullivan. They never got 
together socially. They were in it for the money, basically," Budd said. "In 
'Gilbert's Dream' Carte is trying to convince Gilbert to stick with it. Carte 
has moved himself into the future and has seen that the works are popular for 
100 years." 
</P>
<P>
To demonstrate this popularity, Carte takes Gilbert to the Lobero Theatre in 
1990, where cast members, situated in the audience, perform some Gilbert and 
Sullivan songs. 
</P>
<P>
* WHERE AND WHEN: "Trial by Jury" will be performed on Saturday at 8 p.m. and 
on Sunday at 2 p.m. Tickets are $8.50 (general admission) and $6.50 (seniors 
and children). The Lobero Theatre is located at 33 E. Canon Perdido, 963-0761.

MUSIC: RICKIE LEE JONES / LYLE LOVETT; 
</P>
<P>
JAZZ &amp; HOTFOOTS; 
</P>
<P>
TWO VERY DIFFERENT STYLES, BUT SUNDAY'S RICKIE LEE JONES AND LYLE LOVETT 
CONCERT IS NO MISMATCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It'll be easy to tell the Rickie Lee Jones fans from the Lyle Lovett fans 
Sunday at The Santa Barbara County Bowl. Jones' fans will be mostly serious 
young women, liberal English lit major types who will hang on every phrase and 
be quick to say, "Shhh, Rickie Lee is singing." Lovett's fans will be the ones 
giving them hotfoots. Or laughing. 
</P>
<P>
While this bill is not a mismatch similar to The Surf Punks and Journey, both 
artists offer different interpretations of what it's all about. Jones is jazzy, 
spacey and introspective. Lovett is country and blues -- and funny. 
</P>
<P>
Just look at his hair. Is he the Woody Woodpecker of Texas country and Western 
singers? Would a cowboy hat fit over all that hair? 
</P>
<P>
Grammy award-winning Lovett, obviously, isn't your basic country and Western 
singer. He's a real live Texan -- born, raised and still living in Klein (near 
Houston). He has a journalism degree from Texas A&amp;M and did graduate work 
in German. He wears cowboy boots and drives a pickup truck. Since his 1986 
debut album, critics have been trying to decide just what sort of music Lovett 
plays. Sure, it's country, but . . . 
</P>
<P>
Even cowboys get the blues. Lovett's songs often deal with love -- love lame, 
love lousy, love on the lam, getting the picture? It's not exactly traditional 
country cryin' in your beer music, but maybe laughing in your beer. From "She's 
No Lady," a sample line: 
</P>
<P>
"The preacher asked her and she said 'I do.' 
</P>
<P>
The preacher asked me and she said, 'Yes he does too.' 
</P>
<P>
And the preacher said, 'I pronounce you 99 to life 
</P>
<P>
Son she's no lady she's your wife . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
Lovett began performing when he was in the ninth grade with some other Future 
Farmers of America pals. Then, while in college, he began writing songs and 
became your basic introspective singer/songwriter. His big break came in, of 
all places, Luxembourg in 1983. Invited to play at a country music festival, 
Lovett hooked up with J. David Sloan and The Rogues, a band from Phoenix. Back 
in the states, the band backed Lovett; they made a tape, got signed to MCA 
records, and three songs off his 1986 debut disc made the country Top 20. 
</P>
<P>
Members of The Rogues still form the core of the current ensemble Lyle Lovett 
and His Large Band. It's not exactly a a cast of thousands but The Large Band 
is pretty large with nine members. They can play blues, jazz or rock in 
addition to country plus all the variations between. 
</P>
<P>
From "Here I Am," another sample lyric: 
</P>
<P>
"If Ford is to Chevrolet 
</P>
<P>
What Corn Flakes are to Post Toasties 
</P>
<P>
What the clear blues sky is to the deep blue sea 
</P>
<P>
What Hank Williams is to Neil Armstrong 
</P>
<P>
Can you doubt we were made for each other . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Sort of John Prine meets Randy Newman, Lovett is your basic crossover artist. 
In other words, don't expect the cowboy hat, pointy shoes crowd. He's got three 
albums now, each outselling its predecessor, putting him on his way to wherever 
he's going. For now, it's the every-seat-is-a-great-seat tree-lined Santa 
Barbara County Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
* WHERE AND WHEN: Rickie Lee Jones with special guest Lyle Lovett on Sunday 
July 15 at 7 p.m. Tickets are $22, $19.50 and $17. 1122 North Milpas St. Santa 
Barbara. Call 966-2727.

BYSTANDER IS KILLED IN GANGS' CROSS-FIRE; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: WOMAN IS THE LATEST STATISTIC IN LONG BEACH'S ESCALATING HOMICIDE RATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Sandra Jean Lacy was sitting in front of her mother's apartment building in 
Long Beach, minding her own business, when she was caught in the cross-fire 
between two warring gang members, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunfire from a semiautomatic rifle wielded by one gang member didn't kill 
her, but a shotgun blast fired by another did, making Lacy the latest statistic 
in the beach city's escalating homicide rate. 
</P>
<P>
Lacy, 23, was sitting atop a brick planter late Tuesday night when a gang 
member, hiding in a nearby alley, fired 15 rounds from his semiautomatic rifle 
toward a member of a rival gang, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The rival, armed with a shotgun, fired back. 
</P>
<P>
"And being the marksman that he is, he hit the girl, dead center, instead," 
homicide Detective Roy Hamand said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunmen fled. 
</P>
<P>
Lacy, wounded in the upper torso, collapsed while trying to climb the stairs to 
her mother's apartment, Hamand said. She was pronounced dead early Wednesday 
morning at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears now that she was in the wrong place at the wrong time," Hamand 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Lacy was the first victim in three days of shootings reported along the 1500 
and 1600 blocks of Chestnut Avenue, where graffiti mars apartment buildings and 
bars protect windows. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, members of a Long Beach gang fired at the apartment of a rival who 
belongs to a Los Angeles gang, Hamand said. On Monday, police responded to 
reports of gunshots in the same area of Chestnut Avenue three times. 
</P>
<P>
Officers said the shootings all appear to be gang-related. No arrests have been 
made. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a certain gang's turf and you're not going to get any cooperation," 
Hamand said. 
</P>
<P>
Gang-related shootings account for most of the killings in Long Beach, where 
homicides have soared this year. There have been 62 killings this year, 
compared to 42 for the same period last year, a 47% increase, according to 
police. A similar increase was recorded last year, when killings went up by 46% 
compared to 1988 figures, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the killings have been in the downtown, central and western parts of 
the city, police said. 
</P>
<P>
In the Chestnut Avenue area, residents and workers concerned about crime, 
congestion and litter recently formed the Washington Middle School Neighborhood 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great worry to us. We're trying to get more attention focused on this 
area," said Mary Soth, an association official and the executive director of 
the Long Beach Day Nursery in the 1500 block of Chestnut Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Soth said she and her staff hear gunshots near the nursery, which cares for 
about 80 children, at least once every couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"We're nervous, but we feel we are safe. We are not personally threatened," 
Soth said. "We're not the targets."

</P>

AGRICULTURE: WORLD LEADERS MEETING IN HOUSTON AGREED ON FARM TRADE REFORM BUT 
SET NO TIMETABLE FOR CHANGES. SOME CALIFORNIA GROWERS HAVE MUCH TO WIN; OTHERS 
HAVE A LOT TO LOSE.

Ask a California kiwi fruit grower or marketer about the economic summit in 
Houston and the response is likely to be subdued, cautiously optimistic at best 
and that only if he's having a good day. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is simple: Trade liberalization would come too late for the 
California kiwi industry. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past several years, heavy production subsidies were paid to French, 
Italian and Spanish growers to get them to tear up their wine grapes -- of 
which there was a glut -- and start planting kiwi. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why we have lost the market," said James Llano, export sales manager 
for Blue Diamond Inc., a Sacramento-based fresh fruit marketing cooperative. 
"The kiwi fruit currently being produced in Europe were planted with government 
subsidy. . . . We really would have benefitted from this three to four years 
ago, before planting had taken place." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the last day of a Houston meeting between the United States and 
six of its major allies, the Group of 7 issued a carefully crafted compromise 
on the question of international farm trade reform, backing a U.S. demand for 
cuts in subsidies but putting no timetable on that goal. But while the 
compromise set a framework for negotiations, it included no specifics. 
</P>
<P>
Because California leads the nation in agricultural exports, it also could 
become the country's biggest winner if quotas and government subsidies to 
foreign growers are outlawed in upcoming General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
But some of its agricultural segments could also stand to lose if trade is 
liberalized through the GATT talks. The United States hopes that the European 
Community will ease government subsidies and import quotas, and there was some 
evidence Wednesday that that could happen. But the United States has a few of 
its own import quotas, including those governing sugar, dairy products and 
peanuts. 
</P>
<P>
California is the biggest producer of beet sugar in the nation, and sugar beet 
growers are understandably nervous about what the United States gets and gives 
away in negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"What could cause us to have major losses in the industry is an inequitable 
change in our current policies," said Luther Markwardt, executive vice 
president of the American Sugarbeet Growers Assn. "What's at stake here is 
361,000 jobs and an $18.5-billion industry. Out of that, California is probably 
the most vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
But Paul Drazek, an international trade specialist with the American Farm 
Bureau Federation, contends that U.S. farmers are efficient enough to do well 
in a fair international market. Therefore, no matter what the United States 
concedes, it will still be better off. 
</P>
<P>
"The Department of Agriculture has estimated that unfair trade practices cost 
us $11 billion in agricultural exports annually," Drazek said. "Last year we 
exported a total of $40 billion. California was top agricultural export state 
and could be the single biggest winner, because many of the commodities that 
face the toughest foreign restrictions are the types of products produced in 
California." 
</P>
<P>
The USDA is particularly optimistic. According to its Foreign Agricultural 
Service, the United States could increase its export of dried prunes to the 
European Community from $49 million at present to $64 million with trade 
liberalization. 
</P>
<P>
The United States currently exports $64 million worth of raisins to Europe each 
year; that amount could increase to $83 million. And rice exports could shoot 
up from $91 million to $159 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We're delighted" about the progress made in Houston on Wednesday, said Kelly 
Shipp, spokeswoman for the USDA. "It moves us off the dime. We've been 
stalemated for some time. It's also the first time that the European Community 
has agreed to negotiate on export subsidies and import quotas."

ANOTHER TEXAS THRIFT CHIEF IS ACCUSED BY U.S.; 
</P>
<P>
BAILOUT: THE EX-CHAIRMAN OF SUNBELT SAVINGS IN DALLAS WAS CHARGED WITH FRAUD; 
HIS THRIFT'S COLLAPSE COST TAXPAYERS MORE THAN $2 BILLION. THE S&amp;L DISASTER 
CONTINUES.

<TEXT>
<P>
Moving against one of the nation's costliest savings and loan failures, a 
federal grand jury indicted the former chairman of a Texas thrift Wednesday on 
charges of bank fraud, misapplying funds and making false statements arising 
from a $700-million Southern California real estate purchase. 
</P>
<P>
The defendant, Edwin T. McBirney III, resigned as chairman of Sunbelt Savings 
Assn. under pressure from federal regulators in 1986. The Dallas institution 
was consolidated with seven other insolvent thrifts two years later in a 
bailout that cost taxpayers more than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1984-86 deal characterized by U.S. Attorney Marvin Collins in Dallas as a 
case of "you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours," McBirney allegedly 
offered another Dallas thrift, Western Savings Assn., a $6-million profit on 
any property it wanted to sell. 
</P>
<P>
In return, Western agreed to provide approximately $30 million needed by a 
Sunbelt subsidiary, Sun Cal, to complete the purchase of the Southern 
California property. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment did not specify the location of the real estate or the eventual 
outcome of the transaction. But Paul Coggins, McBirney's attorney, said that 
the real estate included the Hilton hotel at Los Angeles International Airport 
and about 12 other properties in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
The allegedly fraudulent reciprocal loan arrangement led to others as well as 
to false statements by McBirney to hide the transactions from regulatory 
authorities, the grand jury charged. 
</P>
<P>
To generate the promised $6-million profit, Western chose a 708-acre tract of 
land in Denton County, Tex. McBirney lined up a California real estate broker, 
not identified in the indictment, to buy the land for $21.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
McBirney allegedly represented to the buyer that the property was worth more 
than $23 million and was suitable for residential development, and that Sunbelt 
would be interested in making loans to prospective home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment said that McBirney did so without benefit of an appraisal or 
other relevant information and without conducting an investigation into the 
true value and potential of the property. McBirney also caused Sunbelt to 
extend a loan to the buyer without required documentation, according to the 
indictment. 
</P>
<P>
To keep the loan out of default and to prevent federal and state regulators 
from learning the true nature of the transaction, McBirney allegedly made 
additional loans to third parties and diverted proceeds from them, according to 
the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury charged that McBirney deceived his own employees to block 
regulators from obtaining correct information about the complex financing. 
</P>
<P>
"In spite of the great lengths to which people went . . . to deceive the 
regulatory authorities and hide their criminality, today's indictment 
demonstrates that even these complex schemes can be penetrated through an 
aggressive, long-term investigative effort," U.S. Attorney Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
Coggins, McBirney's attorney, said his client would plead not guilty at his 
arraignment next week. He said that prosecutors have "sliced a single 
transaction into 17 different counts, and it's government overkill." 
</P>
<P>
The attorney added that there is no allegation that McBirney personally 
profited from the transactions. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted on all counts, McBirney would face up to 85 years in prison and 
$4.25 million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment made no mention of McBirney's high-flying style in running 
Sunbelt, which came to be known as "Gunbelt Savings" because of its quickness 
to extend loans. 
</P>
<P>
Collins said that he sought to keep the indictment "lean and small" so that 
jurors could understand the highly complex transactions.

IT'S BACK TO THE WATER COOLER AT MCDONNELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Computers used by an estimated 22,000 McDonnell Douglas workers in Long Beach 
to communicate with each other are being turned off today. 
</P>
<P>
The extraordinary move -- some employees say a drastic and even a desperate one 
-- is just the latest effort by the company to meet a goal mandated by 
McDonnell Douglas Chairman John McDonnell to save $700 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
"These are times that call for drastic measures," said Douglas Aircraft 
spokesman Don Hanson, acknowledging reports of the decision from sources inside 
the plant. "We are talking about saving $700 million across the corporation. 
That is a very big number." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, employees were notified of the decision by a message sent on the 
very computer system that is to be decommissioned. "The McDonnell Douglas 
executive council has decided to eliminate all electronic mail throughout the 
corporation," the announcement said. 
</P>
<P>
The computer system, made by International Business Machines, is known as PROFS 
or "professional office system." It is used by employees to send and receive 
messages electronically, keep daily schedules, compose letters or memos and 
many other functions. 
</P>
<P>
Employees are either outraged or frightened by the the decision. "People are 
saying why don't you get rid of the telephones," said one professional 
employee. 
</P>
<P>
When word first began to circulate on June 27 about a possible decision to shut 
down the system, 908 responses were sent to the management information center. 
Of those, 905 were opposed to the move, a source said. 
</P>
<P>
Without PROFs, employees will either have to place telephone calls or use 
interoffice mail. But one employee noted that the company mail room is weeks 
behind in distributing mail. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson acknowledged that the mail room was running behind schedule as a result 
of cost-cutting layoffs in the mail room staff. 
</P>
<P>
But mail deliveries are improving. The company recently was forced, however, to 
cut deliveries and pickups from a frequency of twice each day to only once each 
day, another indication of the severity of the financial condition of the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
"It really does bring it home to you," Hanson said about the difficulties of 
the cost-cutting effort. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a range of other plant services are being cut, such as the bus 
service that shuttles employees around the plant. More seriously, the staff 
that keeps plant machinery operating is also being trimmed, according to one 
management source. 
</P>
<P>
"They say we are just keeping the direct production people," the source said. 
"They don't seem to understand that if their machines are not operating, it is 
going to be difficult to keep production going." 
</P>
<P>
Another internal source at Douglas said the company has 30,000 terminals in 
Long Beach alone that are tied into the PROFs system. Other terminals link Long 
Beach to such far-flung Douglas facilities as Cypress, Monrovia and Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a key concern of many employees is that Douglas is so spread out that 
without an electronic message system, communications will suffer. For example, 
production of the Air Force C-17 cargo jet is on the west side of the Long 
Beach airport, but the program's engineering staff is about two miles away on 
the east side of the airport. The executive staff is about a mile north of that 
building. 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear just how much money the elimination of PROFs is supposed to save. 
It is operated by four mainframe computers. A source said the company 
ultimately might remove some PROFs terminals and eliminate some of the 
mainframes.

PANEL URGES TAX CREDITS FOR MAKERS OF CHIP EQUIPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A high-level panel of business and government leaders will recommend today a 
package of aggressive tax credits to revitalize the nation's semiconductor 
equipment industry, seeking to alter the Bush Administration's continuing 
opposition to an industrial policy favoring the electronics industry. 
</P>
<P>
The presidentially appointed National Advisory Committee on Semiconductors will 
release a study today that says Japanese manufacturers of the sophisticated 
equipment used to make semiconductors -- just like Japanese producers of the 
chips themselves -- have taken the lead once held by U.S. companies, and will 
dominate the $15.2-billion industry by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The panel says that to regain global pre-eminence, the United States should 
adopt investment tax credits of 50% on new equipment purchased within a year of 
its introduction, liberalize depreciation rules for high technology 
investments, and establish tax credits for research and development of 
strategic semiconductor materials and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The report further recommends that Congress revise antitrust laws to encourage 
the creation of manufacturing consortia and cooperatives in both the 
chip-making and semiconductor equipment manufacturing industries. 
</P>
<P>
An advance copy of the report was obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
The panel notes that while the U.S. semiconductor equipment industry is far 
from dead, its condition poses "a cause for concern" because foreign 
competitors are larger, serve larger customers and dominate key new chip-making 
technologies. 
</P>
<P>
"Technological and/or competitive advantages, once lost, are very difficult and 
costly to regain," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
Although the study calls for tax incentives, it makes no mention of the panel's 
recommendation last year to immediately boost funding by $100 million for 
Sematech, the chip industry's research and manufacturing consortium in Austin, 
Tex. The report also omits a previous observation that Sematech will need an 
additional $800 million over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
Industry observers said the omissions were not inadvertent. "The panel has been 
pressured by the Bush Administration to water down its position," said Dan 
Hutchinson, president of VLSI Research, a San Jose semiconductor research firm 
whose work is cited in the panel's report. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that while the Silicon Valley is burning, the Bush 
Administration is playing its fiddle." 
</P>
<P>
The panel's report notes that U.S. producers of semiconductor-making equipment 
held a 69% share of the global market in 1983, compared to 25% for the 
Japanese. But by 1993, the Japanese are expected to command a 55% hold on the 
market, compared to 32% for U.S. manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
In one telling statistic, the panel notes that in 1980, all of the top 10 
semiconductor equipment manufacturers were U.S. companies. By 1989, just four 
were, and three were in the bottom half. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the panel, created in 1988, include Ian M. Ross, president of 
AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories and the panel's chairman; John A. Armstrong, vice 
president for science and technology at International Business Machines; Norman 
R. Augustine, chairman and chief executive of Martin Marietta; Robert W. 
Galvin, chairman of the executive committee of Motorola; Erich Bloch, director 
of the National Science Foundation, and D. Allan Bromley, a technology adviser 
to President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
SLIDING SHARE 
</P>
<P>
The market share held by U.S. manufacturers of semiconductor-making equipment 
is declining and Japanese manufacturers are expected to dominate the industry 
in the next few years.

5 RETAILERS PULL SPOT REMOVER FROM SHELVES; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE CHAINS BAN K2R SPOTLIFTER BECAUSE THE PRODUCT DOESN'T BEAR A 
CANCER WARNING ON THE LABEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under legal pressure by environmentalists, five major retail chains are pulling 
K2r Spotlifter from the shelves of more than 1,400 California stores because 
the product does not bear a cancer warning. 
</P>
<P>
Lucky Stores, Alpha Beta, Safeway Stores, Thrifty Drug Stores and Sav-on 
responded to a complaint filed July 5 by the Environmental Defense Fund and the 
Sierra Club under California's Proposition 65. Some of the stores also withdrew 
certain other products cited in the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
The environmentalist groups charged that K2r and 13 brands of paint stripper 
and water repellent products contain cancer-causing agents. Under Proposition 
65, passed by California voters in 1986, businesses are required to provide a 
warning to consumers if their products pose a significant health risk of 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
K2r -- a leading spot-remover produced by the Dow Brands subsidiary of Dow 
Chemical Co. -- contains perchloroethylene, a solvent the state classified as 
carcinogenic more than two years ago. When K2r and the other products are used, 
environmentalists said, the solvents evaporate and can be breathed by the 
person using them. Under the law, violators can face fines of up to $2,500 a 
day per violation. 
</P>
<P>
"We think this is prompt and responsible action," said David Roe, an 
Oakland-based attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund. "They (the 
retailers) are protecting customers and they are protecting themselves from 
legal liability." 
</P>
<P>
But Dow Brands denies the spot remover is hazardous. Company spokesman Richard 
Parry said Indianapolis-based Dow Brands has conducted tests on the product 
since the passage of Proposition 65. 
</P>
<P>
"The results show that K2r does not pose a significant risk and consequently 
does not require a warning," Parry said. "We're aware of Proposition 65 and we 
think we have lived within the intent and spirit of the law." 
</P>
<P>
Parry said Dow does not consider perchlorethylene to be carcinogenic. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Environmental Defense Fund said Dow Brands executives agreed 
to meet with them in Oakland on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Defense Fund has said it would file suit Sept. 5 if Dow 
Chemical and the makers of the other 13 products do not either post cancer 
warnings or remove the solvents. Under Proposition 65, citizens or the state 
attorney general can bring a civil suit against alleged violators -- 
manufacturers or retailers. The action on the K2r product is the most 
widespread by retailers since the passage of Proposition 65. 
</P>
<P>
Safeway Stores, headquartered in Oakland, on Monday ordered managers of its 220 
California stores to remove K2r. 
</P>
<P>
"Cancer-causing materials must be made known to the public and we had no 
warning from the manufacturer that the product contained carcinogens," said 
Debra Lambert, a spokeswoman for Safeway. 
</P>
<P>
Thrifty Drug Stores went a step further -- authorizing the removal of the 
product from its 500 California stores and from 150 stores five other Western 
states, said James Haight, Thrifty's lawyer. Thrifty is a subsidiary of Los 
Angeles-based Pacific Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's dangerous in California, it's dangerous in other states," Haight said. 
</P>
<P>
Hal Pederson, quality-assurance administrator for Lucky Stores, said the chain 
removed K2r from its 378 California stores immediately after receiving the 
complaint was filed. 
</P>
<P>
Lucky, based in Dublin, Calif., also coordinated removal of the product from 
174 Alpha Beta stores in Southern California and from 165 Sav-on drugstores in 
the Southland and the Central Valley. Lucky, Alpha Beta and Sav-on are all 
divisions of American Stores, based in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the only recourse we have to protect ourselves, to remove it from our 
shelves," Pederson said. 
</P>
<P>
Lucky also removed some paint removers from Alpha Beta combination stores in 
Southern California, products that were among the 14 cited by environmentalists 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
Those products included Jasco Speedomatic, Jasco Premium Paint and Graffiti 
Remover, Jasco Premium Paint and Epoxy Remover and Jasco Paint Etch. 
</P>
<P>
Other products mentioned in that notice included paint removers from Standard 
Brands, Sears, Formby's and Zynolyte. Those products were not carried in Lucky, 
Alpha Beta or Sav-on.

Thomson-CSF, a major manufacturer of military equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The French firm said it had been selected by the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service to produce a new generation of resident alien permits, 
commonly known as green cards. It said the new cards would be produced using 
advanced electronic color imaging and digital processing techniques. No 
financial details of the deal were disclosed.

</P>
<P>
The lawsuit said Greenwich, Conn.-based UPS has failed to allow a religious 
exception to the company's practice of prohibiting employees with beards from 
working in positions that deal with the public. The lawsuit, filed in a Chicago 
federal court, alleges UPS violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 
by failing to accommodate the religious practices of employees.

Appeals Run Out for Hoiles: The state Supreme Court rejected an appeal from 
dissident Freedom Newspapers shareholder Harry H. Hoiles, ending years of 
litigation against his sister's and his late brother's families to break up the 
Irvine media concern by taking one-third of its assets. The court's unanimous 
decision keeps intact previous rulings against Hoiles, who had claimed that he 
was entitled to his share after the majority reneged on a promise to make him 
Freedom's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
The majority argued that he proved himself incapable of running the firm and 
was entitled only to the value of his minority stake, not to actual assets. The 
firm owns the Orange County Register, 26 smaller dailies, 25 weeklies and five 
television stations.

AGENCY CALLED UNFIT TO REGULATE STOCK-INDEX FUTURES; 
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES: EX-SEN. THOMAS EAGLETON TELLS A SENATE PANEL THE CFTC IS A LAP DOG 
OF THE CHICAGO-BASED FUTURES INDUSTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former U.S. senator who served three years on the board of a Chicago 
commodities exchange told a divided Senate panel Wednesday that the Commodity 
Futures Trading Commission is inept and ill-equipped to regulate stock-index 
futures markets. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Eagleton, who resigned from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange board of 
governors in a bitter dispute last year, told the Committee on Banking, Housing 
and Urban Affairs that the CFTC is a lap dog to the futures industry centered 
in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"The CFTC trembles at the sight of Chicago," Eagleton said at a hearing on a 
Bush Administration bill that would end the CFTC's exclusive authority over 
futures markets and would move stock-index futures regulation to the Securities 
and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal has produced a pitched battle between the two agencies and between 
the futures and securities industries. 
</P>
<P>
Eagleton, a former senator from Missouri, and several securities industries 
spokesmen said regulation of financial products derived from stock markets, 
including stock-index futures, should come under the SEC for uniform policing 
to try to prevent repeats of the stock market plunges of October, 1987 and 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of two Chicago exchanges, which virulently oppose the 
Administration's bill, had been slated to testify Wednesday, but instead will 
testify in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Committee members also took opposing stands on the bill, and several 
acknowledged its chances of Senate approval are slim. 
</P>
<P>
"I have the very strong suspicion that there are not the votes to accomplish" 
the power shift between the two agencies, said Christopher Bond, a Missouri 
Republican. 
</P>
<P>
He suggested that one compromise would be giving the Federal Reserve authority 
over stock-index futures margins -- which some consider a key element in 
strengthening futures market regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Exchanges currently set margins -- the amount of cash that the exchanges 
require to trade contracts -- subject to CFTC oversight. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the futures industry and of the CFTC argue that stock-index futures 
margins are too low, allowing speculators to hold under-leveraged positions and 
increasing market volatility. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Hardiman, president of the National Assn. of Securities Dealers, said 
the fact that traders and institutions can control "such a large amount of 
stock with so little money" could result in "a major market disruption." 
</P>
<P>
Hardiman and others from the securities industry also told the committee that 
the 1989 stock market plunges were made worse by computer program and arbitrage 
trading in stock market futures. They said CFTC regulation of those futures 
markets was inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
Eagleton called the CFTC a "pygmy" as a regulator. He said it is a "political 
dumping ground," has been under-funded and under-staffed and is "the play-toy 
of Chicago," partly because the agency must be reauthorized every three years, 
requiring political support. 
</P>
<P>
But Alan Dixon, an Illinois Democrat, said a bill that has been held up by the 
current power struggle would have increased CFTC funding and regulatory powers.

BIG THREE AUTO MAKERS SPEED INTO EUROPE

Teetering trade barriers in the West and the opening of closed economies in the 
East have been making Europe as a whole the target of U.S. auto makers, which 
are moving with unaccustomed speed to exploit the market. 
</P>
<P>
General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and to a lesser extent Chrysler Corp. have 
done business in Europe for years. 
</P>
<P>
But more recently they quickly have been setting up joint manufacturing and 
supply ventures, establishing marketing associations and buying all or portions 
of European auto makers as the Continent begins to emerge as the world's 
largest auto market. 
</P>
<P>
Trade barriers among the 12-member European Economic Community are to be 
eliminated in 1992, creating an auto market larger than North America. 
</P>
<P>
The market would swell further if free trade agreements are reached between the 
dozen EC members and other Western and Eastern European nations. 
</P>
<P>
General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, each facing weakening performances at home, 
increasingly are looking to Europe as a source of profits and a market for 
excess U.S. manufacturing capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Auto analyst David Healy, of the investment banking firm Barclays de Zoete Wedd 
in New York, said Tuesday that he expected the European market to grow to about 
13 million cars this year. Generous estimates put the U.S. car market at about 
10 million for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something that's a good deal bigger in just passenger cars than the 
United States," Healy said. "Sales have grown a lot over the last few years, 
but have sort of leveled out this year." 
</P>
<P>
There's potential growth in the European minivan and sport-utility segments. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler, which sparked the popularity of minivans in the United States, has 
signed an agreement with Steyr-Daimler-Puch to make minivans in Austria 
beginning in spring 1991. Executives have said the project also may market 
right-hand drive vehicles for the United Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is going to be a scramble to either introduce those vans from 
the United States or companies building them on their own," Healy said.

MONTEBELLO ORDERS HEALTH CLUB TO REDUCE PARKING CRUNCH 
</P>

A feud between the Holiday Spa Health Club and neighboring businesses and 
residents over a 449-space parking lot erupted this week when more than 500 
residents and spa members packed City Hall during a public hearing to consider 
shutting down the club. 
</P>
<P>
The council decided that closing the club was too drastic and instead voted 
unanimously to force the club to alleviate a severe parking shortage by adding 
more spaces to the Beverly-Wilcox Shopping Center lot that it shares with about 
20 other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Arnold Alvarez-Glasman and Art Payan rebuked Holiday Spa 
representatives and the Hofstadter family that owns 60% of the shopping center 
for failing to resolve the parking issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm concerned that the City Council chambers were used to solve a problem 
which probably should have been solved in the courts," Payan said. "It is time 
to remove this from the political arena." 
</P>
<P>
Angry residents told the council that along with huge workout centers equipped 
with the latest in fitness technology, the corporation has brought to 
Montebello an arrogant attitude toward the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Since the club opened in May, 1989, residents and some business people who 
share the shopping center parking lot with the club have complained that the 
spa, in search of greater profits, has allowed too many people to join without 
providing adequate parking. As a result, residents said, Holiday Spa patrons 
have taken over the parking lot, harming the business of the other shopping 
center tenants and disrupting life in the neighborhoods around the center. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to restriping the lot to add 82 parking spaces, the council voted 
to force the spa to reduce noise and congestion in the shopping center 
neighborhood and repair the asphalt in the lot. 
</P>
<P>
The Hofstadter family, as majority owner, must approve the restriping of the 
lot. If the family refuses to approve the restriping, the council has 
threatened to eliminate 77 reserved parking spaces used by Hofstadter tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Hofstadter, who said he had hoped the council would force the club to 
build a parking garage, said he was shocked by the council's decision: "The 
council gave us a choice between a slow death by watching our businesses 
dwindle because there is not enough room to park, even with 82 more spaces, or 
a quick death by letting the spa take over the lot immediately." 
</P>
<P>
Holiday Spa representatives, who had already agreed to add parking spaces, 
praised the council's action and criticized councilman William Molinari and 
some residents for "politicizing" the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we were only here tonight because certain members of this community 
and one councilman created a political issue," said Holiday Spa's attorney, 
Louis J. Khoury. 
</P>
<P>
Khoury said 2,400 members of the spa had signed a "Stop Bill Molinari" petition 
because they believe he wants to shut down the club. 
</P>
<P>
Molinari said during the meeting that he never wanted to close the spa and that 
he was doing his job as a councilman when he helped neighbors concerned about 
traffic congestion and noise from spa patrons. 
</P>
<P>
Elcie Eckman, who has lived in the neighborhood behind the spa for more than 30 
years, angrily denounced Payan for saying the issue had become political. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not political," she said. "This is my life. Thirty-five years of my 
life have gone down the drain because of that club." 
</P>
<P>
Holiday Spa attorney Khoury said that the problem is much less severe than the 
one painted by the Hofstadter family and that the family has a "hidden agenda" 
to shut the club down. 
</P>
<P>
"The Hofstadter family will not rest until the Holiday Spa is forced out of the 
center," he told the council. 
</P>
<P>
Hofstadter and his mother, Charlotte, denied that they plan to force the spa to 
close and said they just want the parking situation resolved. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted to give the Hofstadter family 30 days to give their written 
consent to the restriping of the parking lot.

WHITTIER BARS UNAUTHORIZED USE OF ITS LOGO; 
</P>
<P>
CITY HALL: THE ACTION COMES AFTER ASSEMBLY CANDIDATE PHIL MAUTINO PUT THE 
EMBLEM ON A MAILER BEFORE THE JUNE PRIMARY. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has voted unanimously to bar the unauthorized use of 
Whittier's city logo, two months after a local Assembly candidate put the logo 
and a city return address on a campaign mailer before the June primary. 
</P>
<P>
"I got one in the mail," council member Helen Rahder said after the meeting 
Tuesday. "It's not only misleading. If I put somebody else's name and address 
on something, it's not only false, it's just wrong. I was appalled." 
</P>
<P>
Although the vote was unanimous, other council members were not as adamant 
about the issue or its importance. "I don't think (the vote) was necessary," 
Myron Claxton said before the meeting. "I felt (using the logo) was no big 
deal. I went along with it because, heck, you might as well make it clear that 
(the city logo) should be used only for official business." 
</P>
<P>
Claxton and fellow council member Robert Woehrmann played an apparently 
unknowing part in the controversy when they allowed their names to appear on a 
letter endorsing former 52nd Assembly District candidate Phil Mautino, who 
finished sixth in the Republican primary won by Paul V. Horcher. 
</P>
<P>
"I said I'd sign a letter," Claxton said. "I've known Phil for many years. When 
he indicated there might be other people signing the letter, I said that would 
be fine." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to himself and Woehrmann, the letter was signed by former Whittier 
Mayors Victor Lopez and Gene Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
Claxton said he did not know the endorsement letter would appear under 
Whittier's logo, which is the name of the city printed over a drawing of City 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"The envelope it was mailed in had the same texture and appearance of city 
stationery," City Manager Tom Mauk said. "And the return address was City Hall. 
That was the first thing we were concerned about. Then, when they opened the 
letter up, it had the city logo on top." 
</P>
<P>
The letter begins: "As members and former members of the Whittier City Council, 
we are writing to ask for your help in electing Phil Mautino to the California 
State Assembly." The letter then describes why the undersigned chose to endorse 
Mautino. At the bottom of the letter is a disclaimer stating, "Not printed or 
mailed at taxpayer expense. Paid for by Phil Mautino for Assembly." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the disclaimer, "we didn't see any legal violation of election law," 
Mauk said. "Certainly, it was an ethical question. We wanted it made clear that 
it wasn't a city-sponsored mailer." 
</P>
<P>
In the future, because of the council action, the penalty for a misdemeanor 
offense will be a fine of not more than $500, a prison term of not more than 
six months, or both. 
</P>
<P>
Rahder said she could not believe appropriating the city logo was not already 
against the law. "I would have thought it was illegal to begin with," she said. 
"Mautino's an attorney. He should know better. To me, it's like forgery." 
</P>
<P>
She said the council action "is just a slap on the wrist. I don't think that's 
enough. I think that he should have been reported to the Fair Political 
Practices Commission." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry if it offended anyone," said Mautino of the mailer sent to local 
Republicans about three weeks before the primary. "I didn't know the logo of 
Whittier was being used. The campaign staff put the logo on and thought it was 
justified and legal. It fully identified the people who signed the letter. The 
return address of the city was used because, for the people who signed the 
letter, that's where they receive their return mail. 
</P>
<P>
"Primarily, the people who've raised objections are the two Democrats, 
Henderson and Rahder," he said. "I think it's been a partisan political thing. 
I think they're probably overreacting. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not using that as an excuse. I'll take the heat for it." 
</P>
<P>
Mautino pointed out that official-looking logos and titles appear throughout 
campaign literature around election time. In his own files, he has a letter of 
endorsement for another candidate that bears the state Assembly logo. That 
mailer was signed by a state assemblyman. Mautino also has a letter signed by 
Los Angeles City Council member Joan Milke Flores pushing her candidacy for 
secretary of state. At the top of the letter is the Los Angeles City Council 
logo. 
</P>
<P>
Such practices are common, said Charles Davis, Compton's city clerk for the 
last 18 years. "I would use my city letterhead on a letter for you or someone 
else as a character reference." 
</P>
<P>
In a campaign endorsement, "at the bottom, you say, 'Not paid for at taxpayer 
expense.' Members of Congress do it all the time," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Appropriating a city's logo is a somewhat different matter, he said. "I really 
don't know. In Compton's code, I don't see anything that really relates to it," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never had a problem in all my years here," said Mary Paxon, the city 
clerk in Norwalk. "If somebody used it without permission, we'd have to look 
into the matter. I have no idea." 
</P>
<P>
"In all my years of work as a city attorney," said Sam Siegel, Pico Rivera's 
counsel, "that borders on 30 years, I've never encountered a problem in that 
area. But there are laws against copyright infringement and deception of the 
public in the California Business and Professions Code." 
</P>
<P>
"Philosophically," Siegel said, "I would imagine any candidate would seek the 
most convincing endorsement he or she could possibly find." 
</P>
<P>
During the primary for the 52nd District Assembly seat, endorsements became a 
major issue. First, there was a flap over which candidate Ronald Reagan would 
have endorsed had he chosen to back any of them. Then, more than one candidate 
sought the more tangible support of state Sen. Frank Hill, who had held the 
52nd District Assembly seat. 
</P>
<P>
Mautino, 50, said he once thought he had Hill's support. The real estate lawyer 
said Hill had urged him to run in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"After I started running, I realized he had made that comment to other people 
too," Mautino said. 
</P>
<P>
After remaining officially neutral for much of the campaign, Hill endorsed 
Horcher, who finished less than 100 votes ahead of the second- and third-place 
candidates. Mautino's sixth-place finish was 1,200 votes behind Horcher. 
</P>
<P>
"When Frank Hill endorsed Horcher, it didn't look too good after that," Mautino 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Denied Hill's help, Mautino turned to old friends Claxton and Woehrmann. 
</P>
<P>
If he had to do it over again, Mautino said, "I think I would have discussed 
using the logo with the gentlemen, and I think their preference would have been 
not to use it." 
</P>
<P>
Claxton said he thought the mailer backfired on his friend. "I got a phone call 
from somebody who was irate and said he would not vote for Mautino or anyone 
else who used city stationery," he said.

COMMUNITY DIGEST: SOUTH GATE; 
</P>
<P>
COUNCIL POSTPONES PROPOSAL FOR ALCOHOL SALES IN PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has postponed indefinitely a proposal to allow alcohol sales 
in certain facilities at the city's largest park. The council voted unanimously 
without discussion Monday to remove a staff recommendation from the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal would have raised approximately $60,000 a year by allowing the 
sale of alcoholic beverages at South Gate Park. Sales would have been 
restricted to the auditorium, Girls' Clubhouse and golf course. 
</P>
<P>
More than 150 people crowded into the council chamber during the meeting. Many 
were opposed to the proposal, including pastors and members of local churches. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel alcohol is more of a liability than an assest. We would need more 
police protection," said the Rev. George Jameson, president of the South Gate 
Ministerial Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
"As an All-America City, we would not be setting a fine example to let 
everybody know we are putting alcohol in the park," Jameson said. South Gate 
was recently honored as an All-America City by the National Civic League. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Robert A. Philipp said the crowd did not influence the council. Philipp 
said the recommendation originally had been planned for discussion along with 
other items for the 1990-91 budget. When it became clear that those items would 
not be ready for discussion, he decided to drop the alcohol proposal, Philipp 
said.

LATINO ACTIVIST GROUP PROPOSES PROGRAM FOR PRESCHOOL CHILDREN TO STEER THEM 
AWAY FROM GANG INVOLVEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Latino civic organization is proposing an anti-gang program for preschoolers 
living in a neighborhood on the border of Norwalk and Artesia. 
</P>
<P>
Members of local Chapter 2009 of the League of United Latin American Citizens 
(LULAC), a nationwide Latino organization, say they will take a survey to 
determine how many children and their parents reside in the area, which for 
years has been ravaged by fighting between two gangs. 
</P>
<P>
After the survey is completed, the group will ask the two cities and the ABC 
and Norwalk-La Mirada school districts that serve the area to develop a program 
for 3- and 4-year-olds to steer them away from joining gangs, said Ray 
Rodriguez, president of Chapter 2009. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said the program would include both education and recreation 
activities. Details would be worked out later. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to determine how we can prevent young children from getting involved 
in gangs. We must attack the situation at the preschool level," Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
ABC school board member Sally Morales Havice said she supports some type of 
preschool program for the area that would include both parents and their 
children. Havice said: "Law enforcement and the cities are spending money to 
protect the citizens, and that's what should be done. But people are saying 
what are we doing to prevent the cycle of violence." 
</P>
<P>
About 50 LULAC members, city and school officials, including Norwalk Councilman 
Robert E. White and Havice and Sheriff's Department personnel, met Monday at 
Norwalk City Hall to discuss methods of dealing with violence between a gang 
called Barrio Norwalk and the Chivas gang of Artesia. The gangs are separated 
by 166th Street, which is the dividing line between south Norwalk and north 
Artesia. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting, scheduled by members of LULAC, was held out of concern after the 
latest violence that occurred June 22. Jesus E. Diaz, 16, a reputed member of 
the Chivas gang, was shot and killed while attending a graduation party on the 
north side of 166th Street in Barrio Norwalk territory. Nine others were 
injured when three attackers fired a shotgun and handguns into a crowd of about 
100. 
</P>
<P>
No one has been arrested. Deputies said there have been no reprisals. 
</P>
<P>
Both cities, which are served by the Sheriff's Department, have increased their 
law enforcement efforts since the latest shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"The area has been saturated (with deputies) to discourage any retaliation," 
said Lt. John Radeleff of the Norwalk substation.

PROGRAM AIMS TO SOLVE HANDICAPS EARLY; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: WITH ONE DAY TO SPARE, THE LEGISLATURE RE-AUTHORIZES FUNDING FOR 
NON-RIS, WHICH HELPS CHILDREN WITH LEARNING, SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Four-year-old Jessica Mora has just a little problem. 
</P>
<P>
"My daughter speaks very loudly when she talks," said parent Aurora Mora 
through an interpreter. "It seems that she's screaming or yelling." 
</P>
<P>
A few among her preschool classmates have other little problems. Some use 
phrases where they should use sentences. Some have trouble articulating words. 
A few can't follow directions that contain a two-step sequence. Then there are 
a number of preschoolers who do not interact properly with their peers or do 
not sit still or listen. 
</P>
<P>
They all seem like such little problems in such little tykes. Yet many of these 
children are destined to land in special-education classes by the time they 
reach grade school, because these little problems will grow bigger even as 
children do. 
</P>
<P>
A program called NON-RIS aims to solve these handicaps in preschool. 
</P>
<P>
NON-RIS more or less stands for "Not Requiring Intensive Services." The 
acronym, which refers to children without severe handicaps, makes little sense, 
but educators say the program does. They say it helps preschool children 
overcome learning, social and emotional problems in preschool. That way, the 
problems will not haunt the children throughout their school years. 
</P>
<P>
"The amount of improvement due to early intervention far outweighs any input 
you can give to kids when they're older," said Pete Ruthenbeck, a psychologist 
with the program. 
</P>
<P>
Jessica Mora worked with NON-RIS counselors at a Santa Fe Springs campus for 
Head Start, a federal program intended to prepare low-income or at-risk 
children for success in school. 
</P>
<P>
Head Start teachers, however, are not necessarily prepared to handle children 
with even slight disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
At this site, across from Los Nietos park, the NON-RIS counselors first 
screened the children to find those with special needs, then mingled with them 
during school hours, providing low-key, individualized attention. 
</P>
<P>
Aurora Mora says Jessica's speech problem has improved since her daughter began 
working with counselors. And there have been other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"Since she started, she's improved in her comprehension of words," Mora said. 
"Now when someone is talking to her she pays attention to what the person is 
saying. She's also learning more English. She also stands up for herself better 
and knows the difference between right and wrong." 
</P>
<P>
The progress is not confined to the child. Mora said the counselors have shown 
her how to help her daughter and where to go for more assistance. 
</P>
<P>
One of the program's goals is to educate parents and teachers, to show them how 
to aid children with special needs when counselors are not there. 
</P>
<P>
Although counselors insist that the program makes a tremendous difference in 
youngsters' lives, it is hard to prove how much trouble a well-adjusted child 
might have had. "It's extremely difficult to document improvement when you look 
at prevention," said Karen Polk, who coordinates NON-RIS locally. 
</P>
<P>
Polk works for the Whittier Area Cooperative Special Education Program, a 
consortium which administers special-education programs for seven Whittier-area 
school districts. Most of the partnership's resources are destined for severely 
handicapped students, who are not the focus of NON-RIS, said John Hess, the 
consortium's director. 
</P>
<P>
"When California entered into the program as a three-year commitment (in 1987), 
the first year we took it as a try-and-see," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hess hired two temporary employees to serve about 45 NON-RIS students in the 
new project's first year. 
</P>
<P>
This year, 212 children were helped by six specialists in speech-and-language 
or early-childhood development as well as two bilingual aides and two part-time 
psychologists. NON-RIS counselors worked regularly at 11 area sites in addition 
to making periodic visits to numerous regional preschools. Across the state, 
the program served about 10,000 children. 
</P>
<P>
Although NON-RIS is entirely federally funded, state lawmakers nearly allowed 
the program to lapse because they feared California could get stuck with the 
tab in the long run. California has had that experience with programs for 
handicapped students in the past, said Dr. Linda Brekken, a specialist who 
helps develop special-education programs in school districts across the state. 
</P>
<P>
In 1975, Congress authorized a federal share of 40% of costs to educate 
handicapped children. Since then, "they've never provided more than 12%. At 
this point, they've fallen to 9%," Brekken said. 
</P>
<P>
That is why some lawmakers insisted on some financial safeguards, said Mary 
Anne Moore, a legislative assistant to Assemblyman Thomas M. Hannigan 
(D-Fairfield), the author of a bill to re-authorize the program. "The bill 
specifies it doesn't involve state funds unless on a voluntary basis," Moore 
said. "Specifically, it says the state participation will terminate if federal 
funds do." 
</P>
<P>
With that proviso in place, Gov. George Deukmejian signed the legislation to 
re-authorize the program June 29, one day before funding would have ended. As a 
result, the state will retain nearly $28 million in federal aid; more than $7.5 
million will go to Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately the measure passed unanimously, but just in case, school-district 
officials had already delivered notices of potential layoffs to counselors. 
</P>
<P>
The legislative uncertainly resulted in an unanticipated answer to the question 
of whether NON-RIS is just another nice social program extravagance in an era 
of tight budgets. 
</P>
<P>
"If you could see the avalanche of mail that we have gotten from parents that 
are so grateful that their children have been able to receive help with their 
handicaps and are now mainstreamed into classrooms," Moore said, "you wouldn't 
have to ask" if the program was worth the cost. 
</P>
<P>
As Brekken sees it, "it's pay now or pay a lot more later. You don't want to 
wait until children are 5 or 6 years old and really bomb out in school." 
</P>
<P>
One program aide noted that the concept came along too late to benefit her 
grown nephew. "It could have helped him," said Felisa Reveles. "He has a speech 
problem. He's very conscious of it. He's not talkative." 
</P>
<P>
At a Santa Fe Springs child-care center in Los Nietos Park, psychologist 
Ruthenbeck looked up while helping a youngster with dexterity problems learn to 
hold a paint brush. "They'll be right on target," he predicted of his charges. 
"They'll never have to experience being different."

STATE OFFICIALS OK PLAN TO REPAIR GARVEY RESERVOIR CRACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE CHANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State officials have given preliminary approval to a plan by the Metropolitan 
Water District of Southern California for repairing cracks in Garvey Reservoir 
in Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
The cracks led to the flooding of about a dozen homes in the city last year. 
</P>
<P>
Vernon H. Persson, chief of the Division of Safety of Dams for the state 
Department of Water Resources, said last week that the plan to reinforce the 
reservoir, dig more wells and install a drainage system to detect serious leaks 
is acceptable, provided certain conditions are met to ensure the safety of the 
35-year-old structure. 
</P>
<P>
The next step is for the water district, which owns and operates the 41-acre 
reservoir, to come up with a final repair plan that meets the state dam 
division guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
The reservoir was shut down and drained nearly dry in November after residents 
on Fulton Avenue complained about flooded yards and cracked ceilings. 
</P>
<P>
Divers discovered two cracks and holes in the reservoir bottom, and geologists 
were sent in to examine the structure. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the water district concluded that the cracks were caused by gradual 
ground movement and probably were exacerbated by the October, 1987, Whittier 
earthquake and subsequent temblors centered in Pasadena, Montebello and Upland. 
</P>
<P>
The reservoir serves 7 million residents in 25 communities including 
Montebello, El Monte and South El Monte. It does not serve Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
The $20-million to $25-million repair plan calls for "armor-plating" portions 
of the reservoir with reinforced concrete, lining the reservoir with impervious 
asphalt and filling the cracks with grout. 
</P>
<P>
It also includes gravel drains, pipes and an alarm system to monitor water 
seepage. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the water district plans to dig 42 wells close to the lip of the 
reservoir to monitor ground-water levels between the reservoir and Fulton 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Persson said he has asked the water district to install permanent water pumps 
along the perimeter of the property to remove excess water in an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
He also is asking the state attorney general's office to determine what kind of 
environmental studies are needed before work begins. 
</P>
<P>
For months, Monterey Park officials have insisted that the water district write 
a full environmental impact report, and the City Council is considering legal 
action to keep the reservoir closed until a report is done. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to go all the way with this," Councilwoman Marie T. Purvis said. 
"To fill the dam would be an injustice to the people of Monterey Park. If that 
dam goes, it's going to be the whole east side of town."

A QUICK START: RUNNING WITH A FAST CROWD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WICK, Steve Wick is a bureau chief with Newsday and spent three years 
researching Bad Company. A member of Newsday's 1984 Pulitzer Prize-winning 
reporting team, he lives on Long Island, N.Y., with his wife and three 
children.

<TEXT>
<P>
After Playboy centerfold Melonie Haller was assaulted at Roy Radin's 
Southampton, N.Y., beachfront home, Radin moved to the West Coast in hopes of 
starting over. There he met Karen (Laney) Jacobs, an aspiring producer who 
offered to introduce him to a man who could make his dream of a Cotton Club 
musical a reality. Radin regarded Jacobs as the perfect Hollywood playmate, but 
he would soon learn that she was a lot more than fun and games, as author Steve 
Wicks reports in this excerpt from the book, "Bad Company." 
</P>
<P>
Roy Radin was a New Yorker at heart. He considered Los Angeles an ugly city 
with neither a center nor a soul. 
</P>
<P>
But he knew, now more than ever, that his new home offered him hope for 
reviving his business. He was an optimist, and what drove him at this point was 
the absolute belief that by turning his attention to the West Coast, he would 
finally achieve the future he'd always dreamed he would have. 
</P>
<P>
The whole point of moving to Los Angeles was to make movies. He had a file of 
properties he had carried around with him for years, including the Cotton Club 
musical. 
</P>
<P>
Radin and (his associate) John Lawson flew to Los Angeles in early January, 
with scripts, proposals and film treatments stuffed into luggage. They moved 
into the Regency. Not a fancy hotel -- it was set up for short-term rentals -- 
it was clean and comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
Because Radin did not know many people in Los Angeles, a friend of his in New 
York had told him about Carol Johnston, a travel agent, and suggested he meet 
her. She was acquainted with a lot of Hollywood people Radin would want to get 
to know. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston left a message at the Regency, inviting Radin to a party she was 
having for her father, who had recently retired from a high position at one of 
the film studios. Radin was excited, telling Lawson that he hoped there would 
be a number of Hollywood executives in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
On the night of the party, Radin dressed in his customary dark suit and tie, 
and Lawson drove him in their rented Mercedes to the house in Benedict Canyon. 
An hour and a half later, Lawson's phone rang. Radin said excitedly that he was 
returning to the hotel with Johnston and another woman. 
</P>
<P>
"She is not like anyone I've ever met," Radin said. "I can't believe her. She's 
incredible. . . . She's got incredible coke." 
</P>
<P>
An hour later, the door to the apartment burst open, and in walked Radin with 
the two women. Carol Johnston was attractive and well dressed. The second woman 
had short hair that was light in color but flecked with gray; her eyes were 
dark brown, almost black, behind a pair of designer glasses that had a bit of a 
rose tint. She had on a long evening dress that was brightly colored and 
tight-fitting. She talked loudly, laughing and hanging off Radin's arm. 
</P>
<P>
"Jonathan," Radin said, beaming, "meet Laney Jacobs." 
</P>
<P>
Lawson poured champagne for all of them. Laney took cocaine from a small 
plastic compact she had in her purse. It opened up like two small dishes, with 
a little spoon that fit neatly inside. She ordered the white powder into lines 
on the coffee table. 
</P>
<P>
After an hour, Laney's cocaine was gone. She had more back at her house, and 
excitedly offered to show everyone the home she had bought. (Once there, Laney) 
proceeded to put some marijuana in a pipe, then invited Radin back into her 
bedroom, where they took drugs and talked. 
</P>
<P>
(The next morning) Lawson asked about Laney, and Radin beamed. She had a lot of 
cocaine, he said, adding that he was sure he would be seeing more of her. 
</P>
<P>
Lawson asked if that was all he saw in her, and Radin nodded his head. He 
seemed to have found the perfect Hollywood playmate. 
</P>
<P>
Laney's interest in Radin seemed to be for different reasons. She was intrigued 
by his vaudeville business, which had made him so successful at so young an 
age, and by his desire to become a Hollywood movie producer. She, too, wanted 
this, and knew Radin might be of great assistance to her. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-March, Laney sat with Radin and began talking in detail about her 
personal plans. Her goal was to finance and produce movies. This was the first 
indication that she had given Radin as to why she had moved to Los Angeles. 
Radin had assumed she was there to sell cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Then she mentioned that she had met Bob Evans, whom she described as eager to 
raise financing for a package of movies. She said she was currently in the 
process of helping him raise the funds. 
</P>
<P>
Radin asked how much Evans was looking for. Laney said millions of dollars. 
"Hell, I can do that," Radin boasted confidently. "That's no problem at all." 
</P>
<P>
A day or two later, Laney called the Regency and told Radin that she would be 
glad to introduce him to Evans. Radin excitedly jumped at the chance. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob Evans!" Radin yelled out to Lawson when he got off the phone. "That's 
incredible!" He paced around the room. "He produced 'The Godfather,' for God's 
sake. He's a legend." 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of March, Laney, Radin, and Evans met for lunch at a restaurant 
in Beverly Hills. Evans told Radin he wanted to make three pictures 
back-to-back. Radin brought up his Cotton Club idea and Evans said he had long 
thought of doing a movie about the club himself. Evans' idea was to make a film 
in the vein of "The Godfather," not a musical, as was Radin's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
After a three-year absence, Evans was determined to make his comeback. What was 
needed to make it happen was money, but now over lunch, with the bubbly, 
self-confident Radin boasting about his financial sources, this obstacle seemed 
about to crumble. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the warnings against Evans, Radin pressed ahead. The information 
that Evans was washed up meant, in Radin's view, that he could be controlled. 
</P>
<P>
"Here is a guy with a big Hollywood name, the former head of a studio," he told 
Lawson. "He's got a huge track record, and he is down-and-out and falling a 
mile a minute. I can control him. Do you see that?" 
</P>
<P>
At the end of March, Radin and Lawson returned to New York. Almost immediately 
after their arrival, Laney called, demanding to speak with Radin. 
</P>
<P>
When Radin got on the phone, she yelled (about her courier), "Do you know where 
Tally Rogers is?" 
</P>
<P>
"What are you talking about?" he asked. "Why would I know where he is?" 
</P>
<P>
"I want to know if you've seen him," she said. She was excited and angry. "The 
house has been ripped off. I'm out over a million and I think it's Tally, 
because he's disappeared. I want to know what you know about it." 
</P>
<P>
"Jesus Christ, lady," he said, "who are you to talk to me in that tone of 
voice?" 
</P>
<P>
Radin was shocked that she had that much cocaine in her house in the first 
place, but he knew nothing about any theft, and he told her so. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm out a million dollars," she yelled. "Do you know what that means?" 
</P>
<P>
Radin's goal was to conclude a deal with Bob Evans and to begin a new career as 
a movie producer. A theft from Laney's house was of no concern to him. 
</P>
<P>
After yelling at Radin, Laney went to see Marc Fogel at his rent-a-car office 
in Beverly Hills. One of the things Fogel had done for Laney was introduce her 
to his former lot manager, Bill Mentzer. A bodybuilder with thick dark-brown 
hair and a handsome face, Mentzer had become a bodyguard for Larry Flynt, the 
pornographer, who lived in Bel-Air. 
</P>
<P>
At Fogel's office, Laney told him about the theft. She explained that she was 
concerned enough about the theft to have hired Bill Mentzer to be her 
bodyguard. 
</P>
<P>
"I am going to have to pay for the drugs," she said. "I have to make good on 
this." 
</P>
<P>
Stealing cocaine was a death-penalty offense. With that in mind, Mentzer 
brought in several of his friends, most of whom hung out at a bodybuilding 
center in Santa Monica. One of them was an Argentine immigrant in his mid-20s 
named Alex Marti. Short and stocky, with a round, mean face and narrow eyes, 
Marti had also worked as a bodyguard for Larry Flynt. 
</P>
<P>
Marti loved guns, had a fascination with violence, craved money, and hated lots 
of people, but particularly Jews. A watercolor portrait of Adolf Hitler adorned 
one wall of his Los Angeles home, and he was a collector of books and writings 
about the Third Reich. He talked a lot about killing people; his most quoted 
remark was that to really put someone away, you had to shoot him in the back of 
the head. That was the way the Nazis did it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMING UP 
</P>
<P>
* FRIDAY: The prospect of a partnership between Roy Radin and producer Bob 
Evans enraged the woman who introduced them. Laney Jacobs wanted in on the deal 
to produce "The Cotton Club," which she felt she had put together. She also 
accused Radin of having knowledge of a $1-million cocaine theft from her 
garage, where she stored the powder before distribution. Despite the bad blood 
between them and warnings that she was dangerous, Radin agreed to meet with 
Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
* SUNDAY: After Roy Radin's disappearance, film producer Bob Evans, believing 
he was Jacob's next target, traveled to Las Vegas seeking help from two friends 
who he thought were connected to the Mob. 
</P>
<P>
Friday: Roy Radin disappears.

KIRK DOUGLAS: DEVIL OF A WRITER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN, TIMES SOCIETY WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kirk Douglas says he never gets lonely when he writes. "I play all the roles, 
act them out in my mind, the women, the children. Writing isn't lonely for me 
because I'm always with the characters I've created. And my wife says my 
writing has probably kept me from doing two or three lousy movies." 
</P>
<P>
The newest novelist on the celeb circuit was feted at a cocktail party hosted 
by literary agent Irving Lazar and Random House at Spago Tuesday evening. Fans, 
friends and media types crushed into Spago's back patio room, which became more 
and more like a sauna as the evening wore on. 
</P>
<P>
Random House Publisher Joni Evans was pleased with the sales for "Dance With 
the Devil" and with critics' initial notices. "There's an initial resistance 
(to a book like this); what do we need Kirk Douglas to be a novelist for? He's 
too talented in too many other directions. I was prepared for that resistance, 
and I tried to prepare Kirk for that." 
</P>
<P>
"The reviews are just coming in, and I was very pleased with the New York Times 
review," said Douglas, looking cool in a tan suit. "I must say I was prepared 
to have somebody kick me. . . . I thought they were going to say, 'This actor 
does his autobiography, now he comes out and writes a novel -- who does he 
think he is?' Well, I think I'm a writer." 
</P>
<P>
So does his son Michael. "He constantly amazes me," he said. "With his ability 
to juggle, play the ukulele, paint, all these languages he's learned, then to 
latch onto this, I think it's so wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
And will the son follow once again in his father's footsteps and write a book 
himself? 
</P>
<P>
"I can't even imagine it," he said. "Dad says I should think about getting a 
microphone or jotting things down, but to actually start from scratch, 
structuring things . . . I can't imagine it right now." 
</P>
<P>
Among the guests gasping for breathing space were Douglas' wife, Anne; other 
Douglas progeny, Joel and Peter; Irving and Mary Lazar; Carol and Walter 
Matthau; Barbara and Don Rickles; Jack Lemmon; Joanna Carson; Gloria and Jimmy 
Stewart; Fox's Barry Diller; Motown's Suzanne de Passe; Dani Janssen; Quincy 
Jones; George Schlatter; sculptor Marjorie Rothstein; Jack Valenti; Dinah 
Shore; Frank Gifford; Pat and Michael York; Gene Kelly, and Lance and John of 
the Hollywood Kids, who evidently had not crashed but were expelled by Lazar 
anyway.

MAYOR BLASTS NEA, AWARDS $3 MILLION IN CITY FUNDS; 
</P>
<P>
GRANTS: MORE THAN 200 LOCAL ARTISTS AND ORGANIZATIONS RECEIVE STIPENDS FROM THE 
CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Mayor Bradley and City Councilman Joel Wachs on Wednesday announced more than 
$3 million in 1990-91 grants through the Los Angeles Endowment for the Arts, 
with $538,214 going to individual artists, $61,600 going to fledgling groups, 
and more than $2.4 million divided among the city's established arts 
organizations. This was the first full-year grant cycle in which traditionally 
under-funded individual artists were eligible for city grants. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very proud of these grants," said Wachs, who in 1988 lead the effort to 
establish the multimillion-dollar arts fund, which is widely touted as a 
"windfall" for the city's artists. "They represent the cultural pluralism . . . 
and the widest range of viewpoints and beliefs which we originally envisioned 
in proposing the L.A. Endowment for the Arts. The grants (demonstrate) our 
recognition that artists have something to offer our city . . . and should be 
valued and compensated for that." 
</P>
<P>
After the City Hall press conference, the City Council unanimously and without 
discussion approved the 203 grants which totaled $3,015,549. They ranged from 
$125,000 to the L.A. Philharmonic Assn., to $1,000 to the emerging 
Asian-American Literature organization. 
</P>
<P>
The grants come in the midst of numerous cutbacks imposed citywide to make up a 
projected $100-million deficit. Although the grants amount to $500,000 less 
than the amount distributed in 1989-90, Wachs on Wednesday called the amount 
"very healthy and substantial -- and only the beginning (of endowment 
spending)." 
</P>
<P>
The city's endowment is basically a trust fund which is operating on $5.8 
million from the city's general fund. An additional $15 million or so is 
expected to be raised from fees on municipal and private developments. 
</P>
<P>
Both the grantees and the amounts of awards were determined by peer panels of 
artists and arts administrators from each of the 11 discipline categories. 
Grants were allocated in each discipline according to the application load and 
the amounts requested. A total of 1,013 grant applications were received. 
</P>
<P>
While the city's cultural affairs general manager, Adolfo Nodal, said he had 
worried that the amounts awarded for the last batch of city grants were too 
small and would not enable artists to complete their projects, he said he was 
more comfortable with this list of grantees and did not expect problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The tendency is still to spread the money around and fund more artists," Nodal 
said, noting that the peer panels which recommended the grants were required to 
fund at least one-half of the amount requested by grantees, or deny the grant. 
"They were told they couldn't nickel-and-dime them, so I don't think it will be 
a big problem. Nobody had a problem completing their project last time, and I 
was worried then." 
</P>
<P>
Grantees interviewed Wednesday were pleased by the amounts awarded. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really relieved," said performance artist Dan Kwong, who will put his 
$5,630 grant toward four August performances of his "Secrets of the Samurai 
Centerfielder" at East-West Players. "I knew that usually people do not get the 
amount of money they'd requested anyway, and I had thought that (because of 
city budget cuts) I might have gotten knocked down even more." Kwong had 
applied for a little more than $7,000, but said he will be able to scale down 
his budget to complete his performance. 
</P>
<P>
A big winner in the grant announcement was September's Los Angeles Festival, 
which will be directly or indirectly aided by more than 30 of the awards. 
Included is $75,000 for production of the L.A. Festival proper, an additional 
$14,000 for production of the connected Open Festival, and several awards to 
co-presenters of programs included under festival auspices. Festival programs 
receiving awards included $10,000 for a Chicano art exhibit at UCLA's Wight Art 
Gallery, $30,000 toward the restoration of a mural by David Alfaro Siqueiros 
and $2,500 for an Open Festival production of a multiethnic "Taming of the 
Shrew" by Will's Players. 
</P>
<P>
"We're thrilled," Festival executive director Judith Luther said of the grants, 
noting that the festival had counted on receiving only $50,000 for its own 
grant, one-third of the $150,000 it applied for.

ARTS CONTROVERSY: BRADLEY JOINS THE GROWING NATIONAL PROTEST AGAINST GRANT 
DENIALS. SOME OF THOSE IN THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT DRAMA ARE AWARDED CITY FUNDS.

Saying rejection of National Endowment for the Arts grants to four performance 
artists "amounts to an obscenity," Mayor Tom Bradley joined a national protest 
Wednesday demanding that those grants be awarded. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley took the position at a press conference where he also announced winners 
of more than $3 million in city cultural grants, a list that included several 
artists and arts organizations caught up in the endowment's controversy. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's meeting occurred as press conferences were held in Seattle and New 
York at which local city officials and artists attempted to turn up the heat on 
endowment Chairman John E. Frohnmayer and political opponents of the endowment. 
</P>
<P>
At the endowment in Washington, a spokeswoman said there would be no statement 
on the situation from Frohnmayer, who has been unavailable since he announced 
rejection of the four grants. 
</P>
<P>
The endowment has given no reason for the fellowship rejections, insisting that 
internal endowment policies preclude such public explanations. However, many 
observers say Frohnmayer denied the grants to quell a political furor created 
by conservatives angered over the sometimes explicit and politically charged 
content of the work of the four artists involved. Frohnmayer denied the grants 
after polling an unknown number of the endowment's 24-member advisory board. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said the City Hall press conference was intended to emphasize "our 
outrage at the actions of the NEA." The mayor demanded reversal of the actions 
by Frohnmayer, saying the chairman's fitness to remain in office may be open to 
question. "I want (Frohnmayer) to take an action to show me that he deserves to 
stay there," Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing with Bradley and City Councilman Joel Wachs were performance artists 
Tim Miller and John Fleck, two of the four grantees rejected nearly two weeks 
ago. Fleck and Miller, along with New York performers Karen Finley and Holly 
Hughes, jointly announced the filing of appeals. 
</P>
<P>
Appeals of grant denials are so rare that endowment officials have said 
established procedures may be so vague that the new situation could overwhelm 
the appeal mechanism. Potential grantees denied funding normally have 30 days 
to appeal such rulings. 
</P>
<P>
The press conference also included a statement by performance artist Rachel 
Rosenthal, who received -- then turned down -- an $11,250 endowment fellowship 
in the category in which the four other artists were rejected. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley and Adolfo Nodal, director of the Cultural Affairs Department, said 
that Miller, Fleck and Rosenthal were already receiving city arts funding, and 
were thus ineligible for this round. Bradley and Nodal emphasized that the city 
grant program was intended to encourage art in all media that addresses 
politically and socially sensitive issues. 
</P>
<P>
Also in attendance was choreographer Bella Lewitzky, who recently turned down 
$72,000 in endowment funding because she refused to sign an anti-obscenity 
certification required of all endowment grantees this year. The city grant 
announcement issued by Bradley showed that Lewitzky received $27,000. 
</P>
<P>
The city's grants also include a $2,555 award to artist Cheri Gaulke, who was 
recently targeted in an investigation by the U.S. General Accounting Office 
demanded by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), the endowment's most visible political 
opponent. Helms demanded that the GAO obtain the dates when Gaulke and several 
other artists showed work or performed at two New York City arts spaces over a 
six-year period. 
</P>
<P>
The city also awarded money for a variety of activist arts organizations that 
have been visible players in the endowment controversy, including PEN Center 
USA West ($14,000), Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions ($35,000) and the 
Otis/Parsons Art Institute ($23,200), whose institutional parent, the New 
School for Social Research in New York City, rejected a $45,000 grant and is 
suing the endowment to try to invalidate the anti-obscenity certification. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere: 
</P>
<P>
* More than 70 arts organizations released a joint statement in New York 
calling on Frohnmayer to reverse his decision on the four disputed grants, all 
of which involve performance artists who deal directly with gay or sexual 
political issues and most of whom occasionally appear partially unclothed 
during their performances. The statement was signed by such mainstream groups 
as the American Arts Alliance, American Symphony Orchestra League, Artists' 
Equity, American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, Lincoln Center, 
Dance USA and Chamber Music America. 
</P>
<P>
* Fourteen of the 18 performance artists originally recommended for fellowships 
-- including the four rejected grantees -- released a statement saying "we are 
appalled, dismayed and angered by the cynical and clearly political decision." 
The rejections, the statement charged, were issued "to appease the homophobic, 
misogynist and racist agenda of the far right minority who, in demanding 
blacklisting, are not only destroying the integrity of the NEA but are, 
reminiscent of the demagogues of the 1950s, eroding the First Amendment rights 
of all Americans." 
</P>
<P>
* The seven-member endowment review panel that recommended the grants in the 
first place issued a new protest statement saying its members stand by all of 
their recommendations, including the four rejected by Frohnmayer, and saying 
the panel members deplore the action "and the political manipulations which 
prompted it." The panel said the episode has "done great damage to the artists 
involved . . . and to the National Endowment for the Arts itself." The panel 
members said they, too, would support the artists' appeals. 
</P>
<P>
* In separate press statements, New York Mayor David Dinkins and Seattle Mayor 
Norman B. Rice said they joined with Bradley in demanding that Frohnmayer act 
to reverse the grant denials. Rice said he was pleased that Miller and Hughes 
had just performed at his city's Goodwill Arts Festival and he charged that the 
rejected grantees "have been singled out for political reasons, not aesthetic 
ones." Dinkins said: "We must fight restrictions on creative endeavor, or the 
concept of artistic freedom will wither under the dark cloud of censorship." 
</P>
<P>
"We are joining with (the New York and Seattle mayors) to express our 
opposition to Mr. Frohnmayer's action and to ask that these applicants be 
reconsidered," Bradley said. Wachs, an arts supporter on the City Council, 
declared that "the arts have to be free in order to survive" and warned of "a 
dark and ominous cloud that threatens . . . artistic freedom." 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the city arts grants, Nodal -- himself a former endowment 
official -- said the Los Angeles winners represent "the best in American art 
today." He said that the selections had been made by a series of peer review 
panels with uncompromising ethics, charged with selecting the best art in the 
region, regardless of politics, sexual orientation or potential for 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what the endowment used to do," Nodal said. "We've lost that with the 
endowment." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal said that she and her parents had escaped from her native France in 
the late 1930s as the Nazi threat developed. "It's a really difficult period. I 
would not want to live anywhere else," she said of the United States. But, she 
said, "I find that suddenly, I am being called upon to sign my name to a 
statement . . . that I may in the future be found to have created and produced 
obscenities. 
</P>
<P>
"That, itself, is an obscenity."

FUNDING REFLECTS THE DIVERSITY OF '90 L.A. FESTIVAL; 
</P>
<P>
ARTS: ASIAN COMPANIES AND LOCAL MINORITY-OWNED BUSINESSES AND GROUPS ARE 
JOINING TRADITIONAL U.S. CORPORATE SPONSORS FOR THIS YEAR'S $4.7-MILLION EVENT.

<P>
When 1990's Los Angeles Festival kicks off in September, not only will the 
talent in this celebration of Pacific Rim culture come from faraway places -- 
so will much of the money power behind the event. 
</P>
<P>
Like the 1987 Los Angeles Festival, this year's arts extravaganza is another 
incarnation of the successful 1984 Olympic Arts Festival. But unlike the 1987 
festival, this year's event is backed not just by the handful of wealthy 
American companies traditionally known to dabble in the arts, but by Asian 
businesses and local minority-owned businesses and organizations as well. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in fund raising for 25 years, and I've never seen the kind of fund 
raising that's come out of all the minority communities," said Judith Luther, 
executive director of the Los Angeles Festival. "There's something about what 
we're doing that touches them in a way that the other projects I've been 
involved with has not." 
</P>
<P>
Said City Councilman Michael Woo: "The festival is to be commended for not 
rounding up the usual suspects in terms of corporate support. I think this is 
the first time a major cultural event in Los Angeles has reflected the 
diversity of the city." 
</P>
<P>
Except for a small donation from the British Council, $3 million of the 
$6-million 1987 festival's budget came from American businesses; the rest came 
from government sources. Moreover, those private American dollars came from 
white-owned corporations and foundations; the largest donors included 
Occidental Petroleum Corp., General Motors, the Rockefeller Foundation and 
Times Mirror, which owns the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
But money for this year's $4.7-million arts fest includes a whopping $1 
million-to-date from the Asian Consortium, an organization of Japanese 
corporations, as well as $50,000 raised by Los Angeles' black community, 
$30,000 contributed by two local Latino businesses, and some $3,000 from 
Korean-American organizations. Festival organizers predict still more money 
from Filipino-American and Chinese-American sources in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
Funds from minority groups represent an even more significant percentage to the 
whole since most of 1987's corporate donors, as well as its government backers, 
have radically cut back. (Times Mirror, for example, donated $500,000 to the 
1987 festival and $250,000 to the 1990 event). Support from local and national 
government grants has also dropped -- from $3 million in 1987 to just over 
$500,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
Luther and festival director Peter Sellars, who is donating his $100,000 salary 
to the festival, said that although not all the donations from minority donors 
are as large as the $1 million from Japanese corporations, even the smallest 
check represents the city's ethnic groups attempting to support each other 
rather than facing off in their own camps. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to say that this is the first time the Japanese Business Assn. (also 
known as the Asian Consortium) has stepped forward with funding for a project 
that is not Japanese," Sellars said. "I'd like to think of the festival as a 
platform and an avenue for this kind of participation." 
</P>
<P>
At the request of Mayor Tom Bradley, Yukiyasu Togo, president of Toyota Sales 
USA, spearheaded the fund-raising effort in the Japanese business community; 
Toyota has donated $100,000 to the event. "This festival really has the 
potential for breaking down barriers and getting people to work together," said 
Jeff Smith, corporate spokesman for Togo. 
</P>
<P>
Sellars and Luther both noted that the black community chose to support the 
1990 festival even though this year's focus is on the Pacific Rim countries, 
including South America and Australia. The support represents a healing of 
friction between black artists and festival organizers in 1987, when members of 
Dance Umbrella, a service organization for black dancers, charged that local 
black dance troupes had been left out of the festival. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I started going out publicizing this, what I always got was, 
'There's nothing in it for black and white people,' " Luther said. "It's true 
that primary focus of this festival is on the cultures of the Pacific. But the 
next festival, the next big cultural festival will be about the countries of 
Africa and the Middle East. It would be real hard to go to (Afro-American) 
donors next time and say 'We want you to support us' if they aren't at the 
table this time." 
</P>
<P>
In March, members of Los Angeles First A.M.E. Church and other predominantly 
black congregations raised $50,000 for the festival with performances of the 
gospel opera "Job" at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre. Dr. Thomas Kilgore Jr., 
pastor emeritus of the Second Baptist Church, said he was "not at all pleased" 
with the lack of involvement of the city's ethnic groups in the 1987 festival 
and cited the 1990 festival as a chance to break the pattern. 
</P>
<P>
"My own complaint about the 1987 festival was that it was too Eurocentric," 
Kilgore said. "There is no city that has the kind of ethnic mix that L.A. has. 
. . . We want it to be a people's festival." 
</P>
<P>
Some involved in this festival believe that forging ties with the Pacific Rim 
through supporting its artists makes good business sense. 
</P>
<P>
"The 1990s is going to be the decade of the Pacific Rim," said architect 
Raymond Chang, who owns Alhambra's Hannon Development Co. "The import and 
export, the business activities, the amount of immigration to the West Coast -- 
that definitely makes a difference to the people of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Chang has teamed up with Jimmy Au, a Chinese-born businessman who owns Jimmy 
Au's Small and Short clothing store chain, to bring all the ethnic groups 
together with the Nikkodo International Karaoke Contest, a singing contest with 
representatives of each group taking part. 
</P>
<P>
Julia Nagano, public information director for the Port of Los Angeles where 
some festival events will take place, said the port, located in San Pedro, 
became involved not only to publicize the port facilities, but also because "a 
lot of customers and clients have to do with the Pacific Rim countries as well 
as European countries." But Luther noted that the non-European character of the 
festival first made fund raising more difficult. "There is no question that 
it's easier to raise money for the Royal Shakespeare Festival . . . than for 
the aborigines of Australia," she said. "I mean, there are not a lot of big 
aboriginal corporations saying 'Let me give you dough.' " 
</P>
<P>
Sellars agreed: "I think for awhile there was a tendency for a number of blue 
chip, officially white companies to think of sitting this one out. I initially 
had one prominent CEO in L.A. say to me: 'If these people want a festival, they 
can pay for it. . . . And of course, there are those who say, 'Why would we 
want to support the work of all these people whose names we can't pronounce?' 
The fact is, you probably couldn't pronounce the names of the first cast of 
Paris Opera Ballet, either, but people are trained to think of that as real 
culture." 
</P>
<P>
Sellars added that such attitudes have changed dramatically since the fund 
raising began. Cutbacks in corporate funding this year, for the most part 
reflect the economic climate, he said, rather than a rejection of the festival 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
Festival organizers have still not managed to coax much money out of the 
entertainment industry. Although Sellars predicts the situation will change, 
approaches to such powerful players as Fox Inc. chairman Barry Diller and 
Disney Co. chairman Michael Eisner have so far resulted in no donations. "It is 
shocking to me that the Afro-American community will give us ($50,000), and we 
can't get it out of Hollywood," Luther said. "It's a scandal -- it's just a 
scandal." 
</P>
<P>
Tom McGovern, vice president of Raleigh Studios, is one of few entertainment 
executives seeking to raise festival funds through luncheons and other efforts, 
acknowledges the difficulty in getting Hollywood dollars. "I'm a little 
surprised, because we've tried really hard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a puzzle to me, because people who normally come out in support of 
the arts have been reluctant. Maybe they're afraid that if people are spending 
their money on live entertainment, they won't be going to the movies."

CALIFORNIA ASSESSMENT PROGRAM TEST SCORES;

<P>
STUDENTS GET THE GOOD WORD; TEST SHOWS IMPROVED WRITING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
High-school students throughout San Diego County showed strong improvement in 
their writing skills, exceeding the growth displayed by their peers across 
California, in the latest results from the nation's most comprehensive 
standardized writing test being released today. 
</P>
<P>
The gains give heart to state schools Supt. Bill Honig and especially to county 
educators who have pushed hard for increased writing instruction at all grade 
levels during the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
Scores from the second year of the California Assessment Program essay test for 
12th-graders taken last December show county students raised their average 
score to 272 from 258, compared with a gain to 256 from 250 for all seniors 
statewide. 
</P>
<P>
(Essays are graded by teams of teachers on a range from 1 to 6, with 6 being 
the best possible essay, and then converted by the State Department of 
Education into scaled scores on a range from 100 to 400. CAP does not provide 
individual student scores but only scores for schools and districts as a 
measure of whether state educational goals are being met.) 
</P>
<P>
In particular, students in the San Diego Unified School District -- the 
nation's eighth-largest urban system -- boosted their scores to 261 from the 
246 recorded on the first CAP direct-writing test in December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The district, with 6,000 of the county's 20,000 seniors, posted its substantial 
gain despite increased numbers of students with limited English skills -- 4.2% 
of the total in 1988 to 7% in 1989. Madison, Hoover and San Diego high schools, 
all with large numbers of limited-English and nonwhite students, made jumps of 
more than 40 points in their scores. 
</P>
<P>
Impressive gains were also registered by the San Marcos, Carlsbad, and 
Escondido districts in North County, although San Dieguito remained tops in the 
county, with a scaled score of 338. Only the heavily nonwhite Oceanside and 
Sweetwater districts, and the rural single-school Mountain Empire district 
scored below the state averages, although they all also showed gains over the 
first-year scores. 
</P>
<P>
The CAP writing results are carefully noted by educators, since the test is on 
the cutting edge of a nationwide reform movement to require more essay- and 
performance-based testing rather than multiple-choice exams. 
</P>
<P>
As such, the test requires students to show what they have learned rather than 
simply provide information about style, grammar and content. A similar essay 
test is given to all state eighth-graders and will be expanded to elementary 
grades in the next couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the improvement shows that we have demystified writing" both for 
teachers and students "by taking it out of the abstract and explaining it in 
concrete terms," Tom Boysen, superintendent of the County Office of Education, 
said Wednesday. "And the results show that gains can be accomplished at any 
school, given good, sustained instruction." 
</P>
<P>
His office has sponsored a host of efforts to help teachers improve their 
writing instruction, as well as operating both the College-Ready Writers and 
High School-Ready Writers projects at the secondary school level to provide 
cash incentives for schools showing strong improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"We've created good performance standards through the CAP test and made it 
important for people to pay attention, so that they have clear, focused targets 
to which they can judge their teaching," Boysen said, crediting UC San Diego 
literature and writing professor Charles Cooper for developing the state's 
direct-writing assessment. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper has stressed that students need to practice all kinds of writings, that 
gains in literacy are connected to specific uses, and that both teachers and 
students need to be encouraged to enjoy writing as a discipline. 
</P>
<P>
School districts throughout the county have now adopted new literature-based 
reading instruction programs, where reading and writing are taught together 
rather than separated into discrete subjects. 
</P>
<P>
But Boysen said that the higher scores should not satisfy anyone yet. 
</P>
<P>
"The new data shows that 57% of our students in the county now do acceptably 
well on the essays, which means that they are graded with a 4 or better," 
Boysen said, "but our top high school in the county, Torrey Pines High School 
(in the San Dieguito district), has 78% of its students at 4 or better. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that, while we should be pleased to be at 57%, we should be asking 
ourselves how we can get the entire county to 78%." 
</P>
<P>
The CAP test requires students to write timed essays in one or more types of 
writing: autobiographical; evaluation of an argument; interpretation of an 
argument; reflection on an abstract idea; position on a controversy; 
observation of an incident. 
</P>
<P>
In statewide data not yet available at the county or district levels, Honig 
said that Asian students improved to 260 from 253, black students improved to 
215 from 209, and Latinos students improved to 218 from 212. 
</P>
<P>
Honig said that non-native English speakers with English fluency, who 
constitute 14% of the statewide senior class, increased their scores seven 
points, to 243 from 236. But limited-English speaking students, 7% of the 
total, dropped five points statewide, to 153 from 158. 
</P>
<P>
In survey questions asked as part of the test, students indicated how many 
writing assignments they do each week, how much time they spend on homework and 
how much they read for pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
Scores were higher for those students who did more assignments, read more and 
spent more time on homework -- results that while not surprising are 
nevertheless stressed by Honig as part of his "bully pulpit" effort to improve 
attitudes toward education. 
</P>
<P>
Students with only one writing assignment per week averaged 253, compared with 
a score of 283 with students doing 11 or more per week. Students with two or 
more hours of homework daily averaged 304, and those who read for pleasure one 
or more hours per day averaged 310. 
</P>
<P>
"The outcome once again demonstrates that, the more students write, as called 
for in the new state English/Language Arts curriculum framework, the better 
they perform academically," Honig said. 
</P>
<P>
Boysen agreed, adding that he hopes students will be asked next year whether 
they enjoy writing more, given the increased emphasis and practice in schools. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOW TO READ THE SCORES 
</P>
<P>
These are the San Diego County school-by-school results of the California 
Assessment Program's writing exam administered last winter to high school 
seniors throughout the state. During one class period, students are required to 
write an essay from one of six general categories: autobiographical incident, 
evaluation, interpretation, reflective essay, controversial issue and 
observational writing. Each essay is graded for thinking and writing skills as 
well as for basic mechanics, such as spelling and grammar. 
</P>
<P>
The CAP program is designed to measure the progress of schools and not 
youngsters individually. The grades are combined into a single scaled score, 
ranging from 1 to more than 400. 
</P>
<P>
The statewide average was 250 for the class of 1989 and 256 for the class of 
1990. The average score for San Diego County was 258 in 1989 and 272 in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Results are listed by school district and by individual high school so that 
parents can compare the performance of youngsters in their community with that 
of students in the rest of the county. (Schools are listed alphabetically by 
district.) 
</P>
<P>
* State Rank shows how the school or district did in relation to all others in 
the state. The range is from 1 to 99, with 99 being best. 
</P>
<P>
* Relative Rank provides a way to compare a district or school with others 
whose students are similar in terms of ethnic makeup and socioeconomic level 
and in their ability to speak English fluently, as well as how often those 
students move from school to school. 
</P>
<P>
For example, seniors at Poway Unified, with a score of 307, did better than 92% 
of others in California. But they did better than only 65% of other students 
with similar backgrounds. Granite Hills students, on the other hand, did almost 
as well when compared with similar students as when compared with students 
statewide. With their score of 270, Granite Hills students earned a statewide 
ranking of 67 and a relative ranking of 65.

Citing an increase in gang violence and homicides, Santa Ana City Councilman 
Richards L. Norton said Wednesday that he wants to ask voters in November to 
support a special property tax that would add 20 police officers to the city's 
351-member department. 
</P>
<P>
"We're losing the battle on the streets," Norton said, "and the bad guys are 
winning." 
</P>
<P>
Norton said he will ask the City Council on Monday to seek an "advisory" signal 
from voters on a police benefit assessment district proposal that would 
increase property taxes by an average of $50. 
</P>
<P>
The $1.5 million that would annually be raised would go into a special fund to 
hire the additional officers, Norton said. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1988, voters in Inglewood overwhelmingly gave its City Council 
approval to become the first city in the state to establish an assessment 
district for more police protection. Supporters of the assessment fees say that 
Inglewood voters were persuaded to vote for such an increase after drug-related 
arrests ballooned in that city. After the fees were established, Inglewood was 
able to raise $1.5 million a year and hire 20 more officers for its 187-member 
force, said Inglewood Assistant City Manager Norman Y. Cravens. 
</P>
<P>
According to state law, voters can raise taxes for police protection with a 
two-thirds vote. But city councils also have the ability to establish special 
assessment districts that require residents to pay extra fees for more police 
officers, Norton said. 
</P>
<P>
"The ballot will basically ask residents whether they are fed up with the crime 
situation and want to get the problem solved," Norton said. 
</P>
<P>
Norton acknowledged that many voters could oppose the plan simply because it 
relies on a tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
"I realize it might be an unpopular stance especially in election year," said 
Norton, who is up for reelection this November. "But there is not enough fat on 
our budget to pay (for more officers.) If we don't do something soon we're 
going to have bigger problems." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, the City Council will also vote on a $218-million budget that 
allocates $43.8 million to the police. 
</P>
<P>
Police Capt. Peter Jensen said his department has not received any details on 
the district assessment plan and was unable to comment on it. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Daniel H. Young said he also has not seen a copy of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Don Blankenship, president of the Santa Ana Police Officers Assn., said he 
endorses the proposal as long as the money is directly targeted for the police 
force. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in total support if the money is going to be used to hire police 
officers," Blankenship said. "We don't want the public to be flimflammed by 
politicians and the money goes elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
In February, the City Council turned down an assessment district proposal to 
pay for a four-day-a-week, 10-hour-a-day work schedule for its police officers 
despite arguments from supporters who said that such schedules attract officers 
to Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
In a state report released last fall, statistics showed that violent crime in 
Santa Ana had risen 28.4% over the year before, a bigger increase than any 
other of the county's six largest cities. In 1989, Santa Ana had 53 homicides, 
up from 38. 
</P>
<P>
Since April, Santa Ana police have maintained a special weekend patrol in 
neighborhoods occupied by the city's estimated 7,000 gang members. Police Chief 
Paul M. Walters established the team to counter a burst of gang violence in 
April that left two people dead and several others seriously wounded.

PADRES: MCKEON STEPS ASIDE, RIDDOCH STEPS IN;

<P>
RIDDOCH'S PROSPECTS? DEPENDS ON PLAYERS

<P>
While the men in suits were upstairs Wednesday, announcing that Jack McKeon had 
decided to step down as Padre manager in favor of dugout coach Greg Riddoch, 
Jack Clark was putting it all in perspective in the clubhouse below. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't fire every player," Clark said. "So it's a step in the right 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
The point was that the Padres were just about bad enough during the first half 
of this season to justify a mass dismissal. Fans were supposed to be able to 
look at the standings by now and have an easy time locating the Padres atop the 
NL West. Instead, they can be found keeping a low profile, stuck in fourth 
place between the Dodgers and Atlanta, 13 1/2 games out. 
</P>
<P>
So McKeon has decided to remain as vice president of baseball operations and 
leave Riddoch, known for his aggressive style and ability to communicate, to 
restore a bit of order on the field. And, sure, it might work. But the feeling 
among many of the Padres is that it will have a lot more to do with what they 
do with their bats and gloves than what Riddoch does with his vocal chords. 
</P>
<P>
"We just changed managers, we didn't change players," said center fielder Joe 
Carter. "We've still got to go out there and play. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people say 'I can't play for this guy, I can't play for that guy.' That's 
a bunch of baloney. The manager can only put you out there. He can't tell you 
when to swing, when not to swing, what pitch to throw, how to catch the ball. 
It doesn't matter who's the manager, whether it's your son or your daughter or 
whatever." 
</P>
<P>
Still, a number of the Padres have been through managerial changes in the past 
and it has often been a positive experience. After Larry Bowa was fired in May, 
1988, McKeon took over and led the team to a 67-48 record and third-place 
finish. Few Padres are willing to speculate as to whether a replay of that lies 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," pitcher Bruce Hurst said. "Who knows? It's just up to us to 
play better baseball. Greg is certainly qualified to be manager. Now it's up to 
the players. Hopefully we can right this ship up and get going." 
</P>
<P>
That is exactly what happened when Hurst was in a similar situation with the 
Boston Red Sox in 1988. John McNamara was fired in July and replaced by Joe 
Morgan. Under Morgan, the Red Sox went 46-31, including 24 consecutive home 
victories, and won the American League East. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying that's going to happen here," Hurst said. "And I don't know how 
much a manager has a play in that, but it did happen, and hopefully we can do 
something like that here." 
</P>
<P>
Players were mildly surprised but generally supportive of the move to Riddoch. 
This is his fourth season as a Padre coach, and he is well-liked and respected 
for his knowledge of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Greg is the type of guy who has gotten us through some tough times," 
outfielder Shawn Abner said. "He's more of a talk-to-you guy (than McKeon)." 
</P>
<P>
Said left fielder Bip Roberts: "He's like a psychologist. He's got a lot of 
experience. Any time I've had problems, he's always come and talked to me and 
helped me straighten them out." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres may be playing a snappier brand of baseball under Riddoch, who 
favors aggressiveness in all areas of the game.

"I think having Riddoch in there is a plus, because now you have a different 
attitude as far as the way he wants to play the game," shortstop Garry 
Templeton said. "I look for us to be a little bit more aggressive on the base 
paths, at the plate and in the field." 
</P>
<P>
And good for McKeon, who up until now has been in the office all day and in the 
dugout all night. Players couldn't help but take notice of his hectic schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"He leaves late and gets here early," Templeton said. "He's at the ballpark all 
day. I think handling two jobs put a little stress on him. This gives him a 
better chance to evaluate the team." 
</P>
<P>
Said Clark: "I think it's a tough position to be in doing two jobs. It's like 
trying to be a pitcher and a hitter. It's tough enough to try to do one good 
let alone both of them good. I think this will just make the organization 
better, and that's the bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
Really, though, the bottom line is that the Padres have an awfully long climb 
back to first. Whether a fresh start under a new manager will set a fire 
remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a new beginning for us," Roberts said. "But we're still 14 games out, so 
it's not really a new beginning."

<P>
DARE, law enforcement's highly touted drug resistance program, does not deter 
children already exposed to beer, wine or the crack pipe, but it appears to 
dissuade the ones who have yet to give drugs a try, according to a study by two 
Cal State Long Beach criminologists. 
</P>
<P>
Although the number of Long Beach fifth-graders who discovered cigarettes, 
beer, wine, hard liquor or glue increased slightly in spite of their DARE 
instruction, the increase was not nearly as high as among those students who 
received no drug resistance education, the recently released study of more than 
3,000 Long Beach schoolchildren shows. 
</P>
<P>
The seven-month project by criminologists Michael Agopian and Harold K. Becker 
is the first attempt locally to measure the success of DARE (Drug Abuse 
Resistance Education), a 5-year-old program that sends police officers to the 
classroom with an arsenal of just-say-no persuaders. 
</P>
<P>
The research attempts to measure the local impact of an idea that began in Los 
Angeles in 1983 and has since spread to more than 2,000 cities in 49 states, as 
well as Canada, Australia, New Zealand and American Samoa. At the same time, 
the study provides a glimpse of the role drugs play in the lives of Long Beach 
schoolchildren whose average age is 10. 
</P>
<P>
The study showed that students who already use drugs were not compelled to 
quit. "What the numbers tell us is that DARE does not reduce usage of almost 
anything -- cigarettes, hard liquor, cocaine. Kids don't simply stop using," 
Agopian said. "They don't abstain." 
</P>
<P>
To Cpl. Dale Malec, one of seven Long Beach police DARE instructors, the study 
still shows progress. "The kid stays off crack, but he drinks a little alcohol. 
To me, that's a success," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of the fall semester last year, written questionnaires were 
distributed to all fifth-grade classes in Long Beach. Half of the classes were 
to receive DARE instruction, and half were not. The students were surveyed 
again at the end of the semester to measure the impact of the instruction. 
</P>
<P>
According to the numbers, 7% of the students reported having used drugs, 
cigarettes or alcohol. The most popular vice was beer, which as many as 17% of 
the children said they drank once or twice a month during the previous 
two-month period. Wine was a close second with as many as 16% of the students 
reporting having consumed it. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, only 1% of the children said they had ever used cocaine and only 
2% reported experimenting with amphetamines. 
</P>
<P>
At the semester's end, not a single student said the instruction had persuaded 
him to stop using a drug, and some who had never used drugs started anyway. The 
number of students who used cigarettes jumped from 10% to 12%; beer consumption 
edged from 17% to 18%; wine consumption grew from 16% to 18%; hard liquor 
consumption went from 6% to 7%; and the use of inhalants grew from 8% to 10%, 
the study showed. 
</P>
<P>
Although that news was less than uplifting, the reports from the children who 
had not taken DARE was worse, Agopian said. 
</P>
<P>
While only 2% of DARE students began drinking wine during the semester, a 
whopping 12% of the children without DARE had taken up the practice, the study 
showed. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, 1% of the DARE children began drinking beer while 10% of the 
non-DARE students fell prey, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if it doesn't stop drug abuse, it is extremely valuable in educating 
kids," Agopian said. "Drug use among students is developmental -- it starts 
with cigarettes, sniffing glue. It goes on to marijuana and cocaine. If we can 
maintain or slow that drug-use pattern in the fourth, fifth and sixth grades, 
it gives us time to provide more education." 
</P>
<P>
School officials said they were pleased with DARE's successes and hardly 
surprised by its limitations. 
</P>
<P>
"It is particularly hard to impact attitudes about alcohol," said Karla Taylor, 
drug and gang education coordinator for the Long Beach Unified School District. 
"I was gratified that it slowed alcohol abuse down." 
</P>
<P>
The study looked almost solely for immediate shifts in behavior -- namely, 
whether a child stopped or started using a drug during the three-month period. 
It was not intended to measure the long-term affect of DARE on children who 
might be deterred from ever using a drug over the years, the surveyors said. 
</P>
<P>
The authors concluded that DARE succeeds in stopping children from 
experimenting with drugs, but should be reinforced with more education 
throughout the scholastic career. 
</P>
<P>
"All of society has to join in," Taylor said. "From the words Hugs Not Drugs on 
a dumpster, to billboards to DARE, the uniform effort from all directions is 
finally beginning to make some teeny bit of a difference. Five years ago, that 
wasn't happening."

Barbara Emerson says she can tell when she's near Roch Courreges Elementary 
School in Fountain Valley just by the crackle and low hum of the nearby power 
lines. And like a growing number of concerned parents here, she believes those 
sounds mean danger. 
</P>
<P>
"What parent would ever send her child into a school that could mean their 
death?" Emerson said, reflecting the fervor common among those worried about 
the potential health effects of the utility equipment. "There's just too much 
evidence that points to uncertainty over these power lines." 
</P>
<P>
Power company officials and some scientists insist that the fears are unfounded 
-- that there is no proof electromagnetic fields from the power equipment pose 
a public health threat. The amount of exposure from high-tension wires, they 
argue, is no greater than from household appliances such as toasters and 
electric shavers. 
</P>
<P>
"In 22 years and more than $50 million in research, no one has ever 
conclusively proved (that electromagnetic fields are) dangerous to health," 
said Kirby Holte, a scientist for Southern California Edison Co. 
</P>
<P>
But Emerson, citing studies that suggest a possible link to some cancers, is 
not convinced. And tonight she will lead 40 members of a parent group before 
the Fountain Valley School District Board of Trustees to demand independent 
tests of every classroom and schoolyard in the 5,900-student, 12-school 
district. 
</P>
<P>
So far, tests by parents and schools officials have found widely different 
levels of electromagnetic intensity. 
</P>
<P>
Parents are particularly concerned about 600-student Roch Courreges, because 
high-tension wires carrying 500 kilovolts (500,000 volts) stand less than 100 
yards from the playground. 
</P>
<P>
"This issue is no longer an isolated event," said Emerson, mother of three. "It 
concerns the whole community now. We can no longer sit here and endanger our 
children and the community's lives." 
</P>
<P>
High-tension wires and substations have been an integral part of the suburban 
landscape for years. Recent studies, however, have raised questions about 
whether the power equipment poses a health threat. 
</P>
<P>
Public health officials say the dangers posed by electromagnetic fields are 
poorly understood, but acknowledge that evidence is mounting that long-term 
exposure to the electric fields may increase the risk of leukemia and brain 
tumors. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago, most scientists thought EMFs (electromagnetic fields) were not 
harmful," said Richard Guimond, director of the Office of Radiation Programs 
for the federal Environmental Protection Agency in Washington. "But since that 
time, with the increased amount of data available, more and more of them are 
re-evaluating their positions. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying it's time to go to the roof and start screaming," Guimond said. 
"But the evidence is getting stronger that there may be a link between these 
waves and cancer. There still needs to be a lot of questions answered and more 
research done." 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Health Services, in a draft report issued in June, 
cited recent health studies that conclude that fields of more than 3.0 
milligausses can almost double the risk of cancer, posing the same kind of 
threat as second-hand smoke. A milligauss is unit of measurement of magnetic 
field strength. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, the expected rate of cancer in the general population is one in 
10,000 children. The state report cites studies showing that the presence of 
both electromagnetic fields and second-hand smoke increases the number of 
cancer cases to between 1.5 and 2 per 10,000 children. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, studies during the last three years have suggested that continuous 
exposure to a field stronger than 3 milligausses can increase the incidence of 
childhood cancer. 
</P>
<P>
At Roch Courreges School, measurements varied widely, depending on who took 
them. The school district and Southern California Edison found levels between 
0.8 and 1.5 milligausses throughout the grounds, said Cheryl Norton, district 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
But Allen Brandt, the attorney representing the parents group, said his 
measurements show concentrations as high as 25 milligausses. A reading of 15 
milligausses was registered on the kindergarten playground, he said. 
</P>
<P>
No one can explain the wide discrepancy in the readings, but they were taken 
after Emerson and her parents' group filed a lawsuit against the district in 
February to keep their children out of the school. The district plans to 
transfer 30 students to the school from Fountain Valley Elementary School, 
which it recently closed. 
</P>
<P>
The parents lost the legal challenge in May when an Orange County Superior 
Court judge ruled that the school district followed proper procedure in 
determining that the electrical fields near Roch Courreges were not dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
The case, however, gained national note last week when it was mentioned 
prominently in New Yorker magazine in an extensive series on the alleged 
dangers of power equipment. And the parents have continued a crusade against 
power lines and substations that is now gaining attention elsewhere in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome R. Thornsley, superintendent of Capistrano Unified School District, said 
the issue of electromagnetic fields first caught his eye when he saw it 
discussed on the "60 Minutes" television show. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a bit unsettling," said Thornsley, who subsequently postponed plans by 
the district to install a cellular transmission tower near an elementary 
school. 
</P>
<P>
In North Tustin, an unincorporated area, a number of residents are banding 
together to fight plans by Southern California Edison Co. to convert a 
temporary substation on 17th Street into a permanent facility. The county is 
preparing an environmental impact report on the proposal at the request of 
Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, who says residents have expressed their concern to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Edison officials have consistently maintained that their 
facilities pose no appreciable health risks. 
</P>
<P>
"This whole issue of EMFs as a health risk came up roughly 22 years ago in a 
paper in the Soviet Union," said Holte, the SCE scientist who also is a 
professor at USC. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent meeting with north Tustin residents, the company tried to allay 
fears by handing out a booklet prepared by Carnegie Mellon University in 
Pittsburgh. While the booklet tries to answer questions about electromagnetic 
fields, it also warns that living near power equipment may double or triple the 
risk of cancer. In contrast, it says cigarette smoking increases the risk 20 to 
60 times. 
</P>
<P>
North Tustin residents, such as those in Fountain Valley, aren't comforted. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody really knows what is the frequency that affects cells in your body," 
said Linda Primrose of Newport Beach, who has joined the North Tustin fight 
because her three grandchildren live directly behind the substation.

O.C. SWINDLERS DETAIL PHONE SCAMS FOR PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two convicted swindlers who ran wildly profitable but fraudulent telephone 
marketing boiler rooms in Orange County told members of Congress on Wednesday 
how their salesmen bilked innocent "mooches" out of millions of dollars in 
phony coin and oil-lease schemes. 
</P>
<P>
"In the companies I was personally involved with, I saw over $75 million get 
taken down," said a former scam operator, who used the alias John Albright. 
</P>
<P>
Albright, who is cooperating with federal authorities in other fraud 
investigations, wore a black hood, sat behind screens and testified through a 
voice modulator during his appearance before the consumer affairs subcommittee 
of the House Committee on Government Operations. 
</P>
<P>
Another con artist, Stephen P. Bederson, testified that he helped run an Irvine 
telephone scam called Midwest Mineral Properties in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"The objective was to steal as much money from the victim as possible, within a 
two-month period, before the client started questioning the whereabouts of his 
guaranteed refund," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony of the telephone swindlers highlighted the first day of 
subcommittee hearings on fraudulent telephone marketing operations. The panel 
is considering possible changes in federal law that would help enforcement 
officials crack down on the scams. 
</P>
<P>
Centered largely in Southern California and Florida, the fraudulent operations 
cost unsuspecting Americans billions of dollars a year, according to 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Boiler-room artists use telephone banks to sell everything from vitamins and 
vacation packages to investments in precious metals and foreign currencies, 
often without delivering any merchandise. On those occasions when a customer 
does receive something, it often is worth far less than he paid. 
</P>
<P>
Also testifying Wednesday were law enforcement officials and three victims of 
telemarketing fraud. Two widows, one 84 and the other 90, said they lost life 
savings of $20,000 and $750,000, respectively, in frauds involving investments 
in a movie company and foreign currencies. 
</P>
<P>
"I worry constantly about a future without any savings," said Grace L. 
Singletary, 84, of Dawson, Ga., who sent off a total of $20,000 to "Chariot 7 
Productions" in California after a man who told her that he was a "native 
Nebraska boy brought up with high morals" persuaded her to invest in a film 
project. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, small-business owner Orlo Ellison described how office supply 
telemarketers corrupted his bookkeeper with personal gifts and then, with her 
assistance, billed his company $100,000 for merchandise that was actually worth 
about $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California, especially Orange County, is the "boiler-room fraud 
capital" of the United States, several law enforcement authorities testified. 
</P>
<P>
Many scam operators set up shop in Newport Beach and nearby areas simply 
because Orange County is "a nice place to live," Albright explained to the 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
"The rest of the country is sending billions of dollars to (boiler rooms in) 
Southern California," said David A. Katz, a former assistant U.S. attorney who 
once headed the Southern California Fraud Task Force. "It's a disgrace for the 
rest of the country to put up with it." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. William L. Overtoom told the panel that the 
county is home to about 200 fraudulent boiler-room operations that ring up 
gross annual sales of up to $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
A federal, state and local boiler-room task force in Orange County in the last 
two years has initiated 16 prosecutions, arrested 36 people, won 14 convictions 
and has 30 investigations in progress, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, law enforcement officials estimate that at least 85% of existing 
boiler-rooms are not being investigated, Overtoom said. "The primary reason . . 
. is the lack of manpower, economic resources and effective laws," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Katz, Overtoom and other prosecutors who testified said the federal government 
should consider amending its mail and wire fraud statutes to permit authorities 
to seize, with a court order, the assets of fraudulent telemarketers. The 
concept was endorsed by Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), one of the 
subcommittee members. 
</P>
<P>
Albright and Bederson described in detail how fraudulent telemarketers ply 
their trade. 
</P>
<P>
They often begin by purchasing names of existing but dormant corporations "off 
the shelf," so they can claim their boiler room has been in existence for five 
or 10 years, without any consumer complaints. 
</P>
<P>
They told of how inexperienced salesmen called "fronters" use written pitches 
to make initial calls to potential victims, or "mooches." Those "mooches" who 
show an interest then are turned over to more experienced account closers, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Albright, who worked a coin scam, explained how another boiler-room employee 
known as a "reloader" would "find out how deep the customer's pockets were and 
ascertain how long it would take to get as much of that money as possible." 
</P>
<P>
An average reloader would handle up to 200 accounts and could expect to have a 
weekly income of more than $10,000, Albright testified. 
</P>
<P>
"We targeted the wealthy and the elderly in our fraud," Bederson said. "We 
found the elderly intent on enlarging their nest egg, their limited income, and 
often interested in generating money for their grandchildren."

HOW HOT IS IT? PLENTY, AND IT'S STEAMY, SMOGGY ALSO

Winds from a dying hurricane off the coast of Mexico pushed moisture across 
Orange County on Wednesday, sealing in the humidity with a thick cloud cover 
and leaving residents sweltering in temperatures reaching into the high 90s. 
</P>
<P>
With the mercury hitting 99 in Irvine and 98 in Anaheim, the discomfort was 
intensified by up to 35% humidity in some parts of Orange County. It was 96 in 
Santa Ana and El Toro, and forecasters say today should offer more of the same. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the Southland, the temperature peaked at 96 degrees at the Civic 
Center in Los Angeles -- one degree cooler than the record for the date set in 
1959 -- while soaring up to 104 in Ontario and 110 in some desert areas, 
according to the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
At Diamond Elementary School in Santa Ana, cranky schoolchildren studying in 
classrooms without air conditioning lined up outside restrooms to douse their 
heads in cool tap water. Lunchtime supervisors patrolled the blacktop with 
parasols, and kick-ball and basketball were definitely out. 
</P>
<P>
Some youngsters complained of headaches, stomachaches and some said they were 
having difficulty concentrating. 
</P>
<P>
"It's inhumane," said second-grade teacher Carol Flack. "And the heat goes on 
all summer, and into October." 
</P>
<P>
Late in the afternoon Wednesday, school officials decided to shorten classroom 
schedules, an nouncing that school would close 45 minutes early today and 
Friday to the relief of all concerned. 
</P>
<P>
High humidity makes the heat all the more unbearable because it limits the 
body's ability to cool itself. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not able to evaporate your perspiration as readily and heat builds up, 
so you feel hot," said Bill Hibbert, a meteorologist at WeatherData Inc., a 
firm that provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
For the moment, there is little prospect for relief. 
</P>
<P>
The hot and steamy conditions are expected to continue for at least a few more 
days. High pressure continues to dominate over the western part of the nation 
as tropical depression Fausto continues to break up in the Pacific. Several 
days ago, Fausto was packing hurricane-force winds but has been breaking up and 
has now been downgraded to a tropical depression. 
</P>
<P>
Still, forecasters say, its winds have been pushing moisture and clouds across 
the Southland, raising humidity levels to unseasonable highs. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like it's going to stay fairly hot and humid over the next week or so 
throughout the Southwest," Hibbert said. "This is probably the more unusual 
aspect of this weather pattern right now." 
</P>
<P>
Fausto's wet fringes could bring some short-lived, scattered showers to parts 
of the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
Ozone levels soared, with several monitoring stations across the Southland 
recording "unhealthful" smog levels exceeding 100 on the pollution standard 
index, officials of the South Coast Air Quality Management District reported. 
</P>
<P>
A first-stage alert was declared in the Glendora area, where the ozone reached 
205 and air was described as "very unhealthful." Similar alerts are predicted 
for today in parts of Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino counties, 
according to Sylvia Haskell, an AQMD spokeswoman. Smog forecasters had 
predicted higher ozone levels for Wednesday, but the heat served to weaken an 
inversion layer, allowing enough pollutants to escape, she added. 
</P>
<P>
Except for areas along the coast, Orange County's smog levels Wednesday were in 
the "unhealthful" range and were expected to stay there for the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters were suggesting the beach for relief, because temperatures there 
are expected to remain up to 20 degrees cooler. On Wednesday, the Newport Beach 
high was a comfortable 74 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
But unfortunately, not everyone can spend a cool day on the sand. Some, such as 
Garden Grove automobile salesman Joel Shamie, were forced to earn a living. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real hot when you get inside those cars out there," Shamie said. "The 
steering wheel is hot and you can't touch anything." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the heat had one advantage. "You know they have to be serious to be out 
here," Shamie said of the few customers who trickled into the dealership. "It's 
not just those tire kickers."

<P>
A 6-year-old boy who was pulled unconscious from the bottom of a swimming pool 
in Costa Mesa has become the seventh child to die in pools and hot tubs in 
Orange County this year, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Adam Christopher Harris of Los Angeles died at 2:15 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
He had been on a respirator since Sunday, when he was pulled from the pool in 
the 200 block of Virginia Place during a back-yard party, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics took Adam to College Hospital Costa Mesa, where he was placed on 
life support systems. He was transferred to Children's Hospital of Orange 
County in Orange but never regained consciousness, hospital officials said. 
Adam died in the intensive care unit there less than two months before his 
seventh birthday. LUCY CHABOT

</P>
<P>
The juveniles, who were not identified, had been riding in the bed of a Toyota 
Forerunner at about 9:45 p.m. Tuesday traveling southbound on Harvard Avenue 
near University Avenue when the driver, who also was a juvenile, lost control 
of the truck, Police Lt. Vic Tehies said. 
</P>

His pickup struck a Ford Thunderbird which was going east on University, then 
flipped end over end and landed on its wheels, Tehies said. When it flipped, it 
struck a Toyota Tercel waiting for a red light to change at the intersection, 
he said. Some of the four occupants of the Tercel suffered bruises and cuts, 
Tehies said.

UCI HOSPITAL OPENS PARAMEDIC AID UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Emergency calls have already begun arriving at UCI Medical Center's Paramedic 
Base Station, which opened this week as the seventh such emergency unit in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
The first call Monday came from paramedics treating an 83-year-old woman who 
had fainted. They asked via the radio system for nurse approval of drugs they 
wanted to administer and for guidance on which hospital to take the woman to. 
</P>
<P>
"These are more than your run-of-the-mill calls," said Judie Baen, coordinator 
of the 16 emergency room nurses who will take calls from paramedics responding 
to accidents or acute illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
The new unit, in the emergency area of the hospital, had received 25 calls for 
help in its first three days. 
</P>
<P>
The nurses and 10 doctors in the unit, all members of the teaching staff, have 
undergone 16 hours of ride-along time with paramedics and 48 hours of class 
time, Baen said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, they trained for 40 hours each at the other six base stations in 
the county to become accustomed to operating the radio equipment. They must 
record all calls on tape and in a log that describes the patients' symptoms and 
what drugs or actions were recommended. 
</P>
<P>
A nurse or doctor who receives a call will stay on the line with the paramedic 
until the patient has been delivered to a hospital, if that is recommended, 
Baen said. 
</P>
<P>
The equipment also can give a readout of a patient's heartbeat to give the 
medical personnel better information in treatment, Baen said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, UCI Medical Center in Orange, which had operated a base station for 
several years, told the County Board of Supervisors that it could no longer do 
so because the hospital had to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors moved the station to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps it took losing the base system five years ago to make us appreciate 
getting it back," said Dr. Kym Salness, UCI Medical Center director of 
emergency services. 
</P>
<P>
Population growth and an increase in the number of patients needing acute care 
created the need for an additional base station in the Orange area, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have realized how important this program is and how little savings was 
involved" in closing the unit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Salness said, "all the medical students will be able to observe the 
operations." He added that there is a nationwide shortage of doctors trained in 
emergency procedures. Medical schools such as UCI must be designated as 
emergency bases to train emergency personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital expects to take about 500 calls a month. MARY ANNE PEREZ

A reformed gang member denied Wednesday that he coerced his cousins into 
revealing to police the names of three defendants in a Garden Grove 
gang-related double slaying last year that involved the death of a 4-year-old 
boy. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Rodriguez of Santa Ana said he did persuade others to break the gang 
"code of silence" and tell police what they knew about the Sept. 16, 1989, 
random shooting on La Bonita Avenue. While he admitted that he personally 
suspected one of the defendants -- based on a description he was given of a 
truck the gunmen used -- Rodriguez vehemently denied defense insinuations that 
he told his cousins what to say. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday was the second day of testimony in the trial over what stands as 
Orange County's worst incident of gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
The proceedings are also unique because Judge Tully H. Seymour has ordered two 
juries to hear the case at once. One of the defendants had been granted a 
separate trial when a scheduling problem threatened to prevent his lawyer from 
having time to adequately prepare. But at the last minute, the problem was 
resolved, so Seymour devised a way to conduct the two trials simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
When the case opened Tuesday, one of the two jury panels was forced to sit in 
the back of the courtroom and had trouble hearing testimony and seeing 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, however, Seymour moved the proceedings to a larger courtroom and 
conditions improved. 
</P>
<P>
The three defendants -- Roman G. Menchaca, 19; Luis P. Valadez, 28, and Robert 
P. Figueroa, 20 -- are associated with the 5th Street Gang in Santa Ana and are 
charged with murder in the drive-by shooting deaths of Miguel (Smokey) Navarro, 
18, and Frank Fernandez Jr., 4. Six other people were wounded, including a 
2-year-old boy and a 26-year-old man whose leg was amputated as a result of 
bullet wounds suffered in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend that the defendants' motive in the shooting stemmed from a 
long rivalry with the 17th Street Gang. The shooting occurred just a block 
north of 17th Street. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez has been a central figure in the La Bonita Avenue investigation. He 
was related to many of the victims and persuaded some of them to name their 
assailants to police. 
</P>
<P>
But while Rodriguez himself is only a minor prosecution witness -- he was not 
at the scene of the shootings when they occurred -- he has become important to 
defense attorneys. Some of them theorize that eyewitnesses could not identify 
any of the people in the truck and did not report names to the police until 
Rodriguez told them to. 
</P>
<P>
"I screamed at them; it was: Knock off the code of silence. I did not tell them 
what to say," Rodriguez testified. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez has gained attention as a hero in the case because he has stepped 
forward to cooperate with the police despite threats made on his life by others 
associated with the 5th Street gang, to which he once belonged. 
</P>
<P>
But Wednesday, his personal life took something of a beating in the courtroom. 
He reluctantly admitted that he was a convicted child molester and that four 
years ago -- 10 years after he said that he had left gang life -- he was 
convicted of trying to intimidate a prosecution witness. When defense attorney 
David A. Zimmerman raised the issue, in front of the jurors, of the child 
molestation conviction, Rodriguez turned to Judge Seymour. 
</P>
<P>
"Do I have to answer that?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said he must. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Avdeef used Rodriguez's testimony in part Wednesday 
to explain to jurors a motive for the shooting. The 5th Street and 17th Street 
gangs have been at war for years, with violence on both sides, Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
Why would some of his cousins not want to break the code of silence? Avdeef 
asked him. Rodriguez's response: 
</P>
<P>
"They do not tell the police so they can avenge the crime themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said it was the death of the 4-year-old, a son of one of his cousins, 
that convinced him that the code had to be broken. 
</P>
<P>
The defense claims that it was too dark for anyone at the scene to identify the 
shooters. And the defense hit hard at police reports, claiming that the reports 
show not only that the cousins would not tell police who the assailants were, 
but that the cousins told Rodriguez, a confidante, they could not identify 
anyone. 
</P>
<P>
The trial is scheduled to resume today, when some of the eyewitnesses are 
expected to testify.

Traffic was backed up for miles Wednesday night after a tank truck jackknifed 
on the Santa Ana Freeway just north of Lake Forest Drive, the California 
Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol said the truck slammed into the back of a car, 
injuring its two occupants. The truck driver was not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
The accident forced closure of all but one lane on the northbound side of the 
freeway. 
</P>
<P>
CHP officers who arrived at the scene at 7:17 p.m. called for firefighters 
because of fears that the tanker may have contained hazardous liquid. The 
northbound rig apparently was used to carry aviation fuel, but CHP officers 
said the tanks were empty.

ACCIDENT: SANTA ANA MAN FINDS OLD-STYLE MUSKET IN TRASH. WHILE CHECKING IT OUT, 
IT FIRES, AND A 5-MONTH-OLD CHILD DIES.

<TEXT>
<P>
Jorge Luis Lizarraga was on his regular rounds as a trash collector in Newport 
Beach on Tuesday when he found what looked like an old-style musket, the kind 
soldiers used in the Revolutionary War. He wasn't even sure if it was real, 
relatives say. 
</P>
<P>
But the gun proved all too real. A few hours later, as the 24-year-old 
Lizarraga was apparently trying to clean or test the weapon, it fired, sending 
a fatal bullet into the head of his only child, 5-month-old Alexis Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
Police on Wednesday tried to sort through what they said appeared to be an 
accident. Grieving relatives did not know where to begin as they gathered at 
the Lizarragas' apartment on Chestnut Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it was the devil's work -- there's no other way to explain it," 
Alfred Ortega, a cousin, said outside the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Lizarraga and his wife, Angie, were "devastated" by the events of the previous 
night and did not want to speak with reporters, Ortega said. 
</P>
<P>
"This was their pride, a joyful child. They'd have done anything for him," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
When Lizarraga brought the musket home from work, he "thought it was a fake," 
the cousin said. "He even opened it up and looked inside (for bullets) but 
there was nothing there. He tried firing it to see if there was anything in it 
but there wasn't -- until the last time." 
</P>
<P>
Police and relatives said a single bullet struck the infant, who was in the 
arms of his mother across the room. He was flown by helicopter to UCI Medical 
Center in Orange, where he was pronounced dead about 8:15 p.m., soon after 
arrival. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives from around the area rushed to the family's apartment to help console 
mother and father upon their return from the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana police, continuing their investigation on Wednesday, said they were 
considering possible criminal charges against Lizarraga in connection with the 
death of his son. A report is to be forwarded to the district attorney's office 
for review. 
</P>
<P>
"We're suspecting there was some negligence on the part of the father, and 
we're investigating that," said police spokesman Lt. Robert Helton. "We'll have 
to see if there are any grounds for charges. 
</P>
<P>
"There's obviously nothing to indicate this was intentional, so I imagine we 
could be looking at something like manslaughter" if authorities decide to 
pursue charges in the case, Helton said. Neither he nor county prosecutors 
would comment on the likelihood of that happening. 
</P>
<P>
Helton added that the weapon was a working replica of an antique cap-and-ball 
musket. But Lizarraga may not have known that. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not even sure he realized what he had, how it operates off a flint and 
that type of thing, or even whether he knew this was a real gun in his hand or 
a toy or what," Helton said. "It's really a sad situation."

RIPPLE EFFECT OF COCHELL'S RESIGNATION REACHES CAPE COD; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASEBALL: SOME OKLAHOMA PLAYERS ON SUMMER LEAGUE TEAM NO LONGER WISH TO 
BE SOONERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The days of thunder have passed for the Cal State Fullerton baseball team, 
which was rocked last week by the resignation of Coach Larry Cochell, who went 
to the University of Oklahoma and took coveted pitching coach Vern Ruhle with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
But Jason Hutchins, a former Golden West College and Woodbridge High School 
pitcher who signed with the Titans last spring, has found himself amid another 
storm -- far away from Fullerton or Norman, Okla. -- that was spawned by 
Cochell's move. 
</P>
<P>
Hutchins is playing in the Cape Cod Summer League for the Wareham (Mass.) 
Gatemen, a team that is coached by outgoing Sooner assistant Jim Fleming and 
includes five players with Oklahoma ties -- three Sooners, one would-be Sooner 
and one was-going-to-be-a Sooner. 
</P>
<P>
But now make that two don't-want-to-be Sooners and one who isn't sure. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm right in the thick of it," Hutchins said. 
</P>
<P>
Hutchins, who went 6-3 with a 3.31 earned-run average for the Rustlers last 
season, isn't sure if he will be in the thick of Fullerton's pitching rotation 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
He said there's a "40%" chance he will honor his commitment to Fullerton, 
though the right-hander added he will wait to see who replaces Cochell and 
Ruhle before he makes his decision. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends on if I can get released from my letter of intent and if there's 
scholarship money at Oklahoma," Hutchins said. "And it also depends on who the 
new coach is. But Vern Ruhle was the reason I went to Fullerton." 
</P>
<P>
If Hutchins winds up at Oklahoma, he would be the second Titan signee to 
transfer. Villa Park High pitcher Todd Blyleven, son of Angel Bert Blyleven, 
said last week he will follow Ruhle. 
</P>
<P>
And USC sophomore Mike Smedes, a former Laguna Hills High pitcher who was 
released from his scholarship so he could go to Fullerton, may be a Sooner real 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
"If the scholarship money is there, I'll definitely go to Oklahoma," Smedes 
said. "If it's not, I'll have to talk it over with my parents." 
</P>
<P>
Tony Darden, a UCLA sophomore who was released from his scholarship so he could 
pitch for the Titans next year, also is awaiting word from Cochell on 
scholarship funds. 
</P>
<P>
Reports of these players heading East have stirred things up at Cape Cod. Of 
Hutchins' five Oklahoma-related teammates, two are veering away from the 
program and one is in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Hickey, who started at shortstop as a Sooner freshman, asked Cochell for 
his release Wednesday. Scott Watkins, a pitcher from Seminole (Okla.) Junior 
College who was leaning toward Oklahoma, signed with Oklahoma State Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Walker, a pitcher from Conners (Okla.) State Junior College who signed 
with the Sooners, said he hasn't made up his mind whether he will go to 
Oklahoma. Two more of Hutchins' teammates, pitchers Steve Dean and Bert Inman, 
will remain at Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
"They're worried that Cochell is going to bring in California guys and that 
they're going to lose their scholarships," Hutchins said. 
</P>
<P>
Cochell maintains he will not pull scholarships from present Oklahoma players 
and that if funds aren't available, transfers such as Blyleven may have to pay 
out-of-state tuition until they can secure scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
All the movement has put Hutchins in an awkward situation on his summer team. 
He is friends with the Oklahoma players, but for him to gain a scholarship, 
some Sooners will have to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been an interesting summer here," Hutchins said. "I've told the 
pitchers to stay because of Vern Ruhle, but some of them are too worried to 
even give them (new coaches) a chance." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the search for Cochell's successor has begun. Fullerton has 
advertised the position, and associate athletic director Steve DiTolla said a 
selection committee should be formed within the next two weeks. He hopes to 
have a coach by early August. 
</P>
<P>
Former Titan Coach Augie Garrido, who is now at Illinois, has expressed 
interest in returning but has not made contact with Fullerton officials. 
Riverside City College Coach Dennis Rogers, a former Titan assistant under 
Cochell, has applied, and USC assistant Bill Hughes will also apply, according 
to Trojan Coach Mike Gillespie. 
</P>
<P>
Other coaches who have shown interest in the position are Chris Smith of Loyola 
Marymount, George Horton of Cerritos, Don Sneddon of Rancho Santiago and Titan 
assistant Fred Hoover. Bill Kernan of Cal State Northridge is expected to be a 
candidate but is on vacation and couldn't be reached. 
</P>
<P>
Cochell said most of the players returning from last season's College World 
Series team, including pitchers James Popoff and Bill Fitzgerald, infielders 
Phil Nevin and Steve Sisco, catchers Matt Hattabaugh and Frank Charles and 
outfielder David Ayala will remain at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
However, three recruits -- Golden West outfielder Frank Herman, Mater Dei 
outfielder Jim Betzold and Estancia pitcher Greg Brannis -- say they won't 
finalize plans until a new coach is named.

The dress rehearsal went well, but now the Newport Beach Dukes begin for real. 
</P>
<P>
The Dukes open the Team Tennis season against the Raleigh Edge at 7:30 tonight 
at the John Wayne Tennis Club in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Making their exhibition debut Tuesday night, the Dukes were introduced to a 
crowd of about 1,200, then defeated a UC Irvine alumni team, 30-16. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't prove much of a test for the Dukes. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Briggs, a former UCI All-American now playing on the pro tour, fared best 
among the former Anteaters, but he fell, 6-5, to Roger Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Sophie Amiach and Amy Frazier formed an overpowering doubles team for the 
Dukes, and Marty Davis' experience proved too much for the UCI alumni. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the Dukes can handle Team Tennis opponents as easily remains to be 
seen. 
</P>
<P>
But Greg Patton, the Dukes' coach, liked what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like love at first sight," he said. "I'm real excited." 
</P>
<P>
Patton is still searching for the Dukes' strongest lineup. Tuesday's exhibition 
gave him a chance to experiment, and he said he plans further shuffling. 
</P>
<P>
Raleigh, another new Team Tennis franchise, is one of the league's toughest 
teams, according to Patton. 
</P>
<P>
The Edge features Tim Pawsat and Tim Wilkison, two Team Tennis veterans.

ORANGE COUNTY, CABLE FIRMS' FIGHT HEATS UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the first of what promises to be a long series of high-stakes legal 
proceedings, the Orange County assessment appeals board Wednesday heard opening 
testimony in the rancorous dispute between the county's cable television 
companies and county Tax Assessor Bradley Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy centers on radically higher property tax assessments that 
Jacobs imposed on 10 county cable-TV operators last year. The cable companies 
say the new assessments, which in some cases have increased property tax bills 
nearly 400%, are discriminatory and illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs and his deputies maintain they are simply responding to the rapid 
appreciation in the value of cable TV franchises and meeting their 
Constitutional obligation to assess all property at fair market value. 
</P>
<P>
Cable companies and county tax assessors in several other areas of the state 
are embroiled in a similar controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Until Wednesday, the dispute in Orange County had been played out largely in a 
series of newspapers advertisements, press releases and cable-TV bill inserts 
put out by the cable companies. The cable operators say the new tax assessments 
will require a $1 to $2 per month increase in basic cable rates. Several 
companies have already added the charges to consumers' bills. 
</P>
<P>
The three-person assessment appeals board, a quasi-judicial body appointed by 
the county Board of Supervisors, will ultimately decide whether to uphold or 
reduce Jacobs' assessments on individual companies. 
</P>
<P>
The board's decisions can be challenged in state court, and they often are in 
important cases. In addition, 10 cable companies have also sued the county, 
Jacobs and other officials, alleging that the new assessments violate their 
Constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's hearing, inauspiciously convened in a dilapidated Civic Center 
hearing room, involved American Television &amp; Communications Corp., a 
subsidiary of Time Warner Inc. that operates the Cablevision system in the city 
of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
ATC's property tax increase, from $122,607 in 1988 (based on an assessed value 
of $11.8 million) to $189,359 in 1989 (on a value of $18.3 million), was 
actually much less than for many of the other companies because the ATC system 
has not been sold in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 13 places a 2% cap on the amount that an assessment can be 
increased in one year unless there's a change in ownership. The ATC increase, 
however, also reflects an assessment for new construction, which is not 
shielded by Prop. 13. ATC and the other companies are also disputing 
retroactive "escape" assessments that require additional tax payments for 
1985-1988. 
</P>
<P>
In arguments that will be repeated again as the nine other firms move through 
the appeals process later this year, cable company attorney Paul Gordon said 
his client's property consists of "fairly sophisticated electronic equipment, 
several hundred miles of cables and a large number of converter boxes." He said 
the property tax assessment should be based on the replacement cost of that 
equipment, minus depreciation. 
</P>
<P>
"The assessor," Gordon maintained, "is taking the business value and saying all 
the value of our business is in the property." That methodology, he said, 
results in an assessment that is "off the chart," a property value far higher 
than any buyer would reasonably pay. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon also asserted that the assessor had decided that "we should be treated 
differently from all other businesses because we are a monopoly." Cable-TV 
companies, he argued, are not in fact monopolies. 
</P>
<P>
The assessor's representatives -- two county attorneys and three deputy 
assessors led by Ron Cooper -- declined to present an opening argument. But in 
a brief filed with the board, the assessor notes that three methods -- 
replacement cost, income and comparable sales data -- can legitimately be used 
in computing property values. 
</P>
<P>
The brief states: "The evidence in this matter will show that comparable sales 
data and income data support a fair market value much in excess of the 
replacement cost data urged by American." Because the system would be bought 
and sold as a unit, it should be valued as a unit, and not as the sum of its 
hardware, the assessor maintains. 
</P>
<P>
The assessor also contends that "because of the de facto monopoly status, this 
cable television business has virtually no income or market value which can be 
attributed to enterprise activity, good will or any other excludable 
intangible." Intangible assets are specifically exempted from property tax by 
the state Constitution.

Fluor Daniel Inc., the giant engineering and construction company, said 
Wednesday that it has been awarded two contracts in China -- one for 
engineering work at a petrochemical plant and the other for consulting work for 
two pharmaceutical factories. 
</P>
<P>
The deals are the first in China that Fluor has made public since the bloody 
political crackdown by the Chinese government in June, 1989. The firm has been 
involved in more than half a dozen business deals in China since then, but has 
not publicized them at the request of the Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Land, a spokeswoman for Irvine-based Fluor Corp., Fluor Daniel's 
parent, said the company has worked on more than 50 projects in China since it 
began doing business there in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"The awards are significant in that they will position us as an exporter in the 
bio-technical and pharmaceutical industries," Land said. 
</P>
<P>
For one of the projects announced Wednesday, Fluor will supply engineering and 
procurement services for a proposed $50-million ethylene oxide plant in 
northeast China. Fluor estimated the value of the contract with Jilin Chemical 
Industries at $24 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Jilin plant, which starts construction next year, will produce 40,000 tons 
of ethylene oxide annually when completed in 1993, said Andy Blair, project 
manager of Fluor Daniel's Canadian subsidiary, which will perform the work. The 
chemical is a derivative used for automotive brake fluid, antifreeze and 
detergent products. 
</P>
<P>
Fluor also has received a contract of undisclosed value from Beijing-based 
China National Technical Import &amp; Export Corp. to provide consulting 
services for two Chinese pharmaceutical plants planned in Shanghai and the 
eastern China city of Zibo. 
</P>
<P>
The two plants will manufacture capsules, tablets and injectable products for 
intravenous purposes, said Marshall Bautz, Fluor Daniel project manager. 
</P>
<P>
"What the Chinese want is to make drugs to (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) 
quality standard," Bautz said. "They're planning to sell them around the world, 
(but) not to the United States." 
</P>
<P>
China National is a diversified company in Beijing, with annual sales of about 
$4 billion, said Liang Wei Qiang, manager of China Technical Corp., the Fort 
Lee, N.J., unit of China National. The parent buys, sells and manufactures 
industrial parts and plants and is involved in both heavy and light industrial 
manufacturing.

Joining the ranks of other computer companies that are expanding overseas, 
Advanced Logic Research Inc. said Wednesday that it has signed an agreement for 
the distribution of its personal computers in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, ALR expects to land an agreement within two weeks for distribution 
of its products in Mexico, Marketing Manager Genny Ortegon said. 
</P>
<P>
That deal is made possible by the Mexican government's recent loosening of 
restrictions on foreign computer imports. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement announced Wednesday, a unit of Torrance-based Merisel, 
formerly Softsel/Microamerica, will distribute ALR's line of personal computers 
in West Germany, the largest consumer market in Western Europe. Merisel is also 
one of ALR's distributors in North America. 
</P>
<P>
"As ALR moves to open channels in other countries, Germany is especially 
important to us, as we perceive it to be one of the more progressive countries 
in Europe in the high-technology sector," Ortegon said. 
</P>
<P>
As the growth of the domestic computer market slows, computer companies are 
counting on overseas sales for growth. The deal with Merisel will position ALR 
for the planned transformation of Western Europe into a single market in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Merisel will also distribute ALR products in East Germany if the two countries 
eventually unite, Ortegon said. As ALR's distributor, Merisel's Softsel DNS 
Germany subsidiary will provide products, service, technical support and 
advertising in the German markets. 
</P>
<P>
About 20% of ALR's current annual revenue comes from international sales. The 
company has distribution agreements to sell its computers in the United 
Kingdom, France, Austria and Sweden, Ortegon said. The company also sells its 
products in the Far East, Canada and Latin America.

FHP SENDS STOCKHOLDERS LETTER ON MEDICATION ERROR BY NURSE

<TEXT>
<P>
FHP Inc., trying to counteract what it termed "negative publicity" over a 
medication error that led to the death of an elderly cancer patient at its 
Fountain Valley hospital, has sent letters and facsimiles to its major 
shareholders providing an explanation of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
The letter and faxes were sent Wednesday in response to "a couple of inquiries 
from local investors" who read about the incident last week in local 
newspapers, said Anna Marie Dunlap, associate vice president of the Fountain 
Valley-based health maintenance organization, who signed the letter. 
</P>
<P>
The patient's death occurred in November but was not publicly disclosed until 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt it was a good idea for other shareholders to be aware of it from the 
company as opposed to hearing about it from another source," Dunlap said. The 
letter, in fact, stated that its purpose was to lay at rest "misconceptions and 
rumors surrounding the incident." 
</P>
<P>
The four-paragraph letter was telefaxed to 97 people, including "our major 
shareholders and our key portfolio manager and analysts who follow the company 
and some press people," Dunlap said. Publicity over the incident has not 
affected FHP's stock price. 
</P>
<P>
She said letters were sent by regular mail to an additional 150 shareholders on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The letter says in part: " . . . A nurse employed by the FHP Hospital did in 
fact administer the wrong medication to a 74-year-old patient who was 
terminally ill with cancer, septic shock and congestive heart failure. The 
nurse reported her error and she was terminated from FHP's employment within a 
week. FHP also promptly reported the incident to the California State 
Department of Consumer Affairs, Board of Nurses, thus triggering an 
investigation.

HOMELESSNESS: THE ORANGE COUNTY RESCUE MISSION WORKERS CONFRONT DESPAIR ON A

<TEXT>
<P>
It's 9:30 a.m. and the shaky, cadaverous men in grime-caked clothes who live on 
the pump islands of the former Buy-Rite gas station on East 1st Street have not 
yet arisen from their filthy mattresses. 
</P>
<P>
Some, if their bodies will respond, will try to walk the few steps around the 
corner to the Orange County Rescue Mission by 11 a.m. for the free showers and 
clean clothes offered each morning. 
</P>
<P>
But if they don't make it by 11, Joe Furey must shut them out. They may not 
have bathed for many days, and their clothes may be in tatters and soiled with 
the shiny, indelible grit that comes from living on the streets, and they may 
be full of stories of fearful nights and quavering days, but the free showers 
end at 11, and those are the rules. 
</P>
<P>
Furey must do it, he says, to keep the fragile world of the mission from 
unraveling. If one person bends the rules, the word instantly spreads on the 
street and soon, Furey says, the mission's atrium would be filled with angry 
homeless people, telling even more desperate stories, demanding showers, or 
clothes, or food, or an extra night's free lodging. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll give you a nice story," said Furey, 34, an associate chaplain at the 
mission who has worked there for 1 1/2 years, "and when I first started here, I 
had the tendency to buy it and let them in. And they might have a legitimate 
story. But once you do that, make it a habit to bend the rules, it's amazing; 
in another 20 minutes, there's two guys wanting the same thing and then it's 
all chaos. You cannot let them know that you're easy." 
</P>
<P>
Too many needy people. Too much desperation. Too few beds. Not enough food and 
clothing. Not enough time. 
</P>
<P>
It was in just such a tightly strung atmosphere -- where workers walk an 
emotional tightrope between compassion and the knowledge that many lives are 
unsalvageable -- that Mitch Snyder, the nation's best-known advocate for the 
homeless, hanged himself last week in a Washington homeless shelter. A 
firebrand known for his intensity and passion for his cause, Snyder was 
characterized at the time of his death as a man who had exhausted his inner 
resources and simply had nothing left to give. 
</P>
<P>
And now, in the center of one of the wealthiest counties in the nation -- a 
social contrast that makes the hardscrabble world around the mission all the 
more shocking -- Furey and his co-workers must face down the same demons that 
haunted Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
Every day, they must descend into the gray netherworld of the helpless, the 
hopeless, the sick, the filthy, the broken, the drug-ridden, the 
alcohol-poisoned. The long, grim litany of the ignored and the forgotten. And 
each of those homeless people, in some way, has the potential to gnaw at the 
workers' emotional marrow. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be called to do it," Furey said. "Because if you're not, you'll 
burn out real quick. It'll just get to be too much, because people come in here 
and treat you like dirt. They ask for something and if they don't get it, 
they'll start calling you names. You just have to try to separate yourself from 
it and not take it personally. You have to have a real desire in your heart to 
help mankind, because the rewards just aren't there, not the financial rewards 
and not the prestige. To do this, you have to believe in something. It's 
literally a life-and-death situation." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Magluyan, administrator and head chaplain and a veteran of nearly five 
years of work at the mission, said that during his first two years there "the 
frustrations mounted and I would seek ways to get out. My temper would fly. I'd 
feel the hairs on my head rise in anger. Here you are trying to do something 
good for some fellow and he gives you a sob story and you don't know whether to 
believe it or not and you give him the benefit of the doubt and he turns around 
and he's laughing at you. It used to get my goat really, really bad." 
</P>
<P>
Today, both Furey and Magluyan say, their commitment to the work has deepened 
with their religious convictions (the mission is a Christian enterprise, funded 
solely by private donations). And both say that without those convictions, 
their jobs would quickly overwhelm them. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first started working here," Furey said, "it was a lot harder on me. 
There was the pressure of dealing with so many people and everybody's hurting. 
And there's a lot of con out there. If I were to get involved with everybody's 
problems personally and take it upon my shoulders, it would drive me nuts." 
</P>
<P>
Still, those who work with the homeless cannot help but face the unsettling 
fact that however much they do, it will not be enough, said Susan Oakson, 
coordinator of the Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
"Homelessness is an issue that is amorphous, almost impossible to get your 
hands around," Oakson said. "It's really a symptom of some very chronic 
problems in our communities, like mental disability, like lack of affordable 
housing and child care, medical care, substance abuse. Any of those things, in 
and of themselves, could be all-consuming if you spent your life's work on 
them. Taken as a whole, they're overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Zetin, associate adjunct professor of psychiatry and human behavior at UC 
Irvine, said that people who work with the homeless, particularly if their 
clients are mentally ill, must make an effort to separate themselves from those 
they serve. The workers' mental well-being "depends on their ability to keep 
some professional distance and perspective," he said. They must remind 
themselves that the homeless have a choice of "working within the system . . . 
or going out and blowing their money." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best strategy for avoiding burnout, he said, is for the workers not 
to look on themselves as saviors, but to place the primary responsibility for 
behavioral change on the homeless themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Zetin said, when workers see the homeless that surround them lapse again 
and again into destructive behavior, "they're dealing with a tremendous amount 
of frustration." 
</P>
<P>
Oakson agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be satisfied to claim very small victories," she said. "It's not 
like other jobs, where the people you turn away can get the service you provide 
somewhere else, and the situation is not life-threatening. With the people we 
deal with, it is life-threatening. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Once you've put a name and a face and a life with a homeless individual and 
had contact in trying to assist that person, the issue is never the same for 
you again. And (the workers) see that face of homelessness day in and day out." 
</P>
<P>
At 2:30 p.m., there are only a few men sitting, or slumped asleep, on the 12 
wood and ornamental iron benches located in the atrium of the mission, all 
facing the north wall where signs in English and Spanish announce the 
availability of free clothes on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
It is the mission's quiet time, between the morning crush for the showers and 
the evening line of men wanting food and beds for the night. 
</P>
<P>
It is a kind of safe haven, however temporary, from the nightmare world just 
outside the door, where drug dealers squat on curbs, addicts make buys and 
shoot up in Center Park across the street, alcoholics wracked with nausea 
stumble aimlessly and prostitutes loiter in anticipation of the evening's 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Furey, himself a recovered cocaine addict, knows them and points them out with 
the detached manner of a man who knows the routine and grudgingly accepts it as 
part of life in a dangerous neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
He is used to looking over his shoulder. He has seen bullets crunch through the 
walls of the mission, heard shotgun blasts outside in the night, seen a drunk 
die in the mission atrium, picked up used syringes in the park. He had to 
confront a man wielding a knife on his first night on the job. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been sick a lot in the last year and a half," he said, "mainly because we 
deal with so many people who have diseases. You get everything that comes in 
here. And you have to be careful because there's a lot of AIDS everywhere 
because of drug-users sharing needles." 
</P>
<P>
He remembered a night when "we had a guy break in through the front door. He 
sliced his arm because he punched through the glass and he was swinging his arm 
around. That was a scary thing, because the blood's flying and it's fresh. 
</P>
<P>
"When I used to work nights, I'd walk past the window and I'd feel like I had a 
big 'Shoot Me' sign on. As soon as you say no to people, you become their 
enemy. It's a heavy drug area and people get killed around here all the time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the law of the jungle. It's a zoo." 
</P>
<P>
The solution, Magluyan said, is only partial, but it involves a single, 
inflexible rule: "Your No. 1 responsibility here is to uphold the rules of the 
mission. You have to be involved and yet detached. You've got to set 
responsibilities. I've got mine and I'll do everything I can do, but if you're 
not willing to meet me halfway, we can't go anywhere. If they don't make it 
because they're not carrying their part of the load, there's nothing I can do 
for them." 
</P>
<P>
At 5 p.m., Ritchie Hartsock, 37, a live-in staff member manning the mission's 
desk, begins calling out the names of men who have put in for a bed for the 
night. The mission's doors have just closed for the evening and the atrium is 
full of men sitting on the benches and the floor. The rule: Be inside before 
the doors close (or call to let the staff know precisely when you'll arrive) or 
spend the night on the street. 
</P>
<P>
Hartsock calls the names of two men who have shown identification and signed 
in, but who do not respond when the names on the ID cards are called. He says 
he suspects they are underage and are using false IDs. He finally ferrets them 
out and tells them to leave. He holds the door and watches them walk out. 
</P>
<P>
Those are the rules, he says without apology, and following them to the letter 
is one way of maintaining equilibrium in his job. 
</P>
<P>
But it is hard, he says, to see people slip away. 
</P>
<P>
"My biggest frustration," he said, "is when you get to know somebody and see 
them get back into the alcohol or the drugs and they're all strung out and they 
look like they've been rolling around in a mud puddle somewhere and you just 
really want to reach out to them but you don't know how." 
</P>
<P>
Said Kurt Lewis, 27, another live-in staffer: "You see the same people every 
day, and they tell you they're trying, they're trying, they're trying. Then you 
see them down drinking on the corner. They're trying to make it until the next 
bottle shows up. They're burned out on life and they can't handle it any more." 
</P>
<P>
But despite all this, Lewis says, "I think we're winning. I think we're helping 
a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
How long can they keep working at the mission? None of the workers knows. 
Burnout, they say, could come at any time. The problem is immense, the 
resources are few and the rewards are often intangible, infrequent and small. 
</P>
<P>
"Today," Furey said, "I just didn't even want to come in. You get beat. It just 
takes a lot out of you. You can't take it home with you. If you become one with 
it, like Mitch (Snyder) did, it's destructive. It becomes hopeless after a 
while, because everyone you see needs help and is in trouble. And if you think 
you can save everybody, you're in fantasyland. It doesn't work that way."

HOW TO JOIN A TRADE CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you own a business (or are yourself incorporated), bartering could offer 
cash savings for you or your company. For more than 20 years, bartering 
networks have offered the goods and services of doctors, carpenters, 
restaurants, graphic artists, print shops, interior decorators and new-car 
dealerships, to name just a few. 
</P>
<P>
In the bartering system, members use trade dollars instead of 
</P>
<P>
federal currency. For example, if a restaurateur needs work done on a car, he 
would select a mechanic and the two would negotiate the mechanic's labor and 
parts costs. The mechanic would in turn receive an equivalent credit for meals 
at the restaurant. The parties to the deal do their own negotiating, in some 
instances with the club monitoring to make sure one side does not get cheated. 
</P>
<P>
Barterers are not limited to making a direct one-to-one exchange. A major 
function of a club is to maintain a "credit market," where goods and services 
are offered to the larger group. This facilitates more trades, particularly of 
those goods that are not easily matched. Plus, some companies have begun to use 
gift certificates from trade clubs to provide bonuses for their employees. 
</P>
<P>
Benefits of joining a trade exchange include club-sponsored social gatherings 
and business expos among members to encourage a sense of camaraderie and 
introduce businesses and products to each other. Trade clubs also co-produce 
shows -- for example, home and garden, computers and interior design. Members 
buy booths on trade, but non-member attendees represent cash sales and, of 
course, potential trade club members. 
</P>
<P>
Most clubs provide varied "products" to members, working to maintain an even 
ratio between goods and services. Trade brokers help members find products 
through a membership bank and will also match buyers with sellers, helping to 
move items that have been part of previous bartering deals. Any high-demand 
service or product missing from the membership roster is sought out by the 
club's sales department, which then approaches companies offering this product 
line. On the other hand, the club will monitor the goods and services being 
offered so no single "product" is overrepresented. 
</P>
<P>
To join a trade club: 
</P>
<P>
* An individual must own a business with an address (corporations may also 
join). 
</P>
<P>
* The business must be licensed, bonded or insured. 
</P>
<P>
* A person must pay an initiation fee, which gives access to the system 
(including "shopping" at barter showrooms).

FORMER FAIRFAX STAR FINDS HE STILL HAS TOUCH; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: CHRIS MILLS, WHO SAT OUT A SEASON AFTER PLAYING AS A FRESHMAN AT 
KENTUCKY, IS PREPARING TO PLAY FOR U.S. NATIONAL TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As much as he might like to think otherwise, Chris Mills is not just another 
member of the United States national basketball team. The former Fairfax High 
standout and two-time Times Westside Player of the Year is the only player on 
the squad who did not play collegiately last year. 
</P>
<P>
By NCAA regulations, Mills sat out the 1989-90 season at Arizona after 
transferring from Kentucky. Mills would prefer that people forget the 
circumstances that prompted him to leave. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA said that in April, 1988, a Kentucky assistant coach violated rules by 
sending an overnight mail envelope containing $1,000 to Mills' father. Although 
Mills was not named in the investigation that placed Kentucky on probation, the 
NCAA prohibited him from playing for the school again. 
</P>
<P>
Coming off a freshman season in which he averaged 14.3 points and 8.7 rebounds 
a game and with three years of eligibility remaining, Mills was a valuable 
commodity. He strongly considered transferring to UCLA before finally settling 
on Arizona as his new school. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty close," Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
But Arizona and its team chemistry won out. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked it a lot, and I knew I would blend in better," Mills said. "At 
Arizona, it's not like you have one guy as a superstar and everything comes 
after him. Everybody plays a role and wants to win." 
</P>
<P>
Mills wanted to play immediately after transferring, but the NCAA unexpectedly 
decided he would have to wait a year, like any other transfer, because he had 
not appealed his ineligibility at Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
He practiced with the team, but when game time rolled around, he was reduced to 
the role of spectator. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really tough at first," Mills said. "But I knew there was nothing I 
could do, and I got used to it." 
</P>
<P>
With the time saved by not making road trips, Mills could devote more attention 
to his studies, resulting in his best year academically. He stayed sharp on the 
court as well, and when he was invited to the national team's trials in 
mid-May, it didn't take long for him to return to top form. 
</P>
<P>
"I took some time to get used to it (the competition), but by the second day I 
felt like I was fitting in," Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
Mills' better-than-expected play impressed Duke University's Mike Krzyzewski, 
who is head coach of the national team. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been a surprise," Krzyzewski said. "He's gotten better as the whole 
process has moved along. It's evident that he's a fine player." 
</P>
<P>
Mills is among 16 players on the team. One more player will be cut to trim the 
roster to its final size before it begins competition in the Goodwill Games in 
Seattle on July 23. 
</P>
<P>
The Mills has one outstanding asset that makes him likely to be among the final 
15. 
</P>
<P>
"His versatility," Krzyzewski said. "He can play a number of different 
positions. He's a very well-rounded basketball player." 
</P>
<P>
Mills won't have to worry about scoring. With a team that's stocked with the 
likes of Georgia Tech's Kenny Anderson, Georgetown's Alonzo Mourning, 
Syracuse's Billy Owens and Arkansas' Todd Day, the U.S. should have no problem 
scoring. Mills said his biggest contributions will come on defense. 
</P>
<P>
"Defensively, I'll need to help a lot," Mills said. "The scoring will come. 
However, defense we need to work on." 
</P>
<P>
When he begins his first season at Arizona, Mills expects to be playing at 
small forward and to fulfill different obligations than his role on the 
national team. 
</P>
<P>
"They're going to look for me to score a lot," Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
At Kentucky, he played at every position except center. He even endured the 
nerve-rattling experience of starting at point guard against Duke in a 
nationally televised game in his collegiate debut. 
</P>
<P>
Mills remembers holding his own in that game, and Krzyzewski had good things to 
say about his performance as well. Nevertheless, didn't the 6-foot-6 Mills seem 
a bit out of place playing point guard? 
</P>
<P>
"He never looks out of place on a basketball court," Krzyzewski said. 
</P>
<P>
Mills said he might also see action at shooting guard at Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
No matter what capacity he's used in, Mills will be happy to be playing again, 
and perhaps by being a regular member of the team he can end the talk of his 
past. 
</P>
<P>
"I would think that would happen," Mills said. "I had a year off, and it kind 
of died down, but now that I'm playing again it's starting over." 
</P>
<P>
Mills frequently talks of "blending in." With the Goodwill Games ahead and the 
first of what should be three productive seasons at Arizona, it appears he 
might have finally found the right mix.

A woman who operated a licensed day-care center at her Reseda home was released 
from jail on bail this morning after being arrested when Los Angeles police 
found an eight-foot marijuana plant growing in her back yard, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Kim McIntyre, 28, was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of cultivating marijuana, a 
felony, and was released from the Van Nuys jail this morning in lieu of $5,000 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
Police searched her home in the 19500 block of Vanowen Street after receiving a 
tip about the marijuana plant. Lt. Gary Rogness said investigators found two 
plants -- one eight feet tall with a branch span of five feet -- a small amount 
of marijuana inside the house and a loaded rifle that was not properly secured 
from the children. 
</P>
<P>
Rogness said eight children under McIntyre's care were at the home when 
officers searched it. He said McIntyre told detectives that she was growing the 
marijuana to save money for her pot-smoking boyfriend. Police were looking for 
the boyfriend for questioning. McIntyre denied smoking the drug, but told 
investigators she had put it in homemade brownies and cookies. 
</P>
<P>
There was no indication that McIntyre gave marijuana-laced brownies or cookies 
to children in her care, Rogness said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they may seek child endangerment charges against McIntyre and her 
arrest has been referred to the state Department of Social Services, which 
licenses day-care centers.

THATCHER BRAVES A FUROR AFTER AIDE BLASTS GERMANS; 
</P>
<P>
OPPOSITION DEMANDS RIDLEY BE FIRED FOR LIKENING EC TO HITLER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher fought off a storm of protest in Parliament 
today after refusing to fire one of her closest senior Cabinet aides for 
likening the European Community to Adolf Hitler, calling French economic 
leaders "poodles" and labeling Germany's recent monetary union "a German racket 
designed to take over the whole of Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Shouting "Sack him! Sack him!," members of the opposition Labor Party charged 
that the comments made by Nicholas Ridley, Britain's secretary of state for 
trade and industry, had damaged Britain's image in the European Community, and 
they argued that Thatcher's failure to fire him would imply that "his views are 
her views." 
</P>
<P>
In defending her decision to retain Ridley, 61, Thatcher cited his public 
apology for his statements, which appeared in the current issue of the 
Spectator magazine, released here this morning. 
</P>
<P>
"On reflection," Ridley declared in a one-line statement issued from Budapest, 
where he is attending a series of trade meetings, "I very much regret remarks 
reported in the Spectator and unreservedly withdraw them." 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher, straining to be heard through the torrent of angry shouts and jeers, 
added in the House of Commons, "I have always understood that it is the custom 
of this House . . . that such a withdrawal is gracefully accepted." 
</P>
<P>
In the Spectator interview, Ridley is quoted as blasting the European Community 
as "17 unelected reject politicians . . . with no accountability to anybody." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not against giving up sovereignty in principle, but not to this lot. You 
might just as well give it to Adolf Hitler, frankly. 
</P>
<P>
"This rushed takeover by the Germans on the worst possible basis, with the 
French behaving like poodles to the Germans, is absolutely intolerable," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Spectator Editor Dominic Lawson, who conducted the tape-recorded interview at 
Ridley's 18th-Century home in Gloucestershire, noted within the interview 
Ridley's incessant, angry references to the Germans and then asked the 
minister, "But surely Herr (Helmut) Kohl is preferable to Herr Hitler. He's not 
going to bomb us, at least." 
</P>
<P>
To which, Ridley replied, "I'm not sure I wouldn't rather have the (bomb) 
shelters and the chance to fight back, than simply being taken over by 
economics. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll (Kohl) soon be coming here and trying to say this is what we should do 
on the banking front, and this is what our taxes should be," Ridley said. "I 
mean, he'll soon be trying to take over everything." 
</P>
<P>
The magazine's cover carried a cartoon of Ridley painting a Hitler mustache on 
a portrait of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The article's title was 
"Saying the Unsayable About the Germans." 
</P>
<P>
Lutz Stavenhagen, a senior aide to Kohl, said, "This is an unusual and 
unprecedented event. The attacks against Federal Chancellor Dr. Helmut Kohl are 
scandalous." 
</P>
<P>
Sources within both the Labor and Conservative Parties said Thatcher's decision 
to retain Ridley, who is among the last of her original ministers still in the 
Cabinet, indicates a deep split within the prime minister's inner circle over 
the issue of future European unification.

Agricultural officials announced today that entomologists have confirmed the 
discovery of a mated female Medfly in Glassell Park, virtually assuring a new 
round of malathion spraying for the area. 
</P>
<P>
Medfly Project officials said scientists late Wednesday were able to definitely 
identify the fly found in Glassell Park as a mated female. 
</P>
<P>
The fly was discovered Tuesday in a nectarine tree on Avenue 35 in an area that 
was sprayed at least six times during the state's eradication campaign and was 
last doused with the controversial pesticide May 12, said Larry Cooper, a 
Medfly Project spokesman.

<P>
Political maverick Boris N. Yeltsin, who has made a name for himself by taking 
on the Soviet Establishment and bucking convention, stunned the Soviet 
political world 
</P>
<P>
again today by announcing his resignation from the Communist Party. A left-wing 
faction with about 100 members followed suit shortly afterward. 
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev saw the leading liberals leave only hours after 
he had outflanked the right wing, defeating a bid by prominent hard-liner Yegor 
Ligachev to seize the key post of party deputy leader. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, in a bombshell declaration to the party's 28th Congress, said he was 
quitting to devote himself to his role as president of the Russian Federation, 
the country's most powerful republic. 
</P>
<P>
"I am announcing my resignation from the CPSU (Communist Party of the Soviet 
Union). In view of my . . . great responsibility toward the people of Russia 
and in connection with moves toward a multiparty state, I cannot fulfill only 
the instructions of the CPSU," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"As the highest elected figure in the republic, I have to bow to the will of 
the people," the 59-year-old Yeltsin said. 
</P>
<P>
His remarks were aimed obliquely at Gorbachev, who earlier this year was 
elected to a five-year term to a newly strengthened national presidency. 
Gorbachev has been criticized for retaining the top state and party jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Little more than an hour later, a leader of the radical Democratic Platform 
faction announced his group was pulling out to form a new independent political 
party. 
</P>
<P>
Vyacheslav Shostakovsky told the congress: "I am authorized to declare the 
division of the party and our intention to form an independent party." 
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to all democratic forces to rally for a special congress in 
the fall, saying: "We call all democratic parties to a congress in autumn, 
1990, to create a broad political coalition. 
</P>
<P>
"I and my colleagues from Democratic Platform were going to this congress with 
a hope that it would become a factor of resolute change towards democratic 
renovation of our party. 
</P>
<P>
"Regrettably, our hopes did not materialize. The congress did not meet the 
hopes of the people for the division of party and state posts." 
</P>
<P>
The two dramatic developments came as the 10-day-old congress was considering 
nominations to the party's policy-setting Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
When the session stopped for a break, delegates massed around individual 
Democratic Platform members, pressing them for an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"You are traitors!" one delegate exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
The 100 or so delegates from the reformist Democratic Platform had said they 
planned to leave the party during the congress, but until Yeltsin's 
announcement they had refrained so they could join the debate on the status of 
the party's assets. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first split in the party since 1903, when the Menshevik faction 
broke from the Bolsheviks, who went on to lead the 1917 revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Some congress delegates predicted that the departure of Yeltsin, who enjoys 
enormous popularity in Russia, could lead thousands of like-minded radicals 
among the party's rank-and-file to follow him. 
</P>
<P>
Many are furious over the party's failure to abandon structures that served it 
through more than 70 years of dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike Democratic Platform, Yeltsin did not criticize the party or pledge 
to found another. His brief statement merely stressed that he saw party 
membership as incompatible with his role as Russian president. 
</P>
<P>
His announcement, capping two years of rebellion since Gorbachev expelled him 
from the ruling Politburo for his radical views, was greeted at first by 
shocked silence. 
</P>
<P>
Several military delegates shook their heads, then scattered applause followed 
interspersed with cries of "Shame!" 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, a white-haired former construction engineer who joined the party 29 
years ago, showed no emotion and marched out of the hall in the Kremlin's 
Palace of Congresses. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, reelected as party leader Tuesday and a frequent object of Yeltsin's 
criticism, sat impassively during the statement. He then commented with a wry 
smile: "That ends the process logically." 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, a career Communist official, was brought to Moscow by Gorbachev to 
become party chief of the city and a member of the national ruling Politburo. 
But Yeltsin's populist style, demands for faster and more radical economic 
reforms, and more local power for the republics and cities caused a dispute 
with Gorbachev that led to his ouster from the job in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
However, his popularity allowed Yeltsin to make a comeback. He won a seat in 
the Congress of People's Deputies in 1988, a seat in the Russian republic 
parliament last year and the republic's presidency this summer. 
</P>
<P>
At the current congress, Gorbachev has been the object of searing criticism 
from orthodox Communists angered by his reforms, which have stripped the party 
of power in favor of the government. 
</P>
<P>
But the hard-liners nevertheless rallied behind his candidacy, concluding that 
only he can guarantee the party's continued influence.

DRAGNET FOR N.Y. ZODIAC KILLER FAILS TO FLUSH OUT GUNMAN

An elaborate police dragnet fanned out across the city from midnight to dawn 
today in vain as the Zodiac killer who targets his victims by their 
astrological signs did not strike. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of plainclothes officers were forced to extend their 4 
p.m.-to-midnight shifts Wednesday by six hours. 
</P>
<P>
Uniformed officers assigned to Operation Watchdog questioned at least one 
suspect but failed to flush out the gunman and called off their search at 6 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy didn't strike," said Sgt. Diane Kubler, a police spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
The astrology-obsessed gunman, who has struck only in the pre-dawn hours on 
Thursdays at 21-day intervals, has shot four men at close range since March 8, 
killing one. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators from the special 50-detective Zodiac Task Force questioned one 
suspect who resembled a police sketch of a man believed to be the killer. After 
releasing the man, police gave him a letter certifying that he had been 
questioned and he was "not the Zodiac."

A hailstorm pelted the Denver area, shattering windows, stripping leaves from 
trees and bruising about four dozen amusement park patrons stranded on rides by 
a power failure, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
The University of Denver reported about 750 windows broken, mostly on the north 
sides of buildings, the direction from which the storm came. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron and Sarah Creer were riding a Ferris wheel at Elitch's Gardens amusement 
park in northwest Denver when the hailstorm hit Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just praying," said Aaron, 15. He said he wrapped his arms around his 
sister, 9, to protect her head and her glasses from the pounding ice. 
</P>
<P>
Patrons at the amusement park received mostly bumps, bruises, welts and cuts. 
Forty-seven of those injured were taken to hospitals but most were treated and 
released.

The Internal Revenue Service was demanding $90,251 from homeless advocate Mitch 
Snyder at the time of his suicide last week, his longtime companion said today. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder received a June 17 preliminary notice from the IRS in which the 
government sought about $50,000 in back taxes from Snyder, plus $40,000 in 
penalties to cover $150,000 he received in 1985 and 1986 from the producers of 
the television movie "Samaritan," who purchased the rights to his life story, 
Carol Fennelly said. 
</P>
<P>
"We had just gotten the bill," Fennelly said. "They have been investigating us 
for two years and we had been waiting for a decision." 
</P>
<P>
Fennelly said Snyder had planned to turn the demand into a public issue and 
complain about national priorities.

Adolf Hitler and Hermann Goering will lose their honorary citizenship of 
Potsdam if a City Hall proposal is approved next month, the East German news 
agency ADN reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Nazi dictator and his air force chief were awarded the honor in 1933, but 
it was never revoked because of a 57-year administrative mess and the ousted 
Communist leadership's fear of causing a public scandal, ADN said. 
</P>
<P>
Records showed that officials assumed shortly after World War II that the issue 
had been settled under decrees issued by the Soviet military administrators of 
what is now East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
However, those Red Army decrees on "de-Nazification" made no specific mention 
of the honorary citizenships, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
"When the problem finally came to light in the City Council in 1988, the matter 
was quietly relegated to the archives," ADN said.

The nation's last known hand-crank party line was disconnected today when 
residents of central Idaho's rugged Salmon River canyon received private-line, 
touch-tone service. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sure nice," country store owner Garry Pedrow said in answering the first 
incoming call. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not screaming anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Public Utilities Commission President Joe Miller made the first call out from 
Pedrow's store to Gary C. Byrne, administrator of the Rural Electrification 
Administration, which financed the switch. 
</P>
<P>
The Depression-era system had grown familiar, and Pedrow and his 17 neighbors 
greeted the change with mixed emotions. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to see the historical value of it leave, but as far as being in 
business it's hard to communicate on this line!" Pedrow yelled into the 
mouthpiece before the change Wednesday.

SUGAR, DAIRY PROGRAMS CALLED 'MOST VULNERABLE' TO REFORMS

The U.S. sugar and dairy programs may be "our two most vulnerable" programs for 
reform if world trade talks are successful, Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. 
Yeutter said today. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview on National Public Radio, Yeutter said the just-concluded 
Houston economic summit marked the first time the European Community has agreed 
to negotiate possible reductions in export subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
"Sugar and dairy products are probably our two most vulnerable" programs, 
Yeutter said, because the U.S. farm program contains many protections for them. 
In both commodities, the government guarantees a minimum price and restricts 
imports. 
</P>
<P>
Yeutter reiterated the U.S. position that nations are free to maintain a social 
safety net for farmers as long as the system does not distort trade. U.S. 
officials have said activities such as disaster aid, conservation, nutrition, 
research and information distribution should be exempt from reform.

CONTEL REPORTS $6-BILLION GTE TAKEOVER OFFER

<P>
Contel Corp., a diversified regional telephone company, said today that it has 
received a takeover offer from GTE Corp. in a stock swap worth $6 billion, 
extending a recent spate of takeovers in the telecommunications industry while 
mergers elsewhere have ground to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
The deal, which would be one of the largest ever in the telecommunications 
industry, proposes that Contel stockholders receive 1.27 GTE shares for each 
Contel share. 
</P>
<P>
Contel has about 158 million shares outstanding. At this morning's price, that 
would be about $37.75 a share. GTE was trading at $29.75, down $1.25 from 
Wednesday's close. 
</P>
<P>
Contel, a company with more than $3 billion in annual revenues, provides a wide 
range of telecommunications products and services. Recently, it bought 
$1.3-billion worth of cellular telephone properties from McCaw Communications. 
</P>
<P>
GTE, based in Stamford, Conn., is one of the world's largest telecommunications 
companies, with more than $20 billion in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
Contel, shaped by entrepreneur Charles Wohlsetter, its chairman, was built from 
a sleepy regional telephone company into a leading diversified communications 
concern with local telephone units in 30 states. The purchase of the McCaw 
units in three Southern states also made it a major player in the emerging 
cellular telephone market. 
</P>
<P>
For GTE, the acquisition of Contel will expand its domestic telephone company 
base. The merger will also greatly expand its cellular business, which has been 
a key focus of its growth strategy. It had been downplaying its role in the 
domestic long-distance telephone market by selling much of its Sprint business. 
</P>
<P>
A GTE/Contel hookup is likely to catch the attention of regulators, who will 
examine its effect on the local telephone industry. 
</P>
<P>
Contel, the 10th-largest telephone company, has 2.4 million telephone customers 
in 30 states, while GTE operates in 31 states.

ALA. RADIO HOST SUSPENDED FOR BANNING BLACK CALLERS

A radio station today suspended a talk-show host who banned black listeners 
from speaking on his show because a station employee's car was broken into and 
her purse stolen, allegedly by a black man. 
</P>
<P>
Berkley Fraser, manager of WERC-AM, went on the air with an apology and said 
Tim Lennox was being suspended indefinitely after this afternoon's show to give 
the station time to review the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"We encourage free expression with live programming, and unfortunately mistakes 
do occur," Fraser said. 
</P>
<P>
Callers to "The Tim Lennox Show" on Wednesday were asked their race before 
being allowed to talk on the air, Lennox said. He said he took the action after 
he described the theft to listeners and reported that a black man was a 
suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Callers talked about their experiences as victims of crime and how to avoid 
becoming a victim, but nearly half were critical of Lennox for banning blacks, 
the Birmingham Post-Herald reported. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Abraham Woods, president of the Birmingham chapter of the Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference, said he would demand an apology from Lennox. 
</P>
<P>
"That was uncalled-for action on his part," Woods said. "It really bordered on 
stupidity in this day and time." 
</P>
<P>
Lennox said he could not explain his action. 
</P>
<P>
"On the spur of the moment, I said, 'Let's not take calls from any blacks,' " 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was interesting, the reaction to it," said Lennox, who has worked in radio 
for 15 years. "I had my boss sticking his head in the door. . . . If nothing 
else, it says something about the racial sensitivity."

Nine college students with toy guns who were making an amateur cops-and-robbers 
film got a scary dose of reality when armed officers came to the set and told 
them to drop their weapons, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
"We received a report that there were some subjects loading automatic weapons 
onto a boat on a dock," said Lt. Brad Williams of the Florida Marine Patrol 
about Wednesday's incident. 
</P>
<P>
Two FMP officers went to the scene, followed by city police. They ordered the 
students to drop their weapons and lie spread-eagled on the ground, then they 
frisked them. 
</P>
<P>
"I was shaking in my boots. It was wild," said Kenny Harris, 19, a student at 
Florida State University. He recalled at least one officer telling the young 
men not to make any false moves. 
</P>
<P>
Harris and the other eight sophomores explained to the law enforcement officers 
that they were using a 21-foot sailboat to film a movie called "Florida Force" 
as a summer project. They were videotaping the opening scene at the Ft. Walton 
Beach marina and had set off firecrackers to simulate gunfire. That apparently 
prompted someone to call authorities. 
</P>
<P>
All nine were released after a stern lecture.

If Madonna could trade places with someone, living or dead, who would it be? 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Monroe? Nah. "She'd probably have an exercise video," the sultry 
singer-actress said. 
</P>
<P>
John F. Kennedy Jr.? Nope. But she'd like to be stranded with him if they were 
the only two people left on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
Forget it. You'll never guess. Try Malcolm X. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Madonna first chose the late Frida Kahlo to trade places with, but 
remembered that the painter was in a streetcar accident and was in a lot of 
pain. So the assassinated black Muslim leader was her next choice. 
</P>
<P>
Madonna answered these and other questions submitted by readers of the teen 
magazine YM. Her answers are in the August issue, which hit newsstands 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Other gems: The best present she ever received was "a handful of sweaty 
diamonds and emeralds." She didn't say from whom. 
</P>
<P>
If she had only two days to live she'd spend them "eating potato chips, 
watching 'The Little Rascals.' " 
</P>
<P>
And if Madonna could change herself in any way, what would she change? 
</P>
<P>
"Just my hairdresser," she says.

SIMON'S 'RUMORS': GROPING FOR TRUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Neil Simon's "Rumors," at the Doolittle Theatre, is a symphony of squirming. 
</P>
<P>
Its characters spend most of the evening wiggling this way, groping that way, 
improvising tall tales, doing whatever it takes to cover up what happened to 
their good friend Charlie. 
</P>
<P>
Not that they really know what happened to Charlie. Their behavior is based on 
rumors and assumptions; Charlie himself is too sedated to be coherent. This, 
and the fact that these are supposedly sophisticated and powerful people, make 
their frantic prevarications all the funnier. And all the less likely. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview in the program, Simon spoke of the importance of establishing 
how much trouble everyone is in from the very first line. He certainly has the 
right actress, Kandis Chappell, to open his play at the Doolittle. With her 
skinny limbs sticking out of her bubble dress, her trembling countenance and 
her lunges for her forbidden cigarettes, Chappell is reminiscent of a 
particularly anxious hen. She's hilarious. 
</P>
<P>
Chappell's Chris and her husband, Ken (Gibby Brand), have arrived at the 10th 
anniversary dinner party of their friends Charlie and Myra, only to find Myra 
and the household help missing, the dinner uncooked, and Charlie upstairs with 
a superficial gunshot wound in his ear lobe. The other guests are about to 
arrive. 
</P>
<P>
Chris and Ken -- who are both attorneys -- assume Charlie tried to kill 
himself. They regard this as a criminal offense that must be hushed up -- to 
protect themselves as well as Charlie, who is a deputy mayor of New York. 
</P>
<P>
If you have no trouble believing they would react this way, you'll sail into 
the second part of the play with no sweat. It's the characters who sweat -- the 
guests start bumping into each other's accounts of what happened. The spectacle 
of all this deception obscures the shakiness of the initial premise, at least 
for a while. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Leibman leads the parade of the put-upon guests and delivers one of his 
patented super-manic performances. Jessica Walter plays his wife with an 
exasperated, socially upward New York accent and a flair for the catty remark. 
</P>
<P>
We never learn the truth of most of the rumors mentioned in the script, 
especially those of the who's-sleeping-where variety. While too much 
truth-telling would drag down most farces, this one could use a greater sense 
that some of these stories might be true. All that squirming would seem more 
purposeful, more pungent. 
</P>
<P>
A complete review runs in Friday's Calendar section.

It's not clear yet if Washington Mayor Marion Barry does or does not have a 
book or movie contract, but novelist Ishmael Reed seems to be the first one out 
with a satirical play based on the mayor's arrest and trial. 
</P>
<P>
Reed, acclaimed author, poet, critic and essayist who calls his writing style 
"neo-hoodooism," has titled his play of Barry's arrest "Savage Wilds, Part II." 
</P>
<P>
It is to be performed at the BMT theater in Emeryville, Calif., next month. 
Reed, who has taught for a number of years at UC Berkeley, will read from his 
play at the Smithsonian on Aug. 21. 
</P>
<P>
Author of such novels as "Yellow Back Radio Broke-Down" and "Mumbo Jumbo," Reed 
said that "using fiction, I'm able to raise questions about the Barry case." 
"Savage Wilds" is a broadly drawn assault on the prosecution of Barry, which 
Reed believes is a "case of a black man being scapegoated. I think when people 
have the sense to settle down and look back at this, the government will look 
worse."

LIZ SMITH: BROOKE BUBBLING OVER ON 'BACKSTREET DREAMS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By COL LIZ SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BROOKE SHIELDS is back! The former child star, pre- and post-pubescent pin-up, 
great beauty and Princeton graduate is all grown up and ready to tackle her 
career with new maturity and enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
Brooke called our office the other day bubbling over with news about her 
upcoming film "Backstreet Dreams," an ambitious, modestly budgeted feature that 
will be released in late summer from Vidmark. In this, Brooke plays a 
psychologist treating an autistic child. The star describes her role here as 
"my first truly adult portrayal." The 25-year-old actress says, "I'm a young 
woman, on her own, making her own choices. There are no parents or parent 
substitutes. I'm different from what I've been previously on screen -- and of 
course I look older." (Brooke laughs and says that since she's been acting all 
her life, people assume she's much older than she is. "Usually they come up, 
stare at me and go away saying, 'Doesn't she look great for 35!' ") 
</P>
<P>
Brooke was drawn to the role through her own study of autism at the Eden 
Institute in Princeton, N.J. "It's the inexplicable nature of this condition 
that fascinated me. As soon as I read the script, I knew I had to do this." 
Brooke has her own production group, Brooke Shields &amp; Co. and she was a 
full partner on "Backstreet Dreams," which gave her the opportunity to become 
involved with other aspects of the film -- "and also it made me realize how 
little control most actors have over their own performances or the ultimate 
outcome of a movie." 
</P>
<P>
Brooke is currently negotiating to make three movies back to back -- and she 
hasn't given up hope that her "Brenda Starr" will be released sometime soon. "I 
love this picture so much. I want people to see it! I just saw 'Dick Tracy' and 
there were a lot of similarities, I mean, the comic strip aspects of it. I was 
as much Brenda Starr as anyone could be. I certainly want it to have a chance 
with the public." 
</P>
<P>
NOW, REMEMBER Brooke's "Blue Lagoon" boyfriend, Christopher Atkins? For a hot 
minute, Atkins seemed on the brink of a big movie career. However, his 
post-"Lagoon" films ("The Pirate Movie," "A Night In Heaven") and even his 
guest-starring stint on TV's "Dallas," as the young love of perennially 
overwrought Linda Gray, served chiefly as a showcase for his athletic physique. 
</P>
<P>
Now a more mature Christopher, married with children, will have a spate of new 
movies in the coming year. Two are already in the can, "Shakma" and "Fatal 
Charm" to be released in the fall. And next month in Orlando, Fla., Chris 
begins work on "Fire, Ice and My Wife" an offbeat look at relationships in the 
'90s.

<P>
The athletic departments at Oregon and Oregon State are saddled with debt, 
leading some critics to suggest the two schools might be better off financially 
if they left the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
The accumulated debt is about $2.7 million at Oregon State and $1.4 million at 
Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes no sense at all for us to drop down a conference," Brand said. "Our 
shared revenues from being a member of the Pac-10 amount to between $1 1/2 
million and $2 1/2 million per year. In addition, our stadium, which is near 
capacity, would not be as filled if we played only the Idaho States of the 
world."

Unable to line up financing without a professional baseball or football team, 
Gregg Lukenbill will ask Sacramento residents in a televised appeal tonight to 
kick in up to $30 million to help build a stadium. 
</P>
<P>
By paying a one-time fee ranging from $250 to $1,250 per seat, fans would 
reserve tickets if a professional baseball or football team moves to 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
The reservation fees, refunded only if the $120-million stadium isn't 
completed, would be on top of ticket prices. 
</P>
<P>
"We're calling a spade a spade," said Lukenbill, who makes his pitch in a 
26-minute Sacramento Sports Assn. video scheduled for about 8:30 p.m. on a 
local television station after tonight's San Francisco Giants game. 
</P>
<P>
"If we get solid community support behind a stadium at the moment that 
major-league baseball and football are considering expanding, it will make a 
very material difference in our ability to attract either an expansion team or 
an existing team. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't get that support, I think we'll really be hurt. But you really 
need the stadium to be able to make a lightning strike deal if one comes 
along."

<P>
Steffi Graf, the top-ranked women's player in the world, is expected to be out 
of competitive tennis for up to a month after an operation on her sinuses. 
</P>
<P>
The West German, beaten by American Zina Garrison in the Wimbledon semifinals 
last week, left a hospital in Heidelberg, West Germany, Wednesday after the 
surgery, Graf's medical advisers said today. 
</P>
<P>
Graf said at Wimbledon she planned the operation at the end of the year. But 
she was persuaded by doctors to seek an earlier solution to the sinus problem 
which has troubled her for some time. 
</P>
<P>
She had already pulled out of the Federation Cup team event in Atlanta starting 
July 23. She will now miss a tournament in Montreal the following week and is 
unlikely to compete in the Great American Bank Classic, which begins Aug. 26 in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year Graf was forced out of the game for several weeks after 
breaking a thumb in a skiing accident. 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Emilio Sanchez advanced to the quarterfinals of the Swiss Open 
today in Gstaad, Switzerland, with a 6-3, 6-2 victory over fellow Spaniard 
Jordi Arrese. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Rosset of Switzerland won a quarterfinal shot at Sanchez with a 6-4, 5-7, 
7-6 (9-7) victory over Australian Wally Masur. 
</P>
<P>
In the only upset of the day, Juan Aguilera of Spain, the No. 6 seed, was 
beaten 6-3, 6-4 by countryman Sergi Bruguera. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-seeded Andre Chesnokov of the Soviet Union defeated Tomas Carbonell of 
Spain 7-5, 6-3 and will meet Bruguera in the quarterfinal. 
</P>
<P>
Mats Wilander's tennis comeback suffered a setback today when he was beaten by 
Marcelo Filippini of Uruguay 6-2, 3-6, 7-6 (7-4) in the second round of the 
Swedish Open. 
</P>
<P>
Wilander, ranked No. 1 in the world before slipping and then taking a 
five-month break, made several unforced errors in losing the tiebreak which 
decided the match at Bastad, Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
With Wilander out, the tournament has lost its No. 1 and 2 seeds. Top-seed 
Guillermo Perez Roldan of Argentina was upset by Swede Lars Jonsson in three 
sets Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
No. 4 seed Richard Fromberg of Australia was extended to three sets by Swede 
Nicklas Utgren, winning 6-7, 7-6, 6-3. In the quarterfinals, Fromberg will play 
Diego Perez of Uruguay, who scored a 6-2, 6-3 victory over Magnus Nilsson of 
Sweden in the only other second-round match Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's singles, Csilla Bartos of Switzerland upset former champion and 
No. 2 seed Catarina Lindqvist of Sweden 3-6, 6-2, 6-4 to reach Friday's 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Jakob Hlasek of Switzerland upset second-seeded American Jay Berger, 6-2, 6-1, 
in the first round of the Gunze World tournament today in Osaka, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Hlasek, firing five aces and hitting 66.8% of his first serves, needed just 67 
minutes on the artificial surface at the Osaka Prefectural Gymnasium to 
eliminate Berger.

CAPITALS REPORTEDLY TO RE-SIGN STEVENS; MAY TRADE HIM TO KINGS

<P>
The Washington Capitals will sign free-agent defenseman Scott Stevens and then 
trade him rather than allow him to join the St. Louis Blues, the Associated 
Press reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the situation said the Capitals would match the Blues' offer 
sheet before the 9 p.m. PDT deadline and then trade Stevens to either the 
Montreal Canadiens or Los Angeles Kings. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens signed an offer sheet worth more than $4 million over four years with 
the Blues last Thursday, a deal that would make him the NHL's highest-paid 
defenseman. 
</P>
<P>
The Capitals were unhappy that the Blues went after Stevens and decided to 
match the offer and trade him rather than let the Blues sign him. 
</P>
<P>
If the Capitals re-sign Stevens, they can trade him to any team except the 
Blues. The Capitals had no comment on the report they would re-sign Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens, 26, is an eight-year veteran and was a first-team NHL all-star in 1988 
after scoring a career-high 72 points. He has led Capitals defensemen in 
scoring two of the last three years and has 98 goals and 331 assists in 601 
career games.

The long-held theory among golfers that their sport can cut even the biggest 
player down to size has found scientific support. 
</P>
<P>
According to a paper delivered at the first World Scientific Congress of Golf, 
the average golfer shrinks one-hundredth of an inch during an 18-hole round, or 
16-hundredths if he or she carries a full golf bag over the course. 
</P>
<P>
That finding, by researchers at England's Liverpool Polytechnic College, is 
among the more odd presentations at the four-day conference in this university 
town where golf began centuries ago. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday's opening day, the 300 delegates were told that golf just hasn't 
kept up with performance advances of other sports in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
They also were told not to worry about it.

AN INDEPENDENT VISIONARY;

<P>
THE LATE JAY DEFEO WAS A SAN FRANCISCO LONER WHOSE 'PRIVATE' ART CHALLENGES OUR 
EVERYDAY NOTIONS OF FORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jay DeFeo, who died in 1989, was the mystery woman of Bay Area art. She entered 
the scene as a painter during the golden years of the '50s and '60s when the 
young funk artists, beat poets and jazz musicians were cooking up cockeyed 
rhapsodies and living on a dime. But at a time of social protest and exuberant 
in-group activities, she was an independent visionary devoting herself to what 
she called "private" art. 
</P>
<P>
Starting Friday at the Laguna Art Museum, an exhibit organized by the 
University Art Museum, Berkeley, will span 38 years of DeFeo's work on paper. 
Often using everyday objects as a starting point, she focused on relationships 
of forms to create work with an abstract feel that straddled the territories of 
painting and drawing. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the pieces in the show look like images of real-life objects in the 
process of disappearing or changing into another form. Sometimes it's hard to 
figure out just what the original object was -- either because it has become so 
blurred and fragmentary, or because the angle chosen by DeFeo was so unusual. 
(Drawings of a camera tripod, a tape dispenser and a shoe tree are examples of 
this kind of mysterious evasion.) 
</P>
<P>
DeFeo often reworked a single piece for months -- a methodical approach more 
often associated with painting than drawing -- and frequently applied several 
media (primarily acrylic, pastel, charcoal and wax pencil) in obsessive 
sequences of layers to achieve the occluded effects that she had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
"The Eyes," an uncharacteristically clear-cut image, is nonetheless 
intrinsically related to her more obscure pieces. It is about the process of 
seeing, the essential subject of DeFeo's transmutations of form. The pale glow 
emanating from the eyes (based on DeFeo's own) suggests the focused 
concentration of a larger-than-life Seer -- or an artist who quietly claims 
such powers. Clusters of fine vertical lines read as reflections from a curtain 
positioned between the Seer and the viewer, and rendered transparent by the 
intensity of the Seer's gaze.

THE NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: GARDEN GROVE'S FRIENDLY HENRY'S

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The bartender at Henry's Restaurant is an Indian biker named Stroker. The 
waitress is Faye and the owner is Rae. There's no one named Henry; the place 
was named after the previous owner's poodle. A memorial plaque to Uncle Walty 
is embedded in the bar. Uncle Walty was a regular who always sat at the same 
corner stool. When he died, his friends missed him so much that they took up a 
collection to mark his spot: "Walter L. Whitlock, 1917-1984." 
</P>
<P>
That's the kind of place Henry's is. 
</P>
<P>
Henry's is on a side street just off Garden Grove Boulevard, where it shares a 
building with Dave &amp; Jim's Brake Shop and the All State Construction Co. 
Stroker's Harley is usually parked out front. 
</P>
<P>
The clientele is off-duty cops, construction workers, bikers, letter carriers 
from the nearby post office -- a devoted, tightknit group. The same faces pop 
up repeatedly in a collection of fading Polaroids tacked to a bulletin board 
near the jukebox, where they document nearly a decade of Super Bowl Sundays and 
personal milestones celebrated at Henry's, like birthdays and retirements. 
</P>
<P>
A combination cafe and beer bar, it's many things to many people, depending on 
the time of day. For some, it's the perfect place for an early breakfast, 
complete with loads of homemade hash browns. Regulars fetch their own coffee in 
mugs kept behind the bar just for them. 
</P>
<P>
The faithful return at lunchtime for Rae's blue-plate specials (most of them 
have the menu memorized). The most popular items are the beef dip sandwich and 
the corned beef on rye. Both come with homemade fries (the potato is very big 
here). 
</P>
<P>
Sound a little heavy on the cholesterol? Not to worry. Last year, Faye and Rae 
held a yard sale in the parking lot to raise money for a customer's heart 
transplant. 
</P>
<P>
On weekdays the kitchen closes at 5 p.m., just as the bar crowd starts filing 
in for a cold one after work. It's a friendly place. Newcomers will feel 
welcome, especially during the raucous pool and dart tournaments held to 
benefit local charities or friends in need. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry's Restaurant, 10549 Stanford Ave., Garden Grove. Opens at 6 a.m. Mondays 
through Saturdays and closes between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m., depending on the 
crowd. Kitchen closes at 5 p.m. on weekdays and 1 p.m. on Saturdays. (714) 
537-9884.

MAX JACOBSON: TAME THAI: SKILLFUL BUT SUBURBAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thainakorn of Laguna Hills specializes in Isarn cuisine, the blistering hot 
fare of northeast Thailand, but instead of serving these dishes a la 
Thailandaise -- fired up with heaps of chile, ginger and garlic (as the 
original Thainakorn in Buena Park does) -- the kitchen offers little more than 
occasional puffs of smoke, tame signals of yet another style of cooking being 
toned down to what a restaurant supposes Americans want. 
</P>
<P>
The one saving grace is that things are handled with considerable skill. While 
not a restaurant that piques the senses, Thainakorn manages to be a reasonably 
good one. 
</P>
<P>
Those familiar with the Buena Park Thainakorn also will miss the buzz of 
activity there: the crowded takeout area, the insouciant service, the lively 
Thai clientele. Thainakorn-Laguna Hills is a suburban restaurant with suburban 
manners: the decor is soft and relaxing, the service solicitous and discreet, 
the crowd subdued. The first things you notice about the Buena Park restaurant 
are the barbecue case and the small group of Thai women crowded around woks in 
the open kitchen. The first things you notice in Laguna Hills are a "happy 
hour" sign and a row of deco ceiling fans, turning languidly as if the tropics 
were ever so near. 
</P>
<P>
They aren't, but here's a tip. As you pass the blackboard by the door, stop for 
a closer look. A list of specials is written on it in both Thai and English, 
and these are likely to be best dishes here. 
</P>
<P>
If you're lucky, one will be Thai sausage, the best reason for a visit. It's a 
dense, reddish pink sausage loaded with garlic, ginger and kha (a cousin of 
ginger whose English name is galangal) that crackles appetizingly on the 
outside. You eat it with mint leaves, sliced cabbage and a sticky sweet sauce 
the Thais call nam gai. Try it Isarn style with little clumps of sticky rice 
served from a tiny bamboo basket. It's a wonderful treat, as good as anything 
I've eaten in Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
Here's another tip: After the Thai sausage, be as daring as possible. You won't 
find frog or eel on this blackboard, as you would in Buena Park, but there 
might be Chinese watercress (pak bung), a hollow stalk that is alluringly 
sweet. The chef sautes it to delightful crispness with boiled, fermented soy 
beans. This substantial side dish will grace any entree, particularly seafoods. 
</P>
<P>
Wild boar (moo pa) is another blackboard special of interest. It has a fine, 
firm texture and a good gamy flavor. I just wish the sauce, Thainakorn's 
generic red curry paste with too much lemon grass and not enough chili, was as 
special. That sauce seems to crop up often on the regular menu. 
</P>
<P>
The regular menu contains just over 50 dishes. Unfortunately, repetition of 
sauces means less variety than meets the eye. When dishes are starred in red, 
by the way, it's to indicate that they are house specialties, not to warn you 
about degrees of hotness. Many are pretty bland. 
</P>
<P>
One good dish is phad Thai, flat fried noodles with shrimp, bean sprouts, 
crushed peanut and a heap of sweet red chiles alongside. It seems that everyone 
who comes here eats this dish and I can understand why. The noodles are chewy 
and fresh, and the kitchen is generous with the shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
One dish that doesn't get away with its blandness is tom yum kung, a "hot and 
sour" shrimp soup that turns out to be embarrassingly sweet. If you feel like 
something hot and sour, try gang luong par bang, hot and sour soup with 
catfish. They aren't pulling their punches nearly as much on this one. 
</P>
<P>
One appetizer that scores is nam sod, a minced salad of pork, crushed peanuts 
and red chile. Eat it with fried "crispy rice" and some long beans and cabbage 
and wash it down with ice cold Thai beer. Another is neua dad deal, a hard Thai 
beef jerky you eat with a murky but savory brown bean sauce. But I didn't much 
care for neua nam tok, barbecued beef on a bed of sour vegetables. The taste of 
kha and lemon grass overpowered the beef, which was stringy and underdone. 
</P>
<P>
Entrees include the usual barbecues like chicken and catfish, and a host of 
meats cooked in curry paste or garlic sauce. The barbecued chicken is tasty but 
on the dry side and not quite punchy. The stir-fried pork with pepper and 
garlic is also quite dry; it needs a good sauce. I didn't try the barbecued 
shrimp salad with Thai dressing, but if it's half as good as it is in the other 
restaurant, it should not be missed. 
</P>
<P>
Thainakorn is not real big on dessert. There is a homemade coconut ice cream 
and occasionally something called rum mit: jackfruit, coconut milk and noodles 
flavored with padang leaf served in a soup bowl. This dessert is very much like 
what you'd actually get in Thailand. Too bad there aren't more dishes like it 
at this restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Thainakorn is reasonably priced. Appetizers and salads are $4.95 to $6.95. 
Soups are $5.95 to $9. A la carte dishes are $5 to $16. Combinations are $4.95 
to $9.50.

NEWSBITES: FROM ANTIPASTI TO SEMIFREDDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
This week, a look at some Italian restaurants: 
</P>
<P>
* Enzo Selvaggi, who sang romantic ballads in four languages at several Orange 
County restaurants, is back after eight years in Italy. He and his trio will 
perform soft dinner music at Ciao Bella Restaurant and Bar in Los Caballeros 
Sports Village, 17272 Newhope St., Fountain Valley, Wednesdays through 
Saturdays from 8 to 9 p.m., and music for dancing from 9 to 11:30. To celebrate 
Selvaggi's return, Ciao Bella owner Jay Mastoianni has designed a special 
four-course dinner with a choice of appetizers, salads and entrees, and 
semifreddo (vanilla ice cream, espresso and whipped cream) for dessert. Prices 
are $16 and $18, depending on the entree. (714) 546-7426. 
</P>
<P>
* For light diners, Il Ristorante Bagatta at 3012 Newport Blvd. in Newport 
Beach has introduced "a Mediterranean Experience," antipasto with a selection 
of pasta dishes, Mondays through Thursdays, from 6 to 7:30 for $13. Sundays at 
Bagatta, "A Taste of Milano" offers a sampling of foods from the Lombardy 
region of Italy: risotta alla Milanese, vitello tonnato, pasta e fasoi and many 
other northwestern favorites. You get to choose between three appetizers, first 
courses and entrees; the price range is $16 to $24. Or, you may order from the 
regular menu. (714) 675-4020. 
</P>
<P>
* The newly refurbished patio at Carmelo's, 3520 E. Pacific Coast Highway in 
Corona del Mar, has opened in time for our Mediterranean-type weather. Between 
2 and 5 p.m., you can relax under a red umbrella in the midst of bright flowers 
and enjoy cappuccino, espresso, cocktails or desserts. Then, from 5 to 9 p.m. 
Sundays through Thursdays, you can order a light, informal supper from the 
"Intermezzo" menu. Antipasti range from roasted bell pepper salad with capers 
to fennel salad. There's soup, three pizzas, a dozen pastas, from pennette with 
eggplant to gnocchi with pesto, homemade desserts -- and everything's under 
$10. Look for expanded al fresco service soon. (714) 675-1922. 
</P>
<P>
* Meanwhile, back at the old Nieuport 17 location, 1615 E. 17th St. in Santa 
Ana, owner Bill Bettis and operator Jeff Altman open That Other Place 
Ristorante this week. The restaurant, which has a new front entrance, accents 
continental cuisine with a central-northern Italian flair. The chef is Ali 
Dundar, formerly of Chez Dante in Newport Beach and Lawry's Prime Rib in 
Beverly Hills. And yes, there's still a piano bar. It's open Mondays through 
Fridays for lunch and Mondays through Saturdays for dinner, with full dinner 
prices in the $20-22 ballpark. (714) 541-9511. 
</P>
<P>
Table Talk: Could La Vie en Rose, at 240 S. State College Blvd. in Brea, be 
Orange County's answer to Schwab's drug store in L.A., where at least one film 
star is said to have been discovered? Mike Riley was a waiter at La Vie until 
ABC-TV found him and snatched him away to host Merv Griffin's new Saturday 
night game show, "Monopoly." The network filmed Mike's last night at the 
restaurant several weeks ago. . . . BEVERLY BUSH SMITH

AMERICAN 
</P>
<P>
* Belisle's, 12001 Harbor Blvd., Garden Grove. (714) 750-6560. Open 24 hours a 
day, seven days a week. $$ 
</P>
<P>
After a long day at Disneyland, treat your out-of-town guest to Belisle's. The 
truck stop-style restaurant in Garden Grove trades on giant platters (once you 
see the serving sizes, you may want to share a dish), eye-popping pastries and 
true grit Americana like grits, mush, and corn bread. Good morning, y'all. 
</P>
<P>
* Faraday's Grill and Spirits, 13102 Newport Ave., Tustin. (714) 730-3442. Open 
Sundays through Thursdays from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays to 11 
p.m. $ 
</P>
<P>
 Faraday's is a family restaurant with cheerful service, juicy burgers and some 
mighty devoted fans. Why else would anyone wait half an hour for institutional 
food on a Tuesday evening? Everybody goes ape over onion strings -- mountains 
of flour-dredged onions deep fried until crispy -- and the sappy sweet barbecue 
that kids favor so shamelessly. Breakfast is actually quite credible here, with 
fluffy pancakes, homemade muffins, and squeezed-to-order OJ. Portions are 
predictably generous and prices are modest. 
</P>
<P>
* Pinnacle Peak, 9100 Trask Ave., Garden Grove. (714) 892-7311. Open Mondays 
through Fridays from 5 to 9:30 p.m.; weekends to 10 p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
* Crazy Horse Steak House, 1580 Brookhollow Drive, Santa Ana. (714) 549-1512. 
Open Sundays through Thursdays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 5 to 10 p.m.; Fridays 
and Saturdays 5 to 11 p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
While everyone else is busy disavowing addiction to good steak, sneak off to 
one of these places. Leave the tie at home when you visit Pinnacle Peak; 
someone will sneak up on you and cut it off. Honest. The restaurant's trail 
boss steak, cooked over an open flame, is a char-broiled monster, a great value 
at $9.95. The Crazy Horse is a bit longer on atmosphere but, apart from the 
high-grade beef, it's run-of-the-mill. Many of the side dishes have been 
frozen, and the whole place has a packaged feel about it. 
</P>
<P>
* Rutabegorz, 211 N. Pomona Ave., Fullerton. (714) 738-9339 and at 158 W. Main 
St., Tustin. (714) 731-9807. Both open seven days, 11 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. $ 
</P>
<P>
* The Greenery Natural Kitchen, 119 E. Commonwealth Ave., Fullerton. (714) 
870-0981 and at 323 S. Magnolia St., Anaheim. (714) 761-8103. Both open Mondays 
through Fridays, 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.; Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. $ 
</P>
<P>
Rutabegorz in Fullerton looks as if it belongs on a college campus; the food 
served there does, too. Best avoid the frozen poultry casseroles in favor of 
the meatless dishes like stuffed squash or veggie lasagna. Desserts like carrot 
cake and apple pie are reminiscent of a church bake sale. The Greenery is a 
modest, unadorned storefront restaurant with homey, health-conscious fare. Best 
dishes are the lentil burrito with guacamole and the unburger, made from ground 
nuts and brown rice. Both restaurants are inexpensive with few dishes over $5. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CHINESE 
</P>
<P>
* Emperor's Fortune, 3820 Plaza Drive, Santa Ana. (714) 850-9008. Open Mondays 
through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Saturdays to 11 p.m. $$$ 
</P>
<P>
Emperor's Fortune is the latest incarnation in haute Chinese, a Hong 
Kong-elegant dining room designed with obvious expense. Everything is 
well-crafted, even if the taste spectrum tends to be on the bland side, and 
there is considerable imagination in the presentations. Peking duck, with an 
amazingly crispy skin, is the big hitter, and you will want to try such dishes 
as shrimp go nuts, mussels in garlic sauce and any of the wonderful desserts 
(from Grand Finale). Expect to have your wallet lightened considerably. 
</P>
<P>
* Orange Blossom, 3804 E. Chapman Ave., Orange. (714) 633-1888. Open daily from 
4:30 p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
* Beijing, 2940 E. Chapman Ave., Orange. (714) 744-2491. Open daily from 11:30 
a.m. to 10 p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
Orange Blossom and Beijing are two radically different Chinese restaurants 
within scant blocks of one another on Chapman Avenue in Orange. Orange Blossom 
is a dinner house that faces West in spirit, Beijing is primarily a lunch place 
with an Eastern bent. Orange Blossom has innovative dishes like butterfly 
eggplant with a cream cheese filling, and minced pigeon in lettuce cups. 
Beijing has terrific Mandarin chicken in a vinegary sauce, and twice cooked 
pork, a fiery Szechuan specialty that has been boiled, then pan fried with 
vegetables. Both restaurants are winners. 
</P>
<P>
* 3-6-9 Shanghai, 613 N. Euclid St., Anaheim. (714) 635-8369. Open daily except 
Sundays from 11:30 a.m.; Mondays through Thursdays to 9:30 p.m.; Fridays and 
Saturdays to 10 p.m. $ 
</P>
<P>
One of the best small Chinese restaurants in the heavily ethnic San Gabriel 
Valley, 3-6-9 Shanghai has opened this storefront sister in an Anaheim shopping 
mall, bringing nearly all of its popular dishes. Handmade breads and savory 
dumpling preparations excel here along with such exotic cold appetizers as 
tea-smoked chicken and braised baby bamboo. The restaurant is cheap and basic; 
tell them to tread lightly on the MSG. The steamed pork with rice is a 
revelation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CONTINENTAL 
</P>
<P>
* Gustaf Anders, South Coast Plaza Village, 3810 S. Plaza Drive, Santa Ana. 
(714) 668-1737. Open daily from 11:30 a.m. to midnight. $$$ 
</P>
<P>
Now that Gustav Anders has had time to settle in, it has established itself 
firmly as one of the area's most distinctive restaurants. Maitre d' Bill 
Magnuson is an able, solicitous host, and service here is nearly perfect. Ulf 
Strandberg, a classically trained chef from Sweden who dabbles in many genres, 
has ironed out the inconsistencies that plagued his kitchen when the restaurant 
first opened. The wild rice pancake, sugar and salt-cured salmon, 
minced-parsley salad and wonderful house breads all merit a wide detour. 
</P>
<P>
* JW's, Anaheim Marriott Hotel, 700 W. Convention Way, Anaheim. (714) 750-0900. 
Open Mondays through Saturdays from 6 to 9 p.m. $$$$ 
</P>
<P>
JW's is one of those staunchly old-school special occasion restaurants, but the 
food is somewhat innovative and of surprisingly high quality. Appetizers show a 
certain daring, like home-grown foie gras served on a potato galette in a 
Madeira sauce, or escargot ravioli with wild mushrooms. Main dishes show 
enthusiasm as well, and the sauces accompanying them are generally big hits. 
Roast boar comes drenched with a simple sauce of sage, juniper and honey and 
has a robust spiciness. Venison comes in a sauce based on red wine vinegar. 
Prices are definitely on the high end; service, attentive and manicured. It is 
fail-safe the way only a good hotel restaurant can be. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ENGLISH 
</P>
<P>
* McCharles House, 335 S. C St., Tustin. (714) 731-4063. Open Mondays through 
Saturdays from 11:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. for lunch; 2 to 5 p.m. for tea; Thursdays 
through Saturdays from 5:30 to 9 p.m. for dinner. $$ 
</P>
<P>
If you have never experienced a proper English tea, then now's your chance at 
this converted Victorian house, built circa 1885 in Tustin's Old Town. You'll 
even get heart-shaped scones. Audrey Heredia and her daughter, Vivian, fuss 
over this dining and tearoom, a spinster's fantasy of wooden tables, tasseled 
lamps and enough doilies to make Gladys Cooper an overcoat.

<P>
* Pascal, Plaza Newport, 1000 Bristol St., Newport Beach. (714) 752-0107. Open 
Mondays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.; Mondays through Thursdays 
from 6 to 9:30 p.m.; weekends to 10 p.m. Closed Sundays. No Saturday lunch. $$$ 
</P>
<P>
Pascal is the latest, brightest and most engaging of the small area restaurants 
serving unadulterated French cuisine. You don't have to worry about being 
terrorized by the waiters or cream-sauced to death in this charming country 
cottage. The chef, Pascal Olhats, has solid experience and uses nothing 
artificial in his kitchen. Don't miss a delightful Provencal fish soup 
appetizer or a lamb salad, redolent of sweet basil. An entree of sea bass, 
coated with thyme and served in a tomato coulis, is worth the trip. Desserts 
are light and guiltless. 
</P>
<P>
* The Wine Cellar, Hyatt Newporter, 1107 Jamboree Road, Newport Beach. (714) 
644-1700. Open Tuesdays through Saturdays from 6 to 10 p.m. $$$ 
</P>
<P>
The Wine Cellar is Orange County's newest temple of haute cuisine. Menus are 
rotated every week and consist of five courses, designed by Jean Banchet of Le 
Francais in Wheeling, Ill., one of the most famous chefs in the world today. 
Menu VI -- which begins with a cold pheasant pate with green chartreuse, 
continues with a stuffed filet of sole in a champagne sauce, and features 
grilled squab with green cabbage and natural juices -- is one of six prie fixe 
menus presented by executive chef Ted Gray, and it is a knockout. You won't 
find better French cuisine anywhere in the state.

INDIAN 
</P>
<P>
* Far Pavilions, 1520 W. Coast Highway, Newport Beach. (714) 548-7167. Open 
seven days from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and from 5 to 10:30 p.m. $$$ 
</P>
<P>
Elegant, beachfront Indian dining. Far Pavilions has a surfeit of specialties 
hard to find in other local restaurants: minced chicken balls in a spicy tomato 
puree, bhindi masala (curried okra) and bihari kabab, a saucy chicken dish from 
north central India. Some flavors run together here, but you can avoid that 
problem by sandwiching dishes in the fine tandoori breads from the restaurant's 
clay oven. Meats from the same oven are so good they should be eaten 
bareheaded, kneeling.

ITALIAN 
</P>
<P>
* Amici, 3220 Park Center Drive, Coast Mesa. (714) 850-9399. Open Mondays 
through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., Mondays through Thursdays from 
5:30 to 10:30 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays from 5:30 to 11:30 p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
Massimo Navaretta is alive and well at Amici, making even more of an impression 
than he did at Scampi, his previous success. This is a serious new restaurant 
that is small and intimate, all deco lines and salmon-colored sconces, and what 
comes out of the kitchen is equally stylish. Special antipasti like potato 
souffle with porcini and lightly fried zucchini blossoms are pure magic; 
wonderful scampi are flown in from Europe and are fabulous eaten from the 
shell. Great pastas, excellent imported wines. 
</P>
<P>
* Baci, 18748 Beach Blvd., Huntington Beach. (714) 965-1194. Open Wednesdays 
through Saturdays from 5:30 to 10 p.m. and Sundays 4 to 9 p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
Baci is just a storefront restaurant with modest decor, but young New Yorker 
Angelo Parisi gives his food a rough sophistication; nearly all his dishes are 
touched with originality. All of Italy finds its way onto Parisi's small menu. 
Complimentary appetizers might be a superbly light chicken minestrone or some 
cold garlic-infused broccoli. Dishes such as fettuccine agnello, flat noodles 
with stewed lamb, and linguine tuttomare, with scungilli and shrimp, sustain 
the enthusiasm. The best dessert is panna cotta, the poor man's creme brulee. 
</P>
<P>
* Caffe Piemonte, 1835 E. Chapman Ave., Orange. (714) 532-3296. Open Tuesdays 
through Sundays, 5 to 10 p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
Two brothers from Piemonte, one of Italy's most scenic provinces, have opened 
this handsome, spotless little trattoria in the city of Orange and already it 
has become a county hot spot. Start any meal here with the wonderful, sumptuous 
antipasto and then move to one of chef Luigi Ravetto's hand-extruded homemade 
pastas. One stand-out, the routelle, is chewy little six-spoked wheels, perfect 
for soaking up sauce. Ravetto's cooking is somewhat generic, but he has 
included polenta, the cornmeal staple of his province, and you really should 
try it. His polenta Piemontese, with a light, grainy cheese sauce, is most 
appealing. 
</P>
<P>
* California Pizza Kitchen, Fashion Island, 1151 Newport Center Drive, Newport 
Beach. (714) 759-5543. Open Mondays through Thursdays from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.; 
Fridays and Saturdays to 11 p.m.; Sundays to 9 p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
With the '80s came the designer pizza, and it looks as if the phenomenon is 
here to stay. That's what the California Pizza Kitchen is banking on, anyway. 
This slicked-down operation, designed for flash and staffed with young, 
beautiful people, serves an eclectic, almost futuristic array of pizzas topped 
with everything from goat cheese to peanut sauce. Service is somewhat 
indifferent at present. High energy owners Larry Flax and Rick Rosenfeld should 
fix that problem soon. Best to stick with the pizzas that don't fall too far 
from the tree: five-cheese, homemade sausage and a delicious barbecued chicken. 
</P>
<P>
* Sapori, 1080 Bayside Drive, Newport Beach. (714) 644-4220. Open daily from 
11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. and from 5 to 10 p.m.; Fridays from 5 to 11 p.m.; 
Saturdays from 5 to 11 p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
Sapori is a modish, elegant neighborhood trattoria where the cooking is 
serious. Chefs Adriano and Franco Maniacci hail from Palermo, Sicily, but play 
no favorites with regard to the many regions of Italan cuisine. Bruschetta di 
pane Saracena, triangles of roasted wheat bread with a garlic puree, are 
delightful, and many pastas come blanketed in savory sauces. Suprema di rombo, 
turbot in a leek and watercress sauce, pays homage to nouvelle. Veal Milanese 
is the best you'll find anywhere. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
JAPANESE 
</P>
<P>
* Horikawa, South Coast Village, 3800 S. Plaza Drive, Santa Ana. (714) 
557-2531. Open Tuesdays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m to 2 p.m.; Tuesdays 
through Thursdays from 6 to 10 p.m.; Fridays from 6 to 10:30 p.m.; Saturdays 
from 5:30 to 11 p.m.; Sundays from 5:30 to 9:30 p.m. $$$ 
</P>
<P>
At Horikawa the simplest food tends to be the best: beef tataki (an appetizer 
of sizzling filet mignon) is delightful, and broiled salmon is good. But 
tempura, the batter-fried shrimp and vegetable dishes, are leaden and 
overcooked, and various combination plates are insipid and expensive to boot. 
Your best bet is the upstairs teppan room, where knife-juggling chefs sear 
delicacies over a metal grill. The restaurant is expensive; better hope the 
company account covers this one. 
</P>
<P>
* Kotobuki, 24356 Avenida de la Carlota, Laguna Hills. (714) 587-0290. Open 
Mondays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., Mondays through Saturdays 
from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
Totally awesome. That's how Hiro Watanabe, sushi-maker extraordinaire, 
describes most of his creations at Kotobuki, his pint-size, big-hearted new 
Japanese restaurant. Hiro-san's food has a quirky appeal -- from Philadelphia 
roll (crab, avocado and cream cheese) to the more authentic preparations such 
as uni (sea urchin) and hamachi (yellowtail). Put yourself in the chef's hands 
and let him do his thing. He probably will anyway. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
KOREAN 
</P>
<P>
* Sun Hai, 8942 Garden Grove Blvd., Garden Grove. (714) 534-9670. Open daily 
from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. $ 
</P>
<P>
This tiny hole-in-the-mini-mall, in a quiet Korean neighborhood in Garden 
Grove, serves some of the best Chinese dumplings you will ever taste, at 
laughably low prices. Best are pan-fried dumplings, eight to an order, 
perfectly browned, crunchy and toothsome, eaten with rice vinegar and Korean 
chili paste. Also wonderful is the restaurant's spicy fried chicken, a 
sumptously blended dish of red and green chilis, green onions and little bits 
of batter-fried chicken that have been rolled in pepper salt. Nobody here 
speaks very good English, but the smiles generated by the food are more than 
you will need to communicate.

MEXICAN 
</P>
<P>
* Salud, 17041 Beach Blvd., Huntington Beach. (714) 842-1194. Open Mondays 
through Thursdays from 11:30 a.m. to 11 p.m., Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 1 
a.m.; Saturdays from 4 p.m. to 1 a.m.; Sundays from 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
Salud, a new high-concept Mexican restaurant from Larry Cano, has an outlandish 
design that looks like a set Roger Corman might have used for a movie on Aztec 
discomania. All the trendy Mexican buttons are pushed: hand-shaken margaritas, 
'80s chilis, blue corn. Avoid the usual Meximush and head for the soups, 
grilled meats and desserts. Pozole verde is hominy and shredded chicken in 
broth, and it's great. So is Ibarra chocolate bread pudding, little cubes of 
fudge-soaked bread in a tequila orange cream sauce. Prices are reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MOROCCAN 
</P>
<P>
* Almagreb, Saddleback Plaza, 23700 El Toro Road, El Toro. (714) 859-9393. Open 
for dinner only, Tuesdays through Sundays from 6 to 10p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
Almagreb is one of the most dramatic Moroccan dining areas anywhere. Meals are 
taken in the traditional style, with no utensils, and are finger-licking good. 
Among the better offerings are b'stilla (a sugar-dusted chicken pie), and 
couscous (cracked semolina wheat in a savory vegetable stew). Entertainment is 
provided by belly dancer extraordinaire, Tanya. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SEAFOOD 
</P>
<P>
* Parker's Seafood Grill, 309 Palm St., Newport Beach. (714) 673-3741. Open 
daily from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. $$ 
</P>
<P>
Parker's Seafood Grill had its maiden voyage recently and already is afloat on 
a steady course. It is a tried-and-true formula with an elegant twist: fresh 
fish, an ocean view and the added appeal of an open kitchen and mesquite. The 
eclectic menu features a wide variety of fresh seafoods which changes daily, 
and there is a chewy, yeasty house bread stick to compliment them. Desserts are 
sensational, all made on the premises, highlighted by pies; a smooth, creamy 
key lime, and a wonderful Toll House. 
</P>
<P>
* Scott's Seafood Grill, 3300 Bristol St., Costa Mesa. (714) 979-2400. Open 
daily from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. Closes at 10 p.m. 
on Sundays. $$$ 
</P>
<P>
Scott's started life with a bang in 1976, but the city was San Francisco. That 
was then, this is now. Today, in a stunning new Costa Mesa location, the 
romance wears a bit thin. Good oysters, rich clam chowder and a good wine list 
make for pleasant beginnings, but the fresh mesquite-grilled fish is often 
devoid of flavor, as one would expect in such a high-volume operation. Save 
room for the homemade desserts and the good espresso. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THEME DINNERS 
</P>
<P>
* Hornblower Yacht Cruises, P.O. Box 1779, Newport Beach. Call (714) 548-8700 
for further information. $$$ 
</P>
<P>
Hornblower offers weekend dinner cruises in exotic Newport Harbor as an 
acceptable alternative to shore-bound dining drudgery, and brings if off with 
style. Chef Todd Mosher, a young Bay Area talent, keeps the menu simple and 
satisfying, limiting the options to three exquisitely prepared specialties. 
Accoutrements, such as an excellent trendy salad of oak leaf and chicory, and 
real San Francisco sourdough, reflect solid taste and good judgment. There is a 
dance band available for those who get antsy offshore. Also Sunday brunch.

RYAN'S SONG: HAVE IMPACT AS FRESHMAN AT BERKELEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. A. ADANDE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ryan Jamison will never have to worry about being overlooked. After all, he is 
6 feet 11. 
</P>
<P>
For Jamison, a Mar Vista resident who is headed to UC Berkeley on a basketball 
scholarship, the question is how much will he contribute to the Golden Bears' 
quest for a Pacific 10 Conference title during the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
Jamison was the starting center at Loyola High for three years. He began as a 
cautious sophomore, surrounded by a senior-dominated lineup that handled the 
scoring duties. By his senior year, he blossomed into an All-CIF first-team 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
He set school career records for field goal percentage (61.6%), rebounds (714) 
and blocked shots (194). He averaged 18.9 points and 11.5 rebounds a game last 
season and set school season records for field goal percentage (65.3), rebounds 
(323) and blocked shots (89). He also set single-game records of 28 rebounds 
and 11 blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I think my progression has been in confidence," Jamison said. "As a sophomore, 
I could have played a lot better if I had confidence in myself." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Thomason, the boys' basketball coach at Loyola, saw a change in Jamison's 
physique as well as a more aggressive attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"He got stronger physically and took more responsibility for scoring and 
rebounding," Thomason said. "In his senior year, he was the player we'd look to 
for scoring. He was never a project, he simply had to get to the point where he 
felt he could be a force." 
</P>
<P>
Thomason noticed a major breakthrough in December when the team was playing in 
the Beach Ball Classic in Myrtle Beach, S.C. It faced Archbishop Shaw, the 
Louisiana state champions who were led by All-American center Melvin Simon. 
Early in the game, Jamison got the ball in the low post, faked, dribbled once 
and dunked over Simon. 
</P>
<P>
"It showed he knew his place, that he wasn't going to back off against 
anybody," Thomason said. "More than just the two points, it was the feeling he 
gave me of how far he had come since his sophomore year." 
</P>
<P>
Jamison will have to make even more progress if he wants to be a factor in the 
Pac-10. California Coach Lou Campanelli said he would like Jamison to add 25 
pounds to his current weight of 215. But he is willing to wait for Jamison to 
develop. 
</P>
<P>
"When we recruited Ryan, we were looking at a few years down the line," 
Campanelli said. "If he works hard he could be a fine player. He has good hands 
and a soft touch." 
</P>
<P>
Jamison looks as if he belongs at the beach, not in the gym. His short blond 
hair, tanned skin and soft-spoken demeanor fit the stereotypical Southern 
California image. It's no surprise, then, that the Mar Vista resident also 
plays volleyball, the unofficial sport of the beach. 
</P>
<P>
He played for Loyola as a sophomore, when the team won the mythical national 
championship. Jamison did not play during his junior year due to off-season 
basketball conflicts, but returned as a senior to help the Cubs win the Del Rey 
League. A few colleges were interested in Jamison for his volleyball skills, 
but he was intent on playing basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very interested in him," USC volleyball Coach Jim McLaughlin said. 
"But his coach told us he was going to play basketball, so we called off the 
dogs. I think he had the potential to be a great middle blocker." 
</P>
<P>
Jamison said: "Not to put the sport down, but volleyball sometimes gets a 
little boring to me. You don't get to run all the time, and you're not involved 
in all the plays." 
</P>
<P>
But he did choose volleyball over baseball, with the seasons running at the 
same time. Jamison, a pitcher, denied the Del Rey League the unusual sight of 
seeing a 6-11 player standing atop the mound. 
</P>
<P>
Jamison said that playing volleyball has helped his basketball game by 
improving his coordination and lateral movement. Of the three sports, Jamison 
has been playing basketball the longest, having first picked up a ball 10 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
By making basketball his No. 1 pick, Jamison also chose to play the sport with 
the most intense recruiting process. The summer before Jamison's junior year, 
Thomason met with him and his parents to tell them what the coming year had in 
store. Jamison said this, along with the coach's periodic advice during the 
season, helped him keep things in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, (being recruited) was a positive experience for me," Jamison said. "A 
lot of people think of it as being a real burden. But I seemed to control it. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned about people and what they'd try to do when they want something. 
Everyone was trying to be my friend, so I looked out for those types of 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Loyola Marymount, UC Santa Barbara and New Mexico were among Jamison's final 
choices, but California's combination of coaches, academics, location and a 
challenging conference won out. 
</P>
<P>
Jamison's hopes for a high school basketball championship ended when Loyola 
lost the Southern Section 5-A Division championship game to Mater Dei, 83-57. 
Jamison, who had lost 20 pounds during a weeklong bout with the flu, scored 
only six points and grabbed six rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know about beating Mater Dei even if I was healthy, but I would have 
loved to have been 100%," Jamison said. "You always want to imagine yourself 
playing in front of a big crowd and doing well. It was a big letdown." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the memory of that disappointment will drive Jamison to work harder in 
college. He won't be playing against high school boys anymore, and California 
is a team on the rise. The Golden Bears went to the NCAA tournament last 
season, and defeated Indiana in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Thomason said Jamison's improvement is only a matter of putting in enough 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
"He has the skills, he has the talent, he just has to keep working and he'll 
improve," Thomason said. "And you can't put a premium on a 6-11 guy with his 
versatility." 
</P>
<P>
Jamison had an active role both offensively and defensively in Thomason's 
up-tempo style of play. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not the type of big kid who just plops down in the low post," Thomason 
said. "He can run the court, fill the lane (on fast breaks) and hit the jump 
shot." 
</P>
<P>
Campanelli knows he's getting a multiskilled player. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got the ability to score and he's a very good passer for a big man," 
Campanelli said. "Once he gets stronger, he'll be able to rebound better. He's 
got the potential to be a solid player in the Pac-10." 
</P>
<P>
The consensus between the coaches is that only Jamison will determine how 
effective he can be. You can add Jamison's name to the list. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it all depends on me," Jamison said. "Cal never promised me anything, 
they're just willing to give me a fair shot. I'm just going to give it 100% and 
whatever comes out of it, I can live with it. Either way, I'm prepared."

MONARCH SOPHOMORE BOSEMAN SOARS, SCORES; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: FLASHY GUARD IS MAKING AN IMPACT WITH HIS PLAY THIS SUMMER. HE'S 
ALREADY BEING COMPARED TO LAKER GUARD BYRON SCOTT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID RAATZ, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Morningside High phenomenon Stais Boseman is the first to admit that his 
basketball style is a bit on the flashy side. 
</P>
<P>
He knows he doesn't have to do a fancy reverse dunk whenever he gets a 
breakaway. He just enjoys it. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to dunk with authority whenever I can," the 6-foot-3 Boseman said. "I 
love to get my teammates enthused with a great dunk. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to get the crowd going and to intimidate the other team." 
</P>
<P>
But, make no mistake; despite his flair for theatrics, Boseman is a serious 
player. And he's very coachable. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent game at the Carson Grand Finale tournament at Carson High, for 
instance, Boseman was bringing the ball up court when a coach yelled, "Work for 
your shot." Boseman's response: a shoulder fake, a nifty behind-the-back 
dribble, two big steps and a layup. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Boseman was admonished, "You're dribbling too much." His reaction? He 
picked up his dribble and sank a three-point shot while being fouled. 
</P>
<P>
Style, skill and adaptability are all part of the Boseman package. But it's 
another attribute -- his youth -- that's particularly exciting to college 
scouts watching him this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Boseman is a member of Morningside's Class of '93. As a freshman last season, 
he was the top reserve for the Monarchs, who went 24-4. 
</P>
<P>
"He was an important part of that team," Morningside Co-Coach Carl Franklin 
said. "He often scored in double figures, although not every night, but he did 
so many other things well, too. 
</P>
<P>
"This year I expect him to be in double figures just about all the time. The 
sky's the limit for him." 
</P>
<P>
Although most players would be satisfied just to have the opportunity to play 
varsity basketball as a ninth-grader, Boseman said the 1989-90 season left him 
with "a bad taste." After winning the Ocean League championship, the top-seeded 
Monarchs were upset by Lompoc in the quarterfinals of the CIF Southern Section 
3-AA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed at the way our season ended," said Boseman, who turned 16 in 
March. "I didn't like the way we lost, so I'm on a mission this year. 
</P>
<P>
"And it all starts in the summer." 
</P>
<P>
Complacency did in the talented Morningside team, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We tend to take teams too lightly," said Boseman, who plays both guard and 
forward. "At least since I've been here, we seem to start slowly and take 
things for granted. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't do that against a good team. We have to be more consistent, 
especially in rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
"Losing to Lompoc was actually a good experience for all that we learned." 
</P>
<P>
And learning is first and foremost on Boseman's mind. He's taking classes at 
Morningside this summer to stay on course for entrance into college. 
</P>
<P>
And on the basketball court, he's learning to play point guard after spending 
most of his younger days as a front-court player and most of last season as a 
swing man. 
</P>
<P>
"We've looked at him mostly as a small forward or an off-guard," Franklin said. 
"But he's a versatile player and a decent ball handler. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't necessarily think he'll be used a lot at point guard, but it's 
interesting to see him there. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too early to evaluate him, to say, 'This is what he can do and this what 
he can't do.' That's not fair because his precise direction isn't clear." 
</P>
<P>
Boseman, who played mostly point guard in the Carson Grand Finale, said his 
future may indeed be at the point. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at college and the pros, and there are a lot of big (point guards), 
guys who are 6-4 or 6-5," he said. "And I feel very comfortable handling the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter to me too much where I can play, as long as I'm helping the 
team. I feel like I can play any position." 
</P>
<P>
Boseman would be delighted to keep growing, even in the unlikely event that 
gets up to Magic Johnson territory at 6-9. But he feels fortunate to be as tall 
as he is now. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was in the fifth grade, a doctor told me the tallest I'd ever get was 
6-1," said Boseman, who played at 6-2 last year and whose mother is 6 feet 
tall. "So I don't go by that anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll just let the Lord take care of it. I guess every inch I get now is a 
bonus." 
</P>
<P>
Boseman is standing tall in the reviews he's getting this summer. Co-Coach Ron 
Randle said his soon-to-be sophomore doesn't need to take a back seat to any 
Morningside athlete from the past, including Olympic volleyball star Flo Hyman, 
1990 prep All-American basketball player Lisa Leslie and Laker veteran Byron 
Scott. 
</P>
<P>
One day, Stais Boseman will also rank as a great name in sports history, Randle 
said. In fact, Franklin said, Boseman is more advanced at this stage of his 
career than Scott was. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not just his own coaches who are Boseman believers. Less-biased 
observers are also heaping praise upon him. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's been a freshman player with his type of impact in the 
league in a long time, several years certainly," said Coach Steve Shaw of Ocean 
League rival Redondo. "He's going to be a nice player, and I know his coaches 
are very high on him. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, we're going to be in the same league with him for the next few 
years." 
</P>
<P>
"He's awesome, like a man among boys," Carson Coach Richard Masson said. "He's 
only going to be a 10th-grader, but he does some things that are unbelievable. 
</P>
<P>
"He's as developed as most seniors going into college. He has a good work 
ethic, and if he continues to improve, he could just be unreal." 
</P>
<P>
When asked if he could remember any Los Angeles-area player being as good as 
Boseman at such a young age, Masson replied: "Maybe John Williams at Crenshaw." 
(Williams is now a star forward for the Washington Bullets.) 
</P>
<P>
Masson went on to enumerate Boseman's strengths: pressure defense, three-point 
shooting, dunking, passing. . . . He concluded simply: "This guy is darn good." 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't taken long for college coaches to get the word on Boseman, either. In 
fact, he was getting congratulatory letters from college programs as early as 
the beginning of last season, when he made Morningside's varsity team. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the college scouts will come up and ask me his name after they see 
him play," Franklin said. "They're usually very surprised that he's going to be 
just a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
"He looks mature physically, and he plays with a calm demeanor and confidence. 
He's a rare talent." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, without self-assurance Boseman wouldn't be anywhere near where he is as 
a basketball player. His belief in himself has been evident since he first set 
foot on the Morningside campus. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I could contribute as a freshman, but I didn't know if I would get the 
opportunity to make the team," Boseman said. "When I got my turn, I made the 
most of it. 
</P>
<P>
"After I talked to the coaches, they thought I should try out for varsity. I 
figured it was worth a try." 
</P>
<P>
Boseman easily made the team but took a little time to establish himself as a 
vital member of the Monarchs. Early in the league season, he had a high-scoring 
game at Mira Costa. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a big second quarter, about 13 points, I think," he said. "That's when I 
felt like I proved myself as a varsity player. 
</P>
<P>
"Up till then, I wasn't quite myself. I wasn't doing the things I had done in 
junior high. 
</P>
<P>
"From then on, I didn't feel any pressure. I was relaxed, and I just played." 
</P>
<P>
Boseman had been used to starting ever since he began playing organized 
basketball at age 10 in a local park league. Last season, with the experienced 
Morningside team starting four seniors and junior post player Arthur Savage, 
Boseman got just one start. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of hard to adjust to coming off the bench at first," Boseman said. 
"But I got used to it. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody on the team kind of picked me up and helped me along. They helped me 
off the court, too -- how to get along in my classes and everything else." 
</P>
<P>
And Boseman, who said he is taking "as many academic classes as possible," has 
enjoyed his non-athletic experiences at Morningside as much as basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"I really like Morningside, even though I've had people try to tell me it's a 
bad school," he said. "In fact, I almost went to Hawthorne because of what 
people were saying. 
</P>
<P>
"I had people tell me I was a fool for going to Morningside instead, that I was 
stupid. But I've liked it. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom convinced me to stay in Inglewood and go to Morningside. She said that 
because I developed my skills in the parks nearby ever since I was in the 
fourth or fifth grade, that I should stay in the community and not go to 
another city." 
</P>
<P>
Boseman added that he is proud to be an emerging part of Morningside's 
outstanding athletic tradition. The success of former Monarch basketball 
players offers inspiration to current players, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"With two Morningside graduates on the Lakers (Scott and 1990 draft choice 
Elden Campbell) and Tyrone Paul going to Clemson, it shows guys on our team 
what can happen," Boseman said. "But it's so hard to be make professional 
sports that you have to be realistic about it. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if you're a great player, there's not that good a chance. Still, it's 
neat to have a guy that you've talked to a little bit and seen around some make 
it all the way." 
</P>
<P>
Boseman said improvement in his three-point shooting is one of his top 
priorities this summer as he strives for his ultimate goal, a college 
scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm inconsistent," he said. "I'll make a bunch one game, then make only one or 
two the next time. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a big part of the college game, and I know that's where I want to be. 
And I know I can't afford to go to college without a scholarship." 
</P>
<P>
Boseman is also seeking improvement in a less tangible area of basketball 
skill. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to work on my leadership abilities," he said. "That's the most 
important thing, I think. 
</P>
<P>
"You might not even be a very good player, but you can always contribute as a 
leader. Actually, I don't like to lead verbally too much. 
</P>
<P>
"My style is more to try to lead with my play. I don't talk a whole lot to my 
teammates, and I don't talk trash to the other team. 
</P>
<P>
"But I love making a statement with a dunk, to do it with a little flair. Last 
year, I would have breakaway opportunities and not really do anything special. 
</P>
<P>
"But my friends kept telling me to dunk. Finally, this summer I've started to 
dunk with a little more authority. 
</P>
<P>
"When I get a breakaway or I have a dead-eye lane to the basket, I'll always 
try to dunk." 
</P>

JAMES BRINGING NEW LESSON PLAN FOR SUCCESS TO VENTURA COLLEGE; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: COACH RETURNS TO THE POSITION HE HELD IN 1970S, BUT HE'S PREACHING 
VALUES IN ADDITION TO VICTORIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It sounds like loser talk, the kind heard at football programs at places like 
Rice and Northwestern. Is this what a school wants its new coach saying? 
</P>
<P>
"Winning is important, but it isn't the only thing and I don't think I have 
anything to prove," says Dick James, who is taking over Ventura College's 
football program. "To come in here and say that I've got to be 10-0 and that's 
my driving force and that's my only goal, I'm not into that anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Something more important than wins and losses? Shouldn't coaches be burned at 
the goal post for such heresy? It appears to be a recipe for a losing team and 
an early ticket to another job. 
</P>
<P>
It's also called perspective, and it comes from a guy who already is the 
winningest football coach in Ventura College history. 
</P>
<P>
James, who served as a Ventura assistant coach the past two years, returns to 
the position he held from 1970-79 when he led Ventura to a 58-40 record. He 
knows he'll win his fair share of games, and now he's interested in something 
more ephemeral yet more lasting. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel less pressure to win, having been involved with football for 23 years," 
James said. "You don't remember the wins as much as you remember the people you 
had an association with." 
</P>
<P>
Not the kind of coach who thinks the alphabet begins at L and ends at W, James 
is determined to take a holistic approach to coaching football players. 
</P>
<P>
"There are just a lot of values that a football program at a junior college can 
instill in the young people that come here that are to me more important than 
blocking, tackling and W's," James said. "I just noticed in the six months I 
worked with these kids that they're like sponges. They're struggling for that." 
</P>
<P>
Words like accountability, organization and discipline are James mantras. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, every talk we've had has been related to the future, to life in 
general," said Kasha Clemons, a sophomore strong safety from Santa Clara High. 
"He stresses there is more to life than football." 
</P>
<P>
Make no mistake, James isn't talking about building the kind of character that 
comes from 2-8 seasons. He won two Western State Conference co-championships in 
his first stint at Ventura and has never been fired as a coach. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're going up the ladder, you always want to know what's above you on 
the next rung," James said. "When you have settled in at a particular place 
like I have and been above and have settled back down, there is just a feeling 
of confidence that I know we can be successful here." 
</P>
<P>
James' gaze is steadier than the Mona Lisa's, and his handshake is 
knuckle-numbingly firm. He means what he says. 
</P>
<P>
"Integrity," Ventura President Bob Long immediately replies when asked to name 
James' cardinal virtue. "As a person, he's got maximum integrity." 
</P>
<P>
The resumes of most longtime coaches list more schools than "The Insider's 
Guide to Colleges," but James' resume reveals stability. 
</P>
<P>
His career approximately divides into 10-year segments. During the 1960s, he 
completed his playing days at UC Davis and began working through the ranks as a 
college assistant coach. From 1967-69, James was the defensive coordinator for 
then-Ventura Coach Long. 
</P>
<P>
James coached Ventura the next 10 years and was at Stanford from 1980-88 as an 
assistant coach and recruiting coordinator. As the '90s begin, he once again is 
the coach at Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Having begun his career as a relatively young college head coach, James 
returns, at 49, as a relatively old coach beginning anew. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I'm a kid with a new toy that gets a chance to start over," James 
said. Being away "gave me new life, new spirit. . . . It was almost like going 
on sabbatical for eight years." 
</P>
<P>
James spent the last two seasons as Coach Phil Passno's assistant before taking 
over when Passno resigned in December after a 7-4 season. 
</P>
<P>
Although James has recruited athletes from outside his school's area in the 
past, he pledges that future versions of the James gang will be composed 
primarily of Ventura County products. For one thing, he believes a community 
college should serve its community first. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just going to be very, very selective in who I accept on our football 
team," James said. "I would rather put my energies in some athlete from 
Fillmore or Santa Paula or Channel Islands and his family . . . . than to spend 
all my time and the energy it takes to bring in one or two or three or four out 
of state." 
</P>
<P>
However, the complexion of junior college football in Ventura County changed 
during James' absence. Moorpark, long a patsy, has become a power on the field 
and in recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
The battle of Ventura County is being fought on the Oxnard plains, where 
Moorpark has managed to recruit schoolboy stars Freddie Bradley, Johnel Turner 
and Bryant Taylor out of Ventura's back yard in the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark Coach Jim Bittner believes his school's success will continue to 
attract top athletes, but he also knows James will present a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy is definitely an excellent recruiter and presents himself well, 
especially with parents," Bittner said. "He's very smooth." 
</P>
<P>
At Stanford, James was smooth enough to bridge the often gaping chasm between 
the academic and athletic communities. 
</P>
<P>
He could persuade Kenneth Arrow, a Nobel Prize winner in economics, as well as 
other prominent Stanford faculty members to have Sunday brunch with 17-year-old 
football recruits. He was able to draw top athletes through an admissions 
process so rigorous that former Coach Jack Elway called it "Russian roulette." 
</P>
<P>
James would open football recruiting receptions by introducing a dozen or more 
recruits -- and their parents -- naming the players' schools and positions 
flawlessly and without notes. 
</P>
<P>
"We will do very well here at this college recruiting, and I think a lot of it 
is the experience I gained at Stanford," James said. "I just think that with 
what we're trying to sell and the product we're trying to develop, we will 
begin to attract Ventura County athletes to this program. I have no question 
about that." 
</P>
<P>
James recruits parents as much as their kids. Stanford's 1987 recruiting class 
was ranked the 10th-best in the country by SuperPrep magazine, and helped draw 
several other strong groups to Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
"Dick James stands out in my mind as exemplary," said SuperPrep editor Allen 
Wallace, "because he cared more about the recruit than almost any other 
recruiting coordinator I met." 
</P>
<P>
Simply recruiting the athletes wasn't enough, though. In 1987, James approached 
Elway about moving back to the field. Elway, who believes the recruiting 
coordinator is the most important person on the staff, wanted James to remain 
in that capacity. A year later, Elway lost James to Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"He was so valuable to me. I probably should have done it (the switch) the year 
before and brought him back as an offensive line coach," Elway said. "I often 
look back on that as a move I should have made." 
</P>
<P>
Still, James' departure from the major college recruiting office he helped 
create to a junior college assistant's job appeared to be a retrograde move, 
the action of a coach moving back down the bell curve of his career. 
</P>
<P>
"I was, as recruiting coordinator, more the middle-management person," James 
said. "I made the decision that I wanted to get back on the field and work with 
young people." 
</P>
<P>
The milieu has changed somewhat for James, who returns Rip van Winkle-like to 
the junior college ranks. 
</P>
<P>
After years at pass-happy Stanford, James is shifting from the veer he used in 
the '70s to a more pass-oriented attack. 
</P>
<P>
"We will look like that (the veer) this year," said James, who concentrates on 
offense and the quarterbacks. "A lot of people will say, 'Gee, that looks like 
James football in the 70s,' but it will be dramatically different once the ball 
is snapped." 
</P>
<P>
James calls working with athletes the "sugar cube" that sweetens days full of 
administrative tasks, but on the field he isn't exactly all sweetness and 
light. He isn't a yeller, but he does get his point across. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just a perfectionist," said Tim Albrent, a sophomore quarterback from 
Ventura High. "He doesn't take excuses. He knows exactly what every player can 
give. He'll keep you out there until you do it right." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura baseball Coach Gary Anglin played quarterback on James' first team, in 
1970, and describes James as a George Allen-type coach. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good to have him back," Anglin said. "He does everything for the kids, 
but he has very distinct morals. They've got to go to class, and they've got to 
do it on the field."

<P>
Jay Howell will remember the sound for at least the rest of this baseball 
season, if not for the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
It went deeper than a cheer or a boo. The Dodger relief pitcher did not hear it 
in a large stadium, but in the darkness of his bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
Beeeeep. 
</P>
<P>
It was the high-pitched squeal of a monitor attached to the chest of his 
newborn daughter, Dana Christine. After being born five weeks premature Jan. 
31, she suffered from episodes of apnea, an irregularity in an infant's 
breathing that can cause Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
For two weeks, she remained in the hospital's intensive care unit. For the next 
four months, after rocking Dana to sleep, Howell and his wife, Alison, were 
forced to wrap her in wires. The wires were attached to a device that would 
wake her -- and them -- if she underwent respiratory failure. 
</P>
<P>
When she stopped breathing, the alarm went off. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a fire alarm," Howell said. "I'll never forget the way it sounded. 
It was so loud. We'd jump right up and run right over to her crib and, luckily, 
it was either a false alarm or she would always wake up and start breathing. 
</P>
<P>
"But I've never been so scared. We lived in a constant fear of losing her." 
</P>
<P>
As is the case with most infants who have been so afflicted, Dana Christine has 
outgrown the disorder. She breathes regularly. There are no more monitors, no 
more sleepless nights for her parents. 
</P>
<P>
But her father has been left with the memory of the sound -- and a lesson that 
can be applied on the baseball field. 
</P>
<P>
"I have learned, you do the best with what you can do," Howell said before this 
week's All-Star break. "And then you count your blessings." 
</P>
<P>
It is with this attitude that he and the Dodgers hope he can survive -- even 
prosper -- during the second half of what so far has been the worst season of 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
Entering tonight's game against the Chicago Cubs here, Howell is 3-4 with a 
3.14 earned-run average and only four saves in nine opportunities. Opponents 
are batting .287 against him, the second-highest average against a Dodger 
pitcher with more than two appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, when Howell accumulated a Dodger-record 28 saves, he had an 0.78 ERA 
at the All-Star break with 15 saves in 17 opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
The difference can be found in more than just his fastball and curveball. . . . 
It can be found in his left knee and in his right shoulder and in a competitive 
heart that serves him well when he is sound, but is a curse when he is hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Howell spent part of the first half on the disabled list and part of it on the 
mound, blowing games in the late innings when he could barely lift his arm or 
leg. 
</P>
<P>
He also spent part of it in an emotional meeting in Manager Tom Lasorda's 
office, wondering if the Dodgers weren't to blame for his problems -- at the 
same time blaming himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, until recently, Jay was pitching at 70%," fellow reliever Tim Crews 
said. "Anybody who watched him closely could tell that. He tried to pitch with 
pain and it didn't work, and it is really unfair to compare him to the last 
couple of years here." 
</P>
<P>
But mention the word unfair to Howell and he shrugs. At 34, in his 11th major 
league season, he knows that the word fair cannot be applied to baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Howell refuses to admit to the existence of viable excuses. Upon review of his 
first half, he has decided that he stunk. 
</P>
<P>
"Please, do not make any excuses for me," he said. "So things have been tough 
for me. It is easy to pitch when things are going good. Anybody can pitch then. 
</P>
<P>
"When things are going tough, you find out what kind of person you are. And I 
have not been productive. Simple as that. I have not done the job." 
</P>
<P>
Lately that has changed. He has allowed a run in only one of his last seven 
appearances. Observers say his shoulder appears to be fine, and his knee is 
nearly recovered. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you will see a huge difference in the second half," Crews said. "You 
can see that he is becoming his old self again, throwing the heck out of the 
ball again." 
</P>
<P>
But the process will be slow. Admittedly, Howell is returning from the deep. 
</P>
<P>
"And it takes a lot to come out of the water," said Howell, who believes his 
shoulder is fine and who hopes to begin running on the knee soon. "It takes 
something to keep fighting when people have lost confidence in you." 
</P>
<P>
Howell's competitive nature is probably up to the fight. It's what put him in 
this jam, which began during spring training, when nobody is supposed to be 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
In the final days of the shortened training camp at Vero Beach, Fla., Howell 
pitched one inning against the Atlanta Braves and struck out the side. He might 
as well have shot himself in the arm. 
</P>
<P>
His shoulder became stiff and he was unavailable for the first six days of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I overthrew. I knew it was wrong. . . . But when I am out there 
competing, spring or not, I try to get the guys out," Howell said. "I forget 
about everything else." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he was trying to forget about pain in his left knee. Howell 
admitted that he took a cortisone shot in the knee during spring training, 
hoping that there was no problem. 
</P>
<P>
On April 21 against Houston at Dodger Stadium, pitching on a knee that was 
swollen and aching, he allowed two runs in the ninth inning to turn a 5-4 lead 
into a 6-5 loss. 
</P>
<P>
He took the blame and didn't mention the knee. Three days later, he underwent 
arthroscopic surgery to repair a partial cartilage tear caused by years of 
pitching. He was placed on the disabled list but promised to hurry back. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, he did. 
</P>
<P>
On May 18, capping a remarkable rehabilitation, he pitched two scoreless 
innings against Philadelphia for a save in his first appearance since the 
surgery and pronounced himself fit. 
</P>
<P>
The next night, when the Dodgers ran out of pitchers in an 11-inning game 
against Philadelphia, he allowed three runs in two innings with his shoulder 
still weak from his month of inactivity. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, his shoulder had not recovered from this rush job. 
</P>
<P>
"The smart thing to do would have been to tell them no, I could not pitch that 
second night against Philly," Howell said. "But what were they going to do, put 
Eddie Murray on the mound? They didn't have anybody else. And you know, I 
almost scuffled through it -- almost." 
</P>
<P>
Howell says that he should have taken more time with the knee rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I wanted to hurry back; I think I was missed, and I hate not playing," 
Howell said. "I gave in to the part of me that loves to compete. Maybe I should 
have gone slower because the bottom line was, I didn't give myself a chance to 
get sharp. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever happened, it was my fault. I should have stopped it." 
</P>
<P>
On May 23 in Chicago, he did stop it. After pitching two-thirds of an inning in 
a save situation, he walked off the field before finishing the game. He said 
his shoulder was still stiff. 
</P>
<P>
The restraint worked for five days. On a rainy afternoon in Pittsburgh on May 
28, he pitched off a slippery mound in the ninth inning with two out and 
runners on first and second and the Dodgers leading, 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
He walked Don Slaught, then gave up a two-run, game-winning single to Jose Lind 
in the Dodgers' most crushing loss of the first half. They had entered the 
ninth with a 5-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Howell requested an audience with Lasorda. In the emotional 
session, Howell said that he and his rehabilitation needed to be treated with 
more consideration. 
</P>
<P>
He told Lasorda that the club shouldn't take advantage of his competitiveness 
by asking him to pitch in games where the conditions are not right for a 
pitcher with a sore shoulder and a still-puffy knee. As Howell recently 
admitted, he placed some of the blame for his situation on the club. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt then that I had to say something," Howell said. "I could not keep 
coming into games in ninth-inning situations while my arm was not ready. Of 
course, I was mad at them. It was only natural. I thought they were taking 
advantage of me." 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda said his response was simple: "I told Jay I would never, ever put a 
pitcher in a game if he wasn't healthy. I told him we needed for him to make 
sure we knew that he wasn't healthy." 
</P>
<P>
In 13 appearances since their discussion, not all in pressure situations, 
Howell is 2-1 with four saves. He has allowed only five runs in 20 innings for 
a 2.25 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I have it all in perspective," Howell said. "Instead of asking them, 'What 
are you doing to me?' I should have been saying, 'What am I doing to myself?' I 
know that I have to call the shots, I have to take responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Said Crews: "I think he knows that two wrongs don't make a right. Sure, the 
ballclub should have known he was hurting. But he also should have known he was 
hurting." 
</P>
<P>
Howell has learned all about hurting this season. He hopes in the second half 
he can use this knowledge to rediscover baseball happiness. 
</P>
<P>
"My little girl, she's awesome," he said. "And I've been given a pretty good 
opportunity to turn things around myself."

TIMMONS PARLAYS NET SUCCESS INTO GOLD-MEDAL PROMINENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It's shortly past 5 a.m. at Irish Spud Murphy's boxing gym in San Diego, and 
the man who "grew up on the mean streets of Newport Beach" slammed his locker 
shut, strolled across the hardwood floor and began punching the speed bag. 
</P>
<P>
And now, weighing in at a trim 205 pounds, Steve Timmons, a two-time Olympic 
gold medal winner . . . in volleyball? 
</P>
<P>
What's this? Timmons, a middle blocker-turned-brawler? He's really pounding the 
leather instead of killing it? 
</P>
<P>
Well, not quite. 
</P>
<P>
Timmons, who will be inducted into the Orange County Sports Hall of Fame next 
Thursday, had some time on his hands last summer after he and Karch Kiraly, 
tired of world travel, left the U.S. national volleyball team. 
</P>
<P>
While playing part time on the beach circuit, he and some pals at a regional 
sports network taped a tongue-in-cheek video about his obsession with fighting 
Mike Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
The video aired more than nine months ago, but Timmons, 31, still gets jabbed 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I was down on the beach the other day and this guy walks by and says, 'Hey, 
kick Tyson's (butt)' " Timmons said. "He really thought I was going to fight 
him." 
</P>
<P>
But Timmons, a muscular 6-foot-5, does look like a boxer. His red hair is 
shaved at the temples and moussed into a new-wave, Marine-style cut, similar to 
the one worn by boxer Drago in "Rocky IV." 
</P>
<P>
Timmons, though, is the first to admit that he wasn't The Greatest in the ring. 
If Muhammad Ali floated like a butterfly and stung like a bee, then Timmons 
floated like an anchor and stung like a moth. 
</P>
<P>
The video is a convincing one, complete with interviews with boxer Henry 
Tillman ("He takes a hell of a shot. I never knew volleyball guys were that 
tough . . . ") and promoter-manager Dan Goosen ("He's the fastest heavyweight 
I've seen since Muhammad Ali"). 
</P>
<P>
There was even an interview with the challenger himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Announcer: Who are you going to fight, Steve? Someone from the bum of the 
month club? 
</P>
<P>
 Pugilist: (glaring into camera) I want to kick all those football players' 
butts who say they can beat Mike Tyson. I'll start with (Tony) Mandarich and 
then I'll go on to (Mark) Gastineau. All those overpaid, overweight football 
players; I want them all. They'll all go down. 
</P>
<P>
 He never landed a punch or was pulled off the canvas, but Timmons, the former 
floppy-haired basketball standout at Newport Harbor High School, has endured 
more than a poke to the chin. 
</P>
<P>
He has taken on the underdog role, a serious knee injury, a fledgling business 
and the best volleyball players in the world. 
</P>
<P>
And he's still standing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STEVE TIMMONS: THE WONDER YEARS 
</P>
<P>
Volleyball wasn't Timmons' first sport, nor his second. He played flag 
football, swam and surfed, but his best moves were on the basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
"My heroes were Pete Maravich, Jerry West and Wilt Chamberlain," Timmons said. 
"I always wanted to be like them and I wanted to play in the NBA." 
</P>
<P>
Timmons lived in Riverside until the sixth grade, then moved to Newport Beach 
with parents Dennis and Holly, brother Kevin and sisters Heidi and Jill. 
</P>
<P>
Timmons played basketball during his four years at Newport Harbor. At the end 
of his junior season, he was coerced into trying out for volleyball by Charlie 
Brande, who was coaching the Sailors' junior varsity at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"He was watching volleyball practice one day and he saw those guys diving on 
the floor and he said, 'I don't want to dive,' " said Brande, now the Corona 
del Mar coach. "He saw them passing (bumping) the ball and he said, 'I don't 
want to pass.' I told him, you'll never have to dive or pass the ball, just 
block and hit it." 
</P>
<P>
The sport wasn't quite that simple, as Timmons quickly learned. 
</P>
<P>
"I really knew nothing about it," he said. "Some of the other players didn't 
like me coming out that late because they had been training for a while. I 
played and had fun, but I really didn't take it that seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Said Brande: "Steve was always joking around. But once the scoreboard lit up, 
he was all business. He picked up the sport very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Between his junior and senior years, Timmons grew . . . and grew . . . and 
grew. He sprouted from a thin 5-11 to a gangly 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Timmons says his growth spurt and a bad fall during a basketball game gave him 
tendinitis in his right knee. After graduation, he took a year off from 
volleyball and began a construction job at a custom-home site in Big Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"After a couple of months I realized I didn't want this in my future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Timmons quit his job and spent the next few months surfing and bodyboarding. In 
the fall of 1978, he enrolled at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
He helped Orange Coast win the state community college basketball title in his 
first and only season at the school. The volleyball team finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Near the end of Timmons' freshman year, then-USC Coach Ernie Hix offered him a 
volleyball scholarship. Timmons was quick to accept. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego State was the only other school interested besides a half-hearted 
letter from Boise State to play basketball," Timmons said. "I was ready to move 
out of Newport and move on with my life. I took a chance with volleyball." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STEVE TIMMONS MEETS JAMES McDONALD 
</P>
<P>
Timmons joined a college team that many consider the best ever. The Trojans won 
the NCAA championship in Timmons' first season with a lineup that included Pat 
Powers, Tim Hovland and Dusty Dvorak, a former Laguna Beach High standout who 
also played on the 1984 Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
"There weren't any big names I knew in volleyball when I first came to USC," 
Timmons said. "I never knew a national team existed. I didn't know about the 
pro leagues. My main goal was just to get into a good school like USC." 
</P>
<P>
Drawing on his success at Newport Harbor and Orange Coast, Timmons tried out 
for the Trojan basketball team after his sophomore year. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured I could help USC turn it around in basketball," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His goal was short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
During a practice, James McDonald, who later played tight end for the Rams, 
drove to the basket on Timmons, who was set to take a charge. McDonald hit 
Timmons. Timmons hit the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt the pain run down my legs," Timmons said. "I fractured a vertebra. I 
took some time off and got some rest." 
</P>
<P>
And put to rest his basketball career. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STEVE TIMMONS CHASES A GOAL 
</P>
<P>
Back on the volleyball court, Timmons earned All-American honors his junior 
year. After the season, Doug Beal, then coach of the U.S. national team, 
invited Timmons to try out for the squad. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team was a doormat on the international scene when Timmons joined in 
1981. Funding was scarce. Some players lived out of their cars, slept on the 
beach and pieced together a life on a $10-a-day meal allotment. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a fun summer," Timmons said. "After practices, we would go down to 
the beach and jump in the water with our uniforms on to wash them. I had a 
sandwich and a drink and that was pretty much our $10 for the day. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked forward to the trips just so we could have a bed and three meals a 
day. You have no other responsibilities; you're in college or just out of 
college." 
</P>
<P>
During that summer, Timmons shared an apartment with Kiraly. They became 
friends, and together they would become two of the most dominant players in the 
world in the next eight years. 
</P>
<P>
"They were a good combination," said U.S. Olympic Coach Bill Neville, who was 
an assistant coach when Timmons played. "Karch was fabulously focused, and he 
was a role model for Timmons. I think they filled each other out." 
</P>
<P>
Kiraly was a soft-spoken biology/pre-med major from UCLA. Timmons, a Trojan, 
was rowdy and looking for a good time. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, our friendship came out of respect for our ability," Timmons said. 
"Karch was a very serious guy and I was always the jokester. I loosened him up 
and he educated me." 
</P>
<P>
Timmons and Kiraly trained full time with the national team after finishing 
college. But while Kiraly excelled, Timmons was struggling to earn a spot on 
the roster. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first saw Timmons, he was just a big gangly kid," Neville said. "He was 
very raw and was under a lot of peer pressure. He came in with proven players 
from his alma mater. But I took to him right away. I saw he had that deep fire 
in him. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to become great, I knew someone had to ride him hard, and that was 
me. You've heard of the concept 'Tough Love'? I had to work him real hard." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Neville's tutoring, Timmons still had much to learn. 
</P>
<P>
He was called into the coaches' office one day and was told he wouldn't be 
traveling with the team to Argentina. He echoed his disappointment as he and 
Kiraly walked across the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"When we got to (Kiraly's) car, it had been broken into and all our belongings 
had been stolen," Timmons said. "I thought, 'How much lower can I get?' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STEVE TIMMONS GOES TO HAVANA 
</P>
<P>
Of all places for Timmons to play the match of his life, it had to be Havana, 
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
The fans were hostile, the conditions sub-par and the locker room musty. But 
filling in for an injured Craig Buck, Timmons played so well against the Cuban 
national team in February, 1984, that he knew he had made the U.S. roster. 
</P>
<P>
"I can still remember going into that dank locker room knowing I had made it," 
Timmons said. "I couldn't sleep at night during that tour because I was so 
excited about playing the next day. I was pumped the whole time. Something 
happened to me in that tour. It was really weird." 
</P>
<P>
Five months later, he earned most valuable player honors while leading the 
United States to the gold medal. It marked a turnaround not only for Timmons, 
but the entire U.S. program. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a totally different feeling than (winning) in 1988," Timmons said. "It 
was like climbing up a mountain without your shirt on. You got the chills and 
goose pimples after the match." 
</P>
<P>
The climb got steeper three months after the Olympics, when Timmons blew out 
his right knee in a match in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
"I went down to dig the ball and it felt like someone hit it with a hammer," 
Timmons said. "I looked down and it looked like my kneecap split in two." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors operated on the knee, repairing tendon damage. They gave Timmons no 
guarantee he would play again. 
</P>
<P>
While recovering at his parents' house, Timmons passed the time by scribbling 
down marketing ideas for an optic yellow volleyball and a line of beachwear. 
Those ideas became a reality when a Vista-based firm, using an outline of 
Timmons' head as its logo, began marketing the products in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to have something to look forward to after my volleyball career," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Timmons wasn't ready to retire. Seven months after the injury, he was back 
on the court and the U.S. team was winning every major tournament. 
</P>
<P>
At the 1988 Olympics, on the same court where he injured his knee, Timmons led 
the U.S. squad in kills (188) and blocks (43). He had 38 kills in seven blocks 
in the gold-medal victory over the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"We started to feel the pressure right around the Olympics," he said. "But 
every victory we had convinced everyone that we were the best." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STEVE TIMMONS MAKES A CURTAIN CALL 
</P>
<P>
Tired of the constant travel, Timmons and Kiraly left the national team last 
summer for the pro beach tour. 
</P>
<P>
"For nine years Karch and I traveled and sacrificed our life style," Timmons 
said. "We had some time off after the 1988 Games and we realized what we were 
missing." 
</P>
<P>
In February, Timmons married Jeannie Buss, president of the Forum's volleyball 
and tennis association and daughter of Lakers owner Jerry Buss. They've settled 
into a house in Manhattan Beach, but Timmons will be back on the road soon. 
</P>
<P>
In the fall, Kiraly and Timmons will be off to play pro indoor volleyball in 
Italy. Timmons signed a two-year deal worth more than $1 million with a team in 
Ravenna. 
</P>
<P>
And he still hasn't ruled out playing in the 1992 Olympics at Barcelona. He 
said there's a strong possibility that he and Kiraly could reunite with Buck 
and Dvorak for a shot at a third gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
Neville said he would welcome them with open arms. 
</P>
<P>
"Steve has overcome a lot of adversity and he always comes back stronger," 
Neville said. "I need some role models for the younger players, and he's 
definitely one. He's the kind of guy who keeps coming up off the canvas. That's 
why he's a champion." 
</P>
