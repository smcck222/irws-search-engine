REDISTRICTING: A MAGISTRATE BARS THE CITY COUNCIL FROM ACTING TO ADOPT A PLAN

<P>
Throwing a redistricting plan into legal and political disarray, a federal 
magistrate Thursday delayed San Diego City Council action on the proposal and 
threatened further court intervention unless the council reverses itself. 
</P>
<P>
In a two-page order issued late Thursday, U.S. Magistrate Harry McCue barred 
the council from proceeding next week, as scheduled, toward formal adoption of 
a redistricting plan that has been sharply attacked by Latino activists, some 
community leaders and others since the council tentatively passed it Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond prohibiting the council from acting on any redistricting plan until July 
23, McCue's order also bluntly warns of further court action unless the council 
approves an alternative proposal that Latino leaders argue better protects 
minority voting rights. 
</P>
<P>
McCue's ruling, which concluded a third consecutive day of frenzied maneuvering 
in the case, shifts the focus in the political-legal contretemps back to City 
Hall, where the council now faces a grim choice: Either approve a redistricting 
plan that, as Monday's action made clear, is opposed by a majority of the 
members, or return to court for a potentially lengthy, costly battle that could 
end with the city's plan being declared unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's developments brought the principals in the bitter redistricting 
dispute -- the outgrowth of a 1988 San Diego County Chicano Federation lawsuit 
challenging the legality of the city's electoral system -- to a precipice that 
all had hoped to avoid, and, in the process, raised as many questions as it 
answered. 
</P>
<P>
Some council members questioned whether McCue's order, as a practical matter, 
curtails their prerogative to alter the redistricting plan proposed, in 
accordance with the terms of the lawsuit's preliminary settlement, by a 
citizen's advisory board. Dissatisfaction with that plan, which some argue was 
tilted toward pro-growth Republicans, led to the evolution of the other 
proposal that was tentatively passed, 5 to 4, by the council Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Would even minor changes to the advisory board's map to accommodate two members 
whose new or future homes are outside their districts' proposed new boundaries 
subject the council to a court challenge? And, if Monday's council majority is 
willing to engage in brinkmanship, what is to stop it from simply repeating its 
initial decision on or after July 23? 
</P>
<P>
"Who knows?" Chicano Federation attorney Patricia Meyer asked rhetorically. 
"The only thing certain is that, if the council approves any map other than the 
one from the (advisory board), then we're going to wind up back in court." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than view McCue's order as a threat, some council members -- notably, 
those on the losing side of Monday's vote -- characterized it as an opportunity 
to reevaluate a critical decision made in what even some supporters conceded 
was an unorthodox, clumsy fashion that embittered many. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives a council that stepped out and did something stupid a chance to 
rectify it," said Councilman Ron Roberts, who voted against the plan proposed 
Monday by Councilman John Hartley. "It sounds like the judge is sending us a 
signal: 'Guys, work this out and save yourselves some big problems.' " 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bob Filner, whom many regard as the primary behind-the-scenes 
architect of the plan passed Monday, did not return telephone calls Thursday. 
None of the four other council members who support that redistricting map -- 
Abbe Wolfsheimer, John Hartley, Wes Pratt and Linda Bernhardt -- could be 
reached Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Under McCue's order, the council will reconsider both the advisory board's plan 
and the one tentatively approved Monday. Furthermore, if the council adopts any 
plan other than that proposed by the citizens' task force, the court will 
review it to determine whether it violates an earlier settlement in the case. 
</P>
<P>
"This court is of the opinion that the issues raised by this action are of 
grave importance to the city of San Diego and its citizens as a whole," McCue 
wrote. "Should the council adopt a plan other than the (advisory board) plan, 
this court shall review the record to determine if that plan is in conformity 
with the settlement agreement." 
</P>
<P>
In its review of both plans, McCue ordered the council to give both "de novo 
consideration," a legal term meaning, as Meyer explained, "to start anew." 
</P>
<P>
"We're starting fresh, from scratch -- or at least as much as possible," Meyer 
said. "Obviously, I'm very pleased, because the court is saying, 'Let's look at 
this one more time.' " 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth So, a deputy city attorney, was less voluble upon leaving McCue's 
chambers, saying simply that he had "repeated our objections" that court 
intervention at this point was improper because the redistricting plan had not 
yet won final council approval. 
</P>
<P>
In its legal arguments, the Chicano Federation has raised objections of both 
style and substance to Monday's redistricting plan, faulting how the council 
acted on it almost as much as the plan's content -- in particular, its dilution 
of the Latino population in the 8th District. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement settling the first phase of the group's 1988 lawsuit, the 
city guaranteed that the Chicano Federation and other minority community 
representatives would have a meaningful role in the development of this year's 
redistricting plan. However, by rejecting the advisory board's map, developed 
over months of public hearings and substituting Hartley's proposal -- only 
hours after it was publicized -- the city displayed "bad faith" and violated 
the settlement, attorney Meyer argues. 
</P>
<P>
Hartley's plan reduces the Latino composition of Filner's 8th District from the 
advisory board's proposed 52.2% to at most 51% -- and perhaps, Meyer says, to 
as low as 45% -- and dramatically alters the configuration of a number of other 
districts. Based on the estimates of some City Hall insiders, the plan would 
change council representation for up to 300,000 San Diegans. 
</P>
<P>
Stressing legislative, if not political, technicalities, city attorneys 
emphasized that Monday's vote was not definitive, noting that it was only the 
first of several steps toward the redistricting plan's adoption. The Chicano 
Federation and others, they argued, would have ample opportunity to comment on 
the plan -- and try to alter it more to their liking -- before it was formally 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer, however, characterized the remaining legislative steps as "more a matter 
of form than content," and Tuesday asked U.S. District Judge John Rhoades to 
block the council from enacting Monday's plan. In response, city attorneys 
argued that it would be premature for the judge to consider such a request 
until the plan was formally adopted. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking to circumvent that procedural impasse, Rhoades tried to turn back the 
clock Thursday by suggesting that the San Diego City Council nullify Monday's 
tentative approval and repeat its debate on the redistricting plan next week. 
In essence, Rhoades' suggestion asked both the council and the Chicano 
Federation to act as if Monday's vote never occurred, thereby allowing more 
time for public comment. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if it's possible to go back and rewrite history, especially if 
people's minds are already made up," Meyer responded skeptically. 
</P>
<P>
Timing provided another knotty obstacle to Rhoades' suggestion. Assistant City 
Atty. Curtis Fitzpatrick, noting that 24 hours' advance notice is required for 
any special council meeting, questioned whether the council could even be 
assembled to consider retracting Monday's action before a planned Friday court 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with that riddle, Rhoades sent the two sides to McCue for mediation. 
After separate morning and afternoon sessions, McCue issued his order, which 
also canceled several previously planned court hearings and scheduled a July 24 
status conference. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the critical question now becomes whether any of the five council 
members who supported Hartley's plan changes his vote on July 23 to avert a 
showdown, or whether that majority remains intact. Though concerned about the 
latter possibility, Chicano Federation executive Jess Haro said after 
Thursday's court action that he believes growing public pressure may prompt a 
council retreat from Monday's action. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives them two weeks to reflect on the action they took," Haro said. "I 
think that might change some minds."

Cold War Fallout: Mikhail Gorbachev's support may be melting somewhat in his 
homeland, but here in Los Angeles, it appears to be as solid as ice. 
</P>
<P>
Baskin-Robbins officials Thursday unveiled what they billed as "the world's 
largest ice cream bust of the architect of glasnost." 
</P>
<P>
The 4-foot-by-2 1/2-foot sculpture, carved for three days by downtown Biltmore 
Hotel chefs, was fashioned out of chocolate ice cream with white chocolate 
chunks. Chocolate fudge was employed for Gorbachev's distinctive forehead 
birthmark. 
</P>
<P>
The ice cream company listed three reasons for commissioning the 
860,000-calorie bust: to salute the Soviet leader for "thawing icy relations 
between East and West," to commemorate national Ice Cream Day on Sunday, and, 
surprise, surprise, to promote its flavor of the month, Gorba-chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Pacific Palisades, Gorbachev's former partner in summitry, Ronald 
Reagan, participated in a lunchtime songfest with 70 youngsters at the Camp 
Ronald McDonald for Good Times. Reagan is a longtime supporter of the camp, 
which provides overnight recreational opportunities for children with cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Clapping his hands, the ex-President joined in on upbeat versions of "This Camp 
is Your Camp" and "Shugey, Shugey." 
</P>
<P>
Appearing with the ex-President was his wife, Nancy, who also had sent a letter 
of support to the sponsors of the Gorbachev press conference, where 70 young 
members of local "Just Say No" clubs were invited to taste a chunk of the 
Soviet President's neck. 
</P>
<P>
"The love for ice cream is shared by all nations," wrote the former First Lady. 
"It is a contagious feeling, and it is a wonderful alternative to drug and 
alcohol use. So the next time someone offers you something bad, suggest that 
you go have some ice cream and fun instead." 
</P>
<P>
E x-Mayor Sam Yorty raised hackles this month with his latest harangue against 
his five-term successor. 
</P>
<P>
Interviewed in Los Angeles magazine, Yorty said that Tom Bradley "didn't . . . 
do a damn thing" to bring the Olympics to Los Angeles. Yorty also boasted about 
his own ability to deal with two of the city's major problems -- gangs and 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have handled all that," Yorty harrumphed. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Yorty's track record as a prognosticator is spotty. The following 
predictions for the 1990s are taken from his 1966 biography, "Maverick Mayor": 
</P>
<P>
"Smog will be gone in Los Angeles in that happy day of the future . . . paved 
streets will be unnecessary . . . flying autos (will carry) suburbanites to 
subdivisions designed especially for 'the air set.' " 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the Los Angeles Herald Examiner could have stayed in business if it had 
only been able to hawk its final edition for the same price that collectors are 
seeking to sell it for now. An ad in Sunday's Times classified section sought 
$400 for a copy of the Nov. 2, 1989, newspaper, which had a list price of a 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
If the Herald had only been able to sell 200,000 copies at that price, it would 
have raked in $80 million.

LITHUANIA SUSPENDS ITS INDEPENDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article merely points out that Lithuania is ready to accept the fact that 
without strong American and European political and economic support Lithuania 
is doomed to bleed into economic collapse. 
</P>
<P>
But there's no victory for Gorbachev in this affair, for within a year 
Gorbachev will not be able to enforce any agreements with the republics of the 
Soviet Union because of his diminishing political stature. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is simple -- the Russian Empire is crumbling and no Gorbachev 
and no Bush can save it. For Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are fortunate enough 
to possess qualities which guarantee victory -- intelligence (vision revelance, 
acceptance of reality) -- and emotional intensity (love for freedom and 
independence).

YOU OWE PEOPLE A BUDGET SOON; 
</P>
<P>
* SACRAMENTO: JUST DO YOUR JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Never let it be said that California legislators are at a loss for words to 
explain their needless deadlock on the state budget. 
</P>
<P>
"They left us with a bag of dog doo on our doorstep, lit it on fire, rang the 
doorbell and ran away," one Republican assemblyman told a reporter. Speaker 
Willie Brown, a Democrat, quipped back: "And we will not take it out of the 
bag. We will simply return it to its owners in its original form." 
</P>
<P>
What a pair of cards. But while they exchange their odd witticisms, people who 
are among the poorest, the sickest, the most defenseless of the state's 
residents suffer as they wait for the state tax dollar to trickle down. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County USC Medical Center is one example of how the lack of 
definitive action hurts. The hospital is the linchpin in the county's public 
health system. Poor and uninsured women in labor often line the hallways, flat 
on their backs waiting for overworked nurses and doctors to help them. The ones 
on gurneys are the lucky ones. Some just get hard chairs. 
</P>
<P>
County USC hospital has now been placed on conditional accreditation by the 
nation's major hospital review organization, the Joint Commission on the 
Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations. Conditional accreditation means that 
the hospital is, in effect, on probation until it improves its quality of care 
and safety. 
</P>
<P>
The county hospital is not the only hospital to receive such a sanction and its 
problems are not limited to obstetric overload, although County USC delivers 
one out of every 200 infants born in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Its fall from grace with national reviewers was the shameful legacy of years of 
severe cutbacks in state and county budgets. And now, due to the Legislature's 
inability to resolve this year's budget, home-care workers, doctors and others 
who tend the poor under the state Medi-Cal program are not getting paid. And 
lest anybody think that all this is someone else's problem, think again. 
Untreated communicable diseases know no income lines. 
</P>
<P>
The courts provide another example of how squabbling in Sacramento translates 
to real problems. The $50-billion Senate version of the state budget -- which, 
by the way, the Assembly has thrown out, to start all over again -- cut trial 
court grants, money used to actually run the courts. Few items in the budget 
are likely to be spared the paring knife. But not knowing what the final budget 
will be precludes planning for a grossly overcrowded court system, where civil 
cases already take five years to go to trial and criminal caseloads have 
increased 151% in the last nine years. 
</P>
<P>
So, we reiterate: The key to the budget this year is a reasonable mix of 
additional revenue and additional cuts. One relatively painless way to raise 
more money is to suspend the state tax indexing for inflation for a year. 
Sacramento should cut the quips. This is serious.

LITHUANIA SUSPENDS ITS INDEPENDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is sad news to read ("Lithuanians Give In, Agree to Moratorium," Part A, 
June 30), that the Lithuanians had to give in to Mikhail Gorbachev's demands to 
suspend their declaration of independence. It is noteworthy that the moratorium 
was passed almost exactly by the minimum required of the two-thirds majority 
vote, versus the 95% vote by the same body when restoration of independence was 
declared. 
</P>
<P>
I am certain that this would not have happened if this Soviet-occupied nation 
had any hopes for support and recognition of its independence from Western 
democracies. Instead of that Lithuania received only sympathy and evasive 
gestures. 
</P>
<P>
This free neutral nation, along with Estonia and Latvia, was occupied in 1940 
by the Soviets as a direct result of the secret agreement between Hitler and 
Stalin. Now it is being sold out again to Gorbachev by President Bush, West 
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand. Did 
anything really change in the last 50 years?

GEOGRAPHY LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sometime during a previous spasm of educational reform, geography as a separate 
subject largely dropped out of the curriculum. The results show. 
</P>
<P>
A nine-nation survey commissioned by the National Geographic Society two years 
ago discovered that most Americans were staggeringly unaware of what the world 
they live in looks like; one in seven couldn't even locate the United States on 
a blank map. David Smith, who teaches seventh-graders in Cambridge, Mass., is 
trying to do something to fill this void of ignorance. And as Time magazine 
recently reported, he's doing very well indeed. 
</P>
<P>
There's nothing new about Smith's methods. In two hours of class work and two 
hours of homework each week, he has his kids learn about continents, oceans, 
countries, rivers, mountains and capitals the old-fashioned way. They draw 
maps, over and over again. They memorize, they use mnemonics. After nine months 
the kids can draw the world with up to 150 countries correctly located and 
labeled. 
</P>
<P>
What have they learned? They have absorbed some basic information that will be 
useful to them for the rest of their lives. They have taken a big step toward 
understanding international economics and the physical and cultural diversity 
of the planet. Smith's methods, heavy on rote learning, aren't in vogue. What 
he is showing is that they can still be valid, still effective, still able to 
stimulate young minds to think. And that, of course, is what teaching is about.

DEAR HOT: To avoid a wild mix of tan lines, I stick with the same bathing suit 
day in, day out. Are there any new swimwear accessories, preferably on the 
inexpensive side, that I can add to keep from boring myself and my friends? -- 
A.L., Santa Monica 
</P>
<P>
DEAR A.L.: Though we prefer the ultra-pasty, mega-sun-blocked look ourselves, 
you might want to pick up some Zinka Glitter Dark Tanning Oil, a new SPF 2 
product that contains glitter (turquoise or gold) and sells for $6.98. 
</P>
<P>
As you may recall, the Zinka folks are to sunbathing gear what Ted Turner is to 
the movies. They colored zinc oxide in 1986, launching a war-paint look on 
beaches throughout the land. 
</P>
<P>
(White zinc oxide has traditionally been used by sun worshipers to protect 
especially sensitive areas such as noses. Zinka Nose Coat, the colorful 
alternative, is still available and comes in neon pink, neon green, neon 
orange, green/blue, turquoise or white at $4.99 a tube.) 
</P>
<P>
The firm that's dedicated to making sunbathing more fun has another new product 
this year: Zinka Sand-Free Oil ($8.59), an SPF 2 tanning oil so light in weight 
that sand supposedly doesn't stick to it. 
</P>
<P>
The glitter oil is carried at Miller's Outpost stores. Look for other Zinka 
products at drugstores, surf shops and bikini boutiques. If you have trouble 
locating them, you can call Zinka at (800) 435-6622. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HOT: I think I was born in the wrong era. I love Victorian anything -- 
lace collars, gloves, delicate pins and earrings. I'm an ardent reader of 
Victoria magazine, but I'm frustrated because I can't seem to find the things 
it features. I occasionally spot a few things at a thrift store, but I need 
more to truly get my fix. Any ideas? -- B.Y., Long Beach 
</P>
<P>
DEAR B.Y.: Before you rent "Somewhere in Time" from the video store once more 
and drool over Jane Seymour's costumes, take heart -- there is hope. We are 
aware that Victoria magazine has caused quite a run on Victoriana since its 
1988 debut. 
</P>
<P>
Your desire for those lacy, frilly, traditionally feminine things can be 
satisfied at a few stores around Los Angeles, including Lavender &amp; Lace, 
656 N. Larchmont Blvd. The store features floor-to-ceiling selections of 
Victorian jewelry, hats, gloves, boxes stuffed with lace pieces, lace collars 
and cuffs, piles of curtains and bedspreads, plus pottery, luggage and other 
items. Golyester, 1356 W. Washington Blvd., Venice, and 7957 Melrose Ave., West 
Hollywood, offers a good selection of vintage Victorian clothing such as 
camisoles, bloomers, skirts and blouses. 
</P>
<P>
And if you're looking for more updated Victorian styles, try Westminster Lace. 
The chain of boutiques (in Century City, Sherman Oaks' Fashion Square, Brea 
Mall, and South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa) sells new, romantic-style dresses, 
jackets and blouses, plus lace by the yard, children's clothes and accessories; 
enough to make any displaced Victorian woman happy. 
</P>
<P>
SHOPPERS ALERT: Designers continue to launch their own boutiques. Some recent 
openings include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- First Issue, a women's sportswear division of Liz Claiborne, featuring 
styles not carried in department stores, in South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Laura Ashley Home, featuring English traditional home furnishings and 
accessories in the spirit of Laura Ashley fashions, in South Coast Plaza, Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 -- BB1, carrying all-cotton, casual clothing for men and women from Ton Sur 
Ton, in the Beverly Center. 
</P>
<P>

EGALITARIAN STREET LIFE IS 1-SIZE-FITS-ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GAILE ROBINSON

<TEXT>
<P>
It was a moment of unparalleled excitement when at least some credit cards were 
fairly aquiver with meltdown anticipation the day that Street Life, funky 
little Manhattan store filled with private label merchandise, announced it was 
coming to town. Now that it is ensconced on Main Street in Santa Monica, West 
Coast fans of the shop can tell you the threat of financial ruin is just 
minutes away. 
</P>
<P>
This store is for the woman whose clothes are more likely to carry labels from 
Third World countries than from big-name European designers. Street Life 
doesn't ooze chic. The attraction is far more basic. Almost everything is 
priced less than $100. And with a truly egalitarian, one-size-fits-all system 
where one size really does seem to fit all, you can delude yourself by thinking 
you're buying a Size 8 even if you're closer to Size 18. 
</P>
<P>
The designers, Sheryl Lukonski and Leila Mae McDissi, specialize in easy basics 
done in a variety of fabrics and colors. The clothes are extremely spare, 
same-color buttons are the only ornamentation. In any given season the number 
of actual body styles will be limited -- about 60, all made of cotton/spandex 
in four colors, cotton interlock in at least three colors and a variety of 
seasonal novelty fabrics -- rayon or cotton prints, wool or corduroy. It sounds 
like a large line, but that's barely enough merchandise to fill a convenience 
store. 
</P>
<P>
The spring and summer collection (which dropped 30% in price on July 1 for a 
summer sale) has cotton interlock and cotton/spandex show-off-your-hard-body 
clothes -- bra tops, swing tops ($45) high-waisted tap shorts ($28), 
halter-neck unitards ($65) and minuscule skirts in a rainbow of colors. There 
are brilliantly colored rayon baby-doll dresses ($52) and full-legged jumpsuits 
($97) for those who are looking for more camouflage. The swimwear rack has, 
among others, '40s-style gold cire suits for $40, and two-piece suits with 
interchangeable tops and bottoms in leopard print, gold cire or black for $20 
to $25. 
</P>
<P>
The store personnel are invisible until called upon, then quite accommodating. 
The majority of the customers are local residents, leaning toward matrons and 
yuppie mom-and-daughter teams. The dressing rooms are Spartan and cramped but 
the parking is easy, the prices are reasonable, and everyone can wear a Size 8.

South African anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela has recovered sufficiently 
from a bout of mild pneumonia to address a rally in Nairobi, Kenya, an aide 
said. Mandela, 71, initially caught a cold as he neared the end of a grueling 
tour of three continents, and it grew worse in the chill of Addis Ababa, 
Ethiopia, 8,000 feet above sea level, where he attended a meeting of the 
Organization of African Unity this week. The deputy president of the African 
National Congress is to leave Kenya for Mozambique on Saturday for a two-day 
visit.

5,000 ACRES BURN NEAR STATE PARK

<TEXT>
<P>
A fast-moving brush fire burning out of control near Chino Hills State Park had 
blackened about 5,000 acres and forced the evacuation of the park. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the blaze was burning away from residential areas and no homes 
were in its path. A 15-year-old boy admitted to authorities that a bottle 
rocket he fired into the air sparked the fire when it landed, Orange County 
Fire Department spokeswoman Maria Sabol said. "He saw that it started a fire 
and he tried to put it out," Sabol said. "He received minor burns to his right 
leg. He did admit to starting the fire." The boy was released to his parents. 
Three inmate firefighters received minor burns, Sabol said.

Fire erupted on the top floor of a four-story 1889 convent near Dominican 
College, forcing the evacuation of 30 nuns from the Marin County landmark. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze quickly went to greater-alarm status and snarled traffic along U.S. 
101 near the college, a San Rafael Fire Department spokesman said, adding that 
about 100 firefighters from the city and 10 surrounding communities brought the 
blaze under control. Members of the Dominican Sisters of San Rafael fled safely 
from the convent, original home to the founding Sisters of the college, said 
Michelle Liapes, staff writer for the institution, who was watching the flames 
from a window. "It's a very beautiful building and a landmark in the Marin 
area."

PARK MISSION;

YOUNG DAY CAMPERS AIM TO RETAKE GROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Willie Jordan started a day camp for poor children, she did not settle for 
the obvious. 
</P>
<P>
Facing the expected worries about costs and logistics, the director of the Fred 
Jordan Mission came up with a campsite that met her needs. She chose one of the 
city's most trash-laden, crime-ridden, drug-infested areas -- MacArthur Park. 
</P>
<P>
"It's turned into such a dangerous park," said Jordan, 56, wife of the late 
founder of the mission, as her Kid Row Day Camp opened its third season this 
week. "Because it is not safe, that's exactly why we wanted to go there." 
</P>
<P>
Determined not to be intimidated by the crime and squalor that have overtaken 
the 32-acre urban park, Jordan and her campers return to the site each year to 
fulfill the day camp's pledge to "take back the parks for the children." 
</P>
<P>
"It's great that we are going there," she said. "The parks should be used by 
kids without them having to fear for their lives. We go right to where the kids 
live, and make it safe for a couple of hours." 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, volunteers from the mission distributed flyers around the park, 
inviting children living nearby to attend the camp, which runs until July 27. 
Each day at about 3:30 p.m., after year-round classes let out, children from a 
20-block area around the park gather for the camp near the corner of Park View 
and 6th Street. 
</P>
<P>
Other children are bused to the park from hotels on Skid Row, where the mission 
is located. 
</P>
<P>
Still others, like Teresa Chavez's six children -- who attended the camp during 
previous summers but have since moved away from their Westlake neighborhood 
near the park -- are driven in from more distant areas. The Chavez family now 
lives on 84th Street in South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I worried at first, because the park is kind of scary," Chavez, 32, 
said in Spanish. "But now, I know the children are all right. The people from 
the mission take care." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of heading for the mountains or some other bucolic setting, these 
campers remain in the city, joining in sing-alongs, party games and a show 
called, "Bible Boot Camp," run by a pastor wearing military-style camouflage 
clothing. 
</P>
<P>
One 11-year-old girl sat among the campers holding a Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Turtles coloring kit -- her prize for winning a camp game. The girl, who lives 
in a Skid Row hotel, said she was going to take the prize home. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to share it with my brother," she said. "He's always saying he 
doesn't ever get anything." 
</P>
<P>
The day campers have been sharing the park this summer with police horse and 
foot patrols. The stepped-up LAPD patrols in recent weeks are aimed at ridding 
MacArthur Park of drug dealers and unlicensed vendors. The crackdown, which 
began last month, is part of an effort to ferret out the ragged, violence-prone 
crowds that had taken over the park, contributing to a 43% increase in arrests 
in the area over the first half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"If we went to the nice neighborhoods in the San Fernando Valley or Orange 
County, it wouldn't be a big deal," Jordan said. Such a program in the affluent 
suburbs, she said, would make "no difference for the children there. They can 
use their parks." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone appreciates the mission's efforts. Jordan recalled a disturbing 
conversation during a radio talk show appearance three summers ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The caller was very abrasive, very confrontational," she said. " 'How dare you 
take these poor little children and try to show them how the rest of the world 
lives. Don't you know they will be so dissatisfied?' the man scolded. It was 
one of the most bizarre conversations I've ever had." 
</P>
<P>
The camp program, which travels to Hollenbeck Park on July 23, also includes 
weekly field trips. Outings to the Queen Mary and the Spruce Goose, Universal 
Studios and the Ringling Brothers &amp; Barnum and Bailey Circus are scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I want the children to be dissatisfied with poverty conditions," 
Jordan said. "This program gives these kids a chance to see things that other 
kids take for granted. It gives them the little extras. It's like saying, 'Hey, 
there is more. You can be more.' "

TRUSTEE URGES ETHICS CODE FOR COLLEGE BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Ventura County Community College District trustee has called for drafting a 
code of ethics to govern the board, citing the controversy surrounding fellow 
Trustee Tom Ely's travel expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Trustee Timothy Hirschberg said Thursday that he will push for the formation of 
a committee, composed of community residents and possibly two trustees, to 
develop a code of ethics and procedures for handling complaints about board 
members. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's time for the board to put its foot down . . . and draft a tough, 
self-policing trustee code of ethics," Hirschberg said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the ethics committee would set guidelines for submitting expense claims 
and re-evaluate the need for trustee perquisites such as district-issued fax 
machines, telephones and credit cards. In addition, the committee would set 
forth policies that would allow the board to discipline a trustee. 
</P>
<P>
Hirschberg said he will make his recommendation to the board at its next 
meeting in August. 
</P>
<P>
He said his concern for establishing an ethics code was prompted by the 
controversy surrounding Ely, who is the subject of an investigation by the 
district attorney's office involving the possible misappropriation of funds. 
</P>
<P>
Ely's troubles began in March when the Board of Trustees commissioned an audit 
of his district travel expenses after learning that he had run up large 
gambling debts and that he had used his district office telephone to call 
casinos in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
The audit found that Ely had spent several thousand dollars in questionable 
expenses during business trips he took during the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
Ely has maintained that the audit is flawed and that he did not violate 
district travel policy. Deputy Dist. Atty. Carol Nelson said Thursday that her 
investigation of Ely's finances is nearly complete, but would not speculate on 
when the findings would be released. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ely's troubles continue to mount. Last week, the board voted to sue 
the 54-year-old Simi Valley resident if he does not submit expense reports for 
business trips he took this year or repay the district $1,575 in travel 
advances. 
</P>
<P>
But the trustee has said that he has no intention of submitting the receipts 
until the district reimburses him for $1,500 in business expenses he has 
incurred over the past three years.

TAKING A BYTE OUT OF CRIME; 
</P>
<P>
OXNARD: A TELEPHONE AND PERSONAL COMPUTER ACQUIRED WITH SEIZED DRUG MONEY HAS 
ALREADY HELPED CRACK A CAR-BURGLARY CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oxnard police have discovered an innovative way to use the common telephone as 
a tool for preventing and solving perplexing crimes. The new crime-busting 
tool, which employs a specially programmed personal computer and a long list of 
telephone numbers, was used last December to solve a rash of burglaries in a 
west Oxnard neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Police had arrested three juveniles who admitted to burglarizing dozens of cars 
in a neighborhood near Wooley and Victoria roads. The problem was that police 
had very few burglary reports in that neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Using a common personal computer with an automatic telephone-dialing program, 
employees at the Police Department's crime analysis office conducted a 
telephone survey of the neighborhood. The computer called 350 residences in two 
days and played a recorded message that asked residents to call police if they 
had been the victim of theft. 
</P>
<P>
The plan worked. Police received 24 calls from residents who said their cars 
had been burglarized, said David Keith, senior crime analyst. The burglary 
victims were identified and reunited with their stolen tools and tape decks, 
and the culprits were put behind bars, Keith said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not the only case in which the microchip has helped police triumph over 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
Keith said the computer has been used in recent months on other duties. It has 
helped identify witnesses to a brutal assault, warn banks and stores about a 
check-forgery ring and ask employees at 24-hour gas stations and mini-markets 
to be on the lookout for a robbery suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara police have used a similar computer to warn specific businesses 
and residents about crime trends, Keith said. But, he said, Oxnard is the only 
city in the country to use this type of computer technology to solve crimes, 
such as the automobile burglary case. 
</P>
<P>
The computer, known in the Police Department as the crime alert bulletin 
system, is being used to solve another rash of burglaries in central Oxnard, 
near Wooley and Ventura roads. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department bought the $6,000 computer in October with money seized 
from drug offenders, Keith said. "Some drug dealer who is sitting in jail right 
now doesn't know it, but he helped pay for this thing." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's great," said Marie Carbone, an employee at One Stop Market on 
Wooley Road. Carbone said she received a call via the computer on Thursday that 
warned her that someone was trying to cash stolen checks. 
</P>
<P>
The warning was written down and posted in the store for all employees to see, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Crime Prevention Coordinator Jennifer Quinlan, who operates the computer and 
provides the voice for the recordings, said the computer can provide recordings 
in English or Spanish. Residents can select the language with the push of a 
button. 
</P>
<P>
The computer is programmed to hang up on answering machines or when no one is 
at home and then call back later. 
</P>
<P>
When someone answers, that person is greeted with a terse announcement: "This 
is the Oxnard Police Department with a very important message for you . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Said Quinlan: "If you tell them right upfront that it's the Police Department, 
they'll tend to stick around and listen." 
</P>
<P>
Keith said the Police Department has had no complaints about the new system. In 
fact, he said, some residents have called to request that their phone numbers 
be placed in the computer. "They want to be called and warned when something is 
going on," he said.

SLOW-GROWTH LEADER TO RUN FOR COUNCIL

<TEXT>
<P>
Scott Weiss, the founder of a burgeoning slow-growth movement in a city known 
for courting developers, announced his intention Thursday to seek a seat on the 
Oxnard City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss resigned last week as chairman of Citizens to Protect Oxnard, a 
slow-growth, grass-roots organization, to concentrate on his November election 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
He founded the organization in January and presided over its seven-member 
steering committee. 
</P>
<P>
The four-year council terms of Councilman Manuel Lopez and Ann Johs expire in 
November, as does the two-year mayoral term of Nao Takasugi. Johs has announced 
her intention to seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez and Takasugi have yet to announce their plans. 
</P>
<P>
The filing period begins Monday and closes Aug. 10. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Dorothy Maron, who recently advocated residential development 
limits in the city, announced that she will run for mayor in November. 
</P>
<P>
If elected, Weiss, a self-employed public accountant, said he would try to 
advocate reasonable growth limits in the city and would try to address the 
city's financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Our current council members seem to feel that more growth will solve 
everything, when in reality, the growth they have approved has led to many of 
the fiscal problems that now plague our city," he said in a statement. HUGO

2ND OFFICIAL OPPOSES AMBULANCE TAX 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Moorpark City Council member has taken sides with another councilman to 
oppose a tax that would establish an ambulance station within the city limits. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Scott Montgomery voted with Councilman Paul W. Lawrason Jr. at the 
losing end of a 3-2 decision Wednesday to place the proposed tax on the 
November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, Lawrason had been the lone opponent of the proposal. The city will 
hold another hearing in August soliciting public comment on it. 
</P>
<P>
The tax, if approved by two-thirds of the voters in November, would permit the 
city to charge homeowners an estimated $80 a year to pay for the ambulance 
station in downtown Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark officials who support the tax hope to use it as a way to speed up 
responses by private ambulance crews to residents in the city of about 27,000. 
</P>
<P>
Residents have for months complained that ambulance crews dispatched from a 
station outside the city on Olsen Road are too slow in responding to sick and 
injured patients on the other side of town. 
</P>
<P>
One of the three council members who is backing the measure said the sharp 
division in the five-member council may work to weaken voter support for the 
ambulance station. 
</P>
<P>
"It may hurt it," Councilman Clint Harper said. "I've got to think that the 
voters are going to think of this logically and decide for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
The two dissenting council members say they support the service, but contend 
that there are less expensive ways to finance a new station. They say the city 
ought to be working with the ambulance contractor to provide the service. 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery said he had reservations, even before a cost estimate to establish 
the station leaped from about $500,000 to $870,000. He said Thursday that he 
believes the proposed assessment is ill-advised. 
</P>
<P>
Both Lawrason and Montgomery said they intend to write arguments opposing the 
proposed tax that will appear on the ballot measure, in opposition to 
supporting arguments bearing the names of Harper, Councilwoman Eloise A. Brown 
and Mayor Bernardo Perez. PSYCHE PASCUAL

<P>
Simi Valley police were investigating Thursday the kidnaping and sexual assault 
of a 19-year-old woman in the Civic Center area, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, who was not identified, was abducted about 11:30 p.m. Wednesday in 
front of the Simi Valley Development Services building in the 3800 block of 
Alamo Street, Lt. Neal Rein said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was talking on a pay phone when a car pulled up and the driver 
jumped out and grabbed her, Rein said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, described as a Latino male in his early 20s, forced the woman into 
his car and drove her to a secluded southeast area of the city, where he 
assaulted her, Rein said. 
</P>
<P>
The assailant drove the victim back to where she was abducted, released her and 
drove off, Rein said. The woman was taken to Ventura County Medical Center, 
treated for minor injuries and released, he said. CARLOS V. LOZANO

$500,000 CROP OF MARIJUANA SEIZED

<TEXT>
<P>
Narcotics detectives from the Ventura County Sheriff's Department seized 
$500,000 worth of marijuana plants and arrested the alleged grower during a 
drug bust Wednesday evening in the Santa Monica Mountains, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Rheo Vaughn, 48, was arrested on suspicion of cultivating marijuana and 
released on his own recognizance, a Ventura County Jail spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very, very disappointed," Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. Arnie Aviles 
said. "He had a very big cash crop." 
</P>
<P>
The carefully tended crop of more than 200 plants would have been ready for 
harvest in three months, Aviles said. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department received a tip last week that marijuana was being 
grown on the property in the 9900 block of Cotharin Road in an unincorporated 
area of the county southwest of Thousand Oaks, Aviles said. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives obtained a search warrant and investigated the property Tuesday, 
Aviles said. He said the detectives photographed the 1,500-square-foot plot 
before pulling out all the plants. Some of the plants will be analyzed at a 
lab, and the rest will be destroyed, he said. CAROL WATSON

LIFE SENTENCE OF 'CAREER CRIMINAL' REVERSED; JUDGE ORDERS A NEW TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Warren James Bland, who was labeled a career criminal last year by a San Diego 
federal judge and ordered to prison for the rest of his life without parole, 
has won a reversal of his sentence from a federal appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Bland's life-without-parole 
sentence -- for gun possession by a repeat felon -- because U.S. District Judge 
J. Lawrence Irving, who presided over the case, improperly told jurors that 
Bland was wanted in the murder of a 7-year-old Pasadena girl. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling, issued Wednesday by the San Francisco-based court, entitles Bland, 
54, of Los Angeles, to a new trial on the gun charge, which federal prosecutors 
indicated Thursday they are likely to pursue. He also faces a pretrial hearing 
on the murder charge July 31 in Riverside County, according to Municipal Court 
records. 
</P>
<P>
Bland was the first prisoner in California and only the fourth in the nation to 
be sentenced to life without parole under a relatively recent federal law that 
targets repeat offenders. 
</P>
<P>
Five times over the past three decades, Bland has been released from prison. 
Five times, he has been rearrested for terrorizing women and children in a 
series of sexual assaults in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
When Irving imposed the life term last August, he called Bland a "vicious, 
incorrigible predator." Because of Bland's bespectacled, grandfather-like 
appearance, Irving said, he is "particularly dangerous" and a "wolf in sheep's 
clothing." 
</P>
<P>
Bland was most recently released from prison in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1987, he was wounded and arrested by San Diego police and charged 
in the torture and murder of 7-year-old Phoebe Ho of South Pasadena, whose body 
was found in a Riverside County ditch. She had disappeared while walking to 
school in December, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Bland also has been named as a suspect in the slayings of Wendy Osborn, 14, of 
Placentia in Orange County, and Ruth M. Ost, 81, of San Diego, 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police had been looking for Bland on the Riverside murder warrant. 
Officers found a gun in his car. 
</P>
<P>
Bland, who had spent 21 of the previous 26 years in either prison or mental 
institutions, was charged under a 1986 federal "career criminal" law with 
possession of a gun by a felon with at least three serious convictions. The law 
set maximum punishment as a no-parole life term. 
</P>
<P>
According to 9th Circuit Judge Edward Leavy, Bland had been visited after his 
arrest in San Diego by his parole officer, who advised him of his right to 
remain silent but failed to tell him that he had a right to have a lawyer 
present. 
</P>
<P>
Bland then admitted having stolen the car and the gun, Leavy said. That 
confession, Leavy ruled Wednesday, will be barred at a retrial because the 
warning did not meet constitutional muster. 
</P>
<P>
Bland's primary defense to the gun charge was his claim that the weapon had 
been planted in the car by police to justify the shooting, Leavy said. Federal 
prosecutors said the officer was justified in shooting based on his knowledge 
of the murder warrant against Bland. 
</P>
<P>
During pretrial questioning and over defense objections, Judge Irving told 
prospective jurors about the warrant and the planned police testimony that the 
warrant for Bland was in connection with the "molestation and torture and 
murder of a 7-year-old girl." 
</P>
<P>
Irving ordered potential jurors to consider the warrant only to show the 
policeman's state of mind when he shot Bland, not as proof that Bland was 
guilty of murder. 
</P>
<P>
Leavy, however, said the evidence should simply have been excluded because it 
was irrelevant to the gun case. It would have been enough, he said, to tell 
jurors, as San Diego defense lawyer Mario Conte had offered to do, that the 
warrant justified shooting Bland as a fleeing felon, without discussing the 
warrant's details. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot expect jurors to remain impartial when information that should not 
have been mentioned permits them to believe that acquitting (Bland) may mean 
releasing an exceedingly dangerous child molester and killer into the 
community," Leavy said. 
</P>
<P>
Judges Stephen Reinhardt and Pamela Ann Rymer concurred in the opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Judith Feigin in San Diego, who handled the case on 
appeal, said Thursday that prosecutors are committed to a second trial. 
However, the government may still ask the 9th Circuit for a rehearing of 
Wednesday's decision, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution had contended that the information in the murder warrant never 
would have been mentioned if the defense had not insisted on bringing the 
shooting incident into the case, Feigin said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Wednesday's opinion, Bland remains in federal prison pending further 
court action, U.S. Atty. William Braniff said.

POLICE SHOT AT 2ND TIME FROM HARBOR PROJECT; 
</P>
<P>
GANGS: MORE OFFICERS ARE CALLED IN TO THE AREA. BOTH ATTACKS ARE SEEN AS 
RETALIATION FOR A GANG MEMBER'S DEATH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For the second time in a week, gang members at a Wilmington housing project 
have shot at Los Angeles police in apparent retaliation for the recent death of 
a gang member, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to the Thursday shooting, Harbor Division Cmdr. Joe DeLadurantey 
said as many as two dozen officers from other LAPD divisions have been assigned 
to the harbor area to put more officers in gang neighborhoods. The first of 
those officers arrived Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
DeLadurantey, who earlier this week had turned down an offer of additional 
officers, said the shooting at a patrol car at Dana Strand Village convinced 
him that the way to confront the gangs' recent bravado is with more police 
patrols. 
</P>
<P>
"After what happened this morning, there is no doubt we need additional 
presence," DeLadurantey said. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be easy for me to call in an army. I'm not going to do that," 
DeLadurantey added. "But I do think we need additional officers . . . and we 
need the community to get involved. Enough is enough." 
</P>
<P>
No officer was injured in the shooting Thursday, which happened at 2:30 a.m. as 
several patrol cars answered a call about a disturbance at the project. One 
teen-ager was arrested on suspicion of assault on a police officer with a 
deadly weapon. In the first armed assault on police last Sunday, one officer 
was grazed by a bullet. 
</P>
<P>
The Thursday shooting heightened fears among community activists that a handful 
of gang members at Dana Strand remain bent on revenge for the death Saturday 
morning of John Santos. An autopsy found that the 21-year-old gang member 
choked to death on a tiny plastic bag containing what police believe were 
narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
Although the contents of the bag have not yet been analyzed by the coroner's 
office, the autopsy Wednesday confirmed initial police reports that Santos 
choked to death. 
</P>
<P>
The finding contradicts gang rumors that he died at the hands of officers. 
Police and community activists said Thursday that the coroner's report is 
meaningless to a few raging gang members. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got a couple of hotheads out there who still want to make a name for 
themselves," said Dee Wiggington, president of Mothers Against Gangs Support 
Services, a local group attempting all week to ease tensions at Dana Strand. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Kim Wierman said Thursday's shooting occurred after police were 
called to Dana Strand by a resident who complained of a disturbance in the 
central parking lot of the 384-unit housing project, just east of the Harbor 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Mindful of rumors that gang members might try to ambush police at the projects, 
the officers entered Dana Strand only after a police dispatcher confirmed that 
the call was legitimate. Even then, Wierman said, the first officers arriving 
at Dana Strand waited for two additional patrol cars before driving into the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
As they entered the central lot, Wierman said, the officers found about a dozen 
gang members standing around, one of them motioning defiantly for police to 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally they run when they see officers drive up, but this time they just 
waved the officers on," Wierman said. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, he said, one of the youths pulled out a handgun and began 
shooting, hitting one of the patrol cars. 
</P>
<P>
The officers, who did not return the gunfire, chased the gang members as they 
fled from the projects, arresting the 17-year-old several blocks away, Wierman 
said. The teen-ager, not identified because of his age, was still in custody 
late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
By late Thursday, Wierman said, it was unclear if the suspect is the one 
responsible for this shooting or one early Sunday, in which a bullet grazed one 
of two officers driving past Dana Strand. 
</P>
<P>
The arrival of additional officers from LAPD's gang detail and several other 
divisions was seen by police and community activists as regrettable but 
unavoidable. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to see this happen. But it's gotten to the point where there is no 
choice but to bring in more police," said Wiggington of Mothers Against Gangs. 
</P>
<P>
The additional officers from the 77th, Southwest and Southeast divisions will 
be assigned to routine police calls while Harbor Division police, more familiar 
with local gangs, handle beefed-up patrols around housing projects and other 
gang problem areas, said DeLadurantey. 
</P>
<P>
The increased deployment, he said, is likely to continue for the next month. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will take at least that long to show some results, because to be 
effective you almost have to treat gang activity like a brush fire that moves 
from place to place," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That movement is precisely what Wilmington activists had feared. 
</P>
<P>
"This is horrible. Things are totally out of hand," longtime activist Eleanor 
Montano said after learning of the latest shooting at Dana Strand. "I thought 
things might finally quiet down," she said, because the fighting between 
Wilmington gangs had subsided. 
</P>
<P>
"Now they're going after the police," Montano said.

SUPERVISORS OK DEVELOPERS' FEES TO PAY FOR NEW FIRE STATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Developers building in the Antelope and Santa Clarita valleys and portions of 
the Malibu-Santa Monica Mountains area face a new fee to pay for construction 
of fire stations under a plan approved Thursday by the County Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
By a 4-0 vote, the board adopted the fee for developers of residential, 
commercial and industrial projects in those areas. However, it will not take 
effect in the Antelope and Santa Clarita valleys until the three valley cities 
agree to impose the same levy and give the money to the county. 
</P>
<P>
The fee will take effect almost immediately in unincorporated areas of the Fire 
Department's Malibu-Santa Monica Mountains zone, a 162-square-mile area on the 
coastal and inland sides of the mountains stretching from just north of Pacific 
Palisades to the Los Angeles-Ventura county line. 
</P>
<P>
It will not apply to Malibu -- now in the process of becoming a city -- or the 
cities of Agoura Hills, Hidden Hills and Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
County fire officials said the fee will not take effect in the 
2,119-square-mile Antelope Valley area until the cities of Lancaster and 
Palmdale adopt the same plan. Similarly, the fee would only take effect in the 
394-square-mile Santa Clarita Valley area with the approval of the city of 
Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
County fire officials estimated that the 17 new fire stations needed in the 
three areas by 1995 would cost $33 million. Eight stations would be built in 
the Antelope Valley, eight in the Santa Clarita Valley, and one in the city of 
Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
At the rate of 18.74 cents per square foot of construction, the fire station 
charge would add about $375 to the cost of a typical 2,000-square-foot new 
house. And although the fee would be paid by developers, they typically pass 
along such costs to buyers through higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
The fire station fee is the first of its kind for the county. Without it, 
county fire officials warned, fire protection in the developing areas would 
suffer because the county would have too little money to build and equip the 
needed stations. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally, our fire service needs weren't being met in the developing areas," 
said Deputy County Fire Chief Jim Hunt. "The intent of the fee is to allow us 
to build the facilities as the development is taking place." 
</P>
<P>
City officials in Lancaster and Palmdale said Thursday that they expect to 
concur with the county's action in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Harris, Santa Clarita's community development director, could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The new fee was supported by spokesmen for the Building Industry Assn., a 
developers trade group that has challenged other fees but said it recognized 
the need for more fire stations. 
</P>
<P>
County fire officials said the counties of Orange, Riverside, Ventura and Santa 
Barbara have imposed similar charges in recent years.

TRUCK PULLS INTO GAS STATION HAULING A BIG LOAD OF FLAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ignoring horrified screams of protest from attendants, a truck driver pulled 
into their gas station in Santa Clarita on Thursday with flames from a load of 
burning oil drums and tires streaming from his truck. 
</P>
<P>
The attendants feared the blaze would spread. And they were right. 
</P>
<P>
Before Los Angeles County firefighters could snuff out the flames, the fire had 
destroyed the truck and two parked vehicles, singed the side of the station and 
burned two gas pumps. 
</P>
<P>
Battalion Chief Larry Rorher said the incident started on the Golden State 
Freeway about 12:20 p.m. when a motorist frantically warned the truck driver 
that his load of old tires and oil drums was on fire. Rorher said the cause of 
the fire had not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
The driver sped off the freeway at Lyons Avenue and pulled into one of the 
first available driveways -- an Exxon station. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Padilla, who works at the station, said he and other attendants waved 
their arms and yelled at the driver to take his truck elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
But by then the driver was jumping out of the cab, he said. As customers 
scurried to safety, attendants called the Fire Department and Padilla threw an 
emergency switch to shut off the flow of gas to the pumps. 
</P>
<P>
Padilla said small explosions rocked the truck bed and flaming oil began 
streaming down the pavement until it reached the gas pumps and two parked 
vehicles, a truck belonging to attendant David Gulcynski and a car belonging to 
a motorist who had left the car at the station for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Then a larger explosion sent flames and a plume of smoke high into the air, 
Padilla said. "When the explosion happened, that's when I moved down the 
street," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters doused the fire within minutes. There were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the truck, who was not identified, declined to be interviewed.

DISCOVERY OF MARIJUANA CLOSES DAY-CARE CENTER; 
</P>
<P>
RESEDA: POLICE FIND AN EIGHT-FOOT-HIGH PLANT AND A LOADED RIFLE. THE WOMAN WHO 
CARED FOR UP TO EIGHT CHILDREN IS ARRESTED AND LOSES HER LICENSE. HER BOYFRIEND 
IS ALSO ARRESTED.

<P>
A Reseda day-care center where police found an eight-foot-high marijuana plant 
and a loaded gun within the reach of children was ordered closed and its 
operator's license was suspended Thursday by state officials. 
</P>
<P>
Kim McIntyre, 28, who operated the day-care center in her home in the 19500 
block of Vanowen Street was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of cultivating 
marijuana, a felony. She was later released from the Van Nuys jail after 
posting $5,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police said they intend to seek a charge of child endangerment 
against McIntyre in addition to the drug charge. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on a complaint from police, the state Department of Social Services 
which licenses day-care centers, issued a suspension and closure order 
Thursday, said Fred Miller, deputy director of the community care licensing 
division. 
</P>
<P>
"She can no longer operate," Miller said of McIntyre. 
</P>
<P>
McIntyre told police that she was growing the marijuana to help cut down on her 
live-in boyfriend's expenses for the drug. 
</P>
<P>
The boyfriend, Michael Cardenas, 30, was not at home when police searched the 
house Tuesday, but he was arrested Wednesday night on suspicion of cultivating 
marijuana and was being held in lieu of $5,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Police said McIntyre was caring for as many as eight young children in the 
house. The property was searched after police received an anonymous tip that 
marijuana was grown there. Detectives could see an eight-foot marijuana plant 
extending over a back-yard fence and obtained a search warrant, Lt. Gary 
Rogness said. "It was one very, very large plant," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators did not realize that the house -- which has no sign posted -- 
was also a day-care center until they entered Tuesday afternoon and found 
several children in McIntyre's care, Rogness said. 
</P>
<P>
"There were seven or eight kids playing in the back yard by this plant," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the marijuana plant, which weighed nine pounds after it was 
removed, investigators said they found a smaller marijuana plant, about five 
ounces of the drug inside the house and a loaded rifle in a bedroom accessible 
to the children. 
</P>
<P>
"She said, 'I planted it to save money for my boyfriend,' " Rogness said of 
McIntyre. "She said that she didn't smoke the stuff herself, that she only put 
it in cookies and brownies." 
</P>
<P>
Rogness said there was no indication that McIntyre gave marijuana-laced 
brownies or cookies to children in her care. However, he said investigators 
will ask prosecutors to charge McIntyre with child endangerment for allowing 
the children in her care near the drugs and the rifle. 
</P>
<P>
Social services officials said McIntyre received a license earlier this year to 
care for no more than six children at a time. Her house was inspected before 
the license was issued, but no drugs were seen, officials said. There had been 
no complaints about McIntyre before her arrest. Officials said she can request 
an administrative hearing to appeal her license suspension but cannot operate 
in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
McIntyre could not be reached for comment Thursday. When she was arrested 
Tuesday, police officers had to call parents of the children at the house so 
they could pick them up. Her own 7-year-old daughter was placed in the care of 
a friend. 
</P>
<P>
A Tarzana woman whose infant son was cared for by McIntyre earlier this year 
said Thursday that she stopped leaving her son at the house after twice seeing 
marijuana plants there. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time, I saw a small plant in the kitchen, and I told her it 
shouldn't be there," D.M. Fischler said. "It was gone the next day. Then about 
a month later I was looking in her garden and saw a marijuana plant about five 
feet high. So we pulled our son out. Kim used to dote on my son, but her care 
went downhill." 
</P>
<P>
Fischler said she did not make a complaint to authorities about McIntyre 
because the women were friends and Fischler believed the plants belonged only 
to McIntyre's boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
"I should have made a complaint, but I didn't," Fischler said. "It was hard."

LIMITS ON HILLSIDE DENSITY GET INITIAL OK; 
</P>
<P>
EAST VALLEY: THE PLANNING COMMISSION MOVES TO PROTECT THOUSANDS OF ACRES FROM 
TUJUNGA TO LAKE VIEW TERRACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Los Angeles Planning Commission gave tentative approval Thursday to a 
massive rezoning proposal aimed at barring dense development from 6,600 acres 
of mountainous land in the east San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"I do feel there needs to be some part of Los Angeles that preserves its 
country atmosphere," said Commissioner Fernando Torres. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, initiated two years ago by Councilman Joel Wachs, is intended to 
protect hillsides in the communities of Lake View Terrace, Shadow Hills, 
Sunland, Sun Valley and Tujunga, said city planner Edward M. Barr. 
</P>
<P>
It reduces the zoning classification of undeveloped areas in the Verdugo Hills 
that have natural slopes of 15% or more to minimum density, restricting 
development to no more than one single-family house per acre. 
</P>
<P>
It places in jeopardy at least 15 proposed subdivisions ranging in size from 
six units to a 119-unit project by developer Dale Poe. The areas now are zoned 
for denser single- and multiple-family housing. 
</P>
<P>
Planning commissioners approved the proposal by a 4-0 vote after a public 
hearing attended by about 100 residents that lasted more than three hours. More 
than 300 people attended a previous hearing in April. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal will come back to the commission in two weeks after the planning 
staff re-examines the 15 subdivisions to determine whether they should be 
included in the new zone. It must then be approved by the City Council's Land 
Use and Planning Committee and the full City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Speakers at Thursday's hearing were about evenly divided. 
</P>
<P>
Those who favored the proposal said the area is the largest undeveloped piece 
of land in Los Angeles and should be afforded the same protection as hillside 
areas in Sherman Oaks and other more affluent communities. 
</P>
<P>
"We moved here because of the country atmosphere," said Shadow Hills resident 
Wesley Nutten. "We'd like it to stay that way." 
</P>
<P>
"There are very few mountains left in Los Angeles," said resident Bill Eick of 
Sun Valley. "All we're asking is that we be treated the same as the rest of Los 
Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
"Any proposal that limits development is welcome," said Lake View Terrace 
resident Margarita Allen. 
</P>
<P>
Several speakers said they do not want to see the area become "Glendale West." 
Lewis Snow, president of the Lake View Terrace Home Owners Assn., said 
homeowners in the east Valley are trying "to prevent the Glendale-ization of 
our hillsides." 
</P>
<P>
They said Glendale has allowed its hillsides to become cluttered with houses. 
</P>
<P>
Though the proposal may seem extreme to some, Snow said, "We would rather err 
on the side of caution and protect the hillsides." 
</P>
<P>
Those opposed to rezoning said the city would be violating property owners 
rights and depriving moderate income people of housing. 
</P>
<P>
The plan protects "a few at the expense of many," said Lucy Metcalf of La 
Crescenta, who owns property in the area. "This is taking private property for 
public use." 
</P>
<P>
Judith Spencer of Sunland called the plan "too severe. It will curb a healthy 
growth situation." 
</P>
<P>
"This will have a dramatic effect on the community by virtually eliminating 
single-family housing," said builder Chris Richman of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Several speakers said that only multimillionaires will be able to afford new 
homes in the area if it is rezoned. 
</P>
<P>
"Porter Ranch has 3,500 homes," said Paul Fise of Sun Valley, referring to a 
$2-billion development plan for the Chatsworth Hills approved by the City 
Council early this week. "That should take care of our additional housing needs 
in the San Fernando Valley for some years to come," reducing the need to 
develop hillsides in the East Valley, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Torres said he normally supports plans that call for increasing the housing 
supply, but that in this case he believes the mountains should be preserved. 
</P>
<P>
"This is long overdue," said Commissioner Suzette Neiman.

NEW KILLING ADDED TO TASK FORCE INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEANNA BELLANDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Metropolitan Homicide Task Force has taken over the investigation of the 
killing of a woman found in Scripps Ranch Wednesday because of the case's 
similarity to more than 40 killings it is investigating, a spokeswoman for the 
task force said. 
</P>
<P>
In many of those cases, the bodies of nude, strangled women have been found in 
remote parts of the county. 
</P>
<P>
The identity of the woman found Wednesday in an isolated strip of Scripps Ranch 
Boulevard is still not known, but she was strangled with a rope and was 
believed to have been a prostitute, said task force spokeswoman Lt. Liz Foster. 
</P>
<P>
"It was enough for the task force to take the case," Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
The dead woman was found about 20 feet down an embankment in the 10300 block of 
Scripps Ranch Boulevard about 7:30 Wednesday morning. Police said the woman, 
who is possibly Latina or Asian, was in her 30s and was wearing a dark blouse, 
bright green pants and white sandals. 
</P>
<P>
The woman's body was found when a woman on her way to work saw a coil of yellow 
nylon rope near the sidewalk and glanced over the embankment. The rope led down 
to the body and was wrapped around the victim's neck, Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
There is evidence that, sometime during the night, the woman's body was dragged 
from a vehicle parked at the curb and then either thrown or taken down the 
embankment, said San Diego Homicide Lt. Paul Ybarrondo. The San Diego police 
were handling the case until it was turned over to the task force late Thursday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Foster, of the task force, said that the woman was also beaten with a blunt 
object. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe we found her within a 24-hour period of her death," Foster said. 
"That will help in the identification because there is evidence that has yet to 
be destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
This is the first case added by the task force since last July, when a woman 
was found dead in La Mesa, Foster said. In that case, the primary cause of 
death is listed as an overdose but, for reasons she wouldn't discuss, Foster 
said the task force is keeping the case. 
</P>
<P>
The joint city-county task force was formed in September, 1988, to investigate 
a growing list of victims that police thought might be related to the Green 
River serial killings in the Seattle area. The series of slayings here began in 
1985, shortly after the similar series of killings ended in the Seattle area. 
</P>
<P>
This is the 16th strangulation case the task force has investigated, Foster 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they are hoping that three tattoos on the woman's body will make 
identifying her easier. On her left shoulder and on her left thumb is the same 
tattoo of a butterfly or small flower. On the woman's left thigh, the name 
"Tommy" is written vertically, Ybarrondo said.

DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: VENTURA, HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY WORK PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Department of Transportation has announced that construction-related 
lane, ramp and connector road closures will continue this weekend on the 
Ventura and Hollywood freeways from Vineland to Haskell avenues. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans advised motorists to avoid freeway travel in the vicinity of the 
Ventura and San Diego freeways throughout the weekend, and to instead use city 
streets such as Burbank and Ventura boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
The eastbound and westbound Vineland off-ramps to the Hollywood Freeway will be 
closed from 10 p.m. today to 5 a.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
From 11 tonight to 11 a.m. Saturday, the northbound San Diego Freeway connector 
to the westbound Ventura Freeway will be closed. From 11 p.m. Saturday to 11 
a.m. Sunday, three connector roads will be closed -- from the northbound San 
Diego Freeway to the westbound Ventura Freeway, from the westbound Ventura to 
the southbound San Diego, and from the eastbound Ventura to the northbound San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
On both nights, up to three westbound lanes on the Ventura Freeway will be 
closed between Van Nuys Boulevard and Haskell Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The closings are part of a $61-million widening and resurfacing of the 
Hollywood and Ventura freeways from Universal City to Agoura Hills.

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: A DOWNSCALE HOUSE IN AN UPSCALE NEIGHBORHOOD, LA 
JOLLA SEAS TAKES MIDDLE ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shopping center food courts are not a peculiarly local phenomenon, although the 
dining zone in the Golden Triangle's new Costa Verde Center may be unique in 
one rather amusing aspect: Smack in the middle of the collection of full-scale 
eateries, sandwich shops and frozen yogurt parlors is a Jenny Craig Weight Loss 
Centre. 
</P>
<P>
If the Craig outlet's presence fails to give dinner-bound visitors pause, it 
may at least give them food for thought. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who has followed the remarkably rapid development of the Golden Triangle 
with condominium and apartment complexes may note that the one truly 
full-service restaurant in the Costa Verde collection, a new place called La 
Jolla Seas, was carefully crafted to suit its surroundings. If the area can be 
called an instant neighborhood, La Jolla Seas can be called an instant 
neighborhood restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
In a press release, proprietor Shige Hashimoto makes the observation that "The 
Golden Triangle does not need another expensive restaurant." Hashimoto took an 
intelligent line when he chose to open a downscale house in an upscale 
neighborhood, although, as with any sort of restaurant, an inexpensive one is 
only worth the trouble when it's good. La Jolla Seas makes the grade some of 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant's single strongest point may be its service, which on both of 
two recent visits was thoroughly professional and pleasant. The atmosphere 
suits La Jolla Seas' overall approach and might be described as comfortable but 
modest. The banquettes are reasonably deep, but as a small and very noticeable 
economy, sheets of glass cover the tablecloths to save on laundry expenses. 
Lithographed studies of palm trees and birds of paradise line the walls and 
seem oddly appropriate to the location, since Costa Verde is planted with 
impressive stands of palms. 
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto also owns two restaurants in Salt Lake City, which may explain why 
the menu might most accurately be described as "Middle-American melting pot." 
Chef Terry Miyake oversees a list that, according to Hashimoto, is written "in 
a health-conscious manner," a point of view that here translates into 
low-sodium cooking free of preservatives and animal fats. 
</P>
<P>
But "health-consciousness," real or claimed, does not necessarily provide a 
gastronomic focus, and the menu seems mostly an amalgam of styles. There are 
the blunt Americanisms of oysters Rockefeller, shrimp and crab cocktails, the 
"turkey club croissant" sandwich (the croissant may be French, but this sort of 
sandwich is as resolutely American as chop suey and clam chowder. Pasta -- 
fettuccine, to be precise -- appears both on its own in several guises and as a 
garnish, and usually seems more all-purpose than specifically Italian. The menu 
makes much of seafood and finishes it with Japanese, Italian, French, Mexican 
and American sauces or garnishes. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the culinary mix leads to confusion, as it did at lunch when the 
pepper steak sandwich sounded like a very good bet. The dish the diner 
visualized was a thin, cracked pepper-coated steak, sauteed in the French style 
and tucked into a roll; the reality was Philadelphia-style layers of grilled, 
paper-thin beef dressed with sauteed green peppers and onions. For all that, it 
was perfectly tasty and satisfying, but nonetheless a good illustration of the 
point that it pays to ask questions. The lunch menu, by the way, basically is a 
lower-priced repeat of the dinner list. 
</P>
<P>
When the kitchen succeeds, it succeeds handily. The appetizer list includes an 
offering called "house special chicken," which, although it is not identified 
as such, is simply a smaller-scale serving of the entree called "Newport 
chicken." The boned breast is given a light batter coating, carefully 
deep-fried to a fine finish, brushed with a nicely sweet teriyaki glaze and 
topped with sauteed snow peas and mushrooms. The dish comes together well, as 
do soups; chef Miyake turns out a light-bodied clam chowder of fine flavor and, 
on occasion, a cream of mushroom of some depth. 
</P>
<P>
The entree named "seafood confetti" also seemed a fairly well-put-together 
dish, although the guest who ordered it found that salt was needed to develop 
the flavors. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the success of the chicken appetizer, the entrees with Oriental 
influences may be the best. These are primarily in the seafood category and 
include mahi-mahi with pineapple glaze, ahi in the restaurant's own teriyaki 
sauce, orange roughy in a gingered orange sauce and a shrimp-and-vegetable 
tempura combination. Dishes with sauces from other cuisines include swordfish 
with pesto; salmon with sauce maltese (properly a hollandaise flavored with 
bitter blood oranges, which are hard to find in this country); red snapper Vera 
Cruz topped with fresh salsa and veal scallops served in the Oscar (French) and 
piccata (Italian) styles.

IP GOES ON TRIAL IN FATAL SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A prosecutor described the death of a 15-year-old boy last summer as "a 
drive-by shooting" during the first day of the murder trial of Roger Sing Ip on 
Thursday. Ip, 33, of Spring Valley, is accused of killing Kurt Yokes of La 
Jolla on July 10, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregg McClain called the crime "senseless," and said it 
occurred after a near-collision between the vehicle in which Yokes was riding 
and Ip's car. 
</P>
<P>
Ip's attorney, William Fletcher, told Superior Court jurors and Judge Herbert 
Exarhos that the incident occurred after Ip counted the receipts at the Pacific 
Beach restaurant he co-owned, and carried the money and a weapon to his Isuzu 
Trooper. 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher said Ip's car and the other car nearly collided about 11:30 p.m., and 
"the female driver extended her middle finger to the driver of the Isuzu 
Trooper." 
</P>
<P>
Ip looked sternly at the occupants, but did not say or do anything, Fletcher 
said, and another remark was made by another passenger in Yokes car. 
</P>
<P>
Ip followed the car because he wanted to talk to the occupants about the 
"disrespect shown to him and the community" with the angry exchanges, Fletcher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"In his culture, when an individual is disrespectful, you talk to that 
individual. At no time did he think of harm or any violent act," said the 
defense attorney. Ip is Chinese and was born in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher did not discuss the shooting itself, but said that Ip drove from the 
scene not knowing that someone had been killed or injured. "Mr. Ip learned 
through the media . . . that Mr. Yokes had been killed," Fletcher said. 
</P>
<P>
McClain said Ip left the county and tried to get a passport from the British 
consulate. Ip is a British subject. However, he returned to San Diego about 2 
1/2 weeks later and surrendered at the courthouse.

'PARENTAL NOTIFICATION' LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again, the U.S. Supreme Court, in its finite wisdom, has dealt women yet 
another blow to their reproductive freedom via its upholding of Ohio's and 
Minnesota's "Parental Notification" laws. 
</P>
<P>
Please understand me. 
</P>
<P>
I am completely in favor of having both parents and teen-agers involved when a 
crisis pregnancy occurs. But for the highest court in the land to mandate the 
"Ozzie and Harriet Syndrome" on today's teen-age women is very sad. To be faced 
with an unwanted pregnancy is enough of an emotional trauma, but to add to that 
having to, by law, tell a parent who may or may not be understanding or 
supportive, or worse yet, to have to go before a judge on what amounts to a 
very personal issue is unthinkable! 
</P>
<P>
The day after the decision was handed down, the National Right to Life 
Committee was quoted as calling it "a major victory for both parents and unborn 
children." Too bad they can't ask young Spring Adams, who lived in one of the 
"notification" states, how she feels about this law. After being raped by her 
father, a single parent, she became pregnant. When she went to him to get 
permission (by law) to terminate the pregnancy, he promptly shot her dead. 
</P>
<P>
I predict two things will result from this decision: More babies will be having 
babies, and more young women will be dying from self-induced or clandestine 
abortions. I'm sure the Right to Life Committee is pleased.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
HOW TO EASE TAXING TRAFFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two members of the Orange County Board of Supervisors have their priorities 
straight. They support an effort to put an important transportation measure 
back on the ballot in November and clear off other revenue issues to give it 
the best chance possible of passing. One other supervisor is leaning in their 
direction, and we hope he joins them in a majority. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, likely to be called Measure M, would increase the county's sales 
taxes by half-a-cent for freeway and rail improvements. It failed 53% to 47% 
last November, short of the majority needed. But the vote indicated a growing 
support for a local tax to help alleviate the county's serious traffic 
congestion problems. Hoping to play on that strength, Supervisors Thomas F. 
Riley and Don R. Roth said this week that they wanted another vote this fall. 
The transportation issue is so important that the board seems to agree that 
bond issues for sorely needed jail and court construction and open space 
purchases may have to wait. 
</P>
<P>
While also agreeing that Measure M is vital, Supervisors Harriett M. Wieder and 
Roger R. Stanton want to wait until 1992 to put it back on the ballot. But that 
seems too long; congestion is uppermost on people's minds. The swing vote 
appears to be Gaddi H. Vasquez, who favors Measure M but is not sure of the 
timing. 
</P>
<P>
The board will decide Measure M's fate on Aug. 7. Whenever it goes on the 
ballot, it faces an uphill battle. 
</P>
<P>
Never has the county's traffic been worse. The passage in June of two statewide 
propositions, 108 and 111, will pump added gas-tax money into some projects, 
but much of that comes only if matched locally. That puts Orange County at a 
disadvantage as the only urban county in the state without a sales tax 
designated for transportation. So, make the tough decisions and strike while 
the iron is hot.

NEWSWIRE: GRAF STILL IN SAN DIEGO EVENT, DIRECTOR SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The director for the Great American Bank Tennis tournament said Thursday that 
Steffi Graf will be playing in the San Diego event Aug. 6-12 despite published 
reports that she would take a month off following a sinus operation in 
Heidelberg last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Stratton said Graf's agent, Philip de Picciotto of Advantage 
International, confirmed Graf would compete in the event following the Players' 
Canadian Open in Montreal July 30- Aug. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Graf has pulled out of the Federation Cup team event in Atlanta starting July 
23. 
</P>
<P>
Graf said at Wimbledon that she had planned the operation for the end of the 
year but was persuaded by doctors to seek an earlier solution to the sinus 
problem that had troubled her for some time.

MINOR LEAGUE NOTEBOOK: BRAD BIERLEY HOPES MAJORS HAVE HIS NUMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like a Ping-Pong ball in a state lottery game, Brad Bierley has bounced around 
in the minor leagues for five years, waiting for his number to be called. 
</P>
<P>
Though the odds are stacked against him, Bierley, the former Rolling Hills High 
School baseball standout now playing for the Chicago Cubs' triple-A team in Des 
Moines, Iowa, may finally win a trip to the majors. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I might get a chance to play before September," Bierley said. "The 
Cubs have a lot of outfielders. There are rumors they might trade away one of 
their (outfield) starters for a top-notch pitcher. That would create an opening 
for one of us to be promoted." 
</P>
<P>
Bierley's fortunes in the minor leagues changed after an off-season trade from 
the Minnesota Twins' farm system. 
</P>
<P>
Buried among several other outfield prospects, Bierley asked the Twins to be 
traded. He was sent to the Cubs, and Des Moines, for a player to be named. 
</P>
<P>
At Des Moines, however, Bierley discovered that the Cubs had an even longer 
line of outfielders playing ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm friends with the Twins' minor league director, and I thought he was doing 
me a favor by trading me to the Cubs," Bierley said. "Little did I know they 
had seven outfielders in the bigs." 
</P>
<P>
In Bierley, the Cubs, who needed another player to fill out their triple-A 
roster, got one of the top power hitters in the International League. 
</P>
<P>
After 80 games, Bierley is tied for second in the league in home runs (14) and 
is fifth in runs batted in (46) and 10th in batting average (.292). 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone thinks I'm a home-run hitter," Bierley said. "I had a couple seasons 
where I hit 20 or more home runs. But I'm not a Jose Canseco or Mark McGwire. I 
like to think I'm a spray hitter. I hit a lot of line drives." 
</P>
<P>
After playing three seasons at Pepperdine, Bierley was drafted by the Twins in 
the fifth round of the 1985 amateur draft. 
</P>
<P>
Bierley became the Twins' top outfield prospect in 1988 after playing two 
seasons of double-A ball in Orlando, Fla. In each of those years, he hit 22 
home runs and averaged .280 or better with 60 to 70 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Bierley was frustrated that he hadn't been promoted after his first season at 
Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I would be invited to big-league camp," Bierley said. "For sure, I 
would be promoted to triple-A. But the Twins signed a couple of free-agent 
outfielders and I was sent back to Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
"I got caught in a numbers game." 
</P>
<P>
In 1988 Bierley was promoted to the triple-A team in Portland, Ore., but 
suffered a bad break. He was hit by a pitch and six weeks later discovered that 
he had a broken bone in his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
"I got hit by someone from the Dodgers at Albuquerque," Bierley said. "I can't 
remember who it was. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't pivot or run on (the leg)." 
</P>
<P>
Bierley finished with only four home runs, 37 RBIs and a .246 batting average. 
He lost his status as the Twins' top outfield prospect and was removed from the 
team's 40-man roster. He also was no longer guaranteed a starting job. 
</P>
<P>
Last season at Portland, Bierley played every fourth day and managed to hit 
.281. 
</P>
<P>
But the Twins were not impressed, and that prompted Bierley's request for a 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what happened," Bierley said. "The Twins got the notion that I 
lost my power. Portland isn't exactly a home-run park for left-handed hitters." 
</P>
<P>
Bierley hasn't had any problems demonstrating his power at Des Moines. One of 
his season's highlights was hitting a home run before 50 family members and 
friends against the Toledo Mud Hens. 
</P>
<P>
"They got a big kick out of that," said Bierley, the son of former North 
Torrance High basketball Coach Russ Bierley. "I knew I would put up big numbers 
again if I got a chance to play every day." 
</P>
<P>
Now Bierley waits to see if has hit the right numbers to make the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Once an all-star, always an all-star -- For the fourth consecutive year, 
catcher Jorge Pedre (Harbor College) was selected to play in a minor league 
all-star game. Wednesday, Pedre played in the Southern League All-Star Game in 
Chattanooga, Tenn. He was hitless in his only at-bat. During the first half of 
the season, Pedre had a .287 batting average with five home runs and 33 RBIs 
while playing for the Memphis Chicks. He made four errors while sharing the 
catching duties with Brent Mayne. Since returning from the 15-day disabled list 
-- he injured his right wrist -- Pedre has been moved to first base. 
</P>
<P>
More notes -- How difficult can the jump be from double-A to triple-A? Kelly 
Mann, who lives in Redondo Beach, had five home runs and 12 RBIs in a one-week 
stretch for the Atlanta Braves' double-A affiliate in Greenville, S.C. Since 
being promoted, Mann has only one home run and seven RBIs in 24 games at 
Richmond, Va. . . .

THE HEAT IS ON; 
</P>
<P>
TROUBLES ABOUND FOR LOS ANGELES' PRO SOCCER TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bobby Bruch, the 23-year-old in charge of community affairs for the Los Angeles 
Heat, was undaunted when only 19 youngsters showed up recently for a youth 
soccer camp in Torrance. The turnout was disappointing, but those connected 
with the Heat are used to disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Bruch was optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to start slow and build," said Bruch, who is also a forward for the 
struggling professional soccer franchise. "I get the feeling being in the 
community that the attitude about the team is getting better." 
</P>
<P>
On the field, the Heat is 7-6, considered mediocre for a franchise generally 
accepted as the most talented in the American Professional Soccer League West. 
</P>
<P>
Off the field, there are deeper, more pressing problems. The Los Angeles Heat 
has no live radio, television or cable exposure, plays its games on a high 
school field, suffers from poor attendance and is awash in red ink. 
</P>
<P>
Bruch, General Manager Jill Fracisco, 26, and part-owner John Ajemian, 31, are 
part of a youthful management team that hopes to rekindle the franchise, which 
was founded in 1986 by three South Bay businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a test year," Fracisco said. "Everything we do we have to look at and 
see how we can make it better." 
</P>
<P>
They also acknowledge that the Heat faces extinction if it is not turned around 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
PROBLEMS, PROBLEMS 
</P>
<P>
The Heat, which plays host to the Salt Lake Sting tonight at 7:30 at West 
Torrance High, has not turned a profit in five years. It lost $150,000 last 
year and is expected to lose even more this season because it signed several 
high-priced players in the last few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The club lacks some of the basic supplies needed to run day-to-day business. 
Money is needed to upgrade personal computers and printers and to pay for 
receptionists and secretarial services. Sometimes ball girls answer telephones 
in the front office. 
</P>
<P>
The Heat cannot afford to pay players full-time salaries, as some of the 10 
other APSL clubs do. Many Heat players hold regular jobs or work part time in 
the youth camps. Los Angeles practices only twice a week, at night. Coach Bobby 
Sibbald sells hair products for a living. 
</P>
<P>
League officials want the Heat to play at Murdock Stadium at El Camino College 
in Torrance, where it played its first year. The West High field is too small, 
Sibbald concedes, but it is more affordable. 
</P>
<P>
Gate receipts have been dismal, although Fracisco said some cutting in other 
areas will probably help the club stay within its $400,000 operating budget, 
lean by professional standards. A series of 11 youth camps is expected to raise 
$20,000, but only if each attracts 50 kids. Still, Fracisco said she "refuses 
to skimp" on amenities for players. 
</P>
<P>
Trade-outs have offset other costs, yet some of them give the impression that 
the Heat is a team for hire. For instance, the players don't wear their names 
on the back of home jerseys. Instead, the shirts bear the logo of a shoe 
manufacturer that supplied them free, along with shoes, as a promotion. 
</P>
<P>
Explained another co-owner, Roland Martin: "My theory is to keep the costs low 
but pay the players more than the (semiprofessional) Greater L.A. Soccer 
League. If we keep it highly competitive on the field, then as the (attendance) 
numbers go up, we can grow slowly." 
</P>
<P>
The largest crowd to watch a Heat game this year was 1,100 on July 1, drawn by 
the promise of a fireworks display that was canceled at the last minute because 
Fracisco couldn't get Torrance school officials to approve the show. 
</P>
<P>
Other teams in the APSL have better followings. The Sting, which receives 
regular clips on three network TV stations, drew nearly 10,000 fans to its 
opener in Salt Lake City in April. The last-place California Emperors have 
capitalized on the large Latino population in the Inland Empire, broadcasting 
games on a Spanish-language radio station. California drew 4,500 people to the 
University of Redlands for its home opener with the Heat. 
</P>
<P>
Soccer ranks third in the United States in number of participants, but in the 
South Bay, the birthplace of the American Youth Soccer Organization, the Heat 
has found it difficult to attract fans. In a recent promotion, 800 mail-in 
coupons for free tickets were distributed near the pier at Redondo Beach. Only 
three were returned. 
</P>
<P>
Said club President John Ajemian: "There are days when we just sit in the 
office, laugh and ask, 'Why do we put ourselves through this?' " 
</P>
<P>
THE IMAGE 
</P>
<P>
"What is the Heat?" 
</P>
<P>
It's the most-asked question a beat writer has received this summer, next to 
"Who cares about soccer?" 
</P>
<P>
The Heat is working hard to improve its image, but there are several major 
obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
Location. The league insists that the team call itself the "Los Angeles Heat." 
In reality, the club plays in Torrance, practices in Manhattan Beach, has its 
headquarters in Redondo Beach and would like to play some of its games in 
Orange County, which has a larger youth market. In fact, some of the owners 
have said they would like to move the team to South Orange County as early as 
next season, if attendance and revenues in the South Bay don't improve. League 
officials are split on such a move. 
</P>
<P>
Exposure. There are nearly 90 radio stations in the Los Angeles market. None 
wanted to broadcast Heat games live. The Heat was upstaged when cable rights 
were negotiated last spring. It is a 15-minute drive to the offices of Prime 
Ticket from West Torrance High, but it is the Emperors in Redlands who can be 
seen on Prime Ticket. Fracisco said the Heat is considering showing its final 
four home games on tape delay on a Torrance cable company if it is not too 
costly. 
</P>
<P>
The Heat has advertised in advance of some of its games in local newspapers, 
including The Times, but the team's advertising budget is only $30,000. A 
one-time, quarter-page advertisement in the Times that would run only in the 
Westside, the South Bay and Long Beach costs about $4,000 without contract 
discounts. The Heat plays a 10-game schedule, which would require $40,000 for 
advertising in just one publication. 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers, at first cool to the Heat, have stepped up coverage during the 
summer. Both The Times' zoned edition and the South Bay Daily Breeze have sent 
reporters to cover some games live. The Spanish-language newspaper La Opinion, 
which has a tremendous soccer following, has also done some stories on the 
team, but with mixed results. After the Heat dropped its home opener, 1-0, to 
the Colorado Foxes, La Opinion charged that the Heat couldn't defeat a 
handicapped team from El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
Stadium. Playing on a high school football field instead of in a stadium also 
tarnishes the team's professional image. Said APSL secretary Arthur Dixon: 
"Over the years, the L.A. Heat seemed that they had very steady increases in 
their attendance. But when they got away (from El Camino), they seemed to lose 
all their fan support." 
</P>
<P>
The cost of playing at El Camino is prohibitive, Heat officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"I can run an entire season at West High for the cost of one game at El 
Camino," Fracisco said. The team's season opener at 12,000-seat Murdock Stadium 
on April 13 drew 500 fans and cost more than $12,000, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Said co-owner Martin: "In smaller cities like Albuquerque, for example, they 
have nothing going on. They can draw six or seven thousand people to a game. 
But here in L.A., it is the most competitive market in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Fracisco agreed: "I love the atmosphere at El Camino, but, realistically, 
playing there is down the tubes. I'd rather play at West High (because it is 
inexpensive) rather than let this team (fail)." 
</P>
<P>
Club owners have considered building their own stadium or leasing an existing 
one. Three sites have been mentioned: the old Aviation High School football 
field in Redondo Beach, a former warehouse site at Wilson Park in central 
Torrance and a sinkhole behind a fast-food restaurant next to Bishop Montgomery 
High School in west Torrance. But no formal proposals have been made to 
officials in either city. 
</P>
<P>
Martin said settling the stadium issue is crucial to building attendance. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it," he said. "Nobody will build a stadium for the Heat. (The 
owners) keep (the idea of building a stadium) around, but we just don't know 
what to do about it." 
</P>
<P>
Audience. The American perception, according to a recent edition of the 
television news program Nightline, is that soccer games are boring. ESPN Senior 
Vice President Loren Matthews told the Times recently that "the sport suffers 
from the image of a very patient, low-scoring game where you go into a 
defensive shell with a 1-0 lead." 
</P>
<P>
Americans want scoring, Matthews said -- lots of it. Heat management has tried, 
with little success, to give its fans what they want. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to try to score more goals," said Martin, who came up through AYSO 
ranks in Torrance. "That's entertainment, scoring. That's what we have to do to 
draw a crowd." 
</P>
<P>
Despite those attempts, which included signing several high-profile players, 
the Heat averages two goals a game and allows 1.7. 
</P>
<P>
Said Ajemian, an Armenian who played soccer as a boy in Syria: "To Americans, 
the bigger the numbers, the better. . . . To attract a following, we need to 
come up with a gimmick (like more scoring)." 
</P>
<P>
The league bases its standings on a combination of wins and numbers of goals 
scored. Ajemian would like the APSL to add a bonus system that pays players to 
score. 
</P>
<P>
Identity. To try to get more goals, the management signed seven new players 
after the season began, meaning that Sibbald has played the same lineup only 
twice. Fans have trouble identifying with the team's stars because whenever a 
new player has started, another player has been benched or released. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are trying to get the money out of this community, then we better make 
heroes out of some of the local boys," said another co-owner, Dave Graefe of 
Torrance. "The problem is, the faces keep changing out on the field, but the 
(uniform) numbers stay the same." 
</P>
<P>
THE OWNERS 
</P>
<P>
No one is sure how many owners the Heat has, or has had over the past year. The 
best guess, Ajemian says, is six or eight. Some "owners" are people who have, 
at some time or another in the club's history, paid some of its expenses. Some 
like to remain anonymous. Others, like Ajemian, who can be seen in the press 
box during games counting tickets, take an active interest. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in this because I love soccer," said Ajemian, who works in a family-run 
business that includes a string of gasoline stations and real estate interests. 
"I'm not in it to make money. Anybody involved in soccer in this town has to 
expect that he won't make a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
The team is attempting to draw up legal documents that would divide ownership 
into percentages based on the amount of money each owner will pay each year. 
The process has been slowed, Fracisco said, because the lawyer working out the 
deal has spent the past six weeks at the World Cup in Italy. It could be 
completed in the next two weeks, with Ajemian and record-company president 
Lionel Conway getting 25% each. 
</P>
<P>
The L.A. Heat Inc. was founded in 1986 by three South Bay men: Bill Buxton, 
Graefe and Eugene Schiappa, an Italian immigrant who owns the Pacific Coast 
Highway building in Redondo Beach where the Heat is headquartered. Each man put 
in $40,000, and the team joined the Western Soccer Alliance, the forerunner of 
the APSL West. 
</P>
<P>
Ajemian bought into the Heat when he sold the California Kickers (now the 
Emperors). Ajemian purchased the Kickers, who played in the San Fernando 
Valley, in 1987 for $10,000. He doubled his stake and sank an estimated $40,000 
into the Heat. The infusion attracted new partners, including Conway, who owns 
a semipro team that some Heat players play for in the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
Ajemian, considered the most active of the owners, says all the owners agree on 
a go-slow approach in spending, although he has boosted the team's budget by an 
estimated $250,000 this season. He would like to see the team break even in 
three years. Sponsoring youth summer camps will eventually pay off in increased 
attendance, he said, and that will boost revenues. He would also like to play 
several exhibition games in South Orange County, where he said the team can 
draw 2,500 people per game. 
</P>
<P>
A few agree with Ajemian that a move to Orange County would be beneficial, but 
they differ on the location. Santa Ana, where a burgeoning Latino community has 
greater soccer awareness, is a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
However, Schiappa would like to see the team stay put. "We will do whatever we 
need to get this team going," he said. "It's the best thing for the league." 
</P>
<P>
Graefe has been frustrated with some of the changes since the new owners moved 
in. 
</P>
<P>
"This year we are spending more money, we have more people on the payroll and 
I'm not sure we are doing any better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
THE FRONT OFFICE 
</P>
<P>
A recent graduate of USC, 23-year-old Dawn Smith discovered quickly that her 
first full-time job, as Heat public relations director, requires her to wear a 
lot of hats. Hired last February, she answer phones, finds halftime shows, sets 
up promotions, takes reservations for youth camps, runs a shuttle service for 
visiting bigwigs and purchases advertising space, to name a few of her duties. 
</P>
<P>
A Bay Area native, Fracisco, 26, is the only female executive in the APSL. She 
was hired as an assistant to then-General Manager Mike Hogue. As a student at 
San Jose State, Fracisco had worked in promotions for the Oakland A's, the 
Golden State Warriors and the Invaders of the defunct U.S. Football League. 
</P>
<P>
Fracisco considers her forte to be preparing for and running game operations. 
She has been an assistant promoter for more than 30 international matches. 
Widely respected, she has recieved two offers to work for soccer clubs abroad. 
Her dark hair and features have made her a favorite among the Spanish-language 
press, where she is known simply as "Geel." 
</P>
<P>
When Smith had the flu last month, she missed the team's road trip to Portland, 
and a report of the game missed some of the morning newspapers. Because of 
budgetary considerations, she did not travel to San Jose last week, and the job 
of phoning newspapers with the results fell to Fracisco. 
</P>
<P>
Explained Ajemian: "We know that (in the front office) we do not have enough 
people, but for this year it will have to do. Next year we hope to add one or 
two more people." 
</P>
<P>
The front-office staff seems to get along well with the players. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you, in the years that I have been around, this is the best I've 
seen the Heat run," said reserve goalie Marine Cano, who is also the soccer 
coach at Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
For four previous years, Hogue was the Heat. He wrote press releases, purchased 
advertisements, answered phones in the office and was the game announcer. A 
promoter with some experience in putting together international soccer matches, 
Hogue was a one-man band who turned out to be quite good at managing what 
Graefe termed the "shoestring budget." 
</P>
<P>
Hogue, however, was an entrepreneur, a love-him-or-hate-him type of guy. Last 
fall he resigned rather than surrender his authority. 
</P>
<P>
Said Hogue: "There were going to be changes in management, and I was absolutely 
against the changes to be made, so it was easy for me to leave." 
</P>
<P>
Graefe was sorry to see Hogue leave, but he understood the need to enlarge the 
front office. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike is the kind of guy who wants to run his own show, and sometimes there 
were conflicts. Mike did something that no one else had the guts to do: that 
is, put a team on the field and run it. . . . I told Mike that you can't do 
everything, that you need people to help you. . . . He had to do some things he 
probably shouldn't have been doing." 
</P>
<P>
Fracisco has been slow to make inroads in solving some of the Heat's basic 
problems, like building attendance and getting a radio or cable TV contract. 
Part of that, suggested one owner who asked not to be named, may be due to her 
unfamiliarity with the Southern California market. 
</P>
<P>
Said Fracisco: "Obviously, I'm still learning. I'm pretty young." 
</P>
<P>
She says she expects attendance to gradually improve by targeting people in 
their early 20s and late teens and tapping into corporations with ticket deals 
in exchange for advertising. She also wants to expand the team's target area 
for spectators, perhaps north into the Westside and east into West Long Beach, 
where the burgeoning ethnic population has swelled soccer's popularity in 
recreational leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Fracisco has a delicate job of balancing the wants of all the active owners, 
estimated to be at least five. As the team struggles on the field and at the 
gate, several have become restless. 
</P>
<P>
Fracisco, however, is not one to speak out unless challenged. 
</P>
<P>
Said one player: "The way we have been playing lately, we need a good chewing 
out, but I don't see (Fracisco) doing that. I think that will be left up to one 
of the owners." 
</P>
<P>
Fracisco, who instituted a series of fines for violations of team rules, 
received a lukewarm reception from the players at first. But as time went on, 
she seems to have earned respect through her attempts to boost the team's 
image. One of her ideas was to have the team dress alike in slacks, shoes and 
shirts when it travels. 
</P>
<P>
"I want the team to look good, to impress," she said. 
</P>
<P>
THE COACH 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Sibbald's No. 2 jersey from his days with the defunct L.A. Aztecs of the 
North American Soccer League is framed and hung on a wall of the cramped Heat 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Born in England, Sibbald came to the United States in 1975 to play with the 
Aztecs and rapidly became a crowd pleaser. Schooled in the English style of 
long ball, he was an aggressive attacker who also had a keen sense of the game. 
Eventually, he was named the Aztec player-coach. 
</P>
<P>
The NASL folded in 1984, and Sibbald stayed active in soccer as a coach at 
Redondo High and for a top club team, Torrance United. 
</P>
<P>
Sibbald would like to see the APSL go to a split season, playing the first half 
in the spring and the second in the fall. He said that would make it easier to 
draw crowds from youth organizations, which play a September-to-December 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
His biggest complaint about American soccer players is their "lack of 
professionalism -- that is, their ability to know how to win a game and how not 
to lose a game." 
</P>
<P>
Sibbald would also like to see the APSL experiment with a system to liberalize 
scoring opportunities -- perhaps by adjusting the off-side call, which kills 
many breakaway attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"Realistically, FIFA (the international governing body of soccer) should look 
at that, too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sibbald is well respected by the players. Said forward Dale Ervine: "Bobby is 
somebody who has played the game and still stayed involved with it in a 
positive way. He has played it at its highest level. People like to learn from 
someone who has been at the highest level." 
</P>
<P>
Sibbald agrees that the Heat has the best talent in the league. He blames the 
league's scoring system, which bases standings largely on the number of goals 
scored, for holding the team back. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep telling my guys that we have to win," he said. "Well, we won three 
straight, and I see we are dropping in the standings because we have not scored 
enough goals." 
</P>
<P>
THE PLAYERS 
</P>
<P>
It's difficult to put a finger on exactly what the Heat is missing on the 
field, yet team members appear to play as individuals without a team concept. 
That fact hasn't gone unnoticed by other players in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Said California Emperor goalie Chris Wilson of Torrance, who shut out the Heat 
twice in regulation play, only to lose both times in overtime: "I could just 
tell, by the things that they were saying to each other on the field . . . that 
they don't know their roles, are not willing to give (their all) and don't care 
to give." 
</P>
<P>
Said a Heat player who asked not to be identified: "We've just got a bunch of 
guys who are out there to collect their paychecks. They don't know how to play 
like a team." 
</P>
<P>
Ervine wouldn't go that far: "We have the kind of players that can shine as 
individuals, but maybe we are trying to shine as individuals all the time, 
instead of playing like a team." 
</P>
<P>
Entering tonight's game, the Heat was in third place in the APSL West Southern 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen anything like this," said Sibbald. "I'm going gray. I don't 
know what it is. We've got the players. I thought we'd be blowing people away." 
</P>
<P>
Injuries, over-spirited play and big egos have played major roles. 
</P>
<P>
In the first 10 games, Sibbald had to use a different starting lineup each 
time. In addition, he said, "red cards are killing us." 
</P>
<P>
One red card (ejection) or a combination of yellow cards (cautions) in 
consecutive games means that a player is required to sit out the next game. On 
July 1 against first-place Real Santa Barbara, for example, two starters missed 
the game. The Heat won on penalty kicks, but only after a lethargic performance 
that necessitated two goals in the final two minutes to send the game into 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason the Heat is making Sibbald gray may be that most of the players 
have been signed to contracts that last only through the end of the season. For 
example, Mike Getchell, Dale Ervine and Jim Gabarra are expected to return to 
indoor soccer in the fall. The indoor game offers much more lucrative 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Publicly, management wants to promote its players. Privately, it complains that 
many players have not learned the responsibilities that come with being 
professional athletes. Explained Fracisco: "We are not very flashy, but we need 
to be stylish. We need to build heroes, no matter who they are. But for some of 
them it is very hard to deal with the media. They're not used to talking." 
</P>
<P>
Soccer is a spirited game, but from the bleachers, some of the finger-pointing 
and shouting among Heat players has left the indelible impression of a team in 
turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
In one confrontation, reserve Steve Sharp got in a shoving match with Sibbald 
on the field in front of the Heat bench during a game. Sharp was later released 
and is now with the San Diego Nomads. 
</P>
<P>
THE LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
In the magazine Soccer International, Chairman Clive Toye of the APSL's eastern 
division described the APSL as "professional with a lower-case p." 
</P>
<P>
That the APSL would even exist as little as a year ago points out that the 
coming World Cup is already having an impact in the United States. As part of 
its contract with FIFA to receive the cup, the U.S. Soccer Federation agreed to 
create a professional soccer league in this country before 1993. But the USSF 
has been slow to act, mostly because it is awaiting the outcome of elections 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
Seizing the opportunity to get a head start on the USSF, the American Soccer 
League and the Western Soccer League merged to form the APSL last February. The 
two semiprofessional leagues, with a total of 22 teams, agreed to upgrade 
salaries and play for a national championship in Boston on Sept. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Differences need to be worked out before the merger is complete. The American 
Soccer League had little or no restriction on the number of foreign players per 
team. The Western Soccer League (now the APSL West) allows only two. Because of 
travel costs, teams will play only within their own divisions this year. Toye 
told Soccer International that he doesn't expect interdivisional play next 
year, either. 
</P>
<P>
The league's wacky scoring system -- which gives teams extra points for the 
number of goals they score -- has come under scrutiny. Trying to encourage more 
offense, the league may have only confused the public. Through the first week 
of July, for example, Arizona (5-8) was atop the Southern Division standings, 
followed by Real Santa Barbara (7-4) and the Heat (7-5). The reason: Arizona 
had scored more goals than either the Heat or Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Sage and Dixon say, league attendance is up through the first half of 
the season. They say they have taken the lead in providing what FIFA demanded 
and the USSF has not delivered -- a professional soccer league. 
</P>
<P>
Said Ajemian: "Where is the plan, and why doesn't the USSF implement it now?" 
They just can't wait until the last minute." 
</P>
<P>
President Werner Fricker of the USSF has steadfastly refused to recognize the 
APSL -- a stand that has angered league members, according to Fracisco. 
</P>
<P>
Fricker, who is up for reelection, has proposed a professional league of three 
to five divisions, each containing eight teams. Fricker said existing teams 
would be eligible to apply for some of the spots, but it seems unlikely that 
all the APSL teams would qualify, because Fricker plans to restrict the regions 
of the country where professional soccer could be played. 
</P>
<P>
Theoretically, any existing franchise in the Los Angeles market would be 
coveted by the USSF, because of possible fees for television rights. In 
addition, it is generally acknowledged that Los Angeles will host either a 
semifinal or a final game of the 1994 World Cup at the Coliseum or the Rose 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Those prospects seems to put the Heat in a good position if it can hang on. But 
other teams in less-populated areas, such as Albuquerque or Salt Lake City, may 
not be as fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the APSL has received some attention from the U.S. media, both good and 
bad. Soccer International said the merger leaves "new hope for the eventual 
return of a fully functional national league." But a headline last month in The 
National said: "U.S. pro soccer: Barely alive and kicking." 
</P>
<P>
Sibbald disputed that claim, pointing out that the Western Soccer League has 
been in operation since 1986, when it called itself the Western Soccer 
Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people didn't think the league would be here (that long)," he said. 
"But it is, and that will tell you something about the people involved in it." 
</P>
<P>
THE FUTURE 
</P>
<P>
The year 1994 will be pivotal for the Heat and professional soccer in general. 
That's when the World Cup will be held in the United States, and many experts 
say it will be the make-or-break year for soccer's reputation in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Said Heat co-owner Martin: "If soccer doesn't go here by 1994, then it is never 
going to go in the United States. We might as well just give up the idea of 
professional soccer and let it exist on a recreational level." 
</P>
<P>
Sibbald said he has waited two decades for the United States to build a viable 
international soccer program. Instead, it has spun its wheels. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago I thought the United States would dominate the world of soccer 
by this time," he said. "Now I'm not so sure." 
</P>
<P>
Already there are storm clouds on the horizon. NBC has said it will not bid for 
the rights to broadcast World Cup games here, and representatives of ABC and 
CBS have speculated that they, too, will drop out of the bidding. The three TV 
networks reach 98% of the people in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Three cable networks have shown an interest, but cable reaches only 51% of the 
neighborhoods in the country. Without full national exposure for the World Cup, 
soccer alliances such as the APSL may discover that it will not generate a lot 
of fan support. 
</P>
<P>
That prospect is chilling to some. 
</P>
<P>
"If the World Cup doesn't create interest in soccer here," said Ajemian, "then 
nothing will." 
</P>
<P>
And that means that the Heat would be turned off for good.

RECREATION: SIMI VALLEY DUO USES BICYCLING TO SHIFT GEARS; 
</P>
<P>
EXERCISE: IN TANDEM, FRANTZ AND MONTANO SATISFY APPETITES FOR COMPETITION WHILE 
SHEDDING WEIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Roger Frantz embraced tandem bicycling 4 1/2 years ago as if his life depended 
on it. 
</P>
<P>
Frantz, beset by heart and blood problems, turned to bicycle riding to regain 
his health. He hooked up with Abbey Montano on the tandem bicycle and the two 
Simi Valley residents set a record in the L.A. Wheelmen's Grand Tour 400-mile 
ultra-marathon last month by finishing in 21 hours 54 minutes. The previous 
record was 22 hours 32 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I had blood disorders and light heart problems and this was all due to the 
extra stress my body was going through," recalled Frantz, 43. "The doctor just 
took me aside and said, 'You're on a collision course. You're not going to live 
much longer if you keep on being this size, so you're going to have to get out 
there and exercise.' " 
</P>
<P>
Frantz started his new activity at "a shade under 300 pounds." At the same 
time, Montano weighed 250. Nearly half a decade later, Frantz is a trim 190 and 
Montano hovers between 155 and 160. 
</P>
<P>
Frantz first tried his hand at racquetball for exercise 4 1/2 years ago, but 
was disappointed at not losing enough weight. "I became proficient at 
racquetball but I didn't have to lose a lot of weight to become proficient," 
Frantz said. "I stood in the middle of the court and engineered my shots rather 
than running after them." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Brown, a friend of Frantz's and a cycling enthusiast, suggested that he 
take his 12-speed from his garage and take to the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"We jumped on our bikes and rode to the top of Santa Susana Pass," Brown said. 
"He had a huge stomach on him and I didn't think he was going to make it. 
</P>
<P>
"The girl I was seeing at the time passed him like he wasn't even moving, and 
Roger didn't take to that too well." 
</P>
<P>
But the challenge of bicycle riding appealed to Frantz. "I remember the first 
couple of times I set up a program I was gonna go out and ride, I couldn't ride 
around the block twice," Frantz said. "Breathing hard, sweating like there's no 
tomorrow. I'd come back and lie down on the couch." 
</P>
<P>
Montano tried to get into shape by starting a running program in 1984 but did 
not continue because of injuries, primarily shin splints. 
</P>
<P>
"I ended up getting on the bike to recuperate (after running) and wound up 
staying on the bike," said Montano, 38. "I spent less time at the doctor's 
office (for injuries) that way." 
</P>
<P>
The cycling relationship Frantz and Montano built over the past four years 
arose after the two were riding single bicycles in Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
"He was riding by himself and I was riding by myself and I caught up with him 
and I thought, 'Oh boy, someone to have a little fun with,' " Frantz said. 
</P>
<P>
A competitive urge seemed to take root as Frantz pedaled past Montano on a 
surface street. Montano, not to be outdone, answered with a surge of his own. 
The two continued to compete back to Simi Valley, where they decided to ride 
together on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
"We said, 'Hey, we're pretty good at this. Why don't we ride together?' And 
that's how it got started," Frantz said. 
</P>
<P>
Frantz and Montano are 9-0 on the amateur circuit, excluding their latest 
effort in the Grand Tour. 
</P>
<P>
The pair began the event at 4:35 a.m. June 23 at the Los Angeles County 
sheriff's substation in Malibu and rode through Port Hueneme, Oxnard, 
Camarillo, Ventura, Ojai and Santa Barbara before reaching the turnaround point 
at Gaviota, about 26 miles north of Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Frantz and Montano finished back in Malibu at 2:29 a.m. June 24. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 miles into the event, four chain links snapped from the force exerted 
by Frantz and Montano and delayed the riders nearly 30 minutes for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I think we were crushing it," Frantz said. "The bearings themselves 
couldn't take the stress against the gears and that's what started metal 
fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually a chain will last you 3,000 to 4,000 miles but this chain probably had 
800 miles on it at most." 
</P>
<P>
The tough part came after the chain was repaired. Generally, a 30-minute loss 
would be considered insurmountable, but Frantz and Montano, the only tandem 
crew in the field of 29 riders, overcame their disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
Riders were released at the start in five-minute intervals and Frantz and 
Montano caught and rode even with a pair of singles until the chain started 
jumping gears and broke. Frantz and Montano steadily made up the deficit over 
the final 200 miles and crossed the finish line simultaneously with two 
singles. Frantz and Montano were technically five minutes ahead because they 
started five minutes behind the two singles. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think we would catch up," Montano said. "(But) as we got into each 
check-in area, as we were checking in, they were checking out." 
</P>
<P>
Check-in stations were 50 to 60 miles apart, said Montano, who rode in the back 
of the team's black, 14-speed Cannondale. 
</P>
<P>
Both Frantz and Montano have suffered injuries riding bicycles. Montano once 
sustained a broken arm while crossing railroad tracks on a narrow road in 
Moorpark, but that was not nearly as life-threatening as Frantz's accident. 
</P>
<P>
In January 1985, about nine months before meeting Montano, Frantz was 
broadsided and run over by a car where Los Angeles and Emory avenues intersect 
in Simi Valley. Though swept underneath the moving vehicle, which proceeded to 
cross the intersection, Frantz miraculously was missed by all four tires. 
</P>
<P>
Even more amazing was that Frantz sustained no broken bones. However, he did 
suffer a bruised kidney, liver and pancreas. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why it didn't kill me and I don't know why I didn't break any 
bones," Frantz said. "All I could remember was that I saw the car coming and I 
just thought, 'It's over.' " 
</P>

WEEKENDER: RAIDERS TRY THEIR HAND AT SOFTBALL IN BENEFIT GAME

<TEXT>
<P>
They haven't left for Oakland or any other locale, so various members of the 
Raiders will participate in a benefit softball doubleheader on Saturday on the 
baseball diamond at Recreation Park off Grand Avenue in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the doubleheader, which starts at 10 a.m., go to the El Segundo 
High athletic program. 
</P>
<P>
Various Raider players, along with a few members of the administrative staff 
and front office, will play a men's squad from the El Segundo firm of 
Information International. 
</P>
<P>
The 1 p.m. game will feature the the Raiderettes against a team of the Stick 
and Stein Sports Bar, Information International and an assortment of 
professional women wrestlers. Admission is $3. 
</P>
<P>
Life's a Beach -- If you live in the South Bay, you are never far away from a 
major professional volleyball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, Manhattan Beach Pier was the site of a pro men's tournament. On 
Saturday and Sunday, starting at 9 a.m. each day, the Women's Pro Beach 
Volleyball Tour comes to the same courts for the John Shaw Open. 
</P>
<P>
The prize money -- starting at $6,000 to the first-place team -- isn't near 
what the men competed for in their event. The crowds won't be quite as large 
either, making it another great opportunity to watch some of the best women 
players from around the world compete in an ever-growing sport. 
</P>
<P>
"Cycling Out" the Opponent -- It is six years since Los Angeles played host to 
the Olympic Games, but one of the facilities built for the Games, the Olympic 
Velodrome, is as busy as ever. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight at 7:30, as well as every Friday through Oct. 12, about 10 bicycle 
races of varying distances will be featured in the Golden State Grand Prix held 
at the velodrome adjacent to the Cal State Dominguez Hills campus. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Olympic-caliber racers are away at a national competition this 
weekend, but they do train and race at the Carson facility regularly during the 
Grand Prix series. 
</P>
<P>
Admission is $5. Information: (213) 516-4000. 
</P>
<P>
If your preference is motorized sports racing, Ascot Park is the place to go. 
Tonight at 7:30, it will play host to the California Motorcycle Club Motocross 
Competition. On Saturday night at 8, action resumes in the California Racing 
Assn. series for sprint cars.

MCKEON PUTS GRANT IN OUTGOING BASKET

Mark Grant took his usual early cab ride to the ballpark Thursday, but this 
time when he was let out in front of the visiting clubhouse at Three Rivers 
Stadium, he told the cabbie to keep the meter running. 
</P>
<P>
In 10 minutes, Grant packed his equipment, said goodby to a few of his 
teammates and the manager he never played for and departed for the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Grant became the latest to leave the Padre merry-go-round Thursday when he was 
traded to the Atlanta Braves for left-handed pitcher Derek Lilliquist. 
Lilliquist, who has primarily been a starter in his three-year professional 
career, will pitch in middle relief for the Padres, Manager Greg Riddoch said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a bittersweet feeling," Grant said. "I'm sorry to be leaving 
here, and I'm going to miss all of the guys, but I'm happy because I'm going to 
have a chance to pitch again." 
</P>
<P>
Grant, 1-1 with a 4.85 earned-run average, was not used in a save situation 
this season. In his 26 appearances, he was involved in only three Padre 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to put up numbers when you don't get to pitch," said Pat Dobson, 
Padre pitching coach, "and he just wasn't getting the opportunity here." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the Braves also had run out of patience with Lilliquist. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got left-handed starters backed up throughout the organization," said 
Bobby Cox, Brave manager and general manager, "and sooner or later, we were 
going to have to do something to help the bullpen. We've got good reports on 
Grant, and we plan on using him to set up, and at the same time, use him as a 
closer." 
</P>
<P>
Lilliquist was the No. 6 pick in the 1987 draft and spent the 1989 season in 
the big leagues, posting an 8-10 record and 3.97 ERA. But when he struggled in 
the first two months of this season with a 2-8 record and 6.28 ERA, he was 
demoted to triple-A Richmond, never to return. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been some talk (between the teams)," said Jack McKeon, Padre vice 
president/baseball operations. "They were interested in Grant, and I told them 
I wanted Lilliquist. It's always a gamble, but the young kid has been in the 
big leagues, he's a left-hander and a good hitter." 
</P>
<P>
Lilliquist, 6 feet, 210 pounds, primarily is a breaking ball pitcher, with a 
fastball in the mid-80s. He yielded a .303 batting average this season, 
allowing 75 hits and 19 walks in 61 2/3 innings. He also allowed 10 home runs, 
the highest home-run ratio in the National League. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst part about the trade," said one Padre hitter, "is that we don't get 
to face him anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Lilliquist owns a 1-2 record and 6.41 ERA against the Padres. In his 
only appearance against them this season, he yielded nine hits and eight runs 
June 2 in a 9-0 Padre victory. 
</P>
<P>
But Lilliquist was 4-0 with a 2.57 ERA in five appearances at Richmond, showing 
signs of being able to pitch effectively in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll find out in a hurry," Riddoch said, "because we're going to be using 
him."

'QUICK CHANGE' MAKES FOR A GIDDY GETAWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The light comic wit of "Quick Change" (citywide) has a lovely premise: a trio 
of disillusioned New Yorkers, Grimm (Bill Murray), a city planner; his 
sweetheart Phyllis (Geena Davis) and Grimm's goofy, longtime friend and 
liability, Loomis (Randy Quaid), execute a brilliantly clever bank holdup, 
exiting with $1 million. Now all they have to do to be home free is get out of 
the city of New York, an urban obstacle course of unmarked streets, wayward 
freeway entrances and unfriendly natives. 
</P>
<P>
New Yorkers are chuckling already, the know-it-alls. But you don't need to live 
there to spot the pitfalls in the trio's starkly simple plan. The comedy of 
"Quick Change" is city-dweller humor, honed to a fine edge and site-specific to 
New York because the Big Apple is more or less on its knees, civility-wise. All 
it needs is a lethally funny comedy like this to give it the coup de grace. 
</P>
<P>
In love with each other and unable to take Manhattan -- any more in any form -- 
Grimm and Phyllis are decamping for reasons the movie makes abundantly clear: 
New York is a city gone a little bonkers. English-speaking cabbies are a 
memory; middle-class, multiple-burglary victims carry handguns the way others 
pack Tic-Tacs, and the best way to bum out the crowd swarming toward an 
accident scene is to announce that the victim might just live. 
</P>
<P>
With "Quick Change," screenwriter Howard Franklin and co-producer/star Bill 
Murray make their joint -- and auspicious -- debuts as directors. They excel at 
deadpan vignettes of the city, like the early scene when news of the ongoing 
bank robbery almost causes a collision between arriving SWAT units and arriving 
hot-dog push-carters, each jockeying for the commanding position. They also get 
nearly excruciating suspense from the correct-change-for-the-bus routine or the 
dithering frenzy of waiting behind a $100 customer at a mom-and-pop grocery 
store. "Quick Change," as well as Jay Cronley's very funny novel on which 
Franklin based his script, is full of snapshots like this. (It's eerie how 
close Franklin has stuck to Cronley's throw-away timing and sardonic humor 
while actually straying far from the novel's story line.) Then, just when we 
think we've got the movie's sardonic rhythms down pat, the filmmakers throw a 
little curve -- tongue-in-cheek reference to Tennessee Williams or Garcia Lorca 
or a surreal episode like the barrio jousters -- which lifts the material up, 
up and away beyond the expected. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, "Quick Change," which has been edited to whip by in record time, 
could use even more of these singular diversions; they're like the pure comic 
side of "After Hours' " semi-sinister Manhattan nightmares. Literate humor is 
at a premium and these actors, including Jason Robards' world-weary, 
underplayed police chief, are so intoxicatingly expert that it's almost sinful 
to have their film over as soon as it is. As their orderly exit plan crumbles 
around them, the unflappable Grimm becomes almost fiendishly good at bluffing 
their way out of mortal danger. Phyllis, on the other hand, has no stomach for 
such cliffhangers; her huge eyes get even bigger as she begins to envision the 
man she loves as a born desperado who has simply bloomed late. Ricocheting 
between them both is Randy Quaid's Loomis, whose hysteria bloomed early and 
surfaces often. However, considering that in the movie's last third Quaid is 
one of the walking wounded, dragging himself along like some comic parody of 
"The Night of the Living Dead," his panic is understandable. 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, all three are offbeat and wonderful characters in a movie whose 
visual and physical gags -- some of them as old as silent movies -- are as 
sharp as its dialogue, and whose cumulative effect is as achingly funny as "A 
Fish Called Wanda." At the same time, the humor doesn't have a smug or an 
inside feel to it, like the overflowing in-jokey references of "Gremlins 2." 
</P>
<P>
Produced by longtime Woody Allen cohort and Manhattan authority Robert 
Greenhut, richly photographed by Michael Chapman with succinct editing by Alan 
Heim, "Quick Change" (rated R for language) has a slyly understanding 
supporting cast, beginning with the garrulous bank guard played by Bob and 
Ray's Bob Elliott, Jack Gilpin's hateful yuppie hostage, Philip Bosco's 
punctilious bus driver, and Tony Shalhoub's monumentally funny cab driver, who 
very nearly turns himself inside out in an effort to make himself understood by 
an uncomprehending world. 
</P>
<P>
The film is dedicated to a longtime associate of Francois Truffaut, the late 
Helen Scott, who first brought the book to the filmmakers' attention. And so a 
cinematic lineage continues, tangibly and with bright results.

KIPLING RECONDITIONED IN WALT DISNEY'S 'THE JUNGLE BOOK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although its slapstick comedy, upbeat songs and polished animation made it one 
of the studio's most successful postwar features, "The Jungle Book" (opening 
today in re-release, citywide) is best known as the last animated film Walt 
Disney personally supervised. It premiered in October, 1967, 10 months after 
his death. 
</P>
<P>
Disney's artists took little more than the names of the characters from Rudyard 
Kipling's original stories. They transformed Mowgli (voice by Bruce 
Reitherman), the noble savage reared by wolves, into a rambunctious, 
all-American boy. The ancient, subtle Kaa (Sterling Holloway) became a sibilant 
buffoon with psychedelic eyes. Baloo, the dignified old bear who taught the Law 
of the Jungle to the animal cubs, was turned into a happy-go-lucky "two-bit 
jungle bum" with a shape like a half-filled Hefty bag and a voice by Phil 
Harris. 
</P>
<P>
"The Jungle Book" is not so much a great animated film as a film with great 
animated sequences. In "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" and "Pinocchio," every 
scene advances the story; in "Jungle Book," the story is reduced to a vehicle 
for characters' comic antics. 
</P>
<P>
Baloo's loose-limbed movements, coupled with Harris' vocal performance -- 
especially his jazzy rendition of "The Bare Necessities" -- are as entertaining 
today as they were 23 years ago. His jitterbug duet to "I Wanna Be Like You" 
with the frenetic orangutan, King Louie (Louie Prima), whose hands, arms, legs 
and eyes swivel in all directions, ranks among the funniest sequences in Disney 
animation. 
</P>
<P>
"Jungle Book" was one of the last films made by the crew Disney had begun 
assembling in the '30s, and the artists were clearly near the height of their 
talents. They make Kaa such an engaging presence, the audience doesn't realize 
that animating him presented enormous difficulties: A snake has no hands, arms 
or shoulders to use in gestures. (The artists cleverly solved the problem by 
using sections of his body to suggest limbs.) The affectionate relationship 
that develops between Mowgli and Baloo is delineated visually, through 
gestures, body language and expressions. 
</P>
<P>
The warmth of these characters contrasts effectively with the icy terror of 
Shere Khan, the tiger, (George Sanders, in one of his last roles). Mowgli's 
battle with Shere Khan, is a dramatic, David-and-Goliath confrontation, with a 
passel of shabby, Beatles-esque vultures providing comic relief. The film 
peters out after the battle: Bewitched by a lovely Indian girl, Mowgli gives up 
his jungle existence for life in the man-village too easily. The audience has 
seen the depth of his feelings for his animal friends, yet he casually abandons 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Although it lacks the emotional depth of "Bambi" and the visual opulence of 
"Fantasia," "The Jungle Book" remains a high-spirited romp that will delight 
children -- and parents weary of action films with body counts that exceed 
their box-office grosses. Just don't go expecting Kipling.

MAYE HAS GOTTEN HER ACT TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marilyn Maye's opening night set at the Vine St. Bar &amp; Grill was an object 
lesson in professionalism. After fortysomething years in the business, 
multitudinous appearances on television, and endless nightclub tracking across 
the country, the Kansas City-based singer clearly knows how to put an act 
together. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most attractive moments in her Wednesday night program were 
provided by the placement of songs in thematic medleys. "Paradise Cafe" was 
followed by "Breaking Up Is Hard To Do," followed by "Am I Blue?" and "I'll Be 
Around." Another grouping found a link between the sad disenchantment of 
"Something Cool" and the world-weariness of "Lush Life." Maye's still rich and 
vibrant voice worked these songs with consummate understanding of the lyrics 
and a warmly communicative sound. Her only problem was a tendency to squeeze a 
high decibel climax out of virtually every number. 
</P>
<P>
Maye frequently has been identified as a jazz singer (a curious association, 
since her career has mostly been associated with Broadway musical material, and 
her greatest strengths are with storytelling songs). But the occasional forays 
she made into pieces that called for rhythmic phrasing and fragments of scat 
singing -- "Take Five" and "Mountain Greenery" were typical examples -- too 
often sounded uncertain and contrived rather than loose and swinging. 
</P>
<P>
To her credit, Maye performed even the unsuccessful numbers with theatrical 
flair and grace. A slight refocusing of her act to emphasize the dramatic 
presentations she does so well, and diminish the less effective rhythm pieces, 
would add luster to her unquestioned professionalism. 
</P>
<P>
Maye, who was accompanied by the understated, but solidly supportive rhythm 
trio of John Rodby on piano, Andy Hall on bass and Mark Stevens on drums, 
continues at the Vine St. Bar &amp; Grill through Saturday night. DON HECKMAN

'MY UNCLE'S LEGACY' LOOKS AT THE EVIL EXCESSES OF COMMUNISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Krsto Papic's "My Uncle's Legacy" (at the Monica 4-Plex) has reportedly been 
simultaneously the most controversial and the most successful Yugoslavian film 
ever made. It's easy to see why on both counts: it unflinchingly confronts the 
evils of the Communist Party in the 1950s, wielding its power exultantly in the 
wake of Tito's triumphant break with Stalin. However, what Papic depicts in his 
and Ivan Aralica's adaptation of Aralica's novel "Framework of Hatred" couldn't 
seem more Stalinist in its rigidity and paranoia. 
</P>
<P>
The time is 1987. The camera picks up an elderly man in a bathrobe and pajamas 
shuffling across a stately Zagreb square. He makes his way to the book-strewn 
apartment of his nephew, a prominent middle-aged writer, and asks for a glass 
of water. What he is really asking for is forgiveness of the younger man, whom 
he has not seen in 36 years. He also asks that a priest officiate at his 
funeral, a scandalous request for a man who has been a top party official. 
</P>
<P>
We then flash back to 1951, to a rural community a mere four miles from the 
Italian border. The uncle (Miodrag Krivokapic) is already a party leader, 
coping on the one hand with a father (Fabijan Sovagovic) who resists the 
collectivization of the family farm and, on the other, with his nephew Martin 
(Davor Janjic), an outspoken independent thinker and talented caricaturist who 
is a student at a small teachers' college. 
</P>
<P>
Although Yugoslavia's preeminent younger director Emir Kusturica has called 
Papic's film "brilliant," do not expect the passion and vitality that mark 
Kusturica's films, especially his Oscar-nominated "When Father Was Away on 
Business," which is set in the late '40s as Tito was still struggling to 
establish his independence from Stalin. Both directors skewer Communist Party 
excesses, but in Kusturica's film there is a broader perspective, a greater 
willingness to forgive. Although there is some warmth, humor and even a little 
sex in "My Uncle's Legacy," it is fundamentally a somber, angry, implacable 
indictment and settling of scores, and understandably so: born in 1933, Papic, 
a distinguished veteran filmmaker, is the same age as Martin. (Kusturica was 
born in 1955.) 
</P>
<P>
Education at the teachers' college is basically a business of heavyhanded 
communist indoctrination from a principal and faculty dedicated to ferreting 
out and punishing the slightest deviation from the party line. It is a place 
where Martin, who is involved in a budding romance with the beautiful Martha 
(Alma Prica), is inevitably headed for trouble. It's no matter that he actually 
tries to subscribe to the teachings of his uncle, who has raised him; he's so 
questioning that he's vulnerable to being charged with anti-revolutionary acts 
he has not in fact committed. 
</P>
<P>
Only 17 when the film was shot, Davor Janjic gives a remarkably adult 
performance, intense and concentrated, and his fellow actors are on a par with 
him. "My Uncle's Legacy" (Times-rated Mature) is impressive but bleak, evoking 
tragedy and loss more than forgiveness and reconciliation.

SAN PEDRO'S CAFE NOIR: FOOD -- AND WIT AND WISDOM TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cafe Noir is a clever place, starting with the name -- "black coffee" (it's a 
coffee-bean shop as well as a cafe). Cunning pyramidal tents, mottled in pink 
and gray, hang from its ceiling. And the tiny menu is sometimes very, very 
clever. On occasion, it has offered a choice of green salad or a soup of pureed 
lettuces. 
</P>
<P>
In what is either the cream of the jest or a reckless gamble, however, it has 
stuck itself in an isolated shopping mall in San Pedro -- the northernmost one 
of a string of malls that lie in the shadow of Rancho Palos Verdes. The 
neighborhood had better like Cafe Noir, because the outside world rarely 
wanders down here. 
</P>
<P>
Physically, Cafe Noir is a spacious place in the traditional gleaming white and 
black of coffee-bean shops, with a display kitchen along the back wall. The 
effect is informal and really quite pleasant, though something is going to have 
to be done about the glare at sunset. And of course you can get good coffee at 
Cafe Noir, to say nothing of apricot-flavored tea. 
</P>
<P>
The ultra-eclectic menu changes on some unclear basis. The first time I went, 
the word June was written in one corner; the next time, the dishes had changed 
very slightly and the menu no longer committed itself to a month. One thing's 
sure: This is not shopping-mall stuff. 
</P>
<P>
To start, there are those soup-or-salad greens: The green salad is the classic 
California mixture of fresh baby lettuces in a tarragon vinaigrette. The 
mixed-green soup is butter lettuce, iceberg lettuce, romaine and spinach, 
pureed and mixed with stock; it has a pretty, light-green color flecked with 
darker green, and a flavor like very mild cream of spinach. The idea is not 
insane, either -- people used to cook lettuces all the time, and a crouton 
topped with blue cheese handles all the desire for strong flavors you might 
have. 
</P>
<P>
There is also a sort of carpaccio of cured salmon on the appetizer list, 
sprinkled with chopped endive and candied lemon zest. I really prefer the 
scallops with cucumber noodles, though. These are fresh, barely cooked sea 
scallops in a butter sauce enlivened with salty Chinese fermented black beans. 
Cucumber noodles means that julienned cucumber is sauteed and mixed with 
tomato, garlic and Parmesan as if it were pasta; it has a squishy texture and a 
sweet flavor faintly like squash, and it's really pretty enjoyable. 
</P>
<P>
The New York steak comes with zucchini noodles, which are similar, and 
so-called shoestring potatoes, which are really just thinnish French fries, 
though surprisingly good. The steak itself is fried quite brown on the surface, 
probably deep-fried, producing a curious effect a little like pork chops. It 
comes with some meaty veal glaze and an unnecessary pat of herb butter. 
</P>
<P>
This kitchen enjoys undercooking things, which means it does wonders with fish. 
There is an excellent swordfish, moist and just barely cooked, that is served 
with mushrooms and zucchini wrapped with Italian unsmoked bacon and grilled on 
little bamboo skewers (the rich, mild sauce is a sort of mayonnaise). Salmon 
tournedos is a big round cut of salmon, easily 3 inches high, which has an 
inexplicably luscious flavor, probably a matter of not drying out in cooking. 
It comes with a little bit of tomato stewed with fresh ginger and some grilled 
Japanese eggplant with rich soy sauce. 
</P>
<P>
A double-ribbed pork chop is huge, topped with mixed julienne vegetables and 
surrounded with an orange peel-flavored sauce. Here the taste for the underdone 
is Cafe Noir's undoing, because the sliced potato served with it is 
provocatively undercooked, so chewy you'd think it was jicama. The texture is 
novel, but let's be serious: Underdone potato has scarcely any flavor. 
</P>
<P>
The same nearly raw potatoes make problems for the grilled chicken breast, 
which has the additional handicap of a tapenade topping (basically an olive 
puree) that is scarcely tasteable and a tomato coulis sauce that doesn't amount 
to much more than an orange color on the plate. 
</P>
<P>
There are a couple of pastas, including a quite good fusion-cuisine model 
flavored with olive oil, soy sauce, green onions and fried shiitake mushrooms. 
The pizzette are simple but quite good thin-crust pizzas, topped with either 
Gorgonzola and prosciutto or a mixture of four loud Italian cheeses. 
</P>
<P>
Dessert has a pleasantly homemade aspect. The almond-coated carrot cake is not 
the loose-textured, mile-high commercial type, and the chocolate mousse has the 
cocoa-heavy flavor of many a home mousse. Fresh fruit, however, tends to get 
some exotic addition like mango puree. 
</P>
<P>
Clever, all devilishly clever. I hope Cafe Noir's whimsy about where to locate 
itself doesn't turn out too clever for its own good. 
</P>
<P>
 Cafe Noir, 28098 S. Western Ave., San Pedro, (213) 832-9860. Lunch and dinner,

TIME WARNER SUED BY PATHE OVER LOAN FOR MGM/UA DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pathe Communications Corp. sued Time Warner Inc. for $500 million in Los 
Angeles Superior Court late Thursday, charging that the New York media giant 
reneged on an agreement to loan Pathe $650 million toward the purchase of 
MGM/UA Communications Co. 
</P>
<P>
Pathe's suit accuses Time Warner of breach of contract, fraud, interference 
with contractual relationship and unfair competition. It also denies the claims 
of contractual violations made by Time Warner in a $100-million suit filed 
against Pathe 13 days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Pathe's attorneys contend that Time Warner backed out of the MGM/UA deal 
without just cause. The suit alleges that Pathe fully abided by its agreement 
to bankroll half of the $1.2-billion price for MGM/UA, but that Time Warner 
later decided it wanted out of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
The suit further claims that Time Warner sought to change the terms of the 
purchase agreement significantly after it was unable to find a bank willing to 
fund the $650-million loan. 
</P>
<P>
From its corporate headquarters, Time Warner issued a blistering response to 
the suit, taking special aim at Pathe co-founders Giancarlo Parretti and Florio 
Fiorini. 
</P>
<P>
"Pathe's cross-complaint is just its latest attempt to divert attention from 
the facts -- which are that Pathe breached its April, 1990, agreement with Time 
Warner, its theatrical distribution agreement with Warner Bros. and a 
video-rights distribution agreement with Warner Home Video," the company 
stated. 
</P>
<P>
"We intend to schedule the deposition of Messrs. Parretti and Fiorini 
immediately. We are confident that their depositions will expose how Pathe 
conducted itself in this matter and demonstrate who is telling the truth about 
what happened. The deposition will certainly prove who was unable to come up 
with the money." 
</P>
<P>
Time Warner's withdrawal forced Pathe to obtain a four-month extension on its 
acquisition of MGM/UA, as it desperately seeks another financial backer. Pathe 
agreed to raise the price of the acquisition to $21.50 a share from $20, adding 
another $100 million to the cost. As part of the revised deal, stockholders 
will be paid $4 per share on July 20. 
</P>
<P>
The stalemate between the former deal-mates has generated widespread skepticism 
over Pathe's ability to complete the transaction. But Pathe Co-President 
Parretti reportedly told a Paris press conference Monday that he intends to 
close the acquisition by Sept. 21, a month ahead of time. Parretti did not say 
where he will find the backing needed to accomplish his goal, however. 
</P>
<P>
In its June 29 lawsuit against Pathe, Time Warner accused Pathe of violating 
the agreement that the two sides reached in April. Time Warner charged that 
Pathe acted as if the agreement "gave Pathe a one-way option to decide which of 
its obligations it would honor, which Time Warner rights it could ignore and 
which conditions it would satisfy." In particular, Time Warner said Pathe's 
Parretti sold video and film rights twice, to both Time Warner and MGM/UA. 
</P>
<P>
In its counterclaim, Pathe contends that Time Warner tried to change the terms 
of the loan because it was unhappy with existing contractual restrictions on 
the United Artists film library. Time Warner was to receive the library as 
collateral for its financing. 
</P>
<P>
Pathe said Time Warner failed to help it find a $200-million loan to fund 
production costs, as agreed to, and refused to accept an independent valuation 
of the Pathe/Cannon film libraries, insisted on other conditions Pathe could 
not meet and "knowingly put Pathe at risk of losing" a $200-million 
non-refundable deposit made to MGM/UA. 
</P>
<P>
In an attached submission, Pathe also formally denied all of the assertions 
made against it in Time Warner's suit.

GTE TO ACQUIRE CONTEL, FORMING A PHONE GIANT; 
</P>
<P>
TELECOMMUNICATIONS: THE STOCK SWAP DEAL IS WORTH $6.3 BILLION. THE RESULT WILL 
BE AMERICA'S LARGEST LOCAL PHONE COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
GTE Corp. and Contel Corp., two of the nation's largest telephone carriers, 
said Thursday they tentatively agreed to merge and create a global 
telecommunications giant with a presence in virtually every aspect of the 
burgeoning industry. 
</P>
<P>
The deal calls for Stamford, Conn.-based GTE, whose far-flung U.S. operations 
include some local telephone service in Southern California, to acquire 
Atlanta-based Contel through a stock swap valued at about $6.3 billion. The 
proposed acquisition, one of the largest ever in the industry, extends a recent 
spate of telecommunications takeovers that were previously confined mainly to 
long-distance carriers. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by stockholders as well as federal and numerous state regulators, 
the new company would become the largest U.S.-based provider of local telephone 
service -- with more than 17.7 million customers in 40 states and throughout 
the world -- and the nation's second-largest cellular carrier. 
</P>
<P>
The combined company, to be known as GTE and operated by its current managers, 
also would have significant satellite, foreign, computer and government 
contracting operations, in addition to a strong presence in the emerging market 
for fiber-optic telecommunications service. 
</P>
<P>
It is a "perfect combination of two great companies," GTE Chairman James L. 
(Rocky) Johnson said of the deal that insiders say had been brewing for weeks. 
"This alliance will both position the company strategically and enable us to 
exploit more fully the many opportunities for growth." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a play for the future," said Jack Grubman, a telecommunications 
analyst with Paine Webber in New York. "Five years from now telephone lines 
will carry far more information than they do now and telephone companies will 
be far different. GTE is buying technology, not a utility." 
</P>
<P>
GTE will issue 1.27 shares of its common stock in a tax-free exchange for each 
Contel common share. 
</P>
<P>
Contel's stock shot up on the news, gaining $7.125 per share Thursday to close 
at $35.125 on the New York Stock Exchange. However, GTE's stock slipped $1.25 
to close at $29.75, showing some concerns about the sizable merger price. 
</P>
<P>
Although the deal would put the new GTE ahead of its regional Baby Bell 
competitors, analysts speculated that the merger could provide additional 
ammunition to ongoing efforts by the seven Baby Bells to loosen federal 
regulatory and judicial constraints on their operations. 
</P>
<P>
"This puts a whole new light on things, and it could make it easier for the 
regional Bells to win approval to do friendly mergers with independent 
communications companies," said Kenneth Leon, a telecommunications analyst at 
Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The new company would knock Bell Atlantic out as the country's largest local 
service company. Further, the new company would surpass Pacific Telesis as the 
nation's second-largest cellular telephone operator, with franchises to serve 
areas with a potential of 50 million customers. Only McCaw Cellular, with 62 
million potential customers, has a larger cellular business. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, GTE has been conducting an ambitious experiment in 
fiber-optic telecommunications service in Cerritos. It has wired portions of 
the city using combinations of fiber-optic and coaxial cable and digital and 
analog switches. The project is designed to prepare for the day, long expected 
by GTE executives, when telephone companies are allowed to compete with cable 
TV franchisers in piping video into the home.

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / S.J. DIAMOND: PARENTS MAY HAVE TO JUDGE IF FUN-RIDE SAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Hurtling at speeds up to 55 m.p.h.," says one ad, Magic Mountain's Revolution 
roller coaster will "shoot you through a 144-foot tunnel" and "turn you 
topsy-turvy in a 360-degree vertical loop." Sounds like a heck of a ride. 
</P>
<P>
There's one requirement: Riders must be "at least 42 inches to ride." This 
means that 4-year-olds are welcome, as they are on the 10-story "FreeFall," the 
50-foot slide into a 20-foot "Tidal Wave." A 48-inch child (7 or 8) can hop on 
all but one of Magic Mountain's "spine-tingling" rides, and the park's not 
unique. Even Disneyland invites a 40-inch child (3 years old?), if accompanied, 
to take Space Mountain's in-the-dark roller coaster, or Splash Mountain's 
five-story, 47-degree plunge. 
</P>
<P>
This doesn't seem right. Even if the given safety restraints can secure bodies 
that size (the basis of height designations), are such rides really appropriate 
for small children? "A lot of kids come off these rides hysterical," says 
Joseph Greensher, a Mineola, N.Y., pediatrician who is past chairman of the 
American Academy of Pediatrics' accident- and poison-prevention committee. 
"It's like parents throwing them in the air: They scream not with glee but with 
fear." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, park rides are meant to be frightening, suggestive of danger. But the 
possibility of actual danger is a touchy subject. Parks are "like airlines," 
says Knott's Berry Farm spokesman Stuart Zanville. "You know the rides are 
safe; you don't want people questioning them." 
</P>
<P>
As with airlines, accidents are infrequent -- maybe "two injuries per 100,000 
guests, and usually minor," says Harold Hudson, vice president of engineering 
for Six Flags corporation in Arlington, Tex. "But if you have an accident, it's 
big news -- like an airline crash." 
</P>
<P>
They do happen. According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, 6,500 
injuries from amusement park rides ended up in emergency rooms last year. Half 
were suffered at fixed-site parks, half at mobile fairs and carnivals. 
Furthermore, analysis of some 90 ride-related deaths between 1973 and 1988 
indicated that whirling rides and roller coasters were most often involved. 
</P>
<P>
In these stories, and other news reports over the years, mechanical failure was 
sometimes the cause. There were terrifying stories of people falling or being 
thrown out when seating compartments broke off their supports, or cars 
derailing or colliding, or doors becoming unlatched. In some cases, operators 
made tragic mistakes, usually involving restraints that weren't properly 
locked. 
</P>
<P>
Rider behavior often caused or contributed to the tragedy. People stood up in 
mid-ride or tried to change seats. Teen-agers climbed towers, walked 
guardrails, rocked gondolas; children slipped out of their restraints. 
</P>
<P>
Even if regulation could anticipate all accidents, regulation has been spotty. 
The CPSC regulates only mobile carnivals, and it doesn't do that very much. 
With neither "the staff nor the money for periodic checks and inspections," 
says CPSC compliance officer James DeMarco, its work is "only reactive," 
meaning it investigates after a tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
Some 37 states do inspect amusement park operations, with variable stringency, 
but sometimes, again, the inspections apply only to mobile parks. Local 
authorities are the ones most likely to review plans for fixed construction. 
They may, as in Los Angeles County (home of Magic Mountain), inspect regularly 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
But built-in safety depends on the designers, manufacturers and operators, with 
safety restraints only the final, most obvious factor, varied according to the 
ride. With flumes and water rides, seating riders low in the boat is considered 
containment enough. Standard roller coasters, however speedy, generally have 
lap bars. 
</P>
<P>
More encompassing restraints, coming down over the shoulders and chest, are 
needed for upside-down rides, including today's bendable-steel "looping" 
coasters. The pioneering Corkscrew at Knott's (1975) had two rolls. Magic 
Mountain's Viper takes the rider upside-down seven times -- one two-roll 
corkscrew, three loops (360-degree arcs) and one two-parabola boomerang. 
</P>
<P>
Because centrifugal force presses riders into their seats when a coaster goes 
upside-down, restraints are "not designed to let the rider hang in the seat," 
says Dal Freeman, director of engineering at Arrow Dynamics in Clearfield, 
Utah. It has designed rides ranging from Disney's Matterhorn to the Viper, but 
in a way that gives riders "something to hold on to" and keeps them properly 
positioned. 
</P>
<P>
Such restraints are consciously designed for unlikely situations, "assuming 
something's going to go slower (than expected) or something's going to go 
wrong," says Hudson. But no system can guard against everything, including the 
fact that a rider "could get out on almost any ride," says Dave Omel, 
operations manager for Disneyland's Adventureland/Frontierland. 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland's rule, therefore, is that "someone under 7 needs to be accompanied, 
on all attractions," says Omel. On certain rides, adds Hudson, "they may need 
someone to assist them getting on or off, or to be moral or mental support," or 
just help them exercise control. 
</P>
<P>
That someone can also supply a judgment of whether a child can take the ride, 
and safely. "It's difficult for us as amusement park operators to make that 
judgment," says Hudson. 
</P>
<P>
They can, however, make it clear that posted height limits don't really 
guarantee that the ride's appropriate for everyone that size. Parks could 
provide recommendations there as well, knowing as they do which rides are most 
"thrilling" -- highest, fastest, most jolting. People who don't know the ride, 
or don't know children, may need to be told when parental guidance is needed.

HARDLY STODGY, THIS THRIFT HAD UZIS, ENGLISH BUTLER; 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;LS: PROBES OF COLUMBIA S&amp;L AND ITS FORMER CHIEF, THOMAS SPIEGEL, ALSO 
UNVEIL BOMB SHELTERS, BODYGUARDS AND JETS.

<P>
Many strange tales have surfaced in the nation's thrift debacle. Those of 
Columbia Savings &amp; Loan and former chief executive Thomas Spiegel may top 
them all. 
</P>
<P>
Take Spiegel's obsession with security. Columbia's still-unfinished 
headquarters building in Beverly Hills comes equipped with two anti-terrorist 
bomb shelters. A $9-million hangar at the Van Nuys Airport built for Columbia's 
corporate jets included an electronic map that showed recent terrorist activity 
throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
Spiegel and his family at times had 19 security personnel protecting them, some 
assigned to "chase cars" loaded with automatic weapons that would trail Spiegel 
whenever he rode through the streets of Beverly Hills. Columbia collected an 
arsenal of weapons that included more than 100 rifles, shotguns, assault 
weapons and Uzi submachine guns, prompting some executives to joke that the 
thrift's deposits were insured by "Smith &amp; Wesson and Uzi" and to suggest 
that its name should be changed to "Colombia Savings &amp; Loan." 
</P>
<P>
The James Bond-like security measures, extraordinary by any corporate 
standards, are just a few of the eye-popping details about Spiegel's 13-year 
reign at Columbia that are only now surfacing. The revelations, the result of 
an internal investigation, a government probe and interviews with former 
Columbia employees, portray a thrift where spending ran amok. The allegations 
are especially ironic in view of the fact that Columbia for years boasted in 
television commercials that surveys showed it was the best-managed savings and 
loan in America. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia was lionized as an example of deregulation unshackling S&amp;Ls. 
Chicago real estate deal-maker Sam Zell once said that "if the entire S&amp;L 
business had been run by guys like Tom Spiegel, then this country would be a 
couple of hundred billion bucks richer." 
</P>
<P>
But civil allegations filed last week by the federal Office of Thrift 
Supervision accuse Spiegel of using the thrift -- and its taxpayer-insured 
deposits -- as his personal piggy bank. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a case of great importance. In money terms, it is the largest case," 
said Harris Weinstein, chief lawyer for the OTS. 
</P>
<P>
All told, regulators allege, Spiegel went on a $19-million spending spree that 
included such abuses as buying the guns, taking personal trips on Columbia's 
corporate jet, extensive use of Columbia-owned condominiums in Wyoming, Utah 
and California, and even buying $7,840 in Michael Jackson concert tickets. 
Regulators are seeking $24 million from Spiegel, including a $5-million fine. 
They also are seeking to bar him from the thrift business for life. 
</P>
<P>
Papers filed by the OTS last week show a bizarre tug of war between Spiegel and 
Columbia's current management over the $55,000 in guns. Of the approximately 
100 guns, Spiegel allegedly is refusing to turn over 55, including four rifles, 
18 revolvers, 24 automatic pistols and nine shotguns. Forty of the guns are 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
Spiegel denies the allegations and vows to fight them. In a statement, he said 
he is being made a scapegoat by inept federal regulators. He accuses them of 
conducting a "trial by press release" without allowing him to tell his story. 
</P>
<P>
Spiegel, 44, has declined to publicly address the specific charges. He declined 
to comment for this article. In a recent deposition he refused to answer 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
But New York criminal defense lawyer Robert G. Morvillo, who represents him, 
said the expenditures will be shown to have been made for legitimate business 
purposes. Morvillo said the government also is ignoring the fact that, at the 
time most of the expenditures were made, Columbia was one of the nation's 
strongest and most profitable thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
As for the security measures, he said, Spiegel was one of the nation's most 
visible and highest-paid executives at the time, so such concerns were 
justified. Finally, he said, some Spiegel expenses were legitimate, but may 
have lacked proper documentation. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever you get a guy who was as busy as he was, you rely on other people to 
get the paper work done. I can't say the paper work in all cases got done, but 
the spirit in which he conducted himself was at all times proper," Morvillo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Much is riding on the Spiegel case. Thrift regulators have elevated him to the 
big leagues of alleged S&amp;L abusers -- with the likes of Charles H. Keating 
Jr., former head of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine, and David L. Paul, 
former head of CenTrust Bank in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Spiegel charges come as regulators are being criticized for moving 
too slowly against S&amp;L abusers, although Weinstein denied that the 
criticism influenced the timing of the Spiegel announcement. The OTS 
investigation could lead to criminal charges against Spiegel. Morvillo said he 
believes that the agency's findings have already been forwarded to prosecutors 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia, still controlled by Spiegel and his family, is hanging by a thread to 
independence. Its net worth was wiped out over the past year after it suffered 
$1 billion in losses in its risky junk bonds. In the 1980s, the bonds made 
Columbia, the biggest buyer of junk bonds among thrifts, wildly profitable. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia's only hope of preventing a federal takeover is selling its bonds. 
This Monday, it will formally accept bids from eight prospective buyers for the 
bonds, worth about $3 billion now. The list, outside sources familiar with the 
transaction said, include several well-financed groups, including the New York 
banking firm Bankers Trust; Loews Corp.; the Pritzker family of Chicago; a 
group led by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce; the Los Angeles financial 
services firm Broad Inc., and one group that includes the investment firm 
Odyssey Partners, banking giant Citicorp and the Wall Street firm Salomon Bros. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia Savings was formed in 1974 by Spiegel's father, Abraham, who still 
serves as Columbia's chairman. Thomas Spiegel, Abraham's second son, became 
president and chief executive in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, Columbia, like most thrifts, faced the prospect of going 
out of business because high interest rates meant it paid more for funds than 
it got back in return by making loans. But deregulation in 1982 allowed thrifts 
to place taxpayer-insured deposits into nontraditional investments such as real 
estate and junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Spiegel figured that he could attract deposits from sophisticated Wall Street 
investors by paying exceptionally high rates, then invest the money in junk 
bonds to earn an even more exceptional return. This "spread" between the two 
rates for a while made Columbia a money machine. 
</P>
<P>
Forbes magazine at one point published a statistical-based survey that called 
Columbia the top-managed thrift in the nation. Columbia made that claim the 
cornerstone of its advertising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The key influence on Spiegel this time was Michael Milken, the former Drexel 
Burnham Lambert junk bond whiz whom Spiegel met at a party. Columbia became one 
of Drexel's best customers, and Spiegel and Milken became close friends. 
</P>
<P>
The relationship extended to a partnership formed to buy a luxury Gulfstream 
IV, and build the airplane hangar at Van Nuys. Spiegel frequently used the jet 
to fly to Palm Springs 100 miles away for weekend getaways at a Columbia 
condominium in Indian Wells that he is alleged to have used exclusively. He has 
claimed the trips were to check on a Columbia development project in Indian 
Wells. 
</P>
<P>
In another case, Spiegel allegedly spent $250,000 having Columbia's jet sent to 
London to fetch him and take him to Switzerland. He has claimed that the jet 
brought annual reports and slides to potential Swiss investors. In one case, 
regulators assert, Columbia designated a condominium in a ski area of Wyoming 
for the exclusive use of Milken and his brother, Lowell. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, when Columbia was among the nation's most profitable thrifts, Spiegel 
earned a staggering $9 million -- nearly 20 times what other major thrift chief 
executives earned. Spiegel's huge paychecks irked regulators, who forced him to 
give back $600,000 of his $3-million bonus in 1988. Regulators last week filed 
actions to force him to give back the remaining $2.4 million, saying Columbia's 
lackluster profits that year did not warrant such a bonus. 
</P>
<P>
It was about this time that Spiegel apparently began showing concerns about his 
security. Some acquaintances believe that Spiegel may have felt vulnerable to 
attacks by anti-Semitic groups because of his family's support for Jewish 
causes. He and his wife Helene each took shooting lessons, and inventory 
records of Columbia's guns show that many were kept in safes in Spiegel's 
Beverly Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
As Spiegel rode the junk bond wave, his political influence grew. He gave 
generously to politicians. Former House Majority Whip Tony Coelho (D-Merced) 
resigned after disclosures about a $50,000 Spiegel-arranged loan that allowed 
him to buy a $100,000 junk bond. And Abraham has long enjoyed close ties to 
Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
As Columbia's profits grew, spending was lavish. Columbia employed an English 
butler and a martial arts instructor. It rented a Beverly Hills apartment for a 
relatively low-level assistant who balked at relocating here from New York, 
picking up the tab when she wanted to fly home. 
</P>
<P>
According to government papers, Spiegel spent $2,205 on tips alone during two 
trips to Europe in 1988 and 1989, and ran up a $2,197 hotel and room-service 
bill for a four-night stay for him and his wife at London's Dorchester Hotel in 
1987. Other alleged expenditures of Columbia money included $4,876 for towels, 
$5,290 for Pratesi cashmere throws and $738 for two cases of wine. 
</P>
<P>
Some former Columbia executives say Spiegel often gave expensive gifts to 
clients or business associates. The Michael Jackson tickets, they say, were 
given to investment bankers or business school graduates that Columbia was 
recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
But OTS attorney Weinstein says the alleged expenses were for the personal 
benefit of Spiegel and his friends, not for any corporate purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Bonuses were generous as well. Last year, Columbia lost nearly $600 million. 
Still, it paid top executives $4 million in bonuses, including one executive 
who received $1.2 million even though his job -- to arrange financing deals -- 
was rendered moot by federal legislation last year. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was Columbia's new corporate headquarters, a $55-million white 
elephant that has been behind schedule and plagued by huge cost overruns. In 
addition to the bomb shelters, the office featured limestone walls, 
stainless-steel floors and two kitchens, one to have been used by Spiegel and 
another for his father. 
</P>
<P>
To outsiders, the thrift was run by a group of seven relatively young 
executives, dubbed "partners," who worked as a team. In reality, Spiegel called 
the shots, frequently unnerving executives with his unorthodox style. 
</P>
<P>
One management method Spiegel used frequently was something former executives 
jokingly called an "est" style, referring to the self-help Erhard Seminars 
Training theories popular in the 1970s. Inspired by a company psychologist used 
by Drexel, Spiegel would ask an employee to confide in him what he or she 
thought of another executive. He then would share those comments with the 
executive he had asked about. Former executives say it caused bitter feelings 
among many, who thought it was divisive and promoted back-stabbing. 
</P>
<P>
Those in Spiegel's favor clearly wielded more power. Those who did not left 
under bitter terms. That happened when Spiegel attempted to discipline Columbia 
and turn it into more of a traditional thrift by hiring banker Lawrence K. Fish 
in 1988 as his second in command. Fish lasted less than two years, resigning 
last fall. 
</P>
<P>
The public story was that Fish quit because in reorganizing Columbia he had 
effectively eliminated his own job. But company insiders say Fish alienated the 
other partners. In one case, Columbia's real estate head exploded when Fish 
questioned the need to buy about $25,000 in computer equipment. Ultimately, top 
executives bypassed Fish, who found no support from Spiegel. Fish, who did not 
return calls seeking comment, now heads troubled Bank of New England in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
About the time Fish resigned, three things happened that put Columbia and 
Spiegel in the jam they are in today. 
</P>
<P>
Congress passed last year's massive thrift-reform package, requiring S&amp;Ls 
such as Columbia to sell their junk bonds in five years. Ironically, junk bond 
guru Milken sensed a shift in the political winds and urged Spiegel to sell the 
bonds well before the thrift bailout bill passed. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the junk bond market collapsed. Because Columbia had to sell 
its bonds, accounting rules required it to recognize its bond losses 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
But junk bonds weren't Columbia's only problem. Some were due to bad deals. 
Columbia sunk $70 million into the Hyatt Newporter in Newport Beach, which it 
is trying to unload now. Real estate experts believe Columbia will be lucky to 
get half that price. In addition, Columbia faces major losses on problem office 
developments in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
As Columbia's losses mounted, Spiegel's spending habits came under scrutiny. 
When Fish left, two senior executives initiated an internal investigation. 
Ironically, it was Spiegel who tipped off regulators about this internal probe; 
that in turn prompted the government to launch its own investigation. 
</P>
<P>
In November, Spiegel's top executives told him he should resign. They feared he 
might be indicted for his role in buying bonds from Milken, and that regulators 
might seize Columbia if he didn't leave. Spiegel stepped down at the end of 
December, but remained as a consultant. He later cut virtually all of his ties 
to Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
Junk bonds have recovered part of their values in recent weeks. Columbia could 
conceivably sell them at a healthy price and even regain its solvency if it 
gets attractive bids next week. That would at least save taxpayers from having 
to bail out the thrift. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, government actions against Spiegel could take years. In any event, 
it's unlikely that Spiegel will be taking any shopping sprees soon. Most of his 
spending these days is on lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE UNRAVELING OF COLUMBIA SAVINGS 
</P>
<P>
1985 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Spiegel receives $9.03 million in compensation, making him the 
third-highest-paid corporate executive in the United States and the 
highest-paid savings and loan executive in the history of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
After two years of fighting regulators who called the payment "unreasonable," 
Spiegel was allowed to keep the money. But his salary would be subject to 
review by outside experts in the future to ensure that it is not excessive. 
</P>
<P>
Although his salary was much less in subsequent years, Spiegel continued to be 
the industry's best-paid executive. 
</P>
<P>
1987 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 3: Columbia Savings posts peak earnings of $194 million in 1986 -- 
primarily because of its investments in junk bonds -- prompting Forbes magazine 
to rate the company as the best-managed major savings and loan in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 28: Citing the stock market crash, Columbia says it stands to lose $25 
million in the fourth quarter of 1987, the first sign of trouble at the company 
that advertised itself as a rock-solid financial institution. 
</P>
<P>
1988 
</P>
<P>
May 11: Losses on securities sales resulting from writedowns in its bond 
portfolio contribute to a 95% dive in first-quarter earnings from the same 
period in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
1989 
</P>
<P>
May 27: Former House Majority Whip Tony Coelho says he will resign rather than 
face a House probe into his personal finances. Coelho failed to disclose a 
$50,000 loan from Columbia used to help purchase a $100,000 junk bond on Thomas 
Spiegel's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 28: A federal grand jury in Los Angeles opens a criminal investigation 
into the personal finances of Mayor Tom Bradley, including his association with 
the Spiegel family and Columbia Savings. 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 31: Thomas Spiegel resigns as chairman, chief executive, president and 
director of Columbia. Spiegel had been president and chief executive since 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
1990 
</P>
<P>
March 12: Edward G. Harshfield is named chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
March 14: Harshfield announces plans to sell the thrift's $3.5-billion junk 
bond portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
April 1: Columbia Savings says it is insolvent, after losing $575 million from 
October, 1989, through February, 1990. The thrift had posted losses of $591 
million for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
July 5: The Office of Thrift Supervision files civil charges against Thomas 
Spiegel for improperly diverting $19 million of the thrift's funds and seeks a 
$5-million fine from Spiegel for "recklessly and knowingly" causing loses to 
Columbia Savings. Regulators also want Spiegel to repay an additional $2.4 
million plus interest of his 1989 $2.8-million bonus, saying the bonus was 
unjustified. Spiegel had earlier returned $600,000 of his bonus to Columbia.

FRENCH FIRM TO ACQUIRE MOTEL 6 FOR $1.3 BILLION; 
</P>
<P>
MERGER: THE DEAL WILL CREATE THE WORLD'S LARGEST CHAIN OF BUDGET MOTELS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Motel 6, the popular resting spot for budget-conscious American travelers, has 
agreed to be acquired by the French hotel chain Accor in a $1.3-billion deal 
that would create the world's largest group of budget motels, the firms 
announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Though the news was not announced until well after the stock market closed, 
rumors of the impending deal sent Motel 6's market value soaring on the New 
York Stock Exchange. Motel 6, a publicly traded limited partnership, closed at 
a 52-week high of $19.75, up $2.625 per partnership unit. 
</P>
<P>
Accor said it planned a tender offer of $22.50 for each of the publicly traded 
partnership units. The offer is scheduled to begin next week and, according to 
Accor, financing has already been arranged. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50% of the units are owned by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the New York 
investment firm that spearheaded a leveraged buyout of Motel 6 in 1985. 
According to Wall Street sources, KKR's investors stand to more than quadruple 
their investment if the sale goes through. 
</P>
<P>
A sale would combine one of the best-known names in American lodging with a 
worldwide firm that has more than 850 hotels and nearly 3,000 restaurants in 60 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
Accor's operations include the fast-growing Formula 1 budget hotels in Europe 
as well as Sofitel, its luxury chain, and Novotel and Mercure, which cater to 
business travelers. Accor estimates that it will earn nearly $150 million in 
1990 on sales of more than $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the perfect marriage," said Burland B. East III, financial analyst for 
the brokerage of Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles. "They (Accor) 
have gone out and bought an operating company, and they're going to run it. . . 
. This is an old-fashioned business deal." 
</P>
<P>
Dallas-based Motel 6 became a success with travelers by offering rates that 
average about $25 a night, well below most of its competition. It is well-known 
for its catchy advertising slogan: "We'll leave the light on for you." 
</P>
<P>
Motel 6, which has expanded rapidly in recent years, expects to have 554 motels 
by the end of 1990, up from 378 motels in 1985. Many are located along highways 
and freeways of the western United States. 
</P>
<P>
The lodging firm has 140 motels in California, by far the largest concentration 
in the United States. Texas has 61, Arizona 24, New Mexico 17, Florida 17 and 
Washington 15. Most of the properties are company owned and operated. 
</P>
<P>
Motel 6 was a subsidiary of City Investing until it was acquired in the 
leveraged buyout five years ago. In October, 1986, the new owners held an 
initial public offering at $13.50 a unit that raised more than $75 million. 
</P>
<P>
Motel 6 has said it expects to have operating profit of $220 million in 1990 on 
sales of $475 million.

'BOILER ROOM' CON ARTISTS USE CRACKS IN LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fraudulent telephone marketers, who bilk consumers out of billions of dollars a 
year, often escape prosecution because they tailor their crimes to fall through 
jurisdictional cracks in state and federal law, a top California regulator 
testified Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, law enforcement agencies are so understaffed that they usually 
cannot track the extent to which telephone "boiler room" operators comply with 
laws already on the books, said G. W. McDonald, assistant commissioner for 
enforcement of the California Department of Corporations. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald was among eight state and federal officials who testified on the 
second and final day of telemarketing fraud hearings conducted by the consumer 
affairs subcommittee of the House Committee on Government Operations. 
</P>
<P>
The committee is studying ways that Congress can help state and federal 
agencies arrest and prosecute fraudulent boiler room operators, who use 
telephones to market everything from vitamins and office supplies to 
investments in coins and precious metals, and then either fail to deliver the 
goods, or deliver products worth a fraction of what the victim paid. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald was particularly critical of what he said is the inability of the 
California Attorney General's office, because of inadequate staffing, to keep 
tabs on the more than 300 boiler rooms in the state that are required to 
register under the state's 1986 Telemarketing Registration Act. 
</P>
<P>
"The California telemarketing statute has not worked because it has not been 
enforced," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The sales material, the (telephone sales) script, and everything they 
(telemarketers) file with the A. G. is not what they're actually using. So if 
you don't follow up . . . having all the registration laws in the world doesn't 
do anything," McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
Equally troublesome, McDonald testified, are the number of fraudulent 
telemarketing pitches that fall between murky legal definitions that 
distinguish securities from commodities. 
</P>
<P>
The most serious such scam involves the financing by legitimate banks of 
precious metals purchases made by investors who are brought into the market by 
independent "dealers" operating out of telephone boiler rooms. The dealers 
broker both the purchase of the metals and the bank financing. In that process 
the metal serves as collateral for the bank loan and the dealers gain an 
inflated commission. 
</P>
<P>
The fraud involves the failure of the boiler room operators to disclose to the 
investor the dealer's huge commissions. Authorities have calculated that in 
many cases the value of the metal would have to rise 30% during the life of the 
contract merely to allow the investor to earn back the money he has paid in 
commissions and fees. 
</P>
<P>
"The banks deny any responsibility for the massive abuse at the dealer level," 
McDonald said in written testimony presented to the subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
Under current law, the Department of Corporations cannot regulate California 
bank-financed precious metals programs because the department has concluded 
that the programs do not involve the sale of securities. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the federal Commodities Futures Trading Commission, which 
regulates transactions in commodities futures, has determined that the bank 
programs amount to "cash and carry," where the purchaser pays for the metal and 
immediately receives it, even though a portion is financed. Therefore, the 
commission has concluded that no futures contract is involved and it has no 
jurisdiction.

RICE-A-RONI'S CLASSIC JINGLE WILL RETURN

<P>
Rice-A-Roni is bringing back the jingle that was once its meat and potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Monday, "Rice-A-Roni, the San Francisco treat," will be sung on a TV 
commercial near you. 
</P>
<P>
If you sense it hasn't been long since you last heard it, you're right. It was 
only three years ago when Golden Grain Macaroni dumped the 30-year-old jingle 
for the side dish that was once promoted as a potato substitute. At the time 
the jingle was killed, a company executive said the ad had become so familiar 
that "people stopped listening to it." 
</P>
<P>
Well, Golden Grain has changed its tune. Actually, the tune is about the same 
-- just a bit more contemporary. And the baby boomers who eat Rice-A-Roni in 
the new spot wear things such as suspenders and designer eye glasses. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave it a couple of years' rest," said Steve Odland, director of marketing 
at Oakland-based Golden Grain, which is owned by Quaker Oats. "Now, we think 
we've given it enough of a hiatus to have it break through again." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, Rice-A-Roni is not the first to bring back an old theme. Campbell's 
Soup recently brought back "Mmm, mmm good." Nestea has revived its "Nestea 
Plunge." And while trying to recover from some recent bad publicity, Perrier 
returned to its familiar "Earth's first soft drink." 
</P>
<P>
Officials insist Rice-A-Roni sales are up -- not down. An executive at the 
agency that revived the new campaign said the timing is right. "There's a lot 
more return to the family these days," said Mike Moser, co-creative director at 
the San Francisco agency Goldberg Moser O'Neill. "Today, you can turn on 
Nickelodeon and watch 'Dobie Gillis' and 'Donna Reed' while eating 
Rice-A-Roni."

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: EATERIES' ELUSIVE RECIPE FOR SUCCESS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A few months ago, Andrew Rakos was a trend-setter at Max Factor &amp; Co., 
marketing new cosmetics for men. 
</P>
<P>
Today, he's setting new trends in breakfast and lunch at his 2-month-old West 
Los Angeles cafe called Who's on Third. 
</P>
<P>
"I was working 80 hours a week, making a lot of money, but something was 
missing," said Rakos, who learned to cook from his Hungarian grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
Determined to combine his marketing skills with his love of good food, Rakos 
invested his savings in a ramshackle delicatessen. He sold or threw out 
everything in the place, redecorated in bright, upbeat colors and joined the 
thousands of entrepreneurs across the country who jump into the risky 
restaurant business each year. 
</P>
<P>
Many new restaurants barely survive a year because their inexperienced owners 
don't realize that loving good food and wanting to please people are not 
enough. A restaurant owner is not only a purchasing agent and personnel 
manager, but he or she has to cook when the chef doesn't show up and play 
electrician with a balky freezer. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who believe that this is a simple or easy business are doomed to 
failure," said Gerald Breitbart, a veteran restaurant owner who counsels scores 
of would-be restaurateurs for the California Restaurant Assn. 
</P>
<P>
To be successful, he said, potential restaurant owners must be able to think 
clearly under pressure and possess a powerful desire to please the public. 
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of size, you must always believe the customer is a guest in your 
house," said Breitbart, who recommends working in a restaurant before thinking 
about opening one of your own. 
</P>
<P>
Breitbart said there are five keys to determining the best location for a new 
restaurant: population density, accessibility, site dimensions, local zoning 
and liquor license availability. 
</P>
<P>
Once you choose a site, prepare a detailed financial plan, projecting whether 
your cash flow will service your debt and provide any return on your 
investment. Because most bankers consider restaurants extremely risky, plan on 
borrowing money from friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Even established restaurant owners have trouble finding working capital. Maxine 
Weinman, owner of Maxine's Seafood Cafe in Hollywood, said she would love to 
buy a $2,500 lobster tank and a $4,000 double refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
But she can't find a banker willing to finance her improvements. So far, 
bankers have rejected her loan applications because they object to her 
less-than-desirable location and the fact that about half of her business 
depends on delivering food to customers who work at the surrounding movie and 
recording studios. She said bankers are wary because she extends credit to her 
biggest customers, who don't have the best financial reputations. 
</P>
<P>
"Owning a restaurant is a never-ending crisis," said Weinman. "You can depend 
on walk-in traffic going down when the temperature goes up, the air 
conditioning breaking down or the roof springing a leak when it rains." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the challenges, entrepreneurs continue to open new restaurants across 
the country every week. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone seems to have a fantasy of writing a book or opening a restaurant," 
said Danny Liberatoscioli, president of the Restaurant School in Philadelphia. 
"But owning a restaurant is hard work. It means 12- to 14-hour days, low pay 
and a high rate of business fatality." 
</P>
<P>
His one-year program, which focuses on training people for second careers in 
the restaurant business, has drawn students ranging from a former nun to the 
co-founder of a major credit card company. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to make a lot of money, stay out of the restaurant business, most 
consultants say. About 62% of all eating and drinking establishments had annual 
sales below $250,000, according to the 1987 Census of Retail Trade. Eighteen 
percent had sales between $250,000 and $500,000 and only 8% had sales of more 
than $1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
The failure rate of restaurants is high. For every 100 restaurants that open, 
70 to 80 will fail within two years, according to Saul Leonard, national 
partner in charge of leisure industries for the accounting firm of Laventhol 
&amp; Horwath. He said there are three major reasons that restaurants fail: 
undercapitalization, overspending on site and equipment and inconsistent food 
and service. Restaurant patrons, he added, are among the most unforgiving of 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
But Rakos is confident Who's On Third will not be among next year's restaurant 
fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
Tapping his marketing skills, Rakos sat across the street from the deli for 10 
days, counting patrons going in and out. "I realized the owner had no 
business," said Rakos. "Since there was no clientele to buy, I had to start 
from scratch." 
</P>
<P>
Rakos bought the business for less than $50,000 and soon transformed the dying 
deli into a lively 30-seat eatery catering to neighboring business owners and 
residents. His is now among the ranks of the nation's 636,000 restaurants, 
which employ about 8 million people and generate more than $200 billion a year 
in sales. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to stay clear-headed because things happen all the time in this 
business," said Rakos, who plans to start serving dinner in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
In the first week, Rakos went through six chefs, called on his mother to work 
as a waitress on opening day and realized he had to install a new air 
conditioning system -- fast. 
</P>
<P>
Because you are creating a new product every day, Rakos said the business has 
its terrifying moments. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst thing is waking up in the morning and wondering if anyone will come 
into my restaurant that day." 
</P>

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: SOME ANALYSTS SEE AN ERA OF GROWTH FOR GROWTH STOCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ed Kerschner hears the same moan about the stock market from a lot of big 
investors in a lot of different places: It's too late to get in. 
</P>
<P>
And when the market has a day like Thursday -- when the Dow Jones industrials 
jumped 37.13 points to a record 2,969.80 -- the moaning about "being too late" 
just gets louder. Kerschner, Paine Webber Inc.'s 37-year-old chief investment 
strategist, believes that life is only going to get more miserable for those 
doubters. 
</P>
<P>
Kerschner, in L.A. this week to visit with clients, is a member of a small but 
growing school of Wall Streeters who believe that growth-stock investing has 
entered a dramatic new phase. The market as a whole may finish just 10% to 15% 
higher -- or lower -- this year, he says. But the companies that are producing 
strong earnings growth are going to be stars for some time to come, Kerschner 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Investors who insist that many of these growth stocks are already too high 
priced are forgetting the nature of market cycles, Kerschner says. When Wall 
Street begins thinking a new way, the cycle tends to run for much longer than 
anyone initially predicts. Remember how the takeover-stock cycle ran from 1984 
to 1989? 
</P>
<P>
And if growth-stock fans sound like their counterparts back in 1971-73 -- the 
days of the Nifty Fifty growth stocks that soared to outrageous heights before 
crashing -- well, so be it, Kerschner says. "The Nifty Fifty wasn't a 
conspiracy. It was a result of the investment process of the time," he says. 
The time will come to sell growth stocks in this cycle, too, he says -- but not 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
Kerschner adds that growth investing doesn't have to mean chasing little-known 
companies. One theme that he stresses is the idea of "world-class" growth 
stocks -- companies that are major players overseas. In the new world 
unfolding, it's a simple fact that demand for many products and services will 
grow far faster overseas than in the United States, Kerschner says. 
</P>
<P>
His list of 12 world-class stocks includes Boeing, Coca-Cola, oil services 
giant Halliburton and drug firm Merck. All have been hot stocks this year. And 
while some investors may be getting bored hearing the same names, remember: 
Early in stock market cycles, familiarity doesn't breed contempt; it breeds 
more buying by new investors who want to own names they can understand. 
</P>
<P>
Kerschner presents his list as a core portfolio for any investor who wants to 
bet on a booming world economy in the 1990s. These are companies that already 
know how to do business overseas. Many of them now derive more than 50% of 
their revenue from overseas business (which Kerschner counts as sales by the 
firms' overseas subsidiaries, plus their exports from the United States). 
</P>
<P>
A kicker for the group, Kerschner says, is the potential economic renaissance 
of South and Central America. Mexico, in particular, is undertaking bold 
economic reforms designed to bolster growth in the 1990s, Kerschner says. 
Instead of seeking new loans to paper over Mexico's problems, Mexican President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari is trying to reenergize the economy by putting state 
enterprises -- such as banks -- back in private hands. Kerschner believes that 
many U.S. companies and investors haven't yet realized the long-term 
significance of the changes in South and Central America. Latin America "could 
be for us in the 1990s what Eastern Europe will be for Western Europe," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly: La Jolla-based Investment Quality Trends newsletter rates stocks based 
on their dividend yields -- specifically, the current yield's value relative to 
the stock's historical dividend norm. Among 350 blue chip stocks the newsletter 
follows, publisher Geraldine Weiss now rates 19% undervalued, 19% overvalued, 
31% headed toward undervalued status and 31% headed toward overvalued status. 
That's what Weiss calls "a market in equilibrium, with as many good buys 
currently in the market as there are stocks to avoid." The figures also mean 
the market is "not vulnerable to a severe decline," she says. Before the 1987 
market crash, Weiss says, 36% of the stocks were overvalued and 35% were headed 
toward overvalued status. . . . Another sign of a pickup in small stocks: 
NASDAQ over-the-counter trading volume equaled 89% of New York Stock Exchange 
volume in the first six months of this year, compared to 81% for all of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
KERSCHNER'S WORLD-CLASS STOCKS 
</P>
<P>
Here are 12 stocks that PaineWebber strategist Ed Kerschner picks as prime 
beneficiaries of the globalization of business in the 1990s. Included for each 
is the percentage of 1989 revenue derived from foreign business.

Price cuts and special promotions boosted business at stores last month, but 
sluggish economic conditions continued to restrain overall retail sales growth, 
according to results released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the nation's largest retailers posted better June sales than May's 
disappointing tallies. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the rebounds, retail analysts say the industry has been facing a 
difficult period because consumers have been losing confidence in their 
financial well-being and have grown more cautious about spending.

DOLE FOODS DRAWS INTERESTED BUYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA L. La GANGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just because its proposed spinoff of Dole Food Co. has been stalled doesn't 
mean that Castle &amp; Cooke Inc. will be stuck with the produce giant forever. 
</P>
<P>
Castle &amp; Cooke officials said Thursday that they have been contacted by 
"several major companies" interested in acquiring Dole and have retained the 
investment banking firm of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. to assist in evaluating a 
possible sale. 
</P>
<P>
It has been 14 months since Dole's Los Angeles-based parent company -- which 
also owns Oceanic Properties Inc. of Honolulu -- announced that it was working 
toward spinning off Dole Food Co. And two months have passed since the spinoff 
was stalled because of tightening credit in the real estate market and a delay 
in getting government approval for the separation. 
</P>
<P>
"A sale of Dole Food Co. could be an attractive alternative to the planned 
separation of our two businesses, " David H. Murdock, chairman and chief 
executive of Castle &amp; Cooke said. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Klein, a spokeswoman for Castle &amp; Cooke, would not comment on which 
companies have shown interest in Dole or on the timetable for a possible sale. 
The company's stock closed at $30.50 Thursday in trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange, up 37.5 cents. The company announcement came after the market closed.

AS FINANCIAL CLOUT SHIFTS FROM THE BAY AREA TO THE SOUTHLAND, MORE IN THE WORK 
FORCE FACE A DECISION TO TRANSFER. SOME BALK, BUT OTHERS WHO DO MOVE FIND THEY 
GET TO LIKE IT.

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deborah Dilley knew her promotion at First Interstate Bank was terrific, but 
she wondered, "If this is such a great opportunity, how come I feel so rotten?" 
</P>
<P>
It was simply because the new job required moving from the Bay Area to Los 
Angeles, or, as she recalls feeling at the time, "from paradise to the pit of 
the world," where smog is king, where commutes take four hours, where people 
are flaky and where drive-by shooters menace at every corner. 
</P>
<P>
She thought about declining, until her husband convinced her that it would be 
an adventure. Now, after more than a year of living in the Encino hills and 
playing golf whenever they feel like it, the couple have adjusted. 
</P>
<P>
With the balance of financial power shifting southward from San Francisco, once 
the West's undisputed corporate and banking leader but increasingly the town 
that plays second fiddle, more people like Dilley are being forced to choose 
between opportunity and lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping for career advancement, many employees are leaving their hearts in San 
Francisco but moving their belongings to La-La Land. Some go with trepidation, 
fearful of housing costs, crummy air and congestion. But they go nonetheless, 
relocation specialists say, because the moving and shaking is occurring in 
vast, dynamic Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"From a commercial point of view," says Leon A. Farley, a San Francisco-based 
executive recruiter, "L.A. is becoming increasingly significant." 
</P>
<P>
If San Francisco and its environs remain a top-rated spot for travelers and a 
beloved home for residents, the fact is that in many ways the city is viewed as 
a dying Athens overshadowed by its sprawling, brawny southern counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
Although a number of large companies still call San Francisco home -- notably 
Chevron and Bank of America -- many others have moved or been swallowed up in 
takeovers. The Bay Area still reigns in high technology and has a thriving 
amalgamation of small businesses and specialized service firms, but Southern 
California whips it handily in financial services, international trade, 
retailing and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
And even for companies with headquarters in San Francisco, Southern California 
provides a far bigger market for their goods and services. With 14.5 million 
people, Greater Los Angeles is more than twice as populous as the nine-county 
Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, companies seeking to expand in the Southland, from architectural 
firms to oil companies, routinely must seek candidates for promotions and 
transfers. Their overtures can meet with emotions other than sheer joy, and 
companies find that they often must sweeten the deal by throwing in a car or 
money for housing. 
</P>
<P>
After all, in the view of many Northern Californians, nurtured on Los 
Angeles-bashing, it's quite a trade-off. Will it be quaint Victorian houses or 
tacky mini-malls? The Golden Gate Bridge or tangles of freeway overpasses? BART 
or gridlock? Fog or smog? 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Sonner was initially glum at the prospect of leaving the Bay Area. She 
and her husband, Leo, lived in an $800-a-month apartment in San Ramon and took 
BART into the city each weekend to eat at Fisherman's Wharf or go to the 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
But when Dow Chemical asked Leo Sonner to become senior account manager for its 
Dow Plastics division in City of Industry, with responsibility for a territory 
five times larger than the one he had, the couple decided they couldn't pass it 
up. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, they moved to a quintessentially Southern California house, 
complete with white stucco and a red-tile roof, in the oceanside community of 
Dana Point. From their sun-splashed deck they look out on the Saddleback 
Mountains and wide, sandy beaches. 
</P>
<P>
The $1,700-a-month rent is far more than they were paying, but Leo can do much 
of his work from home and Joyce looks forward to owning a boat next year and 
taking classes at a nearby college to qualify as a building inspector. 
</P>
<P>
Not too shabby, Joyce freely acknowledges. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really paradise," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Others who make the leap have become converts for various reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Architect Charles Wing, 41, received a big pay raise, an automobile and help in 
buying a Santa Monica house when he agreed to manage the growing Brentwood 
office of Kaplan/McLaughlin/Diaz. The San Francisco-based firm designed the 
classy new mini-mall at Rodeo Drive and Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"The multicultural aspect of Los Angeles is something I'm very positive about," 
he says. "San Francisco is very provincial." 
</P>
<P>
Although he finds the air here much worse than in the Bay Area, traffic, he 
feels, is "really not that different." And there's the warmer weather. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Bottom, who spent her childhood in Southern California and returned last 
year after living in the Bay Area, relishes the museums -- and the warmer 
climate. She took some satisfaction in mothballing some of her San Francisco 
wardrobe essentials. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm making plans to root," says Bottom, director of interior design for the 
downtown Los Angeles office of Whisler-Patri, another San Francisco 
architectural firm. Many die-hard San Franciscans, she added, "don't realize 
there are wonderful and exciting aspects of life here." 
</P>
<P>
Many Bay Area-based firms with growing operations in Los Angeles find that the 
best approach is to recruit volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's strictly voluntary, and, believe it or not, some have (volunteered), but 
not many," says David Blatteis, chairman of Blatteis Realty Co., a 62-year-old 
San Francisco company with a small but growing Southland office. "Talk to my 
older brother, Daniel. He can tell you why he moved down there. It baffles me." 
</P>
<P>
Opportunity, that's why. 
</P>
<P>
The more progressive business climate "is the overriding reason why I moved," 
says Dan Blatteis, who plans soon to add staff to the three-person Century City 
office. "Retailers are expanding at a much greater pace in Los Angeles. There's 
more wealth." 
</P>
<P>
Blatteis Realty chose to reopen its Southern California office two years ago 
after finding that many of the retailers and restaurants for which it was 
trying to find sites in San Francisco, such as California Pizza Kitchen, were 
based in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Blatteis, 31, acknowledged that it took him a long time to "learn to love 
L.A." But now he prefers the warmth to San Francisco's chill, foggy nights, and 
relishes the broader range of cultural activities. He even thinks the 
restaurants are as good as those in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Another plus: Blatteis lives "two minutes" from his office and can walk to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron Corp., the San Francisco-based oil giant, finds its El Segundo refinery 
the toughest place to sell to would-be transfers. 
</P>
<P>
"Because it's a beach location, the cost of housing even an hour away is very 
high," says Sue Osborn, Chevron's senior analyst for relocation policies. 
</P>
<P>
Even for Bay Area employees accustomed to hefty price tags on houses, real 
estate is the No. 1 concern when it comes to moving south, Osborn says. 
</P>
<P>
Close behind is the cost of operating a car, more of a necessity in the 
Southland. Many of Chevron's employees in the Bay Area live near BART and other 
mass-transit lines and commute to facilities in the East Bay. 
</P>
<P>
In moving as many as 40 employees a year from the Bay Area to operations in 
Ventura, La Habra and El Segundo, the company often encounters what Osborn 
calls the "Northern California syndrome." 
</P>
<P>
"People up here tend to think the lifestyle is better," Osborn says. 
</P>
<P>
Among Northern Californians, there is also a widely held notion that Los 
Angeles is more expensive. But evidence indicates otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
A family of four in a median-cost city could afford a 2,400-square-foot house 
and two cars on an annual income of $60,000, according to relocation 
specialists Runzheimer International. The same lifestyle would cost more than 
$83,000 in the Bay Area and just over $77,000 in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
On a percentage basis, job growth in the two areas is projected for the 1990s 
"to be roughly the same, about 1.8%," says Stephen Levy, director of the Center 
for Continuing Study of the California Economy, based in Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
In sheer numbers of jobs, however, the Bay Area does not hold a candle to 
Southern California. The Southland is expected in the year 2000 to have a total 
of 7.6 million paying jobs, compared to 3.6 million for the San Francisco area. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the opportunities, some firms find it tough to draw from anywhere but 
close by. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't find people eager to go to Los Angeles," says Stephen A. Enna, 
executive vice president and personnel director for Wells Fargo &amp; Co. "It's 
less expensive to recruit from the local market. They're settled and happy. You 
don't have to go through the enticement stage." 
</P>
<P>
Executive recruiters also encounter resistance to Los Angeles from older 
employees for whom a move would be an economic setback. 
</P>
<P>
"An awful lot of senior people will take a lesser job or compensation to stay 
in the Bay Area," says Bernard (Buzz) Schulte, San Francisco-based managing 
director for the Northwest region for Korn/Ferry International, an executive 
recruiting firm. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Somerville, for one, couldn't be pried free. 
</P>
<P>
While senior vice president of administration for Core-Mark Distributors Inc. 
in South San Francisco, Somerville briefly considered a post at a large 
Southern California food company but withdrew his name. That was despite the 
fact that Core-Mark's business -- distributing tobacco and other products to 
convenience stores -- is in a severe downturn. 
</P>
<P>
"The smog was horrible the times I was there," Somerville says, adding that his 
wife, Robin, has had respiratory pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
The Somervilles, who have a house with a pool in the small community of Los 
Altos, south of San Francisco, also balked at moving because they found that 
Los Angeles lacked the "sense of neighborhood" that exists on the peninsula. 
For a time, Somerville considered commuting by air from the Bay Area but 
ultimately decided the strain would be too much. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really an issue of lifestyle," says Somerville, who has since resigned 
from Core-Mark and is now concentrating his job search in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
For Dilley, vice president and manager of institutional trust sales and 
marketing for First Interstate, life in Los Angeles has been a series of 
adjustments. And, even though she and husband Ken Rosenberg enjoy the weather 
and restaurants, some of the negatives she dreaded occasionally stare her in 
the face. 
</P>
<P>
Dilley was driving some Bay Area visitors around one time, trying to convince 
them that "it's not that bad here." Within the next 24 hours, they saw police 
arresting nine youths, a burglary and a car with bullet holes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really enjoying my stay, but I view it as a stay," Dilley says. "I'd go 
back in a minute to the Bay Area."

TOXIC WARNINGS ORDERED ON JOB; 
</P>
<P>
PROP. 65: STATE APPEALS COURT RULES THAT INITIATIVE'S TOUGH REQUIREMENTS APPLY 
IN WORKPLACE AS WELL. SEVEN MILLION EMPLOYEES ARE AFFECTED.

<P>
In a ruling that could affect about 7 million employees, a state Court of 
Appeal ruled Thursday that the stringent toxic warnings required under 
Proposition 65 must be issued in the California workplace. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was hailed by lawyers for labor and environmental groups, who said 
it means that workers will be alerted to the hazards of about 300 chemicals 
identified as potential causes of cancer or birth defects. 
</P>
<P>
Under less-demanding federal standards, warnings are not required for 84 
substances on the state's toxics list, the lawyers said. The state law also 
requires warnings at a lower level of exposure than does federal law, they 
added. 
</P>
<P>
It was the latest in a series of rulings in which the courts have rejected 
contentions by state officials and ordered broad application of the sweeping 
1986 initiative. In March, for example, a Sacramento Superior Court judge 
invalidated a state regulation exempting foods, drugs and cosmetics from the 
initiative's requirements. 
</P>
<P>
"This removes the last major hurdle that was posed to full implementation of 
Proposition 65," said Albert H. Meyerhoff of the Natural Resources Defense 
Council. "This is a big victory." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Rubin of San Francisco, a lawyer for the California AFL-CIO, said that 
under the ruling, the private employers covered by the initiative will likely 
be required to post toxics-warning notices in the workplace much like those 
already being placed in service stations, liquor stores and other 
establishments. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers who represented the state Occupational Safety and Health Standards 
Board in the case before the court were not available. Rick Rice, a spokesman 
for the state Department of Industrial Relations, said officials had not yet 
decided whether to appeal the ruling to the state Supreme Court. He 
acknowledged the decision will have "significant impact" but declined further 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative requires private businesses with 10 or more employees to give 
"clear and reasonable" warnings to people who might be exposed to chemicals 
that could cause cancer or birth defects. According to lawyers, about 7 million 
workers will be affected by that mandate. 
</P>
<P>
The case arose in a lawsuit filed by labor and environmental groups against the 
OSHA board after the board refused to apply Proposition 65 to the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
The board said that contrary to the groups' claims, a separate initiative 
passed in 1988 to restore job-safety functions of Cal/OSHA did not require such 
application. The separate initiative, known as Proposition 97, required the 
OSHA program to be consistent with other state job-safety laws. The board 
argued that Proposition 65 was not such a law because it was not specifically 
aimed at workers and contained exemptions for about 25% of the work force.

ENVIRONMENTALISTS ASSAIL DELTA WATER DIVERSION PLAN

California environmentalists complained Thursday that a plan by the Deukmejian 
Administration to capture more water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta 
would spell disaster for the estuaries it feeds and the fish and wildlife that 
inhabit them. 
</P>
<P>
The environmentalists said a draft proposal by the Department of Water 
Resources for water development in the South Delta was actually the first step 
"in an overall plan to divert more water from Northern to Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a renewal of an effort by the Deukmejian Administration to divert 
water through a facility that became popularly known as 'Duke's ditch' when he 
was attempting to get it passed by the Legislature several years ago. . . . The 
approach now is to authorize it piece by piece," said Gerald Meral, executive 
director of the Planning and Conservation League. 
</P>
<P>
Meral said the suggestions in the new plan, combined with other proposals the 
agency is expected to release soon, would ultimately allow delta exports to be 
increased by 1.2 million acre-feet a year. The additional water would be 
shipped south, he said, by way of the State Water Project to agricultural 
interests and urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
The State Water Project sells water to the Metropolitan Water District, which 
then resells it to customers in Southern California including the City of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that the proposal would permit more water to be exported, 
state officials disputed Meral's contention that it would be as much as 1.2 
million acre-feet. An acre-foot is the amount of water needed to cover one acre 
with one foot of water. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the projects we're talking about here in the next 10 years add 
up to that 1.2 million," said Fred Bachman, supervising engineer for the water 
resources department and an author of the proposal. If the initial proposal is 
adopted, he said it would permit additional diversions of about 66,000 
acre-feet. 
</P>
<P>
Bachman conceded that state water officials have made a political decision to 
attack water problems on a step-by-step basis rather than put forward one grand 
proposal. "You just can't get support for these big massive projects," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bachman said officials believe that by shifting their major pumping to the 
winter they can take more water and help alleviate fish problems at the same 
time. In the winter, he said, there is more water in the delta and fewer young 
fish that might be killed by the pumping action. 
</P>
<P>
But environmentalists insisted that any additional diversions, no matter what 
time of year, would further damage the already threatened wetlands and 
fisheries. 
</P>
<P>
The plan "would be a disaster for the bay and more than likely sound a death 
knell for many . . . fisheries," said Barry Nelson, executive director of the 
Save San Francisco Bay Assn.

THICK WITH CRICKETS; 
</P>
<P>
NEVADA OFFICIALS FEAR COMEBACK BY VORACIOUS INSECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Nevada agricultural officials on Thursday declared victory in their war against 
the Mormon cricket but warned that unless the drought eases, next year's fight 
against the voracious pest could be the toughest in the state's history. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Gronowski, who coordinated Nevada's anti-cricket campaign, said the 
pesky bugs -- notorious for their size and hearty appetites -- are "mostly 
mating and laying eggs now" and have lost interest in eating. 
</P>
<P>
But the insects have infested 1.5 million acres -- more than double the acreage 
they occupied just three months ago -- and unless a cold, wet spring kills off 
millions of hatchlings, Nevada is in for "the fight of our lifetime" next year, 
Gronowski said. 
</P>
<P>
"The battle is just about over -- for now," said Gronowski, the state's 
director of plant industry. "We met our objective, which was to keep 'em out of 
towns and out of crops, but we didn't make a dent in the population. Without 
cooperative weather, all of northern Nevada will be infested next year." 
</P>
<P>
Several other Western states, meanwhile, also battled Mormon cricket 
infestations and are anxiously wondering what 1991 will bring. 
Larger-than-normal populations were reported this year in Arizona, Utah, 
Wyoming and Idaho, and Colorado had a small infestation as well. 
</P>
<P>
In Utah, stretches of interstate freeways this spring were "just black with 
crickets," and some portions were even closed briefly by authorities, reported 
Van Burgess, that state's director of plant industry. 
</P>
<P>
Alfalfa and grain farmers reported some crop losses to the cricket hordes, but 
suffering more were Utah's cattlemen. The insects chomped so much rangeland 
that ranchers -- already coping with scarce forage because of the persistent 
drought -- are struggling. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of ranchers are having to buy supplemental feed, and with alfalfa at $100 
a ton here, that gets expensive," Burgess said. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona's first infestation in at least four decades occurred this year near 
Colorado City, 80 miles north of the Grand Canyon. No towns were threatened, 
but crickets ate "everything in sight -- just cleared 5,000 acres clean down to 
the ground," said Ivan Shields, director of the state's Commission of 
Agriculture and Horticulture. 
</P>
<P>
"They've left nothing for the cattle, the deer and the elk," lamented Shields, 
adding that officials were unable to use aerial spraying against the bugs 
because of several endangered plant species in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Mormon crickets, actually members of the longhorned grasshopper family, can 
grow as big as mice and have an alarming habit of traveling in massive bands. 
The bugs, which cannot fly but can march five miles in a day, were named for 
Mormon settlers in Utah whose homesteads were overrun by crickets in 1848. 
</P>
<P>
In Nevada, this year's infestation was the worst since the 1930s, when entire 
towns were invaded by bands stretching 12 miles long. Although an aggressive 
poisoning campaign prevented major damage to the infested region's $66-million 
hay crop, the crickets munched flower and vegetable gardens, slickened freeways 
and even prompted the temporary closure of Winnemucca's municipal airport. Six 
counties in northeastern Nevada were infested, and the bugs surprised 
entomologists by turning up in places they had never been spotted before. 
</P>
<P>
The Winnemucca area represented the front line of Nevada's cricket battle. June 
Stannard watched in horror one Saturday in June as a band of crickets closed in 
on her home about 10 miles from town. 
</P>
<P>
"It was awful," Stannard recalled. "There were so many, the road looked like it 
was moving. It looked like a sea." 
</P>
<P>
The bugs bypassed Stannard's place, but several neighbors weren't so lucky. One 
woman watched helplessly as a seemingly endless line of crickets invaded her 
garden and then climbed methodically up her screen door and the side of her 
trailer home. 
</P>
<P>
Other residents were forced to house their dogs in town with friends because 
the animals tended to "gorge themselves on crickets and get sick," Stannard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such horror stories, Gronowski said things could have been worse. If 
crews hadn't begun laying poison early this year, "then there's no doubt the 
crickets would be playing the slot machines at Winners (a casino in downtown 
Winnemucca) right now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And, although they felt besieged, the plucky people of Winnemucca seemed to 
cope well with the unwanted guests -- and some even made a buck off of them. 
Several stores are still hawking Mormon cricket T-shirts, and the Convention 
and Visitors Bureau -- after initially fearing that news stories on the giant 
bugs might scare off tourists -- reports instead that scores of motorists are 
pulling off the freeway in hopes of spotting the famed insects. 
</P>
<P>
"We get 75 calls a week, easy, on the crickets," a spokeswoman for the bureau 
said. "A lot of them are from people who want us to mail them a cricket. . . . 
We also get calls from conventioneers who want to know whether to wear high 
boots."

REBELS' GAINS ON BATTLEFIELD OVERSHADOW 5-NATION TALKS

<P>
The increasingly unstable situation in Cambodia appears to be offering fresh 
proof of the old soldier's maxim that a government cannot achieve at the 
negotiating table what it fails to win on the battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
A new round of talks is scheduled to open Monday in Paris involving officials 
from the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. The five -- 
Britain, France, China, the Soviet Union and the United States -- are trying to 
reach a consensus on the best way to achieve a cease-fire in the 11-year-old 
Cambodian civil war and to hold U.N.-supervised elections. 
</P>
<P>
Rebel Victories 
</P>
<P>
But the talks are increasingly overshadowed by the recent battlefield gains by 
the Khmer Rouge, the hard-line Communist guerrilla group that ruled Cambodia 
from 1975 until early 1979 and has been blamed for causing more than 1 million 
deaths through brutality and starvation. 
</P>
<P>
With an army estimated at 35,000 hardened and motivated fighters, the Khmer 
Rouge is the strongest branch in a loose, three-party resistance coalition 
fighting the Vietnamese-backed Phnom Penh government from bases in neighboring 
Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Khmer Rouge announced a series of military victories, including 
the brief but psychologically important occupation of Kompong Thom, a 
provincial capital just 80 miles north of Phnom Penh. 
</P>
<P>
Refugees' Flight 
</P>
<P>
With the fighting, about 20,000 refugees have streamed into provincial towns in 
recent days, provoking memories of the similar exodus from the provinces in 
1975 that preceded the Khmer Rouge's defeat of the U.S.-backed regime in Phnom 
Penh. 
</P>
<P>
This time, however, relief workers believe that the Phnom Penh government may 
be deliberately encouraging the refugees to leave their homes in order to deny 
the Khmer Rouge a base of support in rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a fair amount of fighting around Phnom Penh," said one Western 
diplomat. "The pace of fighting has definitely picked up momentum in the last 
month." 
</P>
<P>
Winds of Diplomacy 
</P>
<P>
At least two factors have helped accelerate the resistance offensive, according 
to military analysts. 
</P>
<P>
The first was the start of the annual monsoon last month, generally a time when 
guerrilla forces in the region take the initiative because the government's 
more mechanized units are unable to maneuver effectively in the rain-soaked 
countryside. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the Khmer Rouge offensive also appeared timed to inflict maximum 
damage to coincide with talks in Tokyo between Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the 
nominal leader of the fractious resistance coalition, and Premier Hun Sen of 
the Phnom Penh government. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of their talks, Sihanouk and Hun Sen signed an accord calling for 
military restraint as a prelude to the creation of a Supreme National Council 
that would run the country until elections are held. 
</P>
<P>
Power-Sharing 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the Supreme Council would be composed of six representatives 
from Phnom Penh and six from the resistance. But the Khmer Rouge rejected the 
Tokyo talks, which had been arranged by Japan, Thailand and the United States, 
because the formula appeared to give equal standing to the Phnom Penh 
government and the resistance. 
</P>
<P>
The Khmer Rouge reiterated its demands, which are unacceptable to Cambodia and 
Vietnam, that the Phnom Penh regime hand over power to a four-party coalition 
government, giving equal authority to each of the four factions.

DIPLOMACY / REDEEMING THE CZAR'S BONDS;

A POTENTIAL WINDFALL FROM OLD WALLPAPER

<P>
Virtually unnoticed among the many superpower negotiations, the United States 
and Soviet Union are trying to settle U.S. claims of more than $1 billion on 
debts that predate the Bolshevik Revolution, including old czarist bonds bought 
by Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Recent U.S.-Soviet commercial talks have focused on Soviet efforts to obtain 
most-favored-nation trading status, which would enable the Soviets to get the 
U.S. government credits and loans they need to resuscitate their economy. 
</P>
<P>
Settling the old debts could also provide the Soviets with another source of 
funds. It would give them access to private American financial markets for 
loans to state enterprises -- the auto industry, for example -- that want to 
sell stock to foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
But before you start searching the attic or examining old wallpaper -- 
seemingly worthless czarist bonds were widely used as wallpaper in the 1920s -- 
you should know that the most you stand to collect is the amount actually paid 
for the bonds. No interest payments are contemplated. 
</P>
<P>
"People call up and think they're millionaires when they hear about the bond 
negotiations," a foreign bond dealer in New York said the other day. "I don't 
have any Russian bonds to sell, and I don't want to buy any Russian bonds. But 
I hear some are worth $20 or $30 as collector's items." 
</P>
<P>
According to a State Department official, some of the impressive, multicolored 
certificates, many of which feature a portrait of Czar Nicholas II, have 
brought almost their face value as antique art. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll take whatever we can get," Barbara Swaney of San Antonio told a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Czarist bonds were traded legally in the United States through 1934 and 
illegally afterward, and Swaney's father put thousands of dollars into them. 
Her bonds have a face value of 114,500 rubles -- $183,000 at the current, 
artificially high exchange rate. 
</P>
<P>
"Dad said he bought them with (President Franklin D.) Roosevelt's 
encouragement," she said, "after the President said his family was buying $5 
million worth." 
</P>
<P>
But according to a State Department specialist on the matter, Roosevelt never 
publicly urged Americans to buy the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The bonds represent only a small part of the U.S. claims involved in the 
negotiations, which began in late 1988. The largest single claim is by the U.S. 
government, for $187 million in loans to the short-lived provisional government 
that preceded the Bolshevik takeover in 1917. 
</P>
<P>
Including interest, that debt now comes to more than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Other claims, filed on behalf of American individuals and companies, could add 
more than $300 million to the total. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department has refused to disclose exactly how much the U.S. 
negotiators are seeking. The amount is determined as much by "political 
decision" as by financial calculation, the State Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, Moscow wants to deduct the value of the assets of czarist-era 
individuals and companies seized decades ago by the U.S. government to help 
settle claims against the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Moscow has submitted counterclaims for damage done by the U.S. military 
forces that landed at Archangel and Vladivostok shortly after the Bolshevik 
takeover. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as they took power, the Soviets repudiated all debts incurred by 
previous governments, yet over the years they have been inclined to honor them, 
at least in part. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets have also agreed to resume payments on $674 million they owe the 
United States for World War II lend-lease aid. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. loans to the provisional government, which held sway during the period 
between the ouster of Czar Nicholas II in February, 1917, and the Bolshevik 
Revolution that October, were intended to keep Russia in World War I. 
</P>
<P>
In 1934, after the United States declared the Soviet Union in default on those 
loans, Congress passed the Johnson Act, which made it a crime for American 
companies or individuals to lend money to the Soviet Union, or to buy or sell 
instruments of Soviet debt, until the loans were settled.

Striking members of opposition Sandinista labor unions began returning to their 
jobs Thursday after President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's government yielded 
to most of their demands to settle a destructive work stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
Workers began replacing street paving stones that were used to build 
barricades, and businesses reopened in this capital city. Six people were 
killed in clashes during the 10-day strike that tested the stability of 
Chamorro and her government, in office since April 25. 
</P>
<P>
The government's announced settlement with the National Workers' Front, a 
pro-Sandinista labor federation that called the strike, grants 43% pay raises 
this month, with another increase to be paid in August. The amount of the 
second raise is still to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement also requires that compensation be paid to 800 employees fired 
after April 26. State jobs will be reclassified in September, and a new 
minimum-wage law will be established. 
</P>
<P>
The strikers also forced Chamorro's conservative government to back down on a 
key part of its plan to return Nicaragua to a free-market economy: the return 
to their owners of lands confiscated after the leftist Sandinistas took power 
in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Workers and students will once again ride public transportation free of charge, 
a privilege granted by the Sandinistas and recently suspended by the new 
government to save money. 
</P>
<P>
The government also agreed to create a commission of government and National 
Workers' Front representatives to discuss government investment in state-owned 
textile, metalworking and construction companies. The talks are to begin 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The creation of the commission appeared to be a response to the front's demand 
for a role in making economic policy. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said the Bush 
Administration is pleased that the strikes have ended. But he assailed 
Sandinista officials, saying they have been unwilling to grant the government 
the breathing spell it needs to get desperately needed economic reconstruction 
under way. 
</P>
<P>
The strike began July 2 and grew into the biggest challenge to Chamorro since 
the Sandinistas, in power nine years, were voted out of office. Since losing 
elections in February to Chamorro's National Opposition Union, the Sandinistas 
have said they would "rule from below." 
</P>
<P>
The unions claimed that 90,000 government and state-industry employees joined 
the walkout. It was the second time since she took office that the Sandinistas 
have brought public services to a halt in an attempt to force pay raises and 
modifications in Chamorro's plans to cut public spending, sell off state-owned 
enterprises and return to capitalism the socialist-oriented economy built by 
the Sandinistas. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic began returning to normal here Thursday, but vehicles had to creep 
around potholes, dislodged paving stones and rubble left behind by barricades 
and fires that filled the streets during three days of disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
The unions called off street disruptions Wednesday to persuade the government 
to negotiate, but gunfire could be heard in the city throughout Wednesday night 
and early Thursday. There were no reports of new casualties. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, at least six people were reported killed and 100 injured in fighting 
between strikers and government supporters. 
</P>
<P>
The government had declared the strike "illegal, illegitimate and non-existent" 
and threatened to fire those who took part. Most present government employees 
received their posts during Sandinista rule.

Thirty-nine Haitians drowned when their sailboat capsized in choppy seas in the 
Bahamas while being towed by a military patrol boat, according to a government 
statement Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-seven others aboard the unnamed 45-foot sailing sloop were rescued after 
it sank Tuesday afternoon, the Bahamian government said. 
</P>
<P>
The government did not explain what caused the sloop to sink while under tow. 
</P>
<P>
The Bahamian Defense Force vessel Yellow Elder spotted the Haitian vessel 
Tuesday morning off Staniel Cay, about 200 miles southeast of the southern tip 
of Florida near Great Exuma Island. The sloop tried to enter shallow waters and 
the patrol boat pursued, catching up to the vessel and taking it under tow, 
according to the statement. During the tow back to Staniel Cay, the sloop 
capsized. 
</P>
<P>
One Haitian radio station reported that the towline broke, and another said 
that panicked Haitians ran to one side of the vessel when Bahamian soldiers 
boarded it. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of the 30 men and nine women were buried Wednesday at Bitter Guana 
Cay in the Exumas, about 80 miles from Nassau, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The surviving Haitians were brought to Nassau on Wednesday.

been provided by East Germany's now-disbanded secret police.

Inge Viett and Werner Lotze arrived in the West German city of Karlsruhe, where 
they will appear before an investigating magistrate, according to Rolf Hannich,

<TEXT>
<P>
An international legion of bronzed backpackers braved vacation plans gone 
astray. Rail workers marshaled three of the longest trains ever seen in 
peacetime Europe. 
</P>
<P>
A platoon of Italian soldiers swapped its weapons for wire-cutters and 
weed-trimmers. A Calabrian bishop in the Italian boot hustled volunteer 
interpreters toward Brindisi from villages where Albanian has survived for 
centuries as a local dialect. 
</P>
<P>
Thus did this Adriatic port, and Italy with it, prepare Thursday for its first 
direct encounter with the human consequences of collapsing communism in Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
After watching, riveted for months, as a geography-insulated spectator while 
revolutionary winds swept the East, Italy has been brought center stage by 
trauma in Albania, a distant neighbor across the Adriatic. 
</P>
<P>
Italian, French and German officials increased a boat-lift flotilla from three 
vessels to five Thursday after it became clear that more Albanians than 
originally thought were taking refuge inside their embassies in the Albanian 
capital, Tirana. 
</P>
<P>
In all, officials expected between 4,500 and 5,000 Albanians to embark on the 
five chartered ferries late Thursday. The ships are due here this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Albania's Communist leaders, scrambling to maintain control of Europe's last 
stubbornly Stalinist state, agreed to the refugee exodus but ordered that it 
come in the dead of night from the port of Durres, about 20 miles from Tirana. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany alone expects 3,200 refugees, who have been dangerously jammed 
inside its embassy, according to Friedrich W. Catoir, a German spokesman here. 
One of the refugees was born Wednesday at the embassy. A number of others 
require medical attention, Catoir said. 
</P>
<P>
Three special trains stocked with food, medical personnel and German border 
police wound their way from Germany, through Austria and down the Italian 
peninsula to this port about 335 miles southeast of Rome on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was for them to leave almost immediately for Germany with refugees 
aboard two chartered ferries that will dock about 100 yards from the train 
station. 
</P>
<P>
To accommodate them, European rules on the size of international trains have 
been waived for the trip. The German locomotives will pull nearly twice as many 
carriages as are usually seen in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
About 500 refugees are expected on the ferry Orient Star chartered by France 
from a company in Greece. Officials said the ferry would call briefly here and 
then continue with the refugees to a French port, probably Marseilles. 
</P>
<P>
Italian officials here said they thought the ferries might also bring about 500 
Albanians who had found asylum in seven other foreign embassies in Tirana in a 
stampede that began June 28. 
</P>
<P>
To accommodate the influx, port officials ordered Brindisi closed to commercial 
maritime traffic today, Prefect Giuseppe Mazzitello said. That will mean delays 
for the hundreds of European and American tourists who wandered through the 
port with backpacks and bottles of mineral water awaiting passage to Greece. 
</P>
<P>
Lolling in the sun, they seemed neither particularly aware of the preparations 
around them, nor upset at the prospect of delay. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, Italy expects about 800 refugees from its embassy. Near the San 
Vito U.S. Air Base outside of town, a disused Italian army depot was being 
overhauled Thursday to accommodate them and up to 400 others. The Albanians 
were to remain there less than a week before being resettled around Italy, 
Mazzitello said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the broiling sun at the camp Thursday, soldiers installed cots, bathrooms 
and big kitchens. They whacked weeds, painted all that did not move and 
clambered in brilliant yellow gloves atop foreboding walls to hack at rusty 
rolls of barbed wire. 
</P>
<P>
The Cold War wire, meant to keep out enemies, had been left to discourage 
thieves and vandals. Clearly, it would not do for refugees from the tail thrash 
of dying communism. 
</P>
<P>
"We're taking down the wire because we don't want it to look like a 
concentration camp," said Italian army Lt. Col. Michele Dodde.

President Bush, just home from back-to-back summits with America's closest 
military and economic allies, won congressional support Thursday for proposed 
reforms of NATO and a go-slow approach to aid to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
During a half-hour meeting at the White House, Bush briefed Democratic and 
Republican leaders on the results of his meeting last week with NATO leaders in 
London and the seven-nation economic summit in Houston, which concluded 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It was basically upbeat," House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Dante B. 
Fascell (D-Fla.) said after the White House meeting, "and I think everybody 
felt that way about what the United States was able to accomplish." 
</P>
<P>
The session with congressional leaders followed a similar report to the 
Cabinet. Bush also indicated to reporters that he had yet to telephone Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to discuss the results of the two summits. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, Bush succeeded at London and Houston in winning strong 
backing for his vision of how the Western allies should alter their defenses 
and their economic relations with the Soviet Union in the post-Cold War era.

A group of Soviet military leaders and politicians published an angry attack on 
liberal critics Thursday for inspiring "anti-army hysteria" and scornfully 
dismissed talk of a planned coup. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea of a military coup . . . is being put around by those who want to 
play 'the army card' in the political game for power," a letter published in 
the military daily Krasnaya Zvezda said. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, signed by 77 people, including deputies to the Soviet and Russian 
parliaments and military officials, sharpened a public dispute between liberals 
and military top brass who have been accused of teaming up with conservatives 
to block army reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The letter was published as a retort to liberal politicians and academics who, 
in the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda on July 4, called for radical measures to 
bring the armed forces under parliamentary control and free them from party 
influence.

DWP COMMISSIONERS ADOPT SURCHARGE FOR WATER-RATIONING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power commissioners on Thursday adopted 
a water-rationing surcharge plan that would levy higher rates as city residents 
save more water. Officials said that if residents use less water, the DWP would 
need the extra money to cover fixed costs. 
</P>
<P>
The new rate, described as a "floating surcharge" must be approved by the City 
Council and could be considered today when the council debates Mayor Tom 
Bradley's rationing plan. Under the current water rationing ordinance, a 
surcharge of 9 cents per billing unit is added to the monthly bill. If the 
residents continue to save at the 15.5% rate achieved in June, officials said 
the surcharge could go up by at least 4 more cents per billing unit under the 
floating rate.

As California's budget impasse drags on, its unspent income is rising -- and 
earning a handsome profit. 
</P>
<P>
Because the state by law cannot pay its bills as long as it has no budget, 
revenues are mounting up and are now $1 billion higher than they would be in 
normal times, state Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes said the state so far has earned $1 million in interest on the money, and 
interest income is accumulating at a rate of $300,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
"We are rolling over $1 billion in bills that have not been paid. We have the 
cash in the bank and will earn interest on it until there is a budget and we 
can again legally pay our bills," Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the interest income will be redeposited in the state general fund. Some 
of it will be added to the money the state owes cities and counties, so the 
local governments will get slightly fatter checks than usual -- once the state 
starts sending out checks again. DOUGLAS P. SHUIT.

FAA AIDE SEES CHILD SAFETY SEATS COSTING MORE LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FULWOOD III, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Federal Aviation Administration official testified Thursday that requiring 
the use of child safety seats on commercial airliners would cost more lives 
than it would save because more families would travel by car, which is more 
dangerous than flying. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony J. Broderick, the FAA associate administrator for regulation and 
certification, told a House panel that there is little doubt safety seats would 
save infant lives in the event of an airplane crash. But he said the agency 
opposes mandating their use because studies suggest that families would not 
purchase an additional air fare and would opt instead to make cheaper -- and 
more dangerous -- highway trips. 
</P>
<P>
As a House aviation subcommittee listened with obvious disapproval, Broderick 
said: "Our concern is that while the chance of survival aboard an airplane may 
be slightly improved, the costs associated with mandating the carriage of a 
child in a separate seat will divert a significant number of families from our 
safest form of transportation -- air travel -- to the far less safe travel by 
automobile." 
</P>
<P>
Spurred by public outcry at the deaths of children in recent plane crashes -- 
including three infants and one small child in last year's Sioux City, Iowa, 
crash and the death of one infant and injuries to six others in the New York 
crash of an Avianca jet -- the House is considering a bill to mandate the use 
of safety seats for children under age 2. Under current regulations, children 
under 2 are allowed to fly free if they sit in an adult's lap. If safety seats 
are mandated, parents would have to buy a separate ticket to accommodate them. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, sponsored by Rep. Jim Lightfoot (R-Iowa), would force the FAA 
to revise airline operating rules to require that children use safety seats or 
some other form of in-flight restraint system. The bill would leave it to the 
Transportation Department to decide whether age and/or weight limits would 
determine when children would be required to use the restraints. 
</P>
<P>
If the House bill and a companion in the Senate -- sponsored by Sen. 
Christopher S. Bond (R-Mo.) and Sen. John C. Danforth (R-Mo.) -- become law, 
children most likely would be required to occupy an airline seat. That, 
opponents say, would lead to greater costs for families because the airlines 
are unlikely to allow children to fly free if they occupy a revenue-producing 
seat. Airline industry officials estimate that 3.3-million to 4-million 
children under 2 fly on U.S. domestic flights each year. 
</P>
<P>
Bond visited the House to testify in support of the bill. He called existing 
airline policies on child safety seats "confusing, vague and frustrating." One 
airline, he said, wouldn't allow his son to sit in an FAA-approved infant car 
seat even after Bond had purchased a ticket for him. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the FAA's arguments that more deaths would occur on the highways 
because the additional cost would force parents to travel by car, Bond said: "I 
find this reasoning appalling. If this line of argument were carried to its 
logical extreme," other safety measures that increase the cost of an airline 
ticket could be trimmed. "We wouldn't require oxygen masks, flame-retardant 
seats or safety lights on airplanes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Quoting a report by adjunct fellows at the Center for the Study of American 
Business at Washington University in St. Louis, Broderick said that the 
diversion of families from airliner to highway "could translate into more than 
1,600 additional automotive accidents each year and the increase in accidents 
could result in more than 175 additional disabling injuries and just under five 
additional deaths each year."

and critically injuring the co-pilot, authorities said. The plane apparently 
had engine problems shortly after takeoff.

GUIDELINES AIM TO CLARIFY FOOD LABELING 
</P>

Four months after he pledged to end the "Tower of Babel" in grocery stores, 
Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis W. Sullivan on Thursday offered a 
set of uniform definitions to clarify and standardize labeling language on 
virtually every food product sold in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The 400-page proposal, to be published next week in the Federal Register, 
updates and expands the lists of nutrients that should or should not be 
identified on labels and clarifies some previously confusing terms, such as 
"cholesterol-free" and "reduced-cholesterol," which manufacturers have used at 
whim. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, "cholesterol-free" would mean that a food product had less 
than 2 milligrams of cholesterol per serving and less than 5 grams of fat -- no 
more than 2 grams of which could be saturated fat. "Low-cholesterol" would mean 
less than 20 milligrams per serving and "reduced-cholesterol" could be applied 
only to foods containing 75% less cholesterol than the basic product. 
</P>
<P>
Food and Drug Administration officials said that in the coming months they will 
produce two further detailed proposals. The first will set precise standards 
for terms such as "high in fiber" and "lite," and the second will set out 
guidelines as to how labels should be designed. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA's intention to replace the largely voluntary, 17-year-old labeling 
system with updated, mandatory guidelines comes at a time of increasing 
confusion about the nutritional contents of foods. At least two bills have been 
introduced in Congress to authorize the rewriting of labeling guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA proposals are very close to what Congress is considering and what some 
industry and consumer groups have endorsed. 
</P>
<P>
For example, they require that the amounts of thiamine, riboflavin and niacin 
be dropped from labels and that four new food components be quantified: 
saturated fat, calories from fat, cholesterol and fiber. 
</P>
<P>
"Thiamine, riboflavin, niacin are primarily connected with deficiency diseases 
that are virtually nonexistent in the U.S. public," said F. Edward Scarbrough, 
acting director of the FDA's Office of Nutrition and Food Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals also standardize serving sizes for 159 food categories. Under 
current rules, manufacturers can set whatever serving size they wish, and this 
has led to complaints about misleading claims. For example, Sara Lee "lite" 
cheesecake is advertised as "only 200 calories per serving," yet the major 
difference between Sara Lee's low calorie cheesecake and regular cheesecake is 
that the serving described on the "lite" product package is smaller. 
</P>
<P>
While praising the general thrust of Sullivan's proposals, several consumer and 
industry groups said the new guidelines fall short in several key areas. 
</P>
<P>
For example, some consumer groups said, the rules would not prevent food 
manufacturers switching from messages regulated by the FDA to ones that were 
not. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Silverglade of the Center for Science in the Public Interest said: "As 
soon as it defines one set of terms, like 'high fiber,' food companies may come 
up with something like 'fiber rich' and evade the agency's official 
designation." 
</P>
<P>
One food-labeling bill, sponsored by Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) and 
Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) would prohibit using undefined label 
terminology without FDA approval.

WHITE HOUSE BACKS PLAN TO CURB CIGARETTE MARKETING; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: THE PROPOSAL WOULD INCLUDE BIGGER WARNING LABELS ON PACKAGES, ADS. 
OPPONENTS SAY THE RESTRICTIONS VIOLATE FREE SPEECH GUARANTEES.

<P>
The Bush Administration, while opposing some proposed new restrictions on 
cigarette marketing, expressed support Thursday for larger and more prominent 
warning labels on cigarette packages, billboards and print ads. 
</P>
<P>
The bigger labels, including one that would read "Cigarettes Kill," were 
endorsed by James O. Mason, assistant health and human services secretary, 
during a packed congressional hearing on a sweeping initiative to restrict 
cigarette advertising and promotion. 
</P>
<P>
One provision of the bill calls for bluntly worded warnings emblazoned across 
the top 20% of any cigarette ad. It would require similar warnings that fill 
25% of the two most visible sides of a pack of cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
"Current labeling . . . is inadequate and warrants reform," Mason told the 
House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health and the environment. He said 
that existing warning labels are "too small." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed new rotating labels would include warnings that "Tobacco Is An 
Addicting Drug" and "Cigarette Smoke Harms Nonsmokers." Others would state 
flatly that cigarettes cause lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema and stroke 
and may cause fetal injury. 
</P>
<P>
The pending legislation, sponsored by subcommittee chairman Henry A. Waxman 
(D-Los Angeles), represents the latest battleground between smoking foes and 
the $40-billion-a-year tobacco industry and its congressional allies. 
</P>
<P>
At Thursday's hearing, the initiative was alternately praised as "the most 
important pro-health bill" in 52 years and denounced as "the most 
unconstitutional advertising proposal ever considered by Congress." 
</P>
<P>
At stake, proponents said, is whether to allow tobacco firms to continue to 
lure 3,000 young people a day into an addictive habit that kills 390,000 
Americans annually and costs billions of dollars in health care and lost 
productivity. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents, including advertising industry leaders and the American Civil 
Liberties Union, countered that the issue is whether Congress should attempt to 
restrict constitutionally protected free speech. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, a compendium of anti-smoking initiatives, would bar the use of 
human or cartoon figures in advertising by allowing only "tombstone" ads 
containing written text but no illustration other than a picture of the 
cigarette brand. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents said that the restriction would prevent tobacco companies from 
targeting young people, women and minorities with ads that associate smoking 
with sex appeal, glamour and success. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal would prohibit tobacco companies from sponsoring athletic, musical 
and artistic events and distributing free samples. It would permit states to 
ban cigarette advertising by rescinding a federal prohibition against state 
regulation of such ads. 
</P>
<P>
The measure also would withhold federal alcohol and drug-abuse funds from 
states that fail to adopt laws setting and enforcing a minimum age of 19 for 
cigarette purchases and prohibiting sales from vending machines accessible to 
minors. Current state laws restricting sales to minors are generally not 
enforced, according to a recent HHS study. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman's proposal is modeled after similar controls adopted in Canada, France 
and Australia. In Canada, such restrictions and other recent anti-tobacco 
measures led to a 12% decline in smoking in the first five months of 1990, Ken 
Kyle, public issues director for the Canadian Cancer Society, told the panel. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the tobacco industry, which spends $3.3 billion annually on 
advertising, expressed vehement opposition to each of the bill's provisions, 
most of which they called misguided. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no proof that anybody starts to smoke because of advertising," said 
Charles O. Whitley, senior consultant to the Tobacco Institute, the industry 
lobbying group. "Peers, siblings, parents and co-workers are the forces behind 
smoking." 
</P>
<P>
The industry spokesmen denied that cigarette advertising targets youth, 
insisting that firms advertise to persuade smokers to switch brands or to stick 
with brands. 
</P>
<P>
Larger warnings are unnecessary because surveys show that more than 90% of 
Americans already believe that smoking is dangerous, the spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
The pending bill would amount "to total prohibition of advertising and 
promotion of tobacco products (because) the only message that would be left 
would be one that says, 'Don't buy this product,' " Whitley said. 
</P>
<P>
Mason said that he and HHS Secretary Louis W. Sullivan oppose withholding 
federal funds if states do not crack down on sales of cigarettes to minors.

MIKE DOWNEY: A FEW TALES FROM GAME'S DARK SIDE

<P>
Next time you feel like skipping work or school or anything else, do what 
baseball players do. Don't just call in sick. Call in with a really scary 
story: 
</P>
<P>
"I won't be in today." 
</P>
<P>
"Why not?" 
</P>
<P>
"Spiders." 
</P>
<P>
Or: 
</P>
<P>
"I won't be in today." 
</P>
<P>
"Why not?" 
</P>
<P>
"Sleepwalking." 
</P>
<P>
Or: 
</P>
<P>
"I won't be in today." 
</P>
<P>
"Why not?" 
</P>
<P>
"Vertigo." 
</P>
<P>
Each of those excuses is one actually used by major league ballplayers during 
the last calendar year to get out of playing ball. 
</P>
<P>
OK, maybe "excuses" is unfair. "Explanations," let's say. 
</P>
<P>
Long ago we gave up on the notion that the work force was occupied by a bunch 
of Lou Gehrigs who played in pain, with broken noses, busted fingers and 
swollen joints. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, occasionally a Steve Garvey or a Billy Williams or a Cal Ripken 
Jr. came along to remind us that there were still individuals out there who not 
only came to work, but came to play. Garvey would have played with his arm in a 
cast if he could have. Williams went years without missing a game, same as 
Ripken is doing at present. 
</P>
<P>
But then there are the Toronto Blue Jays, the first team in baseball that ought 
to be managed by Stephen King. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, this guy writes about killer Plymouths and St. Bernards. He should do 
something on a haunted ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
About a week ago, a Toronto player named Glenallen Hill came to the ballpark on 
crutches and said he couldn't work that day. Naturally, the boss asked him why 
not. 
</P>
<P>
Spiders, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not slipping on a bar of soap in the shower. Not tripping over his kid's toy 
truck. Not getting rear-ended by a little old lady from Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
Spiders. 
</P>
<P>
Glenallen Hill got hurt because spiders attacked him in his sleep. Glenallen 
hates spiders. Glenallen hates spiders the way Winston Smith hated rats in 
George Orwell's "1984." Glenallen hates spiders so much, he can't even dream 
about spiders without freaking out. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-nightmare, the 25-year-old outfielder jumped out of bed and started 
slamming against the bedroom walls, going bing-bong-bing like a pinball. 
Finally he got down on his hands and knees and crawled up a stairway. 
</P>
<P>
"I was dreaming about them and I was trying to get away," Glenallen told his 
boss. 
</P>
<P>
Good plan. Too bad he ended up with cuts all over his arms and legs, not to 
mention rug burns on his knees. His wife had to rush him to a hospital, then 
return home to wash his blood off the walls. 
</P>
<P>
Poor Glenallen is in such bad shape, Thursday he was placed on the 15-day 
disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
Just imagine how terrifying this whole business must have been for Glenallen. 
Imagine how much trouble he must have had falling asleep the next night, with 
all those imaginary spiders crawling around. He probably had to count sheep to 
fall asleep, unless of course Glenallen also suffers from fear of sheep. 
</P>
<P>
By itself, this might not be much of a story. I mean, we're not exactly talking 
Tales From the Crypt here. 
</P>
<P>
Only this isn't the first time something like this has happened to a Toronto 
player. 
</P>
<P>
One morning last season, Blue Jay pitcher David Wells had to miss work because 
of something that happened in his sleep. 
</P>
<P>
In the middle of the night, Wells said he suddenly started sleepwalking. He 
walked right over to a bedroom window and smashed his pitching hand through the 
glass. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, it is becoming a scary place to play baseball, Toronto. Guys in the 
minor leagues speak of going to the Show. Guys in Toronto's organization speak 
of going to the Creepshow. They shouldn't call this team the Blue Jays, they 
should call them the Ravens. 
</P>
<P>
As if this baseball season needed one more Hitchcockian twist, let us not 
forget Nick Esasky, first baseman for the Atlanta Braves who announced one day 
that he could no longer play baseball because he was suffering from vertigo. 
</P>
<P>
This was a new one on us. Frankly, we can't recall how serious Esasky's 
condition was -- airplane travel or bending down to field grounders. 
</P>
<P>
We do not mean to sound unsympathetic. These guys aren't alone in their fears. 
Jackie Jensen retired from baseball because of his fear of flying. Jim 
Eisenreich has overcome Tourette Syndrome. It is no laughing matter. 
</P>
<P>
Still, I'd hate to be the Toronto manager next time the phone rings. 
</P>
<P>
"Hello, boss? Listen, I won't be in today. Last night I was sound asleep when, 
all of a sudden, under my bed . . . "

CLAIRE SAYS GIBSON ISSUED TRADE DEMAND 
</P>

<P>
Dodger Vice President Fred Claire confirmed Thursday that outfielder Kirk 
Gibson has demanded a trade, hoping to join a team closer to his family in 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
"In our meeting Sunday, Kirk demanded a trade," Claire said, referring to the 
shouting match Sunday between him and Gibson in Manager Tom Lasorda's office. 
</P>
<P>
However, Claire said this does not mean he will trade Gibson before the 
outfielder leaves the Dodgers as a free agent after the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't trade a player just because he wants to be traded," Claire said. "And 
I can't release him. I have to do what is in the best interest of the club, and 
get the best thing in return. Right now, Kirk is a member of this ballclub, and 
I cannot forecast the future." 
</P>
<P>
Claire was responding to published reports Thursday in which Gibson said, "I 
officially demanded to get out of here during Sunday's meeting." 
</P>
<P>
Gibson refused to comment on those reports Thursday before the Dodgers played 
the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
"If you read a quote, take it as it is," he said. "I'm not going to go over and 
over this thing. I'm not going to beleaguer (sic) a point." 
</P>
<P>
Claire also confirmed earlier reports that Gibson, through a representative, 
presented Claire with the idea of a trade several weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"On June 19, Kirk's agent, Doug Baldwin, called and said that he had talked to 
Kirk and that Kirk wanted me to know he would be better off closer to home, and 
better off in the American league," Claire said. "Doug placed no demands on me 
but said Kirk wanted to be closer to home because of personal reasons." 
</P>
<P>
Claire said the published report of Baldwin's request caused Gibson distress. 
This may have helped lead to Sunday's shouting match, during which Claire 
reportedly accused Gibson of having a bad attitude. Gibson reportedly accused 
the Dodgers of not appreciating that he is playing out of position in center 
field. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a troubling story, it brought everything to the forefront," Claire 
said. "Kirk felt the ballclub was somehow responsible for the story, and to my 
knowledge, we were not responsible." 
</P>
<P>
About Sunday's argument with Gibson, Claire said: "Tempers flared and, 
unfortunately, I can't change that. I shook hands with Kirk at the end of that 
meeting, and I accept responsibility for what happened in that meeting." 
</P>
<P>
Gibson is batting .250 in 25 games, with three home runs and 17 runs batted in, 
since returning from knee surgery last August. He is best known for helping 
lead the Dodgers to the World Series title in 1988, the year he was named the 
National League's most valuable player. He won Game 1 of the 1988 World Series 
against the Oakland Athletics with a ninth-inning, two-run pinch home run. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson, 33, can be an imposing figure on the field. But at least one veteran 
Dodger said Thursday that an unhappy player can also be a detriment. 
</P>
<P>
"In general, how can you expect a guy who doesn't want to be here to be able to 
do the little-bitty things that winning teams have to have?" catcher Rick 
Dempsey said. "If a guy's heart is not in it, how can you expect him to do 
everything it takes to win? 
</P>
<P>
"If anybody's heart is not with this team, go ahead and get that person out of 
here, and let's go on and play some baseball again." 
</P>
<P>
With Gibson's demand made public, it will be difficult for the Dodgers to fill 
their biggest need, a fifth starting pitcher, by trading him. Claire may have 
to wait until August, when pennant-contending teams are as desperate to acquire 
a left-handed power hitter as the Dodgers are to get rid of one.

THE NO-HITTERS JUST KEEP ON COMING; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: MELIDO PEREZ'S SIX-INNING BLANKING OF THE YANKEES TIES A RECORD OF 
SEVEN IN ONE SEASON AND MATCHES A FEAT BY HIS BROTHER PASCUAL IN 1988. ANDY 
HAWKINS GETS THE LOSS.

<P>
Melido Perez matched a record and his brother. 
</P>
<P>
Perez pitched the record-tying seventh no-hitter of the season Thursday night 
as the Chicago White Sox beat the New York Yankees, 8-0, in a game shortened by 
rain to six innings. 
</P>
<P>
Perez's no-hitter, which matched the record set in 1908 and tied in 1917, was a 
record sixth in the American League this season and the first shortened by rain 
since Sept. 24, 1988. That's when his brother Pascual, who was watching 
Thursday night from the Yankee dugout, threw one over five innings for Montreal 
against Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think about it at first, but then I remembered when my brother threw 
a no-hitter in the rain," Melido Perez said. "I started to think, 'That might 
happen to me, too.' " 
</P>
<P>
It was only the second time brothers have pitched no-hitters in the majors, 
matching the accomplishment of Ken and Bob Forsch. Ken pitched one on April 7, 
1979, for Houston against Atlanta and Bob threw two for St. Louis -- April 16, 
1978, and Sept. 26, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy because I got my first no-hitter and because my brother was here," 
Melido said. 
</P>
<P>
Pascual, who hasn't pitched since April 25 because of arm problems, was equally 
elated even though his team lost. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted him to pitch well, but I wanted us to win," Pascual said. "Maybe it 
would have been better if he had pitched a no-hitter and lost." 
</P>
<P>
That's what happened last week to Yankee starter Andy Hawkins (1-7). He held 
the White Sox hitless on July 1 at Comiskey Park but lost the game, 4-0, when 
Chicago scored four runs in the eighth inning on two walks and three errors. 
</P>
<P>
"It's strange, all these no-hitters," Hawkins said. "But just because I was on 
the mound having one thrown against us doesn't make any difference to me. I 
just wasn't very good tonight. The guy across the field was better." 
</P>
<P>
Pascual said he was hoping his brother could throw the no-hitter. But after 
experiencing Hawkins' losing no-hitter, Pascual wouldn't take anything for 
granted. 
</P>
<P>
"I just knew he was throwing hard and pitching well," Pascual said. "But you 
got to be lucky, man. Look what happened to Andy. What can I say? I'm happy. I 
know we lost, but he's my brother. He would have been rooting for me if I was 
throwing it." 
</P>
<P>
Melido, a 24-year-old right-hander in his third major league season, struck out 
nine and walked four. The closest the Yankees came to a hit was with two out in 
the fifth inning, when Alvaro Espinoza hit a high drive to right-center field. 
Center fielder Lance Johnson made a running catch. 
</P>
<P>
"Espinoza hit the ball good and we were playing him shallow," Melido said. 
"Lance made a good play, and when I saw he caught it, I knew the no-hitter was 
still there." 
</P>
<P>
Pascual was more anxious than his brother at that point. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a chaw of tobacco and I almost swallowed it when Espinoza hit that 
ball." 
</P>
<P>
"I figured I had no chance," Johnson said. "I thought I was too shallow. I knew 
it was a no-hitter and I was going to stretch and dive as far as I could. The 
ball was tailing away and it wasn't great running conditions." 
</P>
<P>
Melido came into the game with a 7-7 record and a 3.88 earned-run average. His 
previous low-hit game was a two-hitter against the Angels on Sept. 15, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
With one out in the top of the seventh inning, Dan Pasqua doubled. Home plate 
umpire Tim Tschida ordered the field to be covered. The game was called after a 
1-hour 3-minute wait. 
</P>
<P>
"It bothers me a little, because I think I could have gone all the way," Melido 
said. "But it is still a no-hitter." 
</P>
<P>
Chicago Manager Jeff Torborg would have been in a bind if the game had resumed. 
He would have had to decide whether he wanted Perez to warm up again and 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad I didn't have to make that decision," Torborg said. "The guy is so 
young that you're afraid to hurt his arm. But we would have sent him back out 
for warmups and taken it one pitch at a time. When a guy has a no-hitter, you 
have to at least give him a chance." 
</P>
<P>
Of 17,586 who showed up, very few remained during the rain delay. A stream of 
cars left the Yankee Stadium parking lots once the game was delayed. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first no-hitter against the Yankees since Hoyt Wilhelm of Baltimore 
did it Sept. 20, 1958. It was the first no-hitter for the White Sox since Joe 
Cowley did it against the Angels Sept. 19, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' Mark Langston and Mike Witt started the no-hit parade this season 
on April 11, beating Seattle. Randy Johnson of the Mariners pitched the first 
of a record-five no-hitters in June against Detroit, and he was followed by 
Nolan Ryan of Texas, who pitched the record sixth of his career. Fernando 
Valenzuela of the Dodgers and Dave Stewart Oakland each pitched no-hitters on 
June 29 and then came Hawkins' losing effort. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins extended his no-hit streak against Chicago to 10 1/3 innings Thursday 
night before Sammy Sosa singled in the third. Ozzie Guillen singled and Johnson 
gave the White Sox a 3-0 lead with his first major league home run. 
</P>
<P>
Sosa added an RBI single in the fourth and the White Sox pulled away with four 
runs in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Still glowing in his brother's feat, Pascual realized he had one more 
obligation. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to call my mother," he said.

MORNING BRIEFING: GODZILLA HAD TO RISE FROM THIS SLIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED BROCK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stan Lesniak of Littlerock, Calif., will compete in Sunday's Ironman Triathlon 
at Hakone, Japan. The 33-year-old developer has been training three to four 
hours each day, sometimes beginning with a 50-mile bike ride at 4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Lesniak expects to benefit from training in the high desert heat. However, he 
told Bob Schaller of the Antelope Valley Press that Japan's Lake Biwa will be 
nothing like the Eastside Pool in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all green and slimy," Lesniak said of Lake Biwa. "You come out of it 
looking like the Hulk. You're all green. Bill Bixby (star of 'The Incredible 
Hulk' television series) would really like it." 
</P>
<P>
Old money: This will come as no solace to San Francisco Giant owner Bob Lurie, 
nor will it interest Raider owner Al Davis. But for what it's worth, Yankee 
Stadium cost co-owners Col. Jacob Ruppert and Col. Tillinghast Huston $2.5 
million in 1921. For the 11.6 acres of Bronx farmland where the stadium was 
built, they paid $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
So, as "The Yankee Encyclopedia" suggests, Babe Ruth's popularity, plus the 
legalization of Sunday baseball in New York, may have pointed the way, but 
America's most famous stadium was the house that private funding built. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Who hit the most home runs at Yankee Stadium? 
</P>
<P>
Amendment to excellence: From the Associated Press: "(Coach Art) Shell 
succeeded Mike Shanahan after the Raiders got off to a 1-3 start and led them 
to an 8-8 record in 1989. But that was marred by the fact the Raiders finished 
the year with losses at Seattle and New Jersey, when one win would have gotten 
them into the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders never did match up well with the Nets. 
</P>
<P>
Start your engines: When Mike Harris of the Associated Press asked 
actor-entrepreneur-race driver Paul Newman his opinion of "Days of Thunder," 
Newman shifted gears and began praising his own racing film, "Winning," made in 
1968. 
</P>
<P>
"Not because the racing footage was the best or anything," Newman said, "but 
because the people integrated into the racing. And usually you find that people 
are inserted, or transplanted on top of, or glued to the story . . . If they 
could do a great story about racing, it would be really exciting, I think. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the temptation to make a picture about the car ultimately overwhelms 
the human aspect of it because it would appear, on the surface, to be a much 
more cinematic impact. 
</P>
<P>
"Great movies ultimately have to be about people." 
</P>
<P>
The shirt off his back: As a high school football player in New York, Rob Moore 
would visit Jet practices to watch his favorite player, Wesley Walker. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets, who chose the former Syracuse wide receiver in Tuesday's NFL 
supplemental draft, announced that Moore will wear Walker's old jersey number, 
85. 
</P>
<P>
No coincidence. It was Walker's idea. 
</P>
<P>
Speech therapy: These trades, from "The Baseball Encyclopedia," may or may not 
have pleased the teams involved, but they left more than one announcer 
tongue-tied: George Burns for Bill Wambsganss (1924); Bob Smith for Wes 
Schulmerich (1930); Eddie Miller for Johnny Wyrostek (1948); Jimmie Hall for 
Terry Bongiovanni (1969); Ed Herrmann for Fred Anyzeski (1975). 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Mickey Mantle, 266. 
</P>

Alzado, Bert Jones and Mark Gastineau are making, or considering, comebacks:

SPORTSCHANNEL, BIG WEST AGREE TO A SIX-YEAR DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Big West Conference, which recently was released from its contract with 
Prime Ticket because of scheduling conflicts, has reached an agreement with 
SportsChannel. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said SportsChannel will pay $3.4 million over six years for the rights 
to 52 events a year, highlighted by 10 football games and 20 men's basketball 
games. 
</P>
<P>
But there is some controversy over how that money will be divided. 
</P>
<P>
Creative Sports Marketing, a North Carolina-based company owned by Bray Cary, 
has been negotiating the TV rights for the Big West. 
</P>
<P>
Cary's competitors claim that by the time the contract expires, Cary's company 
will have received an unusually high 50% of the rights fees, or $1.7 million, 
shortchanging the member schools. 
</P>
<P>
Robert L. Schibel, a Los Angeles-based attorney representing unnamed parties 
identified only as concerned taxpayers, recently sent letters to presidents of 
the Big West schools threatening legal action. 
</P>
<P>
Schibel said the Big West Conference did not seek competitive bids for its 
television rights. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the SportsChannel deal also point out that the Big West's exposure 
has been reduced from 4.1 million homes, Prime Ticket's subscriber base, to 
about 100,000, which reportedly is SportsChannel's base. 
</P>
<P>
However, in a prepared statement, Big West Commissioner James Haney said: "The 
Big West Conference is extremely pleased to have its teams showcased on 
SportsChannel, and we look forward to a long and rewarding relationship." 
</P>
<P>
The deal also includes the California Raisin Bowl, plus baseball, women's 
basketball and volleyball. LARRY STEWART

TV-RADIO: SPORTSCASTER MAKES CLIMB, FRIENDS ON MOUNT KILIMANJARO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine, you're a network sportscaster, covering college basketball in 
February, when your boss calls and says, "Next week, we're sending you to 
Africa to cover an attempt to climb Mount Kilimanjaro. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll be accompanying a group of mentally disabled young people on the climb. 
Oh, and take warm clothing. You'll need it." 
</P>
<P>
It happened to James Brown of CBS. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be honest about it," Brown said Thursday from his home in Washington. 
"When I was first told about it, I hated the assignment. I asked Ted Shaker 
(Brown's boss), 'Does my job depend on whether or not I go?' 
</P>
<P>
"Here I was, preparing to do an Oklahoma-Seton Hall basketball game when I got 
seven days' notice that I was going to Africa. I had to get a passport, a visa 
and vaccine shots, but mostly I was concerned about the danger of the trip, and 
my health. I wasn't in the kind of physical shape needed to make a climb like 
that, and I had no experience." 
</P>
<P>
Well, Brown made the trip, survived, and is a key part of an emotion-packed 
one-hour special that will be part of this weekend's CBS "Sports Sunday" show 
at 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
For Brown, the assignment he didn't want turned out to be one of the most 
rewarding things he's ever done. The best part, he said, was making new 
friends. He called it "emotional bonding." 
</P>
<P>
"I'd gladly do it again," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
The climb was the idea of Jim Benson of Newport Beach, who is president of a 
Los Angeles executive benefits consulting company. Three years ago, Benson, 
also a member of the Special Olympics board, organized a bike ride across 
America by a group of 25 mentally disabled people. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve mentally disabled Californians, ranging in age from 19 to 30, went on 
the Kilimanjaro venture, accompanied by a coach for each and an independent 
film crew headed by Emmy Award-winning producer Mike Tollin. 
</P>
<P>
Benson's goal is to show the world, as the Special Olympics creed states, that 
"ordinary people can do extraordinary things." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's TV special is titled, "Let Me Be Brave," which is a takeoff on the 
Special Olympics motto: "Let me win, but if I can not win, let me be brave in 
the attempt." 
</P>
<P>
Mount Kilimanjaro, at 19,342 feet, is Africa's highest mountain, and is 5,000 
feet higher than any mountain in the United States, excepting Alaska. 
Kilimanjaro is located about 150 miles south of Nairobi on the border between 
Kenya and Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
The group left Feb. 15, and five of the 12 athletes, their coaches, two 
cameramen and two soundmen made it to the top on Feb. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the group were sent back to base camp in Arusha, Tanzania, after the 
worst snowstorm in more than 20 years hit while the expedition was at about 
16,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Six of the 12 were picked to continue, but one, Diane Hall of Santee, the 
youngest at 19 and the only woman, became ill and could not continue. 
</P>
<P>
One who did make it to the top, Joe Hayden, 22, of Westmorland, at first said 
he didn't want to go on without Brown, his new friend. 
</P>
<P>
Said Brown: "He told me he was scared, and wanted me to accompany him. But the 
organizers thought it best if I didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"We hugged, and he told me he was going to make the climb for me." 
</P>
<P>
The group that continued to the summit returned to base camp a day after the 
others. 
</P>
<P>
Producer Tollin said: "When the two groups were reunited, the emotion was 
unbelievable. There was no jealousy about who got to go on and who didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Only about 25% of the people who attempt to climb Kilimanjaro make it to the 
top. This group did better than that, despite terrible weather conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"Here were people who had been told about limitations all their lives," Tollin 
said. "But as a group, they had shown what they could do. It didn't matter 
which individuals had made it to the top. They had accomplished something 
extraordinary as a group." 
</P>
<P>
Golf, TV style: ABC this weekend offers the U.S. Women's Open, while NBC and 
CBS offer made-for-TV golf. 
</P>
<P>
The NBC golf is a live telecast of a two-day celebrity tournament at Lake 
Tahoe. The competitors, a combination of athletes and entertainers, include 
Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
The CBS golf is the two-day Norman Challenge, taped this week in Arkansas. Greg 
Norman competes against Wayne Gretzky, Larry Bird and Ivan Lendl, who play a 
scramble format. 
</P>
<P>
It was touch and go whether Gretzky would be able to compete. His wife gave 
birth to a son Monday, and Gretzky flew to Arkansas on Bruce McNall's jet the 
next day, getting there just in time for the taping. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky carries a 14 handicap. "If I shoot in the 80s, I'm happy," he said from 
Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides were both at 33 after the first nine-hole round. We won't spoil 
the suspense. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy preparation: Four years ago, the first Goodwill Games in Moscow were a 
yawner and lost $26 million. 
</P>
<P>
The second Goodwill Games begin in Seattle a week from today, and this time Ted 
Turner has provided a $22-million budget for television coverage, with the 
mandate that it be innovative. 
</P>
<P>
To assure that it is, Turner hired Tony Verna as the executive producer. He 
also named Larry King as the host. 
</P>
<P>
Verna, who invented instant replay in 1963 when he was at CBS, has come up with 
a number of new twists for the Goodwill Games, such as having athletes interact 
with family and friends back in their homelands after their events. 
</P>
<P>
One thing is for sure: A lot of planning has gone into the TV coverage. Verna 
and Turner's public relations people have put out reams of copy about it. "We 
call it PR by the ton," one staffer said. 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
CBS has given Pat O'Brien a four-year contract that carries a yearly salary in 
the $500,000-to-$600,000 range, according to a source. CBS has big plans for 
O'Brien, including a late-night show. Three one-hour segments of "Overtime With 
Pat O'Brien," a talk show with sports and entertainment personalties, will be 
televised on three Fridays during August, at 11:30 p.m. Also, with Greg Gumbel 
moving over from baseball to the host role on "NFL Today," O'Brien figures to 
assume the host role on CBS' baseball coverage. . . . Speaking of "NFL Today," 
ESPN has decided to put its pregame show, "NFL GameDay," up against the 
networks and air it from 9 to 10 a.m. on Sundays this fall. . . . TNT 
reportedly plans to use Larry King in an unspecified role on its new pregame 
NFL show on Sunday nights. 
</P>
<P>
CBS says the All-Star game got an 18.5 national Nielsen rating. NBC had an 18.2 
rating last year. But NBC and ABC officials point out the 18.5 doesn't include 
the part of the game that came after the rain delay. CBS counters that the 
reason is simply because non prime-time ratings -- it was past prime time in 
the East -- are not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Chuck Daly has decided to stay as coach of the Detroit Pistons, it's 
unknown who will be NBC's two NBA commentators. The candidates include Mike 
Fratello, Doug Moe and Earl Strom. NBC probably will name at least one fairly 
soon, since it will televise Magic Johnson's "Midsummer Night's Magic" all-star 
game at the Forum on Aug. 11. Marv Albert is scheduled to handle the 
play-by-play. Interestingly, Prime Ticket will produce the coverage for NBC, 
even though NBC owns half of SportsChannel. . . . Prime Ticket has made a deal 
with the Raiders to televise two exhibition games on a tape-delayed basis. . . 
. SportsChannel's Canadian Football League coverage begins tonight, with the 
British Columbia Lions facing the Calgary Stampeders in a delayed telecast at 
10:30 p.m. Doug Flutie and Mark Gastineau play for the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 11 sportscaster Rick Garcia is rumored to be headed for Chicago, with 
Phil Stone replacing him. . . . Former New York Met Manager Davey Johnson will 
be an analyst on NBC's coverage of the July 21 baseball game in Havana pitting 
the U.S. team against Cuba. . . . Brent Musburger's first "Wide World of 
Sports" appearance will be on July 21, when he covers horse racing. . . . 
Ratings game: Although the World Cup final got only a 2.2 national cable 
rating, which translates to about a 1 rating overall, the soccer match drew an 
L.A. rating of 7.6 on Channel 34, the highest L.A. sports rating of the day. 
The Jorge Paez-Troy Dorsey delayed fight on NBC drew a 5.7, the men's final at 
Wimbledon a 5.5.

GOLF ROUNDUP: GEDDES, SHEEHAN SET OPEN RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
Jane Geddes and Patty Sheehan had the best first-round scores in U.S. Women's 
Open history to share the lead in the $500,000 event at Duluth, Ga., with 
six-under-par 66s on a rainy Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The two held a two-shot lead over Nancy Lopez, who doesn't include this 
nation's national title among her 42 career victories. 
</P>
<P>
Play on the 6,298-yard Riverside Course of the Atlanta Athletic Club was 
suspended twice by rain and lightning, the last time at 7:40 p.m. EDT. Thirty 
golfers were on the course when play was suspended. 
</P>
<P>
The USGA said the second round was to begin as scheduled this morning, with the 
30 players picking up where they left off at 1 1/2 hours later to complete the 
opening round. 
</P>
<P>
Geddes, the 1986 Open champion, finished her bogey-free round late in the day 
after a 65-minute delay because of a thunderstorm. 
</P>
<P>
Sheehan, a three-time winner and the leading money-winner on the LPGA Tour this 
year, had eight birdies and two bogeys, finishing before the midafternoon 
delay. 
</P>
<P>
The previous best first round was a 67 by Liselotte Neumann in 1988 and matched 
by defending champion Betsy King last year. 
</P>
<P>
"This golf course lends itself to making more birdies than I've ever seen at 
the U.S. Open," Sheehan said. 
</P>
<P>
"I really did not expect the course to be that scoreable," Geddes said. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Smith, back on the PGA Tour after playing in Europe for two years, shot a 
six-under-par 65 for a two-stroke lead after the opening round of a $900,000 
tournament at Sutton, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who regained his card with a 47th-place finish in the PGA qualifying 
school last fall, had nine birdies, three bogeys and six pars in what he called 
"the best round I've ever had in the rain." 
</P>
<P>
Scott Verplank and Bill Glasson were tied for second at 67. 
</P>
<P>
Starting on the 10th tee, Smith began with a bogey, but picked up confidence 
with a 15-foot putt for a par on his second hole. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after sitting out a late-morning rain delay of 1 hour and 37 minutes, he 
completed the back nine in 33, two under par. He birdied four of the first five 
holes on the front nine, which he finished in 32. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Brand Jr. of Scotland shot a 67, giving him a two-round total of 132 in 
the $600,000 Scottish Open at Gleneagles, but he has only a two-stroke lead 
because Ian Woosnam of Wales shot a nine-under-par 62. 
</P>
<P>
Woosnam, Europe's leading money-winner this season, sank eagle putts of 40 
yards on the sixth hole and 25 feet on the 18th and had six birdies for a 
36-hole score of 134. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Faldo of England birdied the last two holes to finish with a 73 and 145 
for two rounds, maintaining his record of not missing the cut in a European 
tournament since the 1986 German Open.

FLORIDA TEEN-AGER PITCHES TWO 5-INNING NO-HITTERS ON SAME NIGHT

In a year of no-hitters, Tom Laraway threw two in one night. 
</P>
<P>
Laraway, 17, was unhittable in both games of an American Legion doubleheader 
Wednesday as the DeLand Chipmunks twice beat Flagler Palm Coast, 10-0, in five 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
Each game was shortened because of the 10-run rule. 
</P>
<P>
"The second game was great," Laraway said. "I had everything working for me. 
The first game was good, but I threw much better the second game." 
</P>
<P>
After the first no-hitter, DeLand Coach Paul Peacock decided to see how far 
Laraway could go in the nightcap. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom has a rubber arm," Peacock said. "He can just keep throwing. His arm was 
feeling great in the second game, so I just told him to go out there and have 
fun. 
</P>
<P>
"He knew he had a chance to make history, but he kept his composure until the 
end. He just went out there and threw strikes." 
</P>
<P>
Flagler hit only two balls hard, both in the second game. A hard grounder down 
the third-base line went foul, and a hard grounder was fielded by the first 
baseman, who made the putout.

The director for the Great American Bank Tennis tournament said that Steffi 
Graf will be playing in the San Diego event Aug. 6-12 despite published reports 
that she would take a month off after a sinus operation in Heidelberg, West 
Germany, last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Stratton said Graf's agent, Philip de Picciotto of Advantage 
International, confirmed Graf would compete in the event after the Players' 
Canadian Open in Montreal July 30-Aug. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Graf has pulled out of the Federation Cup team event in Atlanta starting July 
23. 
</P>
<P>
Graf said at Wimbledon that she had planned the operation for the end of the 
year but was persuaded by doctors to seek an earlier solution to the sinus 
problem that had troubled her for some time.

MOSES SUPPORTS USOC OFFER TO TAKE OVER DRUG TESTING 
</P>

<P>
Putting the U.S. Olympic Committee in charge of drug testing for all sports 
will create a more efficient and economical system, Edwin Moses said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The governing bodies of each sport, such as The Athletics Congress for track, 
are responsible for testing their own athletes, resulting in disparate 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
But USOC President Robert Helmick said this week that his organization will 
take over those chores and implement out-of-competition, year-round testing for 
any sport that requests it. Moses, who heads the USOC's drug control committee, 
supports that approach. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll work," he said at the U.S. Olympic Festival. "There's no need for track 
and field or any other sport to have to do this when it can be done by one 
group." 
</P>
<P>
Moses, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, said many national governing boards 
don't have the staff or money to run a drug-testing program while others, such 
as TAC, have long-established programs with large budgets. 
</P>
<P>
Despite those expenditures, TAC has been criticized recently for running sloppy 
and selective drug-testing procedures. To head off that criticism, Executive 
Director Ollan Cassell has asked the USOC to assume TAC's drug-testing 
responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Henson, in charge of the track competition at the Olympic Festival, said: 
"I think the public perception is going to be that TAC is not policing itself, 
that you have an outside body, so they might accept it a little bit more."

A lack of marquee names didn't keep three U.S. Olympic Festival track and field 
records from being broken Thursday, the first day of competition. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Deal of Casper, Wyo., threw the hammer farther than any American this 
year, while Schowanda Williams of Baton Rouge, La., set a festival record in 
the 400-meter hurdles and Shelly Steely of Eugene, Ore., broke the 10,000-meter 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Skies around the Twin Cities cleared Thursday, allowing the baseball medal 
games to be played one day late. Aaron Knieper of Saginaw, Mich., pitched 6 2/3 
innings, had two hits and drove in four runs as the North beat the West, 7-4, 
for the gold medal. The East beat the South, 7-3, for the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-2, 256-pound Deal threw the hammer 254 feet 9 inches, bettering the 
festival record of 242-5 by Jud Logan of North Canton, Ohio, in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The previous best throw this year had been 254-4 by Ken Flax of the New York 
Athletic Club. 
</P>
<P>
Deal, 28, a member of the 1988 Olympic team, finished third in The Athletics 
Congress championships this year after having won the title in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Williams arrived in Minneapolis at 1 p.m. CDT, about 3 1/2 hours before her 
race. Even so, she finished in 55.57 seconds, breaking the record of 55.63 by 
LaTanya Sheffield of El Cajon in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Steely lapped all but two runners on her way to a time of 32:41.14. The 
festival record was 33:28.21, set last year by Colette Murphy of Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
In men's gymnastics, UCLA junior Chainey Umphrey scored a 9.85 on the 
horizontal bar -- his final event of the night -- to edge Bill Roth of Temple 
for the all-around gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
Umphrey won the gold with 57.50 points, beating Roth's 57.45. Mark Warburton of 
Nebraska finished third with 56.80. 
</P>
<P>
The festival's defending three-meter diving champion, Kent Ferguson of Boca 
Raton, Fla., took the lead in Thursday night's preliminary round. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson had a score of 634.77 for his 11 dives. Pat Jeffery of Madison, N.J., 
who was third last year, finished second with 621.63, and Mark Bradshaw of 
Columbus, Ohio., was third. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's three-meter springboard, Krista Wilson of Laguna Hills, moved 
past 1988 Olympian Wendy Lucero in the seventh round to win the preliminaries. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson is one of the nation's hottest three-meter divers, coming off victories 
in the U.S. championships and NCAA meet. 
</P>
<P>
Lucero, the 1987 and 1989 festival champion from Aurora, Colo., led until the 
seventh round, when she dove poorly on a back 2 1/2 somersault tuck. Wilson 
responded with a solid effort on her most difficult dive -- a back 1 1/2 
somersault, 2 1/2 twist free -- and took the lead. She finished with 463.59 
points to Lucero's 453.90. 
</P>
<P>
The top 12 divers advanced to Saturday's finals.

DESPITE CHANGING PARTNERS, SILVA KEEPS HITTING WINNERS 
</P>

<P>
Jackie Silva may have finally found some roots in Redondo Beach, her adopted 
hometown. 
</P>
<P>
But Silva, the top player on the women's pro beach volleyball tour, is finding 
it a lot harder to settle on a partner to stand next to her in the sand for 
more than a few months -- or weeks -- at a time. 
</P>
<P>
Silva, a mercurial Brazilian, has dominated the women's tour for the last few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
But she has bounced from partner to partner -- ending a successful pairing with 
fellow South American Patty Dodd late last year, then finishing the season with 
Rita Crockett-Royster. 
</P>
<P>
Silva started this season with Orange County schoolteacher Janice Opalinski and 
won the first five tournaments of the year before she and Opalinski were 
stopped in Huntington Beach in mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
Silva will be back in the South Bay this weekend for the 25th annual John Shaw 
Manhattan Beach Open -- one of the most prestigious stops on the 16-city 
women's tour. 
</P>
<P>
But this time, she'll be paired with Karolyn Kirby, a 6-footer from San Diego 
who played most of the season with Dodd. 
</P>
<P>
It seems to make little difference with whom the top-ranked Silva plays. She 
has won 17 of the last 21 pro tournaments despite having four different 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
Silva and Kirby have already won at Laguna Beach and Honolulu and are aiming 
for a major win in one of the world's fastest-growing sports. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd will be standing in her way at Manhattan Beach, teamed with beach rookie 
Jeanne Reeves. Other top pairings are veterans Elaine Roque and Nina Matthies, 
Linda Carrillo and Linda Hanley, Opalinski and Lisa Strand, and Lori Kotas and 
Gail Castro. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the oldest tournament around, so it's definitely a tournament you want to 
win because of all the prestige," said Dodd, who lives in Manhattan Beach with 
her husband, beach volleyball star Mike Dodd. 
</P>
<P>
The silver anniversary edition of the ladies' John Shaw Open gets under way 
Saturday at 8:30 a.m. just south of Manhattan Pier. Double-elimination action 
continues throughout the weekend, with the finals set for 3 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The John Shaw Open will be taped by ESPN for airing Aug. 6. Prize money, 
boosted by television contracts, has tripled in the past three years. The purse 
at Manhattan Beach is $25,000, with the winners splitting $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
Admission to the event is free, and promoters expect a crowd of up to 25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Other weekend activities include an exhibition by a sky-diving team that will 
land on center court to drop off the game ball for Sunday's final. There will 
also be a ceremony honoring the event's past champions, a hairstyle 
competition, and serving and spiking contests.

PLEASANT CONVINCED THAT HIS PATH TO PRO TOUR INCLUDES STOP AT UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Darin Pleasant subscribes to the theory that he must take risks to lift his 
tennis game to a higher level. Pleasant will take a bold step this fall but 
feels it is necessary, nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
Aiming to play eventually on the professional tennis tour, Pleasant has left UC 
Riverside, which competes at the NCAA Division II level, and will attend UCLA, 
a Division I school, next fall. 
</P>
<P>
Because of NCAA regulations, Pleasant must sit out a season before trying to 
make the ultra-competitive Bruin team as a walk-on. Pleasant, who transferred 
to Riverside from Moorpark College last year, has not been offered a 
scholarship from UCLA, but said, "(A scholarship) has been mentioned." 
</P>
<P>
"I want to push myself so I can compete with these Division I players," 
Pleasant said. 
</P>
<P>
"If I have an ambition to go pro, then I basically have to play at that level 
and come out ranked highly." 
</P>
<P>
Pleasant, a Division II All-American, finished the season ranked 12th in 
Division II in singles. He and partner Chris Ewing were ranked third in 
doubles. 
</P>
<P>
"Darin did a great job for us and he's going on to greener pastures," Riverside 
Coach Mike Johnston said. "He was a real fine player and he really helped us." 
</P>
<P>
Johnston added that Pleasant was formidable in tournaments but could be hurt by 
a ho-hum attitude in dual-team matches. 
</P>
<P>
"He gets into tournaments and he does fantastic. He plays like there's no 
tomorrow," Johnston said. "He gets into a team match and says, 'Well, maybe 
I'll play better tomorrow.' " 
</P>
<P>
Pleasant, a junior-to-be, says that the yearlong layoff could help his game and 
that he plans to turn some heads in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be practicing every day with the team and I'll play in tournaments that 
the coach has lined up for me," he said. "As for abilitywise, I can only get 
better practicing with such good players. 
</P>
<P>
"If I keep improving the way I have, I'm sure I'll shock some people out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Blue Monday: Natasha Pospich of Woodland Hills had a rather discouraging time 
Monday at the U. S. Olympic Festival in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Pospich lost to Christine Neuman of Downers Grove, Ill., 2-6, 6-4, 6-3, in the 
second round of women's singles play. In a first-round doubles match, Pospich 
and Kristin Osmond of Worthington, Ohio, lost to Meredith Chiles of Germantown, 
Tenn., and Patty Murren of Newtown, Conn., 6-3, 7-6 (7-0). 
</P>
<P>
Sponsorless: For the fourth consecutive year, the Westlake Tennis and Swim Club 
will play host to the U. S. Tennis Assn. National Senior Hardcourt 
Championships for men in the 50 and 55 age divisions. 
</P>
<P>
Club owner Jack Darrah has not found a primary sponsor to provide $5,000 in 
prize money for the event, which will take place Oct. 15-21. 
</P>
<P>
Information: 818-889-6164. 
</P>
<P>
Back for more: Although the past season might have been his most difficult as 
Pierce College tennis coach, Paul Xanthos will be back next year, his 26th 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce once was a powerhouse, winning 50 consecutive Western State Conference 
matches from 1965-68 and 96 consecutive Metro Conference matches from 1976-87. 
The now-defunct Metro Conference included Santa Monica, Cuesta, Santa Barbara, 
Glendale, Ventura, Moorpark, Bakersfield, and West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The past season was markedly different. Pierce, ranked an uncharacteristically 
low 12th in the state, finished 11-8 overall and 11-5 in Western State 
Conference play (third place). 
</P>
<P>
"It was disappointing," said Xanthos, 69. "You learn to grin and bear it. You 
work as hard as you can with the players you have." 
</P>
<P>
The Brahmas' most critical loss came at Bakersfield. Pierce folded after its 
Nos. 1, 3, 5, and 6 players failed to arrive at the match for various reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Xanthos perhaps is most disturbed when he considers how good his team could 
have been. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson Gary, a 1987 junior college division singles finalist at the Ojai Valley 
tournament, could not play this year because of transportation problems. 
</P>
<P>
Pierre Mareschal, a doubles standout at Cal State Northridge in 1985, couldn't 
play because of financial difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
Sudantha Soysa, who, at 16, was the youngest player ever to play on the Sri 
Lankan Davis Cup team, withdrew from Pierce because of financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
The only remaining top-notch player, Al Martinez, was sidelined for much of the 
season with a shoulder injury.

As a result, the nine-man team included six freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
"You learn to grin and bear it," Xanthos said. "You work as hard as you can 
with the players you have." 
</P>
<P>
Xanthos is cautious about appraising next season's team. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a good team but how good I don't know," he said. "I need to get 
some top guns."

SMITH WORKING HARD TO BECOME THE MOST PROFESSIONAL SURFER HE CAN BE

The last time the Assn. of Surfing Professionals world tour came here in 1988, 
Colin Smith had just graduated from San Dieguito High School. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was a contestant then but not a regular. He was young -- 18 -- but not 
terribly so by surfing standards. He had ability and experience but not enough 
to challenge the best surfers in the world. 
</P>
<P>
He was knocked out in his first qualifying heat. "I was pretty green then," 
Smith said. "I didn't know what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
Smith knew he needed something more than raw ability to push him over the top. 
He decided it would be total dedication to the sport. If he was going to make 
it as a professional, he needed to become a professional. 
</P>
<P>
And in his first full year on the world tour, Smith is as dedicated as any. 
</P>
<P>
He was ranked 74th -- fairly high for a rookie this early in the season -- 
heading into this week's $112,500 Life's A Beach contest at the Oceanside Pier, 
the largest summer stop on the 1990 ASP world tour. 
</P>
<P>
Despite losing a close heat to Hawaii's John Shimooka, 71-69, in Thursday's 
main event, Smith will move up in the ratings. He finished tied for 33rd and 
earned $800 to raise his season total to $2,050. 
</P>
<P>
Against Shimooka, who finished 32nd in the world last year, Smith took command 
midway through their 20-minute heat and led by 3.5 points with less than 30 
seconds left. But Shimooka's last ride scored an 18.0, enough to push him 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
With three seconds left, Smith caught a last ride but could manage only a 16.5, 
a mark that did not raise his total because he already had two 17.5s and two 
17.0s. Shimooka scored 20.0 on his first and best wave, 14.5, 18.5 and 18.0. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Smith was nowhere near this level of competition. Oh, he surfed 
every day, didn't use drugs or alcohol and stayed out of trouble. But that 
wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
In the early days of surfing -- and just a few years ago, for that matter -- 
surfers stayed in shape mainly by surfing. Smith was the same way. 
</P>
<P>
Got a big contest coming up? Better get in the water. 
</P>
<P>
But now, when guys are earning $100,000 a year in prize money alone, training 
and health care have become essential. 
</P>
<P>
Smith got the message soon enough and began a full-scale health and training 
program. 
</P>
<P>
He went to Coast Gym in Solana Beach and was introduced to Maylen (which he 
uses as his full name), a former Mr. California in bodybuilding and a strength 
coach for the Chargers for 15 years in the 1960s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
Maylen set up a regimen for Smith, which included lifting weights for two hours 
five days a week, riding a mountain bike approximately 50 miles a week and 
sticking to a rich in carbohydrates and protein and low in dairy products and 
red meat. 
</P>
<P>
Maylen said Smith's dedication and attitude rank with him with the best 
athletes he has trained. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Smith sees a chiropractor every other week for a checkup and minor 
adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
"My body's my instrument I play," said Smith, who in addition to being one of 
the best conditioned athletes on the tour is also one of the biggest at 
6-feet-1, 180 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I want every advantage I can get," he said. "Later in life, I don't want to 
have to ask myself what if I didn't do this or that. I don't want to have any 
regrets." 
</P>
<P>
Surfing Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Life's A Beach contest at the Oceanside Pier is new on the ASP world tour 
but is already the eighth largest in terms of prize money ($112,500). Although 
there is no affiliation, the contest has replaced the old Stubbies Pro, which 
was a regular stop on the tour from 1984-88. . . . San Diego area surfers 
advancing to today's second round of the main event included Oceanside's Mike 
Lambresi in the men's division, Encinitas' Tricia Gill and San Diego's Lisa 
Carulli in the women's division and Joel Tudor of Pacific Beach in 
longboarding. Encinitas' Brad Gerlach, seeded 11th in the men's division, 
begins surfing today against Mike Parsons of Laguna Beach. . . . Competition 
begins today and Saturday at 7 a.m. Sunday's final rounds begin at 8 a.m. . . . 
A shuttle bus, to help ease congestion and parking problems Saturday and 
Sunday, will pick up passengers at city-owned parking lots along Pacific, Sixth 
and Cleveland streets, north and east of the pier.

MISTRIAL DECLARED IN MULHEREN TRIAL; CONVICTION STANDS 
</P>

<P>
A federal judge Thursday declared a mistrial on the remaining 26 securities 
fraud counts against stock speculator John A. Mulheren Jr., who is accused of 
breaking laws to benefit Ivan F. Boesky in exchange for inside tips. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday Mulheren was convicted of four charges that he manipulated the price 
of Gulf &amp; Western stock for Boesky's benefit. That conviction will stand. 
Gulf &amp; Western is now Paramount Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, the jury indicated it was deadlocked on the remaining 26 counts 
of the indictment and was ordered by U.S. District Judge Miriam Cedarbaum to 
continue deliberations. She declared the mistrial Thursday when jurors still 
could not reach a decision. 
</P>
<P>
"We're gratified most of the government's case was not proved," said Thomas 
Puccio, Mulheren's lawyer. He said his client would appeal the conviction on 
the four counts. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there is a basis in law for the verdict. I think that verdict 
was not supported by the evidence," Puccio said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Mulheren faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and $1 million 
in fines, he was obviously relieved by the mistrial on the remaining counts. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's office said the prosecutors had no 
comment on whether they would retry the case based on the 26 counts. 
</P>
<P>
The jury began deliberating June 29 after a seven-week trial. 
</P>
<P>
Mulheren, who was wearing jeans and an orange and blue athletic jacket, went up 
to the prosecution table after the mistrial was declared and began joking with 
the government lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Asked for his reaction, Mulheren said, "I have no reaction. Nothing happened. I 
was amazed by counts one through four. It seemed pretty wild to me." 
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Mulheren, 40, is formerly head of the now-defunct investment firm of Jamie 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
The case against Mulheren stemmed from several schemes in which he allegedly 
helped one-time Wall Street powerhouse Boesky cheat on his income taxes, 
manipulate stock prices and avoid rules on how much money he needed to have on 
hand to cover losses.

Federal securities regulators voted Thursday to consider creating "the 
corporate equivalent of a smoke detector" to head off potential financial 
troubles at big brokerage firms such as the one that sank Drexel Burnham 
Lambert Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The Securities and Exchange Commission agreed to seek public comment on 
proposed changes in the net capital rule, which requires broker-dealers to 
maintain minimum amounts of cash and assets easily converted into cash to 
offset the risk of the securities they trade. 
</P>
<P>
But last February's sudden collapse of the parent company of junk bond giant 
Drexel Burnham has raised concerns that regulators are not getting enough 
advance notice when the parent companies of Wall Street firms withdraw large 
amounts from capital reserves. 
</P>
<P>
While financially sound itself, the Drexel brokerage business was a victim of 
money woes at its parent Drexel Burnham Lambert Group. DBL Group filed for 
bankruptcy court protection after defaulting on $100 million in short-term 
debt. The SEC and the New York Stock Exchange refused to allow it to draw down 
cash from the brokerage to repay its debt.

'JEFF AND JER' BOOST MORNING RATINGS FOR B100 RADIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN BRASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two months after making a well-publicized jump from KKYY-FM (Y95)to KFMB-FM 
(B100), morning pranksters Jerry St. James and Jeff Elliott have established 
themselves as the morning team to beat, according to the Arbitron ratings 
released Wednesday for the spring quarter. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to a dramatic increase in B100's morning ratings share, the new 
ratings book shows the contemporary hits format of KKLQ (Q106) in first place 
overall, the position it has held for the past three years, with a 9.4 rating 
share among listeners 12 and over, down from a 10.3 share in the winter book. 
</P>
<P>
KSON, simulcast on AM (1240) and FM (97.3), again posted big numbers with its 
country format. After a respectable 6.7 share in the winter book, KSON moved up 
to a 7.5 share among listeners 12 and over in the spring, placing it second 
overall. The rock 'n' roll of KGB was third in the 12-plus category with a 7.1 
rating share, up from a 6.1 in the winter. 
</P>
<P>
Big jumps also were recorded by KCBQ-FM (105.3), which moved from a 2.6 to a 
3.6 with its oldies rock, and XHTZ (Z90), which switched from rock 'n' roll to 
a contemporary urban format in the spring and jumped from a .8 to a 1.9 share. 
</P>
<P>
A ratings share represents the percentage of the listening audience that tuned 
to the station for at least five minutes in an average quarter hour. Although 
they illustrate the overall size of a station's listening audience, the 12 and 
over numbers are generally discounted by radio station executives, who market 
their stations to specific demographic groups. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, KGB was number one in the 18-34 category, followed by Q106 and XTRA-FM 
(91X), while KSON won among listeners 25-54, followed by KGB, Q106 and the 
"Lites Out" jazz of KIFM (98.1). 
</P>
<P>
"There was more listenership in this book," although KIFM's ratings dropped 
slightly, said KIFM General Manager Bruce Walton. "We're doing a good job of 
keeping our listeners around, especially in the spring when (the start of 
Padres) baseball affects our men listeners." 
</P>
<P>
In the case of "Jeff and Jer," B100 scored big in the 25-54 age group, its key 
demographic target audience. In the last ratings book, for the winter quarter, 
B100 was ranked fifth in the morning among listeners 25-54 with a 6.0, while 
Y95 with "Jeff and Jer" was sixth with a 5.6 share. 
</P>
<P>
"Jeff and Jer" started work at B100 five weeks into the 12-week ratings period. 
But there is no doubt they made a substantial impact, posting an 8.3 share 
among listeners 25-54 years old. That was enough to move B100 into first place 
in the morning in the key 25-54 group, ahead of KSON's Jack Diamond and Lisa 
Bent with an 8.0 and the 7.1 rating posted by KFMB-AM's (760) Mac Hudson and 
Joe Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
B100 had been a perennial power in the morning since 1984, when the "B-Morning 
Zoo" starring the "Rich Brothers" debuted. In April, though, the station dumped 
the zoo concept and hired "Jeff and Jer." 
</P>
<P>
The station promoted the new show heavily, including throwing a large party and 
running television commercials featuring the duo with paper bags over their 
heads, a tactic that arose when Y95 refused to allow B100 to use the names of 
the pair until their Y95 contract expired. 
</P>
<P>
To a certain degree, the numbers can be attributed to increased listener 
sampling in the wake of numerous recent changes in morning programs. 
</P>
<P>
"That might have made the (ratings) jump a little quicker," KFMB General 
Manager Paul Palmer said. "We're dealing with people who were listening to the 
Zoo, who we were trying to keep, and a number of people who came over from 
other stations." 
</P>
<P>
Overall, B100 showed only a slight increase in the 12 and over category, moving 
from a 4.5 to a 4.8. KFMB-AM (760), buoyed by the San Diego Padres broadcasts, 
went from a 4.6 ratings share to a 6.7. 
</P>
<P>
In other significant ratings changes, the mellow music of KYXY-FM (96.5) 
dropped from a 5.0 to a 3.7 among listeners 12 and over, but the equally mellow 
format of KJQY-FM (Sunny 103) didn't pick up the slack. Once a ratings power, 
when it was known as "KJOY," Sunny 103 and its slightly more upbeat format, 
slipped from a 5.3 to a 4.4. 
</P>
<P>
The new rock of XTRA-FM (91X) posted a slight gain in the 12 and over category, 
going from a 4.3 to a 4.8 share, and KSDO-AM (1130) went from a 6.0 to a 5.7.

Extra! Extra! Reporters Stage Art Theft!: Two journalists for a daily French 
newspaper stole a drawing by Jean Auguste Ingres from a museum in southern 
France in broad daylight to test security a week after three thefts from 
museums in Paris, the reporters' newspaper says. The Midi Libre, a regional 
daily in Montpellier, said Wednesday that reporter Odile Cimitiere and 
photographer Pierre Carriere removed the small tableau from a wall in the Fabre 
Museum with a screwdriver, then hid the sketch in a plastic bag under one's 
clothing and spirited it out the museum's entrance unchallenged Tuesday 
morning. They returned it to museum authorities later. GREG BRAXTON

Dice Film May Stink but Box Office Is Rosy: Activists Against Sexist Pigs, a 
group that condemns Andrew Dice Clay as sexist and homophobic, said that it 
left a stink bomb in a Westwood theater as its opening night "review" of Clay's 
new film, "The Adventures of Ford Fairlane." A spokesperson for the group said 
that a foul-smelling device was left in the Westwood Odeon Cinema during the 
10:15 showing. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses reported that a smell of rotten eggs and human waste hung around the 
theater well after midnight. But police and executives for the film's 
producers, 20th Century Fox, said that they could not confirm the claim. Fox 
executives, however, were doing anything but holding their noses at the film's 
opening-day figures. They said that "Ford Fairlane" brought in more than $2 
million Wednesday on 1,201 screens nationwide, for a per-screen average of 
$1,708. "It's Christmas again," declared Tom Sherak, president of marketing and 
distribution for Fox. "It was an exceptional opening and exceeded our wildest 
expections." GREG BRAXTON

L.A. MODERN DANCERS TO DEBUT IN S.D. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Variety is the byword of Los Angeles-based Pacific Dance Ensemble, one of the 
few repertory companies in modern dance today. 
</P>
<P>
The thematic range of the four dances the troupe is packaging for its San Diego 
debut this weekend runs from the boy-meets-girl romanticism of "Full Circle" to 
the primordial ritualism of "Crow" to the hybrid style of "A Wrinkle in Space." 
</P>
<P>
The company even delves into the recesses of the human mind (albeit with a 
comic perspective) in "The Curse of ESP," the closing work on the mixed bag 
scheduled for 8:30 p.m. Saturday and Sunday at Three's Company's Hillcrest 
studio. 
</P>
<P>
"Diversity has been sort of the color of the company since we started two years 
ago," said artistic director Danielle Shapiro, by phone from her Los Angeles 
studio. "We have 11 works in our repertory, and they're generally by younger 
choreographers. I'm trying to support artists by commissioning works." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most modern dance company directors, Shapiro has no designs on creating 
her own dances. She prefers to leave the dance-making to kindred spirits. 
</P>
<P>
"I find people I really like, and then I commission new works from them. I try 
to balance each program with dark and light pieces, but, when I premiere, 
sometimes it's hard to know what I'm going to get. What we're really trying to 
do is reach out to a broader audience than just dance (buffs). We like to work 
with musicians and sculptors." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Three's Company's space is too bare-bones for such elaborate 
productions. As a result, local aficionados will have to settle for the 
obligatory canned music and no-frills decor that has become the mainstay of 
Lo-Tec concerts for years. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, nothing about this weekend's concert would look familiar -- not the 
dancers, not the choreography. 
</P>
<P>
A "ballet-poem," conceived and directed by Dusan Bogdanovic and Gilberte 
Meunier, was the impetus for the mythological-based "Crow." This abstract 
dance, which attempts to evoke "the animal, human, and god-like facets of the 
crow," will feature the full 10-member troupe, and an original score by 
Bogdanovic. 
</P>
<P>
In Young-Ae Park's "A Wrinkle in Space," mundane movement, modern dance and 
ballet all take on a surreal quality, while Lisbeth Davidow's "Full Circle" 
follows a man and woman through the cycles of a relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"The Curse of ESP" is a collaborative effort with choreography and text by Karl 
Schaffer and Erik Stern. 
</P>
<P>
"Modern dance repertory companies are not the in-thing now," said lo-tec 
organizer Jean Isaacs, artistic director of Three's Company. "Most modern dance 
companies are the vision of their artistic directors. 
</P>
<P>
"But this troupe gives us a chance to see a lot of modern dance. That's why I 
started these lo-tecs in the first place -- so I could get to see modern dance 
that would never be performed here otherwise."

MUSIC: BANDS USED TO AIM FOR THE HIP STREETS OF HOLLYWOOD, BUT MANY LOOK 
ELSEWHERE NOW.

The hard rock quartet Mystic Rose wasn't getting anywhere in the music business 
as long as it stayed in Wyoming. That much its members were certain of, even if 
they already seemed like rock stars at home, where they could have continued 
indefinitely with small-time gigs at clubs, bars and high schools across the 
Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
To fulfill its show biz dreams, Mystic Rose had to come to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
It's a common scenario. Every week, uncountable numbers of singers, guitarists 
and other would-be rock stars pour into Southern California via bus, plane or 
something more like the two-car convoy that carried Mystic Rose for its own 
1,300-mile trip. Their eyes and egos are most often aimed at the hip streets of 
Hollywood. But for a variety of reasons, many of these musicians choose to live 
and, increasingly, perform in the once-stigmatized San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, Mystic Rose opted for an anonymous corner of the Valley over some 
of the lower-rent neighborhoods of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"We kind of wanted to stay away from Hollywood," said Ken (Trick) Kilpatrick, 
20, relaxing in the Van Nuys apartment he shares with band mate Dan Dombovey. 
"We thought it would be a lot safer to have our equipment out here." 
</P>
<P>
The unfurnished, second-floor apartment the two share is laid out like a 
free-form campground, with scattered pillows, sleeping bags, laundry and small 
stacks of music magazines. On the kitchen counter stand a dozen empty beer 
bottles, while assorted musical instruments and stage gear are stacked against 
undecorated walls. The apartment had been a haven from Hollywood, where the 
band has performed a handful of times since arriving in February. Yet even this 
part of town offered some distinctly urban surprises for any young son of 
Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell my mom some of the things that are happening just out in the parking 
lot, and it freaks her out a little bit," said Dombovey, 19. "You hear a couple 
of gunshots every now and then. And it's kind of crazy to see these little 
hookers everywhere. There ain't none where we live." 
</P>
<P>
Cash-poor bands from out of state have always huddled in the cheaper areas of 
Culver City, Venice and Hollywood. In spite of the long-standing music studio 
industry in the Valley, the suburban areas north of the Hollywood Hills were 
long considered the most unhip section of Los Angeles in the minds of 
street-level musicians looking to Hollywood-bred acts like Guns 'N Roses and 
Poison as role models. This attitude has had its price. 
</P>
<P>
Susette Andres left New York for the West Coast five years ago to pursue 
careers in drumming and modeling. Before later escaping to North Hollywood, 
Andres said, she lived in the heart of Hollywood with a male roommate who 
turned out to be a drug dealer, ultimately stealing much of her equipment and 
maliciously allowing the utilities to be shut off. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the musicians I know live here in the Valley," said Mica Sekino, 23, 
manager of an East Coast band called Bad Influence. "It's cleaner, it's nicer, 
and it's cheaper for the most part. And it's not that far. If you have a gig, 
it's 10 minutes over the hill. Big deal." 
</P>
<P>
When members of the Poison Dollys arrived from Long Island two years ago, 
bassist Mef Manning chose a condominium in West Hollywood, near the fast crowds 
of Melrose Avenue. She now lives in Sherman Oaks. "The Valley was just more 
affordable," said Manning, 25. "All our studios are out here, and all the 
musicians we work with are out here." 
</P>
<P>
A change in attitude about the Valley is in part the result of suddenly 
increased, and seemingly coincidental, hard rock activity at Valley clubs like 
FM Station, the Sasch and the Palomino in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
The expanded popularity of these clubs owes much to the long-controversial 
"pay-to-play" requirements that continue on the Sunset Strip. The overwhelming 
crush of bands competing for high-exposure gigs there has grown so fierce that 
most groups are not paid directly for their performances. Instead, independent 
promoters at the Whiskey a Go Go, Gazzarri's and the Roxy have musicians 
purchase several hundred dollars in tickets to sell on their own. The up-front 
cost to a band playing Sunset can exceed $1,000, a major cash outlay that is 
well beyond the means of many struggling bands. 
</P>
<P>
The Country Club in Reseda is another venue often requiring ticket pre-sales. 
Most Valley clubs pay the bands that perform, with the amount depending on 
their billing or draw. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until recent months that groups fighting for position on Sunset would 
even consider performing at a club in North Hollywood or Studio City, said 
Andres, now the booking secretary at FM Station. "It wasn't the in thing; it 
wasn't as cool as Hollywood," she said. "People would rather sell tickets and 
be in a cool place" than play in the Valley. "But now it's totally changed." 
</P>
<P>
Andres, who is also the drummer for the Wyld Hearts, said that as pay-to-play 
requirements have become more unbearable, Valley venues that pay musicians are 
looking more attractive to West Hollywood's headlining bands. The Wyld Hearts' 
last show on the Strip cost the band $400 up front. Its members recouped the 
investment in ticket sales, but Andres said the group has no more plans of 
contributing to the pay-to-play system. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first came out here, I paid to play a lot," Andres said. "I ended up 
breaking even by selling my tickets, but it's such a big hassle to ask your 
friends to buy a ticket for $8." 
</P>
<P>
At the Sasch, management has aggressively promoted the club as a first-class 
venue for rock 'n' roll. In April, the club dropped its format of mostly pop, 
Top 40 and R &amp; B acts in favor of the hard rock popular on the Strip. 
Although some headlining groups were slow at first to play the Sasch, the 
Studio City club's plush atmosphere, sound system and paychecks ultimately won 
them over. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of the scene is still in L. A.," Sekino said. "But they make it 
so difficult there to have a good time. It's expensive in Hollywood, there's a 
lot of police and they don't let you loiter on the streets and hand out flyers 
any more. And you can't park unless you have a permit. 
</P>
<P>
"You come out to the Valley and you don't have to deal with all that." 
</P>
<P>
Most agree, however, that the Valley music scene is still not a major threat to 
the Strip, which will always retain the legacy of launching the careers of 
major rock acts like the Doors and, more recently, Guns 'N Roses. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a disappointment in a way, not that the Valley places are a bad way 
to go," said Jason Lord of Jungle Showcases, an independent promoter of shows 
at various clubs. "It's just a disappointment that happens when you're not 
playing the Roxy or the Whiskey or Gazzarri's. If you've played those, you've 
been somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Valley's still got a little bit of that stigma left," Sekino 
added. "The ambience of Hollywood is still not there in the Valley. I don't 
think it's had enough time to really develop a glamour that the Hollywood scene 
has. I can see a trend moving toward that, though, because of places like the 
Sasch, the Palomino and especially FM Station." 
</P>
<P>
The Sasch has already won over a large regular audience, while occasionally 
attracting visits from such major rock stars as Jon Bon Jovi and Billy Idol. 
</P>
<P>
"But I can't see it getting to the point of hurting the Whiskey," said Mark 
Yandle, manager of the Sasch. "There are so many groups and not many good 
clubs. So I see a lot of bands coming over here, but the following month, 
they'll be back at the Roxy and then back here again." 
</P>
<P>
Even in regard to the Valley versus Hollywood, where a band plays and lives 
isn't always by choice. The members of Mystic Rose supported themselves on a 
combination of odd jobs and careful savings back home in Sheridan, Wyo. Not all 
groups arriving in Los Angeles for the first time are so well prepared. 
</P>
<P>
"I've known bands that have actually come here and lived out of a van, with all 
their gear," Lord said. "Four or five guys are all cramped in a Dodge van or 
something ridiculous, and they actually live and eat and sleep out of it." 
</P>
<P>
As for the glamour of rock 'n' roller stardom on the streets of Los Angeles, 
Andres said it could just as easily be discovered at clubs like FM Station, the 
Palomino and the Sasch, where her Wyld Hearts will be performing July 26. 
</P>
<P>
"The glamour comes from your audience," Andres said. "The club is just a club, 
four walls and a stage. The glamour is the band and its audience."

YOUTH DRAMA WORKSHOP IS IN JEOPARDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The continuation of the Teen-Age Drama Workshop, now in its 34th summer season 
at Cal State Northridge, has been placed in question by the new year-round 
school policy. 
</P>
<P>
The workshop -- which counts among its alumni performance artist Bill Irwin, 
Tony Award-winning actor Michael Rupert and actress Mare Winningham -- is an 
intensive eight-week program that gives students the chance to work on several 
productions. 
</P>
<P>
But next year, with traditional summer vacation greatly shortened for many 
teen-agers at San Fernando Valley schools, the program may come to an end. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been talk about quitting, but the major emphasis has been on trying 
to fit in with the new schedule," said William Schlosser, who originated the 
program in 1956 and although retired still acts an adviser to the 160-student 
workshop. 
</P>
<P>
"We may have to cut back the number of students we now take," he said. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN officials said no decision has been made on the fate of the workshop.

CLUB BANDS DO BATTLE IN NORTH HOLLYWOOD; 
</P>
<P>
CONTEST: AS MANY AS 400 ENTRIES, INCLUDING SOME TOP SUNSET STRIP BANDS, ARE 
EXPECTED TO ENTER A NIGHTCLUB'S COMPETITION TO BENEFIT TEEN-AGE RUNAWAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Local rockers will soon face a panel of music industry types, pop celebrities 
and other characters in an effort to leap from club-level obscurity at FM 
Station's "Pure Rock Search '90." 
</P>
<P>
Expected judges of the nine-week battle of the bands, which will benefit 
Children of the Night, include comic Sam Kinison and members of the 
chart-topping hard rock bands Poison and Warrant. 
</P>
<P>
The contest, which begins Tuesday and continues Tuesday nights through Sept. 
11, has found a surprising degree of support from virtually every level of the 
music industry, said Susette Andres, booking secretary at the North Hollywood 
nightclub. Members of popular rock acts were quick to sign on as judges. And 
several donations have been received for the contest's grand prize of drums, a 
Gibson electric guitar, amplifiers and other stage gear. 
</P>
<P>
Both new and journeyman bands are invited to enter by submitting a tape of any 
listenable quality, whether recorded live in a garage or in a pristine 
professional multitrack studio. As many as 400 entries are expected by the 
final deadline of July 29, Andres said. And all finalists will appear on a live 
cassette recorded on the contest's last night. 
</P>
<P>
Andres said early entries included some of the top Sunset Strip bands. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised they'd even enter. Usually they have the attitude that they're 
already going to get signed. It's cool," he said. 
</P>
<P>
All proceeds from the $5 admission and sales of the live cassette will go to 
Children of the Night, a rescuer of teen-age runaways. Contest co-sponsor 
KNAC-FM, the Long Beach-based hard rock station, is a longtime supporter and 
holds an annual concert and auction that this year raised about $75,000 for the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just thrilled with having the support of the people who know what the 
kids are going through," said Lois Lee, founder of Children of the Night. "I 
think the musicians often get a bad rap of exploiting these kids. And this 
gives them an opportunity to help these kids that they can't reach in any other 
way." 
</P>
<P>
The mission of Children of the Night, Lee said, is to find runaway youngsters 
in Los Angeles who during their search for stardom end up on the street, 
addicted to drugs or supporting themselves through prostitution. But through 
shelter and counseling, many runaways are eventually guided back home or to 
independence with jobs and apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Money generated from "Pure Rock Search '90" will help pay for the charity's 
annual $62,000 food budget and the renovation of its shelter building in Van 
Nuys, which is expected to open by December. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of these teens are KNAC listeners, and a lot of them hang out on the 
Strip," said Pam Edwards, KNAC's program director. "We just thought we could 
relate to them and get the message out that there is a place where they can go 
and get off the street." 
</P>
<P>
The music industry has long rallied around the organization, now the subject of 
pop-rock singer Richard Marx's Top 20 single, "Children of the Night." Tom 
Maher, promotion director for KNAC, said he is hoping to raise as much as 
$15,000 for the charity through the contest and cassette. He added that the 
total could go much higher through unexpected large donations. He said such 
donations often result from the music scene's more charitable impulses. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really interesting the way people respond," Maher said. "We're just 
trying to have fun, give something to charity and get some attention to these 
bands." 
</P>
<P>
At FM Station, Andres said one motive for the contest was to simply expose some 
of the acts that have played at the North Hollywood club, which in recent 
months has become a busy center of activity on the local rock scene. "We have a 
lot of good bands that play here," she said. "And we wanted to put it all 
together on one big album." 
</P>
<P>
Each week's contest will have its own panel of record industry people and 
celebrities, judging the best among five competitors. Andres said audience 
reaction will count as one vote. 
</P>
<P>
Master of ceremonies will be KNAC radio personality Craig Williams, who hosts 
the station's "Pure Rock Local Show," which spotlights unsigned local groups. 
Those who appear on the contest's cassette will likely be played on that 
program. And the grand-prize winner might be added to the station's regular 
music rotation, Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
"To the bands it means exposure," she said. "And there is a certain amount of 
prestige in winning. It gives their fans a chance to come out and root for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
For other competitors, she added, the contest will give emerging acts a rare 
opportunity to perform. "For some of these bands, it will be one of their first 
gigs. I think the Strip bands will have an edge because of their fans and name 
recognition. But if a new group is a good solid band with good stage presence, 
they should do well, absolutely." 
</P>
<P>
The "Pure Rock Search '90" cassette, scheduled for release in late September, 
will be distributed through Tempo Records stores, a co-sponsor that is 
accepting contest entries. Also accepting entries is another sponsor, the ABK 
Rocks music store in Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pure Rock Search '90" at FM Station, 11702 Victory Blvd., North Hollywood, 
begins at 8:30 p.m. Tuesday and continues every Tuesday through Sept. 11. 
Admission: $5. Event benefits Children of the Night. Further information: (818) 
769-2220.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WARNING LIGHT CAUSES FORCED LANDING AT LAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A United Airlines DC-10 bound for Washington with 268 passengers aboard was 
forced to return to Los Angeles International Airport Thursday when a fire 
warning light activated shortly after takeoff. The plane, operating on two of 
its three engines, landed safely after dumping fuel and no injuries were 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Morrison, assistant air traffic manager, said the landing was "fairly 
normal" once the pilot noticed the light, which warns of an engine fire. The 
pilot shut off the engine and made a few passes over the ocean to dump fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Inspectors examined the aircraft, and determined that there was no fire and 
that the light was triggered by a malfunction, a United official said. No 
emergency evacuation procedures were necessary during the landing of United 
flight 54, officials said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POLICE AGAIN SHOT AT IN WILMINGTON PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second time this week, Los Angeles police have been shot at in a 
Wilmington housing project in apparent retaliation for the recent death of a 
gang member who was fleeing from police. 
</P>
<P>
Although no one was injured in the shooting at 2:30 a.m. Thursday, the incident 
prompted Los Angeles police officials to temporarily assign additional officers 
to the Harbor area, where gang violence has been escalating for months. 
</P>
<P>
The first of those two dozen officers arrived Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
The latest shooting at Dana Strand Village, and one Sunday morning that grazed 
an officer, follow the death last weekend of John Santos of Wilmington. Gang 
members have blamed the death of the 21-year-old gang member on police, 
although an autopsy Wednesday showed he choked to death on a tiny plastic bag, 
believed by police to contain drugs.

<P>
The number of ethnic minorities enrolling in the state university system has 
risen dramatically in recent years and there has been a steady increase in the 
hiring of women and minorities as faculty members, CSU studies released 
Wednesday in Long Beach showed. Between 1984 and 1989, freshmen enrollment 
increased at CSU campuses by 22.6%, while the increases in enrollments of 
under-represented minority groups ranged from 21% to 73%, according to one of 
two reports presented to the CSU Board of Trustees.

<P>
A Reseda day-care center where police found an eight-foot-high marijuana plant 
and a loaded gun within the reach of children was ordered closed and its 
operator's license was suspended Thursday by state officials. 
</P>
<P>
Kim McIntyre, 28, who operated the day-care center in her home in the 19500 
block of Vanowen Street, was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of cultivating 
marijuana, a felony. She was released from the Van Nuys jail after posting 
$5,000 bail. Los Angeles police said they intend to seek a charge of child 
endangerment against her in addition to the drug charge. 
</P>
<P>
McIntyre told police she was growing the marijuana to help cut down on her 
live-in boyfriend's expenses for the drug.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEW SUBSIDIES APPROVED FOR SOME DWP 
CUSTOMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power commissioners on Thursday 
approved new subsidies for low-income residents, which could trim about 15% off 
the average water and power bill for low-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
Water bills for disadvantaged families could be cut by $1.98 a month and 
electricity bills by $3.35 a month under the plan, which must be approved by 
the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Others would see an increase of less than 1% in their bills to make up the 
difference, DWP officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said more than 340,000 households could be eligible for the 
subsidies. Almost 100,000 other customers, elderly or disabled, already receive 
"lifeline" subsidies that are even larger. Combined, the eligible households 
amount to more than one-third of the 1.16-million residential DWP customers.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TORRES SCRAPS PLANS FOR COLISEUM 
LEGISLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) announced Thursday that he is dropping 
his bill that would have required state approval for any renovation of the Los 
Angeles Memorial Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Torres said he made the decision after reaching agreement with Mayor Tom 
Bradley, preservationist group leaders and representatives of the Coliseum's 
private management firm on a plan to protect the stadium's historic qualities. 
</P>
<P>
Standing in front of the peristyle end of the 67-year-old facility, Bradley 
said a four-day design workshop will be held in November to get input from all 
interested parties -- including nearby residents and merchants, elected 
officials, design professionals and governmental agencies -- on ways to upgrade 
the stadium while preserving its historic characteristics.

THE '60S: HAIR WE GO AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
FASHION: THE NEWEST SHAPES ARE UPDATED AND EASIER VERSIONS OF STYLES FROM THE 
DECADE OF FLOWER POWER, GEOMETRIC CHIC AND TEASING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

magazine.

<TEXT>
<P>
This summer's newest hairstyles come straight from the history books -- 1960s 
history, that is. Back-combed "bubbles," wash-and-wear geometrics, and 
hippie-like, long, straight styles are being reshaped. 
</P>
<P>
At Cristophe and Vidal Sassoon, two top Beverly Hills salons, recent shows 
featured versions of looks first seen on the pages of Vogue and Harper's Bazaar 
more than 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In Cristophe's show, 20-year-old Samantha Klink modeled a blond flip like 
socialite-actress Dina Merrill wore in the 1960s. Klink's version had long 
bangs that almost obscured her heavily made-up eyes. "I look exactly like my 
mother did in high school," the model cooed. "She was so cool." 
</P>
<P>
This particular nostalgia kick has been building for some time. For Guess? 
jeans ads, model Claudia Schiffer started wearing a '60s Bridget Bardot 
hairstyle more than a year ago. Her messy blond bangs and wispy French twist 
had an obvious impact. But it was the tousled, piled-up topknot that Ivana 
Trump wore on the May cover of Vogue that brought the Bardot look mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
Demi Moore's newest hairstyle for the movie "Ghost" is a short, wispy bubble 
reminiscent of the boy cut worn by '60s model Twiggy. Jodie Foster went '60s 
when she wore a sleek, one-length style -- a clone of Barbra Streisand's 
post-"Funny Girl" look -- to the Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
The resurgence of interest in '60s fashion has fueled the hair revival. A 
number of vintage items, including hip-hugger pants, Pucci prints, and 
Courreges and Rudi Gernreich dresses -- all copied by fashion designers today 
-- still look best with the hairstyles that were created for them. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's more than just the fashion," explains Cristophe, owner of the Beverly 
Drive salon. "Look at politics, the current peace movement, the environmental 
concern. And everyone is fascinated with the music again. The entire decade is 
back." 
</P>
<P>
Aitch Peters, senior creative director at the Sassoon salon in Beverly Hills, 
says that after his recent style show, "dozens of women have come in, talking 
about '60s hairdos and asking for a '90s version of the look." To Peters, the 
new styles are derivatives of the original wash-and-wears Sassoon popularized 
in the mid-'60s, but they are "softer, less hard-edged. There's also more 
versatility to the cut. Today women want to be able to wear their hair more 
than one way." 
</P>
<P>
Long hair allows for the most versatility. At the Cristophe show, blunt-cut 
shoulder-length hair was swept up into French twists and top-knots, slicked off 
the face into tight chignons worn at the crown, or worn long and straight, 
reminiscent of singer-actress Cher when she was still wearing bell-bottoms and 
singing with her then husband, Sonny Bono. The hair was bone straight. 
</P>
<P>
Says Cristophe, "Right now perms are out, unless they are very soft and only 
slightly wavy. No more curls." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the styles shown by Sassoon were short, above-the-chin length cuts. In 
their original versions, typical geometric cuts from Sassoon looked one way all 
the time and demanded constant trims to maintain a sharp, well-defined 
perimeter. "That kind of precision look is not part of this new take on the 
'60s," says Peters. 
</P>
<P>
Neither is heavy back-combing, or "teasing" as it was called then. Eric 
Lintermans, owner of Lintermans La Coupe in Beverly Hills, predicts that women 
won't tease their hair to achieve the definitive high crown of the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he says, "The fullness is achieved with a cut." Lintermans adds, 
"Women have grown accustomed to hair that can be touched. They won't give that 
up. In the '60s men were afraid to touch a woman's hair for fear of ruining an 
expensive hairdo. That won't work anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Another hallmark of the '60s that doesn't work now is the roller, which helped 
to shape bubbles and beehives of the early part of that decade. Today rollers 
have been replaced by blow-dryers, round hairbrushes and high-tech hair 
mousses, gels and sprays. These products make it possible to style an updated 
bubble shape like the one Kenneth, New York's king of hair creations in the 
'60s, designed (without rollers) in 1961 for First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, those who want the ultra-straight looks of the later '60s won't have 
to resort to pressing their long hair on ironing boards. Wide, flat brushes and 
gels and sprays that straighten as well as mold hair into shape, produce the 
look now. 
</P>
<P>
With the return of '60s hairdos comes a resurgence in interest in hairpieces. 
Falls and postiches (shorter than a fall and used to add fullness) positioned 
high on the crown give the extra height that defined many of the most popular 
teased styles 25 years ago. They are worn with wide headbands, reminiscent of 
those Elizabeth Taylor wore when she was being courted by Richard Burton. At 
the Cristophe show one model wore a short postiche topped with another that was 
shaped into a wide bow of hair that hinted of the past, yet looked thoroughly 
modern. 
</P>
<P>
If the current homage to '60s hair doesn't quite work, it is because stylists 
are attempting to compress all the hairdos of the decade into the trend. In 
their day, these styles represented several mini fashion revolutions, and the 
time span between each new look was in keeping with the changes in fashion and, 
more importantly, society. 
</P>
<P>
A bubble was right for the Camelot days of the early '60s, Sassoon's geometrics 
were in keeping with the mod mood of '64, and long, shapeless looks were suited 
to the flower children of the latter part of the decade. But taken out of 
context, these styles become a humorous collage, destined to be a short-lived 
fad rather than a revolution. Like most retro looks, they may be a means of 
biding time until a truly new style emerges. As Lintermans, who has been 
styling hair since the early '60s points out, "I can't believe that women will 
be serious about these looks. It's fun for now."

A DEATH TRAP: BAD BLOOD COMES TO BOIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WICK, Steve Wick is a bureau chief with Newsday and spent three years 
researching Bad Company. A member of Newsday's 1984 Pulitzer Prize-winning 
reporting team, he lives on Long Island, N.Y., with his wife and three 
children. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The prospect of a partnership between Roy Radin and producer Bob Evans enraged 
the woman who introduced them. Laney Jacobs wanted in on the deal to produce 
"The Cotton Club," which she felt she had put together. She also accused Radin 
of having knowledge of a $1-million cocaine theft from her garage, where she 
stored the powder before distribution. Despite the bad blood between them, and 
warnings that she was dangerous, Radin agreed to meet with Laney, as author 
Steve Wick reports in this excerpt from "Bad Company: Drugs, Hollywood and the 
Cotton Club Murder." 
</P>
<P>
That Friday, May 13, 1983, as Bill Mentzer and his buddies were gathering, Roy 
Radin was confused and afraid. Every instinct he had honed for more than a 
decade and a half of business life, everything he had ever done that had 
brought him to this moment in time, now told him that he was in dangerous 
waters. 
</P>
<P>
He had awakened late, past 10, having slept poorly after finally falling asleep 
just a few hours before dawn. Radin had been abusing himself all week, living 
on daily doses of cocaine, and he was now paying for it. (His associate) John 
Lawson began to repeat everything he had said the day before, reiterating all 
the reasons why Radin was a fool to keep his appointment to meet Laney for 
dinner. But again Radin would have none of it. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he proposed a protection plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll ask Demond to come to the hotel early," Radin said (referring to his 
close friend Demond Wilson, former co-star of "Sanford and Son"). "He'll bring 
his gun. Just before Jacobs is supposed to arrive, Demond will go outside and 
sit in his car. He'll wait until he sees me come out with her, then he'll 
follow us to La Scala. At the restaurant, we'll happen to meet, and I'll leave 
with him." 
</P>
<P>
Well into the afternoon, Radin talked over his plan with Lawson. The more he 
talked about it, the more certain he became that it was foolproof. Lawson, for 
his part, thought the whole thing was absurd. Wilson was no bodyguard. Like 
Radin, he was a cokehead. 
</P>
<P>
By the middle of the day, Radin had gone through almost a gram of cocaine, and 
it looked as though he was going to lose his mind. Lawson told him he was out 
of control and begged him to stop. Radin shrugged and said he knew what he was 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
Demond Wilson's secretary, Amelia, arrived at 8 o'clock, just as "The New Odd 
Couple" (Wilson's latest show) was beginning. While the others watched the 
program, Radin made phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, he went into his bedroom to finish dressing. Wearing a dark 
three-piece suit and dark-colored Pierre Cardin tie, he sat on the edge of the 
bed, his head bowed, like a grieving man. Wilson came in and stood by him. He 
could see Radin's anxiety was eating him alive. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, there was no light left in the sky. The air was warm and still. 
Wilson's Mercedes was parked on Hollywood Boulevard a half-block west of the 
Regency. Amelia and Wilson got in the car and parked with a clear line of sight 
to where the driveway curved around and met the front of the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in the car, his gun in the door pocket, Wilson dipped a tiny spoon into 
a glass vial containing cocaine, held it tight to a nostril and sucked in the 
white powder. His head floated back to rest on the seat, and he sniffed a few 
more times to make sure he had gotten it all. He repeated the procedure with 
the other nostril. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps 40 minutes later, a black Cadillac turned into the hotel driveway and 
stopped at the front doors. A woman stepped out of the back seat. From where 
they sat, both Wilson and Amelia noticed her dress. It was long and 
tight-fitting, very shiny, the color of gold. They watched as the woman entered 
the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Inside Radin's apartment, the phone rang. It was the front desk, announcing 
Laney's arrival. Lawson nervously waited a minute before he opened the door. 
</P>
<P>
"Hello, Jonathan," Laney said. 
</P>
<P>
"Greetings and salutations," Lawson replied, an edge of sarcasm in his voice. 
</P>
<P>
She was all smiles, her face toned from her recent face lift. Lawson poured 
champagne into tall glasses, and Radin emerged from his bedroom. Despite the 
anxiety of the afternoon, he appeared fresh and ready to go out for the 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
He told her they had a table at La Scala. 
</P>
<P>
"Very nice," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Radin got up and went into his bedroom, where he put out a line of cocaine on 
his dresser and sucked it up his nose. In the living room, Lawson announced to 
Laney that he intended to drive both of them to the restaurant. But Laney 
protested, saying she had hired a limousine. 
</P>
<P>
When Radin came back into the room, she rather politely alluded to their fight 
about the "Cotton Club" project. She was not looking for another argument. 
Instead of repeating her demand that she be brought into the company, she now 
mentioned that all she expected to get was a finder's fee. 
</P>
<P>
This evidently pleased Radin, who assured her that if all went well, she would 
get just that. As for her demand that she be given a piece of the company, 
Radin told her she would have to work that out with Evans. 
</P>
<P>
Just before they were to leave for the restaurant, Laney asked Lawson if he 
would do her a favor: drive to her car, which was at the moment parked in the 
lot near her apartment in Beverly Hills. There were two grams of cocaine in the 
glove box, and she wanted him to bring them back to the Regency. That way, she 
and Radin would have the cocaine when they returned. 
</P>
<P>
Lawson turned to Radin and shook his head. "I'm not going," he told her, "I'm 
staying here until you're done with the meeting." 
</P>
<P>
"Roy, make him go," Laney insisted. 
</P>
<P>
Before Radin could reply, Lawson pulled him away from Laney. "Look," Lawson 
whispered, "there is no way I am leaving the suite until I hear from you after 
dinner. No way." 
</P>
<P>
Radin walked back to Laney. "Jonathan is staying," he said. 
</P>
<P>
She then turned and strode out the door, with Radin behind her. 
</P>
<P>
Seated in his Mercedes, Wilson told Amelia, "There's the big guy." 
</P>
<P>
As Radin and Laney emerged from the building, Bob Lowe (one of Laney's 
associates) dressed as a chauffeur, jumped out and opened the back door of the 
car. Laney got in first, then Radin, and the door was shut behind him. The 
limousine pulled away and proceeded onto Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, who less than an hour earlier had held a coke spoon to each nostril, 
now tried to get his car away from the curb and behind the limousine. But he 
was partially blocked in, and it took several attempts to position himself so 
that he could pull out. 
</P>
<P>
Standing just inside the lobby, Lawson looked for Wilson's car as the limousine 
turned onto Hollywood Boulevard. What he saw was a different car pull up 
directly behind the limousine. Amelia, waiting for Wilson to get going, saw 
this same car as it passed her and fell in line behind the limousine. Two men 
were sitting in it. 
</P>
<P>
The limousine immediately picked up speed as it left the hotel. It made a quick 
right-hand turn and headed toward Sunset Boulevard. Wilson finally caught up to 
within six or eight cars of the limousine as he saw it move onto Sunset 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
But the Friday-night traffic was heavy, and Wilson got bogged down. At the bend 
on Sunset, where the roadside is dominated by huge billboards, Wilson lost the 
limousine completely. Instead of looking further for it, he proceeded toward La 
Scala. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, Lowe pulled the limousine over to the side of the road. As 
he did, the car that had been following him stopped directly behind. Laney 
immediately jumped out, as did the two men in the following car. The men got 
into the back seat of the limousine -- one on either side of Radin -- and as 
the doors shut behind them, the limousine pulled away. Laney got in the other 
car, checked for traffic and drove toward Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Five miles away, Carl Plzak and Roger Korban (two more of Laney's associates), 
sat in the dark outside Laney's Beverly Hills apartment. They had been waiting 
in the pickup for about an hour, and both men were getting anxious. The man 
they had been told to look out for had not shown up. 
</P>
<P>
After 15 minutes had passed, Plzak picked up the walkie-talkie he had on the 
car seat and tried to reach Mentzer. There was no response, nothing but static, 
but he kept trying. Presently, a car drove up on the opposite side of the 
street from where the pickup was parked. It was 20 or 30 yards away, but Korban 
could make out the features of a blond woman wearing a bright, gold-colored 
dress. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going with her," Plzak said, and he stepped out of the truck. He had the 
walkie-talkie in his hand. "If you want, you could follow us, or you can just 
go home." 
</P>
<P>
Korban said he would go home. 
</P>
<P>
Plzak got in the car with Laney and shut the door. "Have you talked to Mentzer 
at all?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't been able to reach him," he answered. If Mentzer's walkie-talkie was 
turned on, he was out of range. 
</P>
<P>
At some point, as they drove around, Plzak asked where Alex and Bill were. 
</P>
<P>
"They grabbed the fat pig," Laney said. "They were taking him to the desert." 
</P>
<P>
"What about the other guy we were waiting for?" Plzak asked. 
</P>
<P>
"He wouldn't go get the cocaine," she said. "He was scared, for some reason." 
</P>
<P>
Sometime around 11 p.m., Laney drove to the Westwood Marquis and pulled into 
the parking lot. "Look," she said. "My alibi is that I was with my lawyer all 
night. I'm going to make some calls from his house." 
</P>
<P>
She got out of the car and Plzak slid over to the driver's side. "You haven't 
seen me all night," she added as she slammed the door shut. 
</P>
<P>
At about midnight, Anna Montenegro (Roy and Laney's mutual friend) called the 
Regency. "I got your message," she told Lawson. "What's wrong? Where's Roy?" 
</P>
<P>
"Anna, my God," Lawson moaned. "Where the hell is Jacobs?" 
</P>
<P>
"Where's Roy?" Anna asked again, disregarding Lawson's question. 
</P>
<P>
"He went with Laney to dinner and he hasn't come back and . . . " 
</P>
<P>
"I told him not to go! Why did he do it?" 
</P>
<P>
Lawson asked her to drive to the Regency. When he hung up, he sat on the sofa 
in the living room and covered his face with his hands, muttering to himself. 
He felt like a caged animal, having been in the apartment for nearly 24 hours. 
He reviewed the evening, step by step, in his mind. 
</P>
<P>
When Anna arrived, Lawson hugged her and nearly wept. She mentioned that she 
had been to Laney's Sherman Oaks house earlier in the day and had seen four or 
five men there. "I thought maybe it was Milan (Laney's cocaine supplier) 
sending these guys out to roust Laney about the rip-off," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Anna," Lawson pleaded, "I need help. Tell me everything, everything that might 
help Roy." 
</P>
<P>
Anna paced the small living room and again went over the terrain she had mapped 
out before -- that Laney was a front for Milan Bellechasses, that he bought 
directly from the Colombians who controlled cocaine in Miami and that both of 
them were capable of violent behavior to protect their interests. 
</P>
<P>
Lawson asked her about the movie deal and why it had meant so much to Laney to 
have Radin turn over a percentage of his share. 
</P>
<P>
The movie deal was a set up, Anna explained. She claimed it was a means for 
Bellechasses to launder his drug profits in Puerto Rico. Laney wanted the 
glamour and prestige and legitimacy of the movie business, and Bellechasses 
wanted a mechanism for investing and cleaning up his narcotics profits. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we knew it all, and we didn't," Lawson muttered. 
</P>
<P>
At 7 a.m. on Saturday morning, Dean Kahn went to work at the Hotel Bel-Air. One 
of the first things he noticed in the lot was that the black Cadillac limousine 
he had lent to Bill Mentzer had been returned. 
</P>
<P>
He walked over to examine it, opening the driver's side door. The trip odometer 
told him the car had been driven 78 miles since he had last seen it. Kahn was 
glad to see how clean the car was, particularly the inside, which appeared to 
have been carefully wiped out. 
</P>
<P>
Very early that morning, Plzak was summoned to Mentzer's apartment in the 
Valley. He found Mentzer and Bob Lowe waiting for him. The two men were excited 
and talkative. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened at the hotel?" Plzak asked as he poured himself a cup of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we were being followed," Mentzer said. "You know that guy who used to 
be in 'Sanford and Son'? He was sitting out in front of the Regency." 
</P>
<P>
Lowe explained that he had lost him. 
</P>
<P>
Mentzer said that when Laney jumped out of the limousine, he and Alex Marti 
(another bodyguard) pinned Radin in the back seat. Radin was scared, Mentzer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, a police car with the siren on roared up behind them, and 
the three men thought they had been caught. To keep Radin from shouting to the 
cop if they were pulled over, Mentzer shoved his pistol hard into Radin's 
mouth, splitting his lips, which bled profusely. The police car sped right 
past. 
</P>
<P>
They drove north on Interstate 5, to a section of remote canyon land where 
Mentzer and Marti had gone target shooting in the past. The car stopped near a 
box canyon, Radin was pulled out, marched a short distance off a gravel road, 
and shot 27 times in the head. 
</P>
<P>
"Marti went crazy," Mentzer said. 
</P>
<P>
Mentzer, who had consumed part of a bottle of wine to dull his senses, then 
administered a final shot to the head as sort of a coup de grace. Mentzer said 
that, as it turned out, Radin knew nothing about the rip-off. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing Mentzer talk about the murder, Lowe and Plzak left to take the 
limousine back to the Hotel Bel-Air. Lowe told Plzak he had personally cleaned 
out the car and wiped the blood from Radin's cut lips off the back seat. 
</P>
<P>
"That fat pig was screaming," Lowe said. "They shot him. . . . I couldn't watch 
it . . . and I walked back to the car." 
</P>
<P>
When Plzak and Lowe returned from dropping off the limousine, it was announced 
that they were all going to Miami with Laney. The plan was to continue the hunt 
for Rogers, who, it was believed, was somewhere in southern Florida. 
</P>
<P>
On board the plane, Mentzer and Lowe talked about when they were in Vietnam. 
And because they were the sort of men who liked to discuss their work, they 
again spoke about taking the fat producer out to the desert and shooting him. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed casually in a designer jogging outfit, Laney sat with them and 
listened. If she was hearing for the first time the awful truth that Radin had 
been executed after she had got out of the limousine, she did not react to the 
news. 
</P>
<P>
 (Editor's note: After Radin's killing, as author Wicks notes in "Bad Company," 
Demond Wilson found God, testifying in a Los Angeles court hearing that he is 
now a fundamentalist preacher.)

<TEXT>
<P>
It's not easy listening to the universe. For one thing, there's the problem of 
office space. 
</P>
<P>
Consider Kent Cullers, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
A big, paper-stuffed box labeled "Ice-Packed Sweet Corn" offers cardboard 
evidence of his latest office move at NASA's Ames Research Center here. Still 
stored away, too, is a special "camera" that allows Cullers to read on the tip 
of a finger -- one letter at a time -- projections of documents, equations and 
other data unavailable in Braille or via his talking computer. 
</P>
<P>
Cullers, a blind, 40-year-old radio astronomer, belongs to a small band of 
scientists who cling to an idea, even as they wander like bureaucratic nomads, 
pushed from one gray office to another at Ames by projects with more money, 
more people and more clout in the hierarchies of government. 
</P>
<P>
Existing tenaciously on the fringes of federal funding, these scientists want 
to look for intelligent life elsewhere in the galaxy, an exploration 
generically tagged the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, or SETI. 
</P>
<P>
As a group they are at the center of a web of hopes, dreams, unfettered 
speculation, calculated guesses, philosophy and hard science that has become a 
world of its own. 
</P>
<P>
"SETI is a community, especially around here," said Cullers the other day, 
sitting in the family heirloom rocker that holds pride of place -- just barely 
-- in his office. "There are enough of us to be a community. It's always been 
rather like a family enterprise. We're probably the biggest concentration of 
SETI scientists right here (at Ames)." 
</P>
<P>
Some 40 scientists work full-time or part-time on SETI at Ames. Another two 
dozen spend at least some of their time on the NASA project at the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Cullers' colleague Jill Tarter noted, "We've already had a couple of 
sociologists who have interviewed us and worked with us and studied us as a 
case history of a new science getting started." She paused before adding, "It's 
a little weird." 
</P>
<P>
But the network extends wider than just the scientists who are involved, Tarter 
said. "There is a SETI culture. We have people who are constantly writing for 
information. We give lots of public, general information talks and they're 
always jammed. And it's not just in California, it's all over the country." 
</P>
<P>
The basic idea for SETI has been around at least since the turn of the century: 
It may be possible to detect radio signals from another civilization. 
</P>
<P>
The argument is that radio signals are by far the easiest method of 
interstellar communication and, therefore, the most likely to be used by 
advanced alien civilizations, if they exist. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, limited, privately funded radio telescope searches for coded messages 
have been carried out in the past. All were unsuccessful or produced puzzling, 
indecipherable results. Other such private ventures are planned or being 
conducted, including one by the Pasadena-based Planetary Society. 
</P>
<P>
But Cullers and Tarter are part of what would the largest, widest-ranging 
search yet, a two-pronged NASA survey that would target about 800 individual 
stars within 80 light years or about 480 trillion miles of Earth, plus sweep 
portions of the galaxy for the coded signals many believe are out there. 
</P>
<P>
The "targeted" search would be conducted by the scientists at Ames while the 
"sky survey" is the work of scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes as planned -- a very big if at this point, listening would start on 
Columbus Day, 1992, the 500th anniversary of the discovery of America, and 
continue until the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, scientists at Ames and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory are 
building the sensitive signal-processing receivers and computers that will be 
hooked to large radio telescopes. 
</P>
<P>
The computers will scan microwave radio frequencies -- a relatively noise-free 
part of the radio spectrum -- for signals that might be artificial. Machines 
will do most of the work, alerting controllers only when a signal passes tests 
that screen out the more obvious forms of random noise. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the system's operators are likely to be alerted many times before they 
may find "the fingerprint of E.T.," said Cullers, whose job title is "signal 
detection team leader." 
</P>
<P>
Cullers elaborated on the routine that may be followed if an apparently 
legitimate signal is detected. 
</P>
<P>
"If, first of all, something's gotten through the original net and they've 
looked it up in the (radio) interference catalogue and it's not any known 
source and they've moved the telescope around and they notice that when the 
telescope is off source the signal goes away . . . then, all of us will be 
brought in to determine what the source is." 
</P>
<P>
Scientists would gather in a room here that is only beginning to fill with the 
electronic gadgetry that will help sift the inscrutable noise of the cosmos. 
With the dry humor that marks many of the scientists here, the room has been 
named the User Operations Facility, a play on a set of ubiquitous and infamous 
initials -- UFO. 
</P>
<P>
But no one knows what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
"As to what the signal is going to say, or what the aliens are going to look 
like, it could be anything from the 'encyclopedia galactica' to a missionary 
message, to a piece of propaganda," said Cullers. "The one thing I am certain 
of is that when we get the message I will be surprised." 
</P>
<P>
But everybody will want to be there. 
</P>
<P>
"I've made people around here promise that if they get a signal and I'm alive, 
they're going to let me know right away," said Charles Seeger, 77, who devoted 
14 years to SETI before going into semi-retirement two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Seeger is a sort of oral historian of the program, a walking compendium of 
successes and setbacks such as the death 10 years ago of a NASA administrator, 
Tim Mutch, whose clout and support seemed to guarantee funding for the SETI 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"He fell off the side of Mt. Everest," Seeger said. "He broke his leg in fall 
and the people with him stashed him in a shelter and went to get more help. 
They came back the next day and he wasn't there. Nobody knows what happened. We 
had to start from ground zero again. That's one of our legends." 
</P>
<P>
To an outsider, SETI, at least at Ames, is a subculture of blinding contrasts, 
a mixture of sublime goals and mundane details, of reaching for the stars and 
fighting for the next buck, of staving off the demands of children and jotting 
down one more thought at the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
"After a while, you take it in your stride and it becomes amusing," commented 
John Billingham, acting chief of NASA's SETI office, as he ate a sandwich at 
his desk. His office was in a much greater state of clutter than was Cullers 
from unfinished moving. In fact, Billingham hardly seemed to have unpacked at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
"You take these initial wrenching steps," Billingham added, "from dealing with 
fine details bureaucratic rules and regulations, to the other side of the coin, 
which is appearing at major scientific meetings and giving papers on the 
discovery and how to conduct searches, and the significance, the reasons we're 
really doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Even the most exotic goals have their routine, it seems. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, I work pretty much a standard eight-hour day except for the fact that I 
don't go to lunch," Cullers explained. "Then, typically, I will go home and 
work a little bit in the evenings because it's exciting work. I'm always 
getting ideas, I've always got to jot down just one more thing. Then I get up 
at about 4:30 in the morning, and before my children get up and chaos reigns 
supreme, I usually get in three hours or so of work in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
The search for intelligent life in the cosmos is not an idea universally 
respected. Detractors have argued, plausibly, that there is little chance life 
exists elsewhere. Others maintain that civilizations on different solar systems 
have nothing to say to each other. 
</P>
<P>
More concretely, two weeks ago, the House of Representatives voted to kill all 
$6.1 million in 1991 funding for the NASA project, a blow overshadowed by the 
grounding of the Space Shuttle fleet and the debacle over the Hubble space 
telescope. 
</P>
<P>
Compared with the billions spent for the shuttle and the space telescope, SETI 
funds are minuscule, supporters say. Over the life of the project, total cost 
has been estimated at $100 million. SETI scientists hope that friends in the 
Senate such as Jake Garn, the Utah Republican, will restore at least some of 
the money to next year's federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
When they voted to kill funding, congressmen seemed to feel the project was 
that rare political commodity -- something small and odd enough to be safely 
ridiculed. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that happens is that (SETI) subculture, unfortunately, gets mixed up 
in many peoples minds with other subcultures like UFOS and astrology and 
spoon-bending," said Billingham. "So we like to maintain a polite distance." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the Congressional Record shows that congressmen had a good time 
reading UFO stories from supermarket tabloids into the record, despite the 
decades of protestation by Billingham and others. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Rep. Ronald Machtley, (R-R.I.) suggested that "if there is such a 
super intelligent form of life out there, might it be easier just to listen and 
let them call us?" 
</P>
<P>
That is exactly what the SETI scientists want to do. 
</P>
<P>
Radio astronomer Michael J. Klein, manager of the SETI program at the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory, expressed a thought voiced by many other scientists when 
he decried the cutoff of funds. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a bunch of people here moving money around through savings and 
loans trying to make a quick buck," he said, referring to the wheeling and 
dealing that have left many of the country's savings institutions bankrupt and 
made them the target of massive federal monetary intervention amounting to 
hundreds of billions of dollars. "Yet we get treated worse than the people who 
have really ripped the public off with this whole savings and loan bailout." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the misunderstandings of their work, SETI scientists have persisted, 
they said, because they are driven by an idea that is irresistibly compelling. 
</P>
<P>
While they admit that it may not be the most important scientific work of the 
day, it is a concept so riveting that some have been searching -- or trying to 
search or thinking about searching -- for decades. 
</P>
<P>
Finding an alien civilization "would be most exciting discovery of all for our 
civilization," said Billingham, a British-born physician who once specialized 
in space medicine. 
</P>
<P>
He is an old hand among SETI professionals. He began the SETI project at Ames 
more than 20 years ago and has been a key person in keeping the sputtering 
project alive. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic arguments says that civilizations are widespread in the galaxy and 
the universe," he said, describing the underpinnings of his profession. "These 
arguments cannot be disproved but they can be proved. There are two ways of 
proving them. One is to go after detection of a signal with an active search, 
and the other, of course, is by serendipity. It's our opinion that learning it 
by accident is a very small possibility." 
</P>
<P>
Klein noted that there is growing evidence -- such as the likelihood of other 
planets around other stars -- that at least indirectly support the notion of 
life beyond the solar system. 
</P>
<P>
"Earth doesn't seem to be some unique thing which just happened miraculously 
out here," he said. "It seems to be something that could happen many times in 
the galaxy. We still don't know how life starts and maybe it is miraculous but 
I don't believe it is miraculous in one place." 
</P>
<P>
Seeger agreed, saying: "So far every process that we've found working on Earth 
that we could test in the rest of the galaxy, the rest of the universe, we've 
found to operate there. There's something about our knowledge of the way life 
started like a flash after the Earth congealed and the way it developed . . . 
it looks like a basic process." 
</P>
<P>
Klein has a hard-nosed attitude about the search that gives short shrift to 
mysticism or other less-than-concrete motivations. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess what appeals to me is the actual microwave search -- not all this 
stuff about the role of the human in the universe," he said. "I think in 
contrast to that we have here in the microwave observing project, at least 
technologically, something we do understand. We know how to communicate across 
interstellar distances. It may not be the best way. It may not be the correct 
way that others might have chosen. But, by God, we know it'll work. . . . Let's 
pick up this rock and see if we can hammer something with it." 
</P>
<P>
But even true believers in the arguments that drive the SETI radio search 
concede their chances of discovering a signal are small. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect to be successful at that search," Tarter said. "Whether that is 
sufficient to produce a signal, that is another question. I think anybody who 
is working on this project has a very good concept of just how enormous, how 
vast, this search that we're starting really is. We hope to be successful in 
our lifetimes but understand that maybe it's going to be our children that 
succeed in detecting the signal." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the chances of locating another civilization, the scientists seem 
driven by the chance to do something that has never been done on such a scale 
before. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be exciting when we're on the air, oh, my goodness," said Seeger. 
"It's a very tough job in the sense that you can't just grab some apparatus, 
work for a year and get a yea or nay answer. . . . It's literally fishing with 
the best technology we have at hand now in almost infinite space." 
</P>
<P>
Because of its uncertain nature, Seeger believes that the search for other 
civilizations is best handled by mature scientists who have had achievements in 
other fields. 
</P>
<P>
"No sane person graduating from college should commit himself to this 
indefinite future, because what the hell is he going to be able to say he 
achieved?" Seeger said. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the low chances for success, there are other pitfalls the SETI 
scientists acknowledge. Perhaps the biggest one is that they may have pursued 
their intricate chains of logic and technology to a dead end. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the scary thing. Human beings have an amazing ability to form patterns 
and data when there is no pattern or to get answers out of no information at 
all," said Cullers. "We are operating in the absence of data. The only data we 
have is the single example of us here on Earth and we don't know if we're the 
most typical thing in the universe or an absolutely astonishing, nearly 
miraculous event. Now my physical intuition says that we're typical and there 
are lots of other civilizations out there just like us. Well, that physical 
intuition and a dollar might get you a cup of coffee." 
</P>
<P>
It gets even worse the longer the search goes on, Cullers said. "If I turn on 
my (radio) telescope, and for years on end see nothing except for random noise, 
is that because the search is hard or is that because my methods for looking 
are no good?" 
</P>
<P>
But if a signal is detected within the lifetimes of SETI scientists, Tarter 
believes the rewards will be enormous. "The detection of another civilization, 
a signal from such, would make us have to instantly accept the fact that the 
differences among peoples on Earth are trivial compared to the difference with 
this other completely alien civilization. We'd have to finally adopt a global 
scale as the proper scale for managing of human affairs." 
</P>
<P>
As project scientist at SETI, one of Tarter's recent jobs has been helping 
develop a "post-detection protocol" that would take the task of alien detection 
from science to diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
"Literally we spend a lot of time saying to people, 'OK, what if, this is real, 
now what?' " Tarter explained. "We're now beginning to think about the next 
step -- who will speak for Earth and what will we say? That's something that I 
have no training for. It's not what I went to graduate school for." 
</P>
<P>
Despite her lack of preparation for establishing relations with nonhuman 
intelligence, Tarter commented, "I have to say, emphatically, that I really do 
have the best job in the whole world. . . . There's nobody who has no opinion 
at all about extraterrestrial life and that's pretty amazing." 
</P>
<P>
At a guess, Cullers thinks a successful SETI search might take a thousand 
years. 
</P>
<P>
With a laugh he launched into his favorite analogy about the search for alien 
intelligence. It is, he said, like searching a sandpile for a grain of gold -- 
a sandpile the size of a football field and 10 stories tall. Previous searches 
have explored at most five to 10 grains of sand, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Then he wound up with what seemed to be a well-practiced, rhetorically polished 
conclusion, one forged from his decade of living with the uncertainties of the 
universe. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time we are finished, we may examine an entire thimbleful of sand," he 
said. "Why am I ecstatic about that? Because it will be the first systematic 
attempt to look at the frequencies and stars in our galaxy to see what's there. 
And if there's one grain of gold in a thousand or even a million, we're likely 
to find it. If it's one in a billion, we're going to have to look harder." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PAYING FOR SETI 
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives voted two weeks ago to kill all $6.1 million in 
1991 funding for NASA's SETI project. Compared to the billions spent on the 
Space Shuttle and Hubble telescope, the SETI funds are minuscule, supporters 
say, adding they hope the Senate will restore at least some SETI aid in next 
year's federal budget.

KNOWING WHEN TO SAY 'NO';

<P>
CHILD PSYCHOLOGY: PARENTS CAN BREAK BAD HABITS WITHOUT SQUELCHING CREATIVITY, 
EXPERTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
This was the young mother's question for the famous child psychologist: Her 
baby throws food from the highchair. Should she forbid it? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind cleaning it up," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Another mother at the talk Dr. Lee Salk recently gave in Waterbury, Conn., 
wanted to pursue the topic. If you stop the baby from throwing the food, she 
asked, doesn't that deprive the child of learning about cause and effect? 
</P>
<P>
What is it that makes parents so unsure that they cannot decide how they feel 
about their children reflooring the kitchen with mashed potatoes? 
</P>
<P>
"They have trouble knowing what to do, and they're anxious," said Salk in a 
phone interview from New York, where he practices and is a professor of 
psychology, psychiatry and pediatrics at Cornell University Medical College. 
"There's a fear that by letting the baby do too much, they will be 'spoiling 
the baby.' And by setting any limits, you will be constricting them. But you've 
got to do both." 
</P>
<P>
It would be great if there were a consensus: Allow your baby to do these 
things; forbid him to do those. But after forbidding any dangerous activity -- 
playing with electrical outlets or the stove -- you are back to the tough 
business of being a parent: making judgment calls. You have to consider what 
the child is capable of and his or her need to explore. 
</P>
<P>
When a baby plays with an outlet, a parent will say "no," and the baby gets the 
idea that the parent disapproves, said Dr. Charles Zeanah, associate professor 
of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown University in Providence, R.I. "That 
doesn't necessarily mean that the children have learned the lesson that they're 
not supposed to do that, and it doesn't necessarily mean that a 1-year-old is 
defying the parents, thinking, 'They don't want me to do this, but I'm going to 
do it anyway' if they go back and play with it again." 
</P>
<P>
Generally, children must be at least 18 months old before they can really 
understand the rules. 
</P>
<P>
Children need to explore, but "if they don't know what the limits are, then the 
child doesn't really figure things out," Salk said. "If you let your child pick 
up a bunch of peas and slam them against the wall, and you smile and think what 
a great artistic production this is, you're not preparing this child for the 
real world." Provide crayons or paints at other times. 
</P>
<P>
But you can't expect a 1-year-old to see the house as you do. 
</P>
<P>
"Toddlers in particular are fascinated with making things happen. They develop 
all sorts of irritating habits like turning light switches on and off -- 
anything they can do that can make something exciting and different happen," 
Zeanah says. "When they find something unfamiliar, they practice it over and 
over again. . . . It's a good thing for kids to do that. You don't want to come 
down too hard. But when you don't want them to turn the TV on and off, it's a 
good idea to have some alternative to offer them. That doesn't squelch the urge 
to master things but at the same time achieves your goal of trying to get them 
away."

CNN CO-ANCHOR CRIER MEETS THE PRESS; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: THE FORMER TEXAS STATE JUDGE DEFENDS HER RIGHT TO BE A JOURNALIST. 
SHE CITES HER TRAINING AS A TRIAL LAWYER AND PROFESSOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Catherine Crier, the tall, blond beauty who went from Texas state judge in 
Dallas to co-anchor of CNN's nightly "The World Today" in October, did not go 
quietly into Thursday as she defended her qualifications to front a national 
newscast. 
</P>
<P>
Facing about 125 reporters and columnists who are at the Century Plaza to make 
the rounds of TV executives and stars this month as part of their annual summer 
tour, Crier was hit with a flurry of questions about her career switch. 
</P>
<P>
How would she feel if Diane Sawyer went to the Texas bench? What qualifications 
does Crier have to do journalism? Did her looks have anything to do with her 
new job? Is there jealousy among women at CNN who were passed over for the job? 
</P>
<P>
Without blinking, Crier, wearing a shocking-pink suit with a string of pearls, 
flew right into the jaws of the questions, while her boss, Ted Turner, was in 
the audience next to his frequent companion, Jane Fonda, also in a summer pink 
ensemble and looking blond. 
</P>
<P>
What right does Crier have to be a journalist? The "life and career path" of a 
journalist and a lawyer, particularly one involved in litigation, are "very, 
very similar," she contended. Her experience, she said, included "interviewing 
witnesses, hitting the streets, working with the stories on a head-to-head 
basis just as a journalist would, developing a presentation, delivering that 
presentation, teaching as a law professor, teaching around the country as an 
advocacy instructor, everything from writing the past 12 years little treatises 
to communications techniques for lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
She also said she had "particularized training" as a trial lawyer and professor 
with an interest in international and political affairs: "Look at stories 
today. I would say that 60%, 70% of the stories are somehow legally related." 
</P>
<P>
How about her looks?: "You're asking me to make an evaluation that I was not 
called upon to make." At the press conference with her was Bob Furnad, CNN vice 
president and senior executive producer, who said that he hires by talent, "but 
appearance is one of the factors." 
</P>
<P>
Crier didn't comment on Sawyer's credibility as a judge, but said she didn't 
feel that "the experience base of going from judge to journalism works well the 
other way around." 
</P>
<P>
As for the question of whether other women at CNN felt passed over by her 
appointment, Furnad said that other women on the staff already had other strong 
responsibilities and were all important and doing a great job. Then why, asked 
one reporter, were they not here? 
</P>
<P>
He returned with a smile, "Because we all knew you wanted to attack this 
woman." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, CNN announced Thursday that on July 23, its hour "Newsnight" series 
will add an "interactive" segment in which viewers can vote to select what 
stories will be covered on the program. 
</P>
<P>
By calling a 900 telephone number, viewers will be able to vote on as many as 
six stories on which they would like more background. The two stories that get 
the most votes will be covered later in the broadcast, usually by repeating a 
report from earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
"CNN will retain complete editorial control over the stories we air," Furnad 
said in response to a question about whether the network was relinquishing its 
news judgment to viewers. 
</P>
<P>
The cable networks have been announcing a tidal wave of new shows during their 
sessions with the reporters: 
</P>
<P>
* On Oct. 14, A&amp;E will premiere "The Inside Track With Graham Nash," a 
Sunday night series in which musician-composer-activist Nash will talk with 
artists about themselves, their music and their social ideas. 
</P>
<P>
* The Disney Channel, in conjunction with Jim Henson Productions, is ready to 
launch a series Aug. 25 of 13 half-hours of Mother Goose stories (three tales 
per show) as adapted in the Muppet manner from L. Frank Baum's "Mother Goose in 
Prose." 
</P>
<P>
* Financial News Network will do three new series in the fall, including "Power 
Profiles," a day-in-the-life look at major business executives. 
</P>
<P>
* Showtime said that it will start production next month on the first of six 
half-hour adaptations of satirist Kurt Vonnegut Jr. short stories from his 
"Welcome to the Monkey House" collection, published in 1968. Vonnegut will host 
the shows, at least to start: "I could stink up the joint," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He declared himself pleased with the first two scripts by veteran 
writer-producer Stan Daniels. They read "better than when I wrote them. . . . 
I'm one of the few people who was ever on Earth to be grateful to Hollywood. 
Margaret Mitchell and I are crazy about Hollywood."

FCC UPHOLDS 24-HOUR-A-DAY BAN ON 'INDECENT' BROADCASTS; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: THE COMMISSION'S UNANIMOUS RULING FINDS THE PROHIBITION CONSTITUTIONAL. 
RESTRICTING SUCH PROGRAMMING TO SPECIFIC TIMES AND LOCK BOXES ARE INSUFFICIENT 
TO PROTECT CHILDREN, THE PANEL SAYS. 
</P>

<P>
The Federal Communications Commission ruled Thursday that a 24-hour-a-day ban 
on "indecent" radio and television broadcasts meets constitutional standards 
and does not violate free-speech provisions of the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
A unanimous five-member commission said that its ruling was based on its 
findings that children -- whom it now defines as 17 or younger -- "are in the 
broadcast audience for both radio and television at all times of day and 
night." 
</P>
<P>
The commission said that alternatives such as restricting potentially 
"indecent" programming to specific times and mechanical restrictions, such as 
lock boxes, "are insufficient to protect them from exposure to harmful indecent 
programming." 
</P>
<P>
The commission issued its regulations for the ban after Congress mandated a 
24-hour prohibition on the broadcast of "indecent" programs in 1988. The 
regulations were stayed in January, 1989, by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
District of Columbia pending a review of their constitutionality. 
</P>
<P>
The FCC reviewed Arbitron data for radio and television to determine whether 
children remain in the late-night viewing audience. In reaching its 
conclusions, the commission staff also relied on a 1988 Supreme Court 
"dial-a-porn" ruling, in which the court held that indecent speech may be 
regulated if it promotes a "compelling" government interest and is "narrowly 
tailored" to serve that interest. 
</P>
<P>
In its action Thursday, the commission approved a staff report that concluded 
that the congressionally mandated prohibition "is a sufficiently narrow means 
of preventing access to indecent broadcasts by children." 
</P>
<P>
FCC chief counsel Robert Pettit said that because children are in the broadcast 
audience in the middle of the night as well as the daytime, it makes it 
difficult to target programming into specific time periods. 
</P>
<P>
The commission report now goes to the appeals court, which is expected to 
schedule oral arguments as part of a broader challenge to the prohibition. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, the FCC action drew swift criticism from broadcasters and others 
involved in the court challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"The courts have made it clear that a 24-hour ban on constitutionally protected 
speech is contrary to the First Amendment," said Edward O. Fritts, president of 
the National Assn. of Broadcasters. "We are disappointed that the FCC, by its 
action today, ignores this judicial precedent and the record in its support 
developed in this proceeding." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the association issued a statement of principles for radio and 
television in which it urged broadcasters to avoid programming that "panders to 
prurient or morbid interests." 
</P>
<P>
The broadcasters are among 17 groups who have challenged the blanket indecency 
broadcast prohibitions in court. The unusual coalition of challengers includes 
CBS, NBC, ABC and the Public Broadcasting Service, the Motion Picture Assn. of 
America, the Recording Industry Assn. of America, Action for Children's 
Television, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Reporters Committee for 
Freedom of the Press. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy B. Dyk, lead counsel for the coalition, which is challenging the 
constitutionality of a blanket ban, said Thursday that the coalition firmly 
believes that "parents should be making the choices and not the government." 
</P>
<P>
The FCC said it was defining children as 17 or younger to be consistent with 
numerous state regulations, such as those that limit the sale of pornographic 
materials to minors. 
</P>
<P>
"What we do will pass Constitutional muster," said Commissioner Ervin S. 
Duggan, who added that parents have to be "superhuman" to monitor their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Duggan said that many parents today find their homes "alien territories" 
invaded by value systems and information that they find abhorrent. "Parents 
need the support of the society and culture. They are not enemies of the 
Constitution. They are people like you and me. We owe some decent concern to 
the upset and anguish they are expressing." 
</P>
<P>
The commission said it has received 92,500 letters dealing with this issue, 
88,000 favoring the ban and 4,500 opposing it. 
</P>
<P>
Until a final court ruling, the FCC continues to have enforcement authority 
over broadcasts that occur during daytime hours, but cannot take action against 
alleged indecent broadcasts that occur after 8 p.m. until the appeals court 
ruling. According to its staff, the commission receives many more complaints 
about radio broadcasts than television. 
</P>
<P>
FCC officials refused to speculate on what effect the 24-hour ban might have on 
radio and television if it is upheld by the courts, saying that each case will 
be considered separately. 
</P>
<P>
The FCC, for purposes of broadcasting, has defined indecency as "language that 
describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community 
standards for the broadcast medium, sexual or excretory activities or organs." 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the Supreme Court upheld the commission's definition of indecency as 
well as its authority to restrict those broadcasts to a time of day when is was 
unlikely that children would be in the broadcast audience. The commission 
concluded that such programming could not be broadcast until after midnight, 
but the appeals court ordered the commission to conduct a more thorough 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
Before the commission could launch its inquiry, Congress passed legislation for 
a 24-hour blanket ban on "indecent" broadcasts. The commission adopted a rule 
on the 24-hour ban, but the appeals court stayed implementation of the ban 
pending a review of its constitutionality. At the same time, the court agreed 
to allow the commission time to compile a record supporting the 24-hour ban. 
</P>
<P>
The official commission report is expected to be made public shortly.

BUSH TREE? Will the President take time to plant a tree for the local

Bush's advance planners "tell me he wants to do it, but the location is up in 
the air." . . . It won't be in Little Saigon. The White House considered a side 
trip but says there's no time. Larson recommends the Cal State Fullerton

it's California history." Dave Lesher and Mary Helen Berg

LAGUNA BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fred Millard is used to hot, sweaty situations -- he swims, bikes and 
participates in long-distance runs. But even the most grueling of triathlons 
didn't prepare him for the workout he got while putting out a potentially 
disastrous fire in Laguna Canyon on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Millard, 44, who works in residential home refinancing, was driving home to 
Laguna Niguel after a practice run with a friend in Irvine when he spotted a 
fire along Laguna Canyon Road just north of the junction with El Toro Road. 
</P>
<P>
"I noticed smoke, then a ring of fire about 10 feet in diameter," he said. "It 
was in dry brush about 10 feet from the road. It looked like the fire had just 
started up, maybe from somebody tossing out a cigarette." 
</P>
<P>
Millard stopped his car, grabbed a towel he had used in a morning swim workout 
and used it to beat down the flames. Three other motorists stopped to pitch in 
and the foursome spent 15 minutes battling the fire. 
</P>
<P>
By the time fire units arrived, the fire was all but out. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach Deputy Fire Chief Rich Dewberry said Thursday that the situation 
could have been worse because "the canyon is particularly volatile at this time

Millard didn't get the names of his three helpers. "We just shook hands and 
congratulated each other and left," he said. "One of them was dressed in real 
nice clothes -- slacks and white shirt and tie. The other two were in casual 
clothes." 
</P>
<P>
Millard, by the way, was in very casual clothes, still wearing his running 
shorts and tank top from his practice run. 
</P>
<P>
"A policeman at the scene asked if I'd just been running by," Millard recalled.

FIRE RACES OVER CHINO HILLS PARK; 
</P>
<P>

HALF OF THE PARK WAS BURNED.

<P>
A rapidly moving brush fire, started by a 15-year-old boy setting off a model 
rocket, raced through the tinder-dry Chino Hills State Park on Thursday, 
burning at least 5,000 acres but causing no serious injuries or loss of 
buildings, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, which sent up a huge plume of smoke that could be seen for miles, was 
burning fiercely along brushy hills on the Orange-San Bernardino County line 
early today, but firefighters predicted that it would be contained by 
mid-morning. 
</P>
<P>
The Yorba Linda teen-ager who accidentally started the fire was playing with a 
model rocket launcher in the park near his home, fire officials said. The 
youth, who was not identified because he is a minor, was arrested near the fire 
scene. He had tried to put out the fire himself and had called the 911 
emergency number to report it, authorities said. He was released to his parents 
after being charged with a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
"He's admitted to starting it," said Orange County Fire Department Capt. Dan 
Young. 
</P>
<P>
Young said the boy suffered minor burns as he attempted to put out the blaze, 
but did not require hospitalization. Four prison inmates also received minor 
injuries while helping to battle the inferno, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy will be charged with the misdemeanor offense of "recklessly starting a 
fire," according to Orange County Fire Department Investigator John McMasters. 
</P>
<P>
McMasters said the boy "was very cooperative and very apologetic." 
</P>
<P>
According to fire investigators, the blaze started about 12:40 p.m. at the 
south border of the park near the intersection of Blue Gum Drive and Rim Crest 
Drive, in the north-central part of Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze raced into the state park, less than a block away, and quickly moved 
northeasterly toward the San Bernardino County line, adjacent to the Carbon 
Canyon area, scene of a major brush fire two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Carbon Canyon fire started about 11 a.m. June 27 and consumed 6,600 acres 
in Orange and San Bernardino counties. Police arrested a transient, Peter Diaz 
Reyes, 29, and charged him with starting the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
The burned-over land in the Carbon Canyon area served as a buffer and kept the 
new fire from spreading there, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not a lot of fuel left (in the Carbon Canyon area) because of the last 
fire," Young noted. 
</P>
<P>
No evacuations were ordered as the brush fire spread, but some dairy cattle in 
the hills had to be moved to safer areas. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, which spread quickly because of the dry, brittle grassland in Chino 
Hills State Park, literally ignited in waves. 
</P>
<P>
"We had one fire engine that was driving along at 25 m.p.h., and the fire kept 
up with it," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
Chino Hills State Park encompasses about 10,000 acres, and most of the burned 
land was within that area. Fire ignited several aged sycamores in the park, and 
they glowed Thursday night like eerie jack-o-lanterns as the blaze consumed the 
insides of the trees. 
</P>
<P>
Late Thursday night, the fire came within a quarter of a mile of the 
Butterfield Ranch subdivision in San Bernardino County. Residents of the 
unincorporated community poured out into the streets to watch the fire raging 
on hills close to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino County Supervisor Larry Walker, who was at Butterfield Ranch, 
said: "We're lucky with this one. It seems to have gone through without 
endangering anyone. But the sad thing is that Chino Hills State Park is in 
really bad shape." 
</P>
<P>
Although no structures were reported lost in the state park, some wooden signs 
were damaged. Walker said that although a lot of the park vegetation looked 
devastated, much "is chaparral, which cleans itself out in a fire, and it'll 
come back to life within a couple of years." 
</P>
<P>
Loss of the 40- to 50-year-old trees was a more severe blow, however. 
</P>
<P>
The brush fire came within a mile of the Olinda Village area of Brea during the 
afternoon. The village also had been threatened by the Carbon Canyon fire, 
prompting some residents of the area to remark that the fires are virtually 
inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
More than 500 firefighters and a wide range of equipment, including airplanes 
and helicopters dropping anti-fire chemicals, worked in 90-plus-degree 
temperatures to try to halt the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
Traci Roach, 25, stood in a subdivision street holding her 6-month-old daughter 
while her husband, Dale, 25, videotaped the fire raging in the nearby hills. 
</P>
<P>
"The firefighters say it's going the other way so I'm not that worried, but at 
5 o'clock I came out here and it was all over those hills all of a sudden," 
Traci said. "I couldn't believe it. It's really scary." 
</P>
<P>
Martha Schildknecht, 62, who also lives in Butterfield Ranch, stood in front of 
her home, staring at the hills. "It scares me when I see the fire so close," 
she said. "I wonder if we should get our things and get out of here, but the 
firemen say we should be OK."

QUIRK IN STATE LAW SAVES BALLOT MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A major environmental ballot measure, ruled dead earlier this week for lack of 
signatures, has qualified after all for the Nov. 6 election, the city clerk's 
office said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
An obscure quirk in state law, discovered only Wednesday, made the difference, 
city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The ballot measure is a proposed City Charter amendment that would forbid the 
sale of park or beach land in Huntington Beach without a vote of the people. A 
furor over Pierside Village, the city's proposed lease of oceanfront land for 
restaurants, is among the reasons why residents circulated petitions for the 
ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
City Clerk Connie Brockway said that City Atty. Gail C. Hutton notified her 
Thursday that the parks proposal does qualify for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Brockway said she discovered on Wednesday that a quirk in state law treats 
proposed charter amendments differently than initiatives. A charter amendment 
must have 15% of the signatures of registered voters from the last official 
count, whereas an initiative must have 15% of the registered voters at the time 
the initiative was launched. 
</P>
<P>
In Huntington Beach, the number of registered voters dropped from 102,000 last 
fall to about 96,000 this spring. Brockway said that city and county officials 
earlier had thought that the proposed charter amendment had to secure 15% of 
the registered voters, based on the 102,000 figure. 
</P>
<P>
But based on the 96,000 figure, "There needed to be 14,420 valid signatures, 
and this (ballot measure) has 14,751," Brockway said. "Those signatures have 
already been verified by the county registrar of voters office." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the registrar's office said the measure did not qualify for the 
ballot because it needed 15,302 voter signatures -- but that was the number 
needed for an initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Cook, spokeswoman for Save Our Parks, said Thursday night that she was 
"delighted" that the measure has now qualified. Save Our Parks, a citizens' 
environmental group, was formed in September to battle City Council proposals 
to lease Central Park land for a commercial golf course. 
</P>
<P>
"All we've wanted is a chance to get this on the ballot so the citizens can 
vote on it, and now we have it," Cook said. To become law, the Charter proposal 
must be approved by a majority of those voting in the city's Nov. 6 election.

COASTAL COMMISSION APPROVES PIER PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To the jubilation of city officials, the powerful state Coastal Commission on 
Thursday unanimously approved the city's plans for razing its old, 
storm-damaged pier and replacing it with a new one. 
</P>
<P>
"This was very important," said Mike Adams, the city's director of community 
services. 
</P>
<P>
"This now gives us the green light for proceeding with contracts. We can keep 
right on schedule." 
</P>
<P>
The Coastal Commission, meeting in Long Beach, voted 11 to 0 to approve the 
pier plans after a presentation by the city. No one spoke against the city's 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
The old pier has been closed since July, 1988, when engineers deemed it unsafe 
for use because of age and multiple storm damage. The end of the pier, 
including a new restaurant, was broken off and thrown into the ocean by a storm 
in January, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The city plans to tear down the remainder of the old pier shortly after the 
Sept. 3 Labor Day holiday. Construction of a new pier, estimated to cost $12.8 
million, is to begin in late November or early December. 
</P>
<P>
The Coastal Commission approval was necessary because it is the state agency 
that governs land use of the coastal areas. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HAZARDOUS SPILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County Hazardous Materials Team, or HAZMAT, is administered by the 
county Health Care Agency division of environmental health. It responds to 
calls on chemical spills and other incidents involving hazardous materials. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes it goes to the site, other times it advises citizens or local fire 
departments over the phone. 
</P>
<P>
Of 17 local fire departments in Orange County (16 city departments plus the 
county), three have hazardous materials units that cover the entire county 
through mutual aid agreements -- Anaheim, Huntington Beach and the county 
station in Irvine. HAZMAT is called in most, but not all, hazardous spills. 
Following is HAZMAT's Northwest section spill response log for April.

COUNCIL BACKS BILL ON ABANDONED WELLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER ADAMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city is urging the Legislature to order oil companies to plug and seal 
abandoned oil wells that pose a health and safety hazard, and which are 
eyesores on the landscape. 
</P>
<P>
A resolution passed by the City Council this week puts the city's voice behind 
a bill sponsored by state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) to sharply 
increase the fees oil companies must pay for wells that have not produced oil 
or gas for five years. 
</P>
<P>
The city took an interest in the bill because it is "looking to the future and 
the eventual closing down of oil operations on the Hellman Ranch property," 
Development Director Lee Whittenberg said. There are 52 wells on the property 
and an additional half dozen elsewhere in the city, he said. Only two wells 
have sat idle for more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
The city's resolution says that more than 40,000 of the state's 92,000 oil, gas 
and injection wells are idle; more than 14,000 have not produced for five years 
or longer. S

COAST GUARD SAVES BOY, 8, FROM OCEAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 8-year-old Huntington Beach boy was plucked from the ocean by a Coast Guard 
boat after he was swept out to sea and trapped near some rocks off the Oregon 
shore, a Coast Guard spokesman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Dunbar, who was on a beach outing with a group of friends Wednesday, was 
taken to a hospital, where he was treated and released, Petty Officer Randy 
Sharp said. 
</P>
<P>
Dunbar was swimming in relatively large, six-foot surf on a foam body board 
when a powerful rip current washed him seaward, Sharp said. His friends swam in 
and asked a resident to notify rescue officials. 
</P>
<P>
Dunbar was wearing a wet suit that was too big for him, and it filled with 
water, hampering the boy's ability to swim, Sharp said. The boy did have fins, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time our boat got to him, he had taken in lots of water. He was 
conscious and OK, but he was very scared," Sharp said. 
</P>
<P>
Dunbar was visiting a grandfather, Ted Tiegen of Lincoln Beach. Relatives 
declined to comment about the incident.

GAG LAW TO PLUG LEAKS PROPOSED; 
</P>
<P>
ORDINANCE: A SANTA ANA COUNCILMAN PROPOSES A MEASURE MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO JAIL 
OR FINE PEOPLE WHO TELL WHAT HAPPENED AT SECRET COUNCIL MEETINGS.

<P>
To plug an abundance of information leaks around City Hall, City Councilman 
Daniel E. Griset said Thursday that he wants council members to be fined $1,000 
or subjected to up to six months in jail if they publicly disclose matters 
discussed in private meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Griset said he will propose next week that the ordinance also target city 
employees "or any other person present" during closed council sessions, 
permitted by the state's open-meetings law only for discussions about personnel 
or pending litigation. The state law contains no such prohibition. 
</P>
<P>
Griset said he believes that there have been "calculated leaks of information" 
that could cost the city millions in contract negotiations or litigation. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the sensitive nature of personnel matters and labor negotiations in 
these sessions, it seems appropriate to create standards of public conduct," 
Griset said. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Richards L. Norton called the proposal a "political tactic" and 
a violation of the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we should keep secrets about anything," Norton said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Norton said he does not discuss personnel matters and litigation 
outside of closed sessions. 
</P>
<P>
The council has at least two closed sessions each month either before or after 
each regular council meeting. In the proposed law, those who attend closed 
sessions could only disclose the contents of discussions with permission from 
the council. 
</P>
<P>
Griset's proposed law mirrors one in Costa Mesa, the only city in the county 
that has such a prohibition. Costa Mesa City Atty. Tom Kathe said that 
ordinance was passed in 1962 and updated in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"It is up to the City Council to decide whether they want something discussed 
or not," Kathe said. "This is not a gag order. It's basically to insure 
confidentiality. There's a lot of things discussed that require 
confidentiality." 
</P>
<P>
Griset and Norton have been feuding on a variety of issues ever since the two 
opposed each other in a 1988 council race. Last fall, they faced off in a 
dispute over whether to place City Atty. Edward J. Cooper on administrative 
leave. Cooper remained in his post after Norton and Councilman John Acosta 
could not muster enough council support to oust him. 
</P>
<P>
"My proposal is strictly to protect those special provisions of privacy," 
Griset said. 
</P>
<P>
Griset says he isn't singling out anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Norton said, "My real feeling about this is that it is intended to create a 
situation where council members can accuse other members of spilling the beans 
during closed sessions." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas W. Newton, staff attorney for the California Newspaper Publishers Assn., 
said the proposed law could affect the news media. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a clamp on information and I think it's going to have a tremendous 
effect on the media," Newton said. "This ordinance would mandate that certain 
information can now be closed down and it will have a profound effect on news 
gatherers."

BUDGET IMPASSE WORRIES HOME-CARE RECIPIENTS;

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For home-care provider Bette Bendorf, the political fight in Sacramento over 
control of the state budget hit home last week when one of her aged clients 
took her hand as she was leaving and cried, afraid that Bendorf might never 
return. 
</P>
<P>
As one of 5,000 state home-care providers who didn't get a paycheck this month 
because lawmakers have failed to pass a budget, Bendorf is haunted by the 
96-year-old widow's fear that without Bendorf's help she will die in a nursing 
home. 
</P>
<P>
As the budget impasse between the Legislature and Gov. George Deukmejian 
continues in its second week and the backlog of the state's unpaid bills 
mounts, the prospect of "being institutionalized" creeps more and more often 
into the conversations between Bendorf and her dozen clients in Huntington 
Beach, most of whom are elderly and all of whom are poor. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's just terrible what they're doing," Bendorf said of the lawmakers' 
inability to strike a compromise. "The people we take care of are very nervous. 
They're very upset about it. They're worried if were going to continue working 
. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of them would just go to a convalescent home. The convalescent home is 
more or less the last stage of your life to most people. You just go to bed and 
you die there. There's no more living." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Senate passed a $52.5-billion spending plan that 
included $1.3 billion in tax and fee increases. Deukmejian, however, wants a 
$53.8-billion budget and has said he will oppose any plan that incorporates tax 
and fee increases. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County officials said this week that county government faces no 
immediate cash crisis as a result of the state budget impasse. The county has 
$78 million in cash on hand. But the county's director of social services, 
Larry Leaman, said he fears that the state's failure to pay its bills might 
force many of the county's home-care providers to quit to find a more secure 
livelihood. 
</P>
<P>
Bendorf, 37, and a single parent, has worked as a home-care provider with her 
mother, who is 56 and also named Betty for the past five years. They share an 
apartment in Huntington Beach width the younger woman's 6-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
Like most state-paid home-care providers, Bendorf and her mother are paid 
minimum wage and together receive about $2,000 a month. They are on call 24 
hours a day, seven days a week, she said. They provide basic nursing care and 
physical therapy for some clients. For others they run errands, such as buying 
their groceries or taking them to the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Bendorf and her mother are usually paid twice a month but they didn't get their 
first check for July and are not expecting to receive the second, which usually 
comes around the 15th. For the first time in seven years, Bendorf said, they 
did not make their rent payment and owe a $30 late fee. They are also 
delinquent on their utility bills. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had to call my utilities and get an extension on my bills," Bendorf said. 
"I told them the governor didn't sign the budget so I don't get paid and that 
as soon as I get paid I'll pay them. They've been very nice about it, but how 
long is your landlord going to be nice?" 
</P>
<P>
Then shifting to worries about her clients Bendorf added: "I can't walk out on 
people that need help like that. I really don't know what to do." 
</P>
<P>
Bendorf's mother echoes the concerns of her daughter, saying she does not know 
how long they can stave off the bill collectors or the fears of their clients. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them I don't know what's going to happen," Bendorf's mother said. "It 
really throws some of the people for a loop."

<TEXT>
<P>
Charles W. Colson, the Watergate conspirator who founded a prison ministry, 
will visit Brea on Monday to tour a home that prisoners are refurbishing as 
part of a rehabilitation program. 
</P>
<P>
Colson, a special counsel to former President Richard M. Nixon who was known as 
his hatchet man, served seven months in prison for obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
He became a born-again Christian and has since convinced even former skeptics 
of his sincerity. 
</P>
<P>
His visit to Orange County coincides with weeklong festivities leading up to 
Friday's opening of the Richard M. Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
Colson will be visiting a home on East Fir Street that is being cleaned and 
refurbished by 10 inmates on furlough from Boron Federal Prison Camp and Lompoc 
Federal Prison. 
</P>
<P>
The program is sponsored by Prison Fellowship Ministries' Community Service 
Project, which Colson launched in 1982. It aims to help inmates restore their 
self-respect and repay society by working on projects that aid the needy. 
</P>
<P>
The East Fir Street house belongs to a couple in their 80s. The husband is 
living in a convalescent hospital until the house is remodeled.

AFTER 38 YEARS, A MOTHER IS REUNITED WITH HER SON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY MARCANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Virgie Byrns lapsed into a coma after a traffic accident in 1952, she was 
married and the mother of four children. When she awoke three months later, she 
found that she was no longer married and that her children had disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 30 years, she worked to track down her three oldest children. By 
1987, she had found them. But her fourth child, whom she named Wayne Albert 
Bryan, was nothing more than a vague shadow in her impaired memory. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, after 38 years, Byrns was reunited with her "forgotten" son -- now 
named James Robert Cottam -- in an emotional scene in the front yard of her 
cluttered Santa Ana home. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh God, I never thought I'd see you again," Byrns, 70, cried as she tightly 
embraced Cottam, now 39. "Oh, thank you, Jesus! Thank you, Jesus!" 
</P>
<P>
Although Byrns last saw Cottam in diapers, she said she immediately recognized 
the heavyset, gray-bearded man with a wife and 8-year-old son in tow as her 
long-lost child. "You sure do look like your daddy," Byrns told Cottam, whom 
she continues to refer to as Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
For Cottam, the reunion capped a whirlwind 12-hour period that brought back his 
lost past with dizzying urgency. For Byrns, the reunion was the final chapter 
in a bizarre odyssey that spanned nearly four decades. 
</P>
<P>
The tale started in 1952 when Byrns, then a diesel-truck driver transporting 
fertilizer, was critically injured in a wreck outside of San Diego. She lapsed 
into a three-month coma that resulted in severe memory loss, she said. 
</P>
<P>
When she emerged from unconsciousness, hospital workers told her that her 
husband, Albert Bryan -- he died in 1964 -- had filed for divorce. But even 
more shocking was news that the father and the state legal system, believing 
that Byrns would not survive, placed her three oldest children in foster care. 
Byrns said that while she remembered her two daughters and older son, her 
memory loss caused her to forget that she had given birth to a fourth child. 
</P>
<P>
In 1954, at age 3, Wayne Albert Bryan was adopted by Robert L. Cottam, a San 
Diego County elementary school principal, and renamed James Robert Cottam. 
Although he knew he was adopted, Cottam said he had no knowledge of his natural 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
"I was born near San Diego, in a Navy town, so I assumed I was a war baby," 
said Cottam, a plumber and mechanic from Grass Valley near San Jacinto in 
Riverside County, referring to the Korean War. "I had a good home -- I have no 
complaints about that." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Byrns set out to find her three oldest children, Joycelene, Dolly 
and Alfred. But under strict state guidelines of the time, adoption information 
was sealed and Byrns was unable to determine the whereabouts of her children. 
</P>
<P>
After a while she gave up, remarried, and gave birth to two more children. 
</P>
<P>
When the laws changed in 1984 to allow release of some information on adopted 
children -- albeit not their identities -- Byrns was able to track down her 
three lost children. But Cottam remained a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Byrns turned to Lori Carangelo, who runs "an adoptive civil 
liberties organization" from her Palm Desert home, for help. Carangelo 
eventually succeeded in tracking down Cottam. 
</P>
<P>
At 11 p.m. Wednesday night, Carangelo phoned Cottam's adoptive father, who 
delivered the news to Cottam. "He was telling me, 'You have brothers and 
sisters and your mom is looking for you,' " Cottam said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County waited seven years for the return of Team Tennis. 
</P>
<P>
It waited some more Thursday night at the Newport Beach Dukes' home opener 
against the Raleigh Edge at the John Wayne Tennis Club. 
</P>
<P>
The Dukes and the Edge, two new franchises, were still playing four hours after 
they began. Raleigh eventually won, 27-23. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Herr and Shaun Stafford of Raleigh defeated Sophie Amiach and Amy Frazier 
of the Dukes, 6-3, in the deciding women's doubles set. 
</P>
<P>
Amiach and Frazier trailed, 4-2, but won the seventh game and appeared to have 
control. But Herr and Stafford settled down and won the set. 
</P>
<P>
The teams were tied, 15-15, after three sets, but Tim Wilkison of Raleigh beat 
Roger Smith, 6-5 (5-1), for a 21-20 lead heading into the final set. 
</P>
<P>
Only about half of the original crowd of 800 remained as the final set began. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know what to expect," Dukes Coach Greg Patton said. "Midway through 
the match, I realized every point is so important." 
</P>
<P>
The Dukes lost two tiebreakers and that, coupled with the loss in the women's 
doubles, was too much to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
"I really like what I see on our team," Patton said. "I'm real excited. There's 
no doubt it's exciting tennis. I didn't realize it would go so long." 
</P>
<P>
Patton, who still hasn't settled on a lineup, also said, "We need to get some 
matches under our belts. I've got to learn the best way to use our guys." 
</P>
<P>
Raleigh made its debut with a 26-19 loss to the Los Angeles Strings Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
In the opening mixed doubles set, Marty Davis and Amiach fell to Herr and Tim 
Pawsat, 6-4. Herr and Pawsat broke Davis for a 5-4 lead, then went on to win 
with Pawsat serving. 
</P>
<P>
That was the biggest lead of the match for either team. 
</P>
<P>
Frazier's 6-3 victory over Stafford, a former University of Florida 
All-American, pushed the Dukes into the lead, 10-9. But Pawsat and Tim Wilkison 
defeated Davis and Smith, 6-5 (5-2), to tie the score, 15-15, heading into the 
final two sets. 
</P>
<P>
The Dukes play Miami Beach at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at the John Wayne Tennis Club.

DEVELOPERS SEE POTENTIAL PROFITS IN COSTA MESA'S DOWNTOWN BUSINESS AREA 
</P>

<P>
Costa Mesa's old downtown was once called "Goat Hill" and is commemorated by a 
tavern of the same name near the intersection of Harbor and Newport boulevards. 
But the city's downtown has shifted in the last 20 years from south to 
northwest. 
</P>
<P>
It is now centered on the huge South Coast Plaza shopping mall and the big 
office buildings across Bristol Street from the mall. 
</P>
<P>
The old downtown -- once slightly shabby as attention shifted to the mall -- 
has been getting a face lift recently from developers who see it as a good 
location with access to a sizable market. The latest developers to try their 
luck include a group of Southern Californians backed by British money who will 
build 185,000 square feet of shops and boutiques, eight movie theaters, 
restaurants and a supermarket in the triangle formed by Harbor and Newport 
boulevards and 19th Street. 
</P>
<P>
The new Triangle Square will feature arches, domes, towers and columns in a 
Mediterranean motif that will loom large over the intersection, compared to the 
low row of one-story shops that were torn down to make way for the new 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
The three sides of the new building will surround an open courtyard designed 
for foot traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Developers are Klein Enterprises, developer of One Pacific Plaza in Huntington 
Beach; Pacific Development Partners, with major redevelopment projects in 
Inglewood and Compton; and developer Richard J. Shapiro. The developers are 
joint venturing with Capital &amp; Counties USA Inc., the U.S. arm of a British 
developer. 
</P>
<P>
The building is scheduled to open in the spring of 1992.

ASICS LETS HOT AIR OUT OF SHOE ADS; 
</P>
<P>
MARKETING: FOUNTAIN VALLEY FIRM TO PIGGYBACK ITS COMMERCIALS ON THE BIG-BUDGET 
CAMPAIGNS OF REEBOK AND NIKE, POKING FUN AT THE CONCEPT OF 'PUMP' SHOES.

<P>
Athletic shoemaker ASICS Tiger Inc. wants to deflate "The Pump" with some 
hard-sell tactics and a little gel. 
</P>
<P>
The Fountain Valley-based distributor of ASICS Tiger shoes is launching a 
television advertising campaign next week poking fun at what it calls 
"gimmicky" basketball shoes. 
</P>
<P>
The company's ads will particularly target basketball shoes made by Reebok 
International Ltd. and Nike Inc. that feature tiny air pumps that inflate the 
shoe for better foot support. 
</P>
<P>
But some might say that ASICS Tiger, a Japanese-owned company, is resorting to 
a marketing gimmick of its own. 
</P>
<P>
No pumps for ASICS Tiger, just a bit of "semifluid silicone-based substance 
permanently encapsulated in pads" beneath the heels and balls of the feet. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-second commercial begins with two players meeting on the playground for 
a one-on-one basketball game. The guy wearing brand X (read Nike or Reebok) 
remarks that his competitor, wearing ASICS Tigers, cannot possibly win because 
he isn't wearing pump shoes. 
</P>
<P>
While the two men are shooting baskets, the player wearing brand X stops 
repeatedly to pump his shoes with everything from a bicycle pump to a big 
motorized air compressor. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the ASICS player wins. 
</P>
<P>
As the commercial ends, a voice says: "ASICS Gel-SpotLytes: The light shoe for 
pure basketball performance. Anything more is a lot of hot air." There is a 
hissing sound, then fade to black. 
</P>
<P>
The commercials will air on the NBC and Fox networks as well as several cable 
stations. The ads do not name Nike or Reebok but the comparison is implied, 
said Linda Nielander, an ASICS Tiger spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe we'll raise a lot of eyebrows and have a lot of people chuckling 
that a company like ASICS has the courage to take on the big competitors," 
Nielander said. 
</P>
<P>
ASICS Tiger, which had sales of $140 million last year, will spend $10 million 
in 1990 to market its basketball shoes in an effort to grab a bigger share of 
the market, Nielander said. She said that is just a fraction of what the larger 
companies are spending. 
</P>
<P>
Basketball shoes make up about $4.5 billion of the $7-billion athletic shoe 
market, said Angela Keith, a spokeswoman for ASICS Tiger. 
</P>
<P>
She said the ASICS Tiger commercial will piggyback on the big-budget ad 
campaigns of Nike and Reebok.

A LOOK AT INDIA'S BUMBLING BUREAUCRACY; 
</P>
<P>
NOVEL: CIVIL SERVICE OFFICIAL'S FIRST BOOK DESCRIBES THE LETHARGY AND 
INCOMPETENCE OF GOVERNMENT WORKERS IN INDIA AND HOW THE COUNTRY'S TOP STUDENTS 
ARE LURED INTO THE BUREAUCRATIC MAZE BY THE PAY AND BENEFITS.

<P>
Upamanyu Chatterjee, acclaimed novelist and listless civil servant, spends his 
working days in a sickly yellow room with pockmarked concrete walls, bamboo 
matting and a merciful cooling fan lodged in a far window. 
</P>
<P>
But at the moment, he is absent from his office. Chatterjee, like any Indian 
bureaucrat of his rank and slothful ingenuity, can avoid purposeful work for 
weeks on end. One method is simply to disappear for long stretches of the 
heat-soaked day, safe in the assumption that no one else in the government will 
notice. 
</P>
<P>
The fat woman who shares Chatterjee's office, the one-armed peon who enters to 
dump string-wrapped files into his "in" box, the limping maintenance worker who 
hauls a dripping hose to fill the cooling fan with water -- none can say where 
Chatterjee has disappeared to or when he may return. "After some time," they 
say. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty minutes pass in silence. Chatterjee's telephone rings. No one answers, 
and the ringing ceases. It rings again. Still no one moves. And again. The 
fifth time, the fat woman, a fellow civil servant, picks it up and shrieks. 
"No, I am not Mr. Chatterjee, nor am I his PA!" (PA means secretary.) "Kindly 
instruct Mr. Chatterjee to leave his PA in his room whenever he leaves his 
room, in a very responsible manner! Do you understand that?!!" She slams down 
the phone. 
</P>
<P>
It is an hour before Chatterjee, a slim 30-year-old man with hooded eyes and a 
remote air, slinks into the office and settles into the throne-like chair 
behind his desk. He offers coffee to the fat woman, but she politely refuses. 
Chatterjee scribbles a note and hands it unobtrusively to his visitor. "She's a 
nut," it reads. 
</P>
<P>
Upamanyu Chatterjee is in some ways the Jay McInerney of India -- a precocious, 
sarcastic writer catapulted to renown by a first novel that captures in the 
voice of its narrator the alienated bemusement of a young generation of 
educated, urban Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Like McInerney's "Bright Lights, Big City," which satirized the precious 
pretensions of the New Yorker magazine, Chatterjee's "English, August" 
bulldozed through a sacred temple of India's intellectual elite -- the Indian 
civil service, last refuge of the Brahmans, babus and glorified clerks who have 
governed the subcontinent since the days of the British Empire, and still the 
country's most important and influential public institution. 
</P>
<P>
An obvious difference is that while McInerney kissed and told after he left the 
New Yorker, where his name presumably is now mud, Chatterjee still works in the 
belly of the institution he satirized, currently as the Undersecretary for 
Establishment and General Administration in the Department of Culture in the 
Ministry of Human Resources of the Government of India. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to explain why his career as an elite civil servant has not 
been tarnished by a novel that describes many of his colleagues as overweight, 
lazy, confused and arbitrary drones who show up for work at 11, take lunch at 
noon, sleep until 4, then return to the office to sign a few papers and go home 
to drink, eat and play cards. 
</P>
<P>
But not only has Chatterjee escaped reprimand for his unflattering portrait of 
India's civil service, he has received a sort of promotion. About a year after 
the book was published in 1988, he was assigned to the Department of Culture, 
where the bureaucratic powers figured a budding novelist should be posted -- 
even if Chatterjee's duties irrelevantly involve supervising the vacation 
leaves and car loans and housing allowances of other bureaucrats in his 
department. 
</P>
<P>
"Some have read it, but not a lot," he says of his superiors' benign reaction 
to his novel. "There hasn't yet been a totally unfavorable review, but there 
have been some who felt the book was not fair in its entirety. Some others felt 
it was far too filthy, far too bawdy. But on the whole, the reactions have been 
favorable." 
</P>
<P>
The reason lies partly in the elliptic and stunningly tolerant culture of India 
-- Chatterjee calls it "the Hindu tradition" -- wherein dissent is not usually 
quashed or rejected, but rather absorbed, or ignored, or talked about until it 
becomes part of an ever-broadening consensus. 
</P>
<P>
So it is that "English, August," far from generating a storm of controversy 
within the Indian bureaucracy it describes, has been embraced as one of the 
bureaucracy's achievements. And Chatterjee, instead of assuming the angry 
stance of a writer exiled from the state, has settled rather nicely into his 
public career, wandering the hallways of his vast ministry by day, as he puts 
it, "finding out how many peons there are in the department and what they do," 
while scribbling a sarcastic sequel to his novel in his off hours. 
</P>
<P>
He has decided, he says, to remain in the civil service for good. He expects to 
be posted to Bombay next year, when he hopes his second novel will be 
published. Here again is the literary condition in India: There is no 
screenplay deal in the offing, despite the enthusiastic reviews of his novel in 
India's English-language press and in Britain. There can be no tenure track 
teaching creative writing to underclassmen; the system doesn't work that way. 
</P>
<P>
The uncomfortable truth, which Chatterjee appears to accept, is that an 
educated Brahman who has been fortunate enough to land at the top of the Indian 
social and governmental hierarchy simply doesn't leave. Writing novels may be a 
pastime, but the civil service is a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
Chatterjee has made the calculations already -- next year he will be 
transferred to the finance ministry, or the income tax department, or some 
other obscure corner of the Indian government's sprawling infrastructure. The 
civil service will provide him with a two- or three-bedroom apartment in 
Bombay's poshest waterfront neighborhood for just $18 a month in rent, and 
probably a car and driver too. Then there is the lifetime job guarantee, and 
the salary, and the immeasurable prestige of belonging to the civil service . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
"You come to that invisible quality. Maybe prestige is the wrong word, maybe 
it's a class-oriented word. But I can't think of a better one. It does make a 
difference if you tell people, even now, in a big city, if you tell them that 
you are in the service. It's difficult to pinpoint, but it's there. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to write all the time, but I've found out that I can't. 
Economically, because -- maybe the next book will get a bigger advance, but for 
this I didn't get much. And personally, because I can't write so much every 
day." He once considered abandoning the civil service, but now "there's no 
question of copping out. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel completely at home in the absurdities of India, " he says. "I like it 
here. . . . It's a soft life." 
</P>
<P>
"English, August" tells the semiautobiographical story of Agastya Sen, a 
talented if unenthusiastic university student who, like an estimated 100,000 
college graduates in India each year, takes the national civil service 
examination in the hope of securing one of 150 annual openings in the Indian 
Administrative Service, or IAS, successor to the vast public bureaucracy 
established by the British more than a century ago. Sen, who has spent all of 
his life in the partially Westernized, urban isolation of Calcutta and Delhi, 
wins one of the coveted spots and finds himself on a slow train to Madna, a 
tiny outpost in the backward countryside, where he is to be trained in the art 
of Indian public service. 
</P>
<P>
In Madna he finds "a small tube-lit station, stray dogs, a few coolies, a man 
selling rusks and tea, a family of beggars arguing in an unfamiliar tongue . . 
. cattle and clanging rickshaws on the road, and the rich sound of trucks in 
slush from an overflowing drain; he felt as though he was living someone else's 
life." 
</P>
<P>
He unpacks his bags in a one-room government guest house infested by mosquitoes 
and a noisy frog, attended by a poisonous cook and engulfed by airborne 
diseases. For the next nine months, Sen smokes a great deal of marijuana, 
masturbates joylessly and frequently, mooches liquor from a local political 
cartoonist, lies shamelessly about his past and manages to avoid learning 
anything useful about the practices of government and economic development in 
India, other than that the country appears ungovernable and that the 
bureaucracy seems largely purposeless. 
</P>
<P>
The novel is not exactly fast-paced, but its lethargy mirrors the rhythms of 
rural India, and Chatterjee's narrative voice -- brittle, scathing, juvenile, 
hilarious -- cuts through the fog around him like a cold wind. 
</P>
<P>
"He seemed to interrupt the second of the six (or so) tea breaks of the day. 
Life was a leisurely affair in Madna. Various aging fat men in the room, the 
denizens of the collectorate, shuffled at seeing him and sat down demurely. . . 
. Agastya felt happy to see such placid faces. He sat beside the supply 
officer, who smelt like a scented eraser out of a geometry box." 
</P>
<P>
Chatterjee says most of the letters he gets these days are from fellow members 
of the service who write in amiable tones that he has captured exactly their 
own experiences of serving in the Indian nether regions, where they felt 
utterly at sea in the great mass of poverty, illiteracy, filth and heat, which 
it was their job to manage and improve upon. 
</P>
<P>
What does it say about India that a story of drift, purposelessness, alienation 
and lethargy in the omnipresent government is welcomed as a portrait of 
unchangeable truth? 
</P>
<P>
Chatterjee himself isn't sure. He does not work for the government because he 
thinks he can change India or make it a better place, he says. He joined the 
civil service because everybody else he knew wanted to, because at Delhi 
University, "It's really like breathing: You take the exam." 
</P>
<P>
Like many English-speaking Indian intellectuals, and like Sen in his novel, 
Chatterjee lives somewhat uncomfortably between the inexorable pull of India 
and the enticements of the West. Chatterjee bristles when he talks about 
expatriate Indian writers whose work he partially admires -- Salman Rushdie, 
V.S. Naipaul -- because he thinks they don't belong to India at all; the India 
that they write about is an India of memory, not of experience. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Chatterjee, who has never left his native country, and who works near the 
heart of Indian society, feels like an outsider himself. The countryside where 
most Indians live remains alien -- it's a place, as Sen observes in the novel, 
"where floods and caste wars occurred, where entire families were murdered, 
where some prime minister took his helicopter just after a calamity, or just 
before the elections . . . a dot in this hinterland." 
</P>
<P>
These days Chatterjee is serious about a French woman whom he met in Delhi, and 
he is thinking about marrying her. This summer, he will travel to Britain to 
attend a writers seminar at Cambridge University. He wonders what he will think 
of Europe when he finally sees it. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never felt this urge to actually settle abroad or go abroad," he says. "I 
was told by this chap I know who's been to Yale -- he said it's a helluva shock 
if you come back. Then it's even madder." 
</P>
<P>
Chatterjee is back where he feels more or less at home: at his desk in the 
sickly yellow room. A problem has come before him, one of the half-scams of 
ordinary bureaucratic life, and Chatterjee is deeply amused. His tight and 
somewhat eerie smile seems to be suppressing boisterous laughter. 
</P>
<P>
An overweight civil servant with oiled hair and a stunning repertoire of 
meaningless facts about world geography has come to Chatterjee's office seeking 
money. Each year, it seems, the Undersecretary for Establishment and General 
Administration of the Department of Culture in the Ministry of Human Resources 
of the Government of India -- for the time being, that's Chatterjee -- is 
granted 150,000 rupees ($8,500) to dole out to fellow civil servants for 
automobile loans. This year, in one of the perquisites of the job, Chatterjee 
has reserved 52,000 rupees for himself to buy a new car. Three other 
bureaucrats, including the geography expert before him, have submitted 
applications for the rest. 
</P>
<P>
"He has come here to lobby," Chatterjee explains giddily, as if the supplicant 
were not even in the room. "He thinks he should get the full amount." 
</P>
<P>
The man hunches in his chair, evidently offended, but not so much so that he 
will let pass this opportunity to lobby. "It is not a question of lobbying. I 
know my 
</P>
<P>
position," he tells Chatterjee. His rival applicant, the man goes on, "will be 
going in for a car of maybe 20,000 or 30,000 rupees. My car is going to cost me 
110,000 rupees. I need the full amount." 
</P>
<P>
Chatterjee leans back, still suppressing laughter. They pay him well to gather 
material for his novels. He plays the scene to the end. He hems, he haws, he 
waffles. The other applicants will be offended if he gives the full amount to 
one person. What can he do? 
</P>
<P>
The man shifts uncomfortably, tries another approach, retreats, then finally 
asks Chatterjee to write an innocuous letter to his superior recording their 
conversation. Chatterjee agrees, then schedules another meeting. The drama will 
go on for months, slowly, purposelessly, to the music of whirring office fans. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether to give it to him or divide it among the three is something I could 
decide on my own, but I won't," Chatterjee explains later. "It's bound to 
create a lot of unpleasantness if I make the decision. So I will mark it up to 
the deputy secretary and let him decide. I think he will mark it up to the 
joint secretary. . . . There's no end to it." 
</P>
<P>
And where is the satisfaction, as opposed to the amusement, in all of this? 
Chatterjee talks about the variety of his work, the shifting from topic to 
topic and from post to post, the perks, the security. Sen, the protagonist of 
"English, August," finds the same regimen disgusting, even horrifying. But 
Chatterjee, well, he has grown into the job. He wrote his novel when the 
service was new and strange. Now he has been at least partially absorbed by it. 
</P>
<P>
"Sen's viewpoint has really wrongly been taken as mine. It's really the 
viewpoint of the outsider." 
</P>
<P>
An experienced civil servant wrote Chatterjee recently and told him that he 
could only have written "English, August" when he did, because if he had waited 
another three years -- say, until 1991 -- he would have become just like the 
overweight men who sit around Madna playing cards, drinking whiskey, swatting 
mosquitoes and managing the affairs of India without much effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
Chatterjee smiles as he describes the letter. "It's not a very nice thing to 
say about me," he says. "But I thought he was making a very valid point."

CHILDREN'S INN: NEW HELP FOR TINY PATIENTS;

MEDICINE: A LOW-COST HALFWAY HOUSE FOR MORE THAN 100 CHILDREN AND THEIR 
FAMILIES IS OPENING AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH IN BETHESDA, MD.

Tyler Small looks like any healthy 5-year-old kid. He has blond hair, an impish 
grin and an appetite for hot dogs. His 40-pound body is dressed in a Teenage 
Mutant Ninja Turtle shirt with matching socks and shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there is something unusual about him too. He adores broccoli topped with 
cheese for breakfast, lunch and dinner. (George Bush, take note.) And, from 
beneath his shirt protrude two thin plastic tubes that are tethered to an 
intravenous drip hung on a stand that accompanies his every move. 
</P>
<P>
Tyler Small has AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Born to an IV-drug-abusing prostitute, his illness was diagnosed 2 1/2 years 
ago. Since March, he and his adoptive mother, Cindy Small of Las Vegas, have 
been making biweekly visits lasting up to seven days to Bethesda, Md., where he 
is undergoing experimental drug treatment at the National Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
When Tyler is not required to be in the hospital, they stay at a modest motel 
nearby, as do other NIH families. NIH picks up the cost of travel and 
treatment, and allots them $65 per day for lodging. After the bill is paid, 
Cindy Small is left with a total of $9 a day for meals at the hospital 
cafeteria. Meanwhile, her husband Larry, a drugstore assistant manager, remains 
at home to care for their three other children, ages 10 to 13. 
</P>
<P>
The Smalls' world, and that of other families like them, is about to enlarge. 
On their next trip to Bethesda, Cindy and Tyler will be able to stay at 
Children's Inn, a $4.4-million home away from home for chronically ill children 
and their families that opens today on the NIH campus. For $10 per family per 
night (or for free if the family cannot afford that), the inn offers a private 
room and bath, plus two other important elements: the opportunity to share 
common experiences with other families and space enough for children to play. 
</P>
<P>
In this sort of halfway house, white coats and stethoscopes must be checked at 
the door. Here families can cook and care for, bathe and discipline their 
children, much as they would do at home. And, whereas one parent usually 
accompanies a sick child to the hospital, the space offered by Children's Inn 
will make it possible for other family members, including brothers and sisters, 
to be there too. At the same time they will have the help of other families in 
learning to deal with illnesses, prognoses, courses of treatment and the 
changes that these make in the family structure. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a recognition that it is important to treat physical illness in tandem 
with the emotional well-being of the child and the family," said Dr. Philip 
Pizzo, 45, chief of pediatrics and head of infectious diseases at the National 
Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Children's Inn is the newest and most elaborate facility of its kind. It is a 
36-bedroom, 1 1/2-story, 32,000-square-foot building on two sylvan acres. 
Substantial efforts were made to disguise its institutional character with 
homey touches. Thus the hotel-like bedrooms and the public rooms are decorated 
with original prints and crafts such as quilts and Shaker pieces. 
</P>
<P>
"It's gorgeous!" exclaimed Cindy Small as she toured the premises. For her it 
means the end of eating peanut butter and crackers in a hotel room, the end of 
stares by other motel guests. Best of all for the Smalls, it means a chance for 
the family to be there together. 
</P>
<P>
The concept of low- or no-fee communal housing for patients and families 
originated in 1972 in Buffalo, according to the National Assn. of Hospital 
Hospitality Houses. Kevin House was established by the parents of a 12-year-old 
leukemia victim. When they took their son for treatment, they noticed other 
parents sleeping in automobiles, existing only on sandwiches. After Kevin's 
death, his parents bought a $17,000 house in Buffalo and set up a nonprofit 
corporation to run it. 
</P>
<P>
Today, there are several hundred nonprofit patient-family residences in 
existence throughout the country. The best known of these are the Ronald 
McDonald Houses, which number 133 in the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Children's Inn was designed as a model facility. Advice was sought from other 
hospitality house directors, plus a multitude of professionals, including 
physicians, social workers, computer experts and safety specialists. Parents of 
sick children were also asked what features mattered most to them (The answers 
were: privacy and interaction with others). 
</P>
<P>
The heart of Children's Inn is the hearth, from which a round stone chimney 
eight feet in diameter rises to a skylighted cupola. 
</P>
<P>
The dual-level community room surrounding the gas fireplace is also its 
symbolic heart. It is here that sick children, parents, siblings and relatives 
are expected to gather to participate in one of the most important aspects of 
the house: emotional support through sharing of experiences, hopes and fears 
with one another. 
</P>
<P>
There are no required activities or counseling, no pets, no smoking, no alcohol 
and no private TV. 
</P>
<P>
Danielle Speller, a 9-year-old sporting a Simpsons T-shirt, grimaced when she 
learned no television sets were installed in the bedrooms; her father, Leroy 
Speller, cheered. "You watch too much TV anyway," he kidded her. The absence of 
bedroom sets is meant to encourage families to interact in the common rooms. 
However, bedrooms are cable-ready, and a number of portable TVs are available 
for patients too ill to get out of bed. 
</P>
<P>
Danielle, who has Cushing's disease, a metabolic disorder that stunts growth 
and causes obesity, has been traveling regularly from her New Jersey home to 
NIH since February. Physicians are "giving me pills to make me grow," she 
explains. Like other parents, Leroy Speller, who is employed in a General 
Motors parts factory, welcomes Children's Inn as an alternative to the motel 
that he finds too expensive and too far away. 
</P>
<P>
Too far away is not in the vocabulary of Cherie Harden, 17, of Farnham, 
England. Each month the teen-ager, who suffers from a rare metabolic disease 
called Niemann-Pick, and her mother, Norma Cockroft, must cross the Atlantic 
because there is no treatment available in Britain. Neighbors in their village 
hold charity cricket matches to pay for the flights. 
</P>
<P>
Cherie is on a cholesterol-free diet, which makes eating at a motel difficult. 
Norma Cockroft looks forward to cooking proper foods for her daughter at 
Children's Inn. Each of the inn's two kitchens contains a pair of stoves, 
microwave ovens, dishwashers, sinks, industrial-size ice machines in adjacent 
pantries and four refrigerators. Two refrigerators in each kitchen are reserved 
for patients' medicines. Only two families can cook at one time in a kitchen 
without crowding. "Mostly they'll be reheating meals in the microwave. We don't 
expect anyone to be doing a Thanksgiving turkey here," executive director 
Andrew Tartler said. 
</P>
<P>
The homelike atmosphere is enhanced by the absence of tile floors, fluorescent 
lights and hospital beds. But there are some special features. For example, 
there are two playrooms for small children: one is filled with sunlight; the 
other is shaded because chemotherapy makes skin sensitive to light. Play areas 
include seats for adults. The custom-made furniture had rounded edges to 
prevent injuries. Similarly, no glass tops cover tables. The carpet is not only 
soil resistant, but can be safely bleached to prevent infection. The ground 
floor contains large storage areas for bicycles and other playthings as well as 
wheelchairs and medical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
All bedrooms have private baths. Each of the four sleeping wings has a room 
that is accessible for the disabled and a laundry room. Other rooms include a 
library, a game room, a "quiet" room for meditation, and a computer room for 
children's links to schools programs and for games -- adults can use it too if 
they behave. Outside there are barbecues and basketball hoops plus sidewalks 
perfect for tricycle riding and plots ready for amateur gardeners. 
</P>
<P>
Each wing is decorated in a different color scheme -- blue-gray, peach, mauve 
and soft green -- with complementary floral draperies. Country pine sofas and 
chairs are covered with tapestry-type fabric or woven patterns in jewel tones. 
Depressing colors like brown, gray and black were avoided; hot pink was a 
no-no. 
</P>
<P>
"It reminds kids of the pills they have to take," explained interior designer 
Pamela Hughes. The bright primary kindergarten colors were eschewed because 
this is a facility for all ages. For the same reason, the artwork is not 
primarily childlike in nature. 
</P>
<P>
Watching workers put the finishing touches on the inn, Pizzo exclaimed, "This 
is a fantastic moment." 
</P>
<P>
The moment was a long time coming. Back in 1981, Pizzo began dreaming out loud 
about a temporary lodging for cancer patients and their families. He was 
getting nowhere fast in his efforts to buy a residence when a chance occurrence 
in 1986 became the catalyst that brought his dream to fruition. 
</P>
<P>
Carmala Walgren, wife of Rep. Douglas Walgren (D-Pa.), was visiting their 
teen-age baby-sitter, who was in NIH's clinical center after developing cancer. 
Talking with another patient's mother, the congressman's wife discovered that 
the federally funded hospital had cut off free long-distance phone service, the 
cherished lifeline between sick children and their relatives back home. Besides 
the cost, government auditors objected to patients using phones intended for 
federal employees making business calls. Walgren took the matter to then-House 
Speaker Jim Wright twice, and within six months the newly installed 
coin-operated phones were removed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Soon Walgren and two other congressional wives, Debbie Dingell, wife of Rep. 
John Dingell (D-Mich.), and Chris Downey, wife of Rep. Thomas Downey (D-N.Y.), 
formed the Friends of Children's Inn and became involved in the quest for an 
NIH patient-family lodging. The breakthrough came in 1987 when Merck &amp; Co., 
the pharmaceutical giant, agreed to fund construction of an inn on land donated 
by NIH. It helped that Merck's president, Pindaros Roy Vagelos, was a former 
NIH research scientist. 
</P>
<P>
Merck eventually contributed $3.7 million, the largest single gift it has ever 
made. Total corporate and private donations were in excess of $5 million, 
meaning there are sufficient funds to operate the facility for the next 18 
months, Thereafter about $350,000 must be raised annually to meet its operating 
budget. NIH will provide upkeep, utilities and janitorial services. A $500,000 
gift from the Children's Cancer Foundation is earmarked for an endowment. 
</P>
<P>
The facility is available to patients up to age 25 and their families for both 
short and long-term stays. The average stay is three to five days, but some 
patients remain from two to five months. Children's Inn can accommodate about 
109 people, if family members are tucked into two double beds and pull-out 
sofas in the bedrooms. Its capacity slightly exceeds the immediate housing 
needs of NIH's pediatric patients, but increased numbers of AIDS cases in the 
future are expected to fill any empty spaces. About half the children have 
cancer, the others having a variety of diseases or are undergoing transplants. 
</P>
<P>
The inn has a full-time administrative staff of four, supplemented by 
volunteers. While emergency assistance is available in acute cases, medical 
care is usually limited to that provided by the family, such as injections or 
bandage changes. Children's Inn is not a hospice. 
</P>
<P>
"That is not to say there are not acute deaths here," resident manager Kate 
Higgins said. "But our motto is hope." 
</P>
<P>
This is Children's Inn's commitment to Tyler, Danielle and Cherie and their 
families as well as the many others like them to follow. 
</P>
<P>
"I think of it not only as a place of comfort for patients of today, but as an 
insurance policy to allow research on these diseases to continue," its founding 
father said. "It creates the reality that NIH is committed to children."

WHEN GOOD CHILDREN DO BAD THINGS; 
</P>
<P>
PSYCHOLOGY: POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT OF DESIRABLE BEHAVIOR IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN 
SIMPLY PUNISHING UNDESIRABLE BEHAVIOR, SAYS AUTHOR PETER WILLIAMSON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY JO KOCHAKIAN, THE HARTFORD COURANT

<TEXT>
<P>
You can't ignore your kids when they're bad. But to have to pay attention to 
them while they're being good, too? Won't you ever get any peace? 
</P>
<P>
We are warned by the experts that if we pay attention to our children only when 
they are misbehaving, they have to misbehave. Negative attention is better than 
no attention. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to change. 
</P>
<P>
"We're so used to just getting on with the life of the family. When a child's 
behavior is appropriate, you can get on to other things -- do the wash, other 
chores," psychologist Peter Williamson says. "And when the kid steps out of 
line, then you pay attention to him." 
</P>
<P>
The strategy of positive attention really works, says Williamson, author of 
"Good Kids, Bad Behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Frequently, though, parents don't realize that it isn't going to show results 
quickly. "Parents often don't feel that immediate surge of success and think 
they aren't getting any. Then they lose confidence in themselves," Williamson 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Say you are trying to get your children to leave you alone while you talk to a 
neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
"You teach them something else to do -- have certain activities to do while 
you're busy," Williamson says. "They may do it for a little while, but pretty 
soon, they're going to say, 'OK, what happens if I go back and bug her?' 
</P>
<P>
"And that's not a bad thing. They're being little scientists. So two weeks 
after you're into a program, all the stops come out and they just hit you with 
everything. And parents will say it's not working. Well, that's not true. 
That's why it's real important for parents to be able to talk themselves 
through things and get through the rough spots." 
</P>
<P>
Positive attention is especially important to children who are not responsive 
to "the normal modes of discipline -- punishment or criticism," Williamson 
says. "It isn't a matter of just being nice or Pollyannaish about it. It's a 
matter of paying attention to the kinds of behavior you want the child to 
learn: 'I like what you did there,' 'You're handling yourself really well.' " 
</P>
<P>
Cheerleading won't work with some children. 
</P>
<P>
A thick-skinned, extroverted child, Williamson says, will respond with delight 
and pride to exclamations of "Great job! That was super!" But a more anxious, 
introverted child tends to shrink away from that kind of praise. 
</P>
<P>
"Positive attention for them is reinforcing their sense of self-confidence," he 
says. "It can be really low-key, even balanced with criticism: 'It wasn't 
perfect, but I really like the way you handled it.' " 
</P>
<P>
The timeout technique works nicely in this scheme, but it's often used 
incorrectly, says Williamson, who practices in Madison, Wis. A timeout (in 
which misbehavior is interrupted and the child is ordered to sit silently for a 
short time) has no deterrent value. But it allows parents to break the pattern 
of misbehavior and refocus the child's activity. 
</P>
<P>
"Say you're paying lots of attention to the kids while they're playing, and 
4-year-old Jamie goes over and knocks over Jack's block tower," Williamson 
says. "That's 10 seconds on the floor. He sits there; you do a silent count of 
10 and pay a lot of attention to Jack." 
</P>
<P>
When the timeout is over, you redirect Jamie, Williamson says: "Timeout's all 
done. Time to build blocks. OK, Jamie's coming over to see what he's going to 
do. He's going to make something. Look at that, he's got one, two, three, four 
-- can he get that one up there?" 
</P>
<P>
Redirecting is critical, he says, and especially important for preschoolers. 
"Don't leave dead space," he cautions. 
</P>
<P>
Or suppose a tired child, waiting for dinner, has a tantrum. Tell him to take 
two minutes to calm down, Williamson says. "It's not done as a punishment with 
a lot of anger. They go, settle themselves down, and it gives you a chance to 
go in there and tell them 'You did a nice job.' We don't pay attention to the 
fact they got mad; we pay attention to the fact they settled themselves down," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
Stick with it, says Williamson, and your view of the child's behavior will 
change. "You get used to relating to the child as someone who's evolving," he 
says, instead of seeing the child as good or bad, depending on his current 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
So be ready to praise your kids for simply doing the things they ought to be 
doing, Williamson advises. 
</P>
<P>
As your emphasis shifts away from the negative, he says, so will theirs, and 
you will be at (relative) peace.

SEN. HELMS-TYPE EDICT IS NO-NO, ACLU TELLS CITY; 
</P>
<P>
CENSORSHIP: COSTA MESA VICE MAYOR SAYS THE POLICY WILL NOT CONTAIN RESTRICTIONS 
ON ARTS CONTENT AND WILL APPLY TO ALL ORGANIZATIONS SEEKING MONEY FROM THE 
CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Members of the Costa Mesa City Council, who at their last meeting ordered the 
city attorney to draft new policies on awarding arts grants, were warned in a 
letter Thursday of "vigorous opposition" from the American Civil Liberties 
Union of Southern California if there is "any attempt to enact Helms-type 
language." 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU letter was prompted by broad content restrictions proposed by two 
Costa Mesa residents, John and Ernie Feeney, in a letter to Mayor Peter F. 
Buffa, which he passed to City Atty. Thomas Kathe as a possible model for new 
arts grant contract language. 
</P>
<P>
Vice Mayor Mary Hornbuckle said Thursday that she had not yet received the ACLU 
letter but that she understands the language being drafted will not include 
content restrictions and will be "rather generic" compared to that proposed by 
the Feeneys. 
</P>
<P>
In wording that mirrored language proposed by Sen. Jesse Helms for the National 
Endowment for the Arts, the Feeneys proposed this clause: "By accepting this 
grant, the recipient agrees to neither visually nor verbally, deliberately 
denigrate anyone's race, religion, color, national origin, ancestry, physical 
handicap, marital status, sex or age." The Helms proposal was rejected by 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the ACLU said the Feeney proposal "fails both the spirit and 
the law of the First Amendment." The language, the statement continued, "is 
vague and overbroad" and provides "no fair idea to either the artists or the 
government officials evaluating applications as to what art will be denied 
funding by the city." 
</P>
<P>
Hornbuckle said she has been told that the new contract language will require 
that organizations provide strict accounting showing that none of the money is 
used for political activity, a procedure that Hornbuckle said is widespread, 
but will not include content restrictions. Furthermore, the language would 
apply to all organizations that receive funds from the city, not just arts 
groups. The draft language could be put before the city at its meeting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The brouhaha started when the city, acting on a complaint by John Feeney, 
delayed distribution of $175,000 in cultural arts grants to investigate whether 
South Coast Repertory used any city funds in printing and distributing flyers 
supporting the NEA. Such an expenditure would have put the city in the position 
of endorsing a political activity, according to Buffa. 
</P>
<P>
The funds, including $30,000 for SCR, eventually were released when the theater 
company assured the city that no public money had been used for the flyer.

An unidentified armed robber dressed in a black ninja outfit held up a local 
pizza parlor that was about to close Thursday night, taking more than $200 
before disappearing, the Orange County Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
The robber, described as a male Caucasian, about 5 feet 10, escaped into a 
large apartment complex near the intersection of Alicia Parkway and Paseo de 
Valencia, sheriff's department spokesman Lt. Bob Rivas said today. 
</P>
<P>
Rivas said that the manager and a worker were about to lock up the Pizza Hut 
Restaurant on Alicia Parkway at 9:55 p.m. when the robber entered the store, 
pulled out a chrome-plated revolver and demanded cash. 
</P>
<P>
The robber then fled on foot into an apartment complex. Deputies called to the 
scene searched the apartment complex but were unable to find anyone who fit the 
description given by the store manager, Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
Rivas said that the department had not previously received any reports of 
anybody robbing a store or restaurant wearing a black ninja outfit.

The mayors of Moscow and Leningrad today joined populist Boris N. Yeltsin and 
leaders of the reform bloc of the Communist Party by quitting the party in the 
first split since the time of Lenin. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow Mayor Gavriil Popov and Leningrad Mayor Anatoly Sobchak issued a 
statement today saying they are quitting the party because of its inability to 
offer a realistic program for transition to a new society. 
</P>
<P>
"Recognizing all the responsibility before the people and history, we have 
taken a decision in the situation that arose to leave the Communist Party in 
order to help create a multi-party system," said their statement, released at 
the Moscow City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic events came as Mikhail S. Gorbachev was wrapping up a personally 
victorious 28th party congress with adoption of new party rules and the 
election of new members of the Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates today, the last day of the congress, voted by secret ballot on the 
approximately 420 nominees for the Central Committee. Gorbachev was scheduled 
to deliver a report on the congress after the votes were tallied.

<P>
High humidity and light winds helped 700 firefighters gain the upper hand on a 
fast-moving brush fire today that had raged out of control in the hilly 
countryside between Yorba Linda and the San Bernardino County line. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze, which charred more than 6,500 acres of tinder-dry sagebrush, grass 
and scrub oak in less than 24 hours, was accidentally sparked by a teen-ager 
who was playing with a model rocket at the border of the state park in Yorba 
Linda. 
</P>
<P>
It was expected to be fully contained by 6 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, the parents of the 15-year-old could be held responsible for 
paying the cost of fighting the fire, which was estimated to be more than $1 
million a day, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze broke out about 12:40 p.m. Thursday near Blue Gum and Rim Crest 
drives and raced toward the San Bernardino line. 
</P>
<P>
Fire crews from the U.S. Forestry Service, San Bernardino County, Brea, Santa 
Ana and Anaheim were called to assist the county Fire Department. Officials 
said the only structural damage occurred Thursday night when the blaze 
destroyed an unoccupied shack. 
</P>
<P>
Four inmate firefighters were injured overnight. Three suffered smoke 
inhalation as they labored to dig trenches along the perimeter of the fire. The 
fourth inmate broke his arm when he slipped about 75 feet into a deep ravine.

One man was fatally shot and another injured when a fight broke out among 
members of two gangs outside a Panorama City bar early today, Los Angeles 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said about 15 men were leaving Doohinkey's bar at 8929 Woodman Ave. 
about 2 a.m. when a fight broke out in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
An unidentified man pulled a gun and fired three or four shots. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Jefferson, 22, of South Los Angeles was struck in the head by a bullet 
and Derrick Potter, 20, also of South Los Angeles, was shot in the hip. 
Jefferson was fatally wounded, Lt. Warren Knowles said. Potter was being 
treated at an undisclosed hospital. 
</P>
<P>
No suspects were arrested in the shooting and the cause of the fight was 
unknown. Members of a gang from Pacoima and a gang from South Los Angeles had 
been in the bar but the groups had no history of being rivals, Knowles said. 
The gunman was believed to be a member of the Pacoima-based gang.

An extremist Islamic group today claimed responsibility for an explosion at a

</P>
<P>
Arco Chemical Co. of North America said from its headquarters in Newtown 
Square, Pa., that it has not heard of the claim and does not know whether it is 
valid. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the blast is under investigation, and no signs of sabotage at the 
plant have been reported. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Islamic Liberation Front told the Associated Press that the 
Arco plant in Channelview, Tex., was attacked because the United States 
supports Israel despite "its killings and terrorism against our Palestinian 
families" in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.

POLAND TO SELL STATE-OWNED INDUSTRIES;

Lawmakers voted today to sell off Poland's state-owned industries, a major step 
in the Solidarity-led government's 7-month-old radical reform program. 
</P>
<P>
More than 80% of the country's industry is government-owned, including steel 
mills, coal mines and factories. Government officials said no sectors of the 
economy would be off limits to privatization. 
</P>
<P>
The Sejm, or the lower house of Parliament, passed the legislation 328 to 2, 
with 39 abstentions. The vote came one day after the long-delayed measure 
reached the floor. 
</P>
<P>
The privatization measure still needs Senate approval, but with 99 of 100 
senators elected from the non-Communist Solidarity movement, it is not expected 
to have any difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
Companies in the best financial shape would be put on the auction block first. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is the most fundamental bill ever passed by the Polish 
Parliament, said Deputy Prime Minister Leszek Balcerowicz. "This is a 
foundation of the new economic system in Poland." 
</P>
<P>
Introducing the bills a day earlier, Balcerowicz told lawmakers that the 
ownership changes must come quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"Without a decisive change in the ownership of the economy, further progress of 
the reforms is not possible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Poland, whose Communist regime was replaced by the Solidarity government of 
Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki last August, embarked in January on a radical 
economic reform program. The first goal was to stabilize runaway inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The program whittled inflation down to 3.4% in June, compared to 600% to 1,000% 
inflation in 1989. But the social cost has been high -- real incomes have 
dropped 30%. 
</P>
<P>
The privatization measure bogged down for some time because of disputes over 
how to proceed. Many people feared that foreign investors or the former 
Communist elite would be the only ones with the capital to buy state property. 
But the government promised that "privatization coupons," which can be used 
toward purchase of state-owned property, will be issued to all citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"In this way, the idea of citizens' stock ownership will be put into practice," 
Balcerowicz said.

QUAYLE SAYS HE WON'T APOLOGIZE FOR GUARD SERVICE

Vice President Dan Quayle told families of missing servicemen today that he'll 
never apologize for his Vietnam-era service in the National Guard, but that 
those who fought made a "far, far greater" sacrifice than he. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle noted his National Guard service, which became an issue in the 1988 
presidential campaign, in a speech opening the 21st annual meeting of the 
3,650-member National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in 
Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
"As you know, during the Vietnam era, I served in the Indiana National Guard," 
he said. "And while I have not apologized, and never will, for my National 
Guard service, I recognize that the members of my generation who served in 
Vietnam made a sacrifice for their country that was far, far greater than mine. 
</P>
<P>
"The men and women who served in Vietnam were heroes -- not just because of 
their deeds of valor -- but because they served at a time when words like duty, 
honor and country had lost their meaning for many," Quayle said. "For the rest 
of my life, I will live in admiration of their courage." 
</P>
<P>
As George Bush's running mate, Quayle was dogged by accusations that he avoided 
combat duty by joining the National Guard. 
</P>
<P>
The issue surfaced again May 9 when some members of the American Legion of 
Paris boycotted a ceremony at which Quayle spoke.

Former Rep. Thomas Ashley (D-Ohio), a longtime friend of President Bush, 
confirmed today that he's been giving advice to Neil Bush since last winter on 
the controversy surrounding the President's son's role in the collapse of a 
Denver savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
But Ashley, a banking lobbyist, denied that the President had asked him to 
contact his son. 
</P>
<P>
"That is absolutely inaccurate," Ashley said in an interview. "I'm too smart to 
do that." 
</P>
<P>
The Denver Post reported in today's editions that Ashley, a college classmate 
of George Bush from Yale, had talked to the younger Bush at the President's 
behest before Neil Bush was questioned by federal banking regulators. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper attributed the report to comments by Neil Bush himself, contained 
in a deposition taken by the Office of Thrift Supervision. 
</P>
<P>
"If Neil thinks his father called me, he's mistaken," Ashley said.

Two million older sheep will be killed in controlled shootings around the 
country to thin out the country's sheep population estimated at a record 175 
million head, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers said they will begin the mass shootings as early as next week because 
many old ewes, held over when wool prices were higher, are now being sold for 
as little as 10 cents each. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sad, but some of the sheep aren't worth as much as a bullet," said one 
farmer. Earth movers will likely be used to dig trenches to bury the sheep, 
other farmers said.

Hungary has been informed it will suffer a 30% reduction in Soviet crude oil 
deliveries and will have to look for other suppliers to fend off fuel 
shortages, a government spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Balazs Laszlo told a press conference a Hungarian negotiating party, 
which went to Moscow to try to persuade the Soviets to adhere to the current 
Soviet-Hungarian trade agreement, had been informed of the cuts Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiating team had gone to Moscow after Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai 
Ryzhkov announced a 7 million ton -- or 5% -- cut in Soviet oil exports 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
Laszlo said the Soviet cuts came in the wake of "the gradual depletion the 
established oil fields in the Soviet Union." He added, "The Soviet economy

Production cutbacks by two OPEC members should restore oil prices to the 
$18-a-barrel benchmark within days, Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aghazadeh 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the end of a two-day visit to the United Arab 
Emirates, he said production cuts by the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait will 
drive the prices up before the next OPEC meeting in Geneva on July 25. 
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Iran will request that the benchmark price be increased by $2 a 
barrel to $20, the minister said. 
</P>
<P>
Aghazadeh's remarks reflect confidence that OPEC members would refrain from 
pumping too much oil, which depresses prices. Oil produced by members of the 
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was selling recently for $14 a 
barrel. 
</P>
<P>
News of the planned production cutbacks surfaced in Saudi Arabia Thursday 
night. Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazir described the moves as a 
"historic crossroads" for the 13-member cartel. 
</P>
<P>
He said the decisions followed high-level contacts between King Fahd and U.A.E. 
President Sheik Zayed ibn Sultan al Nuhayan.

Bart Simpson, the television cartoon character whose image can be found on 
everything from coffee mugs to T-shirts, is turning up on stamps of the 
psychedelic drug LSD. 
</P>
<P>
Bart's smirking face has appeared on blotter acid, LSD-laced stamps that are

</P>
<P>
Michael Borcsok, 21, of Albany was charged Tuesday with possession of 261 
"hits" of hallucinogenic Bart Simpson stamps, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Another batch of the stamps surfaced last week in Pittsfield, Mass., about 40 
miles east of Albany, police there said. 
</P>
<P>
"These stamps are very obviously aimed at young children. Kids love Bart 
Simpson," said Steve Dnistrian, a spokesman for Phoenix House, a New York drug 
rehabilitation center. 
</P>
<P>
Cartoon characters such as Mickey Mouse and Goofy have been placed on blotter 
acid sheets since the 1960s, when the illegal drug became widely sold.

"Saturday Night Live" cast member Jon Lovitz has decided to find out whether

Lovitz, known for his character the pathological liar who says "That's the

"I've done the show for five years. That's enough," he said. "I've had a great

<P>
"I've got several offers to do movies and that's the direction I'm headed," he

Lovitz, 32, has finished "Mr. Destiny," a movie for Disney, and is working on 
"Mom and Dad Save the World" for Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
On "Saturday Night Live," his recurring comedic bits included an impression of 
playwright Harvey Fierstein as an affection-starved talk show host, and as 
himself, jovially urging viewers, "Get to know me!"

hotel exterior wall that shows a nude couple from the back gazing into each 
other's eyes on a deserted beach. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Sal Oliveri and City Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Koslow visited the owner of the Sunray Lodge Motel on Thursday to suggest 
that swimsuits be painted on the two naked lovers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just out of place. We don't want to start a style or trend of nude 
pictures on buildings," Oliveri said. 
</P>
<P>
The artist, Steven Kroeger of Lauderdale Lakes, was flabbergasted. 
</P>
<P>
"Would they have put bathing suits on a Rubens? I can't figure it out," he 
said. "Maybe they take showers in Hollywood with their clothes on. It's kind of 
weird." 
</P>
<P>
Koslow also said the artist should add children to the scene. "It should be 
family-oriented with children playing on the beach. It's a beach scene," he 
said of the 18-by-24-foot mural. 
</P>
<P>
Motel owner Doris Ouellet said she will cooperate and will talk to the artist 
about adding swimwear or shading. But she said she does not understand why the 
city is making the fuss. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, this is a storm in a glass of water," she said. "This represents Adam 
and Eve in paradise. In paradise, Adam and Eve didn't have children. And they 
didn't wear bikinis, either."

RINGWALD HOPING TO GET CAREER BACK ON TRACK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Molly Ringwald, 22, finds herself in a supporting role for the first time in 
years in "Betsy's Wedding." 
</P>
<P>
It's an important distinction at this point in her career because she is a Star 
with a capital S. 
</P>
<P>
But her recent films suggest she has been the victim of poor advice and 
victimized by less than inspired choices of scripts, directors and co-stars. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, she had been one of Hollywood's hottest young acting talents, 
brilliant in a trio of John Hughes films, "Sixteen Candles," "Pretty in Pink" 
and "The Breakfast Club," stunning in her revelations of the minds and hearts 
of adolescent females. 
</P>
<P>
The pert and poignant redhead, who has lost her innocence on screen more often 
than any star since Mary Pickford, marches to the altar in her current movie, 
"Betsy's Wedding," a fact that brings a smile to her freckled face. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Ringwald has managed to escape the coming-of-age or rite-of-passage 
film in which a post-pubescent girl enters adulthood with all the ramifications 
such transitions imply, at least in movies. 
</P>
<P>
An accomplished actress who looks and photographs a half-dozen years younger 
than she is -- which makes a big difference when a woman is 22 -- Ringwald 
chose to abandon her familiar metier. 
</P>
<P>
And why not? She's an adult, even though she still looks like a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
Ringwald made her first movie at 13 in "Tempest," a comedy based on 
Shakespeare's play. She was astonishingly good, winning a Golden Globe Award 
for best new actress. 
</P>
<P>
She had an equal impact in the TV movie "Surviving," dealing with teen-age 
suicide. And her reviews in the Hughes films were glowing. 
</P>
<P>
But Ringwald felt it was time to move on. 
</P>
<P>
Her recent films, however, have been less than successful at the box-office. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pick-up Artist" with Robert Downey Jr. was a disappointment, both to its 
producers and the young actress. "For Keeps," in which she played a pregnant 
teen-ager, failed to thrill anyone. "Fresh Horses," co-starring Andrew 
McCarthy, was a rehash of "Pretty in Pink" and never got out of the barn. 
</P>
<P>
She flew to France to co-star with Robert Lindsay and John Gielgud in the 
British film "Strike it Rich," which didn't. 
</P>
<P>
She tried new directions, playing Cordelia in Jean-Luc Godard's stage 
presentation of "King Lear" and in the New York stage production of Horton 
Foote's "Lily Dale." 
</P>
<P>
In "Betsy's Wedding," Ringwald is back on familiar terrain, playing a girl 
whose wedding touches off a series of family crises. She plays an off-beat 
bride in the comedy directed by Alan Alda, who also portrays her father. 
</P>
<P>
Ringwald plays the title role, but she is not the star. Alda is. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose I've come full circle," Ringwald said in an interview. "I did this 
picture because I wanted to work with Alan Alda. I liked the script. It made me 
laugh. I liked the prospect of doing an ensemble film again. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept telling myself my family would never be like this, getting upset over 
such silly things. I wouldn't let my family control me like the parents do in 
the movie. 
</P>
<P>
"Then my sister Elizabeth decided on a formal wedding and in essence we're 
doing this movie. It's amazing what problems a family gets into over a wedding. 
There's something about the tradition and the ceremony that makes people crazy. 
You argue about everything -- invitations, music, refreshments, the church, 
clothes, the reception." 
</P>
<P>
Ringwald, who began her career singing with her father's Great Pacific Jazz 
Band when she was 4, is a thoughtful young woman who has no matrimonial plans 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
Her first priority is her career. 
</P>
<P>
"Marriage is a long way off for me," she said, "but you never know. I think 
I'll have a small wedding with just family and a few friends. 
</P>
<P>
"Times have changed from my mother's generation. They got married early, 
sometimes right out of high school. Mom married when she was 19. 
</P>
<P>
"I've changed so much in the past five years -- I'm practically a different 
person every year. It would be a huge risk for me to marry now. I won't be the 
same person in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Today a lot of women my age don't want to make marriage their career. It's a 
hard balancing act to have children and an acting career. But it's possible. 
Women are doing it every day. Compromises have to be made.

Makeup artist Frances (Frannie) Arvold, who powdered the noses of TV 
celebrities from Edward R. Murrow and Ed Sullivan to Walter Cronkite and Dan 
Rather during 40 years at CBS, has retired. 
</P>
<P>
The network announced Arvold's retirement Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Richard M. Nixon's refusal to let Arvold make him up during his 1960 debate 
with John F. Kennedy -- the first televised presidential debate -- may have 
cost him the election, some historians have said. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon, looking haggard next to the youthful Kennedy, lost the debate in the 
eyes of those who watched it on television but won it among those who listened 
on radio, polls at the time showed. 
</P>
<P>
"Don Hewitt, who directed the debates, told Nixon several years later that had 
he only allowed Frannie to apply some pancake to his 5 o'clock shadow, she may 
have changed the course of history," CBS spokeswoman Donna Dees said.

Town Councilman Charles (Bill) Hansen found water for the new town hall the 
old-fashioned way. 
</P>
<P>
He dowsed it. 
</P>
<P>
Drillers from a local well company came up dry after drilling a 300-foot hole 
for the combination town hall and highway garage on a 28-acre parcel, the 
Schenectady Daily Gazette reported. 
</P>
<P>
Finding water on the parcel will tell builders where to place the building. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen took his forked oak rod and checked the lot himself, marking off a spot 
for the well driller. Within 150 feet, the well company hit a 20-gallon-per 
minute spring. 
</P>
<P>
Divining rods, when held by the two prongs, supposedly twitch over the spot 
where water runs underground.

FEATHERS FLY WHEN MASCOT ANGERS THE MANAGER'S WIFE

<P>
Former major league infielder Dave Cash has been transferred from his job as 
manager of the minor league Batavia Clippers after a dispute between his wife 
and Chipper the Clipper, the team's mascot. 
</P>
<P>
Cash, a former All-Star second baseman, was reassigned by the Philadelphia 
Phillies to his previous position as roving minor-league infield instructor. He 
will be replaced as manager of the New York-Penn League team by Ramon Aviles, a 
coach with the Phillies' Double A team in Reading, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
Cash's wife, Pamela, said she had encountered numerous problems at the ballpark 
since her husband took over as manager less than a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, during a game with the Oneonta Yankees, Pamela Cash said 
Chipper the Clipper blocked her view of the field during a Batavia home run. 
</P>
<P>
She said she asked the blue-feathered, yellow-beaked mascot to move, then 
tapped him on the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"He shook his behind in my face in front of my two young children. I thought 
that kind of behavior by a mascot at what's supposed to be a family-oriented 
place was totally uncalled for," she said. "This wasn't the first time he shook 
his butt in my face." 
</P>
<P>
Pamela Cash said she then got into a fight about the incident with the team's 
assistant manager. 
</P>
<P>
Team officials would not reveal the mascot's identity. 
</P>
<P>
"The mascot is there to entertain people, not offend them," said Dwight 
Thornton, a member of the team's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
"You should see him. He's like Big Bird on 'Sesame Street.' It's unfortunate 
that the only person he offended all year was the manager's wife." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Cash said the Monday night incident was "the culmination of many things. 
</P>
<P>
"From my perspective, we experienced a lot of rudeness," he said. "It's best 
that we no longer are in this situation."

The Naval Academy hopes to add 48 luxury sky-boxes to 32-year-old Navy-Marine 
Corps Memorial Stadium by the start of the 1991 football season, according to 
Athletic Director Jack Lengyel. 
</P>
<P>
The Naval Academy Athletic Assn. -- the privately funded organization that 
operates the Navy sports program -- signed an agreement Thursday with 
University Partners to market the boxes and a new club-level seating area. 
Construction will begin after the 1990 season if commitments have been received 
for 80% of the new seats. 
</P>
<P>
Navy, which has not had a winning season since 1982, wanted a revamped stadium 
to go with its revamped schedule for the 1990s. The Midshipmen have 
discontinued longstanding series with Eastern powers Syracuse and Pittsburgh, 
and will play only two home games this fall against Division I-A teams -- 
Boston College and Akron.

Minnesota Vikings strong safety Joey Browner has signed three one-year 
contracts averaging more than $900,000 a year, according to a published report 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Vikings General Manager Mike Lynn confirmed that Browner has signed, but he 
would not disclose contract terms. 
</P>
<P>
The Star Tribune, quoting an unidentified source, said Browner signed for 
$850,000 for 1990, $850,000 for 1991 and $1 million for 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The contract also includes a signing bonus but the amount was not known, the 
newspaper said. The contract would make Browner, who has played in the last 
five Pro Bowls, the highest-paid safety in the NFL, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
Browner had been upset for two years about his old contract, which paid him 
$350,000 last season. He tried to renegotiate last summer and repeatedly 
requested a trade.

Bruce Pilkenton, the leading quarter horse rider at Los Alamitos this summer, 
was handed a five-day suspension Thursday night by the track stewards. 
</P>
<P>
Citing Pilkenton for "crossing over without sufficient clearance" while riding 
Streakin Rampage in Wednesday night's 10th race, officials gave Pilkenton a 
5-day suspension to be served July 17 through July 21. 
</P>

As of July 8, Pilkenton held an eight-win advantage of former riding champion 
Kip Didericksen with 75 winning mounts compared to Didericksen's 67.

Dash For Speed, the mare who narrowly missed two World Champion titles, sets 
her sights on the elusive prize again this year opening her 1990 campaign in

<P>
The Anne Burnett, among the top Grade I events in the nation for fillies and 
mares, brings out a field of 10 3-year-old and older fillies and mares facing 
off down on Los Al's 400-yard straightaway. 
</P>
<P>
Dash For Speed makes her first appearance in the starting gate since finishing 
third in the Breeders Championship Classic at Sunland Park last October. That 
race was her single loss in the 4-year-old ranks after winning eight straight 
races at Ruidoso Downs including the All American Gold Cup, World's 
Championship Quarter Horse Classic and the Rainbow Silver Cup.

The field for Sunday's Anne Burnett Handicap from the rail out includes: Passem 
Dirty (Bruce Pilkenton, 122), Dash For Speed (Kip Didericksen, 124), Barbs 
Bounce (Steve Treasure, 122), Winning Guarantee (Carlos Arias, 120), Wicked 
Dash (James Lackey, 122), The Dream Date (Henry Garcia, 120), Lil Bit Rusty

MOVIES: A SUSPENSE DRAMA ABOUT THE AFTERLIFE IS THE LAST FILM YOU'D EXPECT FROM 
JERRY ZUCKER, ONE OF THE CRAZY GUYS WHO DREAMED UP 'AIRPLANE!'

The sign on the door indicates that Zucker Brothers Productions shares its West 
Los Angeles office suite with a dentist named Millard E. Flausner. A telephone 
about four times normal size sits in the conference room. The walls are 
dominated by posters for the goofy, anarchic comedies written and directed by 
Jerry and David Zucker and Jim Abrahams -- movies like "Airplane!" and "Top 
Secret!" 
</P>
<P>
So why is Jerry Zucker, at 40 the youngest member of a team whose comedy style 
some have compared to the Marx Brothers, participating in an interview that 
explores such issues as spirituality and metaphysics? 
</P>
<P>
Because "Ghost," the first movie Zucker has made by himself, is a suspense 
drama about the afterlife. In other words, it's the last film you'd expect from 
one of the crazy guys who dreamed up "Airplane!" 
</P>
<P>
Both Paramount Pictures, which releases "Ghost" today, and the filmmaker are 
understandably concerned that moviegoers are anticipating something closer to 
"Ghostbusters." 
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible to categorize the movie," Zucker said. "It doesn't fit into 
any specific, familiar genre. I think of it as a romance and a drama with 
comedy and suspense. At its heart, though, the movie is not a comedy." 
</P>
<P>
Zucker insists that he wasn't deliberately trying to break with his comedic 
past or "to express a different side of myself. I was just looking for a good 
film to direct." 
</P>
<P>
What he came across was Bruce Joel Rubin's script for "Ghost," which, like 
Rubin's other screenplays -- "Brainstorm" and the upcoming "Jacob's Ladder" -- 
examines worlds beyond the physical realm. 
</P>
<P>
In the film, Patrick Swayze plays a New York banker who is killed by a mugger 
but remains on Earth as a ghost. Watching over his grieving lover, Demi Moore, 
he soon realizes she is in mortal danger. In desperation, he manages to 
communicate with her through Whoopi Goldberg, a fake psychic who is astounded 
to discover that her powers are real. 
</P>
<P>
"What I loved about the script, right from the beginning, was that it was 
written by someone who really believes in the spiritual world and takes these 
issues seriously," Zucker said. "Bruce didn't wake up one day and say, 'I have 
a nifty idea for a commercial movie.' The script was written from his heart." 
</P>
<P>
But first Zucker had to persuade the distraught screenwriter of his good 
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted Milos Forman or Stanley Kubrick (to direct the movie)," Rubin said. 
"When I was told that the guy who made 'Airplane!' was going to direct 'Ghost,' 
I cried. Then when I met him, he said he wanted to make changes in the script. 
He wanted to change my baby. It was very distressing." 
</P>
<P>
The two agreed to go to dinner together. The only rule was that neither would 
discuss the script. By evening's end, Rubin said, "I fell in love with the guy. 
He's warm, funny and deeply philosophical. You would never expect that, from 
his comedies." 
</P>
<P>
The two went through 19 drafts of the screenplay together. Everyone agrees the 
original script was much darker. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt it needed more twists and turns," Zucker said. "It needed to keep 
moving. All those zany comedies have instilled a sense of pace in me. And, yes, 
I added more humor. Actually, a lot of the work I did was take things in 
Bruce's head, which weren't clear in the script, and help translate that into 
something a mainstream audience could grasp and digest. 
</P>
<P>
"People keep asking if I believe in ghosts," Zucker added. "If you're talking 
about poltergeists and weird, supernatural phenomena, not really. I have no 
idea what's possible in that realm. But if you are asking if I believe all of 
us have souls that exist with the physical self, the answer is yes. And I 
believe the soul does continue on after the body dies." 
</P>
<P>
To Goldberg, Zucker "had such a definite vision of what he wanted to do, we 
were a couple of weeks into filming before I discovered he hadn't (directed) on 
his own before." 
</P>
<P>
Where Zucker did need help, Goldberg said, was in his transition from directing 
comedy to directing something entirely different. 
</P>
<P>
"Making the movie was a learning experience for him. We weren't in a gag film 
like 'Airplane!' with sight gags and double-entendres. We had to teach him a 
bit more about actors doing characters and playing motivations. Lucky for us, 
Jerry was very naive and therefore very open. . . . What I mean by naive is he 
loves movies the way Spielberg does and wants to make great movies. So he 
allowed us to have our tense moments without it being personal. If something 
got the actors uptight, he'd really listen." 
</P>
<P>
The shoot was difficult, since special effects had to be blended with scenes 
that had both dramatic and comedic elements. Howard W. Koch, under whose 
production banner the film was made, observed, "Jerry didn't walk away from any 
scene until he got what he wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Koch, who produced "Airplane!" 11 years ago, said that it was Zucker who 
usually worked with the actors during the making of that movie. The other two 
directors would huddle around a monitor in the back of the airplane mock-up, 
communicating with him over headphones. 
</P>
<P>
But the days of triumvirate direction ended after "Ruthless People." "It's hard 
enough to find a film one wants to do, much less three," Zucker said. 
</P>
<P>
When the Zucker brothers and Abrahams opened the Kentucky Fried Theater in an 
abandoned warehouse on Pico Boulevard in 1972, they were among the first comedy 
groups to shun political commentary for media satire. Their troupe, which mixed 
live skits with videotaped and film sketches, mocked the dramatic and 
commercial excesses of film and TV. 
</P>
<P>
This continued on into their movies, first "Kentucky Fried Movie," a collection 
of short parodies of movie trailers directed by John Landis, then "Airplane!," 
a spoof of airport-disaster movies. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a style of humor we spent years and years developing," Zucker said. "So 
by the time we got on a set, it was only a matter of solving problems and not 
arguing about how the production would look or the style of the humor. For 
first-time directors, it helped to have more than one head." 
</P>
<P>
Then came "Ruthless People," a film the trio directed from a script by Dale 
Launer. The film's different style made it difficult for the three to work 
together. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not hell, exactly," Zucker said, "but it became evident that if we were 
going to do (scripts written by other people), we'd have to direct separately." 
</P>
<P>
Abrahams made his solo debut with "Big Business," starring Bette Midler and 
Lily Tomlin. Then David Zucker directed "The Naked Gun," a movie derived from 
the team's 1982 television series, "Police Squad!" Abrahams is now developing 
projects at his Abrahams Entertainment Corp., while the Zuckers have about 10 
projects going at their production company, including "Naked Gun 2 1/2," a 
sequel the brothers are creating with Abrahams and writer Pat Proft. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jerry Zucker nervously awaits reaction to a film that may well 
confound audience expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"The movie is a roller-coaster ride where weird and funny things happen. But it 
would be great if we got people to see their lives in a new context, like maybe 
considering if they have a soul or if there is a spiritual world."

3 BUSINESS WOMEN ON PATH TO SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE KRENSAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Women are starting small businesses at twice the rate of men. If they maintain 
that pace, women will own nearly 40% of small businesses by the year 2000, 
according to the Small Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a trend that's going to continue for a number of reasons," said Kris 
Morris, a partner with the executive search firm Cowen, Morris, Berger. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris and other observers attribute the growth to a contraction of middle 
management and expansion of the number of women entering the work force. 
</P>
<P>
 Female entrepreneurs are taking the spotlight in Los Angeles this week as the 
National Assn. of Women Business Owners holds a conference on business 
ownership through Sunday at the Century Plaza Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are profiles of three such women, who have taken widely different paths 
to success. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Patty DeDominic 
</P>
<P>
Successful entrepreneurs often proclaim prosperity with a Malibu beach house, a 
yacht or a mountain cabin. 
</P>
<P>
 Patty DeDominic hired her former boss. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of PDQ Personnel Services, a Los Angeles agency with six offices and 
projected revenue this year of $15 million, DeDominic considers having her 
former supervisor on the payroll among the most meaningful symbols of PDQ's 
success -- along with her Mercedes convertible and two staff MBAs. 
</P>
<P>
The former boss, Ron Owens, is a PDQ vice president who introduced DeDominic to 
the temporary help business in 1972 when he hired her to work in an agency's 
Sherman Oaks office. 
</P>
<P>
She quit the agency in 1975 for a job with Avon Products Inc., eventually 
becoming a district manager. 
</P>
<P>
"I had outgrown the businesses I had been working for," said DeDominic, who 
quit Avon in 1979 and started PDQ with $2,000 and visions of escaping the 
frustrations of middle management. "I had a gnawing desire to be more free." 
</P>
<P>
Forfeiting regular paychecks -- with a company car, expense account and 
first-class airline tickets -- proved a rewarding sacrifice. Today, DeDominic 
manages a company with about 900 employees, including a full-time staff of 45. 
She oversees the business from a 5,000-square-foot office occupying half the 
fourth floor of the Mutual Benefit Life building on Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
To survive the difficult times, DeDominic advises aspiring entrepreneurs to 
write a business plan, hone communication skills and turn to experts for help. 
"You don't have to have all the answers to be successful. You just have to be 
aware you don't have them and get them from experts," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Betty Robertson 
</P>
<P>
As a Hughes Aircraft engineer, Betty Robertson admired the XIT Grounding 
System, a device Hughes installed to protect equipment from electrical 
disturbances such as lightning and power surges. 
</P>
<P>
So when she learned in 1985 that XIT's owners planned to sell out, she took out 
a $50,000 mortgage on her home, borrowed $100,000 from her brother-in-law and 
bought the company. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so simple and uncomplicated, but it does the job perfectly," Robertson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Through the company she created, Lyncole XIT Grounding, Robertson sells the 
$550 system to customers wanting to protect people and expensive electronics 
such as telephone switches and radio transmitters. 
</P>
<P>
The device is a perforated copper tube, two inches in diameter and 10 feet 
long, installed in the ground and filled with salt that reacts with water to 
create a solution that conducts electricity. The liquid seeps down the tube, 
forming an electrical path through which surges can dissipate into the earth. 
Lyncole bills the system as more stable and reliable than the conventional 
driven rod. 
</P>
<P>
Since she quit her job at Hughes to start the company, Robertson has nurtured 
the company from $150,000 in sales in 1986 to $1.2 million last year. With 15 
employees making the devices in an 8,000-square-foot plant in Torrance, Lyncole 
hopes to reach $1.8 million this year and $10 million within five years. 
</P>
<P>
She admits the growth of XIT was rocky, forcing her to develop management 
skills she never polished as an engineer. 
</P>
<P>
Her advice to would-be entrepreneurs: "You have to plan on working twice as 
hard as you can imagine possible, then work some more." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nancy Peterson 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Peterson's training for running a tool company with 90 employees and 
national sales included washing, ironing and carting six children to football 
and swimming practices. 
</P>
<P>
When her husband, John, died of cancer in 1979, she was thrust into his duties 
as chief executive of Nashville, Tenn.-based Peterson Tool Co., a maker of 
tools used in machines that shape metal. She found herself applying the skills 
she learned raising a family to running a growing company. 
</P>
<P>
"When you managed a household for eight, there was a budget to balance and 
people to deal with constantly. There were teachers and doctors," she said. "I 
was really continuing on. Only my budget became larger." 
</P>
<P>
Although the move into the chief executive's office was a stark change, she had 
begun working at the company five years earlier, starting as a fill-in for a 
secretary on maternity leave and moving up from there. 
</P>
<P>
The mainstay of Peterson's business are its ThriftEdge tools, which have 
replaceable blades. John, who started the company in 1958 in the back of a 
barn, developed ThriftEdge, but Nancy polished the design and patented it. 
</P>
<P>
When her husband learned of his illness just months before his death, he told 
her she was going to take over the business. 
</P>
<P>
"He was so confident that I could do it that I didn't know any better. I didn't 
know I couldn't," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson jumped into her new position, returning to work a week after John 
died. 
</P>
<P>
"I was standing at the funeral, and I looked over at all the employees and I 
thought, 'Oh, God.' That's when I felt the heavy responsibility and couldn't 
show I was weak," she said. "I didn't have time to feel sorry for me. These 
employees and their families were relying on me. There were a lot of mouths to 
feed. Everybody was looking to me." 
</P>
<P>
Since she took over Peterson, revenue has quadrupled, she said. Employment has 
also tripled, and the company has moved to a building three times the 
original's size.

HE ISN'T WORKING AT SANTA ANITA NOW, BUT JIMMY KILROE'S PRESENCE STILL FELT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few years ago, Frank (Jimmy) Kilroe was asked for his opinion on dosage, that 
arcane analysis of bloodlines that is supposed to be an indicator of how the 
Kentucky Derby will turn out. 
</P>
<P>
"Figures lie and liars figure," Kilroe said. 
</P>
<P>
When Leon Rasmussen, then the bloodlines columnist for the Daily Racing Form 
and one of the foremost exponents of dosage, heard about Kilroe's succinct 
appraisal, he was crestfallen. 
</P>
<P>
"Did Jimmy really say that?" said Rasmussen, who appeared to be on the verge of 
tears. 
</P>
<P>
Whether popular or not, Kilroe's astute opinions always carried weight, as much 
weight as the considerable poundage he piled on the top horses for five 
decades, from New York to California, while working as the head of racing 
departments at most of America's major race tracks. Racing is poorer now that 
Kilroe, who suffered a stroke in April 1989, has retired from Santa Anita and 
won't be giving those incisive, decisive opinions on a daily basis anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Kilroe, who recently celebrated his 78th birthday, went through the 
executive-suite titles during his 40 years at Santa Anita -- assistant racing 
secretary, handicapper, racing secretary, director of racing, vice president, 
senior vice president. But he remained the same guy who walked through Webb 
Everett's door in 1950 and quickly shocked the Eastern racing Establishment, 
which thought that a big race out West might still be the cowboys against the 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
"Jimmy dealt with grooms and hotwalkers the same way he dealt with the 
wealthiest of (horse) owners," said Tommy Robbins, Kilroe's successor at Santa 
Anita. "No matter who they were, he made everybody feel that they had a chance 
in this game." 
</P>
<P>
The son of a New York physician who became president of the old Jamaica track, 
Kilroe seemed bred and destined to spend the rest of his life at tracks back 
there. When Kilroe's move to the West Coast became permanent toward the end of 
the 1950s, his colleagues, the late Francis Dunne in particular, asked 
repeatedly how he could forsake New York. 
</P>
<P>
"In those days, New York was the national leader in both quality horses and 
purse money," said Tommy Trotter, who was Kilroe's successor in New York. 
"California was running a distant second. But Jimmy, as usual, was showing his 
tremendous foresight. He had the feeling that California was on the verge of 
some tremendous growth and he was very instrumental in that (racing) growth." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Santa Anita's crowds double the average daily turnout at Belmont Park, and 
California's three major tracks -- Santa Anita, Hollywood Park and Del Mar -- 
have used a successful off-track betting system that far outdistances the New 
York tracks in mutuel handle. 
</P>
<P>
Kilroe has worked them all in the Southland, but he's most identified with 
Santa Anita. "Jimmy Kilroe is the linchpin of Santa Anita's greatness," said 
Lou Eilken, who worked alongside Kilroe in several racing offices. 
</P>
<P>
The Kilroe touch in administration, as soft and effective as Bill Shoemaker's 
was in the saddle, is best described by Eilken. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the ultimate diplomat," Eilken said. "He never took a position where he 
made himself vulnerable. He had the finesse of a secretary of state." 
</P>
<P>
Known for taking the long, pragmatic view of the game -- 12 years ago, long 
before virtually every track in the country was offering exactas and trifectas 
by the bushel, he warned the sport about the evils of the exotic wagers -- 
Kilroe could act with compelling swiftness when he had to. 
</P>
<P>
Once, during Dr. Charles Strub's regime at Santa Anita, the track faced a 
crisis near the end of a racing day. In the next-to-last race, the starting 
gate collapsed into the inner rail as it was being taken off the track. It 
protruded onto the main track, presenting an immovable hazard for horses and 
jockeys that might be going in the last race. 
</P>
<P>
Kilroe reached for the phone and suggested to Strub that the last race, which 
was to be run on dirt, be moved to the grass if the horsemen would approve. 
Strub thought that was a good idea, and Kilroe ran down to the paddock and 
persuaded most of the trainers to run their horses on grass. From a standing 
start, without a gate, the race was run. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, Kilroe told racing that while the proliferation of exactas and 
trifectas might be good for the bottom line, such big-payoff bets would imperil 
the integrity of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"The trifecta is the motivation for 90% of the scandals that have hit our 
sport," Kilroe said. "It's a lure for guys in search of sudden wealth. It's an 
invitation to steal in a country where the pursuit of happiness has been 
translated into the pursuit of the tax-free buck. Gimmick betting could even 
result in the demise of the sport itself. A sport which has survived since the 
days of James I may find itself at the mercy of tinhorn gamblers." 
</P>
<P>
Racing has endured, but Kilroe was right about an exacta or a trifecta being at 
the bottom of nearly every attempted betting coup. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins first met Kilroe in the late 1960s while working in the racing office 
at Del Mar during summer vacation from high school. "I was in awe of him 
because of his stature," Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
A few years later, Kilroe hired him as an entry clerk at Santa Anita, and now 
Robbins is a a track vice president. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things we have to do is to keep Jimmy coming out to the track," 
Robbins said. "We can still be learning from him." 
</P>
<P>
That may not be difficult. In the past year, despite his stroke, Kilroe has 
been a frequent visitor, usually grabbing a seat in a box near the finish line, 
where the late Connie Ring used to sit. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Arlington International Racecourse is desperate to fill the field for its 
Challenge Cup on Aug. 4. After Criminal Type, Sunday Silence and Easy Goer, the 
list of probable entrants dips to Opening Verse, Mi Selecto and Santangelo, and 
it's doubtful that the invitational race will come up with its desired 
eight-horse field. Santangelo, fourth in the Hollywood Gold Cup behind Criminal 
Type, Sunday Silence and Opening Verse, has yet to win a race in the United 
States after 10 starts. 
</P>
<P>
Timeless Answer, high weight at 118 pounds in Saturday's $200,000 Bel-Air 
Handicap at Hollywood Park, will be joined by seven others, including the Brian 
Mayberry-trained entry of Exemplary Leader and Prospectors Gamble. Others 
entered are Annual Date, Exploding Prospect, Hot Operator, Charlatan and Music 
Prospector, who as a 3-year-old gets in against older horses carrying 112 
pounds.

NEGRO LEAGUE PLAYER STILL HEARS THE CHEERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lonnie Summers, now 73, doesn't step up to the plate anymore. Or squat behind 
it and flash signals to the pitcher. But when the former catcher and batting 
champion picked up a bat in the living room of his Inglewood home the other 
day, he instinctively held it up as if ready to take a cut. 
</P>
<P>
"Wait a minute," he said in the middle of a conversation about the good old 
days, disappearing into another room. He came back with a team photo, 
disappeared again and returned with a huge stack of tattered newspaper 
clippings from decades ago. The mementos, and the memories they evoked, had not 
been hauled out for a while. 
</P>
<P>
Things were different during his years behind the plate, Summers recalled. 
Baseball was tougher, both on and off the field. The bus rides were long; the 
pay was low. And, oh yeah, blacks played on different ball diamonds from 
whites. 
</P>
<P>
Summers, an Oklahoma native who hung up his glove in 1954, is one of an 
estimated 140 survivors of the Negro Leagues, the sole professional baseball 
forum for blacks in the United States before Branch Rickey, general manager of 
the Brooklyn Dodgers, began the integration of the major leagues by signing 
Jackie Robinson in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
"Lonnie was one of those big, strong ballplayers who hit powerful line drives," 
said Chico Renfroe, an Atlanta-based sportswriter. "He hit some of the most 
screaming line drives you've seen in your life." 
</P>
<P>
Renfroe, himself a former Negro League player, said it was only "Father Time 
that kept (Summers) from joining Jackie in the majors." 
</P>
<P>
Summers' professional career began in the late 1930s, when he played for the 
Baltimore Elite Giants in the Negro Leagues for a few years. Then, for the next 
decade and a half, he played on teams in Puerto Rico, Mexico and various South 
American countries before returning to the Negro Leagues' Chicago American 
Giants. He ended his career playing in a semi-professional integrated league 
based in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Summers, whose wife died recently, said it had been a long time since he'd 
thought about his glory days -- the game in Mexico in which he batted in 11 
runs, or the Negro League All-Star game at Chicago's Comiskey Park in which he 
played with Junior Gilliam, a star second baseman for the Baltimore Elites who 
later signed with the Dodgers and become rookie of the year in the majors in 
1953. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball was not on Summers' mind, he said, when he received a phone call last 
month inviting him to receive a plaque from the Inglewood City Council. The 
recognition was part of a nationwide program organized by Renfroe and sponsored 
by the Southern Bell telephone company of Atlanta to ensure that young people 
do not forget the trailblazers of the Negro League. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a part of history, and they're dying off so fast," Renfroe said. "People 
still tell me they didn't know there was a separate league for blacks." 
</P>
<P>
Baseball could be an especially grueling game back then, Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
"I once played a double-header in Chicago, rode all night to Philadelphia (on 
the team bus) to play one game and then headed out that day to play in Chicago 
again. After you took a shower, you sometimes didn't even have time to get 
something to eat before the bus left." 
</P>
<P>
Teams sometimes played three games a day and eight in a weekend. To pass the 
time on the rickety buses, team members played checkers, slept, gossiped or 
took turns driving. When the team finally reached its destination, there were 
segregated hotels, restaurants and water fountains to contend with. 
</P>
<P>
Renfroe said gas-station water fountains marked "Colored" had lukewarm water, 
but the ones marked "White" offered cold water. The team members could not 
drink from the cold fountain, but they sometimes surreptitiously filled a 
container with the cold water and drank it on the bus. 
</P>
<P>
Once, Summers recalled, he and his teammates entered a packed restaurant in 
Detroit after a game and were told by the manager that the eating establishment 
was closed. 
</P>
<P>
But it's full, they protested. 
</P>
<P>
It's closed, the manager insisted. 
</P>
<P>
They ate down the street. 
</P>
<P>
Summers said black team members knew to stay out of certain parts of town. 
Meanwhile, the routine of playing and quickly moving on to the next game kept 
racial incidents to a minimum, he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was a love of baseball that kept players going, Summers said, not huge 
salaries. He earned $250 a month when he started, with a $2-a-day eating 
allowance for out-of-town games. The salary improved when he crossed the border 
to play in Mexico, but even then he earned less than his white teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Summers would not criticize the high salaries being paid his contemporary 
counterparts, saying they deserve what they are getting. He added, however, 
that ballplayers today do not appear to enjoy the game as much as Negro League 
players did. 
</P>
<P>
Summers said getting a chance to play in the majors did not prey on his mind 
during his career. Negro League baseball was highly competitive; its teams 
frequently beat major league teams in exhibition games. "I played against the 
best and with the best," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But looking back, Summers said he does sometimes feel that he was cheated out 
of the big time. Once Robinson broke the color line, younger Negro Leaguers 
such as Willie Mays, Roy Campanella, Ernie Banks and Hank Aaron went to the 
majors. "It just shows that we could have done it all along," Summers said.

"I missed out on a lot," he said. "I had an excellent arm in my prime, and as 
far as hitting and catching and running was concerned, I knew I could play. The 
thing was getting the break. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the game of baseball owes us something. But I would never bring it up 
because I know the first thing they're going to say: 'Why should we give you 
something when you didn't make it? You didn't make it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Summers moved to Los Angeles after he left baseball and became a janitor in Los 
Angeles schools. He retired in the mid-1980s after 29 1/2 years on the job. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball, once his obsession, has lost some of its charm as the years have 
passed. Summers has been invited to Dodger Stadium as a dignitary but has 
turned down the offer. He still occasionally gets to the ballpark but prefers 
to sit by himself in the bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
"If I go to the ballpark now, I don't let anyone know I'm there," he said. "I 
go to watch the game, not to celebrate anything." 
</P>
<P>
Summers had second thoughts about receiving the plaque from Inglewood but 
finally decided to accept it. Now, next to the team pictures and other baseball 
photos lining the walls of his home is a fancy proclamation. "Read it," he 
says. "It's all true." 
</P>
<P>
"These players," it says, "endured countless miles on the road, accommodations 
which were less than accommodating (and) pay which was no reflection of their 
talents and efforts. The strides made, the trails blazed, the sacrifices 
endured . . . and the heights reached will forever maintain their place in 
history."

MILESTONE IS MARKED IN POINT MUGU CEREMONY; 
</P>
<P>
NEW COMMAND: NAVY CMDR. ROSEMARY MARINER BECOMES THE FIRST WOMAN IN THE U.S. 
ARMED SERVICES TO LEAD AN OPERATIONAL AIR SQUADRON.

<P>
Crediting her success to "simple perseverance," Navy Cmdr. Rosemary (Sabre) 
Mariner assumed command Thursday of a squadron of jet pilots at Point Mugu 
Naval Air Station, becoming the first woman in the U.S. armed services to lead 
an operational air squadron. 
</P>
<P>
As an occasional jet boomed overhead, Mariner took over leadership of the 
squadron from Cmdr. Charles H. Smith in solemn change-of-command ceremonies not 
far from the tarmac of the air strip. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief speech, Mariner, 37, who was the first woman military pilot to fly 
tactical jets and front-line attack planes during the 1970s, recalled being one 
of the first eight women accepted for military flight training 17 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We never accepted that it was OK for 'girls' to accept a lower standard, to 
expect less of or for themselves than men," Mariner said. "Like so many of 
life's achievements, the key is simple perseverance." 
</P>
<P>
The 300-member, shore-based squadron, nicknamed the "Flashbacks," provides 
simulated hostile electronic warfare for Atlantic and Pacific Fleet training 
exercises. The squadron is nearly one-third female. 
</P>
<P>
Although federal law prohibits women from performing combat duty, Mariner cited 
the great strides made by the more than 200 women who have earned Navy 
aviator's wings -- including five who lost their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"The things that were burning issues of my generation -- flying jets, carrier 
qualifications, and going to sea -- are now routine events for women entering 
naval aviation," Mariner said. "Our major accomplishment which we pass to them 
is equal flight training. This was obtained not so much by any great talent as 
by audacity and tenacity." 
</P>
<P>
But Thursday, she expressed regret that she had not seen combat duty like her 
husband and fellow officer, Lt. Cmdr. George Thomas Mariner, now stationed at 
the Pacific Missile Test Center, who she said "has been my eyes in a world that 
I am not allowed to see firsthand." 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier interview, however, Mariner expressed optimism that women will 
see combat duty by the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no longer an issue," she said. "It's going to happen as a result of the 
demographics. The choice will be either drafting males or accepting females" 
for combat. 
</P>
<P>
In accepting her new duties, Mariner thanked many of the senior male officers 
with whom she has served, saying that they persuaded her to remain in the Navy 
years ago when, faced with the difficulties confronting women and the lure of a 
lucrative career as a commercial pilot, she considered resigning. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of them are combat-experienced aviators who, for various reasons, chose 
to help female naval aviators by opening policy doors that created new 
opportunities in the face of stiff and often emotional opposition," Mariner 
said. "Because of them I owe a tremendous debt that can only be repaid by doing 
the same for other young men and women that need just a chance to perform." 
</P>
<P>
Mariner, an 18-year Navy veteran, also thanked pioneer women aviators such as 
the Ninety-Nines, a group of professional female fliers founded by Amelia 
Earhart, and the WASPS, or Women Air Force Service Pilots, women who served 
during World War II. She referred to pioneer women aviators as "the real first 
women aviators." At least eight WASPs were present at the ceremony, at 
Mariner's invitation. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego native also thanked her mother, a former World War II Navy nurse. 
</P>
<P>
As the entire squadron stood at attention, Mariner's husband pinned the "golden 
wings" of a squadron commander to her uniform, lightly thumping the pin once it 
was in place, in what Mariner later called a Navy tradition at 
change-of-command ceremonies. Mariner also received official use of an A-7 
attack plane, although she can fly any plane on the base. 
</P>
<P>
Rear Adm. Steven R. Briggs, commander of the Pacific Fleet's Light Attack Wing, 
called the ceremony "an historic moment in naval aviation. 
</P>
<P>
"Rosemary Mariner is not here today because she is a woman," Briggs told the 
crowd. "She is not here today because she is a fine naval aviator. . . . Cmdr. 
Rosemary Mariner is here today simply because her career is marked by 
distinguished exemplary performance as a superb naval officer, and she is 
taking merely the rightful place that that performance has earned her." 
</P>
<P>
Female Navy aviators at the ceremonies extolled Mariner's leadership abilities 
and the significance of the event. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of overwhelming to me -- I'm so incredibly proud of her," said Lt. 
Cmdr. Tricia Beckman, 37, who flew from St. Louis for the ceremonies. "She 
gives credit to her mentors, but she's also one herself. She's an example for 
the rest of us." 
</P>
<P>
Vi Cowden, 73, a former WASP pursuit pilot who ferried planes from factories to 
their points of departure to the front lines, called the event "a great day for 
girls in aviation." 
</P>
<P>
Like other WASPs, Cowden said she has seen so many barriers for female aviators 
fall over the years that she thinks it's just a matter of time before women are 
also allowed in combat duty. 
</P>
<P>
"If they can do the job and are qualified there should be no discrimination," 
Cowden said. 
</P>
<P>
At a reception after the ceremony, Mariner expressed optimism that her 
installation as a female squadron leader is a precedent for similar Navy 
promotions for other women. 
</P>
<P>
"It's symbolic," Mariner said. "I should be the first of many, and it will no 
longer be a newsworthy event."

SCRIPPS RECRUITS COVETED CHEMIST; 
</P>
<P>
SCIENCE: AN MIT PROFESSOR ACCLAIMED FOR MEDICINE-RELATED RESEARCH WILL TAKE AN 
ENDOWED CHAIR IN RESEARCH INSTITUTE'S NEW CHEMISTRY DEPARTMENT. 
</P>

<P>
Moving aggressively to buttress a chemistry department that is just a year old, 
the Scripps Research Institute has hired a world-renowned chemist for an 
endowed research chair. 
</P>
<P>
K. Barry Sharpless, 49, will be trading an endowed professorship at 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology for the position in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a major achievement for us," said an exultant department chairman, 
K.C. Nicolaou. "He is a genius at discovering new reagents and reaction 
processes useful to the pharmaceutical and chemical industries, as well as to 
other researchers in chemistry and biology." 
</P>
<P>
Scripps received a $2.9-million grant in December to establish the chair that 
Sharpless will hold, the W. M. Keck Foundation Chair in Chemistry. The Keck 
foundation, funded with the bequest of the late oilman William Myron Keck, is 
based in Los Angeles. One of its best-known recent gifts was a $70-million 
donation for a state-of-the-art astronomical observatory in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Sharpless will not move to San Diego until next spring, when Scripps can locate 
him in temporary quarters while a new chemistry building is being constructed. 
</P>
<P>
The appointment brings to four the number of professors in the new department 
and is being portrayed by Scripps as a crucial step toward gaining the new 
department a reputation as a leading center for bio-organic chemistry, just a 
year after being established, Nicolaou said. 
</P>
<P>
The achievement is impressive, said Mark Wrighton, chairman of the MIT 
chemistry department that Sharpless will be leaving. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a remarkable achievement in a short period of time," Wrighton said. "I 
think Dr. (Richard) Lerner, (president of the institute), is to be 
congratulated upon assembling this group. It's really remarkable progress." 
</P>
<P>
He added, though, that Scripps clearly is taking a very narrow field within 
chemistry in which to specialize -- the field that is developing new techniques 
to build the "designer drugs" that scientists are dreaming up on 
supercomputers. 
</P>
<P>
"The breadth of activities is still modest in comparison to the leading 
departments. So I regard it as a collection of truly super people, but in only 
one part of chemistry," Wrighton said. 
</P>
<P>
More than two years ago, Scripps embarked on a program to add chemists to its 
research staff. Although officials emphasize that Scripps still will do basic 
research, the new chemists will also make the institute more likely to develop 
new drugs or other products to which Scripps would have lucrative patent 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
One more professor remains to be hired before all five professorships in the 
department will be filled, Nicolaou said. 
</P>
<P>
Sharpless is widely regarded for his work in finding new ways to synthesize 
organic molecules using metallic compounds, said department chairman K. C. 
Nicolaou. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Sharpless invented a process for using asymmetric metallic molecules 
to force oxygen atoms to bind to organic molecules in a particular 
three-dimensional orientation. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, the oxygen atoms can bind to a pair of carbon atoms in two different 
ways, known as "right-handed" or "left-handed" isomers. 
</P>
<P>
(In the drug or nutritional store, consumers see examples of this in amino acid 
supplements such as lysine, often seen labeled as L-lysine. The right-handed 
form would be R-lysine.) 
</P>
<P>
Sharpless's method assures that all the molecules in a chemical batch will be 
purely of the same handedness. The handedness of organic molecules is 
significant because the human body generally uses only one isomer of a 
compound, so pharmaceuticals must be given only in that form. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, pharmaceuticals are first synthesized and then purified, but 
Sharpless's method eventually could eliminate the need for a purification step, 
Nicolaou said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it is fundamental to much of the synthetic organic chemistry being 
done in research laboratories today, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Elected in 1985 to the National Academy of Sciences, Sharpless did his graduate 
work at Stanford University, and postdoctoral work at Stanford and at Harvard 
University. He has been at MIT since 1970, except for 1977-80 when he was a 
chemistry professor at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, he spent three months at California Institute of Technology in 
Pasadena, which offered him a permanent post that he turned down, said his 
wife, Jan Sharpless.
